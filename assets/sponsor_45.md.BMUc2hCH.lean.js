He made an important contribution to the development of modern art by elevating the image of the industrial worker, docker and miner to an icon of modernity. His work is a reflection of the industrial, social and political developments of his day and represents a compassionate and committed view of man and the world.Meunier in Leuven at M-Museum Leuven Early life and education Constantin Meunier was born in the traditionally working-class area of Etterbeek in Brussels. His family was poor and suffered from the negative economic impact caused by the Belgian Revolution which had taken place the year before Meunier's birth. Meunier's father committed suicide when he was just four years old.Constantin Meunier, The return from harvest at dusk at Jean Moust Mining region He began studying sculpture at the age of 14 at the Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels in September 1845.Ian Mundell, Retrospective reveals the Flemish inspirations of Constantin Meunier at Flanders Today He studied under the sculptor Louis Jehotte (1804‚Äì84) from 1848. He also attended from 1852 the private studio of the sculptor Charles-Auguste Fraikin (fr).Pierre Baudson. \\"Meunier, Constantin.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 6 March 2016 While he encountered modestly success as a sculptor, his encounter with Gustave Courbet's social realist painting The Stone Breakers in 1851 caused him to doubt the ability of sculpture to adequate represent the contemporary social and artistic issues that were of concern to him. He therefore gave up sculpture in favour of painting which he practised almost exclusively for the next thirty years. Career Ophelia His first exhibit was a plaster sketch, The Garland, shown at the Brussels Salon in 1851. His first important painting, The Salle St Roch (1857), was followed by a series of paintings including A Trappist Funeral (1860), Trappists Ploughing (1863), in collaboration with Alfred Verwee, Divine Service at the Monastery of La Trappe (1871) and episodes of the German Peasants' War (1878), as well as of Belgium's own historical Peasants' War. About 1880 he was commissioned to illustrate those parts of Camille Lemonnier's description of Belgium in Le Tour du monde which referred to miners and factory-workers, and produced In the Factory, Smithery at Cockerill's, Melting Steel at the Factory at Seraing (1882), Returning from the Pit, and The Broken Crucible (1884). Three female miners In 1882 he was employed by the government to copy Pedro de Campa√±a's Descent from the Cross at Seville, and in Spain he painted such characteristic pictures as The Caf√© Concert, Procession on Good Friday, and The Tobacco Factory at Seville (Brussels Gallery). On his return to Belgium he was appointed professor at the Louvain Academy of Fine Arts. In 1885 he returned to sculpture and produced The Puddler, The Hammerer (1886), Firedamp (1889, Brussels Gallery), Le D√©bardeur (modeled 1885; many castings made 1889‚Äì1905), Ecce Homo (1891), The Old Mine-Horse (1891), The Mower (1892), The Glebe (1892), the monument to Father Damien at Louvain (1893), Puddler at the Furnace (1893), the scheme of decoration for the Botanical Garden of Brussels in collaboration with the sculptor Charles van der Stappen (1893), The Horse at the Pond, in the square in the north-east quarter of Brussels, and two unfinished works, the Monument to Labour and the √âmile Zola monument, in collaboration with the French sculptor Alexandre Charpentier. The Monument to Labour, which was acquired by the State for the Brussels Gallery, comprises four stone bas-reliefs: Industry, The Mine, Harvest, and the Harbour; four bronze statues: The Sower, The Smith, The Miner, and the Ancestor; and a bronze group, Maternity. He was one of the co-founders of the Soci√©t√© Libre des Beaux-Arts of Brussels and was a member of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers. Meunier was a freemason, and a member of the lodge Les Amis Philanthropes of the Grand Orient of Belgium in Brussels.Berend Bunk, Les tr√©sors du Temple: le Mus√©e belge de la Franc-ma√ßonnerie], Fonds Mercator, 2006, p. 109 Meunier died in Brussels on 4 April 1905.

She made her first on-screen appearance on 17 April 2003 and departed on 30 January 2007. The character died from injuries sustained in a car crash on 23 April 2007. Character development The serial's official website described Beth as an \\"open-minded\\" female who holds a \\"strong sense of personal morality and integrity\\". When characters get to know Beth she shows a \\"delicious sense of humour\\". Beth is portrayed as a country girl who did not see herself as \\"anything but a farmer's wife\\" whilst married to Jack Hunter (Ian Lind). Marriage and family mean everything to Beth and she also ignored her husband's affair to keep her family together. They also said that Beth's \\"world fell apart\\" when Jack died. One of Beth's main romances is with Tony Holden (Jon Sivewright). Sivewright said that both Beth and Tony have got \\"very good attitudes towards their kids\\" and are supportive to them and the community. Beth and Tony support each other when making parental decisions, even if they did not personally agree with the other's actions. Sivewright said that \\"even though Tony would question what Beth was doing, he was still supporting her. That‚Äôs what Beth does with Tony as well.\\" Beth features in many emotional storylines. House has said that after she had filmed an emotional scene, she exercised to forget about her character's feelings. Storylines Beth is the mother of Scott (Kip Gamblin), Kit (Amy Mizzi), Robbie (Jason Smith), Henry (Tobi Atkins) and Matilda (Indiana Evans). Beth was married to Jack, the father of her five children until his death in 2002. Beth had known about Jack's ongoing affair with Valerie Squires (Denise Roberts) and did not tell the children, thinking it would hurt their family. It later emerges Scott knew secretly and kept it to himself for the same reason as Beth. Beth arrives in Summer Bay and meets Rhys Sutherland (Michael Beckley) when their respective eldest children, Scott and Dani (Tammin Sursok) become a couple. When Kit arrives and begins drinking excessively, Rhys is on hand to support Beth. After Kit leaves for rehab, Beth and Rhys become a couple and Rhys later proposes. Following money troubles, Beth is forced to pull the rest of her children from their boarding schools and they all move in with the Sutherlands. In early 2004, Beth and Rhys marry in an intimate ceremony on the beach with most of the family attending and Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) and Colleen Smart (Lyn Collingwood) as witnesses. The day is marred when Rhy's daughter Kirsty (Christie Hayes) elopes with her fiance Kane Phillips (Sam Atwell) and argument ensues and Beth is forced to keep the peace. Beth and Rhy's marriage is tested numerous times by the many dramas of their combined brood, but nothing can prepare them for the return of Rhy's ex- wife, Shelley (Paula Forrest) when Kirsty suffers kidney problems and needs a transplant. Rhys gradually falls in love with Shelley again and leaves Summer Bay, breaking Beth's heart. Wanting to move on with her life, Beth reverts to her previous married name and swaps houses with Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) and Flynn Saunders (Joel McIlroy). When her new neighbour, widower Tony Holden arrives, Beth is taken with him and they become a couple. Graham Walters (Doug Scroope), Beth's father arrives in Summer Bay announcing he has sold his farm and when it is revealed he has married the much younger Amanda Vale (Holly Brisley), Beth is disgusted and constantly finds herself at odds with Amanda, as she had previously tried to manipulate Scott into believing she was pregnant. When Graham suffers a massive heart attack and recovers in hospital, he makes peace with Beth, telling her that he does not want to continue living should he suffer a relapse. Graham suffers another heart attack and is pronounced brain dead. Beth and Amanda battle over turning the machine off. Amanda wins the fight and is pleased as she is Graham's wife and needs to keep him alive in order to render the pre-nuptial agreement invalid and gain his assets. Robbie later turns the machine off and Beth is shocked but understanding. Beth tells Amanda she does not care about the money but wants Graham's war medals, which Amanda later gives her. Feeling trapped and longing to pursue her dreams of travelling the world, Beth is ready to go but Tony is firmly settled in Summer Bay. Tony supports her and she leaves to visit Scott and his partner Hayley Smith (Bec Cartwright) and their son, Noah in France then she visits Robbie, his wife Tasha (Isabel Lucas) and their daughter Ella in America. On the day Beth is due to return home, Kit goes into labour and Tony decides to wait for her to return. After Beth fails to appear, he assumes she has gone directly to the hospital and leaves to find her. On the way, Tony discovers a serious road traffic accident and is stopped by his son Jack (Paul O'Brien), who is one of the police officers on the scene who tries to break it to him that the body recovered from the wreckage is Beth. Tony, Kit and Matilda are left devastated and a memorial service for Beth is held in Summer Bay before her body is buried in her home town of Adelaide. Reception Sacha Molitorisz of The Sydney Morning Herald said that the episode featuring Beth and Rhys' wedding was better suited to \\"die hard fans\\". They criticised the plot for being \\"unengaging\\" and opined that the music, performances and dialogue were \\"painful\\" and \\"patchy\\".

Before accepting digital evidence a court will determine if the evidence is relevant, whether it is authentic, if it is hearsay and whether a copy is acceptable or the original is required. The use of digital evidence has increased in the past few decades as courts have allowed the use of e-mails, digital photographs, ATM transaction logs, word processing documents, instant message histories, files saved from accounting programs, spreadsheets, internet browser histories, databases, the contents of computer memory, computer backups, computer printouts, Global Positioning System tracks, logs from a hotel‚Äôs electronic door locks, and digital video or audio files. Many courts in the United States have applied the Federal Rules of Evidence to digital evidence in a similar way to traditional documents, although important differences such as the lack of established standards and procedures have been noted. In addition, digital evidence tends to be more voluminous, more difficult to destroy, easily modified, easily duplicated, potentially more expressive, and more readily available. As such, some courts have sometimes treated digital evidence differently for purposes of authentication, hearsay, the best evidence rule, and privilege. In December 2006, strict new rules were enacted within the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requiring the preservation and disclosure of electronically stored evidence. Digital evidence is often attacked for its authenticity due to the ease with which it can be modified, although courts are beginning to reject this argument without proof of tampering. Admissibility Digital evidence is often ruled inadmissible by courts because it was obtained without authorization. In most jurisdictions a warrant is required to seize and investigate digital devices. In a digital investigation this can present problems where, for example, evidence of other crimes are identified while investigating another. During a 1999 investigation into online harassment by Keith Schroeder investigators found pornographic images of children on his computer. A second warrant had to be obtained before the evidence could be used to charge Schroeder. Authentication As with any evidence, the proponent of digital evidence must lay the proper foundation. Courts largely concerned themselves with the reliability of such digital evidence. As such, early court decisions required that authentication called \\"for a more comprehensive foundation.\\" US v. Scholle, 553 F.2d 1109 (8th Cir. 1976). As courts became more familiar with digital documents, they backed away from the higher standard and have since held that \\"computer data compilations‚Ä¶ should be treated as any other record.\\" US v. Vela, 673 F.2d 86, 90 (5th Cir. 1982). A common attack on digital evidence is that digital media can be easily altered. However, in 2002 a US court ruled that \\"the fact that it is possible to alter data contained in a computer is plainly insufficient to establish untrustworthiness\\" (US v. Bonallo, 858 F. 2d 1427 - 1988 - Court of Appeals, 9th). Nevertheless, the \\"more comprehensive\\" foundation required by Scholle remains good practice. The American Law Reports lists a number of ways to establish the comprehensive foundation. It suggests that the proponent demonstrate \\"the reliability of the computer equipment\\", \\"the manner in which the basic data was initially entered\\", \\"the measures taken to ensure the accuracy of the data as entered\\", \\"the method of storing the data and the precautions taken to prevent its loss\\", \\"the reliability of the computer programs used to process the data\\", and \\"the measures taken to verify the accuracy of the program\\". In its turn it gave rise to a breed of commercial software technology solutions designed to preserve digital evidence in its original form and to authenticate it for admissibility in disputes and in court. =UK ACPO guidelines= In the United Kingdom, examiners usually follow guidelines issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) for the authentication and integrity of evidence. They were updated to Version 5 in October 2011 when computer based evidence was replaced with digital evidence reflecting the development of investigating information security incidents in a wider context. The guidelines consist of four principles: Principle 1: No action taken by law enforcement agencies, persons employed within those agencies or their agents should change data which may subsequently be relied upon in court. Principle 2: In circumstances where a person finds it necessary to access original data, that person must be competent to do so and be able to give evidence explaining the relevance and the implications of their actions. Principle 3: An audit trail or other record of all processes applied to digital evidence should be created and preserved. An independent third party should be able to examine those processes and achieve the same result. Principle 4: The person in charge of the investigation has overall responsibility for ensuring that the law and these principles are adhered to. These guidelines are widely accepted in courts of England and Scotland, but they do not constitute a legal requirement and their use is voluntary. It is arguable that whilst voluntary, non adherence is almost certain to lead to the exclusion of evidence that does not comply subject to the provisions of s 78 Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Power to exclude evidence obtained unfairly) =ADAM Principles= Building on the ACPO Guidelines with a more generic application outside of law enforcement, a doctoral thesis proposed the following overriding principles to be followed by digital forensic practitioners: #The activities of the digital forensic practitioner should not alter the original data. If the requirements of the work mean that this is not possible then the effect of the practitioner‚Äôs actions on the original data should be clearly identified and the process that caused any changes justified. #A complete record of all activities associated with the acquisition and handling of the original data and any copies of the original data must be maintained. This includes compliance with the appropriate rules of evidence, such as maintaining a chain of custody record, and verification processes such as hashing. #The digital forensic practitioner must not undertake any activities which are beyond their ability or knowledge. #The digital forensic practitioner must take into consideration all aspects of personal and equipment safety whilst undertaking their work. #At all times the legal rights of anyone affected by your actions should be considered. #The practitioner must be aware of all organizational policies and procedures relating to their activities #Communication must be maintained as appropriate with the client, legal practitioners, supervisors and other team members Best evidence rule Digital evidence is almost never in a format readable by humans, requiring additional steps to include digital documents as evidence (i.e. printing out the material). It has been argued that this change of format may mean digital evidence does not qualify under the \\"best evidence rule\\". However, the \\"Federal Rules of Evidence\\" rule 1001(3) states \\"if data are stored in a computer‚Ä¶, any printout or other output readable by sight, shown to reflect the data accurately, is an ‚Äòoriginal.‚Äô\\" Commonly courts do not bar printouts under the best evidence rule. In Aguimatang v. California State Lottery, the court gave near per se treatment to the admissibility of digital evidence stating \\"the computer printout does not violate the best evidence rule, because a computer printout is considered an ‚Äòoriginal.‚Äô\\" 234 Cal.

Chandler recognizes the 'battle' as an offensive. on 25 July 1813 by Marshal Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult from the Pyr√©n√©es region on Emperor Napoleon‚Äôs order, in the hope of relieving French garrisons under siege at Pamplona and San Sebasti√°n. After initial success the offensive ground to a halt in face of increased allied resistance under the command of Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Wellington. Soult abandoned the offensive on 30 July and headed toward France, having failed to relieve either garrison. The Battle of the Pyrenees involved several distinct actions. On 25 July, Soult and two French corps fought the reinforced British 4th Division and a Spanish division at the Battle of Roncesvalles. The Allied force successfully held off all attacks during the day, but retreated from the Roncesvalles Pass that night in the face of overwhelming French numerical superiority. Also on the 25th, a third French corps severely tried the British 2nd Division at the Battle of Maya. The British withdrew from the Maya Pass that evening. Wellington rallied his troops a short distance north of Pamplona and repelled the attacks of Soult's two corps at the Battle of Sorauren on 28 July. Instead of falling back to the northeast toward Roncesvalles Pass, Soult made contact with his third corps on 29 July and began to move north. On 30 July, Wellington attacked Soult's rearguards at Sourauren, driving some French troops to the northeast, while most continued to the north. Rather than use the Maya Pass, Soult elected to head north up the Bidassoa River valley. He managed to evade Allied attempts to surround his troops at Yanci on 1 August and escaped across a nearby pass after a final rearguard action at Etxalar on 2 August. The French suffered nearly twice as many casualties as the Allied army.  Background  Wellington at Sorauren by Thomas Jones Barker After the decisive French defeat at the Battle of Vitoria, Marshal Soult consolidated the remnants of four armies into a single force of 80,000 troops. Marshal Soult‚Äôs plan was to relieve the siege at Pamplona first, then swing the army westward to relieve the siege at San Sebasti√°n.Fisher and Fremont-Barnes, p. 235  Forces  Clausel's Lieutenancy (army corps) of the Left consisted of the infantry divisions of Generals of Division Nicolas Fran√ßois Conroux, Edm√©- Martin Vandermaesen, and Eloi Charlemagne Taupin. Conroux's 4th Division had 7,056 men in nine battalions; Vandermaesen's 5th Division counted 4,181 troops in seven battalions; Taupin's 8th Division numbered 5,981 infantry in nine battalions. D'Erlon's Lieutenancy of the Center included the infantry divisions of Generals of Division Jean Barth√©lemy Darmagnac, Louis Jean Nicolas Abb√©, and Jean-Pierre Maransin. Darmagnac's 2nd Division counted 6,961 troops in eight battalions; Abb√©'s 3rd Division was made up of 8,030 soldiers in nine battalions; Maransin's 6th Division had 5,966 men in seven battalions. Reille's Lieutenancy of the Right had the divisions of Generals of Division Maximilien Sebastien Foy, Antoine Louis Popon de Maucune, and Thomas Mignot de Lamartini√®re. Foy's 1st Division numbered 5,922 soldiers in nine battalions; Maucune's 7th Division had 4,186 infantry in seven battalions; Lamartini√®re's 9th Division comprised 7,127 troops in 10 battalions.Glover, p. 393 Each Corps had a single cavalry regiment attached for scouting purposes, for a total of 808 horsemen. The French Reserve under General of Division Eugene-Casimir Villatte held the defences on the lower Bidassoa River near the Bay of Biscay. The reserves numbered 9,102 French troops in 14 battalions, 2,066 Germans in four battalions, 1,349 Italians in three battalions, 1,168 Spanish in three battalions, 1,550 French National Guards, and 2,019 King's Guards in three battalions, the last being the remnant of Joseph Bonaparte's bodyguard. In addition, General of Division Pierre Beno√Æt Soult commanded 3,981 light cavalrymen in 10 regiments and General of Division Anne-Fran√ßois-Charles Trelliard led 2,358 dragoons in six regiments. The two cavalry divisions remained in the rear. There were about 7,900 gunners, sappers, wagon drivers, and other troops. General of Brigade Louis Emmanuel Rey and 3,000 troops garrisoned San Sebasti√°n while General of Brigade Louis Pierre Jean Cassan held Pamplona with a 3,500-man garrison. At Bayonne were 5,595 French conscripts. Altogether, Soult had 99,906 troops under his orders. Of this total he used 63,572 men in his offensive.Gates, 522-523 Wellington defended the line of the western Pyrenees with a covering force of 62,000 men. These faced to the northeast, with the left anchored on the Bay of Biscay at the mouth of the Bidassoa River. From left to right, he deployed the following infantry divisions: Major General Kenneth Howard's 1st on the coast, Major General Charles Alten's Light at Lesaka, Lieutenant General George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie's 7th at Etxalar, Lieutenant General William Stewart's 2nd at the Maya Pass and Elizondo, Major General Francisco Silveira, Count of Amarante's Portuguese near Izpegi Pass, Lieutenant General Lowry Cole's 4th at Roncevaux Pass and Major General Pablo Morillo's Spanish also at Roncevaux. In reserve were Major General Denis Pack's 6th Division at Doneztebe, and Lieutenant General Thomas Picton's 3rd Division at Olague, plus other Portuguese and Spanish units. Cavalry being of little value in the mountains, Wellington stationed most of his far to the rear, except for two light dragoon brigades. The Siege of San Sebasti√°n was conducted by Major General James Leith's 5th Division and other units under the direction of Lieutenant General Thomas Graham.Smith, p. 448 Pamplona was besieged by General Henry O'Donnell, 1st Count of la Bisbal's Spanish division and other units.Chandler, p. 327  Battle =Maya and Roncesvalles= The surprise offensive opened on 25 July 1813. The passes of Maya (north of Pamplona) and Roncesvaux (northeast of Pamplona) were both weakly held by the allies spread over a 50-mile front from Pamplona to the sea. After breaking through the Maya Pass, d'Erlon was to move southwest through the Baztan valley to seize the Pass of Velate at , north of Pamplona. After storming Roncesvaux Pass, Clausel and Reille were instructed to march southwest toward Pamplona. Soult had trouble securing rations for his soldiers, so he launched his offensive with only four days' rations.Glover, p. 251 Battle of the Pyrenees, 25 July 1813 The responsibility for Maya Pass lay with Stewart's 2nd Division. That morning, Stewart decided that the French would not attack, left the brigades of Major General William Pringle and Lieutenant Colonel John Cameron in the valley and rode to Elizondo, ten miles to the south. Some French soldiers were seen and light companies were sent up in support of the picket. When the French attacked in force, the British forces in the valley had to climb to the pass in full kit. By the time they got up, the picket force was wiped out and 10,000 of d'Erlon's men occupied the pass. In the Battle of Maya, Pringle opposed Darmagnac's division, while Cameron faced the rest of the French corps. The 4,000 British tried manfully to retake the pass, but they were unable to do so. On the other hand, the narrowness of the defile helped the British to hold off d'Erlon's immensely superior force. When Stewart returned at 2:00 pm, he pulled the redcoats back to a second position. By 3:00 pm, the British were on the verge of disaster. At this point, Major General Edward Barnes's brigade of Dalhousie's 7th Division arrived from the west to strike d'Erlon in the flank and the battle died down.Glover, pp. 251-252 The British lost 1,610 men and four cannons out of 6,000, while French losses numbered 2,100 out of 20,900. That evening, Lieutenant General Rowland Hill authorized a retreat to Elizondo.Smith, pp. 432-433 D'Erlon worried about Barnes's incursion and pursued very cautiously the next day. He only advanced six miles on the 26th.Glover, p. 253 Cole held Roncesvalles Pass with his 4th Division, Morillo's Spanish Division and Major General John Byng's brigade of the 2nd Division, a total of 11,000 men. From 6:00 to 9:00 am, Byng's brigade took the brunt of Clausel's assault in the Battle of Roncesvalles, while Cole rushed up reinforcements. Cole fended off the French until 5:00 pm when thick fog rolled in.Chandler, p. 384 The Allies lost 350 men while French casualties were about 530.Smith, p. 432 Troubled by a small French probe of his right flank and fearful that 36,000 Frenchmen would swamp him out of the mist, Cole quit the area and retreated toward Pamplona, though he had been ordered to hold the pass \\"to the utmost\\". A worse mistake in Wellington's eyes was Cole's failure to report his actions in a timely manner. When Picton appeared with his 6,000-man 3rd Division, Cole convinced him to retreat also.Glover, pp. 252-253 Fog at Roncesvalles Because of the fog, the French did not realise that the British had decamped until the next morning. Clausel pursued, but did not come into contact with Cole's rear guard until late in the afternoon. Meanwhile, Reille's corps attempted to use an alternate path across the mountains and wound up marching in a circle.Glover, pp. 253-254 A push on 27 July from Roncesvalles Pass by troops personally commanded by Marshal Soult, got within 10 miles of Pamplona.Esdaile, p. 462. Note that this is disputed. However, Picton's British and Portuguese forces made a stand on an excellent defensive position near the village of Sorauren, just north of Pamplona.Glover, p. 254 Believing d'Erlon's corps to be the main French attack and receiving no information from Cole, Wellington spent 26 July setting up his defences in the direction of Maya Pass. Leaving Hill in charge at Elizondo, he then rode toward Pamplona on 27 July to find out what was happening. He ordered Pack's 6th Division to join Cole and Picton. =Sorauren and Soult's retreat= On 27 July, Wellington joined the 17,000 British and Portuguese troops at Sorauren. To Clausel's intense frustration, Soult decided to wait for Reille's tardy corps to arrive and even took a nap.Glover, p. 255 The next day, in the Battle of Sorauren, Soult's 36,000 men unsuccessfully attacked the 24,000 Allied troops in front of Pamplona. The Allies lost 2,652 casualties while French losses were probably heavier. Hill's corps, blocking d'Erlon, was pulled back by Wellington toward Sorauren. But d'Erlon was never able to reach Sorauren to help Soult. Instead, when d'Erlon's cavalry made contact with Soult on the morning of 29 July, Soult decided to move to the north rather than retreat northeast toward Roncesvalles. As 30 July dawned, Soult's men could be seen retreating east to west across the British front. Now reinforced by his 7th Division, Wellington ordered an attack.Glover, pp. 256-257 The French clung to Sorauren village in a bitter fight before being driven away. The British reported 538 casualties while French losses were much heavier. Cut off by the sudden British offensive, Foy's division at the east end of the French line retreated by way of Roncesvalles Pass to the northeast. Foy was joined by elements of Reille's and Clausel's commands so that he took as many as 12,000 men with him. Meanwhile, d'Erlon led the rest of the French army in a retreat to the north, pushing back Hill's forces back just enough to get through.Glover, p. 257 On 30 July at Beunza, Abb√©'s division of d'Erlon suffered 750 casualties, while the Allies suffered 1,056: 156 British and 900 Portuguese. Instead of retreating over Maya Pass as Wellington expected, Soult marched north up the Bidassoa River valley. At Yanci, part of Major General Francisco de Longa's Spanish division blocked a key bridge. For two hours, without support from the rest of their division, a battalion of the 2nd Asturias Regiment held off d'Erlon's entire corps. Finally, five French battalions stormed the bridge and Soult's defeated army crossed over it. Too late to block the retreat, Alten's Light Division arrived from Leitza and fired into the gorge from above, causing chaos in the French column. His starving army fast disintegrating into a mob, Soult swung northeast through Etxalar (Echelar) and reached the French frontier via the Col de Lizarrieta at on 2 August.Glover, pp. 257-258 On that day, elements of Conroux's and Lamartini√®re's divisions fought a rearguard action at Etxalar against Major General Robert Ross' brigade of Cole's division, Barnes' brigade, and the 95th Rifles. The French suffered about 300 casualties, while inflicting a loss of 368 killed, wounded, and missing on their pursuers. Meanwhile, over 1,000 French wounded were abandoned and captured by the Allies.Smith, p. 439  Conclusion  Soult failed to relieve the sieges at San Sebastian and Pamplona, suffered about 13,000 casualties, and had to withdraw to French soil weakened and demoralised. Soult's army lost 1,313 killed, 8,582 wounded, and 2,702 captured. Out of 1,318 French officers, 423 became casualties. Wellington's total losses for the campaign were 7,000. The next action was the Battle of San Marcial at the end of August.Glover, p. 263  Footnotes  References  *Chandler, David. Dictionary of the Napoleonic Wars. New York: Macmillan, 1979. *Esdaile, C.

Career Peterson became involved in wrestling in grade school when he transferred from football to amateur wrestling as result of a personality clash with the football coach. His amateur career was halted by a motorcycle accident in his junior year of high school. After playing a high school wrestler in the film Take Down with Lorenzo Lamas, Peterson married and had a child. He began working in the construction industry, but decided after two years to return to amateur wrestling. Peterson earned wrestling scholarships to junior college and then to Iowa State University, competing in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). In 1985 he was an All-American, placed fifth in the NCAA competition and also won the Gorriarian award for having the most falls in the least amount of time at the tournament. Every match he won that year at the NCAA's, he won by fall. In 1986 Peterson became a National Champion placing First in a year Iowa State won the National Championship as a Team. Then he relocated to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. While working as a security guard, he was introduced to professional wrestler Red Bastien by his boss, and decided to train with him. =Early career= Peterson worked for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in March 1986, and put together the steel cage used in the main event of WrestleMania 2. With his training complete, he debuted in June 1987 and soon after traveled to Japan to work for New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), where he trained in the New Japan Dojo alongside fellow gaijin Chris Benoit for five months. In 1988, Peterson developed the character Max Pain (short for \\"Maximum Pain\\"), a sinister, grungy, Jimi Hendrix-loving heavy metal guitarist. His original idea was Lucifer Payne, but he felt that this was too foreboding. He used the name Max Payne, hailing from Hell's Kitchen, New York nationally in the United States as well as in Europe and Japan. The character had a neo-noir look and feel, as far as the live theater of professional wrestling would allow. The name Max came from the 1980s Pepsi Cola spokesman Max Headroom, and Peterson later added an extra \\"X\\" at the suggestion of a friend. Following a short stint with the Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF), Pain debuted in the Tennessee-based Continental Wrestling Association (CWA). He quickly began pursuing the CWA Heavyweight Championship, and on February 8, 1988 in Memphis he defeated Jerry Lawler to win the championship. He then went after Lawler's AWA World Heavyweight Championship, but was unable to win the title. He forfeited the CWA Championship to Brickhouse Brown on May 23, but won the title once more on June 27. His second reign ended on July 10 when he was defeated by Phil Hickerson. Pain left the CWA after a year before returning to Utah, where he opened his own promotion, featuring wrestlers such as Louie Spicolli. He also made an appearance under his real name as a jobber on a February 1989 episode of WWF Prime Time Wrestling, losing to Bret Hart. After his employees began to leave the territory, Peterson applied for a job with WordPerfect. Soon after, he received a phone call from Benoit, who invited him to join an upcoming tour of Germany. Peterson received his plane ticket to Germany half an hour before he received a job offer from WordPerfect, so decided to join the tour. He spent six months in the German Catch Wrestling Association as Heavy Metal Buffalo, and won the vacant CWA Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship on October 25, 1992, defeating Giant Haystacks. He then successfully defended the title against The Warlord at Euro Catch Festival on December 19. He vacated the title the following year when he returned to the United States. =World Championship Wrestling (1993‚Äì1994)= World Championship Wrestling (WCW) booker Bill Watts was impressed by Peterson's amateur credentials, and hired him in 1993, with Peterson relocating to Marietta, Georgia. Peterson made his televised debut in WCW as the villain Maxx Payne on the January 30, 1993 episode of Worldwide by defeating local competitor Scott Allen. Peterson's first pay-per-view match was at SuperBrawl III, where he played TapsSuperbrawl III commentary Jesse Ventura makes the comment to Tony Schiavone \\"Did you notice what song he was playing, Schiavone? \\"Taps.\\" I'm surprised you knew that. I guess that's in reference to Dustin Rhodes, it's lights out\\" on his guitar before challenging Dustin Rhodes for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship, substituting for the injured Ron Simmons. After Rhodes locked him in an abdominal stretch from which he was unable to escape, Payne pushed the referee over rather than submit and was subsequently disqualified. He'd also played the national anthem at the beginning of the show. At the June 17 Clash of the Champions XXIII, Payne shot Johnny B. Badd in the face with a confetti gun, (kayfabe) scarring him so badly that he had to wear a mask and forcing him to forfeit their scheduled match. This led to a match at Beach Blast on July 18, which Payne lost. They faced one another again at the August 18 Clash of the Champions XXIV in a mask versus guitar match, with Payne putting his guitar on the line in order to unmask and therefore humiliate the mutilated Badd. Badd won once more and took Payne's guitar. Payne took part in WCW's Jesse \\"The Body\\" Ventura Strong-Arm Tournament in late 1993, but was eliminated in the first round by Sid Vicious. On November 20, Payne entered the Battlebowl, a tournament which saw randomly assigned tag team partners work together in order to progress to a battle royal. He was partnered with 2 Cold Scorpio, with whom he lost in the first round to Stunning Steve Austin and Ric Flair. Turning face, Payne formed a tag team with Cactus Jack towards the end of the year. At Starrcade 1993 they defeated Tex Slazenger and Shanghai Pierce, and at the January 27, 1994 Clash of the Champions XXVI, they defeated The Nasty Boys. They faced the Nasty Boys once more, this time for the WCW World Tag Team Championships, in a Chicago Street Fight at Spring Stampede 1994, but were defeated. During his and Jack's feud with The Nasty Boys, Payne had become increasingly unhappy with their stiffness and insistence on controlling the match. During their brawl at SuperBrawl IV, Brian Knobbs and Payne did not cooperate on a fall, and Knobbs broke his shoulder as a result. After the match, WCW President Eric Bischoff shouted at Payne for hurting Knobbs, and Payne responded in kind. As a result, he was subsequently buried. He was fired from WCW soon after, although he did help Jack and his new partner, Kevin Sullivan, defeat The Nasty Boys with a guitar shot. =World Wrestling Federation (1995)= The morning after he was released by WCW, Peterson was contacted by wrestler Rick Rude, who convinced WWF owner Vince McMahon to hire him. Renamed Man Mountain Rock in honor of early-20th century wrestler Man Mountain Dean, his WWF character was considerably more upbeat and less gritty than the popular Maxx Payne character, and did not achieve the same success. Debuting in February 1995 on an episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, Man Mountain Rock played a large electric guitar shaped like the WWF logo. He would come to the ring during a commercial, with the arena going pitch black and ring announcer Manny Garcia saying \\"Ladies and Gentleman, Man Mountain Rock!\\" He would then play his \\"axe\\" (electric guitar) while pyro went off. He would frequently state, \\"If it's too loud, then you're too old!\\" Vince McMahon, then a commentator, would often comment that Rock \\"rocked the house\\". In the latter part of his WWF tenure, his music incurred the wrath of veteran Bob Backlund, then playing the part of a cantankerous heel crusading against the younger generation, who objected to the music Man Mountain Rock was playing. Man Mountain Rock had suffered several injuries during his amateur career, and had hoped to secure a backstage position with WCW. When he moved to the WWF, he asked to be made an announcer, but his request was denied. His career in the WWF met with several disruptions, including a serious hernia, an addiction to pain pills and downers and a marijuana habit, which ultimately led to his release in October 1995. While working for the WWF, Peterson filmed several hours of behind-the- scenes footage with a video camera which he often carried. He often claimed that he would release a documentary called The Thing that Should Not Be or The Real Maxx Payne based on the footage, but never did. The footage reportedly contained scenes showing substance abuse and solicitation. =Max Payne lawsuit= In July 2003 Peterson filed a $10 million lawsuit in the United States district court for Utah against Rockstar Games, 3D Realms, Gathering of Developers, and Remedy Entertainment. Peterson accused them of stealing his ring name Maxx Payne and his neo-noir theme for the protagonist of the video game Max Payne. The case was settled out of court. =Retirement= On April 17, 2004, Peterson addressed an audience in the Schubert Theater at the Western States College for the Performing Arts in Gooding, Idaho, talking about professional wrestling. Peterson continues to be involved in film projects.

Sequence transformations include linear mappings such as convolution with another sequence, and resummation of a sequence and, more generally, are commonly used for series acceleration, that is, for improving the rate of convergence of a slowly convergent sequence or series. Sequence transformations are also commonly used to compute the antilimit of a divergent series numerically, and are used in conjunction with extrapolation methods. Overview Classical examples for sequence transformations include the binomial transform, M√∂bius transform, Stirling transform and others. Definitions For a given sequence :S=\\\\\\\\{ s_n \\\\\\\\}_{n\\\\in\\\\N},\\\\, the transformed sequence is :\\\\mathbf{T}(S)=S'=\\\\\\\\{ s'_n \\\\\\\\}_{n\\\\in\\\\N},\\\\, where the members of the transformed sequence are usually computed from some finite number of members of the original sequence, i.e. :s_n' = T(s_n,s_{n+1},\\\\dots,s_{n+k}) for some k which often depends on n (cf. e.g. Binomial transform). In the simplest case, the s_n and the s'_n are real or complex numbers. More generally, they may be elements of some vector space or algebra. In the context of acceleration of convergence, the transformed sequence is said to converge faster than the original sequence if :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{s'_n-\\\\ell}{s_n-\\\\ell} = 0 where \\\\ell is the limit of S, assumed to be convergent. In this case, convergence acceleration is obtained. If the original sequence is divergent, the sequence transformation acts as extrapolation method to the antilimit \\\\ell. If the mapping T is linear in each of its arguments, i.e., for :s'_n=\\\\sum_{m=0}^{k} c_m s_{n+m} for some constants c_0,\\\\dots,c_k (which may depend on n), the sequence transformation \\\\mathbf{T} is called a linear sequence transformation. Sequence transformations that are not linear are called nonlinear sequence transformations. Examples Simplest examples of (linear) sequence transformations include shifting all elements, s'_n = s_{n+k} (resp. = 0 if n + k < 0) for a fixed k, and scalar multiplication of the sequence. A little less trivial generalization would be the discrete convolution with a fixed sequence. A particularly basic form is the difference operator, which is convolution with the sequence (-1,1,0,\\\\ldots), and is a discrete analog of the derivative. The binomial transform is another linear transformation of a still more general type. An example of a nonlinear sequence transformation is Aitken's delta-squared process, used to improve the rate of convergence of a slowly convergent sequence. An extended form of this is the Shanks transformation. The M√∂bius transform is also a nonlinear transformation, only possible for integer sequences.

Life  Educated at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels (1859‚Äì1868), van der Stappen's contribution to the Brussels Salon was \\"The Faun's Toilet\\" of 1869, and thereafter he began to produce work of a high and novel order in every class of sculpture, and soon, along with Paul de Vigne, became recognized as the leader of the section of the new Belgian school of sculpture which infused models derived from Greek and Roman models and the art of the Italian Renaissance with naturalistic detail and fleeting action. His best-known funeral monuments are those to Alexandre Gendebien (1874) and Baron Coppens, at Sheel (1875). His statues include William the Silent, set up at the Petit Sablon Square, and two in the Brussels Museum, The Man with the Sword, and \\"The Sphinx\\". The bronze group Ompdrailles was acquired by the Belgian government (1892). In 1893 the sculptor began his collaboration with Constantin Meunier for the elaborate decoration of the Botanical Garden of Brussels, coordinating many other sculptors for the production of some 52 sculptures for its grounds. The result of the connection may be seen in the group The Builders of Cities which is strongly imbued with the feeling and types of Meunier's sympathetic figures of workers. Among his students were Ilse Twardowski-Conrat, Helene Zelezny-Scholz, Rik Wouters, Paul Du Bois, and Victor Rousseau, who would succeed him as director of the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts.

It became famous for sanctity and learning, but suffered from raids of natives and foreigners, especially during the 14th century. History The School of Mayo was situated in Mayo, County Mayo, almost equidistant from the towns of Claremorris and Castlebar. The founder, St. Colman, who flourished about the middle of the seventh century, was in all probability a native of the West of Ireland, and made his ecclesiastical studies at Iona during the abbacy of the renowned Segenius. After the death of Finan, the second Bishop of Lindisfarne, Colman was appointed to succeed him. His episcopate was much disturbed by a fierce renewal of the Easter Controversy. Colman vigorously advocated the old Irish custom, and cited the example of his predecessors, but all to no effect. At a synod specially summoned to meet at Whitby in 664, the Roman method of calculation triumphed, and Colman, unwilling to abandon the practice of the \\"holy elders of the Irish Church\\", resolved to quit Lindisfarne forever.Grattan-Flood, William. \\"St. Colman.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 4.

These things are clearly set out in the \\"Historia Ecclesiastica\\" of Bede, who then proceeds to describe how they led to the founding of the great school of Mayo. \\"Colman, the Irish Bishop\\", says Bede, \\"departed from Britain and took with him all the Irish that he had assembled in the Island of Lindisfarne, and also about thirty of the English nation who had been instructed in the monastic life. . . .Afterwards he retired to a small island which is to the west of Ireland, and at some distance from the coast, called in the language of the Irish, Inishbofinde [island of the white cow]. Arriving there he built a monastery, and placed in it the monks he brought with him of both nations\\". It appears, however, the Irish and English monks could not agree. Then Colman sought to put an end to their dissensions, and travelling about at length found a place in Ireland fit to build a monastery, which in the language of the Irish is called Magh Eo (Mayo).The Heritage of Mayo by √Åine N√≠ Chean√°inn 3rd edition 1988, p. 94 Later on we are told by the same historian that this monastery became an important and flourishing institution, and even an episcopal see.\\"History\\", Catholic Archdiocese of Tuam Though Colman, we may assume, lived mainly with his own countrymen at Inishbofin, he took a deep and practical interest in his new foundation at Mayo‚Äî\\"Mayo of the Saxons\\", as it came to be called. In the year 670, with his consent, its first canonical abbot was appointed. This was Gerald, the son of a northern English king, who, annoyed at the way Colman's most cherished convictions had been slighted at Whitby, resolved to follow him to Ireland. The school gained greatly in fame for sanctity and learning under this youthful abbot. About 679 Adamnan, the illustrious biographer of Columba, visited Mayo and according to some writers, ruled there for seven years after Gerald's death. This latter statement is not, on the face of it, improbable if Gerald, as Colgan thinks, did not live after 697; but the Four Masters give the date of his death as 13 March, 726, and the \\"Annals of Ulster\\" put the event as late as 731. After Gerald's death there are only the record of isolated facts concerning the school he ruled so wisely and loved so well, but they are often facts of considerable interest and importance. The monastery was burned due to a lightning strike in 783,Healy, John. Insula sanctorum et doctorum, Benzinger, 1902, p. 538 It burned again in 808; also‚Äîbut only in the old \\"Life of St. Gerald\\" ‚Äîthat it was plundered by Turgesius the Dane in 818. That the monastic grounds were regarded as exceptionally holy we can gather from the entry that Domhnall, son of Torlough O'Conor, Lord of North Connacht, \\"the glory and the moderator and the good adviser of the Irish people\\" (d. 1176), was interred therein. That it had the status of an episcopal see long after the Synod of Kells (1152), is clear from the entry under the date of 1209, recording the death of \\"Cele O'Duffy, Bishop of Magh Eo of the Saxons.\\"Healy, John. \\"School of Mayo.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 24 January 2020 Mayo, like the other ancient Irish monastic schools, suffered from the raids of native and foreigner, especially during the fourteenth century. But it survived them all, for the death under date 1478 is recorded of a bishop‚Äî\\"Bishop Higgens of Mayo of the Saxons\\". The time at which the See of Mayo, on the ground that it contained not a cathedral but a parochial church, was annexed to Tuam, cannot with certainty be ascertained, but as far back as 1217, during the reign of Honorius III, the question was before the Roman authorities for discussion. It was probably not settled definitively for centuries after. James O'Healy, \\"Bishop of Mayo of the Saxons\\", was put to death for the Catholic Faith at Kilmallock in 1579.

The present Bugis Street, developed from New Bugis Street. Bugis (Kampong Bugis in Malay) is an area in Singapore that covers Bugis Street now located within the Bugis Junction shopping mall. Bugis Street was renowned internationally from the 1950s to the 1980s for its nightly gathering of transvestites and transsexuals, a phenomenon that made it one of Singapore's most notable destinations for foreign visitors during that period. In the mid-1980s, Bugis Street underwent major urban redevelopment into a retail complex of modern shopping malls, restaurants and nightspots mixed with regulated back-alley roadside vendors. Underground digging to construct the Bugis MRT station prior to that also caused the upheaval and termination of the nightly transgender sex bazaar culture, marking the end of a colourful and unique era in Singapore's history. Today, the original Bugis Street is now a cobblestoned, relatively wide avenue sandwiched between the buildings of the Bugis Junction shopping complex. On the other hand, the lane presently touted as \\"Bugis Street\\" by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board is actually developed from New Bugis Street, formerly Albert Street, and is billed as \\"the largest street-shopping location in Singapore\\". An attempt by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board to bring back the former exotic atmosphere was unsuccessful. Although the street is now not a well-known tourist destination, it is frequented by many Singaporeans.  History  South Sulawesi province in Indonesia, home of the Bugis or Buginese people ‚Äì expert sailors who put their skills to good use in the past. Bugis Street lies in an extensive area which was commonly referred to in the past, by the Chinese-educated community, as Xiao Po (Â∞èÂù°; 'little slope'). The latter stretched all the way from Tanjong Pagar, through Singapore's Chinatown, to Jalan Sultan. Its length was thriving and crammed with merchants and traders, making it one of the most vibrant economic zones of old Singapore. = Pre-1950s = Pre-war shophouses, Bugis's Tan Quee Lan Street Before the arrival of the British, there used to be a large canal which ran through the area where the Bugis, a seafaring people from South Sulawesi province in Indonesia, could sail up, moor their boats and trade with Singaporean merchants. It was these people after whom the thoroughfare was named. The Bugis, or Buginese, also put their sailing skills to less benign uses and gained a reputation in the region as pirates. During the early colonial era, there also used to be low mounds of whitish sand in the area, earning the street the familiar Hokkien (Min Nan) moniker of Peh Soa Pu or Bai Sha Fu in Mandarin (ÁôΩÊ≤ôÊµÆ; 'white sand mounds'). The Cantonese, however, referred to the street as Hak Gaai or Hei Jie in Mandarin (ÈªëË°ó; 'black street') as there were many clubs catering to the Japanese invaders in the 1940s. During the first half of the 20th century, commuters could travel from Bugis Street to anywhere else in Xiao Po via a tram service which ran along North Bridge Road, which was referred to by the Chinese-educated as Xiao Po Da Ma Lu (Â∞èÂù°Â§ßÈ©¨Ë∑Ø; 'little slope main road'). North Bridge Road and Bugis Junction, February 2019 Prior to the second world war, Bugis had a high proportion of Japanese prostitutes; Karayuki-san. At its peak, there were 633 Karauki-san to 109 brothels, with a high concentration within the area of Bugis Street, Malabar Street, and Hylam Street. Due to the lack of space in the early-style, two storey, shophouse, overcrowding and hygiene issues became problematic. With many people using the same latrines and drinking water sources, disease spread with a cholera outbreak occurring in Bugis, Malabar, and Hylam Streets. This led to them being zoned off. The bad hygiene and poor ventilation due to overcrowding of the sites led to the Singapore Improvement Trust trying to demolish those buildings and rebuild. This led to the infamous \\"Bugis Street Case\\" which over the course of multiple courts decisions, decided that it was not legal to commandeer a building and only pay the price of the land, which had been going on previously and the decision was made by 1937, that new houses should be built to alleviate overcrowding and problems that are associated instead of tearing it down and rebuilding, expecting change to occur. This established a new form of slum clearance in Singapore that was more closely tied to the rights of the citizen and the owner. = 1950s‚Äì1980s = Intersection of North Bridge Road and Rochor Road After World War II, hawkers gathered there to sell food and goods. There was initially also a small number of outdoor bars set up beside rat-infested drains. When transvestites began to rendezvous in the area in the 1950s, they attracted increasing numbers of Western tourists who came for the booze, the food, the pasar malam shopping and the \\"girls\\". Business boomed and Bugis Street became a lively and bustling area, forming the heart of Xiao Po. It was one of Singapore's most famous tourist meccas from the 1950s to the 1980s, renowned internationally for its nightly parade of flamboyantly-dressed transvestites and it attracted hordes of Caucasian gawkers who had never before witnessed Asian queens in full regalia. The latter would tease, cajole, and sit on visitors' laps or pose for photographs for a fee. Others would sashay up and down the street looking to hook half-drunk sailors, American GIs, and other foreigners for an hour of profitable intimacy. Not only would these clients get the thrill of sex with an exotic oriental, there would be the added spice of transgressing gender boundaries in a seamy hovel. There was an adage amongst Westerners that one could easily tell who was a real female and who was not: the transvestites were drop-dead gorgeous, while the rest were real women. The amount of revenue that the transvestites of Bugis Street raked in was considerable, providing a booster shot in the arm for the tourism industry. The street was popularly called Boogie Street by British servicemen. Veterans recall that the notorious drinking section began from Victoria Street west to Queen Street. Halfway between Victoria and Queen Streets, there was an intersecting lane parallel to the main roads, also lined with al fresco bars. There was a well-patronised public toilet with a flat roof of which there are archival photos, complete with jubilant rooftop transvestites. One of the \\"hallowed traditions\\" bestowed upon the area by sojourning sailors (usually from Britain, Australia, and New Zealand), was the ritualistic \\"dance of the flaming arseholes\\" on top of the toilet's roof. Compatriots on the ground would chant the signature \\"Haul 'em down you Zulu warrior\\" song whilst the sailors performed their act. Over the years this became almost a mandatory exercise and although it may seem to many to be a gross act of indecency, it was generally well received by the sometimes up to hundreds of tourists and locals. The Kai Tais or Beanie Boys, as the transvestites were referred to by Anglophone white visitors, certainly did not mind either. By the mid-1970s Singapore started a crackdown on this type of lewd behaviour and sailors were arrested at gunpoint by the local authorities for upholding the tradition. By this time those sailors brave enough to try it were dealt with severely and even shipped home in disgrace. Though many locals accepted this part of Singaporean culture, many conservative Singaporeans felt that it was a disgrace and it defaced Singapore's image. While many were concerned about the public image and embarrassment that went along with it, the global concern of HIV/AIDS became more prevalent, a growing suspicion of the activities that took place. The HIV scare in Singapore can draw parallels with the English syphilis scare. Bugis Street was demolished as a way of not only controlling the population to become more orderly and normative, but also to prevent an HIV epidemic. With fears also being present that through homosexuality, the society and culture would denigrate and would limit the island's growth, especially post independence. By allowing a site like Bugis Street would go against the idea of Singapore's nuclear family and is, therefore, \\"othered\\" this othering scares the Singaporean authorities as it can be seen as dissenting. By using an HIV scare and the economic benefits of inserting an MRT station and eventually a mall, the amount of resistance from most Singaporeans would be minimal. The earliest published description of Bugis Street found by Yawning Bread as a place of great gender diversity was in the book \\"Eastern Windows\\" by F.D. Ommaney, 1960.Ommaney, F.D, Eastern Windows, 1960. London:Longmans. pp. 39‚Äì45 Ommaney did not date specifically his description of the street but his book made clear that he was in Singapore from 1955 to 1960. A first-person account of Bugis Street in the 1950s is by \\"Bob\\", a visiting Australian sailor is given here. Bugis Junction Towers In the mid-1980s, Bugis Street underwent major urban redevelopment into a retail complex of modern shopping malls, restaurants and nightspots mixed with regulated back-alley roadside vendors. Underground digging to construct the Bugis MRT station prior to that also caused the upheaval and termination of the nightly transgender sex bazaar culture, marking the end of a colourful and unique era in Singapore's history. Tourist and local lamentation of the loss sparked attempts by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB) to attempt to recreate some of the old sleazy splendour by staging contrived \\"Ah Qua shows\\" on wooden platforms, but these artificial performances fell flat on their faces and failed to pull in the crowds. They were abandoned after a short time. = The movie = The trans women of Bugis Street were immortalised in an English-language film made by a Hong Kong film company which did employ some local talent in its production.Finding Love Along Bugis Street  Discussion with director and cast  http://popspoken.com/screen/2015/11/sgiff- bugisstreetredux(For more details, see Bugis Street (Film) and Singapore gay films: Bugis Street).  Features  The fame of the original Bugis Street has spawned many namesakes eager to capitalise on the brand, even though many tourists, as well as some young Singaporeans, have no inkling as to the reasons for its erstwhile \\"glamour\\". This has been inherited to the Bugis Junction, Bugis+ and Bugis MRT station. The original Bugis Street became part of the Bugis Village, where shops such as Alice, RUSH, Covet and NAVI are also there, it also inherits the same style as Far East Plaza. This cacophony of Bugis'es clamouring for a spot in the limelight, reminiscent of the trans women who gave the original its glory, leads to great confusion when trying to locate Bugis Street itself. = Queen Street Bus Terminal = Queen Street Bus Terminal also known as Ban San Bus Terminal, is a bus terminal in Singapore.

The word is a portmanteau of the words thin and insulate, trademarked by 3M.\\"Uspto Issues Trademark: Thinsulate.\\" US Fed News Service, Including US State News. The Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd. 2017. HighBeam Research. 13 Sep. 2018 . The material is made by the 3M Corporation and was first sold in 1979. It was originally marketed as an inexpensive alternative to down; at the time, 3M claimed it was twice as warm as an equivalent amount of any natural material. Originally designed for clothing, it later became popular as an acoustic damping material. In 1997, 3M generated $150 million in annual revenue from the product.Fiedler, Terry. \\"The quiet Thinsulate; 3M again capitalizes on both name, performance with brand extensions.(BUSINESS).\\" Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN). The Star Tribune Company. 1997. HighBeam Research. 13 Sep. 2018 . Its development originated from other microfibre products made by 3M. It has been used in US army clothing since the mid 1980s.  Description  Thinsulate fibers are about in diameter,Phil Gibson and Calvin Lee; Application Of Nanofiber Technology To Nonwoven Thermal Insulation, 01 NOV 2006, U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center Natick, Massachusetts 01760-5020. which is thinner than the polyester fibers normally used in insulation for clothing such as gloves or winter jackets. Advertising material suggests that Thinsulate is more effective due to the increased density of fibers with decreased size of fibers compared with more traditional insulation. Like most insulation materials, the gaps between fibers not only reduce heat flow, but also allow moisture to escape. The insulation properties are beneficial for retaining some of the heat produced by the body for comfortable warmth while the moisture produced, most likely sweat, is supposed to evaporate.\\"Know the material.\\" Telegraph - Herald (Dubuque). Telegraph Herald. 2008. HighBeam Research. 13 Sep. 2018 . It retains its insulating properties when wet. The thermal resistance R-value provided by Thinsulate products varies by the specific thickness and construction of the fabric. Values (US units) range from 1.6 for 80-gram fabric to 2.9 for 200-gram fabric. Thinsulate is considered \\"the warmest thin apparel insulation\\" available. In fact, when equal thicknesses are compared, it provides about 1¬Ω times the warmth of down and about twice the warmth of other high-loft insulation materials. Material safety data sheets from the manufacturer show that different varieties of Thinsulate are made from different mixtures of polymers, but most are primarily polyethylene terephthalate or a mixture of polyethylene terephthalate and polypropylene. Other materials in some include polyethylene terephthalate-polyethylene isophthalate copolymer and acrylic. Thinsulate is now used in the fabric roof of the convertible automobile, the Porsche Boxster. The extra layer not only reduces heat loss but has also reduced noise levels inside the car by 3 decibels. It is also used in the roof of the Jaguar F-Type sports car. It features in the upholstery of Saturn sedans, Ford F-150 pickups, Buick Park Avenues, and F-16 fighters. It is used in a wide variety of clothing products, such as footwear, gloves, hats, and coats. It became popular in outerwear jackets as early as 1985.Lebow, Joan. \\"Wool spurs rebound in coat action.\\" WWD. Conde Nast Publications, Inc. 1986. HighBeam Research. 13 Sep. 2018 . (According to a spokesman for 3M Co., which produces Thinsulate, more than 30 fashion coat companies are using Thinsulate linings in their garments this year, 22 more than last year. Among the manufacturers testing the Thinsulate are several designer-price lines including Anne Klein Coats, George Simonton, Ilie Wacs and Nipon Coature. ... At Anne Klein Coats, Marty Blank, president, said the firm will use Thinsulate in 20 to 40 percent of its line, and particularly with lighter-weight fabrics.) The fibers are thinner in diameter than polyester fibres, so the material is used as a waterproof synthetic alternative to down. In 2015 Thinsulate was named a recipient of an ISPO Award as a Top 10 Insulation.

As the company grew it expanded production to include electric guitars, bass guitars, amplifiers, and accessories to become one of the biggest guitar manufacturers in Japan. Fernandes also owns Burny, a brand for Gibson replicas.  Overview  Despite its high production figures, Fernandes is better known in the United States for its Sustainer system, which uses electromagnetism to vibrate a string for an extended period, so long as the user continues to fret a note. Unlike the similar manual E-Bow sustainer, the Fernandes Sustainer can be used with a standard plectrum, because the sustainer is imbedded in the body of guitar. Fernandes' custom shop has installed numerous Sustainers into guitars built by other manufacturers. Fernandes continued to manufacture guitars, that cover the range from inexpensive starter models to custom instruments. In 2000, Fernandes made a guitar to promote the video game UmJammer Lammy, similar to Lammy's guitars.  Musicians using Fernandes  * Robert Trujillo of Metallica has been seen using a variety of Fernandes basses, mainly 5-string neck-thru types appearing to be based on the \\"Gravity Deluxe\\" production model. Allegedly, Rob's personally owned Fernandes basses were custom made by either the Fernandes North Hollywood and/or Japanese custom shops. The specifications and complete history of Rob's personally owned and stage-played Fernandes basses by most accounts is still a mystery. * Brad Gillis of American rock band Night Ranger and former Ozzy Osbourne guitarist had his own Stratocaster-type model that was red with a black pick guard. Gillis still uses his Fernandes guitar as his main guitar when he performs in concert with Night Ranger. * Billie Joe Armstrong of American punk rock band Green Day had a Stratocaster since he was 10 named \\"Blue\\" from his mother, and has played it live for nearly every show he has played, near exclusively used for all songs in Eb tuning. * The Edge of U2 has started using a Retro Rocket and Native Pro guitar with Sustainer to play With or Without You when playing live. * Heath of Japanese heavy metal band X Japan uses his signature Fernandes model FJB-115H bass guitar almost exclusively. Previously he used several Burny guitars, including his signature model DB-85H. * hide of Japanese heavy metal band X Japan used Fernandes guitars almost exclusively.

The series presented both comedy and drama in original teleplays, as well as abridged adaptations of films and plays. Overview The Lux Video Theatre was a spin-off from the successful Lux Radio Theater series broadcast on the NBC Blue Network (1934-1935) and CBS (1935‚Äì55). Lux Video Theatre began as a live 30-minute Monday evening CBS series on October 2, 1950, switching to Thursday nights during August, 1951. (PDF) In September 1953, the show relocated from New York to Hollywood. In August 1954, it moved to NBC as an hour-long show on Thursday nights, telecast until September 12, 1957. With the introduction of the one-hour format and the move to Hollywood, abridged versions of popular films were often used as the basis for shows. To introduce each act and interview the stars at the conclusion, NBC added a series of regular hosts: James Mason (1954‚Äì55), Otto Kruger (1955‚Äì56), Gordon MacRae (1956‚Äì57) and Ken Carpenter (1955-57). Kruger recalled: :All I do is come up and tell the people who I am and what we're up to. I don't have a single thing to do with producing, directing or casting the show. Yet I get letters every week complimenting me on my production, my directing, my casting, even my script adaptations.Becker, Christine.

Avildsen and starring Tommy Chong and Cheech Marin as two hippies, and additionally as Arab businessmen Mr. Slyman and Prince Habib. Plot Cheech and Chong are driving a limo through the desert. Chong, who has decided to stop doing drugs for a while, is talking about rock and roll, and Cheech is falling asleep, but Cheech is narrating over what's happening. He says that \\"things are tough all over\\" and that he's going to tell their story. It's an awful winter in Chicago, and Cheech and Chong are poor, struggling musicians working at a car wash owned by a pair of oil-rich Arabs, Mr. Slyman and Prince Habib. After messing up on the job, the 2 are forced by the Arabs to work and play music at their club. Cheech and Chong also try to get with the Arabs' French girlfriends, who are more in love with the stoners. The Arabs find themselves with a large sum of illegal money, which they try to get to their other business in Las Vegas. They decide to stash all the money in the seats of a limousine. The Arabs hire the stoners to drive the limousine to Las Vegas, telling them that they're sending them on a \\"rock tour.\\" Cheech and Chong at first get gas in Chicago, but when they reveal they're strapped for cash, the man at the gas station takes a piece of the car as payment. With that idea, Cheech and Chong find themselves driving across the country, selling parts and pieces of the car for gas, food, and supplies. Soon, their car becomes a wreck and looks messed up, but Cheech and Chong continue to sell parts to get by. While out in the middle of the deserts, they decide to pick up a hitchhiker, who turns out to be none other than Donna, Cheech's girlfriend. The two decide to take Donna in their messed-up limo to the nearest gas station. However, Donna is traveling with dozens of Mexicans, so the stoners end up driving all the Mexicans and Donna to the nearest gas station. To pay for gas, Cheech and Chong give the old man that runs the place a chair from the limo‚Äîwhich unknown to them is stuffed with the Arab's money. Cheech and Chong deliver the messed-up limousine to the Arabs' other oil plant in the desert, to find no one there. With no other transportation or money, Cheech and Chong set out on foot into the desert. They wander into the burning deserts, suffering the Nevada heat, and trying to get cars to stop- they remain unsuccessful. Eating peyote to survive and singing to pass the time, Cheech and Chong do their best to get through the desert, though they believe they'll die from the heat. Back in Chicago, the Arabs find out that Cheech and Chong have delivered what remains of the car without any money in it. After deciding to kill them, the Arabs fly out to Nevada in their private plane and set out by car into the desert. The Arabs meet the old man at the gas station and learn that Cheech and Chong have been around, and set out into the deserts; their car breaks down, leaving the Arabs to wander through the Nevada deserts and get lost. Meanwhile, while walking through the desert, Cheech and Chong are picked up by the Arab's French girlfriends, who take them to an abandoned motel in the middle of the desert. The French girlfriends have sex with the stoners, and are (unknown to them) on a hidden camera film. Afterwards, the French ladies leave in their car, leaving the stoners stranded in the middle of nowhere yet again. Meanwhile, the Arabs are having the same problem, looking for Cheech and Chong in the middle of the desert, having no idea where to go. Cheech and Chong wander through the desert again until they're picked up again, this time by comedian Rip Taylor, whose puns and props make Chong cry. The comedian drives the two into Las Vegas and drops them off at a restaurant, and has them dressed up as women to cover up their rags. Cheech and Chong start to dine at the restaurant, before the Arabs show up for dinner as well, having escaped the desert. Before they can eat, all the peyote Chong consumed begins to mess with his mind. Chong becomes emotional and confused, and when the Arabs begin to notice, the stoners try to escape. However, their wigs fall off, and the Arabs realize it's Cheech and Chong. The Arabs chase the stoners out of the restaurant and through the streets of Vegas. Cheech and Chong run into a women's-only porno theater with the murder- happy Arabs on their tail. In the theater, the Arabs see the showing of the hidden camera film of the stoners having sex with the Arabs' girlfriends. While the Arabs watch, inspired, Cheech and Chong escape. The stoners ditch the women's clothes and set out on foot to leave Las Vegas. The next day, as Cheech and Chong walk out of the city, a car pulls up, and Cheech and Chong get in, to find the Arabs and their French girlfriends. At first, Cheech and Chong are terrified and try to escape, but Mr. Slyman reveals that, instead of killing them, the Arabs have decided to cast the duo in porn films and launder the money through the enterprise. A happy ending, with a narrating Cheech reminding us that \\"hey, things are tough all over.\\" CastReception Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, \\"Cheech and Chong have a good time in 'Things Are Tough All Over,' and you will, too.\\" Variety called the film \\"a painful and pallid affair which reminds of the tired, late-career efforts of Abbott & Costello.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Things Are Tough All Over\\".

It is spoken by over 700,000 people and takes its name from the Kusasi people, who form the majority of the population of the area in the far northeast of Ghana, between the Gambaga escarpment, the Red Volta, and the national borders with Togo and Burkina Faso. There are some villages of Kusaasi in Burkina and also a few speakers in Togo. Kusaal is closely related to Mampruli, the language of the Mamprussi, who live to the south, and to Dagbani. There is a major dialect division between Agole, to the east of the White Volta river, and Toende, to the West. Agole has more speakers, and the only large town of the district, Bawku, is in Agole. The New Testament translation is in the Agole dialect. Grammar The language is a fairly typical representative of the Western Oti‚ÄìVolta low-level grouping within Gur, which includes several of the more widely spoken languages of Northern Ghana, and also Moore, the largest African language of Burkina Faso (and the largest of all Gur languages, with millions of speakers). =Nouns= Like most other Western Oti‚ÄìVolta languages, it has lost the complicated noun class agreement system still found in e.g. the more distantly related Gurmanche, and has only a natural gender system, human/non-human. The noun classes are still distinguishable in the way nouns distinguish singular from plural by paired suffixes: nid(a) \\"person\\" plural nidib(a) buug(a) \\"goat\\" plural buus(e) nobir(e) \\"leg, foot\\" plural noba(a) fuug(o) \\"item of clothing\\" plural fuud(e) molif(o) \\"gazelle\\" plural moli(i) A unpaired suffix -m(m) is found with many uncountable and abstract nouns, e.g. ku'om(m) \\"water\\" The bracketed final vowels in the examples occur because of the feature which most strikingly separates Kusaal from its close relatives: the underlying forms of words, such as buuga \\"goat\\" are found only when the word in question is the last word in a question or a negated statement. In all other contexts an underlying final short vowel is dropped and a final long vowel is shortened: Fu daa nye buug la. \\"You saw the goat.\\" Fu daa nye buug. \\"You saw a goat.\\" Fu daa pu nye buuga. \\"You didn't see a goat.\\" Ano'one daa nye buuga? \\"Who saw a goat?\\" =Adjectives= Kusaal shows the typical Gur feature whereby the noun and adjective stems are compounded in that order, followed by the singular/plural endings: bupielig(a) \\"white goat\\" [ bu-(g(a)) + piel- + -g(a) ] bupielis(e) \\"white goats\\" There are a few traces of the old system (as in Gurmanche) whereby the adjective took the singular/plural endings appropriate to the class of the preceding noun, but the system is completely unproductive in Kusaal now. =Verbs= Verbal flexion is agreeably simple, as in other Western Oti‚ÄìVolta languages and unlike less closely related Gur languages. Most verbs have five flexional forms (a) no ending, used for perfective aspect: M gos buug la. \\"I've looked at the goat.\\" (b) -d(a) ending, for imperfective: M gosid buug la. \\"I look at the goat.\\" (c) -m(a) for positive imperative: Gosim buug la! \\"Look at the goat!\\" (d) -in subjunctive for irrealis : Fu ya'a gosin ... \\"If you were to look (but you won't) ...\\" (e) -b(o), -g(o), -r(e) gerund, verbal noun : o gosig la mor dabiem \\"his (the angel's) appearance was scary\\" [Judges 13:6 draft] - literally 'his seeing they had fear' Some 10% of verbs, with stative meanings, have only a single form. The verb is preceded by a chain of invariable particles expressing tense, polarity and mood. Serial verb constructions are common and important, as in many West African languages. =Pronouns= Object pronouns can be severely reduced in form by the Kusaal final-vowel-loss rules, surfacing as single consonants, or even zero; they are preceded by a reduced vowel ending the previous word, which is a reduced form of that word's own underlying final vowel, preserved before the enclitic pronoun: M boodi f. \\"I love you.\\" traditionally written M bood if. M boodu. \\"I love him/her.\\" traditionally written M bood o. =Syntax= Word order is strictly SVO, but clefting is common. Within the noun phrase, except for the typical noun-adjective Gur compounding, the rule is that associative modifier (possessive, genitive) precedes the head: m buug \\"my goat\\" buug la nobir \\"the goat's foot\\" (la \\"the\\", follows its noun) Numeral and deictics (demonstrative, article) follow, with the quantitative in final place: m buus atan' la wusa \\"all my three goats\\" Phonology The sound system of Kusaal is similar to that of its relatives; consonant clusters (except between adjacent words) occur only word-internally at morpheme-junctures, and are determined by the limited range of consonants which can appear in syllable-final position. Clusters arising from the addition of suffixes in derivation and flexion are either simplified or broken up by inserted (\\"svarabhakti\\") vowels. The roster of consonants includes the widespread West African labiovelar double-closure stops kp, gb, but the palatal series of the related languages (written ch/j in Dagbani and Hanga and ky/gy in Mampruli) fall in with the simple velars, as in neighbouring Farefare (Frafra, Gurene) and Moore. The reflexes of the palatal and labiovelar double- closure nasals of the related languages, [n] written ny and [≈ãm] ≈ãm - are probably best analysed as a nasalised y and w respectively, but the scope of the nasalisation and the order of its onset with respect to the semivowel is variable. The vowel system is not yet fully understood, complicated by differences between the Agole and Toende dialects and the system of diphthongs in Agole, which according to the most-favoured analysis, enables Agole with seven contrastive vowel segments to cover the contrasts represented in Toende with nine pure vowels. There are also lengthened or strengthened vowels 'broken' with a glottal stop bu'ud \\"beating\\" distinct from the glottal as a consonant, usually in ku'om \\"water\\". Glottal also marks some monosyllabic verbs bu' \\"beat\\". In addition some vowels are contrastively nasalised and others nasalised through the influence of nasal consonants. In the orthography a letter n followed by a vowel or glottal indicates that the preceding vowel is contrastively nasalised, unless in word-final position when nasalisation is indicated by a double nn and a single n is a final consonant. The language is tonal, with tonal differences distinguishing lexical items (with few minimal pairs) and syntactic constructions. The intrinsic tones of individual words are often overridden with a different pattern in particular syntactic constructions, e.g. main verbs in positive main clauses become all-low-tone. Many words also cause tone changes in closely connected following or preceding words by \\"tone spreading\\". The tonal system is a terracing system with two tones and emic downsteps, but with the H! sequence being realized as extra- high in some contexts. The domain of tone is the vowel mora, but there are many constraints on the possible tone patterns with a word; uncompounded nouns show only 4 different overall possibilities at most for any given segmental shape, and inflecting verbs have only two possible intrinsic tone patterns. Orthography The orthography used above is basically that of the New Testament translation, which remained the only substantial written work available in Kusaal for a long time. The New Testament orthography, however, spells \\"goat\\" boog, and the vowel is intermediate between u and o, phonetic . It is adequate for mother-tongue speakers but does not suffice to distinguish the seven distinct vowel qualities of Agole Kusaal, does not mark tone, and has partly inconsistent word-division conventions due to the complications produced by the Kusaal final vowel loss/reduction phenomena.

Study Materials on Kusaal have gradually increased over the last few years. Some aids for learners were produced by the husband and wife Spratt team who pioneered the linguistic study of the language and may be obtainable from GILLBT (Ghana Institute of Linguistics, Literacy and Bible Translation) in Tamale, Ghana. Literacy materials, collections of folk stories and so forth have also been produced by GILLBT. There is also a simple dictionary compiled by David and Nancy Spratt from the same source.

Agaricus blazei, Agaricus brasiliensis or Agaricus rufotegulis) is a species of mushroom, commonly known as almond mushroom, mushroom of the sun, God's mushroom, mushroom of life, royal sun agaricus, jisongrong, or himematsutake (Chinese: , Japanese: , \\"princess matsutake\\") and by a number of other names. Agaricus subrufescens is edible, with a somewhat sweet taste and a fragrance of almonds. Taxonomy Agaricus subrufescens was first described by the American botanist Charles Horton Peck in 1893. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it was cultivated for the table in the eastern United States. It was discovered again in Brazil during the 1970s, and misidentified as Agaricus blazei Murrill, a species originally described from Florida. It was soon marketed for its purported medicinal properties under various names, including ABM (for Agaricus blazei Murrill), cogumelo do sol (mushroom of the sun), cogumelo de Deus (mushroom of God), cogumelo de vida (mushroom of life), himematsutake, royal sun agaricus, Mandelpilz, and almond mushroom. In 2002, Didukh and Wasser correctly rejected the name A. blazei for this species, but unfortunately called the Brazilian fungus A. brasiliensis, a name that had already been used for a different species, Agaricus brasiliensis Fr. (1830). Richard Kerrigan undertook genetic and interfertility testing on several fungal strains, and showed that samples of the Brazilian strains called A. blazei and A. brasiliensis were genetically similar to, and interfertile with, North American populations of Agaricus subrufescens. These tests also found European samples called A. rufotegulis to be of the same species. Because A. subrufescens is the oldest name, it has taxonomical priority. Description The floccose stipe and annulus of A. subrufescens Initially, the cap is hemispherical, later becoming convex, with a diameter of . The cap surface is covered with silk-like fibers, although in maturity it develops small scales (squamulose). The color of the cap may range from white to grayish or dull reddish brown; the cap margin typically splits with age. The flesh of A. subrufescens is white, and has the taste of \\"green nuts\\", with the odor of almonds. The gills are not attached to the stalk (free), narrow, and crowded closely together. They start out whitish in color, then later pinkish, and finally black-brown as the spores mature. Spores are ellipsoid, smooth, dark purplish-brown when viewed microscopically, with dimensions of 6‚Äì7.5 by 4‚Äì5 Œºm. The stipe is by thick, and bulbous at the base. Initially solid, the stipe becomes hollow with age; it is cottony (floccose) to scaly toward the base. The annulus is abundant and double-layered; it is bent downward toward the stem, smooth and whitish on the upper side, and covered with cottony scales on the lower side. Agaricus subrufescens is edible, with a somewhat sweet taste and an almond aroma resulting from benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, benzonitrile, and methyl benzoate. Distribution and habitat Agaricus subrufescens forms fruit bodies singly or in clusters in leaf litter in rich soil, often in domestic habitats. Originally described from the northeastern United States and Canada, it has been found growing in California, Hawaii, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Philippines, Australia, and Brazil. Uses and safety concerns Used in traditional and alternative medicine for its supposed anti-cancer effects, Agaricus mushrooms have not been assessed by sufficient high-quality clinical research to define safety and biological properties upon consumption as a food, dietary supplement, or drug. Preliminary research indicates Agaricus products may have toxic effects on liver function by inhibition of P450 enzymes, especially in people with ovarian cancer, and may cause allergic reactions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warning letters to companies marketing Agaricus supplement products with unproven health claims of providing benefits to the immune system. A type of ergostane-type compounds called blazeispirols have been isolated from A. subrufescens.

Ratner's group beat out an ownership group led by Charles Kushner and former New Jersey governor Jon Corzine. Ratner relocated the Nets to New York City, specifically to build an arena in the Prospect Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn even though there was desire to keep them in New Jersey and strong neighborhood protests to keep them out of Brooklyn. Barclays Center is the centerpiece and the only completed piece of a $3.5 billion sports arena, business and residential complex in development called Pacific Park Brooklyn. This project is being built by Ratner's company, Forest City Ratner. The site of the arena is adjacent to the site that Walter O'Malley wanted to use for a new stadium for the Brooklyn Dodgers in the early 1950s. (O'Malley's plan was rejected by the city, resulting in the Dodgers relocating to Los Angeles in 1958.) On September 23, 2009, Russian tycoon Mikhail Prokhorov reached a deal with Ratner to purchase an 80% stake of the Nets for $200 million, subject to Ratner acquiring financing for the arena project and control of the land by the end of the year in addition to the approval of three-fourths of the NBA board of governors. According to Ratner, accepting Prokhorov as majority owner \\"gives us a partner who adds to the financial strength of the venture. Mikhail will have primary responsibility for the basketball part and we will have primary responsibility for the arena and the real estate.\\" On May 11, 2010, the sale of the Nets was approved by the NBA.http://www.insidehoops.com/prokhorov-buys-nets-051110.shtml Ratner originally planned to move the Nets across the Hudson River for the beginning of the 2009‚Äì10 NBA season. However, he had to revise his goal and moved the franchise to Brooklyn for the start of the 2012‚Äì13 season. Although the arena was scheduled to open in 2011, along with the rest of the complex, controversies involving the project's use of eminent domain and local residents, coupled with the lack of continued funding in a struggling economy, caused the project to be altered and delayed. On May 16, 2009, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division struck down an opponents' lawsuit that sought to prevent the state of New York from using eminent domain to seize the property where the Pacific Park Brooklyn project is being built. The opponents appealed the New York Supreme Court's ruling, but lost when the Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, upheld the right of the state to use eminent domain for this project. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on the site on March 11, 2010, but ringed with protests. The Nets began playing in Brooklyn in time for the 2012‚Äì13 NBA season. Board memberships Ratner serves on a number of boards including the Weill Cornell Medical College, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Lang Lang International Music Foundation, and the Museum of Jewish Heritage as chairman of its trustees board. He was chairman of the board and now chairman emeritus of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's board of trustees.

In 2005, the town had an estimated population of 50,000, and including the immediate suburbs within a radius of the total population is about 72,000. It is located on an inland plateau at an altitude of 628 m (2061 feet), and is west of Kingston. It is the only parish capital of Jamaica not located on the coast or on a major river. Mandeville has a town square, parish church and clock tower, and many large, elegant early nineteenth-century houses line the winding streets in the town centre. In the suburbs of the town many large houses have been built by returning residents from North America and the United Kingdom on an ad hoc basis. Developers have complemented these with large housing developments, some of which are constructed as gated communities. Prominent suburbs and surrounding areas include Ingleside, Battersea, Knockpatrick, Clover, Waltham, Bloomfield, Caledonia Meadows, Brumalia, Newport, Spur Tree, Kingsland, French Park, Swabys Hope, Lincoln, Greenvale and Marshalls Pen.

Many of the original buildings can still be seen such as the courthouse, an impressive building of cut limestone with a horseshoe staircase and a raised portico supported by Doric columns and built in 1820. The staircase was added in about 1900. Many of Jamaica's oldest businesses were started in Mandeville; the Mandeville Hotel, one of the oldest in the Caribbean, began operations in 1875. Its golf club, founded as the Manchester Golf Club in 1868, was the first golf course in the Caribbean. The first \\"free library\\" in Jamaica was established in 1938, and is the oldest Parish Library. The growth of the town was given a substantial stimulus when the Alcan Bauxite Company in a joint venture with the Jamaican Government opened its Kirkvine works nearby at Williamsfield in 1957. It built houses at Mandeville for its then mostly expatriate staff. The relatively high wages lured many educated Jamaicans there. Subsequently, the town has seen an influx of Jamaican residents returning from abroad.

The Oria river, the longest one in the province of Gipuzkoa, rises in several springs and their corresponding streams flowing down the dramatic slopes of the valley that merge in a main stream before the nucleus of the town. The southern Otzaurte hamlet (IPA: /o'tsaurte/) stands on the dividing line of the waters running onto the Mediterranean watershed and those flowing north to the Atlantic through the Oria river. The historic Way of St James, namely the stretch called the Tunnel Route, passes through the town, the municipality and the Park since the Middle Ages. Pilgrims exit the town heading south up the slopes, so reaching the San Adrian tunnel after 5 km, where backpackers and hikers may gain access to the plains of Alava, the Urbia fields or the summits of the rugged Aizkorri mountain range.

A Catalogue Raisonn√©\\", New Haven 2012, p. 1. Only 14 of his 133 works are dated.  Life  The pendant Woman Reading a Letter, (1665) (National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin) Gabriel Metsu was the son of Jacques Metsu (c. 1588 ‚Äì March 1629) a tapestry worker and painter originally from Hainault, who lived most of his days at Leiden, and Jacquemijntje Garniers (c. 1590 ‚Äì 8 September 1651), the widow of a painter with three children of her own. It is not known when and where Gabriel was baptized; most likely in a Catholic hidden church but the baptismal records did not survive. Gabriel grew up on Lange Mare and his stepfather, a skipper, must have supported his education, because his mother was a poor midwife. In 1648 Metsu was registered among the first members of the painters' guild at Leiden. In 1650 he ceased to subscribe. Metsu was possibly trained in Utrecht by the Catholic painters Nicolaus Kn√ºpfer and Jan Weenix.Waiboer, A. (2005) The early years of Gabri√´l Metsu. In: The Burlington Magazine, No. 1223, Vol. CXLVII, p.80-90. Around 1655 Metsu moved to Amsterdam; he lived in an alley on Prinsengracht, next to a brewery and near his relatives, the children of the sugar refiner Philips Metsu. In 1657 he got into an argument with a neighbor. (It was alleged that Metsu left a brothel at six in the morning.) Gabriel moved to a house on the canal side, where a daily vegetable market was held. In 1658 he married Isabella de Wolff,The Speed Art Museum has a portrait of Metsu and his wife. whose father was a potter and mother the painter Maria de Grebber. At the onset of the 1660s Metsu turned for inspiration to the art of the \\"fijnschilders\\" from his native Leiden. Metsu was responding to the market of Dou's paintings,Franits, W. (2008) Dutch seventeenth-century Genre Painting. Its stylistic and thematic evolution, p. 182. who sold his paintings all over for exorbitant prices. Metsu may have also influenced Pieter de Hooch. For a while Metsu trained Michiel van Musscher and Joost van Geel. Metsu died at the age of 38 and was buried in the Nieuwe Kerk. Three bells were tolled; a habit in use with Dutch Catholics at that time. His widow left for Enkhuizen, to live with her mother. Isabella was buried in the Zuiderkerk in 1718. Style and works An alley on Prinsengracht 369According to Stone-Ferrier, L. (1989), p. 448-452 it is where Metsu lived. close to where Metsu lived between number 351 and 353 The Sick Child According to Arnold Houbraken, Metsu was taught by Gerard Dou, though prior to about 1653 his influence is not apparent.Waiboer 2012, p. 11 Around 1653-4, Metsu began placing his figures in domestic interiors and specialized in genre scenes on small panels. Old people were among Metsu's favorite thematic borrowings from Dou during his first years in Amsterdam.Waiboer 2012, p. 25, 33. Metsu often painted young (single) women who either fed pets,Waiboer 2012, p. 110. sold goods at market (fruit, vegetables, fish, poultry, or meat), or were grocery-shopping themselves for these provisions.Gabriel Metzu biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Houbraken ends his biography with the comment that he was \\"of impeccable reputation\\", but he may have meant this ironically. Often, the subject of a Metsu painting was based on a popular emblem from an emblem book. This can give the painting a double meaning, such as in The Poultry seller, 1662, showing an old man offering a rooster to a young girl in a symbolic pose that is based on a lewd engraving by Gillis van Breen (1595‚Äì1622), with the same scene. The accompanying verse is: The Sick Child in Rijksmuseum from c. 1664 \\"prompts the thought that Metsu strongly admired Vermeer's work. [The latter's Woman with a Water Jug was sold as a Metsu in 1877.] It also provides us with a hint about what he thought was lacking in it: emotional involvement of the viewer\\".Waiboer 2012, p. 130. One of the finest collection of Metsu paintings was owned by Gerrit Braamcamp in the 18th century; he owned eight of them, including \\"man writing\\" and \\"woman reading a letter\\". Le Temple des Arts ou Le Cabinet de M. Braamcamp By Jean Fran√ßois de Bastide (1766), p. 56-57 =Carpets= At least thirteen of his paintings show carpets and he probably used the same model.Onno Ydema (1991) Carpets and their Datings in Netherlandish Paintings, 1540 - 1700, p. 31, 32. . He included several fine examples of minutely depicted floral and cloud band carpets in his works and even a silk oriental rug, as well as so-called \\"lotto\\" rugs which he for some reason, in contrast to his meticulous rendering of the floral carpets, depicted only in a very sketchy fashion.Onno Ydema (1991) Carpets and their Datings in Netherlandish Paintings, 1540 - 1700, p. 123.  Two paintings of the Hinlopen family  Around the year 1661, Metsu won the patronage of the Amsterdam cloth merchant Jan J. Hinlopen and painted his family more than once in a fashionable surrounding. There is still some confusion about two paintings by Metsu ‚Äî the Portrait of the family Hinlopen, now in the Gem√§ldegalerie, which for a few decades was referred to as The Family of burgomaster Gillis Valckenier, and Visit to the Nursery ‚Äî in the Metropolitan Museum. There is some general resemblance. The latter belonged to Jan J. Hinlopen. =Visit to the Nursery= In 1662 Jan Vos published a poem about this painting.Vos, J. (1662) p. 654. It might depict the Hinlopen family, but as the sitters have not been identified this painting it is more a genre work than a portrait. In 1721 Arnold Houbraken recalled the latter painting as the largest and finest work by Metsu he had ever seen.Houbraken 1718-1721, vol. 3, p. 41. Franits calls it one of his most intriguing images. What makes this painting especially interesting is its provenance. The provenance is well-known, except for between the years 1666 and 1706.Judith van Gent, p. 134-135, notes 20, 22. See also note 4 and check provenance. The \\"extraordinary pretty\\" painting was sold as no. 2 on 18 May 1706 bringing up 435 guilders; for most people in those days more than a year salary. In 1680, after the burial of his brother and guardian Jacob J. Hinlopen the paintings were divided in lots and given to his daughters RAU 67-59. Familiearchief Huydecoper, on 11/7/1679, 12/8/1679 and 2/22/1680. but none of the paintings or painters is mentioned. The scene is set in an imaginary room of unrealistically large proportions. The father gestures deferentially while a maid dutifully fetches a chair for this esteemed visitor.Franits, W. (2008) Dutch seventeenth-century Genre Painting. Its stylistic and thematic evolution, p. 183. The chimney resembles the one in the \\"schepenzaal\\" of former Amsterdam townhall, also painted by Pieter de Hooch.Os, H. van (2002) Beeldenstorm in het Paleis op de Dam, p. 28-33. There is a seascape on the wall and Persian carpets on the table and the floor.Liedtke, W. (2007) Dutch Paintings in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 463. The carpet on the table is divided into compartments, which are partly vermilion red and partly purple red, and shield-shaped. The dark blue color of the borders on the carpet are relatively unusual.Onno Ydema (1991) Carpets and their Datings in Netherlandish Paintings, 1540 - 1700, p. 74. The dog in the painting could be a Bolognese. Hung in the reception room of Hinlopen's home, the Visit to the Nursery thus alluded to his powerful role in local politics.

In later life, he became the Rosh Yeshiva of Bet El Yeshiva in the Old City of Jerusalem. His daughter married Rabbi Hayyim Abraham Gagin of Jerusalem, making him the great-great-grandfather of Shem Tob Gaguine, the \\"Keter Shem Tob.\\" His son was Yitzhak Mizrahi Sharabi and his grandson was Chief Rabbi Chaim Abraham Gagin. Biography Sar Shalom Sharabi was born in Jewish Sharab, Yemen. He moved to the Land of Israel, then under Ottoman rule, in fulfilment of a vow. On his way he stayed in India, Baghdad and Damascus. In Damascus, he was involved in a dispute of Halacha over the minimum olive size kezayit of matzah that one should eat at the Pesach Seder. In Israel he made a strong impression on the local rabbinic sages, and is frequently mentioned in their books. At Bet El Yeshiva, he belonged to a group of 12 mekubalim along with Hida, Torat Hakham, Rabbi Yom-Tov Algazi and other sages of Sephardic and Yemenite congregations. He remained at Bet El Yeshiva until his death, eventually becoming Rosh Yeshiva. He himself was a devotee of the teachings of Rabbi Isaac Luria, and a principal innovator within Lurianic Kabbalah. Popular tradition links his departure from Yemen with a miracle that occurred after a rich Muslim woman tried to seduce him. In Bet El he worked as a servant and hid his learning from others; when his knowledge of Kabbalah was accidentally discovered, he became a member of the kabbalistic circle. According to legend, the prophet Elijah appeared to him, and he is understood by the major Kabbalists as being himself the Gilgul of the Arizal. His grandson, Solomon Moses Hai Gagin Sharabi, wrote a poem of praise on his mastery of the Etz Hayyim and Shemonah She'arim of Hayyim Vital. Members of Bet El continue to prostrate themselves on his grave on the Mount of Olives on the anniversary of his death. Sharabi is credited with the miracle that opened the Kotel to Jews.Rossoff, Dovid. (2004). Where Heaven touches Earth: Jewish Life in Jerusalem from Medieval Times to the Present. Jerusalem: Guardian Press. pp. 156-158. Revised Edition. . Writings He was one of the earlier commentators on the works of the Ari, a major source of Kabbalah. His Siddur was known as the \\"Siddur Ha-Kavvanot,\\" and is the main siddur used today by Kabbalists for prayer, meditation and Yeshiva study. It is a siddur with extensive Kabbalistic meditations by way of commentary. His writings include \\"Emet va-Shalom\\", \\"Rehovot Hanahar\\", \\"Derech Shalom\\" and \\"Nahar Shalom\\", in which he answers 70 questions of the Hahamim of Tunis, who were among the leading Sephardic authorities in the 18th century. He also commented on the minhagim (customs) of the Yemenite Jews and compiled them in volumes known as \\"Minhagei Rashash\\", an exclusive edition of the Shulchan Aruch, where he gives his interpretations of the halachot, as well as noting the particular customs of the Shami Yemenite community. These volumes are still actively used by this community to reach Halachic decisions regarding holidays, marriage and Shabbat services.

The major portion of Belleville straddles the borderline between the 20th arrondissement and the 19th along its main street, the Rue de Belleville. The remainder lies in the 10th and 11th arrondissements. It was once the independent commune (municipality) of Belleville which was annexed by the City of Paris in 1860 and divided between two arrondissements. Geographically, the neighborhood is situated on and around a hill which vies with Montmartre as the highest in Paris. The name Belleville literally means \\"beautiful town\\". A view of M√©nilmontant, Paris from the hill of Belleville.  History  Historically, Belleville was a working-class neighborhood. People living in the independent village of Belleville played a large part in establishing the Second French Republic through their actions during the Revolution of 1848. In 1871, residents of the incorporated neighborhood of Belleville were some of the strongest supporters of the Paris Commune. When the Versailles Army came to reconquer Paris in May of that year, it faced some of the toughest resistance in Belleville and in neighboring M√©nilmontant. The bloody street fighting persisted in the two eastern districts, and the last of the barricades is said to have been in the Rue Ramponeau in Belleville. During the first half of the 20th century, many immigrants settled there: German Jews fleeing the Third Reich in 1933, and Spaniards in 1939. Many Algerians and Tunisian Jews arrived in the early 1960s. Belleville is home to one of the largest congregations of the Reformed Church of France. The √âglise R√©form√©e de Belleville has been in the area since shortly before World War I.  Culture  Today, Belleville is a colourful, multi-ethnic neighbourhood and also home to one of the city's two Chinatowns, the other located in the 13th arrondissement near the Place d'Italie. Since the 1980s, an important Chinese community has been established there. There are many restaurants and associations as well as stores offering Chinese products. A fairly large and popular outdoor market is held there every Tuesday and Friday along the Boulevard de Belleville, where many local √éle-de- France farmers sell their produce. The Parc de Belleville. During the 1980s Parisian artists and musicians, attracted by the cheaper rents, the numerous vacant large spaces, as well as the old Paris charm of its smaller streets (Belleville was ignored, perhaps spared, during much of the architectural modernisation efforts and reparations of the 1960s and 1970s, the greatest exception being the area around the Place des F√™tes), started moving there. Many artists now live and work in Belleville and studios are scattered throughout the quartier. Some abandoned factories have been transformed into art squats, where several alternative artists and musicians, such as the band Les Rita Mitsouko began their careers. Belleville is one of the most important neighbourhoods in Paris when it comes to Street Art. For example, Rue Denoyez or Place Frehel are a changing display of wall covering street art. The demographics of the neighbourhood have undergone many changes throughout the decades. While Armenians, Greeks, and Ashkenazi Jews were once the predominant ethnic groups, North Africans, and more recently, sub-Saharan Africans have been displacing these others. Within the neighbourhood there is a cemetery and park, the Parc de Belleville, which ascends the western slope of the hill and offers, in addition to a panoramic view of the Paris skyline, a strikingly modern contrast to the classical gardens of the city centre and the eccentric nineteenth century romanticism of the nearby Parc des Buttes Chaumont. A School of Architecture is also located in Belleville. The iconic French singer √âdith Piaf grew up there and, according to legend, was born under a lamppost on the steps of the Rue de Belleville. A commemorative plaque can be found at number 72. A true Bellevilloise, Piaf sang and spoke the French language in a way that epitomised the accent de Belleville, which has been compared to the Cockney accent of London, England, although the Parisian dialect is nowadays rarely heard. Belleville is prominently featured in the 2007 biographical film of her life, La Vie En Rose. Other famous Bellevillois include film director Maurice Tourneur, legendary French can-can dancer Jane Avril and popular singer and actor Eddy Mitchell. The filmmaker Ma√Øwenn grew up in Belleville and lives there now. In popular culture  Belleville has featured in several films including director Jacques Becker's 1951 Casque d'or, starring Simone Signoret and Serge Reggiani. Albert Lamorisse set and filmed the 1956 Oscar-winning short film Le Ballon Rouge (also known as The Red Balloon) in Belleville and featured many parts of the region that the Parisian government demolished in the 1960s as a slum clearance effort and partially replaced with housing projects. The Malauss√®ne Saga, a series of crime novels written by contemporary author Daniel Pennac, is set in Belleville. Belleville is the subject of several French songs, including Eddy Mitchell's \\"Belleville ou Nashville?\\" and Serge Reggiani's \\"Le Barbier de Belleville.\\" Belleville was also the location of the book La Vie Devant Soi by Romain Gary. Belleville has undergone much gentrification over the years, similar to that of certain neighborhoods in Brooklyn, New York; and Belleville Bistro in Park Slope, Brooklyn, was 'named after the raffish hilltop Paris neighborhood.' As a result of such gentrification, Belleville was named one of the most unique neighborhoods in the world in 2016. In The Sopranos episode 76 (\\"Cold Stones\\"), Rosalie Aprile briefly dates a much younger, motorcycle-riding Frenchman named Michel, who comes from Belleville, Paris.

In early English sources, his name also appears as \\"Giovanni Rinaldo, Count of Carli\\", and \\"Giovanni Rinaldo, Count of Carli-Rubbi\\". Life Gian Rinaldo Carli by Bartolomeo Nazari Giovanni Rinaldo Carli was born at Capo d'Istria in the Republic of Venice (now Koper in Slovenia) on April 11, 1720, the eldest child of Count Rinaldo Carli and Cecilia Imberti. He distinguished himself as a student and young scholar. In 1744, at the age of 24, he was appointed by the Venetian Senate to the University of Padua's newly established professorship of astronomy and navigation. At the same time, he was entrusted with superintendence over the Venetian marine. During these years he was part of a major dispute in Italian academia over the existence of sorcerers, with the vast majority of the academics siding with the Girolamo Tartarotti against the Marquis of Maffei and Count Carli's sharp scepticism. He filled his offices ably for seven years before resigning them to study economics and history. He works on economics attracted the attention of Leopold of Tuscany, afterwards emperor, who placed him at the head of his economics council and board of public instruction in 1765. In 1769, he became privy councillor and, in 1771, president of a new council of finances. In his old age, he was relieved of the duties of these offices while continuing to receive their income. During his leisure, he produced works on Italian history and other topics. Count Carli died of illness at Cusano in Milan on February 22, 1795. Works His principal economic works are his On Money; his 1759 Ragionamento..., in which he argued that the balance of trade between two nations cannot be looked at in isolation as both may gain from their reciprocal transactions; and his 1771 On Free Trade in Grain, which argues that free trade in grain‚Äîas adopted by Great Britain following its later repeal of its Corn Laws‚Äîis not always advisable. His principal historical work was his Italian Antiquities, in which the literature and arts of his country are ably discussed. Other works of note were his The Free Man, a rebuttal of Rousseau's Social Contract; an attack upon Abbe Tartarotti's assertion of the existence of magicians; his Observations on Ancient and Modern Music; and several poems.

In 1725, as a twenty-year-old bookseller apprentice, he evaded Edinburgh city printing restrictions by going to Leith to print, which was considered beyond Edinburgh's jurisdiction. Millar was soon to take over his apprentice master‚Äôs London print shop. He was actively involved in railing against the authorities in Edinburgh.http://www.millar- project.ed.ac.uk/manuscripts/html_output/5.html Letter from Andrew Millar to Robert Wodrow, 15 July 1725. About 1729, Millar started business as a bookseller and publisher in the Strand, London. His own judgment in literary matters was small, but he collected an excellent staff of literary advisers, and did not hesitate to pay what at the time were considered large prices for good material. \\"I respect Millar, sir,\\" said Dr Johnson in 1755, \\"he has raised the price of literature.\\" He paid Thomson ¬£105 for The Seasons, and Fielding a total sum of ¬£700 for Tom Jones and ¬£1000 for Amelia. Millar was one of the syndicate of booksellers who financed Johnson's Dictionary in 1755, and on him the work of seeing that book through the press mainly fell. During the same year Millar published the first edition of the Mitchell Map. He also published the histories of Robertson and Hume. Millar was the plaintiff in the 1769 case Millar v Taylor which held that authors and publishers are entitled to a perpetual common law copyright. That decision was ultimately overturned in the landmark 1774 case Donaldson v Beckett, whose unsuccessful plaintiff was Millar's apprentice, Thomas Becket (or Beckett).

The Journal of Legal Studies has identified Llewellyn as one of the twenty most cited American legal scholars of the 20th century. Biography Karl Llewellyn was born on May 22, 1893, in Seattle, but grew up in Brooklyn. He attended Yale College and Yale Law School, where he served as editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Journal. He studied under Arthur Linton Corbin, whose influence on him was profound. Llewellyn was studying abroad at the Sorbonne in Paris when World War I broke out in 1914. He was sympathetic to the German cause and traveled to Germany to enlist in the German army, but his refusal to renounce his American citizenship made him ineligible. He was allowed to fight with the 78th Prussian Infantry Regiment, and was injured at the First Battle of Ypres.The Casualty List (Prussian) dated Dec. 23, 1914 lists under 78 IR, Ist Battalion, 4th Company Krgsfr (Kriegsfreiwilliger - War Volunteer) Karl Llewellyn verwundet (wounded) For his actions, he was promoted to sergeant and decorated with the Iron Cross, 2nd class. After spending ten weeks in a German hospital at N√ºrtingen, and having his petition to enlist without swearing allegiance to Germany turned down, Llewellyn returned to the United States and to his studies at Yale in March 1915. After the United States entered the war, Llewellyn attempted to enlist in the United States Army, but was rejected because he had fought on the German side. Llewellyn joined the Columbia Law School faculty in 1925, where he remained until 1951, when he was appointed professor of the University of Chicago Law School. While at Columbia, Llewellyn became one of the major legal scholars of his day. He was a major proponent of legal realism. He also served as principal drafter of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). Llewellyn married another professor and UCC drafter, Soia Mentschikoff. She went on to become dean of University of Miami School of Law. Llewellyn died in Chicago of a heart attack on February 13, 1962. Legal realism Compared with traditional jurisprudence, known as legal formalism, Llewellyn and the legal realists proposed that the facts and outcomes of specific cases composed the law, rather than logical reasoning from legal rules. They argued that law is not a deductive science. Llewellyn epitomized the realist view when he wrote that what judges, lawyers, and law enforcement officers \\"do about disputes is, to my mind, the law itself\\" (Bramble Bush, p. 3). As one of the founders of the U.S. legal realism movement, he believed that the law is little more than putty in the hands of a judge who is able to shape the outcome of a case based on personal biases.\\"Jurisprudence\\".

Marks Carlo Pellegrini (25 March 1839 - 22 January 1889), who did much of his work under the pseudonym of Ape, was an artist who served from 1869 to 1889 as a caricaturist for Vanity Fair magazine, a leading journal of London society. He was born in Capua, then in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. His father came from an ancient land-owning family, while his mother was allegedly descended from the Medici. His work for the magazine made his reputation and he became its most influential artist. Early life Pellegrini was educated at the Collegio dei Barnabiti, and then at Sant'Antonio in Maddaloni, near Naples. As a young man he caricatured Neapolitan society, modelling his portraits on those of Melchiorre Delfico and Daumier and other French and British artists of the period. Pellegrini claimed to have fought with Garibaldi; however, those who knew him well dismissed this as fantasy. Deciding to leave Italy in 1864 after a series of personal crises, including the death of his sister, he travelled to England via Switzerland and France. He arrived in London in November 1864; he later claimed to have arrived destitute, and to have slept on the streets and in doorways. However, this claim may have been another fantasy designed to make him seem to be a Bohemian artist. In London he became a friend of the Prince of Wales.Roy T Williams and Peter Mellini, 'In Vanity Fair', Scolar Press, London. (1982) Work for Vanity Fair It is not recorded how Pellegrini met Thomas Bowles, the owner of Vanity Fair magazine, but he quickly found himself employed by that publication and became its first caricaturist, originally signing his work as 'Singe' (French for \\"Monkey\\") and later, and more famously, as 'Ape' (a translation of \\"Singe\\" into English). Pellegrini's work for the magazine made his reputation and he became its most influential artist, in which his caricatures were to be printed for over twenty years, from January 1869 to April 1889. His 1869 caricature of Benjamin Disraeli was the first colour lithograph to appear in the magazine, and proved immensely popular. It was the first of a highly successful series of more than two thousand caricatures published by Vanity Fair. Although the later caricatures by Sir Leslie Ward are perhaps now more well known, those by 'Ape' are regarded by many collectors as being artistically and technically superior. Apart from drawing his caricatures for the magazine, Pellegrini also attempted to set himself up as a portrait painter, but this venture met with limited success. Pellegrini met Degas in London in the 1870s, and in about 1876-77 painted his portrait, inscribed '√† vous/Pellegrini' (to you/Pellegrini). In return, Degas painted Pellegrini's portrait, similarly inscribed. Pellegrini was a member of the Beefsteak Club in London and there met Whistler, who became a great influence on his work; indeed, he even attempted to paint portraits in the style of Whistler. Pellegrini was also a member of The Arts Club from 1874 until 1888. Pellegrini was extremely careful about his appearance, and would wear immaculate white spats with highly polished boots. He grew long Mandarin-like fingernails, would never walk when he could ride, and had a limitless fund of amusing stories and eccentricities. He spoke broken-English, flaunted his homosexuality (at a time when it was dangerous to do so), and would often bring macaroni dishes to elegant dinner parties. He would refuse invitations to country houses out of fear of strange beds, and had a habit of keeping a cigar in his mouth as he slept.Peter Mellini, ‚ÄòPellegrini, Carlo [Ape] (1839‚Äì1889)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 He died of lung disease aged 49 at his home, 53 Mortimer Street, near Cavendish Square in London.

Demetrescu-BuzƒÉu, also known as Hurmuz or Cirivi»ô, born Dimitrie Dim. Ionescu-Buzeu; March 17, 1883 ‚Äì November 23, 1923) was a Romanian writer, lawyer and civil servant, who became a cult hero in Romania's avant-garde scene. His scattered work, consisting of absurdist short prose and poetry, opened a new genre in Romanian letters and humor, and captured the imagination of modernists for several generations. Urmuz's Bizarre (or Weird) Pages were largely independent of European modernism, even though some may have been triggered by Futurism; their valorization of nonsense verse, black comedy, nihilistic tendencies and exploration into the unconscious mind have repeatedly been cited as influential for the development of Dadaism and the Theatre of the Absurd. Individual pieces such as \\"The Funnel and Stamate\\", \\"Isma√Øl and Turnavitu\\", \\"Algazy & Grummer\\" or \\"The Fuchsiad\\" are parody fragments, dealing with monstrous and shapeshifting creatures in mundane settings, and announcing techniques later taken up by Surrealism. Urmuz's biography between his high school eccentricity and his public suicide remains largely mysterious, and some of the sympathetic accounts have been described as purposefully deceptive. The abstruse imagery of his work has produced a large corpus of diverging interpretations. He has notably been read as a satirist of public life in the 1910s, an unlikely conservative and nostalgic, or an emotionally distant esotericist. In Urmuz's lifetime, his stories were only acted out by his thespian friend George Ciprian and published as samples by Cuget Rom√¢nesc newspaper, with support from modernist writer Tudor Arghezi. Ciprian and Arghezi were together responsible for creating the link between Urmuz and the emerging avant-garde, their activity as Urmuz promoters being later enhanced by such figures as Ion Vinea, Geo Bogza, Lucian Boz, Sa»ôa PanƒÉ and Eug√®ne Ionesco. Beginning in the late 1930s, Urmuz also became the focus interest for the elite critics, who either welcomed him into 20th-century literature or dismissed him as a buffoonish impostor. By then, his activity also inspired an eponymous avant- garde magazine edited by Bogza, as well as Ciprian's drama The Drake's Head. Name Urmuz's birth name was, in full, Dimitrie Dim. Ionescu-Buzeu (or BuzƒÉu), changed to Dimitrie Dim. Dumitrescu-Buzeu when he was still a child, and later settled as Demetru Dem. Demetrescu-BuzƒÉu. Radu CernƒÉtescu, \\"Noi argumente pentru redeschiderea \\"cazului Urmuz' \\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 27/2010Sandqvist, p.221 The Demetrescu surname was in effect a Romanian patronymic, using the -escu suffix: his father was known as Dimitrie (Demetru, Dumitru) Ionescu-BuzƒÉu.Deligiorgis edition, p.5 The attached particle BuzƒÉu, originally Buzeu, confirms that the family traced its roots to the eponymous town.Vasile Andru, \\"Urmuz ‚Äì A Great Innovator in Spite of Himself (Urmuz and Anti-Literature as Hyper-Life)\\", in Plural Magazine, Nr. 19/2003 According to George Ciprian, the names Cirivi»ô (variation of cervi»ô, Romanian for \\"melted grease\\") and MiticƒÉ (pet form of Dumitru) were coined while the writer was still in school, whereas Urmuz came \\"later\\".Ciprian, p.40 The name under which the writer is universally known did not actually originate from his own wishes, but was selected and imposed on the public by Arghezi, only one year before Urmuz committed suicide.Cernat, Avangarda, p.340; Deligiorgis edition, p.5; Sandqvist, p.221 Vasile Iancu, \\"Avangardi»ôtii de ieri »ôi de azi\\", in Convorbiri Literare, May 2005 Geo »òerban, \\"CursƒÉ de urmƒÉrire, cu suspans, prin intersec»õiile avangƒÉrzii la rom√¢ni\\" , in Lettre Internationale Romanian edition, Nr. 58, Summer 2006 (republished by Rom√¢nia CulturalƒÉ ) Gabriela Ursachi, \\"Martie\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 12/2003 The spelling Hurmuz, when used in reference to the writer, was popular in the 1920s, but has since been described as erroneous.

Zissu. \\"Situa»õia creatorilor de artƒÉ »ôi literaturƒÉ, √Æn anii Holocaustului\\", in Realitatea EvreiascƒÉ, Nr. 237 (1037), September 2005, p.9; Liviu Rotman (ed.), Demnitate √Æn vremuri de restri»ôte, Editura Hasefer, Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania & Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania, Bucharest, 2008, p.175. The word [h]urmuz, explained by linguists as a curious addition to the Romanian lexis, C. Lacea, \\"CuriozitƒÉ»õi semantice\\", in Transilvania, Nr. 10-12/1914, p.469 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) generally means \\"glass bead\\", \\"precious stone\\" or \\"snowberry\\". It has entered the language through oriental channels, and these meanings ultimately refer to the international trade in beads centered on Hormuz Island, Iran. Anthropologist and essayist Vasile Andru highlights a secondary, scatological, meaning: in the Romani language, a source of Romanian slang, urmuz, \\"bead\\", has mutated to mean \\"feces\\". An alternative etymology, exclusive to the author's pseudonym, was advanced by writer and scholar Ioana P√¢rvulescu. It suggests the combination of two contradictory terms: ursuz (\\"surly\\") and amuz (\\"I amuse\\"). Biography=Childhood= MiticƒÉ was the eldest son of a middle class nuclear family: his father, described by Ciprian as \\"short and mean\\" (om scund »ôi ciufut),Ciprian, p.40. According to Sandqvist (p.224), the man was \\"extremely authoritarian\\". worked as a physician. In his spare time, Ionescu-Buzeu Sr. was a classical scholar, folklorist and active Freemason. His wife, the writer's mother, was Eliza n√©e Pa»ôcani, sister of the doctor, chemist and University of Paris professor Cristien Pascani.Sandqvist, p.224 Urmuz had numerous other siblings (\\"a multitude\\", according to Ciprian), of whom most were daughters. One of Urmuz's sisters, Eliza (married Vorvoreanu) was later a main source of information on the author's childhood and adolescence.Blaga, p.324, 326; Cernat, Avangarda, p.91‚Äì92, 339‚Äì340, 352 The future Urmuz was born in the northern Muntenian town of Curtea de Arge»ô, and, at age five, spent one year in Paris with his parents.CƒÉlinescu, p.888; Deligiorgis edition, p.5 The family eventually settled in Romania's capital, Bucharest, where his father was hygiene teacher at Matei Basarab National College, later city health inspector, and rented houses in Antim Monastery quarter. Young MiticƒÉ was described by his sister as mainly unpretentious and introverted, fascinated by scientific discovery and, in his childhood years, a passionate reader of Jules Verne's science fiction books.Cernat, Avangarda, p.340; Sandqvist, p.224‚Äì225 At a later stage, he was also possibly familiarized with and influenced by German idealism and by the philosophical views of 19th-century poet Mihai Eminescu.Cernat, Avangarda, p.340 Paul Cernat, \\"Urmuz: un conservator eretic?\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 193, November 2003 A more evident influence on the future writer was Ion Luca Caragiale, the main figure in early 20th-century Romanian comediography.Cernat, Avangarda, p.340; Sandqvist, p.209 \\"AnchetƒÉ. I. L. Caragiale ‚Äì azi\\", in Convorbiri Literare, February 2002Ioana P√¢rvulescu, Lumea ca ziar. A patra putere: Caragiale, Humanitas, Bucharest, 2011, p.87. Ionescu-BuzƒÉu's family had artistic interests, and Urmuz grew up with a fascination for classical music and fine art, learning to play the piano and taking up amateur oil painting.Cernat, Avangarda, p.340, 341; Ciprian, p.40‚Äì42 He got along best with his mother, who was also a pianist. The devout daughter of an Orthodox priest, she was unable to instill in her young son the same respect for the Church. Urmuz's arrival to literary history took place in the atmosphere of Bucharest gymnasia. It was at this junction that he became a mate of Ciprian, who later described their encounter as momentous: \\"I don't much believe in destiny. [...] Yet I find it such an odd incident that my bench mate, from my failing grade year through to my high school graduation, was [...] this tiny man of a rare originality, who had a massive say on how my life would turn up.\\" Ciprian describes what follows as his own \\"initiation in artistic matters\\": he recalls conversations with \\"Cirivi»ô\\" where they debated the \\"perfection\\" of Ancient Greek sculpture, and mentions that young Urmuz, unlike himself, regarded theater as a \\"minor art\\".Ciprian, p.40‚Äì42 Instead, Urmuz preferred to attend concerts at the Romanian Atheneum, and, Ciprian writes, had an advanced understanding of absolute music even at age thirteen.Ciprian, p.42 Reportedly, the young man was also in the attendance at lectures given by Titu Maiorescu, a philosopher and aesthete who had influenced both Eminescu and Caragiale. =Pahuci brotherhood= Gheorghe LazƒÉr National College Some years later, while enrolled at the Gheorghe LazƒÉr National College, Urmuz turned his interest toward mocking the severity of his teachers and challenging the dominance of artistic traditionalism. One such early episode is attested by Ciprian: amused by the creation of a Vivat Dacia (\\"Long Live Dacia\\") association of nationalist students, Urmuz subverted its meetings, and, with deadpan snark, suggested that membership fees should be paid in duck heads.Ciprian, p.47‚Äì49 Also according to Ciprian, these events soon lost their shock value, leading him and Urmuz to \\"take to the streets\\", where they began their activity as pranksters. Their initial experiment was to pressure law-abiding and credulous passers-by into presenting their identity papers for inspection, and the apparent success earned Urmuz an unexpected following in school (his fans even heckled Vivat Dacia into accepting poultry heads as means of payment, before the society dissolved itself with ceremony).Ciprian, p.49 Another colleague, future traditionalist poet Vasile Voiculescu, recalled young Urmuz as \\"genially knavish\\", his humor being \\"cerebral, harder to detect and appreciate\\".Cernat, Avangarda, p.344 The core group of Urmuzian disciples, organized as a secret society, comprised Ciprian (nicknamed \\"Macferlan\\" by Urmuz), Alexandru \\"BƒÉlƒÉlƒÉu\\" Bujoreanu and CosticƒÉ \\"Pentagon\\" Grigorescu, together known as the pahuci. Allegedly, the obscure word originated from the Hebrew for \\"yawns\\". Their activity centered on daring pranks: Urmuz and the other three young men once made an impromptu visit to the isolated CƒÉldƒÉru»ôani Monastery, in Ilfov County, where the deposed and disgraced Metropolitan Ghenadie was living in banishment. Passing themselves off as newspaper editors, they demanded (and received) honored guest treatment, tested the monks' patience, and were later introduced to a well-disposed Ghenadie.Ciprian, p.50‚Äì57 Ciprian also recalls that Urmuz's philosophical musings or deadpan surreal humor were a direct inspiration for other pranks and experiments. He describes how Cirivi»ô acted out sadness for the plight of a screechy sledge (declaring \\"my heart is at one with all things in existence\\"), but then duped onlookers into believing that the squeaks came from a woman somehow trapped under the vehicle.Ciprian, p.59‚Äì60 Reportedly, Urmuz also approached his seniors training at seminaries or other traditionalist institutions, earned their attention by claiming to share the nationalist agenda, and then began reciting them nonsense lyrics such as an evolving draft of his mock-fable \\"The Chroniclers\\".Ciprian, p.61‚Äì62 Outside school, the young man was still introverted, and, Sandqvist notes, \\"extremely shy, especially with girls.\\"Sandqvist, p.225 Ciprian recalls Cirivi»ô's engrossing pick-up lines: he acted familiar to any young woman who caught his eye, assuring her that they had met once before, and, having stirred her curiosity, falsely recounting how they both used to kill flesh-flies for sport.Ciprian, p.63‚Äì64 The pahuci welcomed their graduation with one final act of defiance against the school principal, whom they visited in his office, where they began hopping about in circles.Ciprian, p.71‚Äì72 Even though their group did not survive once its members took different career paths, they had regular reunions at the Spiru Godelea tavern, where they earned notoriety for their rude and unconventional behavior.Ciprian, p.72‚Äì73, 373 Urmuz enrolled at the Bucharest Medical School, allegedly after pressures from his stern father.Sandqvist, p.224‚Äì225 According to Ciprian, this training did not agree with his friend, who would complain of being \\"unable to make himself understood by the cadavers.\\"Ciprian, p.73. See also Sandqvist, p.225 This was probably a sign that the young man could not bear to witness dissection. He eventually entered the University of Bucharest Faculty of Law, which was to be his alma mater,Ciprian, p.77; CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.570‚Äì571; Deligiorgis edition, p.5 while also taking lectures in composition and counterpoint at the Music and Declamation Conservatory. Additionally, he completed his first service term in the Romanian Infantry. Urmuz became head of his family in 1907. That year, his father and two younger brothers died, and his sister Eliza was married. He also continued to take the initiative in daring acts of √©pater le bourgeois. Ciprian recalls the two of them renting a carriage which Urmuz would order around, making a right at every junction, and effectively going around in circles around the Palace of Justice. Urmuz then proceeded to pester the street vendors, stopping over to buy a random assortment of useless items: pretzels, a pile of charcoal, and an old hen which he impaled on his walking cane.Ciprian, p.73‚Äì77; CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.571. See also Sandqvist, p.19 =Dobrujan career and military life= Having passed his law examination in 1904, Urmuz was first appointed judge in the rural locality of Cocu (RƒÉchi»õele), in Arge»ô County.Sandqvist, p.225, 227 It is probable that at around this stage (ca. 1908), he was committing to paper the first fragments in his collection Bizarre Pages, some of which were reportedly written during a family reunion in Cocu.Cernat, Avangarda, p.9, 91‚Äì92 According to Eliza Vorvoreanu, he was doing this mainly to entertain his mother and sisters,Cernat, Avangarda, p.91‚Äì92, 339‚Äì340, 352‚Äì353 but Urmuz also amused local potentates, one of whom even offered his daughter's hand in marriage (Urmuz refused).Sandqvist, p.227 At the time, MiticƒÉ also discovered his passion for modern art: he was an admirer of primitivist sculptor Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, fascinated by his 1907 work The Wisdom of the Earth. Eventually, Urmuz was made a justice of the peace in the remote Dobruja region: for a while, he was in Casimcea village. Doru Mare»ô, \\"Teatru. Teatru dobrogean\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 7, April 2000 Later, he was dispatched closer to Bucharest, at Ghergani, D√¢mbovi»õa County. These assignments were interrupted in 1913, when Urmuz was called under arms, in the Second Balkan War against Bulgaria. Ciprian mentions having lost touch with his friend \\"for a long time\\", before receiving a letter in which the latter complained about the provincial apathy and the lack of musical entertainment; attached was a draft of the \\"Algazy & Grummer\\" story, which Ciprian was supposed to read to the \\"seminary brethren\\", informing them \\"about the progresses registered in young literature\\".Ciprian, p.77‚Äì78. See also Sandqvist, p.227 Ciprian tells of having discovered the writer in Urmuz, and popularizing this and other stories in his own circle of intellectuals.Ciprian, p.78‚Äì79, 82 He also mentions that, in his budding acting career, he was basing some of his performances at Blanduzia Garden on Urmuz's letters.Ciprian, p.114 These developments coincided with the outbreak of World War I. Between 1914 and summer 1916, when Romania was still neutral territory, Ciprian's efforts of circulating the Bizarre Pages may have reached a peak. Urmuz's texts were probably spread around in handwritten copies, becoming somewhat familiar to Bucharest's bohemian society, but Urmuz himself was still an anonymous figure.Cernat, Avangarda, p.9, 269, 340, 342, 343. See also CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.55 Both Ciprian and fellow actor Grigore MƒÉrculescu are said to have given public readings from the Bizarre Pages at Casa Cap»ôa restaurant.CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.571‚Äì572 According to literary historian Paul Cernat, if rumors about Ciprian's early performances of Urmuz's texts are true, it would constitute one of the first samples of avant-garde shows in Romanian theatrical tradition.Cernat, Avangarda, p.269, 342 Around 1916, Urmuz had obtained a relocation, as judge in the Muntenian town of Alexandria. It was there that he met with poet and schoolteacher Mihail Cruceanu, also on assignment. As Cruceanu later recalled, Urmuz was captivated by the artistic revolt carried out in Italy by the Futurist group, and in particular by the poetry of Futurist leader Filippo Tommaso Marinetti.Cernat, Avangarda, p.91 According to literary historian Tom Sandqvist, Urmuz may have first read about the Italian initiatives in the local newspaper Democra»õia, which had covered them in early 1909.Sandqvist, p.22 As a result of this or another encounter, he decided to include, as a subtitle to one of his manuscripts, the words: Schi»õe »ôi nuvele... aproape futuriste (\\"Sketches and Novellas... almost Futuristic\\").Blaga, p.323; Cernat, Avangarda, p.91, 340, 381; Sandqvist, p.22, 237 Having reached the rank of Lieutenant, Demetrescu-BuzƒÉu was again called under arms when Romania joined the Entente Powers. In one account, he saw action against the Central Powers in Moldavia, following the Army's northward retreat. However, this is partly contradicted by his correspondence from Moldavia, which shows that his new office was as a quartermaster, and which records his frustration at not having been allowed to fight in the trenches. According to another account, he was mostly bedridden with malaria, and therefore unable to perform any military duty. =Debut= Urmuz was again in Bucharest, working as grefier (registrar or court reporter) at the High Court of Cassation and Justice; sources disagree on whether this appointment dated from 1918 or earlier. Ion Pop, \\" 'CƒÉlƒÉtoriile' avangardei rom√¢ne»ôti (I)\\" , in Tribuna, Nr. 175, December 2009, p.10‚Äì11 C. Trandafir, \\"√énainte-mergƒÉtorul fƒÉrƒÉ voie\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 9/2009CƒÉlinescu, p.888; Cernat, Avangarda, p.340, 341, 379; CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.55, 571; Sandqvist, p.227 Reportedly, this was a well paid employment with special perks, which may have made Urmuz uncomfortable about his other life as a bohemian hero.Cernat, Avangarda, p.379 A photograph portrait taken in that period, one of the few to survive, was read as an additional clue that Urmuz had become melancholy and anxious.CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.571; Sandqvist, p.227 Sandqvist also sees him as a \\"catastrophically lonely\\" and insomniac customer of the brothels, adding: \\"To all appearances as a result of disgusting experiences during the wars, returning home to Bucharest Demetru Demetrescu-BuzƒÉu chose to live an extremely ascetic and isolated life with long night walks.\\"Sandqvist, p.19, 227 Urmuz's feats and pranks were nonetheless attracting more public attention, and he himself allegedly read his work to a bohemian public, in places such as Gabroveni Inn; at least some of these were free exercises in oral literature, and as such entirely lost. The year 1922 brought Urmuz's debut in print. Fascinated by the (then unnamed) Bizarre Pages, poet and journalist Tudor Arghezi included two of them in Cuget Rom√¢nesc newspaper. Arghezi reportedly made efforts to persuade his more serious fellow editors of Cuget, and possibly intended to undermine their attempt of putting out a newspaper of record.Cernat, Avangarda, p.340, 356; Sandqvist, p.221 The gazette had also published a manifesto by Arghezi, in which he had outlined the goal of combating \\"sterile literature\\", and his intention of cultivating the \\"will to power\\" in post-war literary culture. Urmuz was thus the first avant-garde writer popularized by Arghezi, in a list which, by 1940, also came to include a large section of the younger Romanian modernists.Cernat, Avangarda, p.48, 340 Arghezi later wrote that his relationship with Urmuz was difficult, especially since the grefier panicked that the establishment would discover his other career: \\"he feared that the Cassation Court would better detect him as Urmuz than under his own name\\". The memoirist refers to Demetrescu-BuzƒÉu's perfectionism and unease, enhanced in the week before publication: \\"He would wake up in the middle of the night and would send a very urgent letter, asking me if the comma after a 'that' should be moved before. I found him wandering around my house at night, shy, restless, fainthearted or in a hopeful trance, that something of substance may or may not be found in his prose, that perhaps there's an error, asking me to publish it, and then again to destroy it; to publish it together with a eulogistic note, and then again to curse him. He bribed [the printers] to change phrases and words that I had to put back into place, as previous editorial interventions were for sure better than his.\\"CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.571 The letters they exchanged show that the grefier was not enthusiastic about even seeing his texts and his pseudonym in print, to which Arghezi was replying: \\"from among the few we'll be cooperating with, you were my first choice\\". By May 1922, Urmuz had grown more confident in his strength as a writer. He sent Arghezi a copy of the \\"Algazy & Grummer\\" story, which, he joked, needed to be published for \\"the nation's benefit\\". He also proposed headlining it with the additional title Bizarre Pages. The work was never published by Cuget, probably because of a change in priorities: around that date, the paper hosted traditionalist editorials by culture critic Nicolae Iorga, which were incompatible with Arghezi's fronde. =Suicide= On November 23, 1923, Urmuz shot himself, an event which remains shrouded in mystery. His death occurred in a public location, described as being close to Kiseleff Road in northern Bucharest.Cernat, Avangarda, p.340; PanƒÉ, p.71; Sandqvist, p.233 Some early sources suggest that he may have been suffering from an incurable disease,Sandqvist, p.233 but he is also argued to have been fascinated with guns and their destructive potential. In 1914 for instance, he wrote down in his papers a homage to revolvers, crediting them with a magical power over the suicidal brain. Simona Vasilache, \\"DupƒÉ masa lui Grummer\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 46/2008 Reports also show that he was theorizing the purposelessness and hollowness of life, addressing his fears on the subject to family members during the funeral of his brother Constantin (also in 1914). Researcher Geo »òerban wrote about Demetrescu-BuzƒÉu's well-hidden disappointment, assessing that, during his final year, the writer continued to act cheerful and relaxed, but that a \\"devastating\\" tension was building up inside him. At around that time, Urmuz took his one real trip as an adult civilian, visiting the Budaki Lagoon in Bessarabia. Writing in 1927, Arghezi publicized his regret at not having cultivated the friendship: \\"I never saw him again and I am weighed down by the irreparable grief of never seeking him out. I believe my optimism could have rekindled in his cerebral chaos those candid and pure things that were beginning to die.\\" Several Urmuz exegetes have traditionally seen the suicide intrinsically linked to Urmuz's artistic attitude. For scholar Carmen Blaga, it was the \\"dissolution of [his] faith\\" in Romania's intellectual class, along with economic decline and \\"an existential void\\", that prompted the writer to opt himself out.Blaga, p.325‚Äì326 This resonates with claims by the first-generation followers of Urmuz: Geo Bogza suggests that his mentor killed himself once the deconstructive process, performed by his \\"sharp intellect\\", reached a natural conclusion; Cezar Gheorghe, \\"TrƒÉim √Æntr-o lume urmuzianƒÉ\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 469, April 2009 Sa»ôa PanƒÉ claims that Urmuz was tired of merely amusing the \\"cretins\\" and \\"profiteers\\" who held sway over Bucharest's literary scene, and, determined to turn his literary persona into \\"stardust\\", took the risk of destroying his physical self.PanƒÉ, p.70‚Äì71 Additionally, academic George CƒÉlinescu argued that there was a philosophical rationale \\"very in tune with his century\\": \\"he wanted to die in some original way, 'without any cause'.\\"CƒÉlinescu, p.888 Kept at the city morgue, the body was assigned to Urmuz's brother-in-law and fellow clerk C. Stoicescu, who stated that the writer had been suffering from neurosis. Urmuz was buried on November 26, in his family plot at Bellu cemetery. On the day, the event was publicized by a small obituary in Diminea»õa daily, signed with the initial C (presumably, for Ciprian).Cernat, Avangarda, p.342 Both this and other press notices failed to mention that the grefier and the published author were one and the same, and the general public was for long unaware of any such connection. Story goes that an anonymous woman visited the family shortly after the burial, inquiring as to whether the deceased had left any letters.Sandqvist, p.234 In its manuscript form, Urmuz's definitive corpus of works covers only 40 pages, 50 at most.Simona Popescu, \\"Urmuz, the Solitary\\", in Plural Magazine, Nr. 19/2003 Various other manuscripts survive, including diaries and hundreds of aphorisms, but have for long been unknown to researchers.Blaga, passim; Cernat, Avangarda, p.381; CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.570, 571 Urmuz's ideas and stylistic affinities=The avant-garde herald vs. the conservative= Shortly after his death, Urmuz's work was linked to the emergence of avant- garde rebellion throughout Europe, and in particular to the rise of Romania's own modernist scene: writing in 2007, Paul Cernat describes this version of events as a \\"founding myth\\" of Romanian avant-garde literature.Cernat, Avangarda, p.339, 346 A literary critic and modernist enthusiast, Lucian Boz, assessed that Urmuz, like Arthur Rimbaud before him, embodied the \\"lyrical nihilism\\" of avant-garde currents.Cernat, Avangarda, p.334, 347 In the 1960s, literary historian Ovid CrohmƒÉlniceanu wrote of his being \\"the world's first pre-Dada exercises\\".CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.55 In 2002 however, scholar Adrian LƒÉcƒÉtu»ô revised this thesis, arguing that it had created a \\"blockage\\" in critical reception, and that the actual Urmuz had more complex views on the avant-garde. Others have emphasized that Urmuz's unusual revolt ran contemporary with the revival of intense traditionalism of Romanian literature (the SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul moment), which would make his pre-Dada inspiration a moment of special significance.Cernat, Avangarda, p.352, 374, 386; Bogdan Cre»õu, \\" 'Avangarda prudentƒÉ' \\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 350, December 2006 Adrian G. RomilƒÉ, \\"Universul mecanic al lui Urmuz\\", in Convorbiri Literare, March 2002 The contact with Futurism, although acknowledged by Urmuz, is judged by many of his commentators as superficial and delayed. Literary historian Nicolae BalotƒÉ first proposed that the Romanian had merely wanted to show his sympathy for (and not a like-mindedness with) Futurism; that the works in question date back before the Futurist Manifesto, to the Cocu period; and that the Bizarre Pages have more in common with Expressionism than with Marinetti.Cernat, Avangarda, p.91, 361‚Äì362 According to Cernat: \\"By the looks of it, [the Bizarre Pages] were completed largely independent of influence from the European avant-garde movements [...]. We do not know, however, how many of these were already completed in 1909, the year when European Futurism was 'invented'.\\" Emilia Drogoreanu, a researcher of Romanian Futurism, stresses: \\"The values and representations of [the] world celebrated through Futurism exist within the Urmuzian text, but are entirely uprooted from the significance offered them by [the Futurists]\\". Dan Gulea, \\"Perspective asupra futurismului\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 231, July 2004 Although she finds various similarities between Urmuz and Marinetti, Carmen Blaga notes that the former's jadedness was no match for the latter's militancy.Blaga, p.325‚Äì328, 330 Various authors have also suggested that Urmuz was actually a radical conservative, whose vehemence against platitude in art only camouflaged a basic conventionalism. This perspective found its voice with LƒÉcƒÉtu»ô, who sees Urmuz as a conservative heretic, equally annoyed by bourgeois and anti- bourgeois discourses. Writing in 1958, Ciprian also reflected on the possibility that Cirivi»ô was actually \\"teasing\\" the avant-garde tendencies emerging in his day, but concluded: \\"I would rather assume that under these various experiments was smoldering the lust for shaking the individual out of his skin, of tearing him away from himself, of disassembling him, of making him doubt the authenticity of accumulated knowledge.\\"Ciprian, p.62‚Äì63 He writes that Urmuz's work lashed out at \\"human nature in its most intimate creases.\\"Cernat, Avangarda, p.342; Ciprian, p.82 Accordingly, some authors have even considered Urmuz the inheritor of late-19th-century Decadence Paul Cernat, \\"Futurism »ôi interculturalitate\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 231, July 2004 or of a matured alexandrine purity. Alexandru Ruja, \\"CulturƒÉ »ôi sens\\", in Orizont, Nr. 7/2007, p.9 In other such readings, Urmuz appears to lend his backing to the sexist Ioana P√¢rvulescu, \\"Erau interbelicii misogini?\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 6/2010 or antisemitic viewpoints of his contemporaries. CrohmƒÉlniceanu also writes: \\"the musings comprised in his manuscript notebooks [...] are restrained, flat, commonplace, as if the work of a different man.\\" Much debate surrounds the issue of Urmuz's connection to an absurdist streak in earlier Romanian literature and folklore. In the 1940s, George CƒÉlinescu discussed in detail an Urmuzian tradition, of as being characteristic for the literary culture of Romania's southern, Wallachian, cities. He noted that Urmuz was one of \\"the great grimacing sensitive\\" Wallachians, a \\"Balkan\\" succession which also includes Hristache the Baker, Anton Pann, Ion Minulescu, Mateiu Caragiale, Ion Barbu and Arghezi.CƒÉlinescu, p.53, 814; Cernat, Avangarda, p.351, 352, 357 In his definition, the source of Arghezi and Urmuz is in the folkloric tradition of self-parody, where the doina songs degenerate into spells or \\"grotesque whines\\".Cernat, Avangarda, p.351‚Äì352 The image of a folkloric Urmuz was soon after taken up by other critics, including Eugenio Co»ôeriu and CrohmƒÉlniceanu.CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.184. See also Sandqvist, p.228, 230, 248 =The buffoon vs. the professional writer= A section among Urmuz's commentators tends to classify him as a genial but superficial prankster, a buffoon rather than a serious author. Although sympathetic to Urmuz's work, George CƒÉlinescu called the Bizarre Pages \\"an intelligent literary game\\" of \\"witty teenagers\\".Cernat, Avangarda, p.340, 350, 352‚Äì355 The goal, CƒÉlinescu suggested, was \\"purely epic\\", \\"seeming to tell a story without in fact recounting anything\\".Cernat, Avangarda, p.353 Another verdict of this kind belongs to aesthetician Tudor Vianu, who also believed that Urmuz was a satirist of automatic behavior, and fundamentally a sarcastic realist. More severe in tone, Pompiliu Constantinescu assessed that Urmuz was superficial, chaotic and amateurish, interesting to researchers only because of defying \\"the bourgeois platitude\\".Cernat, Avangarda, p.349‚Äì350 Contrarily, another interwar exegete, Perpessicius, made ample efforts to rehabilitate Urmuz as a thoughtful literary figure with \\"great creative verve\\", on the same level as Arghezi and poet Adrian Maniu.Cernat, Avangarda, p.322, 329 Ciprian noted that Urmuz was unlike the \\"cheeky, daring, disorganized\\" pranksters whom he superficially resembled, that nothing in Urmuz's exterior gave the impression that he was in any way \\"spoiled\\".Ciprian, p.60‚Äì61 Time, he suggests, did not alter Urumuz's \\"attitude on life\\": \\"Only now the about-turns were more daring and the tightrope acts was much more savvy.\\"Ciprian, p.77 In 1925, commenting on Urmuz's flair for depicting the \\"overall pointlessness of [human] existence\\", Ciprian also argued: \\"For the mediocre mindset, [Urmuz] may seem incoherent and unbalanced‚Äîwhich is why his work is not addressed to the masses.\\"Cernat, Avangarda, p.343 Critic Adrian G. RomilƒÉ writes that the new \\"paradigm\\" in Urmuz's literary universe appears significant and laborious, but adds: \\"That which we do not know is if the writer [...] wasn't purely and simply playing around.\\" However, Ioana P√¢rvulescu assessed that Urmuz, an author of \\"extreme originality\\", Ioana P√¢rvulescu, \\"Drumuri care se bifurcƒÉ\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 44/2004 \\"put his own life into play and games [...] and that is why his work is more tragic than comedic or is nested in that no man's land where tragedy and comedy overlap.\\" CrohmƒÉlniceanu sees in the Bizarre Pages indication of a \\"singular\\" and tragic experience,CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.570‚Äì571 while Geo »òerban argues that Urmuz's \\"verve\\" comes from destructive pressures on his own psychology. Reviewer Simona Vasilache also suggests that the Bizarre Pages hide a \\"long digested\\" rage, with serious and even dramatic undertones. Other essayists have spoken about Urmuz's \\"cruelty\\" in depicting anguishing situations, in criticizing social life and in using language stripped of its metaphors; they call him \\"one of the cruelest authors I ever did read\\" (Eug√®ne Ionesco) and \\"cruel in a primitive sense\\" (Irina Ungureanu). As Ciprian reports, Urmuz was also self-deprecatory, amused by the others' attention, and claiming that his own elucubra»õii (\\"phantasmagorias\\") could only still be used to \\"trip the seminary brethren\\".Ciprian, p.78‚Äì79 One of his aphorisms hints to his internal drama and its role in creation: \\"There are cases when God can only help you by giving you more and more suffering.\\" =Kafka, Jarry and \\"antiliterature\\"= Among those who describe Urmuz as more of an individual rebel than an avant- garde hero, several have come to regard him as the Romanian parallel of solitary intellectuals who likewise made an impact on 20th-century literature. In the decades after his death, Romanian reviewers started comparing him to Czechoslovakia's Franz Kafka, a parallel which was still being supported in the 21st century.Cernat, Avangarda, p.330, 362, 363, 365, 367, 377, 388, 404; Michael Finkenthal, \\"Mihail Sebastian: c√Æteva observa»õii cu ocazia unui centenar\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 391, September 2007; Sandqvist, p.224 According to RomilƒÉ, Urmuzian and Kafkaesque literature are both about dehumanization, in Urmuz's case with a predilection for mechanical oddities which colonize and modify human existence. Other frequent analogies rank Urmuz together with Alfred Jarry, the French proto-Dadaist and inventor of 'Pataphysics.Cernat, Avangarda, p.334, 344, 352, 367, 390; Sandqvist, p.225, 228 Marie-France Ionesco, \\"Ionesco s-a sim»õit √Æn exil √Æn Rom√¢nia, nu √Æn Fran»õa\\", in Evenimentul Zilei, July 10, 2009 He was also described as an equivalent of Anglophone nonsense writers (Edward Lear, Lewis Carroll).Cernat, Avangarda, p.353‚Äì354; Sandqvist, p.228 Nicolae BalotƒÉ, \\"PlƒÉcut este sƒÉ-l cuno»ôti pe domnul Lear\\" , in Contemporanul, Nr. 12/2009, p.5 Elsewhere, he is paralleled with Russia's Daniil Kharms,Cernat, Avangarda, p.383, 388; \\"Un scriitor de (re)descoperit\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 32, October 2000 or modernist Poles from Bruno Schulz Alice Georgescu, \\"Ambi»õii na»õionale (II)\\", in Ziarul Financiar, November 16, 2007 to Stanis≈Çaw Ignacy Witkiewicz. Marius LazurcƒÉ, \\"Polonia mea\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 147-148, December 2002 Those who speak about his fundamental conservatism or his humorist's talent have also likened Urmuz and the Bizarre Pages to Gustave Flaubert and his sarcastic Dictionary of Received Ideas. Marian Victor Buciu, \\"N. Manolescu despre proza rom√¢neascƒÉ. Interbelicii\\" , in Contemporanul, Nr. 9/2010, p.17; Cernat, Avangarda, p.364‚Äì365, 384 At the other end, those who focus on Urmuz's bizarre and sad metamorphoses have paralleled his work to Tim Burton's Oyster Boy stories. Elisabeta LƒÉsconi, \\"Gotic t√¢rziu »ôi absurd timpuriu\\", in Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Nr. 6-7/2009 A major disagreement among critics relates to Urmuz's ambiguous positioning, between literature, antiliterature and metafiction. In reference to the Bizarre Pages, CrohmƒÉlniceanu introduced the term \\"antiprose\\".Cernat, Avangarda, p.382‚Äì383; CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.570‚Äì576 In CrohmƒÉlniceanu's view, the antiliterary \\"device\\" Urmuz invented is impersonal and regulated, in the manner of Dada \\"readymades\\", but as such ingenious and therefore inimitable.CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.56‚Äì57, 570‚Äì576 Authors such as Adrian Marino, Eugen Negrici, Lucian Raicu and Mircea Scarlat have spoken about Urmuz as a revolutionist of language, who liberated texts from coherence and even semantics; whereas others‚ÄîLivius Cioc√¢rlie, Radu Petrescu, Ion Pop, Nicolae Manolescu, Marin Mincu, Mihai Zamfir‚Äîhave regarded him as mainly a textualist, interested in reusing and redefining the limits of poetry or narration, but creating a coherent, if personal, universe.Cernat, Avangarda, p.370‚Äì372, 375‚Äì377, 383‚Äì384, 390‚Äì391 According to Vasile Andru, Urmuzian literature is by definition open to all these associations, its antiliterary aspects illustrating the modern gap between \\"nature and nurture\\". Critic C. Trandafir, who sees Urmuz's apparent textualism as canceled out by deeper meanings in his prose, writes: \\"The man who wrote the 'bizarre pages' had a clear critical awareness of the transformations needed within literary discourse.\\" =Esoteric layers= As Vasile Voiculescu recalls, Urmuz had was genuinely \\"tormented by metaphysical matters\\". Some of Urmuz's commentators therefore discussed him as a reader of the unconscious mind or propagator of esoteric knowledge, suggesting that a hidden layer of mystical symbolism can be discerned in all his activities. According to Perpessicius, the Bizarre Pages as a whole carry a subtext of mythopoeia, or \\"fragments of a new mythology\\".Cernat, Avangarda, p.321‚Äì322, 349 Boz also drew a comparison between Urmuz and the morose poems of George Bacovia, arguing that they both send the reader on \\"tragic explorations\\" and \\"journeys to the underworld\\".Cernat, Avangarda, p.334, 348 In Boz's interpretation, Urmuz was not at all a humorist, but rather one who issued a solitary \\"call to order\\" and, creating a \\"magical phenomenon\\", elevated his reader above the realities of the flesh.Cernat, Avangarda, p.347 He first discussed the connection between the Bizarre Pages and 1930s Surrealism, which likewise turned its attention to the abnormal psychology, to \\"psychosis\\" and \\"dementia\\".Cernat, Avangarda, p.335 The theoretical proto-Surrealism of such works, which places less importance on their topical humor, has generated a long debate between scholars later in the 20th century: some have denied Urmuzian Surrealism, whereas others have continued to identify him as the earliest Romanian Surrealist.Cernat, Avangarda, p.359‚Äì366, 368, 376‚Äì377, 382, 387‚Äì388 Simona Popescu, the poet-essayist, presumes that Urmuz's inner motivation was his \\"psycho-mania\\", which holds no respect for either convention or posterity, but only for committing one's own \\"abyssal obsessions\\" to paper: \\"death, the Eros, creation, and destruction.\\" Adrian LƒÉcƒÉtu»ô also makes note of Urmuz's ambiguous allusions to autoeroticism, incest, bisexuality or paraphilia. Additionally, various commentators suggest that Urmuz's creative spark hides an unresolved conflict with his father. According to Cernat, Urmuz was in conflict with \\"paternal authority\\" and more attached to his mother, an \\"Oedipus complex\\" also found in some other literary figures of the pre- modernist generation.Cernat, Avangarda, p.18, 385 Others too see in Cirivi»ô's pranks a planned revenge against parental and social pressures.Blaga, p.324 His sister Eliza credited such accounts, by noting: \\"You can tell he failed in life because he obeyed his parents blindly, and perhaps also in part due to his lack of will, his shyness, his fear of the public.\\" Urmuz the aphorist genuinely trusted that the \\"Soul\\" of the world was a unity of opposites, and, inspired by the philosophy of Henri Bergson, also spoke of a \\"universal vital flux\\".Blaga, p.326‚Äì327 LƒÉcƒÉtu»ô and others suggest that Urmuz's worldview is the modern correspondent of Gnosticism and Manichaeism: in one of the manuscripts he left behind, Urmuz speculates about there being two Gods, one good and one evil. A distinct, and disputed, »òtefan Borb√©ly, \\"Luciferism »ôi literaturƒÉ\\", in Apostrof, Nr. 5/2011; Ioana Bot, \\"Maledic»õiunea omniefabilei confuzii masonice\\", in Dilemateca, June 2011, p.62 interpretation was put forth by researcher Radu CernƒÉtescu, who believes that Urmuz's life and work reflected the doctrine of Freemasonry. CernƒÉtescu reads indications of Masonic \\"awakening\\" throughout Urmuz's stories, and notes that the pahuci brotherhood was probably the junior or parody version of a Romanian Masonic Lodge. Works=Early prose= Definitions vary in respect to the exact nature and species of Urmuz's experimental works, which are prose-like in content. Ciprian simply assessed that Urmuz's pieces \\"do not belong to any literary genre.\\" In line with his comments about the mythological layer of Urmuz's work, Perpessicius suggested that Urmuz created \\"new fairy tales\\" and \\"fantasy sketches\\".Cernat, Avangarda, p.321, 349 This intuition was given endorsement by other scholars, who included the Bizarre Pages in anthologies of Romanian fantasy literature.Cernat, Avangarda, p.349, 363‚Äì365 Contrarily, Boz found that Urmuz was \\"the poet of transcendental absurdity\\", \\"the reformer of Romanian poetry\\", and the counterpart of Romania's national poet, Mihai Eminescu.Cernat, Avangarda, p.330‚Äì331 The Eminescu-Urmuz comparison, which put aside all their differences in style and vision, was a favorite of avant-garde authors, and, late in the century, served to inspire sympathetic academics such as Marin Mincu.Cernat, Avangarda, p.331, 346, 359‚Äì360, 373 According to Ciprian, one of Urmuz's earliest prose fragments was composed, with \\"The Chroniclers\\", during pahuci escapades. Its opening words, Ciprian recalls, were: \\"The deputy arrived in a brick and tile cart. He was bringing no news, but offered his friends, upon arrival, a few Leclanch√© batteries\\".Ciprian, p.62 The same author suggests that these drafts were much inferior to Urmuz's published works, beginning with \\"Algazy & Grummer\\".Ciprian, p.78 In its definitive version, the Algazy piece offers a glimpse into the strange life and cannibalistic death of its storekeeper characters: Algazy, \\"a nice old man\\" with his beard \\"neatly laid out on a grill [...] surrounded by barbed wire\\", \\"does not speak any European languages\\" and feeds on municipal waste; Grummer, who has \\"a bilious temper\\" and \\"a beak of aromatic wood\\", spends most time lying under the counter, but sometimes assaults customers in the middle of conversations about sports or literature. When Algazy discovers that his associate has digested, without giving a thought to sharing, \\"all that was good in literature\\", he takes his revenge by consuming Grummer's rubbery bladder. A race begins as to who can eat the other first. Their few remains are later discovered by the authorities, and one of Algazy's many wives sweeps them up into oblivion.Deligiorgis edition, p.54‚Äì63. See also Sandqvist, p.19‚Äì20, 230 A different, early variant is quoted \\"from memory\\" and commented in Ciprian. In this account, Algazy the storekeeper is persuaded by his domineering wife to make their only son a magistrate. Grummer prepares the boy for his unexpected novitiate, strapping him down to the floor of a cave that must have the scent of colts.Ciprian, p.77‚Äì78 From its very title, \\"Algazy & Grummer\\" references a defunct firm of suitcase manufacturers. Urmuz's own note to the text apologizes for this, explaining that the names' \\"musicality\\" is more suited to the two fictional characters than to their real-life models, and suggesting that the company should change name (or that its patrons must adapt their physical shape accordingly). Gheorghe CrƒÉciun, \\"How to Do Characters with Words\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 24, August 2000Blaga, p.327; Deligiorgis edition, p.54‚Äì55 Simona Vasilache, \\"Doi co»õcari\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 27/2010 The narrative may hint to the everyday tensions between these entrepreneurs, and perhaps to the boredom of a career in sales; according to philologist Simona Constantinovici, it is also the confrontation of an entrepreneurial Turk (Algazy) and an intellectual Jew (Grummer), represented as a fight between the ostrich and the platypus. Simona Constantinovici, \\"Eveniment: Festivalul 'Zile »ôi nop»õi de literaturƒÉ'. De ce (nu) ne place excentricul »ôi grotescul personaj urmuzian? Cazul Algazy & Grummer\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 27/2010 Beyond the mundane pretext, the story was often described as Urmuz's manifesto against any literary technique, Ana-Maria Popescu, \\"Pove»ôti postmoderne »ôi u»ôor feministe\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 295, November 2005Cernat, Avangarda, p.383, 390 and even a witty meditation on the signified and signifier.Blaga, p.326, 327 Carmen Blaga further proposes that Urmuz philosophic intent is to show the gap between universe, in which all things are possible and random, and man, who demands familiarity and structure.Blaga, p.327, 330 =\\"Isma√Øl and Turnavitu\\"= Lipscani shops around 1900. Photograph by Alexandru Antoniu In \\"Isma√Øl and Turnavitu\\", Urmuz further explores the bizarre in its everyday settings. This was noted by Ciprian: \\"[Urmuz] waged war on nature, he created besides nature and against its laws. He was a solitary summit defying heaven and asking: That's all? [...] Always the same slopes? the same compasses? the same people? the same beards?\\"Ciprian, p.82. See also Cernat, Avangarda, p.343 The result, Sandqvist writes, is \\"breakneck, absurd, and inordinately grotesque.\\"Sandqvist, p.223 CƒÉlinescu singled out the work: \\"The best of his absurd pieces is 'Isma√Øl and Turnavitu', the solemnly academic portraiture and parody of bourgeois mannerisms, where there's always a confusion being made between the three kingdoms, the animal, the vegetal and the mineral\\". Isma√Øl \\"is made up of eyes, sideburns, and a dress\\", tied with rope to a badger and stumbling down Arionoaia Street. Protected from \\"legal responsibility\\" in the country (\\"a seed-bed at the bottom of a hole in Dobruja\\"), the creature raises an entire badger colony: some he eats raw, with lemon; the others, once they have turned sixteen, he rapes \\"without the smallest qualm of conscience.\\" The seed-bed is where Isma√Øl also interviews job applicants, received on the condition that they hatch him \\"four eggs each\\". The process is supported by his \\"chamberlain\\" Turnavitu, who exchanges love letters with the applicants. Isma√Øl's actual residence is kept a secret, but it is presumed that he lives, sequestered from \\"the corruption of electoral mores\\", in an attic above the home of his grotesquely disfigured father, only to emerge in a ball gown for the yearly celebration of plaster. He then offers his body to the workers, in hopes of thus resolving \\"the labor issue\\". Whereas Isma√Øl has once worked as an air fan for \\"dirty Greek coffee houses\\" in the Lipscani quarter, Turnavitu has a past in \\"politics\\": he was for long the government-appointed air fan at the fire precinct kitchen. Isma√Øl has spared Turnavitu a life of near constant rotation, remunerating his services: the seed-bed interviews, the ritualized apologizes to the leashed badgers, the praise of Isma√Øl's fashion sense, and the swabbing of canola over Isma√Øl's gowns. Their relationship breaks down as Turnavitu, returning from the Balearic Islands in the form of a jerrycan, passes the common cold to Isma√Øl's badgers. Sacked from his job, he contemplates suicide (\\"not before seeing to the extraction of four canines in his mouth\\"), and hurls himself into a pyre made up of Isma√Øl's dresses; the patron falls into depression and \\"decrepitude\\", retreating to his seed-bed for the rest of his own life.Deligiorgis edition, p.23‚Äì29. A short variant, quoted \\"from memory\\" and commented upon, in Ciprian, p.78‚Äì79. See also Sandqvist, p.20, 223 Like \\"Algazy & Grummer\\", \\"Isma√Øl and Turnavitu\\" probably has a skeletal structure borrowed from real life: Turnavitu was a distinguished clan within Bucharest's Greek nobility, tracing its origin back to the Phanariote era. Mihai Sorin RƒÉdulescu, \\"Genealogii: Discre»õia unui bucure»ôtean de altƒÉdatƒÉ\\", in Ziarul Financiar, August 29, 2008 The semi-fictional world is populated by other symbols of Romania's connection to the Orient, that are meant to evoke \\"the banality of a distinctively Balkan scenery\\" (Carmen Blaga).Blaga, p.330 Other interpretations have seen in the two protagonists caricatures of political corruption and parvenu morals. =\\"The Funnel and Stamate\\"= \\"The Funnel and Stamate\\" insists on the geographical setting of Urmuzian misadventures. Stamate's townhouse is a haven for objects or beings, their presence inventoried over several rooms. Only accessible through a tube, the windowless first room holds together a sample of the thing-in-itself, the statue of a Transylvanian priest and grammarian, and two humans always \\"in the process of descending from the ape\\". The second room, decorated in \\"Turkish style\\" and \\"eastern luxury\\", is painted once a day and carefully measured, by compass, to prevent shrinkage. A third section, under the \\"Turkish\\" room, houses a limitless canal, a tiny room and a stake \\"to which the entire Stamate family is tethered.\\" The \\"dignified\\" and \\"elliptical\\" head of the clan spits chewed-up celluloid on his fat boy Bufty, who \\"pretends not to notice\\". For relaxation, the Stamates contemplate Nirvana, located over the canal and \\"in the same precinct\\" as them. Old Stamate's musings are interrupted by the provocative intrusion of a siren, who lures him into the deep by presenting him with \\"an innocent and too decent looking funnel.\\" Stamate returns \\"a better and more tolerant man\\", deciding to use the funnel for both the pleasures of sex and those of science. Neglecting his family duties, he goes on nightly expeditions into the funnel, until he discovers in horror that Bufty uses the funnel for a similar purpose. Stamate then decides to part with his wife (sewing her in a bag, to \\"preserve the cultural traditions of his family\\") and with Bufty: trapped in the funnel, the boy is sent over to Nirvana, where Stamate makes sure he becomes a \\"bureau sub-chief\\". Stamate is left alone to contemplate his plight, wandering to and fro at great speed, and submerging \\"into micro-infinity.\\"Deligiorgis edition, p.6‚Äì21. See also Ciprian, p.79‚Äì82; Sandqvist, p.221‚Äì223 As an early supporter of Urmuz, Ciprian spoke of \\"The Funnel and Stamate\\" as \\"without parallel\\" in its satire of family life, suggesting that the scene were all the Stamates are tied to a single stake is \\"more evocative than hundreds of pages from a novel\\"Ciprian, p.82 (part of the story has also been read as a sexist joke on fashionable androgyny, since Stamate has a \\"tonsured and legitimate wife\\"). Urmuz's original version in fact carries the subtitle \\"A Four-Part Novel\\", in which Paul Cernat reads the intention of parodying the staple genres of traditional literature;Cernat, Avangarda, p.195 according to Ioana P√¢rvulescu, the definition needs to be taken seriously, and makes the text (\\"perhaps the shortest [novel] in European literature\\") a \\"microscopic\\" Romanian equivalent of modernist works by James Joyce. Linguist Anca Davidoiu-Roman notes: \\"Urmuz's antinovel [...] apparently preserves the structures of the novelistic genre, but undermines them from the inside, cultivating the absurd, the black humor, [...] the nonsensical and the zeugma.\\" Anca Davidoiu-Roman, \\"MascƒÉ »ôi clonƒÉ. Despre atitudinile parodiei\\", in Familia, Nr. 9/2009, p.102 The core theme is believed to be sexual: a paraphrase of Romeo and Juliet, with Stamate as the ridiculously abstract thinker falling for the debased stand-in of femininity; or even the detailed creation of \\"an aberrant mechanism for erotic gratification.\\" Stamate himself is also described as standing in for \\"the unimaginative bourgeois\\". =\\"The Fuchsiad\\"= Theodor Fuchs, ca. 1900 Another one of Urmuz's prose creations is \\"The Fuchsiad\\", subtitled \\"An Heroic-Erotic Musical Poem in Prose\\". Among the scholars, Perpessicius was first to argue that the subtext here is a direct reference to Greek mythology and Norse paganism, re-contextualized \\"with the sadistic pleasure of children who take apart their dolls\\".Cernat, Avangarda, p.321‚Äì322 The protagonist Fuchs is an eminently musical creature, who came into the world not out of his mother's womb, but through his grandmother's ear. At the conservatory, he turns into \\"the perfect chord\\", but out of modesty spends most of his education hiding at the bottom of a piano. Puberty comes and he grows \\"some kind of genitalia\\"‚Äîin fact a \\"fig leaf\\" which keeps rejuvenating. The actual story begins on the one night Fuchs spends in the open air: under the spell of its mysteries, the composer finds his way into Traian Street (Bucharest's red- light district). There, a group of \\"vestals\\" whisks him away, praying to be shown the beauty of \\"immaterial love\\" and begging him to play a sonata. His music is overheard by the goddess Venus. Instantly \\"defeated by passion\\", she asks Fuchs to join her on Mount Olympus. The act of lovemaking between clueless, overanxious Fuchs and the giant goddess is compromised when Fuchs decides to enter his whole body into Venus' ear. The embarrassed and angered audience humiliates the guest and banishes him to the planet Venus; merciful Athena allows him to return home, but on condition he does not reproduce. However, Fuchs still decides to spend some of his time practicing his lovemaking on Traian Street, hoping that Venus will grant him a second chance, and believing that he and the goddess could breed a race of Supermen. In the end, the prostitutes also reject his advances, deeming him a \\"dirty satyr\\", no longer capable of immaterial love. The story ends with Fuchs' flight into \\"boundless nature\\", whence his music \\"has been beaming away with equal force in all directions\\", fulfilling his destiny as an enemy of inferior art.Deligiorgis edition, p.72‚Äì91. See also Sandqvist, p.230‚Äì233 Urmuz's story has been variously described as his praise of artistic freedom, and more precisely as an ironic take on his own biography as a failed musician.Sandqvist, p.230‚Äì233 On a more transparent level, it references classical composer Theodor Fuchs, depicted by posterity as a \\"puberal\\" and \\"clumsy\\" man, and known as a disgraced favorite of Romanian Queen-Consort Elisabeth of Wied.Sandqvist, p.231‚Äì233 \\"The Fuchsiad\\" may also contain intertextual nods to A Midsummer Night's Dream. =\\"Emil Gayk\\" and \\"Going Abroad\\"= The \\"Emil Gayk\\" sketch was the only one which is precisely dated to the early stages of World War I, focusing its satire on the debates of neutralists and interventionists.Cernat, Avangarda, p.343. According to Sandqvist (p.230), the story \\"indirectly refers to the author's own experiences during the war\\". Gayk, the ever-vigilant, gun-toting, bird-like civilian, who sleeps in his tailcoat but otherwise wears only a festooned drape, swims about in just one direction (\\"for fear of coming out of his neutrality\\") and gets inspired by the military muses. His career is in foreign relations, which he revolutionizes with such novel ideas as the negotiated annexation of a unidimensional, arrow-like, territory at NƒÉsƒÉud‚Äîpointed toward Luxembourg, in memory of the 1914 invasion. Gayk has an adoptive daughter, educated on his behalf by waiters, who makes her home in the fields and eventually demands access to the sea. Angered by this claim, Gayk begins a large-scale war against her; the conflict ends in a stalemate, as Gayk can no longer accessorize his marshal's uniform, and the girl has lost her supplies of gasoline and beans. The father is placated with regular gifts of feed grain, whereas the daughter is allowed a two-centimeter-wide littoral.Deligiorgis edition, p.30‚Äì37. See also Sandqvist, p.20, 230 In its subtext, \\"Emil Gayk\\" teases the irredentist ambitions of the interventionist camp, in respect to Transylvania province. Urmuz quotes a humorous slogan, circulated as a lampoon of nationalist attitudes: \\"Transylvania without the Transylvanians\\". This probably references the fact that, although Romanian by culture or ethnicity, many Transylvanian intellectuals were primarily the loyal subjects of the Habsburg Monarchy. Adrian Marino, \\"Na»õionalismul provincial\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 88, October 2001 According to CrohmƒÉlniceanu, the actual purpose is to overturn \\"ossified\\" constructs, as in the case of territorial demands which cover no real surface.CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.56 Similarly, »òerban speaks about \\"Emil Gayk\\" as a piece in which magnified \\"paltry aspects\\" and \\"anomalies\\" are supposed to send the reader into a \\"state of vigil\\". The plot of \\"Going Abroad\\" depicts someone's convoluted attempt to leave the country for good. The unnamed seven-year-old \\"he\\" in the story settles his scores with the assistance of \\"two old ducks\\" and embarks for the voyage, only to be pulled back in by \\"paternal feelings\\"; he consequently isolates himself in a tiny room, where he converts to Judaism, punishes his servants, celebrates his Silver Jubilee, and rethinks his escape. His wife, jealous of his contacts with a seal, decides against it, but offers him various parting gifts: flatbread, a kite, and a sketchbook by art teacher Borgovanu. This results in a quarrel, and the protagonist finds himself tied by the cheekbones, \\"delivered unceremoniously on dry land.\\" For a third attempt at leaving, the husband relinquishes wealth and titles, strips down and, bound with a bark rope, gallops to another town, joining the bar association.Deligiorgis edition, p.38‚Äì42 The story ends with a rhyming \\"moral\\": \\"Going Abroad\\" is possibly about Urmuz's own difficulties in deciding his own fate, transposed into a faux sample of travel literature, an example of what BalotƒÉ calls the failed homo viator (\\"human pilgrim\\") in Urmuz. =Unclassified prose= Two samples of Urmuz's prose have been traditionally seen as his secondary, less relevant, contributions. These are \\"After the Storm\\" and the posthumous \\"A Little Metaphysics and Astronomy\\". In the former, an unnamed cavalier makes his way into a grim monastery, his heart moved at the sight of a pious hen; the repentant man then finds \\"ecstasy\\" in nature, leaping through the trees or releasing captive flies. Agents of the revenue service make efforts to confiscate his tree, but the protagonist is still able to squat on one of the branches after he gives proof of naturalization, and then‚Äîswimming his way through an \\"infected pond\\"‚Äîshames his adversaries into giving up their claim. Born-again as a cynic, strengthened by his affair with the hen, he heads back to his \\"native village\\" to train folks in the \\"art of midwifery.\\"Deligiorgis edition, p.64‚Äì69. See also Sandqvist, p.223‚Äì224 According to critics, \\"After the Storm\\" should be seen as a caricature of minor Romanticism, of conventional fantasy, or of travel literature.Cernat, Avangarda, p.383 Simona Vasilache likens it to \\"an Odyssey covering some twenty lines\\", \\"a misalliance of heroism and pilferage\\" with echoes from Urmuz's hero Ion Luca Caragiale. Simona Vasilache, \\"Mica Odisee\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 22-23/2010 \\"A Little Metaphysics and Astronomy\\", which is structured like a treatise, opens with a pun on the creation narrative, postulating that God created fingerspelling before \\"the Word\\", and venturing to suggest that \\"the heavenly bodies\\", like abandoned children, are in fact nobody's creation, that their spin is really a form of attention seeking. Here, Urmuz questions the possibility of a single cause in the universe, since God's interest is in unnecessary duplications or multitudes in stars, men and fish species.Deligiorgis edition, p.92‚Äì95 Beyond the jokes on scientific pretense, Vasilache reads \\"A Little Metaphysics...\\" as a clue to Urmuz's own disillusioned worldview, which she traces back to the suicidal warnings in Urmuz's notebooks. She argues that such a melancholy and lonely diarist is in contrast with Urmuz's literary persona, as known from the Bizarre Pages. Likewise, Carmen Blaga describes the text as a sober meditation on \\"the tragic sense of history\\" and \\"the fall into temporality\\".Blaga, p.326 Among the last Urmuzian works to be discovered is \\"Cotadi and Dragomir\\". The first in the duo is a muscular but short and insect-like merchant, who wears dandruff, tortoiseshell combs, a lath armor which greatly hiders his movements, and a piano lid screwed to his buttocks. The descendant of Macedonian nobility, Cotadi feeds on ant eggs and excretes soda water, except when he corks himself to solve the \\"agrarian question\\". For fun, he lures his clients into angry conversations‚Äîthese end with him banging the piano lid, which is also a urinating wall, on the shop's floor. Dragomir is long, crooked, brownish and kind-hearted; he intervenes in the disputes between Cotadi and the more stubborn customers, imposing respect with his main prop: a cardboard contraption that extends upwards from his neck. Cotadi rewards such attentions with servings of octopus, sorb-pears and paint, granting Dragomir the right to nest inside his gate wall. They plan to be buried together, \\"in the same hole\\", with French oil as a daily supply. From such an oily grave, Cotadi hopes, an olive tree plantation may spring up, to benefit of his descendants.Deligiorgis edition, p.44‚Äì53. See also Sandqvist, p.20‚Äì21, 230 Like \\"Algazy & Grummer\\", \\"Cotadi and Dragomir\\" can be read as alluding to the triteness of business life. =\\"The Chroniclers\\"= Written in the manner of fables, but lacking any directly interpretable message, Urmuz's \\"The Chroniclers\\" referenced Aristotle, Galileo Galilei and the turn-of-the-century Balkan insurgent Boris Sarafov (Sarafoff). Its opening lines suggest that the eponymous chroniclers, for lack of baggy pants, approach someone with the surname \\"Rapaport\\" and demand to be issued passports.Ciprian, p.62; Deligiorgis edition, p.96, 97 The lyrical convention breaks down toward the end, which states: Ciprian simply discussed the piece as \\"Urmuz's idiotic lyrics\\", while CƒÉlinescu found it a \\"pure fable, on the classical canon, but nonsensical\\".CƒÉlinescu, p.888; Cernat, Avangarda, p.353 Cernat also described its \\"moral\\" as \\"empty\\" and \\"tautological\\",Cernat, Avangarda, p.191 but other critics see a hidden layer of meaning in the seemingly random cultural imagery. Ion Pop, commenting on Urmuz's hypertextuality, assumes that the \\"pelican and pouchbill\\" motif comes from a book once used as teaching aid.Cernat, Avangarda, p.391 He also suggests that the passion and hunger which ties together the various characters is in fact the thirst for freedom, for movement and for exotic settings: \\"Rapaport\\" is the Wandering Jew, Aristotle is the mentor of a great conqueror, and Galilei is invoked for his remark \\"And yet it moves\\". The mention of \\"Sarafoff\\" has been read as an indirect homage to Caragiale‚Äîwhose humorous sketches helped give Sarafov a Romanian fame. Ion Pop, \\"Avangarda rom√¢neascƒÉ, avangarda europeanƒÉ\\" , in Cuv√¢ntul, Nr. 325Cernat, Avangarda, p.372, 390 Legacy Urmuz and a copy of his writing on a 2018 postage stamp and label of Romania =Contimporanul circle= Paul Cernat notes that the Cirivi»ô's \\"posthumous destiny\\", leading to an unexpected glorification, was itself an \\"Urmuzian\\" affair. Cernat also cautions that the image of Urmuz as an absolute predecessor of Romanian modernism is \\"erroneous\\", since the experiments of Jarry, Charles Cros, Jules Laforgue, Edward Lear and others were just as important in its formative process.Cernat, Avangarda, p.341 He concludes that the avant-garde \\"apologetes\\" were projecting their own expectations into the Bizarre Pages, in which they read the antithesis of \\"High Romanticism\\", and into the writer, who became Romanian version of a po√®te maudit.Cernat, Avangarda, p.341‚Äì342, 346 Ion Pop also suggests: \\"In [Urmuz's] human destiny, and in his writing too, [the avant-garde writers] find issues which trouble them as well in prefiguring their own destinies. He satisfies the pride of those who carry on with an uncertain and anxious existence, endlessly in conflict with the world...\\" According to Andru: \\"Enthusiastic, ingenious, skeptical, rhetorical, or indecent words have been uttered about [the Bizarre Pages]. People used terms having to do with the literary revolutions of the 20th century [...]. In his pages people found themes present in all the innovating actions that gained momentum especially since 1922‚Äì1924\\". Cernat describes the growth of Urmuz's myth as similar to Early Christianity: Ciprian as a \\"prophet\\", Arghezi as a \\"baptist\\", the modernist aficionados as \\"apostles\\" and \\"converts\\".Cernat, Avangarda, p.342‚Äì351, 357 Over time, various exegetes have noted that the modernist aspects of Arghezi's prose, written after 1923, show his debt to Urmuz's absurdism and nonsense humor.CƒÉlinescu, p.690, 815; Cernat, Avangarda, p.334, 345, 348, 351, 377; CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.57; Loredana Ilie, \\"Hipotextul caragialian √Æn opera lui Tudor Arghezi\\", in the University of Ia»ôi's Philologica Jassyensia, Nr. 2/2010, p.87, 90 Arghezi's Bilete de Papagal review was also a promotional instrument for the Bizarre Pages: in 1928, continuing the Cuget Rom√¢nesc project, it circulated \\"Algazy & Grummer\\". While his role as a pre-Dadaist is up for debate, Urmuz is thought by many to have been a considerable influence on a Romanian founder of Dada, Tristan Tzara.Cernat, Avangarda, p.110, 128‚Äì129, 341, 343, 346, 367‚Äì368; Sandqvist, p.209, 227, 234‚Äì235, 248 Liviu GrƒÉsoiu, \\"Redescoperire\\", in Convorbiri Literare, December 2007 During its first years, the Romanian avant-garde would generally not mention Urmuz outside Arghezi's circle, but a surge in popularity came in stages after the European-wide impact of Dadaism, and especially after Tzara alienated some of his Romanian partners. This was the case of poet Ion Vinea and painter Marcel Janco, who together founded a modernist art magazine called Contimporanul. Late in 1924, Contimporanul teamed up with Ciprian, who gave a public reading from Urmuz during the Contimporanul International Art Exhibit.Cernat, Avangarda, p.156 The following year, Ciprian's eponymous text \\"Hurmuz\\", published in Contimporanul, listed the main claims about Urmuz's pioneering role.Cernat, Avangarda, p.342‚Äì343 Also then, the Futurist journal Punct, a close ally of Vinea and Janco, gave exposure to various unknown Urmuzian pages.Sandqvist, p.230 In December 1926, a Contimporanul editorial signed by Vinea announced to the world that Urmuz was \\"the discreet revolutionist\\" responsible for the reshaping of Europe's literary landscape: \\"Urmuz-Dada-Surrealism, these three words create a bridge, decipher a parentage, clarify the origins of the world's literary revolution in the year 1918.\\"Cernat, Avangarda, p.128‚Äì129, 343; Cornel Ungureanu, \\"Ion Vinea »ôi iubirile paralele ale poe»õilor\\", in Orizont, Nr. 5/2007, p.2 In its coverage of the international scene, the journal continued to suggest that the suicidal author had anticipated the literary fronde, for instance calling Michel Seuphor a writer \\"√† la Urmuz\\".Cernat, Avangarda, p.217 In addition to republishing some of the Bizarre Pages in its own issues, it took the initiative in making Urmuz known to an international audience: the Berlin- based magazine Der Sturm included samples from Urmuz in its special issue Romania (August‚ÄìSeptember 1930), reflecting a Contimporanul who's who list.Cernat, Avangarda, p.221, 362, 367; Grigorescu, p.389 At around the same time, poet Jen≈ë Dsida completed the integral translation of the Bizarre Pages into Hungarian. Drago»ô Varga-Santai, \\"Poezia maghiarƒÉ din Ardeal √Æn traducerea lui Kocsis Francisko\\" , in Transilvania, Nr. 11-12/2006, p.57 In his Contimporanul stage, Janco drew a notorious ink portrait of Urmuz.Sandqvist, p.226, Plate 11 In old age, the same artist completed several cycle of engravings and paintings that alluded to the Bizarre Pages.Cernat, Avangarda, p.368; Ion Pop, \\"Un 'misionar al artei noi': Marcel Iancu (II)\\" , in Tribuna, Nr. 178, February 2010, p.11; Liana Saxone-Horodi, \\"Marcel Ianco (Jancu) √Æntr-o nouƒÉ prezentare\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 571, April 2011 Vinea's own prose of the 1920s was borrowing from Urmuz's style, which it merged with newer techniques from the avant-garde groups of Europe.Cernat, Avangarda, p.181‚Äì185, 351 He followed Urmuz's deceptive \\"novel\\" genre of \\"The Funnel and Stamate\\", which also became a characteristic of works by other Contimporanul writers: Felix Aderca, F. Brunea-Fox, Filip Corsa, Sergiu Dan and Romulus Dianu.Cernat, Avangarda, p.194‚Äì198 In addition, Jacques G. Costin, who moved between Contimporanul and the international Dada scene, was for long thought an imitator of Urmuz's style.CƒÉlinescu, p.906; Cernat, Avangarda, p.187, 189‚Äì191, 398; CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.570; Ion Pop, \\"Exerci»õiile lui Jacques G.

Its main contributors, including PanƒÉ, Geo Bogza, Ilarie Voronca, Ion CƒÉlugƒÉru, Moldov and Stephan Roll, were all Urmuz enthusiasts from the far left.CƒÉlinescu, p.889; Cernat, Avangarda, p.322, 331, 335, 339, 344, 345‚Äì346, 347, 348, 349, 382, 404; Ion Pop, \\"Moldov, pe urmele lui Urmuz\\" , in Tribuna, Nr. 166, August 2009, p.11, 15 In 1930, PanƒÉ collected and published as a volume the complete works of Urmuz: titled Algazy & Grummer, it notably included \\"The Fuchsiad\\".Cernat, Avangarda, p.343, 344; CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.55, 570, 640 PanƒÉ and Bogza visited the unpublished archive, which gave them a chance to acknowledge, but also to silence, the more conventional and antisemitic Urmuz revealed through the aphorisms. These manuscripts were kept in possession by the PanƒÉ family, and exhibited in 2009. Bogza was previously editor of a short-lived magazine named Urmuz, published in C√¢mpina with support from poet Alexandru Tudor-Miu, and keeping contact with other Urmuzian circles: it was saluted by Arghezi and published a drawing portrait of Urmuz (probably Marcel Janco's). Bogza's first editorial piece proclaimed: \\"Urmuz lives. His presence among us whips to lash our consciousness.\\" Later, in unus inaugural art manifesto, Bogza described his suicidal mentor as \\"The Forerunner\\".Cernat, Avangarda, p.331, 346. See also Sandqvist, p.372‚Äì373, 375 Others in this group incorporated \\"Urmuzian\\" metamorphoses into their technique and, at that stage, the Bizarre Pages were also imitated in style by PanƒÉ's sister, Magdalena \\"Madda Holda\\" Binder, influencing stories by PanƒÉ's young follower Sesto Pals Michael Finkenthal, \\"Sesto Pals, dialoguri √Æntre √Æntuneric »ôi luminƒÉ\\", in Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Nr. 11-12/2009 and novels by the isolated Surrealist H.

Simona Vasilache, \\"Unicate\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 28/2008 After the Contimporanul group split and a young generation reassimilated modernism into a spiritualistic framework (TrƒÉirism), critic Lucian Boz was the first professional to find no fault with the Bizarre Pages, and made Urmuz interesting for mainstream and elitist criticism.Cernat, Avangarda, p.330‚Äì331, 333, 334, 339, 346, 347‚Äì348 Between the unu Surrealists and Boz's version of modernism were figures such as Ion Biberi (who popularized Urmuz in France)Cernat, Avangarda, p.330, 404 and Marcel Avramescu. Avramescu (better known then as Ionathan X. Uranus) was notably inspired by Urmuz's pre-Dadaist prose, which he sometimes imitated.Cernat, Avangarda, p.333, 344‚Äì345, 346, 347; CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.570 Marian Victor Buciu, \\"Un avangardist dincoace de ariergardƒÉ\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 17/2006 Ion Pop, \\"Un urmuzian: Ionathan X.

Absurd »ôi suprarealism ‚Äì o √ÆngemƒÉnare ineditƒÉ\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 354, January 2007 The early 1930s also brought the publication of several new works of memoirs mentioning Demetrescu-BuzƒÉu, including texts by Cruceanu and Vasile Voiculescu‚Äîthe latter was also the first to mention Urmuz on Romanian Radio (January 1932);Cernat, Avangarda, p.344, 346 another such Radio homage was later authored by PanƒÉ. The channels of communication once opened, Urmuz came to be discussed with unexpected sympathy by Perpessicius, CƒÉlinescu and other noted cultural critics, consolidating his reputation as a writer.Cernat, Avangarda, p.321‚Äì323, 331, 339, 344, 346‚Äì354 CƒÉlinescu's attitude was particularly relevant: the condescending but popularizing portrayal of Urmuz, which became part of CƒÉlinescu's 1941 companion to Romanian literature (Urmuz's earliest mention in such a synthesis), was first sketched in his literary magazine Capricorn (December 1930) and his 1938 university lectures.Cernat, Avangarda, p.344, 346, 350‚Äì353 Although he confessed an inability to view Demetrescu-BuzƒÉu as a real writer, CƒÉlinescu preferred him over traditionalism, and, critics note, even allowed the Bizarre Pages to influence his own work as novelist.Cernat, Avangarda, p.350, 352‚Äì355 Meanwhile, a blunt negation of Urmuz's contribution was restated by the academic figure Pompiliu Constantinescu, who nevertheless commented favorably on the writer's \\"ingeniousness\\".Cernat, Avangarda, p.344, 349 Eugen Lovinescu, another mainstream literary theorist, angered the avant- garde by generally ignoring Urmuz, but made note of Ciprian's readings \\"from Hurmuz's repertoire\\" at the SburƒÉtorul literary sessions.Cernat, Avangarda, p.348 Urmuz may have acted as a direct or indirect influence of mainstream authors of fiction, one case being that of satirist Tudor Mu»ôatescu.Cernat, Avangarda, p.323 Similar observations were made regarding the work of modern novelists Ani»ôoara Odeanu Bianca Bur»õa-Cernat, \\"√énainte de Ionesco\\", in Revista 22, Nr. 1020, September 2009; Cernat, Avangarda, p.345 or Anton Holban. Daniel Dragomirescu, \\"Modernismul lui Anton Holban\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 38/2008 =The Drake's Head= By the late 1930s, Ciprian had also established himself as a leading modernist dramatist and director, with plays such as The Man and His Mule. Although his work in the field is described as the product of 1920s Expressionist theater,Cernat, Avangarda, p.271; Grigorescu, p.423‚Äì424 he was sometimes branded a plagiarist of his dead friend's writings. This claim was traced back to Arghezi, and was probably a publicity stunt meant to increase Urmuz's exposure,Cernat, Avangarda, p.342, 344‚Äì345. See also CƒÉlinescu, p.921 but taken with seriousness by another opinion maker, journalist Constantin Beldie. Z. Ornea, \\"DezvƒÉluirile lui Constantin Beldie\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 46/2000 The ensuing scandal was amplified by the young Dadaists and Surrealists, who took the rumor to be true: Avramescu-Uranus, himself accused of plagiarizing Urmuz, made an ironic reference to this fact in a 1929 contribution to Bilete de Papagal.Cernat, Avangarda, p.344‚Äì345 Unwittingly, Arghezi's allegations cast a shadow of doubt on Ciprian's overall work for the stage. The Drake's HeadSummarized in Ciprian, p.373‚Äì411 was Ciprian's personal homage to the pahuci: it shows a grown-up Cirivi»ô, the main protagonist, returning from a trip abroad and reuniting with his cronies during an overnight party. The Drake's Head brotherhood spends the small hours of the morning bullying passers-by, chasing them \\"like birds of prey\\" and pestering them with absurd proposals. Quite jaded and interested in wrecking the very \\"pillars of logic\\", Cirivi»ô convinces his friends to follow him on a more daring stunt: trespassing private property, they take over an apple tree and treat it as a new home. Claiming that land ownership only covers the actual horizontal plane, they even strike out an agreement with the stupefied owner. Nevertheless, a pompous and indignant \\"Bearded Gentleman\\" takes up the cause of propriety and incites the Romanian Police to intervene. The play premiered in early 1940. The original cast included Nicolae BƒÉltƒÉ»õeanu as Cirivi»ô and Ion Finte»ôteanu as Macferlan, with additional appearances by Ion Manu, Eugenia Popovici, Chiril Economu.Ciprian, p.261‚Äì261, 408‚Äì410 Cernat sees The Drake's Head as a sample of Urmuzian mythology: \\"Cirivi»ô [...] is shown as a quasi-mythological figure, the boss of a parodic-subversive fellowship which seeks to rehabilitate a poetic, innocent, apparently absurd freedom\\". According to Cernat, it remains Ciprian's only truly \\"nonconformist\\" play, particularly since it is indebted to \\"the absurd Urmuzian comedy\\".Cernat, Avangarda, p.271 Some have identified the \\"Bearded Gentleman\\" as Nicolae Iorga, the traditionalist culture critic‚Äîthe claim was later dismissed as mere \\"innuendo\\" by Ciprian, who explained that his creation stood for all \\"demagogue\\" politicians of the day.Ciprian, p.408, 410‚Äì411 =Communist ban and diaspora recovery= Upon the end of World War II, Romania came under communist rule, and a purge of interwar modernist values followed: Urmuz's works were among the many denied imprimatur by the 1950s. Before communist censorship became complete, Urmuz still found disciples in the last wave of the avant-garde. Cited examples include Geo Dumitrescu,Cernat, Avangarda, p.381‚Äì382 Dimitrie Stelaru Veronica- Alina ConstƒÉnceanu, \\"Dimitrie Stelaru, dramaturg\\", in Orizont, Nr. 11/2009, p.11 and Constant Tonegaru. Daniel Vighi, \\"Constant Tonegaru √Æn note de curs\\", in Orizont, Nr. 11/2010, p.21 Also at the time, writer Dinu Pillat donated a batch of Urmuz's manuscripts to the Romanian Academy Library.Cernat, Avangarda, p.381 The anti-Urmuzian current, part of a larger anti-modernist campaign, found an unexpected backer in George CƒÉlinescu, who became a fellow traveler of communism. In his new interpretation, the Bizarre Pages were depicted as farcical and entirely worthless.Cernat, Avangarda, p.354‚Äì356 For a while, the Bizarre Pages were only cultivated by the Romanian diaspora. Having discovered the book in interwar Romania, the dramatist and culture critic Eug√®ne Ionesco made it his mission to highlight the connections between Urmuz and European modernism. Ionesco's work for the stage, a major contribution to the international Theater of the Absurd movement, consciously drew upon various sources, including the Romanians Ion Luca Caragiale and Urmuz. The contextual importance of such influences, which remain relatively unknown to Ionesco's international audience, has been assessed differently by the various exegetes,Lucian Boia, Romania: Borderland of Europe, Reaktion Books, London, 2001, p.261. ; Cernat, Avangarda, p.345, 356, 358, 365; Martine Dancer, \\"Desenele de atelier »ôi 'universul' operei\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 100, January 2002; Gelu Ionescu, \\"Ionescu/Ionesco\\", in Apostrof, Nr. 12/2006; Ion Pop, \\"Eugen Ionescu »ôi avangarda rom√¢neascƒÉ\\", in Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Nr. 1-2/2010; »òtefana Pop-Cur»ôeu, \\"Eug√®ne Ionesco cel rom√¢nesc √Æn viziune occidentalƒÉ\\" , in Tribuna, Nr. 175, December 2009, p.7; Ion Vianu, \\"Ionesco, a»ôa cum l-am cunoscut (evocare)\\", in Revista 22, Nr. 1029, November 2009 Gabriela Melinescu, \\"Absurdul ca un catharsis\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 17/2007 as Ionesco himself once stated: \\"Nothing in Romanian literature has ever truly influenced me.\\" Thanks to Ionesco's intervention, Urmuz's works saw print in Les Lettres Nouvelles journal.Cernat, Avangarda, p.404; Geo »òerban, \\"Mic »ôi necesar adaos\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 315, April 2006 Allegedly, his attempt to publish Urmuz's work with √âditions Gallimard was sabotaged by Tristan Tzara, who may have feared that previous claims about his absolute originality would come under revision.Cernat, Avangarda, p.110, 367‚Äì368 Upon translating Urmuz's writings, Ionesco also drafted the essay Urmuz ou l'Anarchiste (\\"Urmuz or the Anarchist\\", ca. 1950), with a new drawing of Urmuz by Dimitrie V√¢rbƒÉnescu (Guy L√©vis Mano collection).Monica Breazu, \\"Un manuscris inedit de Eugen Ionescu √Æn arhivele editorului Guy L√©vis Mano\\", in Magazin Istoric, January 2010, p.17‚Äì18 The entirety of Urmuz's work was republished in English by writer Miron Grindea and his wife Carola, in ADAM Review (1967, the same year when new German translations were published in Munich's Akzente journal).Cernat, Avangarda, p.368 From his new home in Hawaii, Romanian writer »òtefan Baciu, whose own poetry borrows from Urmuz, Simona Sora, \\"Poezia unui »ôpri»õ la ghea»õƒÉ\\" , in Dilema Veche, Nr. 133, August 2006 further popularized the Bizarre Pages with Boz's assistance.Cernat, Avangarda, p.368; Ilie Rad, \\"Scrisorile din exil ale lui Lucian Boz\\" , in Contemporanul, Nr. 11/2009, p.35 Another figure of the anti-communist diaspora, Monica Lovinescu, adopted Urmuzian aesthetics in some of her satirical essays.

It tried to reconnect with modernism, and in the process rediscovered Urmuz. Inside the meta- and autofictional group known as the T√¢rgovi»ôte School, Urmuz's style was mainly perpetuated by Mircea Horia Simionescu.Cernat, Avangarda, p.345, 356; \\"M.H.S. »ôi Comedia Lumii pe Dos\\" , in Cuv√¢ntul, Nr. 378; Alin Croitoru, \\"Cum se face roman\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 171, June 2003 Lumini»õa Marcu, \\"Poezii cu dichis de Pavel »òu»ôarƒÉ\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 70, June 2001 The Bizarre Pages also inspired some other writers in the same group: Radu Petrescu, Costache OlƒÉreanuCernat, Avangarda, p.345, 356, 383‚Äì384; Dan PƒÉtra»ôcu, \\"Sinuciderea din GrƒÉdina BotanicƒÉ de Radu Petrescu sau memorialul oniric al realitƒÉ»õii\\", in the Vasile Goldi»ô West University of Arad Studii de »òtiin»õƒÉ »ôi CulturƒÉ, Nr. 2 (21), June 2010, p.191; Ioan Stanomir, \\"Un fantezist seducƒÉtor\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 3/1999 and the Bessarabian-born Tudor »öopa.

Such events heralded a revival of scholarly interest in proto-Dadaism, beginning with a 1970 monograph on Urmuz, by the Sibiu Literary Circle member Nicolae BalotƒÉ.Blaga, p.323; Cernat, Avangarda, p.346, 357, 365‚Äì366 Also then, PanƒÉ was free to circulate a new revised edition of his interwar anthology, reissued in collaboration with Editura Minerva.Cernat, Avangarda, p.357; CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.640 Ion Bogdan Lefter, \\"Urmuz √Æn trei tipuri de edi»õii\\", in Apostrof, Nr. 4/2010 It was later completed by an Urmuz corpus, which notably hosted the scattered diaries, as recovered by critic Gheorghe Glodeanu. In 1972, Iordan Chimet also included \\"The Chroniclers\\" in a nonconformist anthology of youth literature. Marina Debattista, \\"Subversiunea inocen»õei\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 22/2007 In those years, the Bizarre Pages also inspired critically acclaimed illustrations by Nestor Ignat Daria Ghiu, \\"Nestor Ignat: realitatea √ÆntoarsƒÉ pe dos\\", in Revista 22, Nr. 1094, February 2011 and Ion Mincu, and the multimedia event CumpƒÉnƒÉ (\\"Watershed\\") by composer Anatol Vieru.Cernat, Avangarda, p.389 With the 1960s, a national-communist ideology was officially established in Romania, and this encouraged the rise of \\"Protochronism\\" as a cultural phenomenon. The Protochronists exaggerated past Romanian achievements, and magnified previous claims about the folkloric roots of Urmuz's literature. Some Protochronists also described a positive, jocular, \\"village idiot\\" Urmuz, more presentable than Europe's misanthropic avant-garde.Cernat, Avangarda, p.357‚Äì358, 369, 372‚Äì377, 385‚Äì388, 404 A leading representative of this trend was literary theorist Edgar Papu, who exaggerated Vinea and Ionesco's homage to Urmuz and Caragiale to argue that Romania was the actual origin of Europe's avant-garde movements.Cernat, Avangarda, p.358‚Äì359, 373, 387; MihƒÉilescu, p.145‚Äì146 The idea proved popular beyond Protochronism, and was arguably found in essays by Nichita StƒÉnescu and Marin Mincu.Cernat, Avangarda, p.359, 360, 373‚Äì376 Many Europeanist intellectuals rejected Protochronism, but, in their bid of making Urmuz palatable to cultural officials, often interpreted him strictly through the grid of Marxist humanism (as used by BalotƒÉ, Matei CƒÉlinescu or Nicolae Manolescu).Cernat, Avangarda, p.364‚Äì366, 377, 385, 404 A third camp, comprising more or less vehement opponents of Urmuz, joined the literary debates after 1970; it includes Alexandru George, Gelu Ionescu, Alexandru Piru and Marin Ni»õescu.Cernat, Avangarda, p.361, 378‚Äì382 Some years later, Romania witnessed the birth of the Optzeci»ôti generation, whose interest was in recovering Caragiale, Urmuz and the 1930s avant-garde as its models to follow, and who reactivated corrosive humor as a way of fighting oppression.MihƒÉilescu, p.215, 234 Among the individual Optzeci»ôti who took special inspiration from the Bizarre Pages are Mircea CƒÉrtƒÉrescu, Octavian Soviany, \\"A doua carte a nostalgiei\\" , in Cuv√¢ntul, Nr. 327 Nichita Danilov, Adina Dini»õoiu, \\"Goana dupƒÉ metafizica literaturii\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 411, February 2008; Horia G√¢rbea, \\"Monolog politic √Æn tramvaiul 5\\", in LuceafƒÉrul, Nr. 7/2008; Alex. »òtefƒÉnescu, \\"Nichita Danilov, poet »ôi prozator\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 10/2008; Eugenia »öarƒÉlungƒÉ, \\"Miscellanea.

Aside from performing for charity, the concert was an attempt to honor the first responders from the New York City Fire Department and New York City Police Department, their families, and those lost in the attacks and those who had worked in the ongoing rescue and recovery efforts in the weeks since that time. The concert was organised by Paul McCartney and included many legendary British contemporaries, including The Who, David Bowie, Elton John, Eric Clapton and Rolling Stones bandmates Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. American artists included Bon Jovi, Jay-Z, Destiny's Child, the Backstreet Boys, James Taylor, Billy Joel, Melissa Etheridge, Five for Fighting, Goo Goo Dolls, John Mellencamp with Kid Rock, and a humorous performance by Adam Sandler as \\"Operaman\\". Paul Shaffer acted as Musical Director for the show and various celebrities and political figures including Howard Stern and Rudy Giuliani appeared between the acts. Many athletes also appeared between the acts including Joe Torre, whose Yankees were on their way to competing in their fourth consecutive World Series. The concert also included several short films made by New York City's most notable filmmakers such as Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee, and Kevin Smith. Over 60 stars that participated in the concert signed unique memorabilia backstage at Madison Square Garden that were later auctioned off to support the Robin Hood Foundation. The autographed items included three large posters of the concert and three customized 24\\" drumheads. Other items included a complete drumset and guitar. Audience reaction Much of the crowd itself was extremely emotional, with victims' family members and colleagues holding up portraits of the dead. Two speakers were booed: actress Susan Sarandon (for plugging New York mayoralty candidate Mark Green), and actor Richard Gere (for speaking about non-violent tolerance). Gere did acknowledge the crowd's jeering at his pacifist stance, stating, \\"That's apparently unpopular right now, but that's all right.\\" Repeat broadcasts and the DVD version of the concert were digitally edited to remove the booing and replace it with dubbed cheering for Hillary Clinton.Booing of Hillary Transformed into Applause Adam Sandler's appearance as Operaman was a comic highlight of the evening. He sang a humorous song about the greatness of New York City, the end of Rudy Giuliani's term as mayor, the New York Yankees who were in the middle of playing in the 2001 ALCS, the musical acts that preceded him on stage (in which he mentioned that Destiny's Child gave him a \\"bone-ah\\"), and Osama bin Laden's cowardice, including the line \\"Osama says he's tough, Osama says he's brave/Then tell me why Osama is shitting in a cave!\\" Musically, the audience responded most fervently to The Who, roaring as they came on stage with a roiling \\"Who Are You\\", drowning out the band on the famous \\"It's only teenage wasteland\\" refrain of \\"Baba O'Riley,\\" and reaching a peak of excitement with \\"Won't Get Fooled Again.\\" The backdrop for the band consisted of an American flag alongside a British flag, showing solidarity. Vocalist Roger Daltrey's final words to the crowd of first responders and their families were: \\"We could never follow what you did.\\" Forbes described The Who‚Äôs performance as a \\"catharsis\\" for the law enforcement in attendance. This performance would turn out to be bassist John Entwistle's final performance in America with The Who; he died of a heart attack only eight months later. Multi-instrumentalist Jon Carin, who had worked with the band during the group's 1996‚Äì1997 tours, played keyboards in place of longtime keyboardist John \\"Rabbit\\" Bundrick. Other highlights included David Bowie's opening tandem of Paul Simon's \\"America\\" and his own \\"Heroes\\", dedicated to his local ladder company, and New York's own Billy Joel's \\"Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)\\" where Joel says after singing it, \\"I wrote that song 25 years ago, I thought it was gonna be a science fiction song. I never thought it would really happen. But unlike the end of that song...we ain't going anywhere!\\" Elton John's sentimental \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\" was also well received, among other performances. After The Who's performance, FDNY firefighter Mike Moran spoke to the audience, explaining that his brother was killed on 9/11, and that the victims would not be forgotten. He ended by saying \\"In the spirit of the Irish people, Osama bin Laden, you can kiss my royal, Irish ass!\\" which was met with wild cheering and applause. Moran removed his cap and concluded with, \\"This is my face, bitch!\\" which was, again, met with cheers from the crowd. When Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey, the two surviving members of The Who, were given the Kennedy Center Honors in December 2008 for their contributions to American culture, a tribute performance of \\"Baba O'Riley\\" was delivered by Rob Thomas. In the end refrain of \\"teenage wasteland\\", a full choir of FDNY firemen was revealed behind a curtain - bellowing the refrain - in gratitude for The Who's performance at The Concert for New York City, seven years prior.

The film was first shown during The Concert for New York City. The film consists purely of cell-phone conversation snippets of twenty-two random people walking through the streets of New York City. Ranging from complainers to neurotic worriers conversing about bizarre or amusing situations, they and their comments are unrelated to one another. The film ends with a message from Woody Allen: \\"I love this town.\\" John Cusack introduced the film with a message from Woody Allen: \\"I apologize in advance for my short movie. The cause was so worthwhile that I could not say no when approached to contribute something to this wonderful show. I did the best I could. If you hate it, I will try to make it up to you somehow in the future.\\" In addition to longtime Allen collaborators Marshall Brickman and Tony Roberts, among the people seen in the film are Austin Pendleton, Griffin Dunne, Michael Emerson, Bebe Neuwirth, and Celia Weston. Critical reaction In 2004 Rolling Stone magazine selected this concert, along with the earlier America: A Tribute to Heroes telethon, as one of the 50 moments that changed rock and roll. It was also voted the #4 greatest moment in the history of Madison Square Garden. On December 7, 2008, Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey of The Who received Kennedy Center Honors from the President of the United States, and after several musicians performed their music, the finale was a surprise chorus of New York City police officers and rescue personnel who had been touched by their performance.John Clarke, \\"Dave Grohl, Chris Cornell Pay Tribute to the Who at Kennedy Center\\", Rolling Stone, December 8, 2008.

It has been licensed in the U.S. by Media Blasters and was released on VHS in 1999, on DVD in 2001 and on Blu-ray in 2020. Synopsis The story is centered on Natsumi, a young student from Japan who gains the powers of Mii, the well-endowed fertility goddess of a tribal culture. Natsumi and her friends must save the Earth from ultimate destruction by a \\"god of ruin\\". Characters ; : : Natsumi is a ten-year-old schoolgirl who is given an ancient sculpture by her father. In a dream, the God of Earth, Ahem, appears before her and teaches her a special dance that allows her to transform into the beautiful spirit known as Mii (pronounced \\"May\\" in the dub). : Through a very bouncy and suggestive dance, Natsumi can transform into the voluptuous , a spirit of flowers, fertility, and reproduction. Her large breasts represent and contain Earth's life-giving energy. Mii can also enlarge her whole body to giant size when needed, which causes her breasts to grow larger proportionally as she does in size. ; : (Japanese); Mona Marshall (English good Ongo); Lex Lang (English bad Ongo) : Ongo is the spirit of wood and destruction. Thousands of years ago, he was engaged to the water spirit Rongo, but then the evil inside of him awakened. He then went on a vicious rampage of destruction in the heart of New Guinea, only to be stopped by the beautiful flower spirit Mii, who sacrificed herself to imprison him. In 2009 Fuyuhiko Rokudo, an archaeologist unknowingly brought his statuette prison back to Japan as a gift for his daughter, Natsumi. : Upon his release, Ongo was revealed to be a little pygmy and he began to cause all sorts of mischief. Later he became the destroyer again, but Mii defeated him by comforting him with her breasts. : Ongo's powers include being able to summon anything through wood, and as the destroyer he can fire bolts of energy out of his mouth as well as his hands, and extend his claws into long blades. ; : (Japanese); Stevie Bloch (English little Rongo); Barbara Goodson (English normal Rongo) : Rongo is Ahem's daughter, the water spirit. Centuries ago she was engaged to Ongo until he became evil and they were split up. Then in 2009, Rongo spotted Ongo in Tokyo with Mii. Believing Mii had taken the form of a 10-year-old and taken Ongo for herself, Rongo took over the body of Natsumi's friend Nami, and tried to remove her skull necklace only to receive an electric shock. : Then upon doing a dance, Rongo showed herself and attacked Natsumi with water, and when Ongo showed up, Rongo was horrified that he didn't remember her. So Rongo challenged Natsumi to a duel and, after almost shooting a fighter jet down with jets of water, Natsumi tried to stop Rongo, but due to interference by Ongo, Rongo was transformed into a smaller child version of herself. Only then did Ongo remember her. Having lost her powers, Rongo requested to stay with Natsumi. : When Ongo became evil and giant again, Rongo tried to stop him, but eventually she left it up to Mii. Rongo's powers include being able to control all forms of water. ; : : Nami Kuki is Natsumi's newest friend. She is a shy soft-spoken and strange girl, Nami is into things like magic and UFOs. Her dream is to obtain New Guinean magic and take over the world. When Natsumi takes Nami to the museum to look at the artifacts her dad brought back, Nami gets possessed by Rongo - who thinks Natsumi has stolen Ongo from her. Rongo soon was defeated though and gives Nami back, but the two can still bond together when Nami does her own dance of transformation. ; : : Ahem is the spirit of earth and according to rumor, Mii's ex-husband. When Natsumi inadvertently breaks the seal of Ongo's prison, Ahem appears to her in a dream and gives her Mii's necklace. He then demonstrates a perverted dance which he says will protect Natsumi in times of danger. This dance in fact unleashes the spirit of Mii, and gives Natsumi all of her powers. When Ongo became evil again, Ahem destroyed the evil spirit inside him. : Ahem's powers seem to be the ability to destroy evil with his spear, and to enlarge the spear into a pole. ; : : Takuma Kusanagi is one of Natsumi's friends. Although she hangs out with him a lot, she is disgusted with his perverted attitude. This gets worse when Mii shows up and he becomes infatuated with her. He also has frequent conflicts with his father. ; : : Fuyuhiko Rokudo is Natsumi's dad who's an archaeologist. He brought back the statuette from New Guinea with the two gems that had Ongo trapped in them. Natsumi is upset that he still treats her like a little girl, instead of a young woman. ; : : Haruka Rokudo is Natsumi's mother who's a very devoted housewife. ; : : Manami Izumikawa is the grade's class president and a classmate of Natsumi and Takuma. She has been freaked out by all the weird occurrences that have been going on. ; : : Itsuki Kusanagi is Takuma's dad. He owns an antique shop. Itsuki wishes his son would treat him with more respect, and the two of them fight constantly over petty things.

It also has a medieval parish church. St Mary's Church (overlooking Carisbrooke High Street with views to the castle), began life as part of a Benedictine priory, established by French monks about 1150. The priory was dissolved by King Henry V of England in 1415 during the French Wars. Neglect over the centuries took its toll, but in 1907 the church was restored to its full glory. Its most striking feature is the 14th century tower, rising in five stages with a turret at one corner and a battlemented and pinnacled crown. There is a Roman Villa discovered in the Victorian era on the site of the old vicarage. Transport It is served by Southern Vectis buses operating to Freshwater, Newport, Yarmouth and Ventnor, as well as some smaller villages. It was served by nearby Carisbrooke railway station until it closed in 1953. It is the starting point of the Tennyson Trail, leading to Alum Bay. Local Amenities View of the village from the castle ramparts It has two pubs - the Waverley and the Eight Bells, a caf√©, an Italian restaurant and a motorcycle dealership. There are several shops on the High Street. The village has four schools, three of which are along Wellington Road. These are Carisbrooke CE Primary School, Christ the King College (formerly Archbishop King Roman Catholic Middle and Trinity CE Middle Schools) and Carisbrooke College. The fourth school is St Thomas of Canterbury Roman Catholic Primary School, which is on Carisbrooke High Street next to the doctors surgery. There are allotments, next to the ford in Castle Street. History Carisbrooke Church Carisbrooke was for centuries the island 's capital and was once called Buccombe or Beaucombe, and means the ' fair valley'. The Governor of Newport once lived at Landscape House, at the upper part of Carisbrooke High Street in the Victorian era. Alexander Ross, prolific Scottish writer and controversialist, was vicar of Carisbrooke from 1634 until his death in 1654. The site of the old Carisbrooke railway station lies on the grounds of Christ the King College in the lower part of the field, which is at the end of Purdy Road. The bank is all that remains of the old line. When in 1917 the British royal family changed its name from the \\"House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha\\" to the \\"House of Windsor\\" and renounced all German titles, the title of Marquess of Carisbrooke was created for the erstwhile German Prince Alexander of Battenberg. Carisbrooke Castle Carisbrooke Castle was originally a Roman fort. The castle is at the top of Castle Hill. It was built soon after William the Conqueror came to England. The William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford may have been responsible for its construction, but he was killed in battle during 1071 and so would have had little opportunity to oversee the construction. Osbern's son, Roger, is more likely to have built or refortified the castle. It was at Carisbrooke Castle that William arrested his own half brother, Odo for acts of treason. King Henry I of England granted the castle in the first year of his reign to Richard de Redvers. The Redvers family owned the castle for much of the Medieval period, only ending in November 1293 when the last Redvers, Isabel died. In 1136, Baldwin de Redvers took refuge in the castle on the run from King Stephen of England. The wells on the island ran dry and Baldwin gave up the land in exchange for his head. Baldwin's land was restored to him in 1153 when Henry II became king. Baldwin, the last male in the line, died in 1216 poisoned, it is said by Peter II of Savoy. Isabella de Fortibus, Baldwin's sister took control of the castle and successfully ran it until her death in 1293. After the death of Isabella de Fortibus in 1293 the castle became the property of Edward I and the crown. In 1355 Edward III granted the ownership of the castle to his daughter Isabel. In 1377 The French landed on the Isle of Wight and attacked Carisbrooke castle. The castle did not fall to the French. Later in 1647 Charles I took refuge at Carisbrooke but the castle later turned out to be his prison from where he attempted several times to escape but failed. His daughter princess Elizabeth later died there aged 14. It later became the royal residence of Princess Beatrice the 9th daughter of Queen Victoria who put in the gardens which have been recently restored. She established the museum in the centre of the bailey.

Early life The son of Aleksy Dawidowski, an engineering technologist and Janina Dawidowska (n√©e Sagatowska), who worked in chemical engineering, Maciej Aleksy Dawidowski graduated from the Stefan Batory Warsaw Gymnasium. He was active in the Polish Boy Scout movement. In the fall of 1939 Dawidowski's father was the administrative director of a rifle factory in Warsaw. Following the German occupation of Warsaw in late September 1939, the senior Dawidowski was arrested in November 1939, and on December 1939 the father was shot in the Sejm Gardens. Resistance work In 1939 the younger Davidowski was a member of PLAN, in 1940 he became a member of Szare Szeregi (the underground organization of Polish Boy Scouts) and Wawer. He took part in several sabotage actions against the Nazi forces, among others.

Trinculo in The Tempest, the First Grave-digger in Hamlet and Marplot in Susanna Centlivre's The Busybody, were among his many favourite parts. He is said to have been a friend of Hogarth. In 1715 he appeared on bills promoting a performance on the last day of April, where he played Young Clincher in Farquhar's comedy, The Constant Couple. On 25 April 1717 he played Sir Joseph Whittol in William Congreve's \\"Old Batchelor\\". Tickets for this performance were adorned by a design by William Hogarth showing the scene where Whittol's friend Captain Bluffe is kicked by Sharper whilst his friend Bellmour tries to pull him away. This is described as a \\"very valuable engraving\\" in 1868. This ticket design was used for Joe Millers benefit performance on 13 April 1738.Robert Chambers, Book of Days, 15 Aug In \\"vacation periods\\" between working at Drury Lane, he performed for William Pinkethman's company. He frequented the \\"Black Jack\\" tavern on Portsmouth Street in London, which was a favourite of the Drury Lane players and those from Lincoln's Inn Fields. Allegedly he was very serious in the bar and this led to an in-joke whereby all his companions ascribed all new jokes to him. His final performance was on 13 April 1738. On his death on 15 August he was buried at St Clement Danes on Portugal Street, London. This churchyard was later built over by King's College Hospital. The grave is therefore lost. Joe Miller's Jests After Miller's death, John Mottley (1692‚Äì1750) brought out a book called Joe Miller's Jests, or the Wit's Vade- Mecum (1739), published under the pseudonym of Elijah Jenkins Esq. at the price of one shilling. This was a collection of contemporary and ancient coarse witticisms, only three of which are told of Miller. This first edition was a thin pamphlet of 247 numbered jokes. This ran to three editions in its first year. Later (not wholly connected) versions were entitled with names such as \\"Joe Miller's Joke Book\\", and \\"The New Joe Miller\\" to latch onto the popularity of both Joe Miller himself and the popularity of Mottley's first book. Joke books of this format (i.e. \\"Mr Smith's Jests\\") were common even before this date. It was common practice to learn one or two jokes for use at parties etc. Owing to the quality of the jokes in Mottley's book, their number increasing with each of the many subsequent editions, any time-worn jest came to be called \\"a Joe Miller\\", a Joe-Millerism, or simply a Millerism. Joke 99 states: Joke 234 speaks of: Other references to Miller Joe Miller was referred to in Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol (1843), by the character Scrooge, who remarks \\"Joe Miller never made such a joke as sending [the turkey] to Bob's will be!\\" Dickens also references Joe-Millerism in Sketches by Boz, in chapter 1 of The Boarding-house. George Grossmith and Weedon Grossmith's 1892 comic novel, The Diary of a Nobody also makes reference to Joe Miller when Lupin, son of the chief protagonist and diary writer, Mr. Pooter, sarcastically states, \\"Bravo Joe Miller\\" in response to one of Mr. Pooter's failed jokes. Joe Miller was also referred to in James Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" (1922) in the limerick that Lenehan whispers during the Aeolus episode to Stephen Dedalus, the last line of which is \\"I can't see the Joe Miller. Can you?\\". Isaac Asimov refers to Joe Miller's joke book on page 552 of Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare. The work is used in his explanation of Beatrice's barb toward Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing-- Act II, scene i, lines 128-130. According to Leonard Feinberg, the 1734 edition contains one of the oldest examples of gallows humor.Leonard Feinberg The secret of humor p.159 References ;Sources * * External links  * Peter Young, The Data Book of Joe Miller Jokes, . * Joe Miller's Jests or the Wits Vade-Mecum.

Raisuli, leader of several hill tribes, demanded a ransom of $70,000, safe conduct, and control of two of Morocco's wealthiest districts from Sultan Abdelaziz of Morocco. During lengthy negotiations, he increased his demands to control of six districts. Born in Greece in 1840 to the American ambassador and his wife, Perdicaris grew up mostly in New Jersey in the United States and was an American citizen. He had been living in Tangier since the 1870s. President Theodore Roosevelt felt obliged to react on his behalf in Morocco. Ultimately, he dispatched seven warships and several Marine companies to Tangier to convince the Sultan to accede to Raisuli's demands. Western European nations also reacted with force, with the United Kingdom, France, and Spain sending ships to back up the US in Morocco. John Hay, the American Secretary of State, issued a statement to the Republican National Convention in June 1904 that \\"This government wants Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead.\\" Roosevelt's display of force in this incident is credited with helping the incumbent president win re-election later in 1904. After being released, Perdicaris moved with his family to England, settling in Tunbridge Wells.  Background  Ion Perdicaris' father, Gregory Perdicaris, was sponsored in 1826 as a young Greek to study in the United States by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Perdicaris became a naturalized citizen of the US, and married the daughter of a wealthy family in South Carolina. In 1837 he returned to Greece, serving as the American ambassador. In 1840, his son Ion Perdicaris was born in Athens, Greece, while his father was serving as ambassador. The family returned to the United States in 1846, where the father at one time was a professor of Greek at Harvard University. The family settled in Trenton, New Jersey, where Gregory Perdicaris became wealthy as one of the organizers of the Trenton Gas Company. The city was growing as an industrial center. For many years, the son Ion lived the life of a dilettante. He entered the Harvard University class of 1860 but left at the end of his sophomore year and studied in Europe for a time. In 1862, because of the American Civil War, the family's property in South Carolina was in danger of confiscation by the government of the Confederate States of America. The younger Perdicaris traveled to Greece, intending to renounce his United States citizenship and acquire Greek nationality in order to avoid confiscation or being drafted into the Confederate States Army.' This did not protect his property, and he left Athens. After the war ended, Perdicaris lived in Trenton with his father. He published some articles in The Galaxy in 1868, before moving to England. There he studied electricity and related engineering. In 1871 in Malvern, England, Perdicaris met Ellen Varley, wife of the eminent British telegraph engineer C.F. Varley. Varley was away on cable business. Ellen and Perdicaris began an affair that resulted in Ellen leaving her husband. The Varleys formally divorced in 1873.Hunt, B.J. \\"Varley, Cromwell Fleetwood (1828‚Äì1883)\\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Accessed 23 July 2005. Ellen settled in Tangier with Perdicaris, and her two sons and two daughters from her first marriage. She and her family were all British subjects. Perdicaris built a house there in 1877 known as the \\"Place of Nightingales\\", as he collected a menagerie of exotic animals. Perdicardis dabbled in the arts and retained some ties to the US: In 1876, he exhibited a painting at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. In 1879, Perdicardis produced a play at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in New York City, but it was unsuccessful. After 1884, he lived permanently in Tangier. Fascinated by Moroccan culture, Perdicaris wrote several books (few of them published to a wide audience) on the country. He became the unofficial head of Tangier's foreign community. Serving as president of the Hygienic Commission in Tangier, he helped gain construction of a modern sanitation system for the city. He also maintained business interests in England and the United States, frequently visiting New York. In 1886, Perdicaris filed a complaint of misconduct against Felix Mathews, then the American Consul General in Morocco. Mathews had refused to prosecute a Moroccan for rape who was under American proteg√© status. Perdicaris also wrote and distributed a pamphlet entitled \\"American Claims and the Protection of Native Subjects in Morocco\\" in London in response to the issue. The government arrested and fined Perdicaris for shielding a Moroccan from arrest. (Later he sought and received redress for this). Through Perdicaris' crusading, the incident made national headlines in the United States, and Mathews was removed from his position in March 1887. Mulai Ahmed er Raisuli was a leader of several hill tribes near Tangier. In 1903, after five of his men were captured by the government, he held Walter Harris, a correspondent of The Times in Morocco, as hostage in exchange for the release of his men. After that success, Rasuli targeted Ion Perdicaris for kidnapping.  Kidnapping  US newspaper cartoon on the incident On 18 May 1904, Perdicaris and Ellen's son Cromwell Varley, a British subject, were abducted from their summer home by Mulai Ahmed er Raisuli and a group of bandits (estimates of their number ranged wildly, from nine to one-hundred and fifty). Raisuli ruled three hill tribes in Morocco. His men cut the telephone lines, knocked out several Perdicaris servants, and left Ellen at the house. She later was able to contact the embassy, and at 11:00pm, the American Consul General, Samuel Gummer√©, arrived at the house. The consuls of Great Britain was also notified. On 19 May, a cable from Gummer√© reached the United States. It read: As Raisuli's group traveled through the Rif Mountains, Perdicaris's horse fell and the American broke his leg. Raisuli demanded of Sultan Abdelaziz of Morocco a $55,000 ransom (later raised to $70,000); removal of government troops from the region and an end to its harassment of the Er-Rif people; the removal, arrest, and imprisonment of the Pasha of Tangier and several other government officials; release of certain political prisoners; and cession of control of two of Morocco's wealthiest districts (later increased to six). Raisuli later added the stipulation that the United States and England must guarantee meeting these demands. = American involvement = When the US was notified of the kidnapping, Secretary of State, John Hay, was out of town. Assistant Secretary of State, Francis B. Loomis, dealt with the crisis. He diverted seven of the sixteen American ships in the Mediterranean Sea on a \\"goodwill cruise\\" to Tangier. Angered by the kidnapping, President Theodore Roosevelt reacted with a show of force. Hay described the demands as \\"preposterous\\". The following day the United States ordered Admiral French Ensor Chadwick to dispatch a ship from the South Atlantic Squadron to Tangier. On 20 May, the British dispatched a torpedo boat from Gibraltar to the city. On 21 May, representatives from the sultan were sent to begin negotiations with the captors. By 25 May, negotiations had yet to achieve anything. On 29 May, Raisuli threatened to kill the prisoners if his demands were not met in two days. The incident revealed internal tensions, as the foreign minister of Morocco allied with Raisuli's enemies. The Shereefs of Wazan were credited with progress in the negotiations. That same day, Theodore Frelinghuysen Jewell was ordered to dispatch three additional ships. When a messenger from the Sultan arrived at Rasuli's camp, he was sold to the highest bidder, and was executed by having his throat slit. The armored cruiser and cruiser reached Tangier on 30 May, and Admiral Chadwick had a conference with the Sultan's representative. The next day, the gunboats and arrived, and France assured the United States they would do \\"all in their power to rescue the prisoners\\". On 1 June the ransom demand was increased to $70,000. Jewell arrived with , , and , bringing the total American ships in Tangier to seven, manned by several Marine companies, commanded by Major John Twiggs Myers. At the time, the gathering was the most numerous of American ships in any foreign port. They were not to be used without express orders from Washington, as it was thought that any action by the Marines would lead to the deaths of the prisoners. The US planned to use them only to seize the custom-houses of Morocco, which supplied much of the nation's revenue, if the Moroccan government did not fulfill the demands of the United States. It insisted the government make the concessions necessary to persuade Raisuli to release Perdicaris, and to attack Raisuli if Perdicaris were killed. The only Marines to land in Morocco were a small detachment of a four men, carrying only sidearms. They were ordered to protect the Consulate and Mrs. Perdicaris. Two other US Marines were dispatched on 8 June to protect the Belgian legation. On 30 May, A. H. Slocomb sent a letter to John Hay, claiming that Perdicaris was no longer an American citizen, having taken Greek citizenship. Though Roosevelt's resolve weakened, he decided to continue with the negotiations, as Raisuli believed that Perdicaris was an American citizen. Roosevelt tried to get Britain and France to join the U.S. in a combined military action to rescue Perdicaris, but the two countries refused. Instead, the two powers were covertly recruited to put pressure on the Sultan to accept Raisuli's demands. On 2 June the arrived in port, and tensions rose to the point that there were fears of an uprising in the city. = Tensions escalate = On 6 June, the and arrived, due to fears that the United States might force Morocco to give them a port. In response to the request of the British minister in Morocco, left Gibraltar on 7 June. That same day, President Roosevelt received confirmation that Perdicaris had registered in Athens as a Greek citizen. Negotiations continued and on 8 May, the Sultan granted Raisuli's demands, appointing Herid el Barrada as governor of Tangier. Angry tribesmen raided the home of an Englishman. Negotiations dragged on. The government removed its troops from Raisuli's region on 9 June. On 14 June, an attempt was made to kidnap the Italian consul. On 15 June, Raisuli increased his demands to be given control of six, rather than two districts of Morocco. On 19 June the Sultan accepted Raisuli's demands, with the date of release of captives set for 21 June. On 20 June, a hitch in negotiations occurred. Zelai, governor of an inland tribe, refused to act as intermediary. On 21 or 22 June the ransom money was deposited. On 22 June, Raisuli demanded another district for his control. Though a settlement had already been reached, a cable from Gummer√© accusing the Sultan of holding up negotiations. Seeing the need to act, Hay issued a statement to the Republican National Convention, that was read by Joseph Gurney Cannon: \\"We want Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead.\\" While it was clear that the convention would nominate the incumbent Roosevelt as the Republican candidate, Hay's statement electrified the Convention. One Kansas delegate exclaimed, \\"Roosevelt and Hay know what they're doing. Our people like courage. We'll stand for anything those men do.\\" After being nominated, Roosevelt easily won election in the fall of 1904. Perdicaris was home by 24 June, after most of Raisuli's demands were met. Perdicaris wrote a narrative of his captivity while held by Raisuli. It was published in Leslie's Weekly, followed by National Geographic, gaining a large audience. After his release, Perdicaris admitted he was no longer an American citizen. While he had received Greek citizenship, he never lived in Athens for the required two years, and never renounced his American citizenship. The State Department concluded that Perdicaris had not \\"ever effectively acquired Greek, nor divested himself of American, citizenship.\\" He was later issued a United States passport as an American citizen. Despite the circumstances, Perdicaris came to admire and befriend Raisuli, who had pledged to protect his prisoner from any harm. Perdicaris later said: \\"I go so far as to say that I do not regret having been his prisoner for some time... He is not a bandit, not a murderer, but a patriot forced into acts of brigandage to save his native soil and his people from the yoke of tyranny.\\"\\"1904: 'Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead!'\\", Jon Blackwell, The Trentonian, 1904. Twenty-first century historians, such as Jeffrey D. Simon, suggested that Perdicaris displayed Stockholm syndrome in identifying with his captor. The Sultan of Morocco was required to pay the $70,000 ransom, and a further $4,000 to the United States to cover its expenses. Newspapers including The New York Times published editorials suggesting that France had to 'impose order' in the country. France intervened several times in Morocco's affairs in ensuing decades.  Aftermath  Perdicaris and his family moved to England shortly after the incident, eventually settling in Tunbridge Wells. He occasionally returned to Trenton, where he maintained business interests. Perdicaris Place, off West State Street in Trenton, is named for him and his father. Ion Perdicaris died in London in 1925. Raisuli used the money he gained from ransoming Perdicaris to build his palace, nick-named the \\"House of Tears\\". Perdicaris published an autobiography in 1921, titled The Hand of Fate. The details of the incident (especially the fact that Perdicaris's US citizenship was in doubt) were kept secret until 1933, when historian Tyler Dennett mentioned the crisis in his biography of John Hay.Barbara W. Tuchman, \\"Perdicaris Alive or Raisuli Dead!\\". American Heritage, August 1959; later republished in Tuchman's essay compilation Practicing History: Selected Essays (1984), pp. 104‚Äì117 In 1975, Thomas H. Etzold described the kidnapping as \\"the most famous protection case in American history.\\" Popular culture \\"Hostages to Momus\\", a short story by the American author O. Henry, was inspired by the kidnapping of Ion Perdicaris. In the story, the character \\"Burdick Harris,\\" a Greek citizen, stands for him. (\\"Bur-dick-Harris\\" is a play on \\"Per-dic-aris\\", as the names rhyme, if pronounced as the author intended). The humorous story was written shortly after the incident. The story of Ion Perdicaris's kidnapping was loosely adapted to film in the 1975 motion picture The Wind and the Lion, with Sean Connery in the role of Raisuli and Brian Keith as Roosevelt. However, to add some glamour to the tale, the 64-year-old bearded hostage was replaced with attractive young \\"Eden Pedecaris\\", played by Candice Bergen. The film incorrectly showed US Marines invading Morocco and battling soldiers of the German Empire (who were not present in Morocco at the time), but it succeeded in presenting the personality of Raisuli and his interaction with his prisoners.

Life He was born at Leeds and educated at Leeds Grammar School and Catharine Hall, Cambridge. On graduation he went to Thorp Arch, West Yorkshire as assistant in a school kept by Christopher Atkinson, the vicar of the parish, received holy orders, and became Atkinson's curate. At Thorp Arch he made a lifelong friendship with the son of the vicar, Miles Atkinson, who subsequently became a leader of the evangelical party and vicar of St Paul's, Leeds. Still in deacon's orders Milner left Thorp Arch to become headmaster of Hull Grammar School. There his pupils included William Dealtry, Samuel Marsden, George Pryme, Thomas Perronet Thompson, and Peter William Watson. Milner was in 1768 elected afternoon lecturer at Holy Trinity Church, Hull. He now paid for the education of his brother Isaac Milner. In 1770 he became a follower of the rising evangelical school, suspected of Methodism, and the nature of his congregation at the High Church changed. He also undertook the charge of North Ferriby. Hull became a centre of evangelicalism. Milner's chief friends were the Rev. James Stillingfleet (1741‚Äì1826) of Hotham, and the Rev. William Richardson of York, who both shared his religious views. In 1792 he had a severe attack of fever; in 1797 the mayor and corporation offered him the living of Holy Trinity, mainly through the efforts of William Wilberforce, but Milner fell ill and died on 15 November 1797. He was buried in Holy Trinity Church, and a monument to his memory was erected in it. Works Milner's major work was the History of the Church of Christ (London, 1794‚Äì1809). He lived to complete the first three volumes, and two more were added by his brother, Isaac Milner (1750‚Äì1820), dean of Carlisle, who re- edited the whole work in 1810. John Scott (1777‚Äì1834) published a new continuation in three volumes (1826, 1829, and 1831). Samuel Roffey Maitland criticised Milner's history on the Waldenses (1832); the Rev. John King defended Milner, but Maitland published Strictures on Milner's Church History (1834).Retrieved 14 February 2020. A controversy ensued, and the Milner's work had a new edition, published by the Rev. Thomas Grantham in 1847. Other works published by Milner in his lifetime were: *Gibbon's Account of Christianity considered, with some Strictures on Hume's Dialogues on Natural Religion, 1781. *Some Remarkable Passages in the Life of William Howard, who died at North Ferriby on 2 March 1784, 1785. *Essays on several Religious Subjects, chiefly tending to illustrate the Scripture Doctrine of the Influence of the Holy Spirit, 1789. He published essays and numerous sermons. He also edited, with William Richardson, the Posthumous Works of Thomas Adam (1786). After Milner's death many of his sermons were found, and these were published in four volumes under the title of Practical Sermons, (1800) with a memoir by the editor, Isaac Milner;the first and the second] (1809), edited by the Rev. W. Richardson.. These two were later republished together. A third volume (1823) was edited by the Rev. John Fawcett, and a fourth (1830), On the Epistles to the Seven Churches, the Millennium, the Church Triumphant, and the 130th Psalm, by Edward Bickersteth. In 1855 Milner's Essentials of Christianity, theoretically and practically considered, which had been left in manuscript, and had been revised by his brother, was edited for the Religious Tract Society by Mary Milner, the orphan niece of whom Joseph Milner had taken charge, and writer of her uncle Isaac's Life.

He was born in the southern settlement of Fisken√¶sset.  Expeditions = Second Grinnell expedition = Hendrik was hired by the American explorer Elisha Kent Kane for the 1853‚Äì1855 second Grinnell expedition to search for the lost Franklin expedition. He established his worth in the winter of 1854, when participating in a search for four of the men who were lying frozen and disabled somewhere northwest of the ship, which was beset in the ice in Rensellaer Bay. Hendrik located their sledge track, which brought the rescue party to the men. He also assisted with communication with the local Inuit, and was instrumental in hunting efforts, including tracking and finding a wounded caribou in February 1855 when the men were beginning to starve and show signs of scurvy. It was due to Henrik's ability and effort that the important sledging journey to Cape Constitution was completed. For these efforts, Hendrik's agreed upon salary was two barrels of flour and 52 pounds of salt pork. After the Grinnell expedition, Hendrik returned to Qeqertarsuatsiaat, in western Greenland, where he married. In a report submitted by Sir Francis Leopold McClintock on , near the conclusion of his own expedition in search of Franklin, it was reported by the Inut near Cape York that Hans was residing at Whale Sound. = Hayes' expedition = Hendrik made his second northern voyage aboard the United States under Isaac Israel Hayes' American expedition of 1860‚Äì1861. At the end of August 1860, Hayes touched at Cape York and picked up Hans, his wife, and child. On 21 December, Hans and astronomer August Sonntag began their ice journey‚Äîa journey from which Sonntag did not return. Hans managed to eventually reach an Inuit settlement, saving his own life. The United States reached Upernavik on 15 August 1861, near which Hendrik and his family would remain for the next three years. Following that, they returned to Fiskernaes. = Polaris expedition = Hendrik's third journey on the Polaris expedition of 1871‚Äì1873, led by Charles Francis Hall under Captain Budington. Hans joined the voyage, along with his wife and four children. Hall died during the voyage of apoplexy on 8 November 1871. Hendrik was among the party left behind after Hall's death when the broke loose of the ice and failed to return. During the party's six-month drift on a gradually-shrinking ice-floe, Hendrik and the Canadian Inuk Ebierbing managed to provide food for the entire party; they were eventually picked up by a sealer in April 1873. Following this journey, Hendrik made a trip to America, including visits to Washington D.C. and New York, before returning home to Fiskernaes. = British Arctic expedition = Hendrik's last sea voyage was under George Strong Nares in the British Arctic expedition of 1875‚Äì1876. Hendrik presumably joined the crew of at Smith Sound before proceeding to the northernmost reaches of Greenland. The expedition encountered problems with pack ice and scurvy, spending one winter locked in the ice. Hendrik's hunting and handling of dogsleds contributed both to the exploration and the survival and ultimate rescue of the most of the crew. Hendrik retired from expedition support and worked as boatswain and laborer at the Greenland settlements. His arctic journeys made him wealthy by the standards of his community.

Copyright 2008 *The American Heritage Medical Dictionary Copyright 2007 *McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine. Copyright 2002 The procedure is used to remove fluid from the peritoneal cavity, particularly if this cannot be achieved with medication. The most common indication is ascites that has developed in people with cirrhosis. Indications It is used for a number of reasons: * to relieve abdominal pressure from ascites * to diagnose spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and other infections (e.g. abdominal TB) * to diagnose metastatic cancer * to diagnose blood in peritoneal space in trauma For ascites The procedure is often performed in a doctor's office or an outpatient clinic. In an expert's hands, it is usually very safe, although there is a small risk of infection, excessive bleeding or perforating a loop of bowel. These last two risks can be minimized greatly with the use of ultrasound guidance. The patient is requested to urinate before the procedure; alternately, a Foley catheter is used to empty the bladder. The patient is positioned in the bed with the head elevated at 45‚Äì60 degrees to allow fluid to accumulate in lower abdomen. After cleaning the side of the abdomen with an antiseptic solution, the physician numbs a small area of skin and inserts a large-bore needle with a plastic sheath 2 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in) in length to reach the peritoneal (ascitic) fluid. The needle is removed, leaving the plastic sheath to allow drainage of the fluid. The fluid is drained by gravity, a syringe or by connection to a vacuum bottle. Several litres of fluid may be drained during the procedure; however, if more than two litres are to be drained, it will usually be done over the course of several treatments. After the desired level of drainage is complete, the plastic sheath is removed and the puncture site bandaged. The plastic sheath can be left in place with a flow control valve and protective dressing if further treatments are expected to be necessary. If fluid drainage in cirrhotic ascites is more than 5 litres, patients may receive intravenous serum albumin (25% albumin, 8g/L) to prevent hypotension (low blood pressure). There has been debate as to whether albumin administration confers benefit, but a recent 2016 meta-analysis concluded that it can reduce mortality after large-volume paracentesis significantly. However, for every end-point investigated, while albumin was favorable as compared to other agents (e.g., plasma expanders, vasoconstrictors), these were not statistically significant and the meta-analysis was limited by the quality of the studies ‚Äî two of which that were in fact unsuitable ‚Äî included in it. The procedure generally is not painful and does not require sedation. The patient is usually discharged within several hours following post- procedure observation provided that blood pressure is otherwise normal and the patient experiences no dizziness. Fluid analysis The serum-ascites albumin gradient can help determine the cause of the ascites. The ascitic white blood cell count can help determine if the ascites is infected. A count of 250 neutrophils per ml or higher is considered diagnostic for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Cultures of the fluid can be taken, but the yield is approximately 40% (72-90% if blood culture bottles are used). Contraindications Mild hematologic abnormalities do not increase the risk of bleeding. The risk of bleeding may be increased if: * prothrombin time > 21 seconds * international normalized ratio > 1.6 * platelet count < 50,000 per cubic millimeter. Absolute contraindication is acute abdomen that requires surgery. Relative contraindications are: * Pregnancy * Distended urinary bladder * Abdominal wall cellulitis * Distended bowel * Intra-abdominal adhesions.

Vincenzio Carduccio (in Spanish, sometimes Vicencio or Vicente Carducho; 1576/78-1638) was an Italian painter.  Biography  He was born in Florence, and was trained as a painter by his brother Bartolomeo Carduccio, whom he followed to Madrid as a boy. He initially painted some works at Valladolid and helped his brother in painting at the Escorial for Philip II of Spain. He returned to the court of Philip III in Madrid in 1606 and helped decorate the recently rebuilt Palacio del Pardo. While at work his brother died, and Vicente took his place. He painted there a history of Achilles. When finished, he was employed for four years by the monks of the Chartreuse of el Paular to decorate their monastery with 54 canvases of historical figures the great cloister. 27 represent the live of St. Bruno, 27 of martyrs.Web oficial of the Monasterio de Santa Mar√≠a de El PaularLos cartujos de Carducho regresan a El Paular, Museo Nacional del Prado. He worked a great deal for the subsequent monarch, Philip IV, and his best pictures are those he executed for him as decorations, now preserved in the Prado. Examples of his work are preserved at Toledo, Segovia, and several other Spanish cities. For many years he labored in Madrid as a teacher of his art, and among his pupils were Juan Ricci, Pedro Obregon, Vela, Francisco Collantes, and other distinguished representatives of the Spanish school during the 17th century. He also authored a treatise, De las Excelencias de la Pintura or Di√°logos de la pintura, su defensa, origen, essencia, definici√≥n, modos, y differencias, published in 1633. Written in classical tradition as a dialogue between a master and an apprentice. Following strict piety of the Spanish realm, the text urges: : > \\"Shame on me and all those who rash and impudent, and without meditation and > without improving our souls, in this world set out to paint a portrait of > the most Holy Queen of Angels, Mother of the Almighty, she who was full of > grace, she who will be our means for gaining heaven...How well this was > understood by that holy monastic painter Brother Juan Fesulano..(who) never > started to paint without praying first..and (who) wept whenever he painted > Christ on the Cross.\\" Carducho also assailed the verism of practiced by some such as Vel√°zquez, and particularly was critical of Caravaggio and his followers, on whom he wrote:Translation for Holt, E.G. by Martin S. Soria, Michigan State University : > \\"His new dish is cooked with condiments, with so much flavor, appetite, and > relish that he has surpassed everybody with such choice tidbits and a > license so great that I am afraid the others will suffer apoplexy in ther > true principles, because most painters follow him as if they were famished. > They do not stop to reflect of the fire of his talent which is so forceful, > nor whether they are able to digest such an impetuous, unheard of, and > incompatible technique, nor whether they possess Caravaggio's nimbleness of > painting without preparation. Did anyone ever paint, and with so much > success, as this monster of genius and talent, almost without rules, without > theory, without learning and meditation, solely by the power of this genius > and the model in front of him which he simply copied so admirably.? I heard > a zealot of our profession say that the appearance of this man mean a > foreboding of ruin and end of painting, and how at the close of this visible > world the Antichrist, pretending to be the real Christ with false and > strange miracles and monstrous deeds would carry with him to damnation a > very large number of people moved by his works which seemed so admirable > (although they were in themselves deceptive, false, and without truth or > permanence). : > \\"Thus this Anti-Michelangelo with his showy and external copying of nature > his admirable technique and liveliness has been able to persuade such a > large number of all kinds of people that his is good painting and that his > theory and practice are right, that they have turned their backs on the true > manner of perpetuating themselves and on true knowledge in this matter.\\" Carducho died in Madrid.

It achieves this by recording the sound as a variable-density optical track on the same strip of film that records the pictures. The initial version was capable of a frequency response of 8500 Hz.http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/recording.technology.history/motionpicture1.html Although sound films today use variable-area tracks, any modern motion picture theater (excluding those that have transitioned to digital cinema) can play a Movietone film without modification to the projector (though if the projector's sound unit has been fitted with red LED or laser light sources, the reproduction quality from a variable density track will be significantly impaired). Movietone was one of four motion picture sound systems under development in the U.S. during the 1920s, the others being DeForest Phonofilm, Warner Brothers' Vitaphone, and RCA Photophone, though Phonofilm was primarily an early version of Movietone. Left: Movietone track with variable density. Right: Variable area track. History As a student, Theodore Case became interested in the use of modulated light to carry speech, and in 1916 set up a laboratory to study the photo-electric properties of materials. He developed the Thalofide cell, a sensitive photocell, which was used as part of an infra- red communication system by the U.S. Navy during, and for some years after WW1. In 1922 Case and his assistant Earl I. Sponable turned their attention to \\"talking pictures\\". In that same year Case was approached by Lee de Forest who had been attempting since 1919 to create an optical soundtrack for motion picture film in a system he called Phonofilm. De Forest was having little success and turned to Case for help, so from 1922 until 1925 Case and de Forest collaborated in the development of the Phonofilm system. Amongst other Case inventions Case contributed the Thalofide photocell and also the Aeo- light, a light source that could be readily modulated by audio signals and was used to expose the soundtrack in sound cameras. In 1925, however, Case ended his relationship with de Forest due in the main to de Forest's tendency to claim the entire credit for the Phonofilm system for himself despite the fact that most of the critical inventions had come from Case. Documents supporting this, including a signed letter by De Forest that states that Phonofilms are only possible because of the inventions of Case Research Lab, are located at the Case Research Lab Museum in Auburn, New York.Case Lab Museum website In 1925, therefore, Case and Sponable continued the development of their own system, now called \\"Movietone\\". From 1924 onwards Sponable had turned his attention to the design of single-system cameras, in which the sound and picture are recorded on the same negative. He asked Bell & Howell to modify one of their cameras to his design, but the results were unsatisfactory. Consequently, the Wall machine shop in Syracuse, New York was asked to rebuild this camera and the results were much improved. Subsequently, many single- system 35mm cameras were produced by Wall Camera Corporation, which much later produced the three-film Cinerama cameras. Wall initially converted some Bell & Howell Design 2709 cameras to single-system, but most were Wall designed and produced. Single-system cameras were also produced by Mitchell Camera Corporation during World War II for the U.S. Army Signal Corps, although these cameras were quite rare. Partly as a result of the single system experiments, the aspect ratio of approximately 1.19:1 that is created by printing an optical soundtrack on top of the 35mm full aperture became known colloquially as the \\"Movietone ratio\\". It was used extensively by Hollywood and European studios (apart from those that adopted sound-on-disc) between the late 1920s and May 1932, when the Academy ratio of 1.37:1 was introduced to restore the effective shape of the silent frame. The 1950s brought the first 35mm kinescope camera with sound-on-film rather than separate, from Photo-Sonics, with a Davis Loop Drive mechanism built within the camera box. This camera was essential for TV network time-shifting in the years before Videotape. The sound galvanometer was made by RCA and was designed for good to excellent results when the kinescope negative was projected, thereby avoiding making a print before the delayed replay. The Davis mechanism was a Western Electric development. After the split with de Forest, Case adopted a revised position for the projector soundhead, which was now placed below the picture head, with a sound-picture offset of 14 ¬Ω inches (368 mm) (which is close to the present day standard), rather than being placed above the picture head as had been the phonofilm practice. Case also adopted the 24 frames/sec speed for Movietone, bringing it in line with the speed already chosen for the Western Electric Vitaphone sound-on-disc system, and thus establishing 24 frames/sec as the standard speed for all sound films, whether sound-on-disc or sound-on-film. With a few exceptions, this has remained the standard speed for professional sound films ever since.Earl I. Sponable, \\"Historical Development of Sound Films\\", The Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers (April 1947), Vol. 48, No. 4Edward Kellogg, \\"History of Sound Motion in Pictures\\", The Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers (June 1955), Vol. 64, p. 295 At this point, the Movietone system was adopted by the AMPAS as the Academy's standard. It and the later RCA Photophone system were interchangeable in most respects. See RCA Photophone for technical details and lists of the industry adopters. Commercial use by William Fox Movietone entered commercial use when William Fox of the Fox Film Corporation bought the entire system including the patents in July 1926. Although Fox owned the Case patents, the work of Freeman Harrison Owens, and the American rights to the German Tri-Ergon patents, the Movietone sound film system uses only the inventions of Case Research Lab. William Fox hired Earl I. Sponable (1895‚Äì1977) from Case Research Lab in 1926, when he purchased the sound-on- film patents from Case. The first feature film released using the Fox Movietone system was Sunrise (1927) directed by F. W. Murnau. It was the first professionally produced feature film with an optical sound track. The sound in the film included only music, sound effects, and very few unsynchronized words. The system was used for sound acting sequences in Mother Knows Best (1928). Less than two years after purchasing the system from Case, Fox bought out all of Case's interests in the Fox-Case company. All of Fox's sound feature films were made using the Movietone system until 1931 when it was superseded by a Western Electric recording system using the light-valve invented by Edward C. Wente in 1923. However, Fox Movietone News used the system until 1939, because of the ease of transporting the single-system's sound film equipment. Later development A vintage Fox movietone motion picture camera The Case Research Lab sound system influenced many industry standards, such as location of the optical sound 20 frames in advance of the image it accompanies.Leslie J. Wheeler, Principles of Cinematography (4th edition), Fountain Press (1969), p. 373 The current SMPTE standard for 35 mm sound film is +21 frames for optical, but a 46-foot theatre reduces this to +20 frames;Kodak Film Notes Issue # H-50-03: Projection practices and techniques ‚Äî see Manuals at http://www.film-tech.com/Ira Konigsberg, The Complete Film Dictionary (Second Edition), Bloomsbury (1997) ‚Äî see Projector article. this was originally done partly to ensure the film runs smoothly past the sound head, but also to ensure that no Phonofilm could again be played in theaters ‚Äî the Phonofilm system being incompatible with Case Research Lab specifications ‚Äî and also to ease the modification of projectors already widely in use. Sponable worked at the Fox Film Corporation (later 20th Century Fox) Movietone studios on 54th Street and 10th Avenue in New York City until he retired in the 1960s, eventually winning an Academy Award for his technical work on the development of CinemaScope. Sponable had many contributions to film technology during his career, including the invention of the perforated motion-picture screen that allowed placing the speakers behind it to enhance the illusion of the sound emanating directly from the film action. During his years at Fox, Sponable also served for a time as an officer of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. He published a concise history of sound film in the April 1947 issue of The SMPE Journal (The SMPTE Journal after 1950). The history of Case Research Lab has long been unheralded for numerous reasons. Theodore Case died in 1944, after donating his home and laboratory to be preserved as a museum to the inventions of Case Research Lab. The museum's first director, who oversaw the museum for 50 years, put the laboratory's contents into storage and converted the building into an art studio. The Case Research Lab sound studio was located on the second floor of the estate's carriage house and that was rented to the local model train club until the early 1990s. Fox was seriously injured in a July 1929 car accident, lost his company in 1930 when his loans were called in and lost the 1936 lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court against the film industry for violating the Tri-Ergon patents he owned. Sponable did little to establish the record of Case Research Lab inventions, other than his April 1947 article in The Journal of the SMPE. Incredibly, it was also in 1947 that the Davis Loop Drive was first introduced to Western Electric licensees, including Twentieth Century- Fox (WECo RA-1231; and still made to this day by a successor company). Recently, Case Research Lab, the adjoining carriage house, and Case's home have been restored and research is ongoing with the collections of the lab that include all receipts, notebooks, correspondence, and much of the laboratory's original equipment, including the first recording device created to test the AEO light. In the collections are also letters from Thomas Edison, an original copy of the Tri-Ergon patents, and an internal document from Fox Films written in the 1930s. This latter document says that once it became public knowledge that Sponable perfected the variable-area system of sound-on- film at the Fox Studios, that system became the standard and replaced the inventions of Case Research Lab. A number of films owned by Case Research Lab and Museum and restored by George Eastman House in Rochester, New York, are in the collections of both of those institutions. The Case Research Lab and Museum has additional sound-film footage of Theodore Case, and recently discovered copies of the same films at the Eastman House, are in a much higher state of preservation. Movietone News films are in the collections of 20th- Century Fox and the University of South Carolina at Columbia, including the only known footage of Earl I. Sponable talking. Sponable can also be seen in footage of the premiere of the film The Robe. Phonofilms that were produced using Case Research Lab inventions are in the collections of the Library of Congress and the British Film Institute. Variable density (VD) recording systems developed from Movietone gradually lost market share to variable area (VA) ones developed from Photophone from the 1940s onwards, a process that gathered pace as VA-related patents expired. Though both methods are theoretically capable of achieving similar standards of recording, duplication and reproduction, quality control in the lab proved to be far more critical in the duplication of VD tracks than VA ones: slight errors in printer light settings and sensitometry and densitometry control will affect the signal-to- noise ratio far more on a VD track than on a VA one. For this reason archives have tended to remaster original VD tracks to VA negatives for preservation and the creation of new prints.

Originally released in South Korea in February 2006, the English localizations were launched in the summer of 2007 in North America and Southeast Asia. Granado Espada won the 2006 Korean Presidential Award for Best Graphics and Game of the Year, with features previously unseen in an MMORPG (such as the ability for players to control multiple characters at the same time). Granado Espada features a unique art style based on the Baroque period of Europe, differing from the standard ‚Äúsword and sorcery‚Äù fantasy themes of the genre.  Setting  The world of Granado Espada takes place on a newly discovered continent based on the Americas during the Age of Exploration. The world is divided into different maps and grouped into themed regions such as forests, tropical jungles, plains, swamps, deserts and ice fields. The continent, currently under the control of the fictional Kingdom of Vespanola as a colony, is in a crisis due to negligence by the home nation due to a war in the Old World. On the continent itself, internal strife has arisen from the feud between the Royalists supporting the Vespanolan crown, and the Republicans campaigning for independence. Therefore, the Vespanolan Queen has ordered a policy of Reconquista for the continent by attracting more people from the Old World to settle there. The player takes the role of a pioneering family from the Old World, eager to explore the continent and eliminate elements that will threaten the survival of its people.  Game features =Multiple character control= A three-character team (fighter, elementalist, scout) using the MCC System Granado Espada distinguishes itself from many modern-day MMORPGs with a Multiple Character Control (MCC) system. Rather than playing one character at a time, or using multiple clients, a player may control a party of up to three characters simultaneously. This aspect of the game gives it more of the feel of traditional, non-networked role-playing video games. Up to three characters can be selected to be part of a team in the Barracks Mode or Quarters. Any member of the party can be selected to be part of a team, regardless of differences in levels or classes. = Areas and quests = Dungeons in Granado Espada are interspersed between towns and generally composed of three to five levels with successively more difficult mobs. Boxes and barrels are a unique feature of dungeons - and part of the anti-AFK features of the game. They randomly spawn throughout the dungeon, and if destroyed they release a group of monsters to attack the players. The final levels of the first two dungeons - Al Quelt Moreza and the Tetra Ruins - end with a main quest storyline Mission Room for a single player, or a room in which a boss mob may be challenged by teams of players. Missions are instances, wherein players get their own \\"instance\\" of a specific map just for themselves. Thus there can be several players attempting to kill a boss in a dungeon, each within their own instances. There are Waypoints or (player chosen) save locations that players may teleport to by using a warp scroll. Five locations may be saved initially. Up to five more waypoint locations may be purchased from the Cash Shop (Bazaar). Teleporters or Warps also exist to teleport players to fixed areas in the game using an item called the Teleport/Warp scroll. A new player is able to visit the three main towns (Reboldeaux, Port of Coimbra and Auch) from the beginning, and is not required to conduct exploration trips to find them. Both zone maps and a global map is provided to help players navigate through the game. Quests are an important part of the game, though the quantity and quality varies at different levels. They provide some rewards such as \\"Vis\\" (the game's currency), experience cards, Glaziums (polishers), equipments or recruitable NPCs cards. Various NPCs throughout the towns and in some dungeon locations may be approached to initiate quests, which, like in traditional MMORPG format, usually consist of killing a number of monsters and/or obtaining their drops. With the release of Pioneering quests, players are able to delve into the story revolving around Granado Espada and its colonial power, Vespanola, in addition to the various factions on the continent itself, allowing new players to build on their quests bit-by-bit. Granado Espada has a main quest line that extends to the highest levels and zones: the Frozen Fields of the north, Errac (Zeia), the mysterious southwestern region of Castilla, as well as the isolated isle of Viron (Byron). Access to the high- level end game raids such as the Ice Wizard's Tower, Mufasa of the Occulta Fortress, Tower of Chaos in Castilla in addition to Lucifer Castle can only be gained by completing the main pioneering quest line and other prerequisite quests. Shiny crystals are a new addition to the game since V5.0. These crystals are common drops from lower level mobs and can be turned in for pioneer weapons and armors designed to help a pre-veteran character gain levels more easily. In addition, all pioneer equipments at levels 1, 20, 40 and 60 have the base stats of items 20 levels higher, while level 80 pioneer equipments have the same stats as a normal level 96 equipment (currently removed). =Dueling, Player vs. Player & Baron Mode= Granado Espada has a Dueling System by which a player may issue a challenge to another player's team. Both teams then enter a combat arena separate from the rest of the actual game world to do battle. This feature is available by clicking on the other family's name for a duel and also available at PvP officers in the Major cities (Reboldoeux, Coimbra, Auch) where four types of battles are available. Another method for PvP is through the Baron system. In Player-kill (PK) servers, players are able to forcibly attack another player without their consent, and in the process become a baron as a penalty like dropping their items in inventory from baron level 1 to 4, while at level 5 baron they would start to drop their equipped item. Barons are not able to speak with NPCs and are treated as mobs while on the field. Being in baron mode also allows player access to Los Toldos, a hideout for barons, and to get the opportunity to complete quests within there. To remove the Baron mode, players must kill mobs that enable them to decrease their Baron points. Once they reach zero, the player will be able to get out of Baron mode. In the past, players would only be able to PvP with those playing in the same server. With the introduction of the Cross-World PvP system in Version 5.0, players from different servers are able to duel each other in individual or team modes. The individual or team which wins at least three rounds will be declared the winner. Points are acquired or deducted based on the number of matches the player wins or loses. Additional benefits including experience points and purchase points for the Cross-World PvP shop are also awarded to players regardless of whether they win or lose. To encourage participation, there is also a ladder system in which players are ranked according to the points they receive through winning or losing matches.  Characters  Initially, players are able to create their own family from five stock models, namely - the Fighter, Musketeer, Wizard, Scout, and Elementalist. As the player progresses through the game, NPC characters can be recruited into the player's family. The said characters' fighting abilities can be customized through learning and developing various fighting stances, in addition to equipping them with various armors and accessories with different options. Costumes also play a large role in the customization process, and many have been developed for both the stock characters and RNPCs. =Barracks system= All characters are assumed to be from the same family. They all share the same family surname that is used to identify a player in game. Characters are generated and maintained within a Barracks System. It allows players to see all of their active characters, and use the \\"Dressing Room\\" to create new characters if space permits. Each individual barrack may hold up to nine characters. Each country's version of Granado Espada provides a different number of initial starting slots with a new account. Using in-game money or the cash shop, users can expand their slots. Every ninth slot automatically opens a new barrack. Therefore, if the player has 20 slots, barracks one and two are full and the player has two characters in the third. Based on the Korean regional server version, there are currently a maximum of twelve barracks (108 characters) per account. =Trading characters= Granado Espada allows the trading of RNPC (Recruitable NPCs) or UPC (Unique Playable Character) cards between different players, allowing combinations of teams with more than one of the same RNPC, as a player may only obtain a particular RNPC card once. The card is used up once the RNPC is created in the Barracks. Some RNPCs may only be purchased by using items from the Cash Shop (Bazaar). Soso (Feng Ling), Baek-Ho (Baihu), Angie, Kurt and Eduardo (Edward) are examples of this class of RNPCs (No longer pay in cash shop). Their cards are not tradeable. Instead, one must purchase a Mercenary card from the Cash Shop (Bazaar). Using the said Mercenary License card, the RNPC is \\"Merced\\" and can then be traded. Premium RNPCs, for example, Emilia the Sage, can be obtained by the code provided in the Granado Espada Limited Signature Edition Box Set. Depending on which regional server the player is on, other RNPCs such as Panfilo the Battlecook, Idge the Battlesmith can be purchased from the Cash Shop while Ralph is only available during promotions. The Japanese server has its own unique RNPCs Mifuyu, which can only be obtained for a limited period through a quest, and Andre de Lou-Oshiba, a recent addition based on the real-life Japanese comedian. Other regional servers starting from the Korean server has since modified Mifuyu and released her as Asoka, with different stats and stances. The Japanese server has since released an alternate Asoka with a dark-colored scheme compared the original Mifuyu, who sports a red/white-color scheme. =Factions/Clans= A Family may join a faction (clan). A faction can hold up to a hundred players. When a faction feels it is powerful enough, it may challenge and attempt to complete two quests to raise its faction/clan level to 51, then 52. Upon completion of the second quest, a faction may choose to join either the Royalist or Republican Party, in which faction members gain a buff which raises their family level. Every Saturday evening (North American time) or Sunday evening (Singapore time) these factions compete against each other in a Colony War to control the colonies located in various zones of the world map. As an incentive, factions which occupy a colony are rewarded with vis based on the number of colonies they occupy. With the V7.0 patch, factions may join either Lealtad (Esmero) or Gleichstellung (Souveran), which are the secret militant arms of the Royalist and Republican parties respectively. Individual faction members can also join these secret societies to gain access to side-quests as well as to raise their respective factions' levels. For every five members who join their faction's affiliated secret society, the faction's level will increase by one as well as increases its members' attack damage on mobs by 2% per level gained. In addition, players belonging to these two opposing secret societies will square off in three different zones, namely the three towns of Cite de Reboldeoux, Port of Coimbra and the City of Auch. This full-scale Alliance War is available every Saturday, and lasts for 90 minutes. Opposing parties not only have to defeat enemy players, but also acquire items scattered all over the map or disarm the opposing party's leader and his/her followers to gain points to gain victory. =Stances, Skills & Level Promotion= Each class has several Stances which have varying level and equipment dependencies. Each stance's level is independent from a character's level. As the character levels a stance they gain skill points that can be used within that stance in addition to increasing the stance's stat bonuses. A stance may have up to five different skills which are unlocked as the stance levels up. Additional generic stances may be purchased at the class Master, from Emilia for constellation expert stances, while some are rewarded via quests. One feature of stances is that stances which have the same equipment requirements can be swapped on the fly using the F5-F8 keys (alternatively, using the number keys 4-7). The musketeer's Standing Shot and Kneeling Shot stances are examples of this, as well as the fighter's Back Guard and High Guard stances. However, stances are limited in that only particular stances may be used with a certain equipment type, e.g., a fighter wanting to use the Roof Guard stance would have to use a Great Sword, rather than a sword and shield. A musketeer wanting to use the Flintlock stance would have to use a Rifle, rather than a pistol. A stance is usable only when it is learned; unlearned stances are greyed-out and unavailable for use. When a new player starts out, their character starts out at Level 1, while the RNPCs he or she recruits start out at various levels. When the characters reach level 100, they are able to be promoted with the use of 25 Shiny Crystals to become Veterans, and in the process create a new leveling system. In later updates, players gain the ability to move beyond Veteran level to become Experts (Level 110-120) and Masters (Level 120 and above). Licensing HanbitSoft, the publisher of the Granado Espada, manages the Korean and Japanese (under its subsidiary Hanbit Ubiquitous Entertainment) servers by itself while regional servers are licensed to various online game companies based in their respective regions. =Localization History= K2 Network announced in January 2007 that they would be bringing Granado Espada to the North American and European markets in Summer 2007 under the title of Sword of the New World. Originally released under a pay-to-play model, the game later became free-to- play on August 21, 2007. K2 Network was subsequently renamed GamersFirst and changed the name of the North American server to Sword 2. GamersFirst announced on 31 October 2012, that due to the expiration of the licensing contract with IMCGames, North American operations of the game would be transferred to T3Fun, a subsidiary of the Korean publisher HanbitSoft. Although GamersFirst had a functional server for the European market, publishing rights for the EU market would be transferred to RNTS Media GmbH after the expiration of the contract. RNTSgames has announced the name of the EU regional server to be Granado Espada - Resurrection. On 10 August 2007, IAHGames, the company which the game is licensed to in Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam as well as Australia and New Zealand, announced its business model for Granado Espada. Subsequently, they informed players that on August 30, 2007, the game would become commercial. IAHGames gave players a 90-day free trial if they achieved Level 20 by that time. New players had a free five-day trial period and after which, they are required to pay. On December 5, 2007, as with other regional servers, the game became free-to- play. On 27 April 2017, IAHGames ceased game service in SEA Server operation. After more than three years of operation The9, licensee and operator of the mainland Chinese regional server, has announced that it would terminate Granado Espada's game service, citing the expiration of its contract with IMC Games. It has since stopped accepting new registrants from September 22, 2010, and began to wind down the regional server gradually. On the midnight of November 22, 2010, the servers officially went down. Game service in Mainland China subsequently resumed in March, 2011 under a new licensee. Astrum Nival, the operator of the Russian regional server, has ceased game service on November 30, 2012. This marked the first time that a Granado Espada regional server has completely ceased service without any transfer to another local operator. =Version Updates= The latest content theme for the Korean server is \\"Return to Orpesia\\". After defeating the evil Viscount Montoro, the player gets the opportunity to return to the old continent of Orpesia, where Bristia, the defeated enemy of Vespanola, announces the opening of a sea route to the New World, linking the midway island of Viron (Byron) to the Bristian port city of Kielce. The player then gets involved in a new main quest line and aids the Bristian Liberation Army to free their homeland from Vespanolan hegemony. With the release of the \\"Return to Orpesia\\" expansion, version numberings have returned to 1.0, with an added \\"B\\", which either stands for \\"Bristia\\" or \\"Beginning\\" to symbolize a major milestone in the game's content and storyline. As of April 2013, the Korean, Japanese, Taiwanese, Southeast Asian and North American regional servers have upgraded to the new \\"Return to Orpesia\\" series. However, the Korean servers reverted to the original version numberings on January 9, 2013, reason being that the new \\"B\\" version series caused confusion. Thus, IMC decided to revert to the original numberings which is still used by its internal development team. Subsequent patches to other regional servers also followed suit. The current version is Symphonia Episode 2 in T3Fun server.  Reception  Critical reaction to the North American release has been mixed. IGN's Metacritic lists an average rating for the game at 66, which is also the listed industry average for all games at the site. GameRankings has the game listed at a similar figure of 70%. GameSpot gave a rating of 4.0 (out of 10.0) citing \\"tedious quests and little payoff\\". IGN expressed similar concerns, noting the familiar grind between many other Korean MMOs. \\"You know, it's frustrating because as much as you want to like this game, unless Korean is your preferred flavor of MMO, you probably just won't.\\" X play on G4 gave it a 4 out of 5; Reviewer Adam Sessler was pleased, noting that out of all the free MMORPGs this one was worth playing, saying it was refreshing to have a setting other than a fantasy world, and citing the unique gameplay mechanic of the MCC system. PC Gamer magazine, also gave it a positive review, giving the game a 90% out of 100% rating, saying it \\"offered a fresh feel through small improvements and one substantial innovation\\" compared to other Korean MMOs.

It was released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 2. The planned Dreamcast version was cancelled. The plot involves a squad of four law enforcement agents investigating the disappearances of people by working their way downwards through layers of a towering mega-city. Project Eden's gameplay emphasises puzzle-solving, requiring the player or players to control each of the four characters and use their individual abilities to make progress. A single player can control any one of the characters, and jump between them at will or up to four players can play simultaneously as different members of the team. Plot The game starts with Urban Protection Agency agents Carter, Andre, Minoko and Amber heading below city limits to find two technicians missing from the Real Meat Company (a corporation that ironically produces synthetic meat). The suspicions of the team revolve around a local and dangerous gang named The Death Heads. The UPA team tracks the gang down to their base in St. Lucia's Church; but on their way, the gang members and many animals also start mutating into strange creatures. Clearing their way through the Church, battling the mutants, the UPA Team finally get close to the technicians, only to see them being taken far below city limits, possibly to ground zero (the term used for the ground level of the earth itself). The UPA Control instructs the UPA Team to recover a creature, a live one, for analysis; which shows that it has been a regular dog which had been tampered with using an old Gene splicer (this hints at the fact that genetic technology has advanced greatly). The analysis also reveals that the creatures they have been attacked by are being controlled by a signal; which is their next job, to both find and if possible, recover the technicians, and locate the source of the signal. On their way the UPA Team encounter little girls who are blonde, wear a red dress and call themselves Lucy. After some talk they mutate into dangerous beasts. Minoko, while going to another sector of the city by a high-speed railcar, mentions that she once had a sister named Lucy, but that Lucy had died due to a genetic illness she and their mother suffered from. As they continue, the team starts to question if Minoko's family was involved in their situation. The train crashes before reaching its destination, and leaves Minoko trapped in by a group of cannibals. Upon their arrival, Carter asks Control to check out Minoko's father, Dr. Joseph Molenski, who was once a skilled technician and a biological engineer, and who was sacked from Real Meat for stealing machinery for his own research. As a fugitive, Molenski was never acquired by UPA, nor was Lucy. Minoko was taken to the UPA Recreation Program, and thus became a UPA Agent. After traversing a former zoo that is now inhabited by cannibals and mutants, the team arrive at Ground Zero, the nominal ground level of the city. The team continues to levels below sea level. During their investigation, they stumble upon a video of Dr. Molenski, saying that he has found a nuclear bunker underneath, and has also rigged up a basic gene splicer. He also mentions that using it, he hopes to cure Lucy. The UPA Team enter the Eden Bunker, and upon their entrance, they discover that Dr. Molenski was trapped in a time dilation field, a field that which stops time around a given area, or slows it down immensely; similar to the effect of the team's Timeshock weapon. Molenski appears to be reaching out towards a computer. After deactivating the time dilation field, Minoko is kidnapped. Lucy tells Minoko that she has been creating the creatures, and the girls that mutated (in attempt to find a new body for herself) were her failures due to the different DNA of those girl victims that were too much to deal with. Since Minoko is her biological sister, Lucy wishes to take her body. Meanwhile, Molenski is told that fifteen years have passed, and asked what has happened. The answer is simple; in order to keep Lucy alive, Molenski had linked her mind to the computers, running half of her brain with them, while keeping her body in a time dilation field. However, since the computers were networked, Lucy took them over and tried to solve things her way. The other three UPA Team members rescue Minoko, and they deactivate Lucy's time dilation field causing her death. Molenski removes the computer connected to Lucy's head and inserts it into a robot body he has built for her to try to keep her brain alive. Mission accomplished, the UPA Team returns to the surface. Critical reception Project Eden received \\"average\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The Electric Playground gave the PC version a favorable review and said, \\"A few minor annoyances like poor enemy AI and some puzzles that seem almost too difficult keep it from a higher score, but if you‚Äôre looking for a game you can invest some time in and not feel like you came away with nothing, welcome to Eden.\\" AllGame gave both console versions three stars out of five each, saying of the PC version, \\"Playing Project Eden at least once is worthwhile, but the linear puzzles, bad combat engine, and a multiplayer component that utilizes it limit hard-drive life considerably. Once finished, it's doubtful any gamer will return to the city depths\\"; and of the PlayStation 2 version, \\"It is designed specifically for those who enjoy using their minds, and it will occasionally even frustrate the best of those players.\\" Kevin Rice reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"This game needs a coat of wax and a buffing, but the creativity in its design and execution warrant playing through.\\" IGN ranked it as the 87th best PlayStation 2 game. Project Eden was a nominee for GameSpot's 2001 \\"Best Adventure Game\\" award, which ultimately went to Myst III: Exile.

Based in Leesburg, Virginia, it maintains offices in a number of countries, according to its masthead, including Wiesbaden, Berlin, Copenhagen, Paris, Melbourne, and Mexico City. As of 2009, the editor of EIR was Nancy Spannaus.Spannaus, Nancy. Alexander Hamilton To Be Celebrated on His 250th Birthday, New York Sun, January 11, 2007; there are also references in EIR to her as editor up to August 2009. As of 2015, it was reported that Nancy Spannaus was no longer editor-in-chief, that position being held jointly by Paul Gallagher and Tony Papert. EIR is a publication owned by the LaRouche movement. Others include The New Federalist; 21st Century Science and Technology; Nouvelle Solidarit√© in France; Neue Solidarit√§t, published by LaRouche's B√ºrgerrechtsbewegung Solidarit√§t in Germany; and Fidelio, a quarterly magazine published by the Schiller Institute, also in Germany. The New Solidarity International Press Service, or NSIPS, was a news service credited as the publisher of EIR and other LaRouche publications.Peter Knight, ed., \\"Conspiracy Theories in American History: An Encyclopedia\\", ABC CLIO, 2003, p. 245 The New Federalist suspended publication in 2006 as a result of financial problems; Fidelio magazine published its last number in 2006 because editor Kenneth Kronberg decided to stop working on it; in April 2007 he committed suicide. New Solidarity International Press Service was supplanted by EIR News Service because New Solidarity newspaper was closed in 1987, after the massive 1986 Federal raid on LaRouche's headquarters in Leesburg, VA. __TOC__ Background The Wheat Building in Leesburg, offices of Executive Intelligence Review in the 1980s John Rausch writes that the magazine emerged from LaRouche's desire in the 1970s to form a global intelligence network. His idea was to organize the network as if it were a news service, which led to his founding The New Solidarity International Press Service (NSIPS), incorporated by three of LaRouche's followers in 1974. According to Rausch, this allowed the LaRouche movement to gain access to government officials under press cover. As NSIPS's funds grew, EIR was created.Rausch, John David. Executive Intelligence Review in Knight, Peter (ed.) Conspiracy Theories in American History: An Encyclopedia, Volume 1, ABC- CLIO, 2003, p. 245. In the 1980s an annual subscription cost $400.Hines (1986) Nora Hamerman, an EIR editor, said in 1990 that the magazine had a circulation of 8,000 to 10,000.Stern (1990) She indicated the magazine was owned by the EIR News Service, but declined to say who owned the news service. An ad on a LaRouche website urged readers to subscribe. \\"As you will quickly discover, the Executive Intelligence Review is not an ordinary weekly news magazine. Every week, EIR runs unique political analyses, reports and interviews which you can't find anywhere else.\\"Wheen (1998) The magazine has published many controversial articles, including claims that Queen Elizabeth II is the head of an international drug-smuggling cartel, that another member of the British royal family killed Roberto Calvi, the Italian banker who died in London in 1982, and that the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 was the first strike in a British attempt to take over the United States. In 1997 it published review of the book \\"La face cachee de Greenpeace\\" (The hidden face of Greenpeace), which claimed that Greenpeace \\"is an irregular warfare apparatus in the service of the British oligarchy\\".Emmanuel Grenier, \\"Infiltrator rips the mask from Greenpeace in Europe\\", EIR Volume 24, Number 4, January 17, 1997, p.69. The magazine occasionally expands its articles into book-length pieces, which have included Dope, Inc: The Book that Drove Henry Kissinger Crazy (1992) and The Ugly Truth about the ADL. Rausch writes that, despite the connection to LaRouche, EIR has received attention from the mainstream press on a handful of occasions. In 1988, one of its reporters, Nicholas Benton, received an answer during a press conference from President Ronald Reagan in response to a question about Michael Dukakis, which received considerable attention from other news outlets. In 1998, one of its senior writers, Jeffrey Steinberg, was interviewed on British television regarding LaRouche's theory that the British royal family had ordered the assassination of Diana, Princess of Wales. EIR has been described as the \\"foremost exponent of the 'murder, not accident' theory\\" of Diana's death.NORTON-TAYLOR & PALLISTER (1999) In 1999, EIR made international news when it listed on its website the names of 117 agents of the United Kingdom's MI6 intelligence service, a list claimed to have been obtained from renegade agent Richard Tomlinson (although the government later conceded that the list did not originate with him). An EIR spokesman said they received the information unsolicited.Leppard & Rufford (1999) EIR offices were searched in 1986 as part of an investigation into LaRouche-related businesses. In 1988, EIR offices shared with another LaRouche entity, Fusion Energy Foundation, were seized to pay contempt of court fines related to the investigation. Contributing editor Webster Tarpley said that the closure was an effort by \\"the invisible, secret, parallel government\\" to silence LaRouche because of his presidential campaigns. LaRouche and several EIR staff members were eventually convicted of mail fraud and other charges. For more information see LaRouche criminal trials. Following criticism of financier George Soros by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in 1997, Malayasian news media began printing vitriolic reports of Soros, some of them sourced to EIR or even copying text from the magazine verbatim. Ahmad Kassim, a politician who was instrumental in introducing LaRouche's ideas to Malaysians, described EIR as a \\"news service like Reuters or anything else\\" and compared LaRouche to Abraham Lincoln. Iran's government-controlled Press TV often interviews analysts from the EIR, including a 2013 interview with its spokesman Lawrence Freeman which concluded that the West was liable for the Algeria hostage taking. Press TV supported his conclusion that \\"the US and their puppets Saudi Arabia and Qatar which have in the first place played a role in the creation of rebels are the root cause of incidents such as that which took place in Algeria.\\"'West liable for Algeria hostage taking' PressTVGlobalNewsUS fuels Syria crisis to destabilize the entire Middle East: Analyst Sept 5, 2012  Criticism  In 2002 Arnaud de Borchgrave, Editor-in- Chief for The Washington Times, called Executive Intelligence Review \\"an anti- Semitic potpourri of disinformation, factoids, rumor, gossip, loony tunes and an occasional fact.\\" EIR Counterintelligence Director Jeffrey Steinberg refers to that paper as the \\"Moonie Washington Times\\".Steinberg, Jeffrey, \\"Will Moonie Money Be Used in Netanyahu-Sharon Election Theft? , EIR, November 15, 2002Steinberg, Jeffrey, \\"LaRouche Points to Marc Rich's White House Mole: Lewis Libby\\", February 7, 2003 The Washington Times was founded by Sun Myung Moon.

Since 1961 it has been part of the Republic of Cameroon, where it makes up the Northwest Region and Southwest Region. Since 1994, pressure groups in the territory claim there was no legal Document (Treaty of Union) in accordance to UNGA RES 1608(XV) paragraph 5, and are seeking to restore statehood and independence from the Republic of Cameroon. They renamed British Southern Cameroons as Ambazonia (from Ambas Bay). League of Nations mandate Following the Treaty of Versailles, the German territory of Kamerun was divided on June 28, 1919, between a French and a British League of Nations Mandate, the French, who had previously administered the whole occupied territory, getting the larger. The French mandate was known as Cameroun. The British mandate comprised two adjacent territories, Northern Cameroons and Southern Cameroons. They were administered from, but not joined to, the British territory of Nigeria through the British Resident (although some incumbents had the rank of District Officer, Senior Resident or Deputy Resident) with headquarters in Buea. Applying the principle of indirect rule, the British allowed native authorities to administer populations according to their own traditions. These also collected taxes, which were then paid over to the British. The British devoted themselves to trade, and to exploiting the economic and mining resources of the territory. South Cameroons students, including Emmanuel Mbela Lifafa Endeley, created the Cameroons Youth League (CYL) on 27 March 1940, to oppose what they saw as the exploitation of their country. Trust territory When the League of Nations ceased to exist in 1946, most of the mandate territories were reclassified as UN trust territories, henceforth administered through the UN Trusteeship Council. The object of trusteeship was to prepare the lands for eventual independence. The United Nations approved the Trusteeship Agreements for British Cameroons to be governed by Britain on 6 December 1946. Southern Cameroons was divided in 1949 into two provinces: Bamenda (capital Bamenda, hence also thus named) and Southern (capital Buea). Yet the residential type of administration was continued with a single British Resident at Buea, but in 1949 Edward John Gibbons was appointed Special Resident, and on 1 October 1954, when political power shifted to the elected government, succeeded himself as first of only two commissioners. Following the Ibadan General Conference of 1950, a new constitution for Nigeria devolved more power to the regions. In the subsequent election thirteen Southern Cameroonian representatives were elected to the Eastern Nigerian House of Assembly in Enugu. In 1953, however, the Southern Cameroons representatives, unhappy with the domineering attitude of Nigerian politicians and lack of unity among the ethnic groups in the Eastern Region, declared a \\"benevolent neutrality\\" and withdrew from the assembly. At a conference in London from 30 July to 22 August 1953, the Southern Cameroons delegation asked for a separate region of its own. The British agreed, and Southern Cameroons became an autonomous region with its capital still at Buea. Elections were held in 1954 and the parliament met on 1 October 1954, with E.M.L. Endeley as Premier. As Cameroun and Nigeria prepared for Independence, South Cameroons nationalists debated whether their best interests lay with union with Cameroun, union with Nigeria or total independence. Endeley was defeated in elections on 1 February 1959 by John Ngu Foncha. Referendums were held in 1959 and 1961 in the Cameroons to determine union with Nigeria or Cameroun. In 1961, Northern Cameroons voted for union with Nigeria and Southern Cameroons for union with (the formerly French) Cameroun. Ambazonian independence movement Flag of the Ambazonian independence movement Southern Cameroons became part of Cameroon on 1 October 1961. Foncha served as Prime Minister of West Cameroun and Vice-President of the Federal Republic of Cameroun. However, the English-speaking peoples of the Southern Cameroons (now West Cameroun) did not believe that they were fairly treated by the French- speaking government of the country. Following a referendum on 20 May 1972, a new constitution was adopted in Cameroun which replaced the federal state with a unitary state. Southern Cameroons lost its autonomous status and became the Northwest Province and Southwest Province of the Republic of Cameroun. The Southern Cameroonians felt further marginalised. Groups such as the Cameroon Anglophone Movement (CAM) demanded greater autonomy, or independence, for the provinces. Pro-independence groups claim that UN Resolution 1608 21 April 1961, which required the UK, the Government of the Southern Cameroons and Republic of Cameroun to engage in talks with a view to agreeing measures for union of the two countries, was not implemented, and that the Government of the United Kingdom was negligent in terminating its trusteeship without ensuring that proper arrangements were made. They say that the adoption of a federal constitution by Cameroun on 1 September 1961 constituted annexation of South Cameroons. Representatives of Anglophone groups convened the first All Anglophone Conference (AAC1) in Buea from 2 April to 3 April 1993. The conference issued the \\"Buea Declaration\\", which called for constitutional amendments to restore the 1961 federation. This was followed by the second All Anglophone Conference (AAC2) in Bamenda in 1994. This conference issued the \\"Bamenda Declaration\\", which stated that if the federal state was not restored within a reasonable time, Southern Cameroons would declare its independence. The AAC was renamed the Southern Cameroons Peoples Conference (SCPC), and later the Southern Cameroons Peoples Organisation (SCAPO), with the Southern Cameroons National Council (SCNC) as the executive governing body. Younger activists formed the Southern Cameroons Youth League (SCYL) in Buea on 28 May 1995. The SCNC sent a delegation, led by John Foncha, to the United Nations, which was received on 1 June 1995 and presented a petition against the 'annexation' of the Southern Cameroons by French Cameroun. This was followed by a signature referendum the same year, which the organisers claim produced a 99% vote in favour of independence with 315,000 people voting.Southern Cameroons Peoples Organisation website Armed members of the SCNC took over the Buea radio station in Southwest Province on the night of 30 December 1999 and in the early hours of 31 December broadcast a tape of a proclamation of independence read by Judge Ebong Frederick Alobwede. Amnesty International has accused the Cameroun authorities of human right violations against South Cameroons activists. =Complaint with the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights = On 9 January 2003, the SCNC and SCAPO filed a complaint with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights against the Republic of Cameroun.registered as Communication n¬∞ 266/2003 Re: Kevin Ngwane Ngumne and Co., acting on their behalf and on behalf of SCNC/SCAPO and the Southern Cameroons versus the State of Cameroon Among other allegations, the complainants alleged that the Republic of Cameroun is illegally occupying the territory of Southern Cameroons. The Complainants alleged that the Republic of Cameroon has violated Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7(1), 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17(1), 19, 20, 21, 22, 23(1), 24 of the African Charter. The SCNC and SCAPO ultimately seek the independence of the territory of Southern Cameroons. In a decision reached at its 45th Ordinary Session on May 27, 2009, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights found that the Republic of Cameroun has violated Articles 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7(1), 10, 11, 19 and 26 the Charter. The Human Rights Commission determined that Articles 12, 13, 17(1), 20, 21, 22, 23(1) and 24 have not been violated. The Human Rights Commission further recognized that under the African Charter and broad international law, Southern Cameroons meets the definition of a \\"people\\" under international law \\"because they manifest numerous characteristics and affinities, which include a common history, linguistic tradition, territorial connection, and political outlook\\". The Human Rights Commission declared itself incompetent rationae temporis, to rule on allegations that occurred prior to 18 December 1989, date on which the African Charter came into force for the Respondent State (Republic of Cameroun). Hence, the Human Rights Commission declared itself incompetent to rule on the complainants' allegations with respect to events that occurred from the 1961 United Nations plebiscite to 1972 when the Federal and Union Constitutions were adopted to form the United Republic of Cameroon during which the Complainants claim the Respondent State (Republic of Cameroun) \\"...established its colonial rule there, complete with its structures, and its administrative, military and police personnel, applying a system and operating in a language alien to the Southern Cameroon.\\" The Human Rights Commission stated, however, that, if the Complainants can establish that any violation committed before 18 December 1989 continued thereafter, then the Commission shall have competence to examine it. The Human Rights Commission addressed the question, whether the people of Southern Cameroons are entitled to the right to self-determination contextualizing the question by dealing, not with the 1961 UN Plebiscite, or the 1972 Unification, but rather the events of 1993 and 1994 on the constitutional demands vis-√†-vis the claim for the right to self-determination of the Southern Cameroonian people. The Human Rights Commission stated that to invoke Self Determination as prescribed by Article 20 the African Charter, the Complainant must satisfy the Commission that the two conditions under Article 20(2), namely oppression and domination have been met. Based on events that occurred after December 18, 1989, the Human Rights Commission noted that the Complainants have not demonstrated if these conditions have been met to warrant invoking the right to self-determination. The Human Rights Commission also noted that in their submission, the Respondent State (Republic of Cameroun) implicitly accepted that self-determination may be exercisable by the Complainants on condition that they establish cases of massive violations of human rights or denial of participation in public affairs. The Human Rights Commission noted that autonomy within a sovereign state is acceptable, in the context of self- government, confederacy, or federation while preserving the territorial integrity of a State party, can be exercised under the African Charter. The Human Rights Commission recommended that the Respondent State (Republic of Cameroun) should among other things enter into constructive dialogue with the Complainants, and in particular SCNC and SCAPO, to resolve the constitutional issues, as well as grievances. Bakassi Peninsula Following the International Court of Justice ruling of 10 October 2002 that sovereignty over the Bakassi peninsula rested with Cameroon, SCAPO claimed that Bakassi was, in fact, part of the territory of Southern Cameroons. In 2002, SCAPO took the Nigerian government to the Federal High Court in Abuja to require it to take a case before the International Court of Justice to establish the right of the people of the Southern Cameroons to self-determination. The court ruled in their favour on 5 March 2002. On 14 August 2006 Nigeria handed over the Bakassi peninsula to Cameroon. SCAPO responded by proclaiming the independence of the Republic of Ambazonia, to include the territory of Bakassi. Southern Cameroons, since then renamed to Ambazonia, is a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) since 2005 and a charter member of the Organization of Emerging African States (OEAS).

It is one of the medical colleges affiliated to Khyber Medical University. AMC is home to 1,500 students in the MBBS and BDS programs, with clinical rotations at Ayub Teaching Hospital. Faculty members hold appointments at basic sciences and clinical departments. There are 212 full-time faculty members: lecturers, assistant professors, associate professors and professors.  History  Ayub Khan In the late 1960s, a government study concluded that more medical colleges were needed in Pakistan to improve medical education, research and healthcare in the country. In particular, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was in dire need of health reforms - a decision was thus made in 1972 to construct another medical college outside of the Peshawar region. In 1975, four cities were shortlisted for the site of the new college; Abbottabad, Dera Ismail Khan, Mingora and Chitral. A decision was made in 1978 to build the new college in Abbottabad and on 9 May 1979, classes started at Ayub Medical College. The first batch consisting of 100 students (class of 1984) was accommodated at the Education Extension Centre, while the present college campus and teaching hospital were later on constructed north of the town. On 30 December 1990, the new campus opened its doors to students and faculty. Abbottabad District Headquarters Hospital remained affiliated to Ayub Medical College upon opening of Ayub Teaching Hospital in 1998. AMC was named after former President Ayub Khan, who hailed from nearby Haripur. The first Principal of AMC was Dr. Abdul Jamil Khan. Today AMC hosts one of the largest medical college campuses in Pakistan. Academics The Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery are awarded to students after five professional years of theoretical and clinical training. AMC features 24 clinical and 8 basic science departments with 212 full-time faculty members involved in teaching, patient care and advancing medical knowledge through scholarly clinical and basic science research. Annually, AMC educates and trains approximately 1000 medical students along with 200 resident physicians and fellows. In addition to offering the MBBS degree, AMC offers a BDS degree for dental students. In 2010, AMC introduced Community Oriented Medical Education (COME), a form of problem-based learning in a bid to convert from the annual system to a semester system. However the transition has been slow and faced a lot of problems regarding its acceptance and experience by the teachers and the taught. Graduates are eligible to apply for a medical license from the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council following the completion of the degree and one year of house job at a teaching hospital. = Undergraduate programs = * Bachelor of Medicine & Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) * Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) * Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BScN) = Postgraduate programs = * Fellow of College of Physicians & Surgeons Pakistan (FCPS) * Member of College of Physicians & Surgeons Pakistan (MCPS)  Recognition  AMC is fully recognized by the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC). The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Pakistan has recognized many of its departments for post-graduate training in Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery and Pathology.

Cord blood is collected because it contains stem cells, which can be used to treat hematopoietic and genetic disorders.  Constituents  Cord blood is composed of all the elements found in whole blood - red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma, platelets. Compared to whole blood some differences in the blood composition exist, for example, cord blood contains higher numbers of natural killer cells, lower absolute number of T-cells and a higher proportion of immature T-cells. However, the interest in cord blood is mostly driven by the observation that cord blood also contains various types of stem and progenitor cells, mostly hematopoietic stem cells. Some non-hematopoietic stem cell types are also present in cord blood, for example, mesenchymal stem cells, however these are present in much lower numbers that can be found in adult bone marrow. Endothelial progenitor cells and multipotent unrestricted adult stem cells can also be found in cord blood. The stem cells found in cord blood are often confused with embryonic stem cells - unlike embryonic stem cells, cord blood stem cells are all types of adult stem cells, are lineage restricted and are not pluripotent.  Medical uses  Cord blood is used the same way that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is used to reconstitute bone marrow following radiation treatment for various blood cancers, and for various forms of anemia. Its efficacy is similar as well.  Adverse effects in Transplantation  Adverse effects are similar to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, namely graft-versus-host disease if the cord blood is from a genetically different person, and the risk of severe infection while the immune system is reconstituted. To assure that the smallest amount of complications occur during transplantation, levels of engraftment must be present; specifically both neutrophils and platelets must be being produced.Waller-Wise, R. (2011). Umbilical Cord Blood: Information for Childbirth Educators. The Journal of Perinatal Education, 20(1), 54‚Äì60. http://doi.org/10.1891/1058-1243.20.1.54 This process of neutrophil and platelet production after the transplant, however, takes much longer than that of stem cells. In many cases, the engraftment time depends on the cell dose, or the amount of stem cells obtained in the sample of blood. In Dr. Moise's article about umbilical cord blood Moise K. J. (2005). Umbilical cord stem cells. Obstetrics and Gynecology, 106(6), 1393‚Äì1407 [PubMed] (as cited in ), it was found that there is approximately 10% less stem cells in cord blood than there is in bone marrow. Therefore a sufficient amount of cord blood must be obtained in order to collect an adequate cell dose, however this amount varies from infant to infant and is irreplaceable. Given that this idea is quite new, there is still a lot of research that needs to be completed. For example, it is still unknown how long cord blood can safely be frozen without losing its beneficial effects. There is a lower incidence with cord blood compared with traditional HSCT, despite less stringent HLA match requirements.  Collection and storage  Umbilical cord blood is the blood left over in the placenta and in the umbilical cord after the birth of the baby. There are several methods for collecting cord blood. The method most commonly used in clinical practice is the \\"closed technique\\", which is similar to standard blood collection techniques. With this method, the technician cannulates the vein of the severed umbilical cord using a needle that is connected to a blood bag, and cord blood flows through the needle into the bag. On average, the closed technique enables collection of about 75 ml of cord blood. Collected cord blood is cryopreserved and then stored in a cord blood bank for future transplantation. Cord blood collection is typically depleted of red blood cells before cryopreservation to ensure high rates of stem cell recovery. The leading cord blood banks in the U.S. include Americord, Cord Blood Registry, Viacord.  History  The first successful cord blood transplant (CBT) was done in 1988 in a child with Fanconi anemia. Early efforts to use CBT in adults led to mortality rates of about 50%, due somewhat to the procedure being done in very sick people, but perhaps also due to slow development of immune cells from the transplant. By 2013, 30,000 CBT procedures had been performed and banks held about 600,000 units of cord blood.  Society and culture = Regulation = The AABB has generated accreditation standards for cord blood banking facilities. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration regulates any facility that stores cord blood; cord blood intended for use in the person from whom it came is not regulated, but cord blood for use in others is regulated as a drug and as a biologic. Several states also have regulations for cord blood banks. In Europe, Canada, and Australia use of cord blood is regulated as well. In the United Kingdom the NHS Cord Blood Bank was set up in 1996 to collect, process, store and supply cord blood; it is a public cord blood bank and part of the NHS. = Private and public banks= A cord blood bank may be private (i.e. the blood is stored for and the costs paid by donor families) or public (i.e. stored and made available for use by unrelated donors). While public cord blood banking is widely supported, private cord banking is controversial in both the medical and parenting community. Although umbilical cord blood is well-recognized to be useful for treating hematopoietic and genetic disorders, some controversy surrounds the collection and storage of umbilical cord blood by private banks for the baby's use. Only a small percentage of babies (estimated at between 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 200,000) ever use the umbilical cord blood that is stored. The American Academy of Pediatrics 2007 Policy Statement on Cord Blood Banking stated: \\"Physicians should be aware of the unsubstantiated claims of private cord blood banks made to future parents that promise to insure infants or family members against serious illnesses in the future by use of the stem cells contained in cord blood.\\" and \\"private storage of cord blood as 'biological insurance' is unwise\\" unless there is a family member with a current or potential need to undergo a stem cell transplantation. The American Academy of Pediatrics also notes that the odds of using a person's own cord blood is 1 in 200,000 while the Institute of Medicine says that only 14 such procedures have ever been performed. Private storage of one's own cord blood is unlawful in Italy and France, and it is also discouraged in some other European countries. The American Medical Association states \\"Private banking should be considered in the unusual circumstance when there exists a family predisposition to a condition in which umbilical cord stem cells are therapeutically indicated. However, because of its cost, limited likelihood of use, and inaccessibility to others, private banking should not be recommended to low-risk families.\\" The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also encourage public cord banking and discourage private cord blood banking. Nearly all cord blood transplantations come from public banks, rather than private banks, partly because most treatable conditions can't use a person's own cord blood. The World Marrow Donor Association and European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies states \\"The possibility of using one's own cord blood stem cells for regenerative medicine is currently purely hypothetical....It is therefore highly hypothetical that cord blood cells kept for autologous use will be of any value in the future\\" and \\"the legitimacy of commercial cord blood banks for autologous use should be questioned as they sell a service which has presently no real use regarding therapeutic options.\\" The American Academy of Pediatrics supports efforts to provide information about the potential benefits and limitations of cord blood banking and transplantation so that parents can make an informed decision. In addition, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that if a patient requests information on umbilical cord blood banking, balanced information should be given. Cord blood education is also supported by legislators at the federal and state levels. In 2005, the National Academy of Sciences published an Institute of Medicine (IoM) report titled \\"Establishing a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Program\\". In March 2004, the European Union Group on Ethics (EGE) has issued Opinion No.19Opinion No. 19 , European Union Group on Ethics titled Ethical Aspects of Umbilical Cord Blood Banking. The EGE concluded that \\"[t]he legitimacy of commercial cord blood banks for autologous use should be questioned as they sell a service, which has presently, no real use regarding therapeutic options. Thus they promise more than they can deliver. The activities of such banks raise serious ethical criticisms.\\"  Research  Though uses of cord blood beyond blood and immunological disorders is speculative, some research has been done in other areas. Any such potential beyond blood and immunological uses is limited by the fact that cord cells are hematopoietic stem cells (which can differentiate only into blood cells), and not pluripotent stem cells (such as embryonic stem cells, which can differentiate into any type of tissue). Cord blood has been studied as a treatment for diabetes. However, apart from blood disorders, the use of cord blood for other diseases is not in routine clinical use and remains a major challenge for the stem cell community. Along with cord blood, Wharton's jelly and the cord lining have been explored as sources for mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), and as of 2015 had been studied in vitro, in animal models, and in early stage clinical trials for cardiovascular diseases, as well as neurological deficits, liver diseases, immune system diseases, diabetes, lung injury, kidney injury, and leukemia. Cord blood is being used to get stem cells with which to test in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The stem cells from umbilical cord blood are also being used in the treatment of a number of blood diseases including blood cancers. Cord blood is also being studied as a substitute for normal blood transfusions in the developing world.http://www.bmj.com/rapid-response/2011/10/28/do-not-discard-9999of- human-placental-umbilical-cord-blood-sake-stem-cells More research is necessary prior to the generalized utilization of cord blood transfusion.

It is a white, water-soluble solid although samples are typically brownish because of its sensitivity toward oxygen. It is one of three isomeric benzenetriols.  Production, occurrence, reactions It is produced in the manner it was first prepared by Scheele (1786): heating gallic acid. Presently gallic acid is obtained from tannin. Heating induces decarboxylation: 450px Because tannin is expensive, many alternative routes have been devised. An alternate preparation involves treating para-chlorophenoldisulfonic acid with potassium hydroxide, a variant on the time-honored route to phenols from sulfonic acids. The aquatic plant Myriophyllum spicatum produces pyrogallic acid. When in alkaline solution, it absorbs oxygen from the air, turning brown from a colourless solution. It can be used in this way to calculate the amount of oxygen in air, notably via the use of the Orsat apparatus.  Uses  One can find its uses in hair dyeing, dyeing of suturing materials and for oxygen absorption in gas analysis. It also has antiseptic properties. Pyrogallol was also used as a developing agent in black-and-white developers, but its use is largely historical except for special purpose applications. Hydroquinone is more commonly used today. It is also used in isolation of inert gases from a mixture of gases, which requires absorption of oxygen from the mixture. = Use in photography = Though a popular photographic developing agent in the 19th and early 20th centuries, pyrogallol largely fell out of favor around the 1920s, although it was still used by a few notable photographers including Edward Weston. In those days it had a reputation for erratic and unreliable behavior, due possibly to its propensity for oxidation. It experienced a revival starting in the 1980s due largely to the efforts of experimenters Gordon Hutchings and John Wimberley.  PMK  Hutchings spent over a decade working on pyrogallol formulas, eventually producing one he named PMK for its main ingredients: pyrogallol, Metol, and Kodalk (the trade name of Kodak for sodium metaborate). This formulation resolved the consistency issues, and Hutchings found that an interaction between the greenish stain given to film by pyro developers and the color sensitivity of modern variable- contrast photographic papers gave the effect of an extreme compensating developer. From 1969 to 1977, Wimberley experimented with the Pyrogallol developing agent. He published his formula for WD2D in 1977 in Petersen's Photographic. PMK and other modern pyro formulations are now used by many black-and-white photographers. The Film Developing Cookbook has examples.  510-pyro  Another developer mainly based on pyrogallol was formulated by Jay DeFehr. The 510-pyro, is a concentrate that uses Triethanolamine as Alkali, and pyrogallol and phenidone as combined developers. This developer has both staining and tanning properties and negatives developed with it are immune to the callier effect. It can be used for small and large negative formats. The Darkroom Cookbook (Alternative Process Photography) has examples. Safety Pyrogallol use, e.g. in hair dye formulations, is declining because of concerns about its toxicity.Safety data for 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene Its (oral, rat) is 300 mg/kg.

Phospholamban is a 52-amino acid integral membrane protein that regulates the Calcium (Ca2+) pump in cardiac muscle cells.  Function  This protein is found as a pentamer and is a major substrate for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in cardiac muscle. In the unphosphorylated state, phospholamban is an inhibitor of cardiac muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2)https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/potm/2004_3/Page2.htm which transports calcium from cytosol into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When phosphorylated (by PKA) - disinhibition of Ca2+-ATPase of SR leads to faster Ca2+ uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby contributing to the lusitropic response elicited in heart by beta-agonists. The protein is a key regulator of cardiac diastolic function. Mutations in this gene are a cause of inherited human dilated cardiomyopathy with refractory congestive heart failure. When phospholamban is phosphorylated by PKA, its ability to inhibit SERCA2 is lost. Thus, activators of PKA, such as the beta-adrenergic agonist epinephrine (released by sympathetic stimulation), may enhance the rate of cardiac myocyte relaxation. In addition, since SERCA2 is more active, the next action potential will cause an increased release of calcium, resulting in increased contraction (positive inotropic effect). When phospholamban is not phosphorylated, such as when PKA is inactive, it can interact with and inhibit SERCA. The overall effect of phospholamban is to decrease contractility and the rate of muscle relaxation, thereby decreasing stroke volume and heart rate, respectively.  Clinical significance  Gene knockout of phospholamban results in animals with hyperdynamic hearts, with little apparent negative consequence. Mutations in this gene are a cause of inherited human dilated cardiomyopathy with refractory congestive heart failure.  Discovery  Phospholamban was discovered by Arnold Martin Katz and coworkers in 1974.  Interactions  PLN has been shown to interact with SLN and SERCA1.

Established in 1801, it is a National Historic Landmark, the oldest post in the United States Marine Corps, the official residence of the Commandant of the Marine Corps since 1806, and main ceremonial grounds of the Corps. It is also home to the U.S. Marine Drum and Bugle Corps (\\"The Commandant's Own\\") and the U.S. Marine Band (\\"The President's Own\\"). Barracks Marines conduct ceremonial missions in and around the National Capital Region as well as abroad. They also provide security at designated locations around Washington, D.C. as necessary, and Barracks officers are part of the White House Social Aide Program. Marine Barracks Washington and the Historic Home of the Commandants were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. A property with eight contributing buildings was included in the listing. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. History The Historic Home of the Commandants The buildings at the Marine Barracks are some of the oldest in Washington. In 1801, President Thomas Jefferson and Lt. Col. William Ward Burrows, the commandant of the Marine Corps, rode horses about the new capital to find a place suitable for the Marines near the Washington Navy Yard. They chose a location within marching distance of both the Navy Yard and the Capitol and hired architect George Hadfield to design the barracks and the Commandant's House. When the British burned Washington during the War of 1812, they also captured the Marine barracks. It is traditionally held within the Marine Corps that, out of respect for the brave showing of the Marines at the Battle of Bladensburg, the British refrained from burning the barracks and the Commandant's house. Though neither Admiral Cockburn nor General Ross mentioned the Marines specifically in their conversation with the wounded Commodore Barney, it is now widely acknowledged that the compliment extends towards both Barney's Flotilla men and the 103 Marines present. This was simply due to the fact that Miller's Marines had brought heavier field guns and small arms to act as the core of Barney's line. There is little doubt that Barney's sailors would have held their ground had it not been for the cannons dispensing grape and canister volley after volley into the 85th Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry). This is supported by the fact that Baltimore artillery (also covering the bridge at the Washington Turnpike) on the Marines' right flank was only firing round shot in an attempt to stop Thornton from crossing the bridge. Round shot, in general, is very ineffective against dispersed troops such as the light infantry of the 85th. This account of events still survives: > The people of the flotilla, under the orders of Captain Barney and the > Marines, were justly applauded for their excellent conduct on this occasion. > No troops could have stood better; and the fire of both artillery and > musketry has been described as to the last degree severe. Captain Barney > himself, and Captain Miller, of the Marine Corps, in particular, gained much > additional reputation; and their conspicuous gallantry caused a deep and > general regret that their efforts could not have been sustained by the rest > of the army. The Final Stand at Bladensburg, Maryland, 24 August 1814 The \\"last stand\\" of the sailors and Marines is to this day immortalized by Col. Charles Waterhouse's painting of Captain Miller's Marines manning two of the three 12 lb Gribeuaval type cannons. The three guns themselves were hauled from the Marine barracks onto the battlefield to cover a strategic bridgehead. This event has also been marked by sculptor Joanna Blake of Cottage City in her \\"Undaunted in Battle.\\" It shows a wounded Barney being helped by a Marine and flanked by a sailor presumably representing a member of the \\"Flotilla.\\" The background shows a wheeled cannon, likely one of the three hauled to the battlefield by the Marines. Ones that proved so decisive in holding off the British even if for a brief moment. Square 927, now the block surrounded by 8th & I, and 9th & G Streets S.E., was entered in the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and was then designated a National Historic Landmark by the Department of the Interior in 1976. 8th and I has been the home of the Silent Drill Platoon and the Marine Band since the barracks' establishment in 1801 and the residence of the Commandant since 1806 when the Commandant's House was completed. The Commandant's house is the only original building left in the complex, the remainder having been rebuilt in 1900 and 1907. The Marine Corps Institute moved to the barracks from its previous home at Marine Barracks Quantico in 1920. The Drum and Bugle Corps has been based at the barracks since its formation in 1934. Marine battalion in front of Commandant's House at the Marine Barracks in 1864 The barracks complex is one of the oldest government buildings in continuous use in Washington, D.C., though some sources conflict on whether the White House is a year older. While traditionally known as the \\"oldest post in the Corps\\", Marines did serve at the Charlestown Navy Yard in Boston a year earlier, though they did not have a permanent detachment until 1805 nor a barracks until 1810, and it was vacated in 1974. The Tun Tavern is considered the birthplace of the Corps, having been used for one of the first Continental Marines' recruiting drives in 1775, though it is disputed if it occurred before one at Samuel Nicholas's family tavern, the .

Cree warriors began attacking Canadian settlements on April 2. On April 15, they captured Fort Pitt from a detachment of North-West Mounted Police.  Background  In the Canadian North-West, a period of escalating unrest immediately preceded the rebellion as Ottawa refused to negotiate with its disaffected citizens. While the M√©tis under Louis Riel declared a provisional government and mobilized their forces, Cree chief Big Bear was not planning any militarization or violence toward the Canadian settlers or government. Rather, he had tried to unify the Cree into a political confederacy powerful enough to oppose the marginalization of native people in Canadian society and renegotiate unjust land treaties imposed on Saskatchewan natives in the 1860s. This nominally peaceful disposition was shattered in late March by news of the M√©tis victory over government forces at Duck Lake. Support for Riel was strong among native peoples. On April 2, Big Bear's warriors attacked the town of Frog Lake, killing nine civilians. Big Bear, against his wishes, was drawn into the rebellion. Similar attacks continued, with Cree raiding parties pillaging the towns of Lac La Biche Saddle Lake, Beaverhill Lake, Bear Hills, Lac St. Anne and Green Lake. These events prompted the mobilization of an Alberta field force under Thomas Bland Strange. The Cree would later defeat the Albertans at the Battle of Frenchman's Butte.  Battle  On April 15, 200 Cree warriors descended on Fort Pitt. They intercepted a police scouting party, killing a constable, wounding another, and captured a third. Surrounded and outnumbered, garrison commander Francis Dickens (son of famed novelist Charles Dickens) capitulated and agreed to negotiate with the attackers. Big Bear released the remaining police officers but kept the townspeople as hostages and destroyed the fort. Six days later, Inspector Dickens and his men reached safety at Battleford. Legacy In the spring of 2008, Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed in Duck lake, that \\"the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the prairie M√©tis and First Nations peoples' struggle with Government forces and how it has shaped Canada today.\\" Fort Pitt, the scene of the Battle of Fort Pitt, is a Provincial Park and National Historic site where a National Historic Sites and Monuments plaque designates where Treaty six was signed.

The Gassman indole synthesis This is a one-pot chemical reaction, and none of the intermediates are isolated. R1 can be hydrogen or alkyl, while R2 works best with aryl, but can also be alkyl. Electron-rich anilines, such as 4-methoxyaniline, tend to fail in this reaction. The 3-position thiomethyl group is often removed using Raney nickel to give the 3-H-indole. Reaction mechanism The reaction mechanism of the Gassman indole synthesis The reaction mechanism of the Gassman indole synthesis is divided among three steps. The first step is the oxidation of the aniline 1 using tert-butyl hypochlorite (tBuOCl) to give the chloramine 2. The second step is the addition of the keto-thioether to give the sulfonium ion 3, and is typically done at low temperatures (‚àí78 ¬∞C). The third and final step is the addition of a base, which in this case is triethylamine. Upon warming to room temperature, the base will deprotonate the sulfonium ion creating the sulfonium ylide 4, which quickly undergoes a [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement to give the ketone 5. The ketone 5 will undergo a facile condensation to give the desired 3-thiomethylindole 6.  References   * * Organic Syntheses, Coll.

Description It is an evergreen climbing plant, growing to 20‚Äì30 m high where suitable surfaces (trees, cliffs, walls) are available, and also growing as ground cover where there are no vertical surfaces. It climbs by means of aerial rootlets which cling to the substrate. Native to the Atlantic region, it has been cultivated and can appear in the wild outside its original area, along the Atlantic coast from Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland, British Isles, Germany, Scandinavian countries, and Baltic Sea. The bark is first green, but soon after it becomes gray. Old branches are light gray with a finely furrowed bark. Buds are almost hidden by the leaf base, egg-shaped and bright green. The leaves have entire margins and are ovoid or with five triangular lobes. The surface is glossy dark green with light ribs, while the underside is pale green. The leaves of flowering shoots are, however, oval with entire margins. Flowering occurs in September‚ÄìOctober. The fruits are blue-black berries. The whole plant and also the berries are slightly poisonous. The plant has an attractive and elegant aspect. It is quite common in gardening, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Like the related H. helix (English ivy), H. hibernica is an invasive weed in parts of North America with mild winters: in a recent study, 83% of 119 populations of invasive ivy sampled in the Pacific Northwest were found to be H. hibernica and not H. helix as was previously thought.D.

She was a teenage pop-star in the late-1980s. In 1986, she was the youngest singer to reach number one in the French charts, with the single T'en va pas, and she went on to sell millions of records during the decade. Elsa, her album of 1988, had achieved double-platinum status by 1993. Biography Daughter of George Lunghini (actor, photographer and song writer) and Christiane Jobert (painter and also sister of actress Marl√®ne Jobert and Charles Jobert, a camera operator and director of photography), she is of Italian origin on her father's side, and of Sephardic Jewish origin on her mother's side.Elizabeth Day, \\"Eva Green interview: Playing evil\\", The Guardian, 4 June 2011Telle m√®re, quelle fille , Novembre 2010, Par Sophie Carquain, Madame, Le Figaro She is a cousin of actresses Eva Green and Josephine Jobert. Lunghini first performed in a movie at age seven, in 1981, in Claude Miller's Garde √† vue (also starring Romy Schneider). She was the youngest artist to be in the main program at the Olympia (Paris), at 17, in October 1990 as well as the youngest to have a number 1 hit in the Top 50 in France. At 13, in 1986, she remained number 1 for eight weeks with \\"T'en va pas\\" (soundtrack of the movie La Femme de ma vie). The song was composed by the Italian Romano Musumarra, who had worked and helped produced hits for 80s singer, Jeanne Mas. The song was a hit in France and sold elsewhere in Europe with an English recording. With the help of her musician father, she recorded her LP \\"Elsa\\". It sold more than 600,000 copies with hit singles such as \\"Quelque chose dans mon c≈ìur\\" (\\"Something in my heart\\"), \\"Jour de neige\\" (\\"Snowing day\\"), \\"Jamais nous\\" (with backing vocals by French singer Laurent Voulzy) (\\"Never us\\"), \\"Un Roman d'amiti√©\\" (duet with Glenn Medeiros) (\\"Friend you give me a Reason\\"), \\"√Ä la m√™me heure dans deux ans\\" (\\"At the same time in two years\\"). All were top 10 hits. At that time, Lunghini was the only artist to have her first four singles at number one or two. She became popular in the teen press, often compared with Vanessa Paradis. In 1990, she made her second album, \\"Rien que pour √ßa\\" (\\"Only for that\\"). The songs were produced by her father and Elsa wrote the music for the single of the same name. \\"Rien que pour √ßa\\" was a top 20 hit. Two other excerpts were released: \\"Pleure doucement\\" (\\"Cry softly\\") and \\"Qu'est-ce que √ßa peut lui faire\\" (\\"How does she matter\\"). The two last singles were less successful. She made her first tour, at the Olympia. In 1992, Lunghini recorded \\"Bouscule-moi\\" (\\"Push me on\\"), A mid-rock single with more adult lyrics. \\"Bouscule-moi\\" was a hit single. Her third album was Douce violence (\\"Sweet violence\\"). Two more singles promoted it but they failed to become hits. In 1996, aged 23, she wrote and composed her fourth album, \\"Chaque jour est un long chemin\\" (Every day is a long way). It sold 20,000. From 20 to 24 September 2004, she gave shows in Paris at the Europ√©en. A live DVD and a live CD went on sale in 2006. Lunghini takes part annually in the Tour of the Resto du Coeur soup-kitchen charity and helps causes such as Sol En Si. She has starred in two TV movies: 2002's La mort est rousse and 2004's Trois jours en juin and is now involved in a television advertising campaign for Danone yoghurt. She lives in Paris and, from 1999 to 2006, was the fianc√©e of former footballer Bixente Lizarazu. They met at a Restos du Coeur concert, in which they were taking part. She is also a spokesperson for the Bout de Vie association, which helps the handicapped.

Kaminski participated in discussions on the situation in the scouting sector and the possibility of reactivating ZHP. On 26 November 1956, he met with a group of instructors representing the Krak√≥w community, who were in the process of finalizing the reactivation of ZHP. They refused to support him in the implementation of his concept of reactivating scouting activities within the OHPL (Scouting Organization of the People's Republic of Poland), presenting their position (and evidence) that the only correct solution was to reactivate the ZHP (which they did on 4 December 1956). At that time, at the beginning of December, he held meetings with 25 instructors from the pre-war ZHP. Kami≈Ñski went with them to the meeting of OHPL activists in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, which was transformed into the \\"All-Poland Meeting of Scouting Activists\\" (National Congress of Scouting Activists). He became a member of the Supreme Scouting Council and was later elected Chairman. However, Kami≈Ñski held the position of the Chairman of the council for less than a year and a half.

At the beginning of the 1970s, on the order of the authorities, Kami≈Ñski prepared a report on the consequences of possible introduction of work free Saturdays.He approached that idea critically, drawing attention to the negative social effects of, among other things, \\"weakening of social life ‚Äì meetings, trade union events, etc., weakening of education, training and involvement in public affairs\\". He warned that this could cause \\"hooliganism, drunkenness, erotic entertainment\\" as well as an increase in the number of car accidents due to the increased number of weekend trips. He also quoted GUS data on the rapid growth of alcohol consumption on Saturday evenings.

It was written by Michael Kaplan and directed by John Sanborn. This game is not to be confused with the Japanese-only Psychic Detective series of adventure games developed by DataWest. Plot The game is set in San Francisco where the player assumes the role of Eric Fox (Kevin Breznahan), a psychic who earns his living doing a magic act in a seedy nightclub. One night, he is approached by the exotic Laina Pozok (Beata Pozniak), who senses that Eric is more powerful than he imagines. She trains Eric to \\"hitch hike\\" into people's minds. He sees what his subject sees, and hears what his subject hears; meanwhile, his body continues to interact with the world around him in an \\"automatic pilot-like\\" state. Laina hires Eric to attend a wake being held in honor of her father, who has died under mysterious circumstances. The game begins when Eric enters the Pozok household, and is given the choice to remain in his body, or hitch hike aboard any one of a number of characters he encounters. Eric also has the ability to pick up objects and take a psychic reading of them, providing more clues to help solve the Pozok murder case. Before long, Eric is embroiled in a conspiracy involving a powerful religious cult, spies, and family intrigue, and he also has to deal with his growing romantic attachment to Laina. Occasionally throughout the game, Eric obtains access to \\"psychic collectors\\" which amplify his abilities and allow him to affect the moods and attitudes of the people around him, but at a cost. Gameplay Psychic Detective is generally presented in first person (except during cut scenes), with icons appearing at intervals on the screen signifying people and objects Eric can interact with. Each game generally takes about 45 minutes to play, however multiple plays are required in order to uncover all aspects of the storyline, and there are a dozen alternate endings possible; depending upon the choices made by the player, many different storylines are uncovered, including one that occurs if the player makes no choices and simply watches events unfold. Occasional cut scenes timed to occur at certain points break the storyline into chapters, but which cut scene is viewed depends upon Eric's actions. The endgame portion of Psychic Detective breaks from the linear narrative and involves Eric playing a surreal board game against the villain. Development Psychic Detective was the brainchild of producer Jim Simmons, but the project ultimately involved nearly 200 people: 21 game developers at EA Studios, 80 film crew, and 95 actors. The filming of the video sequences was handled by Colossal Pictures. The footage was shot on location in San Francisco and Oakland, California on twenty days over roughly six weeks. According to John Sanborn, development took over two years: Three months of brainstorming, six months of writing, and one year of editing and programming. The individual segments were edited in Adobe Premiere and authored in a proprietary Electronic Arts software. Release The game was released on the PC, PlayStation and 3DO. The game includes adult language and sexual content in the PC and 3DO versions, which was censored from the PlayStation version. Live action footage from Psychic Detective was edited together to create a short film that was shown at a film festival in the mid-1990s.Executive producer Jim Simmons, quoted on Beata Pozniak's official website, accessed Feb. 14, 2011. Reception The game received mixed reviews on its first release. Arinn Dembo, writing for Computer Gaming World, gave the game 4 stars.Dembo, Arinn; Looking Through the Mind's Spy: Play Head Games in an Interactive Movie that Lives Up to the Name, p. 120. Computer Gaming World, Issue 144, July 1996 GameSpot gave the PC version a 4.7, calling the game \\"innovative\\", but asserting that the overabundance of interaction and storyline branches turns the experience into a confusing mess. They concluded \\"Instead of being like a good movie enhanced by interactivity, Psychic Detective is a more like a movie... clouded with interactive options that eventually detract from the project.\\"Young, Jeffrey Adam (May 1, 1996). PC version review, Gamespot. GamePro gave the 3DO version a positive review, calling it \\"an entertaining interactive mystery game with an adult sensibility.\\" They found the game an engaging challenge due to the need to be head-hopping in the right person at the right time and listen carefully to the complex dialogue, and praised the sharpness of the full-motion video graphics. Reviewing the PlayStation version in Maximum, David Hodgson complimented the uniqueness of the \\"more 'adult' storyline\\", but contended that full motion video-based games are not worth playing regardless of gameplay or content. He scored it 2 out of 5 stars. GamePro, while warning that the game is strictly for older players, praised it for having a good murder mystery, \\"Clean full- motion video (although mostly in a small-screen format), great sound, and more fun than Snowjob.Snow Job (consistently misspelled in GamePro as a single word) was a contemporaneous release for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer which also uses extensive live action full motion video with a mystery storyline.\\" NotesReferencesExternal links * Psychic Detective at MobyGames * * Complete game manual, PDF format Category:1995 video games Category:3DO Interactive Multiplayer games Category:Detective video games Category:DOS games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Full motion video based games Category:Interactive movie video games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in San Francisco ","title":"Psychic Detective (video game)"},{"id":"2294424","text":"The Main Event may refer to: Film and television * The Main Event (1927 film), directed by William K.

History The oldest private channel in Europe, TMC dates back to 1954, inaugurated by Rainier III, Prince of Monaco. Like several other European television channels, its first major broadcast was one relating to the country's reigning dynasty, in this case the marriage of Prince Rainier III and Grace Kelly. As a result of an agreement between Prince Rainier III and the French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand, TMC was able to be broadcast as far west as Montpellier, France, tripling its coverage (three million potential viewers). In 1987 the channel was carried for a few hours on M6, a French television service ‚Äî which made it available to much more of France ‚Äî and the channel was eventually carried by CanalSat and became available in all of France and the Indian Ocean area. The channel also won a spot on the French language digital terrestrial television scheme, demonstrating its wide appeal. The channel was owned jointly by the TF1 Group (40%), the AB Group (40%) and the Government of Monaco (20%).

He is said, but doubtfully, to have been the illegitimate son of one Juana Perez. He took orders, obtained a canonry at Guadix, and settled at Madrid early in the 17th century. He is mentioned as a prominent dramatist in Rojas Villandrandos Loa (1603), which was written several years before it was published. In 1610, being then arch-dean of Guadix, he accompanied the count de Lemos to Naples, and on his return to Spain was appointed (1619) chaplain to the Cardinale-Infante Ferdinand of Austria; he is referred to as still alive in Montalb√°n's Para todos (1632), and he collaborated with Montalb√°n and Calder√≥n in Polifemo y Circe, printed in 1634. The date of his death is not known. Mira de Amescua's plays are dispersed in various printed collections, and the absence of a satisfactory edition has prevented, his due recognition. He has an evenness of execution which indicates an artistic conscience uncommon in Spanish playwrights; he resisted the temptation to write too much, and he unites a virile dignity of expression to impressive conception of character. Two of his playsLa adversa fortuna de Don Bernardo de Cabrera and El ejemplo mayor de la desdichaare respectively the sources of Rotrou's Don Bernardo de la Cabr√®re and Belisaire; Moreto's Caer para levantar is simply a recast of Mira's El Esclavo del demonio, a celebrated drama which clearly influenced Calder√≥n when composing La Devoci√≥n de la cruz; and there is manifestly a close relation between Mira's La Rueda de la fortuna on the one hand and Corneille's H√©raclius and Calder√≥n's En esta vida todo es verdad y todo es mentira.

It is one of the mental condition defences that relate to the mental state of the defendant. Automatism can be seen variously as lack of voluntariness, lack of culpability (unconsciousness) or excuse (Schopp). Automatism means that the defendant was not aware of his or her actions when making the particular movements that constituted the illegal act. For example, Esther Griggs in 1858 threw her child out of a first floor window believing that the house was on fire, while having a sleep terror. In 2002, Peter Buck, lead guitarist of the band R.E.M., was cleared of several charges, including assault, which resulted from automatism brought on by a bad interaction between alcohol and sleeping pills. In a 2009 case in Aberporth in west Wales, Brian Thomas strangled his wife in their camper van, also during a sleep terror, when he mistook his wife for an intruder. The defence of automatism is denying that the person was acting in the sense that the criminal law demands. As such it is really a denial-of- proof ‚Äì the defendant is asserting that the offence is not made out. The prosecution does not have to disprove the defence as is sometimes erroneously reported; the prosecution has to prove all the elements of the offence including the voluntary act requirement. Automatism is a defence even against strict liability crimes like dangerous driving, where no intent is necessary. There are several limitations to the defence of automatism in English law. Prior fault generally excludes automatism. Intoxication generally excludes automatism, even when involuntary. Any defence that rests on insanity comes under the M'Naghten rules. Under English law internal causes of automatism are generally judged to be insane automatism and so result in the special verdict ('not guilty by reason of insanity') rather than simple acquittal. Scope Automatism is arguably the only defence that excludes responsibility by negating the existence of the actus reus which uniquely allows it to be a defence to both conventional and strict liability offences (although this argument could be extended to the status defence of insanity too). Strict automatism is a denial of actus reus and therefore most commonly used as a defence against strict liability offences. There are a number of reasons why a person may go into a state of automatism, including dissociation or hypo/hyperglycemia.. Unconsciousness is the defence of denial of mens rea, which is easier to prove and hence more commonly used for non-strict liability crimes. For example, in cases of homicidal sleepwalking the illegal act is typically not denied but the intent to kill is. The defendant will typically be perplexed and confused and will not cover up the episode. Kenneth Parks, after killing his mother-in-law and severely injuring his father-in-law, drove to the police station stating that he thought he'd killed some people. The person's movements seem purposeful - the sleepwalker interacts with his environment in a limited way. Nonetheless the sleepwalker is not conscious of his actions. The use of the term automatism for these situations causes some confusion, as in these cases it is really the lack of intent on the part of the defendant which denies the mens rea of the offence rather than the actus reus (although this distinction is problematic in many instances), better called unconsciousness. Intention is a problem in crimes of strict liability. Very few people intend to crash their vehicles, so clearly something better than intent is required to define automatism. Another issue with automatism is that when the issue is raised by the defence as a realistic defence (an evidentiary basis), the prosecution then has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was acting voluntarily. This is the case for several other defences e.g. duress. The justification for this is that voluntary action is part of the definition of the offence, and therefore something under the presumption of innocence the prosecution has to prove. The evidentiary burden was laid down in Hill v Baxter where the defence of automatism failed because there was no good evidence for the alleged blackout.Hill v Baxter [1958] 1 QB 277. Evidentiary burden means that the defendant needs to provide evidence to satisfy the judge that the issue should be put to the jury, which normally requires medical evidence (although R v Woolley,R v Woolley [1998] CLY 914 in which an HGV driver crashed after sneezing, proved an exception). Exclusions Because automatism is such a comprehensive defence, there are various exclusions to an automatism defence. The person must not be at fault. The classic example of this is falling asleep at the wheel of a car (Kay v Butterworth). Although one is not responsible for acts done while asleep, one can be held responsible for driving in a state where one would fall asleep at the wheel. The issue of prior fault applies to many diabetics who suffer hypoglycaemia while driving. Voluntary (and often involuntary) intoxication cannot cause legal automatism. In many jurisdictions, there is a distinction made between 'sane automatism' and 'insane automatism'. Where the involuntariness is caused by a mental illness, or 'disease of the mind', as per the M'Naghten Rules, it will be regarded as 'insane automatism' and will often result in a special verdict of 'not guilty by reason of insanity'. This can have significant practical effects for the defendant, as they still may be detained after a special verdict as opposed to the straight acquittal available through sane automatism.. The M'Naghten Rules require a \\"disease of mind\\", which requires an internal cause. This is medically nonsensical, and does not always bear much relationship to continuing risk which is the main justification. This means that insane automatisms do not require total loss of voluntary control (see below). Thus they are easier to prove in some circumstances, but conversely the burden of proof is on the defendant. Sleepwalking was initially an exception to the internal/external doctrine until the case of R v Burgess.R v Burgess [1991] 2 QB 92; [1991] 2 WLR 1206 The most contentious qualifier is that there must be a total loss of control. In Attorney-General's Reference No 2 of 1992,Attorney-General's Reference No 2 of 1992 [1993] 3 WLR 982. this definition of legal automatism was confirmed. A lorry driver had crashed, and his defence (backed up by expert evidence) was that the monotony of motorway driving had caused him to go into a state of 'driving without awareness' where although he could make minor adjustments to follow the road he was not truly conscious of driving. This followed the decisions of Watmore v JenkinsWatmore v Jenkins [1962] 2 QB 572 and Broome v PerkinsBroome v Perkins [1987] RTR 321. where diabetic drivers who had driven 3 miles or more were held to not have the total loss of control necessary for the defence of automatism. This definition is problematic, and the Law Commission, Butler Committee and leading legal academic R. D. Mackay have all argued that this definition is too restrictive. Classically automatisms in the legal sense have been defined as spasms, reflexes, convulsions or acts committed in a state of unconsciousness e.g. sleep. However, there have been cases where the automatism defence was successful when none of these apply. In R v TR v T [1990] Crim LR 256. the defendant had been raped a few days prior to committing a robbery. She was clearly conscious of what she was doing, but in a dissociative state due to post-traumatic stress disorder from being raped. However, in R v Isitt,R v Isitt (1978) 67 Cr App R 44. when the defendant drove away from a collision and evaded a police roadblock in a dissociative state, the defence was not successful. The Ontario Court of Appeal expressed a logical way of distinguishing such cases in Rabey v The Queen.Rabey v The Queen (1981) 79 Dominion Law Reports 435 (Ontario Court of Appeal). There the defendant went into a dissociative state due to being spurned. It was held that such a commonplace occurrence was not the sort of external stimulus that would cause legal automatism (although the insanity plea would be open to him). Omissions The problem with omissions and automatism is that the strict legal definition requires total loss of control. A person may well not be able to avoid a crash even though he has some residual control. In this case, the law is imposing liability for failing to do the impossible. Several commentators, including H. L. A. Hart, have suggested that responsibility for omissions must be framed with reference to the actor's capabilities at the time, rather than the objective test. Voluntariness La Forest J. in the Canadian Supreme Court case of R v Parks,R v Parks (1992) 75 CCC (3d) 287 at 302. asserted that automatism is \\"conceptually a subset of the voluntariness requirement\\". One of the main rationales of criminal law is to use the threat of punishment as a deterrent to future wrongdoing. But, if an individual is to be deterred, he or she must be acting under voluntary control. If something is interfering with this control, automatism may be available as an excuse. Duress is not an example of involuntary action as although the choices faced by the person under duress may be difficult, nonetheless they are still acting voluntarily. Some would describe action under duress as non-voluntary as opposed to involuntary. This distinction is emphasized by the exclusion of the defense of duress for murder. In the words of the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Milloy,R v Milloy (1991) 54 A Crim R 340 at 342‚Äì343. Thomas J says, that for automatism to succeed: Reflex movements One of the difficulties is defining what a voluntary action is and is not. Words like \\"willed\\" have the same difficulty: a voluntary action is one that is willed, whatever that means. In Australia, Ryan v The Queen,. the defendant entered a shop with a loaded rifle for a robbery. In a sudden attack, the shop assistant caught the appellant by surprise, causing him by a reflex action to discharge the gun, killing the assistant instantly. The Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) requires that \\"murder shall be committed where the act of the accused ... causing the death charged\\".. Barwick CJ said: \\"That a crime cannot be committed except by an act or omission is axiomatic. It is basic, in my opinion, that the 'act' of an accused ... must be a 'willed', a voluntary act which has caused the death charged. It is the act which must be willed, though its consequences may not be intended.\\" Concerning whether the firing of the gun was willed so as to constitute an 'act' for the purposes of the murder charge, Elliot comments that \\"his reaction was like the sudden movement of a tennis player retrieving a difficult shot; not accompanied by conscious planning, but certainly not involuntary\\". (1968) 41 Australian Law Journal 497. Despite accepting that the actual discharge was involuntary, Barwick CJ confirmed the murder conviction because \\"the act causing death\\" included the general circumstances in which the gun was fired. The judge and jury In the U.S., in People v. Decina (1956) 2 NY2d 13 3, 143 the defendant had epilepsy. While driving his car, he had an epileptic seizure and the car went out of control, killing four people. Decina was convicted of negligent homicide because he had voluntarily driven an automobile without assistance knowing that a seizure was possible, breaching Penal Law 1053 on the negligent operation of a motor vehicle: This reasoning matches that in English law where any foreseeable loss of control is excluded from automatism. To hold otherwise would be to excuse any driver or other person engaged in an activity where public safety is an issue, from the consequences of a loss of control that occurred after losing consciousness. Only sudden and unexpected health problems avoid culpability. In Scots law, Cardle v Mulrainey (1992) SCCR 658 applies the general requirement for cases involving a defence based on insanity or a comparable state, that there must be a total alienation of reason leading to a loss of self-control, to a case in which the accused claimed that he had involuntarily consumed a drug which had the effect that he knew what he was doing but was unable to refrain from acting (at 668): Sleep Australian Model Criminal Code Committee state the law as follows (at 14‚Äì15): In the U.S., People v Huey Newton (1970) 8 CA3d 359 holds that unconsciousness, when not self-induced (say, as by voluntary intoxication), is a complete defence to a criminal act even though the defendant's acts seem very goal-oriented. The medical evidence was that \\"[a] gunshot wound which penetrates in a body cavity, the abdominal cavity or the thoracic cavity is very likely to produce a profound reflex shock reaction, that is quite different from a gunshot wound which penetrates only skin and muscle and it is not at all uncommon for a person shot in the abdomen to lose consciousness and go into this reflex shock condition for short periods of time up to half an hour or so.\\" But the reflexive activity or unconsciousness need not cause physical collapse: it can exist where the subject physically acts in fact, but is not at the time conscious of acting (cf some European continental jurisdictions classify conduct resulting from automatism under the rubric of unconsciousness). In R. v. Cogdon (1950), unreported but noted in Morris, Somnambulistic Homicide: Ghosts, Spiders and North Koreans (1951) 5 Res Judicatae 29, the defendant struck her daughter on the head with an axe while sleepwalking and dreaming about North Koreans. Her movements were not voluntary, so she was acquitted. This interpretation of automatism is consistent with Lord Denning's dicta in Bratty v Attorney-General for Northern Ireland (1963) AC 386, at 409: Situations involving hypnotism, concussion, and sleepwalking may involve apparently deliberate and purposeful conduct. In fact this is the case for many situation where the defense of automatism is presented ‚Äì spasms or reflex actions are rarely likely to be perceived as criminally liable acts. As for sleepwalking itself, the Canadian case of R v Parks exemplifies a certain judicial willingness to regard a sleepwalker as behaving as an automaton even though he had performed apparently goal-directed acts. The accused fell asleep in his living room. A few hours later he got up and drove 23 kilometres to his in-laws' home. Still asleep, he entered the house, found a knife in the kitchen and went to the bedroom where his in-laws were sleeping. He strangled and cut his father in-law, who survived the attack. The mother in-law died from the repeated stab wounds and the brutal beating. The medical experts at trial unanimously agreed that the accused was sleepwalking and that sleepwalking was not a 'disease of mind'. The Supreme Court agreed and held that sleepwalking can negate the voluntary ingredient of the actus reus. There is widespread disagreement among forensic sleep experts that Kenneth Parks was in fact sleepwalking ‚Äì it is not entirely clear the reason why the prosecution did not call its own experts on sleepwalking, one explanation being frank disbelief that the defence could succeed. The point made in these cases is that the key component of the two categories of cases identified by Lord Denning in Bratty is a defendant's inability to control their behaviour and not the way in which loss or impairment of the conscious or deliberative functions of the mind arises. Similarly, under the Swedish Penal Code, acts during sleep and unconsciousness, reflex movements, spasms and convulsions, as well as acts performed under physical force or hypnosis are generally not punishable. Moreover, omissions caused by sleep, weakness, physical numbness or anaesthesia are generally not blameworthy. The issue is whether the accused had the ability to control the behaviour, including taking early precautions to avoid loss of control. But, in English law, the ruling in R v Sullivan (1984) AC 156 held that, for the purposes of the M'Naghten Rules, a disease of the mind need have no permanence, leading many academics to suggest that sleepwalkers might well be found to be suffering from a disease of the mind with internal causes unless there was clear evidence of an external causal factor. In R v Burgess the Court of Appeal ruled that the defendant who wounded a woman by hitting her with a video recorder while sleepwalking, was insane under the M'Naghten Rules. Lord Lane said, \\"We accept that sleep is a normal condition, but the evidence in the instant case indicates that sleepwalking, and particularly violence in sleep, is not normal.\\" Overall, this emphasis on control rather than consciousness is supported by clinical science.Hughlings Jackson, Automatism as Disinhibition (1998) 6 Journal of Law and Medicine 73. Michael Coles says: {{quote... on the basis of the available knowledge of human behaviour, it may be suggested that many of the crimes the courts have decided were committed in an automatistic state ‚Äì that is, in the absence of conscious, volitional control, or while the mind was a total blank ‚Äì actually may have occurred in a state of diminished consciousness, with the diminished consciousness resulting in the diminished conscious control of behaviour. In other words, the individual becomes disinhibited, and behaviour that the individual would otherwise be able to [contain] gains expression.Coles, Michael. \\"Scientific Support for the Legal Concept of Automatism\\", (2000) 7 Psychiatry, Psychology and Law, 33 at 37. Insanity A discussion of the relationship between automatism and insanity and \\"internal\\" and \\"external\\" factors is in M'Naghten Rules. The internal/external divide is a doctrine of English law, but not followed in Canada for example - hence Parks' acquittal. Drunkenness Voluntary intoxication is not automatism. Involuntary intoxication can constitute automatism. This was the decision in R. v Hardie [1985] 1 WLR 164, although this decision may have been the result of judicial misunderstanding of the effects of diazepam. However, in Kingston [1994] 3 WLR 519, a man with normally controlled paedophiliac urges succumbed to them after being drugged unknowingly for blackmail purposes; he was found still able to form the mens rea for indecent assault. This decision has been much criticised by jurists. Provocation To constitute a provocation, there must be a sudden and unexpected loss of control as a result of things said or done but the accused is still capable of activity which is sufficiently directed to cause the death of another. Hence, there is insufficient loss of control to constitute automatism e.g. as in the Canadian case of Bert Thomas Stone v R (1999) . Provocation is only a partial defence, a concession to human frailty, and not a complete defence like automatism. See also * Sleep sex * Highway hypnosis ReferencesSources *Beran, Roy.

She was named for John Young. History Young was laid down on 28 January 1919 at San Francisco, California, by the Union Iron Works Plant of the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation; launched on 8 May 1919; sponsored by Mrs. John R. Nolan; designated DD-312 on 17 July 1920; and commissioned on 29 November 1920, Lieutenant H. J. Ray in command. Young fitted out at the Mare Island Navy Yard into December. Assigned to Division 34, Squadron 2, Pacific Fleet Destroyer Force, the destroyer remained inactive in the San Diego, California area through the end of 1921. Young departed San Diego on 14 January 1922, bound for Bremerton, Washington, and, proceeding via San Francisco, California, reached the Puget Sound Navy Yard on the 18th. Overhauled at Puget Sound, the destroyer departed the yard on 3 April and arrived at her home port, San Diego, on the 8th. The remainder of the year passed fairly uneventfully, with the destroyer continuing her largely anchored existence in San Diego harbor. However, she did fire short-range battle practices, operated briefly off the Mexican Coronados Islands, and recovered torpedoes for during the autumn of the year 1922. The in-port routine changed the following year, when Young departed San Diego on 6 February 1923 and headed for Panama. En route, she stopped briefly at Magdalena Bay, the traditional target practice grounds for the Pacific Fleet, and fueled from before proceeding on south to the Pacific side of the Panama Canal Zone. Young participated in Fleet Problem I over the ensuing weeks. In this, the first Fleet Problem held by the United States Navy, the Battle Fleet was pitted against the Scouting Fleet augmented by a division of battleships. During the war games, Young performed antisubmarine screening for the dreadnoughts of the Battle Fleet and, when the scenario of exercises called for it, dashed in and made simulated torpedo attacks on the \\"enemy\\" battlewagons of the augmented Scouting Fleet. Upon completion of one phase of the exercises, she was present in Panama Bay when Secretary of the Navy Edwin C. Denby, accompanied by a party of congressmen embarked in the transport , reviewed the Fleet on 14 March. Young later departed Panamanian waters on 31 March and arrived back at San Diego on 11 April. She remained there until 25 June, when she headed north. She called at San Francisco from the 27th to the 29th and arrived at Tacoma, Washington, on 2 July. Two days later, in keeping with the occasion, Young sent her landing force ashore to march in Tacoma's Independence Day parade. After shifting to Seattle, Young underwent a period of upkeep alongside between 16 July and 17 August. During that time;, on 23 July, President Warren G. Harding, on a cruise to Alaska in Henderson, reviewed the Fleet - one of his last official acts before his death a short time later. After spending a few days at Lake Washington following her upkeep period alongside Melville, Young underwent a brief yard period at the Puget Sound Navy Yard before she sailed south, escorting Battle Division 4 to San Francisco Bay at the end of August. En route, Young practiced torpedo attacks through smoke screens as part of the slate of tactical exercises. Following a brief period moored at Pier 15, San Francisco, Division 11 got underway to return to San Diego on the morning of 8 September. As the ships made passage down the California coast, they conducted tactical and gunnery exercises in the course of what was also a competitive speed run of . Ultimately, when the weather worsened, the ships formed column on the squadron leader, . Unfortunately, through an error in navigation, the column swung east at about 2100, unaware of the danger that lurked in the fog dead ahead of them. At 2105, Delphy - still steaming at - ran hard aground off Padernales Point, followed, in succession, by 6 other ships steaming in follow-the-leader fashion. Only quick action by the ships farthest astern prevented the total loss of the entire group. Young, however, became one of the casualties. Her hull was torn by a jagged pinnacle, but she also ran into the still revolving propellers of the which did further damage to her hull. 184 (See Delphy). She swiftly capsized, heeling over on her starboard side within a minute and a half, trapping many of her engine and fire room personnel below. Lt. Cmdr. William L. Calhoun, Young's commanding officer, knew that there was no time to launch boats or rafts as the ship's list increased alarmingly following the grounding. Calhoun accordingly passed the word, through his executive officer, Lt. E. C. Herzinger, and Chief Boatswain's Mate Arthur Peterson, to make for the port side, to stick with the ship, and to not jump. While the survivors clung to their precarious, oily, surf-battered refuge, Boatswain's Mate Peterson proposed to swim 100 yards to a rocky outcropping to the eastward known as Bridge Rock. Before he could do so, however, providentially grounded between Young and Bridge Rock, shortening the escape route considerably. The two ships were about 75 yards apart. At that juncture, Peterson dived into the sea and swam through the tumbling surf with a line to the nearby Chauncey, which was also aground but in a far better predicament since she had remained on a comparatively even keel. The crew of Chauncey hauled Peterson aboard and made the line fast. Soon, a seven-man life raft from the Chauncey was on its way to Young as a makeshift ferry. The raft ultimately made 11 trips bringing the 70 Young survivors to safety. By 2330, the last men of the crew were on board Chauncey; at that point, Lt. Cmdr. Calhoun and Lt. Herzinger (the latter having returned to the ship after having been in the first raft across) left 'Young's' battered hull. The capsized USS Young (center) at Honda Point. In the subsequent investigation of the Honda Point Disaster the Board of Investigation commended Lt. Cmdr. Calhoun for his \\"coolness, intelligence, and seamanlike ability\\" that was directly responsible for the \\"greatly reduced loss of life.\\" The Board also cited Boatswain's Mate Peterson for his \\"extraordinary heroism\\" in swimming through the turbulent seas with a line to Chauncey; Lt. Herzinger drew praise for his \\"especially meritorious conduct\\" in helping to save the majority of the ship's crew. Rear Admiral S. E. W. Kittelle, Commander, Destroyer Squadrons, subsequently cited Lt. Cmdr. Calhoun's display of leadership and personality that saved \\"three-quarters of the crew of the Young\\" and Lt. Herzinger for his \\"coolness and great assistance in the face of grave danger.\\" Also commended by the admiral was Fireman First Class J. T. Scott, who attempted to close off the master oil valve to prevent a boiler explosion, volunteering to go below to the fireroom and go below the floor plates. The water, rapidly rising through the gashes in the ship's hull, however, prevented Scott from completing the task. He survived. Twenty men were lost in Young, the highest death toll of any of the ships lost in the disaster at Point Honda.

Subject matter is predominantly non- fiction and pictorial (a photo-book). Pages consist mainly of photographs and illustrations, accompanied by captions and small blocks of text, as opposed to long prose. Since they are aimed at anyone who might pick up the book for a light read, the analysis inside is often more basic and with less jargon than other books on the subject. Because of this, the term \\"coffee table book\\" can be used pejoratively to indicate a superficial approach to the subject. In the field of mathematics, a coffee table book is usually a notebook containing a number of mathematical problems and theorems contributed by a community meeting in a particular place, or connected by a common scientific interest. An example of this was the Scottish Book created by mathematicians at Lviv University in the 1930s and 1940s. History The concept of a book intended essentially for display over perusal was mentioned by Michel de Montaigne in his 1581 essay \\"Upon Some Verses of Virgil\\": \\"I am vexed that my Essays only serve the ladies for a common movable, a book to lay in the parlor window...\\" Almost two centuries later, Laurence Sterne in his 1759 comic novel The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman advanced the more lighthearted view that \\"As my life and opinions are likely to make some noise in the world, and... be no less read than the Pilgrim's Progress itself- and, in the end, prove the very thing Montaigne dreaded his Essays should turn out, that is, a book for a parlour window...\\" Beginning in the late 1940s, publisher Albert Skira and a few others, such as Cailler and Editions Tisn√©, √âditions Mazenod, and Harry N. Abrams, began producing large folio and quarto (4to) format art books, illustrated with tipped-in color plates, often for international markets that were significant in the development of coffee table books as known today.Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith (2015) A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art (3 ed.).

While serving as executive director of the Sierra Club, he had the idea for a series of books that combined nature photography and writings on nature, with, as he put it, \\"a page size big enough to carry a given image‚Äôs dynamic. The eye must be required to move about within the boundaries of the image, not encompass it all in one glance.\\" The first such book, \\"This is the American Earth\\", with photographs by Ansel Adams and others and text by Nancy Newhall, was published in 1960; the series became known as the \\"Exhibit Format\\" series, with 20 titles eventually published. The term \\"coffee table book\\" appeared in Arts Magazine in 1961, and in 1962 \\"The Coffee Table Book of Astrology\\" was published. They have also found uses in propaganda, such as a book on the life of East German leader Walter Ulbricht and another on Albanian leader Enver Hoxha.Enver Hoxha: 1908-1985.

Born in East Providence, Rhode Island, Abell learned the newspaper business as an apprentice at the Providence Patriot. After stints with newspapers in Boston and New York City, he co-founded the Public Ledger in Philadelphia and later independently founded The Sun of Baltimore, Maryland; both were penny papers to appeal to the working class. Abell and his descendants continued ownership of The Sun as a family business until 1910. Abell is noted as an innovative publisher in the newspaper business, making use of new systems and technology: pony express delivery of news from New Orleans, using the telegraph to transmit news from the first Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and a President's speech to the Congress in Washington, D.C., and using the new rotary/cylinder printing press invented by Richard March Hoe. Biography Abell was born in East Providence, Rhode Island on August 10, 1806 to parents of generations of English ancestry; his father's family were originally from Stapenhill, Derbyshire (now part of Staffordshire).Abell formerly of Stapenhill and Hemington pedigree, Burke's Distinguished Families of the U.S.A. After leaving school at the age of 14, he worked as a clerk in a retail business specializing in West Indian wares, before he became an apprentice at the Providence Patriot newspaper in 1822. He served as a journeyman printer in Boston and New York City.Van Doren, Charles and Robert McKendry, ed., Webster's American Biographies. (Springfield, Massachusetts: Merriam-Webster, 1984) p. 5 In New York, he met two other young newspapermen, Azariah H. Simmons and William Moseley Swain, and they became friends. Together, they decided to go into business and found a \\"penny paper\\". At the time, the majority of newspapers were associated with a political party or with business interests. For example, Abell's newspaper in Baltimore was strongly associated with the Democratic Party; Abell was offered a political appointment as a result of his work on it. Penny papers were a relatively new phenomenon at the time. Originating in England, they made newspapers accessible to the working class, whereas other existing papers were too expensive for many consumers. As New York already had a number of penny papers, Abell, Simmons, and Swain founded their paper in Philadelphia where there was less competition, starting the Public Ledger in 1836. Within 2 years, the Public Ledger absorbed its nearest rival, the Philadelphia Transcript. Under Abell, the Ledger continued to appeal to the working class as a penny paper; he concentrated on sensationalist stories and scandals. The following year, Abell convinced his partners to back him financially to found a penny paper in Baltimore, which at the time had a number of more expensive papers costing six pennies an issue. They agreed, based on his commitment to personally oversee the new venture. Abell published his first four-page tabloid-sized issue of The Sun on May 17, 1837. While it was an independent newspaper, The Sun editorially leaned toward the ideals of Jacksonian democracy as championed by sixth President Andrew Jackson. Soon each issue used the phrase \\"Light for All\\" as its motto, with a distinctive \\"vignette\\" (illustrated logo) on its masthead, which is still in use. The newspaper quickly became a success; within a year it had double the circulation (12,000) of its closest competitor. In 1838, Abell married Mary Fox Campbell, a widow. They had children together. By 1850, business was good enough that Abell commissioned architect James Bogardus to design a new building for the paper; it was to feature a cast iron facade. Throughout the 19th century, Baltimore had a number of newspapers. Many were overtly partisan, such as the pro- Republican, Baltimore American (it was derived from the city's first weekly/daily newspaper in 1773, reorganized in 1799). Despite its origins as a penny paper, by the late 19th century the Sun had won a position as the newspaper of choice of Baltimore's upper class. By 1864, Abell was sole proprietor of The Sun and had sold his share in the Public Ledger to partner Swain. Abell was a pioneer in making use of technology and a variety of transportation systems to transmit and deliver news. To get news from his reporters as quickly as possible, he used pony express, stagecoaches, trains, ships, and even carrier pigeons. He established a new pony express route from New Orleans, in conjunction with the publishers of the New Orleans Daily Picayune, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. With this system, he learned of the U.S. victory at Veracruz, Mexico before officials in the nation's capital, Washington, D.C.; he sent word to the president. He was the first newspaperman to use telegraphy when he transmitted President John Tyler's message of May 11, 1846, and he was the first to buy a Hoe cylinder press. The carrier pigeons were part of a network that Abell established with another newspaper publisher in New York; they carried messages between that city, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C., and from incoming ships. They were superseded by the spread of telegraphy. Abell's newsroom received foreign news by a convoluted route. News from Europe was delivered to Halifax, Nova Scotia by ship; from there it was transported overland by pony express to Annapolis Royal, N.S., by steamship to Portland, Maine, and then by rail to Baltimore. Through a journey of nearly one thousand miles, the news was delivered in little more than two days from Halifax to Baltimore. In later years, Abell supported telegraph pioneer Samuel F.B. Morse and helped finance the construction of telegraph lines into Baltimore. By the start of the American Civil War, Abell had increased circulation of The Sun to 30,000 subscribers. He remained owner of The Sun until his death. Abell is entombed in Baltimore's Green Mount Cemetery off Greenmount Avenue (Maryland Route 45) and East North Avenue. His three sons and their grandsons retained control of the newspaper until 1910. As a result of a financial restructuring of the former Abell- Swain-Simmons partnership into a reorganized A.S. Abell Company, the newspaper was sold from family control. Also sold was the participating Safe Deposit bank and trust company which they had owned for those three decades.

As its founder, Abell has been criticized posthumously by opponents of positions held by the newspaper's editorial board. For instance, state senator Henry Herbert Balch denounced Abell during a filibuster of legislation to authorize construction of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in 1949. * The Abell Building, designed by Baltimore City Hall architect George A. Frederick, was named in his honor; as of 2009 it houses apartments. * During World War II, one of the famed \\"Liberty\\" cargo ships was named the S.S. Arunah S. Abell in his honor; it was built in South Baltimore's Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard near the Brooklyn-Curtis Bay neighborhoods. * The Abell Foundation was established in the 1950s by Harry C. Black and his older brother Van Lear Black, (1875‚Äì1930) in the publisher's honor; it has assisted programs throughout the Baltimore and Maryland areas.

It is based on polynomials over finite fields \\\\mathbb{F}_q of different size to disguise the relationship between the private key and public key. HFE is in fact a family which consists of basic HFE and combinatorial versions of HFE. The HFE family of cryptosystems is based on the hardness of the problem of finding solutions to a system of multivariate quadratic equations (the so- called MQ problem) since it uses private affine transformations to hide the extension field and the private polynomials. Hidden Field Equations also have been used to construct digital signature schemes, e.g. Quartz and Sflash.Christopher Wolf and Bart Preneel, Asymmetric Cryptography: Hidden Field Equations  Mathematical background  One of the central notions to understand how Hidden Field Equations work is to see that for two extension fields \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^n} \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^m} over the same base field \\\\mathbb{F}_q one can interpret a system of m multivariate polynomials in n variables over \\\\mathbb{F}_q as a function \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^n} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^m} by using a suitable basis of \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^n} over \\\\mathbb{F}_q. In almost all applications the polynomials are quadratic, i.e. they have degree 2.Nicolas T. Courtois On Multivariate Signature-only public key cryptosystems We start with the simplest kind of polynomials, namely monomials, and show how they lead to quadratic systems of equations. Consider a finite field \\\\mathbb{F}_q, where q is a power of 2, and an extension field K. Let 0 such that h=q^{\\\\theta}+1 for some \\\\theta and gcd (h,q^n-1)=1 . The condition gcd (h,q^n-1) =1 is equivalent to requiring that the map u \\\\to u^h on K is one to one and its inverse is the map u \\\\to u^{h'} where h' is the multiplicative inverse of h \\\\ \\\\bmod q^n-1 . Take a random element u\\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}. Define w\\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^n} by : w= u ^h = u^{q^\\\\theta} u \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ (1) Let \\\\beta_1,...,\\\\beta_n to be a basis of K as an \\\\mathbb{F}_q vector space. We represent u with respect to the basis as u=(u_1,...,u_n) and w=(w_1,...,w_n). Let A^{(k)}={a_{ij}^{(k)}} be the matrix of the linear transformation u \\\\to u^{q^k} with respect to the basis \\\\beta_1,...,\\\\beta_n, i.e. such that : \\\\beta_{i}^{q^k}=\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij}^{k}\\\\beta_{j},\\\\ \\\\ a_{ij}^{k}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{F}_q for 1\\\\le i,k\\\\le n . Additionally, write all products of basis elements in terms of the basis, i.e.: : \\\\beta_i\\\\beta_j=\\\\sum_{l=1}^{n}m_{ijl}\\\\beta_{l},\\\\ \\\\ m_{ijl}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{F}_q for each 1\\\\le i,j\\\\le n . The system of n equations which is explicit in the w_i and quadratic in the u_j can be obtained by expanding (1) and equating to zero the coefficients of the \\\\beta_i . Choose two secret affine transformations S and T , i.e. two invertible n\\\\times n matrices M_S=\\\\\\\\{S_{ij}\\\\\\\\} and M_T=\\\\\\\\{T_{ij}\\\\\\\\} with entries in \\\\mathbb{F}_q and two vectors v_S and v_T of length n over \\\\mathbb{F}_q and define x and y via: : u=Sx = M_Sx+v_S \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ w= Ty = M_Ty+v_T \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ (2) By using the affine relations in (2) to replace the u_j, w_i with x_k,y_l , the system of n equations is linear in the y_l and of degree 2 in the x_k . Applying linear algebra it will give n explicit equations, one for each y_l as polynomials of degree 2 in the x_k .Ilia Toli Hidden Polynomial Cryptosystems  Multivariate cryptosystem  The basic idea of the HFE family of using this as a multivariate cryptosystem is to build the secret key starting from a polynomial P in one unknown x over some finite field \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^n} (normally value q=2 is used). This polynomial can be easily inverted over \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^n} , i.e. it is feasible to find any solutions to the equation P(x)=y when such solution exist. The secret transformation either decryption and/or signature is based on this inversion. As explained above P can be identified with a system of n equations (p_1,...,p_n) using a fixed basis. To build a cryptosystem the polynomial (p_1,...,p_n) must be transformed so that the public information hides the original structure and prevents inversion. This is done by viewing the finite fields \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^n} as a vector space over \\\\mathbb{F}_q and by choosing two linear affine transformations S and T . The triplet (S,P,T) constitute the private key. The private polynomial P is defined over \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^n} .Jean-Charles Faug√®re and Antoine Joux, Algebraic Cryptanalysis of Hidden Field Equations (HFE) Cryptosystems Using Gr√∂bner Bases The public key is (p_1,...,p_n) . Below is the diagram for MQ-trapdoor (S,P,T) in HFE :\\\\text{input} x\\\\to x=(x_1,...,x_n)\\\\overset{\\\\text{secret}: S}{\\\\to}x'\\\\overset{\\\\text{secret}: P}{\\\\to}y'\\\\overset{\\\\text{secret}: T}{\\\\to}\\\\text{output} y  HFE polynomial  The private polynomial P with degree d over \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^n} is an element of \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}[x] . If the terms of polynomial P have at most quadratic terms over \\\\mathbb{F}_{q} then it will keep the public polynomial small. The case that P consists of monomials of the form x^{q^{s_i}+q^{t_i}}, i.e. with 2 powers of q in the exponent is the basic version of HFE, i.e. P is chosen as : P(x)=\\\\sum c_i x^{q^{s_i}+q^{t_i}} The degree d of the polynomial is also known as security parameter and the bigger its value the better for security since the resulting set of quadratic equations resembles a randomly chosen set of quadratic equations. On the other side large d slows down the deciphering. Since P is a polynomial of degree at most d the inverse of P , denoted by P^{-1} can be computed in d^2(\\\\ln d)^{O(1)} n^2 \\\\mathbb{F}_q operations.Nicolas T. Courtois, \\"The Security of Hidden Field Equations\\"  Encryption and decryption  The public key is given by the n multivariate polynomials (p_1,...,p_n) over \\\\mathbb{F}_q. It is thus necessary to transfer the message M from \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^n} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n in order to encrypt it, i.e. we assume that M is a vector (x_1,...,x_n)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n . To encrypt message M we evaluate each p_i at (x_1,...,x_n). The ciphertext is (p_1(x_1,...,x_n), p_2(x_1,...,x_n), ... ,p_n(x_1,...,x_n))\\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n. To understand decryption let us express encryption in terms of S, T, P . Note that these are not available to the sender. By evaluating the p_i at the message we first apply S , resulting in x' . At this point x' is transferred from \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^n} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^n} so we can apply the private polynomial P which is over \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^n} and this result is denoted by y'\\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^n} . Once again, y' is transferred to the vector (y_1',...,y_n') and the transformation T is applied and the final output y\\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^n} is produced from (y_1,...,y_n)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n . To decrypt y , the above steps are done in reverse order. This is possible if the private key (S,P,T) is known. The crucial step in the deciphering is not the inversion of S and T but rather the computations of the solution of P(x')=y' . Since P is not necessary a bijection, one may find more than one solution to this inversion (there exist at most d different solutions X'=(x_1',...,x_d')\\\\in\\\\mathbb{F}_{q^n} since P is a polynomial of degree d). The redundancy denoted as r is added at the first step to the message M in order to select the right M from the set of solutions X'.Jacques Patarin, Hidden Field Equations (HFE) and Isomorphic Polynomial (IP): two new families of asymmetric algorithm The diagram below shows the basic HFE for encryption. :M\\\\overset{+r}{\\\\to}x\\\\overset{\\\\text{secret}: S}{\\\\to}x'\\\\overset{\\\\text{secret}: P}{\\\\to}y'\\\\overset{\\\\text{secret}: T}{\\\\to}y  HFE variations  Hidden Field Equations has four basic variations namely +,-,v and f and it is possible to combine them in various way. The basic principle is the following: :01. The + sign consists of linearity mixing of the public equations with some random equations. :02. The - sign is due to Adi Shamir and intends to remove the redundancy 'r' of the public equations. :03. The f sign consists of fixing some f input variables of the public key. :04. The v sign is defined as a construction and sometimes quite complex such that the inverse of the function can be found only if some v of the variables called vinegar variables are fixed. This idea is due to Jacques Patarin. The operations above preserve to some extent the trapdoor solvability of the function. HFE- and HFEv are very useful in signature schemes as they prevent from slowing down the signature generation and also enhance the overall security of HFE whereas for encryption both HFE- and HFEv will lead to a rather slow decryption process so neither too many equations can be removed (HFE-) nor too many variables should be added (HFEv). Both HFE- and HFEv were used to obtain Quartz. For encryption, the situation is better with HFE+ since the decryption process takes the same amount of time, however the public key has more equations than variables.  HFE attacks  There are two famous attacks on HFE: Recover the Private Key (Shamir-Kipnis): The key point of this attack is to recover the private key as sparse univariate polynomials over the extension field \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^n} . The attack only works for basic HFE and fails for all its variations. Fast Gr√∂bner Bases (Faug√®re): The idea of Faug√®re's attacks is to use fast algorithm to compute a Gr√∂bner basis of the system of polynomial equations. Faug√®re broke the HFE challenge 1 in 96 hours in 2002, and in 2003 Faug√®re and Joux worked together on the security of HFE.  References  * Nicolas T.

Originally conceived as a brief, light story about the complications created in her family's social set by a young girl coming of age, the novel expanded into a general treatment of decadence and corruption in English fin de si√®cle life. James presents the novel almost entirely in dialogue, an experiment that adds to the immediacy of the scenes but also creates serious ambiguities about characters and their motives.  Plot summary  Mr. and Mrs. Edward Brookenham host an effete, rather corrupt social circle. They are the parents of worthless Harold and sweet but knowledgeable Nanda (age eighteen). Mr. Longdon attends one of their social functions and is amazed at how much Nanda resembles her grandmother, his long-ago love who married another man. Vanderbank, a young civil servant with little money, admires both Mrs. Brookenham (nicknamed \\"Mrs. Brook\\") and Nanda. Mrs. Brook seems to want an affair with \\"Van\\" but he appears more interested in Nanda. Mr. Longdon promises him a dowry if he marries Nanda. Mrs. Brook is instead trying to get her daughter married to Mitchy, a very rich but rather naive member of her social circle. But Nanda urges Mitchy to marry Aggie, the supposedly sheltered step-niece of one of Mrs. Brook's friends (the Duchess). Mitchy follows the advice, then watches helplessly as Aggie kicks over the traces and starts playing around on him. Van constantly hesitates about proposing to Nanda. She finally tells him and Mitchy to be kind to her mother, then prepares to stay at Mr. Longdon's country home as a kind of surrogate daughter.  Key themes  James originally wanted this novel to resemble one of Gyp's superficial but entertaining novels of social decadence. But the material drew him on, and he wound up with a lengthy book about Nanda's eventual rejection of the often sleazy social circle around her mother. A lot of the characters who drop by Mrs. Brook's house are certainly no saints, and hypocrisy and deceit seem to be their favorite pastimes. Mr. Longdon represents an idealized previous age of better morals and manners. He wants to see Nanda safely married and away from what he views as her mother's corrupting influence. Although the book ends with Nanda preparing to stay at his country house, there are no guarantees as to how her future will play out. With the novel cast almost entirely in dialogue, it's sometimes difficult for the reader to detect the characters' genuine motives. But there's little doubt James meant the book as an attack on what he saw as the increasing irresponsibility and immorality of the society around him. James was always careful to sweeten this rather dour message with a lot of witty satire on the foibles of Mrs. Brook's social circle. He was particularly proud of his treatment of the resourceful if not overly honest Mrs. Brook herself. Many critics see the novel as parallel in theme and setting to James's earlier novel What Maisie Knew, with Nanda as a slightly older version of Maisie.  Critical evaluation  Critics have strongly disagreed on the worth of The Awkward Age. F.R. Leavis praised it highly, calling it \\"one of James' major achievements.\\" Edmund Wilson, on the other hand, showed little patience with the \\"gibbering crew\\" surrounding Nanda with their vaguely corrupt schemes. More recent commentators have expressed similar differences. Many critics, such as Edward Wagenknecht, have detected over-treatment in the almost-all-dialogue presentation, which often strings out scenes to great length and complexity. James rejected this criticism emphatically in the New York Edition preface.

Juan Perez de Montalban, 1639 Biography He was born at Madrid. At the age of eighteen, he became a licentiate in theology. He was ordained priest in 1625, and appointed notary to the Inquisition. In 1619 he began writing for the stage under the guidance of Lope de Vega, who is said to have assisted him in composing El Orfeo en lengua castellana (1624), a poem obviously intended to compete with J√°uregui's Orfeo, published earlier in the same year. Montalb√°n's father, a publisher at Madrid, issued a pirated edition of Quevedo's Busc√≥n, which roused an angry controversy. The violence of these polemics, the strain of overwork, and the death of Lope de Vega so affected Montalb√°n that he became insane; he died at Madrid on 25 June 1638. His last work was a eulogistic biography of Lope de Vega in the Fama p√≥stuma (1636). Works His plays, published in 1635‚Äì1638, are all in the manner of Lope de Vega. They were staged with much success, but, with the exception of Los Amantes de Teruel, are little more than clever improvizations. Montalb√°n almost rivaled Lope de Vega in dramatic productiveness, but, according to one critic, he followed that writer's conventional manner, flimsiness in construction, and carelessness in execution too closely. The prose tales in Sucesos y prodigios de amor, en ocho novelets ejemplares (1624) and Para todos: Exemplos morales, humanos y divinos (1632) were very popular. George Ticknor characterized ‚ÄúThe Disastrous Friendship,‚Äù a tale in the former collection, as one of the best in the Spanish language. ‚ÄúAurora and the Prince,‚Äù was translated into English by Thomas Stanley (1647).London: printed for Humphrey Moseley, at the signe of the Princes Armes in St. Pauls Church-yard, 1647 A libellous attack on Quevedo, entitled El Tribunal de la justa venganza (1635), is often ascribed to Montalb√°n.

Introduced in 1985 by Mikhail Gromov, pseudoholomorphic curves have since revolutionized the study of symplectic manifolds. In particular, they lead to the Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants and Floer homology, and play a prominent role in string theory. Definition Let X be an almost complex manifold with almost complex structure J. Let C be a smooth Riemann surface (also called a complex curve) with complex structure j. A pseudoholomorphic curve in X is a map f : C \\\\to X that satisfies the Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equation :\\\\bar \\\\partial_{j, J} f := \\\\frac{1}{2}(df + J \\\\circ df \\\\circ j) = 0. Since J^2 = -1, this condition is equivalent to :J \\\\circ df = df \\\\circ j, which simply means that the differential df is complex-linear, that is, J maps each tangent space :T_xf(C)\\\\subseteq T_xX to itself. For technical reasons, it is often preferable to introduce some sort of inhomogeneous term u and to study maps satisfying the perturbed Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equation :\\\\bar \\\\partial_{j, J} f = u. A pseudoholomorphic curve satisfying this equation can be called, more specifically, a (j, J, u)-holomorphic curve. The perturbation u is sometimes assumed to be generated by a Hamiltonian (particularly in Floer theory), but in general it need not be. A pseudoholomorphic curve is, by its definition, always parametrized. In applications one is often truly interested in unparametrized curves, meaning embedded (or immersed) two-submanifolds of X, so one mods out by reparametrizations of the domain that preserve the relevant structure. In the case of Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants, for example, we consider only closed domains C of fixed genus g and we introduce n marked points (or punctures) on C. As soon as the punctured Euler characteristic 2 - 2 g - n is negative, there are only finitely many holomorphic reparametrizations of C that preserve the marked points. The domain curve C is an element of the Deligne‚ÄìMumford moduli space of curves. Analogy with the classical Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equations The classical case occurs when X and C are both simply the complex number plane. In real coordinates :j = J = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}, and :df = \\\\begin{bmatrix} du/dx & du/dy \\\\\\\\\\\\ dv/dx & dv/dy \\\\end{bmatrix}, where f(x, y) = (u(x, y), v(x, y)). After multiplying these matrices in two different orders, one sees immediately that the equation :J \\\\circ df = df \\\\circ j written above is equivalent to the classical Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equations :\\\\begin{cases} du/dx = dv/dy \\\\\\\\\\\\ dv/dx = -du/dy. \\\\end{cases} Applications in symplectic topology Although they can be defined for any almost complex manifold, pseudoholomorphic curves are especially interesting when J interacts with a symplectic form \\\\omega. An almost complex structure J is said to be \\\\omega- tame if and only if :\\\\omega(v, J v) > 0 for all nonzero tangent vectors v. Tameness implies that the formula :(v, w) = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\omega(v, Jw) + \\\\omega(w, Jv)\\\\right) defines a Riemannian metric on X. Gromov showed that, for a given \\\\omega, the space of \\\\omega-tame J is nonempty and contractible. He used this theory to prove a non-squeezing theorem concerning symplectic embeddings of spheres into cylinders. Gromov showed that certain moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves (satisfying additional specified conditions) are compact, and described the way in which pseudoholomorphic curves can degenerate when only finite energy is assumed. (The finite energy condition holds most notably for curves with a fixed homology class in a symplectic manifold where J is \\\\omega-tame or \\\\omega-compatible). This Gromov compactness theorem, now greatly generalized using stable maps, makes possible the definition of Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants, which count pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds. Compact moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves are also used to construct Floer homology, which Andreas Floer (and later authors, in greater generality) used to prove the famous conjecture of Vladimir Arnol'd concerning the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian flows. Applications in physics In type II string theory, one considers surfaces traced out by strings as they travel along paths in a Calabi‚ÄìYau 3-fold. Following the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, one wishes to compute certain integrals over the space of all such surfaces. Because such a space is infinite-dimensional, these path integrals are not mathematically well-defined in general. However, under the A-twist one can deduce that the surfaces are parametrized by pseudoholomorphic curves, and so the path integrals reduce to integrals over moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves (or rather stable maps), which are finite-dimensional. In closed type IIA string theory, for example, these integrals are precisely the Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants.

Among the supporting actors are Michael Kitchen and Brian Blessed. The film was based on the 1886 novel Kidnapped by author Robert Louis Stevenson. Christopher Reeve had originally been cast as Breck prior to his spinal cord injury in a horse race which left him a quadriplegic on May 27, 1995. The adaptation starts by describing a divided Scotland which is populated by Highlanders and Lowlanders who are loyal to different kings. Alan Breck Stewart is characterised as a leading figure of Jacobitism who tried \\"to keep the flame alive\\". It ends when Stewart leaves Scotland forever \\"to have a distinguished career in the French Army\\", while Balfour stays and marries a lady from the Highlands. Another voice-over tells they had sons who \\"were neither Highlanders nor Lowlanders. They were Scots.\\" The film was shot in Ireland. Plot=Part 1= Alan Breck Stewart (Armand Assante) returns to his home village, which is already menaced by the highland clearances. His foster father James Stewart of the Glen (Brian McGrath) issues the taxpayers' money for the exiled House of Stuart to him and beseeches him to meet King George's factor, the \\"Red Fox\\" Colin Roy Campbell of Glenure (Brendan Gleeson). Alan Stewart only grudgingly complies, because he regards the ‚ÄúRed Fox‚Äù as a traitor, for at the Battle of Culloden he had to fight against Loudon's Highlanders, a regiment of Highlanders led by Campbells. At about the same time David Balfour (Brian McCardie) leaves the fictitious small village Essendean in the Scottish Lowlands. Reverend Campbell tells him he was given a letter in charge by David's late father. It is a letter of introduction addressing a Laird. The reverend informs him that his late mother never wanted him to go to the ‚ÄúHouse of Shaws‚Äù and asks him to stay in Essendean. But David is driven by wanderlust, and therefore resolves to go. The \\"Red Fox\\" receives Alan Stuart with an abettor who holds the guest at gun point. An English officer named William Reid (Michael Kitchen) and his soldiers are in waiting when the \\"Red Fox\\" offers to protect James Stewart of The Glen. Alan Stuart asks him twice to swear his kin will be protected indeed but even so he merely receives a mute grin. Alan decides the man cannot be trusted and eludes in order to continue his mission. David has meanwhile reached the ‚ÄúHouse of Shaws‚Äù. He also finds all of a sudden a gun directed at him. The man who threatens to shoot him turns out to be his uncle Ebenezer (Patrick Malahide). Ebenezer reluctantly invites him in, but later on tries to kill him by an arranged accident. David survives, yet the next day Ebenezer has him kidnapped by a criminal sea captain. David wakes up on a ship going to America, where he shall be sold as a slave. When David is trapped, William Reid and ‚Äúthe Red Fox‚Äù try to assassinate Alan Breck in the woods. They fail because William Reid smokes a pipe with strong tobacco. Alan Breck, who therefore can literally smell the trap, steals a horse and escapes. He leaves a paper with a quote from A Counterblaste to Tobacco written by James I of England. The ‚ÄúRed Fox‚Äù relishes this humiliation of Englishman William Reid. David becomes Captain Forbes' new cabin boy, for the previous cabin boy has been murdered by the sailor Mr. Shuan. Alan Breck, who needs to leave for France in a foggy night, accidentally happens to end up on the same ship. David is supposed to wait on Alan. The criminal sea captain attempts to ambush Alan for his gold but David confounds these plans and helps Alan Breck to stand his ground. A severe storm then causes a wreckage. Alan and David return as castaways to the Scottish onshore. Alan runs into his friend Ewan of Appin, who was just exposed as a Jacobite spy. As his dying friend informs him, William Reid plans to frame James Stewart of The Glen for a murder he is about to carry out. Alan tries to prevent this but he can only witness how the \\"Red Fox‚Äù is shot dead by a sniper. David gets the impression Alan was the assassin and breaks up with him. =Part 2= David is caught by British soldiers who consider him an accomplice of the murderer. Alan can free him. Once they are safe, Alan refutes David's theories about the murder. Both of them go to James Stewart of The Glen and warn him. Against his will he is defended by them when the Red Coats come to arrest him. Soon William Reid himself comes to Alan's home village in order to arrest Alan's foster father. James Stewart of The Glen sacrifices himself for his people's sake, but despite that they are driven off the land. Captain Forbes (Adam Blackwood), William Reid's direct subordinate, is appalled. Alan seeks to prove James Stewart's innocence. He visits gunsmith Angus (David Kelly), who has produced the very gun used for the Appin Murder. This leads to Hamish MacDonald (Jonathan Ryan) as a primary suspect. Alan now goes to the Earl of Dunbrea (Alan Stanford), a former MacDonald clan chief and asks him for support. The Earl's grand daughter Mary guides Alan and David to her cousin Hamish's house. Hamish does confess the murder but William Reid kills him under the pretence of self-defence. Alan is put in prison and is forced to watch James Stewart of The Glen being executed. David and the Earl of Dunbrea and his granddaughter free Alan Breck. In order to hide, Alan visits his old brother-in-arms Ewen MacPherson of Cluny (Brian Blessed). William Reid concedes to Captain Forbes that he has indeed paid Hamish MacDonald to kill the ‚ÄúRed Fox‚Äù. As Captain Forbes learns, the ‚ÄúRed Fox‚Äù was considered too lenient towards his fellow countrymen and now William Reid is his successor as the King's factor. Following that Captain Forbes meets with Alan Breck and condones Reid's looming demise. Even so, before Alan Breck finally confronts William Reid and kills him, he takes care that David can eventually successfully claim his heritage. After he had done for David Balfour, what he failed to achieve for Bonnie Prince Charlie, he puts an end to William Reid's deceptive schemes and then leaves Britain forever.

Cluentius, from Larinum in Samnium, was accused in 69 BC by his mother Sassia of having poisoned his stepfather, Statius Abbius Oppianicus. Cluentius had prosecuted Oppianicus successfully in 74 BC for attempting to poison him, securing Oppianicus' exile. Both sides in the lawsuit were accused of bribing the jurors during the trial to secure conviction of one another, but only Oppianicus' bribe was revealed at the time. Oppianicus died in disgrace three years later, leaving his widow Sassia to plot revenge against her son. Cicero divides his action in two parts: in the first one, he defends Cluentius' reputation. He shows that Oppianicus' crimes were so enormous, that Cluentius had no need of corrupting the judges; actually, he ridicules Oppianicus because he was cheated by a mediator in bribes. The second part deals with the alleged poisoning, and is very brief, since Cicero considers the accusation as ludicrous. Oppianicus Statius Albius Oppianicus came from one of Larinum's most prominent families, the Oppianici; he was married five different times throughout his life and was widely suspected of poisoning his first wife Cluentia. Through his son Oppianicus the Younger, the issue of Oppianicus' second marriage to Magia Auria, Oppianicus senior plotted to obtain the fortune of his mother-in-law Dinaea. Oppianicus the Younger was the heir-presumptive to Dinaea's estate, recently enlarged after the deaths of two of her sons, Gnaeus Magius and Numerius Aurius, in the Civil Wars between Marius and Sulla. However, it was discovered that her presumed-dead third son, M. Aurius, was in fact alive and living in servitude in the Ager Gallicus. Oppianicus arranged for the murder of Dinaea and sent an assassin to kill M. Aurius before he could be rescued by family members. He then altered Dinaea's will, which had left only a portion of her estate to her grandson, making Oppianicus the Younger the sole inheritor. When the news of M. Aurius' death in Gaul reached Larinum, the relatives of Dinaea raised such an outcry that Oppianicus fled the town and took refuge in one of Sulla's camps. Through the favor he enjoyed with Sulla, Oppianicus had his Aurii accusers proscribed; he returned to the town with martial powers and killed his enemies. The paternal aunt of Cluentius was Oppianicus' ex-wife; Oppianicus kills her and, with the same poison, his own brother. His brother's wife is pregnant; Oppianicus poisons her before she bears, and inherits. Cn. Magius, Oppianicus' brother-in-law, dies; in his will, he leaves everything to his yet unborn son. Oppianicus, who is next in the line of succession, pays Magius' wife a large sum, and she aborts. He then marries her, although the marriage does not last long. Then he goes to Rome, becomes intimate with a young dissolute, Asuvius, and kills him after he has signed a will in his favor. In 80 BC, Oppianicus fell in love with Sassia, the widow of his former brother-in-law, Aulus Cluentius Habitus the Elder. Cluentius the Elder had fallen victim to the Sullan proscriptions and the widowed Sassia then fell in love with her son-in-law Melinus and forced her daughter to divorce him so that she could marry him herself. Oppianicus arranged for the murder of Melinus so that Sassia could be free to marry him; she was disinclined, however, to be a stepmother, so Oppianicus obligingly murdered his two youngest sons before she agreed to the marriage. Aftermath Cicero was so successful that the young Cluentius was absolved of the charges. In the process the reputation of Sassia was completely destroyed. According to Quintilian, Cicero afterwards boasted that he had pulled the wool over the judges' eyes (se tenebras offudisse iudicibus in causa Cluenti gloriatus est, Institutio Oratoria 2.17.21; the context is in discussion of orators who say false things not because they are themselves unaware of the truth, but to deceive other people). Cicero's spirited defence in Pro Cluentio presents an insight into the life in Larinum in 66 BC, and also provides an image of a ruthless woman which has lasted for more than two thousand years.

In 1907, she founded the Women‚Äôs Guild of Arts with Mary Elizabeth Turner, as the Art Workers Guild did not admit women. She edited her father's Collected Works in 24 volumes for Longmans, Green and Company, published from 1910 to 1915, and, after his death, commissioned two houses to be built in the style that he loved in the village of Kelmscott in the Cotswolds. Her companion at Kelmscott from 1917 until her death was Mary Lobb, a Land Army volunteer in the village. May Morris died at Kelmscott Manor on 17 October 1938. Embroidery Embroidered Altar frontal, executed by May Morris from a design by Philip Webb.\\"The work is carried out with floss silk in bright colours and gold thread, both background and pattern being embroidered. The five crosses, that are placed at regular intervals between the vine leaves, are couched in gold passing upon a silvery silk ground.\\" Christie, Grace (Mrs. Archibald H.): Embroidery and Tapestry Weaving, London, John Hogg, 1912; e-text at Project Gutenberg; notes to Plate XIII. May Morris was an influential embroideress and designer, although her contributions are often overshadowed by those of her father, a towering figure in the Arts and Crafts movement. She continued his resurrection of free-form embroidery in the style which would be termed art needlework. Art needlework emphasized freehand stitching and delicate shading in silk thread thought to encourage self-expression in the needleworker in sharp contrast with the brightly coloured Berlin wool work needlepoint and its \\"paint by numbers\\" aesthetic which had gripped much of home embroidery in the mid-19th century. May Morris was also active in the Royal School of Art Needlework (now Royal School of Needlework), founded as a charity in 1872 under the patronage of Princess Helena to maintain and develop the art of needlework through structured apprenticeships. The school originally opened in the autumn of 1872 in rooms in Sloane Street, London, with a staff of twenty women overseen by Lady Welby and Mrs Dolby, an \\"authority in ecclesiastical work\\".Lady Marion M. Alford, Needlework as Art. London: Sampson Low, Marston, Searle, and Rivington, 1886, 396. While the course available in the government schools of design for women was theoretical only, the RSAN had the distinct advantage of a practical, hands-on technical training. The school grew rapidly, and by 1875 had moved into their third locale, conveniently located in Exhibition Road next to the South Kensington Museum. The collections of ancient embroidery in the Museum were studied in an effort to understand and relearn old work. Also among the staff at the RSAN were Jane Morris's sister, Elizabeth Burden, who was chief technical instructor from 1880,Marianne Tidcombe, Women Bookbinders 1880‚Äì1920 (New Castle, DE: Oak Knoll Press & London: The British Library, 1996) 80. and designers Deborah Birnbaum (c1889) and Nellie Whichelo (c1890).Anthea Callen, Women Artists of the Arts and Crafts Movement, 1870‚Äì1914. New York: Pantheon Books, 1979. 100, 101; Art & Crafts Exhibition Society Catalogues 1888‚Äì1916. May Morris taught embroidery at the LCC Central School of Art in London from 1897, and was head of the Embroidery department from 1899 until 1905, thereafter continuing her association with the Central School as Visitor until 1910.Jan Marsh, \\"May Morris: Ubiquitous, Invisible Arts and Crafts-woman\\", in Bridget Elliott & Janice Helland eds, Women Artists and the Decorative Arts 1880‚Äì1935 (Aldershot, Hants: Ashgate Publishing Ltd, 2002) 42. She also taught at Birmingham, Leicester and Hammersmith Art School. By 1916, there were many art schools under the LCC umbrella that included embroidery in their curriculum. Among the embroidery instructors were sisters Ellen M Wright and Fanny I Wright, both previously employed in the Embroidery Department at Morris & Co., and trained by May Morris. Ellen M Wright also taught at the Clapham School of Art, aided by Miss F Pooley, and Eleanor R Harriss and Mrs L Frampton taught at the Hammersmith School of Arts & Crafts.\\"Introduction\\", in Arts & Crafts Exhibition Society, Catalogue of the Eleventh Exhibition, 1916 . Jewellery Morris also designed and made jewellery. She began to design jewellery around the turn of the 20th century, and was probably inspired by the Birmingham jewellers Arthur and Georgie Gaskin, who were old family friends.https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O76641/girdle-morris-may/ Examples of her jewellery are in the Victoria and Albert Museum and Amgueddfa Cymru ‚Äì National Museum Wales Publications * Decorative Needlework.

Biography Juan Mart√≠nez de J√°uregui y Hurtado de la Sal was born and baptized in Seville, Andalusia. His parents were Miguel Mart√≠nez de J√°uregui, a hidalgo‚Äîwhich is an untitled Spanish nobleman‚Äîfrom La Rioja, and Do√±a Isabel de la Sal from Seville. He was the fifth of their ten children; the oldest became later commissioner (regidor) of Seville.

The name of Cervantes at the top and that of J√°uregui at the bottom were added centuries after it was painted. About his youth very little is known. In his discourse Arte de la pintura (The Art of Painting) some references to various travels to Italy can be found and it is known that he stayed in Rome, probably to study painting.see Juan de J√°uregui He returned to Spain shortly before 1610 with a reputation as both a painter and a poet. In the preface to the Novelas exemplares, Miguel de Cervantes says that J√°uregui painted his picture, and in the second part of Don Quixote, praises J√°uregui's translation of Tasso's Aminta, published at Rome in 1607. The picture by J√°uregui is lost; there is no evidence supporting any surviving painting being that of J√°uregui.Chac√≥n y Calvo, Jos√© Mar√≠a. \\"Retratos de Cervantes.\\" Anales de la Academia Nacional de Artes y Letras [Cuba], vol. 27, 1947‚Äì1948, pp. 5‚Äì17.Lafuente Ferrari, Enrique. La novela ejemplar de los retratos de Cervantes. Madrid, Dossat, 1948. J√°uregui's Rimas (1618), a collection of graceful lyrics, where he integrated also some translations of Horace, Martial and Ausonius, is preceded by a controversial preface which attracted much attention on account of its outspoken declaration against the culteranismo of Luis de G√≥ngora. Another Spanish poet, Francisco de Quevedo, mentioned J√°uregui in \\"La perinola\\" with scorn. Through the influence of Gaspar de Guzm√°n, Count-Duke of Olivares, he was appointed groom of the chamber to Philip IV, and gave an elaborate exposition of his artistic doctrines in the Discurso po√©tico contra el hablar culto y oscuro (1624), a skillful attack on the new theories, which procured for its author membership in the honorary Order of Calatrava. It is plain, however, that the shock of controversy had shaken J√°uregui's convictions, and his poem Orfeo (1624) is visibly influenced by G√≥ngora. J√°uregui died at Madrid on 11 January 1641, leaving behind him a translation of the Pharsalia which was not published until 1684. This rendering reveals J√°uregui as a complete convert to the new school, and it has been argued that, exaggerating the affinities between Lucan and G√≥ngora‚Äîboth of Cordoban descent ‚Äî he deliberately translated the thought of the earlier poet into the vocabulary of the later master. This is possible; but it is at least as likely that J√°uregui unconsciously yielded to the current of popular taste, with no other intention than that of conciliating the public of his own day.

The film is based on the 1886 novel Kidnapped and the first half of the 1893 sequel Catriona by Robert Louis Stevenson. Plot Young David Balfour arrives at a bleak Scottish house, the House of Shaws, to claim his inheritance. The house and land have been under the custodianship of his father's brother, Ebeneezer Balfour, but on reaching adulthood, the land and property become David's. Ebeneezer is having none of it, however, so he first tries to murder him, then has him kidnapped by sea captain Hoseason, with whom he has \\"a venture for trade in the West Indies\\". David is shipped off to be sold as a slave in the Carolinas. He strikes up a friendship with Alan Breck, escaping from Prince Charles Edward Stuart's defeat at Culloden. Breck is in a cobble which is run down in the fog by Hoseason's ship and once aboard, asks Hoseason to take him to France. When Hoseason refuses, Breck offers him 60 guineas to put him down on Loch Linnhe. On discovering that Breck has a money belt full of Jacobite gold, Hoseason and his crew try to kill Breck, but he is forewarned by David and the two kill half a dozen of the crew before the others retreat. Hoseason offers terms to end the fighting, but the ship runs aground. Only Breck and Balfour appear to survive and they manage to get to land. They set out for Edinburgh, dodging the ruthless Redcoats. Numerous adventures follow as they meet up with Breck's family, friends and foes alike. These include Breck's cousin, James Stewart, and his daughter Catriona, with whom David falls in love. CastProduction The film was originally made for television but was screened in cinemas in some countries, as with other adaptations of classics directed by Delbert Mann, including Heidi and David Copperfield.

Preminger, who was not familiar with the book, read the script and complained to his friend, Gregory Ratoff, who was acting as Zanuck's assistant, that he did not want to direct the film because he had no understanding of the people in the part of the world where the story took place. Ratoff, however, persuaded him to accept. When Zanuck saw some of the rushes, he accused Preminger of cutting out a portion of the script without permission. During a heated argument, Preminger denied the charge, and when Zanuck yelled at him, Preminger yelled back. Preminger subsequently refused to apologize, and, according to the autobiography, because of the incident, he was prevented from working in Hollywood.

Diet and behaviour This animal's habitat is dry, open eucalypt forests and grassy woodlands at altitudes between sea level and 1,000 meters. A major component of their diet is truffles and other underground fungi, as well as roots and tubers. Insects and grubs are also eaten. It is unique in that it will travel up to 1.5 km from its nest to a feeding area, a considerable distance for such a small creature.Department of Primary Industries and Water (August 2006). The Tasmanian bettong]. Department of Primary Industries and Water. A nocturnal animal, the bettong sleeps during the day in a domed nest. The nests are made with densely woven grass, leaves and shredded bark in a sheltered site such as a shallow depression in the ground or under a fallen log or clump of vegetation. The animal uses its curved prehensile tail to transport the nesting materials to the nest site. The animal only uses the nest for one or two nights, before it moves on in search of food. Like other bettongs, the eastern bettong is a continuous breeder, producing young throughout the year.University of Tasmania, School of Zoology. Profile ‚Äì Tasmanian Bettong].

He began his career with Premier League side Manchester United in 1995 but was released two years later after failing to make a first-team appearance. He joined Preston North End for ¬£250,000 and managed to notch up 63 goals in 189 league matches until his departure to Manchester City in 2002. Macken eventually made his first Premier League appearance for City. He only managed to score seven goals in 51 appearances during his three years with City but notably scored against United in the Manchester derby in 2004. He signed for Crystal Palace in 2005 and while there, moved to Ipswich Town on loan. In 2007, he moved again to Derby County but was loaned out to Barnsley after failing to make an impact at Pride Park where he failed to score in 11 league appearances. He joined Barnsley permanently in 2008 and moved again to Walsall two years later. He was released by The Saddlers at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season and joined Northern Premier League side Northwich Victoria, before joining Stockport County briefly in 2013. He has one international cap for the Republic of Ireland which he earned in 2004 whilst a Manchester City player. Playing career=Preston North End= Macken began his career at Manchester United and signed professional in 1996, but never played a first- team game for them and left on 22 July 1997 in a ¬£250,000 move to Preston North End in 1997. He scored over 70 goals at Preston, twice winning the Player of the Year award. In 1999‚Äì2000, under David Moyes, 25 goals from Macken saw Preston win the Second Division title. =Manchester City= Following this success, Macken moved into the Premier League with a transfer to Manchester City in February 2002, for a fee of ¬£5 million. He is most remembered at City for scoring the winner in the 4-3 comeback win against Tottenham in the 2003‚Äì04 FA Cup on 4 February. However, he was severely hampered by a succession of injuries, and only made 27 league starts in over three years. This downturn in his career brought about a move away from Manchester and Macken joined Crystal Palace in the summer of 2005 for ¬£1.1 million. =Crystal Palace= Initially, Macken did not get into the Palace team, and was behind England international Andrew Johnson and Republic of Ireland international Clinton Morrison. An injury to Johnson gave him a chance, initially, but then he himself got injured. His own replacement, Dougie Freedman showed good form, and despite a recovery from injury, Macken did not get back in the team. However, things turned upwards from there. Poor form by Morrison in the run-up to the Christmas period gave Macken his chance, and he scored his first competitive goal for Palace in the game at Coventry City, on 14 October 2005 (he had previously scored in a pre-season friendly), and scored again on 26 December, at Ipswich Town, although he was later sent off. More injuries then continued to limit his chances, and the partnership with Johnson continued to alternate between Morrison and Dougie Freedman, with many fans voicing their discontent that Macken was not living up to his price- tag. Johnson was sold to Everton, prompting the return of S√°ndor Torghelle to the club from his loan at Panathinaikos, creating speculation that Macken may be leaving the club, but the appointment of Peter Taylor as manager appeared to silence this. Taylor, a known fan of Macken, had reportedly tried to sign him for Hull, while he was in charge there. Torghelle left permanently for Greece, but again his playing opportunities were limited. On deadline-day of the Summer 2006 transfer window, he made a further move to Ipswich Town in The Championship, this time on loan, being handed the number 27 shirt. The loan was finally agreed when Ipswich agreed to pay an increased proportion of his wages. Macken scored three goals for the Tractor Boys before returning to Selhurst Park. =Derby County= On 31 January 2007 Macken joined Derby County on a free transfer. Derby were promoted to the Premier League at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season, but he failed to win a regular place, or even score for The Rams, and was loaned out to Championship side Barnsley for two months in November 2007. Although he was recalled on 27 December 2007 he eventually signed a permanent deal with the Tykes on 28 January 2008 for an undisclosed six-figure fee. =Barnsley= Macken initially joined Barnsley on 1 November 2007, on loan from Derby County. He made his debut against the club that made his name, Preston North End. He remained goalless for his first nine games, despite having produced a string of fine performances. On 22 December, he scored his first Barnsley goal against promotion chasing Bristol City after a fine run and shot. The goals were flowing for Macken and he notched a brace against Stoke City on 26 December. First a header from a Martin Devaney corner. His second goal came courtesy of a Kayode Odejayi knock-down from another Devaney cross. He then returned to Derby after Paul Jewell took over. He made a couple of substitute appearances for the Rams but his inevitable return to Barnsley was secured on 28 January 2008 for ¬£200,000. The next day, he marked his return with a fine finish in the home game with Colchester United. He bagged the second goal in a 2‚Äì1 win over West Bromwich Albion on 9 February and he was again on the scoresheet as the Reds thrashed Ipswich Town on 11 March. He was released by Barnsley after the 2009‚Äì10 season and left when his contract expired in June. =Walsall= On 19 August 2010, League One club Walsall signed Macken on a one-year deal with the option of a further year. On 9 May 2012 it was announced that Macken had been released by Walsall. =Northwich Victoria= On 9 October 2012 it was reported that Macken had signed for Northwich Victoria. He made his debut for the club in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Newcastle Town, as an 80th-minute substitute, that evening. =Stockport County= On 31 January 2013, it was announced by Stockport County that Jon Macken had signed until the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season on a free transfer. Along with Mark Cullen and Jake Fowler, he was the first signing by new manager Darije Kaleziƒá. Macken made his Stockport debut as a second-half substitute in County's 3‚Äì2 home win over Nuneaton Town on 2 February. He scored his first goal for the club against rivals Macclesfield Town on 30 March.

He was noted for his uncompromising style and willingness to take contrarian stands. Gustavsen was born into a middle-class family in Drammen, where his father supported the family as the manager of the local cooperative store. Gustavsen started out his career as an industrial worker in Horten and Holmestrand. He became active in the Norwegian Labour Party youth movement (Arbeidernes Ungdomsfylking) in the fall of 1945 after he earned his university entrance certificate in a year. The year after, he was hired as a reporter for the regional socialist paper in Vestfold, moved on to the national youth periodical for the Labor Party, then was part of a radical group that formed a foreign affairs journal called Orienteering. Although most vocal on foreign policy issues related to the arms race and what the editors generally termed \\"power bloc politics,\\" the magazine became the platform for a left-wing faction within the Labor Party. This opposition was met with threats - sometimes carried out - of expulsion from the party. In 1961, Gustavsen left the party and formed Sosialistisk Folkeparti and was immediately elected into Storting, the Norwegian Parliament as a representative from Oslo. He served as an elected member for the Sosialistisk Folkeparti (SF) (1961‚Äì1965 and 1965‚Äì1969) and it successor Sosialistisk Venstreparti (1973‚Äì1977). When the Labor Party lost its majority in Stortinget, Gustavsen's party became necessary for Labor Party governments to survive votes of no confidence. Gustavsen decided to turn out the Labor government of Einar Gerhardsen in 1963 over the so-called Kings Bay Affair, ushering in a short-lived but symbolically important non-socialist government under John Lyng. Although Gustavsen's personality was strongly associated with his party, he made a considerable effort to resist that association. He opted out of reelection twice and had to be persuaded to resume leadership roles. He was a staunch opponent of Norwegian membership in the European Union and resisted the alliance with the Norwegian Communist Party. He risked criminal prosecution for his disclosures of Norwegian plans to build Loran C facilities in support of submarine warfare in Norwegian waters. In 1977 he resigned from politics and accepted the position as the Norwegian Development Agency's representative in Mozambique. He also resumed his journalistic career, acting as an editor for the party newspaper Ny Tid.

Life and career Downe became interested in music at a very early age. In high school he formed a band named The Bondage Boys, and going under the stage name \\"Vaun Hammer\\", he released a song with this band called \\"The Loser\\" on Northwest Metalfest, a compilation featuring ten Seattle-area bands, including early Metal Church.Northwest Metalfest Discogs Sometime after this, he left Seattle for San Diego and then moved on to Los Angeles. Before achieving musical fame, Taime worked for Retail Slut in Hollywood and ran the stage lights at the Troubadour. Magnus Walker of Serious Clothing accidentally got his start when, walking into Retail Slut, Downe asked where he had got his pants from. Even though Walker had actually bought them in Hollywood for less than $10, he replied 'England' and Downe asked him to source 8 pairs - at an agreed price of $25 - to sell in the store.Tedx Talks Go with your Gut Feelinghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDQrMoksJ4Q In 1985 he formed the band Faster Pussycat. The five-member band released their debut album in 1987. Faster Pussycat were signed to Elektra Records and sold over 500,000 copies of 1989's Wake Me When It's Over. They toured with Y&T;, Ace Frehley, Alice Cooper, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, KISS, David Lee Roth, and others. Their next album Whipped!, released in 1992, faced the surging popularity of alternative rock and was less popular. The band broke up that year, with Taime moving to Chicago to work with Pigface. Taime also sang backing vocals on Skid Row's 1995 cover of the Ramones' \\"Psycho Therapy\\". Taime returned to Los Angeles shortly after and put together his own industrial rock band called The Newlydeads for which he wrote and produced. Around 1998, he opened his own club, called The Pretty Ugly Club, with co-owner JD Terziu, and the club achieved the same level of success as The Cathouse, the club Taime had formerly run with Riki Rachtman. Taime has also been the promoter of other clubs in L.A. such as Thunder Pussy and Pretty Pussy. He also was the DJ at Metal Skool with Josh Richman as the MC. The Newlydeads released a remix CD called Re-Bound and in 2001 released Dead End. The same year Downe reunited for a tour with original Faster Pussycat members Brent Muscat and Greg Steele joining him. The newly re-formed band opened for Poison in 2002. In 2006, he released Dreams from a Dirt Nap, a Newlydeads best-of album, in May, and the new Faster Pussycat album The Power and the Glory Hole in July.

In prose literature, Yuan Zhen is particularly known for his work Yingying's Biography, which has often been adapted for other treatments, including operatic and musical ones. In poetry, he is remembered for the inclusion of some of his poems by popular anthologies, his verses on exotic topics (such as the former Liangzhou), and for being part of the group of \\"New Yuefu\\" poets, which often used poetry as a form of expression and protest, but one potentially subtle enough to avoid the likely repercussions of more direct criticism. The poetic circle in which Yuan Zhen was involved included Bai Juyi, among others. Politically Yuan Zhen was briefly chancellor, during the reign of Emperor Muzong. A native of Luoyang, Yuan Zhen was a descendant of Northern Wei's imperial family. He lost his father at the age of seven and moved to Fengxiang (), near today's Baoji, Shaanxi with his mother Lady Zheng (). Yuan began his writings at the age of fifteen. He was a member of Bai Juyi's literary circle and a key figure in the ancient literature revival. He was a friend of Bai Juyi and also of Xue Tao, a courtesan and famous poet who might have been his lover. Bai Juyi and Yuan Zhen made a \\"Green Mountain pact\\" to retire together as Taoist recluses once they had accumulated enough funds, but Yuan's untimely death kept them from achieving that dream.Hinsch, Bret. (1990). Passions of the Cut Sleeve. University of California Press. p. 81 In 813, Yuan wrote a grave inscription for Du Fu, which contains some of the earliest known praise for his predecessor's works.  Background  Yuan Zhen was born in 779, around the time of Emperor Dezong's ascension to the throne.Old Book of Tang, vol. 166.Old Book of Tang, vol. 12. He was a 10th-generation descendant of Tuoba Shiyijian, the grandfather of Northern Wei's founder Emperor Daowu, who was posthumously honored Emperor Zhaocheng after Northern Wei's founding.New Book of Tang, vol. 75.That Tuoba Shiyijian was Emperor Daowu's grandfather is pursuant to most traditional accounts, but there has been some doubt raised on whether Tuoba Shiyijian was actually Emperor Daowu's father. See Emperor Daowu's article for more details. Yuan Zhen's male ancestor line was renamed Yuan, from Tuoba, when Emperor Xiaowen changed Xianbei names to Han names in 496.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 140. Subsequently, ancestors of Yuan Zhen's served as officials of Sui Dynasty and Tang Dynasty. His grandfather Yuan Fei () served as a county secretary general, while his father Yuan Kuan () served as a low-level official at the ministry of justice, as well as secretary to an imperial prince. Yuan Kuan died when Yuan Zhen was seven, and Yuan Zhen was raised by his mother Lady Zheng, who was considered an intelligent woman. As the household was poor, she did not send Yuan Zhen to school, but taught him to read and write herself. It was said that Yuan became capable of writing at age eight, and at age 14 passed the imperial examination for understanding two Confucian classics. At age 23, he was made a copyeditor at the Palace Library.  During Emperor Xianzong's reign  In 806, when Yuan Zhen was 27, during the reign of Emperor Dezong's grandson Emperor Xianzong, Yuan underwent a special imperial examination before Emperor Xianzong dealing with strategic thinking, and when the list of 18 examinees who passed the examination was announced, Yuan was ranked first ‚Äî in a group that included such individuals as Bai Juyi, Dugu Yu (), Xiao Mian, and Shen Chuanshi (). As a result, Yuan was made You Shiyi (), a junior advisor at the legislative bureau of government ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 237. Yuan had an outspoken personality, and after being put into an advisorial post, he started submitting suggestions to Emperor Xianzong. In particular, because the officials Wang Shuwen and Wang Pi, who dominated the court of Emperor Xianzong's father Emperor Shunzong ‚Äî who had previously served as Emperor Shunzong's staff members while Emperor Shunzong was crown prince ‚Äî were at that time denounced as frivolous and power-hungry, Yuan submitted an essay detailing what he saw as qualifications that the crown prince's and other imperial princes' staff members should have, and Emperor Xianzong was impressed upon reading it. Yuan further submitted proposals involving the defense of the northwestern borders with Tufan and Huigu. Emperor Xianzong, in response, summoned him and requested opinions on strategies to take there. As a result, though, the ruling officials at the time were jealous of Yuan, and they had him sent out of the capital Chang'an to serve as the sheriff of Henan County (), one of the two counties making up the eastern capital Luoyang. Yuan subsequently left governmental service for some time while observing a mourning period after his mother's death. Once the mourning period was over, he was recalled to governmental service, to serve as Jiancha Yushi (), a mid-level imperial censor. In 809, Yuan was on a mission to Dongchuan Circuit (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan), when he submitted accusations that the deceased former military governor (Jiedushi) of Dongchuan, Yan Li (), had collected taxes illegally and improperly seized the property of 88 households. As a result, the seven prefectural prefects who served under Yan were all punished. However, among the ruling officials, there were those who had deep friendships with Yan, and as a result of this incident, Yuan was sent out of the capital to serve at the Luoyang branch of the office of the imperial censors. While at Luoyang, he continued to pursue various officials for misconduct, including the caning of a county magistrate by the governor of Zhexi Circuit (ÊµôË•ø, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), Han Gao (), leading to the magistrate's death, and the improper use of imperial messenger posts by the military governor of Wuning Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), Wang Shao (), to host the casket of the recently deceased eunuch monitor of the Wuning army. Meanwhile, when the mayor of Henan Municipality (i.e., the Luoyang region, not only the two counties), Fang Shi (), was accused of improper conduct, Yuan issued an order suspending Fang from office pending investigations. However, after investigations, Fang was only punished by being stripped of one month of salary, and Yuan was recalled to Chang'an.New Book of Tang, vol. 174. While stopping at the imperial messenger post at Fushui (Êï∑Ê∞¥, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), Yuan got into a dispute with an imperial eunuch messenger ‚Äî variously reported as either Liu Shiyuan () (by the Old Book of Tang) or Qiu Shiliang (by the New Book of Tang), in which the eunuch, as a result of the dispute, hit Yuan's face and injured him ‚Äî Emperor Xianzong ruled that Yuan had overstepped his authorities as censor and demoted him to serve as the logistics officer at Jiangling Municipality (Ê±üÈôµ, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), despite defenses submitted on his behalf by Li Jiang, Cui Qun, and Bai.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 238. While at Jiangling, Yuan wrote many poems, and his style and Bai's were both popular and referred by the populace as Yuanhe Style () ‚Äî Yuanhe being Emperor Xianzong's era name. The eunuch monitor of Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered at Jiangling), Cui Tanjun (), was impressed by Yuan's talents and did not treat him as a subordinate, but rather with great respect; he also often collected Yuan's poems and recited them. Meanwhile, sometime thereafter, Yuan was made the military advisor to the prefect of Tong Prefecture (ÈÄöÂ∑û, in modern Nantong, Jiangsu), while Bai was made the military governor of Jiang Prefecture (Ê±üÂ∑û, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi). Despite the distance between the two, they often wrote poems to each other, which often ran 30 to 50 lines, sometimes up to 100 lines. The people of the Yangtze River region became impressed by their poems and often read and studied them. Many of Yuan's poems showed his sadness at being exiled from the capital. In 819, by which time Yuan was serving as the secretary general of Guo Prefecture (Ëô¢Â∑û, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), he was recalled to Chang'an to serve as Shanbu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®, Libu). Then-chancellor Linghu Chu, himself a talented writer, had long been impressed by Yuan's literary abilities, requested that he submit his writings to Linghu. Yuan did so, and the writings impressed LInghu greatly, comparing him to the Liu Song Dynasty poets Bao Zhao () and Xie Lingyun. Meanwhile, Emperor Xianzong's son and crown prince Li Heng, who had heard his concubines recite Yuan's poetry and referring to Yuan as \\"Savant Yuan\\" (), was impressed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 241.  During Emperor Muzong's and Emperor Jingzong's reigns  In 820, by which time Li Heng was emperor (as Emperor Muzong), Cui Tanjun was recalled to Chang'an, and he offered to Emperor Muzong, as a gift, a collection of over 100 poems by Yuan Zhen. Emperor Muzong was pleased, and asked Cui where Yuan was at that point, and Cui replied that Yuan was serving in an office lacking authority. That same day, Emperor Muzong promoted Yuan to be Cibu Langzhong (), a supervisorial official at the ministry of rites, and further put him in charge of drafting edicts for Emperor Muzong. However, because this was an irregular promotion, Yuan was looked down by his colleagues. On one occasion, when many imperial officials were gathering to eat melons, there were flies which gathered on the melons. Wu Ruheng () waved his fan to chase away the flies, and made the double entendre, \\"Where did you come from? Why did you come here?\\" This caused many of Wu's colleagues to be shocked and lose composure, but Wu did not. Nevertheless, Yuan's poetry continued to become increasingly popular at Chang'an, such that the people were rushing to learn it. Soon thereafter, Yuan was made chief imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÊâøÊó®Â≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi) as well as Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau. Because of the friendship that Yuan had with Cui, the other eunuchs were also trying to become friendly with Yuan, particularly the one of the directors of palace communications (Shumishi), Wei Hongjian (). In 821, Yuan was involved in an incident that was considered one of the precipitating incidents of the coming Niu-Li Factional Struggles. At that time, both Yuan and imperial scholar Li Deyu were involved in power struggles with Yuan's fellow Zhongshu Sheren Li Zongmin. Meanwhile, Li Zongmin's junior colleague at the legislative bureau, Yang Rushi () and the deputy minister of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang) Qian Hui () were in charge of overseeing the imperial examinations. The military governor Duan Wenchang (a former chancellor) and the imperial scholar Li Shen both made secret pleas to Qian for certain examinees. However, when the results were announced, the examinees that Duan and Li Shen recommended were not given passing results, while among those passing the examinations were Zheng Lang, the brother of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) official Zheng Tan; Pei Zhuan () the son of the military governor Pei Du (also a former chancellor); Li Zongmin's son-in-law Su Chao (); and Yang Rushi's brother Yang Yinshi (). This thus brought a popular uproar, and Duan submitted a report accusing Yang Rushi and Qian of being unfair. When Emperor Muzong requested opinions from the imperial scholars, Li Deyu, Yuan, and Li Shen all agreed with Duan's opinion. Emperor Muzong thus ordered Li Zongmin's colleague Wang Qi () to conduct a re- examination, while demoting Qian, Li Zongmin, and Yang Rushi to be prefectural prefects and deposing 10 of the examinees selected by Qian and Yang Rushi. This was said to be the start of some 40 years of struggles between Li Deyu and his associates (known as the Li Faction) and Li Zongmin and his associates (known as the Niu Faction, named after Li Zongmin's ally Niu Sengru). Meanwhile, Pei Du was leading a campaign against rebel generals Zhu Kerong and Wang Tingcou north of the Yellow River. It was said that, while Yuan had no resentment toward Pei personally, he wanted to be chancellor and was fearful that if Pei were victorious, Pei would be recalled and would again dominate the court, and therefore Yuan, as well as his ally Wei Hongjian, were interfering with requests that Pei was making of Emperor Muzong during the campaign. Pei, incensed, submitted a harshly worded accusation against Yuan and Wei. Emperor Muzong was displeased with Pei's accusations, but as Pei was a prominent statesman, placated Pei by demoting Wei to be the director of the imperial armory and Yuan to be the deputy minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Gongbu Shilang), relieving Yuan of his position as imperial scholar. However, it was said that Emperor Muzong continued to trust Yuan greatly, despite removing him from his imperial scholar post. Indeed, soon thereafter, after the campaign ended (when the imperial government capitulated to Zhu and Wang by making them military governors), Yuan was made a chancellor with the title Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). (It was said that the capitulation was advocated by Yuan, who wanted to relieve Pei of his military command.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 242. Meanwhile, during the campaign against Zhu and Wang, Wang had put Niu Yuanyi (), a general loyal to the imperial government, under siege at Shen Prefecture (Ê∑±Â∑û, in modern Hengshui, Hebei). Yu Fang (), an advisor to an imperial prince, who wanted to submit an extraordinary suggestion to gain a promotion, suggested to Yuan that Yu's friends Wang Zhao () and Yu Youming () be sent to Wang Tingcou's Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) to try to persuade Wang Tingcou's officers to lift the siege on Shen Prefecture. Yuan accepted the idea, and, as part of the plan, gave Wang Zhao and Yuan Youming some 20 commission certificates to give them to Wang Tingcou's officers. A man named Li Shang () heard of the plan, but misinterpreted this as a plot by Yuan and Yu Fang to assassinate Pei. He reported this to Pei, but Pei took no action. He then reported it to the Left Shence Army (). After Emperor Muzong received report of this, he had Han Gao investigate the matter. After the investigation was complete, it was concluded that there was no evidence that Yuan intended to assassinate Pei, but as a result, both Pei (who by this point had returned to Chang'an and was again serving as chancellor) and Yuan were relieved of their chancellor posts, less than four months after Yuan was made chancellor. Yuan was sent out of the capital to serve as the prefect of Tong Prefecture (ÂêåÂ∑û, in modern Weinan). When a number of advisorial officials subsequently submitted objections that Yuan's punishment was too light, Emperor Muzong stripped Yuan of one of his ceremonial posts as the director of Changchun Palace (Èï∑Êò•ÂÆÆ, in Tong Prefecture). While the investigations were still ongoing, the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, i.e., the Chang'an region), Liu Zungu (), was putting Yuan's house under constant guard. When Yuan complained about this, Emperor Muzong punished Liu. After Yuan served for two years at Tong Prefecture, he was made the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Zhedong Circuit (ÊµôÊù±, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang) as well as the prefect of its capital prefecture Yue Prefecture (). Yuan retained a staff that was also talented in literature, and they took tours of the picturesque locations of the circuit three or four times per month. They also often wrote poems. His deputy Dou Gong (), in particular, became a famed poet himself, and they often wrote poems to each other. Meanwhile, while at Zhedong, Yuan also became known for being corrupt and gathering wealth. He served there for eight years, including the entire brief reign of Emperor Muzong's son Emperor Jingzong.  During Emperor Wenzong's reign  In 829, by which time Emperor Jingzong's brother Emperor Wenzong was emperor, Yuan Zhen was recalled to Chang'an to serve as Shangshu Zuo Cheng (), one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). He tried to reorganize the bureau, and he expelled seven officials under him who had poor reputations. However, as Yuan himself was not known for exemplary ethics, he did not receive much support from other officials. When the chancellor Wang Bo died in 830, Yuan tried to use his connections to again become chancellor, but was unable to do so. Instead, he was sent out to Wuchang Circuit (Ê≠¶Êòå, headquartered in modern Wuhan, Hubei) to serve as its military governor and the prefect of its capital prefecture E Prefecture (). He became ill suddenly in fall 831 and died within a day of falling ill. He was given posthumous honors. As his son Yuan Daohu () was then only two years old, his funeral was hosted by his cousin Yuan Ji (). He left a collection of 100 volumes of poems, draft edicts, commemorative texts, and essays. He also compiled a 300-volume work collecting ancient and contemporary legal rulings. Poetry As an official, Yuan Zhen pursued his poetic activities under during Emperor Muzong's and Emperor Jingzong's reigns, both his own taking an active interest in the works of other poets. Yuan Zhen was part of the New Yuefu Movement, which involved poets interested in reviving some of the aspects of the yuefu style folk ballad verse popular during the Han Dynasty, with an interest in poetry as a form of political and societal critique. The group includes Bai Juyi (considered to be their leader), Zhang Ji, and Wang Jian. Yuan Zhen had four of his poems selected for inclusion in the famous poetry anthology Three Hundred Tang Poems. These were translated by Witter Bynner with the following titles: * \\"An Elegy I\\" * \\"An Elegy II\\" * \\"An Elegy III\\" * \\"The Summer Palace\\" The three \\"Elegies\\" are laments for his wife who died young.

Plot synopsis Two months ago, three monks, speaking Czech, rushed to perform a ritual while a powerful force of some sort threatened their lives. In the present, Buffy stakes a vampire outside an abandoned building, and then gets caught by the night watchman, who thinks she's a teen looking for a rave. As she turns to leave, he tells her not to forget her glow-ball, an effulgent orb which Buffy doesn't recognize but takes to investigate. Buffy makes breakfast for her mom, who is still suffering from headaches that the doctors can't explain. Dawn takes credit for the breakfast, telling Joyce that Buffy only helped. Joyce and Dawn bond (Joyce calling Dawn \\"my little pumpkin belly\\"), which leaves Buffy feeling like an outsider. Giles' big opening at The Magic Box is less than successful at first, but eventually, the magic shop gets to be so popular that he can't handle it all on his own. Buffy presents the orb to Giles, but Giles can't explain it right away, though he recognizes it as paranormal in origin because \\"it's so shiny.\\" While picking up a prescription for her mother at the hospital, Buffy encounters the night watchman again as he's being strapped down to a gurney. He's less than stable, but he manages to warn Buffy that she will be attacked through her family. A monk works on a blueprint in an empty building just as The Beast smashes through a large steel door, revealing itself to be a supernatural blond female. The Beast ties him up and tortures him for information about \\"the Key,\\" but he won't tell her anything. She starts to speak crazily until she puts her fingers to the head of a security guard and seems to suck the life force from him. Buffy assumes that the danger she was warned about is what is causing her mother's headaches. Anya recommends to Buffy that she perform a spell to reveal any spells that may be affecting her family. Buffy doesn't want Riley to feel unwanted, so she offers to let him help her with the spell. He realizes what she's doing, then they talk and agree to take care of each other. Buffy performs the ritual in her bedroom then walks around her house to look for anything unusual. Nothing appears weird about her mother, but Buffy sees Dawn's image flashing in and out of pictures around the house. When she enters Dawn's room, Buffy sees Dawn's possessions, bed, desk, and decorations also fading in and out, as well as Dawn herself. Buffy confronts Dawn about it, and she concludes that Dawn isn't her sister. Buffy physically assaults and threatens Dawn, telling her to stay away from their mother, but Buffy's supposed little sister appears truly confused and doesn't understand Buffy's sudden change in attitude. Giles calls to tell Buffy about the orb, a Dagon Sphere, and its purpose of protection from an unnamed evil. Buffy returns to the abandoned building in hopes of finding more information. Buffy encounters Spike lurking outside her home and demands to know what he was doing there. Spike gives a rather poor and unsatisfying explanation (\\"Out for a walk... bitch\\"), though Buffy nonetheless decides to let him off with a warning, to which Spike gets frustrated and launches a bizarre rant against her before departing, leaving Buffy puzzled. Looking down, Buffy notes a small pile of Spike's discarded cigarette butts; he must have been loitering there for several hours. Shaking her head, she proceeds to return to the warehouse as Dawn watches the whole exchange from the window. Buffy comes up against the Beast, who quickly proves to be too strong for Buffy to handle. After taking quite a beating, Buffy is able to escape with the monk. The Beast throws a tantrum, causing the room to collapse on her, which delays her pursuit. Back at The Magic Box, Giles offers Anya a job when he realizes that the job is too much for just one, and that she enjoys handling the money. In his last moments of life, the monk warns Buffy that she must protect the key. He tells her that the key is a collection of energy put into a human form, Dawn's form. They sent her to the Slayer to be protected from those looking for it. Before he dies, he tells her that her memories of Dawn were constructed, and that Dawn is now an innocent human who not only needs the protection of the Slayer, but also the love of a sister. When Buffy returns home, she apologizes to Dawn, and the two girls are able to relate on at least one subject - their concern for their mother.  Cultural references  * While Buffy prepares breakfast for Joyce, Dawn says, \\"Who died and made you the Iron Chef?\\" * Buffy orders Joyce, \\"I want you to relax all day, keep your feet up, plenty of Oprah.\\" Ratings * The original run of \\"No Place Like Home\\" attracted 6.4 million viewers, the highest rated episode of the season.

It remains popular in the 21st century. Cecil Sharp published the song in Folk Songs From Somerset (1906). It is related to Child Ballad 204 (Roud number 87), Jamie Douglas, which in turn refers to the ostensibly unhappy first marriage of James Douglas, 2nd Marquis of Douglas to Lady Barbara Erskine.  Themes and construction  The imagery of the lyrics describes the challenges of love: \\"Love is handsome, love is kind\\" during the novel honeymoon phase of any relationship. However, as time progresses, \\"love grows old, and waxes cold.\\" Even true love, the lyrics say, can \\"fade away like morning dew.\\" The modern lyric for \\"The Water Is Wide\\" was consolidated and named by Cecil Sharp in 1906 from multiple older sources in southern England, following English lyrics with very different stories and styles but the same meter. Earlier sources were frequently published as broadsheets without music. Performers or publishers would insert, remove, and adapt verses from one piece to another: floating verses are also characteristic of hymns and blues verses. Lyrics from different sources could be used with different melodies of the same metre. Consequently, each verse in the modern song may not have been originally composed in the context of its surrounding verses nor be consistent in theme. Variants The Water is Wide may be considered a family of lyrics with a particular hymn-like tune. O Waly Waly (Wail, Wail) may be sometimes a particular lyric, sometimes a family tree of lyrics, sometimes Jamie Douglas, sometimes one melody or another with the correct meter, and sometimes versions of the modern compilation The Water is Wide (usually with the addition of the verse starting O Waly, Waly). Benjamin Britten used the melody and verses of The Water is Wide for his arrangement‚Äîwhich does not have the O Waly, Waly verse, yet is titled Waly, Waly. A different melody is used for the song When Cockleshells turn Silver Bells, also subtitled Waly, Waly. Yet another melody for O Waly, Waly is associated with the Lord Jamie Douglas lyric. =Ancestors= A key ancestor is the lyric Waly, Waly, Gin Love Be Bonny from Ramsay's Tea Table Miscellany (1724), given below. This is a jumble of verses from other lyrics including Arthur's Seat shall be my Bed (1701), The Distressed Virgin (1633) and the Scottish scandal ballad Jamie Douglas (1776). The use of cockleshells and silver bells in Thomson's version (1725) pre-dates the earliest published Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary (1744) and may relate to torture.Mary Mary Quite Contrary Some though not all versions of Jamie Douglas have the first verse that starts 'O, Waly, Waly'. Andrew Lang found a variant verse in Ramsay's Tea Table Miscellany from a sixteenth-century song. =Cousins= Predecessors of The Water is Wide also influenced lyrics for other folk and popular songs, such as the modern version of the Irish Carrickfergus (1960s) and the American Sweet Peggy Gordan (1880). The Irish folk song Carrickfergus shares the lines but the sea is wide/I cannot swim over/And neither have I wings to fly. This song may be preceded by an Irish language song whose first line A Bh√≠ Bean Uasal (\\"It was a noble woman\\") matches closely the opening line of one known variation of Lord Jamie Douglas: I was a lady of renown. However, the content of the English-language Carrickfergus includes material clearly from the Scots/English songs not in any known copy of A Bh√≠ Bean Uasal suggesting considerable interplay among all known traditions. The Welsh version is called Mae'r m√¥r yn faith.https://sainwales.com/store/sheet-music/cs102 =Descendants= The modern The Water Is Wide was popularized by Pete Seeger in the folk revival. There have been multiple subsequent variations of the song and several names‚Äîincluding Waly, Waly, There is a Ship, and Cockleshells‚Äîwhich use and re-use different selections of lyrics. The song Van Diemen's Land on the album Rattle and Hum by U2 uses a variation of the melody of The Water Is Wide.Van Diemen's Land on songfacts.com The song \\"When the Pipers Play,\\" sung by Isla St. Clair on the video of the same name, uses the melody of \\"The Water is Wide.\\" In 1991, the French singer Renaud recorded La ballade nord-irlandaise (The Ballad of Northern Ireland), introducing the tune widely to the francophone world. And, in the Dunkerque carnival, they sing \\"putain d'Islande\\" based on the same melody.  Lyrics = Waly, Waly, Gin Love Be Bonny = The lyrics for \\"Waly, Waly, Gin Love Be Bonny\\" from Ramsay's Tea Table Miscellany (1724). O Waly, waly (a lament ‚Äì \\"woe is me\\") up the bank, And waly, waly doun the brae (hill), And waly, waly, yon burn-side (riverside), Where I and my love wont to gae. I lean'd my back into an aik (oak), I thocht it was a trusty tree; But first it bow'd, and syne (soon) it brak (broke), Sae my true love did lightly me. O waly, waly, but love be bonnie (beautiful), A little time while it is new, But when 'tis auld (old), it waxeth cauld (cold), And fades away like the morning dew. O wherefore should I busk my heid (adorn my head)? Or wherefore should I kame (comb) my hair? For my true love has me forsook, And says he'll never love me mair (more). Now Arthur Seat shall be my bed, The sheets shall ne'er be fyl'd by me, Saint Anton's well shall be my drink, Since my true love has forsaken me. Martinmas wind, when wilt thou blaw (blow), And shake the green leaves off the tree? O gentle death, when wilt thou come? For of my life I am weary. 'Tis not the frost, that freezes fell, Nor blawing snaws (snow) inclemency, 'Tis not sic cauld (such cold) that makes me cry, But my love's heart grown cauld to me. When we cam in by Glasgow town, We were a comely sight to see; My love was clad in the black velvet, And I my sell in cramasie (crimson). But had I wist (known), before I kiss'd, That love had been sae ill to win, I'd lock my heart in a case of gold, And pin'd it with a silver pin. Oh, oh! if my young babe were born, And set upon the nurse's knee, And I my sell were dead and gane, For a maid again I'll never be. = The Water Is Wide = Some popular lyrics for \\"The Water is Wide\\" are within the book Folk Songs For Solo Singers, though many versions have been printed and sung. :The water is wide, I cannot get over :Neither have I wings to fly :Give me a boat that can carry two :And both shall row, my love and I :A ship there is and she sails the sea :She's loaded deep as deep can be :But not so deep as the love I'm in :I know not if I sink or swim :I leaned my back against an oak :Thinking it was a trusty tree :But first it bent and then it broke :So did my love prove false to me :I reached my finger into some soft bush :Thinking the fairest flower to find :I pricked my finger to the bone :And left the fairest flower behind :Oh love be handsome and love be kind :Gay as a jewel when first it is new :But love grows old and waxes cold :And fades away like the morning dew :Must I go bound while you go free :Must I love a man who doesn't love me :Must I be born with so little art :As to love a man who'll break my heart :When cockle shells turn silver bells :Then will my love come back to me :When roses bloom in winter's gloom :Then will my love return to me J√ºrgen Klos traces the first verse to \\"I'm Often Drunk And Seldom Sober\\" (c. 1780), the second to \\"The Seamans leave taken of his sweetest Margery\\" (c. 1660), the third to \\"Oh Waly, Waly, Gin Love Be Bonny\\" (already 'old' when published in c. 1724), and the fourth to \\"Hey trollie lollie, love is jolly\\" (c. 1620.) He could not trace the melody before 1905. =Round= The Water is Wide I Cannot get over Nor have I Wings With which to-o-o fly O-o-h give me a boat That can carry Two We both shall Row My friend and I-i-I'' (repeat twice in parts with one part higher than the other and then sing in round with group two beginning to sing at the word 'Nor') ;Another version: The water is wide I cannot get o'er No wings have I No wings have I to-o fly Give me a boat That will carry two We both shall row, my friend and I. Verse 2: As I look out across the sea a Bright horizon beckons me And I am called to do my best and be the most that I can be. ;Another version, from Australia: The Voyage Home The water is wide, I cannot get o'er And neither have I wings to fly, Build me a boat that can carry two And both shall row, my love and I. I leaned my back up against an oak, To find it was a trusty tree, I found you true, love, when first you spoke, 'tis true you are, and ever shall be. Our love shines clearly against the storm, Turns darkest night to brightest day, Turns turbulent waters to perfect calm, A blazing lamp to light our way. Love is the centre of all we see, Love is the jewel that guides us true, No matter what, love, you'll stay with me, No matter what, my love, I'll stay with you. The water is wide, I cannot get o'er And neither have I wings to fly, Build me a boat that can carry two And both shall row, my love and I. ;Another version, from Canada: The water is wide, I cannot cross o'er, And neither have I the wings to fly. Build me a boat that can carry two And both shall row, my true love and I. A ship there is and she sails the sea She's laden deep, as deep can be. But not so deep as the love I'm in, And I know not if I sink or swim. I leaned my back against a young oak, Thinking 'twere a trusty tree. But first it bent and then it broke, Thus did my love prove false to me. O love is handsome and love is kind, Bright as a jewel when first it's new But love grows old and waxes cold, And fades away like the morning dew, And fades away like the morning dew.  Recent renditions = Arrangements = \\"O Waly, Waly\\" has been a popular choice for arrangements by classical composers, in particular Benjamin Britten, whose arrangement for voice and piano was published in 1948. John Rutter uses it for the Third Movement in his \\"Suite for Strings\\" (1973).See British Classical Music: The Land of Lost Content.

The valve is completely closed thereby obstructing the outflow of blood from the heart to the lungs. The pulmonary valve is located on the right side of the heart between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery. In a normal functioning heart, the opening to the pulmonary valve has three flaps that open and close In congenital heart defects such as pulmonary atresia, structural abnormalities can include the valves of the heart, and the walls and arteries/veins near the heart muscle. Consequently, blood flow due to the aforementioned structural abnormalities is affected, either by blocking or altering the flow of blood through the human cardiac muscle. Signs and symptoms The symptoms/signs of pulmonary atresia that will occur in babies are consistent with cyanosis, some fatigue and some shortness of breath (eating may be a problem as well). In the case of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect, one finds that decreased pulmonary blood flow may cause associated defects such as: * Tricuspid atresia * Tetralogy of Fallot (severe) * RV w/ double-outlet Cause Smoking In terms of the cause of pulmonary atresia, there is uncertainty as to what instigates this congenital heart defect. Potential risk factors that can cause this congenital heart defect are those the pregnant mother may come in contact with, such as: * Certain medications * Diet * Smoking Diagnosis In regards to the diagnosis of pulmonary atresia the body requires oxygenated blood for survival. pulmonary atresia is not threatening to a developing fetus however, because the mother's placenta provides the needed oxygen since the baby's lungs are not yet functional. Once the baby is born its lungs must now provide the oxygen needed for survival, but with pulmonary atresia there is no opening on the pulmonary valve for blood to get to the lungs and become oxygenated. Due to this, the newborn baby is blue in color and pulmonary atresia can usually be diagnosed within hours or minutes after birth. The diagnosis of pulmonary atresia can be done via the following exams/methods: an echocardiogram, chest x-ray, EKG and an exam to measure the amount of in the body. =Classification= Ventricular septal defect via echocardiogram There are two types of pulmonary atresia. * Pulmonary Atresia with Intact Ventricular Septum (PA-IVS) is a rare congenital malformation. PA-IVS involves complete blockage of the pulmonary valve located on the right side of the heart. This blockage prevents the flow of blood to the lungs. Because of this lack of blood flowing through the right side of the heart, the structures on that side, such as the pulmonary valve and the tricuspid valve, are abnormally small. * Pulmonary atresia with Ventricular Septal Defect (PA-VSD) is identified by underdevelopment of the right ventricle. The Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) is a second opening in the ventricular wall, which provides a way out for blood in the right ventricle. When this second opening does not exist, very little blood goes to the right ventricle, which is what causes it to be underdeveloped in PA-IVS, this defect can be determined before birth. Treatment Prostaglandin E1 The treatment of pulmonary atresia consists of: an IV medication called prostaglandin E1, which is used for treatment of pulmonary atresia, as it stops the ductus arteriosus from closing, allowing mixing of the pulmonary and systemic circulations, but prostaglandin E1 can be dangerous as it can cause apnea. Another example of preliminary treatment is heart catheterization to evaluate the defect or defects of the heart; this procedure is much more invasive. Ultimately, however, the individual will need to have a series of surgeries to improve the blood flow permanently. The first surgery will likely be performed shortly after birth. A shunt can be created between the aorta and the pulmonary artery to help increase blood flow to the lungs. As the child grows, so does the heart and the shunt may need to be revised in order to meet the body's requirements. Fontan procedure The type of surgery recommended depends on the size of the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, if the right ventricle is small and unable to act as a pump, the surgery performed would be the Fontan procedure. In this three-stage procedure, the right atrium is disconnected from the pulmonary circulation. The systemic venous return goes directly to the lungs, by-passing the heart. Very young children with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance may not able to undergo the Fontan procedure. Cardiac catheterization may be done to determine the resistance before going ahead with the surgery. Prognosis The prognosis for pulmonary atresia varies for every child, if the condition is left uncorrected it may be fatal, but the prognosis has greatly improved over the years for those with pulmonary atresia. Some factors that affect how well the child does include how well the heart is beating, and the condition of the blood vessels that supply the heart. Most cases of pulmonary atresia can be helped with surgery, if the patient's right ventricle is exceptionally small, many surgeries will be needed in order to help stimulate normal circulation of blood to the heart. If uncorrected, babies with this type of congenital heart disease may only survive for the first few days of life. Many children with pulmonary atresia will go on to lead normal lives, though complications such as endocarditis, stroke and seizures are possible.

When released in August 1977, it was warmly received critically, and noted for outselling the Beach Boys' contemporary efforts. Two singles were issued from the album, \\"River Song\\" and \\"You and I\\", which did not chart. The album remains a focal point of Wilson's legacy, being referred to as a \\"classic\\". It was voted number 838 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. Wilson intended to record a follow-up, entitled Bambu, but the album was left unfinished at the time of his death in December 1983. Background and recording After several attempts, starting in 1970, to realize his own project, some of which made it to the finished album, Wilson recorded the bulk of Pacific Ocean Blue in the months spanning the fall of 1976 to the following spring, at the Beach Boys' own Brother Studios. At the time of recording, Dennis' hard living had begun affecting his looks and more importantly his singing voice, which now delivered grainy and rough, yet still deeply soulful, vocals. Recalling the time Wilson spent working on the album, co-producer Gregg Jakobson said, \\"This was when he fully accepted himself as an artist. Brian had shown him chords on the piano, but as he'd become more proficient the music that came forth was not derivative of that. Having his own studio helped tremendously. With a little encouragement, and the right tools, Dennis took off.\\"Edmonds, Ben. \\"Dennis Wilson: The Lonely Sea\\". Mojo, November 2002 Brian reported that his reaction when Dennis played him early mixes of the album was \\"Dennis, that's funky! That's funky!\\" Reception Released in August 1977, Pacific Ocean Blue received mixed reviews upon release, but in subsequent years has been re-evaluated by critics and is now widely praised. Although it was praised contemporaneously by Brian Wilson, the elder Wilson denied knowing that Dennis had recorded an album at all in a 2008 interview with Pitchfork Media. It has appeared on several \\"Best-of\\" lists including Robert Dimery's \\"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die,\\" and Mojo's \\"Lost Albums You Must Own\\" and \\"70 of the Greatest Albums of the 70s\\" lists. In 2005, it was ranked #18 in GQ's \\"The 100 Coolest Albums in the World Right Now!\\" list. He did occasionally perform his solo material on the 1977 Beach Boys tour. Pacific Ocean Blue later developed a status as a cult item. In December 2018, under the name Chewing, Nik Ewing of Local Natives along with Cults, Nico Segal and Pop Etc covered Dennis Wilson's album in its entirety. https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8489939/local-natives-nik- ewing-chewing-dennis-wilson-album-songs At the time of its initial release, the album didn't do well commercially: Despite a significant promotional campaign, the album peaked at #96 during a short 12-week Billboard chart run. The disappointing performance of the record, combined with Wilson's increasingly unreliable professional behavior, led his record label to pull support for a modest West Coast tour that had been scheduled to promote the album.The Real Beach Stebbins,\\"Jon Stebbins, \\"Dennis Wilson: The Real Beach Boy\\" (2000)\\" Release history Issued by Caribou/CBS Records on CD in 1991, Pacific Ocean Blue went out of print within a year due to ongoing disagreements over copyright ownership; the album was virtually unavailable for more than fifteen years. Copies of the extremely rare 1991 CD sold for over $200. Legacy Recordings released a special 30th anniversary, 2-disc edition of Pacific Ocean Blue on June 17, 2008. It includes material from the Bambu sessions. A limited edition 180-gram vinyl multi-LP box set was also released on the Sundazed label. Notable on the reissue is the inclusion of the song \\"Holy Man\\", recorded for Pacific Ocean Blue in 1977, in two versions. Wilson had completed work on the instrumental backing track but never finished a satisfactory vocal, erasing an original attempt. For the reissue, Taylor Hawkins of the Foo Fighters was recruited to record a vocal version in Wilson's style given their similarities. The song's original lyricist, Gregg Jakobson, was tapped to help recall the song's original melody and to write lyrics for the song. In 2009, Queen guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor contributed vocals. Despite missing the UK Album Chart on its original 1977 release, the expanded reissue of Pacific Ocean Blue entered the UK album chart at #16, also reaching #5 on the Norway album chart.

It is associated with hypomorphic missense mutations in immunologically relevant genes of T-cells (and B-cells) such as recombination activating genes (RAG1 and RAG2), Interleukin-7 receptor-Œ± (IL7RŒ±), DCLRE1C-Artemis, RMRP-CHH, DNA- Ligase IV, common gamma chain, WHN-FOXN1, ZAP-70 and complete DiGeorge syndrome. It is fatal without treatment. Symptoms alt=Redness and scaliness of the entire skin on a 5-month-old female infant The symptoms are very similar to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This is because the patients have some T cells with limited levels of recombination with the mutant RAG genes. These T cells are abnormal and have a very specific affinity for self antigens found in the thymus and in the periphery. Therefore, these T cells are auto-reactive and cause the GVHD phenotype. A characteristic symptom is chronic inflammation of the skin, which appears as a red rash (early onset erythroderma). Other symptoms include eosinophilia, failure to thrive, swollen lymph nodes, swollen spleen, diarrhea, enlarged liver, low immunoglobulin levels (except immunoglobulin E, which is elevated), low T cell levels, and no B cells. Genetics Omenn syndrome is caused by a partial loss of RAG gene function and leads to symptoms similar to severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, including opportunistic infections. The RAG genes are essential for gene recombination in the T-cell receptor and B-cell receptor, and loss of this ability means that the immune system has difficulty recognizing specific pathogens. Omenn Syndrome is characterised by the loss of T-cell function, leading to engraftment of maternal lymphocytes in the foetus and the co- existence of clonally expanded autologous and transplacental-acquired maternal lymphocytes. Omenn syndrome can occasionally be caused in other recombination genes, including IL-7RŒ± and RMRP. DiagnosisTreatment The only treatment for Omenn syndrome is chemotherapy followed by a bone marrow transplantation. Without treatment, it is rapidly fatal in infancy.

It stars Warren Oates, Millie Perkins, Will Hutchins, and Jack Nicholson, and was produced by Nicholson and Hellman. The story is about two men who are hired by a mysterious woman to accompany her to a town located many miles across the desert. During their journey, they are closely tracked by a black-clad gunslinger, who seems intent on killing all of them. The film was shot in 1965 in the Utah desert, back-to-back with Hellman's similar Western, Ride in the Whirlwind, which also starred Nicholson and Perkins. Both films were shown at several international film festivals, but the U.S. distribution rights were not purchased until 1968, by the Walter Reade Organization. No other domestic distributor had expressed any interest in the films. Walter Reade decided to bypass a theatrical release, and the two titles were sold directly to television. Plot Willet Gashade (Oates), a former bounty hunter, returns to his small mining camp after a lengthy absence and finds his slow-witted friend Coley (Hutchins) in a state of fear. Coley explains to Gashade that their partner, Leland Drum (B. J. Merholz), had been shot to death two days before by an unseen assassin. The killing was possibly committed in revenge for the accidental trampling death of \\"a little person\\" in town, which may have been caused by Gashade's brother, Coigne. Coigne had inexplicably rushed away from their camp moments before the shooting death. Coley becomes increasingly paranoid, and Gashade takes his friend's gun away from him. The following day, a young woman (Perkins) shoots her horse to death immediately outside of the camp. The sound of the gunshot temporarily sends the frightened Coley into hiding. Gashade examines the dead horse and notes that it appeared to be perfectly healthy, though the woman had said its leg was broken. The woman offers Gashade a thousand dollars to lead her to a place called Kingsley. Although openly distrustful of her, he grudgingly accepts the offer. Coley, apparently smitten by the woman, accompanies them. The young woman is rude and insulting to both Gashade and Coley. She refuses to tell them her name. The three stop briefly in Crosstree. Gashade learns that Coigne was seen there only a day or two before. As they continue traveling slowly through the hot desert, Gashade observes that they are being followed by a stranger dressed in black. He is Billy Spear (Nicholson), who continues to keep his distance from them. Gashade sees that the woman appears to be signaling to the man. Coley makes attempts to talk to the woman, but she continually taunts and insults him. She also repeatedly refuses to answer any of Gashade's questions regarding the purpose of their journey. At night, Spear suddenly walks into their camp and joins them. Hired by the woman as a gunslinger for reasons unknown, Spear is suspicious and hostile toward Gashade and contemptuous of Coley. He repeatedly threatens both of their lives. Gashade advises Coley to keep away from Spear. The woman rides her horse hard. When it dies of exhaustion, Coley gives his horse to the woman and Gashade allows Coley to ride with him. Later, the woman loses the trail and asks Gashade to lead on. Gashade's horse shows signs of fatigue, so Gashade tells Coley to join the woman on her horse, but Spear forbids him from doing so. The woman says that the journey would be much easier without Coley. Spear and she demand that he be left behind. Gashade, under threat by Spear, reluctantly agrees and tells Coley he will come back for him soon. The three see a bearded man (Charles Eastman) sitting in the middle of the desert nursing a broken leg. The man tells the woman that the person she is seeking is only one day's ride away. She leaves him a canteen of water. Meanwhile, the bearded man's lost horse is found by Coley. He mounts the horse and rides back to the group. He charges at Spear, who shoots him dead. Gashade buries his friend in the sand. All of the horses die. The group runs out of water, but they still keep moving. Gashade sees Spear growing weaker, and when the moment is right, attacks him. They fight, and after knocking Spear unconscious, Gashade grabs a large rock and crushes the killer's gun hand. Gashade walks after the woman, who is now closely following a man up the side of a rock formation. The man turns around and Gashade sees that the man is his look-alike brother, Coigne. Gashade attempts to tackle the woman as she pulls out a gun and takes aim at Coigne, but it is too late; Coigne and the woman shoot each other dead. Gashade, lying next to the woman's corpse, whispers, \\"Coigne\\". Spear stumbles aimlessly under the hot sun. Cast * Warren Oates as Willett Gashade: By the time Warren Oates starred in The Shooting, he had become a veteran Western character actor, having appeared in dozens of film and television series in the genre since 1957. When director Hellman first suggested Oates as the star of the film, co-star and co-producer Nicholson immediately agreed with the choice, but during the filming, Nicholson and Oates repeatedly clashed, with the two frequently ending up in screaming matches. According to Hellman, production had to shut down for half a day when Oates refused to speak a lengthy amount of dialogue in the way Hellman wanted, preferring instead to whisper the lines almost unintelligibly. Oates stormed away from the film crew in anger when the director insisted. After Oates finally returned late in the afternoon, Hellman allowed the actor to read the lines the way he wanted, as long as he also read them in Hellman's preferred manner. In the editing room, Hellman rejected Oates's version. * Will Hutchins as Coley: As Gashade's dimwitted friend, Hutchins was cast in the same burst of inspiration that Hellman had when he also thought of Warren Oates and Millie Perkins for the other lead roles in the film. Like Oates, when The Shooting began production, Hutchins was already fully identified with the Western genre, having starred for several years in the ABC-TV television series Sugarfoot, which ran from 1957 to 1961. Both Perkins and Hellman later recalled the actor as being a funny and charming man, who never complained about the often adverse filming conditions. * Millie Perkins as the Woman: Best known for playing the title role in The Diary of Anne Frank, Perkins was Hellman's next-door neighbor when she was cast as the enigmatic, unnamed woman who leads the search party to their doom. The Shooting was her fifth film, immediately followed by another starring role in Hellman's companion Western, Ride in the Whirlwind. Although Perkins enjoyed working on both of Hellman's Westerns, and became good friends with Warren Oates, she was dismayed that Hellman insisted on such realism that he allowed only the most minimal of makeup to be applied to the actors. She felt she was constantly filmed in an unflattering manner. * Jack Nicholson as Billy Spear: This was the young actor's 13th film appearance, and his fourth with director Hellman. In addition to playing the odious villain, Nicholson had been asked by Hellman to co-produce the film. The director called that decision \\"the biggest mistake of my life.\\" Nicholson was constantly worried about the budget and repeatedly argued with Hellman over minuscule budgetary concerns. * Other cast: B.J. Merholz as Leland Drum, Charles Eastman as Bearded Man, Guy El Tsosie as Indian at Cross Tree, Brandon Carroll as Sheriff, Wally Moon as Deputy, William Mackleprang as Cross Tree Townsman, and James Campbell as Cross Tree Townsman Production In 1964, Monte Hellman and Jack Nicholson had made two films together, Back Door to Hell and Flight to Fury, which were produced by Roger Corman and filmed back-to-back in the Philippines. After completing the films, the director and actor wrote a screenplay called Epitaph and presented it to Corman to produce. Corman did not care for the script, but asked if the two would be willing to do a Western for him, instead. When they expressed an interest, Corman further suggested that they film two Westerns, in a manner similar to the Philippine-shot movies they had just finished. They agreed, and while Nicholson started working on the script for Ride in the Whirlwind, Hellman asked their mutual friend Carole Eastman to write The Shooting.Hellman, Monte. The Shooting DVD, VCI Video, 2000, audio commentary. According to Hellman, Eastman's script was used almost exactly as written, with no need for any rewrites. Hellman felt, though, that the first part of the script had too much expository material involving Gashade's trip through the desert as he returned to the mining camp, so Hellman simply deleted it, noting that \\"Exposition, by its very nature, is artificial.\\" After discarding the material, Hellman began shooting around \\"page 10\\" of the screenplay. He felt the story was \\"perfectly simple\\" and did not need any additional information to help the audience figure things out. Nonetheless, Corman insisted on Hellman inserting a certain amount of exposition that Corman hoped would help explain the story. Corman felt that if mention was made three times during the course of the film that Gashade had a brother, audiences would not be confused by the climactic sequence. Hellman reluctantly agreed. After briefly considering Sterling Hayden for Gashade, Hellman was shopping in a Los Angeles bookstore when he suddenly and simultaneously thought of Perkins, Warren Oates, and Will Hutchins for the main roles. Perkins was Hellman's next-door neighbor at the time, and she had known both Hellman and Nicholson for many years, having first met them while all of them were attending the same acting class.Perkins, Millie. The Shooting DVD, VCI Video, 2000, audio commentary. Hellman immediately telephoned Nicholson with his casting idea. Nicholson agreed that the three actors would be perfect. Hellman and Nicholson scouted locations for several weeks, and looked at such familiar locales as Monument Valley before deciding on Kanab, Utah. They chose that area because it offered them both the \\"box canyon\\" needed for Whirlwind and the \\"desolate desert\\" for The Shooting. Parts of the film were shot at Kanab Canyon, Calvin Johnson Ranch, and Glen Canyon in Utah. Corman financed the picture, serving as the film's uncredited executive producer. The budget was $75,000. Shooting began on April 15, 1965, with a production crew consisting of only seven individuals. During the first two days of the production, actual shooting was extremely limited due to near-constant rain, which caused severe flooding in the areas where they had planned to shoot. Hellman estimated that $5,000 of the already small budget was eaten up by the wasted time. Another $10,000 of the budget were for the horse wranglers' salaries, the only union element of the film, apart from the actors. Corman's deal with Hellman and Nicholson was that if the film went over budget, any additional costs would come out of their own pockets. Despite the initial problems, the film was completed for the original budget estimate. Because of the restrictively low budget, no light equipment was used during the shoot. Gregory Sandor shot the entire film in natural light. For the film's many tracking shots, Hellman estimated the crew had only been able to bring along about eight feet of dolly tracks. After The Shooting was completed, production immediately commenced on Hellman's Ride in the Whirlwind, a similarly mysterious Western that also featured Nicholson and Perkins in the cast.Monaco, James (editor). The Movie Guide, Perigee Books, 1992. Both films were completed in a total of six weeks of continuous shooting (three weeks per film).Peary, Danny. Cult Movies, Delta Books, 1981. Hellman reportedly spent over a year editing the films, then had them played at various film festivals throughout the world. In 1967, both films received excellent reviews at the Montreal World Film Festival, and were shown out-of- competition at the Cannes Film Festival. Release No U.S. distributor expressed any interest in either film. Nicholson sold the foreign rights to a French film producer, but the producer went bankrupt, and the prints of both films remained in bond at the Paris airport for almost two years. After \\"considerable legal maneuvering\\", Hellman and Nicholson were able to get the rights reverted to them. In 1968, Hellman managed to get both films theatrical showings in Paris, albeit without a distributor.Blasi, Ralph. \\"Vanishing Films\\" article in Show magazine, February 1970 issue, quoted in Cult Movies, Delta Books, 1981. According to Hellman, The Shooting was a sizeable arthouse hit and played for over a year in Paris. Also in 1968, the U.S. rights for both were sold to the Walter Reade Organization, a New York-based theatre chain that occasionally distributed films (they also handled the initial release of Night of the Living Dead). They decided to pass on a theatrical release. Instead, both films were sold directly to television. In 1971, theatrical rights to the film were obtained by Jack H. Harris Enterprises Inc., who purchased the rights based \\"on the strength of Jack Nicholson's new- found fame.\\"Stevens, Brad. Monte Hellman: His Life and Films, McFarland & Co., 2002. Reception As The Shooting was never released theatrically, and had sparse television showings, it initially had a very limited core of fans. Those critics who did manage to view the film were extremely enthusiastic, and generally found it superior to Hellman's companion Western, Ride in the Whirlwind. Danny Peary in Cult Movies (1981), after admitting that he had difficulties with the \\"puzzling\\" climax, noted, \\"But while the end may ask more questions than it answers, the exciting journey that brings us to this point is one of the most rewarding sequences in the history of Westerns.\\" Leonard Maltin said it was an \\"...ultimately powerful film with an offbeat performance by Nicholson as a hired gun... and an incredible, unexpected finale.\\"Maltin, Leonard. Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide 2007, Plume Paperbacks, 2006. David Pirie in Time Out wrote, \\"Probably the first Western which really deserves to be called existential... Hellman builds remorselessly on the atmosphere and implications of the 'quest' until it assumes a terrifying importance in itself... What Hellman has done is to take the basic tools of the Western, and use them, without in anyway diluting or destroying their power, as the basis for a Kafkaesque drama.\\" Phil Hardy's The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: The Western notes that \\"Hellman's calculated style, replete with disorientating close-ups and strange moments... confirm the detached fatalism of his story. This is a marvelous film.\\"Hardy, Phil (editor). The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: The Western, Aurum Press, 1983. James Monaco's The Movie Guide described the film as \\"[H]ighly effective, playing with various levels of character and ideas... it is a fine western stylization that should not be missed.\\" Jonathan Rosenbaum has referred to the film as the first acid Western, and cited it as an inspiration for Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 100% rating based on reviews from 16 critics.

It is also sold by Mondelƒìz International (formerly also Kraft Foods) as Miracel Whip throughout Germany. It was developed as a less expensive alternative to mayonnaise in 1933. History Premiering at the Century of Progress World's Fair in Chicago in 1933, Miracle Whip soon became a success as a condiment for fruits, vegetables, and salads. Its success was bolstered by Kraft's advertising campaign, which included sponsorship of a series of two-hour radio programs. At the end of its introductory period, Miracle Whip was outselling all mayonnaise brands. According to Kraft archivist Becky Haglund Tousey, Kraft developed the product in house, using a patented \\"emulsifying machine\\", invented by Charles Chapman, to create a product that blended mayonnaise and less expensive salad dressing, sometimes called \\"boiled dressing\\" and \\"salad dressing spread\\". The machine, dubbed \\"Miracle Whip\\" by Chapman, ensured that the ingredients, including more than 20 spices, were thoroughly blended. Another story claims that Miracle Whip was invented in Salem, Illinois, at Max Crosset's Cafe, where it was called \\"Max Crossett's X-tra Fine Salad Dressing\\", and that Crosset sold it to Kraft Foods in 1931 for $300. () While stating that Kraft did buy many salad dressings, Tousey disputes the claim that X-tra Fine was Miracle Whip. Since 1972, Miracle Whip has been sold as Miracel Whip in Germany. It was formerly produced by Kraft Foods, and is now made by Mondelƒìz International, in Bad Fallingbostel. Ingredients Miracle Whip spread on toast Miracle Whip is made from water, soybean oil, high- fructose corn syrup, vinegar, modified corn starch, eggs, salt, natural flavor, mustard flour, potassium sorbate, spice, and dried garlic. Advertising Six Flags announced a new partnership with the Miracle Whip brand in 2009. Kraft paid Lady Gaga to include Miracle Whip in the music video for her song \\"Telephone\\". Miracle Whip advertising features prominently in the Electronic Arts video game Skate 3, including a dedicated trick, contest, and an achievement called Don't Be So Mayo. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, Miracle Whip attempted more \\"hip\\" advertising (much of it explained above), with footage of teenagers having fun while an announcer berated mayonnaise. Criticism by Stephen Colbert led to Miracle Whip buying ad time on his show, The Colbert Report, and attacking Colbert for being a \\"mayo lover\\". This also included publishing an open letter stating the attack was \\"raising hell, man\\" (though the whole debacle may have been staged by Kraft and Comedy Central). Eventually, this advertising was dropped. In 2018, the town of Mayo, Florida temporarily changed its name to Miracle Whip as a promotional stunt.

Tule fog () is a thick ground fog that settles in the San Joaquin Valley and Sacramento Valley areas of California's Central Valley. Tule fog forms from late fall through early spring (California's rainy season) after the first significant rainfall. The official time frame for tule fog to form is from November 1 to March 31. This phenomenon is named after the tule grass wetlands (tulares) of the Central Valley. Tule fog is the leading cause of weather-related accidents in California. Formation Tule fog is a radiation fog, which condenses when there is a high relative humidity (typically after a heavy rain), calm winds, and rapid cooling during the night. The nights are longer in the winter months, which allows an extended period of ground cooling, and thereby a pronounced temperature inversion at a low altitude. In California, tule fog can extend from Bakersfield to Red Bluff, covering a distance of over . Tule fog occasionally drifts as far west as the San Francisco Bay Area via the Carquinez Strait, and can even drift westward out through the Golden Gate, opposite to the usual course of the coastal fog. Tule fog is characteristically confined mainly to the Central Valley due to the mountain ranges surrounding it. Because of the density of the cold air in the winter, winds are not able to dislodge the fog and the high pressure of the warmer air above the mountaintops presses down on the cold air trapped in the valley, resulting in a dense, immobile fog that can last for days or at times for weeks undisturbed. Tule fog often contains light drizzle or freezing drizzle where temperatures are sufficiently cold. Tule fog is a low cloud, usually below in altitude and can be seen from above by driving up into the foothills of the Sierra Nevada to the east or the Coast Ranges to the west. Above the cold, foggy layer, the air is typically mild, dry and clear. Once tule fog has formed, turbulent air is necessary to break through the temperature inversion layer. Daytime heating sometimes evaporates the fog in patches, although the air remains chilly and hazy below the inversion and fog reforms soon after sunset. Tule fog usually remains longer in the southern and eastern parts of the Central Valley, because winter storms with strong winds and turbulent air affect the northern Central Valley more often. Visibility Tule fog in Bakersfield Visibility in tule fog is usually less than an eighth of a mile (about 600 ft or 200 m). Visibility can vary rapidly; in only a few feet, visibility can go from to near zero. The variability in visibility is the cause of many chain-reaction pile-ups on roads and freeways. In one such accident on Interstate 5 near Elk Grove south of Sacramento, 25 cars and 12 big-rig trucks collided inside a fog bank in December 1997. Five people died and 28 were injured. In February 2002, two people were killed in an 80-plus- car pile-up on State Route 99 between Kingsburg and Selma. On the morning of November 3, 2007, heavy tule fog caused a massive pile-up that included 108 passenger vehicles and 18 big-rig trucks on northbound State Route 99 between Fowler and Fresno. Visibility was about at the time of the accident. There were two fatalities and 39 injuries in the crash.abc30.com: Highway 99 Back Open After Massive Pileup 11/03/07 Freezing drizzle and black ice Tule fog events are often accompanied by drizzle. Sunlight cannot penetrate the fog layer, keeping temperatures below freezing. Episodes of freezing drizzle occasionally accompany tule fog events during winter. Such events can leave an invisible glaze of black ice on roadways, making travel especially treacherous.

The movie stars Robert Walker Jr., Burl Ives, Walter Matthau and Tommy Sands and features Millie Perkins, Larry Hagman, Kay Medford, Peter Marshall, Jack Nicholson, Richard Gautier, George Lindsey, James Farentino and James Coco.Variety film review; February 26, 1964, page 6. The film was directed and co-written by Joshua Logan, who had directed and co- written the 1948 Mister Roberts stage play on Broadway,Steinberg, Jay S. \\"Ensign Pulver\\" (article) on TCM.com and also shot scenes for the 1955 film after director John Ford fell ill. The story concerns the U.S.S. Reluctant, which is at anchor beside a tropical island. The ship's captain is as much of a \\"Captain Bligh\\" as ever. Several of the film's events - such as attacking the Captain while he is watching a film, and one the sailors trying to obtain compassionate leave to deal with a dying child - are taken from Thomas Heggen's original 1946 novel Mister Roberts. The characters of Pulver, Doc and several crewmen return from the first film, but played by different actors.  Plot  U.S. Navy Ensign Frank Pulver (Robert Walker Jr.) feels unappreciated, as usual. Even when he personally aims a sharp object into the hindquarters of the hated Captain Morton (Burl Ives), the happy crew cannot imagine that the all-talk, no-action Pulver could be behind it. A poll to guess at the identity of the \\"ass-sassin\\" results in votes for almost everyone except Pulver, which he bitterly resents. Shipmates like Billings (Larry Hagman), Insigna (James Farentino), Skouras (James Coco) and Dolan (Jack Nicholson) don't take Pulver seriously while despising the captain, who refuses to grant leave to a seaman named Bruno (Tommy Sands) to attend his daughter's funeral back home. Doc (Walter Matthau) is the only one aboard who believes in Pulver's potential at all. At sea for months at a time, Pulver is unable to indulge his greatest interest, women, until a company of nurses land on a nearby atoll. The head nurse (Kay Medford) is pleased to meet him when Pulver introduces himself as a doctor serving on a destroyer, but young nurse Scotty (Millie Perkins) suspects the truth and a smitten Pulver confesses it to her, that he's no doctor and nothing more than a junior officer on \\"the worst ship in the Navy.\\" Bruno becomes so deranged, he attempts to kill the captain. Pulver reluctantly intervenes, but the captain falls overboard, and is about to drown until Pulver lowers a life raft and dives in to save him. Separated from their ship, with the crew unaware for hours that they are missing, Pulver and Morton bicker aboard the raft. The ensign takes notes while the delusional captain reveals dark secrets about his past. In need of emergency surgery, Morton ends up owing his life yet again to Pulver, who follows Doc's instructions over a radio and removes the captain's appendix. Back aboard ship, Morton's natural tendencies resurface and he tries to return to his martinet ways. Although Pulver has the goods on him now he shows genuine compassion for the captain and convinces him to leave the ship for his own well-being. Morton takes his advice and departs, turning over command to the popular LaSeur (Gerald S. O'Loughlin).

Onasakenrat (meaning Swan or White Feather) was born to a Mohawk family near Oka, Quebec. He was baptized Catholic and named Joseph, and was fluent in Mohawk and French. In 1860, he entered the Petit S√©minaire de Montr√©al where he studied for the priesthood for about four years. He returned to Oka and joined the local Sulpician seminary as secretary. On July 25, 1868, Onasakenrat was elected chief of the Mohawk community. Almost immediately, he travelled to Ottawa to meet with the Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Onasakenrat petitioned the government to return land to the Mohawks which was, at the time, held by the Sulpicians. The Mohawk had learned that the Sulpicians had changed the terms of an earlier land grant deed and, rather than holding the land in trust for the Mohawk, had taken control of it. They were already selling it off to settlers. Onasakenrat accused the seminary of exploiting the natives and of intentionally keeping them impoverished. The seminary threatened to excommunicate anyone involved in the petition, prompting Onasakenrat, along with most of the Mohawk community, to leave the Catholic Church that winter and convert to Methodism. On February 18, 1869, the chief confronted the Sulpicians again, challenging their authority over the land by cutting down a large elm tree without permission. One week later, backed by an armed band of forty men, Onasakenrat demanded that the Sulpicians leave Oka within eight days. The priests refused to leave, and instead obtained a warrant for his arrest. Montr√©al police arrived and arrested the group, although they were released a few days later. In 1877, Onasakenrat was charged after the Catholic Church in Oka was destroyed by fire in the early morning of June 14. At the time, the Mohawk were engaged in a dispute with white Canadian settlers over logging rights on their reserve. A group of Protestant Mohawks were accused of starting the fire. The group was tried quickly, and found not guilty by a jury. A devoutly religious man, Onasakenrat became an ordained Methodist minister in 1880, and worked to translate religious works into the Mohawk language. He translated the Gospels (1880) and several hymns. At the time of his sudden death in 1881, he was working on a translation of the remainder of the Bible, having completed up to the Epistle to the Hebrews. An oral account tells that the night before he died, he had attended a ball in Montreal hosted by the Sulpician order. When he returned home the next day, Sos√© had complained to his wife about feeling ill and died later that morning. A priest was said to come that morning with a horse and sleigh, and took the chief's remains back to Montreal with him. Many Kanehsat√†:kehro'non believe that the Sulpicians had poisoned and murdered Onasakenrat because of the political and religious influence he had over his people.

The film tells the story of a gas-station attendant with a bad attitude who finds life more exciting after he is allowed to hang out with a chapter of the Hells Angels outlaw motorcycle club. Plot The Angels first take note of \\"Poet\\" (Jack Nicholson) after one of them inadvertently damages his motorcycle and breaks its headlight. Poet, with far more guts than brains, challenges the Angel that hit his motorcycle. This is an act that would traditionally result in every Angel present participating in a group beating of the attacker. \\"When a non- Angel hits an Angel, all Angels retaliate.\\" But the leader of the Angels, Buddy (Adam Roarke), intervenes and tells Poet that the Angels will replace the headlight. In the meantime, he's welcome to ride with them while they take care of business‚Äîwhich turns out to be going to a bar and beating up the members of another club who previously beat an Angel. Poet is told to wait outside, but ends up helping the Angels. Later that night, the Angels return the favor by hunting down and beating four sailors who beat Poet four-against- one after he parted company with the group. Poet accidentally bumps into one of the sailors and speaks rudely to him before he realizes that the sailor has three other sailors with him. The four sailors then refuse to accept his apology‚Äîbut the Angels only know that four sailors beat up Poet, and he doesn't tell them how the earlier fight started. One of the sailors pulls a knife on the Angels and is then killed accidentally in the fight that follows. Poet is allowed to ride with the Angels and is eventually elevated to \\"prospect\\" status. He is attracted to Buddy's some-time girlfriend (Sabrina Scharf) who toys with him while remaining hopelessly committed to Buddy. Much of the story that follows consists of scenes of the Angels partying or being provoked to violence by \\"squares.\\" Although the Angels are shown as being loud and generally irreverent, they are never shown starting trouble except when taking revenge on members of other motorcycle clubs, except when they run an older man in a car off the road, to his death; when they run two cops off the road when freeing their friend, arrested for that death; or when they insist on entering a bar where they are not welcome, thereby instigating a fight with locals. Eventually, Buddy's girlfriend succeeds in provoking a confrontation between Buddy and Poet, with only one of the men surviving. Production notes Adam Roarke, who plays the Angels club president Buddy, starred in several other motorcycle films of the era. Ralph 'Sonny' Barger, the president of the Oakland, California chapter of the Hells Angels, is seen in an early scene but has no spoken lines in the film. He was also credited as a consultant. Jack Starrett appears as Sgt. Bingham. Sabrina Scharf later played the role of Sara in the film Easy Rider as one of the girls in the commune.

(2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. p. 436. .James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. p. 125. . This term applies when 90% or more of the skin is affected. In ICD-10, a distinction is made between \\"exfoliative dermatitis\\" at L26, and \\"erythroderma\\" at L53.9. Causes Erythroderma is generalized exfoliative dermatitis, which involves 90% or more of the patient's skin. The most common cause of erythroderma is exacerbation of an underlying skin disease, such as psoriasis, contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rubra pilaris or a drug reaction, such as the use of topical steroids. Primary erythroderma is less frequent and is usually seen in cases of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, in particular in S√©zary's disease. The most common causes of exfoliative dermatitis are best remembered by the mnemonic device ID-SCALP. The causes and their frequencies are as follows: * Idiopathic - 30% * Drug allergy - 28% * Seborrheic dermatitis - 2% * Contact dermatitis - 3% * Atopic dermatitis - 10% * Lymphoma and leukemia - 14% * Psoriasis - 8% Treatment The primary cause has to be treated, or the exacerbation may persist and relapse. Topical steroids are the primary category of medications used to treat exfoliative dermatitis. A sedative antihistamine may be a useful adjunct for pruritic patients, since it helps patients to sleep at night, thus limiting nocturnal scratching and excoriations. Antimicrobial agents often are used if an infection is suspected to be precipitating or complicating exfoliative dermatitis. Other drugs specifically indicated for management of underlying cause of exfoliative dermatitis may be necessary. Epidemiology The incidence of erythroderma is estimated to be 1-2 in 100,000. While erythroderma can occur at any age, it is most common in older, male adults. History The classification of exfoliative dermatitis into Wilson-Brocq (chronic relapsing), Hebra or pityriasis rubra (progressive), and Savill (self-limited) types may have had historical value, but it currently lacks pathophysiologic or clinical utility.

CIRC.848-1956. Art needlework was a type of surface embroidery popular in the later nineteenth century under the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites and the Arts and Crafts Movement. Artist and designer William Morris is credited with the resurrection of the techniques of freehand surface embroidery based on English embroidery styles of the Middle Ages through the eighteenth century, developing the retro-style which would be termed art needlework. Art needlework emphasized delicate shading in satin stitch with silk thread accompanied by a number of novelty stitches, in sharp contrast with the counted-thread technique of the brightly colored Berlin wool work needlepoint craze of the mid-nineteenth century. Detail of an art needlework panel in wool on linen, designed by William Morris in 1877\\"Artichoke\\" hanging designed by William Morris for Ada Phoebe Godman in 1877 and subsequently available from Morris and Company. Linda Parry, William Morris Textiles, New York, Viking Press, 1983, p. 20-21 In embroidery as in other crafts, Morris was anxious to encourage self-expression via handcrafts. His shop Morris & Co. sold both finished custom embroideries and kits in the new style, along with vegetable dyed silks in which to work them. Art needlework was considered an appropriate style for decorating artistic dress. The Royal School of Art Needlework (now Royal School of Needlework) was founded as a charity in 1872 under the patronage of Princess Helena to provide apprenticeships in the new/old style. Morris's daughter May, an accomplished needlewoman and designer in her own right, was active in the School from its inception. The Leek Embroidery Society and the Leek School of Art Embroidery, both founded by embroideress Elizabeth Wardle, were established in 1879 and around 1881, respectively. Art needlework was introduced to America at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia.

The ethylenediamine improves solubility, and the aminophylline is usually found as a dihydrate. Aminophylline is less potent and shorter-acting than theophylline. Its most common use is in the treatment of airway obstruction from asthma or COPD. Aminophylline is a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist and phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Medical uses Intravenous aminophylline can be used for acute exacerbation of symptoms and reversible airway obstruction in asthma and other chronic lung disease such as COPD, emphysema and chronic bronchitis. It is used as an adjunct to inhaled beta-2 selective agonists and systemically administered corticosteroids. Aminophylline is used to reverse regadenoson, dipyridamole or adenosine based infusions during nuclear cardiology stress testing. Aminophylline has also been reported to be effective in preventing slow heart rates during complex cardiovascular interventions [Atherectomy of the right coronary artery]. It is also used in the treatment of heart block due to acute inferior myocardial infarction. Aminophylline has shown some promise as a bodyfat reducer when used as a topical cream. Aminophylline is also a treatment option for anaphylactic shock.Blackbourne LH. Surgical Recall. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, 2009. pp169 While it has been suggested for use in cardiac arrest evidence does not support a benefit. Side effects Aminophylline can lead to theophylline toxicity. Aminophylline has been found to decrease the sedative effects of propofol and decrease topiramate antiseizure action. Properties It is more soluble in water than theophylline. White or slightly yellowish granules or powder, having a slight ammoniacal odor and a bitter taste. Upon exposure to air, it gradually loses ethylenediamine and absorbs carbon dioxide with the liberation of free theophylline. Its solutions are alkaline. 1 g dissolves in 25 mL of water to give a clear solution; 1 g dissolved in 5 mL of water crystallizes upon standing, but redissolves when a small amount of ethylenediamine is added. Insoluble in alcohol and in ether. Pharmacology Like other methylated xanthine derivatives, aminophylline is both a # competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor which raises intracellular cAMP, activates PKA, inhibits TNF-alpha and leukotriene synthesis, and reduces inflammation and innate immunity and # nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist. Aminophylline causes bronchodilation, diuresis‚Ä†, central nervous system and cardiac stimulation, and gastric acid secretion by blocking phosphodiesterase which increases tissue concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) which in turn promotes catecholamine stimulation of lipolysis, glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis, and induces release of epinephrine from adrenal medulla cells. ‚Ä†Note that diuresis is caused by an increase in cAMP which acts in the CNS to inhibit the release of antidiuretic hormone (arginine-vasopressin). Adenosine is an endogenous extracellular messenger that can regulate myocardial oxygen needs. It acts through cellular surface receptors which effect intracellular signalling pathways to increase coronary artery blood flow, slow heart rate, block atrioventricular node conduction, suppress cardiac automaticity, and decrease Œ≤-adrenergic effects on contractility. Adenosine also antagonizes chronotropic and ionotropic effects of circulating catecholamines. Overall, adenosine decreases the heart‚Äôs rate and force of contraction, which increases blood supply to the cardiac muscle. Given specific circumstances this mechanism (which is intended to protect the heart) may cause atropine- resistant refractory bradyasystole. Adenosine's effects are concentration- dependent. Adenosine‚Äôs receptors are competitively antagonized by methylxanthines such as aminophylline. Aminophylline competitively antagonizes the cardiac actions of adenosine at the cell surface receptors. Thus, it increases heart rate and contractility.

The original Sundara Kanda is in Sanskrit and was composed by Valmiki, who was the first to scripturally record the Ramayana. Sundara Kanda is the only chapter of the Ramayana in which the hero is not Rama, but rather Hanuman. The work depicts the adventures of Hanuman and his selflessness, strength, and devotion to Rama are emphasized in the text. Hanuman was fondly called ‚ÄúSundara‚Äù by his mother Anjani and Sage Valmiki chose this name over others as the Sundara Kanda is about Hanuman's journey to Lanka. Summary left The Sundara Kanda forms the heart of Valmiki's Ramayana and consists of a detailed, vivid account of Hanuman's adventures. After learning about Sita, Hanuman assumes a gargantuan form and makes a colossal leap across the ocean to Lanka after defeating Surasa, the Mother of the Nagas and Sinhika, who is sent by the Devtas. In Lanka, Hanuman searched for Sita and finally found her in Ashok Vatika. In the Ashok Vatika, Sita is wooed and threatened by Ravana and his demon mistresses to marry Ravana. Hanuman reassures her, giving Rama's signet ring as a sign of good faith. He offers to carry Sita back to Rama; however, she refuses, reluctant to allow herself to be rescued by any one other than her husband. She says that Rama himself must come and avenge the insult of her abduction. Hanuman then wreaks havoc in Lanka by destroying trees and buildings, and killing Ravana's warriors. He allows himself to be captured and produced before Ravana. He gives a bold lecture to Ravana to release Sita. He is condemned and his tail is set on fire, but he escapes his bonds and, leaping from roof to roof, sets fire to Ravana's citadel and makes the giant leap back from the island. The joyous search party returns to Kishkindha with the news. The act of reading It is traditional to begin the reading () of the Ramayana with the Sundara Kanda. This lesson is recited by religious Hindus, preferably on Tuesdays or Saturdays, these days having been earmarked for special prayers to Hanuman. It happens to be for nullification of the malefic effects of the crow mounted, the son of Surya and Chhaya (Shadow), Lord Shani. Ramayana reveals that Shani Dev, who was captive at Ravana's palace, was rescued by Lord Hanuman. As a token of thanks, Shani Dev offered reprieve to all devotees of Lord Hanuman. Alternately once Shani Dev was caught between Hanuman's shoulders and the ceiling when attempting to mount the latter to influence his stars. Unable to bear the pain, Shani Dev offered gratitude in return to an immediate release. The religious faith suggests that its recital brings harmony to the household. Many Hindus believe that if one does not have time to read the whole Ramayana, one should read the Sundara Kanda. Other versions Multiple variations of the Sundara Kanda exist in other languages as well, for instance in Awadhi, the language in which the saint Tulsidas wrote the Ramacharitamanas. The Sri Ramacharitamanas was written much later than Valmiki's Ramayana, in the 16th century. An earlier Tamil version, Ramavataram, by Kambar is also a prevalent text among the Sri Vaishnava and Smartha Brahmins in South India. Ranganatha Ramayanam a Telugu version of valmiki Ramayan written by Gona Budha Reddy also described very well. M. S. Ramarao wrote Telugu version for Hanuman Chalisa of Tulsidas and Sundara kanda of Valmiki Ramayana as 'Sundarakandamu' in Telugu during 1972-74. He sang Sundarakanda in the form of Telugu songs. A Malayalam independent translation of Sundara Kandam can be found in 'Adhyatma Ramayanam Kilipattu', written by Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan. Ezhuthachan, who is considered as the Father of Modern Malayalam language, had written the translation of the Adhyatma Ramayana, a Sanskrit text connected with the Ramanandi sect. Hanuman Chalisa is a different poetic contribution towards the heroics of Hanuman by the poet, Tulasidas. Though it mentions his achievements during Ramayana, it goes beyond that as well, encompassing the complete life of Hanuman.

He contributed significantly to the development of aircraft propellers. He was the first civilian chair of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, the forerunner of NASA. A native of Connecticut, he was a member of the first graduating class of Birmingham High School in Derby, Connecticut (now Derby High School) in 1877. He graduated second in his class at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis and received his Ph.D. from Lafayette College. He went on to teach at the Michigan State College, Cornell University and Stanford University, teaching that school's first course in Aeronautics, the second offered by any school in the country (the first was offered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology). He helped rebuild Stanford after the 1906 earthquake, and the department of Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering building bears his name. A memorial there reads: \\"His first professional assignment in 1880 was on the USS Tennessee, a full rigged wooden ship with auxiliary steam power. His last, 1942-46 was as chairman of the National Aeronautical Commission for the development of jet propulsion for aircraft.\\" He died in 1958 at the age of 99. Biography=Early life= William Frederick Durand was born on March 5, 1859 in Beacon Falls, Connecticut. He was the fourth and youngest child and second son to William Leavenworth Durand and Ruth n√©e Coe. When Durand was one year old his family moved to Derby, Connecticut. During high school Durand showed an aptitude towards mathematics, and took extra curricular studies from the principal in analytic geometry and worked as a surveyor's assistant. Durand's brother strongly recommended that he take engineering at the United States Naval Academy. The Academy's entrance exams at the time tested for familiarization with machine tools, so Durand dropped attendance in the spring semester of high school in 1876 to work in the tool room of a factory in Ansonia, Connecticut. Durand was one of five to graduate from the first high school graduating class. To further prepare for the Navy Academy entrance exams, Durand attended a summer course at the Maryland Agricultural College taught by a retired American Civil War naval veteran. Travelling to Maryland for the classes, Durand stopped at the Centennial Exposition where the Corliss steam engine made a lifelong impression. =Naval career= In 1876 Durand was one of 80 applicants testing for 25 openings at the academy. His first examination was in elementary mechanics, presided over by A. A. Michelson. Durand placed tenth in the exams and was admitted into the academy. During summers Durand cruised on board . At the time graduates of the U. S. Naval Academy did not receive commission upon graduation but were required to serve two years of sea duty before being eligible. Durand graduated in 1880 from the academy with the rank of cadet engineer and was assigned to , flagship of the North Atlantic Squadron. Also assigned to Tennessee was Durand's classmate Midshipman W. S. Sims. After two years at sea Durand was given a week-long oral exam by the Naval Examining Board. Durand passed the exam and was commissioned as Assistant Engineer. Tennessee at Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1875. Durand continued to serve on Tennessee until June 1883, when he was transferred to the Bureau of Steam Engineering. There Durand was assigned to work on the design of the engines for . While there an Act of Congress titled \\"To Promote a Knowledge of Steam Engineering and Iron Shipbuilding Act\\" provided officers of the Engineer Corps of the Navy as instructors to scientific and technical institutions in the United States. Durand requested a tour of duty at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. While there Durand married Charlotte Kneen on October 23, 1883, and had a son on June 14, 1885. Durand earned a Ph.D. in engineering from Lafayette while there. In autumn 1885 Durand was transferred to the Morgan Iron Works as an inspector on the engines for and . In November 1885 Durand received a telegram ordering him to the Brooklyn Navy Yard to participate in sea trials of . The recently completed Dolphin had received an adverse report from the Board of Inspection and Survey. Among the findings was a claim of structural weakness. Captain R. W. Meade suggested to Secretary of Navy William C. Whitney that he take Dolphin to sea in search of a storm. Dolphin was outfitted at Newport, Rhode Island, and in late November the ship sailed for Cape Hatteras, where a storm of strong wind and heavy seas was known to be. The test plan consisted of: two hours of steaming under full power directly into the storm, two hours steaming with the wind 45 degrees off the bow, two hours with the wind amidships, two hours off the quarter, and two hours with the storm astern. Dolphin passed the storm test and sailed to the Norfolk Navy Yard. Durand requested and received duty as a naval engineering instructor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, arriving in March 1887. =Honors= * Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society (1918) * Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1921) * LL.D.

Michigan State was looking for someone to create and head a mechanical engineering program. Durand accepted the position and resigned his commission with the US Navy effective 15 September 1887. Durand worked at Michigan State in Lansing, Michigan, for four years, creating the Department of Mechanical Engineering. In late Spring 1891 Durand accepted the chair of mechanical engineering at Purdue University in Lafayette, Indiana. Later in the summer Durand learned that Robert H. Thurston, Director of Sibley College at Cornell University, was looking for someone to lead a planned post-graduate school of the College in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering. Thurston agreed to hire Durand, and the administrators at Purdue agreed to let him go if he could find a suitable replacement for Purdue. Professor John Joseph Flather of the University of Minnesota accepted the position at Purdue, and Durand went to Cornell. Shortly after arriving Durand became the secretary of the Sibley faculty. In 1892 Durand was elected a member of Sigma Xi, an engineering honors fraternity that started at Cornell in 1886. Durand would later become National President of the Society in 1936. = Logarithm paper, radial planimeter, and marine propeller research = Three accomplishments Durand thought noteworthy during his years at Cornell were the development of logarithmic paper, developing theoretically and mechanically an averaging radial planimeter, and research on marine propellers. In 1893 Durand developed and introduced Logarithmic graph paper, where the logarithmic scale is marked off in distances proportional to the logarithms of the values being represented. Keuffel and Esser Company listed logarithmic paper in their general catalog as \\"Durand's Logarithmic Paper\\" as late as 1936. In 1893 Durand published a paper mathematically describing a radial planimeter for averaging values plotted in polar coordinates. Originally a radial planimeter was of academic interest only, but ten years later clock driven recording instruments started being used. Durand created working device based on his theory. He patented the device and received royalties from a scientific instrument company making the devices until the patent expired. Durand conducted research on the theory of operation of marine screw propellers while at Cornell. Using funding from the Carnegie Institute, a concrete canal was built in the Hydraulic Laboratory for the study of propellers. Approximately forty-nine twelve inch diameter model propellers with varying pitch and proportion were tested over the course of several years. On October 25, 1903 Robert Thurston died and Durand became acting Director of Sibley College while Cornell searched for a permanent replacement. When A. W. Smith of Stanford University became Director David Starr Jordan, president of Stanford, offered Durand a position at Stanford to replace the vacancy created by the leaving of Smith. Durand accepted the offer and moved to Stanford in August 1904. =Stanford (1904‚Äì1917)= A statue of geologist Louis Agassiz was toppled from a Stanford University facade. Durand was the director of the mechanical engineering department and acting director of the electrical engineering department. Durand recruited H. J. Ryan from Cornell to be director of electrical engineering, a position Ryan held from 1905 until his death in 1934. At 5:20 AM on April 20, 1906 Durand was awakened by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. A marble statue of Louis Agassiz fell headfirst, piercing the concrete sidewalk. University president Jordan commented \\"Agassiz was always a hard-headed scientist.\\" Durand was appointed to a Board of Engineers tasked with clearing the ruins and making temporary repairs allowing the university to reopen in the fall. Stanford reopened in September for fall semester, and reconstruction was not completed until 1908. In 1912 Durand chaired the Committee of Management in preparation for the Engineering Congress held in conjunction with the 1915 Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition. George Washington Goethals was Honorary President of the Congress. Afterwards Durand compiled and edited the papers read before the congress into 18 volumes, mailing them to subscribers. =The NACA= The first meeting of the NACA in 1915. Durand is seated far left In 1914 Durand attended a conference convened by Charles Doolittle Walcott, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC for the purpose of stimulating interest in aeronautic science, and its relation to the U. S. government. The conference led to an act of congress organizing an Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (later the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) \\"to supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution.\\" This committee was composed of twelve members, two each from the Army and Navy, one each representing the Smithsonian Institution, the Weather Bureau, and the National Bureau of Standards. Five additional members were chosen \\"who shall be acquainted with the needs of aeronautical science, either civil or military, or skilled in aeronautical engineering or its allied sciences.\\" Brigadier General George P. Scriven, Chief Signal Officer of the Army, was chairman of the committee, Walcott was elected chairman of the Executive Committee. President Woodrow Wilson appointed Durand as one of the civilian members of the Committee. Durand became Chairman of the NACA in the fall of 1916 at the second meeting of the full committee. Durand proposed to the NACA the need for research on aircraft propellers, modeled on the work he had done on marine propellers at Cornell. The Committee agreed and Stanford University was contracted to perform the testing. Working with Professor E. P. Lesley, Durand conducted the air propeller research for the following twelve or fifteen years. Test results were published to the Committee and annually in reports. =World War I= The United States declared war on Germany in April, 1917. Durand obtained a leave of absence from Stanford to devote working full-time at the NACA. The United States concentrated on developing training, reconnaissance, and bomber airplanes while relying on the British and French for fighters. The NACA directed the development of the Liberty aeronautical engine. An impediment early in the war to rapidly improving aircraft were concerns about aircraft patents. To address this a conference of the leaders of the aircraft industry was convened. After several sessions a cross-license agreement was arranged calling for the common use of all important aircraft patents for the duration of the war. Durand worked to create aviation ground schools at between six and ten universities for the creation of aviation ground schools. The ground school curricula included aircraft control, flight theory, science, and meteorology. Durand first flew in an airplane in 1917. That year the Italian government was showcasing a large triplane built in the city of Genoa to U. S. Government officials hoping for sales. A party of four or five officials took a trip from Langley Field to Washington D.C., a distance of 120 miles, lasting over an hour. In 1917 Durand, metallurgist Dr. Henry M. Howe, and Dr. John J. Carty, Chief Engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company were elected to the National Academy of Sciences to form the nucleus of an engineering section of the academy. In autumn of 1917 Durand initiated the development of the airplane turbosuperchargers. The NACA had received incomplete reports that a French engineer named Auguste Rateau was attempting to develop engines for high altitudes using a turbo-driven air compressor. Remembering a graduate student named Sanford A. Moss who worked on gas driven turbo engines twenty years earlier at Cornell before starting a career at the gas turbine division of General Electric, Durand wrote to the president of GE, Mr. E. W. Rice requesting Dr. Moss' services. After this turbochargers became Moss' life work. On May 11, 1918 President Woodrow Wilson signed an Executive Order creating the National Research Council, the working arm of the National Academy of Sciences. Durand was appointed head of the Engineering Division. Both the NACA and the NRC had offices in the Munsey Trust Building in Washington separated by two floors. Durand climbed stairs or rode the elevator several times a day between the two. In December 1917 Durand, accompanied by his chief assistant Karl T. Compton and two others, traveled to Paris maintain continuous and close contact with developments in the applications of science in warfare. Upon arriving Durand was given the title Scientific Attach√© to the U. S. Embassy, though he worked independently of Ambassador William Graves Sharp. He did take advantage of the embassy's diplomatic bag to send reports back to Washington. In March 1918 Durand experienced the shelling of Paris by the German Paris gun. After an early morning air raid alarm was sounded Durand walked to the Place de la Concorde to witness the raid. Upon arriving at the obelisk he heard an explosion but was unable to see any airplanes. While searching the sky another explosion occurred. The bombardment continued throughout the day, with a shell landing every 15 to 20 minutes. One landed quite close to Durand, hitting the Tuileries Garden. In June 1918 Durand traveled from Paris to London to give the annual Wilbur & Orville Wright Named Lecture of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Before an audience of 2000 people Durand give a lecture addressing the problems of aircraft design, construction and operation as factors in a war effort. On the occasion of his talk Durand was elected a Fellow of the society. With the Armistice World War I ended on November 11, 1918. Durand returned to Stanford on February 22, 1919 and resumed teaching. =Retirement from Stanford, ASME, Bureau of Standards, U.S. Naval Academy = In 1924 Durand reached Stanford's mandatory retirement age of 65 and became Professor Emeritus. Durand continued testing model aircraft propellers, research that had begun under the NACA in 1915. In fall 1924 Durand was elected to a one-year term as President of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers for 1925-26. Durand had been a continuous member of the society since joining while serving on board the USS Tennessee in 1883. To be near the society headquarters, Durand lived in Brooklyn, New York during his term in office. On September 10, 1924 Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover asked Durand to become a member of the Board of Visitors of the Bureau of Standards. The board visited the Bureau several times over the course of a year to confer and advise the Director and be a conduit between the Bureau and outside entities. Durand was a member of the board for several years. In spring of 1925 Durand was appointed by President Calvin Coolidge to the Board of Visitors of the United States Naval Academy. The board visits the academy to attend classes, attend classes, observe drills and exercises and observe the overall performance of the institution. =Morrow Board= On September 3, 1925, the US Navy dirigible USS Shenandoah crashed in southeastern Ohio. US Army general Billy Mitchell accused the War and Navy Departments of causing the accident through \\"criminal negligence.\\" The army brought court-martial charges against Mitchell. Due to public pressure President Coolidge created a Board of Aeronautic Inquiry chaired by Dwight Morrow. On September 11, 1925 Durand learned over the radio that Coolidge had appointed him to the board. The board was tasked to study aeronautics in relation to national defense and advise the president on policy to develop aircraft in time of war. The board was composed of Morrow as chairman, U. S. Judge Arthur C. Denison as vice chairman, Durand as secretary, Hiram Bingham, James S. Parker, Carl Vinson, Maj. Gen. James G. Harbord (ret.), Rear Admiral Frank F. Fletcher (ret.), and Howard E. Coffin. The first meeting of the board was held at the White House where Durand was chosen to be secretary of the board. After weeks of meetings receiving expert testimony and conferring the board submitted a report to the President recommending a near term development plan for military and naval aircraft. The report further recommended the creation of the offices of Assistant Secretary for Military and for Naval aircraft within the War and Navy Departments. =Guggenheim Fund= In 1926 or 1927 Durand was invited by Daniel Guggenheim to join the Board of Trustees of the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics. The board asked Durand to make recommendations on the proposal of creating an encyclopedia of aeronautics. Durand determined quickly that the overall field of aeronautics was still developing very rapidly and an encyclopedic overview would rapidly become obsolete. He recommended instead that fluid mechanics theory and its application to aeronautics was mature and stable enough for an encyclopedia. The board agreed, tasking Durand to direct and supervise the effort. Durand worked on the encyclopedia full-time for the next six years. He sailed to Europe and met Theodore von K√°rm√°n of Aachen University to find the best qualified authors. Twenty five authors wrote twenty divisions in six volumes for a total of 2200 pages. No American publisher was willing to print the encyclopedia due to concern of the number of potential sales. Springer & Co. of Berlin agreed to publish the volumes in English.W.F. Durand, editor (1934) Aerodynamic Theory: A General Review of Progress including Mathematical Aids, Fluid Mechanics I & Fluid Mechanics II by Max M. Monk, and Historical Sketch by R. Giacomelli and E. Pistolesi, via Google Books The final volume was published in 1936. During World War II there was renewed demand for the encyclopedia and a second printing was made by photo-offset printing at the California Institute of Technology. =Propeller research= In 1926 Durand and E. P. Leslie reported on comparisons of propeller efficiency in a wind tunnel versus free flight.W .F. Durand & E. P. Leslie (1926) Comparison of tests on air propellers in flight with wind tunnel model tests on similar forms, National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics # 220 Leslie tested seven propellers with a VE-7. Durand's wind tunnel model showed similar efficiency to Leslie's measurements, but lagged by 6% to 10% in thrust developed and power absorbed. =Colorado River, Special Committee on Airships, = In 1927 Durand became a member of a board of advisers to the Secretary of Work of the United States Department of the Interior. The board was tasked to survey the Colorado River to find solutions to annual flooding, silting, the development of hydroelectric power, and water usage for irrigation and by cities such as Los Angeles, California. On 12 February 1935 The US Navy rigid airship USS Macon crashed in a storm off Point Sur, California. Investigations were conducted by a Naval Board of Inquiry and a scientific review board. Science Advisory Board Chairman Karl T. Compton appointed a Special Committee on Airships at the request of Secretary of the Navy Claude Swanson. Members of the committee were Robert A. Millikan and Theodore von K√°rm√°n of Caltech, William Hovgaard of M.I.T., Durand and Stephen Timoshenko of Stanford, Frank B. Jewett of Bell Telephone Laboratories, and Charles F. Kettering of General Motors. Durand was the chairman. =Ship stabilization= Upon request of the United States Department of the Navy, the National Academy of Sciences established a committee chaired by Durand to investigate anti-rolling devices on ships. The ability to stabilize a ship such as an aircraft carrier would be extremely useful during the landing of airplanes. The committee established an experimental laboratory at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Dr. Nicolas Minorsky worked on roll stabilization of ships for the navy from 1934 to 1940, designing in 1938 an activated-tank stabilization system into a 5-ton model ship. A full- scale version of the system was tested in but exhibited control stability problems. Very promising results were beginning to appear when the outbreak of the Second World War interrupted further development as the Hamilton was called to active duty and the 5 ton model was put into storage. =World War II= In March 1941 Chairman of the NACA Vannevar Bush asked the then 82-year- old Durand to head a committee to study and develop jet propulsion for aircraft. The committee was composed of members from General Electric, Westinghouse, and Allis-Chalmers. The committee agreed early that the three companies would work separately developing jet engines to promote diversity in design. Chief of the Air Corp Henry H. Arnold obtained a Whittle jet engine from England which was turned over to the gas turbine division of GE in Lynn, Massachusetts for test and copy. General Electric developed this into the J31. Durand witnessed a static test of the engine in Lynn, Massachusetts on July 13, 1942 alongside Sanford A. Moss, the engineer Durand had requested from General Electric for the development of turbosuperchargers during World War I. Moss had retired from GE but worked as a consultant on the jet engine. Durand and Moss spoke to each other of the early development of the turbosupercharger as the manager of the facility recorded their conversation. On October 2, 1941 Durand witnessed the first official flight of the J31 equipped Bell P-59 Airacomet at Muroc Army Air Field (today, Edwards Air Force Base). Westinghouse developed the J30 engine from this effort. Durand led the jet engine effort from April 2, 1941 to July 7, 1945, at which time Durand was 86 years old Also beginning in early spring 1941 Durand chaired the Engineering Division of the National Research Council. Durand split his work days, mornings at the NACA, afternoons at the NRC. Durand was greatly helped by the NRC Division Executive Secretary William H. Kenerson of Brown University.

The screenplay by Adrien Joyce focuses on two bumbling con men who plot to steal the fortune of a wealthy young heiress, played by Stockard Channing in her first film starring role. Plot Nicky Wilson (Beatty) and Oscar Sullivan (Nicholson) are inept 1920s scam artists in Northeastern United States who see pay dirt in the guise of Fredericka Quintessa \\"Freddie\\" Bigard (Stockard Channing), the millionaire heiress to a sanitary napkin fortune. She loves the already married Nicky, but because the Mann Act prohibits him from taking her across state lines and engaging in immoral relations, he proposes that she marry Oscar and then carry on an affair with the man she wants. Oscar, who is wanted for embezzlement and anxious to get out of town, is happy to comply with the plan, although he intends to claim his spousal privileges after they are wed. Once they reach Los Angeles, the men try everything they can to separate Freddie from her inheritance without success, but with sufficient determination to arouse her suspicions. When she announces her plan to donate her money to charity, Nicky and Oscar conclude that murder might be their only recourse if they're going to get rich quick. Eventually arrested for the murder, Nicky and Oscar confess everything to the Los Angeles Police Department. This leads to unusual complications when the arresting detective meets the very-alive Freddie, who passed out and was oblivious to the entire \\"murder\\", and is shocked to hear the story. CastProduction When Warren Beatty was unable to stir interest in his and Robert Towne's screenplay for Shampoo about a befuddled but seductive hairdresser, which he had been developing since 1967, he bundled it with the more appealing The Fortune and convinced Columbia Pictures head David Begelman to finance both films. The fact that Carole Eastman, writing under the pen name Adrien Joyce, had yet to complete her 240-page script fazed Beatty less than it did director Mike Nichols, who needed a box-office hit after Catch-22 and The Day of the Dolphin, both of which were critical and commercial flops. The working relation between the screenwriter and director was amiable until Eastman objected to the many cuts Nichols was making to the script and his determination to make it less satirical and more slapstick, and she was fired from the production.Turner Classic Movies Nichols wanted Bette Midler to portray Freddie, but he changed his mind when, seemingly unaware of his career, Midler insulted him by asking what films he previously made. He ultimately cast relative newcomer Stockard Channing, whose credits were limited to a few television appearances and a minor role in the Barbra Streisand film Up the Sandbox. Because the start of principal photography on One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was delayed, Jack Nicholson, who had worked with Nichols on Carnal Knowledge, was available for the role of Oscar Sullivan. During filming, the actor was forced to deal with two events that impacted his personal life. First, a fact checker working on a biographical piece for Time discovered that the woman Nicholson believed was his sister was actually his mother, and the woman who raised him was his grandmother. Then his close friend Cass Elliot died in her sleep, and rumors about the cause of her death circulated in the media. These two events, linked with the film's eventual failure, made The Fortune a subject that Nicholson never discussed in interviews and biographies. The film was shot on location in Albuquerque, New Mexico and on a segment of street constructed in the corner of the former RKO Forty Acres back lot where the \\"Stalag 13\\" sets for TV's Hogan's Heroes were located. The apartment building was a The Day of the Locust set. Nichols did not direct another film for seven years. Reception=Critical reception= Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film \\"very funny,\\" \\"manically scatterbrained,\\" and \\"a marvelous attempt to recreate a kind of farce that, with the notable exceptions of a handful of films by Blake Edwards and Billy Wilder, disappeared after World War II.\\" He added \\"The Fortune does have sequences that sag, and there are moments when it's obvious that farce is not exactly the native art of any of the people involved. One occasionally is aware of the tremendous effort that has gone into a particular effect, though that doesn't spoil it for me. The endeavor is nobly conceived in an era that has just about abandoned farce in favor of parody, satire, situation and/or wise-crack comedy, all of which Mr. Nichols already can do with ‚Äì perhaps ‚Äì too great an ease. The Fortune will probably be compared to The Sting, because of the overlapping of the eras and the con-man theme. Incorrectly, though. The Sting is an adventure. The Fortune is farce of a rare order.\\"New York Times review Time Out London stated it \\"starts promisingly as a sardonic comedy...but once in California lethargy settles in. The film becomes almost static, a series of stagy, glossy tableaux: such lack of momentum may be an adequate assessment of the characters' limited capacity for development, but it has a disastrous effect on the film's pacing. Events degenerate into miscalculated farce and underline Nichols' continuing slick superficiality. Adrien Joyce's much hacked-about script sounds as though it was once excellent: a pity everyone treats it so off-handedly.\\"Time Out London review Channel 4 called it a \\"flat-footed attempt to revive the 1930s screwball comedy\\" but liked the leads, commenting \\"The trio's timing and delivery almost rescue the movie from degenerating into bad farce.\\"Channel 4 review TV Guide rated it four stars, calling it \\"an offbeat but often hilarious comedy\\" and adding, the film \\"works well through the fine performances of the leads and the superb timing of director Nichols.\\" It concluded, \\"Full of period and period-sounding music, The Fortune is cold to the core ‚Äì agreeably disagreeable amusement.\\"TV Guide review =Awards= Stockard Channing was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year ‚Äì Actress.

Overview and history Junius Heights was built at what was the eastern edge of the city of Dallas in the late 1910s and construction continued into the 1930s. Most of the houses are Craftsman and Prairie style bungalows with a smattering of other styles. The neighborhood was served by the Junius Heights streetcar line until streetcar service was discontinued in Dallas. The neighborhood was cut in two in the early 1970s when Abrams Road was extended from Junius St. to connect with Columbia Ave. The landmark Junius Heights columns were moved at the same time. The original plan called for them to be demolished but a neighborhood effort resulted in them being moved instead. In 2006 the community became known as a historic district. Junius Heights has an active neighborhood association. For more information you can visit the official site: Junius Heights Neighborhood In 2010 Junius Heights was named \\"Best Place for Families\\" during its listing on This Old House's \\"Best Old House Neighborhoods 2010\\".http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/photos/0,,20343206_20738689,00.html Composition Most residences are single family houses with most constructed in the period 1906-1940. In 2011 some houses were recently constructed. In 2011 Dawn McMullan of D Magazine wrote that the \\"city within a city\\" vibe in East Dallas is \\"even more so in Junius Heights because of its proximity to restaurants and retail.\\" Demographics it had about 700 families. Landmarks Landmarks in and near Junius Heights include: ‚Ä¢ the Lakewood Theater and Lakewood shopping center outside the northern tip of the neighborhood ‚Ä¢ the Lakewood branch of the Dallas Public Library at Abrams Rd. and Worth St., adjacent to the district ‚Ä¢ Woodrow Wilson High School (Official Dallas Landmark, State of Texas Historical Marker, recognition by the National Trust for Historic Preservation) at Columbia Ave. and Glasgow St., near the district ‚Ä¢ J.L. Long Middle School on the Woodrow Campus (City of Dallas Landmark) ‚Ä¢ Lipscomb Elementary School at Worth and Lowell Sts. ‚Ä¢ Junius Heights Baptist Church at Reiger Ave. and Augusta St. ‚Ä¢ St. John Methodist Church at Beacon and Columbia Aves. ‚Ä¢ Juliette Fowler Communities at Abrams Rd. and Reiger Avenue, and ‚Ä¢ a small commercial center at Junius St. and Henderson Ave. Education The neighborhood is served by the Dallas Independent School District (DISD). PDF (includes map of the district, which indicates the locations of Lipscomb, the library, and Woodrow Wilson) and (includes map of the district) Residents are zoned to William Lipscomb Elementary School (grades PK-5), J.L. Long Middle School, and Woodrow Wilson High School. Lipscomb is inside the Junius Heights Historic District, and Woodrow Wilson is adjacent to the historic district. Dallas Public Library operates the Lakewood Public Library, which is also inside the historic district. In addition to Junius Heights, Lipscomb also serves Munger Place and Swiss Avenue. By 2008 DISD made the school only serve grades K to 3, with grades 4 and 5 from the Lipscomb zone assigned to Mata Elementary. By that year parents campaigned for the return of grades 4 and 5 to Lipscomb. In 2008 Lipscomb began serving the 4th grade. Lipscomb now serves all elementary grades. Mata, now Eduardo Mata Montessori School, a K-8 school, gives second admission priority to people zoned to Woodrow Wilson High. Therefore Junius Heights is one of the neighborhoods with priority for the school.

Martin"},{"id":"2294882","text":"D.P. 7 was a comic book series published by Marvel Comics as part of its New Universe imprint. It ran for 32 issues and an Annual, which were published from 1986 to 1989. The title stands for Displaced Paranormals and refers to the seven main characters of the series (who never refer to themselves as displaced). All of them received superhuman powers as a result of the stellar phenomenon known as the White Event. D.P. 7 was the only New Universe series to maintain a stable creative team during its first year: its entire run was written by Mark Gruenwald, penciled by Paul Ryan, and colored by Paul Becton. Inker Danny Bulanadi (who began work on the title with issue #10) and letterer Janice Chiang (who began with issue #16) also stayed with D.P. 7 through to the final issue. Publication history Eager for the chance to work on \\"a virgin universe\\", writer Mark Gruenwald signed on to the New Universe staff and developed D.P. 7, shocking many readers (and even editor-in-chief Jim Shooter) who saw Gruenwald as strictly associated with the Marvel Universe. In an effort to set the series apart from other team books, Gruenwald wrote an analysis of 14 superhero groups in categories such as age makeup, origin, purpose, and budget, and deliberately constructed the group to differ from these 14 established groups in every category. He originally wanted the series to be called \\"Missing Persons\\", with a lineup consisting of Antibody, the Blur, Man Power, Quicksand, Twilight, and Vice Versa. Of these six, only the Blur and Twilight were included in the finalized lineup, though the name \\"Antibody\\" was used for a completely different character and the character Vice Versa served as a minor villain of the series. Gruenwald also changed the name to \\"M.P. 7 (Missing Paranormals)\\", before Jack Morelli suggested D.P. 7. Gruenwald explained, \\"I wanted the book to have a real punk - new wave - name.\\" At the time that he conceived the \\"Missing Persons\\" skeleton concept, Gruenwald was working on the final issues of the Squadron Supreme limited series with penciler Paul Ryan. He invited Ryan to work with him on the New Universe series; Ryan, being intrigued by the New Universe concept and having no prospects lined up after the end of Squadron Supreme, agreed. He later recounted his experience working on the series: \\"Mark absolutely believed in the New Universe and especially the cast of D.P. 7. We talked about them as if they were people we knew and cared about. We brought many of our real-life experiences, both positive and negative, to the series. We loved our characters.\\" Despite the creators' enthusiasm, the series met with mixed reactions from readers. Many criticized the fact that though the New Universe lineup was supposed to take place in real time, the first 13 issues of D.P. 7 (more than a year in real time) cover less than half a year in New Universe time. The remaining 19 issues were widely criticized for the way the series branched off into an increasing number of unrelated plotlines and an almost overwhelming large cast, and Gruenwald himself admitted at the time that \\"D.P. 7 really hasn't been seven guys for a while, and certainly not the original seven.\\" The lack of a central plotline stemmed from the fact that Gruenwald did not plot the series more than one issue in advance. Praise for D.P. 7 tended to center on its compelling characters, particularly mainstays Randy O'Brien and David Landers. D.P. 7 was canceled in June 1989 along with the rest of the New Universe line. The creators' interest in the characters remained, and in Quasar #31 (February 1992), Gruenwald has Quasar travel to the New Universe, thus allowing the D.P. 7 cast to guest-star in the issue. Ryan claims that he and Gruenwald had discussed doing a D.P. 7 limited series or graphic novel, but Gruenwald died before he was able to finish the plot. Plot synopsis Randy O'Brien first encounters David Landers when he is wheeled into the hospital in incredible pain. Landers rages until two dark arms spring from O'Brien's torso that restrain him long enough for O'Brien to give Landers a tranquilizer that renders him unconscious. The two compare their experiences, and O'Brien reads a classified ad for the Clinic for Paranormal Research, a facility designed to help individuals who have acquired strange abilities. He relays the information to Landers and they travel to the Clinic under assumed names. They are at first convinced of the Clinic staff's sincerity and are enrolled into Therapy Group C, where they meet Walters, Beck, Cuzinski, Harrington, and Fenzl. Late one night, O'Brien's antibody intrudes on the Clinic staff, at least four of whom are paranormals themselves, and learn the Clinic has plans to make an army out of them, to be led by Philip Nolan Voigt, the Clinic director.D.P. 7 #1 (November 1986) Therapy Group C fights off the Clinic staff and the paranormal Hackbarth, who can manipulate others' nervous systems. They escape into the night and over the next few months, the paranormals adjust to life with their powers. They are eventually apprehended by bounty hunters and returned to the Clinic.D.P. 7 #7-11 O'Brien and Landers, the last two to arrive, find that their friends have been behavior-modified to not remember their escape or the Clinic's ulterior motives. O'Brien and Landers defeat Voigt and he disappears from the Clinic.D.P. 7 #12 (October 1987) although he later reappears to successfully run for President of the United States in 1988. Without Voigt and his senior staff (Hackbarth is in a coma, memory manipulator Charne was choked to death by an Antibody, and telepathic Speck was shot)D.P. 7 #13 (November 1987) to surreptitiously maintain order, paranormals at the Clinic soon form their own special interest groups/gangs (one is composed of teenagers, one of African Americans, etc.).D.P. 7 #14-16 The potential for disaster is soon fulfilled, and law enforcement comes in to shut the Clinic down, killing many of the patients in the process.D.P. 7 #21 (July 1988) By this time, most of the reformed Therapy Group C (along with a few other residents of the Clinic) left to find Walters, who had run to Pittsburgh where his family had been caught in a major disaster.D.P. 7 #18 (April 1988) Except for Scuzz, the Displaced Paranormals begin to work with the government after all male paranormals are drafted into the United States Army after the destruction of Pittsburgh, believed to be caused by a nuclear weapon. Female paranormals become highly sought-after assets for other agencies like the CIA. With the exception of Walters, who continues in the Army, the other paranormals either go AWOL or leave the CIA and many of them move into New York City trying to live normal lives, in the face of the public leeriness of paranormals. While in the city, some ongoing romances play out, while other paranormals decide to become part of a superhero team. When the war is over, the paranormals (who had not been cured) return to lives that are as normal as they can be. Main characters *Randy O'Brien,Randy O'Brien (New Universe, DP7, Antibody) nicknamed Antibody, is a medical resident who can project from his body a dark figure of himself (also called an \\"antibody\\", a word play on the medical term) that flies, can become intangible, and transfer its memories to another person by physical contact. At the beginning of the series, O'Brien can only project and within limits control one of these entities. Later he proves able to manifest multiple antibodies. They all looked exactly the same to anyone else, but he could tell them apart and gave each individual names. His first few were named after the Marx Brothers. He later developed the ability to \\"wear\\" an antibody like a bodysuit, and at one time four of them joined together around him to create a more powerful antibody suit for him. Shortly before the series ended, O'Brien becomes trapped inside an antibody when he is hit by Pitt-Juice. The antibodies he subsequently creates are only a few inches tall and he gave these names like \\"Tink\\" and \\"Jiminy\\". O'Brien has a romantic attraction to Charly Beck, but Randy's upbringing instilled a sort of aversive racism in him that left him uncomfortable with the idea of a relationship with a black woman. Later he got over these feelings and wanted to attempt a relationship with Charly, but she has begun shunning him because of his new appearance. He is drafted into the Army's Paranormal Platoon, but goes AWOL, then moves to New York. *David Landers, nicknamed Mastodon, was a cheese factory worker who became stronger as new muscles grew into his body, an effect that caused him great pain at first. (Mark Gruenwald's description of Dave Landers's muscle growth was inspired by an article in a science magazine about a treatment in which electrical currents are used to contract a person's abdominal muscles, producing the equivalent of 500 sit-ups in a single minute.) He also found that the hair on his face (and what little he has on his head) grows at an astounding rate. He is able to lift over 15 tons and resist small-caliber gunfire. He has a crush on Stephanie through the entire series. He is drafted into the Army's Paranormal Platoon, but goes AWOL, then moves to New York. *Jeff Walters, nicknamed Blur, is a fast food restaurant manager whose body vibrates so fast that he cannot stand still. He requires vast amounts of food for his accelerated metabolism and can move at superhuman speed. He started out overweight, but his powers and hyper-metabolism quickly shed the pounds. His family died in the destruction of Pittsburgh. He is drafted into the Army's Paranormal Platoon and participates in the War. After the events of Secret Wars, he found himself on Earth-616 and became a member of the Squadron Supreme before the team disbanded, which led to Blur joining S.H.I.E.L.D. *Charlotte \\"Charly\\" Beck, nicknamed Friction, was a dance student who acquired the power to make herself, anything she touched, and any other object she thought about within a limited range friction-free enough to make the object or person slide effortlessly. Over time, Beck learned to make her power object-specific or to increase friction to stick things together, and during the Draft became a special CIA operative, but her program was discontinued and she moved to New York, where she attempted a dancing career. *Dennis \\"Scuzz\\" Cuzinski is a teenage dropout who produces a corrosive substance from his skin, which he himself is immune to. He can increase his skin's production of the chemical, to the point of burning through a steel plate in 10 seconds, but cannot stop it, turning anything he wears into a tattered ruin within days and affecting objects such as bedsheets and furniture that he comes into regular contact with. He learns to form his chemical-laden saliva with his skin secretion into \\"gobs\\" or \\"spitballs\\" that he can throw, and to further increase production of the substance when angry or excited, making his body so caustic that it can incinerate flammable material on contact. For a while he was the leader of the Clinic's underage paranormals who called themselves The DDTeens. After the clinic shut down, a high speed chase with police ended with him crashing their car, killing two of them and seriously injuring the rest of the DDTeens. By the end of D.P. 7, he becomes a member of the Cult of the White Event, which believes that paranormal powers are a gift from God. Because of this belief, he tries to assassinate the Cure, a paranormal with the power to remove others' paranormalities. As a result of the failed attempt, Scuzz and the Cure are both left powerless. *Stephanie Harrington, initially nicknamed Viva but later known as Glitter, is a housewife and mother of three with the power to heal and energize others by physical contact. The use of this power is accompanied by the appearance of twinkling stars. When not used to heal, her power makes her superhumanly strong (able to lift about 1 ton), fast (can run as fast as a speeding car), and agile (twice that of a normal human). She is recruited into the CIA during the Draft but her program is discontinued and she moves to New York. She eventually leaves her husband and develops some feelings for Dave Landers just before the end of the series. For a short time, she and her children moved back home to Wisconsin, but after being ostracized by their friends and neighbors, they return to New York at the end of the series. She finally responds to Dave's affections and admits to having feelings for him as well. *Lenore Fenzl, nicknamed Twilight, is a retired Latin teacher whose body produces \\"fatigue-poison inducing bioluminescence\\" that can paralyze and render unconscious individuals that are exposed to it. Fenzl's power requires her to remain covered over her entire body at all times, and she later discovers that exposing others to her bioluminescence renews her youth and vitality. After leaving the Clinic for the second time, she becomes a special CIA agent during the Draft. She is killed on a mission in Brazil battling a paranormal creature called the Famileech. The series grew to include several additional protagonists: *Miriam Sorenson, nicknamed Sponge, could absorb moisture from the air and release it as pressurized streams of water. She had an unrequited crush on Dave Landers, forming a love triangle. She was cured of her condition by the Cure, a paranormal who could restore others to normal. *George Mullaney, nicknamed Mutator, changed form every 48 hours; thus, his appearance was often in a state of flux as he slowly altered from one mutation to another. His often repellent animal forms led most other residents of the Clinic to shun him, but he was always eager to prove himself. He was eventually cured of his parability by the Cure. *Jenny Swensen of Codename: Spitfire crossed over to D.P.7 when the former series was canceled. Exposure to toxic sludge from The Pitt mutated her body and gave her metallic skin that could resist gunfire and enhanced strength. She was recruited to the CIA along with the other women, and later moved with them to New York. Known as Chrome, she became a sidekick to the telekinetic Captain Manhattan, one of the few costumed superheroes in the New Universe, whom she fell in love with. Though she seemed on the verge of having the Cure remove her powers at the end of the series, it was later revealed in the pages of Quasar that she chose to keep her powers. *Evan Heubner, a young orphan who ended up at the Clinic; though he thought he had no paranormal powers, he discovered he could play host to one of Randy O'Brien's antibodies who he named Shadowman, and could even jump into and \\"ride\\" inside the antibody. He later taught this trick to O'Brien. Evan was a member of the DDTeens along with Scuzz. Shadowman died saving Evan and Randy from a paranormal creature called the Famileech, but Randy created another antibody for Evan, which he promptly named Shadowman 2. Alternate versions=Exiles= Due to the multiverse traveling Exiles chasing Proteus, the team recruited D.P.7 just as they left the clinic along with Starbrand, Nightmask and Justice. In the following battle, Proteus took over the body of Justice and fled their universe and the Exiles followed, leaving the team behind, but now aware of other paranormals.

He was a replacement player during spring training in , crossing the picket line during the 1994 Major League Baseball strike. Shane Spencer's professional baseball career=New York Yankees (1998‚Äì2002)= Spencer was first called up to the major league in at the age of 26, in the midst of a famously dominant season by the Yankees. He first played briefly in April, then endeared himself memorably to fans in September by hitting 10 home runs, including three grand slams, then a record for Major League rookies, until it was broken by Alexei Ram√≠rez in 2008. Spencer accomplished the feat in only 67 at-bats, earning him a spot on the Yankees postseason roster. Additionally, Spencer was nicknamed Roy Hobbs in reference to the protagonist in The Natural, because he hit many home runs and was older than most rookies when brought up to the majors. In the postseason, Spencer hit a long home run in Yankee Stadium during the 1998 American League Division Series against the Texas Rangers as the Yankees went on to win the World Series. =Later career (2003‚Äì2006)= Spencer was not able to maintain that level of success, but became a solid role player and stayed with the Yankees through the season, having played in four World Series, winning three. He split the season with Texas and Cleveland and was signed as a free agent in by the Mets. His career did not live up to expectations, though, missing much playing time due to injury and striking out too often. In he signed with the Central League's Hanshin Tigers in Japan, appearing in 108 games and hitting 9 homers. In , he continued to play for the Tigers, but was cut. Major league teams were reluctant to sign him, despite his major league experience, because of off-field trouble after leaving the Yankees. He cut his foot in a bar in Manhattan, and then, while he was supposed to be on rehab assignment, he was arrested for drunk driving and speeding over 97 mph. He also had problems with Florida police during spring training 2004. He and teammate Karim Garcia were accused of hitting and kicking a pizza delivery man in 2004, though all charges were dropped. Coaching After his playing career ended, Spencer's career turned to coaching, and he served as the hitting coach for the Lake Elsinore Storm, the Single-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres, from until 2012.

Production notes The opening earthquake scenes were filmed in Antigua -specifically in La Recoleccion ruins\\\\- and Guatemala City, Guatemala. Reception Vincent Canby of The New York Times said the movie \\"has the sort of predictable outrage and shape of a made-for-television movie. It has suspense but little excitement. Once the people and the situation have been introduced, there's not a single surprise in the film, nothing of the uncharacteristic sort that differentiates the adequate melodrama from one that is special and memorable. Like so many films prompted by real-life social problems, The Border is a movie in which the characters appear to have been created to fit the events. Missing is any sense of particularity, as well as the excitement that comes when the members of the audience are allowed to discover some sort of truth for themselves.\\" Vincent Canby, \\"Jack Nicholson in 'The Border'\\" Jan. 29, 1982 https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B07E4D71038F93AA15752C0A964948260 ReferencesExternal links * * Category:1982 films Category:English- language films Category:Spanish-language films Category:American films Category:American crime drama films Category:American crime thriller films Category:1980s crime thriller films Category:1982 crime drama films Category:Films scored by Ry Cooder Category:Films shot in Texas Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in El Paso, Texas Category:Films set in Texas Category:Films directed by Tony Richardson Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Films about illegal immigration to the United States Category:RKO Pictures films Category:American neo-noir films Category:1982 drama films ","title":"The Border (1982 film)"},{"id":"2294898","text":"The year 1806 in archaeology involved some significant events.

He was the inventor of the Henry rifle, the first reliable lever-action repeating rifle. Henry was born in Claremont, New Hampshire in 1821. He apprenticed to a gunsmith as a young man and worked his way up to shop foreman at the Robins & Lawrence Arms Company of Windsor, Vermont where he worked with Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson on a rifle known as the \\"Volitional Repeater\\". In 1854, Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson formed a new company with Courtlandt Palmer, and further improved the operating mechanism, developing the Smith & Wesson Lever pistol, and a new Volcanic cartridge. Production was in the shop of Horace Smith in Norwich, Connecticut. Originally using the name \\"Smith & Wesson Company\\", the name was changed to \\"Volcanic Repeating Arms Company\\" in 1855, with the addition of new investors, one of whom was Oliver Winchester. The Volcanic Repeating Arms Company obtained all rights for the Volcanic designs (both rifle and pistol versions were in production by this time) as well as the ammunition, from the Smith & Wesson Company. Wesson remained as plant manager for 8 months before rejoining Smith to found the \\"Smith & Wesson Revolver Company\\" upon obtaining the licensing of the Rollin White rear loading cylinder patent. Winchester forced the insolvency of the Volcanic Arms Company in late 1856, took over ownership and moved the plant to New Haven, Connecticut, where it was reorganized as the New Haven Arms Company in April 1857 and Henry was hired as plant superintendent. On October 16, 1860, he received a patent on the Henry .44 caliber repeating rifle, which soon proved the worth of the lever-action design on the battlefields of the American Civil War, where Henry rifles were used alongside muzzle-loading rifled muskets such as the Springfield Model 1861. The first Henry rifles were not produced for army use until mid-1862. In 1864, Henry grew angry over what he believed was inadequate compensation and attempted to have the Connecticut legislature award ownership of New Haven Arms to him. Oliver Winchester, hastening back from Europe, forestalled the move and reorganized New Haven Arms yet again as the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. Winchester had the basic design of the Henry rifle completely modified and improved to become the first Winchester rifle, the Model 1866, which fired the same .44 caliber rimfire cartridges as the Henry but had an improved magazine with the addition of a loading gate on the right side of the receiver (invented by Winchester employee Nelson King) and, for the first time, a wooden forearm. Henry left the Winchester Repeating Arms Company over this dispute and worked as an individual gunsmith until his death in 1898.

He is predominantly known as a calligrapher, and is also admired for his painting and poetry. He was one of the Four Masters of the Song Dynasty (), and was a younger friend of Su Shi and influenced by his and his friends' practice of literati painting (), calligraphy, and poetry. Biography=Early years in Jiangnan= Takeuchi Seih≈ç - Calm Spring in Jiangnan Jiangnan Summer View. Dong Yuan, 10th century. Jiangxi in China, showing approximate area of Huang Tingjian's home (modern map) Huang Tingjian was born into the prominent Huang clan, which had established residence in Jiangnan, south of the Yangzi River, just across the river gorge from the main turmoils and troubles of the Five Dynasties period. Tingjian's great-great- grandfather had then and there established a great library, together with an educational system. Achievement of the jinshi degree was a common attainment for men of the Huang clan. Huang Tingjian's mother, Lady Li, was an accomplished painter of bamboo and player of the guqin. His father, Huang Shu (,1018-1058) received his jinshi in 1042, and introduced his son Huang Tingjian to the works of Du Fu and Han Yu, before dying when Tingjian was 13 years old, at which point Huang Murck, 158-159 Tingjian left his hometown of Fenning (,in modern Jiangxi).Murck, 158 and 161 =With Uncle Li in Anhui= After his father's death, Huang Tingjian was sent to Anhui to be further brought up by his uncle, Li Chang (,1027-1090), who was also possessed of a large library. =Jinshi and early career= Huang Tingjian failed his jinshi in the Imperial examination, at his first attempt, in 1064, but was passed in 1067, when he was 22 years old. His first employment was in Song Shenzong's first year as emperor.Murck, 158 =Tianjin earthquakes= Tianjin's location, in modern China. This is also not too far from where Huang Tingjian's teaching post at the Northern Capital was located. In 1068-1069 a series of major earthquakes occurred southwest of modern Tianjin. The devastating human consequences were noted by Huang Tingjian. This was the occasion of his writing the poem \\"Lament for the Refugees\\" (, using the imagery of a giant tortoise moving mountains which it carried upon its back .Murck, 160 and note 3, page 331 =Teaching career= Huang Tingjian passed his teaching credential exam in 1072, and spent the next 7 years teaching at the Damingfu Imperial Academy in Hebei.Murck, 158-159 Its location was in what is currently Daming County. Damingfu was then Northern Capital of the Song Chinese Empire, and not far from the militarily turbulent northern border with the rival Khitan Empire. =Fame and conviction for conspiracy against the emperor= In 1072, Li Chang, his maternal uncle, and Sun Jue his father-in-law had shown examples of Huang Tingjiang's works to the famous poet and New Policy opponent Su Shi (Dongpo). In 1078, Huang presented Su with a letter and two elaborate gushi-style poems, to which Su returned with two poems of his own, matching Huang's rhyme-scheme. Huang's fame was secured when Su Shi (Dongpo) heaped his praises upon him, and the two became close friends for life.Murck, 159 and note 8, page 331 So far, it seems that Huang had managed to avoid entanglement in politics, and in fact his early career as an imperial teaching official seems to have been in part secured by the favor of Wang Anshi, upon reading a poem of Huang's, hinting at retiring from the boredom which he was experiencing at that point of his career.Murck, 158-159 At the time, there were two major parties, a \\"reform\\" party (also known as the New Policies Group), led by Wang Anshi and a \\"conservative\\" party, which included such prominent officials as Sima Guang, Ouyang Xiu, and Su Shi. Under the imperial system the winning side was chosen by the emperor (or the emperor's regent in the case of his minority). Imperial disfavor could range from death to a stalled career. As Emperor Shenzong increasingly favored Wang Anshi's New Policies, as they were known, their opponents suffered politically: this included exile for Su Shi, beginning in 1080, to Hangzhou (which was the time period when Su adopted the nickname of Dongpo). As Su's conviction was for writing in a defamatory way about the emperor and his government, anyone who had circulated his writings without reporting them (as Shen Kuo did), was likely to be found guilty of conspiracy. Both Huang Tingjian and his Uncle Li were convicted as co-conspirators and accordingly given considerable fines (20 catties of copper).Murck, 160-161 Huang was also exiled, first to Jizhou Subprefecture (now Jizhou District, Jiangxi), then to Depingzhen, in Shandong. Like, Su Shi, Huang Tingjian was known for good governance: light with taxes and empathetic with the common folk over whom they were placed in charge. Among other deeds, Huang Tingjian failed to enforce the New Policy of government monopoly of salt production.Murck, 158-160 =Yuanyou era= The Yuanyou (, Yu√°ny√≤u) era (1086‚Äì1093) was the first regnal period of the new emperor, Song Zhezong, and an important period in the life of Huang Tingjian. During the Yuanyou years, Zhezong was in his minority, and Empress Dowager Gao acted as regent. Empress Dowager Gao was not a New Policy enthusiast. Wang Anshi's party fell out of favor, and Wang Anshi himself was forced into retirement. Huang Tingjian and the other exiles were recalled from their places of banishment. Happy days were here again: now, Su, Huang, and the others could enjoy each other's company in person, and Huang was promoted, to sub-editor of the Academy of Scholarly Worthies and examining editor for the official records of former Emperor Shenzong's reign.Murck, 160 Editing the official records of the previous emperor, in light of the factional politics which had ignited at that time and were still burning, would turn out to be a perilous undertaking for Huang Tingjian's future. =Death of his mother and exile= Sichuan in China (on modern map) Huang Tingjian's mother died in 1091. Obligatory retirement for a period of mourning in the case of the death of either parent was then the custom, and Huang returned to the family cemetery in Fenning, Jiangnan, with the remains of his mother, his two wives that had died, and those of an aunt. While he was engaged in the three-year ritual mourning period, Empress Dowager Gao died, and Zhezong began to reign in fact as well as name. Zhezong favored the reformist party, and their remnant members returned with a vengeance: their opponents alive or dead were persecuted: Su Shi was demoted and exiled, Sima Guang and L√º Gongzhu's tombs were defaced, and Huang Tingjian was denounced by Cai Bian (Wang Anshi's son- in-law). Huang was convicted of sarcastically editing the official records of former Emperor Shenzong. Huang Tingjian spent the ensuing decade in exile, in various locations in Sichuan.Murck, 161-162 =Pardon and exile, again= Location of Ezhou Prefecture within modern Hubei, China. Guangxi, in modern China In the year 1100, Emperor Zhezong died young and unexpectedly, at 23 years old, and with his death came a new political alignment: the new emperor was Huizong, then in his late teenage years. Much of the power was in the hands of his older brother's wife, the former Empress Xiang. A general amnesty was declared between the two parties, the reformists and, the conservatives. By this time the anti-reformist conservatives were known as the \\"Yanyou Party\\". Cai Bian and his adherents were dismissed from office. Huang Tingjian found out he had been pardoned, later in the year of 1100. He was also granted a sinecure position in Ezhou city, in southeastern Hubei (responsible for collecting tax revenues on salt), which meant that he received a salary or other remuneration; but, as he was not required to live or work there, this was not exile. However, Huang Tingjian remained in Sichuan long enough to attend his son's marriage ceremony, to the daughter of a local official. In 1102, Huang Tingjian visited Fenning, after extensive travels and several illnesses. As the year 1102 progressed, the political pendulum again reversed itself: the Yuanyou officials were out of favor once more. A list of somewhat over 100 officials whom the emperor considered to be heterodox was erected on a stele at the capital: Huang Tingjian was one of those named. Huang had been the recipient of a major promotion, but was now dismissed summarily, just 9 days after his appointment. As the year 1102 waned, Huang Tingjian returned to Ezhou, and visited various other places including Wuchang. It was during this period that he wrote \\"Wind in the Pines Hall\\".Murck, 162-163 Huang Tingjian awaited further developments at Ezhou, hearing no news about how the emperor intended to deal with his case, until the end of 1103. It was exile, again. This time to the far south, Yizhou (now in Guangxi).Murck, 179 At the time, as now Yizhou, was a fairly small settlement composed of both ethnic Han people and Zhuang people. However, then it was only tenuously part of the Chinese Empire. Guangxi, then administered as Guangnanxi (\\"West Southern Expanse\\"), had only been annexed by the Song Dynasty in 971. And, as recently as 1052, the Zhuang leader Nong Zhigao had led a revolt, briefly making the area part of an independent kingdom. Sending the then 58-year-old, sick and frail Huang Tingjian to an official exile in this remote and precarious position was not far from a death sentence. =XiaoXiang poetry= Map of the XiaoXiang area, with Guangxi (the location of Yizhou) at bottom. Travel to his remote posting meant passing through the XiaoXiang: the classic poetic place of exile. Not that he was not already there, in Ezhou; but, now, Huang Tingjian was faced with traveling through the depths of it, only to emerge into an even more remote and difficult territory. He faced a fate similar to Su Shi Dongpo, who never quite made it back from his final exile in the then remote and undeveloped island of Hainan. The far southern lands were known as the \\"gates of hell\\", but when the emperor ordered one of his subjects there, there was little choice. Open resistance could be and often was met with the mass annihilation of ones entire family, and even whole clan. The main hope was a quick recall from exile. However, in Huang Tingjian's case, this never happened. In early 1104, Huang Tingjian packed up his family and headed south, towards his place of banishment, Yizhou. That springtime, during the course of his journey, Huang Tingjian met the Chan monk Zhongren (also known as Huaguang, after the name of his monastery). Zhongren shared a scroll of poems by Su Shi, Su Shi's brother Su Che, the monk Shenliao, and Qin Guan (another one of the Yuanyou crew): and, both Su Shi and Qin Guan had died as a result of their exiles in the south, the journey which Huang Tingjian was now upon. The two became friends: Zhongren painted branches of flowering plum blossoms and landscapes for Huang, Huang wrote poems in his inimitable calligraphy for Zhongren, even appending a poem with praise of Zhongren to the end of his precious scroll of poems. Together the two helped to change the art world forever: establishing monochrome painting of plums among the scholar-official class.Murck, 179 =Death= Yizhou: view from the Long River, 2007. Parting ways with his friend Zhongren, Huang Tingjian headed onward towards his destined place of banishment, Yizhou. Emperor Huizong had ordered him there, and so, leaving his family in the mountains of Yongzhou (Hunan), in order to \\"spare them from the intense heat\\", Huang Tingjian traveled on to his destination without them. Once there, he continued his calligraphy, of which an ink rubbing survives, a rather pointed quote about the life of Fan Pang (137-169), who was arrested and executed due to getting caught up in factional politics, during the second of the Disasters of Partisan Prohibitions which occurred during the Han dynastic era.Murck, 187. Also see ÂæåÊº¢Êõ∏/Âç∑67 In the early Winter of 1105, Huang Tingjian died, alone from his family, in exile, in Yizhou. His funeral was arranged by a stranger, who had traveled to Yizhou, hoping to make his acquaintance.Murck, 187-188 Health Huang Tingjian's health was poor throughout his life. His health problems included \\"beriberi, severe coughs and colds, malarial fever, headaches, dizziness, and in his later years, heart trouble and chest and arm pains.\\"Murck, note 5, page 331, following Shen Fu Huang Tingjian also had a deep interest in medicinal substances, and at one point seriously mulled over the idea of giving up his aspirations for an official career, in favor of opening up a shop and dealing in herbs and herbal medications.Murck, 159 Family Huang Tingjian had 3 wives during his life, and one son, to the third. His first wife was the daughter of the scholar, Sun Jue (1028-1090). She died in 1070. His second wife, from the Xie clan, had a daughter to him, before her death, in Damingfu, in 1079. His third wife gave birth to his only son, whom he gave the unusual name of \\"Forty\\", because he was 40 years old when the boy was born.Murck, 159 Religion Huang Tingjian had a strong lifelong interest in Buddhism and Daoism. In his hometown of Fenning were 10 monasteries of the Chan practice (\\"Chan\\" is Chinese for Zen); indeed, Jiangnan had hundreds of them. The year after his second wife died, Huang retreated to the Shan'gu (Mountain Valley) Daoist monastery in Anhui, and took the religious name Shan'gu Daoren.Murck, 159 Works Scroll for Zhang Datong, A.D. 1100, a canonical work of Chinese calligraphy in the Princeton University Art Museum Huang Tingjian is noted for his prodigious talent in terms of his vast knowledge of Classical Chinese poetry and literature.Murck, 157 He is famous both for the calligraphy and the poetry of his work \\"Wind in the Pines Hall\\", which survives in the Palace Museum, Taipei.Murck, 177 =Calligraphy= Biographies of Lian Po and Lin Xiangru. Calligraphy by Huang Tingjian. Huang is also regarded as a particularly fine and creative calligrapher of the Song Dynasty. His xingshu (semi-cursive style of script) displays a sharpness and aggression that is instantly recognizable to students of Chinese calligraphy. His calligraphic piece Biographies of Lian Po and Lin Xiangru epitomises a technique today known as \\"flying-white\\" \\"when writing calligraphy, the areas within a brushstroke where the brush fails to leave a full measure of ink and streaks of white paper or silk appear\\".Wang Yao-t'ing, Looking at Chinese Painting, Nigensha Publishing Co.

The settlement has a large modern sawmill with planing. There are many opportunities for fitness trips in the area whether by skiing, riding or on foot. History From early on, the settlement had a stave church at Koppanjordet, traces of which still remain. According to legend, the church was taken by a flood and the logs washed ashore in the shape of a cross at Kirkemoen. A new stave church was built on the site, dedicated to Saint Michael. The R√∏ros Line reached Koppang in 1875, the village being served by Koppang Station. From 1877 to 1885, the trains on the line had an overnight stop at Koppang, leading to increased commerce and an expansion of the settlement. From ancient times, people lived in the valley, but repeated flooding caused them to move higher up along its sides. Barns remain at Koppanjordet which have survived many floods. The Old King's Road ( Gamle Kongevei) to Trondheim runs through Koppang.

The move was made because of their joining The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and their desire to be near the body of the church. He lived in both Eden and Liberty, Utah. After struggling to make a living, the family moved to Oregon City, Oregon. There they worked in a new mill. He worked for the mill for a year, then for a lumber corporation, and the Oregon and California Railroad. The family moved back to Ogden, Utah in 1869 after the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad hoping it would bring them work. In the Ogden area, he worked cutting wood and building homes. He worked as a freighter and for the Union Pacific coal mines. He also worked at a sawmill at Monte Cristo east of Ogden. In 1874, he attended Louis F. Moench's school in Ogden. It was there he met Bertha Marie Jensen and married her in 1875. They had 12 children from this marriage. While he had been working he saved up a considerable amount of money and put it to other uses. He started the Eccles Lumber Company and several other enterprises. Through supplying ties for railroads, he knew the local circumstances of where the railroads were building and the opportunities available. He opened lumber mills, shingle mills, planing mills, an electric plant, and other entities. He followed the railroads and opened mills in other locations in Oregon and Washington states. He and his associates built the Sumpter Valley and Mount Hood railroads. It was through these and other railroads that Eccles shipped the lumber and other goods to Utah. Eccles met Ellen Stoddard, the daughter of his partner, John Stoddard. Under the practice of polygamy at the time, David married Ellen, and they made their home in Logan, Utah where he built a lavish yellow brick mansion for his new bride using lumber imported from his corporation in Oregon. (The home is on West Center Street.) Marriner Stoddard Eccles and George S. Eccles are children of this marriage. Eccles was a hard worker. He reported himself to have traveled over in 1904. While friends encouraged him to slow down, he preferred to \\"die in the harness.\\" One of his hallmarks was integrity and self-reliance. His companies prospered on his no debt plan, and view of achieving success rather than money. David always put his children to work early in life. They worked along with the crews on the railroads, mills, and lumber yards. They were taught as many aspects of the businesses as they were willing to learn. Several went and served missions for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. One son graduated from University of Michigan Law School, another from Columbia University, others from Brigham Young College, Utah State University, and the University of Utah. With the estimated 4‚Äì7 million dollars he made, mostly from his Oregon enterprises, he invested heavily in Utah. He purchased stock in banks, canneries, insurance companies, railroads, factories, mills, mines, and various other companies. The Utah Construction Company built over of track for the Western Pacific Railroad and led the Six Companies in constructing the Hoover Dam. David Eccles served as the second president of Utah Construction Company after the death of long-term associate Thomas Dee. He also served as founder of a number of companies, one of which was the Amalgamated Sugar Company. Eccles served on the Ogden City Council and as their mayor from 1888 to 1890. He was known for his aid to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for lending large amounts of money to the church at no interest. At the time of his death, he was the president of 16 industrial corporations and 7 banks. He also was serving as a director in 24 other banks and industries. He is Utah's first multimillionaire.

It is shorthand for the aphorism coined in the late 1940s by Theodore Woodward, professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who instructed his medical interns: \\"When you hear hoofbeats behind you, don't expect to see a zebra\\".Sotos (2006) page 1. Woodward's original version was: \\"Don't look for zebras on Greene Street,\\" the street on which the University of Maryland medical campus is sited. Since horses are common in Maryland while zebras are relatively rare, logically one could confidently guess that an animal making hoofbeats is probably a horse. By 1960, the aphorism was widely known in medical circles.Imperato (1979) pages 13, 18. As explained by Sotos,Sotos (2006) page 7. medical novices are predisposed to make rare diagnoses because of (a) the availability heuristic (\\"events more easily remembered are judged more probable\\") and (b) the phenomenon first enunciated in Rhetorica ad Herennium (circa 85 BC), \\"the striking and the novel stay longer in the mind.\\" Thus, the aphorism is an important caution against these biases when teaching medical students to weigh medical evidence. Diagnosticians have noted, however, that \\"zebra\\"-type diagnoses must nonetheless be held in mind until the evidence conclusively rules them out: The term for an obscure and rare diagnosis in medicine is fascinoma. Examples Necrotic skin lesions in the United States are often diagnosed as loxoscelism (recluse spider bites), even in areas where Loxosceles species are rare or not present. This is a matter of concern because such misdiagnoses can delay correct diagnosis and treatment. Usage Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is considered a rare condition and its sufferers are known as medical zebras. The zebra was adopted across the world as the EDS mascot to bring the patient community together and raise awareness. Why the Zebraurl=http://www.ehlers-danlos.org/about-eds-uk/why-the-zebra In popular culture The television series Scrubs episode \\"My Balancing Act\\", focuses on this theme, and the medical veteran Dr. Cox uses the metaphor to explain to intern John \\"J. D.\\" Dorian why he should first consider a simple diagnosis. The television series House had the working title Chasing Zebras, Circling the Drain, a reference to the show's recurring theme of hunting for obscure diagnoses while a patient is in a critical condition. The title character, diagnostic expert Dr. Gregory House rejects the aphorism in his particular practice, arguing that any cases with simple solutions would have been successfully diagnosed by someone else before reaching him. The episode \\"Zebras\\" of the television series Law & Order: Special Victims Unit was named after this term and cites a version of the aphorism in the teaser.

As of 2020, the school serves northern portions of Mesquite and the MISD portion of Garland. Formerly, North Mesquite served all of Sunnyvale, before the completion of Sunnyvale High School, leaving the class of 2010 the last North Mesquite class catering to Sunnyvale students. North Mesquite serves grades 9 through 12. The total enrollment in 2002 was 2450; the school is therefore under the UIL AAAAAA (or 6A) division. According to the MISD Report Card, the per student expenditure for the same 2002 period was 2700 USD. The stallion is the school mascot and the school colors are blue and white. The school's motto is Animus Omnia Vincit, which translates from the Latin as \\"Courage Conquers All.\\" North Mesquite High School before renovation History North Mesquite High School opened in September 1969 as the second high school in Mesquite ISD, behind Mesquite High School, the school's rival in athletic competitions. The original construction consisted of four floors: A, B, C, and D. Over several decades, the enrollment expanded in accordance with the population swell that took place in Mesquite and Sunnyvale, demanding supplementary facilities. In the 1990s, a new gym was constructed. F wing and E section opened for the 2002-2003 school year providing twenty new general classrooms as well as a new Band, Orchestra, and Choir hall. During the 2008-2009 school year construction on S wing (Science wing) began, and opened for the 2009-2010 school year providing 8 Labs and 16 science classrooms. With the science wing being added, the existing rooms on A floor were renovated and added new classrooms. The front of the school was renovated; a new entrance was created, and the business office was enlarged and renovated. The cafeteria was enlarged and snack lines were added. In September 2018 a statue of the school‚Äôs mascot, a Stallion, was placed inside the building right at the entrance. North Mesquite after renovation North Mesquite's New Entrance Areas served by North Mesquite North Mesquite serves northern portions of the city of Mesquite and the students in the MISD portion of southern Garland. Formerly, the school also served all high school students living in Sunnyvale. However, in an election on May 12, 2007, Sunnyvale residents passed a bond creating Sunnyvale High School. From the 2007-2008 school year, ninth grade students in Sunnyvale were housed in Sunnyvale Middle School for two years, until the construction of the high school was complete. Beginning in the 2009-2010 school year, students attended classes at the actual SHS campus. One grade was added consecutively to the high school, making the class of 2010 the last North Mesquite class that catered to Sunnyvale students. Thomas Korosec of D Magazine implied that changing racial demographics at North Mesquite may have motivated the Sunnyvale district to build its own high school. Demographics By the 2010s most of the students were Hispanic/Latino and African-American. with 11% being other Standardized dress code All students in North Mesquite are required to dress according to a standardized dress code (similar to a school uniform) as of 2005; the code is used in all Mesquite ISD middle schools, high schools and 5th and 6th grades. See this link for more information about Standard Dress Feeder patterns Mesquite ISD elementary schools that feed into North Mesquite include all of Florence, Lawrence, McKenzie, Motley, Price, Range, Rugel, Shands, and Tosch. Part of McDonald Middle School and all of Vanston Middle School in Mesquite ISD feed into North Mesquite. (The other alumni of McDonald feed into West Mesquite High School.) Rivalry North Mesquite's rival is Mesquite High School. The rivalry dates back to when North Mesquite was founded in 1969. The school was the first to split from Mesquite High, which was then the only high school in the city, and thus the rivalry started. 2012 The North Mesquite Band, known as the Big Blue Band(BBB for short), was started with the opening of the school in 1969. In recent years Big Blue has relatively gotten attention in East Texas as one of the better bands. Big Blue had its best year in 2012 with its show entitled \\"Immortal\\". Under the direction of Jeffery D Jones, Big Blue started the season big as they wowed the crowd at The Mesquite Marching Competition. At their next competition, The Classic on the Lake hosted in Little Elm Texas, Big Blue earned its bragging rights. Ending in 3rd in Prelims, the band went to finish in 2nd place in finals placing behind Sherman High. At the UIL Big Blue got straight ones, advancing them to the Area C Marching Competition. At their final Performance North ended their season there with a heart breaking loss. Of the twenty so schools there, North ended in 5th, one spot below the 4 bands that would continue to state. Losing to Rowlett, Duncanville, Coppell, and Berkner High, North waits for 2014, hoping to be one of those 4 bands, heading to their first State Marching Competition.

The operation was staged in June 1942 and was to be directed against strategic American economic targets. The operation was named by Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, chief of the German Abwehr, for Francis Daniel Pastorius, the leader of the first organized settlement of Germans in America. Background After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, followed by Nazi Germany's declaration of war on the United States four days later (and the United States' declaration of war on Germany in response), Hitler authorized a mission to sabotage the American war effort and attack civilian targets to demoralize the American civilian population inside the United States. The mission was headed by Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, chief of the German Abwehr. Canaris recalled that during World War I, he organized the sabotage of French installations in Morocco, and entered the United States with other German agents to plant bombs in New York arms factories, including the destruction of munitions supplies at Black Tom Island, in 1916. He hoped that Operation Pastorius would have the same kind of success they had in 1916. Agents Recruited for Operation Pastorius were eight German residents who had lived in the United States. Two of them, Ernst Burger and Herbert Haupt, were American citizens. The others, George John Dasch, Edward John Kerling, Richard Quirin, Heinrich Harm Heinck, Hermann Otto Neubauer, and Werner Thiel, had worked at various jobs in the United States. All eight were recruited into the Abwehr military intelligence organization and were given three weeks of intensive sabotage training in the German High Command school on an estate at Quenz Lake, near Berlin, Germany. The agents were instructed in the manufacture and use of explosives, incendiaries, primers, and various forms of mechanical, chemical, and electrical delayed timing devices. Considerable time was spent developing complete background \\"histories\\" they were to use in the United States. They were encouraged to converse in English and to read American newspapers and magazines to hone their English and familiarity with current American events and culture. Mission Their mission was to stage sabotage attacks on American economic targets: hydroelectric plants at Niagara Falls; the Aluminum Company of America's plants in Illinois, Tennessee, and New York; locks on the Ohio River near Louisville, Kentucky; the Horseshoe Curve, a crucial railroad pass near Altoona, Pennsylvania, as well as the Pennsylvania Railroad's repair shops at Altoona;Horseshoe Curve, NRHS - Railfan's Guide to the Altoona Area(Requires Java 1.6 as of 1 January 2009] a cryolite plant in Philadelphia; Hell Gate Bridge in New York; and Pennsylvania Station in Newark, New Jersey. The agents were also instructed to spread a wave of terror by planting explosives on bridges, railroad stations, water facilities, and public places. They were given counterfeit birth certificates, Social Security Cards, draft deferment cards, nearly $175,000 in American money, and driver's licenses, and put aboard two U-boats to land on the east coast of the U.S. Before the mission began, it was in danger of being compromised, as George Dasch, head of the team, left sensitive documents behind on a train, and one of the agents when drunk announced to patrons at a bar in Paris that he was a secret agent. On the night of June 12, 1942, the first submarine to arrive in the U.S., , landed at Amagansett, New York, which is about 100 miles east of New York City, on Long Island, at what today is Atlantic Avenue beach. It was carrying Dasch and three other saboteurs (Burger, Quirin, and Heinck). The team came ashore wearing German Navy uniforms so that if they were captured, they would be classified as prisoners of war rather than spies.Judicial Review for Enemy Fighters: The Court‚Äôs Fateful Turn in Ex parte Quirin, the Nazi Saboteur Case They also brought their explosives, primers and incendiaries, and buried them along with their uniforms, and put on civilian clothes to begin an expected two-year campaign in the sabotage of American defense-related production.Federal Bureau of Investigation: George John Dasch and the Nazi Saboteurs, FBI Famous Cases When Dasch was discovered amidst the dunes by unarmed Coast Guardsman John C. Cullen, Dasch offered Cullen a $260 bribe. Elke Frenzel, Hitler's Unfulfilled Dream of a New York in Flames Der Spiegel 16 September 2010 Cullen feigned cooperation but reported the encounter. An armed patrol returned to the site but found only the buried equipment; the Germans had taken the Long Island Rail Road from the Amagansett station into Manhattan, where they checked into a hotel. A massive manhunt was begun. The other four-member German team headed by Kerling landed without incident at Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, south of Jacksonville on June 16, 1942. They came on , another submarine. This group came ashore wearing bathing suits but wore German Navy hats. After landing ashore, they threw away their hats, put on civilian clothes, and started their mission by boarding trains to Chicago, Illinois and Cincinnati, Ohio. The two teams were to meet on July 4 in a hotel in Cincinnati to coordinate their sabotage operations.Page 130, The Florida Historical Quarterly, Volume 49 Betrayal Dasch called Burger into their upper-story hotel room and opened a window, saying they would talk, and if they disagreed, \\"only one of us will walk out that door‚Äîthe other will fly out this window.\\" Dasch told him he had no intention of going through with the mission, hated Nazism, and planned to report the plot to the FBI. Burger agreed to defect to the United States immediately. On June 15, Dasch phoned the New York office of the FBI to explain who he was, but hung up when the agent answering doubted his story. Four days later, he took a train to Washington, DC and walked into FBI headquarters, where he gained the attention of Assistant Director D.M. Ladd by showing him the operation's budget of $84,000 cash. Besides Burger, none of the other German agents knew they were betrayed. Over the next two weeks, Burger and the other six were arrested. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover made no mention that Dasch had turned himself in, and claimed credit for the FBI for cracking the spy ring.

Placed before a seven-member military commission, the Germans were charged with the following offenses: :* 1) Violating the law of war; :* 2) Violating Article 81 of the Articles of War, defining the offense of corresponding with or giving intelligence to the enemy; :* 3) Violating Article 82 of the Articles of War, defining the offense of spying; and :* 4) Conspiracy to commit the offenses alleged in the first three charges. The trial was held in Assembly Hall #1 on the fifth floor of the Department of Justice building in Washington D.C. on July 8, 1942. Lawyers for the accused, who included Lauson Stone and Kenneth Royall, attempted to have the case tried in a civilian court but were rebuffed by the United States Supreme Court in Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1 (1942), a case that was later cited as a precedent for the trial by military commission of any unlawful combatant against the United States. The trial for the eight defendants ended on August 1, 1942. Two days later, all were found guilty and sentenced to death. Roosevelt commuted Burger's sentence to life in prison and Dasch's to 30 years because they had turned themselves in and provided information about the others. The others were executed on August 8, 1942 in the electric chair on the third floor of the District of Columbia jail and buried in a potter's field in the Blue Plains neighborhood in the Anacostia area of Washington. Aftermath The failure of Operation Pastorius led Hitler to rebuke Admiral Canaris and no sabotage attempt was ever made again in the United States. During the remaining years of the war, the Germans only once more dispatched agents to the United States by submarine. In November 1944, as part of Operation Elster, the German submarine U-1230 dropped two RSHA spies off the coast of Maine to gather intelligence on American manufacturing and technical progress. The FBI captured both men shortly after. These agents benefited from the calmer state of public nerves in the later years of the war and received prison sentences rather than execution. In 1948, President Harry S. Truman granted executive clemency to Dasch and Burger on the condition that they be deported to the American Zone of occupied Germany. They were not welcomed back in Germany, as they were regarded as traitors who had caused the death of their comrades. Although they had been promised pardons by Hoover in exchange for their cooperation, both men died without ever receiving them. Dasch died in 1992 at the age of 89 in Ludwigshafen, Germany. Burger died in 1975. Sometime in the 1960s or 1970s, the National Socialist White People's Party placed an unauthorized monument to the executed spies in a thicket in southwest Washington, D.C. on National Park Service land. It went largely unknown and ignored for several decades; the Park Service removed it in 2010.

Subsequently, converted into a bulk oil carrier under the name Tahsis No. 3, the ship struck a rock and sank on 10 March 1953. Princess Victoria was built in Wallsend, Newcastle upon Tyne, England, by the shipyards of C.S. Swan and Hunter Company. She was long, with a beam of 40.5 feet, 1,943 gross tons and three smokestacks. Christened on 18 November 1902, she arrived in Victoria, British Columbia on 28 March 1903. While the ship burned coal when it was built, Princess Victoria was converted to oil fuel in 1912. During her time in Victoria, Princess Victoria ran routes between Victoria, Vancouver and Seattle, Washington. Princess Victoria was involved in a major accident on 26 August 1914, when she rammed and sank in Puget Sound during heavy fog. Laid up in 1950, Princess Victoria was sold to Tahsis & Company of Vancouver in November 1951 and converted into a bulk oil carrier named Tahsis No. 3. Shortly after the conversion, the ship struck a rock on 10 March 1953 and sank in Welcome Pass, a narrow passageway north of Vancouver, British Columbia. After its sinking, it was broken up at the Victoria Capital Iron Works and its engine room, telegraph, and steering were re-purposed for the MV Uchuck III which still runs today.

He is a former Dutch international and Head of Academy at Ajax. Together with Jordi Cruyff, Jonk manages Cruyff Football and is responsible for the worldwide continuation and dissemination of the football legacy of Dutch football legend Johan Cruyff, who died on 24 March 2016.  Playing career  Born in Volendam, Jonk started his career in amateur club RKAV Volendam, before signing for Volendam in 1986. A prolific scorer from midfield, he helped his club achieve promotion to the Eredivisie in 1987. Ajax keenly monitored his progress and his skills did not escape the scouts of the club, who hastened his transfer to Amsterdam in 1988. At Ajax, he merged into the squad easily, even scoring six goals in his debut season. First team chances were regular, if not abundant, but his first appearance for the Dutch national team seemed a long way away. His gameplay was not very artistic, but he has earned a reputation as a midfield anchor in the same mould as other Dutch players like Aron Winter, Erwin Koeman, Philip Cocu, Mark van Bommel and Kevin Strootman. Therefore, with the Dutch 1990 World Cup squad brimming with attack-minded midfielders like Richard Witschge and Jan Wouters, he was unsurprisingly omitted from selection for the national team in the late 1980s as well as the 1990 World Cup squad. He helped Ajax to the 1992 UEFA Cup Final in which he scored to help them overcome Torino. His pin-point passing, outstanding vision and combative and hard-working style of play earned him his debut for the Dutch national team in a 3‚Äì2 win in a friendly against Austria on 27 May 1992, and he signed on for Inter Milan in 1993 before the 1994 World Cup, where he was joined by compatriot Dennis Bergkamp. The Italian club had seemingly followed their illustrious city rivals Milan into buying Dutch players in the hope of emulating Milan's success with Marco van Basten, Frank Rijkaard and Ruud Gullit in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The Netherlands 1994 World Cup squad selected by then coach Dick Advocaat had been tipped to reach the quarter-finals of the tournament and Advocaat had opted for a central midfield pairing of Jonk and usually Jan Wouters or Rob Witschge, supported by speedy wingers such as Marc Overmars and Bryan Roy. In the first group match against Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands fell behind to a goal by Saudi player Fuad Amin in the 19th minute of the match before Jonk opened his World Cup scoring account by netting a 50th minute long-range effort from a good 35 metres out. Though the keeper could have saved the shot, it went in nonetheless, and the goal became one of the most spectacular of the tournament. The Dutch went on to win the match by a goal from Gaston Taument in the 86th minute. Jonk would score another goal against the Republic of Ireland from another long-range effort and a goalkeeping blunder, in a convincing 2‚Äì0 win to help the Dutch qualify for a quarter-final meeting with Brazil. Meanwhile, at Inter, he managed 54 appearances in two seasons and scored eight goals. He scored in a UEFA Cup Final again, this time as Inter won the 1994 final. However, when teammate Dennis Bergkamp left Inter for Arsenal at the end of the 1994‚Äì95 season, he felt that opportunities for a first team place at the Italian club seemed to be under threat (he was by then close to being 30 years old) and he went back to the Netherlands to sign with PSV. He stayed long enough at PSV to convince then manager Guus Hiddink to be selected for the 1998 World Cup in France, after being overlooked for Euro 1996. At the 1998 World Cup, Jonk played in five of the seven matches that the Netherlands played and did not score any goals. With the appointment of Frank Rijkaard as the new manager after the 1998 World Cup, Jonk's international career seemed to be over. However, he did play once more for the Netherlands in a friendly against Denmark on 18 August 1999. Jonk finished his international career on 49 caps and 11 goals. For the 1998‚Äì99 season, Jonk went to join Sheffield Wednesday for a fee of ¬£2.5 million, where he was a regular starter for the relegation-threatened side. Apparently, his once- impressive performances for both club and country had gone and he was frequently injured, which caused the Wednesday fans to voice dissent about a clause in his contract which stipulated that he would automatically receive ¬£7,500 per game which he would miss through injury. At the beginning of the 2000‚Äì01 season, he announced his retirement from the game.  Managerial career = Head of Academy = After his career as a player, Jonk featured as a football pundit on NOS Studio Sport, before returning to his childhood club FC Volendam as the board member for technical affairs. In this role, Jonk also worked as an individual trainer and assistant to the first and second team of FC Volendam. Between 2008 until November 2015, Jonk worked for Ajax. First as an individual technical skills trainer (2008‚Äì11), later as the Head of Academy and member of the technisch hart (\\"technical heart\\") (2011‚Äì15). In 2010, Jonk, Johan Cruyff and Ruben Jongkind wrote the Plan Cruyff which led to the so-called ‚Äòvelvet revolution‚Äô. In 2011, the Plan Cruyff was officially adopted as the new Ajax club policy. One of its core pillars was the fundamental reform of the Ajax youth academy, based on an individual approach in talent development. In concert with Cruyff as an advisor and Ruben Jongkind as Head of Talent Development, Jonk implemented this innovative vision between 2012 and 2015, sparking a rebirth of the academy including a new organisational structure and culture. During his time as Head of Academy, Jonk was a coach of a various Ajax youth teams, including Ajax Under 19. After ongoing disagreement between Jonk and Cruyff with the board of directors, about the interpretation and lack of implementation of the Plan Cruyff at the first team and in the overall club policy, Jonk left the club in December 2015, together with Johan Cruyff and a large group of key academy personnel. = Cruyff Football = As of September 2016, Jonk and Jordi Cruyff co-manage and lead the Amsterdam-based international football institute Cruyff Football. Cruyff Football, the official heir of the football legacy of Johan Cruyff, is responsible for managing, protecting, sharing, developing and implementing the Cruyff football vision and talent development philosophy worldwide, at both professional football clubs and national football federations. = Volendam = On 13 April 2019, Jonk was announced as the new manager of Eerste Divisie club FC Volendam.

C. Andrews. It is the first book in the Dollanganger Series, and was followed by Petals on the Wind, If There Be Thorns, Seeds of Yesterday, Garden of Shadows, Christopher's Diary: Secrets of Foxworth, Christopher's Diary: Echoes of Dollanganger and Christopher's Diary: Secret Brother. The novel is written in the first-person, from the point of view of Cathy Dollanganger. It was twice adapted into films in 1987 and 2014. The book was extremely popular, selling over forty million copies world-wide. Plot In 1957, the Dollanganger family lives an idyllic life in Gladstone, Pennsylvania until Mr. Dollanganger dies in a car accident, leaving his wife Corinne deep in debt with four children and no professional skills. The family is forced to move in with Corinne's wealthy parents, from whom she is estranged. Upon arrival at Corinne's ancestral home, Foxworth Hall, the family is greeted coldly by Corinne's mother Olivia, who sneaks them into a small bedroom connected to the attic. The children are told they must remain hidden from their grandfather, Malcolm, and can never leave this room. The older children, Cathy and Chris, attempt to make the best of the situation for their younger siblings, twins Carrie and Cory, by turning the attic into an imaginary garden. They are dismayed when Corinne returns after meeting with her parents and they see she has been savagely whipped. Corinne confesses that the children's dead father was her father's half-brother, and this incest is the cause of her and her parents' estrangement. Corinne plans to win back her father's love, and hopes to introduce the children once this has been accomplished. At first, Corinne visits her children daily, sometimes bringing expensive gifts. Meanwhile, Olivia emotionally and physically abuses the children, constantly threatening to whip them for any acts she considers \\"sinful\\". At Christmastime, Corinne allows Cathy and Chris to watch guests at Foxworth Hall from a hiding spot, where they see their grandfather for the first time and also see their mother with Bart Winslow, Malcolm's attorney. Their mother's visits then become less frequent as her emotional bond with the children weakens, to the point where she eventually slaps Chris and threatens to whip him. A year later, Cathy and Chris have both entered puberty and become surrogate parents for Carrie and Cory, who no longer recognize Corinne when she occasionally appears. While Cathy and Chris are both entering adulthood, the twins' physical growth is stunted from a lack of adequate nutrition, sunlight and fresh air. Despite personal shame, Cathy and Chris develop a physical attraction toward each other. Olivia catches Chris staring at a half-dressed Cathy and orders him to cut off Cathy's hair. Chris refuses, and Olivia abandons them for three weeks, driving them to near-starvation. When Cathy cuts her own hair, meals resume and now include sugared doughnuts as a surprise. Corinne visits the children for the first time in six months, explaining that she had been on a honeymoon with Bart in Europe. Cathy and Chris react angrily, but when Corinne threatens to never visit again, they pretend to be happy for her. Realizing that they cannot rely on their mother any longer, Chris and Cathy come up with an escape plan, sneaking into the house to steal money and valuables from their mother's room. One night, Cathy discovers her sleeping stepfather and kisses him. When Chris learns of the act, he is enraged and rapes Cathy. Afterwards, he is overcome with remorse, and Cathy forgives him by saying she wanted it too. Cory becomes very sick and Corinne agrees to take him to the hospital, though only after Cathy tells her that if Cory dies, she will find a way to make Corinne pay for it. The next day, Corinne returns and tells the children that Cory died, allegedly from pneumonia. Without warning, their mother and Bart move out. Eavesdropping on the servants, Chris learns that Malcolm died months ago and Olivia is now leaving out doughnuts sprinkled with rat poison in an attempt to clear the attic's \\"mouse\\" infestation. The three remaining children finally flee, catching a train to Florida. At the train station, Chris reveals he discovered Corinne's inheritance is conditional on her having no descendants from her first marriage, and she was poisoning them to secure her father's wealth. Chris and Cathy decide against contacting the police as their main concern is to stay together and protect Carrie, who is still a minor. Chris assures Cathy that they can make a new life without their mother, but Cathy swears to exact revenge one day.

Controversy The book's success was not without controversy. The depiction of incest between an adolescent brother and sister in the novel has led to its being banned in certain areas at different times. Chariho High School in Rhode Island removed it because it contained \\"offensive passages concerning incest and sexual intercourse.\\" In 1994, it was removed from the Oconee County, Georgia school libraries due to \\"the filthiness of the material.\\" Claims that the novel is based on a true story have been disputed. For many years, there was no evidence to support this claim, and the book was passed off as fiction. Nonetheless, the official V. C. Andrews website claims to have contacted one of Andrews' relatives. This unidentified relative claimed Flowers in the Attic was loosely based on a faintly similar account. While at the \\"University of Virginia hospital for treatment...she developed a crush on her young doctor. He and his siblings had been locked away in the attic for over 6 years to preserve the family wealth.\\" References Category:1979 American novels Category:American gothic novels Category:Novels by V.

The mountain forms a ridge, terminating in what was known anciently as the Trogilium promontory (Ancient Greek Œ§œÅœâŒ≥ŒØŒªŒπŒøŒΩ or Œ§œÅœâŒ≥œçŒªŒπŒøŒΩ).. Downloadable Google Books. There are several beaches on the north shore ranging from sand to pebbles. The south flank is mainly escarpment. In classical Greece nearly the entire ridge was a promontory enclosed by the Aegean Sea. Geopolitically it was part of Ionia with Priene placed on the coast on the south flank of the mountain and Miletus on the coast opposite to the south across the deep embayment into which the Maeander River drained. Somewhat further north was Ephesus. The ruins of the first two Ionian cities mentioned with their harbor facilities remain but today are several miles inland overlooking instead a rich agricultural plain and delta parkland created by deposition of sediments from the river, which continues to form the geological feature named after it, maeanders. The end of the former bay remains as a lake, √áami√ßi G√∂l√º (Lake Bafa). Samsun Daƒüi, or Mycale, still has a promontory. The entire ridge was designated as a national park in 1966; Dilek Yarimadisi Milli Parki (\\"Dilek Peninsula National Park\\") has , which is partly accessible to the public. The remainder is a military reservation. The park's isolation has encouraged the return of the native ecology, which is 60% maquis shrubland. It is a refuge for species that used to be more abundant in the region.  Geophysics  Mount Mycale seen from the island of Samos, across the Mycale Strait. Western Turkey is mainly fault-block terrain, with steep-sided ridges running east- west and rivers in the rifts. The source of the faulting is the closing of Tethys Sea and the collision of the African and Arabian plates with the Eurasian plate. The smaller Turkish and Aegean plates are being pushed together, generating ridges in Turkey. This orogenic belt was in place by 1.6 mya and continues to be a hot spot of earthquakes and volcanoes. Mount Mycale is part of a larger ridge, which continues in Samos on the other side of the Samos Strait, and to the northeast in the Aydin Daƒülari (\\"Aydin Mountains\\"), ancient Messogis range, on the other side of low hills and passes. The entire block of mountains around the Menderes (Maeander) River is known as the Menderes Massif. Mycale is scored transversely by numerous ravines through which sources drain. The biggest ravine is Oluk Gorge, with cliffs high. The main permanent streams are the Bal Deresi, the Sarap Dami and the Oluk Dereleri. The ample water supply supports a verdant maquis. The rock is primarily metamorphic: marble and limestone formed from rocks originating in the Mesozoic,crystalline schists formed from rocks originating in the Palaeozoic and conglomerates of the Cenozoic. The renowned builders and sculptors of Ionia made full use of these materials for their major works.  Ecology  Cypress in maquis. The ridge and its environs offer a number of different ecologies. The crest is a sharp divide between the xerophytic southern slopes and the forested northern slopes, with of maquis and of mixed pine. Around the base of the promontory is a maritime environment. The maquis vegetation includes Pistacia lentiscus; Laurus nobilis; Quercus ilex, Q. frainetto and Q. ithaburensis; Phillyrea latifolia; Ceratonia siliqua; Olea europaea; Rubus fruticosus; Myrtus communis; Smilax; Jasminum fruticans; Vitex vivifera; Lathyrus grandiflorus; Erica arborea; and Juncus on the slopes of the north. In moister areas are to be found Nerium oleander, Platanus orientalis, Fraxinus ornus, Laurus nobilis, Cupressus sempervirens and Rubus fruticosus. The mixed pine forest goes up to . Its major plant species are Pinus brutia, Juniperus phoenicea, with broad-leaved trees and shrubs: Ulmus campestris, Acer sempervirens, Fraxinus ornus, Castanea sativa, Tilia platyphyllos, Sorbus torminalis, Viburnum tinus, Pyrus eleagrifolia and Prunus dulcis. Some mammals native to the region are Sus scrofa, Vulpes vulpes, Hystrix cristata, Canis aureus, Canis lupus, Martes martes, Lynx lynx, Felis sylvestris, Ursus arctos, Meles meles, Lepus, Erinaceus europaeus and Sciurus. Migrants are Lynx caracal and Panthera pardus. Some birds are Columba livia, Alectoris graeca, Perdix perdix, Coturnix coturnix, Scolopax rusticola, Turdus merula, Turdus pilaris, Oriolus oriolus, Merops apiaster, eagles, vultures, Corvus corax, Pica pica and Sturnus vulgaris. Monachus monachus breeds in caves around the shores of Mycale. They and other marine predators (including man) feed on Liza, Pagellus, Dentex vulgaris and Thunnus thynnus.  History  Map of Mycale, Lade, and Miletus. = Earliest references = Mycale, Miletus and the Maeander appear in the Trojan Battle Order of the Iliad, where they are populated by Carians. \\"The steep heights of Mycale\\" and Miletus are also in the Hymn to Apollo, where Leto, pregnant with Apollo, an especially Ionian god, travels about the Aegean looking for a home for her son, and settles on Delos, the major Ionian political, religious and cultural center of Classical Greece. A similar metaphor is to be found in the centuries-later Hymn to Delos of Callimachus, in which Delos, a swimming island, visits various places in the Aegean, including Parthenia, \\"Maiden's Isle\\" (Samos), where it is entertained by the nymphs of Mycalessos. Just as Parthenia is the previous name of Samos so the reader is to understand Mycalessos as the previous name of Mycale. On being chosen as the birthplace of Apollo, Delos becomes fixed in the sea. There are no earlier instances of Mycale but some major Creto-Mycenaean cities, later Ionian, which appear in Mycenaean Greek and Hittite records of the Late Bronze Age. In Hitti language, there were the Achaean-Greek cities Apasa (Ephesus), the capital of a state called Arzawa, in which also was Karkisha in (Caria) and Millawanda (Miletus). In the Linear B script tablets the region is called A-swi-ja (Asia). Documents at Pylos, Thebes and Knossos identify female textile workers and seamstresses (raptria)in servitude of Mi-ra-ti-ja, *MilƒÅtiai, \\"Milesians.\\" The regions from which they came were centers of Mycenaean civilization although the languages they spoke was an early Greek-Mycenaean language and written in Linear B, although some support that was an unknown.. = The state of Melia = After the Late Bronze Age the entire Aegean region entered a historical period termed the Greek Dark Ages. Archaeologically it was known as the Proto- geometric and Geometric Periods, which did not belong to any one ethnic group. This is the time to which heavy Ionic migration from mainland Greece to the coast of Ionia and the emergence of Delos as an Ionian center is believed to apply. These events were over at the start of the brilliant renaissance of the Orientalizing Period in which Ionia played a cardinal role. During this rise to prominence twelve cities were settled or resettled and emerged as Ionia speaking varieties of Ionic Greek. Vitruvius, however, says there were thirteen, the extra state being Melite, which \\"... as a punishment of the arrogance of its citizens was detached from the other states in a war levied pursuant to the directions of a general council (communi consilio); and in its place ... the city of Smyrna was admitted into the number of Ionian states (inter Ionas est recepta).\\". There is no other mention of Melite anywhere but two fragments of Hecataeus say that Melia was a city of Caria and an inscription from Priene confirms that there had been a \\"Meliac War\\"Often called a Melian War but the latter should not be confused with the later war of Athens against the island of Melos. against a state located between Priene and Samos; i.e., on Mycale. The inscription records the result of an arbitration between Priene and Samos by jurors from Rhodes. Both litigants claimed that Carium, the fortified settlement of Melia, and Dryussa, another settlement, had been distributed to them at the conclusion of the Meliac War, when the Carians were expelled.Syll. 599 - in English translation. Being on the Samian side of the crest Melia had been resettled mainly by Samians and for this reason they had won a similar case brought before Lysimachus of Macedon a century earlier. That case is mentioned in an earlier inscription from Priene.RC. 7 - in English translation. Priene had now reopened the case arguing that their sale of plots from the land demonstrated their continuous ownership of it except for a brief period when an invasion of the Cimmerians under Lygdamus forced temporary Greek evacuation of the region (about 650 BC). The Samians used a passage from the now missing History of Maeandrius of Miletus to support their claim. The jury found that Maeandrius was not authentic and reversed the earlier decision.A discussion of the arbitration in English can be found at Downloadable Google Books. Most of the inscription can be found in Downloadable Google Books. = Panionium = The Melians had named their capital Carium, \\"of Caria\\" as a Greek word. Considering that it was placed in Ionia, the choice of name suggests a political statement of some sort, although the word may have had a different meaning in the Carian language, now lost except for a few dozen words. The Ionians leagued together to defeat it and continued the league, building a capital they called Panionium, \\"of all the Ionians\\" next to the former Carium. It rose to prominence while the Ionian confederacy was sovereign, became a memory when Ionia was incorporated into other states and empires and finally was lost altogether. The ancient writers remembered that it had been on the north side of the mountain, across the ridge from Priene. After a few false identifications in modern times, the ruins of Melia and the Panionium were discovered in 2004 on Dilek Daglari, a smaller peak of Mycale, to the north of Priene at an elevation of . The Carium must be the early 7th century BC town surrounded by a triangular wall in places as thick as . The floruit was the early 7th, but sherds have been found there from as early as the Protogeometric period. Coldstream characterizes the burial structures as of \\"a considerable Carian substrate.\\" The culture was not entirely Carian; the Ionians continued the worship of Poseidon Heliconius there, which Strabo says came from Helike in Peloponnesian Achaea. Strabo's contention (8.7.2, quoted on same page) that the \\"Akhaians later gave the model of the temple to the Ionians\\" cannot be true, as the submersion did not occur until 373 BC. This event must have been during the Ionian colonization. Melia therefore was a renegade Ionian state. The temple believed to the Panionium was constructed next to the Carium about 540 BC. It took over the worship of Poseidon Heliconius, served as the meeting place of the Ionian League, and was the site of the religious festival and games (panegyris) called the Panionia. The construction of this temple is a terminus post quem for the existence of the Ionian League, which as a constituted body had a name, the koinon I≈çn≈çn (\\"common thing of the Ionians\\"), a synedrion (\\"place to sit down together\\") and a boulƒì (\\"council\\"). Whether this body existed before the Meliac War is uncertain. Vitruvius' commune consilium seems to translate koinon. Some analysts have postulated an association as early as 800 BC but whether formally constituted remains unknown. There is no sign of it yet on Mycale unless Carium had in fact been it. = Battle of Mycale = In 479 BC, Mycale was the site of one of the two major battles that ended the second Persian invasion of Greece, during the Greco-Persian Wars. Under the leadership of the Spartan Leotychides, the Greek fleet defeated the Persian fleet and army.Pausanias, 1.25.1, 3.7.9, 8.52.3; Thucydides, 1.89. According to Herodotus, the battle occurred the same day as the Greek victory at Plataea.Herodotus, 9.90, 9.96.  Notes  References  * Herodotus, Histories, A. D.

In 1991, the BJCC began an ambitious expansion plan for the complex, which included a modern 398-room addition, complete with an atrium and a skywalk to the main exhibition hall in the convention center, along with a new 1,000-space parking deck behind the hotel. During the renovation and expansion, the hotel operated as a Ramada. It officially opened its doors as a Sheraton in early 1992. The expansion featured two new restaurants, an indoor pool and exercise area constructed above the porte-cochere, additional meeting/reception space, and three new Presidential suites. Other changes included the shuttering of the rooftop restaurant and original Presidential suite, which remain unused to this day. In 1998, the hotel was brought into the Starwood system and a new 25,000-square foot (2,323 square meter) grand ballroom was constructed, along with a minor freshening to the hotel lobby and other public spaces. In 2005, a $16 million renovation was announced and included the addition of new retail space, complete refurbishment of all guest rooms and public areas, and renovation of hotel systems. In 2016, a $2.5 million renovation of the hotel began. Guest rooms and all elevator lobbies will be renovated and refurbished.

The city lies at an altitude of 913 metres, on the centre of the Hoya of Guadix, a high plain at the northern foothills of the Sierra Nevada. It is located on the Madrid-Valdepe√±as-Almer√≠a railway. The city was once famous for its cutlery; but its modern manufactures (chiefly earthenware, hempen goods, and hats) are relatively unimportant. It has some trade in wool, cotton, flax, corn and liqueurs. The warm mineral springs of Cortes y Graena, much frequented during the summer, are 6 miles west. History=Ancient= Guadix el Viejo, 6 km northwest, was the Roman Acci (also Accitum) mentioned in Pliny's Natural History and as Akki by Ptolemy, who placed it among the Bastetani, whose capital was Basti. It is not known for certain whether it is of Phoenician or of early Spanish origin. According to Macrobius, the primitive inhabitants paid homage to Mars under the name of Neton. Julius Caesar established the Roman colony called Julia Gemella. According to tradition, it was the seat of the first bishopric in Hispania, in the 2nd century. =From the Moors to the Reconquista= After 711 it rose to some importance as a Moorish fortress and trading station, renamed Wadi 'Ashi (\\"the Wadi of Acci\\").

Plot The story concerns the love and marriage of a young girl, Mashechka (17 years old), and the much older Sergey Mikhaylych (36), an old family friend. The story is narrated by Masha. After a courtship that has the trappings of a mere family friendship, Masha's love grows and expands until she can no longer contain it. She reveals it to Sergey Mikhaylych and discovers that he also is deeply in love. If he has resisted her it was because of his fear that the age difference between them would lead the very young Masha to tire of him. He likes to be still and quiet, he tells her, while she will want to explore and discover more and more about life. Ecstatically and passionately happy, the pair immediately engages to be married. Once married they move to Mikhaylych's home. They are both members of the landed Russian upper class. Masha soon feels impatient with the quiet order of life on the estate, notwithstanding the powerful understanding and love that remains between the two. To assuage her anxiety, they decide to spend a few weeks in St. Petersburg. Sergey Mikhaylych agrees to take Masha to an aristocratic ball. He hates \\"society\\" but she is enchanted with it. They go again, and then again. She becomes a regular, the darling of the countesses and princes, with her rural charm and her beauty. Sergey Mikhaylych, at first very pleased with Petersburg society's enthusiasm for his wife, frowns on her passion for \\"society\\"; but he does not try to influence Masha. Out of respect for her, Sergey Mikhaylych will scrupulously allow his young wife to discover the truth about the emptiness and ugliness of \\"society\\" on her own. But his trust in her is damaged as he watches how dazzled she is by this world. Finally they confront each other about their differences. They argue but do not treat their conflict as something that can be resolved through negotiation. Both are shocked and mortified that their intense love has suddenly been called into question. Something has changed. Because of pride, they both refuse to talk about it. The trust and the closeness are gone. Only courteous friendship remains. Masha yearns to return to the passionate closeness they had known before Petersburg. They go back to the country. Though she gives birth to children and the couple has a good life, she despairs. They can barely be together by themselves. Finally she asks him to explain why he did not try to guide and direct her away from the balls and the parties in Petersburg. Why did they lose their intense love? Why don't they try to bring it back? His answer is not the answer she wants to hear, but it settles her down and prepares her for a long life of comfortable \\"Family Happiness\\". Critical reception In Russia the initial response to Family Happiness was lukewarm. The newspaper Sankt- Peterburgskiye Vedomosti (the July 1859, No. 155 issue) and the magazine Severny Tsvetok (Northern Flower, No. 22 1859) published positive, but very brief reviews. The major pro-democracy publications failed to mentioned its release, much chagrined, apparently, by the fact that Tolstoy chose for the publication the right-wing Katkov-edited journal which at the time was engaged in bitter feuds with Sovremennik. Three years later in an essay called \\"The Outstanding Works Overlooked by Our Critics\\" (Vremya, Nos. 1 and 9) Apollon Grigoriev made an attempt to 'rehabilitate' the Family Happiness and called it Tolstoy's \\"best piece of work to date\\". Sovremennik (1865, No.4) retaliated by warning the \\"critics of the aesthetic school\\" against praising the backward- looking novel which was idealizing the ruling class's way of life. According to the Soviet scholar Vladimir Lakshin, \\"Grigoriev was right in crediting Tolstoy as a shrewd psychologist, who'd succeeded in portraying so vividly in this novella 'the way romantic passion gradually deteriorates into something completely different'\\".Vladimir Lakshin. Commentaries to Family Happiness. The Works of L.N. Tolstoy in 12 Vols. Vol.3. Stories and novellas, 1857-1863. Pp. 408-409 In popular culture A passage of the book is quoted in the book and film Into the Wild: \\"I have lived through much, and now I think I have found what is needed for happiness. A quiet secluded life in the country, with the possibility of being useful to people to whom it is easy to do good, and who are not accustomed to have it done to them; then work which one hopes may be of some use; then rest, nature, books, music, love for one's neighbor‚Äîsuch is my idea of happiness. And then, on top of all that, you for a mate, and children perhaps‚Äîwhat more can the heart of man desire?\\" Another passage is also quoted in the book Into the Wild: The last page of the story is also quoted in full in the Philip Roth novel The Counterlife.

It was developed by Midway Studios Austin and published by Midway for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows. A Nintendo GameCube version was also in development but was silently canceled. It is a loose remake of the 1995 light gun video game of the same name, and was followed in 2007 by the loosely related BlackSite: Area 51. The player controls Ethan Cole, a HAZMAT operative sent to the Area 51 base to assist in the cleanup of a mutagenic virus. Notable among the voice actors are David Duchovny as Ethan Cole, Marilyn Manson as Edgar the ancient and powerful Grey, Powers Boothe as Major Bridges, Nolan North as McCan, and Ian Abercrombie as Dr. Winston Cray. Gameplay Area 51 is a first-person shooter, played from the perspective of the protagonist, Ethan Cole. The game features operable machinery, including artillery turrets, besides the player's inventory of weapons. Throughout the game, the player uses a variety of weapons, both human and alien in origin, to defeat their adversaries. Most weapons can only be wielded one handed, however the player can dual wield some weapons, such as the Shotgun and the Sub- Machine Gun. Each weapon can also be used as a melee weapon for close quarter combat. Each weapon has two modes of firing, the first being the primary method, while the second is of a much higher power level, at the cost of ammunition and accuracy to the player. The player can also use explosive grenades. Midway through the game, Ethan Cole becomes infected with the mutagen, and the option to turn into a mutant temporarily is obtained. Mutating offers a variety of benefits, such as increased strength, stamina, as well as the initial ability to fire health-replenishing parasites as well as the later ability to contaminate enemies, both at the cost of mutation time reduction. While in a mutant form, players can easily spot enemies, which would otherwise be cloaked to the regular human eye, albeit with a slight ocular defect. Players can replenish health and mutagen either through the use of medical syringes found throughout the game or by using parasites, and mutagen by melee combat or \\"using\\" infected corpses, or by finding mutagen syringes. A notable aspect of gameplay is the ability to scan and analyze various objects in the game environment. This is possible by using the scanner present on the player's suit, worn throughout the game. While using a scanner, the player has no access to weapons, and must switch to an available weapon in order to fight (though they could still melee). Scanning provides detailed information on a player's surroundings, as well as combated enemies. The scanner, when equipped, adds a translucent bar to the player's HUD, which changes in color and height from light blue, to deep red. This bar indicates how near or far a player is, to one of many scannable clues, such as file folders or personal digital assistants. The scanner can collect information from the items without it being touched. The HUD shows red when the player is very close, and blue when very far. Items which are scanned are viewable in- game, providing insight into the workings of Area 51, as well as proving necessary to unlocking secret videos made by Dr. Cray or Mr. White. Plot In July 1947, an alien spacecraft crashed near Roswell, New Mexico in the United States. The craft was recovered by the U.S. Air Force and taken to Area 51 in Nevada, where the lone survivor of the crash, a powerful Grey named Edgar (Marilyn Manson), was held captive by the U.S. military. Eventually, the Greys opened a dialogue with the Illuminati led by the ominous Mr. White (Phil Proctor), and struck a deal with them. The Illuminati would give the Greys a research base 3 miles below the surface of Area 51, the use of the base as a landing site, and give them human test subjects where they, along with human scientists, would research a mutagenic virus to use in a war on their homeworld. In return the Greys would give the Illuminati exclusive access to Grey technology. The Illuminati used some of this technology to spy on the population. The Greys and the human scientists eventually developed a powerful alien being - known as the \\"Theta\\", which spread the virus. Unbeknownst to many of the scientists working on the project, the Greys and the Illuminati were also planning to use the virus against the Earth population and dominate the planet. When Dr. Winston Cray (Ian Abercrombie) found out about the plan, he let loose the \\"Theta\\" and the mutagenic virus throughout Area 51, in an effort to slow them down. This prompted the military to send in a Quick Reaction Force led by Major Bridges (Powers Boothe) to quarantine and contain the virus. HAZMAT Team Delta, the first team initially sent into Area 51 are ambushed by the \\"Theta\\" creature, sustaining casualties, before withdrawing deeper into the base. HAZMAT Team Bravo, composed of team leader Ramirez, McCan, Crispy, and mission specialist Ethan Cole (David Duchovny) is sent to find Delta. After initially encountering the mutants, McCan is killed when a mutant decapitates him. Deeper into the base, Crispy and Ramirez are both ambushed by the Theta and killed, leaving Cole on his own. Cole manages to locate the rest of Delta, however they are attacked again by the Theta, and all but Cole and Lieutenant Chew are killed. Making their way topside, the Illuminati disables the cargo elevator, killing Chew and leaving Cole bitten by one mutant, partially mutating him. Able to switch between human and mutant form, Cole is guided deeper into the base by Edgar reanimating corpses to deliver information telepathically. Cole is guided to Dr. Cray's bio labs, where Cray claims there is time to decontaminate Cole, and rid him of the virus. Before he can be cured, the Illuminati attack, killing Cray and stopping the process. Cole proceeds deeper underground into a cave system, where he eventually gets reacquainted with the Theta. He manages to kill the creature, avenging both his team and HazTeam Delta. He meets Edgar miles beneath the surface who reveals the scientists used his DNA to create the virus, and the nature of the experiments at the base, which killed dozens of his species to harvest it. He then tells Cole the history of the Greys and Area 51. Edgar gives Cole the cure to the mutagenic virus, and instructs him to destroy the Grey's ship, that is leaving with dozens of Theta duplicates. Cole locates the vessel and destroys it by overloading its reactor, and uses a teleporter to escape into the Nevada desert. He lands by the \\"White Mailbox\\" area and watches Area 51 being destroyed by the exploding ship in a tornado like explosion. Cole watches as a truck drives past, with a green, alien-like container on board with unknown contents inside and walks away from the site. He reflects upon his original purpose at Area 51 and recognizes that while he and Hazmat Team Bravo had failed, their sacrifices may have saved mankind. Reception The PlayStation 2 version received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", while the PC and Xbox versions received \\"average reviews\\", according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Film In 2004, ahead of the game's release, Paramount Pictures announced that they had reached an agreement concerning the film rights for the game. In March 2007, comic book author Grant Morrison was hired to adapt the game as a screenplay. This project is unrelated to the movie Area 51 by Oren Peli.

It is the most direct southerly route from the island of Montreal toward the US border. It carries Route 138, originally Route 4. It is in length and contains four steel trusses on its first section. The height of the bridge varies from to with the highest sections located over the St. Lawrence Seaway. The bridge is named after former premier of Quebec Honor√© Mercier. Unique in Quebec, the bridge is managed by both the federal and provincial governments. The southwest portion of the bridge, over 1,031 metres (1128 yards) from the beginning of the arch bridge (at pile14), is the responsibility of a Crown corporation: the Jacques Cartier and Champlain Bridges Incorporated (JCCBI). The rest of the bridge (902 meters, 986 yards) is owned by the Quebec Ministry of Transport, which is also responsible for the day-to-day operations of the complex, including the federal part. The bridge has two lanes of traffic in each direction and a total span of nearly two kilometres (1¬º miles). At its highest point, the bridge rises 36 metres (120') above the river. There is a narrow sidewalk on the side headed to Ch√¢teauguay that was for use by foot or bicycle, but it has not been open since major repairs began in 2009. The roadway has been characterized by numerous repairs. It is estimated that an average of 75,000 vehicles use the bridge each day. An estimated 30 million vehicles use the bridge every year. History Honor√© Mercier bridge at sunset Bridge in 1948 Before the bridge was built there was a ferry service. The bridge, known in the developmental stage as the \\"Saint-Louis Bridge\\" (for the nearby located Lake Saint-Louis and the parish of Saint-Louis-de- Caughnawaga, today part of the Kahnawake reserve), was designed by eleven French-Canadian engineers, all graduates of the √âcole Polytechnique de Montr√©al, and was built by the Dominion Bridge Company Ltd under a government- funded work program. Construction of the bridge began in November 1932 and was completed in the early summer of 1934. It was opened to traffic on June 22, 1934 (named \\"Honor√©-Mercier\\" during its inauguration by mayor Taschereau, 10 months ahead of schedule with a toll of 50 cents for an automobile and driver‚Äîlater reduced to 25 cents. Today there is no toll charged for crossing the bridge. The original east approach was on Lafleur Avenue, which ran straight into the Gauron Bridge over the Lachine Canal. The higher section over the Saint Lawrence Seaway was added in the late 1950s. In August 1963, the Quebec Department of Public Works approved the construction of a \\"second\\" bridge downstream from the first. This increased the number of lanes from two to four. =Oka Crisis= Underneath the Mercier Bridge in Kahnawake. During the Oka Crisis in July and August 1990, the bridge was closed to all traffic for over a month by Mohawks who supported their brothers from Kanesatake. This closure period led to violent tempers and clashes between Mohawks and people from Ch√¢teauguay, and the extension of Autoroute 30 bypassing the Kahnawake reserve. As a compensatory measure, the Champlain Bridge Boom was opened to motorists and a temporary rail shuttle was introduced. =Mohawks in Support of the Caledonia Group= During the Caledonia land dispute, certain individuals from Kahnawake erected Warrior and Confederacy flags on the steel trusses of the bridge to show their support. The bridge was closed for a short period, in order to allow several men from the community to climb the structure and secure the flags. To ensure their safety, the Kahnawake Peacekeepers stopped traffic from the Kahnawake side of the bridge, while the Quebec Provincial Police blocked access on the Lasalle side. Several weeks later one of the Warrior flags was removed from the bridge and replaced with a Quebec flag (the red Warrior flag is barely visible in the above picture between the first 'V' section of the truss). On June 29, 2007, community members of Kahnawake staged a peaceful protest on the bridge, in support of the AFN's National Day of Action. Once again men from the community placed Warrior and Confederacy flags on the structure that spans the St. Lawrence Seaway.  Maintenance  The Jacques Cartier and Champlain Bridges Incorporated (JCCBI) (in French: Ponts Jacques Cartier et Champlain Incorpor√©e, PJCCI), a federal Crown corporation, is responsible for managing, operating and maintaining the Mercier Bridge where it crosses the Mohawk Reserve of Kahnawake. This comprises the ramps leading to the bridge on the south shore (\\"Ramps\\" Sector), the span over the St. Lawrence Seaway (\\"Seaway\\" Sector), and the stretch above \\"Ile Maline\\" (\\"B1 Island\\" Sector). The Ministry of Transport of Quebec (MTQ) is responsible for the bridge where it crosses the St. Lawrence River (\\"B2\\" Sector). =Rehabilitation Project= 2009 saw the start of a complete rehabilitation of the bridge, the largest ever undertaken in Canada. For the first time since 1934, the deck of the Mercier Bridge will be partially replaced. The work is expected to prolong the bridge's life for another 75 years. The bridge deck will be replaced using prefabricated concrete deck panels. The new deck will consist of more than 1,300 prefabricated concrete panels assembled with steel tension cables. In total, the new deck is an area of 40,684 m2 (10 acres). Numerous lane closures and redirection of traffic is expected to continue until work is completed. The project has been carried out in two parts: Phase A, replacement of the deck in the Ramps Section and Phase B, replacement of the deck in the B1, Seaway, and Mixed Sections. Phase A was handled by Kahnawake's Mohawk Bridge Consortium. Phase B was originally to be done by Pomerleau-de Mathieu Bard, but problems led to the removal of the contractor. The works were then completed by the Mohawk Bridge Consortium. The eight-year work on the federal part, led by contractor, Mohawk Bridge Consortium, was completed by the end of August 2016. A total of 982 new concrete panels were installed at a cost of $200 million. =Emergency closure= The Quebec Ministry of Transport (MTQ) initially planned to renovate the section of the bridge under its jurisdiction at the same time and in the same manner as the federal section. On June 14, 2011, due to the extreme deterioration of 10 gusset plates, the 1930s section of the Mercier bridge was closed until September 6 (in time for school restart). Engineers examined each gusset and designed an individual solution of either replacement or reinforcement aimed as a permanent solution, not a patch. Regular inspections found the gussets to be corroded beyond what was expected. Using all known weaknesses of the bridge structure, the engineers undertook a complete recalculation of the load bearing ability of the structure. Once they calculated that and factored in a margin for safety, they decided to close the bridge at 8:04 PM on June 14, 2011. The reinforcement of existing structures was staggered until 2013. In 2014, an in-depth study was commissioned to a consortium of BPR, Genivar and SNC-Lavalin firms to determine the optimal solution for the future of the section. Provincial Bridge: Major Rehabilitation or Reconstruction. In April 2017, the Quebec government announced the construction of a new section towards the South Shore of Montreal. The date of the beginning of the work is not determined, but it will begin sometime in 2019, once the construction of the new Champlain Bridge is completed.

The group was originally formed in 1954 as the Dance-Percussion Trio, to accompany performances by the modern dancer Daniel Nagrin; Nagrin was a member of the trio along with the pianist David Shapiro and the percussionist Ronald Gould. The group toured the United States in June and July 1954. Following this tour, the Dance-Percussion Trio disbanded and the musicians added a second percussionist, Arnold Goldberg, thus forming a trio of two percussionists and a pianist. Shapiro was later replaced by Rolf Barnes, though he later rejoined the group. The trio commissioned a number of new works from contemporary composers, including Harold Farberman (Variations for Percussion With Piano, 1954), Halim El-Dabh (Hindi-Yaat no. 1 and Tabla-Tahmeel no. 1, both 1959, and Tabla-Dance, 1961), and Gitta Steiner (Trio, 1969). They were one of the first American percussion ensembles to utilize traditional percussion instruments from India (including tabla and mridangam), which Gould brought back following a 1959 tour of that nation with The Little Orchestra Society of New York. The group's primary focus was presenting percussion music to young people (ranging in age from kindergarten to the college level), with most of their performances arranged by the Young Audiences, Inc. organization of New York. Through their performances across the United States (3,000 in all), the group did much to promote percussion music to the general public. They released an LP recording, entitled Holidays for Percussion (Vox, 1958), and a film, Percussion, the Pulse of Music (produced by Arts and Audiences, Inc., for the Educational Television and Radio Center, 1957), and appeared on the I've Got a Secret television program, hosted by Steve Allen, on January 24, 1966, as well as several other television programs, particularly those for children. In addition to their work with the trio, Goldberg and Gould served for many years as members of the New York City Ballet Orchestra and the orchestras of the Martha Graham Dance Company and Joffrey Ballet; Gould retired from his post with the New York City Ballet Orchestra in 2005 and Goldberg remains with the orchestra as timpanist and orchestra manager. Shapiro was also active as a pianist, orchestra conductor, and opera producer in South Korea, Hong Kong, and the United States. In the 1960s, a Boston, Massachusetts-based group called the New Boston Percussion Ensemble, also comprising two percussionists (James Latimer and Everett Beale) and a pianist (Allen Barker), was formed. This group also performed programs for the Young Audiences organization and performed some of the same repertoire as the New York Percussion Trio.

It is the first installment in the Sengoku Basara franchise. The original game's theme song is \\"Crosswise\\" by T.M.Revolution. The game was followed by several sequels and an anime series, all of them using the original title and setting of Sengoku Basara only. Story Sengoku Basara takes place during the Sengoku period, or Warring States period, of feudal Japan during which Japan was split into many minor states battling over power and land. The game features two historical warlords as the main protagonists: Date Masamune and Sanada Yukimura. Devil Kings' main character is Devil King (Oda Nobunaga in Sengoku Basara). Gameplay It is a hack and slash, action game similar in concept to Devil May Cry and Samurai Warriors. Some significant gameplay changes were made to the Western versions of the game. Four of the characters were made non-playable and various weapons were removed or added. The difficulty levels were shifted to make the game more difficult (with the Japanese Normal becoming Easy and Japanese Hard becoming Normal). The fighting system was also modified, adding an element called \\"Priming\\" (one of the characters special attack was made the priming attack, and used that attack to \\"Prime\\" enemies making them more susceptible to damage and allowing for higher combo chains).

An extract from IGN interview with the game's producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi: :Kobayashi: In Japan, Devil Kings is called Sengoku Basara, and it focuses on Japanese history but with a Capcom style, a Capcom flair to it. When we were making the game, we told ourselves, \\"What can we do to differentiate this to make this different from other hack and slash games?\\" And we decided the secret maybe lay in some other games Capcom has done. We said, \\"Let's give the characters a kind of Devil May Cry flair -- some really cool moves, like the kind of things you might see in Devil May Cry. Let's make the characters all vastly and distinctly different from one another, like in Street Fighter II.\\" That's the Japanese version. Then, we said, \\"Okay, let's release it in North America and Europe -- what can we do to make it different again? What can we do to make it appeal to North American and European audiences?\\" After a few discussions, we decided not to have a game with samurais and ninjas in feudal Japan, but instead a game that was dark, slightly devilish, and had a fantasy setting to it, a game with a huge Devil May Cry feel to it. So then we said, \\"Okay, we'll make it dark.\\" Call it Devil Kings. The main character will be a villain. We'll darken up the background, give more moves, more ability to power your character up, and things like that for the North American and European markets. :IGN: Plus it's not historically accurate? :Kobayashi: The Japanese version of the game is based on Japanese history. There are some fantasy elements that didn't actually happen, of course, but enough of it is there. With the North American and European versions, we've taken that element out entirely. Some of the backgrounds may retain that Japanese flair. Many of them don't and are brand new; many of the enemies are brand new; and it's no longer based around the idea of feudal Japan at all. That part of the game has now been changed to be darker. These alterations were regarded as unpopular, as the Devil Kings version was a critical and commercial failure, and no more Sengoku Basara games were brought to North America and Europe until the release of Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes in the fall of 2010. Reception The westernized version (Devil Kings) received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The Japanese version was met with \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from fans, critics, and consumers. Fans of the franchise seem to have given the Japanese version positive reviews and the westernized version negative reviews with one stating, \\"While Sengoku Basara was considered a cult classic among fans and gamers, Devil Kings was considered a terrible localization of a good game that should've been left unchanged for its western releases.\\" The game received an 8/8/7/8 for a total of 31/40 from weekly Japanese video game magazine, Famitsu. The game was later re-released under the PlayStation 2 the Best label (which means it is a best- seller in Japan). The game sold a total of 88,711 units during its first week on sale in Japan and was the top-selling game of the week. The game has sold a total of 232,589 units in Japan. Sequels The first two sequels, Sengoku Basara 2 and Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes, were released in Japan for the PS2 in 2006‚Äì2007, followed by two spin-off games. The next main game in the series, Sengoku Basara 3, was announced for the PlayStation 3 and Wii and released on July 29, 2010 in Japan. It was released in North America and Europe as Sengoku Basara Samurai Heroes in October 2010.

Reynolds High School would serve the youth of the city, the Auditorium would serve the entire community and act as a gathering place in order for all citizens to participate in the arts. The building of the Auditorium only added to the City of Winston-Salem's reputation as the \\"City of the Arts.\\" The building was completed in 1924. By the time it was dedicated in a glorious ceremony on May 8, 1924, Katharine Reynolds, who had married J. Edward Johnston in 1921, was hospitalized with a difficult pregnancy. She died on May 23, never having attended a production in the auditorium she had built in her first husband's memory. A few weeks later, the first commencement exercises for the Richard J. Reynolds High School would be held in the Auditorium. On November 24, 1924, the Auditorium would play host to the first of its many famous guests, Harry Houdini. Other guests have included Jim Croce before his untimely death and pianist Peter Nero, both in the early 1970s. Architectural and artistic elements The Grand Lobby of the Auditorium contains many pieces of art unique to the building itself. In the Lobby, one can find two large portraits, one of R. J. Reynolds and the other of Katharine Smith Reynolds. The portraits were made by Richard J. Reynolds High School graduate Joe King who also had the honor of creating a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. The Grand Lobby also contains three marble statues. The statues are duplicates of famous Italian works and were sculpted in Italy and transported to the United States, specifically for the construction of the Auditorium. Within the main Orchestra level of the Auditorium, one can see a portrait of R. J. Reynolds III, whose family gave large amounts of money towards the renovation and restoration of the building (2000-2002). Before the 2000-2002 renovation and restoration of the building, a large piece of custom made carpet sat just inside the Main Orchestra level at the middle doors leading from the Grand Lobby. The carpet piece featured a large tobacco leaf, in honor of R. J. Reynolds and his R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. The carpet piece was removed during the renovation and restoration and never replaced, with it being decided that the money could be better used toward upgrading the state of the art Auditorium sound system rather than buying a new custom made carpet piece. Traditions associated with the Auditorium and School Before every performance at the Auditorium, members of the student-run Auditorium Technical Staff and Crew place roses under the portrait of Katherine Smith Reynolds-Johnston, in honor of her gift of the Auditorium and school. It is rumored the roses also help to ward off the \\"ghost\\" of Katharine Reynolds who haunts the building. The title of the school hymn, originally written as the school song in 1933, \\"Her Portals Tall and Wide,\\" refers to the large columns of the Auditorium. The Auditorium's portico and columns stand at three stories tall and face downtown Winston-Salem. The current school song, with its official title of \\"Alma Mater,\\" is also known as \\"Amid the Pines.\\" Part of the first verse reads, \\"Amid the pines, she proudly stands; to her our voices rise.\\" The Auditorium and School are situated on a large hill populated with grandiose pine trees which cover the entire campus. The pine trees are also mentioned in the school hymn: \\"Her pleasant paths, her trees, whisper courage through the breeze.\\" Following every assembly, PTSA meeting or school performance inside the Auditorium, at one time including commencement, \\"The Alma Mater\\" is sung. During these assemblies, semi-formal or business casual dress, usually including blazers, shirts and ties for men, is customary attire for any person gracing the Auditorium's large stage. Tradition dictates that as the Alma Mater is sung, upon the line ending with \\"... dear Old Reynolds High\\", in three short beats, in a 3/4 time, the assembly should not stomp their feet because it is considered disrespectful. Through the years, the hill upon which the school and Auditorium stand has become known as \\"Society Hill.\\" The name commemorates the donation of the land and money to build the Auditorium and school from Mrs. Reynolds. a prominent member of the community. Generations of children, including some of the Reynolds' own children and Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) (class of 1974), have attended the school. Current operations The auditorium is currently managed by Elizabeth May and serves as a venue for the Winston-Salem Forsyth County School System and private renters. It has received many off-Broadway productions and local dance companies. The drama department at Reynolds is currently taught by Teri Beadle who teaches out of the Black Box Theater. The orchestra director is currently Margaret Rehder, and the band director is Johnathan Hamiel with assistant Adrian Thompson. Caitie Reece and Amelia Hailey are the current dance teachers. All teach in the Arts building adjacent to the main Auditorium. The chorus director is Joshua Settlemyre, who teaches in the chorus room, also adjacent to the main part of the Auditorium. The Choral, Orchestra, Band and Dance Departments all use the Auditorium regularly for performances. See also *Richard J. Reynolds High School *R. J. Reynolds *R. J.

It concerns a ruthless femme-fatale who steals a suitcase containing US$60,000 ($ today). The screenplay was written by Roy Huggins, developed from a serial he wrote for the Saturday Evening Post. The film was reissued as Killer Bait in 1955. Too Late for Tears has been in the public domain for many years; there are several different edits of the film with different running times. On January 25, 2014, a restored 35mm print was premiered by the Film Noir Foundation at Noir City 12 at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco. The film was restored by UCLA Film and Television Archive and the Film Noir Foundation, with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association providing some of the necessary funding. The restoration combined 35mm dupe negative elements from France with some material from surviving 35mm and 16mm prints.Jeremy Arnold, ‚ÄúToo Late for Tears (1949)‚Äù, TCM.com (Retrieved 2018-12-25.) Plot Don DeFore and Lizabeth Scott Jane and Alan Palmer are driving to a party in the Hollywood Hills when someone in another car throws a Gladstone bag into the back seat of their convertible. They open it and discover bundles of cash. With Jane at the wheel, they are chased by another car driven, Alan deduces, by the person who was supposed to receive the money. Jane drives recklessly, making a high speed turn and zig-zagging on the difficult road. They manage to lose their pursuer and Alan takes over. As they drive back into town, they discuss what to do about the money. Jane wants to keep it but Alan feels it is probably a blackmail payoff and the police should have it. He has a chance to hand it over, but does not, when an officer stops him for failing to use his turn signal. Back at their Hollywood apartment, they examine what Alan estimates to be $100,000 in cash. Jane eventually convinces her husband that they should hide the cash for a week; she claims to be fine with whatever he decides to do. They stash the satchel at the baggage claim at Union Station, the claim ticket seemingly ends up in the lining of Alan's coat. The next day, while Alan is at work and as Jane is hiding packages containing things she has purchased with the money in mind, Danny shows up. He claims to be a detective and says he needs to look around the place. He does not say why and he has no warrant, but says he can get one if that is what she prefers. She allows him to go ahead. He discovers the packages, one containing a fur coat, and says, \\"So you've already started spending it, huh?\\". Clearly not a detective but actually the man for whom the money was intended, Danny slaps Jane around a bit and demands to know where the money is. She lies, telling him that she and Alan have surrendered it to the police. He promises to return if there is no news in the evening paper about money being handed over to the cops. Alan returns home and tells her their banker phoned to let him know that their account is several hundred dollars down. She responds that she has only been buying things she needed. Alan threatens to send the claim ticket to the District Attorney's office right away; Jane threatens to take the money and run off. During their argument, he brings up her previous marriage to a man named Blanchard, who apparently died by suicide, and immediately is sorry. Jane feels she was always meant to have money, that she married Blanchard because she thought he had a lot of it; Alan believes peace of mind is more important, that they will not have that with the money in their possession. Nevertheless, he agrees to hang on to it for the rest of the agreed-to week. He suggests that the next evening they go out together and enjoy themselves the way they used to. Danny returns the next day, letting himself into the apartment using a skeleton key. Jane tells him that Alan has the money and is planning to give it to the authorities. She explains how she does not intend to allow him to do that, that she is determined to keep it. She and Danny make a deal to split the money; he gives her a number where he can be reached. Later, when she has made up her mind about what to do, Jane phones Danny and tells him to wait that night at the palm tree at the west end of Westlake Park, near downtown Los Angeles. As part of their romantic evening, Alan and Jane rent a boat. Inside her purse, Jane has packed her husband's gun. While out on the water, she appears to feel a pang of guilt; she blurts out that she wants to give the money up, that she wants to send the claim ticket in right away. Alan tries to take his wife's mind off the topic. He wants a cigarette and picks up her purse to look for some; his gun falls out. A struggle ensues and Alan is shot dead. Jane takes control of the boat and, as per their arrangement, meets Danny. He sees the body and resists being involved in a murder, but Jane has the gun on him and promises to tell the police he killed her husband unless he helps her. After dumping the body in the lake, weighted by the boat's anchor, Jane and Danny leave the boat launch together - he has on Alan's coat and hat - so as to mislead witnesses into assuming she left with her husband. She extends the ruse by having Danny drive back to her apartment; she makes sure the parking garage attendant believes Alan is in the car. Having arranged to meet Danny later that night, to supposedly retrieve the money from its burial site, Jane first invites Alan's sister, Kathy - who lives across the hall - over for a nightcap. She tells Kathy that Alan has just gone out to pick up a bottle of liquor. As time goes on and Alan does not return, Jane begins to feign worry and fear. She phones the police to report him as a missing person. Kathy realizes that the couple has plenty of liquor in the apartment and questions why Alan would have gone to purchase more. Jane tries to tell her sister-in-law that their marriage is on the rocks. Kathy does not buy this and says she believes Alan will be home soon. When Kathy goes home, Jane picks up Danny and they drive up into the hills. Once up there, he figures that she plans to kill him. After a near-accident and she stops the car, Danny flees, after saying, \\"You didn't bury that dough, and I know it\\". He is still wearing the coat that has in its lining the claim ticket. Jane abandons the car. Later, she locates Danny's residence and goes there, asking for Alan's coat. Danny discovers a blank piece of paper in the lining and Jane realizes the ticket must be at home. Meanwhile, having used her personal key to the Palmer's apartment, Kathy is searching the place; she has her suspicions about Jane. She finds the claim ticket in a dresser drawer. As she opens the door to leave, she comes face-to-face with a man who introduces himself as Don Blake, an old Army Air Corps buddy of Alan's on vacation in Los Angeles. Kathy tells him that Alan is missing. Later, while Jane is looking around her apartment for the claim ticket, a police lieutenant comes to report that the Palmer vehicle was in a near-accident the previous night and that a man got out of the car and left the scene. The implication is that it was Alan and another woman. The vehicle has been located and the matter appears to be closed, but not for Kathy, who all but says that she has doubts about her sister-in-law. Don arrives and, in the course of their conversation, Jane quizzes him on his experience in England with Alan during the war; his answers are not convincing. After he leaves, Jane phones a man she knows for certain served with Alan and asks him to drop by. Danny makes another appearance; Jane tells him about Kathy and begs him to procure poison to kill her. Don and Kathy are drawn to each other. She wonders why he is so anxious to help find Alan and yet does not talk about him as if they really were friends in England. A drunken Danny returns with the poison and, after rambling for a few minutes, leaves. Don stops by Kathy's to ask her out for dinner. She shows him the claim ticket, asking him to take her to Union Station afterwards. Don is intrigued and suggests they go right away. Jane interrupts the couple as they are leaving and tells them a lie about a note from Alan she has found in the returned car. Alan, she says, is in Mexico and she is going there to find him. She asks them to come to her apartment, where the man who actually was an air corps comrade of Alan's is waiting. It is evident that Don has been lying. Jane holds a gun on him and retrieves the ticket; her sister-in-law runs back to her own apartment to call police, then subsequently finds Don unconscious in Jane's apartment. She notifies police to stake out Union Station. When Don wakes up, he confesses to Kathy that he does not know her brother, but he will explain further later. Jane manipulates a stranger into claiming the bag of cash, then goes to Danny's. He is hungover and leery of her. She asks him to help her run away but she needs to know where the money came from and if it is safe to spend. Danny says it was a \\"once in a lifetime\\" blackmail payoff from an insurance scam. She understands this means the money is unmarked and its disappearance won't be reported to the police. She kills Danny with a drink laced with the poison he had provided her. After finding Danny's body, the Los Angeles police tell Don that if he wants the small lake at Westlake Park dragged in search of Jane's missing husband, it'll cost thousands of dollars; besides, they don't believe his theories. Jane flees with the money to Mexico City, where she has a penthouse at the posh Reforma Hotel. Don turns up at her door. Concluding he is either after the money or with the police, Jane pleads with him to take half. Don tells her he is the brother of Jane's first husband, Bob Blanchard, that \\"this is a vendetta, but it's over now\\", that now that he knows her, he understands how she could have driven his brother to kill himself. As Mexican police detectives rush into the room, Jane holds them at bay with her gun; in tears, she backs away onto a balcony, where she trips. She falls over the railing, screaming, to her death. Don meets Kathy in the lobby and apologizes, saying, \\"Well, it was a short honeymoon, Kathy. We're going home now\\".

It dates back to at least the 1930s, although similar puzzles are much older. Although the wording and specifics can alter, the puzzle runs along these lines: > Three guests check into a hotel room. The manager says the bill is $30, so > each guest pays $10. Later the manager realizes the bill should only have > been $25. To rectify this, he gives the bellhop $5 as five one-dollar bills > to return to the guests. On the way to the guests' room to refund the money, > the bellhop realizes that he cannot equally divide the five one-dollar bills > among the three guests. As the guests aren't aware of the total of the > revised bill, the bellhop decides to just give each guest $1 back and keep > $2 as a tip for himself, and proceeds to do so. As each guest got $1 back, > each guest only paid $9, bringing the total paid to $27. The bellhop kept > $2, which when added to the $27, comes to $29. So if the guests originally > handed over $30, what happened to the remaining $1? There seems to be a discrepancy, as there cannot be two answers ($29 and $30) to the math problem. On the one hand it is true that the $25 in the register, the $3 returned to the guests, and the $2 kept by the bellhop add up to $30, but on the other hand, the $27 paid by the guests and the $2 kept by the bellhop add up to only $29.  Solution  The misdirection in this riddle is in the second half of the description, where unrelated amounts are added together and the listener assumes those amounts should add up to 30, and is then surprised when they do not ‚Å†‚Äî ‚Å†there is, in fact, no reason why the (10 ‚Å†‚àí ‚Å†1) ‚Å†√ó ‚Å†3 ‚Å† + ‚Å†2 ‚Å† = ‚Å†29 sum should add up to 30. The exact sum mentioned in the riddle is computed as: > SUM = $9 (payment by Guest 1) + $9 (payment by Guest 2) + $9 (payment by > Guest 3) + $2 (money in bellhop's pocket) The trick here is to realize that this is not a sum of the money that the three people paid originally, as that would need to include the money the clerk has ($25). This is instead a sum of a smaller amount the people could have paid ($9 √ó 3 people = $27), added with the additional money that the clerk would not have needed had they paid that smaller amount ($27 paid - $25 actual cost = $2). Another way to say this is, the $27 already includes the bellhop's tip. To add the $2 to the $27 would be to double-count it. So, the three guests' cost of the room, including the bellhop's tip, is $27. Each of the 3 guests has $1 in his pocket, totalling $3. When added to the $27 revised cost of the room (including tip to the bellhop), the total is $30. To obtain a sum that totals to the original $30, every dollar must be accounted for, regardless of its location. Thus, the sensible sum that we really desire is this one: > $30 = $1 (inside Guest pocket) + $1 (inside Guest pocket) + $1 (inside Guest > pocket) + $2 (inside bellhop's pocket) + $25 (hotel cash register) This sum does indeed come out to $30. To further illustrate why the riddle's sum does not relate to the actual sum, we can alter the riddle so that the discount on the room is extremely large. Consider the riddle in this form: > Three people check into a hotel room. The clerk says the bill is $30, so > each guest pays $10. Later the clerk realizes the bill should only be $10. > To rectify this, he gives the bellhop $20 to return to the guests. On the > way to the room, the bellhop realizes that he cannot divide the money > equally. As the guests didn't know the total of the revised bill, the > bellhop decides to just give each guest $6 and keep $2 as a tip for himself. > Each guest got $6 back: so now each guest only paid $4; bringing the total > paid to $12. The bellhop has $2. And $12 + $2 = $14 so, if the guests > originally handed over $30, what happened to the remaining $16? Now it is more obvious that the question is quite unreasonable. One cannot simply add a couple of payments together and expect them to total an original amount of circulated cash. More economically, money is accounted by summing together all paid amounts (liabilities) with all money in one's possession (assets). That abstract formula holds regardless of the relative perspectives of the actors in this exchange. * The guests of the hotel paid $27, but also have $3 among their pockets at the story's end. Their assets are $3, and their liabilities are $27 ($30 = 27 + 3). Thus, the original total is accounted. * From the perspective of the hotel clerk, the hotel has $25 in assets and lost $5 in liabilities ($30 = 25 + 5). * From the perspective of the bellhop, his assets are $2, and his liabilities are $3 to guests and $25 to the register at the desk ($30 = 2 + 3 + 25). To illustrate the issue through equations: > 1) 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 2) 10 + 10 + 10 = 25 + 2 + 3 3) 10 + 10 + 10 - 3 = 25 + > 2 + 3 - 3 (adding -3 to both sides of the equation to cancel out the +3 on > the right side) 4) 10 - 1 + 10 - 1 + 10 - 1 = 25 + 2 5) 9 + 9 + 9 = 25 + 2 > (obs: tip to bellhop has already been paid) 6) 27 = 27 How the riddle is deceptive comes in line 8: > 7) 9 + 9 + 9 = 25 + 2 8) 9 + 9 + 9 + 2 = 25 (pushing +2 to the other side > without inverting the sign) 9) 27 + 2 = 25 10) 29 != 25 How it should be: > 7) 9 + 9 + 9 = 25 + 2 8) 9 + 9 + 9 -2 = 25 + 2 -2 (adding -2 to both sides > of the equation to cancel the +2 on the right side, which means the bellhop > returned the tip or gave a discount of $2) 9) 9 + 9 + 9 - 2 = 25 10) 27 - 2 > = 25 11) 25 = 25 The puzzle should subtract the bellhop's tip from the $27 rather than add it.  History  There are many variants of the puzzle. Professor David Singmaster's Chronology of Recreational Mathematics suggests these type of mathematical misdirection puzzles descended from a problem in an 18th-century arithmetic book, Francis Walkingame's Tutor's Assistant which was published, and republished, from 1751 to 1860 where it appeared on page 185, prob. 116 in this form, \\"If 48 taken from 120 leaves 72, and 72 taken from 91 leaves 19, and 7 taken from thence leaves 12, what number is that, out of which, when you have taken 48, 72, 19, and 7, leaves 12?\\" Singmaster adds, \\"Though this is not the same as the withdrawal problems below, the mixing of amounts subtracted and remainders makes me think that this kind of problem may have been the basis of the later kind.\\" An 1880 misdirection is given as \\"Barthel sees two boxes at a jeweller's, priced at 100 and 200. He buys the cheaper one and takes it home, where he decides he really prefers the other. He returns to the jeweller and gives him the box back and says that the jeweller already has 100 from him, which together with the returned box, makes 200, which is the cost of the other box. The jeweller accepts this and gives Barthel the other box and Barthel goes on his way. Is this correct?\\" A model more similar in style to the modern version was given by Cecil B. Read in his 1933 Mathematical Fallacies. His puzzle produces an extra dollar: A man puts $50 in the bank. Then on subsequent days he withdraws $20 leaving $30; then $15 leaving $15; then $9 leaving $6, and finally $6 leaving $0. But $30 + $15 + $6 = $51. Where did the extra dollar come from? The actual solution to this riddle is to add correctly (correct time, correct person and correct location) from the bank point of view which in this case seems to be the problem: # First day: $30 in the bank + $20 owner already withdrew = $50 # Second day: $15 in the bank + ($15 + $20 owner already withdrew) = $50 # Third day: $6 in the bank + ($9 + $15 + $20 owner already withdrew) = $50 From the owner point of view the correct solution is this: # First day: $20 owner already withdrew + $30 in the bank = $50 # Second day: $20 owner already withdrew + $15 owner already withdrew + $15 in the bank = $50 # Third day: ($20 owner already withdrew + $15 owner already withdrew + $9 owner already withdrew) + $6 in the bank = $50 The solution appears very obvious if the owner withdraws every day only $10 from $50. To add up 40 + 30 + 20 + 10 using the same pattern from above would be too obviously wrong (result would be $100). The answer to the question, \\"Where did the extra dollar come from?‚Äù can be found from consecutively adding the bank rest from three different days. This way is correct only if the money owner withdraws every day exact half of the money. Then it will add up. ($25 + $12.50 + $6.25) + $6.25 = $50 Another entry from 1933, R. M. Abraham's Diversions and Pastimes (still available in a Dover version) poses a slightly different approach with this problem from page 16 (problem 61). \\"A traveller returning to New York found that he had only a ten-dollar postal money order, and that his train fare was seven dollars. The ticket clerk refused to accept the money order, so the traveller went across the road to a pawn shop and pawned it for seven dollars. On his way back to the station he met a friend, who, to save the traveller the trouble of returning to redeem the money order, bought the pawn ticket from him for seven dollars. The traveller then bought his ticket and still had seven dollars when he got to New York. Who made the loss?\\" David Darling in his The Universal book of Mathematics, credits this as an earlier version of the three men in a hotel version above. Even more similar is the English, The Black-Out Book by Evelyn August in 1939; What happened to the shilling?, pp. 82 & 213\\\\. Three girls each pay five shillings to share a room. The landlord refunds 5 shillings via the bellboy, who gives them each one and keeps two. And one more from the same theme appears in an Abbott and Costello routine in which Abbott asks Costello for a fifty-dollar loan.

It has a population of about 104,985 inhabitants as per the and is the administrative seat of its county, Pergamino Partido. Its UN/LOCODE is ARPGO. History Long valued for its many springs and fertile land, the area had been home to the Charr√∫a and Araucanian people when it was first noticed by Spanish colonist around 1620. Becoming a posada along the trade route between colonial Buenos Aires and C√≥rdoba, the settlement was given its name on 3 January 1626, for the parchment paper (document lost by a group of Spaniards) found there and conforming to an Araucanian term meaning \\"red soil.\\" The settlement's first businesses were established in 1700 and in 1749, recurrent attacks by displaced natives led to the construction of a fort. These attacks did not cease, however, and on 8 August 1751 the settlement was destroyed. The site continued to be of interest, and Commander Juan Gonz√°lez ordered the village rebuilt on orders from the Buenos Aires colonial government in 1769. The Curate of nearby Arrecifes ordained a Parish in Pergamino in 1779 and the new Viceroyalty of R√≠o de la Plata assigned the area a partido (county) in 1784. The fort played a prominent role during the initial battles in the war for independence and, in 1815, was the site of a mutiny led by Col. Ignacio √Ålvarez Thomas against the fledgling nation's Head of State, Director Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear. Col. √Ålvarez Thomas' coup d'√©tat against Director de Alvear's brief though highly divisive autocracy averted the dissolution of the United Provinces of the River Plate, the confederacy that later became Argentina.Parroquia de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Merced Merced Plaza. Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Following the struggle for independence, the progressive new Governor of Buenos Aires, Mart√≠n Rodr√≠guez, assigned Pergamino a Justice of the Peace in 1822 and the first school was opened in 1828. The town soon became home to a number of abattoirs and following the 1829 rise of Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas (whose family interests centered around cattle-raising) a close alliance developed between the governor and Pergamino's most prominent families, the Acevedos and the Anchorenas; Rosas' repressive regime, however, resulted in the sole school's closure in 1838. Following Governor Rosas' 1852 overthrow, the local gentry allied themselves to Bartolom√© Mitre, a prominent advocate on behalf of Buenos Aires Province for greater autonomy. Mitre was elected governor in 1860 and President of Argentina in 1862. President Mitre's 1862 establishment of Argentina's first institute of Agronomy helped lead to the development of a new economic activity in the region around Pergamino: intensive agriculture. The first Argentine grain shipment to arrive intact in the United Kingdom in 1875 touched off an agricultural boom that for Pergamino, resulted in the massive cultivation of ma√Øze. The city's growth accelerated further upon the arrival of the Central Argentine Railway in 1882, en route to Rosario. Pergamino, whose population by then exceeded 10,000 and home to over 90 registered businesses, was formally designated as a city on 23 October 1895. Continuing to rely economically on maize, local landowners funded the establishment of an agricultural laboratory in 1912.INTA Pergamino's population, now mostly European immigrants and their children, nearly tripled to almost 30,000 between 1895 and 1914; this era saw the establishment of important Basque, Piemontese, Proven√ßal and Lebanese communities, as well as the inauguration of the Hotel Roma in 1913, one of the best-known art nouveau structures in the area.Historia Actual One immigrant from the Piedmont, Enrique Venini, founded Pergamino's first newspaper, La Opini√≥n, in 1917.La Opini√≥n The city's growing immigrant communities also included a sizable contingent of British railway engineers and other technicians associated with the rapidly expanding railways. A number of these staffers and the Central Argentine Railway's director, Ronald Leslie, organized Pergamino's first football team on 18 November 1918, christening it in honor of a British Field Marshal famed for his roles in the Boer War and in World War I, Gen. Douglas Haig. Club Atl√©tico Douglas Haig has enjoyed regional prominence in the Argentine B League. Pergamino's main church and city hall were both completed in 1930. Following a decade of prosperity, however, the great depression led to the ruin of the majority of the area's small landholders. The city soon began to recover, and celebrated the opening of the Municipal Fine Arts Museum in 1936, for instance. A devastating flood in 1939 led to construction of levees and canals along the Pergamino River. Growing to nearly 50,000 people by 1947, the city's first large manufacturing establishments began to operate at this time. Pergamino's agricultural sector, however, was strained by the creation of a national export grain purchaser, the IAPI, by President Juan Per√≥n in 1946; although Pergamino benefited from IAPI investment in irrigation and other infrastructure works, the low prices the agency paid local growers also led to the bankruptcy of number. The dissolution of the IAPI following Per√≥n's overthrow in 1955 and the 1956 establishment of the National Agricultural Laboratory (INTA) in Pergamino helped revitalize the sector in the area and nationally.Historical Dictionary of Argentina. London: Scarecrow Press, 1978. The elections of 1963 carried a native of Pergamino, Dr. Arturo Illia, to the Presidency; President Illia prioritized economic growth while keeping national budgets nearly balanced, the combination of which helped lead to unprecedented growth in Pergamino. The city's first high-rises were built, as well as the industrial district; President Illia graced his birthplace with numerous visits during his tenure. Another native of Pergamino, H√©ctor Chavero, became nationally renowned during that era after releasing an album of folklore ballads and narration, El payador perseguido (\\"The Persecuted Troubadour\\"); by then, he was known by his pseudonym, Atahualpa Yupanqui and has remained, long after his death in 1992, arguably the most influential musician of his genre in Argentina. One of Pergamino's Lebanese immigrants, Isaac Annan, established the city's first garment factory during the late 1940s, creating Far West Jeans and Manhattan Shirts, two of Argentina's best-known domestic clothing brands. By 1970, Wrangler Jeans, Fiorucci, Levi's, Lee Jeans and a number of local firms, had established large textile plants, employing about 6,000. Roberto Genoud, the son of French immigrants, established the area's largest lumber and furniture factory. Pergamino continued to grow, reaching a population of 70,000 in 1980, becoming northern Buenos Aires Province's industrial center. Economic instability nationwide began to take its toll on that sector after 1975, however, and by 1985 a number of local textile manufacturers had closed or were replaced by smaller cooperatives. The city was chosen as the site for the prestigious National Viral Research Institute (INEVH) in 1978, and was home to one of the nation's first cable television stations in 1985. The city's main daily, La Opini√≥n, closed in 1989 amid a national economic crisis. Financially distressed, the daily's founders, the Veninis, sold the company to local cable TV entrepreneur Hugo Apestegu√≠a, the current owner. Serious floods in 1939, 1975, 1984 and 1995 underscored the need for more investments in infrastructure and by 2002, the combined effects of a wave of imports and an acute economic crisis led to the closure of most of Pergamino's industries and many of its retail establishments; the textile industry, in particular, was reduced to about 600 workers; amid rising unemployment, crime rates and general pessimism, one of the most notable achievements in that difficult era was the establishment of the Pergamino Regional University, the city's first institution of higher learning, in 1993. The school was absorbed into the National University of Northwestern Buenos Aires upon that latter entity's creation in 2002, and its Pergamino campus today enrolls about 500 students yearly.UNNOBA The city today The economic recovery Argentina began to experience in 2003 has led to a dramatic recovery in the city's industrial base, as well the area's agricultural production; in 2003 alone, the city saw 2,500 manufacturing jobs return. The county's is dedicated almost entirely to agriculture and, though local farmers have diversified into poultry and dairy production, Pergamino still plays an important role in Argentina's cereal harvest, particularly soy and maize, as well as being home to half the national sales of seed for cultivation; as such, the city was declared National Capital of the Seed in 1998. Even so, agricultural employment accounts for only 8% of the county's total and employment in manufacturing, which has growing by about 13% annually, accounted for 22% of the total in 2006, or about 10,000 jobs. Though still led by the textile and lumber industries, manufacturing in Pergamino is more diversified than in the past and these two sectors today employ less than a third of industrial labor. Pergamino's financial sector has likewise recovered: the value of locally originated loans nearly doubled between 2002 and 2006, reaching US$52 million and local deposits nearly tripled, reaching almost US$100 million. The mayor of Pergamino, Dr. H√©ctor Guti√©rrez, is (as most of the city's past mayors) affiliated with the centrist Radical Civic Union, Argentina's oldest continuously existing political party. Elected in 1999, he has capitalized on the city's economic recovery by emphasizing public works and in 2005, successfully lobbied the Administration of President N√©stor Kirchner for a 180 km (112 mi) extension of the Route 8 expressway into Pergamino, a long-overdue improvement for one of the nation's most-transited stretches of two-lane road.

She is known as a co-founder of the design company Artek and as a collaborator on its most well-known designs. As Artek's first artistic director, her creative output spanned textiles, lamps, glassware, and buildings. Biography Aino Mandelin was born in Helsinki, and completed her school education in 1913 at the Helsingin Suomalainen Tytt√∂koulu (Helsinki Finnish Girls' School). She began studies in architecture that same year at the Institute of Technology, Helsinki, and qualified as an architect in 1920. That same year she went to work for architect Oiva Kallio in Helsinki. In 1923 she moved to the city of Jyv√§skyl√§ to work in the office of architect Gunnar Achilles Wahlroos, but the following year switched to working in the office of architect Alvar Aalto. Mandelin married Alvar Aalto in 1925. The Aaltos spent their honeymoon in northern Italy. It was common at that time for young architects in Scandinavia to travel to Italy to study the vernacular architecture, which had a profound influence on Scandinavian architecture during the 1920s, flourishing in the so-called Nordic Classicism style. The Aaltos moved their office to Turku in 1927, and started collaborating with architect Erik Bryggman. The office moved again in 1933 to Helsinki. The Aaltos designed and built a joint house-office (1935‚Äì36) for themselves in Munkkiniemi, a suburb of Helsinki, but later (1954‚Äì55) had a purpose-built office built in the same neighbourhood. Aino Aalto's role in the design of the architecture attributed to Alvar Aalto has never been specifically verified. Their early built works were mostly small-scale buildings, especially summer villas, designed in the style of Nordic Classicism. Chief among these was the Aalto's own summer villa, Villa Flora in Alaj√§rvi from 1926 (extended 1938). It is known that in the design work she concentrated more on the design of interiors (such as the world-famous Villa Mairea in Noormarkku of 1937-39), but also furniture (such as the Paimio Sanatorium of 1927‚Äì29). In 1935 the Aaltos, together with Maire Gullichsen (chief client for the Villa Mairea) and Nils-Gustav Hahlin, founded Artek, a firm selling lighting fixtures and furniture designed by the Aaltos. Aino was the head designer of Artek and later became the managing director of the firm. Artek still produces Aalto furniture today, but now it is owned by a private company. In the early years of their marriage and design partnership Aino Aalto and her husband would enter architectural competitions with their own separate entries. In the mid 1920s the Aaltos became the first architects in Finland to adopt the purified Functionalist style of architecture coming from central Europe. In Aino Aalto's own individual work this comes out in her entry for the Finnish pavilion for the 1939 New York World's Fair, the first prize for which, however, was won by Alvar Aalto. Glass vase designed by Aino Aalto. Aino Aalto also designed several glassware objects for the Finnish company Iittala, who made household objects. Her most famous glass design is still on sale, and slightly different copies made by companies such as IKEA are widespread. She also collaborated with her husband on the design of the celebrated Savoy Vase in 1936. Aalto actively worked in the Artek office until 1949, when she died of cancer. In 2004 an exhibition and book (edited by Ulla Kinnunen) was arranged at the Alvar Aalto Museum, Jyv√§skyl√§, Finland, featuring the life's work of Aino Aalto.

Members of this genus are found through much of Eurasia and western North America. Many other genera were formerly included here. These true frogs are usually largish species characterized by their slim waists and wrinkled skin; many have thin ridges running along their backs, but they generally lack \\"warts\\" as in typical toads. They are excellent jumpers due to their long, slender legs. The typical webbing found on their hind feet allows for easy movement through water. Coloration is mostly greens and browns above, with darker and yellowish spots. Distribution and habitat Many frogs in this genus breed in early spring, although subtropical and tropical species may breed throughout the year. Males of most of the species are known to call, but a few species are thought to be voiceless. Females lay eggs in rafts or large, globular clusters, and can produce up to 20,000 at one time. Diet Rana species feed mainly on insects and invertebrates, but swallow anything they can fit into their mouths, including small vertebrates. Among their predators are egrets, crocodiles, and snakes. Systematics Some 50 to 100 extant species are now placed in this genus by various authors; many other species formerly placed in Rana are now placed elsewhere. FrostFrost, Darrel R. (2006): Amphibian Species of the World: an Online Reference. Version 4, 2006-Aug-17. restricted Rana to the Old World true frogs and the Eurasian brown and pond frogs of the common frog R. temporaria group,Lithobates, American Museum of Natural History. although other authors disagreed with this arrangement. In 2016, a consortium of Rana researchers from throughout Europe, Asia, and North America revised the group, and reported that the arrangement of Frost (2006) resulted in nonmonophyletic groups. Yuan et al. (2016) included all the North American ranids within Rana, and used subgenera for the well-differentiated species groups within Rana. Both of these classifications are presented below. Genera recently split from Rana are Babina, Clinotarsus (including Nasirana), Glandirana, Hydrophylax, Hylarana, Lithobates, Odorrana (including Wurana), Pelophylax, Pulchrana, Sanguirana, and Sylvirana. Of these, Odorrana is so closely related to Rana proper, it could conceivably be included here once again. The others seem to be far more distant relatives, in particular Pelophylax. New species are still being described in some numbers.

The street is commonly known by two names, \\"St. James Street\\" in English (after St. James's, London) and rue Saint-Jacques in French. Both names are used in English and French, although Saint-Jacques is the most common for geographical reference. St. James Street is usually used in reference to the street's historic importance as a financial district. History Montreal map drawn by Fran√ßois Dollier de Casson in 1672 A main thoroughfare passing through Old Montreal, the street was first opened in 1672. The portion between McGill Street and place Saint Henri was originally called Bonaventure Street (rue Saint-Bonaventure). This name has passed down to Place Bonaventure, Bonaventure Expressway, and Bonaventure Metro station, despite the disappearance of their original referents. In the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, St. James Street was the centre of Montreal's financial district and where several major English insurance, banking, and trust companies built their Canadian head offices. Prior to World War I, Canadian, provincial, and major municipal governments along with important industries such as the railways, public utility and canal companies obtained most of their capital financing in the United Kingdom or the United States. At the end of the War, St. James Street grew rapidly and although by the 1920s there were stock exchanges in Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary and Vancouver, St. James Street's stock brokerage houses and the Montreal Stock Exchange were the most important in all of Canada. At the time of its construction in 1928, the Royal Bank of Canada's new headquarters at 360 St. James Street was the tallest building in the British Empire. The St James St. area was also the head office of the Bank of Montreal, and the informal head office of the Bank of Nova Scotia. It was also home to the major brokerage houses such as Nesbitt, Thomson and Company, Pitfield, MacKay, Ross, Royal Securities Corporation and others. Some companies, past and present, located on St. James Street are: * 50 : Ottawa Hotel, Montreal * 60 : Canfone.com - Versailles Building * 100 : New York Life Insurance Company * 105-107 : Royal Trust * 119 : Bank of Montreal main Montreal branch * 201-215 : Canadian Pacific Express * 210-212 Yorkshire Insurance Co. * 215 : McMaster Meighen, lawyers * 225 : National Trust Co. * 231-235 : Montreal Star * 240 : Guardian Trust Co. - The Dominion Bank * 244 : Royal Securities Corporation * 249-251 : Jones-Heward Financial Services * 262-266 : Montreal City and District Savings Bank * 265 : Canadian Bank of Commerce * 275 : Canada Life * 278-288 : Molson Bank * 355 : Merchants' Bank of Canada * 360 : Royal Bank of Canada * 388-390 : Sovereign Bank of Canada then Union Bank and Commercial Union Assurance Co. * 393 : Crown Trust Co. * 437 : Eastern Townships Bank then the Commercial Union Assurance Co. and the Bank of Nova Scotia East of Place d'Armes square, the street was home to two French-Canadian financial institutions, the Banque Canadienne Nationale and the Banque du Peuple, long gone now.Old Montreal Web site =Decline= A steady erosion of its status as Canada's financial centre began with the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959, followed by the political uncertainty as a result of the election of the separatist Parti Qu√©b√©cois provincial government in 1976, all served as a catalyst for financial institutions to locate elsewhere. A number chose to gradually move their official head offices to Toronto, Ontario, while others shifted all future expansion to Toronto or other major Canadian centres. As a result, the St. James Street financial district has all but disappeared. =Recent history= Saint Jacques Street in Little Burgundy During the 1990s, the Montreal Expos baseball club unveiled plans to build a new stadium in downtown Montreal, right off St. Jacques Street, just south of the Bell Centre. When provincial funding for the new building fell through, the Expos did not continue with their plan and sold the property to developers. That stretch of Saint Jacques is now undergoing considerable gentrification. Today, the stretch of St. Jacques Street between McGill Street and Saint Laurent Boulevard is still notable mostly for its grand Neo-Classical buildings on the part of the street running through the Old Montreal district. These include Bank of Montreal's domed Montreal Main Branch, the former headquarters of Royal Bank of Canada, the Canadian Bank of Commerce, the Molson Bank and the Canada Life Insurance Company. More modern buildings include the Montreal World Trade Centre and the Stock Exchange Tower. Farther west, St. Jacques Street runs through the residential neighbourhoods of Little Burgundy, Saint- Henri, Notre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce and Lachine. Lionel-Groulx and Place-Saint-Henri Metro stations are located on St. Jacques in the South West borough; to the west, it gives access to Autoroute 20 in Notre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce, where it passes through a largely industrial and large-surface commercial district at the top of the Falaise Saint-Jacques. The McGill University Health Centre superhospital fronts Saint-Jacques in Notre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce.

Education Orville Adalbert Derby Derby studied geology at the Cornell University, obtaining his degree in 1873. While a student, he was invited in 1870 by his professor Charles Frederick Hartt (1840‚Äì1878) to follow him in a study travel to Brazil (the Morgan Expedition), and returning again with him in 1871, this time going to the Tapaj√≥s River in the Amazon. Just after his graduation, Derby accepted a post of assistant professor at Cornell and briefly substituted for Hartt during another travel to Brazil in 1874. In June of the same year, Derby defended his doctoral thesis on the carboniferous brachiopoda in the Amazon. Brazil When Hartt organized the first Geological Commission of the Empire of Brazil, Derby was nominated its assistant and returned to Brazil in December 1875. In 1877, with the end of the Commission, Derby decided to stay in Brazil and accepted a post at the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro. He became also a member and director of the Geographic and Geological Commission of S√£o Paulo from 1886 to 1904. This commission later originated the Astronomical and Geophysical Institute of the University of S√£o Paulo. Derby founded also the first Botanical Gardens in S√£o Paulo (\\"Horto Bot√¢nico\\"). In 1906 he was nominated to the Brazilian Geographic and Geological Survey. Derby worked in many domains of the geological sciences, such as mineralogy, economic geology, physical geography, cartography, petrography, meteorology, archeology and paleontology. =Publications= He published 173 papers on the geology of Brazil from 1873 to 1915. He was also the publisher of one of the first geological maps of Brazil, in 1915. Personal life and death Dr. Orville Derby never married and led a solitary existence, living mostly in hotel rooms. After the failure of an invitation by the state government of Bahia, he returned to Rio de Janeiro and committed suicide in a hotel room, on November 27, 1915, a few months after gaining Brazilian citizenship. He was 64 years old. ReferencesFurther reading * Diniz Gonsalves, A., 1952 ‚Äì Orville A.

Miller and produced by Walt Disney Television. The film marked Newton-John's television film debut and her first film appearance in seven years since Two of a Kind (1983). It was written by Gerald Di Pego based on the book A Mom by Magic by Barbara Dillon and originally premiered on NBC on December 17, 1990. Plot The story revolves around 11-year-old Jessica Slocum (Juliet Sorci), whose mother died when she was three years old. Her father, Jim (Doug Sheehan), is a workaholic with little time for his daughter and hasn't been able to spend time with her since her mother's death 8 years prior and still seems to be mourning her. Just before the Christmas holiday season, Jessica wins a free wish from a wishing well. Her wish for a mother for Christmas is granted by Philomena (Doris Roberts) and Amy Miller (Olivia Newton-John), a department store mannequin, is brought to life to be a mom for Jessica. However, there is a catch and Amy can only be a mother to her until Christmas Eve. To clear up any confusion for Jim, Amy claims herself to be a nanny from Australia hired to help care for Jessica while he's at work and she is given a spare room on top of the garage. Amy and Jessica get along until they suffer a brief misunderstanding. Jessica briefly wants to take back the wish and sees Amy go lifeless from her bedroom window. Horrified, she runs out in the rain and stairs to Amy's room, frantically knocking on her door. Amy opens up and Jessica is relieved to see her fine as she is ushered in. The next day, Jessica visits Philomena at the department store to see if she could take back the original wish. She wants Amy to stay forever with them because her father has grown fond of her and she can't bear to lose another mother. Philomena wishes she could help alter the wish, but shows Jessica what Amy will be up against if she isn't there to save her and other the mannequins with faces. The store she works at is planning to replace all the mannequins with faceless ones. Philomena tells Jessica there is only one way to avoid this and if she really wants to save Amy, they must act fast and join hands with her. That isn't the only thing Amy is up against, an inquisitive store detective suspects her of taking a missing Santa mannequin (needed for Jessica's Christmas pageant) from the store and questions her. However, Amy's mannequin friends come to her aid, especially a male mannequin dressed as a driver who warns him to keep his distance from her. Amy and the Santa mannequin both help Jessica overcome her stage fright and put on a convincing performance that wow's the crowd. Jim takes a photograph of Jessica, his first picture of her since her mother died. Christmas Eve and Philomena is late to perform the ritual needed to save Amy so she has to return to the store. Jessica recruits Jim to help save her and they head to the store. By the time they reach the store, they see Amy having gone back to being a mannequin and Jessica throws herself at her. She begs her father to grab Amy's hand and he reluctantly does. The ritual works and Amy is brought back before them. They head for home and Amy's mannequin friends wishes her the best of luck in her new life, while the store detective is awakened by Philomena using her magic feather duster. The film ends with a Christmas picture of Jim, Amy and Jessica.

Favorite foods include broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, collards, kale, mustard greens, turnip greens, radishes, turnips, rutabagas and kohlrabi. This small group of similar pest species is known to agriculturists as the cabbage worm compte butterflies (family Pieridae, type genus Pieris, garden whites). * The small white (P. rapae) is a small, common, cosmopolitan butterfly whose caterpillar has fine, short fuzz and is bright green; it prefers cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower. A larger Old World form (P. brassicae) is called large white. A common North American form (P. protodice) is known as the southern cabbage butterfly. The green-veined white (P. napi) occurs in Europe and North America. * The cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) is a member of the moth family Noctuidae. The caterpillar is smooth and green with white stripes. It is called a \\"looper\\" because it arches its body as it crawls, inchworm style. This species is very destructive to plants due to its voracious consumption of leaves. It is not restricted to cole crops; other plant hosts include tomato, cucumber, and potato. The adult of the species is a nocturnal brown moth. * The cabbage webworm (Hellula undalis) is a widely distributed webworm native to southern Europe or Asia that also injures cabbages and other vegetables in the Gulf states of the United States. * The diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella or, in some literature known by the synonym P. maculipennis) is a member of the moth family Plutellidae. The caterpillar is smooth and solid green in color. When disturbed, it thrashes and drops off the plant. The newly emerged larva is a leaf miner, entering the tissues of the leaf and consuming the parenchyma between the two outer layers of the leaf. Larger larvae make holes through the leaf, consuming all the tissue. The adult of the species is a small, elongated gray moth with whitish spots on the forewings that form two diamond shapes when the moth is at rest.

At the core of any smuggling organization is the economic relationship between supply and demand. From the organization's point of view, the issues are what the consumer wants, and how much the consumer is willing to pay the smuggler or smuggling organization to obtain it. Developmental Smuggling Model (DSM) The Developmental Smuggling Model is a unified model in that it describes phases of smugglers and organizations. Smugglers are reported to fall within one of three different phases. Organizations in which there is smuggling occurring also fall within one of three different phases. Phase II is subdivided into three types of corporations. =Phase I Smugglers= Phase I smugglers are usually smuggling contraband to meet their own needs although they might smuggle enough to cover their expenses by selling some of the contraband. Mules and those who meet law enforcement \\"smuggler profiles\\" fall within this cluster of individuals. Occasionally, individuals are enticed to carry contraband by more experienced smugglers because the professional smuggler wishes to test the security through which the mule must travel or to create a diversion when the novice smuggler is caught; thus, allowing a breach through which a larger shipment of contraband can be moved. Once the contraband is placed, the individual or family is referred to as the virgin (See Lichtenwald, 2003). The use of a \\"virgin smuggler\\" allows the professional smuggler to check his or her assessment of the security and to make sure that the contraband was not detected because \\"the virgin smuggler\\" could not control his or her emotions or behavior or because of the way the contraband was packaged, or because a bribe was not effective. The use of a \\"virgin smuggler\\" also allows the professional smuggler not to be identified. Phase I smugglers is the group most frequently caught by the police and government agencies. These agencies focus their security and enforcement efforts on arresting individuals within this group. In May 2005 the MITRE Corporation released a press announcement reporting that they had created a computer simulation program capable of modeling the complex adaptive behaviors of smugglers. The Modeling Complex Adaptive Behavior Project was headed by Daniel Venese and sponsored by MITRE's Center for Enterprise Modernization. The program is capable of generating a steady stream of novel smuggling techniques so that strategies can be crafted to combat them. Once an agency produces these strategies, it can feed them into the simulation to test how smugglers may adapt their methods in response. Information regarding The Modeling Complex Adaptive Behavior Project can be found in The MITRE Digest. =Phase II Smugglers= Phase II smugglers are divided into two subtypes of individuals. Subtype 1 is a group of individuals who know each other and have a shared value system. The members of Subtype 1 often refer to each other as friends. Subtype 2 individuals belong to a group who have a shared value system but may not know each other as well. Subtype 2 may be a subgroup of coworkers or members of a group such as a gang or a more peaceful groups. When street gangs venture into smuggling they are a Phase II smuggling organization. The money the gangs make from smuggling is spent on supporting their criminal lifestyle. The members of Subtype 2 may have applied for a specific jobs such as bag handlers or inspectors within an industry because it allows them to be in a position to engage in crimes such as smuggling. Phase II organizations fall into three different type of structures: * Type 1 organizations are formed for the sole purpose of smuggling. Type 1 businesses are usually small, with only a few employees. The individuals have limited experience smuggling, although they are likely to have wanted to engage in smuggling for some time. The Type 1 businesses have yet to make a substantial profit from smuggling and have only limited contacts with individuals who can secure the contraband. * The Type 2 organization is a legitimate business, which turned to smuggling to cover its operational expenses (as a facade). * The Type 3 of organization is usually large and the smugglers belong to either the management or the rank and file (hourly wage earners) who exploit the smuggling opportunities inherent in the business. Type 3 smuggling organizations include the airline, shipping, boating, and land transportation industries. The Phase II smugglers is the group that receives the most media attention. =Phase III Smugglers= Phase III smugglers and organizations are formed for the sole purpose of smuggling. There are several factors that distinguish Phase III smugglers and organization from a Phase II smuggler and organization. The Phase III individual or business smuggles with sophistication. In general, the individuals in Phase III are raised in an environment where smuggling is encouraged and considered an acceptable behavior. The individual is raised with a family history of smuggling. Phase III smugglers are very experienced at smuggling, (The smuggler captured and studied for two years in Lichtenwald's research (Lichtenwald, 2003, 2004) had worked his way up from a Phase I smuggling business to being made a member of a Phase II business, and then a Phase III smuggling organization). The Phase III smuggling corporation is divided into formal departments such as counter intelligence, bribes, money laundering, and others. An example is when the smugglers purchase a trucking corporation that ships products such as fruits and vegetables that must be moved from location to location before an expiration date. Due to spoilage risks, the smuggling corporation can protest delays due to screening for contraband at entry ports. The smuggling corporation can select, based on their assessment of the risk of being caught, which shipments will contain the contraband. The smuggling organization invests in other businesses that offer smuggling opportunities. It may also engage in border jumping given specific opportunities. For example, when the radar balloons are not working, the smuggling organization may take advantage of the situation and jump the border. The Phase III smuggling organization endears itself to the country from where the contraband is produced or taken and to the country that stores the contraband. Finally, it esteems itself to the country which is the final destination for the smuggled contraband. Individuals in the Phase III smuggling organization will keep their own governments and other governments focused on Phase I smugglers and Phase II smugglers and organizations, to avoid causing another government any problems or draw any attention or suspicion.

Etymology  The Katir/Katir or Kata Kafir group was numerically the most dominant group of the Siah-Posh (Persian \\"Black Wearer/Clothed\\") tribes. They owned approximately forty villages in the Bashgul valley and numbered about 40,000 (1890). The upper part of the Bashgul Valley of Nuristan (Afghanistan) is known as Katirgul. It is called Lutdeh in Chitrali and Kantozi in Pashto. According to George Scott Robertson, the Katir Siah-Posh clan settled in Katirgul valley was called Kamtoz (or Camtoz) in Pashto and Lutdehhchis in Chitrali (The Kafirs of the Hindukush, p 71). But American investigator Richard Strand's website suggests that the name Kamtoz/Kamtozi may apply to all Katirs of the former Siah-Posh group, including the Ramguli and Kulam Katirs . Alternative names for Kamtoz are Camtozi, Kantozi. Despite their fiercely independent nature, the Katis, together with the Kom tribe, were tributary to the Mehtar of Chitral. The nature of this tributary relationship was inconsistent because the Katis and Koms would often raid Chitrali territory for livestock and head-hunting. In retaliation the Mehtars would invade the Bashgul Valley and enslave entire villages. During the reign of Mehtar Aman-ul-Mulk the relationship was formalized and the Kafirs would pay an annual tribute of slaves. Numerous scholars have connected the names Katir/Kator/Kata and Kam/Kom with ancient Kambojas and identified the Kafirs, especially the Siah-Posh Kafirs, as having descended from ancient. The Kata Tribe also lives in Chitral and very much mixed with Chitralies. There is a popular stone by the name of Kata Boht situated in Ozhore (Juwara) Valley Chitral. The Kata Tribe also lives in Ozhore and also other part of Chitral. The other fact is the tribe lives in Gram; gram is a Nuristani word meaning \\"village\\". In ancient times, people were considered rich according to their ownership of animals or land. As the Kata tribe in Chitral was considered to be relatively rich, over time, Chitrali speakers began to use kata to mean \\"rich\\" or \\"big\\".H.H. Wilson, M. Elphinstone, Bombay Gazetteer, D. Wilber, M. C. Gillet, W. K. Fraser Tytler, R. L. Mitra, H. C. Raychaudhury, J.R.A.S. 1843, J.A.S.B. 1874 etc. History Kafiristan is a mountainous region of the Hindu Kush that was isolated and politically independent until the conquest by Afghan conquest of 1896. The region became a refuge of an old group of Indo- European people probably mixed with an older substratum, as well as a refuge of a distinct Kafiri group of Indo-Iranian languages, forming part of the wider Dardic languages. The inhabitants were known as \\"kafirs\\" due to their enduring Hinduism while other regions around them became Muslim. However, the influence from district names in Kafiristan of Katwar or Kator and the ethnic name Kati has also been suggested. The Kafirs were divided into Siyah-Posh, comprising five sub-tribes who spoke Lato language while the others were called Safed-Posh comprising Prasungeli, Wangeli, Wamais and Ashhkun. The Nuristani/Kafir people practiced a form of ancient Hinduism, infused with accretions developed locally. Kafirs represent non-Rig Vedic Aryans, identical with the Dasas. That their ancestors were pre-Rigvedic Aryans can be inferred from lingusitic, ethnological and theological evidence. The Kafiri/Nuristani languages contain certain Indo-Aryan phoenetic features not found in Indo- Iranian languages. Their chief deity is Imra ie., Yamaraja which was brought there by the Dasas who worshipped Asuras especially Yama and Varuna. Another of their goddess Dhisana is identical to the marginalized Yama in the Rig Veda. They also worshipped Indra or Inthra. =Invasion of Timur (1398)= On his way to India, Timur attacked the Siyah-Posh in 1398 A.D. after receiving complaints from the trading city of Andarab by raids from Kafirs. He penetrated it from Khawak pass and restored an old fortress there. Timur personally proceeded against the Kator and sent a detachment of 10,000 soldiers against Siyah-Poshas under Burhan Aglan and had the fort of Kator deserted by Kafirs destroyed while the houses of the city were burnt. The Kafirs took refuge on top of a hill and many were killed in the ensuing clash. Some held out for three days but agreed to convert after Timur offered them the choice between death and Islam. They however soon apostatised and ambushed Muslim soldiers in the night. They were however repelled and a number of the Kafirs were killed, with 150 taken prisoner and later executed. Timur ordered his men \\"to kill all the men, to make prisoners of women and children, and to plunder and lay waste all their property.\\" His soldiers carried out the order and he directed them to build a tower of skulls of the dead Kafirs. Timur had his expedition engraved on a neighboring hill in the month of Ramazan. His detachment sent against Siyah-Poshas however met with disaster with Aglan routed and fleeing. A small detachment of 400 men under Muhammad Azad was sent and defeated the Kafirs, retrieving the horses and armour Aglan lost. Timur captured a few places later, though nothing more is stated, presumably he left the Siyah-poshas alone. He then proceeded to exterminate the rebellious Afghan tribes and crossed the Sindhu river in September 1398. = Conversion to Islam (late 19th century) = The territory between Afghanistan and British India was demarcated between 1894 to 1896. Part of the frontier lying between Nawa Kotal in outskirts of Mohmand country and Bashgal Valley on outskirts of Kafiristan were demarcated by 1895 with an agreement reached on 9 April 1895. Emir Abdur Rahman Khan invaded Kafiristan in the winter of 1895-1896 and captured it in 40 days according to his autobiography. Columns invaded it from the west through Panjshir to Kullum, the strongest fort of the region. The columns from the north came through Badakhshan and from the east through Asmar. A small column also came from south-west through Laghman. The Kafirs were converted to Islam and resettled in Laghman while the region was settled by veteran soldiers and other Afghans. Kafiristan was renamed as Nooristan. The former Kafiristan Kafiri were renamed Nuristani (The Enlightened Ones) from the proper noun Nuristan (Land of Light). Presently they are known by Nuristani Kata or simply Kata. Georg Morgenstierne visited the Bashgul Valley in 1929 during his field work on Nuristani (Kafir) languages. He encountered the two last remaining unconverted \\"Kafir\\" priests of the region, called Bagashai and Kareik. Both men were dead by 1935.Enhet i mangfold? 100 √•r med religionshistorie i Norge 1898-1998.

Background  Thomas Fleming was awarded a doctorate in Classics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, completing his dissertation on Attic lyric poetry, and until joining a series of conservative groups, taught Latin at a small, private middle school in South Carolina.Advertisement in Chronicles Magazine In addition to editing, Fleming writes on topics concerning the literature of pagan Greece as well as political issues. Fleming was introduced to the paleoconservative public by Robert W. Whitaker of South Carolina in 1982. At that time, he was invited to contribute to Whitaker's book, The New Right Papers,Robert W. Whitaker, The New Right Papers. which put together ways whereby conservative populists could be elected to office through an alliance of people from both parties in the Republican Party. Whitaker later joined the Reagan administration as a junior member. Now a recognized name in the conservative movement of the region where he lived, Fleming became a founding member and board member of the League of the South, from which he later resigned when controversy arose, as well as an affiliated scholar of its educational arm, the League of the South Institute.The League of the South Institute He was the founding editor of the Southern Partisan magazine, started in 1979, until he left when controversy arose there as well. In 1985, after the death of author Leopold Tyrmand, Fleming became editor of Chronicles Magazine, and in 1988 co-wrote The Conservative Movement with Paul Gottfried. As of June 2015, Thomas Fleming is retired as editor of Chronicles magazine. As of the July 2015 issue of Chronicles, the magazine's former Senior Editor For Books, Chilton Williamson Jr., is currently editor for the publication. Fleming continues to occasionally contribute articles to Chronicles.  Recent statements = Immigration = Criticizing mass immigration into the United States, Fleming, in an essay in Immigration and the American Future, writes how American elites peddle a form of propositionalism: > This abstract approach to assimilation derives, ultimately, from the > conviction - as naive as it is chauvinistic - that America is an exceptional > country, one not rooted in blood, soil, and kinship, but a nation \\"dedicated > to the proposition that all men are created equal\\".

Racism controversy  Fleming has made several controversial statements regarded by some as racist in nature, although he denies that he and most paleoconservatives support racism. Examples of incendiary comments include the following statements taken from his columns in Chronicles: * \\"In South Africa and Rhodesia, it is hard to understand the position taken by English liberals whose efforts on behalf of Africans reached entirely predictable conclusions. In the post War South, a very basic struggle was engaged between Whites and Blacks. The old Bourbons‚Äîwho were hardly less racist than the populists who succeeded them‚Äîmade some attempt to protect the interests of Black people, especially the small middle class and those whose families had been attached to them. There was also a sense of noblesse oblige. These honorable sentiments, however, seemed a bit antiquated in the midst of Reconstruction, and the ill effects of the Second Reconstruction, still being experienced in acute form in most of the USA, is a warning against social revolution.\\" * \\"What is racial profiling, if not an acknowledgment that different racial and ethnic groups are statistically more likely than other groups to engage in different sorts of illegal behavior. The Irish, who have a genetic weakness for alcohol, are too prone to get into fights, while Sicilians and South Italians have demonstrated an amazing ability to organize extortion, protection, prostitution, and gambling rackets. When O.J. Simpson kills a white woman or engages in other violent acts, he is simply living up to a statistical stereotype that informs us that African Americans, who make up less than 15% of the population, commit roughly 50% of violent crimes. And, O.J. is as exemplary a representative of his group's criminality as Bernie Madoff, John Gotti, Mohammed Atta, and Joaquin 'El Chapo' Loera Guzman (a billionaire Mexican drug lord who made the exclusive Forbes list in 2009) are of theirs.\\" The Southern Poverty Law Center has listed Fleming as a key intellectual in what it calls the \\"neo-Confederate\\" movement.Heidi Beirich and Mark Potok, \\"Ideologues\\" in Intelligence Report, online edition, Winter 2004. In a 2002 article on the paleoconservative trend in right wing politics, the SPLC stated: \\"While mainstream neo-conservatives are tight with the GOP, so- called paleocon intellectuals have carved a niche for themselves as staunch, old-right traditionalists who romanticize the pre-civil rights era South. Fleming, who is Chronicles' editor, has gone so far as to describe the 19th century Ku Klux Klan as a 'national liberation army.http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=97 Fleming has strenuously denied these allegations, writing: > It is an easy trick of propaganda to portray all natural affections in the > dark colors of prejudice.

The parish is about long north‚Äìsouth and about east‚Äìwest. The 2011 Census recorded the population of the modern Swalcliffe parish as 210. The toponym \\"Swalcliffe\\" comes from the Old English swealwe and clif, meaning a slope or cliff frequented by swallows. The ancient parish of Swalcliffe was larger than the present civil parish, and included the townships of Epwell, Shutford, Sibford Ferris and Sibford Gower. Archaeology About northeast of the village are the remains of an Iron Age hill fort on Madmarston Hill and the site of a Roman villa at Swalcliffe Lea. The hill fort is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The site of the villa is close to the course of a former Roman road running approximately east‚Äìwest. Its course is now a bridleway. One authority asserts that there was a Roman or Romano-British village here. Manor Swalcliffe Manor house has a 13th-century service wing and a 14th-century hall. In the 16th century the hall was divided up and a solar was added. The house has later additions including a 20th-century extension. It is a Grade I listed building. Parish church The Church of England parish church of SS Peter and Paul is Anglo-Saxon in origin but was rebuilt in the 12th and 14th centuries. The bell tower was built in the 13th century and made higher in the 15th century. The church is a Grade I listed building. The tower has a ring of six bells cast by Matthew I Bagley and Henry II Bagley of Chacombe, Northamptonshire in 1685. Richard Sanders of Bromsgrove recast one of them in 1720. SS Peter and Paul's parish is a member of the Benefice of Wykeham, along with the parishes of Broughton, Epwell, Shutford, Sibford Gower and Tadmarton. Tithe barn Swalcliffe Tithe Barn Swalcliffe tithe barn was built for New College, Oxford in 1401‚Äì07. It has an almost completely intact medieval timber half-cruck roof and is considered the finest medieval tithe barn in Oxfordshire and one of the best examples in England. It is a Grade I listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The barn is open free of charge on Sundays from Easter to October and houses part of the Oxfordshire Museum'sThe Oxfordshire Museum collection of traditional agricultural and trade vehicles and an exhibition of 2,500 years of Swalcliffe history. The building has similarities to the tithe barns at Adderbury and Upper Heyford, which also were built for New College around the beginning of the 15th century.

At its most specific, Northern Shaolin refers to a style called Northern Shaolin Boxing School ( ), disseminated by Gu Yu-jeung (1894‚Äì1952; also known as Ku Yu-cheung or, in Pinyin, Gu Ruzhang). Northern styles Manchu banner soldier, a caste of professional martial artists active in Chinese society as recently as a hundred years ago Northern styles/Bƒõi p√†i (ÂåóÊ¥æ) feature deeply extended postures‚Äîsuch as the horse, bow, drop, and dragon stances‚Äîconnected by quick fluid transitions, able to quickly change the direction in which force is issued.Jwing Ming Yang and Jeffery A. Bolt (1981), Shaolin Long Fist Kung Fu, Unique Publications, Brian Klingborg (1999), The Secrets of Northern Shaolin Kung-Fu, Tuttle Pub, Jeffery A. Bolt and Jwing-Ming Yang (2000), Northern Shaolin Sword: Form, Techniques & Applications, YMAA Publication Center, The group of Northern martial arts includes many illustrious styles such as Baguazhang, Bajiquan, ChƒÅqu√°n, Chuojiao, Eagle Claw, Mizongyi, Northern Praying Mantis and Taijiquan. Ch√°ngqu√°n is often identified as the representative Northern style and forms a separate division in modern Wushu curriculum. Northern styles exhibit a distinctively different flavor from the martial arts practiced in the South. In general, the training characteristics of northern styles put more focus on legwork, kicking and acrobatics. The influence of Northern styles can be found in traditional Korean martial arts and their emphasis on high-level kicks.Stanly E. Henning (2000), \\"Chinese Influences on Korean Martial Arts\\" in Martial arts of the world: an encyclopedia, edited by Thomas A. Green, Published by ABC-CLIO, 2001, page 299, It has been suggested that the presence of high kicks and flying kicks found in Southern styles, in Okinawan martial arts, and hence in modern non-Chinese styles such as karate and taekwondo (and by extension modern kickboxing) are due to influence from northern styles during the first half of the 20th century.William Durbin Mastering Kempo, 2001 p. 11.  Characteristics  The Northern Shaolin style of kung fu is one of the most prominent traditional northern styles of Chinese martial arts. The northern styles of kung-fu generally emphasize long range techniques, quick advances and retreats, wide stances, kicking and leaping techniques, whirling circular blocks, quickness, agility, and aggressive attacks. The system teaches empty-hand techniques and weaponry through predetermined combinations, known as forms, routines, or movement of sets. The students learn the basics by practicing the routines until the movements in the routines can be executed naturally based on instinct. Then, two or multiple man sets are practiced to train responses and applications of techniques learned from the sets. The practice sets/routines are not only practical in applications but are also graceful and artistic in nature. The fluidness of the movements combined with acrobatic techniques are trademarks of the Northern Shaolin sets. The Northern Shaolin style was made famous by the late Gu Yu-jeung. Many legends tell of Gu's feats; according to tales related by his close students, Gu's father was an accomplished exponent of the Tan Tui (\\"springing leg\\") form. When he was young, Gu traveled throughout Northern China to learn all the northern kung fu systems. He was renowned for his Iron Palm techniques and the application of the long spear. He organized all his learnings into what is today's Northern Shaolin style.Content provided by Sifu Kenneth Hui of the Northern Shaolim Kung Fu Association  History  The monastery in Henan is the original Shaolin Monastery. The monks began to practice military weapons sometime around the Tang Dynasty and became famous for aiding the future Emperor Li Shimin in struggles against rebellious forces. The monks were primarily known for their spear and staff techniques until the Ming-Qing transition when they began to specialize in unarmed combat. As the reputation of the Shaolin martial arts grew during the following centuries, its name became synonymous with martial arts, regardless of whether an individual art traced its origins to the Shaolin Monastery in Henan or not.Shahar, Meir. The Shaolin Monastery: History, Religion, and the Chinese Martial Arts. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2008 () As a result, the \\"Shaolin\\" moniker was applied to other Buddhist temples with strong reputations for martial arts. The characteristics of the martial arts taught at each temple were so different from each other that they became identified with their place of origin. = The Northern Shaolin curriculum of Gu Ru Zhang (Ku Yu Cheung) = The Northern Shaolin (ÂåóÂ∞ëÊûó denotes Henan Ê≤≥ÂçóÂ¥áÂ±±Â∞ëÊûóÂØ∫ temple) style associated with Gu Ruzhang was first taught to a lay disciple, the celebrated 18th century master Gan Fengchi of Jiangsu Province, by a Shaolin monk named Zhao Yuan, born Zhu Fu, a member of the Ming royal family who joined the sangha after the Ming was overthrown by the Qing in 1644. (Gan is also remembered for founding the martial art HuƒÅqu√°n Ëä±Êã≥, literally \\"flower fist\\", about which he wrote the book Introduction to HuƒÅqu√°n.) Gan in turn taught Wan Bangcai, who taught Yan Degong, who taught Yan Sansen, who taught Yan Jiwen, who taught his nephew Gu Ruzhang.

On a famous occasion in 1931, Gu is said to have demonstrated the latter on a horse. Among the martial artists who gathered at the Central National Martial Arts Institute in Nanjing in 1928, Gu placed in the top fifteen and was included--alongside Fu Zhensong, Li Xianwu, Wan Laimin, Wan Laisheng, and Wong Shao Chou (on other accounts, Wan Laiping)--in the Five Southbound Tigers (‰∫îËôé‰∏ãÊ±üÂçó, Pinyin W«îh«î Xi√† JiƒÅngn√°n; literally, \\"five tigers heading south of the great river\\"), five masters of the Northern Chinese martial arts sent to Guangzhou (Canton) to organize another National Martial Arts Institute.

These are the 10 forms as standardized by Gu, comprising the core of the system, sometimes known as the Ten Classical Forms. They are standard in all of Gu's Northern Shaolin Kung Fu lineages. However, as mentioned above, they are sometimes taught or learned in differing orders. As with many different martial arts, from lineage to lineage, one may find slight differences in the way the movements are expressed. Students learning this style usually do not only learn the 10 core forms however. There are often additional teachings such as introductory material and forms, weapons forms, qigong, etc. In popular culture *Northern Shaolin is the basis for firebending in Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra.

The film's cast includes Joe Mantegna, William H. Macy, and Ving Rhames. It was entered in the 1991 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Bobby Gold is a homicide detective on the trail of Robert Randolph, a drug-dealer and cop-killer on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. En route to nab an accomplice of Randolph, Gold and his partner Tim Sullivan happen upon a murder scene: the elderly Jewish owner of a candy store in a ghetto has been gunned down, reportedly for a fortune hidden in her basement. The deceased woman's son, a doctor, uses his clout to have Gold assigned to the case in the belief that Gold, himself Jewish, might be empathetic to his plight. Gold, however, seems to disregard his ethnicity and is irritated about being pulled off a much higher-profile case. Ultimately, though, this is offset by interactions with members of the Jewish community that play on Gold's feelings of inadequacy and inability to fit in. A nighttime survey of the crime scene uncovers an important piece of the woman's past, and Gold's reluctance turns to curiosity, leading to the discovery of a Zionist organization operating in the city. The apparent power and sense of pride these people have is appealing to Gold, and he attempts to become a part of their group. Gold is thrust into a series of circumstances that test not only his loyalty to the badge, but also his newfound Jewish consciousness. Cast * Joe Mantegna as Bobby Gold * William H.

An outfielder, Brovia played almost 1,800 games over 15 seasons in minor league baseball but only 21 games as a pinch hitter at the Major League level with the 1955 Cincinnati Redlegs. The native of Davenport, California, threw right-handed, batted left-handed, and was listed at tall and . Brovia was a longtime star outfielder in the Pacific Coast League with the San Francisco Seals, Portland Beavers, Sacramento Solons, and the Oakland Oaks from 1941‚Äì42 and from 1946‚Äì55. He served in the United States Army during World War II and missed the 1943‚Äì45 seasons. Known best for his batting, Brovia had a lifetime .311 average in 1,805 minor league games (.304 lifetime in the PCL) producing 1,846 hits, 1,144 RBIs and 214 home runs. As a prolific hitter, Brovia was popular with the fans, especially for his home runs over the four-story high fence at Seals Stadium, called the \\"Green Monster\\" of the Coast League. However, his defensive skills were poor and this prevented him from ever succeeding in Major League Baseball. He had a short stint at age 33 with the Redlegs, but only batted as a pinch hitter. In 21 games and plate appearances, he collected two singles and one base on balls, and drove in four runs. After his shot with the Redlegs, he played the next season in Mexico, after which he retired. Brovia died from cancer in Santa Cruz, California. He was inducted posthumously into the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame in 2005.

The island is about 25 km in length and 19 km in width. In the centre is an active volcano with two nested calderas.  Geography  The land is covered with the volcanic andesitic lava. The soil is very fertile and used for growing food crop and cash crop. The island is full of betel-nut, mustard plant and lime. The island is also known for the view from the mountain looking down to Madang town. The latest eruptions on this island occurred in the 1970s. The 1974‚Äì1975 eruption produced a large volume of lava which covered almost 70% of the inner caldera's floor, while 1979 produced no lava flow, but killed the two volcanologists, Robin Cooke and Elias Ravian. The volcano erupted as recently as February 26, 2013. The population of approximately 70,000 is mostly Lutheran and Catholic and speaks the two languages Waskia and Takia. Most people also speak Tok Pisin, and English is taught in the schools. Neighboring islands are Bagabag (Papua New Guinea) and Manam. A single road runs around the entire length of the island. Karkar Secondary School is the only high school. There is one hospital, Gaubin Hospital, known formally as the Edwin & Tabitha Tscharke Memorial Hospital, which is run by the Lutheran Health Service and staffed by several rotating German doctors. The hospital includes a training center for Community Health Workers. The two main exports from the island are cacao and coconuts, which can grow in the same soil due to vast height differences. Large plantations are generally family-owned. History The first recorded sighting by Europeans of Karkar Island was by the Spanish navigator I√±igo √ìrtiz de Retes on 10 August 1545 when on board of the carrack San Juan tried to return from Tidore to New Spain.Coello, Francisco \\"Conflicto hispano-alem√°n\\" Bolet√≠n de Sociedad Geogr√°fica de Madrid, t.XIX. 2¬∫ semestre 1885, Madrid, p.317. It was later visited by Willem Schouten and Jacob le Maire and called \\"High island\\". In 1643 Abel Tasman passed the island. William Dampier visited the island, probably in 1699. The volcano erupted in 1895. During World War II, the Imperial Japanese occupied the island. The Australian 37th/52nd Battalion landed on 2 June 1944, to find that the Japanese had evacuated the island and Australian 5th Division troops landed on the island at Biu Bay and Kavilo Bay on 6 June 1944. An excellent account of the history of Karkar Island, from the 1920s to the present day, is provided in the autobiography of Sir John Middleton Kt, OBE, My Life on Karkar Island, Papua New Guinea. Climate Karkar island has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with heavy to very heavy rainfall year-round.

When Moran was one year old, her father died in an automobile accident. A few years later, her mother married Dr. Timothy Moran. She suffered a second loss at age 9, when her stepfather (whom she later described as \\"my dearest person in the world next to mother\\") died from influenza. She attended Seton Hill Academy in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. In 1921, when Lois was 12, she and her mother moved to Paris, France, with funding provided by Lois's great-aunt. Stage Moran's stage activities included singing and dancing at the Paris National Opera when she was 13 years old. Her Broadway credits include Of Thee I Sing (1931) and This Is New York (1930). Film Moran in the 1920s. Moran's film career began when she made her first film in Paris at age 14. She is probably best known for her role as Laurel Dallas, daughter of the title character, in the 1925 film Stella Dallas, which was her Hollywood film debut. She appeared in early sound movies such as Behind That Curtain (1929), and some musical movies, such as A Song of Kentucky (1929), Words and Music (1929), and Mammy (1930). She then moved to Broadway, where she appeared in the play This Is New York (1930), and the musicals Of Thee I Sing (1933) and Let 'Em Eat Cake (1934). Television Moran also had a co- starring role in the short-lived TV series Waterfront (1954‚Äì1955). It starred Preston Foster as Capt. John Herrick and Moran as his wife May Herrick. Personal life In 1927, she had a short affair with writer F. Scott Fitzgerald who had just moved with his wife to Hollywood in order to write a flapper comedy for United Artists. Lois became a temporary muse for the author and he rewrote Rosemary Hoyt, one of the central characters in Tender is the Night, (who had been a male in earlier drafts) to closely mirror her. In 1935, she married Clarence M. Young, assistant secretary of commerce, temporarily retiring from her acting career. They had one son, Timothy, and remained together until Young's death in 1973. Death Moran died at a nursing home in Sedona, Arizona after suffering from cancer. She was cremated, and her ashes were scattered in the Red Rock country in Arizona. She was survived by her son Timothy.

It is primarily used to manage the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but it does not slow down the disease or stop it from getting worse. It is taken by mouth. It can take two to three weeks of treatment before benefits are seen. Each dose then begins working in about ten minutes to two hours with a duration of effect of about five hours. Common side effects include movement problems and nausea. More serious side effects include depression, low blood pressure with standing, sudden onset of sleepiness, psychosis, and increased risk-taking behavior. Carbidopa prevents the breakdown of levodopa outside the brain. In the brain, levodopa is broken down into dopamine by which it has its effects. Carbidopa also helps prevent some of the nausea which levodopa causes. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 184th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than three million prescriptions. Medical uses=Parkinson's disease= It is primarily used to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease but does not change the course of the disease. It can take two to three weeks of treatment before benefits are seen. Each dose then begins working in about ten minutes to two hours depending on the formulation, with a duration of effect of about five hours. A formulation that can be given in an intra-intestinal pump, known as Duodopa, is being developed. =Other= Other uses include for dopamine-responsive dystonia (DRD) and restless legs syndrome. There is tentative evidence that it is useful in amblyopia when used with other treatments. Side effects Common side effects include movement problems, and nausea. The most common early side effect is hallucinations, as movement problems manifest 5‚Äì10 years after initiation of treatment. More serious side effects include depression, low blood pressure with standing, sudden onset of sleepiness, and the compulsion to gamble, engage in sexual behavior, or other risk-taking behavior.  Mechanism of action  Levodopa is converted to dopamine via the action of a naturally occurring enzyme called DOPA decarboxylase. This occurs both in the peripheral circulation and in the central nervous system after levodopa has crossed the blood brain barrier. Activation of central dopamine receptors improves the symptoms of Parkinson's disease; however, activation of peripheral dopamine receptors causes nausea and vomiting. For this reason levodopa is usually administered in combination with a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI), in this case carbidopa, which is very polar (and charged at physiologic pH) and cannot cross the blood brain barrier, however prevents peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine and thereby reduces the unwanted peripheral side effects of levodopa. Use of carbidopa also increases the quantity of levodopa in the bloodstream that is available to enter the brain. History In 1960 the Austrian biochemist Oleh Hornykiewicz, while at the University of Vienna, examined results of autopsies of patients who had died with Parkinson's disease. He suggested that the disease was associated with, or caused by, a reduction in the levels of dopamine in the basal ganglia of the brain. Since dopamine itself did not enter the brain, he tried treating twenty patients with a racemic mixture of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), which could enter the brain and be converted there to dopamine by the action of DOPA decarboxylase. His results were positive, as were those of another trial in Montreal run by Andr√© Barbeau. Unfortunately, other investigators were unable to replicate these early results, and the use of DOPA remained in question until 1967, when George Cotzias at the Brookhaven National Laboratories in Upton, New York, used megadoses of DOPA, up to 16 grams per day. Not long after these results became known, Curt Porter at Merck showed that L-DOPA was the active stereoisomer, thus reducing the effective dose to half. With L-DOPA identified as the active form, Alfred Pletscher and his colleagues at Hoffman- LaRoche synthesized benserazide, an inhibitor of DOPA decarboxylase, which further reduced the required dose. A drug combining L-DOPA with benserazide was marketed under the brand name of Madopar. Independent work was carried out by Victor Lotti at Merck in West Point, Pennsylvania. Merck had already synthesized and patented carbidopa, another dopa decarboxylase inhibitor in 1962, and in 1971 Lotti showed that the use of the L-form of carbidopa, further reduced the therapeutic dose of L-DOPA. The combination of L-carbidopa and L-DOPA was marketed under the brand name of Sinemet.Scriabine, Alexander (1999). \\"Discovery and Development of Major Drugs Currently in Use\\", pp. 222-223 in Pharmaceutical Innovation: Revolutionizing Human Health, edited by Ralph Landau, Basil Achilladelis, and Alexander Scriabine. Philadelphia: Chemical Heritage Press. . Society and culture=Cost= It is available as a generic medication and is moderately expensive. =Names= The generic name under the BAN system is Co-careldopa. It is sold under several brand names, including Sinemet (Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited), Pharmacopa, Atamet, Apo-Levocarb, Duodopa, Kinson, and Pharmacopa, among others. Extended-release formulations are sold as Rytary and Sinemet-CR. An extended-release enteral solution is sold as Duopa. =Shortages= In 1991, Merck licensed the rights to the manufacture and sale of Sinemet to a newly created joint venture, DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Company. That same year, approvals for a sustained release formulation (Sinemet CR) which could be taken less frequently were also obtained.Sinemet at Dupont Heritage. DuPont purchased Merck's share in the joint venture in 1998 and began operating the company as DuPont Pharmaceuticals (DuPont Pharma), but Merck continued to manufacture the drug for DuPont.SINEMET at listingdrugs.com Starting in late 2009 and continuing into 2011 Merck stopped manufacturing the drug while awaiting regulatory approvals due to a change in the supplier of the active ingredient. This resulted in shortages of the brand name products Sinemet and Sinemet CR, although alternative generic versions were still available.Letter From MERCK About SINEMET Shortage at Bibmomma's Blog ‚Äì Reflections of an early onset Parkinson's patient.

Household chemicals are non-food chemicals that are commonly found and used in and around the average household. They are a type of consumer goods, designed particularly to assist cleaning, house and yard maintenance, cooking, pest control and general hygiene purposes. Food additives generally do not fall under this category, unless they have a use other than for human consumption. Additives in general (e.g. stabilizers and coloring found in washing powder and dishwasher detergents) make the classification of household chemicals more complex, especially in terms of health - some of these chemicals are irritants or potent allergens - and ecological effects. Together with non-compostable household waste, the chemicals found in private household commodities pose a serious ecological problem. In addition to having slightly adverse up to seriously toxic effects when swallowed, chemical agents around may contain flammable or corrosive substances. Various household cleaning products have been developed to help remove dust and dirt, for surface maintenance, and for disinfection.Wolkoff P, Schneider T, Kildeso J, Degerth R, Jaroszewski, and Schunk H. Science of the Total Environment, 215, (1998) pg. 135‚Äì156 Products are available in powder, liquid or spray form. The basic ingredients determine the type of cleaning tasks for which they are suitable. Some are marketed as general-purpose cleaning materials, while others are targeted at specific cleaning tasks such as drain clearing, oven cleaning, lime scale removal and polishing furniture. Household cleaning products provide aesthetic and hygiene benefits, but may cause health risks.Kwon KD, Jo WK, Lim JH, and Jcong WS. Environ Sci Pollut Res 15, (2008) pg. 521‚Äì526 The US Department of Health and Human Services offers the public access to the Household Products Database, with consumer information on over 4,000 products based on information provided by the manufacturer through the material safety data sheet. Surfactants lower the surface tension of water, allowing it to flow into smaller tiny cracks and crevices in soils, making removal easier. Alkaline chemicals break down known soils such as grease and mud. Acids break down soils such as lime scale, soap scum, and stains of mustard, coffee, tea, and alcoholic beverages. Some solvent-based products are flammable and some can dissolve paint and varnish. Disinfectants stop smell and stains caused by bacteria. When multiple chemicals are applied to the same surface without full removal of the earlier substance, the chemicals may interact. This interaction may reduce the efficiency of the chemicals applied (such as a change in pH value caused by mixing alkalis and acids) and in some cases may even emit toxic fumes. An example of this is the mixing of ammonia-based cleaners (or acid-based cleaners) and bleach.Nazaroff, WW., Weschler, CJ., Atmospheric Environment. 38 (2004) pg. 2841‚Äì2865 This causes the production of chloramines that volatilize (become gaseous), causing acute inflammation of the lungs (toxic pneumonitis), long-term respiratory damage, and potential death.Reisz, GR., Gammon, RS. Toxic Pneumonitis from mixing household chemicals. CHEST 89 (1986) pg. 49‚Äì52 Residue from cleaning products and cleaning activity (dusting, vacuuming, sweeping) has been shown to worsen indoor air quality (IAQ) by redistributing particulate matter (dust, dirt, human skin cells, organic matter, animal dander, particles from combustion, fibers from insulation, pollen, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) to which gaseous or liquid particles can be adsorbed. The concentration of such particulate matter and chemical residual will highest immediately after cleaning, and will decrease over time depending upon levels of contaminants, air exchange rate, and other sources of chemical residual. Of most concern are the family of chemicals called VOCs such as formaldehyde, toluene, and limonene.Burton, A. Environmental Health Perspectives ‚Äì Indoor Air Quality. Vol. 115 #7 (2007) pg. 350 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released from many household cleaning products such as disinfectants, polishes, floor waxes, air-freshening sprays, all-purpose cleaning sprays, and glass cleaner. These products have been shown to emit irritating vapors.Raizenne M., Dales R., Burnett, R., Canadian Jour of Public Health. Air Pollution Exposures and Children's Health.

(2007) pg. 735‚Äì741 VOCs tend to evaporate and then to be inhaled into the lungs or adsorbed by dust, which can also be inhaled. Aerosolized (spray) cleaning products are important risk factors and may aggravate symptoms of adult asthma, respiratory irritation, childhood asthma, wheeze, bronchitis, and allergy. Other modes of exposure to potentially harmful household cleaning chemicals include absorption through the skin (dermis), accidental ingestion, and accidental splashing into the eyes. Products for the application and safe use of the chemicals are also available, such as nylon scrub sponges and rubber gloves.Bredenberg, Jeff et al. 1998. Clean it Fast, Clean it right. Emmaus, PA, USA:Rodale. . It is up to consumers to keep themselves safe while using these chemicals. Reading and understanding the labels is important. Chemicals used for cleaning toilets, sinks, and bathtubs can find their way into sewage water and can often not be effectively removed or filtered. There is a growing consumer and governmental interest in natural cleaning products and green cleaning methods. The use of nontoxic household chemicals is growing as consumers become more informed about the health effects of many household chemicals, and municipalities are having to deal with the expensive disposal of household hazardous waste (HHW).Adams, D., Werner, CM., Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy.

He was hereditary Constable of EnglandIn some sources Miles's name is not translated from the Latin Milo and Sheriff of Gloucestershire. He inherited vast landholdings in Wales from his wife Sibyl de Neufmarch√© (whose father had conquered the independent kingdom of Brycheiniog (Brecknockshire, modern: Breconshire) in South Wales, which became the Lordship of Brecknock, and other lands in Gloucestershire from his father (the nucleus of which were the Domesday Book holdings of his great-uncle Durand of Gloucester)Sanders, I.J. English Baronies: A Study of their Origin and Descent 1086-1327, Oxford, 1960, p.7, note 1 and acquired other large landholdings himself, including the extensive Lordship of Abergavennny in South Wales, and St Briavel's Castle and the Forest of Dean in the west of Gloucestershire. These combined lands became a feudal barony, now known as the \\"Barony of Miles of Gloucester\\". By his three daughters and eventual co-heiresses his barony was split between the families of de Bohun, which inherited the fiefdom of Durand of Gloucester (Miles's great- uncle),Namely 14 1/2 knights-fees centred on Haresfield in Gloucestershire, (Sanders, I.J. English Baronies: A Study of their Origin and Descent 1086-1327, Oxford, 1960, p.7, & note 2) the hereditary Constabulary of England and was re-created Earl of Hereford in 1200; de Braose, which inherited the Lordships of Brecon and Abergavenny; and FitzHerbert, which inherited Blaen Llyfni. In 1136 he founded Llanthony Secunda Priory half-a-mile south of Gloucester Castle, in the chapter house of which he and many of his de Bohun descendants were buried.George Roberts, Some account of Llanthony Priory, Monmouthshire, London, 1847, Appendix, pp.63 et seq John of Salisbury classed him with Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex and others as non tam comites regni quam hostes publici (\\"not so much earls of the kingdom as public enemies\\"). The charge is justified by his public policy; but the materials for appraising his personal character do not exist. Origins He was the son and heir of Walter of Gloucester (d.1129), hereditary Sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1097 and in 1105‚Äì6, and Castellan of Gloucester Castle. Walter was also seemingly Constable of England under King Henry I (1100-1135), as he is described in an annal of Llanthony Secunda Priory (transcribed by DugdaleMonasticon Anglicanum...a History of the Abbies and Other Monasteries...and ... By William Dugdale ) as Constabularius, princeps militiae domus regiae, vir magnus et potens et inter primos regni praecipue honoratus (\\"Constable, chief of the royal military household, a great and powerful man and amongst the first of the kingdom especially honoured\\"). Some sources however suggest that Walter was merely the Constable of Gloucester Castle. Walter's wife (and Miles's mother) was a certain Berta. Walter was in favour with King Henry I (1100-1135), three of whose charters to him are extant. cites Duchy of Lancaster: Royal Charters. Walter's father was Roger de Pitres, Sheriff of Gloucestershire from about 1071, who at some time before 1083 was succeeded by his brother Durand of Gloucester (d. circa 1096), Sheriff of Gloucestershire at the time of the Domesday Book of 1086, who made Walter his heir. Career Llanthony Secunda Priory, remains of precinct wall north of Inner Gatehouse Early in 1121 Miles married Sibyl de Neufmarch√©, daughter and heiress of Bernard de Neufmarch√©, the conqueror of Brycheiniog, which brought him her father's possessions (such as the new Lordship of Brecknock). In the Pipe Roll of 1130 Walter is found to have been succeeded by his son, cites Rot. Pip.. 31 Hen. I. having died in or around 1126. Miles was (from 1128 at least) sheriff of Gloucestershire, a justice itinerant, and a justice of the forest, and by 1130 was sheriff of Staffordshire. He had also (though the fact has been doubted) been granted his father's office of constable by a special charter. cites Dugdale MSS. In conjunction with Pain fitzJohn, sheriff of Herefordshire and Shropshire, he ruled the whole Welsh border \\"from the Severn to the sea\\". cites Gesta Stephani, p. 17. On his accession, King Stephen set himself to secure the allegiance of these two lords-marchers, who at length, on receiving a safe-conduct and obtaining all they asked for, did him homage. It was at Reading that they met the king early in 1136.\\"[This is known] from two charters there tested, one of which was printed by Madox (History of the Exchequer, p. 135), by which Stephen confirms to Miles, 'sicut baroni et justiciario meo', the shrievalty of Gloucestershire, the constableship of Gloucester Castle, and the 'honour' of Brecknock\\" . Miles is next found attending the Easter court at Westminster as one of the royal constables, cites . and, shortly after, the Oxford council in the same capacity. cites Rich. Hexham, p. 149. He was then despatched to the aid of the widow of Richard fitz Gilbert de Clare, who was beleaguered in her castle by the Welsh and whom he rescued. cites Gesta, p. 13. Meanwhile, Miles had married his son and heir, Roger, to Cecily, daughter of fitzJohn, who inherited the bulk of her father's possessions. cites Duchy Charters. In the same year 1136 Miles transferred the original house of Augustinian canons at Llanthony Priory, Monmouthshire to a site on the south side of Gloucester, which they named Llanthony Secunda. cites Mon. Angl. vi. (1), 127, 132. Two years later (1138) Miles received, in his official capacity, Stephen at Gloucester in May. cites Cont. Flor. Wig. ii. 105. He has been said to have renounced his allegiance a few weeks later,; . but he was with Stephen in August (1138) at the siege of Shrewsbury, and his defection did not take place till 1139. In February 1139 Stephen gave Gloucester Abbey to Miles's kinsman Gilbert Foliot at his request.; . In the summer of 1139, however, he joined his lord, Robert, Earl of Gloucester, in inviting Empress Matilda to England.; . On her arrival Miles met her at Bristol, welcomed her to Gloucester, recognised her as his rightful sovereign, and became thenceforth her ardent supporter. She at once gave him St. Briavels Castle and the Forest of Dean. Miles's first achievement on behalf of Matilda was to relieve Brian Fitz Count who was blockaded in Wallingford Castle. cites Gesta, p. 59. In November (1139) he again advanced from Gloucester and attacked and burnt Worcester. cites Cont. Flor. Wig. p. 119. He also captured the castles of Winchcombe, Cerne, and Hereford. cites Gesta, p. 60. Meanwhile, he was deprived by Stephen of his office of constable. cites Cont. Flor. Wig. p. 121. He took part in the victory at Lincoln (2 February 1141), cites Gesta, p. 69. and on the consequent triumph of the empress he accompanied her in her progress, and was one of her three chief followers on her entry (2 March) into Winchester. cites Cont. Flor. Wig. p. 130; Will. Malm. p. 743. He was with her at Reading when she advanced on London, cites Add. Cart. pp. 19, 576. and on reaching St. Albans Matilda bestowed on him a house at Westminster. cites Duchy Charters, No. 16. He was among those who fled with her from London shortly after, and it was on his advice, when they reached Gloucester, that she ventured back to Oxford. cites Cont. Flor. Wig. p. 132. There, on 25 July 1141, she bestowed on him the town and castle of Hereford and made him earl of that shire, cites F≈ìdera, i. 14. as well as the forests of the Hay of Hereford and Trinela See Appendix, p242; also p67 in avowed consideration of his faithful service. With singular unanimity hostile chroniclers testify to his devotion to her cause. He even boasted that she had lived at his expense throughout her stay in England. cites Cont. Flor. Wig. p. 133. As \\"Earl Miles\\", he now accompanied her to Winchester, cites Gesta, p. 79 and on the rout of her forces on 14 September 1141 he escaped to Gloucester, where he arrived \\"exhausted, alone, and with scarcely a rag to his back\\". cites Cont. Flor. Wig. p. 135. Towards the end of the year he was in Bristol making a grant to Llanthony Priory in the presence of the Empress Matilda and the Robert, Earl of Gloucester. cites Mon. Angl. vi. 137. In 1142 he is proved by charters to have been with the Empress at Oxford and to have received her permission to hold Abergavenny Castle of Brian Fitz Count. cites Duchy Charters, No. 17. It is probably to the summer of this year that he made a formal deed of alliance with the Earl of Gloucester, and as a hostage he gave the Earl his son Mahel. In 1143 Miles's pressing want of money to pay his troops led him to demand large sums from the church lands. Robert de Bethune, Bishop of Hereford, withstood his demands, and, on the Earl invading his lands, excommunicated him and his followers, and laid the diocese under interdict. cites Gesta, p. 102; Mon. Angl. vi. (1), 133. The Earl's kinsman, Gilbert Foliot (Abbot of Gloucester), appealed to the legate on his behalf against the bishop's severity. cites Foliot, Letters, No. 3. Death and burial On Christmas-eve of 1143 he was slain while hunting by a stray arrow shot at a deer. cites Symeon of Durham ii. 315; Gervase, i. 126; Gesta, pp. 16, 95, 103. A dispute at once arose for possession of his body between the canons of Llanthony Secunda, his own foundation, and the monks of Gloucester. The case was heard before the bishops of Worcester, Hereford, and St. David's, and was terminated by a compromise on 28 December. The Earl was then buried in the chapter-house at Llanthony. cites Gloucester Cartulary, i. lxxv; Foliot, Letters, No. 65. Succession In the 1815 map of Gloucester, the County Gaol occupies the site of Gloucester Castle, residence of Miles of Gloucester as royal constable, in demolished 1787. At bottom left, half a mile away are the remains of Llanthony Secunda Priory, founded by Miles of Gloucester and his burial place. Miles was succeeded by his eldest son and heir, Roger Fitzmiles, 2nd Earl of Hereford, who died without an heir twelve years later in 1155, when the Earldom of Hereford became extinct. The shrievalty of Hereford and Gloucester passed to his younger brother Walter de Hereford. On the death of the latter and two other brothers with no children the family possessions passed to their sisters and their descendants, namely Bertha of Hereford who through her marriage brought Abergavenny to William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber, and Margaret of Hereford, the eldest sister, taking the bulk (Liber Niger) to Humphrey II de Bohun, later (1199) Earls of Hereford, and Constables of England, in recognition of their descent from Miles. Marriage and children In 1121 he married Sibyl de Neufmarch√©, daughter and heiress of Bernard de Neufmarch√© (d.1125), Lord of Brecon, and Agnes or Nest, daughter of Osbern fitzRichard by his wife Nest, a daughter of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, King of Wales. By Sibyl he had issue including: =Sons= *Roger Fitzmiles, 2nd Earl of Hereford (d.1155), eldest son and heir, hereditary Sheriff of Gloucestershire; *Walter de Hereford (d.post-1159) heir to his elder brother Roger. He was hereditary Sheriff of Gloucestershire 1155‚Äì1157 and Sheriff of Herefordshire 1155‚Äì1159. He died after 1159 in the Holy Land. *Henry of Hereford (d. 12 April 1165), who succeeded to the Lordship of Abergavenny in 1141/42. *William de Hereford. He died before 1160 childless. *Mahel de Hereford (d.October 1165), 4th son, who died at Bronllys Castle, Breconshire, Wales, mortally injured by a stone toppled from a tower during a fire. He died childless and was buried at Llanthony Secunda Priory. =Daughters and eventual co-heiresses= *Margaret of Hereford, co-heiress of the last of her brothers, whose 1/3rd moiety share of her fraternal inheritance of the barony of Miles of Gloucester appears to have comprised the fiefdom of Durand of Gloucester (Miles's great-uncle), namely 14 1/2 knights-fees centred on Haresfield in Gloucestershire.Sanders, I.J. English Baronies: A Study of their Origin and Descent 1086-1327, Oxford, 1960, p.7, & note 2 She also inherited the patronage of Llanthony Secunda Priory, her father's foundation where many of her Bohun descendants were buried.George Roberts, Some account of Llanthony Priory, Monmouthshire, London, 1847, Appendix, p.64 She married Humphrey II de Bohun, 4th feudal baron of TrowbridgeSanders, p.91, Trowbridge in Wiltshire, by whom her grandson was Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford (1176-1220), who in 1199 (following the extinction of the male line of Miles of Gloucester) was created by King John Earl of Hereford and Constable of England. *Bertha of Hereford, co-heiress of the last of her brothers, whose share of her fraternal inheritance was the Lordships of Brecon and Abergavenny.

An inverted nipple (occasionally invaginated nipple) is a condition where the nipple, instead of pointing outward, is retracted into the breast. In some cases, the nipple will be temporarily protruded if stimulated. Both women and men can have inverted nipples. Causes The most common causes of nipple inversion include: * Born with condition * Trauma which can be caused by conditions such as fat necrosis, scars, or a result of surgery * Breast sagging, drooping or ptosis * Breast cancer **Breast carcinoma **Paget's disease **Inflammatory breast cancer * Breast infections or inflammations **Mammary duct ectasia **Breast abscess **Mastitis * Genetic variant of nipple shape, such as: **Weaver syndrome **Congenital disorder of glycosylation type 1A and 1 L **Kennerknecht-Sorgo-Oberhoffer syndrome * Gynecomastia * Recurrent infections * Tuberculosis Around 10‚Äì20% of all women are born with this condition. Most common nipple variations that women are born with are caused by short ducts or a wide areola muscle sphincter. Inverted nipples can also occur after sudden and major weight loss. One inverted nipple and one erect nipple Grading system The three grades of inverted nipples are defined on how easily the nipple may be protracted and the degree of fibrosis existent in the breast, as well as the damage it has caused on the milk ducts. Inverted nipple grade 1 refers to nipples that can easily be pulled out, by using finger pressure around the areola. The grade-1 inverted nipple maintains its projections and rarely retracts. Also, grade-1 inverted nipples may occasionally pop up without manipulation or pressure. Milk ducts are usually not compromised and breast feeding is possible. These are \\"shy nipples\\". It is believed to have minimal or no fibrosis. There is no soft-tissue deficiency of the nipple. The lactiferous duct should be normal without any retraction. Inverted nipple grade 2 is the nipple which can be pulled out, though not as easily as the grade 1, but which retracts after pressure is released. Breast feeding is usually possible, though it is more likely to be hard to get the baby to latch comfortably in the first weeks after birth; extra help may be needed. Grade 2 nipples have a moderate degree of fibrosis. The lactiferous ducts are mildly retracted, but do not need to be cut for the release of fibrosis. On histological examination, these nipples have rich collagenous stromata with numerous bundles of smooth muscle. Inverted nipple grade 3 describes a severely inverted and retracted nipple which can rarely be pulled out physically and which requires surgery to be protracted. Milk ducts are often constricted, and breast feeding is difficult, but not necessarily impossible. With good preparation and help, babies often can drink at the breast, and milk production is not affected; after breastfeeding, nipples often are less or no longer inverted. Women with grade-3 inverted nipples may also struggle with infections, rashes, or problems with nipple hygiene. The fibrosis is remarkable and lactiferous ducts are short and severely retracted. The bulk of soft tissue is markedly insufficient in the nipple. Histologically, atrophic terminal duct lobular units and severe fibrosis are seen.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding  Individuals with inverted nipples may find that their nipples protract (come out) temporarily or permanently during pregnancy, or as a result of breastfeeding. Most women with inverted nipples who give birth are able to breastfeed without complication, but inexperienced mothers may experience higher than average pain and soreness when initially attempting to breastfeed. When a mother uses proper breastfeeding technique, the infant latches onto the areola, not the nipple, so women with inverted nipples are actually able to breastfeed without any problem. An infant that latches on well may be able to slush out an inverted nipple. The use of a breast pump or other suction device immediately before a feeding may help to draw out inverted nipples. A hospital grade electric pump may be used for this purpose. Some women also find that using a nipple shield can help facilitate breastfeeding. Frequent stimulation such as sexual intercourse and foreplay (such as nipple sucking) also helps the nipple protract. Piercing Another method of protracting inverted nipples is to have the nipple pierced. This method will only be effective if the nipple can be temporarily protracted. If pierced when protracted, the jewellery may prevent the nipple from returning to its inverted state. The success of both of these methods, from a cosmetic standpoint, is mixed. The piercing may actually correct the overly taut connective tissue to allow the nipple to become detached from underlying connective tissue and resume a more typical appearance. Other corrective strategies Other strategies for protracting inverted nipples include regularly stimulating the nipples to a protruding state, in an attempt to gradually loosen the nipple tissue. Some sex toys designed for nipple stimulation, such as suction cups or clamps, may also cause inverted nipples to protract or stay protracted longer. Some special devices are specifically designed to draw out inverted nipples, or a home-made nipple protractor can be constructed out of a 10-ml disposable syringe. These methods are often used in preparation for breastfeeding, which can sometimes cause inverted nipples to become protracted permanently. Two methods which are now discouraged are breast shells and the Hoffman technique. Breast shells may be used to apply gentle constant pressure to the areola to try to break any adhesions under the skin that are preventing the nipple from being drawn out. The shells are worn inside the bra. The Hoffman technique is a nipple-stretching exercise that may help loosen the adhesions at the base of the nipple when performed several times a day. Although both techniques are heavily promoted, a 1992 study found that not only do shells and the Hoffman technique not promote more successful breastfeeding, but they may also actually disrupt it.

The term \\"stilbestrol\\" is often used incorrectly to refer to DES, but they are not the same compound. Stilbestrol itself is an active estrogen but is less potent than DES and other derivatives. Stilbestrol derivatives The stilbestrol estrogenic drugs include the following: * Acefluranol (an antiestrogen) * Benzestrol (technically not a stilbestrol derivative due to its elongated central chain, but a very close analogue and grouped with the stilbestrol estrogens in any case) * Bifluranol * Dienestrol ** Dienestrol acetate * Diethylstilbestrol (commonly, but erroneously shortened to simply ‚Äústilbestrol‚Äù) ** Diethylstilbestrol diacetate ** Diethylstilbestrol dilaurate ** Diethylstilbestrol dipalmitate ** Diethylstilbestrol dipropionate ** Diethylstilbestrol disulfate ** Diethylstilbestrol monobenzyl ether ** Dimestrol (dianisylhexene, diethylstilbestrol dimethyl ether, dimethoxydiethylstilbene) ** Fosfestrol (diethylstilbestrol diphosphate) ** Furostilbestrol (diethylstilbestrol difuroate) ** ICI-85966 (diethylstilbestrol bis[di(2-chloroethyl)carbamate) ** Mestilbol (diethylstilbestrol monomethyl ether) * Dimethylstilbestrol * Hexestrol (dihydrodiethylstilbestrol) ** Diaethiphenum (hexestrol bis(2-diethylaminoethyl) ether) (a coronary vasodilator) ** Hexestrol diacetate ** Hexestrol dicaprylate ** Hexestrol diphosphate ** Hexestrol dipropionate ** Phenestrol (hexestrol bis[4-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]phenylacetate) * Methestrol (promethestrol; dimethylhexestrol) ** Methestrol dipropionate (promethestrol dipropionate) * Pentafluranol * Terfluranol Of the stilbestrol estrogens, diethylstilbestrol, hexestrol, and benzestrol are the most well-known. =Mechanism of action= The stilbestrol estrogens bind with high affinity to both ERŒ± and ERŒ≤. =Closely related compounds= Triphenylethylene. Estrogens closely related to the stilbestrols include paroxypropione (a metabolite of diethylstilbestrol) and the anise and fennel-derived compounds anol, dianol, anethole, dianethole, and photoanethole (from which the stilbestrol estrogens were actually originally derived). The triphenylethylene group of estrogenic drugs that includes triphenylethylene itself, estrobin, chlorotrianisene, broparestrol, ethamoxytriphetol, clomifene, tamoxifen, and more recently developed derivatives is also very closely related structurally to the stilbestrols. Resveratrol is a stilbenoid with estrogenic properties that is not technically a silbestrol derivative (it is 3,4',5-stilbenetriol).

The vast majority of total titles published are midlist titles, though they represent a much smaller fraction of total book sales, which are dominated by bestsellers and other very popular titles. Authors who consistently publish profitable but not bestselling books are referred to as Midlist authors.  United States  In the US, midlist and backlist publications were negatively affected by the US Supreme Court decision in the 1979 case Thor Power Tool Company v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue. This decision reinterpreted rules for inventory depreciation, changing how book publishers had to account for unsold inventory each year, and their ability to depreciate it. Because stocks of unsold books could no longer be written down without proof of value, it became more efficient tax-wise for companies to simply destroy inventory. The Thor decision caused publishers and booksellers to be much quicker to destroy stocks of poorly-selling books in order to realize a taxable loss. These books would previously have been kept in stock but written down to reflect the fact that not all of them were expected to sell.http://www.sfwa.org/2005/01/how-thor-power-hammered-publishing/ This has been somewhat mitigated by the development of online bookselling, which makes less popular titles more accessible to average readers.

Another young Highland dancer wearing the kilt-based dress. The aboyne dress is the name given to the prescribed attire for female dancers in the Scottish national dances, such as the Flora MacDonald's fancy, the Scottish lilt, and others. Male dancers wear the kilt for these dances, the kilt being a male garment. There are two versions of the aboyne dress in use. Some consider the aboyne as quite suited to the graceful movements of the National dances. The Aboyne Highland Games, established in 1867, have stipulated this style of attire for female dancers since 1952 for both national and highland dances.  Description  A typical Aboyne dress consists of a dark bodice or elaborate waistcoat, decorative blouse, full tartan skirt and some times a petticoat and apron. Some have a tartan sash (usually draped over the shoulder and coming down towards the hem of the skirt in the back) rather than an apron. While appearing to be simple and plain (and poorly assembled), a properly made, modern Aboyne dress might and can be quite expensive. In one version, a tartan pattern skirt is worn with an over-the- shoulder plaid, a white blouse and petticoat, and a velvet bodice. The alternative is a white dress over a petticoat, together with a tartan pattern sash.  History  The name derives from the Aboyne Highland Games in Scotland where, in the early 1950s the dance committee under games patron Lieutenant Colonel John Wilmot Nicol DSO of Ballogie, dissatisfied with the state of affairs of female Highland dance attire, prescribed new rules governing acceptable and better-looking attire for the female dancers. The problem, as they saw it, was that many felt that the female and male dancers should not be wearing the same outfits and that a separate style for women should be developed.1953 'The Great Highland Dress Controversy is Shall The Girls Wear', Queensland Times (Ipswich, Qld. : 1909 - 1954), 15 July, p. 3. (Daily), viewed 29 Jul 2018, http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article118418332 About 1949, the committee banned female dancers from wearing the kilt, sporran or medals. By 1952, they introduced an alternative attire of white blouse, tartan skirt and long black stockings, then for the September 1954 games, a new attire was introduced for all female dancers (previously it did not apply to girls between six and eleven). Approved by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, it was a skirt of light-weight tartan worn over a white petticoat, with a plaid of the same tartan material and a tight fitting sleeveless velvet corsage (the upper part of a woman's dress) over a white blouse. It was designed from the traditional Scottish woman's dress that was banned after the introduction of the Act of Proscription 1746 (England). The men would continue to dance in traditionally male kilt and jacket, wearing bonnets and sporrans. The original decision of the Aboyne committee applied to both the Highland dances and the National dances. The Royal Scottish Official Board of Highland Dancing a few years later modified the dress code so the aboyne dress would be used by women for just the national dances, and a kilt-based outfit (without bonnet or sporran) for the Highland dances. To this day, however, at the Aboyne Highland Games the wearing of the aboyne by women is strongly 'preferred', except for the Sailor's hornpipe and Irish jig.

A small but dedicated community of dice shooters claim proof of dice influencing in casino conditions. The concept of such precision shooting claims to elevate craps from a random game of chance to a sport, like bowling, darts, or pool. Many within the advantage gambling community still doubt if dice control can overcome the house advantage on craps. Controlled shooting The concept of \\"controlled shooting\\" goes beyond simply \\"setting the dice\\" prior to shooting. It purports to involve limiting the rotational characteristics of the dice. The theory is that if the dice are properly gripped and tossed at the correct angle they will land just before the back wall of the craps table, then gently touch the wall, greatly increasing the probability of their remaining on the same axis. If executed properly and consistently this technique would be able to change the game's long-term odds from the house's favor to the player's favor. Notable proponents of dice control Chris Pawlicki (author of Get The Edge At Craps: How to Control the Dice) explains the math and science behind dice control. Stanford Wong, well- known advantage player and gaming author, also discusses dice control in his book Wong on Dice. Pawlicki and Jerry L. Patterson co-developed PARR (Patterson Rhythm Roll) in 1997, which claims to be the first course on how to set and control dice. Debate over dice control Jim Klimesh, director of casino operations for Indiana's Empress Casino Hammond believes it is sometimes possible to control the dice with certain throws that do not hit the back wall of the craps table. One example is the \\"army blanket roll\\", named after the playing surface of the dice games of American servicemen during World War II. In the army blanket roll, a player sets the dice on an axis and gently rolls or slides them down the table. If the shooter is successful, the dice will not leave the axis they are rolled on and will come to rest before hitting the back wall. A successful shooter would affect the odds significantly. But most casinos require that the dice touch the wall in order for a throw to be valid. The chances of altering the odds when the dice bounce off a surface of rubber pyramids are much slimmer, no matter what axis the dice were on before they hit. Dice control proponents advocate a throw that gently bounces off of the back wall and comes to rest after barely touching it. Experiments have been conducted on the subject of dice control, with inconclusive results.

If the attack had been successful, thousands likely would have died.History Commons. Context of 'June 24, 1993: New York ‚ÄòLandmarks‚Äô Bombing Plot Is Foiled'. Accessed December 4, 2008. After the World Trade Center bombing, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had a confidential informant, Emad Salem, infiltrate the group of plotters. FBI officers arrested the main suspects in June 1993 before the plot could be carried out. In 1995, ten defendants were convicted of 48 charges related to the plot. Attackers The plot was espoused by a blind sheikh, Omar Abdel-Rahman, who was a radical Muslim cleric in New York City, to be carried out by some of his followers. Rahman was the spiritual leader of the al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, a radical Egyptian Islamic group that had links to al-Qaeda.Stratfor. From the New York Landmarks Plot to the Mumbai Attack. Accessed December 4, 2008. From the New York Landmarks Plot to the Mumbai Attack is republished with permission of Stratfor.\\" One of Rahman's followers, El Sayyid Nosair, had assassinated Meir Kahane in 1990 and was linked to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Targets The six targets to be attacked were the UN headquarters, the Lincoln Tunnel, the Holland Tunnel, the George Washington Bridge, the St. Regis and the UN Plaza Hotels, and the FBI's main New York office at the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building. There was also some talk of bombing Jewish targets in the city They also wanted to assassinate US Senator Al D'Amato and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Nosair also wanted to assassinate New York State Assemblyman Dov Hikind, a Jewish politician, and Alvin Schlesinger, a judge who had tried him in a previous case. The attack on the hotels would be detrimental because they are known to host prestigious guests such as the US ambassador to the United Nations and the US secretary of state, who stayed at the Waldorf during UN sessions. The hotels are also known to host several prominent business leaders. Attacking the locations would thus create chaos in the financial and diplomatic aspects of New York. The planned attacks on the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels and the George Washington Bridge would create chaos in transportation between New Jersey and Manhattan, as these were the only three direct vehicular crossings between the two locations. If the attacks were successful, police, civilians, and other respondents would have major issues entering and leaving the city. Co-conspirators indicated that they intended to drive bomb-laden cars into the tunnels, stall the cars in the middle, and detonate them three minutes after leaving the cars. The attackers also discussed attacks on the Diamond District in Manhattan, an area populated by a large population of Jewish businessmen. It was stated that attacking the neighborhood would be similar to \\"hitting Israel itself.\\" Simultaneous attacks in the same city were carried out as well during the 2008 Mumbai attacks. The New York group had supposedly wanted to plant a total of 12 bombs around the city targeting Jews and then detonate them at the same time.  Plan  The terrorists suspected President Mubarak to be present in the hotels and intended to infiltrate the hotels by using disguises as employees to get close to him. The other attacks in the city were used as distractions and to inflict chaos throughout the city. Bombs would be used on the bridges while the other terrorists would raid the hotels with guns. Even if it was not there, the attacks throughout the city would have caused a large number of deaths.  FBI surveillance  The FBI had been closely monitoring the plan throughout 1992 and 1993 but intensified its investigation after the World Trade Center bombing in February 1993, which killed six people. Emad Salem was used as an intelligence asset during the entire investigation (codenamed TERRSTOP) into the plot and for one year earlier. He had experienced a man being tortured when he was young and so Salem wanted revenge on radical Islam. FBI agents first used him to find the illegal selling of weapons and green cards from Russians and then Salem agreed to help the FBI during the plot. He was recruited to get information of the terrorists the details of the plan. Salem agreed to spy for the FBI if his identity was never revealed. The FBI insisted that he should wear a recording device so that he could testify in later trials, but he did not agree to that. The FBI then used him only as an \\"intelligence asset.\\" Around May 7, 1993, Salem started meeting regularly with the defendants. The FBI had also been monitoring the terrorists through video surveillance hidden in the terrorists' safe house, where bombs were being developed. Combined, the video surveillance and the use of an inside man greatly contributed into foiling the plot. In the final weeks of the investigation, the FBI monitored the plot almost constantly. At one point, when Senator D'Amato and Assemblyman Hikind received bodyguards, agents mistakenly feared that their investigation had been exposed. Salem infiltrated the group and gathered information that led to the arrest of the plotters. The FBI took two years to investigate the plot, which showed that a slow approach to terrorist investigations was beneficial. James Kallstrom, an ex-FBI officer, said, \\"You obviously want to play things out so you can fully identify the breadth and scope of the conspiracy. Obviously, the most efficient and effective way to do that is to bring it down to the last stage.\\" That was the precedent for many later terrorist cases. The general public later criticized that strategy, but the FBI still leans toward slow approaches to foil terrorist plots. Prosecution and aftermath Eight conspirators were arrested in a raid on June 24, 1993, after Salem had observed the group for five months. The conspirators were mixing chemicals for the bombs when they were arrested. It was revealed that the conspirators had also conducted test bombings before the World Trade Center bombing. They had also made preparations to escape quickly, which led the FBI to conclude that the suspects needed to be arrested quickly. A ninth suspect was arrested on June 30. The government announced the indictment of a tenth suspect on July 8. After the arrests were made, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey increased security on its six river crossings between New York and New Jersey. The three crossings in the bombing plot had been under the Port Authority's purview. William Kunstler agreed to represent three of the suspects, including Rahman and Nosair. However, Federal Judge Michael Mukasey later ruled that Rahman and the two other suspects would have to be represented separately and that Kunstler and Ronald L. Kuby would have to choose which defendants to represent. Rahman later offered to represent himself after the two lawyers could not agree on who would represent him. A bail hearing for one of the suspects, Clement Rodney Hampton-El, was held at the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on July 8. The court found that Salem's tapes supported only some of the charges against Hampton-El. The federal government wanted to try the suspects in New York because of the severity of the charges. Complicating matters, some of the suspects were also being arraigned on drug charges. A week and a half later, the US government announced that evidence was found that Sudan had been giving help to Rahman and the other plotters. Sudanese diplomats had assisted the planned attack on the United Nations headquarters.Still Willfully Blind After All These Years Consequently, the US government placed Sudan on a watch list of terrorist countries. On August 25, 1993, Attorney General Janet Reno announced that she would prosecute the bombing case because of more evidence. That was a reversal from her position two months earlier, when she had said that there was insufficient evidence for prosecution. The same day, Rahman was formally indicted in connection with three crimes: the landmark bombing plot, the World Trade Center bombing, and the 1990 assassination of Meir Kahane. The case against the defendants was prosecuted by lead prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy. One of the defendants, Siddig Ibrahim Siddig Ali, allowed prosecutors to view his notes. Salem ultimately testified against Rahman and other terrorists despite earlier refusing to do so. Salem had recorded tapes in which the defendants sought to prevent Rahman from being directly involved in the terror plot so that he would not be implicated. The defense lawyers unsuccessfully attempted to have all 13 defendants tried separately. New defense counsel were hired, and in September 1994, Judge Mukasey postponed the trial's opening date to December so that defense counsel could come up with new arguments. In November 1994, Mukasey rescheduled the date to January 1995 because Rahman had contracted pneumonia. In February 1995, Rahman pleaded guilty to the terror plot and also named some of the co-defendants as complicit in the plot. Once the trial started, Salem testified about the details of the bomb plot. Defense lawyers cross-examining Salem argued that he was not credible because he had lied several times in the past, including when he was gaining his US citizenship. However, Salem testified that the defendants had confided the details of the plot to him. In May 1995, one of the defendants, Abdo Mohammed Haggag, agreed to testify against the other 11 defendants in exchange for all his charges being dropped. Convictions On October 1, 1995, Rahman and nine others were convicted by a New York jury on 48 of 50 charges, including seditious conspiracy, solicitation to murder Mubarak, conspiracy to murder Mubarak, solicitation to attack a US military installation, and conspiracy to conduct bombings. In January 1996, Mukasey sentenced Rahman and nine other defendants to terms that ranged from 25 years to life in prison.Gladwell, Malcolm. N.Y. Bomb Plotters Sentenced to Long Terms.

It is free and published daily during the Syracuse University academic year. It was one of the first college papers to become fully independent from its parent college. Its alumni work at nearly every major newspaper in the nation ‚Äî The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Dallas Morning News, The Boston Globe ‚Äî in a variety of reporting, editing, design and photography roles. Publisher reported circulation for 2018 was 6,000 copies, with a weekly online circulation of about 45,000. The paper's print edition is published Monday, Wednesday and Thursday during the academic year, but content is published online daily during the academic year. The Tuesday print edition was dropped starting in fall 2018 to focus on digital content. Independence A major turning point in D.O. history occurred in 1971. Until that time, the newspaper was considered part of SU, meaning that the administration could possibly influence the content of the paper based on financial holds. In 1971, the university refused to back The D.O. in a libel suit and the editorial staff decided to sever the ties that existed with the administration. The paper became a student organization that received funding for production costs from the Student Government Association (now known as the Student Association). The D.O. continued to operate this way, receiving funds from the annual student activity fee, until 1991. A referendum vote determined whether the student body would continue to contribute a portion of its fee. In 1991, however, Editor in Chief Jodi Lamagna and her staff decided to refuse any further funding from SGA. In the process, The D.O. became one of the few completely independent student newspapers in the country. Since then, The D.O. has operated with complete financial independence from the university, raising funds necessary for publishing a daily paper through advertising revenue and fundraising. Though it still maintains a business relationship with the university, in regards to its status as a student group and its housing agreement, its relationship with administrators has no bearing on its editorial content. CIA lawsuit In the early 1980s, The Daily Orange was a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the CIA. Own work and awards The D.O. was the first student newspaper to have comics. The paper has produced many famous cartoonists, such as Vaughn Bode, Robb Armstrong (creator of Jump Start), Brad Anderson (creator of Marmaduke), Steve Ellis and Nicholas Gurewitch (creator of the Perry Bible Fellowship). The paper has in the past decade won numerous awards, including more than a dozen \\"story of the year\\" awards in several categories from the Associated Collegiate Press and top-story honors from the William Randolph Hearst Foundation. It is also the best-designed student newspaper in the country, as voted at the University of Missouri Student Society for News Design awards in 2005.

History The original Middle English name was Lega, and the village became Abbots Leigh in the mid-12th century when Robert Fitzharding (1st Earl of Berkeley) purchased the manor, having been rewarded as Lord of the Manor of Portbury by the king. He also purchased Bedminster, Hareclive and Billeswick manors. He went on to found the Abbey of St Augustine at what was Billeswick, and bequeathed the income from the parish to support the abbey. Because of this connection to the abbey, when the Diocese of Bristol was carved out of the Bath and Wells, Gloucester and Worcester diocesan territories (Patent Roll, Henry VIII, Art. 9, June 1542) the new diocese's boundary was drawn to include the parish, including the Saxon enclosure at Hamgreen which had been part of Portbury manor lands until then. All the surrounding parishes in Somerset are in Bath and Wells diocese. The parish map shows this meandering historic boundary which puts St Katherine's School and Chapel Pill Farm both within the parish. The parish of Abbots Leigh was part of the Portbury Hundred. The manor house here, also named Abbot's Leigh or Leigh Court, was a resting place of Charles II during his escape to France in 1651. He arrived on the evening of 12 September, and stayed at the home of Mr and Mrs George Norton, who were friends of the King's travelling companion, Jane Lane.

The Boscobel Tracts: Relating to the Escape of Charles the Second After the Battle of Worcester and his subsequent adventures, William Blackwood and Sons. p.166 The King's escape route is commemorated in the Monarch's Way long distance footpath which passes through the village. Hymn tune In 1942, during World War II, Rev. Cyril Vincent Taylor (1907‚Äì1991), then a producer of Religious Broadcasting at the BBC and stationed in the village, wrote a hymn tune which he named after it. The tune was originally written for the hymn \\"Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken\\". This hymn had usually been sung to the tune \\"Austrian Hymn\\", or Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser, but since the German national anthem was also sung to that tune, new music was needed in wartime Britain. Other hymn texts now commonly sung to the same tune include \\"Father Lord of All Creation\\", \\"God is Here\\", \\"Go My Children, With my Blessing\\" and \\"Lord, You Give the Great Commission\\". Governance The parish is in the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, under the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area, including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, Trading Standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service. North Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Long Ashton Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons as part of the North Somerset county constituency, which elects one MP, currently Liam Fox of the Conservative Party. Parish church The Church of England parish church of the Holy Trinity is a 15th-century Perpendicular Gothic building, restored and partially rebuilt in 1847‚Äì48 after a fire. The tower has six bells, three of which were cast in 1781 by William Bilbie of the Bilbie family. English Heritage has designated Holy Trinity a Grade II* listed building.

It is owned by the city of Los Angeles and is operated by ASM Global. Designed by architects Samuel Tilden Norton, Frederick Hastings Wallisand, and the Tacoma firm Heath, Gove, & Bell, the theatre stage is modeled after a Greek temple. History The idea for the Greek Theatre originated with wealthy landowner Griffith J. Griffith, who donated of land to the city of Los Angeles in 1896 to create Griffith Park. In his will he left money for the construction of a Greek theatre. A canyon site was chosen because of its good acoustics. The cornerstone was laid in 1928 and the building was dedicated on September 25, 1930. The first performance took place on June 26, 1931, attended by a capacity crowd of 4,000. During its first decades the theatre was rarely used, and it was used as a barracks during World War II. In the late 1940s a San Francisco producer brought touring shows to the venue. In the 1950s James Doolittle, a Los Angeles showman, leased the theatre and upgraded it with better seating and backstage equipment. Between 1975 and 2015, the theatre was managed by the Nederlander Organization, which further improved it and began a regular rotation of contemporary and classical productions and concerts. The theatre underwent an earthquake retrofit in 1995. In 2006 the facade was renovated in celebration of the venue's 75th anniversary. In 2015, Live Nation attempted to replace Nederlander in operating the theatre, leading to a joint venture with Live Nation and Nederlander, along with Goldenvoice, programming shows while SMG managed the venue. =Capacity= In 1983, the Greek Theatre's seating capacity was expanded to 6,187, but renovations brought the Greek Theatre's capacity down to 6,162 in 1995 and to 5,700 in 2004. In 2009 the Los Angeles Fire Marshal permitted the addition of two more rows in the pit, bringing full capacity at the Greek to 5,870 seated and 5,900 general admission.About the Greek Current usage The Greek Theatre is used for concerts, stage shows, and graduation ceremonies for Thomas Starr King Middle School and John Marshall High School, among others. The Greek Theatre won the Best Small Outdoor Venue award seven times in the past eight years, awarded by Pollstar Magazine, the industry's leading trade publication. The annual Bell-Jeff Invitational cross country running event starts adjacent to the theater.

The Yalta Conference was held there in 1945, when the palace housed the apartments of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and other members of the American delegation ‚Äì the Russian delegation was housed in the Yusupov Palace, and the British in the Vorontsov Palace some five miles distant. Today the palace houses a museum, but it is sometimes used for international summits. History Alexander III with his wife, 1895 Yalta Conference in February 1945 Formerly granted to Lambros Katsonis and later a possession of the Potocki family, the Livadia estate became a summer residence of the Russian imperial family in the 1860s, when architect Ippolito Monighetti built a large palace, a small palace, and a church there. The residence was frequented by Alexander II of Russia, while his successor Alexander III used to live (and died) in the smaller palace. His son Nicholas II decided to have the larger palace demolished and replaced with a larger structure. (The smaller palace was preserved, as the place of his father's death, but was later destroyed during World War II.) Around 1909, Nikolay Krasnov, Yalta's most fashionable architect, responsible for the grand ducal residences in Koreiz, was engaged to prepare plans for a new imperial palace. The Tsar's diary indicates that the design was much discussed in the Imperial Family; it was decided that all four fa√ßades of the palace should look different. After 17 months of construction, the new palace was inaugurated on 11 September 1911. In November Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna celebrated her 16th birthday at Livadia. After the February Revolution in 1917, Nicholas's mother, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, fled to Livadia with some other members of the Imperial family. They were eventually rescued by the British ship HMS Marlborough, sent by the Dowager Empress's nephew, King George V. During the Second World War, a ceremony marking the successful completion of the German Crimean Campaign (1941‚Äì1942), with the capture of Sevastopol by the German 11th Army under the command of General Erich von Manstein, and Manstein's promotion to the rank of Generalfeldmarschall (field marshal), was held in the garden of Livadia Palace on July 6, 1942. Participants included officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers who were awarded the German \\"Ritterkreuz\\" (Knight's Cross) and the \\"Deutsches Kreuz in Gold\\" (German Cross in Gold).Book: Author: Erich von Manstein. Titel: Verlorene Siege. 2000. 16 Auflage. Bonn. pp. 283‚Äì85 The palace was once used as a mental institution, and is now a historical museum. Most of the historical furnishings have been lost, but anything that has been recovered can be seen for a small fee. In August 2007 the palace was recognized as a landmark of modern history by the Seven Wonders of Ukraine project. Ukrainian pop singer Sofia Rotaru, who celebrated her 60th birthday at the palace in the company of the presidents of Russia, Ukraine, and Moldova ‚Äì the second such meeting since the Yalta Conference ‚Äì funded the restoration of Livadia Palace in 2008. Numerous academic conferences have been held at the palace.

The edifice features an arched portico of Carrara marble, a spacious Arabic patio, an Italian patio, a Florentine tower, ornate Bramantesque windows, a \\"balcony-belvedere\\", and multiple bays with jasper vases. A gallery connects the palace with a neo-Byzantine church of the Exaltation of the Cross, built by Monighetti in 1866. The palace contains 116 rooms, with interiors furnished in different styles. There are a Pompeian vestibule, an English billiard-room, a Neo-baroque dining room, and a Jacob- style study of maple wood, which elicited particular admiration of Nicholas II.

Stan believes he will be dared to kiss his girlfriend, Wendy, and Bebe, who has developed a crush on Kyle, plans to dare Kyle to kiss her. Cartman and Kenny learn of Stan and Kyle's plans and set about building their own clubhouse. Meanwhile, Stan's parents, Randy and Sharon, divorce due to constant bickering. Sharon soon introduces Stan to a new stepfather, Roy, who promptly moves into the family home. Cartman and Kenny complete their clubhouse first, and Kenny manages to get two 16-year-old girls to hang out with them. Cartman attempts to get the girls to play Truth or Dare, but this fails when one of the girls says that Truth or Dare is for children. Stan and Kyle eventually finish their clubhouse, but it is time for Stan to visit his father. Randy displays insincere interest and is more focused on enjoying single life. The girls visit Stan and Kyle's clubhouse to play Truth or Dare. Kyle and Bebe end up kissing, and before Stan has his turn, Roy interrupts, causing Wendy and Bebe to leave. Randy and Sharon get back together as Stan sets them up for a meeting in his clubhouse. The next day, Stan and Clyde play Truth or Dare with Wendy and Bebe. Stan asks for a dare, expecting to be asked to kiss Wendy, but is instead told to insert a stick in his urethra. Cultural references The Fat Abbott Show is a parody of Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids.

Biography He was born in 1628 near Muniesa (Teruel), in Aragon, a village around south of Zaragoza. His birthdate is unknown, but church records indicate he was baptised on 29 June 1628., p3. He moved to Valencia in his youth and undertook religious education with the Jesuits there at the College of St Paul.Robert P Baird, 'Introduction: Part One', in Miguel de Molinos, The Spiritual Guide, ed and trans by Robert P Baird, (New York: Paulist Press, 2010), pp1-20. He was ordained in 1652, and seemingly took his doctorate shortly thereafter, though it is unclear when or where (both the University of Valencia and the College of St Paul granted doctorates). On 4 June 1662, Molinos was admitted to the local chapter of the School of Christ, a religious brotherhood that would play an important role in his later life in Rome. He seems in these early years in Valencia to have held a number of secondary roles in the chapter‚Äôs leadership, at least one of which earned him a place on the chapter‚Äôs governing body. In July 1663, Molinos was chosen to travel to Rome to support the cause of the beatification of, and to report back to Valencia on, the Venerable Francisco Jer√≥nimo Sim√≥n (d. 1612), a secular cleric and beneficer of the parish of St Andrews in Valencia. He left Spain in late 1663; he would not return. There is almost no specific evidence of Molinos's activities in Rome in 1663‚Äì1675. It is known that Molinos was affiliated with the Roman chapter of the School of Christ (and, by 1671 at the latest, had become its leader). He also became well known as a spiritual director ‚Äì and it was in this role that he gained prominence as the leading advocate of the teaching and practice that would come to be known as Quietism. He was a regular correspondent with Princess Borghese, and counted as an admirer, Cardinal Benedetto Odescalchi, who in 1676 became Pope Innocent XI. He also paid frequent visits to the house of the exiled Christina, Queen of Sweden. He was also in these years working on the case of the Venerable Sim√≥n; by 1675, however, Molinos had to admit to his superiors in Valencia that the Congregation of Rites had refused to reconsider the case. Molinos‚Äôs royal commission and line of credit were revoked, and he was deprived of his official position in the Valencian delegation in Rome. In the same year, 1675, Molinos published his most famous work, the Spiritual Guide. The initial Spanish edition was quickly followed by an Italian translation entitled Guida spirituale, che disinvolge l'anima e la conduce per l'interior camino all' acquisito della perfetta contemplazione e del ricco tesoro della pace interiore (Spiritual Guide, which releases the soul and conducts it through the interior path to acquire the perfect contemplation and rich treasure of interior peace). The work was published with the usual approval from the ecclesiastical authorities ‚Äì the book received the imprimatur from the Dominican Raimondo Capizucchi, the pope‚Äôs own theologian, and the book opened with approbations by clergy of the Trinitarian, Franciscan, Carmelite, Capuchin and Jesuit orders. This was followed soon after in 1675 by a brief Trattato della cotidiana communione (Brief Treatise on Daily Communion), in which Molinos argued that those who wished to receive the Eucharist daily should not be denied by their confessor, so long as they were in a state of grace. Again, this work was approved by the censors of several orders. Molinos‚Äôs writings were clearly extremely popular. By 1685 seven editions had been printed in Italy and three in Spain. Translations of the book were made into Latin (1687), French (1688), Dutch (1688), English (1688), and German (1699) Quietist controversy Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome, the church in which Molinos was condemned in 1687. The first attack on Molinos‚Äôs Guide (though without specifically mentioning the Guide or Molinos) appeared in 1678, written by Gottardo Bell‚Äôhuomo. Molinos evidently felt that Bell‚Äôhuomo‚Äôs book could not be ignored, because shortly after he wrote (though never published) an apologia for his Guide entitled Defence of Contemplation, aiming to defend the Guide against charges of theological innovation. Specifically, he marshalled a long list of past writers and saints (including Francisco Suarez and Jean-Joseph Surin) in order to demonstrate that the Guide‚Äôs principal thesis ‚Äì that in order to pass to the state of contemplation one must leave behind meditative practices (even though, aware of the focus of the writings of Ignatius of Loyola on meditation, and the likelihood that Jesuit writers would react poorly to any perceived attack on Ignatius‚Äôs thought, he was quick to emphasise that these are certainly an important stage of the spiritual life) ‚Äì was a well-established part of church doctrine. Instead of publishing the book, Molinos took up his case with the superior general of the Jesuits, Giovanni Paolo Oliva. In a series of letters from February 1680 onwards, Molinos sought to assure Oliva that he had nothing but praise and respect for the Jesuits and their spirituality. A second moment of suspicion against Molinos arose in 1681. In March 1680, the Jesuit preacher Paolo Segneri wrote to Oliva, proposing a book defending meditation against the quietists‚Äô teaching. Oliva encouraged him and forwarded copies of the letters he had recently sent to Molinos. Later in 1680, a book was published in Florence, titled Concordia tra la fatica e la quiete nell' orazione (Agreement Between Effort and Quiet in Prayer), with Oliva‚Äôs name signed as imprimatur. The book attacked Molinos‚Äôs views, though without mentioning his name. During 1680‚Äì1681, a series of responses appeared from both the quietists and the Jesuits. The matter was referred to the Inquisition. In late 1681, it pronounced that the Guida spirituale was perfectly orthodox, censured Segneri, and placed his book on the Index (later in 1681, Bellhuomo‚Äôs work was also placed on the Index). The apparent Quietist victory, however, was short-lived. It is unclear why exactly this change happened, though one factor suggested has been disquiet caused in Rome the flourishing of Quietism outside Rome, and the reaction this was causing among its opponents. On 18 July 1685, Molinos was arrested by the pontifical guards and imprisoned in the Castel Sant‚ÄôAngelo. At first his friends were confident of an acquittal, and it seems that many in Rome remained sympathetic to his beliefs, but matters gradually turned against him. In spring 1687, Molinos was brought before a tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition and asked to explain his teaching, with 263 questionable propositions from his works at stake. Although initially defending them, by May 1687 his attitude had changed and he confessed his errors of conduct and teaching and waived his opportunity to present a defence. By July, the tribunal had isolated 68 objectionable propositions and had prepared articles of censure for each. On 23 August 1687, the entire case was read to the cardinal inquisitors, and on 2 September Molinos‚Äôs sentence (life in prison) was announced. On 3 September Molinos made a public profession of his errors in the Dominican Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. On 20 November Pope Innocent XI ratified his condemnation in the bull Coelestis Pastor, condemning 68 propositions from the Guida spirituale and other unpublished writings of its author. Molinos died nine years later in the prison of the Holy Office on 29 December 1696. Later reputation For the last three centuries, Molinos has chiefly been known as the main proponent of the most fundamental mystical heresy in Catholicism, a heresy which has come to be the touchstone for doctrinal judgements about correct and incorrect claims for mystical contact with God. Most assessments of him have been accordingly negative.Paul Dudon, Le Qui√©tiste Espagnol: Michel Molinos (1628‚Äì1696), (Paris: Gabriel Beauchesne, 1921) and Ronald Knox, Enthusiasm, (Oxford: OUP, 1950) are both highly negative. In the second half of the twentieth century, however, the assessment of Eulogio Pacho has been somewhat more circumspect, aware of the problematic bias in the various sources on Molinos. Bernard McGinn is not entirely forgiving of Molinos as a person, pointing out that it seems likely that he did, as he was accused, engage in sexual misconduct with some of his penitents during his work as a spiritual director. McGinn, however, is keen to point out how far the errors condemned in the bull Caelestis Pater do not in fact exist in the Spiritual Guide. Rather, he argues, the imprecision and lack of qualifications in Molinos‚Äôs work left him open to attack, and this was exacerbated by the fact that his book (with its various ambiguities) focused on certain issues (notably contemplation over meditation, interior quiet over vocal prayer, and passivity over pious action) which had become heated debates in the preceding century.Bernard McGinn, 'Introduction: Part Two', in Miguel de Molinos, The Spiritual Guide, ed and trans by Robert P Baird, (New York: Paulist Press, 2010), pp21-39. Even today we do not know if the rumors of sexual misconduct were even made at his trial as the text of the record and the trial have yet to be released by the Vatican. His last words to a priest before entering his cell of imprisonment were: \\"Good-by, Father. We shall meet again on the day of judgement. Then it will be seen if the truth was on your side or mine.\\" ) Henry Longfellow wrote a sonnet about him. William James, in The Varieties of Religious Experience said he was a 'spiritual genius'.

Alderson was fifth of six children. He went first to his local village school and then continued his schooling at Elwick Road senior boys' school, West Hartlepool, becoming Head Boy. During World War I he witnessed the bombardment of West Hartlepool by the German High Seas Fleet on 16 December 1914. After leaving school at 15 he first worked as an office boy and a draughtsman, and then undertook an engineering apprenticeship. He joined the Merchant Navy, becoming a first engineer. Following the birth of his daughter in 1935 he became an engineer for West Hartlepool council. He moved to Bridlington in 1938 as works supervisor for the Corporation. Local authorities were responsible for air raid precautions and trained their own workforces in rescue work. Alderson attended an anti-gas school at Easingwold, near York, and became an instructor in the subject. He worked as part-time Air Raid Warden, leading a detachment of rescue and demolition parties in Bridlington. The coastal town was soon attacked by Luftwaffe bombers, and residential areas were hit. On three occasions in August 1940, Alderson led rescue teams and entered dangerous buildings to rescue trapped civilians. He was the first person to receive the newly-instituted George Cross from the King, and in a radio broadcast at the time insisted that his award was for all the rescue parties in Bridlington. This interview can be heard in full on The Blitz, an audiobook CD of wartime recordings. In 1946, Alderson joined the East Riding of Yorkshire County Council workforce as an assistant highways surveyor. He then joined the new Civil Defence Corps, this time to protect the civilian population from nuclear warfare, rather than conventional bombs. On 28 October 1965 he died of lung cancer in Northfield Hospital at Driffield, Yorkshire. His George Cross is now on display at the Imperial War Museum alongside a medal from the RSPCA, awarded later in the war for rescuing two horses from a burning stable.

Limestone shelves along the lake shore contain the fossils of marine animals from the Devonian period. There is also a sandy beach for swimming. Located above the fossil beds is a red clay bluff which separates the campgrounds from the Lake. There is a bird banding station in the park for monitoring bird migration. The fossil beds also contain deposits of chert, a stone similar to flint which was worked to produce stone points. An archeological survey of the park revealed a late paleo-Indian camp. The camp showed evidence that the people were working the chert as well as fishing in the lake.

He was one of the most important figures of the Sevillian school of sculpture. His master was Pablo de Roxas. His first known work, dating to 1597, is the graceful St. Christopher in the church of El Salvador at Seville. His Boy Christ (dated 1607) is in the sacristy of the cathedral of Seville. His masterpiece, the great altar of St Jerome at San Isidoro del Campo, Santiponce, near Seville, was contracted in 1609 and completed in 1613. Monta√±√©s executed most of his sculpture in wood, which was gessoed, polychromed and gilded. Other works were the great altars at Santa Clara in Seville and at San Miguel in Jerez, the Immaculate Conception and the realistic figure of Christ Crucified in Cristo de la Clemenc√¨a, commissioned in 1603,Its iconography was laid out in minute detail in the contract, which survives. in the sacristy of Seville cathedral (illustration); the figure of St John the Baptist, and the St Bruno (1620); a tomb for Don P√©rez de Guzm√°n and his wife (1619); the highly realistic polychromed wood head and hands of St Ignatius of Loyola (1610) and of St Francis Xavier in the university church of Seville, where the costumed figures were used in celebrations. Monta√±√©s achieved great fame in his lifetime; he died in 1649, leaving a large family. His works are more realistic than imaginative, but this, allied with an impeccable taste, produced remarkable results. In 1635, in preparation for the bronze equestrian statue of King Philip IV by Pietro Tacca, Monta√±√©s went to Madrid and spent seven months there modelling a portrait of Philip IV. The work was sent to Tacca in Florence as primary reference for the King, and the statue was finished in 1640. During his stay in Madrid he had his portrait painted by Diego Vel√°zquez, whose tutor had worked for him. He had many imitators, including his son Alonzo Mart√≠nez, who died in 1668. His students included Juan de Mesa. References * This work in turn cites: **B. Haendeke, Studien zur Geschichte der spanischen Plastik (Strassburg, 1900) **F.

He was raised in Burlington and Hamilton, Ontario. World War II At the height of the Battle of Britain when the Hurricane was the principal British fighter aircraft, Lieutenant Patton was a chemical engineering officer in the 1st Battalion, Corps of Royal Canadian Engineers, recently arrived in Britain and based at Boxhill, near Dorking, Surrey. On 21 September, at 8.30 am when he was leading a team clearing debris at the bomb-damaged Vickers-Armstrongs aircraft factory at Brooklands near Weybridge, a lone Luftwaffe Junkers Ju88 attacked the Hawker Hurricane factory on the South-West side of Brooklands. Two of the three bombs dropped failed to explode and, despite having no previous experience of bomb disposal, Patton soon attended the scene. One unexploded bomb was buried under part of the factory floor but another had passed through the main building and ended up on an adjacent hardstanding. Patton decided that the unexploded bomb had to be removed as soon as possible before it damaged the vital factory, so with the help of four others (including his adjutant Captain Douglas W C Cunnington and Vickers Home Guard Section Leader A H Tilyard-Burrows ), he rolled it onto a sheet of corrugated iron and secured it to the back of a 15cwt truck. While Patton sat on the tailgate of the lorry to watch over the bomb, Cunnington towed the bomb out onto the aerodrome where it was then rolled very carefully into an existing bomb crater where it subsequently exploded harmlessly the next morning. Patton was awarded the George Cross for his bravery (Cunnington and Tilyard-Burrows were awarded the George Medal) and subsequently served in India and Burma fighting against the Japanese. Post-war After the war he received Canadian citizenship as a result of his participation with the Royal Canadian Engineers. He was also made an Honorary Member of the Royal Engineers Bomb Disposal Association. Recognition In February 1944, the City of Hamilton was given of land for park use by Thomas Hambly Ross, MP (Hamilton East), and his wife Olive. This park was originally named Ross Park but was renamed Patton Park in 1946, in honour of Captain John MacMillan Stevenson Patton. In 1960, the park was again renamed to honour Samuel Lawrence. From 1990 to 1994, Sam Lawrence Park saw a major upgrading that included repairing stone walls, installing new walkways, lighting, site furniture, and redevelopment of the major rock gardens. Sam Lawrence Park can be found on the western-end of Concession Street in Hamilton, Ontario. Prior to 1944, this property was the Webb Quarry.

He is credited as an innovator of vocalese, a musical style in which lyrics are set to an instrumental composition or solo. Jefferson himself claims that his main influence was Leo Watson. Perhaps Jefferson's best-known song is \\"Moody's Mood for Love\\", though it was first recorded by King Pleasure, who cited Jefferson as an influence. Jefferson's songs \\"Parker's Mood\\" and \\"Filthy McNasty\\" were also hits.[ Allmusic biography] Biography Jefferson was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\\"Jazz Singer Killed in Detroit Shooting\\", May 9, 1979. Toledo Blade. One of his most notable recordings, \\"So What\\", combined the lyrics of artist Christopher Acemandese Hall with the music of Miles Davis to highlight his skills, and enabled him to turn a phrase, into his style he calls jazz vocalese. Jefferson's last recorded performance was at the Joe Segal's Jazz Showcase in Chicago and was released on video by Rhapsody Films. He shared the stand with Richie Cole (alto sax), John Campbell (piano), Kelly Sill (bass) and Joel Spencer (drums). The performance was part of a tour that Jefferson and Cole led together. Their opening night in Detroit, Michigan, was at Baker's Keyboard Lounge, a jazz club built in the 1930s that has played host to famous musicians including musicians who spanned the genre with artists as diverse as Dexter Gordon and Sonny Stitt. A previously unreleased live recording from July 1976 was released in August 2009 as Eddie Jefferson At Ali's Alley, with the quintet of drummer Rashied Ali featured. Eddie Jefferson was shot and killed at Baker's Keyboard Lounge on May 8, 1979, aged 60. He had left the club with fellow bandleader Cole around 1:35 a.m. and was shot while walking out of the building. A late-model Lincoln Continental was spotted speeding away from the scene. The driver was later picked up by Detroit police and identified as a disgruntled dancer with whom Jefferson once worked and had fired from a gig. The suspect was charged with murder, but was later acquitted in a Detroit criminal trial. The Manhattan Transfer honored both Jefferson and Coleman Hawkins in their vocal version of \\"Body and Soul\\" on their album Extensions in 1979.

History  Cashwan was born to Jewish parents in Cherkasy, Ukraine. His parents left Russia and emigrated to New York City in 1906. Cashwan began his art studies after the family moved to Detroit in 1916. His first exposure to art came from his art teacher, Katherine Conover at Detroit's Central High School. Cashwan then took art course at the John Wicker School of Art in Detroit and later at Detroit City College. In 1918, Cashwan served in the US Army. He was discharged following the end of World War I and returned to New York City, where he continued with his art training at the Architectural League of New York. Cashwan then moved to Paris from 1923 to 1926 where he attended the √âcole des Beaux-Arts under the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle. He returned to Detroit in 1927 and became an art instructor at the University of Michigan. Cashwan also served as the head of the sculpture department of the Detroit Society of Arts and Crafts until 1942. Cashwan was also employed by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) from 1936 until 1942 as the supervisor of its sculpture and ceramics program. He was to credit the income from these teaching positions to allow art to his own tastes rather than that of the art market. During his time at the WPA, Cashwan created several sculptures for outside display at Michigan State University. At the Olin Health Center, he created bas-reliefs of the Greek gods Panacea and Hygeia. AT one of the University entrances, he created a sculpture of a man, a woman, a horse and several sheafs of wheat. These figures symbolized the university's beginnings as a school of agriculture. In January, 1942, Cashwan exhibited sculptural work at an opening of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Following the end of World War II, Cashwan was hired as a designer for General Motors, a position that he held until his retirement in 1965. He moved to North Carolina shortly thereafter, where he lived until his death in 1988. While Cashwan suggested that his work had been influenced by both Romanesque and Hindu sculpture, as his career progress his work developed along more and more abstract lines. By the late 1930s, his figural work had become very angular, stressing sharp lines and large volumes. His pieces created following World War II were even more abstract, his later ones having altogether abandoned figural reference. Like many of the sculptors of his day Cashwan was endowed with both the skills and the opportunity to work with architects and create architectural sculpture. Buildings adorned by his hand can be found in both Lansing, Michigan and Detroit.

It was fought in what was then the District of Saskatchewan of the Northwest Territories, at what is now known as Steele Narrows, in Saskatchewan's Makwa Lake Provincial Park. Led by Major Sam Steele, a force of North-West Mounted Police, Alberta Mounted Rifles and Steele's Scouts (a body of mounted militia raised by Steele himself) caught up with and dispersed a band of Plains Cree warriors and their white and M√©tis hostages. Cree scouts made a determined stand with what was left of their ammunition, but the body of the Cree column, realizing the hopelessness of their situation, released their prisoners and fled. The Cree casualties were four dead and dozens wounded. Wandering Spirit, the war chief leading the Cree military campaign, surrendered to authorities at Fort Pitt. Big Bear, the aging peacetime chief of this band of Cree, eluded capture until July 2. Maps *Military map of Loon Lake *Military map of Loon Lake Ford *Military map of Loon Lake Island and Muskeg Legacy The site of the battle was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1950. In the spring of 2008, Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed in Duck Lake, that \\"the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the prairie M√©tis and First Nations peoples' struggle with Government forces and how it has shaped Canada today.\\" The Battle of Loon Lake is commemorated today by interpretive signs placed by the Government of Saskatchewan and a plaque placed by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. The place is today known as 'Steele Narrows'. The Narrows between Makwa Lake and Sanderson Bay, in the Makwa Lake Provincial Park, was the site of the last engagement of the rebellion.

Gu√∞brandur Vigf√∫sson, known in English as Gudbrand Vigfusson, (13 March 1827 - 31 January 1889J√≥n √æorkelsson, \\"Nekrolog √∂ver Gu√∞brandur Vigf√∫sson\\" in Arkiv f√∂r nordisk filologi, Sj√§tte bandet (ny f√∂ljd: andra bandet), Lund, 1889, pp 156-163.) was one of the foremost Scandinavian scholars of the 19th century. Life He was born of an Icelandic family in Brei√∞afj√∂r√∞ur. He was brought up, until he went to a tutor's, by his kinswoman Krist√≠n Vigf√∫ssd√≥ttir, to whom, he records, he owed not only that he became a man of letters but almost everything. He was sent to the old school at Bessasta√∞ir and (when it moved there) at Reykjav√≠k. In 1849, already a fair scholar, he came to Copenhagen University in the Regense College, where as an Icelander he received four-years free boarding under the Gar√∞svist system. After his student course, he was appointed stipendiarius by the Arna-Magnaean trustees, and worked for fourteen years in the Arna-Magnaean Library until, as he said, he knew every scrap of old vellum and of Icelandic written paper in that whole collection. In 1866, he settled in Oxford, which he made his home for the rest of his life. He held the office of Reader in Scandinavian at Oxford University (a post created for him) from 1884 till his death. He was made a Jubilee Doctor of Uppsala in 1877, and received the Danish order of the Dannebrog in 1885. Gu√∞brandur died of cancer on 31 January 1889. He was buried in St. Sepulchre's Cemetery, Oxford, on 3 February, 1889. Work He was an excellent judge of literature, reading most European languages well and being acquainted with their classics. His memory was remarkable, and if the Eddic poems had ever been lost, he could have written them all down from memory. He spoke English well, with a strong Icelandic accent. He wrote a beautiful, distinctive and clear hand, in spite of (or because of) the thousands of lines of manuscript copying he had done in his early life. His T√≠mat√∂l (written between October 1854 and April 1855) laid the foundations for the chronology of Icelandic history. His editions of Icelandic classics (1858‚Äì1868), Biskupa s√∂gur, B√°r√∞ar Saga, Forns√∂gur (with Mobius), Eyrbyggia Saga and Flateyarb√≥k (with Carl Rikard Unger) opened a new era of Icelandic scholarship. They can be compared to the Rolls Series editions of chronicles by William Stubbs, for the interest and value of their prefaces and texts. He spent the seven years 1866‚Äì1873 on the Oxford Icelandic-English Dictionary, often denoted by the shorthand \\"Cleasby- Vigfusson\\", the best guide to classic Icelandic, and a monumental example of single-handed work. The end-product was more a product of Gu√∞brandur Vigf√∫sson's undertaking than Cleasby's, and is characterized as his most important legacy. His later series of editions (1874‚Äì1885) included Orkneyinga Saga and H√°conar Saga, the great and complex mass of Icelandic historical sagas known as Sturlunga, and the Corpus Poeticum Boreale, in which he edited the entire body of classic Scandinavian poetry. As an introduction to the Sturlunga, he wrote a complete, concise history of the classic Northern literature and its sources. In the introduction to the Corpus, he laid the foundations of a critical history of the Eddic poetry and Court poetry of the North in a series of well-supported theories. His little Icelandic Prose Reader (with F. York Powell) (1879) furnishes a path to a sound knowledge of Icelandic. The Grimm Centenary Papers (1886) give good examples of the range of his historic work, while his Appendix on Icelandic currency to Sir G. W. Dasent's Burnt Njal is a methodical investigation into an intricate subject. As a writer in his own tongue, he once gained a high position by his Relations of Travel in Norway and South Germany. In English, as his Visit to Grimm and his powerful letters to The Times show, he had attained no mean skill. His life is mainly a record of well-directed and efficient labor in Denmark and Oxford.

Signs and symptoms Clinical features may include constitutional symptoms like fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, and kidney failure. A majority of patients may have blood in the urine and protein in the urine. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis may occur. Because many different organ systems may be involved, a wide range of symptoms are possible in MPA. Purpura and livedo racemosa may be present. Cause While the mechanism of disease has yet to be fully elucidated, the leading hypothesis is that the process is begun with an autoimmune process of unknown cause that triggers production of p-ANCA. These antibodies will circulate at low levels until a pro-inflammatory trigger ‚Äî such as infection, malignancy, or drug therapy. The trigger upregulates production of p-ANCA. Then, the large number of antibodies make it more likely that they will bind a neutrophil. Once bound, the neutrophil degranulates. The degranulation releases toxins that cause endothelial injury. Most recently, two different groups of investigators have demonstrated that anti-MPO antibodies alone can cause necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis. Diagnosis Laboratory tests may reveal an increased sedimentation rate, elevated CRP, anemia and elevated creatinine due to kidney impairment. An important diagnostic test is the presence of perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) with myeloperoxidase specificity (a constituent of neutrophil granules), and protein and red blood cells in the urine. In patients with neuropathy, electromyography may reveal a sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy. =Differential diagnosis= The signs and symptoms of microscopic polyangiitis may resemble those of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (another form of small-vessel vasculitis) but typically lacks the significant upper respiratory tract involvement (e.g., sinusitis) frequently seen in people affected by GPA. Treatment The customary treatment involves long term dosage of prednisone, alternated or combined with cytotoxic drugs, such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine. Plasmapheresis may also be indicated in the acute setting to remove ANCA antibodies. Rituximab has been investigated, and in April 2011 approved by the FDA when used in combination with glucocorticoids in adult patients. _Sources_ : * * See also * ANCA-associated vasculitides *Polyarteritis nodosa * List of cutaneous conditions References External links  Category:Steroid- responsive inflammatory conditions Category:Systemic connective tissue disorders Category:Vascular-related cutaneous conditions ","title":"Microscopic polyangiitis"},{"id":"2295713","text":"Anthony or Antony Hamilton may refer to: *Anthony Hamilton (1646‚Äì1720), Irish classical author, of aristocratic Scottish ancestry, who lived in France where he was known as Antoine Hamilton *Anthony Hamilton (Archdeacon of Colchester) (1739‚Äì1812), English priest who served as both Archdeacon of London and Archdeacon of Colchester *Anthony Hamilton-Smith, 3rd Baron Colwyn (born 1942), English peer, legislator and dental surgeon *Anthony Hamilton (born 1943), American musician and poet, of The Watts Prophets *Antony Hamilton (1952‚Äì1995), Australian actor, model and dancer *Anthony Hamilton (born 1956), Grenada-born British racing-car manager, father and former manager of Lewis Hamilton *Anthony Hamilton (athlete) (born 1969), British Paralympic athlete *Anthony Hamilton (musician) (born 1971), American R&B;/soul singer-songwriter and record producer *Anthony Hamilton (snooker player) (born 1971), English snooker player *Anthony Hamilton (fighter) (born 1980), American mixed martial artist *Anthony Hamilton (soccer) (born 1985), American soccer player *Anthony Hamilton (archdeacon of Taunton) (1778‚Äì1851) See also * *Hamilton (name) ","title":"Anthony Hamilton"},{"id":"2295718","text":"The Ballymena Showgrounds is a football stadium in Ballymena, County Antrim, Northern Ireland. It is home to Ballymena United F.C. and Ballymena United Allstars F.C.. It is owned by Ballymena Borough Council. In addition to men's soccer a variety of other sports and events are held at the stadium and surrounding facilities, including women's association football, field hockey, and stock car racing. The stadium was redeveloped in 2001 at a cost of ¬£30m. This reconstruction included the building of a new stand and new dressing room facilities. In 2010 the Warden Street stand was redeveloped to all-seater standard with a new capacity of 2,200 seats. The stadium now holds 4,100 spectators, but is limited to 3,600 due to health and safety. Main Stadium Home to Ballymena United =New Stand= The New Stand replaced the old 'Clock Stand' which ran parallel to the side of the pitch and was knocked down in 2001, in preparation for the new construction. The stand incorporates approximately sixteen changing rooms, offices and bars - as well as press and corporate facilities. The first game it was open to the public was an Ulster Cup tie against Carrick Rangers in August 2002; however was officially unveiled a month later with the glamour friendly with Bolton Wanderers. Home supporters are situated in this stand, as they use the turnstiles at the social club to enter the ground. The stand cost ¬£3million pounds to build, and as yet has not been officially named despite prolonged debate by the council who have recently proposed selling the naming rights to local businesses, although the fans thoughts that the 'New Stand' should be renamed 'The Norman McBurney Stand' after the Ballymena born owner of haulage company McBurney Transport. =Warden Street Stand= It cost ¬£250,000 to construct and was used for the first time in a 2-0 defeat in a Tyler Cup game against Shamrock Rovers in July, 1980. The stand, which is now used to hold visiting supporters has a seating capacity of just over 1,200. The stand was used to house the home supporters until the opening of the new grandstand in 2002. In front of the stand is terracing which can hold around 2,000 standing spectators. The dug-outs also sit in front of this stand. United's PA Announcer - Davy \\"Kingo\\" King can be found in this stand, as when he's not covering games live for local radio station - SevenFM from the old press box, he's playing his unique collection of records over the tannoy. It has been revealed that there has been announcements that the stand is going to be completely refurbished to bring its seating capacity up to 2,200, the work shall commence on 14 January 2010 in which the terracing shall be removed and replaced by seating the roof shall also be replaced and the seats replaced. This work has now been completed and the new stand was first used in a 3-1 home victory for Ballymena United F.C over Portadown F.C on 16 October 2010. Security Tower With aid of grants from the Sports Council, Ballymena United have erected a brand new security control tower which will be used by the police and United stewards to monitor behaviour at the Showgrounds. This further adds to the reputation of the Ballymena Showgrounds as the best facility for football in Ulster. Pitch 2 (3G)Pitch Three Home to Northend United Youth FC.

Stock car racing Stock cars run at Ballymena on select Friday evenings from Good Friday until the end of September, with many Championship races taking place throughout the season; most recently the 'Raceway' (as it is known to fans) hosted the Stockrod Championship of the World. Racing at the track was originally promoted by hot rod driver Ernie Kilpatrick and Robert Mathers in 1977. At the time it was the third track in Northern Ireland, the other two being Aghadowey and Portadown. In 2007 the Raceway celebrated its 30th anniversary which featured a celebratory race meeting featuring many famous retired drivers, along with guest drivers from other forms of motorsport, most notably Kris Meeke who tried his hand at racing a National Hot Rod. In 2019 Ballymena Raceway said they would stop using the ballymena showgrounds for races.

Polychrome glazed capital, circa 1915. Randalls Lost NYC collection White glazed Sullivanesque, circa 1925. Randalls Lost NYC collection Glazed architectural terra-cotta (the hyphen usually only found in American usage) is a ceramic masonry building material used as a decorative skin. It has been popular in the United States from the late 19th century until the 1930s, and still one of the most common building materials found in U.S. urban environments. It is the glazed version of architectural terracotta; the material in both its glazed and unglazed versions is sturdy and relatively inexpensive, and can be molded into richly ornamented detail. Glazed terra-cotta played a significant role in architectural styles such as the Chicago School and Beaux-Arts architecture. History Gloucester Road station, Piccadilly line, with the sang de boeuf glazed tiles used on many London Underground station buildings. The material, also known in Great Britain as faience and sometimes referred to as \\"architectural ceramics\\", was closely associated with the work of Cass Gilbert, Louis Sullivan, and Daniel H. Burnham, among other architects. Buildings incorporating glazed terra-cotta include the Woolworth Building in New York City and the Wrigley Building in Chicago. Glazed architectural terra- cotta offered a modular, varied and relatively inexpensive approach to wall and floor construction. It was particularly adaptable to vigorous and rich ornamental detailing. It was created by Luca della Robbia (1400‚Äì1482), and was used in most of his works. Terra-cotta is an enriched molded clay brick or block. It was usually hollow cast in blocks which were open in the back, with internal stiffeners called webbing. Webbing substantially strengthened the hollow blocks with minimal weight increase. The blocks were finished with a glaze, with a clay wash or an aqueous solution of metal salts, before firing. Late 19th century advertising for the material promoted the durable, impervious and adaptable nature of glazed architectural terra-cotta. It could accommodate subtle nuances of modeling, texture and color. Compared to stone, it was easier to handle, quickly set and lower cost. The cost of producing the blocks, when compared to carving stone, was a considerable saving, especially when casts were used in a modular fashion‚Äîthat is, used repeatedly. It never needed paint, and periodic washings restored its appearance. Usage Variations in the color and pattern of the glaze could make it look like granite or limestone; this flexibility helped make it attractive for architects. Four major types of terra-cotta were widely used : # Brownstone was the earliest type. A dark red or brown block which was not necessarily glazed, it was used as imitation sandstone, brick or with real brownstone and associated with the architectural styles of Richard Upjohn, James Renwick, Jr., H. H. Richardson. # Fireproof was developed as a direct result of the growth of the high rise building in America. Cheap, light and fireproof, the rough-finished hollow blocks were ideally suited to span the I-beam members in floor, wall and ceiling construction. Certain varieties are still in production today. # Veneer was developed during the 1930s and is still used today. Unlike traditional architectural terra-cotta, ceramic veneer is not hollow cast. It is a veneer of glazed ceramic tile which is ribbed on the back like bathroom tile and usually attached to a grid of metal ties which have been anchored to the building. # Glazed architectural terra-cotta was the most complex building material developed. The hollow units were hand cast in molds or carved in clay and heavily glazed, then fired. This is the terra-cotta associated with the architecture of Cass Gilbert, Louis Sullivan and Daniel H.

In Sydney, it featured on notable buildings such as BMA House, designed by Joseph Charles Fowell. Australian-made tiles were available from Wunderlich Tiles, a company founded by London-born Frederick Wunderlich.

The game was released on November 2, 2004. It is based on the board game series Axis & Allies from Milton Bradley and also on TimeGate's Kohan series. Set in the years after Japan and the United States entered into the war, the game allows the player to act as a World War II commander to build military forces to fight against other generals, using military units and technologies from the war. The player is able to rewrite and recreate the history of World War II. The game is TimeGate's best-selling game release, upon the company's closure in 2013. The game was met with positive reception, although some reviewers claimed the game fell short in terms of AI mechanics and in an overemphasis on base management. Axis & Allies: Collector's Edition was released as a new name for the game on August 28, 2006 by Encore Software. Gameplay In Axis & Allies, the player assumes the role of a military general of one of the five superpowers of World War II: the United States, Great Britain, Germany, Soviet Union, and Japan. Each nation has access to its own unique military units, such as snipers for the Soviets, flamethrower tanks for the British, and King Tiger tanks for the Germans. Four generals exist for each nation, with each general having access to unique Special Operation abilities, such as summoning fake tanks, deploying a secret agent, or giving an area buff to friendly units. Particularly noteworthy are the most expensive Special Operations, which include large damaging area of effect abilities such as carpet bombing, kamikazes, V-weapons, and nuclear bombs. The player battles against other generals in one of three game modes: World War II, custom game, and campaign mode. Gameplay is played mainly in the real-time strategy genre, though turn-based strategy is used in WWII mode. The primary objective of gameplay is to destroy all opposing enemy military forces, though some campaigns and maps require other objectives to be completed, such as capturing certain cities, escorting a caravan, or defending a specific area. A \\"City Control\\" percentage option may be enabled, in which the winner of the battle goes to the first side/team to capture a set percentage of cities on the map. Like in other RTS games, the player must expend resources to construct buildings and recruit units to fight the enemy, while maintaining an economy, progressing through a build tree, and researching upgrades. In standard gameplay, the player deploys building trucks from a Corps HQ, the main military headquarters building. These building trucks can \\"unpack\\" into all other essential buildings, which aid in producing combat units, technologies, and the three major resources of the game: money, ammo, and oil. Money is obtained as a constant flow of revenue from specific buildings and is used to purchase combat units and technologies, whereas ammo and oil are static resources provided by buildings, and are used for combat unit upkeep. Combat units of their corresponding types are deployed from four classes of buildings: Infantry, Airborne, Mechanized, and Armor Division HQs. Axis & Allies also includes special gameplay features, such as regimental control, chained supply, and morale. Recon Infantry regiments fighting near a Corps HQ with an Infantry Division HQ on fire. \\"Regiments\\" are the base combat groups that the player can control. A regiment is composed of a certain squad of units, where a unit can be, for example, an Anti-Tank Infantry, a Halftrack, or a Light Tank. The player controls the entire regiment as a whole, but cannot select and control its individual units. Every unit within a regiment is different, for example, a tank destroyer will paralyze units while mortar units will splash bombard. A regiment can be toggled into three states of unit formation, which trade the regiment's movement speed for attack efficiency, meaning hit-and-run attacks are less damaging than slow advances. There is also a feature called \\"entrenchment\\" in which a regiment gains a large defensive bonus if idle for a certain period of time. Furthermore, regiments gain experience from battles and have four tiers of veterancy, which improve the attack and defense of the regiment's units with each level. The game includes three types of units: ground units, air units, and naval units. All regiments are made up of ground units; they are blocked by mountains and slowed by forests, sand, and cities, though infantry units gain a defensive bonus while in forests or cities. Secondly, air units can fly over mountains, but they move and attack automatically; they can be deployed but not controlled by the player. Thirdly, naval units travel in water, but can neither be healed nor recruited, and thus they only appear in campaigns. In addition, the game employs a feature called a zone of supply for replenishing regiments, defined by a surrounding green border. Regiments heal and replace missing troops within the zone of supply through \\"chaining\\" to Division HQs of their type. The player's main Corps HQ, as well as cities, are the primary sources for emanating the zone of supply. Other buildings can extend the zone of supply so that regiments far from a base of operations can replenish troops. In addition, most buildings are able to be packed and relocated to redraw supply lines, if needed. Battles are also fought around a special feature called morale, which represents a regiment's tendency to rout from battle. Each regiment features a morale bar, which decreases as the regiment is engaged in battle. If morale drops below a threshold, the regiment's banner will flash white and the regiment makes an uncontrolled retreat away from the enemy. If the morale bar reaches zero, the regiment becomes frozen in place until it either gains its morale back or is killed. This makes prolonging battles costly, but the player can avoid regiments from routing by manually retreating them before their morale drops too low. Enemy artillery fire and flame attacks diminish the morale bar more rapidly. Some Special Operation abilities are used to affect the morale of friendly and enemy units. =WWII mode= WWII mode. WWII mode is a game mode which allows the player to wage war across the globe in a traditional turn-based fashion. It resembles a turn- based computer variant of the Axis & Allies board games, but with the option to fight battles in RTS mode. The player fights WWII in how they see fit, effectively \\"changing the course of history.\\" At the start, the player chooses a nation and a general to play as, then the game displays a game board showing a panoramic map of the world with territory tiles. A number of territories, such as Australia or Germany, have defensive pieces already in place. The player and computer players take turns purchasing infantry, mechanized, armor, and air support pieces from their home country and move them across the map to engage enemy armies and territories. Each nation has reduced recruitment cost for a specific military piece; for example, Germany recruits cheaper armor pieces, Russia has cheaper infantry pieces, and Japan has cheaper air support pieces. Moreover, each nation can purchase technologies to increase the chance that its battles will be successful; these are the same researches encountered in RTS mode. Either the Allies or Axis wins when two capitals of the opposing side are conquered. Battles that occur are chosen by the player to be fought in either of two ways: as a \\"quick resolve\\" battle or as an \\"RTS battle\\". \\"Quick resolves\\" are computerized simulations of the battles and the outcome is immediate. Probability of victory is based on army sizes and technologies researched by the attacking and defending armies. In contrast, \\"RTS battles\\" are fought using the normal real-time strategy mode. These battles procedurally generate their maps from the board game state. The quantity of military pieces attacking and defending a territory determines each player's starting money and starting forces in the RTS battle. Furthermore, the particular types of pieces contesting a territory restricts the types of units (i.e. infantry, mechanized, armor, air) that each player is able to deploy. A special feature is that if pieces converge to attack from multiple territories, forces appear in the corresponding directions in the battle. In addition, these battles take place in the appropriate biomes of the contested territories (e.g. island, coastal region, desert, forestland). There are only two major resources in WWII mode: money and technologies. Money is used to purchase military pieces and technologies. It is obtained every turn as the sum of the income values of controlled territories. Technologies, on the other hand, are purchased to increase the probability of victory in \\"quick resolve\\" battles. Purchasing technologies also pre-researches them in RTS battles. The primary rules of the board game are as follows. If an attacking army defeats a defending army, the weakest piece of the defeated army is destroyed and the rest of the army retreats to a nearby allied territory. If the defending army is unable to retreat to nearby allied territory (i.e. completely surrounded), then the entire army is destroyed. However, if the defender is the victor, then the weakest piece of the attacker's army is destroyed and the rest of the attacking army retreats back to their original territory. If a piece moves into a neutral territory or an abandoned enemy territory, it will automatically capture that territory at the start of the next turn. In contrast to the Axis & Allies board games, each player can only attack one territory per turn. Also, naval and air units are not built on the board but appear only during an RTS battle resolution. Moreover, each movable game piece is only given a movement speed of one tile. =Custom battle= Custom battle is a game mode in which real-time strategy battles are played on either a randomly generated map or on a pre-built map. Both randomly-generated and pre- built maps allow up to 8 players, and are played with the computer or online with real players. For randomly-generated maps, the player is allowed to choose the map's biome (e.g. desert, jungle, grassland), what land features are present on the map (e.g. mountains, forests, sand), how much money and experience points each player starts out with, and many other options. Axis & Allies' built-in random map generator then procedurally generates the map according to the terrain options selected. When playing on a randomly generated map, each player always starts in random locations on the map with the iconic setup of a primary Corps HQ building, some bunker defenses, and a supply depot truck. Gameplay proceeds as usual until a victor is decided by the victory condition of either destroying all enemies or capturing a set percentage of cities, if that option is set. Map editor. The Axis & Allies Map Editor allows players to make their own custom battle maps to play in both singleplayer and multiplayer mode. Players are able to customize many map options, including player starting units, scenery objects, terrain layout, audio sources, and game triggers. Game triggers allow for custom creation of cutscenes, unit & VFX spawns, storylines, and military objectives. Multiplayer games are played in the format of a custom battle; the other two game modes, WWII mode and Campaign mode, are not available for online play. Online players play in solo or team battles on randomly generated maps, or on official or player-created maps. A maximum of 12 players is allowed to join a single game, but only a maximum of 8 players is allowed to actually play. Players who are not playing are allowed to spectate in-game. Players can save multiplayer films, host rooms and games, and make friends and add them to their buddy lists. Online service was supported by GameSpy Arcade, a free online player- matching service. At the beginning of December 2012, GameSpy discontinued online server service to users. However, user direct-connect LAN services can still function. Plot=Campaigns= Russian Heavy Tank regiments in the Battle of Kursk campaign mission, as part of the Belgorod-Kharkov Offensive Operation. In Campaign mode, the player is thrust into a series of World War II campaign battles for either the Axis Powers (Germany and Japan) or the Allied Nations (United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union) throughout the years of 1941‚Äì1945.The Allied campaign begins with the \\"Battle of El Alamein\\" (1942) and the Axis campaign begins with the mission \\"Airdrop on Crete\\" (1941). There are a total of 24 campaign missions: 12 for the Allied and 12 for the Axis. Playing as the Allies, the course of history goes the way it actually did with the Battle of Normandy sealing Germany's fate and the capture of Iwo Jima and Okinawa sealing Japan's. The campaigns interchange between the armies of Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States of America as time progresses. Playing as the Axis leads to an alternate history of WWII, based on what-if scenarios. The campaign begins with a tactical German victory in the Battle of Crete. Having driven out British forces in the Mediterranean, Rommel and his Afrika Korps win the Battle of El Alamein, pushing the British all the way back through the Suez Canal. With the fuel-rich Middle East in German hands, Germany wins the decisive Battle of Stalingrad and the following year, the endlessly supplied Panzer units crush the Russians at Kursk, effectively sealing the fate of the Eastern Front. Meanwhile, in the Pacific War, Japan manages an invasion of Australia, leaving the Americans without a staging area in the Pacific (it is also suggested that the attack on Pearl Harbor was more successful, with the fleet being sunk in deep waters rather than in the shallow waters of the base). The Battle of Normandy still happens; however, the landing beaches have unfavorable terrain and the Germans' counterattack is successful. The failed invasion at Normandy not only prevented the Allies from opening a new front in the war, it also oversaw Germany's plans to invade Great Britain. With Rundstedt invading from the south and Rommel invading from the west, Operation Sea Lion proved to be a success, forcing the British to surrender. While Germany deals with partisan resistance, Japan invades India to crush the last of the British forces under the command of Wingate. With Great Britain defeated, Germany is able to turn its attention back to Stalin and the Soviet Union. Japanese advance units under General Kuribayashi and German Panzer divisions under Field Marshal Manstein surround Moscow, but the battle for control of the city turns into a three way brawl with German and Japanese units each vying for control of the city. The battle ends in a German victory.The player must complete the primary objective of \\"Capture Moscow before Japan\\" to advance in the campaign. By now, the United States of America is the only Allied nation left to challenge the Axis. With the defeat of British and Australian forces, Japan quickly eliminates the last remaining ships of the American fleet and captures Midway, and later Hawaii. With American naval forces crippled beyond repair, the Allies lose their chances of defeating the Axis Powers and America settles into a new Cold War with Japan in the Pacific and Nazi Germany in Europe. Development Axis & Allies was developed by TimeGate Studios and built using the Kohan II game engine, which laid out much of the framework for the game. Axis & Allies was released about a month later than Kohan II. The people at TimeGate were \\"very excited to [work] on [the] project with one of the leading publishers in the industry [Atari]\\", as told by Adel Chaveleh, president of TimeGate Studios. He also said that \\"[they] have been fans and players of the Axis & Allies franchise for years, and [their] commitment to innovation combined with the popularity of the brand is a definite recipe for a killer title.\\" The design process of Axis & Allies largely entailed three things: research, visual design, and game triggers. One design task was choosing the missions for the Axis campaign. It was difficult to judge at what point the war should turn in favor of the Axis. It was decided that major changes had to start early in the war. If Rommel had not gotten sick or if Montgomery had never been placed in charge of the British forces in North Africa, the second Axis campaign mission, the Battle of El Alamein, might have been a disaster for the British. The Germans might have broken through and moved on to capture several of the major oil fields in the Middle East. If they had, then Operation Barbarossa might have been successful for Germany, since in the real course of history, German forces had to stop 30 miles from Moscow because some forces had to be diverted to fight for the Caucasus oil fields. Most of the designers at TimeGate working on the game were history buffs, and they watched World War II movies and documentaries at home for research. The Band of Brothers miniseries was popular with the team. Such research was used to size maps, create the appropriate number of cities, and to select which armies to be present. For example, the Normandy map was designed to be very large to accommodate all five beachheads: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. The map was designed to accommodate all four Allied divisions that landed and the two Axis corps defending the coast. For terrain design, the designer or artist working on the map would usually keep an atlas of the region by his desk for reference. The art team produced numerous terrain sets, such as the \\"Russian winter\\". The designers used game triggers to make special game events occur. For example, early development of the Battle of the Bulge mission focused on the defense of Bastogne by the 101st Airborne Division. The map design started out as a city with several airborne companies inside it. Using triggers, German troops were pulled to attack the city many times. If the player could hold out long enough, Patton's third army arrived to break the encirclement. The turn-based WWII mode in Axis & Allies was chiefly inspired by the Axis & Allies board game series. Although different in how it is played, the mode was said by lead designer Brian Wood to \\"capture the importance of the economic factors (which are often left out of WWII games), as well as to encompass the global aspect of the board game.\\" Reception Axis & Allies performed satisfactory in ratings. The game was rated with a 6.0 by GameSpot, with gaming critics on the site giving a rating of 6.8 and users rating the game with 7.5. IGN rated the game with a score of 8.4, stating that \\"Axis and Allies RTS stands on its own merits as a great strategy game.\\" GamePlanet rated the game 4 out of 5 stars, marking the game as \\"a marriage of the original board game and the recent award-winning RTS fantasy title Kohan II\\", saying that the game \\"has certainly taken on the best of both and delivered a great little game.\\" XGPGaming tooted an 8.7/10 rating, saying that \\"[they] did a great job on this game, in a genre that has been watered down by the numerous attempts by various companies [...] I recommend everyone who likes real-time strategy games to give this one a try.\\" eToyChest gave a rating of 80%, writing that the game was \\"worthy to carry the [Axis & Allies] name proudly, and is a tremendously entertaining game in its own right [...] Axis & Allies delivers in terms of pure excitement and plain and simple fun. The game packs in more than enough challenge to keep even the seasoned RTS veterans gritting their teeth, while the online component is sure to keep most any player giddy.\\" GameSpy gave the game a low 2 out of 5 stars, detailing the game as, \\"Timegate's Kohan goes to World War II and shoots itself in the foot.\\" Tom Chick from GameSpy claimed that although the game \\"does a good job of modeling supply lines\\", he blames the game's incompetence on the \\"interface [...] confusing and non-intuitive interplay among units [, and] too much base management.\\" The game has also been criticized for its weak AI mechanics. However, the game was stated by its developers to be able to \\"learn and adapt to player strategies as they play the game.\\" IGN remarks that, artistically, the visuals of Axis & Allies look good: theme music, sample. Musically, Butts says, \\"The music and weapon effects are passable but don't stand out too much. Their chief virtue is in not getting in the way of the gameplay.\\" Chris Stavros from GameWatcher thought the audio and video elements of the game were superb and portrayed the atmosphere of World War II very well: Larry Harris, the founder of the acclaimed Axis & Allies board game series, was proud to expand the Axis & Allies franchise into the realm of real-time strategy gaming: Axis & Allies is TimeGate's best-selling game release, upon the company's closure in 2013.

Robert Bowes, the English diplomat in Edinburgh, described a fight on Edinburgh's Royal Mile between Lennox and John Wemyss of Logie. Logie had upset or made Lennox jealous in an incident in the king's bed chamber. Bowes said the offence was Logie's \\"disobedience\\" to the Duke.

Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 49. On 6 May 1593 the Duke and 15 friends subscribed to a frivolous legal document swearing to abstain from wearing gold and silver trimmings on their clothes for a year, and defaulters were to pay for a banquet for all at John Killoch's house. This \\"passement bond\\" was in part inspired by cheap counterfeit gold and silver thread used in \\"passements great or small, plain or √† jour, bissets, lilykins, cordons, and fringes\\" which quickly discoloured. The signatories included; Lord Home, the Earl of Mar, Lord Spynie, the Master of Glamis, Sir Thomas Erskine, Walter Stewart of Blantyre, Sir George Home, David Seton of Parbroath, and Sir William Keith of Delny.Historical Manuscripts Commission, 4th Report: Mrs. Erskine Murray (London, 1874), p. 527, these documents are held by the National Library of Scotland.

Lennox was a conduit for patronage and court appointments, and those hoping to place their allies at court would solicit his favour. However, Lennox claimed that placing more Scottish people in the king's household had become difficult. He wrote to Sir William Livingstone of Kilsyth who had asked for a place for a Napier of Merchiston Castle; > \\"although the King has this long time promised Merchiston ever the next > vacant place, yet many has been placed over him and in this has found great > impediments; for believe that a stranger shall find great difficulty to > obtain any such place so long as there is any English man that does aim at > it; for it is thought by them all that there is already too many Scots here > in such places.\\"HMC Laing Maunscripts at the University of Edinburgh, vol. 1 > (London, 1914), p. 106-7, modernised here.

It was a nonsectarian advocacy group which sought to monitor mass media for content that it deemed is harmful to children and families. The group characterized itself as \\"an international resource center for cutting-edge research and information\\" and denied playing any role in media censorship.  MediaWise movement  The MediaWise movement is the publicity and community outreach arm of the NIMF. Through it the organization sponsors speaking engagements given by its staff throughout the country, although most events take place at educational and religious institutions in the state of Minnesota. David Walsh is notable as the spokesperson for the NIMF, having given numerous interviews to national news programs and newspapers in this capacity. = Video Game Report Cards = The primary publication of the MediaWise movement is an annual report on the marketing, distribution, and impact of video games to minors. This \\"Video Game Report Card\\" comprises results to national surveys, summaries of recently completed research projects, and a grade-based assessment of the Entertainment Software Association's efforts to regulate the sales of video games to minors. The 2005 MediaWise Video Game Report Card criticized the Entertainment Software Rating Board's system of rating video games for age-appropriate conduct in its annual series of report cards, noting the scarcity of \\"Adults-Only\\" rated games and citing the perceived inadequacy in retailer enforcement. Several days after the report was released, the United States National Parent Teacher Association issued a press release condemning it, stating that \\"[the report card] contained erroneous statements about National PTA's position on the Entertainment Software Rating Board's (ESRB) rating system. In fact, National PTA does not endorse NIMF's report. Further, it does not agree with the report's characterization of ESRB and its rating system.\\"  Controversies  In 2005 the NIMF made the controversial claim that the video game industry was promoting cannibalism after analyzing stills and video clips from a zombie- themed game titled Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse. Dr. Walsh was asked about this in a podcast interview with Dennis McCauley, owner of gamepolitics.com. During the interview Dr. Walsh did not acknowledge the NIMF's apparent error, instead claiming that video gamers tricked him into thinking there was cannibalism in the game. In late 2003 Walsh proposed the coining of a neologism to fill what he sees is a gap in English vocabulary: killographic, to be defined as the \\"graphic depiction of brutal violence.\\" This is intended as an analogy to \\"pornographic\\", which he defines as the \\"graphic depiction of sexual acts\\". This term has been the subject of considerable public debate. Doug Lowenstein, head of the Entertainment Software Association, described it as a \\"clever phrase\\", but noted that the average age of video gamers is 28, and that \\"as adults they should be allowed to pick their entertainment.\\" On December 6, 2005, The ESRB assigned a failing grade of \\"F\\" to NIMF for its seriously flawed Video Game Report Card released the previous week.ESRB gives NIMFa failing grade The ESRB cited inaccuracies, incomplete and misleading statements, omission of material facts, and flawed research as key factors in assigning the failing grade.

Recurring themes depict a hero (for example Hercules or FƒÉt-Frumos) retrieving the golden apples hidden or stolen by a monstrous antagonist. Alternatively, as part of the mysterious apple branch of Otherworld in Irish mythology.  Greek mythology  Three instances of golden apples were featured in Greek mythology: =Atalanta= Atalanta and Melanion, Guido Reni, c. 1622-25 The first case concerns a huntress named Atalanta who raced against a suitor named Melanion. Melanion used golden apples to distract Atalanta so that he could win the race. > Though abandoned by her father as an infant, Atalanta became a skilled > hunter and received acclaim for her role in the hunt for the Calydonian > boar. Her father claimed her as his daughter and wished to marry her off. > However, Atalanta was reluctant to marry due to a prophecy that marriage > would be her downfall. Because of her beauty, she gained a number of suitors > and finally agreed to marry, but under the condition that her suitor was > obligated to beat her in a footrace. Competitors who failed to beat her > would be put to death. As Atalanta could run extremely fast, all her suitors > died. > > Realizing that Atalanta could not be defeated in a fair race, Melanion > prayed to Aphrodite for help. The goddess gave him three golden apples and > told him to drop them one at a time to distract Atalanta. Sure enough, she > quit running long enough to retrieve each golden apple. It took all three > apples and all of his speed, but Melanion finally succeeded, winning the > race and Atalanta's hand. Eventually they had a son Parthenopaios, who was one of the Seven against Thebes. Their marriage ended in misfortune when they were transformed into lions (which the Greeks believed were unable to mate with their own species, only with leopards) for offending the gods. =Golden Apple of Trojan War Fable= El Juicio de Paris by Enrique Simonet, 1904. Paris is holding the golden apple on his right hand while surveying the goddesses in a calculative manner. Zeus held a banquet in celebration of the marriage of Peleus and Thetis. Eris, the goddess of discord, was not invited for her troublesome nature, and upon turning up uninvited, she threw a golden apple into the ceremony, with an inscription that read: \\"Œ§ŒóŒô ŒöŒëŒõŒõŒôŒ£Œ§ŒóŒô\\" (, Modern Greek: œÑŒ∑ Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒªŒØœÉœÑŒ∑ ti kallisti; \\"for/to the most beautiful\\" ‚Äì cf. Callisto). Three goddesses claimed the apple: Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. They brought the matter before Zeus. Not wanting to get involved, Zeus assigned the task to Paris of Troy. Paris had demonstrated his exemplary fairness previously when he awarded a prize unhesitatingly to Ares after the god, in bull form, had bested his own prize bull. Zeus gave the apple to Hermes and told him to deliver it to Paris and tell him that the goddesses would accept his decision without argument. As each goddess wanted to receive the apple, they each stripped off their own clothing and appeared naked before Paris. Each of the goddesses also offered Paris a gift as a bribe in return for the apple; Hera offered to make him the king of Europe and Asia Minor, Athena offered him wisdom and skill in battle, and Aphrodite offered to give to him the love of the world's most beautiful woman, Helen of Sparta, who was already married to King Menelaus. Paris chose Aphrodite, a decision that caused the Trojan war, and ultimately the destruction of both Paris and his city, Troy. = Hera = Hera‚Äôs sacred golden apple tree is an apple tree that grows apples made entirely of gold. Zeus gave it to her as a gift. The dragon Ladon was sent to guard it from anyone who might try to steal the apples. Irish mythology The role of the Golden Apple is far more minor and less specific in Irish lore, mostly because it is an element of the Silver Branch, or Silver Bough, symbol that is connected to the Celtic Otherworld. =Apple branch= The silver branch with golden apples is owned by the Irish sea deity and Otherworld guardian Manann√°n mac Lir in the tale Echtra Cormaic. But these \\"apples\\" are actually \\"balls of red gold\\" hanging on a musical branch according to variant texts, and hardly fruits at all. The Dictionary of the Irish Language concurs, by defining the \\"apples\\" in this instance as \\"musical balls\\", not \\"fruits\\". There has been offered for comparison \\"silver branch of the sacred apple-tree bearing blossoms\\" encountered by Bran mac Febail in the narrative The Voyage of Bran, though golden apple fruits are not evident in this telling. This branch came from \\"Emain\\", construed to mean Emain Ablach associated with Manann√°n mac Lir by later commentators, though not recognized as anything other than Emain Macha of the Ulstermen in Eleanor Hull's monograph on the silver branch. =Oidheadh Chloinne Tuireann= In the Oidheadh Chloinne Tuireann version of the quest of Tuirenn's sons (Brian, Iuchar and Iucharba), the √©ric items demanded by Lugh Lamhfada included the Golden Apples of Hesperides. It is said to taste of honey, have curative powers, and not diminish though they are eaten. They could also be cast and perform tasks at will, and return to their owners. Music In Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, the golden apples have their own leitmotif. It is first sung by Fafner, when he explains to his brother Fasolt why they must take Freia away from the gods. In Stravinsky's ballet The Firebird (1910) which is based upon an amalgam of Russian folk-legends, the hero Prince Ivan enters a garden where he witnesses 13 young Princesses' playing with Golden Apples which grow there. (Tableaux VII Scherzo. Jeux des princesses avec les pommes d'or / The Princesses' Game with the Golden Apples). Fairy tales Ivan Tsarevich catches the Firebird who tries to steal golden apples in Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf Many European fairy tales begin when golden apples are stolen from a king, usually by a bird: *\\"Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf\\" (Russian) *\\"The Golden Bird\\" (German) *\\"The Golden Mermaid\\" (German) *\\"The Nine Peahens and the Golden Apples\\" (Serbian/Bulgarian) *\\"Pr√¢slea the Brave and the Golden Apples\\" (Romanian, where the thief is not a bird but a zmeu) *\\"The Three Brothers and the Golden Apple\\" (Bulgarian, where the thief is not a bird but a zmey) *\\"The White Snake\\" (German) Modern literature The William Butler Yeats poem \\"The Song of the Wandering Aengus\\", has the lines: :I will find out where she has gone :And kiss her lips and take her hands; :And walk among long dappled grass, :And pluck till time and times are done :The silver apples of the moon, :The golden apples of the sun. The Augusta, Lady Gregory play called The Golden Apple: A Play for Kiltartan Children is a fable in the invented Kiltartan dialect based on Irish mythology and folklore. The Golden Apples is the name of Southern writer, Eudora Welty's, fourth short story collection, published in 1949. The stories are interrelated and center around the citizens of the fictional town of Morgana, Mississippi. A golden apple plays a crucial role in the climax of David Mitchell's sixth novel The Bone Clocks, published by Random House in 2014. Discordianism The contemporary religion Discordianism draws upon the Golden Apple of the goddess Eris, also known as the \\"Apple of Discord\\", which Eris used to set off the conflict among the goddesses of Olympus that led to the Trojan War because she was not invited to a party (the so-called \\"Original Snub\\". Emblazoned upon the apple is the word \\"Kallisti\\" (\\"to the fairest\\"). The golden apple can be seen as a metaphor for a practical joke meant to cause cognitive dissonance in the target. Identity and use in other languages=Argan fruit= Michael H√ºbner has suggested that the fruit of the Argan tree, endemic to the Sous Valley in present-day Morocco, may be the golden apples of the Hesperides. Arguing that the location matches most closely the description given in classical texts of Atlantis and the garden of the Hesperides, he notes that the ripe fruits look like small golden apples and have an aroma like baked apples. He equates the fruit, the seeds of which produce Argan oil, with Plato's account of Atlantean fruits \\"which afford liquid and solid food and unguents\\", and proposes that the trees' almost reptilian-scale like bark and thorns may have inspired the mythical guardian dragon of the golden apples, Ladon. =Oranges= In many languages, the orange is referred to as a \\"golden apple\\". For example, the Greek œáœÅœÖœÉŒøŒºŒ∑ŒªŒπŒ¨, and Latin pomum aurantium both literally describe oranges as \\"golden apples\\". Other languages, like German, Finnish, Hebrew, and Russian, have more complex etymologies for the word \\"orange\\" that can be traced back to the same idea.Orange (Citrus sinensis [L.] Osbeck) Etymology, Gernot Katzer, Gernot Katzer Spice Pages, formerly University of Graz, February 3, 1999 In later years it was thought that the \\"golden apples\\" of myth might have actually been oranges, a fruit unknown to Europe and the Mediterranean before the Middle Ages. Under this assumption, the Greek botanical name chosen for all citrus species was Hesperidoeidƒì (·ºôœÉœÄŒµœÅŒπŒ¥ŒøŒµŒπŒ¥·øÜ, \\"hesperidoids\\"). It was also used by Carl Linnaeus, who gave the name Hesperides to an order containing the genus Citrus, in allusion to the golden apples of the Hesperides, and is preserved in the term Hesperidium for the fruits of citrus and some other plants. One reason why oranges might be considered to be \\"magical\\" in so many stories is because they bear flowers and fruit at the same time, unlike other fruit. =Quinces= Frequently , the term \\"golden apple\\" is used to refer to the quince, a fruit originating in the Middle East. =Tomatoes= The tomato, unknown to the ancient world of the Greeks, is known as the pomodoro in Italian, meaning \\"golden apple\\" (from pomo d'oro). Popular culture Golden apples are also items that are featured in video games such as Minecrafthttps://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Golden_Apple and Hello Neighbor. In the TV-series Animated Tales of the World, the episode \\"The Tree with the Golden Apples\\" revolves around the golden apple-tree on an island. An old man asks three brothers to sail to the island and whoever brings him a golden apple gets his daughter's hand in marriage.

Merobaudes was a Roman of Frankish origin who was raised in Spain, and likely was a descendant of the famous general of the same name who flourished during the fourth century.Bachrach, Bernard S. (University of Minnesota. Center for Early Modern History). City Walls: The Urban Enceinte in Global Perspective. Cambridge University Press (2000), p. 196 . He was the official laureate of Valentinian III and Aetius. Till the beginning of the 19th century he was known only from the notice of him in the Chronicle (year 443) of his contemporary Hydatius, where he is praised as a poet and orator, and mention is made of statues set up in his honour. In 1813 the base of a statue was discovered at Rome, with a long inscription belonging to the year 435 (CIL vi. 1724) upon Flavius Merobaudes, celebrating his merits as warrior and poet. Ten years later, B. G. Niebuhr discovered some Latin verses on a palimpsest in the monastery of St Gall, the authorship of which was traced to Merobaudes, owing to the great similarity of the language in the prose preface to that of the inscription. Formerly the only piece known under the name of Merobaudes was a short poem (30 hexameters) De Christo, attributed to him by one manuscript, to Claudian by another; but Ebert is inclined to dispute the claim of Merobaudes to be considered either the author of the De Christo or a Christian. The Panegyric and minor poems have been edited by Niebuhr (1824); by Immanuel Bekker in the Bonn Corpus scriptorum hist. (1836); the De Christo in T. Birt's Claudian (1892), where the authorship of Merobaudes is upheld; most recently F. B√ºcheler and A.

He previously served as the President of the American Association from 1991 to 1997 before the league disbanded in conjunction with the 1998 Major League Baseball expansion and Triple-A realignment. Early life and career Rickey is the grandson of Branch Rickey, who is best known for spearheading the movement within Major League Baseball to break the color barrier and for creating the framework for the modern minor league farm system. His father, Branch Rickey Jr., served as farm system director for both the Brooklyn Dodgers and Pittsburgh Pirates. Rickey competed in high school football, wrestling, and baseball. He attended Ohio Wesleyan University, where he majored in philosophy. He played soccer all four years and was co-captain in his senior year. He is a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. He graduated in 1967. He entered the Peace Corps in 1969 where he was assigned to Venezuela. He later worked as a college campus recruiter in the Southern United States and subsequently as regional recruitment director in 1971. Also in 1969, Rickey began to pursue freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling officiating. He was certified to judge and referee at the Olympic level, which he did at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. Professional baseball Rickey began his professional baseball career with the Pittsburgh Pirates organization in 1963 at age 17 when he became business manager of their Rookie League affiliate, the Kingsport Pirates of the Appalachian League, in Kingsport, Tennessee. He continued in this capacity during his summers through 1965. After college, he returned to professional baseball in 1972 as assistant director of the Kansas City Royals Baseball Academy in Sarasota, Florida.

When the Academy was closed by the Royals in 1974, Rickey rejoined the Pirates. Rickey continued in Major League Baseball for over twenty years with Pittsburgh and the Cincinnati Reds as a scout, assistant scouting director during the 1970s, and director of player development in the 1980s. In 1991, he succeeded Randy Mobley as president of the Triple-A American Association. He remained in this role until after the 1997 season when the league dissolved in conjunction with the 1998 Major League Baseball expansion and Triple-A realignment. Up to this point, three Triple-A leagues had operated in the United States: the American Association, International League, and Pacific Coast League. The directors of each league voted to disband the American Association and disperse its teams among the other two. Rickey was elected President of the Pacific Coast League in 1998, replaced the retiring Bill Cutler, who served as PCL president from 1979 to 1997. That same year, he was selected as the recipient of MiLB's Warren Giles Award, which honors outstanding service as a league president. He was again honored with the Giles Award in 2014.

Fuld is seen as the father of the Ouija board. Though Fuld never claimed to have invented the Ouija board, intense media coverage in the 1930s credited him with it. The misinformation was sustained by his own marketing, and his practice of stamping \\"Original Ouija Board\\" and \\"Inventor\\" on the back of his boards. By the end of his life he would have over 33 patents, trademarks, and copyrights credited to him. Background William Fuld was one of ten children. By the age of 26, he was working as a customs inspector in his hometown of Baltimore. Fuld also worked as a varnisher which led to his job as foreman at the Kennard Novelty Co. which was founded on October 30, 1890, the same year that Elijah Bond filed the first patent for a ‚Äútalking board‚Äù. This patent was assigned to William H. A. Maupin and Charles W. Kennard. For reasons unknown Kennard was removed from his company in 1891. By 1892 Fuld had taken over as supervisor and the company changed its name to The Ouija Novelty Company and moved into a new location. William Fuld filed for his first talking board patent in the same year. Under the direction of Fuld, the company increased production of Ouija boards to meet the growing demand and thwarted many of Kennard's attempts to manufacture other talking boards. In 1898, William and his brother Isaac went into business together under the name Isaac Fuld & Brother, leasing the \\"Ouija\\" name from The Ouija Novelty Company. In addition to talking boards, the brothers also manufactured pool tables and other billiards accessories. William was the first person to file a trademark for the term \\"Return Pool\\" table. By 1901, the brothers' partnership had ended in a bitter feud. William Fuld changed the name of his company to the William Fuld Manufacturing Company. Going against an injunction, Isaac continued to manufacture talking boards under the name \\"Oriole\\" that were exact replicas of the boards that he and his brother had made. William sued his brother in a case that remained open until 1919. William Fuld‚Äôs first talking board trademark, \\"Oracle\\", was filed in 1902. A crafty businessman, Fuld sued companies whose talking boards infringed on his trademarks or patents. It cannot be said whether or not he actually took himself seriously. However his numerous publicity stunts made the talking board a very successful product for Fuld, claiming in 1920 that the Ouija board had made him more than $1 million in profit. In order to combat the growing competition for other talking board manufacturers, Fuld knew that if he himself made a cheaper version of his own product he would get more business. In 1919, he introduced the \\"Mystifying Oracle\\", an exact replica of his Ouija board that sold for less money. He also launched a line of trademarked Ouija jewelry and Ouija Oil for rheumatism. Fuld also trademarked the names \\"Egyptian Luck board\\", \\"Hindu Luck board\\" and \\"WE-JA\\" as well as a trademark detailing the way the word \\"Ouija\\" would be displayed. Death William Fuld became a member of the Baltimore General Assembly in 1924. On February 24, 1927, Fuld climbed to the roof of his three- story factory to supervise the installation of a flagpole. When the rail against which he was leaning gave way, Fuld fell to the ground below. While being transported, a fractured rib pierced his heart and William Fuld died at the hospital. After his death, Fuld's children took over the company. Catherine and William A. Fuld ran the company until the youngest brother, Hubert, became president of William Fuld Inc. in 1942. Parker Brothers acquired the company and all of its assets in 1966.

The other was Koronis Rift. Both took advantage of the fractal technology developed for Rescue on Fractalus!, further enhancing it. In The Eidolon, Rescue's fractal mountains were turned upside down and became the inside of a cave. In addition to common cassette formats, the Atari and Commodore 64 versions were supplied on a flippy disk. One side had the Atari version, and the other had the Commodore 64 version. The Atari version required an XL/XE with 64kB or more memory. Plot The player discovers the Eidolon, a strange 19th-century vehicle, in an abandoned laboratory. As the player investigates this device, he is accidentally transported to another dimension and is trapped in a vast, maze-like cave. The creatures in this cave, sensing the energy emanating from the Eidolon, are woken from a long slumber, and the player soon finds that his only chance of survival lies in this mysterious vehicle and its powerful energy weapon.The Eidolon instruction manual. Lucasfilm Games. 1985. Gameplay Dragon guarding the end of a level The objective of The Eidolon is to successfully navigate through all of the game's levels, defeating the dragon guardian at the end of each level. The player navigates through each maze and collects energy orbs, which come in four different colors (red, yellow, green and blue). Along the way, various enemies wake up and attack the Eidolon, attempting to absorb its energy. Some enemies also fire orbs at the Eidolon, of which all but the red orbs can be absorbed by pressing the space bar at the right time to replenish the Eidolon's limited energy. Green orbs also have the power to transform other enemies into different kinds of enemies. Blue orbs can freeze enemies temporarily, giving the player a momentary advantage in a fight. Each level contains three diamonds, each guarded by an enemy of a specific color. After defeating each of these enemies and collecting the diamonds, the player can proceed to the dragon that guards the exit. There are eight levels in a game. The game is over when the player has successfully defeated the final dragon or runs out of time. Reception Zzap!64 gave the game a Gold Medal award, with an overall 97% score. The summary of the reviews from their three reviewers was \\"Lucasfilm's most original release yet, containing outstanding graphics and gameplay elements. The Eidolon is both immaculate in conception and execution. Not to be missed.\\"The Eidolon review in Zzap! issue 10, feb. 1986, pp. 28-30, ISSN 0954-867X here Gregg Williams of Computer Gaming World disliked The Eidolon. He stated that it was as difficult as Koronis Rift but with no save game feature. While praising the graphics and sound, Ardai criticized the game for \\"a lack of imagination. You get transported to god- knows-where ... and you basically shoot everything in sight. Is this a reasonable‚Äîlet alone responsible‚Äîway to explore a new world?\\" Charles Ardai later described the game in the magazine as \\"one of the worst\\" of 1986. The game was positively reviewed in a retrospective article in Retro Gamer magazine. It was praised for being \\"wonderfully atmospheric\\" due to the technical achievement of the fractally created environment. It was also considered to be the most ambitious and original release of the 3 Lucasfilm games which used fractal routines. Overall it was described as \\"a fascinating snapshot of gaming history that showed how innovative, immersive and tense a first-person style arcade-adventure could be on 8-bit platforms.https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/the-eidolon/ ReferencesExternal links *The Eidolon at Atari Mania LucasArts' 20th Anniversary retrospective from archive.org Category:1985 video games Category:Amstrad CPC games Category:Apple II games Category:Atari 8-bit family games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Epyx games Category:Fantasy video games Category:First-person shooters Category:LucasArts games Category:MSX games Category:Steampunk video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:ZX Spectrum games ","title":"The Eidolon"},{"id":"2295844","text":"Lone Pigeon is the working name of Gordon Anderson, a Scottish musician and co-founder of The Beta Band (which was formerly known as The Pigeons).Strong, Martin C.

He was educated at Uliwa Junior Primary School and at the mission school at Livingstonia. He subsequently worked as an Assistant Inspector of Police in Tanzania (then Tanganyika) and returned to Malawi in 1958. For a short time he, together with his brother Dunduzu Chisiza, attempted to go in business operating a butcher's shop in Blantyre market, but this venture soon failed. Nyasaland Independence Movement After the historic Nyasaland African Congress convention in January 1959, he was appointed as bodyguard to Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who later became the first premier of Malawi. He was arrested along with hundreds of others (including his brother) in the dawn raids of Operation Sunrise on 3 March 1959, when the colonial administration declared a state of emergency in Nyasaland. In 1960 he was named as Secretary General of the MCP under Banda's presidency. He was imprisoned in Khami Prison near Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia. He was released, some months after Banda, in September 1960. Political career After the death of his brother, Dunduzu Chisiza, in September 1962, Yatuta was elected to the Legislative Council for Karonga district and Banda appointed him Minister of Home Affairs. Nyasaland cabinet crisis Not long after Malawi had gained independence from Great Britain in July 1964, he was one of several cabinet ministers who, chafing under an increasingly autocratic leadership, were ousted by Banda in the Cabinet Crisis of 1964. He fled the country and, allegedly after undergoing military training in China, later conducted guerilla operations against the Banda regime from Tanzania. Here, Chisiza founded the Socialist League of Malawi (LESOMA), the most radical Malawian party in opposition to the Banda regime. Chisiza was succeeded by Attati Mpakati. Another exiled Malawian and important member of LESOMA was Mahoma M. Mwaungulu. Paul Theroux & the bread van affair In 1964 Paul Theroux, an outspoken, American, Peace Corps Volunteer in Nyasaland, was declared persona non grata by Dr. Hastings Banda for supporting Yatuta, who was accused of attempting to overthrow the government.http://www.peacecorpswriters.org/pages/2000/0003/prntvers003/pv003pchist.html Theroux delivered a letter from an exiled opposition leader, David Rubadiri, to Chisiza in Tanzania. He also carried a coded messages from Chisiza to a \\"Greek fellow\\" in Blantyre.http://www.peacecorpswriters.org/pages/2000/0003/prntvers003/pv003pchist.html According to an account by Theroux in Esquire Magazine, when Theroux delivered the message on October 16 to the Greek baker, who was en route to delivering his bread to Ntcheu, the baker \\"trembled and went pale\\".http://www.peacecorpswriters.org/pages/2000/0003/prntvers003/pv003pchist.html\\" : guessed the Greek baker had been caught, interrogated by the Malawi Criminal Investigation Department about bread van\\", and exposed Yatutas whearabouts and Theroux's involvement.http://www.peacecorpswriters.org/pages/2000/0003/prntvers003/pv003pchist.html Banda told the American ambassador that he had proof Theroux was plotting to kill him, and demanded the volunteer be sent home. He found out later that in his final day, instead of finding bread waiting in a van, Chisiza found Malawi soldiers, who ambushed and killed the revolutionary gunman from Tanzania where he was plotting against Banda.http://www.peacecorpswriters.org/pages/2000/0003/prntvers003/pv003pchist.html Paul Theroux was thrown out of the Peace Corp for his role in Malawi and is now a renowned novelist.http://www.peacecorpswriters.org/pages/2000/0003/prntvers003/pv003pchist.html His death Chisiza was killed by a single shot to the head in October 1967, apparently by Malawian security forces, although rumours have attributed a role to security forces of the Ian Smith regime in Southern Rhodesia. His body was put on display at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital near Blantyre as a warning to other potential insurgents. He was survived by two sons, Vyande Yatuta Chisiza and Kwacha Chisiza, and grandchildren: Millie, Bakalele, Mphikwa, Matebe, Mutale, Lusayo, Atupele, Mbakaya and Chikosa.

One of the aircraft he piloted in 1942 was Spitfire Mk. Vb, BM597, now flying with the Historic Aircraft Collection at Duxford. Wyro≈ºemski later flew the North American Mustang Mk.

Wyro≈ºemski served with 217 Eskadra Bombowa equipped with PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ twin-engine bombers as an observer before he fled the German advance. He made his way to Istanbul where he signed onto a freighter bound for England and reported to the Polish Embassy in London. Richard L. Holm, former CIA Directorate of Operations member, stated in an article about his African experiences that Wyro≈ºemski was \\"fiercely loyal to Poland, [and] he wanted to fight against the Germans. Wyro≈ºemski claimed he had been a pilot in the Polish Air Force, and he apparently had flown a small plane in his youth.

Last mission of WW II On 25 April 1945 Wyro≈ºemski participated in the longest (five hours, fifty minutes) and last mission flown in World War II by fighters of the Polish Air Force. He flew as part of some 240 Mustangs from RAF 11 Group and the USAAF VIII Fighter Command, escorting 225 Avro Lancaster bombers on a Ramrod mission to hit Nazi headquarters in the Bavarian Alps. Some pilots landed in liberated territory on the European continent to refuel on the return leg of the mission while others calculated their loads sufficient to reach their bases in England. Wyro≈ºemski fell one kilometer short of Andrews Airfield and dead-sticked his Mustang into a pasture where several horses slowed his fighter sufficiently such that he was not injured. The livestock were not so fortunate. Fellow squadron mate Tadeusz Pinkowski, recounted \\"Seeing him approaching the airfield and then going down, we climbed [into] (sic) a jeep and sped toward him. We found him O.K. Those two horses were O.K. not! Leaving the scene we even joked a little; somebody pointed to the horse liver lying around and asked: 'Say, Ksawery. Didn't you forget something?'

R. Wyrozemski (Father of three boys; Alexander, Christopher and Frederik Wyrozemski) in 1959 and settled in Fort Walton Beach, Florida,[4] home of Eglin Air Force Base and the Air Proving Ground Center. Wyrozemski was employed by the Central Intelligence Agency where he was ostensibly involved with the Lockheed U-2 program as a Lockheed \\"employee\\".

Regarded as one of the most important figures of medieval Bulgaria, Euthymius was the last head of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church in the Second Bulgarian Empire. Arguably the best esteemed of all Bulgarian patriarchs, Euthymius was a supporter of hesychasm and an authoritative figure in the Eastern Orthodox world of the time. Early years Born around 1325 (between 1320‚Äì1330) and possibly an offspring of the eminent Tsamblak family of the capital Tarnovo, Euthymius was educated at the monastery schools in and around the city and became a monk. He joined the Kilifarevo Monastery around 1350, attracted by the fame of Theodosius of Tarnovo. Theodosius appointed him his first assistant in 1363 and the two went together to Tsarigrad, with Theodosius dying soon afterwards. Euthymius then consecutively joined the Studion monastery and the Great Lavra of Athanasius the Athonite on Mount Athos. He was influenced by outstanding scholars and reformers of Southeastern Europe's spiritual life, such as Gregory the Sinaite, Gregory Palamas, Callistus Philotheus and John Kukuzelis. He was sent into exile on the island of Lemnos by Byzantine Emperor John V Palaiologos and, upon his release, returned to the Bulgarian Zograf Monastery on Mount Athos. It was there that he first reflected on the spelling reforms and planned corrections to the translations of the clerical books. Activity in Bulgaria Around 1371 Euthymius returned to Bulgaria and founded the Holy Trinity Patriarchal Monastery near Tarnovo, where he grounded the Tarnovo Literary School. He established orthographic rules and corrected inaccurately translated religious books by comparing them to the Greek originals. These corrected texts became models for the Orthodox churches using Church Slavonic language: Bulgaria, Serbia, Romania, and Ukraine. Gregory Tsamblak, his biographer, compared Euthymius' work to that of Moses and Egyptian king Ptolemy I. In 1375, following the death of Patriarch Joanicius, Euthymius was elected to become his successor. A supporter of asceticism, Euthymius aimed to persecute heresies and moral decay. Euthymius became a prominent figure in the Orthodox world and a number of metropolitans and hegumens addressed him to interpret theological matters. There are 15 known works by Euthymius, including liturgical books, laudatory works, passionals and epistles. Among his literary disciples are Gregory Tsamblak, Metropolitan of Kiev; Cyprian, Metropolitan of Moscow; Joasaph of Bdin and Constantine of Kostenets. Establishment of Tarnovo Literary School and language reform Statue of Patriarch Evtimiy at the Veliko Tarnovo town gallery. During the time of patriarch Theodosius of Tarnovo Euthymius founded and ran the Tarnovo literary school, which was to quickly become an important cultural center of the Slavic Christian world. Euthymius initiated a language reform in Old Bulgarian that was widely influential to the standardized literary languages of Serbia, Walachia, Moldova, and the Ukrainian principalities.

With Tsar Ivan Shishman out of the city (leading the remnants of his troops to the fortress of Nikopol), Euthymius was the one entrusted with the defense of Tarnovo. After a three- month siege on 17 July 1393, the Ottomans captured the capital despite its ferocious resistance; Gregory Tsamblak several years later suggested the conquest was due to treason from one of the non-Christian neighborhoods of Tarnovo. Joasaph of Bdin, Metropolitan of Vidin, a contemporary of the event, described it as follows: \\"A great Muslim invasion happened and total destruction was done with this city and its surroundings.\\" According to Gregory Tsamblak, churches were turned into mosques, priests were expelled and substituted with \\"teachers of shamelessness.\\" 110 noted citizens of Tarnovo and boyars were massacred, but Patriarch Euthymius was reprieved and sent into exile in the theme of Macedonia (contemporary Thrace), possibly in the Bachkovo Monastery. He is supposed to have died there in 1402‚Äì1404. The Tarnovo Patriarchate thereupon ceased to exist as the Bulgarian church lost its independence and became subordinate to the Patriarchate of Constantinople until 1870. Patriarch Euthymius has been canonized and his memory is honored on the same day as that of his namesake Euthymius the Great, 20 January.

Other vertebrate taxa may have a comparable anatomical structure that is referred to as either a gular sac, throat sac, vocal sac or gular fold. In birds A male Greater sage-grouse with its gular sacs inflated. Gular skin can be very prominent, for example in members of the order Phalacrocoraciformes as well as in pelicans (which likely share a common ancestor). In many species, the gular skin forms a flap, or gular pouch, which is generally used to store fish and other prey while hunting. In cormorants, the gular skin is often colored, contrasting with the otherwise plain black or black-and-white appearance of the bird. This presumably serves some function in social signalling, since the colors become more pronounced in breeding adults. In frigatebirds, the gular skin (or gular sac or throat sac) is used dramatically. During courtship display, the male forces air into the sac, causing it to inflate over a period of 20 minutes into a startling huge red balloon. Because cormorants are closer relatives of gannets and anhingas (which have no prominent gular pouch) than of frigatebirds or pelicans, it can be seen that the gular pouch is either plesiomorphic or was acquired by parallel evolution. In other vertebrates The orangutan is the only known great ape to have this characteristic, where it is only present in males. In addition the walrus and some species of gibbon or lesser ape such as the siamang have a throat sac. Many amphibians will inflate their vocal sac to create certain vocalizations in order to communicate, scare off rivals (to proclaim territory or dominance), and to locate and attract a mate. The gular sac in this instance amplifies their voice to be heard louder and seemingly closer. Some species of lizard also have a gular fold and consequently, gular scales. The theropod dinosaur Pelecanimimus, which lived in the early Cretaceous Period 130 million years ago, also had a gular pouch, similar to the pelican after which it is named.

Kossy (born September 8, 1957) is a US writer, zine publisher, and online used book dealer based in Portland, Oregon. Specializing in the history of \\"forgotten, discredited and extreme ideas\\", which she calls \\"crackpotology and kookology\\", she is better known for her books Kooks: A Guide to the Outer Limits of Human Belief (1994, featuring the first biography of Francis E. Dec) and Strange Creations: Aberrant Ideas of Human Origins from Ancient Astronauts to Aquatic Apes (2001). Kossy was also the founder and curator of the Kooks Museum (1996‚Äì1999, online), and the editor-publisher of the magazine Book Happy (1997‚Äì2002, about \\"weird and obscure books\\"). Described by Wired as \\"an expert on kooks [who] has a genuine, if sometimes uncomfortable, affection for her subjects\\", Kossy wrote books reviewed in publications ranging from Fortean Times to New Scientist. Journalist Jonathan Vankin named her \\"the unchallenged authority on, well, kooks\\", and writer Bruce Sterling noted that she \\"boldly blazes new trails in the vast intellectual wilderness of American writers, thinkers and philosophers who were or are completely nuts\\". Life=Early life= Donna J. Kossy was born in 1957.Gale 2007. She started doing zines in sixth grade,Zines 1997. co-editing Kid Stuff with a friend: \\"It had gossip, fashions, poetry, jokes and even movie reviews. It sold for 5 cents. My mom typed it up and Xeroxed it at work!\\" After graduating college in 1979, Kossy became involved in punk culture via collage art, color xerox postcards and mail art. Kossy eventually became a computer programmer,Van Bakel 1995. but also published zines because \\"Publishing is power, pure and simple\\", and turned \\"author and folklorist.\\" =Adult life= At one time, Kossy was the housemate of fellow zine maker Pagan Kennedy.Blume, Harvey (1996). \\"Zine Queen: Pagan Kennedy on zines in the age of Web\\" (p. 2), Wired, Issue 4.01, January 1996. She attuned Chicago writer Dan Kelly to cult \\"kook\\" Francis E. Dec.Kelly, Dan (2005). \\"I've grown accustomed to your rants\\" , Chicago Journal, February 2, 2005 In the early 1980s, she was part of the Processed World (PW) magazine, then romantically involved with anti-PW and ex-SubGenius anarchist Bob BlackBlack, Bob (1989). \\"Bomb 'Em If They Can't Take a Joke\\", 1989, reprinted at www.inspiracy.com/black (from the other side, also reprinted and discussed at SubGenius.com) until 1987, moving with him to Boston in 1985. In 1989, research for her Kooks Magazine led Kossy to abandon much of her other work. She is now married to Ken DeVries (a.k.a. Orton Nenslo), also a member of the Church of the SubGenius and contributor to their books, who provided some illustrations for her books and some articles for her website. Works=False Positive (1984‚Äì1988)= In 1984, Kossy started publishing False Positive (1984‚Äì1988), a Xeroxed zine which ran for eleven issues. Each issue focused on one topic (such as technology, sex, Japan, cars, crime, kooks, food & drugs) and featured related book excerpts, satire, collages, drawings, etc. The zine and Kossy were quoted by Discordianism co- founder Kerry Thornley (alias Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst) in his 1991 foreword to the 5th edition of the Principia Discordia,Thornley, Kerry (1991). \\"Fifth Edition Introduction\\", in Principia Discordia, January 23, 1991, online copy at www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/principia reprinting the \\"Manifesto of the Artistic Elite of the Midwest\\". Kossy said that her \\"career as a crackpotologist\\"Kossy, \\"Ordering Information\\". started there with the \\"Kooks Pages\\" within each issue and the two special all-kooks issues. =Kooks Magazine (1988‚Äì1991)= In 1988, Kossy started publishing Kooks Magazine (1988‚Äì1991), now using offset printing and running for eight issues. A spinoff of the kooks pages of her zine, it was in line with the 1988 book High Weirdness by Mail by SubGenius co-founder Rev. Ivan Stang (who later praisedStang, Ivan. \\"The Best Book on Real KOOKS\\", www.subgenius.com the collected book) and featured obscure \\"kooks\\" as well as some better-documented \\"cranks\\" such as reclusive Spider- Man co-creator Steve DitkoDitko Fever. \\"Kooks Magazine #8\\", www.ditko- fever.com, consulted in March 2009 in its final issue (#8, November 1991). In Factsheet Five, the zine magazine, founder-editor Mike Gunderloy described it as \\"A collection of bizarre literature and semi-scholarly research on kooks: those folks who have all the answers that science and the authorities have been trying to suppress. This issue features [...] progress towards a theory of kookdom.\\"Gunderloy, Mike (1989). \\"The Original Donna Kossy's Kooks Magazine #4\\" (notice), Factsheet Five, No. 32, October 1989, , p. 45. then reported one year later that it \\"keeps getting better; you can spend hours lost in the worldviews here.\\"Gunderloy, Mike (1990). \\"Kooks Magazine #6\\" (notice), Factsheet Five, No. 38, October 1990, , p. 34. SubGenius and writer Richard Kadrey described it as \\"indispensable for anyone interested in the real bleeding edge of thought.\\"Kadrey, Richard (1998). \\"Kooks\\" (review), CyberCulture Zone: Resources: Zines, Street Tech, www.streettech.com, copyright 1998 ‚Äì Original date and place of publication unclear: issue #5 is mentioned as if recent, which would be around 1990‚Äì1991. Research for the topic even led Kossy to attend a recruitment meeting of Heaven's Gate (when it was calling itself Human Individual Metamorphosis), the group that ended in a 1997 mass suicide. =Kooks (1994)= In 1994, Feral House published Kossy's first book, Kooks: A Guide to the Outer Limits of Human Belief, an anthology containing updated articles from her zine along with articles written exclusively for the book, with the cover illustration painted by her husband. Organized into seven parts (Religion, Science, Metaphysics, Politics, Conspiracy, Enigmas; plus Outtakes in the 2nd ed.), it documented the rants and ravings of \\"kooks\\" such as Richard Brothers (Anglo-Israelism alias British Israelism), Charles E. Buon (God's Envoy to the U.S.A.), Ray Crabtree (The Philosopher King), the first biography of Francis E. Dec (Your Only Hope against the Gangster Computer God), Professor Arnold Ehret (Mucusless Diet Healing System), Joe Gould alias Professor Seagull (The Longest Book Ever Written), Jim and Lila Green (Aggressive Christianity Missionary Training Corps), Hillman Holcomb (Well Regulated Militia of Christian Technocracy), Les U. Knight (Voluntary Human Extinction Movement), alien abductee artist Paul Laffoley (Third Generation Lunatic Fringe), Alfred Lawson (Lawsonomy: The Base for Absolute Knowledge), David Linton (How Men Can Have Babies), Emil Matalik (World/U.S. Presidential Candidate Since 1964), the MIT's crank files (The Archive of Useless Research), Rose Mokry (Jewish Poisoners Are the Sole Producers of All the Diseases, Sudden Deaths and Birth Defects), Dr. Cyrus Teed (not Cyrus Tweed) alias Koresh (Koreshanity: We Actually Live on the Inside of the Earth), black supremacist Dwight York alias Malachi Z. York et al. (Ansaaru Allah Community of Nuwaubianism), etc. The book was praised as \\"a rich compendium of looniness\\"Feral House, \\"Kooks\\", citing this September 18, 1994 book review. by the Los Angeles Times, \\"indispensable for anyone interested in the real cutting edge of thought\\"Powell's Books, \\"Kooks\\" (sale page) by the San Francisco Chronicle, and a \\"delight\\" by Fortean Times. In Factsheet Five, the new editor R. Seth Friedman recommended it with, \\"I've been anxiously awaiting this book ever since Donna Kossy told me about her plans several years ago. [...] Don't miss out on this book.\\"Friedman, R. Seth (1994). \\"Kooks: A Guide to the Outer Limits of Human Belief\\" (review), Factsheet Five, No. 52, July 1994, , p. 44: \\"I've been anxiously awaiting this book ever since Donna Kossy told me about her plans several years ago. I was first introduced to the intriguing phenomena of kooks in her first zine False Positive. In 1989 she abandoned much of her other work in order to produce Kooks Magazine, completely devoted to documenting the ideas of people whose visions of the world don't correlate with the rest of us. It will take most people months to get through this entire 253-page volume just as it took her years to create it. [...] Don't miss out on this book. It's the one chance you'll get to find out how 'men can have babies' and if JFK is still alive.\\" Jay Kinney, publisher of Gnosis Magazine, found it \\"Compulsively readable. The 'kooks' collected in this volume are our true American originals and Donna Kossy chronicles their jaw-dropping messages with a rare mix of objectivity, sympathy, and wit.\\"Kossy 1999, \\"The Kooks Museum Gift Shoppe\\". And a 1995 Wired review described Kossy as \\"an expert on kooks [who] has a genuine, if sometimes uncomfortable, affection for her subjects.\\" =Kooks Outtakes (1995)= In 1995, Kooks Outtakes followed its namesake, being a 36-page supplement of material Kossy had left out for reasons of space; it was later merged with the second edition of the book in 2001, which the editor of Ink 19 praised, noting that \\"Kossy's style is direct and surprisingly unjudgemental. [...] Kossy is quite systematic in her research, and margin comments abound, along with a lush bibliography. This is serious stuff.\\"Koss, Ian (2001). \\"Kooks, by Donna Kossy\\" (review), Ink 19, August 2001, www.ink19.com =Kooks Museum (1996‚Äì1999)= In 1996, Kossy founded and curated on her web site the Kooks Museum (an online summary and extension of her book Kooks, updated until mid-1999 when it was discontinued and kept as an archive), explaining: \\"As curator and founder of the first Kooks Museum in history I am fulfilling a half-life-long goal of housing kook ideas from all over the world under one crumbling roof. [...] The point of all this excess is neither to debunk nor to proselytize. Rather, my intent is to document and study the vast cornucopia of forgotten, discredited and extreme ideas, with all due consideration to social and cultural context. Nor do I think all ideas are equally valid. Rather, I try to be both open-minded to and skeptical of them.\\"Kossy 1998, \\"Introduction to the Kooks Museum\\". The Museum was listed in the MetroActive guide to \\"the most interesting, unusual, weird or otherwise alternative sites on the World Wide Web\\" by journalist and writer on conspiracies Jonathan Vankin, who named Kossy \\"the unchallenged authority on, well, kooks.\\"Vankin 1996. =Book Happy (1997‚Äì2002)= In 1997, Kossy started editing and publishing Book Happy (1997‚Äì2002), a printed magazine which ran for seven issues. Written by Kossy and others (recurrent contributors includes Greg Bishop, Ken DeVries, Dan Howland, Dan Kelly, John Marr, Chris Mikul, David C. Morrison, Chip Rowe, Brian Tucker, Robert Tucker), it was dedicated to reviewing \\"weird and obscure books\\". The magazine was complemented by her web site (later becoming its domain name) and the formation of Book Happy Booksellers (Kossy, \\"Not Yet Asked Questions\\".) an online used book business specializing in unusual and hard-to-find items, with inventory listed on various book listing sites including Abebooks, Biblio, Alibris, Choosebooks and others. Book Happy was reviewed positively by English artist Mark Pawson (creator of Die-Cut Plug Wiring Diagram Book) in a 1999 review for the British cultural magazine Variant.Pawson, Mark (1999). , Variant magazine (Glasgow, Scotland), , vol. 2, no. 9 (Winter 1999/2000), online copy at www.variant.randomstate.org (www.variant.org.uk) =Strange Creations (2001)= In 2001, Feral House published Kossy's second full-length book, Strange Creations: Aberrant Ideas of Human Origins from Ancient Astronauts to Aquatic Apes (right after reprinting Kooks in an expanded edition). As of August 1998, Kossy had already announced the manuscript for her second book as being finished (with a tentative title balancing between \\"Aberrant Anthropology\\" and \\"Nazis, Saucers and Aquatic Apes\\") and its publication at Feral House scheduled for \\"Fall, 1999\\"; it would however be two more years before the actual release. Organized into seven parts (Extraterrestrial Origins, De-evolution, Race, Eugenics, Creationism, The Aquatic Ape Theory, and Urantia/Szukalski/H.I.M.), the book documented the fringe and pseudoscientific theories of \\"crackpots\\" such as David Barclay (mankind as dinosaurs pets), Helena Blavatsky (The Seven Root Races of Theosophy), Darwin's cousin Francis Galton (inventor of eugenics against regression toward the mean), Henry H. Goddard (inventor of moronism with The Kallikak Family), Madison Grant (Nordicism and scientific racism), Finnvald Hedin (The Thorians), Brinsley Le Poer Trench (UFOs from Hollow Earth), slave trader Edward Long (Polygenism: Man Comes From God, Negroes Come From Apes), Oscar Kiss Maerth (The Beginning Was the End: ape brain cannibalism), Alfred W. McCann (creationism), Elaine Morgan (aquatic ape hypothesis), Ra√´l (creation by extraterrestrials), B. H. Shadduck (de- evolution), Zecharia Sitchin (ancient astronauts), Lothrop Stoddard (Pan- Aryanism and racial purity), Stanis≈Çaw Szukalski (Zermatism: post-deluge Easter Island vs. Yetis), the Urantia Book (intelligent design by Life Carriers), George Van Tassel (Space Brothers aliens), Erich von D√§niken (Ancient Astronauts from the Chariots of the Gods?), etc. The book was praised from Fortean TimesBennet 2001. to BooklistQuoted in \\"Strange Creations\\" at Amazon.com. and from the Washington City PaperBagato 2000. to Counterpoise.Feral House, \\"Strange Creations\\". In a mixed review, the New Scientist noted that \\"Donna Kossy's Strange Creatures [sic!] is about people who have spent rather more time on these problems than most, visiting some of the weirder reaches of the human imagination\\".Herbert, Roy (2001). \\"Where did we come from?\\" (book review), New Scientist 2307:49, September 8, 2001. And Rev. Ivan Stang remarked: \\"To write entertainingly for 'nonkooks' about so- called kooks, crackpots, and possible visionaries requires walking a tightrope between tolerant understanding of 'outsider' psychology and graceful sarcasm, balancing both a solid grounding in the mainstream scientific paradigm, and a healthy distrust of the status quo.\\" Science-fiction writer Bruce Sterling, who also touched upon online cranks in his essay \\"Electronic Text\\", commented that \\"Donna Kossy boldly blazes new trails in the vast intellectual wilderness of American writers, thinkers, and philosophers who were or are completely nuts. Kooks ranks with such sociological classics as Mackay's Extraordinary Popular Delusions and Dudley's Mathematical Cranks. This, for obvious reasons, is a book which every science fiction writer should possess.\\"Turnaround, \\"Kooks\\". In her own words, Kossy has stated, \\"I seek not to debunk strange ideas, but to present them as a necessary segment of the full spectrum of human thought.\\"Kossy in Strange Creations (2001). Kossy is currently focused on her bookselling business and from November 2007 to September 2008 wrote a blog, \\"The Cutthroat World of Book Scouting\\" (http://bookhappy.easyjournal.com), which chronicled her experiences in the book trade.

Biography Yehuda Klein (later Amital) was born in Oradea, Romania, son of Yekutiel Ze'ev and Devora. After four years of secular primary education, he began religious studies with Rabbi Chaim Yehuda Levi.This Day in Jewish History / A yeshiva head and settler who had a change of heart is born When Germany occupied the area in 1944, the Nazis sent his entire family to Auschwitz where they were killed. Amital was sent to a labor camp, thus surviving the Holocaust. He remained in the labor camp for eight months, and was liberated on October 4, 1944, by the Soviet Army.BeEmunato, p. 98 After his liberation, he made his way to Bucharest, from where he travelled to Palestine, arriving on December 11, 1944.BeEmunato, p. 100 After a short stay at the Atlit detainee camp, he made his way to Jerusalem, where he studied at Hebron Yeshiva, receiving semicha from Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer. He also learned with Rabbi Yaakov Moshe Charlap, a student of Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Kook.BeEmunato, pp. 102-107 Around this time, he joined the Haganah. After learning at Hebron, he moved to Pardes Hanna in order to learn at Kletzk Yeshiva. While learning at the yeshiva, he married Miriam, the daughter of the Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Meltzer, and the granddaughter of Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer.BeEmunato, pp. 108-112, 116-117 When the yeshiva relocated to Rehovot, Amital followed, settling in Rehovot until he moved to Jerusalem in the 1960s. The day after the Declaration of Independence, Amital's unit was mobilized.BeEmunato p. 120 He took part in battles of Latrun and the western Galilee. After the war, Amital became a rabbinic secretary in the Beth Din of Rehovot, and, two years later, he became an instructor at Yeshivat HaDarom, where he helped formulate the idea of a Hesder Yeshiva. Amital died on July 9 (27 Tammuz), 2010, and was laid to rest in the Har HaMenuchot cemetery in Jerusalem, where thousands attended his funeral. Political career In 1988, Amital founded the left-leaning religious Meimad movement, and was elected as its chairman after it became a political party.BeEmunato, pp. 184-185 In 1995, he served as a Minister without Portfolio in the government of Shimon Peres, despite not being a Knesset member.BeEmunato, p. 224 Educational career After the Six-Day War, he founded Yeshivat Har Etzion, a Hesder Yeshiva in Gush Etzion. The yeshiva opened in Kfar Etzion in 1968 with 30 students. After two years, the institution moved to its current location in Alon Shvut. In 1971, Amital asked Aharon Lichtenstein to join him as Rosh Yeshiva. At the age of 80, Amital asked the management of Yeshivat Har Etzion to select his successors. The yeshiva chose Rabbis Yaaqov Medan and Baruch Gigi.BeEmunato, pp. 262-263 On January 4, 2006, Medan and Gigi were officially invested as co- roshei yeshiva, alongside Amital and Aharon Lichtenstein.BeEmunato, p. 265 On September 25, 2008, Amital officially announced his retirement, to take effect on the last day of the Jewish month of Tishrei, in the year 5769 (October 28, 2008). He also announced that Mosheh Lichtenstein, the son of Aharon Lichtenstein, would assume the position as the fourth Rosh Yeshiva on that same day. Amital continued to be a prominent public figure in Israel, with a broad impact on matters of religious and national concern. His students and disciples are leading figures in many walks of life. He had developed an educational philosophy which combines deep faithfulness to tradition and ethical responsibility to society at large with commitment to the moral and spiritual flourishing of each individual.

The status of Crimea is disputed between Russia and Ukraine as a result of the 2014 vote to join Russia which was held during Russian military intervention, and the subsequent annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. It serves as the administrative center of Alushta Municipality, one of the regions Crimea is divided into. Founded in the 6th century AD by Emperor Justinian, today it is a resort town. It is situated at the Black Sea beach line on the road from Hurzuf to Sudak, as well as on the Crimean Trolleybus line.

In 1910, 544 Jews lived in Alushta, consisting about 13% of the town population. In 1939, they consisted only 2.3% of the town overall population, numbering 251 individuals. On 4 November 1941, the Germans occupied the town and on 24 November 1941, a unit of sonderkommando 10b shot to death 30 Jews along with captured communists and partisans.

Early life  Almost nothing is known about Van Brakel's early career; we know neither his year of birth‚Äîestimates have varied from 1618 to 1642‚Äînor his backgrounds. It used to be thought that he was the son of Commodore Pieter van Brakel, who was killed in the Second Anglo-Dutch War while defending a convoy of merchant ships, but this has become very unlikely considering Pieter was born in 1624.  Naval career  The first time Van Brakel appears in the documents is in 1666, when he was appointed by the Admiralty of the Maze as acting captain‚Äîwith the rank of lieutenant‚Äîof a fireship, the Rotterdam, that participated in the Four Days Battle. Apparently he already had been a lieutenant in 1665. Fireships were often manned by the most desperate elements in society; the humility of his origins might explain the fact they were never mentioned. At St. James's Day Battle, having spent another fireship and returning with his crew in sloops, Van Brakel saved the Gelderland, the flagship of Lieutenant-Admiral Willem Joseph van Ghent from an attack by an English fireship. Because of the courage shown, Van Brakel was promoted to captain of a regular ship on 22 September 1666, a rare accomplishment for a fireship commander. In 1667, while in command of the frigate Vrede, he became one of the heroes of the raid on the Medway and was given the honourable task of triumphantly towing the captured English flagship out of the Medway river. That same year Van Brakel was promoted full captain on 17 December. In 1672, at the battle of Solebay‚Äîthe first battle of the Third Anglo-Dutch War‚ÄîVan Brakel served as captain of Groot Hollandia, and played a major part in the burning of HMS Royal James. In 1673, he continued to fight with distinction at the battle of Schooneveld and the battle of the Texel, as captain of Voorzichtigheid. On 5 April 1684, Van Brakel was promoted to rear admiral of the Admiralty of Amsterdam. Four years later, as a temporary vice admiral‚Äîfrom October 1688 until January 1689‚Äîhe was part of the fleet that brought William III to England in the invasion that led to the Glorious Revolution. From 1688 onwards, Van Brakel served on the amalgamated Anglo-Dutch fleet until he was killed in the battle of Beachy Head in 1690.

The name originates from the Greek word for fox (Alopex) . After the Greeks, Alupka came under control of the Byzantine Empire. The first written mention of Alupka dates to 960 in a document about the Byzantine Emperor Romanos II. Later on, Alupka was controlled by the Crimean Tatars. After 1783 the city came into possession of Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin, governor-general of the Novorossiya Krai. In 1798, the city had a population of 211, consisting mainly of farmers. At the end of 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, Alupka was a famous resort. In the middle of 19th century it was even more popular than Yalta, mostly because of the work of the Governor of NovoRossia - Mikhail Vorontsov, who build here a Palace (or even better say, Castle).

During the Yalta Conference, the palace‚Äîspared by the Germans during World War II ‚Äî served as the residence of Sir Winston Churchill and his English delegation. A large English-style park was designed and built for prince Vorontsov on the territory of the Vorontsov's Palace. The park was constructed from December 1824 to April 1851, and was envisioned, designed, created, and maintained by Chief Botanist of the Southern Shore of the Crimea, Carolus Antonius Keebach.

He is recognized as one of Africa's foremost thinkers. From 1972 to 1978 he was professor of African History at the University of Ouagadougou. In 1983, he was forced into exile, only being able to return in 1992. Ki-Zerbo founded the Party for Democracy and Progress / Socialist Party. He was its chairman until 2005, and represented it in the Burkina Faso parliament until his death in 2006. A socialist and an advocate of African independence and unity, Ki-Zerbo was also a vocal opponent of Thomas Sankara's revolutionary government.  Early life  Ki-Zerbo was born in Toma in the province of Nayala, in what was, at that time, the French colony of Upper Volta. He was the son of Alfred Diban Ki Zerbo and Th√©r√®se Folo Ki.Holenstein, R. (2006, December 11). Joseph Ki-Zerbo: A quand l‚ÄôAfrique. Le Faso.net (2006). Retrieved May 22, 2007 from His father is considered to be the first Burkinab√© Christian.http://burkinafaso.over- blog.net/article-joseph-ki-zerbo-42479407.html In 1915 he intervened during the Volta-Bani War to stop Toma being razed to the ground. Between 1933 and 1940, Ki-Zerbo was educated at the Catholic primary school in Toma, then completed his secondary school at the preparatory seminaries in Pabr√© in the Province of Kadiogo and Faladi√©, a district of Bamako, Mali. He then attended the Grand S√©minaire Saint-Pierre Claver at Koumi near Bobo Dioulasso, which trains young men for the Catholic priesthood. However, Ki-Zerbo dropped out of the Seminary and went to live in Dakar, Senegal for several years. In addition to teaching there, he had a job for several months with the weekly newspaper Afrique nouvelle, and also worked as a railway construction labourer. Ki-Zerbo continued his education part-time and, when he obtained his Baccalaureate in 1949 at the age of 27, he earned a scholarship to study in Paris. He studied history and law at the Sorbonne and also followed courses in politics at the Sciences Po. On completion of his studies, he became a certified history and geography teacher, the first from Upper Volta. After his studies, Ki-Zerbo became a French citizen and was employed as a history and geography teacher in Orl√©ans, Paris and Dakar. During a visit to Mali, Ki-Zerbo met his wife Jacqueline Coulibaly, the daughter of a Malian union leader.  Political activities  Ki-Zerbo's political activities started while he was student. He was the co-founder and president of the Association of Upper Volta Students in France (1950‚Äì1956). He was also the president of the Association of African, Caribbean and Malagash Christian Students. In 1954, Ki-Zerbo published an article in the newspaper Tam-Tam with the title ‚ÄúOn demande des nationalistes‚Äù (‚ÄúWe ask the nationalists‚Äù). In Paris, Ki-Zerbo met other intellectuals, such as the Senegalese historian Cheik Anta Diop and Abdoulaye Wade, who was later to become president of Senegal. The 1950s was a decade of great optimism in Africa, with many leaders demanding independence. Ki-Zerbo was active in this movement for change, and in 1957 he created a political party, the Mouvement de Liberation Nationale (MLN) (National Freedom Movement). He also established contact with Kwame Nkrumah, president of the newly independent neighboring state of Ghana.Barry, A. (2006, December 5). Joseph Ki-Zerbo, un √©rudit √©pris de libert√© politique.

The MLN contacted nationalist leaders in many of the other French colonies, to persuade them to reject the referendum on the creation of a Franco-African community presented by the French president Charles de Gaulle. However, in the whole of West Africa at that time, only Guinea voted no to the referendum and, as a result, achieved its independence relatively early in 1958. As a result, Sekou Tour√©, the first president of independent Guinea, invited Ki-Zerbo and his wife along with other volunteers to come to Conakry to replace the French teachers who had left. In 1960, Ki- Zerbo returned to newly independent Upper Volta, explaining to Sekou Tour√© that \\"I have to go back home to pursue the fight for independence in others territories‚Äù. In 1965, he was nominated as academy inspector and general director of Youth, Sports and Education. Ki-Zerbo was professor at the University of Ouagadougou from 1968 to 1973. He was the co-founder and general director (1967 to 1979) of the Conseil africain et malgache pour l'enseignement sup√©rieur (African and Malagasy Council on Higher Education (CAMES) that assures the academic autonomy of Africans countries.  Social and political ideas  Ki-Zerbo declared that growing up in a rural area in a big family profoundly influenced his personality and thoughts. Ki-Zerbo exposed his social and political ideas in many publications on history and culture. He wrote a teaching manual called Le Monde Africain Noire (Black African World), published in 1963. In 1972, Ki-Zerbo published the famous Histoire de l‚ÄôAfrique Noire (History of Black Africa) that became a reference book in African history. Holenstein (2006) described that, in his book, Ki- Zerbo challenged the common belief of Africa as a black continent without culture and history. He claimed that Africa had reached an upper level of political, social and cultural development before the Atlantic slave trade and colonization. Written only few years after independence, Histoire de l‚ÄôAfrique Noire represented the hope of many Africans of a brighter future in liberty and self-determination. Sitchet (2003), an Africultures reporter, argued that from 1972 to 1978 Ki-Zerbo was an executive member of UNESCO (United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization).Sitchet, T. C. (2003 October 27). A quand l‚ÄôAfrique ? Joseph Ki-Zerbo. Critique d‚Äôun entretien avec Ren√© Holenstein. Africultures (2003). Retrieved May 22, 2007 from From 1976 to 2001, Ki-Zerbo was the president of the African Historian Association and a professor at the University of Ouagadougou. His conviction on education led him to found in 1980 the Centre for African Development Studies (CEDA) that has this goal ‚Äúon ne developpe pas, on se developpe‚Äù (\\"we don‚Äôt develop, we develop ourselves\\"). Holenstein (2006) insisted that on the basis of a critic on the relation north‚Äìsouth imperialism, Ki-Zerbo forecast an endogenous development that will take seriously ecological and social skills, and the African cultural identity. His endogenous development is a practice that lets native farmers use their own ideas and traditions alongside new technology. It incorporates the ideas and knowledge of indigenous cultures rather than disregarding them.  Political fights  After scientific research and teaching, Ki-Zerbo continued with his political activities. Under the Burkinabe President Maurice Yameogo‚Äôs regime (1960-1966), the creation of any political party was forbidden. Holenstein (2006) explained this in an article on the interview about Ki-Zerbo‚Äôs book A quand l‚ÄôAfrique. Ki-Zerbo got his members in the syndical teachers‚Äô class and villagers. The syndicate and MLN played a big role in the popular movement organization on 3 January 1966 that brought down the President Maurice Yameogo. General Secretary of the MLN, Ki- Zerbo went to the 1970s legislative elections; he got sixth rank. In February the Burkina Faso parliament was ruined during a military coup. In October, banning was cancelled. Many new parties arose like Union Progressiste Voltaique (UPV) under the control of Ki-Zerbo that replaced MLN. UPV was in opposition to the government party (Union Democratique Voltaique-Rassemblement Democratique Africain (UDV-RDA).)  Exile  In 1983, a group of young officers took power by a military coup under the control of the Captain Thomas Sankara. A new stage started for Upper Volta which became Burkina Faso (‚ÄúLand of the upright‚Äù). Under the power of the new government, Ki-Zerbo was obliged to go into exile. In 1985 he was finally arrested with his family for two years of detention and became free only after another military coup organized by Blaise Compaore. Even in exile, he created research centers like the Research Centre for Endogenous Development (CRDE) and taught at Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar. He returned to Burkina Faso in 1987 to find that his library of 11,000 books in his hometown Faso had been burned in his absence. He came back and tried to rebuild by getting a place in parliament.  Awards  Ki-Zerbo has received recognition through various international awards. * In 1997 he was honoured with the Right Livelihood Award for his research on development. This prize is given to those who try to find credible solutions to the protection of the environment and nature; it is for people who helped the development of human rights and peace. * In 2000, he received the Al- Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights. * In 2001, Ki-Zerbo was awarded the title of Doctor Honoris Causa of the University of Padua in Italy.  Bibliography  Ki-Zerbo as an historian has published books with endogenous development as the central theme: * 1964: Le Monde africain noir (Paris, Hatier) * 1972: Histoire de l‚ÄôAfrique noire (Paris, Hatier) * 1991: Histoire g√©n√©rale de l‚ÄôAfrique * 2003: A quand l'Afrique, co-authored with Ren√© Holenstein (Editions de l‚ÄôAube) * 2005: Afrique Noire, co-authored with Didier Ruef (Infolio √©ditions) In 2004, his book \\"A quand l'Afrique\\" was awarded the RFI prize \\"T√©moin du monde\\". In addition, Ki Zerbo was a committed historian and politician. Ki-Zerbo extended his fights internationally to make people recognize slavery as a crime against humanity and that Africa should get reparations for this. He tried to combine science and political activity. Ki- Zerbo summed his philosophy up in the following quote: > ‚ÄúThe Africa which the world needs is a continent able to stand up, to walk > on its own feet‚Ä¶ it is an Africa conscious of its own past and able to keep > on reinvesting this past into its present and future.‚Äù  References  Category:Burkinab√© writers Category:Burkinab√© historians Category:University of Paris alumni Category:Right Livelihood Award laureates Category:1922 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Party for Democracy and Progress / Socialist Party politicians Category:Cheikh Anta Diop University faculty Category:University of Ouagadougou faculty Category:People from Boucle du Mouhoun Region Category:Members of the National Assembly of Burkina Faso Category:20th-century historians ","title":"Joseph Ki-Zerbo"},{"id":"2295916","text":"Brian Pala Lima (born 25 January 1972) is a Samoan former rugby union player who was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2011. He earned the nickname of \\"The Chiropractor\\" for his shuddering hits both on and off the pitch that supposedly rearranged the bones of the victim. National team Lima was born in Apia, Samoa. He debuted for the Samoa national rugby union team in 1990. He featured in Samoa's famous World Cup win over Wales in 1991, and he was the youngest player at the 1991 Rugby World Cup. One of Lima's most illuminating moments came in Samoa's match against South Africa in a group match at the 2003 Rugby World Cup. As Springbok fly-half Derick Hougaard leapt up in the air to catch a hospital pass, Lima \\"dive-tackled\\" him, sending Hougaard crashing to the ground.. Lima was the first player to appear in five World Cups, his fifth being the 2007 World Cup in France, in which he came on against South Africa in Samoa's first game after 60 minutes. According to the Samoa Observer, Lima announced that he would retire after the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Michael Jones, the Samoa coach (at that time), announced Lima as the captain for the first game of that year's Pacific Nations Cup. Brian Lima was selected to lead Samoa against Fiji. This game was one of Brian's last games on Samoan soil. Lima also played for the Samoa national rugby sevens team. He scored 17 tries in various Rugby World Cup Sevens tournaments, ranking him third all-time in career World Cup Sevens tries.http://fijisun.com.fj/2009/03/07/serevi-vunibaka-still-stand-tall/ Professional Lima signed for Munster after an impressive game for the southern hemisphere vs the northern hemisphere in a fundraising game for the 2004 tsunami.

These organosulfur compounds have the formula [SR3]+. Together with a negatively charged counterion, they give sulfonium salts. They are typically colorless solids that are soluble in organic solvent. Synthesis Sulfonium compounds are usually synthesized by the reaction of thioethers with alkyl halides. For example, the reaction of dimethyl sulfide with iodomethane yields trimethylsulfonium iodide: : + ‚Üí + Before the above reaction, the sulfur atom has two lone electron pairs. One of these lone pairs links to the methyl group. At the same time, as part of a concerted nucleophilic substitution mechanism (SN2), the iodide leaving group departs. This leaves a positively charged trimethylsulfonium ion, whose charge is balanced by the iodide. The rate of reaction is even faster with stronger methylating agents, such as methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate. Structure The compounds are pyramidal at sulfur. Thus, Me3S+ is isostructural and isoelectronic to trimethylphosphine. Sulfonium compounds wherein the three substituents differ are chiral and optically stable.March, J. ‚ÄúAdvanced Organic Chemistry‚Äù 5th Ed. J. Wiley and Sons, 1992: New York. .

He was the son of Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, 1st Duke of Lennox, the youngest of the seven illegitimate sons of King Charles II. He was the most important of the early patrons of the game of cricket and did much to help its evolution from village cricket to first-class cricket. Early life Lennox was styled Earl of March from his birth in 1701 as heir to his father's dukedom.Marshall, p. 1. He also inherited his father's love of sports, particularly cricket.Marshall, pp. 7‚Äì17. He had a serious accident at the age of 12 when he was thrown from a horse during a hunt, but he recovered and it did not deter him from horsemanship.Marshall, pp. 18‚Äì20. March entered into an arranged marriage in December 1719 when he was still only 18 and his bride, Hon. Sarah Cadogan, was just 13, in order to use Sarah's large dowry to pay his considerable debts. They were married at The Hague.Marshall, pp. 24‚Äì25. In 1722, March became Member of Parliament for Chichester as first member with Sir Thomas Miller as his second. He gave up his seat after his father died in May 1723 and he succeeded to the title of 2nd Duke of Richmond. A feature of Richmond's career was the support he received from his wife, Sarah, her interest being evident in surviving letters. Their marriage was a great success, especially by Georgian standards. Their grandson who became the 4th Duke is known to cricket history as the Hon. Col. Charles Lennox, a noted amateur batsman of the late 18th century who was one of Thomas Lord's main guarantors when he established his new ground in Marylebone.Altham, p. 51. Cricket career=The Duke of Richmond's XI= The 2nd Duke of Richmond has been described as early cricket's greatest patron.Underdown, p. 53. Although he had played cricket as a boy, his real involvement began after he succeeded to the dukedom.Birley, p. 18. He captained his own team and his players included some of the earliest known professionals, such as his groom Thomas Waymark. Later, when he patronised Slindon Cricket Club, Richmond was associated with the Newland brothers. His earliest recorded match is the one against Sir William Gage's XI on 20 July 1725, which is mentioned in a surviving letter from Sir William to the Duke.McCann, p. 4Marshall, p. 41. Records have survived of four matches played by Richmond's team in the 1727 season. Two were against Gage's XI and two against an XI raised by the Surrey patron Alan Brodrick.McCann, pp. 6‚Äì7. These last two games are highly significant because Richmond and Brodrick drew up Articles of Agreement beforehand to determine the rules that must apply in their contests. These were itemised in sixteen points.Birley, pp. 18‚Äì19. It is believed that this was the first time that rules (or some part of the rules as in this case) were formally agreed, although rules as such definitely existed. The first full codification of the Laws of Cricket was done in 1744. In early times, the rules would be agreed upon orally and were subject to local variations; this syndrome was also evident in football until the FA was founded, especially regarding the question of handling the ball. Essentially the articles of agreement focused on residential qualifications and ensuring that there was no dissent by any player other than the two captains.Birley, p. 19. In 1728, Richmond's Sussex played twice against Edwin Stead's Kent and lost both matches, \\"(Kent's) men have been too expert for those of Sussex\\".Waghorn, p. 7. In 1730, Richmond's team played two matches against Gage's XI and another match against a Surrey XI backed by a Mr Andrews of Sunbury. Richmond lost to Andrews.Waghorn, p. 1. The second of his matches against Gage, due to be played at The Dripping Pan, near Lewes, was \\"put off on account of Waymark, the Duke's man, being ill\\".Waghorn, pp. 1‚Äì2. In 1731, Richmond was involved in one of the most controversial matches recorded in the early history of cricket. On 16 August, his Sussex team played a Middlesex XI backed by one Thomas Chambers at an unspecified venue in Chichester. Chambers' team won this match, which had a prize of 100 guineas, and a return was arranged to take place at Richmond Green on 23 August.Buckley, p. 6. The return match was played for 200 guineas and it is notable as the earliest match of which the team scores are known: Richmond's XI 79, Chambers' XI 119; Richmond's XI 72, Chambers' XI 23‚Äì5 (approx.). The game ended promptly at a pre-agreed time although Chambers' XI with \\"four or five more to have come in\\" and needing \\"about 8 to 10 notches\\" clearly had the upper hand. The end result caused a fracas among the crowd at Richmond Green, who were incensed by the prompt finish because the Duke of Richmond had arrived late and delayed the start of the game. The riot resulted in some of the Sussex players \\"having the shirts torn off their backs\\" and it was said \\"a law suit would commence about the play\\".McCann, pp. 12‚Äì13. In a note about another match involving Chambers' XI in September, G. B. Buckley has recorded that Richmond may have conceded the result to Chambers, presumably to stop the threat of litigation.Buckley, p. 7. Richmond is not mentioned in cricket sources again for ten years. He may have stepped aside after the 1731 fracas but it is more likely that he terminated his Duke of Richmond's XI after he broke his leg in 1733 and could no longer play himself.McCann, p. lxi. Instead, he channelled his enthusiasm for cricket through a team from the small village of Slindon, which bordered on his Goodwood estate. =Slindon= The rise to fame of Slindon Cricket Club was based on the play of Richard Newland and the patronage of Richmond. On Thursday, 9 July 1741, in a letter to her husband, the Duchess of Richmond mentions a conversation with John Newland regarding a Slindon v. East Dean match at Long Down, near Eartham, a week earlier. This is the earliest recorded mention of any of the Newland family.McCann, p. 19. Then, on 28 July, Richmond sent two letters to the Duke of Newcastle to tell him about a game that day which had resulted in a brawl with \\"hearty blows\\" and \\"broken heads\\". The game was at Portslade between Slindon, who won, and unnamed opponents.McCann, p. 20. On Monday 7 September 1741, Slindon played Surrey at Merrow Down, near Guildford. Richmond, in a letter to the Duke of Newcastle before the game, spoke of \\"poor little Slyndon against almost your whole county of Surrey\\". Next day he wrote again, saying that \\"wee (sic) have beat Surrey almost in one innings\\".McCann, pp. 20‚Äì21. The Duchess wrote to him on Wednesday 9 September and said she \\"wish'd..... that the Sussex mobb (sic) had thrash'd the Surrey mob\\". She had \\"a grudge to those fellows ever since they mob'd you\\" (apparently a reference to the Richmond Green fiasco in August 1731). She then said she wished the Duke \\"had won more of their moneys\\".McCann, p. 21. In 1744, Richmond created what is now the world's oldest known scorecard for the match between London and Slindon at the Artillery Ground on 2 June. Slindon won by 55 runs and the original scorecard is now among Richmond's papers in the possession of the West Sussex Records Office. In August 1745, Richmond backed a Sussex XI against Surrey in a match at Berry Hill, near Arundel. It appears that Surrey won the game in view of a comment made by Lord John Philip Sackville in a letter to Richmond dated Saturday 14 September: \\"I wish you had let Ridgeway play instead of your stopper behind it might have turned the match in our favour\\".McCann, pp. 34‚Äì35. =Single wicket= When single wicket became the dominant form of cricket in the late 1740s, Richmond entered a number of teams mostly centred on Stephen Dingate, who was in his employ at the time. For example, a number of matches were played by a \\"threes\\" team of Dingate, Joseph Rudd and Pye. Richmond often found himself opposed by his former groom Thomas Waymark, still an outstanding player but now resident in Berkshire.Ashley-Cooper, At the Sign of the Wicket, p. 52. Richmond died on 8 August 1750. He had been arguably the greatest of the game's early patrons, particularly of the Slindon club and of Sussex cricket in general. His death was followed by a slump in the fortunes of Sussex cricket, which featured few matches of significance until the rise of Brighton Cricket Club in the 1790s. Career in the peerage Richmond held many titles, including the Order of the Garter (KG), Order of the Bath (KCB), Privy Counsellor (PC) and Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). In 1734 he succeeded to the title of Duke of Aubigny in France on the death of his grandmother Louise de K√©rouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth. He served as Lord of the Bedchamber to King George II from 1727 and, in 1735, he was appointed Master of the Horse. Freemasonry He was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society on 1724.Wikisource DNB Later that year, he followed his father, the 1st Duke, into freemasonry and was a Grand Master of the Premier Grand Lodge of England in 1724, a few years after its formation in 1717. His father had been a Master Mason in Chichester in 1696. As Duke of Aubigny, he also assisted in introducing freemasonry into France. In 1734, he created a masonic lodge in the Chateau d'Aubigny near Metz in north-east France. One a year later, with another past Grand Master, John Theophilus Desaguliers, he assisted in inaugurating a lodge in the hotel at Rue Bussy, in Paris.Audrey T. Carpenter, John Theophilus Desaguliers: A Natural Philosopher, Engineer and Freemason in Newtonian England, Continuum, 2011, pp199-207 Civic roles He was elected Mayor of Chichester for 1735‚Äì36. Richmond was one of the founding Governors of London's Foundling Hospital, which received its Royal Charter from George II in 1739. The Foundling Hospital was a charity dedicated to saving London's abandoned children. Both the Duke and the Duchess took great interest in the project. The Duke attended committee meetings and both took part in the baptism and naming of the first children accepted by the hospital in March 1741. Military career Richmond was a Lieutenant-General in the British Army and served under the notorious Duke of Cumberland in the Hanoverian campaign against the Jacobite rising of 1745. Smuggling The 1740s was a turbulent time for Sussex. There was a rise in smuggling gangs; of these probably, the most violent was the notorious Hawkhurst Gang.McGlynn, pp. 185‚Äì189 The gang were responsible for the brutal murder of a bootmaker and a customs official.Waugh, p.143 Richmond decided to pursue those responsible with a vengeance. He began by petitioning the authorities so that a special assize could be held at Chichester.Dyndor Z. The Gibbet in the Landscape: Locating the Criminal Corpse in Mid-Eighteenth-Century England. In: Ward R, editor. A Global History of Execution and the Criminal Corpse. Basingstoke (UK): Palgrave Macmillan; 2015. Chapter 3. Accessdate 18 December 2018 He did not trust the local Justices (in West Sussex), as they could not be relied on to convict smugglers. He therefore obtained authorisation for judges to be brought down from London. The judges (Sir Thomas Birch, Sir Michael Foster and Baron Clive) made their way under guard to Goodwood, where Richmond entertained them before the trial. His pogrom against the gang, was possibly partly because it was feared that the smugglers were assisting the Jacobites by providing intelligence to the French. All the culprits involved in the murder of the two men were captured and convicted. During Richmond's two-year campaign, against the illegal trade, thirty-five smugglers were executed and another ten died in gaol before they could be hanged. However although his campaign managed to reduce the incidence of smuggling it was reported by the writer Horace Walpole, in 1752 (after Richmond's death) that Sussex was \\"stiff\\" with smugglers. Marriage and issue Richmond married Lady Sarah Cadogan (1705‚Äì1751), daughter of William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan, on 4 December 1719 at The Hague, Netherlands. They had twelve children: * Lady Georgiana Carolina Lennox (27 March 172324 July 1774), married Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland, and had issue. * Lord Charles Lennox (3 September 17241724), Earl of March. * Lady Louisa Margaret Lennox (15 November 1725May 1728). * Lady Anne Lennox (27 May 17261727). * Lord Charles Lennox (9 September 1730November 1730), Earl of March. * Lady Emilia Mary Lennox (6 October 173127 March 1814), married first James FitzGerald, 1st Duke of Leinster, and had issue; and secondly William Ogilvie and had issue. * Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond (22 February 173529 December 1806). * Lord George Lennox (29 November 173725 March 1805), General, father of Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond. * Lady Margaret Lennox (16 November 173910 January 1741). * Lady Louisa Augusta Lennox (24 November 17431821), married Thomas Connolly but had no issue. * Lady Sarah Lennox (14 February 1745August 1826), married first Sir Charles Bunbury, 6th Baronet, and had issue (although not by her husband, but by Lord William Gordon); and secondly George Napier by whom she had issue. * Lady Cecilia Lennox (28 February 175021 November 1769), unmarried.Patrick Cracroft-Brennan, Richmond, Duke of (E, 1675).

Koktebel is situated on the shore of the Black Sea about halfway between Feodosia and Sudak and is subordinated to the Feodosia Municipality. Population: History It is best known for its literary associations. The Russian poet Maximilian Voloshin made it his residence, where he entertained many distinguished guests, including Marina Tsvetayeva, Osip Mandelshtam, and Andrey Bely (who died there). They all wrote remarkable poems in Koktebel. Another prominent literary resident of Koktebel was Ilya Ehrenburg who lived there circa 1919 while escaping from anti-Semitic riots in Kiev. The name K√∂kt√∂bel is of Turkic origin: in Crimean Tatar it means ‚ÄúLand of the blue hills‚Äù (from k√∂k, ‚Äúsky blue‚Äù, and t√∂be, ‚Äúhill‚Äù or ‚Äúmountain‚Äù, composed with the collective suffix -el). Its Soviet name of Planerskoye comes from the Russian planer, or glider: the hills above the shoreline were the site of many early experiments in manned heavier-than-air flight by Russian pioneer aviators. The local airfield is still known as Planerskoye. The 2003 film of the same name by Boris Khlebnikov and Aleksei Popogrebsky follows the journey of a father and son as they try to reach Koktebel from Moscow. Koktebel was known as a vacation spot for writers in the Soviet Union. It is also famous for its brandy, its hang-gliding and its naturist beach, largest in the former USSR. Nowadays, Koktebel fills up in the summer with tourists from Russia and until the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea also from Ukraine. Rubles and dollars are readily exchanged in kiosks along the beaches. There is a mixture of public beaches and private beaches with a paved walkway all along the bay. This walkway is lined with small restaurants, cafes, kiosks, and small market areas selling arts and crafts, dried fish, or slices of home-baked cake. In the evening, the beachfront comes alive with many small discos offering music, beer and shashlik. The cuisine is predominantly Tatar but Russian and Ukrainian food is also on offer. There are boat excursions, horse-riding and trips to a nearby monastery or to the cognac factory. Accommodation is either in a small hotel or in one of the hundreds of guesthouses run by local residents. It seems as though the whole population has turned into innkeepers in the summer. Koktebel is nowadays also well known for its jazz festival that usually takes place in the middle of September. It lures the attention of jazz-lovers from the whole ex-USSR. Cast from the festival in past years included De-Phazz, Nino Katamadze, Stanley Clarke, Billy Cobham and many other famous jazz and world music performers. But the festival's 2014 edition will be held in Zatoka and Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi (both in Odessa Oblast).Koktebel Jazz Festival's 2014 venue is Odesa, Interfax-Ukraine (10 June 2014) ReferencesExternal links * * Koktebel.net - Map of the place Koktebel Category:Feodosia Municipality Category:Urban-type settlements in Crimea Category:Seaside resorts in Russia Category:Seaside resorts in Ukraine Category:Tourist attractions in Crimea Category:Nude beaches ","title":"Koktebel"},{"id":"2295931","text":"Petty Officer Edgar Evans (7 March 1876 ‚Äì 17 February 1912) was a Welsh naval seaman and member of the \\"Polar Party\\" in Robert Falcon Scott's ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition to the South Pole in 1911‚Äì1912.

Evans was nearly left behind in New Zealand when he drunkenly fell into the water while boarding the ship. However, held in high regard by Scott for \\"his resourcefulness, his strength and fund of anecdotes,\\" Scott decided to overlook the incident. Scott chose Evans as a member of his polar party, with Lieutenant Henry Robertson Bowers, Lawrence Oates, and Edward Adrian Wilson. Scott described Evans as \\"a giant worker‚Äîhe is responsible for every sledge, every sledge-fitting, tents, sleeping-bags, harness, and when one cannot recall a single expression of dissatisfaction with any one of these items, it shows what an invaluable assistant he has been\\". Eleven weeks after setting off from base camp, the Polar party reached the South Pole on 17 January 1912, only to discover that Roald Amundsen's five-man party had beaten them to the Pole by five weeks. Their return journey soon became a desperate affair. Evans had cut his hand in an accident as they were nearing the pole, and the wound did not heal properly. During the return journey Evans began to deteriorate mentally as well as physically, suffering from frostbite to his fingers, nose and cheeks. As they descended the Beardmore Glacier, he is thought to have suffered a head injury in a fall into a crevasse on 4 February, sustaining a serious concussion which caused his condition to rapidly worsen. During the whole descent his condition delayed the party, and the surplus food gradually diminished. Memorial to Evans in St Mary's Church, Rhossili On 16 February 1912, nearing the base of the glacier, Evans collapsed. The next morning, unable to keep up, he was left behind while the others went ahead man-hauling the sledge towards the next supply depot; they had to make a return journey to fetch him. Scott's diary described Evans's condition when they found him; 'He was on his knees, clothing disarranged, hands uncovered and frostbitten and with a \\"wild look in his eyes\\". He was placed onto a sledge and taken to the camp they had set up. By the time he was placed in the tent, he was comatose. He died in the tent that night. It was not recorded what was done with his body, and none of the other members of the polar party survived the return journey. His widow, Lois (they had married in 1904 and had three children), had a plaque placed, in his memory, in the Norman church at Rhossilli. It reads \\"To the Glory of God and in memory of Edgar Evans 1st Class Petty Officer, R.N., and a native of this Parish, who perished on 17 February 1912, when returning from the South Pole with the Southern Party of the British Antarctic Expedition under the command of Captain Robert Falcon Scott, C.V.O., R.N. 'To seek, to strive, to find, and not to yield.'\\" Evans was also remembered at the naval shore establishment on Whale Island, Portsmouth where the Edgar Evans Building was opened in 1964, the first to be named after a petty officer rather than an admiral. The building was demolished in 2010, but a new accommodation block was named after Evans. The new building contains a memorial to him that incorporates two skis he used in Antarctica. An award, named the 'Edgar Evans Award', is also given each year to the highest placed student of all Petty Officer (Missile) courses for that year. There is also a commemorative plaque on the Scott lighthouse memorial in Roath Park Lake in Cardiff, South Wales, which lists all of the crew members including Evans. Evans N√©v√©, Victoria Land, is named in honour of Edgar Evans. In popular culture In the film Scott of the Antarctic, Edgar Evans was played by James Robertson Justice. In the Central TV production The Last Place on Earth, Evans was played by Pat Roach, and in BBC Radio 4's The Worst Journey in the World by Huw Davies. Evans is a character in Beryl Bainbridge's novel The Birthday Boys (1991).  References = Footnotes  Bibliography = *Fiennes, Ranulph (2003). Captain Scott.

History=Victorian origins= RD Clark (eighth from the right) poses with boys and colleagues shortly after taking occupation of the newly built \\"Main Building\\", 1888. Maritzburg College was founded as the Pietermaritzburg High School in 1863, by William Calder, in a carpenter's shop in what is today Langalibalele Street, to accommodate the influx of children arriving at the new city of Pietermaritzburg and its surrounding farmlands in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. As the school - commonly known as 'College' - swelled, \\"the best-trained [architect] in the Colony\\", PM Dudgeon,for a biography of Philip Maurice Dudgeon, see http://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/archframes.php?archid=428 was commissioned to design ‚Äì on the then outskirts of the city ‚Äì a larger classroom and boarding block, which was completed in 1888 and later became known as 'Clark House', honouring the school's third headmaster, RD Clark (MA (Oxon)), who is often referred to as ‚Äòthe Father of College‚Äô. Clark House carries the KwaZulu-Natal provincial heritage authorities' seal certifying it as a heritage landmark. A similar honour was bestowed on the school's Victoria Hall, the building of which commenced in 1897 (Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee year) and which served as a British Army hospital from November 1899 until July 1900 during the Second Boer War. =Headmasters= Since the school's foundation in 1863, the following 15 men have held the post of headmaster of Maritzburg College: *Calder, William (Edinburgh Training College), 1863-1867 *Forder, James, BA (Cantab), 1868-1878 *Clark, Robert D, MA (Oxon), 1879-1902 *Barns, Ernest W ('Pixie'), MA (London), 1902-1925 *Pape, Septimus W, MA (Oxon), 1926-1937 *Snow, John H ('Froggy'), BA Hons (London), 1937-1941 *Hudson, John W ('John-Willie'), BA (NUC), 1941-1953 *Fuller, Raymond E ('Bones'), BA, 1954-1965 * *Commons, Hector J, MA (South Africa), 1966-1977 * *Olivier, Keith, BA UED (Natal), 1978-1985 * *Forde, R Dudley, MA (Natal), 1986-1992 *Elliott, Kenneth P, BA BEd (Natal), 1992-2002 * *Pearson, Clive, BA UED (Rhodes), 2003-2005 *Jury, D Ronald, BSc UED (Natal), 2006-2012 *Luman, Christopher J, MED (UNISA) BA HDE (UCT) PGDip Sport Management (Massey), 2013- =Prominent members of staff= The following men were renowned as schoolmasters at Maritzburg College in the first 100 years of its existence: *Rev John Dryden Stalker (Senior Assistant Master 1881-1902): Stalker was made Vice-Principal of the (then) High School under Mr RD Clark in 1881, and remained in that post until shortly after the departure of 'his beloved old chief' in 1902. An ordained minister of the Presbyterian Church, he is described as 'a strange spiky-looking man with a long, flowing beard'. Although he had none of RD Clark's bonhomie, being a somewhat 'hot-tempered and severe man', he was an English scholar of the first order, with a deep knowledge and love for the works of Shakespeare, from whose plays he could quote vast passages on demand. *AS Langley (Senior Resident Master 1897-1909): As a schoolboy in England in the 1880s, Langley had come 'under the narcotic influence' of rugby,\\"Skonk Nicholson Remembers Mr Langley\\", Maritzburg College Archives, 2010 and his admiration of athleticism was to henceforth be a hallmark of his vigorous, formidable personality. He captained and later coached the Maritzburg College First XV, and at the end of 1909 departed for the Durban High School, where he was to earn lasting fame as an iron-willed Head Master from 1910 to 1931. His nickname, 'Madevu', came from the Zulu word for 'moustache'. *William Abbit (Senior Resident Master 1902-1925): Known forever as 'Fluff', Abbit had shown himself to be a gifted mathematician at Cambridge University, where he had been the Second Wrangler of his year. His teaching 'was somewhat inspired by communion with Bacchus', and the stories of his escapades are part of the school's folklore. One of the school's favourite legends has it that his ghost still inhabits Clark House, where he lived for 23 years until shortly before his death in 1927. *Robert Goldstone (staff 1909-1939, Games Master): A New Zealander by birth, Goldstone served in the Second Boer War. An amiable, kindly man, somewhat given in his later years to dozing off in class, Goldstone's first love was the military band. The school's primary sports field was named in his honour. *Sholto Erroll Lamond (staff 1911-1950, Vice-Principal 1924-1950): An Old Collegian, Lamond had a 48-year association with the school that started when he arrived at the school as an 11-year-old schoolboy in 1902. He was dux of College in 1908 and 1909, and, apart from a short break in 1926 at the Durban High School (which he memorably referred to as his 'locust years'), he taught at the school until 1950. He knew generations of schoolboys by name, and often amazed everyone by being able to give a detailed account of a boy's history at College. *Charles Carpenter (Vice-Principal 1926-1934): When Pape was appointed headmaster in 1925, he insisted that Carpenter be brought in as the Vice-Principal from the Durban High School to help him restore discipline. Most of the boys were terrified of both men, who were both infamously fond of the rod. As is memorably described in the school's official history, 'if they had been asked to describe him, most of his pupils might well have dubbed him 'The Iron Schoolmaster'... [The] boys avoided the main staircase leading up past his rooms, in much the same way as the footman probably avoided the precincts of Ivan the Terrible. An ill-advised cough uttered outside of Carpenter's den could lead to that gentleman asking the offender to step inside and sample one of the seven canes he kept in his study and Carpenter was not in the habit of wasting his time with less than six cuts.' *RW Kent (staff 1926-1957, Vice- Principal 1950-1957): An Englishman who had served in the trenches in World War I, Kent was known to generations of Collegians as 'Tiger'. Cricket and, to a lesser degree, athletics, were his great passions, and he coached the 1st XI (cricket) from 1927-1956, in that time producing five national and 26 provincial players, and 54 provincial schools' caps. The Kent Pavilion, which overlooks the school's main sports ground, was named in his honour.\\"Tribute to Mr Ronnie Kent\\" 1957, Maritzburg College Archives *Max Castle (staff 1946-1979, Vice-Principal): Castle had been a schoolboy at College under Septimus Pape. An excellent teacher, he was renowned for his explosive temper. According to a schoolboy legend, Max had sustained a war injury which required the fitting of a metal plate in his head. Hot weather, it was rumoured, caused this plate to expand with devastating consequences. *Zablon Kwela (staff 1948-1976, senior groundsman): Kwela was a legendary supporter of the school's First XV (rugby). He became a fixture at rugby games with his cries of 'Liya shoni langa, College!' ('The sun is setting, College!') and 'Ekhaya!' ('It's home-time!') echoing across the field. He certainly did not stint giving advice on the players and the game plan to the coach, Skonk Nicholson, and he was known to place the odd bet on the outcome of matches.Contents of a board in the school museum titled \\"College Characters\\", commissioned in September 2013 *Bryan 'Voerie' Bates (staff 1957-1979, Vice-Principal): An old boy of the school, Bates was a stickler for good manners. Any boy who failed to greet a staff member in the approved manner was likely to find himself spending his entire break outside the only entrance to the staff room raising his boater (known at the school as a 'basher') on high to every teacher who came past. *James Mervyn \\"Skonk\\" Nicholson (staff 1948-1982, Vice-Principal): A dedicated geography teacher - while being a DHS old boy - he was the 1st XV rugby coach for most of his tenure, coaching 14 unbeaten 1st XV sides and firmly establishing College as one of South Africa's premier rugby schools. School crest Badge of the Maritzburg College Old Boys' Association, which was founded in 1897 The school crest is a red shield with a crossed carbine and assegai (a traditional Zulu weapon), over the Latin scroll bearing ' (For Hearth and Home). The College colours of red, black and white were first introduced in 1891 by the captain of the school's football team, EJ Holgate. A short while later, Mr RD Clark instituted the school motto (derived from the Latin inscription he composed for the Colonial War Memorial, now in the foyer of Clark House) and the badge of carbine-and-assegai, both of which were initially connected more with the school's Old Boys' Association than the school. An ardent Victorian, Mr Clark was especially proud that 11 of his young school's sons had perished in the valiant colonial struggles 'for hearth and home' (the motto) ‚Äì hence the school's martial insignia too.Draft text for the new Maritzburg College Museum, July 2012, as composed by the Maritzburg College Archives (ref: M Marwick) Notably, 7 alumni had perished at the bloody Battle of Isandlwana, and one of the school's most prized artefacts is an assegai that had been retrieved from the battlefield in June 1879 and was presented to the school on Founder's Day 2018. Debate has taken place as to why Holgate chose the combination of red, black and white for the school's colours. A popular belief is that they highlight the various skirmishes, battles and wars between the British and the Zulu that took place in the late 19th century (especially Isandlwana), with the colours representing the warring parties (white and black) and the blood that was shed between them (red). Mr RD Clark (MA (Oxon)) ‚Äì 'the Father of Maritzburg College' Houses Although Maritzburg College had been a boarding school since its foundation in 1863, the school's system of sports Houses was only introduced in 1902. Initially, a system of four Houses was introduced, with a fifth House ‚Äì Nathan House ‚Äì being introduced in 1910. The old Houses were as follows: *Clark's, named after the third headmaster, RD Clark (headmaster 1879-1902) *Stalker's, named after Clark's long-serving senior assistant master, Rev John D Stalker (staff 1881-1902) *Langley's, named after Stalker's successor, AS 'Madevu' Langley (staff 1897-1909) *Oxland's, named after an early Games Master at the school, Mr W Oxland (staff 1901-1908) *Sir Matthew Nathan House ‚Äì or simply Nathan's ‚Äì after the last governor of Natal, Sir Matthew Nathan The old House system of five sporting Houses was replaced in 2014 with ten new so-called 'day' Houses, each of which meet every morning, have about 130 boys, and form the basis of the school's strong mentoring programme. The Houses are now as follows: *Calder's, named after the first headmaster, William Calder *Forder's, named after the second headmaster, James Forder *Barns', named after the fourth headmaster, Ernest Barns *Pape's, named after the fifth headmaster, Septimus Pape *Snow's, named after the sixth headmaster, John Snow *Fuller's, named after the eighth headmaster, Raymond Fuller *Commons', named after the ninth headmaster, Hector Commons *Lamond's, named after former Vice Principal, SE Lamond (staff 1911-1950) *Nicholson's, named after former Deputy Headmaster and distinguished rugby coach, JM Skonk Nicholson (staff 1944-1982) *Strachan's, named after former Deputy Headmaster, JR 'Cabbage' Strachan (staff 1952-1978)Records of the Maritzburg College Archives, September 2013 The annual inter-house competition between the 10 Houses sees them compete in over 25 academic, sports, cultural and community-based events for the Forder Cup for Champion House. The system of day or sporting Houses is not to be confused with the school's five boarding Houses. To begin with, the sporting and boarding Houses were linked, with the boarders being allocated to Clark's and Langley's sporting Houses (and later Nathan's), and the dayboys to Stalker's and Oxland's. However, since the headmastership of Mr Snow (headmaster 1937-1941), all boys have been allocated randomly to the sports Houses. Thus, a boarder in, say, the Clark House boarding establishment might these days find himself in Nicholson's day House. The school's five boarding Houses are: *Nathan House: opened in 1910 and the home of the school's approximately 100 grade 8 (Form 2) boarders *Clark House: home to about 120 boys in Forms 3-5 *Hudson House: opened in 1958 and home to about 155 boys in Forms 3-5 *Elliott House: opened in 1998 and home to about 65 Form 6 boarders (originally called College House until 2013) *Shepstone House: purchased from the Shepstone family on behalf of the school in 1919 and used for many years as the school's sanatorium and for staff housing. Since January 2018, the original old building has been used to house 30 grade 10 boarders, as well as staff and prefects, who from September of that year move into a newly built fifth boarding house.Records of the Maritzburg College Archives, April 2018 Academic standards The school employs 105 teachers on its academic staff - in addition to scores of administrative, estates, additional sports and other support staff. The subjects offered at grade 12 level include accounting, agricultural science, Afrikaans, business studies, dramatic arts, economics, English, geography, engineering & graphic design, history, information technology, life sciences, life orientation, mathematics, mathematical literacy, physical science, visual arts and Zulu.See p26 of the 2016 school magazine, as produced (Louch, T: editor) in September 2017. Despite its size and its customary prowess on the sports field, Maritzburg College's academic standards are traditionally strong. At the end of both 2016 and 2017 it was able to boast amongst the best results for a top tier school in the country. In 2016, all 275 of its grade 12 pupils passed the National Senior Certificate, with 95% achieving a university entrance qualification. Four of its boys were placed in the top 20 in the province and eight in the top 20 in the district, in which its matriculants attained the best marks in a number of subjects. The Class of 2017 achieved amongst the school's best results ever, with a 100% pass rate and record 97% of the candidates achieving a university entrance qualification, with H le Roux being placed second in the province.See //maritzburgcollege.co.za/nsc-results-2017-subject-final-confirmation/ Privileges, traditions and discipline One of the school's distinct features is its hierarchical system, which is underpinned by a long- established set of privileges and duties. The most well-known duties include 'team-testing' (the rote-learning of school teams etc. by juniors), 'running' (the carrying out of any errands by Form 2 boys for prefects), 'fagging' (a watered-down version of the old Victorian custom) and 'waiting-at-doors'. School traditions include the wearing by all boys of straw boaters (known as bashers), which are hurled into the air at First XV rugby matches, and the saying of the word 'please' at the end of sentences when a junior is addressing a more senior boy. Because of its possibly contentious nature, the hierarchical system of privileges that underpins the school's ethos is monitored by the school's traditions committee, which is made up of staff, alumni and senior prefects.\\"Form 2 Nathan House Privileges (Summary)\\", dated April 2018, as contained in the Maritzburg College Archives College's structure of traditions and concepts date back to similar styles found in traditional British boarding schools, and it is perhaps one of the few schools in South Africa where this structure is retained to something like its original extent. Sport The first inter-schools cricket and rugby matches were both played against the Deutsche Schule Hermannsburg, on 6 October 1870, with the old Pietermaritzburg High School (now Maritzburg College) winning both fixtures. The cricket match was played in the morning on the Camp Grounds and the rugby match was played in the afternoon on the Pietermaritzburg market square. Maritzburg College offers a wide variety of sports, including rugby, cricket, canoeing, hockey, athletics, swimming, water polo, tennis, shooting, football (soccer), basketball, cross-country, squash and golf.\\"Maritzburg College school magazine 2016, Louch, T (Ed.), Coloir Display Printers (Pty) Ltd, 2017 The school has fixtures against its rival schools. Records show College to be the strongest sporting school in the province in sports such as rugby, cricket, canoeing, polo, polocrosse and hockey. Boer War The school's search for greater sporting competition has taken it beyond the province's borders, and each year in winter it has derby days against Afrikaanse Ho√´r Seunskool (known as 'Affies'), Pretoria Boys High School and King Edward VII School (Johannesburg) (known as 'KES') in Gauteng, in which about 700 College boys take part. From 1944 until 1982, the school enjoyed the services of the noted geography master and schoolboy rugby coach, the late Mr Skonk Nicholson, whose name is iconic with Maritzburg College and schoolboy rugby, and who is well respected in the South African rugby community as having nurtured many Collegians to national and international sporting fame. In his 35 seasons in charge of the First XV (rugby), his teams established a playing record of Played 504, Won 403, Drew 49 and Lost 52.\\"Jimeloyo-Ji!

Notable Old Collegians=Introduction= Maritzburg College has produced many Old Boys who have distinguished themselves. Amongst its former scholars it can count 11 South African senators, seven generals, two admirals, a Commissioner of Police, eight Officers Commanding of the Natal Carbineers alone, arguably South Africa's pre-eminent English author, two Chancellors of the University of Natal, three Directors of Education, an Emmy Award-winning cameraman, two bishops, a winner of the Polar Medal, a Chief Justice, 10 judges (including a current member of the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein), three Attorneys-General, many Members of Parliament and successful businessmen, and 23 Rhodes scholars. As already mentioned, College has produced locally and internationally acclaimed sportsmen, with a tally of 273 international sportsmen to date, and as such is amongst the most produced by a single South African school. Amongst that number are a former Mr USA (bodybuilding), 31 SA captains, 2 overseas captains, 10 captains of polo alone, 6 2008 Olympians, 4 2012 Olympians, and the \\"man who won the 2005 Ashes\\" for England, Kevin Pietersen. The school's most recent international sportsmen include a trio of young hockey players - Tyson Dlungwana, Tevin Kok and Siyavuya Nolutshungu - a double-international swimmer/life-saver (Martin Binedell) and two cyclists (Brendan Davids and Bradley Potgieter), all of whom will be competing for South Africa at the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Jesse Kriel is a current member of the Springboks, Ryan Moon plays for the SA national soccer team Bafana Bafana, Don Armand enjoyed a second England rugby cap in March 2018, and 'master blaster' David Miller is a world record-holdingSee https://www.timeslive.co.za/sport/cricket/2017-10-29-miller-smashes-world- record-in-second-t20/ exponent of limited overs cricket. Another well-known sportsman produced by the school is Andy Birkett, who since he matriculated at the end of 2008 has emerged as one of the country's pre-eminent marathon canoeists, having won the Dusi Canoe Marathon 8 times in the last 9 years and formed one half of the pair who won the 2017 K2 world canoe marathon title. In addition to its 273 international sportsmen, a further 25 Old Collegians have officiated at an international level in sport - including Rugby World Cup rugby referee Craig Joubert, former Test (cricket) umpire Dave Orchard and current Ireland cricket coach Graham Ford. =Roll of Honour= The school's Roll of Honour lists the names of 261 former scholars (as at April 2018) who have given their lives in wars since the first Old Collegian casualty fell in 1873 (1863 foundation scholar, Trooper Robert Erskine, who was killed in a skirmish with the Hlubi at Bushman's River Pass).\\"Pro Patria, Another 50 Natal Carbineer Years 1945 to 1995\\", Coghlan, M, Teeanem Printers, 2000, at p5-6 All of their names are displayed on College's numerous war memorials and honours boards, including precisely 100 on the First World War Memorial in front of Clark House and 129 on the honours board in the school chapel that records the names of Old Collegians who died in the Second World War. The most Old Collegians killed in single actions are 11 at the Battle of Delville Wood from 14‚Äì20 July 1916 and seven at the famous Battle of Isandlwana (at which over 1,300 British and colonial troops were slaughtered by the Zulus during the Zulu War ‚Äì a memorial in honour of those fallen Old Boys was unveiled on the battlefield in 1969, on the 90th anniversary of that battle); and at Gelib in Italian Somaliland in 1941, during the infamous 'White Flag Incident' that claimed the lives of 13 Royal Natal Carbineers. A total of 27 alumni died at the Battle of the Somme, which was fought between July and December 1916.A detailed, well-researched Roll of Honour of the 97 alumni and staff members of the school killed in specifically World War I is maintained by the school's Archives. Old Collegians have also earned a considerable tally of decorations and awards, especially during the two World Wars ‚Äì the most recent award being the Distinguished Flying Cross awarded in 2012 to Fl Lt LD Flemington, RAF. =List of notable Old Collegians (selected) (by year of matriculation)=       * * 1952: Keith Oxlee, South African national rugby player         *2002: Peter Grant (rugby union), South African national rugby player *2003: Craig Burden, rugby player * *2006: Lunga Shabalala, Actor & TV presenter  * *  Notes ReferencesExternal links *Maritzburg College official site *Old Boys' Association official site Category:Boarding schools in South Africa Category:Schools in KwaZulu-Natal Category:Educational institutions established in 1863 Category:Boys' schools in South Africa Category:1863 establishments in the Colony of Natal ","title":"Maritzburg College"},{"id":"2295966","text":"Koronis Rift is a 1985 computer game from Lucasfilm Games. It was produced and designed by Noah Falstein. Originally developed for the Atari 8-bit family and the Commodore 64, Koronis Rift was ported to the Amstrad CPC, Apple II, MSX, Tandy Color Computer 3, and ZX Spectrum. The Atari and C64 version shipped on a flippy disk, with one version of the game on each side. A cassette version was also released for the Commodore 64. The Atari version required computers with the GTIA chip installed in order to display properly. Koronis Rift was one of two games in Lucasfilm Games' second wave (December 1985). The other was The Eidolon. Both enhanced the fractal technology developed for Rescue on Fractalus!. In Koronis Rift, the Atari 8-bit family's additional colors (over those of the Commodore 64) allowed the programmers to gradually fade in the background rather than it suddenly popping in as in Rescue, an early example of depth cueing in a computer game. Gameplay An enemy saucer and a hulk (Atari 8-Bit) The player controls a surface rover vehicle to enter several \\"rifts\\" on an alien planet which are effectively fractal mazes. A lost civilisation known as the Ancients has left strange machinery, so-called \\"hulks\\", within these rifts which are guarded by armed flying saucers of different design and color. Depending on their respective color, shields and gunshots of both the rover and the saucers are of varying effectiveness against each other; part of the game is figuring out which shield and weapon modules work best where. By means of a drone robot, the rover can retrieve modules with various functions (which are not immediately obvious) from nearby hulks. It can only be deployed when all attacking Guardian Saucers have been destroyed. The modules can then be installed in the rover, analyzed aboard the player's space ship, or sold; the rover can carry up to six different modules at a time which can be activated and de-activated as the player sees fit. A large variety of modules is available: Different weapon and shield modules with varying power levels and color codes, modules that increase the rover's power output, a mapper (activating an extra screen on the rover), and even one module that turns the retrieval probe into a bomb, destroying any hulks the probe is sent to investigate instead of retrieving modules. Conversely, different types of hulks exist including one that simply \\"swallows\\" the probe without yielding a module, requiring the player to purchase a new probe (and possibly sell useful modules to raise the required funds). The goal of the game is to find and destroy the saucer control base hulk which is located in the 20th rift. To this end, the player must explore the rifts, find hulks, retrieve and analyze modules and understand the color-coding of weapons and shields to overcome the increasingly aggressive and dangerous saucers. The game can be solved in several ways; the quickest is to acquire the bomb module and send the probe into the saucer base with the bomb module activated. Reception Info rated Koronis Rift four stars out of five, stating that it was the best of Epyx's four Lucasfilm games. Computer Gaming World stated that \\"if KR is a game, it is also a puzzle ... arcade skill alone isn't enough\\". The reviewer did not enjoy the game because it was so difficult that he spent too much time savescumming, but praised the graphics and sound. Zzap!64 thought that the game was an improvement on its predecessor, Rescue on Fractalus, with superior graphics and gameplay. It was given an overall rating of 96%.

Biography Freddie Richmond, as he was known, was the third son of Charles Gordon Lennox, 8th Duke of Richmond and Hilda Brassey. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. His interest in engineering started while he was at university and afterwards he was apprenticed to Bentley Motors. He began a motor racing career in 1929 when he took part in the JCC High Speed Trial. In the next year he became a member of the Austin team and won the Brooklands 500 Miles. He created his own team of MG Midgets in 1931 and won the Brooklands Double Twelve race, but then became more involved in the organisational side of motor sport. He inherited the Dukedoms in 1935, along with the Goodwood Estate and the racecourse. Death duties meant he had to sell the family interests in Scotland, including Gordon Castle, and settle on the Goodwood Estate near Chichester. He designed and flew his own aircraft and served with the Royal Air Force during World War II. For a time he was based in Washington, working for the Ministry of Aircraft Production. After the war he faced the task of rehabilitating Goodwood, and saw the potential for creating a motor racing circuit from the fighter station built at Goodwood during the Second World War. Horse racing was an important part of the Goodwood scene, but he did not share his ancestors' interest in the sport. The Goodwood Circuit became an important venue in motor racing. However, by 1966 the Duke was concerned at the increasing risks involved in motor racing and closed the circuit except for minor club activities and private testing. The Duke was the longest-serving Vice President of the Royal Automobile Club, with which he was associated since 1948. As early as the thirties, he was the motoring correspondent of the Sunday Referee, and became the Founder President of the Guild of Motoring Writers. The Duke appeared on the 14 December 1958 episode of the American version of What's My Line?.http://www.tv.com/whats-my- line/episode-444/episode/96038/summary.html?tag=ep_guide;ep_title;14 Marriage and children He married Elizabeth Grace Hudson (1900‚Äì1992) on 15 December 1927.

Identification Identification of orange-billed terns within their range is straightforward. Crested and Cayenne terns (which do not overlap in range) can be identified by their bill colour. Of the truly orange-billed species, the only geographical overlaps are between royal and lesser crested, and between royal and elegant Terns, and in both cases the larger size and strong bill of royal tern should prevent misidentifications (in addition, lesser crested terns have a grey, not white, rump). Identification of vagrants has proved to be much more difficult however, with known hybridisation, and birds which do not match the classic character sets of individual species.

Paul Getty Trust included in the Getty Vocabulary Program. The TGN includes names and associated information about places. Places in TGN include administrative political entities (e.g., cities, nations) and physical features (e.g., mountains, rivers). Current and historical places are included. Other information related to history, population, culture, art and architecture is included. The resource is available to museums, art libraries, archives, visual resource collection catalogers, bibliographic projects through private license or available to members of the general public for free on the Getty Vocabulary website (see external links). The Getty vocabulary databases (Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), Union List of Artist Names (ULAN), and TGN) are produced and maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program. They are compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction. They contain terms, names, and other information about people, places, things, and concepts relating to art, architecture, and material culture. The Getty vocabularies can be used in three ways: at the data entry stage, by catalogers or indexers who are describing works of art, architecture, material culture, archival materials, visual surrogates, or bibliographic materials; as knowledge bases, providing information for researchers; and as search assistants to enhance end-user access to online resources. History Work on the TGN began in 1987, when the Getty created a department dedicated to compiling and distributing terminology, at that time called the Vocabulary Coordination Group. The AAT was already being managed by the Getty at that time, and the Getty attempted to respond to requests from the creators of art information for additional controlled vocabularies for artists' names (ULAN) and geographic names (TGN). The development of TGN was informed by an international study completed by the Thesaurus Artis Universalis (TAU), a working group of the Comit√© International d'Histoire de l'Art (CIHA), and by the consensus reached at a colloquium held in 1991, attended by the spectrum of potential users of geographic vocabulary in cataloging and scholarship of art and architectural history and archaeology. The initial core of the TGN was compiled from thousands of geographic names in use by various Getty cataloging and indexing projects, enlarged by information from U. S. government databases, and further enhanced by the manual entry of information from published hard-copy sources. The TGN grows and changes via contributions from the user community and editorial work of the Getty Vocabulary Program. The basic principles under which the TGN is constructed and maintained were established by the Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) and also employed for the Union List of Artist Names (ULAN): Its scope includes terminology needed to catalog and retrieve information about the visual arts and architecture; it is constructed using national and international standards for thesaurus construction; it comprises a hierarchy with tree structures corresponding to the current and historical worlds; it is based on terminology that is current, warranted for use by authoritative literary sources, and validated by use in the scholarly art and architectural history community; and it is compiled and edited in response to the needs of the user community. TGN was founded under the management of Eleanor Fink (head of what was then called the Vocabulary Coordination Group, and subsequently Director of the Art History Information Program, later called the Getty Information Institute). TGN has been constructed over the years by numerous members of the user community and an army of dedicated editors, under the supervision of several managers. Technical support for the TGN was provided by the Getty. TGN was first published in 1997 in machine-readable files. Given the growing size and frequency of changes and additions to the TGN, hard-copy publication was deemed to be impractical. It is currently published in both a searchable online Web interface and in data files available for licensing. The data for the TGN is compiled and edited in an editorial system that was custom-built by Getty technical staff to meet the unique requirements of compiling data from many contributors, building complex and changing polyhierarchies, merging, moving, and publishing in various formats. Final editorial control of the TGN is maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program, using well-established editorial rules. The current managers of the TGN are Patricia Harpring, Managing Editor, and Murtha Baca, Head, Vocabulary Program and Digital Resource Management. TGN is available as Linked Open Datahttp://vocab.getty.edu since August 2014. Terms TGN is a structured vocabulary currently containing around 1,106,000 names and other information about places. Names for a place may include names in the vernacular language, English, other languages, historical names, names and in natural order and inverted order. Among these names, one is flagged as the preferred name. TGN is a thesaurus, compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction; it contains hierarchical, equivalence, and associative relationships. Note that TGN is not a GIS (Geographic Information System). While many records in TGN include coordinates, these coordinates are approximate and are intended for reference only. The focus of each TGN record is a place. There are around 912,000 places in the TGN. In the database, each place record (also called a subject) is identified by a unique numeric ID. Linked to the record for the place are names, the place's parent or position in the hierarchy, other relationships, geographic coordinates, notes, sources for the data, and place types, which are terms describing the role of the place (e.g., inhabited place and state capital). The temporal coverage of the TGN ranges from prehistory to the present and the scope is global. Design The TGN is a faceted classification system as well as a poly-hierarchical one. There are two facets: World and Extraterrestrial. Within the World facet are Physical Features and Political Entities. One can view administrative places from as broad as continents and regions to as specific as neighborhoods, boroughs, towns, and cities. Within the Physical Features facets are mountain ranges, oceans, seas, rivers, waterfalls, island groups, and deserts.

Notice the hesitation in the gender of the epithet of the scientific names, as they are usually masculine (albostriatus, leucopterus or niger), but in the case of the whiskered tern is mostly used as feminine (hybrida), maybe from the influence of the previous gender used, Sterna. The black-bellied tern (Sterna acuticauda) and the white- cheeked tern (Sterna repressa) might also be placed in Chlidonias.

He previously played for England. Voyce married Anna Wood in September 2015. Biography Born 5 January 1981 in Truro, Cornwall. Voyce's great uncle, Anthony Thomas Voyce, won 27 caps for England, while playing for Gloucester Rugby, during the 1920s and was a member of the first double Grand Slam winning team. He went on to become President of the RFU in 1960‚Äì61. Voyce was educated at Penair School, Truro and then studied at King's College, Taunton.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/club/3005149/Voyce- confident-of-making-a-big-noise.html Retrieved 11 January 2011 Outside the rugby field, Voyce is an Ambassador of the Wooden Spoon Society. Career He first showed promise playing mini rugby at Penryn RFC in his native Cornwall, before going on to play for Truro RFC U15s and U16s. =Bath 1997‚Äì2003= Having left Cornwall at 16, he eventually joined Bath where he worked his way through the club's lower sides and into the Zurich Premiership line up. At the same time he established himself in the England Under 21 side. He was selected for England's 2001 tour to North America, where he won his first cap against the USA. =Wasps 2003‚Äì2009= In 2003 he moved to London, to join Wasps for the 2003‚Äì04 season and quickly established himself as a first team regular. He played in 34 of his club's 35 matches that season, scoring 15 tries in the process. At the end of the season Wasps won the Premiership final against his former club Bath. He also helped Wasps win the Heineken Cup that season. In November 2004 he scored the quickest try in Premiership history when he gathered a loose ball from kick off and crossed by the posts in 9.63 seconds against Harlequins, beating Martin Corry's record by 14 seconds. Voyce was in the starting line up for the 2004 England summer tour matches against New Zealand in Auckland and Australia in Brisbane. He helped Wasps win their third consecutive Premiership title in 2005, this time scoring a try in the final against Leicester. In 2005 he marked his first Twickenham Test appearance with two tries against Samoa. Voyce was selected for every match of the 2006 Six Nations Championship. Initially selected for the bench in England's opener against Wales, Voyce quickly found himself on the pitch replacing injured Josh Lewsey, also scoring a try in the process. This injury meant that Voyce secured the number 15 jersey for the next game against Italy. However, Lewsey was soon fit again in time for the 3rd game, which meant that Voyce was once again relegated to the bench. After losing two games in a row, changes were made to the England squad meaning England regular Lewsey was dropped, opening up the fullback position for Voyce to start against Ireland. Later that year, he played his last international to date against Australia, in Sydney. His performance in such game was ‚Äì according to himself ‚Äì quite poor, and this might have jeopardised his international career. Voyce won his second Heineken Cup with Wasps in 2007. =Gloucester 2009‚Äì2012= In March 2009, it was announced that he would join Gloucester Rugby from the 2009‚Äì10 season. April 2012, departure from Gloucester announced. =London Welsh 2012‚Äì2013= In October 2012, he joined London Welsh.

SMS Friedrich der Grosse (or Gro√üe ) was an ironclad turret ship built for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy). She was the second of three s, in addition to her two sister-ships and . Named for Frederick the Great, she was laid down at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel in 1871 and completed in 1877. Her main battery of four guns was mounted pair of twin gun turrets amidships. Friedrich der Grosse served with the fleet from her commissioning until 1896, though she was frequently placed in reserve throughout her career. The ship was a regular participant in the annual fleet training maneuvers conducted with the exception of the mid-1880s, when she was temporarily replaced by newer vessels. She participated in several cruises in the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas, often escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II on official state visits. The ship was removed from active service in 1896, after which she was used in secondary roles until 1919, when she was stricken from the naval register and sold to a scrapyard. Friedrich der Grosse was broken up for scrap the following year.  Design  Line-drawing of Friedrich der Grosse The three Preussen-class ironclads were authorized under the naval program of 1867, which had been approved by the to strengthen the North German Federal Navy in the wake of the Second Schleswig War, when the weak, then-Prussian Navy had been unable to break the blockade imposed by the Danish Navy. Initially ordered as casemate ships, the vessels were re-designed as turret ships; they were the first uniform class of ironclads built by for the German fleet. Friedrich der Grosse was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. Friedrich der Grosse was powered by one 3-cylinder single expansion steam engine, which was supplied with steam by six coal-fired transverse trunk boilers. The ship's top speed was , at . She was also equipped with a full ship rig. Her standard complement consisted of 46 officers and 454 enlisted men. She was armed with four L/22 guns mounted in a pair of gun turrets placed amidships. As built, the ship was also equipped with two L/25 chase guns. After being rebuilt in 1888‚Äì1890, her armament was increased by six and later ten L/30 quick-firing guns, a pair of machine guns, and five torpedo tubes, all placed in the ship's hull below the waterline. Friedrich der Grosses armor was made of wrought iron and backed with teak. The armored belt was arrayed in two strakes. The upper strake was thick; the lower strake ranged in thickness from . Both were backed with of teak. The gun turrets were protected by armor on the sides, backed by 260 mm of teak.  Service history =Construction ‚Äì 1881= Friedrich der Grosse under construction Friedrich der Grosse was ordered by the Imperial Navy from the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel; her keel was laid in 1871 under construction number 1. The ship was launched on 20 September 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 22 November 1877. Although laid down a year before her sister , Friedrich der Grosse was not completed until a year after; this was because she was built at a newly established and inexperienced Imperial Dockyard, while Preussen was built by AG Vulcan, an experienced private shipbuilder. The ship cost the German government 7,303,000 gold marks. After her commissioning in November 1877, Friedrich der Grosse served with the fleet. In April 1878, Friedrich der Grosse was reactivated to participate in the annual summer fleet maneuvers, under the command of Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral} Carl Ferdinand Batsch. Her newly commissioned sister-ship, , joined the squadron shortly before maneuvers were scheduled to begin. At the time, Friedrich der Grosse suffered from mechanical problems, and on 22 May, she ran aground off Nyborg while steaming from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven. The ship suffered serious damage to her hull, which, coupled with her chronic engine problems, forced her to miss the fleet maneuvers. While the squadron steamed in the English Channel on 31 May, the armored frigate accidentally rammed Grosser Kurf√ºrst; the latter quickly sank with the loss of 276 men. In the aftermath of the loss of Grosser Kurf√ºrst, the Navy canceled the summer 1878 maneuvers. Apart from the small ironclad , all armored warships were put in reserve until the following year. In May 1879, the armored squadron was reactivated, under the command of Konteradmiral Franz Kinderling. Friedrich der Grosse and Preussen were joined by the older ironclads and ; the squadron remained in the Baltic for the majority of the training period. Kinderling took his four ships out into the North Sea in June for a visit to Norway. The four ships returned to Kiel in September, when the squadron was disbanded for the winter. In the spring of 1880, the squadron was again reestablished. The new armored corvette replaced Kronprinz in the squadron that year. Wilhelm von Wickede, a former Austrian naval officer, replaced Kinderling as the squadron commander. In June, the Italian screw corvette visited the armored squadron in Kiel. Again, the squadron remained in the Baltic for the summer cruise, with the exception of a short visit to Wilhelmshaven and Cuxhaven in August. The summer cruise in 1881 followed the same pattern as the year previous, though Kronprinz returned in place of Sachsen, which was plagued with engine problems. Wickede again served as the commander. In July, the ships hosted a visit by the British reserve squadron, which by this time included the first British ironclad, . Preussen and the rest of the squadron visited Danzig in September during a meeting between Kaiser Wilhelm I and the Russian Tsar Alexander III. =1882‚Äì1919= Illustration of the fleet conducting maneuvers, including Friedrich der Grosse and several other ironclads and other vessels The 1882 summer cruise included the same four ironclads from the previous year, and was again commanded by Wickede, who had by then been promoted to Konteradmiral. Friedrich der Grosse was kept in reserve during the annual summer maneuvers starting in 1883, as new ships, including the rest of the s entered service. From 1883 to 1885, the ship underwent a modernization that included new boilers and a reconstructed poop deck. Two Hotchkiss guns and five torpedo tubes were added in above-water mounts. The ship was reactivated in July 1888 to participate in a tour of the Baltic for the newly enthroned Kaiser Wilhelm II. The voyage included visits to St. Petersburg, Stockholm, and Copenhagen. They met Tsar Alexander III and the Swedish King Oscar II, who inspected the German warships and conferred decorations on the senior officers. In August 1889, Friedrich der Grosse participated in Kaiser Wilhelm II's visit to Great Britain. The ship was assigned to II Division, along with her sister Preussen and the central battery ironclads and , under command of Konteradmiral Friedrich Hollmann. The fleet then conducted maneuvers in the North Sea before returning to Germany. Friedrich der Grosse and the rest of II Division became the training squadron for the fleet in 1889‚Äì1890, the first year the Kaiserliche Marine maintained a year-round ironclad force. The squadron escorted Wilhelm II's imperial yacht to the Mediterranean; the voyage included state visits to Italy and the Ottoman Empire. The squadron remained in the Mediterranean until April 1890, when it returned to Germany. Friedrich der Grosse participated in the ceremonial transfer of the island of Helgoland from British to German control in the summer of 1890. She was present during the fleet maneuvers in September, where the entire eight-ship armored squadron simulated a Russian fleet blockading Kiel. II Division, including Friedrich der Grosse, served as the training squadron in the winter of 1890‚Äì1891. The squadron again cruised the Mediterranean, under the command of Konteradmiral Wilhelm Schr√∂der. Friedrich der Grosse again saw service in II Division in the winter of 1891‚Äì1892 and the 1892 maneuvers, under the command of Konteradmiral Hans von Koester. The ship participated in the 1893 maneuvers, which included a simulation of a French naval attack in the North Sea. The following year, Friedrich der Grosse, K√∂nig Wilhelm, and Deutschland joined the new battleship as re-designated II Division of the Maneuver Squadron, under the command of Konteradmiral Otto von Diederichs. The ships simulated a Russian attack on Germany's Baltic coast in the 1894 maneuvers. She was reduced to a harbor ship on 16 November 1896. The ship was stricken from the active register on 21 May 1906, after which she was used as a coal hulk for torpedo boats. Friedrich der Grosse served in this capacity until after the end of World War I; she was removed from the naval register on 27 January 1919. She was sold to shipbreakers and broken up for scrap the following year in R√∂nnebeck.

It was directed by Mike Mitchell, and written by Paul Hernandez, and Kim Possible creators, Robert Schooley, and Mark McCorkle. The film stars Michael Angarano, Danielle Panabaker, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Kelly Preston and Kurt Russell. It tells the story about the son of two superheroes who is enrolled in a superhero school where his powers kick in. Plot Will Stronghold begins ninth grade at Sky High, a high school that exclusively teaches teenagers with superpowers. Will's parents are The Commander and Jetstream, two of the world's most famous superheroes. Will's best friend, Layla Williams, who happens to have a crush on him, has the power to manipulate plant life. Will is anxious about attending Sky High, located on a floating campus reached by a flying school bus, because, unbeknownst to his parents, he has not developed any super powers. On the first day, he and the other ninth graders are harassed by a duo of bullies: Speed, a burly senior with super speed, and Lash, a skinny senior with extreme flexibility . Because of his lack of powers, Will is assigned to a curriculum for \\"Hero Support\\" (i.e. a sidekick) by Coach Boomer. His classmates include Ethan, who melts into a fluid; Zach, who glows in the dark; Magenta, who transforms into a guinea pig; and Layla, who joins the class in protest of the two-track nature of the school's education system. The class is taught by The Commander's former sidekick, \\"All American Boy\\". Will learns from Nurse Spex that not everybody gets powers, and there are rare cases of those who have both parents with superpowers but do not inherit any superpowers, such as the bus driver, Ron Wilson. The Commander is unaware that his son has been relegated to Hero Support and shows Will his hidden trophy room, which he calls his \\"secret sanctum\\". He is particularly proud of the mysterious weapon, \\"The Pacifier\\", which he took from his science-themed nemesis Royal Pain years ago. Unknown to the two, Royal Pain, who has been presumed dead, watches them from a hidden camera in one of the other trophies, alongside a maniacal sidekick named Stitches. As Will settles into Sky High and makes friends with the other sidekicks, he comes into conflict with pyrokinetic student Warren Peace, whose supervillain father was imprisoned by The Commander. During a fight between the two, Will eventually manifests super strength, impressing Gwen Grayson, a beautiful and popular technopath who controls machines with her mind. Will is subsequently transferred to the \\"Hero\\" track, and inevitably becomes popular and unable to hang out with his Hero Support friends. Gwen visits the Stronghold's house and asks Will's parents to attend the Homecoming Dance to accept an award for Superhero of the Year, which they accept. Later on, while walking to her house, Gwen asks Will out to Homecoming and, to his delight, becomes his girlfriend. Will then begins spending more time with Gwen and her clique of friends, ignoring the sidekicks and Layla, who reveals to Warren that she has loved Will for a long time. On the night before the dance, Gwen tricks Will into throwing a party at his house and has Speed steal the Pacifier, which goes unseen by Will when he takes her into the Secret Sanctum. After Gwen lies to Layla, who shows up to investigate the noise and believes the lie, Will breaks up with Gwen, refusing to attend the dance, even though his parents were invited as honored guests. Later, he looks through his father's old yearbook and sees a student who resembles Gwen holding the Pacifier, which he subsequently discovers has gone missing. Believing that the student, Sue Tenny, was Royal Pain, and that Gwen is her daughter, he rushes to the dance. At the dance party, Gwen reveals that she is in fact Royal Pain herself. During her previous confrontation with the Commander, the Pacifier, which is meant to turn its target into an infant, malfunctioned, turning her into a baby instead, inadvertently faking her alleged death. Raised by Stitches, she has since waited 17 years for revenge. With the help of Stitches, Speed, Lash, and Penny, Royal Pain takes over the school, uses the Pacifier to turn Will's parents, the faculty, and students into babies, and plans to start a supervillain academy and raise the infants as supervillains as revenge for being written off as a sidekick in her youth. After returning to school, Will apologizes to Layla and teams up with Warren, the sidekicks, and Ron Wilson to save the day. The sidekicks demonstrate their heroism after Royal Pain sabotages the school's anti-gravity drive and their powers come in handy restarting it. Meanwhile, Will discovers that he has Jetstream's powers of flight when he is thrown off the edge of the school grounds and prevents the campus from falling using his two abilities. Royal Pain and her henchmen are defeated and imprisoned in the detention halls. Will's parents, the faculty, and students are returned to their proper ages. His parents thank all of the sidekicks and admit they are true heroes. Will and Layla kiss, and a voiceover by Will at the end reveals that Ron Wilson gained superhuman powers after falling into a vat of toxic waste, thus becoming a superhero, he and Layla have become a couple, he and Warren became best friends, he and Gwen (who along with the other bullies went to prison) became archenemies. Will states that this was indeed a weird series of events, ending the film by saying, \\"but hey; that's high school\\".

Production Oviatt Library at CSU Northridge Exterior shots of the Sky High school were filmed at the Oviatt Library at California State University in Northridge. In between working on the first and second seasons of the animated series Kim Possible, creators Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle had begun writing a script for a live-action adaptation, which ultimately never came to fruition due to unknown reasons. Impressed with their work, the filmmakers asked them to look into re-writing the script for Sky High, which had been previously shelved. McCorkle believes they were recruited for Sky High because \\"they liked the idea of a superhero high school. I think, reading how we wrote teens in Kim Possible, they felt like, 'This feels good and contemporary, and maybe you can apply that to this project for us.' Similar to Kim Possible, Schooley and McCorkle wrote Sky High to be equally appealing to both children and adults. According to scifi.com, Disney was attracted by the \\"original concept\\" of \\"children of superheroes going to high school\\", originally conceived by screenwriter Paul Hernandez in the 1990s. After recruiting comedy writers (creators of Kim Possible) for polishing Hernandez's script (they only wrote the beginning and ending sequences) Disney hired several comedians such as Kevin McDonald, Dave Foley, and Kevin Heffernan for supporting roles. For the main roles, the casting was a mix of established and new teenager actors: while Michael Angarano and Mary Elizabeth Winstead were already successful, Danielle Panabaker was little-known and Steven Strait (a former model) was hired after his first audition ever. Director Mike Mitchell said that Sky High functions on two premises: \\"the adults are all insane\\" and \\"the girls are smarter than the boys\\":Sky High DVD extras Therefore, all the adults portrayed in the film tend to be caricatured, while the teenage girls are written as more assertive and powerful than the boys. For the treatment of the teenage actors, Mitchell also stated that the actors all had their own trailer and were generally kept separated, because \\"we did not want them to date after the second week and break up after the fourth\\", which would have made filming difficult. Mitchell, a science fiction fan, admitted that this project \\"was a dream\\", because it brought him together with four of his favorite SF cult heroes: namely Wonder Woman (popularized in the eponymous 1970s television series by actress Lynda Carter), Snake Plissken (portrayed by Kurt Russell), Ash Williams (from Evil Dead, played by Bruce Campbell) and Cloris Leachman, who earned fame as Frau Bl√ºcher in Young Frankenstein; and worked with Lynda Carter before in the pilot movie episode for the Wonder Woman TV Series playing Hippolyta opposite Lynda Carter who played Wonder Woman herself. Reception= Box office = On an estimated budget of US$ 35 million, the film grossed just under $64 million in the US, and another $22 million internationally, bringing the total to $86 million. =Critical response= Sky High received generally favorable reviews from critics who praised the film's story, themes, writing, Mitchell's direction, and the performances of Angarano, Russell, Panabaker, Winstead and Strait. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 73% based on reviews from 131 critics, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The site's critical consensus states: \\"This highly derivative superhero coming-of-age flick is moderately entertaining, family-friendly fluff.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 62 based on reviews from 29 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A- on a scale of A+ to F. Joe Leydon of Variety magazine praised the film calling it: \\"Smartly written and sprightly played, ‚ÄúSky High‚Äù satisfies with a clever commingling of spoofy superheroics, school-daze hijinks\\" and \\"this lively live-action Disney release stands on its own merits as a tongue-in-cheek fantasy with cross-generational appeal.\\" Neil Smith at BBC.com wrote: \\"While originality is hardly the film's strongest suit, its agreeable mix of knowing spoof and kid-pleasing fantasy makes it considerably more engaging than some of the 'straight' superhero blockbusters we've suffered recently.\\" Soundtrack The Sky High Original Soundtrack was released by Hollywood Records on July 26, 2005, and is composed of covers of songs from the 1980s (with the exception of \\"Just What I Needed\\", which was from 1978, despite most of the songs are from the '80s). While none of Michael Giacchino's score was included on the song album, a limited edition of his score was issued by Intrada Records in 2017.http://store.intrada.com/s.nl/it.A/id.10676/.f ; Track listing # \\"I Melt with You\\" ‚Äì Bowling for Soup (Originally by: Modern English) - 4:03 # \\"Through Being Cool\\" ‚Äì They Might Be Giants (Originally by: Devo) - 3:17 # \\"Save It for Later\\" ‚Äì Flashlight Brown (Originally by: The Beat) - 2:49 # \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" ‚Äì Christian Burns (Originally by: Tears for Fears) - 4:28 # \\"One Thing Leads to Another\\" ‚Äì Steven Strait (Originally by: The Fixx) - 3:10 # \\"Lies\\" ‚Äì The Click Five (Originally by: Thompson Twins) - 2:58 # \\"Voices Carry\\" ‚Äì Vitamin C (Originally by: 'Til Tuesday) - 4:16 # \\"Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want\\" ‚Äì Elefant (Originally by: The Smiths) - 2:53 # \\"True\\" ‚Äì Cary Brothers (Originally by: Spandau Ballet) - 5:11 # \\"Just What I Needed\\" ‚Äì Caleigh Peters (Originally by: The Cars) - 3:38 # \\"Can't Stop the World\\" ‚Äì Ginger Sling (Originally by: The Go-Go's) - 3:25 # \\"And She Was\\" ‚Äì Keaton Simons (Originally by: Talking Heads) - 3:49 # \\"Twist and Crawl\\" ‚Äì Skindred (Originally by: The Beat) - 2:31 =Reception= AllMusic rated the album 2.5/5, saying that it \\"stumbles more than it succeeds\\" and is \\"painfully conventional.\\" Home media The film was released in separate widescreen and full screen format editions on DVD on November 29, 2005.

In January 2019, Mike Mitchell revealed about earlier plans to make a franchise, but due to the film's box-office performance, nothing came to be. A sequel to the film would have been called Save U (as in Save University) and would have featured the characters graduating high school and attending college. There were also plans to make a TV series. Everyone, except for Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston, had signed on to return, but there are no new developments for TV series.

Politically, the island is in Clay Township of St. Clair County History The island was named for its first Euro-American settler, Jacob Harsen (sometimes referred to as \\"James\\") , who was a descendant of people from various ethnicities who populated New Amsterdam, including Dutch, Huguenot French, and Walloon on his father‚Äôs side ; his mother was Dutch and French . He was a direct descendant of David Pieterse Schuyler of the New York Schuyler family and Wolfert Gerritse van Couwenhoven. Harsen migrated from Albany, New York in about 1779, during the American Revolutionary War, with his daughter and son-in-law Isaac Gerrit Graveraet (or Graveret). Harsen bought the island from the local Native Americans in 1783. It was also known as \\"Jacob Island\\" (also James or Jacobus Island) as late as 1809. The name of the post office, Sans Souci, was changed to \\"Harsens Island\\" in 1960. Great Britain and the United States disputed the island's jurisdiction for many years. The 1783 Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War, described the international boundary line with imprecise terms in several places, including the mouth of the St. Clair River. The area had not been surveyed at that time. In the most commonly known map of the area from that period, made by John Mitchell in 1755 and which was used in negotiating the treaty, the delta and all the islands at the mouth of the St. Clair River are absent. According to the 1783 treaty, the boundary line was to run through the middle of Lake Erie until it arrives at the water communication between that lake and Lake Huron, \\"thence along the middle of said water communication into the Lake Huron\\". Due to this vagueness, all of the delta islands, including Harsens and Dickinson, were claimed by the British. Some persons located in the new United States who did not want to renounce their status as British subjects following the war moved to make their residences there. The area was administered by the Hesse District of Upper Canada, which also awarded land grants in the islands. In 1809, surveyors for the British government placed the boundary line in the north channel, which placed all of the delta and islands under British control. But, the 1814 Treaty of Ghent, which ended the War of 1812, acknowledged the ambiguity of provisions in the 1783 treaty: > And, whereas, doubts have arisen, what was the middle of the said river, > lakes, and water communication, and whether certain islands lying in the > same were within the dominions of his Britannic majesty, or of the United > States.\\" To decide these questions, two commissioners were to be appointed, > one from each nation, to designate the international boundary. They executed > their survey of the Detroit River, Lake St. Clair, and the St. Clair River > in 1819 and 1820; and issued their final conclusions on June 18, 1822. Their > decision regarding the St. Clair River delta was that the boundary should > run north through Lake St. Clair, entering \\"that mouth or channel of the > River St. Clair which is usually denominated the Old Ship Channel; thence > along the middle of said channel, between Squirrel Island on the southeast, > and Herson's Island on the northwest, to the upper end of the last mentioned > island, which is nearly opposite to Point aux Chenes, on the American shore; > thence along the middle of the River St. Clair, keeping to the west of, and > near, the islands called Belle Riviere Isle, and Isle aux Cerfs, to Lake > Huron. By this definition, both Harsens and Dickinson islands were placed on the U.S. side of the boundary. In 1870 a case arose involving Hiram Little of Wallaceburg, Ontario, a captain who was given a contract to provide cord wood and supplies to a work crew. At the time, a ship canal was being dredged through the marshy areas near Lake St. Clair. By this time shipping was increasing and the need for a deep, free-flowing canal was required. During one trip to the work area, Capt. Little's ship was seized by U.S. officials who claimed he was operating illegally since he was in U.S. waters. Little protested, claiming he was in Canadian water, and challenged U.S. officials to prove their contention. After searching of documents, including contact with the Crown in England who supplied early charts of the area, Capt. Little was ultimately proven correct. To avoid further embarrassment, the U.S. officials moved the international boundary east, further infringing on Canadian (and First Nations) land. The present St. Clair River, from Russel Island to Lake St. Clair, has been the international boundary line between Canada and the United States ever since. Some observers still disagree as to which nation should legally \\"own\\" Harsen's Island and the St. Clair delta area. The Walpole Island First Nation claims that Harsen's Island is unceded territory and properly belongs to them.Walpole Island Heritage Centre - About nin.da.waab.jig Harsens Island is the only U.S. island in the Flats that can be reached by automobile ferry, and is the only one with roads and an unincorporated community, Sans Souci. The island community had a public school, which has closed and been replaced by a restaurant. Other tourist attractions include shops, an art gallery, and a small airport. All the other U.S. islands--there are scores of them--are accessible only by boat. Geography The St. Clair River is an integral part of the Great Lakes, draining water from Lake Huron down into Lake St. Clair. Lake St. Clair then empties into the Detroit River, which flows into Lake Erie. The delta was formed about 6,000 years ago and long was a desired area of habitation by indigenous peoples. The St. Clair River is the international boundary between the United States and Canada. The river carries more freighter traffic than the Suez and Panama Canals combined. Over of fresh water per day flow down the St. Clair River, and through its delta region, the St. Clair Flats. Harsens Island is the major U.S. island in the Flats. The Canadian side of the Flats has the largest islands in the delta, including Walpole Island, which are among six islands controlled by the Walpole Island First Nation, made up of Ojibwa, Potawatomi, and Odawa peoples.Bkejwanong - Walpole Island First Nation, Ken Sands, personal website The St. Clair Flats supports a range of wildlife, such as the great blue heron, snapping turtles, watersnakes, muskrats, mink, whitetail deer, pintail, canvasback and mallard ducks, Canada geese and red-winged blackbirds. The area is a popular fishing spot, as yellow perch, large and small mouth bass, rock bass, carp, sunfish, pumpkinseed fish, bluegills, and silver bass are available. The State of Michigan owns about 75% of the area of Harsen's Island, and manages waterfowl and wildlife sanctuaries throughout. Sources * Michael Dixon Books. Life at the Flats * Michael Dixon Books.

The game featured the sponsorship of the Reebok Pump shoe. Summary In the game the player controls the infamous Count Dracula who, while wearing Reebok Pumps, has to first work his way down his castle while avoiding the hostile villagers. This could be accomplished by hypnotizing the villagers with his vampiric gaze, or by pulling a lever to spring one of many Rube Goldberg-esque hidden traps. Once villagers are subdued, Dracula can then suck their blood and briefly turn into a bat to navigate through the tower. Scattered throughout these towers are also Reebok Pump power-ups. Once activated, Dracula is given a temporary speed-boost, as well as the ability to jump over villagers and holes. When Dracula escapes the castle, he is given a large open town to explore and search for his bride, Mina. This will require hints such as finding maps and compasses from villagers. Patrolling the streets are hostile mobs and non-hostile villagers. After sucking enough blood, Dracula temporarily transforms into an invulnerable wolf to cover distance more quickly. Dracula is also given the ability to suck the blood of sleeping villagers that will transform into Vampiresses and lead Dracula nearer to Mina's location. Some villagers drop items like keys and flowers, used to open gates and homes. Dracula can also travel through secret underground shortcuts. Once the player discovers the building housing Mina, a congratulatory picture of the pair walking together appears and leads to the next 'round'. Development Although completed, the game was never officially released. However, a prototype has since been discovered and its ROM data released to the internet. Elaborate NES cart reproductions now exist for collectors as well. Mark Lesser on the Reebok Pump addition: \\"We developed this game as consultants to Parker Brothers. As we neared completion of the game, PB insisted that we include Reebok as a sponsor of the game by having Dracula wear Reebok Pump shoes! Reluctantly we complied, but the sponsorship was not enough to save the game and, although completed, it was never marketed.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Mark Lesser Interview *GameFAQs Category:Cancelled Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System-only games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Parker Brothers video games Category:Video games based on Dracula Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Drac's Night Out"},{"id":"2296079","text":"Arms of Esm√© Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox, 1st Earl of Lennox: Quarterly of 4, 1&4: Arms awarded in 1427 by King Charles VII of France to Sir John Stewart of Darnley, 1st Seigneur d'Aubigny, 1st Seigneur de Concressault and 1st Comte d'√âvreux, Constable of the Scottish Army in France:Cust, Lady Elizabeth, Some Account of the Stuarts of Aubigny, in France, London, 1891, pp.12-14 Royal arms of France within a bordure of Bonkyll, for the arms of the de Bonkyll family of Bonkyll Castle in Scotland (whose canting arms were three buckles),Johnston, G.

Despite his conversion to Calvinism he was never trusted by the Scots and returned to France where he ended his days. Sir James Melville described him as \\"of nature upright, just and gentle\\". He was the first to popularise the firstname Esm√© (spelled also Edme,Gaspard Thaumas de la Thaumassiere, Histoire de Berry, Paris, 1689, pp.697-702 etc, he signed his name as \\"Amy\\",G. E. Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, n.s., vol.7, p.604, note (a) meaning \\"beloved\\" (aim√©)) in the British Isles. Early life He was the son and heir of John Stewart, 5th Seigneur d'Aubigny (d. 1567) by his wife Anne de la Queuille, a French noblewoman. His father was the third son of John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox and his mother was the youngest daughter, and co- heiress, of Francois, Fran√ßois de la Queuille. His father had inherited (through adoption from his great uncle Sir Robert Stewart, 4th Seigneur d'Aubigny (‚Äì1544), the French Seigneurie (lordship of the manor) of Aubigny and its estates, including the Ch√¢teau d'Aubigny at Aubigny-sur-N√®re in the ancient province of Berry, central France, built by him, also the nearby secondary seat of Ch√¢teau de la Verrerie. Career He spent much of his life in France and succeeded his father as 6th Seigneur d'Aubigny on 31 May 1567. At the age of 37 he came to Scotland, where he was introduced to his first cousin once removed, the 13-year-old James VI of Scotland, when the latter made his formal entry into Edinburgh and began his personal rule. Esm√© was an exotic visitor who fascinated the young James, who began to shower him with rewards and preferments.A Dictionary of British History, ed. John Ashton Cannon, (Oxford, 2009) He was appointed to the Privy Council of Scotland, and on 5 March 1580, he was created Lords Darnley, Aubigny and Dalkeith, Earl of Lennox (which title having been inherited by King James from his paternal grandfather had merged into the crown), with remainder to the heirs male of his body failing which to revert to the King. On 5 August 1581, he was created Lord Aubigny, Dalkeith, Torboltoun and Aberdour, Earl of Darnley and Duke of Lennox, with a similar remainder, as well as other favours. James VI gave him jewels that remained from the collection of Mary, Queen of Scots, including in June 1581 a gold belt or chain of knots of pearls and diamonds,David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1578-1585, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1880), p. 392. and in October 1581 a gold cross with diamonds and rubies, the \\"Great Harry\\" or \\"Great H of Scotland\\", a chain of rubies and diamonds, with a diamond \\"carcan\\" necklace with roses of gold and a pair of matching hair garnishings, another suite of carcan and back and fore hair garnishings, and other pieces. The gift was witnessed by Elizabeth Stewart, Countess of Arran, and officials of the wardrobe.Thomas Thomson, Collection of Inventories (Edinburgh, 1815), pp. 306-8. During his rise he was careful to maintain his popularity with the Burgh administrators of Scotland's towns. For example in July 1580 the English diplomat Robert Bowes reported that Lennox had obtained fishing rights in Aberdeen, which the deposed Regent Morton had given to his servant George Auchinleck of Balmanno, and had then arranged for the King to give this valuable source of income to the town.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 461, no. 536. In Presbyterian Scotland, the thought of a Catholic duke irked many, and Lennox had to make a choice between his Catholic faith and his loyalty to the king. Lennox chose the latter, who taught him the doctrines of Calvinism. Nevertheless the Church of Scotland remained suspicious of Lennox after his public conversion and took alarm when he had the Earl of Morton tried and beheaded on charges of treason. =Ruthven Raid and exile= In response the Scottish nobles plotted to oust Lennox. They did so by luring James to Ruthven Castle as a guest where they kept him as prisoner for ten months. The Lord Enterprisers then forced James to banish Lennox. A lengthy denunciation of Lennox was issued from Stirling Castle on 17 September 1582, citing his religion, association with the murderers of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley (King James's father) and Regent Moray and Regent Lennox and his control over the royal household and international intrigue.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1910), pp. 171-174. Lennox stayed for a while at Dumbarton Castle. In December whilst travelling south from Berwick on Tweed, by chance near Northallerton he encountered the French ambassador, M. de la Mothe F√©nelon, who was travelling northward to treat with the Gowrie Regime. In London the Scottish poet William Fowler pumped Lennox for information which he sent to Francis Walsingham.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1910), pp. 235, 240-3, 256-7, 262-3, 265-6. =Return to France= Lennox returned to France where he started a secret correspondence with King James. He met a frosty reception in France as an apostate. Although the Scottish nobles believed that they would be proved right in their belief that Lennox's conversion was artificial following his return France, he remained a Presbyterian. His final letter to James Stewart, Lord Doune, requested him to take care of his son and to recover his former possessions in Scotland for his benefit.HMC 6th Report: Earl of Moray (London, 1877), p. 637, (Letter dated Paris NS, 4 June 1583). William Schaw took his heart back to King James in Scotland, followed by his wife and eldest son Ludovic Stewart. King James had repeatedly vouched for Lennox's religious sincerity and memorialized him in a poem called \\"Ane Tragedie of the Phoenix\\", which compared him to an exotic bird of unique beauty killed by envy. King James I regarded all Lennox's family with great affection, and instructed his son King Charles I to do well by them. Charles faithfully fulfilled this obligation, and as a result the Lennox family had considerable influence at the Scottish and English Courts over the next two generations. Personal life Around 1572, Lennox married his mother's fourth cousin, Catherine de Balsac (d. ), the ninth daughter of Guillaume de Balsac, Sieur d'Entragues, by his wife Louise d'Humi√®res. By Catherine he had five children: * Lady Gabrielle Stewart, a nun in Glatigny, France. * Lady Henrietta Stewart (‚Äì1642), who married George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly and had issue. * Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox (1574‚Äì1624), eldest son and heir who married three times. * Esm√© Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox (1579‚Äì1624), second son, heir to his elder brother. * Lady Marie Stewart (‚Äì1644) (Countess of Mar), who married John Erskine, Earl of Mar (1558‚Äì1634) and had issue. Lennox died in Paris on 26 May 1583 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Ludovic (who married three times without legitimate issue). His widow outlived Lennox by many years and spent her later life at the family estate at Aubigny, where she was entrusted with the upbringing of their grandchildren, before she died sometime after 1630.

A shootout, also called a firefight or gunfight, is a gun battle between armed groups. A shootout often, but not necessarily, pits law enforcement against criminal elements; it could also involve two groups outside of law enforcement, such as rival gangs. A shootout in a war-like context (i.e. regularly constituted armed forces or even guerrilla or insurgent forces) would usually be considered a battle (depending on size), rather than a shootout. Shootouts are often portrayed in action films and Western films. Notable shootouts in the United States and territories=Jesse James Northfield bank robbery= September 7, 1876.

In an attempt to free his brother, imprisoned Black Panther leader George Jackson, 17-year-old Jonathan Jackson entered a courthouse in Marin County, California with an arsenal of weapons. After storming into a room where a trial was taking place, Jackson armed defendant James McClain, who was on trial for murdering a prison guard, and two fellow convicts who were participating in the trial as witnesses, William Christmas and Ruchell Magee. The four armed men then took the judge, a district attorney and three jurors hostage, and marched them out of the courthouse into a waiting getaway van. As they attempted to flee the scene, a shootout broke out between the hostage takers and Marin County Sheriffs deputies providing security at the courthouse. By the end of the gun battle, Jonathan Jackson, McClain, Christmas, and judge Harold Haley were killed. According to the other hostages, Haley was executed by the hostage takers with a shotgun that had been taped to his throat. Magee was severely injured, but survived the battle and was sentenced to life in prison. One juror and the D.A. were also wounded. One of the weapons used by Jackson was later traced to Black Panther icon Angela Davis, who was later tried (but acquitted) for participation in the crime. It was later alleged by a Marin General Hospital doctor that Judge Haley was being treated for a brain tumor and should have been recused from trying cases for health reasons.

The first book featuring him was published in 1946. Lindgren's detective story is about Bill Bergson, a more-or-less ordinary Swedish boy with an extraordinary fascination with detective work. He lives in the small town Lillk√∂ping. He identifies clues, investigates enigmas, and solves the riddle surrounding a mysterious stranger while the police and other adults overlook or dismiss the whole matter. He and his friends several times solve real crimes including murder and kidnapping. Lindgren wrote shorthand for Harry S√∂derman, a doctor in Criminology, and it was during this work that she learned the basics of criminology that she later used in her stories. Bill and his friends also play a game they call the Wars of the Roses. He, along with his two friends Anders and Eva-Lotta, are the White Rose, while three other kids, Sixten, Jonte and Benka, are the Red Rose. They \\"fight\\" over the possession of Stormumriken, an oddly-shaped stone. The group that doesn't have the stone must use all their wits and energy to obtain it. The group that has the stone must give the other group clues on where to find it. Although there is a \\"war\\" between the two roses all six of the youngsters are good friends and there is simply a playful rivalry between them. The Red Roses help the Whites when they are threatened by real dangers.

Lisbeth Salander's name appears to be taken from Eva-Lotta Lisander, and is modeled in most other respect on Lindgren's other famous character, Pippi Longstocking. In The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, three of Lindgren's books are mentioned: The Children of Noisy Village, Bill Bergson and the White Rose Rescue (although in the book the translation was Kalle Blomkvist and Rasmus from the original Kalle Blomkvist och Rasmus), and Pippi Longstocking. The relation between Astrid Lindgren and, at least, the first part of the Trilogy, can be taken farther when the fact that, in it, a cat is named 'Tjorven', is considered. The name comes from the Swedish television series Vi p√• Saltkr√•kan based on a script by Astrid Lindgren and not originally a book. Apart from this, the TV show dates from the early sixties, around the time when, in Stieg Larsson's novel, one of the crucial events which shapes the story takes place.

Edmonds. It won the Newbery Medal for excellence as the most distinguished contribution to American children's literature in 1942. Synopsis The book is set in the year 1756 during the French and Indian War in Guilderland, New York. Ten-year- old Edward Van Alstyne (throughout the book, he is called \\"Ateoord\\", which is his name in Dutch) and his mother Gertrude are determined to protect their home and family with an ancient (and much too heavy) Spanish matchlock gun that Edward's great-grandfather had brought from Bergen Op Zoom in the Netherlands while his father Teunis is away from home with the local militia fighting the enemy (using, to Edward's disappointment, a musket instead of the matchlock). Gertrude, Edward, and his younger sister Trudy go about their everyday chores, but news arrives that the French-Indian forces have been attacking and burning nearby settlements and that Teunis and his militia company have been sent to intercept them. Later that day, while she and the children are out herding the cows, Gertrude spots a column of smoke in the distance and realizes that raiders are getting closer. Rather than take herself and the children over to her mother-in-law's brick house as Teunis had previously suggested, since raiders would be more likely to attack it rather than their house, she devises a plan for a possible Indian attack. Returning home, she loads the matchlock gun, fixes it in position to fire and instructs Edward how and when to fire it. She then goes outside to keep a watch for any approaching raiders. At the book's climax, Gertrude sees flames in the distance and realizes that her mother-in-law's house has indeed been attacked. Moments later, she spots five Indians approaching in the darkness, bent on burning the house. Barely able to outrun them, she reaches the front porch and manages to shout a pre-arranged warning to Edward, but is wounded in the shoulder by a thrown tomahawk, and the boy fires the gun through the front window, killing three raiders and driving off the remaining two (one of them, apparently wounded, is later killed by the returning militia). As their house burns, Edward and Trudy manage to drag their unconscious mother to safety. Edward goes back into the burning house to save the Spanish gun, and later he, Trudy and their mother are found by their father and the other militiamen.

History  Ujigami Shrine in Uji The ujigami is thought to have been believed in only since the eighth century. In its current form, the term ujigami is used to describe several other types of Shinto deities. Originally, the term ujigami referred to a family god. It is believed that, at first, these deities were worshiped at temporary altars. After the Heian period, the Japanese manorial system was established and nobles, warriors and temples had their own private land, the family-based society fell out of use, and belief in ujigami diminished. In turn, the lords of the manors began to pray to the deities to protect their land. These guardian deities were referred to as . In the Muromachi period the manorial system declined, and so the guardian deities were enshrined along with the ujigami. An is a god of the land of one's birth. Over time, the ubusunagami and chinju came to be seen as the heart of the community, and were eventually referred to as ujigami. The term is used to describe a person who worships an ujigami.

Based on the Catalan vault, he created the Guastavino tile, a \\"Tile Arch System\\", patented in the United States in 1885, which was used for constructing robust, self- supporting arches and architectural vaults using interlocking terracotta tiles and layers of mortar. His work appears in numerous prominent projects designed by major architectural firms in New York and other cities of the Northeast. Guastavino tile is found in some of New York's most prominent Beaux-Arts landmarks and in major buildings across the United States. It is also used in numerous architecturally important and famous buildings with vaulted spaces. Guastavino Fireproof Construction Company Guastavino tile vaulting at the Grand Central Oyster Bar & Restaurant In 1881 Guastavino came to New York City from Valencia, with his youngest son, nine-year-old Rafael III. In Spain he had been an accomplished architect and was a contemporary of Antoni Gaud√≠. In the March 7, 1885 article entitled \\"The Dakota Apartment House\\", printed in The Real Estate Record and Builders Guide, Guastavino was identified as the contractor in charge of \\"fireproof construction\\" of the luxury apartment building, which was completed in 1884. Though not specified, the work may very well have included the groined vault entries on the south side on West 72nd Street, and the north side on West 73rd Street, as well as the construction of the subterranean basement, and the 3-foot thick arched floors between the basement and attic levels. Guastavino was commissioned by the firm of McKim, Mead, and White for their Boston Public Library (1889), which increased his reputation with every major architect on the East Coast. His published drawings of interior decoration of the Spanish Renaissance style caught the eye of an architect, who asked him to submit a design for the planned New York Progress Club building. After forming a partnership with William Blodgett, Guastavino eventually was offered a construction position in 1890 with George W. Vanderbilt to construct arches for the new mansion, Biltmore at Asheville, North Carolina. After working on the estate, Guastavino decided to build his own retirement home in the mountains of Black Mountain, North Carolina in a 500-acre valley. His property, Rhododendron, also had a vineyard, dairy, brick kiln, and more. This property currently is owned by Christmount Assembly, the conference center for the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). The property holds artifacts that may be visited, including the kiln and chimney, a wine cellar, beautiful old stone walls, and many smaller structures that have been rediscovered as modern buildings have been constructed there. St. Francis de Sales Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia Guastavino and his son also developed twenty-four products that were awarded patents. Their company, Guastavino Fireproof Construction Company, run by the father and then by his son, was incorporated in 1889. It executed its final contract in 1962. Akoustolith was one of several trade names used by Guastavino. Hundreds of major building projects incorporate the distinctive Tile Arch System. In Chicago, the central nave vaulting of Rockefeller Chapel at the University of Chicago uses 100,000 Guastavino tiles. In Boston, Guastavino tiles are found in the Boston Public Library; in New York City, in the Grand Central Terminal, Grant's Tomb, Carnegie Hall, the American Museum of Natural History, Congregation Emanu-El of New York, and St. Bartolomew's Episcopal Church; and in Washington, D.C. in the U.S. Supreme Court building and the National Museum of Natural History on the National Mall. Guastavino tiles form the domes of Philadelphia's St. Francis de Sales Roman Catholic Church. At Pittsburgh's Union Station, the vaulting of the carriage turnaround is a Guastavino tile system. In Nebraska, the tiles may be seen in the Nebraska State Capitol. =Work in New York City= Bridgemarket, under Queensboro Bridge In 1900, New York architects Heins & LaFarge hired Guastavino to help construct City Hall station, the underground showpiece for the IRT, the first part of the then-new New York City Subway. The station, although elegant, was never convenient or popular, as it was superseded by nearby stops with connections to Brooklyn. After the city closed it in 1945 because needed upgrades were too expensive, it became a legendary abandoned Manhattan underground relic. Subway buffs and urban spelunkers knew about it. Guastavino also installed the ceiling of the south arcade of the Manhattan Municipal Building, which was constructed during 1907-1914. The Guastavinos had entered New York as immigrants via Ellis Island. In 1917 the younger Rafael Guastavino III was commissioned to rebuild the ceiling of the Ellis Island Great Hall. The Guastavinos set 28,832 tiles into a self-supporting interlocking -high ceiling grid so durable and strong that during the restoration project of the 1980s, as many sources repeat, only seventeen of those tiles needed replacing. The largest dome created by the Guastavino Company was over the central crossing for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan: it is in diameter and high. This dome was intended to be a temporary structure, to be replaced by a high central tower. In 2009 this \\"temporary\\" fix celebrated the 100th anniversary of its construction. Guastavino received this contract due to the much lower price he could quote because his system served as its own scaffolding. This was an extreme test of his system, however. The masons had to work from above, each day adding a few rows of tiles, and standing on the previous day's work to make progress. At the edges, many layers of tile were laid, and the dome thins as it rises toward the center. As building engineer Few structures designed and built by Guastavino alone have been identified. He was responsible for a series of surviving rowhouses with unusual Mooresque features on West 78th Street (121‚Äì131 known as the \\"red and whites\\"), on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Another of his structures, now used as an event space called Guastavino's, is located under the Midtown Manhattan end of the Queensboro Bridge.Guastavino Facebook page, retrieved 2010-11-21 His son Rafael's Mediterranean villa (1912), built entirely of Guastavino tiles, still stands on Awixa Avenue, in Bay Shore, Long Island. Retirement in North Carolina Basilica of St. Lawrence, and final resting place of Rafael Guastavino in Asheville, North Carolina. After working on a commission at the Biltmore Estate, Guastavino retired to Black Mountain. The site of his estate is now used as Christmount, the conference and retreat center of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Ruins of the original Guastavino Estate still stand, and a collection of Guastavino memorabilia is held in the Christmount library. The Rafael Guastavino, Sr., Estate was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. In North Carolina Guastavino completed a number of projects: his work is found in Duke Chapel in Durham, the Jefferson Standard Building in Greensboro, the Motley Memorial in Chapel Hill, and Basilica Shrine of St. Mary in Wilmington. He is buried in the crypt of the Basilica of St. Lawrence, Asheville, which he designed in 1905.

It is located within the boundaries of the constellation of Aquarius. It is a member of the Local Group of galaxies, albeit an extremely isolated one; it is one of only a few known Local Group members for which a past close approach to the Milky Way or Andromeda Galaxy can be ruled out, based on its current location and velocity. Local Group membership was firmly established only in 1999, with the derivation of a distance based on the tip of the red-giant branch method. Its distance from the Milky Way of 3.2 ¬±0.2 Mly (980 ¬±40 kpc) means that Aquarius Dwarf is quite isolated in space. It is one of the least luminous Local Group galaxies to contain significant amounts of neutral hydrogen and support to ongoing star formation, although it does so only at an extremely low level. Because of its large distance, the Hubble Space Telescope is required in order to study its stellar populations in detail. RR Lyrae stars have been discovered in Aquarius Dwarf, indicating the existence of stars more than 10 billion years old, but the majority of its stars are much younger (median age 6.8 billion years). Among Local Group galaxies, only Leo A has a younger mean age, leading to the suggestion that delayed star formation could be correlated with galaxy isolation.

It spans False Creek and is 27.4 metres above Granville Island. It is part of Highway 99. History=First bridge 1889= The original bridge was completed in 1889. It was a 732-metre long low timber trestle. The navigation span, near the north end, was a trussed timber swing span, tied with wire ropes to a central wooden tower. It was largely designed by the CPR, and cost $16,000. In 1891 the bridge was widened on both sides for streetcar tracks, except where the tracks converged for the swing span. =Second bridge 1909= The second bridge was completed in 1909. It was a longer, medium-level steel bridge with a through truss swing span. =Third bridge 1954= On February 4, 1954, the current Granville Street Bridge, costing $16.5 million, opened. A million cars would cross over the bridge in its first month. The city of Vancouver funded the bridge itself as Mayor Frederick Hume said \\"no formal assistance given by any other government body.\\" The eight-lane structure was constructed on the same alignment as the first bridge while steel plate girders salvaged from the second bridge made barges for constructing the foundations of the Oak Street Bridge. The first \\"civilian\\" to drive over the 1954 bridge was the same woman who was first to drive over the second bridge in 1909. She had been widowed between the two openings, and so had a different name. Both times she was at the wheel of a brand-new Cadillac. Recent improvements to the bridge include increasing its earthquake resistance, and installing higher curbs and median barriers. Today In December 2017, Vancouver City Council approved a plan to remove the \\"Granville Loops\\" - a pair of cloverleaf off-ramps connecting the bridge with Pacific Street - and open up the land to redevelopment. Since late 2018, the Granville Street bridge has being undergoing seismic retrofitting that will be completed in early 2021. In January 2019, Vancouver City Council announced a plan to improve pedestrian and cyclist access to the bridge from the surrounding neighbourhoods by creating a new separated bike and walking path located in the centre of the bridge roadway. The plan was opened up for public comment in April 2019.

In 1937, he fought national welterweight champions before large crowds in Australia and Germany. In 1940, he was listed as the world's top welterweight contender by some sources.\\"Joe Louis's Foes are Belittled\\", Arizona Republic, Phoenix, Arizona, pg. 47, 25 December 1940 His managers were Guy Anselmi and Chris Dundee. Early life and career Isadoro Jannazzo was born on January 31, 1915 in Ensley, Alabama to poor Sicilian Italian parents Francesca and Anthony Jannazzo. He would become part of a family of six, which included a sister Bernice and brothers Vincent and Sam and would live in his hometown until roughly the age of seventeen. He may have boxed in as many as one hundred amateur bouts, and once contended for a state bantamweight championship around the age of fourteen. After his family's move to New York around 1932, his mother died, causing him to shoulder additional financial responsibility for the support of his family. In 1941, Izzy married Francesca \\"Frances\\" Tombrello, who was five years his junior. Francesca's family, who had also lived in Ensley, Alabama, where she was born, had been friends of his family for many years. Francesca and her family moved to New York shortly after his. Izzy and his wife would settle on Troutman Street in Brooklyn, New York, in attached buildings near other family members. Fighting in the New York City area, primarily Brooklyn or the Bronx between December 6, 1932, and January 13, 1934, he won nine of nineteen fights, losing six and drawing three times. He was not considered a power hitter yet won 65 of 126 bouts, though scoring only 8 knockouts. =Important early career wins= On April 21, 1934, he defeated Murray Brandt in a six-round points decision at Ridgewood Grove in Brooklyn. He had formerly lost to Brandt in a six-round decision. On May 31, 1934, he defeated Stanislaus Loayza in a six-round points decision at Fort Hamilton Arena in Brooklyn, New York. Stanislaus would contend for the NYSE World Lightweight Title in July 1935 against Jimmy Goodrich and was well known in his native Chile. On November 17, 1934, he defeated Joe Rossi at the Ridgewood Grove in Brooklyn, New York in a six-round points decision. Rossi was another well rated New York welterweight who had previously beaten Jannazzo in six rounds on September 30, 1933 in Brooklyn. He would draw with Rossi in a six-round Brooklyn bout shortly after. On January 7, 1935, he defeated Tony Falco at the St. Nicholas Arena in New York in a ten-round points decision. Jannazzo, with a reach advantage landed effective rights in the first, had an even second, and fought fiercely and evenly in the third and fourth. Jannazzo took the fifth with clean rights to the body and face while eluding Falco. Falco took the sixth using both hands, but Jannazzo may have taken the eighth with two stiff rights to the head of Falco near the end of the round. Jannazzo may have taken the ninth with lefts to the face of Falco, though the tenth was even with both boxers too exhausted to land stiff blows.\\"Jannazzo Defeats Falco in Roundup\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, pg. 17, 6 January 1935 At 145 pounds, Jannazzo fought Jackie Davis twice on January 26, and February 16, in eight round points decisions at Ridgewood Grove in Brooklyn, losing the first, but winning the second. Jannazzo had roughly a four-pound weight advantage in each bout. =Defeating Kid Azteca and Steve Halaiko= On March 2, 1935, he lost to Kid Azteca at the Arena Nacional in Mexico City in a ten-round points decision. In 1936, Azteca, Mexico City born, would take and hold the Mexican Welterweight title and fight in five separate decades in his native land. On May 4, 1936, Jannazzo, at 145 1/2, scored a small upset defeating top NYSE welterweight contender Billy Celebron at the St. Nicholas Arena in New York in a ten-round points decision. According to the United Press, Celebron won only three rounds with the fourth and seventh even.\\"Izzy Jannazzo Whips Celebron\\", The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 29, 5 May 1936 On July 6, 1936, fighting at 145 1/2, he knocked out Steve Halaiko in the fourth of six rounds at the Dexter Park arena in Queens.\\"Squared Circle\\", The Decatur Daily Review, Decatur, Illinois, pg. 8, 7 July 1936 Win over former Light Welterweight Champion Johnny Jadick, draw with Ceferino Garcia At 145 1/4 pounds, on July 22, 1936, he defeated former champion Johnny Jadick, in a ten-round points decision at the Dykman Oval in Manhattan. In a decisive win, Jannazzo put Jadick on the canvas in the first, fourth and sixth rounds.Jadick was down three times in \\"Jannazzo Wins Nod in Scrap\\", Arizona Republic, Phoenix, Arizona, pg. 11, 23 July 1936 The fight was a benefit for the United Palestine Appeal.\\"Jannazo Wins Ten-Round Bout\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 21, 23 July 1936 Jadick had previously taken the World Light Welterweight Championship on March 18, 1932 against Tony Canzoneri. On October 30, 1936, he fought an important fifteen-round draw with Ceferino Garcia before a crowd of 5640 at New York's Madison Square Garden. In a fairly close bout, the Associated Press gave eight rounds to Garcia, six to Jannazzo, and one even. Jannazzo, a powerful hitter who had once floored Barney Ross, was thrown off in his attack by the scientific defense of Jannazzo, who was able to throw Garcia off balance from his attacks with his jabbing. Garcia scored the fight's only knockdown in the eighth for a count of one with a strong right. In the seventh through the fifteenth, both boxers changed the pace from the more cautious early rounds, and unleashed continuous punches. Garcia lost two of the first three rounds from penalties for low punches, and narrowly lost the other, but won most all of the remaining rounds through the ninth with a more aggressive display. The tenth through the twelfth went to Jannazzo who effectively used jabs to Garcia's head, interfering with his punching.\\"Title Contenders Stage Battle to Draw\\", Reno Gazette-Journal, Reno, Nevada, pg. 13, 31 October 1936 Garcia would take the World Middleweight Championship in 1939. NYSE World Welterweight Title bout against Barney Ross, November 1936 Barney Ross On November 27, 1936, he faced the incomparable triple division champion Barney Ross before 8,484 spectators in a NYSE recognized World Welterweight Championship at Madison Square Garden, losing in a fifteen-round unanimous decision. There were few serious knockdowns in the bout, a credit to Jannazzo, though Ross may have taken as many as nine rounds, clearly starting out with an edge in the first two.\\"Ross Fails to Impress While Trimming Izzy\\", The Times, Hammond, Indiana, pg. 51, 28 November 1936 Jannazzo was knocked down only briefly in the second and the fifth, for counts of one, and two, both from rights from Ross, though he likely slipped backing away in the fifth. The Associated Press had Ross with ten of the fifteen rounds, with four to Janazzo and one even.\\"Ross Beats Izzy Jannazzo\\", Des Moines Register, Des Moines, Iowa, 28 November 1936, pg. 7 Janazzo showed pluck lasting fifteen rounds with Ross, even scoring with hard right crosses in the seventh, eighth, and tenth, though the outcome of the bout was never strongly in doubt.\\"Barney Ross Defeats New Yorker\\", Warren Times Mirror, Warren, Pennsylvania, pg. 8, 28 November 1936 On June 18, 1937, he defeated Phoenix welterweight Freddie Dixon in a ten-round points decision at the Municipal Stadium in Phoenix, Arizona. Boxing in Sydney, Australia, and Hamburg, Germany, December 1937‚Äì38 On December 21, 1937, and January 25, 1938, he fought Jack Carroll and Dick Humphries in Sydney, Australia, losing both bouts in ten round points decisions. The bout with Carroll, Australian Welterweight Champion, brought an enthused capacity crowd of 30,000, likely the largest crowd of Jannazzo's career. Jannazzo was badly pummeled by Carroll's blows to both body and head, but never tired in the bout, and attempted to return counterpunches after each encounter. The bout was described as one of Carroll's best.\\"Carroll's Greatest Bout\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, pg. 17, 22 December 1937 \\"Jack Carroll Wins from Izzy Jannazzo\\", The Winnipeg Tribune gave Carroll nine of the ten rounds.Winnipeg Tribune, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, pg. 19, 21 December 1937 On October 15, 1938, he fought a fifteen-round draw with Gustav Eder, German Welterweight Champion, at Hanseaten Hall in Hamburg, Germany. The bout was close, with Jannazzo scoring with fast lefts through the first seven rounds, but Eder scoring with rights to the head and body in the subsequent rounds. The decision was unpopular with the enthusiastic home crowd of 10,000, among whom may felt Jannazzo had shown more science in the boxing and landed the more telling blows.\\"Izzy Jannazzo Fights to Draw\\", Arizona Republic, Phoenix, Arizona, pg. 31, 16 October 1938Home crowd actually favored Jannazzo at the end in \\"German Crowd Thinks American Outpointed Eder\\", St. Louis Post- Dispatch, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 12, 16 October 1938 In a previous match in New York in September 1936 with Eder, Jannazzo had won a fifteen-round points decision. On February 7, 1940, he defeated Jackie Burke in a ten-round points decision at the Watres Armory in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Jannazzo battered Burke with both hands throughout the bout.\\"Jannazzo Wins Bout\\", Arizona Republic, Phoenix, Arizona, pg. 49, 6 February 1940 On April 10, 1940, he defeated Steve Mamakos at Riverside Stadium in Washington, D.

In that year, Holman was rated seventh in the world among welterweights. He would become a boxer of some renown, taking the World Colored Middleweight Championship on October 16, 1942 against Charley Burley in New Orleans, Louisiana. Holman would lose the title to the \\"Cocoa Kid\\". Williams had previously beaten Jannazzo on March 27, 1940 in Scranton, Pennsylvania in a ten-round points decision. Williams, fighting at 150 in their March meeting, won from clever infighting in the later rounds, when Jannazzo may have tired from his strong opening rounds.\\"Ring and Mat\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 18, 28 March 1940 Taking the Welterweight Championship of the World (Maryland version), October 1940 He won the Welterweight Championship of the World (as recognized by Maryland state), fighting at 147 pounds against the Puerto Rican boxer \\"Cocoa Kid\\" on October 14, 1940 in a close fifteen round split decision before 3,000 fans at Carlin's Park in Baltimore, Maryland. Jannazzo took the bout using a strong left jab, and effective footwork that left him out of the range of his Puerto Rican challenger. The \\"Kid\\", who fought with a four-pound disadvantage, repeatedly tried to take the fight to Jannazzo but was stopped by Jannazzo's ever present left jab.\\"Jannazzo Wins Maryland Welter Title\\", Dunkirk Evening Observer, Dunkirk, New York, pg. 12, 15 October 1940 Jack Dempsey refereed the bout. Loss to future middleweight champion Georgie Abrams, December 1940 On December 12, 1940, Jannazzo lost to Georgie Abrams in a ten-round split decision at Carlin's Park in Baltimore. Though leading in the first two rounds, Jannazzo lost the third, being called for a low blow. In the late rounds, a strong attack by Abrams gave him the decision. Abrams dominated the infighting, but Jannazzo put on a more scientific and cautious defense.\\"Abrams Defeats Izzy Jannazzo\\", Arizona Republic, Phoenix, Arizona, pg. 64, 13 December 1940 Fighting at 145 1/2, on April 14, 1941, he defended the Maryland version of the World Welterweight Championship against Jimmy Leto in a fifteen-round split decision at the Coliseum in Baltimore, Maryland. Leto was a rated welterweight, and the victory was a significant one. Jannazzo once again used his strong left to win the bout, though the decision was somewhat disputed as the referee voted against Jannazzo, while both judges voted in his favor.\\"Ray Robinson Flattens\\", Democrat and Chronicle, Rochester, New York, pg. 21, 15 April 1941 On September 21, 1942, in a lead-up to his fight with Sugar Ray Robinon, Jannazzo defeated Portuguese born Freddie Cabral in a ten- round points decision at the Valley Arena, in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Bouts with Sugar Ray Robinson, October 1942 and March 1946 On October 19, 1942, he lost to the great Sugar Ray Robinson for the first time at the arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in a ten-round unanimous decision. Immediately after on December 1, 1942, he fought a return bout with Robinson at the Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, losing in an eighth round Technical Knockout. He defeated \\"Wild\\" Bill McDowell of Dallas on June 17, 1943 in a ten-round points decision at Moers Field in Richmond, Virginia. McDowell was unable to use his left hand for seven rounds, after injuring his right in the third. McDowell had a ten- pound advantage over Jannazzo who weighed in at 149 1/2 pounds. It was a noteworthy win considering the disadvantages with which Jannazzo fought. On May 9, 1944, he defeated Johnny Green at Memorial Auditorium before 3,893 fans in Buffalo, New York in a ten-round unanimous decision. Jannazzo, fighting at 152, won the bout with a well placed left, which he was unable to use to equal advantage in previous bouts with Green.\\"Jannazzo Whips Green in Buffalo\\", Democrat and Chronicle, Rochester, New York, pg. 21, 10 May 1944 Green had defeated and drawn with Jannazzo the previous February at the same venue in Buffalo. Green was a black boxer from Buffalo who fought several of the same opponents as Jannazzo. He defeated Charley Parham twice in July and September 1945 at the Auditorium in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Jannazzo took the September bout by a unanimous decision with Parham winning only one round, but their July bout was somewhat closer. Jannuzzo had \\"little trouble\\", however, in scoring the decision in their second meeting.\\"Easy for Jannazzo\\", Des Moines, Register, Des Moines, Iowa, pg. 12, 7 September 1945 On November 16, 1945, he defeated Frankie Abrams before 3000 fans in a ten-round unanimous decision at Olympia Stadium in Detroit. Jannazzo took every round but the last, when Abrams made a late rally. Abrams scored four knockdowns in the second round, showing his dominance.\\"Jannazzo Whips Abrams\\", The Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 8, 17 November 1945 On March 14, 1946, he fought champion Sugar Ray Robinson for the last time in Baltimore, Maryland, losing in a ten-round unanimous decision before a somewhat disappointing crowd of 4100. All three judges voted for Robinson. Jannazzo at 154, was outboxed by Robinson throughout the fight, and Robinson won every round.\\"Robinson Wins Over Jannazzo\\", The Des Moines Register, Des Moines, Iowa, pg. 13, 15 March 1946 He had formerly fought Robinson on October 13, 1944 in Boston Garden before a crowd of 7,347, losing in a second-round technical knockout. Robinson had returned to the ring after fourteen months in the army, but had no trouble dropping Jannazzo twice in the second with well placed lefts and rights to the head, before asking the referee to end the fight.\\"Sugar Robinson Returns to Ring\\", Reno Gazette-Journal, Reno, Nevada, pg. 12, 14 October 1944 On June 17, 1946, fighting at 151 3/4, he defeated Ralph Zannelli at the Rhode Island Auditorium in a ten-round points decision.\\"New Italian Star Opposes Yvon\\", The Ottawa Journal, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, pg. 17, 18 June 1946 Fighting at 155 pounds on June 5, 1946, he defeated Joe Governale in a ten-round split decision at McArthur Stadium in Brooklyn, New York. He would lose to Governale at the same location in a ten-round decision one month later.\\"Jannazzo Wins Decision\\", The Indianapolis Star, Indianapolis, Indiana, pg. 19, 7 June 1946 On January 28, 1947, he fought his last fight against Steve Belloise at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida. Belloise scored a technical knockout in 2:20 of the third round, and his manager, Chris Dundee, announced Jannazzo's retirement after seventeen years in the ring.\\"Joey Maxim Wins in No Contest\\", Reno Gazette-Journal, Reno, Nevada, pg. 16, 29 January 1947 Life after boxing During WWII, Jannazzo worked as an air raid warden. After retiring from boxing in 1947, Jannazzo eventually worked for the city managing an incinerator for the department of sanitation. He retired at sixty-five to spend time with his children and grandchildren. Around 1991, shortly after he moved to Columbus, Ohio, his family placed him in a nursing home, due primarily to the progressive boxing induced dementia from which he was suffering. On June 18, 1995, Jannazzo died in Columbus, Ohio. He was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Gardens in Columbus, where his wife had been buried three months earlier.

Separation of the product from the reaction mixture does not need a separate distillation step which saves energy (for heating) and materials. This technique can be useful for equilibrium-limited reactions such as esterification and ester hydrolysis reactions. Conversion can be increased beyond what is expected by the equilibrium due to the continuous removal of reaction products from the reactive zone. This approach can also reduce capital and investment costs. The conditions in the reactive column are suboptimal both as a chemical reactor and as a distillation column, since the reactive column combines these. The introduction of an in situ separation process in the reaction zone or vice versa leads to complex interactions between vapor‚Äìliquid equilibrium, mass transfer rates, diffusion and chemical kinetics, which poses a great challenge for design and synthesis of these systems. Side reactors, where a separate column feeds a reactor and vice versa, are better for some reactions, if the optimal conditions of distillation and reaction differ too much. Applicable Processes Reactive distillation can be used with a wide variety of chemistries, including the following: *Acetylation *Aldol condensation *Alkylation *Amination *Dehydration *Esterification *Etherification *Hydrolysis *Isomerization *Neutralization *Oligomerization *Transesterification *Hydrodesulfurization of light oil fractions =Examples= The esterification of acetic acid with alcohols including methanol,Scott D. Barnicki \\"Synthetic Organic Chemicals\\" in Handbook of Industrial Chemistry and Biotechnology edited by James A. Kent, New York : Springer, 2012. 12th ed. . n-butanol, ethanol, isobutanol, and amyl alcohol. Another interesting feature of this system is that it is associated with the formation of a minimum boiling ternary azeotrope of ester, alcohol and water, which is heterogeneous in nature. Hence, in a typical reactive distillation column that consists of both reactive and non-reactive zones, the heterogeneous azeotrope or a composition close to the azeotrope can be obtained as the distillate product. Moreover, the aqueous phase that forms after the condensation of the vapor is almost pure water. Depending on the requirement either of the phases can be withdrawn as a product and the other phase can be recycled back as reflux. The pure ester i.e. butyl acetate, being the least volatile component in the system, is realized as a bottom product. Removing organic acids in alcohol (ethanol, isopropanol) dewatering columns is a simple example. An aqueous base (NaOH, KOH) is added to the top of the column, the acid-base reaction occurs in the column, and the resulting organic salts and excess base exit the bottom of the column with the separated water.

After the revolutions of 1917, Chertkov was instrumental in creating the United Council of Religious Communities and Groups, which eventually came to administer the Russian SFSR's conscientious objection program. Life and career=Family and childhood= Chertkov was born in 1854 in St. Petersburg, Russia into a wealthy and aristocratic family. His mother (to whom he felt especially close), Elizaveta Ivanovna, born Countess Chernysheva-Kruglikova, was known among her circle in St. Petersburg society for her beauty, intellect, authoritativeness and tact. His father, Grigorii Ivanovich, was aide-de-camp under Nikolai I, Adjutant-General under Alexander II and Alexander III, known in military circles for his front-line service and military bearing. The couple enjoyed imperial favour so much that Alexander II and Alexander III visited their home. Describing his parents in one of his diary entries, he wrote: ‚ÄúThat's how I grew up, assured of my own innate advantage over other people, proud of the dignity of my parents, their relatives and friends, entourage of servants, rising from their seats in the ante-room when I passed from my rooms into my parents‚Äô part of the house, swimming in all kinds of luxury and almost not knowing rejection in satisfaction of my desires.‚Äù The young Chertkov was considered very handsome ‚Äì slender, tall, with big gray eyes under beaked brows ‚Äì and had a talent for witty paradox. =Military service= Nineteen-year-old Chertkov voluntarily joined the Life Guards of the Cavalry. Yet while yielding to all the enjoyment that was offered by life in the circle of golden youth, unaware of either external or internal obstacles for the realization of his desires, Chertkov from time to time felt that there was something wrong in his life and strove to find some moral law that would subordinate his behavior. In order to understand these doubts, to look closer at other ways of life and remain alone with himself, he decided for a time to abandon his accustomed life, take a vacation for several months and go to England. At the end of December 1879, Chertkov wrote his mother a letter from England: :\\"I can tell you a few fragments of my last thoughts: # In order to be useful, a person must define his position in the world around him; # He must therefore look at himself not subjectively but objectively; and # He can only reach such a view when the strength of all his aspirations is concentrated not upon himself, but on some kind of high goal, located outside himself.‚Äù And he wrote further that concentrating all his thought on Christian study could be useful to deal with the problems of his life. =Lizinovka= In 1880, he resigned from military service, left Petersburg, and settled in his family‚Äôs estate in Lizinovka, where he planned to help the peasants at whose expense he lived, although he had an unclear understanding of their needs. Leo Tolstoy and Vladimir Chertkov Scrutinizing the work of the zemstvo and finding weaknesses, he conceived the idea of implementing on his parent‚Äôs estate some measures disregarded by the zemstvo. He organized a trade school for peasant children. =Influence of Tolstoy= In October 1883 his first meeting with Leo Tolstoy took place in Moscow, changing the entire course of his life. It would be said of him that he was more Tolstoy than Tolstoy himself. Fulfilling the ideal of moral self-improvement, Chertkov gave all his heart and soul to educational activity. Following Tolstoy‚Äôs initiative, in 1885 Chertkov organized and financed a publishing house called Intermediary () which specialized in the release of art and moralizing literature for people. Intermediary succeeded in publishing works aimed at the education of the Russian people, despite the pressure of the Imperial censorship and the hostile attitude of the Orthodox Church. The new publishing house was supported by many of the most outstanding writers of the country: Tolstoy, Chekhov, Korolenko, Garshin, and Leskov all wrote for Intermediary. Books were sold unusually cheaply. Reasonable prices and good publicity, in which Repin, Surikov, Kivshenko and other Russian artists were engaged, helped distribution. =Conflict with Tolstoy family= Chertkov had a troubled relationship with most of the Tolstoy family, and tried actively to destroy the relationship between Tolstoy and his wife Sophia. Tolstoy's final flight, for example, is described as having been greatly influenced by Chertkov. Sophia was especially troubled by what she felt was his hypocritical philosophy: he decried wealth, but had his own fancy estate. His associates lay about her house and ate free and paid no rent and criticized her materialism, while she raised several children and ran the entire business side of Tolstoy's writing (at Tolstoy's wish), which provided a major source of income for Yasnaya Polyana and enabled their lifestyle.Alexandra Popoff, Sophia Tolstoy: A Biography (New York Free Press, 2010). Additionally, Chertkov convinced Tolstoy to sign a secret will and give control of his works to Chertkov instead of Sophia. He then used this control to publish versions of Tolstoy's collected works as he wanted. He also criticized Sophia, discredited her diaries and her own writing, and played up his own relationship with the Count. Chertkov also fostered a positive relationship with the newly formed Soviet state, which he used to suppress Sophia's version of Tolstoy's life story and his relationship with her.Popoff, 2010. Popoff is also writing a book about Tolstoy and Chertkov, according to http://bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2013/03/23/book-review-lina-and-serge-the- love-and-wars-lina-prokofiev-simon-morrison/BjXRZjJwxhC2J9bmnZZA7N/story.html. =Rossosh= Chertkov‚Äôs closest employees were often engaged in editing and drawing up his plans on his farmstead in Rossosh, located in the Ostrogozhsk District. Rossosh had a manor house on top of a hill, as well as an extensive courtyard and subsidiary buildings; at the base of this mountain were three ponds in succession, and behind them 20 desyatina of forest. Soon the small village of Rossosh turned into a large publishing center. From here Chertkov conducted extensive correspondence on the affairs of Intermediary with Russian writers and artists. Tolstoy came to visit his friend here in the spring of 1894. =Life in exile= Portrait of Anna Chertkova (1890) by Mikhail Nesterov Since the autocracy considered Tolstoyism an enemy, Chertkov left for England in 1897. He was an avid Anglophile like his mother, admired the English tradition of free speech, and was already corresponding with a small collective based at Purleigh in Essex, who were looking to put Tolstoy's ideas into practice.A. McKinstry, The Village of Tuckton, 35,000 BC - 1926 (Christchurch: Natula Publications, 2015), p. 105 ff. It was to Purleigh, therefore, that Chertkov initially gravitated and it was here that he set up a publishing company, the Free Word Press (), producing Russian-language versions of Tolstoy's works and kindred literature, much of which was smuggled back into Russia. A separate branch of this business, the Free Age Press, producing English-language texts, was set up in 1900. Chertkov's wife, Anna Konstantinovna, born Dieterichs (1859‚Äì1927), was trustee of the Free Word Press and produced several texts for both arms of the business. The Purleigh group began to split up towards the end of 1900, at which point Chertkov moved with his family and followers to Tuckton House, at Tuckton in Bournemouth, purchased for him by his mother. The group used the defunct waterworks in nearby Iford Lane as their printing works, and continued to churn out Free Word and Free Age Press texts until July 1908, when most of the colony returned with Chertkov to Russia. (The Tsar had granted a pardon to all political exiles three years previously.) The Free Age Press continued to flourish, with a single member of the Tolstoy colony based at Tuckton House as translator and editor, until 1916.A. McKinstry, The Village of Tuckton, 35,000 BC - 1926 (Christchurch: Natula Publications, 2015), p. 119. There was, of course, less and less appetite for Tolstoy's mainly pacifist writings as Britain drifted into war. Chertkov remained in Russia where, as Tolstoy's literary executor, he was editor-in-chief of one last project: a complete edition of Tolstoy's works in Russian, which ultimately extended to ninety volumes, and was still in motion when Chertkov died in Moscow, after a series of strokes, in 1936. He is buried in Vvedenskoye Cemetery. Film Actor Paul Giamatti portrayed Chertkov in the 2009 film The Last Station.

Opened in 1969 with seven employees in Norwalk, Connecticut, the chain now includes six stores in Connecticut and New York. The newest location opened on September 18, 2019 in Paramus, NJ.  History = Clover Farms Dairy = Charles Leonard, a hatter in a sweatshop, founded Clover Farms Dairy in Norwalk, CT, in the early 1920s. = First store = In 1969, Stew Leonard opened the Clover Farms Dairy store in Norwalk. = Expansion = Stew Leonard acquired land for a second store in Danbury, CT, in the mid-1980s. The store opened in 1991. Stew Leonard's announced plans to open a store in Yonkers, NY, in 1997. The store opened in September 1999. The Leonard family began working to open a store on Long Island, in 2002. However, plans to open a store across from the Republic Airport in Farmingdale, NY fell through. In 2015, Stew Leonard's announced plans to open a store in Farmingdale in early 2016; the store opened in January 2016. A store in Newington, Connecticut was announced in February 2006 and opened in April 2007.  Tax fraud  In 1993, Stew Leonard, Sr. was convicted of having committed tax fraud via an elaborate scheme to divert more than $17.1 million in cash register receipts over a 10-year period. The fraud, which involved a computer program designed to skim off sales, was directed by Stew Leonard, Sr., in concert with the company's CFO and store manager. Skimmed cash was placed in bundles in Leonard, Sr.'s office fireplace, to be later moved offshore or disguised as gifts. Leonard, Sr. was caught in June 1991 carrying $80,000 cash en route to the Caribbean island of Saint Martin. Leonard, Sr. pled guilty to the charges and, in 1993, was sentenced to 52 months in prison. He ultimately served 44 months before being released in June 1997. =Short-weighting= In 1993, shortly after Stew Leonard, Sr. and three other company executives had pled guilty in the tax fraud case, the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection charged Stew Leonard's with short-weighting customers on multiple products. The department measured a 47% violation rate, compared with a statewide average of 7.2%. Stew Leonard, Jr. and Tom Leonard denied that these actions were intentional and claimed, \\"a larger percentage of products checked were, in fact, overweight than underweight\\", and, \\"we corrected every [mistake] before the inspector even left the store.\\"  Stores  There are currently three stores in Connecticut: * Norwalk, opened in 1969 * Danbury, opened in 1991 * Newington, opened in 2007 There are currently three stores in New York: * Yonkers, opened in 1999 * Farmingdale, opened in 2016 * East Meadow, opened in 2017 There is currently one store in New Jersey: * Paramus, opened in 2019 = Features and layout = The New York Times called Stew Leonard's the \\"Disneyland of Dairy Stores.\\" The stores are not set up like traditional grocery stores; the aisle configurations guide customers to walk through the entire store (although there are short cuts). As customers walk through the aisles, they are greeted by various employees dressed up in costumes and by animatronic characters, called the \\"Farm Fresh Five\\", that perform songs and dance. Stew Leonard's famous \\"Stew Burger\\", the nickname given to the stores hamburger, is displayed by the entrance of each location. The stores also feature petting zoos and outdoor cafes in the warmer months, and offer tasting booths and a variety of prepared meals year round. \\"Anyone who comes from Connecticut or thereabouts knows this landmark chain of grocery stores where mechanized cows sing and roosters crow,\\" according to a writer for the Sun-Sentinel of Florida. Corporate philosophy The store is notable for its customer service policy, which greets shoppers at each store's entrance, etched into a three-ton rock: 1\\\\. The customer is always right. 2\\\\. If the customer is ever wrong, re-read rule #1.

J Formos Med Assoc 2007; 106: 854‚Äì860. Other areas affected may include the lymph nodes, the lining of the abdomen, diaphragm, spleen, liver, chest wall, skull, spinal cord, large intestine, small intestine, bladder, brain, lungs, testicles, ovaries, and the pelvis. Reported sites of metastatic spread include the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, brain, skull, and bones. It is characterized by the EWS-WT1 fusion protein. The tumor is classified as a soft tissue sarcoma and a small round blue cell tumor. It most often occurs in male children. The disease rarely occurs in females, but when it does the tumors can be mistaken for ovarian cancer. Signs and symptoms Display of small round blue cells characteristic of desmoplastic small-round-cell tumor. Cell exhibiting blue oval and round shapes of desmoplastic small-round blue cell tumor There are few early warning signs that a patient has a DSRCT. Patients are often young and healthy as the tumors grow and spread uninhibited within the abdominal cavity. These are rare tumors and symptoms are often misdiagnosed by physicians. The abdominal masses can grow to enormous size before being noticed by the patient. The tumors can be felt as hard, round masses by palpating the abdomen. First symptoms of the disease often include abdominal distention, abdominal mass, abdominal or back pain, gastrointestinal obstruction, lack of appetite, ascites, anemia, and cachexia. Other reported symptoms include unknown lumps, thyroid conditions, hormonal conditions, blood clotting, kidney and urological problems, testicle, breast, uterine, vaginal, and ovarian masses. Genetics There are no known risk factors that have been identified specific to the disease. The tumor appears to arise from the primitive cells of childhood, and is considered a childhood cancer. Research has indicated that there is a chimeric relationship between DSRCT and Wilms' tumor and Ewing sarcoma. Together with neuroblastoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, they form the small-cell tumors. DSRCT is associated with a unique chromosomal translocation t(11;22)(p13:q12) resulting in an EWS-WT1 fusion transcript that is diagnostic of this tumor. This transcript codes for a protein that includes the N-terminal transactivation domain of EWSR1 and the DNA-binding domain of WT1. The EWS/WT1 translocation product targets ENT4. ENT4 is also known as PMAT. Pathology The entity was first described by pathologists William L. Gerald and Juan Rosai in 1989. Pathology reveals well circumscribed solid tumor nodules within a dense desmoplastic stroma. Often areas of central necrosis are present. Tumor cells have hyperchromatic nuclei with increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio. On immunohistochemistry, these cells have trilinear coexpression including the epithelial marker cytokeratin, the mesenchymal markers desmin and vimentin, and the neuronal marker neuron-specific enolase. Thus, although initially thought to be of mesothelial origin due to sites of presentation, it is now hypothesized to arise from a progenitor cell with multiphenotypic differentiation. Diagnosis=Differential diagnosis= Because this is a rare tumor, not many family physicians or oncologists are familiar with this disease. DSRCT in young patients can be mistaken for other abdominal tumors including rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and mesenteric carcinoid. In older patients DSRCT can resemble lymphoma, peritoneal mesothelioma, and peritoneal carcinomatosis. In males DSRCT may be mistaken for germ cell or testicular cancer while in females DSRCT can be mistaken for Ovarian cancer. DSRCT shares characteristics with other small-round blue cell cancers including Ewing's sarcoma, acute leukemia, small cell mesothelioma, neuroblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, and Wilms' tumor. Treatment DSRCT is frequently misdiagnosed. Adult patients should always be referred to a sarcoma specialist. This is an aggressive, rare, fast spreading tumor and both pediatric and adult patients should be treated at a sarcoma center. There is no standard protocol for the disease;Talarico F, Iusco D, Negri L, Belinelli D: Combined resection and multi-agent adjuvant chemotherapy for intra- abdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumour: case report and review of the literature. G Chir 2007; 28: 367‚Äì370. however, recent journals and studies have reported that some patients respond to high-dose (P6 Protocol) chemotherapy, maintenance chemotherapy, debulking operation, cytoreductive surgery, and radiation therapy. Other treatment options include: hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, radiofrequency ablation, stereotactic body radiation therapy, intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemoperfusion, and clinical trials. Prognosis The prognosis for DSRCT remains poor. Prognosis depends upon the stage of the cancer. Because the disease can be misdiagnosed or remain undetected, tumors frequently grow large within the abdomen and metastasize or seed to other parts of the body. There is no known organ or area of origin. DSRCT can metastasize through lymph nodes or the blood stream. Sites of metastasis include the spleen, diaphragm, liver, large and small intestine, lungs, central nervous system, bones, uterus, bladder, genitals, abdominal cavity, and the brain. A multi-modality approach of high-dose chemotherapy, aggressive surgical resection, radiation, and stem cell rescue improves survival for some patients. Reports have indicated that patients will initially respond to first line chemotherapy and treatment but that relapse is common. Some patients in remission or with inoperable tumor seem to benefit from long term low dose chemotherapy, turning DSRCT into a chronic disease. Research The Stehlin FoundationOfficial website for Stehlin Foundation currently offers DSRCT patients the opportunity to send samples of their tumors free of charge for testing. Research scientists are growing the samples on nude mice and testing various chemical agents to find which are most effective against the individual's tumor. Patients with advanced DSRCT may qualify to participate in clinical trials that are researching new drugs to treat the disease. The Cory Monzingo Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization that supports the research for treatments and a cure for DSRCT. The Cory Monzingo Foundation provides funding to MD Anderson Cancer Center and may also provide funding to other nonprofit cancer research organizations. In 2002, Nishio and al, established a novel human tumor cell line derived from the pleural effusion of a patient with a typical intra-abdominal DSRCT, called JN-DSRCT-1 that can now be used in research. St. Jude Children‚Äôs Research Hospital has, in 2018, make available resources from the Childhood Solid Tumor Network, that upon request gives access to patient-derived orthotopic xenografts. Alternative names This disease is also known as: desmoplastic small round blue cell tumor; intra- abdominal desmoplastic small round blue cell tumor; desmoplastic small cell tumor; desmoplastic cancer; desmoplastic sarcoma; DSRCT. There is no connection to peritoneal mesothelioma which is another disease sometimes described as desmoplastic.

He was one of the foremost realists of his generation who closely upheld the mantle of his mentor, Robert Henri. Biography Speicher was born in Buffalo, New York. He began his studies in art at the Albright Art School. He moved to New York in 1907 and began attending the Art Students League where he studied with William Merritt Chase and Frank Vincent Du Mond. In 1908, he won the school's Kelley Prize with a portrait of fellow student Georgia O'Keeffe.EUGENE SPEICHER: ALONG HIS OWN LINES IN NEW PALTZ In 1909 took life classes with Robert Henri at the New York School of Art, which he found of great importance to his formative style. Through Henri, with whom he became close friends, he also became acquainted with George Bellows, with whom he also became close, and with Rockwell Kent, Edward Hopper, Guy P√®ne du Bois, Leon Kroll, and a coterie of realist artists with whom he associated. In 1910, he went to Europe, where he remained for two years to study the Old Masters in Paris, the Netherlands, and Spain. Upon his return, he settled in New York, and soon became known as one of the most promising of the younger group of American painters. He discovered Woodstock, New York, soon after and began to split his time between Manhattan and Woodstock, where he became an important and popular figure in the art colony. From the teens, Speicher began to receive a steady stream of awards and honors. By the 1920s Speicher was considered a leading portrait artist in America, practicing a form of realism. Among the awards he received was the Beck Gold medal for portraiture at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia in January 1920, for his painting Russian Girl. In 1926 he was awarded the Potter Palmer Gold medal at the Art Institute of Chicago for The Lace Scarf. In 1936 Esquire magazine called him America's most important living painter. He was also awarded the Temple Gold Medal at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1938 for Marianna. Recognized for his work in portraiture, Speicher‚Äôs renown allowed him to support himself with commissions, and he also executed many flower still lifes and landscapes. Always favoring female subjects, he was also one of the few moderns to undertake nudes for which he became known. With a strong technique and great capability as a draughtsman, Speicher‚Äôs compositions are analytical and methodical in their design and execution. He was nominated an associate of the National Academy of Design in 1912 and a full academician in 1925. Speicher was appointed director of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1945. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

Best known for his stage work and television roles in teleplays and series, he also appeared briefly on radio and in film. Early life and education Hepton was born in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire and said he was born in the same street as J.B. Priestley thirty years earlier. His father, Bernard senior, was an electrician, while his mother Hilda (n√©e Berrington) was from a mill- working family. Brought up as a Catholic (which he remained as an adult), he attended St Bede's Grammar School in the city. His short-sight meant he was unable to serve in the army during the Second World War, but he trained as an aircraft engineer and draughtsman while undertaking firewatching duties. Theatre Hepton trained at the Bradford Civic Playhouse under director Esme Church. He had extensive stage experience as an actor in repertory, especially in Scarborough and York. In 1952, he joined Birmingham Rep under Barry Jackson, later himself becoming the theatre's artistic director in 1957. Later, for a brief period from 1963, he was director of the Liverpool Playhouse, but resigned during his first season. Productions of the Max Frisch play The Fire Raisers and John Osborne's Luther were not well-received locally because of their content. He was responsible for orchestrating the fight sequences in Laurence Olivier's film version of Richard III (1955) and an Old Vic production of Hamlet with lead Richard Burton in 1953. Television On television, he played Caiaphas in the 1969 Dennis Potter play Son of Man. He was cast as the Kommandant in Colditz (1972‚Äì74) and later appeared for the same production team as Albert Foiret in three seasons of Secret Army (1977‚Äì79).Daily Telegraph Obituaries p27 \\"Actor who played Kommandant in Colditz and Toby Esterhase in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" Issue no 50,760 dated Wednesday 1 August 2018 Before that he made a guest appearance in an episode of the first series of Catweazle (1970) where he played a naturalist. Other notable performances included Thomas Cranmer in both The Six Wives of Henry VIII (1970) and Elizabeth R (1971). He reprised the role in the film adaptation of the former, Henry VIII and His Six Wives (1972). Hepton acted in adaptations of John le Carr√©'s novels, as Toby Esterhase in the BBC Television versions of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Smiley's People, and George Smiley in the radio adaptations. He appeared in I, Claudius (1976) as Pallas and in the comedy series The Squirrels (1974‚Äì77). Having played Inspector Goole in An Inspector Calls (1982) and Sir Thomas Bertram in Mansfield Park (1983), he appeared as Sam Toovey in the 1989 television adaptation of Susan Hill's ghost story The Woman in Black (1989). Radio and film On radio, Hepton played the role of Albert, in Stranger in the Home by Alan Dapre, also the role of The Old Man in the Corner, the amateur, and mostly sedentary, sleuth in the BBC dramatisations of The Teahouse Detective (1998‚Äì2000) by Baroness Orczy. He also starred in Robert Barr's quirky detective radio series \\"Galbraith\\" as Inspector Bill Galbraith on BBC radio. Hepton's appearances in feature films were less frequent, he made his debut in 1949. He made a brief appearance as Thorpey, a gangster, in the classic British film Get Carter (1971), and another small role, as Milton Goldsmith, in Voyage of the Damned (1976). Personal life and death Hepton was married to actress Nancie Jackson from 1957 until she died in 1977. Jackson played his wife Alice in the TV movie A Man for All Seasons. She and Hepton settled in Barnes, south-west London. He married Hilary Liddell in 1979; she died in 2013. He died on 27 July 2018, aged 92. He was survived by a niece and nephew.

When talking about poetry written in English the term is arguably of limited significance or utility, at least by comparison to its antonym, catalectic, for the simple reason that acatalexis is considered to be the \\"usual case\\" in the large majority of metrical contexts and therefore explicit reference to it proves almost universally superfluous. For example, to describe Shakespeare's sonnets as having been written in iambic pentameter acatalectic would be factually accurate, but redundant and never said, because iambic pentameter is presumed to be acatalectic unless specified as being catalectic. However, in very rare contexts where catalexis might be considered probable (e.g., in English trochaic tetrameter, or in differentiating acatalectic verses from surrounding catalectic ones), explicit expression of the verse's metrical completeness may be achieved by using the term. When talking about poems published in languages other than English, the term might prove itself more useful. For example in Polish poetry acatalectic iambic lines are unusual, because feminine ending is dominant.Wiktor J. Darasz, Hipometria i hipermetria, Jƒôzyk Polski, 3/2001, p. 189-191 (in Polish).

A Skrull, she possesses the ability to shapeshift into almost any humanoid or animal form. Modifications on her body give her the power to generate energy blasts. Publication history Lyja first appeared in Fantastic Four #357 (October 1991), and was created by Tom DeFalco and Paul Ryan. She was revealed to have been impersonating Alicia Masters ever since Fantastic Four #265 (April 1984). Lyja remained a supporting character in the series until the launch of the \\"Heroes Reborn\\" storyline in 1996. She returned in a tie-in to the Secret Invasion limited series in 2008. Fictional character biography The Skrull Empire‚Äîlongtime enemies of the Fantastic Four‚Äîembarked on a plan to infiltrate the team by impersonating Alicia Masters‚Äîblind sculptor and love interest of Benjamin Grimm (the Thing). The author of the plan, Paibok the Power Skrull, selected the warrior Lyja to be the spy and espionage agent‚Äîpossibly as retribution because they had once had a failed affair. Nevertheless, Lyja trained extensively to pull off the disguise, even using contact lenses to make herself blind in human form to learn how to navigate the world as Alicia did. Soon after Lyja's arrival on Earth, a near-omnipotent being known as the Beyonder kidnapped numerous super- powered beings (including three members of the Fantastic Four), transporting them to a makeshift Battleworld, where they participated in a series of \\"Secret Wars\\" between the so-called forces of good and evil. Lyja took the opportunity of their distraction to replace Alicia, greeting the Fantastic Four on their return to Earth from Battleworld. The Skrull plan almost hit a snag when Lyja discovered that the Thing opted to remain on Battleworld at the end of the war, instead of returning home to Earth. Lyja instead seduced Johnny Storm, the Human Torch. When the Thing learned that Johnny and \\"Alicia\\" were lovers, they became estranged. Lyja fell in love with Johnny and eventually they were married under the false pretense of her as Alicia Masters. Eventually Alicia's stepfather, the villain known as the Puppet Master, realized that the woman claiming to be his stepdaughter was an imposter, and took his suspicions to the Thing. Lyja was forced by the Thing to transform back to her true Skrull appearance. She disclosed her true identity, as well as the fact that the real Alicia was a captive of the Skrulls. She aided the Fantastic Four in finding the real Alicia Masters in the Skrull Empire, but was believed to be slain when she threw herself in the path of a blast which Paibok had meant for the Human Torch. In actuality, Paibok recovered Lyja and revealed to Devos the Devastator that she was still alive. Paibok, with the assistance of Devos, awoke Lyja from her comatose state, and bestowed her with the power to fly and fire energy blasts from her hands becoming \\"Lyja the Lazerfist\\". These powers were later revealed to come from a special device implanted into her. Joining them in search of vengeance, the three arrived on Earth, and isolated and battled the Torch at Empire State University. Panicking, the Torch burst into his Nova Flame and destroyed the campus. Alongside Devos and Paibok, Lyja witnessed a battle between the Fantastic Four and an alternate Fantastic Four. Lyja still bore feelings for the Torch and once again betrayed her cohorts to side with the Four. Lyja then first encountered Aron the Watcher, and aided the Fantastic Four against Doctor Doom. Alongside the Fantastic Four, Lyja battled Devos, Paibok, Klaw, and Huntara. Lyja impersonated Bridget O'Neil, and became jealous on discovering Johnny Storm's affection for Bridget. After returning to the Fantastic Four and Johnny, Lyja claimed she was pregnant with Johnny's child. Over time, Lyja and Johnny began to grow close again. When Lyja delivered the \\"child\\" (an egg), the implant that gave her the \\"Lazerfist\\" powers was also removed, returning Lyja to an ordinary Skrull with no extra powers beyond her shapeshifting. The implant was subsequently absorbed by a normal human, apparently an electronics expert named Raphael Suarez, who gained the \\"Lazerfist\\" powers, and attempted to contact the Fantastic Four for their assistance but after the hectic events that followed the hatching of the \\"egg\\", Raphael wandered off, realizing the Fantastic Four were not going to be of any help in their current state, and has not been referenced since. Although Lyja and Johnny were growing close, Lyja was continuously torn about telling Johnny something. She was too scared to risk shattering the bonds they had managed to form again, and kept putting it off. Ultimately, it was too late. The \\"egg\\" was revealed, not to be their child, but rather a Skrull bio- weapon, which Lyja subsequently destroyed after it hatched. Johnny, enraged at being betrayed and deceived again by Lyja, broke things off with her again. Lyja was still in love with Johnny and stalked him while as a human, Laura Green. Johnny was initially interested in a fellow college student but when he realized nothing was going to materialize with her his focus shifted to Laura/Lyja. Lyja, having learned her lessons well, eventually decided to reveal herself before Johnny felt betrayed again. After sharing a kiss with Laura, Johnny already knew that his ex-wife was in fact Laura Green. During the Onslaught crisis when Lyja was injured she attempted to tell Johnny the truth but he informed her that he already knew. The couple seemed to be on track to reconciling their relationship until the Fantastic Four were presumed dead after a devastating fight with Onslaught, and as a result, Lyja left to attempt a normal life, masquerading again as a human woman. Soon after the Fantastic Four's were revealed to have survived the fight with Onslaught, Johnny mentions that he can not locate Lyja. =Secret Invasion= During the Secret Invasion storyline, Lyja poses as the Invisible Woman in order to send the Baxter Building to the Negative Zone. She reveals herself to her former spouse and attacks him, feeling angry that he had forgotten her. During the course of their battle, Johnny saves Lyja from being hit by a police car, pulled in through the portal. The two reconcile after that, but a Negative Zone creature attacks them. They manage to defeat the creature, but Lyja passes out from her injuries. Some time later, when the \\"new\\" Fantastic Four fly off to the prison, Franklin and Valeria are grabbed by multiple Negative Zone creatures, however Lyja saves them. She informs Johnny that she had been working in a book store when a Skrull approached her, insisting she join them. They attempted to convince her to help them blow up the Baxter Building, but instead she sends the Fantastic Four to the Negative Zone, in hopes of keeping them from harm's way. When Ben, Johnny, Franklin, Val and the Tinkerer were ready to leave the Negative Zone, she refused to leave, as she wanted to stay behind and find out who she really was. =Future Foundation= Lyja later appeared as an ally of the Future Foundation, helping them in locating the scattered atomic remnants of the Molecule Man. Having assumed the identity of Yondu Udonta to escape persecution for being a Skrull, she helped Foundation member Julie Power infiltrate a galactic prison where one of these renmants (which was attached to Rikki Barnes) was located. She later killed Kl'Rath, a Zn'rx ally of The Maker, for him having killed innocent Skrull children, impersonated him and helped in thwarting The Maker's plans. Upon Alex Power's invitation, she subsequently joined the Future Foundation. Powers and abilities Lyja's Deviant Skrull heritage gives her the ability to change size, shape, and color at will, taking on the appearance but not the characteristics of other beings and objects. Skrulls cannot duplicate the superhuman powers of the beings they use their shape-shifting powers to impersonate. For a brief time, because of genetic alteration (later revealed to be an implant) by Paibok the Power Skrull, Lyja had the ability to project blasts of laser-like beams called her \\"bio-blasts\\" from her hands without harm to herself. She could suspend herself in the air by firing her bio-blasts beneath her. These powers were lost when her body rejected the power- generating implant during her giving \\"birth\\". Lyja wears body armor of unspecified materials. She wore special contact lenses that rendered her blind while she impersonated Alicia Masters. Lyja has been trained in armed and unarmed combat by the Skrull military. She is also trained in acting and educated in Earth culture and history and the English language by Skrull tutors. She is also talented as a creator of abstract sculpture. In the Secret Invasion storyline, she regained her energy powers through unspecified means, as well as the ability to resist the incredible levels of heat and flame the Human Torch can generate. Lyja has also been seen manifesting dragon-like wings through her shape-shifting powers, enabling her to fly. Other versions=Marvel Zombies= Lyja appears in the Marvel Zombies Universe on a planet besieged by the Zombie Galactus - consisting of zombie versions of Giant-Man, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Luke Cage, Wolverine and Hulk during a Black Panther crossover. Here she possesses the power of the Invisible Woman as part of an experiment following the death of the Super-Skrull in this universe; unable to replicate the Super-Skrull, the Fantastic Four's powers were instead given to four different Skrulls. She is loyal to the Skrulls and seems insulted when the Johnny Storm of the regular Marvel Universe - who has been transported into this universe with the 'new' Fantastic Four of the Torch, the Thing, the Black Panther and Storm - admits to knowing her. She is shortly thereafter infected with the zombie virus, along with the rest of her team. During the subsequent conflict between the zombie-Skrull-Fantastic Four and the new Fantastic Four, she is decapitated by a vibranium dagger thrown by the Black Panther, and her head is subsequently destroyed by Black Panther before she can bite Johnny after she lands near his ankle. =MC2= In the MC2 universe, Lyja is once again married to the Human Torch and is a member of the Fantastic Five, under the name Ms. Fantastic. The couple has a son, Torus Storm, who inherited both Lyja's shape-shifting abilities and the Torch's flame powers. She remains active among the Fantastic Five and is sporadically seen in the Spider-Girl series and related mini-series. Spider-Girl mentions in their first encounter that if she was not fighting Lyja she would probably ask for her autograph, as she was a fan. =Power Pack= Lyja is introduced within the Skrulls vs. Power Pack miniseries as a young Skrull who is impersonating Katie Power, as well as being a commander under the orders of Warpriest Kh'oja in which he framed the Power siblings by stealing special treasures from Patchworld. In other media=Television= * Lyja appeared in the 1994 Fantastic Four TV series voiced by Katherine Moffat. She is shown as a commander to the Skrull army.

One form of catalexis is headlessness, where the unstressed syllable is dropped from the beginning of the line. A line missing two syllables is called brachycatalectic. In English Poems can be written entirely in catalectic lines, or entirely in acatalectic (complete) lines, or a mixture, as the following carol, composed by Cecil Frances Alexander in 1848: :Once in Royal David's city (8 syllables) : Stood a lowly cattle shed, (7 syllables) :Where a mother laid her Baby (8 syllables) : In a manger for His bed: (7 syllables) :Mary was that mother mild, (7 syllables) :Jesus Christ her little Child. (7 syllables) It has been argued that across a number of Indo-European languages, when the two types of line are mixed in this way, the shorter line tends to be used as a coda at the end of a period or stanza.West, M.L. (1982). \\"Three topics in Greek metre\\". Classical Quarterly Vol. 32, No. 2, pp. 281-297; p. 281. Blunt and pendant catalexis It has been argued that catalexis can be divided into two types.L. P. E. Parker (1976). \\"Catalexis\\". The Classical Quarterly, Vol. 26, No. 1 (1976), pp. 14-28; p. 15. (Here \\"x\\" stands for an anceps syllable.) :(a) When a line with a pendant ending such as trochaic (‚Äì u ‚Äì x) is made catalectic, the result is a line with a blunt (or \\"masculine\\") ending (‚Äì u ‚Äì). :(b) When a line with a blunt ending such as iambic (x ‚Äì u ‚Äì) is made catalectic, the result is a line with a pendant ending (u ‚Äì x). An example of a blunt line becoming pendant in catalexis is Goethe's poem Heidenr√∂slein, or, in the same metre, the English carol Good King Wenceslas: :Good King Wenceslas looked out, (4 beats, blunt) : On the Feast of Stephen, (3 beats, pendant) :When the snow lay round about, (4 beats, blunt) : Deep and crisp and even; (3 beats, pendant) Another example is the children's song Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush, of which the first stanza ends as follows: :Here we go round the mulberry bush (4 beats, blunt) : On a cold and frosty morning (3 beats, pendant) In all of these songs, when they are set to music, there is a lengthening of the penultimate syllable in order to equalise the two lines. However, there is not enough evidence to tell if a similar phenomenon occurred in Ancient Greek. When a poem is doubly catalectic (brachycatalectic), that is, shortened by two syllables, a blunt ending remains blunt: :Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound (4 beats) : That saved a wretch like me. (3 beats) :I once was lost, but now am found, (4 beats) : Was blind, but now I see. (3 beats) Quantitative metres In languages which use quantitative metres, such as Latin, Ancient Greek, Arabic, Persian, and Sanskrit, the final syllable of any line is anceps, that is, indifferently long or short. According to one view dating back to ancient times, even if the final syllable is prosodically short, it counts as long because of the pause which follows it (see brevis in longo).M. L. West, \\"Three topics in Greek metre\\", The Classical Quarterly, Vol. 32, No. 2 (1982), pp. 281-297; p. 287.L. P. Elwell-Sutton (1976), The Persian Metres, p. 87‚Äì88. Thus any line ending ‚Äì u ‚Äì, when catalectic, becomes ‚Äì x. An example in Ancient Greek is the iambic tetrameter, which in normal and catalectic form is as follows:L. P. E. Parker (1976). \\"Catalexis\\". The Classical Quarterly, Vol. 26, No. 1 (1976), pp. 14-28; p. 14. : x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  : x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  In classical Arabic, the most commonly used metre, the ·π≠awƒ´l, has normal and catalectic forms as follows:W. Wright (1896), A Grammar of the Arabic Language, vol. 2, p. 364. : u ‚Äì x  u ‚Äì x ‚Äì  u ‚Äì x  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  : u ‚Äì x  u ‚Äì x ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  A similar phenomenon is also found in classical Persian.L. P. Elwell-Sutton (1976), The Persian Metres, p. 87‚Äì88; Thiesen, Finn (1982), A Manual of Classical Persian Prosody, p. 18. For example, the metre based on the choriamb pattern (‚Äì u u ‚Äì) has a shortened form as follows: : ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  : ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì  Catalexis in Greek poetry Catalexis was common in Greek and Latin meter, and also in ancient Sanskrit verse.West, M.L. (1982). \\"Three topics in Greek metre\\". Classical Quarterly Vol. 32, No. 2, pp. 281-297. Catalectic endings are particularly common where the rhythm of the verse is dactylic ( ‚Äì u u ), trochaic ( ‚Äì u ), or anapestic ( u u ‚Äì ); they tend to be associated with the end of a strophe or period, so much so that it can almost be said that acatalectic forms cannot end a period. In classical verse, the final syllable of a line always counted as long, so that if a dactyl ( ‚Äì u u ) is made catalectic, it becomes a spondee ( ‚Äì ‚Äì ). Ancient poetry was often performed to music, and the question arises of what music accompanied a catalectic ending. A few ancient Greek poems survive with authentic musical notation. Four of these are by Mesomedes (early 2nd century CE). Secondary sources of Mesomedes' poems To Helios and To Nemesis are in a catalectic meter known as apokrota \\"sonorous.\\" In each case, in place of the missing short element of the text (i.e., missing syllable) one often finds lengthening signs. In two cases in To Helios, this appears to be a three-note melisma. It is possible ancient use of catalexis indicated some form of melody or continued singing in place of the missing syllables. In ancient Greek drama, catalectic meters may have been associated with a male aulete or had some other special use. For example, of Menander's surviving plays, almost all are in iambic trimeters. He changed the meter in one long scene in Misanthrope to 15-syllable catalectic iambic tetrameter recited to an aulos accompaniment. Catalexis in Latin poetry Poem 25 by Catullus is in iambic tetrameter catalectic. Of Catullus' extant 114 or so poems and fragments, this meter appears only in this poem.Wikibooks:The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus/Meters Used By Catullus# Catalexis in music Venantius Fortunatus' hymn Pange lingua is in trochaic tetrameter catalectic‚Äîthe meter of the marching chants of the Roman armies. The hymn is one of the oldest with surviving musical notation. As Greek meter is often used to describe musical phrasing, some famous themes include: *The slow movement to Haydn's Surprise Symphony (spondaic dimeter catalectic) *The theme of Weber's Rondo brillante in E-flat (anapestic tetrameter brachycatalectic) *The slow movement of Beethoven's 7th symphony (alternating acatalectic and catalectic dactylic tetrameter)  See also  * Acatalectic  References  Category:Poetic rhythm ","title":"Catalectic"},{"id":"2296252","text":"North Berkeley is an underground Bay Area Rapid Transit station located on Sacramento Street in the North Berkeley region of Berkeley, California. The station is bounded by Virginia, Sacramento, Delaware, and Acton streets in a residential area north of University Avenue. The main station entrance sits within a circular building at the center of a parking lot, while an elevator between the surface and the platform is located at the parking lot's Sacramento Street edge. History The site was originally an open area across which the Key System constructed its Westbrae streetcar line, subsequently given the letter designation \\"G\\". The tracks ran diagonally across the property in virtually the same alignment as today's underground BART tracks. Homes began to be constructed along the periphery of the site, and after the G-Westbrae line was closed in 1941, filled in most of the rest of it. All of these were demolished in the 1960s to make way for construction of the North Berkeley station. Service at the station began on January 29, 1973. Pursuant to a law passed by the state of California in 2018, the City of Berkeley and BART are beginning to plan the development of transit-oriented housing on the station parking lot, with a deadline for zoning due to the district in 2020. The station site is only partially suited for housing due to the presence of the tracks and station box underneath.

At the start of 1980s, larger branches sub let spaces within their stores for concessions, these were mostly either Klick Photopoint or key cutting company \\"Mister Minit\\" In 1985, they were the victim of a hostile take over by their biggest competitor Sketchley, but the takeover bid ultimately failed. Johnson Cleaners UK Ltd (JCUK) was formed in 1995 when the twelve operating companies, which made up the Johnson Group in the UK at that time, were restructured into just two companies. In 1997, Klick Photopoint decided to start moving their concessions out of Johnsons and into their own shop premises, initially Johnsons decided to replace Klick with Mister Minit concessions, However they soon changed their mind about this. In May 1998, Mister Minit bought Sketchley Dry Cleaners, which then made Mister Minit their main competitor. Following this takeover, Johnsons started kicking Mister Minit out of their branches and replacing them with rival shoe repair company Timpsons. In 2000, they took over their largest commercial laundry rival Seamara Group (Sketchley's former holding company prior to 1998). April 2003 Minit UK PLC (owners of Mister Minit and Sketchley) were taken over by Timpsons, by this transaction Johnsons had a new enemy within their branches to contend with, just like in May 1998 when Mister Minit bought Sketchley, but now there was no other rival multiple shoe repair company they could put into their branches to replace Timpsons. In 2004, they held talks with Morrisons about buying Safeway's Dry Cleaning Business, but when talks failed; they purchased Sketchley (the UK's second-largest dry cleaner) from Timpson instead. The Sketchley shops were rebranded as Johnsons in 2007. Along with the acquisition of Sketchley, they inherited the Jeeves of Belgravia (London's upmarket dry cleaning) brand. In 2006, the JSG (Johnson Service Group) decided to put the chain of 550 dry cleaning stores up for sale, they told the media that the retail division accounted for less than 25% of their annual profits and they had decided to concentrate on their commercial laundry, textile rental and work wear businesses instead, but despite some equity groups looking at the retail arms accounts; no bid was ever made for the dry cleaning shops. In 2010, they launched Green Earth Dry Cleaning Branding across all their shops. During the summer of 2012, Johnsons announced the closure of over 100 underperforming stores. In January 2015, they announced the closure of 109 of their 307 remaining branches; the reason given was the 109 shops' leases had come to an end and it would not be viable to renew them. Today the retail division accounts for less than 10% of JSG's (JOHNSON SERVICE GROUP) Annual profits In January 2017, the remaining 198 Johnson Cleaners stores, along with Jeeves of Belgravia and Jeeves International, were purchased from Johnson Service Group by competitor Timpsons. Since January 2017 the Johnsons store estate has declined to 100 stores approximately due to the takeover of Morrison's dry cleaning business and existing shop leases not being renewed References External links  * http://www.johnsoncleaners.com/ * Category:Companies based in Cheshire Category:Companies based in Liverpool Category:Service companies of the United Kingdom ","title":"Johnsons Cleaners UK"},{"id":"2296257","text":"The atmospheric CO2 concentration Roger Randall Dougan Revelle (March 7, 1909 ‚Äì July 15, 1991) was a scientist and scholar who was instrumental in the formative years of the University of California San Diego and was among the early scientists to study anthropogenic global warming, as well as the movement of Earth's tectonic plates. UC San Diego's first college is named Revelle College in his honor.  Career  Roger Revelle was born in Seattle to William Roger Revelle and Ella Dougan. He grew up in southern California. After graduating from Pomona College in 1929 with early studies in geology, he earned a PhD in oceanography from the University of California, Berkeley in 1936. While at Cal, he studied under George Louderback and was initiated into Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity, which started as a mining engineering fraternity and maintained a strong affinity for geology and geological engineering students. Much of his early work in oceanography took place at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) in San Diego. He was also oceanographer for the Navy during WWII. He was director of SIO from 1950 to 1964. He stood against the UC faculty being required to take an anti- communist oath during the Joseph McCarthy period. He served as Science Advisor to Interior Secretary Stewart Udall during the Kennedy Administration in the early 1960s and was President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1974). = Growth of oceanography = Revelle was deeply involved in the growth of oceanography in the United States and internationally after World War II. Working for the Navy in the late 1940s, he helped to determine which projects gained funding. He also promoted the idea that the Navy ought to support \\"basic research\\" instead of only trying to build new technology. At Scripps he launched several major long-range expeditions in the 1950s, including the MIDPAC, TRANSPAC (with Canada and Japan), EQUAPAC, and NORPAC, each traversing a different part of the Pacific Ocean. He and other scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography helped the U.S. government to plan nuclear weapons tests, in the hope that oceanographers might make use of the data. Revelle was one of the committee chairmen in the influential National Academy of Sciences studies of the biological effects of atomic radiation (BEAR), the results of which were published in 1956. In 1952, along with Dr. Seibert Q. Duntley, he successfully moved the MIT Visibility Lab to SIO with financial support of the U.S. Navy.History of the Scripps Visibility Lab. Along with oceanographers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Revelle planned the American contributions to the oceanographic program of the International Geophysical Year (IGY). He became the first president of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research, an international group of scientists devoted to advising on international projects, and was a frequent adviser to the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, created in 1960. = Global warming = Revelle was instrumental in creating the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1958 and was founding chairman of the first Committee on Climate Change and the Ocean (CCCO) under the Scientific Committee on Ocean Research (SCOR) and the International Oceanic Commission (IOC). During planning for the IGY, under Revelle's directorship, SIO participated in and later became the principal center for the Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Program. In July 1956, Charles David Keeling joined the SIO staff to head the program and began measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide at the Mauna Loa Observatory on Mauna Loa, Hawaii, and in Antarctica. Hans Suess was recruited by Revelle, and they co-authored a 1957 article using carbon-14 isotope levels to assess the rate at which carbon dioxide added by fossil fuel combustion since the start of the industrial revolution had accumulated in the atmosphere. They concluded that most of it had been absorbed by the Earth's oceans, contrary to the assumption made by early geoscientists (Chamberlin, Arhenius and Callendar) that it would simply accumulate in the upper atmosphere to \\"lower the mean level of back radiation in the infrared and thereby increase the average temperature near the Earth's surface\\". There had been little sign to date of this greenhouse effect causing the anticipated warming, but the Suess‚ÄìRevelle article suggested that increasing human gas emissions might change this. They said that \\"human beings are now carrying out a large scale geophysical experiment of a kind that could not have happened in the past nor be reproduced in the future\\". (Manusript received September 4, 1956). Revelle told journalists about the issues and testified to Congress that \\"The Earth itself is a space ship\\", endangered by rising seas and desertification. A November 1957 report in The Hammond Times described his research as suggesting that \\"a large scale global warming, with radical climate changes may result\\" ‚Äì the first use of the term global warming. See also footnote 27. A biographer of Suess later said that, although other articles in the same journal discussed carbon-dioxide levels, the Suess‚ÄìRevelle article was \\"the only one of the three to stress the growing quantity of contributed by our burning of fossil fuel, and to call attention to the fact that it might cause global warming over time\\".Waenke, Heinrich, and Arnold, James R., (2005) \\"Hans E. Suess, A biographical Memoir\\", pp. 363‚Äì364. Revelle and Suess described the \\"buffer factor\\", now known as the \\"Revelle factor\\", which is a resistance to atmospheric carbon dioxide being absorbed by the ocean surface layer posed by bicarbonate chemistry. Essentially, in order to enter the ocean, carbon dioxide gas has to partition into one of the components of carbonic acid: carbonate ion, bicarbonate ion, or protonated carbonic acid, and the product of these many chemical dissociation constants factors into a kind of back- pressure that limits how fast the carbon dioxide can enter the surface ocean. Geology, geochemistry, atmospheric chemistry, ocean chemistry ... this amounted to one of the earliest examples of \\"integrated assessment\\", which 50 years later became an entire branch of global-warming science. At his death, Revelle may well have still been waiting for a signal that would prove global warming as a serious problem correct. In the November 1982 Scientific American Letters to the Editors, Revelle stated: \\"We must conclude that until a warming trend that exceeds the noise level of natural climatic fluctuations becomes clearly evident, there will be considerable uncertainty and a diversity of opinions about the amplitude of the climatic effects of increased atmospheric CO2. If the modelers are correct, such a signal should be detectable within the next 10 or 15 years.\\" = UC San Diego = During the late 1950s, Revelle fought for the establishment of a University of California campus in San Diego. He had to contend with the UC Board of Regents, who would have preferred merely to expand the University of California, Los Angeles campus rather than create an entirely new campus in San Diego. He also came into conflict with San Diego politicians and businessmen who believed that the campus should be established closer to downtown, such as near San Diego State University or in Balboa Park. The decision to build the campus at La Jolla was made in 1959, and the first graduate students were enrolled in 1960, followed by the first undergraduates in 1964. Revelle's struggle to acquire land for the new campus put him in competition with Jonas Salk, and Revelle lost some of what he called the \\"best piece of land we had\\" on UCSD's eventual Torrey Pines site to the fledgling Salk Institute. In later years Revelle continued to show some animosity toward Salk, once saying: \\"He is a folk hero, even though he is... not very bright.\\"UCSD 25th Anniversary Oral History Project, Interview conducted May 15‚Äì16, 1985 by Dr. Kathryn Ringrose. When at Scripps and while building UCSD, Revelle also had to deal with a La Jolla community that refused to rent or sell property to Jews. In addition to battling the anti-semitic restrictive covenants of La Jolla real estate, Revelle helped found a new housing subdivision for Scripps professors, partially because some of them would not have been allowed to live in La Jolla. Revelle left Scripps in 1963 and founded the (now defunct) Center for Population Studies at Harvard University. In his over ten years there as its Director, he focused upon the application of science and technology to the problem of world hunger. In 1976 he returned to UC San Diego as Professor of Science, Technology and Public Affairs (STPA) in the school's political science department. = Views on climate change distorted = In 1991, Revelle's name appeared as co-author on an article written by physicist S. Fred Singer and electrical engineer Chauncey Starr for the publication Cosmos: A Journal of Emerging Issues, titled \\"What to do about greenhouse warming: Look before you leap\\", which was published in the summer of 1992. The Cosmos article included the statement that \\"Drastic, precipitous‚Äîand, especially, unilateral‚Äîsteps to delay the putative greenhouse impacts can cost jobs and prosperity and increase the human costs of global poverty, without being effective. Stringent economic controls now would be economically devastating particularly for developing countries...\\".Lehmann, E. Merchants of Doubt about Global Warming Hope to Strike Back. Climate change deniers look to file lawsuits against those exposing their actions, ClimateWire, Scientific American, March 9, 2015, accessed, 3/16/2015. The article concluded: \\"The scientific base for a greenhouse warming is too uncertain to justify drastic action at this time. There is little risk in delaying policy responses.\\" These particular statements and the bulk of the article, including the title, had been written and published a year earlier by S. Fred Singer as sole author.\\"What to do about greenhouse warming\\", Environmental Science and Technology, Vol. 24, No. 8, 1990. Singer's article stated that \\"there is every expectation that scientific understanding will be substantially improved within the next decade\\" and advocated against drastic and \\"hastily-conceived\\" action at the time without further scientific evidence. It does not, however, deny climate change or global warming. Justin Lancaster, Revelle's graduate student and teaching assistant at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography from 1981 until Revelle's death, says that Revelle was \\"hoodwinked\\" by Singer into adding his name to the article and that Revelle was \\"intensely embarrassed that his name was associated\\" with it.The Cosmos Myth.James Hoggan, Richard Littlemore, Climate Cover-Up: The Crusade to Deny Global Warming, Graystone Books, 2009, pages 134‚Äì138. In 1992, Lancaster charged that Singer's actions were \\"unethical\\" and specifically designed to undercut then‚ÄìSenator Al Gore's global warming policy stance; however, to end a lawsuit brought by Singer against Lancaster with support of the Center for Public Interest in Washington, D.C., Lancaster gave Singer a statement of apology, but refused to admit that anything he said was false. In 2006, prompted by Robert Balling and others continuing to state that Revelle actually wrote the article, Lancaster formally withdrew his retraction and reiterated his charges.A Note About Roger Revelle, Justin Lancaster and Fred Singer. rabett.blogspot.com, September 13, 2004. When Gore was running for the vice-presidential nomination in 1992, The New Republic picked up on the contrast between the references to Revelle in Gore's book Earth in the Balance and the views in the Cosmos article that could now be attributed to Revelle. This was followed up by Newsweek and elsewhere in the media. Patrick Michaels boasted that the Cosmos article had been read into the Congressional Record. The issue was even raised by Admiral James Stockdale in the televised vice-presidential debate. Gore's response was to protest that Revelle's views in the article had been taken out of context. Roger's daughter, Carolyn Revelle, wrote:Carolyn Revelle Hufbauer. Global Warming: What My Father Really Said, The Washington Post, 13 September 1992. > Contrary to George Will's \\"Al Gore's Green Guilt\\" Roger Revelle‚Äîour father > and the \\"father\\" of the greenhouse effect‚Äîremained deeply concerned about > global warming until his death in July 1991.

Inaction was not one of them. > He agreed with the adage \\"look before you leap\\", but he never said \\"sit on > your hands\\". = Legacy = During his last decade at UCSD and SIO, Revelle continued to work and teach. In the early 1980s, he taught undergraduate STPA seminars twice a year, in Energy and Development (mainly on problems in Africa), the Carbon Dioxide Problem (known now as the Global Warming problem), and Marine Policy. In 1986 he won the Balzan Prize for Oceanography/Climatology. A 1990 heart attack forced him to move his course to the Scripps Institution from the Revelle College provost's office, where he continued to teach the Marine Policy program until his death the following year. In 1991, he was awarded the National Medal of Science by President George H. W. Bush (one of about 500 recipients in the 20th century). He remarked to a reporter: \\"I got it for being the grandfather of the greenhouse effect.\\" Revelle died in San Diego on July 15, 1991, from complications of cardiac arrest. He was survived by his wife, Ellen Clark Revelle (1910‚Äì2009), three daughters, and one son, William, as well as numerous grandchildren. In his honor, a new research vessel at the Scripps Institution was named R/V Roger Revelle. Also, the Ocean Studies Board of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine created the Roger Revelle Commemorative Lecture series in memory of Revelle in 1999, featuring distinguished speakers on the themes of ocean science and public policy. Since 1992, the American Geophysical Union has annually awarded a prize in his honor, the Roger Revelle Medal, for outstanding contributions in atmospheric sciences.

The Alcaic stanza and the Sapphic stanza named for Alcaeus' contemporary, Sappho, are two important forms of Classical poetry. The Alcaic stanza consists of two Alcaic hendecasyllables, followed by an Alcaic enneasyllable and an Alcaic decasyllable. In Sappho's and Alcaeus' poetry The Alcaic stanza as used by Sappho and Alcaeus has the scheme ( where \\"‚Äì\\" is a longum, \\"u\\" a breve, and \\"√ó\\" an anceps): √ó ‚Äì u ‚Äì √ó ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  (alc11) √ó ‚Äì u ‚Äì √ó ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  (alc11) √ó ‚Äì u ‚Äì √ó ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  (alc9 ) ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  (alc10) In Latin poetry One stanza consists of four lines; the first two lines are divided into two parts by a caesura after the fifth syllable. The metrical pattern of an Alcaic stanza would look like this: ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì : ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì : ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì (An \\"‚Äì\\" denotes a long syllable, \\"u\\" a short one, and \\":\\" is the caesura.) Horace frequently used the Alcaic stanza in his Odes, as can be seen from this example : ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì Antehac nefas, depromere Caecubum ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì : ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u‚Äì cellis avitis, dum Capitolio ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì u‚Äì ‚Äì Regina dementis ruinas ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u u‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì funus et Imperio parabat. (Odes 1.37, lines 5-8) An English translation, which suggests the metre, is : ‚Äì‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì : ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì Prior to this, 'twas  irreligious to waste ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì : ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì Old Caecuban wine  whilst, for the Capitol ‚Äì ‚Äìu ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì Mad ruination plots the Queen, and ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì Even a funeral for the Empire. Imitations in other languages A famous example of English Alcaics is Tennyson's \\"Milton\\": O mighty-mouth'd inventor of harmonies, O skill'd to sing of Time or Eternity, God-gifted organ-voice of England, Milton, a name to resound for ages! The Alcaic stanza was adapted to use in English and French during the Renaissance. It was very frequently used in Italian poetry of the 19th century, especially by Giosu√® Carducci. As in English, the meter is accentual rather than quantitative. Poi che un sereno vapor d‚Äôambrosia da la tua c√≤ppa diffuso avvolsemi, o Ebe con passo di dea trasvolata sorridendo via; ::(Giosu√® Carducci, \\"Ideale\\", from: Odi barbare) It was an historically important form in Hungarian poetry.See and In Polish poetry (in contrast to the Sapphic stanza which was extremely popular since the 16th century) Alcaics were used very rarely. Even in translation Horace's Alcaic stanzas were usually turned into different forms. An example (perhaps the only) of an Alcaic stanza in Polish original literature is Stanis≈Çaw Trembecki's Ode to Adam Naruszewicz:Adam Wa≈ºyk, Mickiewicz i wersyfikacja narodowa, Warszawa 1951 (in Polish). O ty, kap≈Çanie Delijskiego ≈õwiƒôtny, Przesz≈Çego wiadom, przysz≈Ço≈õci pojƒôtny Wie≈Ñcz twe skronie, wieszczƒÖ bierz laskƒô, ≈önie≈ºny ubi√≥r i z≈ÇotƒÖ przepaskƒô. Trembecki's verse is syllabic (11/11/9/10). There is no accentual metrical pattern. German has also used alcaics with some success. They were introduced by Klopstock, and used by H√∂lderlin, by Johann Heinrich Voss in his translations of Horace, by August Kopisch and other 19th century German poets.

After graduating from orchestral conducting in La Plata, he was hired by Les Luthiers to play the fiddlecan (a violin made of tuna can), and famously learnt the repertoire in two days (around 1970). For the next season, he started a songwriting partnership with Jorge Maronna, and they penned 'Pieza en Forma de Tango'; he also composed 'Voglio Entrare Per la Finestra' (with libretto by Marcos Mundstock) and around June 1971 he was invited to be a group member rather than a paid collaborator.https://web.archive.org/web/20070205014428/http://www.gerardomasana.com.ar/luthiers/index.html During the first years in Les Luthiers, L√≥pez-Puccio played other instruments such as cello, viola and percussion, and he often provided backing vocals. He also composed all the music for many pieces for the group, including 'Concierto de Mpkstroff' (which features group-mate Carlos N√∫√±ez Cort√©s as soloist) and 'Brotan und Gretchen'. He slowly gained notoriety scripting jokes for his groupmates as well as occasional song lyrics. From 1979 onwards he also played piano, synthesiser and harmonica for several musical pieces, especially since Ernesto Acher left the group, and they started including electronic keyboards more often. He also became more and more involved as an actor, having several starring parts from the 80's onwards.

In Ireland it repealed the Test Act 1672 and the remaining Penal Laws which had been in force since the passing of the Disenfranchising Act of the Irish Parliament of 1728. Its passage followed a vigorous campaign that threatened insurrection led by Irish lawyer Daniel O'Connell. The British leaders, starting with the Prime Minister the Duke of Wellington and his top aide Robert Peel, although initially opposed, gave in to avoid civil strife. The act permitted members of the Catholic Church to sit in the parliament at Westminster. O'Connell had won a seat in a by-election for Clare in 1828 against an Anglican. Under the then extant penal law, O'Connell, as a Catholic, was forbidden to take his seat in Parliament. Peel, the Home Secretary, until then was called \\"Orange Peel\\" because he always supported the Orange (anti-Catholic) position. Peel now concluded: \\"though emancipation was a great danger, civil strife was a greater danger.\\" Fearing a revolution in Ireland, Peel drew up the Catholic Relief Bill and guided it through the House of Commons. To overcome the vehement opposition of both the House of Lords and King George IV, the Duke of Wellington worked tirelessly to ensure passage in the House of Lords, and threatened to resign as Prime Minister if the King did not give Royal Assent. Agitation The campaign for Catholic emancipation in Ireland, 1828‚Äì1829, was led by Daniel O'Connell (1775‚Äì1847), organiser of the Catholic Association, but many others were active as well, both for and against. As Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1822 to 1828, the Marquess Wellesley (brother of the Duke of Wellington) played a critical role in setting the stage for the Catholic Emancipation Bill. His policy was one of reconciliation that sought to have the civil rights of Catholics restored while preserving those rights and considerations important to Protestants. He used force in securing law and order when riots threatened the peace, and he discouraged the public agitation of both the Protestant Orange Order and the Catholic Society of Ribbonmen. Bishop John Milner was an English Catholic cleric and writer highly active in promoting Catholic emancipation until his death in 1826. He was a leader in anti-Enlightenment thought and had a significant influence in England as well as Ireland, and was involved in shaping the Catholic response to earlier efforts in Parliament to enact Catholic emancipation measures. Meanwhile, Ulster Protestants mobilised, after a delayed start, to stop emancipation. By late 1828, Protestants of all classes began to organise after the arrival of O'Connellite Jack Lawless who planned a series of pro-emancipation meetings and activities across Ulster. His move galvanised the Protestants to form clubs, distribute pamphlets and set up petition drives. However the Protestant protests were not well funded or coordinated and lacked critical support from the British government. After Catholic relief had been granted, the Protestant opposition divided along class lines. The aristocracy and gentry became quiescent while the middle and working classes showed dominance over Ulster's Catholics through Orange parades. (subscription only) Compromise The Parliamentary Elections (Ireland) Act 1829 (10 Geo. IV, c. 8) which accompanied emancipation and received its Royal Assent on the same day, was the only major ‚Äòsecurity‚Äô eventually required for it. This Act disenfranchised the minor landholders of Ireland, the so-called Forty Shilling Freeholders and raised fivefold the economic qualifications for voting. Starting in the initial relief granting the vote by the Irish Parliament in 1793, any man renting or owning land worth at least forty shillings (two pounds sterling), had been permitted to vote. Under the Act, this was raised to ten pounds. The act also forbade the use of the episcopal titles already used by the Church of England (10 Geo. IV, c. 7, s. 24). It imposed a penalty of ¬£100 on 'any person, not authorised by law, who should assume the title of any archbishop, bishop or dean' and extended the provisions to the 'assumption of ecclesiastical titles derived from any city, town, or place in England and Ireland, not being in an existing see'. This was reinforced with the Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851, which threatened confiscation of property of anyone outside the \\"united Church of England and Ireland\\" to use any episcopal title \\"of any city, town or place, or of any territory or district (under any designation or description whatsoever), in the United Kingdom\\". The 1851 act was never enforced and was repealed in 1871. The other impositions in the act, such as admittance to Catholic religious orders and public processions being illegal, were repealed with the Roman Catholic Relief Act of 1926.Text of Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, retrieved 28 January 2018Sections 28 to 36 of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 from Legislation.gov.uk, retrieved 28 January 2018Debates, Roman Catholic Relief Act 1926 from Hansard, retrieved 28 January 2018 Political results J. C. D. Clark (1985) depicts England before 1828 as a nation in which the vast majority of the people believed in the divine right of kings, and the legitimacy of a hereditary nobility, and in the rights and privileges of the Anglican Church. In Clark's interpretation, the system remained virtually intact until it suddenly collapsed in 1828, because Catholic emancipation undermined its central symbolic prop, the Anglican supremacy. Clark argues that the consequences were enormous: \\"The shattering of a whole social order....What was lost at that point... was not merely a constitutional arrangement, but the intellectual ascendancy of a worldview, the cultural hegemony of the old elite.\\" Clark's interpretation has been widely debated in the scholarly literature, and almost every historian who has examined the issue has highlighted the substantial amount of continuity between the periods before and after 1828‚Äì1832. Eric J. Evans (1996) emphasises that the political importance of emancipation was that it split the anti-reformers beyond repair and diminished their ability to block future reform laws, especially the great Reform Act of 1832. Paradoxically, Wellington's success in forcing through emancipation converted many Ultra-Tories to demand reform of Parliament. They saw that the votes of the rotten boroughs had given the government its majority. Therefore, it was an ultra-Tory, the Marquess of Blandford, who in February 1830 introduced the first major reform bill, calling for the transfer of rotten borough seats to the counties and large towns, the disfranchisement of non-resident voters, the preventing of Crown office-holders from sitting in Parliament, the payment of a salary to MPs, and the general franchise for men who owned property. The ultras believed that a widely based electorate could be relied upon to rally around anti-Catholicism. Amendment and repeal Some sections of the act remain in force in the United Kingdom; of these, some remain in force in England or Great Britain, but were repealed with respect to Northern Ireland by the Statute Law Revision (Northern Ireland) Act 1980. The entire act was repealed in Ireland by the Statute Law Revision Act 1983.  See also  * Papists Act 1778 * Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791 * Ultra-Tories NotesFurther reading * Davis, Richard W.

George Gordon, 4th Marquess of Huntly was born in 1643, the son of Lewis Gordon, 3rd Marquess of Huntly and Mary Grant. He was originally styled the Earl of Enzie until his succession as Marquess in December 1653, when he was around four years old. The young Marquess was educated at a Catholic seminary in France, following a tradition within the Huntly family. In 1673, when he was aged 24, he entered the French Army of Louis XIV and served under the famous Marshal de Turenne before returning to Scotland sometime around 1675. In October of the following year, 1676, he married Lady Elizabeth Howard, the second daughter of Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk. However, he was described by the historian Macky as someone \\"made for the company of ladies, but is covetous which extremely eclipses him.\\"Macky. Characters, quoted in The Complete Peerage, Volume VI, p. 3, footnote (e). The marriage was not wholly successful and the couple parted some years before his death. On 1 November 1684, George was advanced from Marquess of Huntly, becoming the first Duke of Gordon. Following the accession of the Catholic James II in 1685, the Duke was made one of the Commissioners of Supply, Constable of Edinburgh Castle, a Commissioner of the Scottish Treasury and a founding Knight of the Order of the Thistle. The Duke owed these positions to his Catholicism, Around this time, he was described as being \\"a libertine and a fop, he is a Roman Catholic because he was bred so, but otherwise thinks very little of revealed religion.\\"Macky, ibid. Following the Glorious Revolution and the overthrow of James II, the Duke held Edinburgh Castle against the Protestant Conventionists. However, he is remembered as being \\"vacillating in his defence\\" and eventually surrendered the Castle on 14 June 1689. As a result of his actions in Edinburgh, he was received somewhat coldly by King James at his residence in exile, the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain- en-Laye, near Paris. On his return to Scotland he was confined on parole. Shortly after this, his Duchess left him and retired to a convent in Flanders. The Duke temporarily regained favour with the accession of Queen Anne in 1702 and was recognised by her as a Knight of the Thistle when she revived the Order on 31 December 1703. However, the Duke, being a true Gordon, could not stay out of trouble for very long. In March 1707, he was arrested along with other Jacobite Lords and was confined to Edinburgh Castle for being implicated in the aborted Jacobite invasion. For his long-suffering Duchess, this was the final straw, and she obtained a deed of separation from her husband. The historian Macky, in his book Characters, observed the Duke and said that \\"he hath a great many links, but they do not make a complete chain; is certainly a very fine gentleman and understands conversation and the belles lettres; is well bred. He is handsome and taller than the ordinary size; thin, dresses well; but is somewhat finical, resembling the French\\". The Duke died at Leith, on 7 December 1716. The Duchess returned to Scotland after his death and resided at Abbey Hill in Edinburgh until her own death in July 1732. Like her husband, she was buried in Elgin Cathedral. Family The duke married Lady Elizabeth Howard, daughter of Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk and with her had two children: * Alexander Gordon, 2nd Duke of Gordon (ca. 1678 - 1728) * Lady Jane Gordon (ca. 1691 - 1773), married James Drummond, 2nd Duke of Perth and had issue.

Early life Atefeh's mother died in a car accident when she was five. Shortly after, her younger brother is said to have drowned in a river. Her father became a drug addict, and she was forced to care for her octogenarian grandparents. Despite her attention to their needs they are reported to have completely ignored her. She grew up in the town of Neka, Iran and was described as a \\"lively and intelligent girl.\\"  Arrest  Atefeh was arrested after being raped by a 51-year-old man. She was convicted for crimes against chastity. During her alleged torture she admitted to being raped repeatedly by the 51-year-old ex-revolutionary guard turned taxi-driver Ali Darabi. Darabi was a married man with children at the time. Atefeh had been raped by Ali Darabi over a period of 3 years without her family being aware. While in prison she was further allegedly tortured and raped by prison guards. She told this to her grandmother who visited her saying that afterwards she could only walk on all fours because of the pain. The judge in her case was Haji Rezai. When Atefah realized that she was losing her case, she removed her hijab, an act seen as a severe contempt of the court, and argued that Ali Darabi should be punished, not her. She even removed her shoes and threw them at the judge. Rezai later sentenced her to death. According to the BBC, the documents presented to the Supreme Court of Appeal described her as 22 years old, but her birth certificate and death certificate stated that she was 16. The issue of her age was not brought to proper attention before it was too late. Amnesty International and other organisations claimed that she suffered from psychological illness, both before and at the trial.  Execution  She was publicly hanged from a crane in Neka, Iran, on August 15, 2004. Amnesty International and other organizations declared her execution to be a crime against humanity and against children of the world.  Aftermath  After the execution of Atefeh, Iranian media reported that Judge Rezai and several militia members, including Captain Zabihi and Captain Molai, were arrested by the Intelligence Ministry. The execution is considered controversial because as a signatory of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Iran promised not to execute anyone under the age of 18. Atefeh's father had passed her birth certificate to the civil authorities, lawyers involved, journalists and Judge Rezai. Pursuant to continual complaints filed by Atefeh's family, and heavy international pressure about her execution and the way the judge mishandled the case, the Supreme Court of Iran issued an order to pardon Atefeh.  Documentaries  The case of Atefeh Sahaaleh is the subject of a BBC documentary made by Wild Pictures in 2006. Director, Monica Garnsey and Associate Producer, Arash Sahami went undercover to document the case. It is also the subject of an hour-long Discovery Times program called Execution in Iran.

Hartt also studied the geology of New Brunswick, and devoted special attention to the Devonian shales, in which he discovered an abundance of land plants and insects. Exploration in Brazil In 1861, Hartt started to work as a student assistant for Louis Agassiz at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University. This work lasted until 1864, when he received an appointment on the geological survey of New Brunswick. In 1865 he accompanied Agassiz to Brazil in the Thayer Expedition. A creationist, Agassiz believed he could find geological proof of his theory concerning glacial action in Brazil that would knock down the evolutionist theory of Charles Darwin.http://www.revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/?art=1694&bd;=1&pg;=1‚â∂=en Hartt fell in love with Brazil, and spent 15 months exploring the coastal regions from Bahia to Rio de Janeiro. The large zoological collections he made were later used to prepare his Geology and Physical Geography of Brazil (Boston, 1870). In 1868 he was elected professor of natural history at Vassar College, but later in the same year he accepted a post at Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York, and planned to return to Brazil. Charles married Lucy Cornelia Lynde of Buffalo, New York, in 1869. They had two children, Mary and Rollin. Both children became writers. In all, Hartt participated in four expeditions to Brazil (the Morgan Expeditions) from 1870 to 1878. He collected a great deal of data about the land and the people, contributing to new knowledge about the flora, the fauna, minerals, geography, linguistics and ethnography. He was an accomplished draftsman and illustrator and musician. In his last voyage he collected more than 500,000 specimens, which were donated to the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro, where he worked as the founder and director of the section of geology from 1866 to 1867. In 1875, following a suggestion by Hartt, the Emperor Dom Pedro II (1825‚Äì1891) established the Imperial Geological Commission. The Commission was closed down after two years of work after losing the Emperor's support. Hartt was joined by his wife and children in Brazil in 1875, but they returned to the United States without him when his wife got pregnant.http://www.myhartt.com/families/charles_frederick_and_lucy_hartt.htm He died in Rio de Janeiro, after contracting yellow fever, at the age of 38. One of his students, the American geologist Orville Adalbert Derby (1851‚Äì1915), succeeded him at the National Museum, after having accompanied him in two of the Morgan Expeditions (1870 and 1871) and having worked with him at the Imperial Commission.

He is captain of the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD)'s homicide detail, and a longtime and long- suffering friend of Adrian Monk from their days on the force together where Stottlemeyer served as Monk's fourth partner and later as watch commander. Stottlemeyer's second-in-command, Lieutenant Randy Disher, is a source of much comedic strife. Stottlemeyer, like many of the characters in the show, can be viewed as a parallel to Detective Monk's Sherlock Holmes character (in this case, Inspector Lestrade). History Not much is known of Stottlemeyer's life before he joined the SFPD, though in an interview, Ted Levine stated it was his own belief that Stottlemeyer had served in the military and was later discharged, lived on the East Coast, then moved to California as a young man, joining the police force. In \\"Mr. Monk and the Class Reunion\\", it is implied that he has lived in the Bay Area since at least the 1970s, as when he is trying to get information from reunion guests about a homicide investigation, he is booed off the stage when the projectionist displays some embarrassing pictures of him wearing riot gear and violently attacking protesters at an anti-nuclear warfare demonstration at UC Berkeley (Monk and Natalie are mortified, while Stottlemeyer insists that the protestors' permit had expired). In \\"Mr. Monk Makes the Playoffs\\", it is mentioned that he hasn't lived in Los Angeles for almost 30 years. The novel Mr. Monk and the New Lieutenant reveals that Stottlemeyer's father was a bartender named Hamish. In \\"Mr. Monk Stays in Bed\\" Leland uses the phrase \\"The 101\\" to refer to Highway 101. In Northern California, people will call Highway 101, \\"Highway 101,\\" not \\"The 101\\"; that's a Southern California term. Stottlemeyer mentions in \\"Mr. Monk Gets Cabin Fever\\" that he was the youngest officer in the history of the SFPD to make detective, giving him at least a few years of seniority on Monk. As Stottlemeyer mentions in \\"Mr. Monk Goes to the Carnival,\\" when Monk was promoted to detective, he was partnered with Stottlemeyer, and right away, showed off his amazing abilities when he proved that a prostitute's apparent suicide was murder. Somehow, the two men worked well together, even though Stottlemeyer was later promoted past Monk. At the time Trudy was murdered, Stottlemeyer reluctantly suspended Adrian from duty, though he still remained his friend. Stottlemeyer also looked up Sharona Fleming and hired her as Monk's practical nurse, which helped Monk to recover from a state of near- catatonia caused by the loss of Trudy. Monk later calls Stottlemeyer \\"the best cop I know.\\" Relationships=Adrian Monk= In the early episodes of the show especially, there is a certain degree of tension between Stottlemeyer and Monk. Stottlemeyer is somewhat antagonistic toward Monk, as he resents being forced (frequently by the higher-ups, such as the Mayor, the chiefs, or the commissioner) into calling on Monk's assistance, and is frequently exasperated by Monk's many quirks. Also inherent in this hostility is a certain degree of jealousy; Stottlemeyer appears only too aware that he is not nearly the detective that Monk is. Sometimes, this has led to some rather large consequences. For instance, in the novel Mr. Monk and the Dirty Cop, he starts to feel a little hostile towards Monk after taking a lot of ribbing from Paul Braddock (and at one time, Braddock actually insults Stottlemeyer, accusing him of using Monk as a metaphorical crutch). As a result, later in the story, upon learning that Monk's consultancy contract has been ripped up, Sharona takes her anger out on Stottlemeyer, accusing him of using the latest round of budget cuts as an excuse to cut Monk (and her) loose as a result of Braddock attacking his abilities. At the same time, Stottlemeyer is also skeptical of Monk's ability to perform as a police officer, aware that Monk's psychological problems are a very serious handicap to such a stressful and dangerous occupation; in \\"Mr. Monk Goes to the Carnival\\", he is forced to betray Monk by honestly revealing his misgivings about allowing Monk back into the police department to the panel evaluating Monk's request. Sharona calls him on his jealousy by telling Stottlemeyer \\"at least your friend Adam Kirk has the decency to stab people in the front,\\" and noting that Stottlemeyer owes Monk that much since Monk does all the work and he takes all the credit. Despite these tensions, however, Stottlemeyer also has a great deal of sympathy and respect for Monk; even Stottlemeyer cannot deny Monk's abilities. Once convinced of the validity of one of Monk's theories, Stottlemeyer always proves a staunch ally in apprehending Monk's primary suspects. A turning point for the character came in the second season episode \\"Mr. Monk and the Captain's Wife\\", when Stottlemeyer's own wife Karen is seriously injured in a car accident and put in a coma. Though she recovers, Stottlemeyer is left with a taste of the kind of pain Monk bears from Trudy and becomes far more sympathetic and respectful to him, if still easily exasperated by Monk's more extreme idiosyncrasies. In \\"Mr. Monk Makes a Friend\\", Monk apparently makes a friend out of Hal Tucker, who is revealed later to have just been using him, but Stottlemeyer saves him, identifying Monk as his friend when he stops Hal. Another example of Stottlemeyer's loyalty as a friend comes in \\"Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan\\", when he helps in Monk's continuing investigation of Trudy's murder. He goes with Monk to New York City to follow up on a lead, and harshly confronts New York City police captain Walter Cage for concealing information about Warrick Tennyson that is essential to Monk to solving the murder of his \\"friend's wife\\", remarking that that was the only thing he cared about at the time. In \\"Mr. Monk Is On the Run\\", when Monk is framed for murder by corrupt sheriff John Rollins, Stottlemeyer proves his loyalty to Monk by helping him fake his own death, risking his own career and freedom. Stottlemeyer begins to come to terms with Monk's quirky behavior after the first few episodes, as demonstrated, for example, in \\"Mr. Monk and the Employee of the Month\\". In one scene, Stottlemeyer asks Monk if he is going to pop all the bubbles on a piece of bubble wrap. When Monk says yes, Stottlemeyer begins to help him, and also has two police officers assist him. When one of them asks whether there is any reason why they are doing this, Stottlemeyer tells them, \\"Nope, just keep popping.\\" It is mentioned in \\"Mr. Monk Takes His Medicine\\" that Stottlemeyer was Monk's fourth partner on the force, and this came two weeks after Monk made detective (Monk says that his first three partners were good enough guys but their professional chemistry did not work). =Randy Disher= Stottlemeyer's relationship with Randy Disher is unbelievable from amused tolerance to frustration. He puts up with his idiosyncrasies and even barely resists laughing at some of his outlandish theories and quirks. It is such that he sometimes prefers to talk to Monk instead of him (such as in \\"Mr. Monk Goes to the Dentist\\", when Randy is complaining about an excruciating toothache). However, he appreciates Randy's abilities and even harbors some affection for him, especially in dangerous situations. He even goes out to help Randy win his money back in \\"Mr. Monk Goes to Vegas\\". In \\"Mr. Monk Gets Lotto Fever\\", he offers to pay off Randy's college loans when he thinks he has won the lottery. Romantic relationships and family Stottlemeyer's recurring problems with his romantic relationships are a frequent running gag of the show. =Karen Junara= Leland married Karen (Glenne Headly) in 1985. They were married for twenty years. Leland states that they have known each other since their childhood in \\"Mr. Monk and the Captain's Wife\\". They have two sons, Jared and Max. Leland and Karen have recurring marital problems and are known to have separated twice. In \\"Mr. Monk and the Captain's Marriage,\\" Monk explains to Natalie that the couple have practically nothing in common (case in point: he recalls one weekend when Leland went on a hunting trip, while Karen stayed behind to organize a rally for stronger gun control). In the season 2 episode \\"Mr. Monk and the Very Very Old Man\\", Karen has to beg Leland to investigate the murder of Miles Holling, the world's oldest man (115 years of age). Leland promises to her that he will investigate if Monk believes that there has been foul play in Miles' death. Because Leland never watched her documentary Miles Holling: The Human Time Machine, Karen kicks him out of the house and Leland is forced to temporarily room with Monk. He does eventually watch the film, which gives him a clue needed to solve both this case and a hit-and-run from several years earlier. In the season 2 episode \\"Mr. Monk and the Captain's Wife\\", Karen is badly injured after a sniper lethally shoots a tow truck driver, sending the truck into a head-on collision with Karen's car. Leland is left with the same type of pain that Monk has learned to deal with. His emotions nearly get the better of him twice, first when confronting a labor union boss he believes to be implicated in the shooting, and then when arresting the actual criminal. In the season 3 episode \\"Mr. Monk Gets Fired\\", Karen is seen filming a documentary about life behind- the-scenes in the SFPD, capturing several moments of the new commissioner's anger as well as Leland and Disher arresting Paul Harley for a premeditated murder and an arson. In the season 4 episode \\"Mr. Monk and the Captain's Marriage,\\" when Leland is working on the murder of Jimmy \\"Chicklet\\" Botsdale, one of the cops on the scene, Sergeant Ryan Sharkey Jr. claims to be having an affair with Karen. Leland punches him and afterwards, he decides to ask Karen if she knows Sharkey. Karen suspiciously denies it, but Leland suspect that it might prove why she's taken to sleeping in the guest room (which she claims is because of his snoring) and her forgetting their anniversary. Because Leland is taking an anger management class, he has to ask Monk and Natalie to follow Karen for him. They are able to take a picture of Karen meeting someone, but cannot get a clear photo. At the end of the episode, when Leland shows the picture to Karen, she says she is seeing a divorce lawyer, as she has decided to end their marriage. In the season 8 episode \\"Mr. Monk Is the Best Man,\\" it is mentioned that Karen was Leland's second wife, and he was married once before, but that marriage was annulled after only five days. =Linda Fusco= In \\"Mr. Monk, Private Eye,\\" Stottlemeyer meets and falls for a local city realtor, Linda Fusco (Sharon Lawrence), after Linda hires Monk and Natalie to investigate a fender bender involving her purple 2006 Buick Lucerne. By the end of the episode, Linda even sets up Stottlemeyer with an apartment just across the street from her own. Despite being acquainted, Stottlemeyer's dates with Linda are usually interrupted or cancelled as a result of his duties. In \\"Mr. Monk and His Biggest Fan\\", Linda is forced to participate in a bachelor auction and pay $2000 to buy Stottlemeyer for six hours of her time (at the same auction, Monk gets \\"bought\\" by Marci Maven). However, their date is interrupted when Stottlemeyer realizes that Marci's neighbor John Ringel murdered his wife Debbie and framed Marci's dead dog. Linda and Stottlemeyer continue dating until the season 6 episode \\"Mr. Monk and the Bad Girlfriend\\", when Stottlemeyer is planning to propose to her during their shared trip to Hawaii. However, shortly before they leave, Linda's former business partner Sean Corcoran is shot and killed by a shotgun-wielding assailant while showing off a house to a couple. Monk and Natalie take the case, but they are both alarmed when they uncover a large amount of evidence that leads them to suspect Linda is the killer: from a photo of her in her office posing with her late grandfather with a twelve-gauge shotgun, they realize she owns a weapon similar to that used in the murder. They also discover that she has an obvious motive ‚Äì that Sean was preparing to start his own company and would take a lot of Linda's clients with him ‚Äì and she is the same height as the killer, has a key to the house, and even wears the same shade of lipstick that a witness described the shooter as wearing. Unfortunately, they have a hard time convincing anyone else, especially Stottlemeyer, that Linda killed her partner. To prove Linda guilty, Monk and Natalie carefully set up a sting operation that exposes how Linda created her airtight alibi for the murder (she talked to Stottlemeyer from a duplicate of her bedroom constructed in the back of a box rental truck that she had rented using her maiden name and previous address). Stottlemeyer reluctantly arrests her, and is left to ask himself whether his relationship with Linda was the real deal, or she just conceived it because she needed a cop to be her alibi for the murder, one question that will never be answered. Taking Disher to accompany him to Hawaii, he secretly throws the engagement ring into the ocean. When Randy asks what he did, Stottlemeyer responds, \\"That was nothing. That was just a rock,\\" which indicates that he planned to propose to Linda while in Hawaii. =Trudy \\"T.K.\\" Jensen= In the final season, Stottlemeyer meets and starts dating journalist Trudy \\"T.K.\\" Jensen (Virginia Madsen), beginning in the episode \\"Happy Birthday, Mr. Monk\\". While Stottlemeyer is initially concerned that Trudy's name would upset Monk, Monk is enthused, saying that everyone should have a Trudy in their life. When Sharona sees T.K.'s picture in Stottlemeyer's office in the season 8 episode \\"Mr. Monk and Sharona\\", she says Stottlemeyer must feel like he won the lottery, and he heartily agrees. In the episode \\"Mr. Monk Is the Best Man\\", Leland marries T.K. However, as the days count down until their wedding, someone starts making threats against Leland and T.K., including ransacking his house, blowing up his car, making threatening phone calls to T.K., and setting off a bomb at the wedding rehearsal. Monk eventually finds out that these acts were the work of T.K.'s friend and maid of honor, Stephanie Briggs (Teri Polo), who was trying to recover a gun she had used earlier that week to kill fellow ecoterrorist Martin Kettering.

The geology of the Ohio River, with but a single series of rapids halfway in its length from the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers to its union with the Mississippi, made it inevitable that a town would grow on the site. Louisville, Kentucky was chartered in the late 18th century. From its early days on the frontier, it quickly grew to be a major trading and distribution center in the mid 19th century, important industrial city in the early 20th, declined in the mid 20th century, before revitalizing in the late 20th century as a culturally-focused mid-sized American city. The history of Louisville, Kentucky spans a bit over two centuries since the latter part of the 18th century. Prior to arrival of Europeans, the region was depopulated from the Beaver Wars of the 17th century, and no permanent Native American settlements existed in the area. It was used as hunting grounds by northern Shawnee and southern Cherokee. The area's geography and location on the Ohio River attracted people from the earliest times. The city is located at the Falls of the Ohio River, then a part of Kentucky County, Virginia. The rapids created a barrier to river travel, and settlements grew up at this portage point. The earliest European settlements were during the latter stages of the American Revolutionary War by Virginian soldiers under George Rogers Clark, first at Corn Island in 1778, then Fort-on-Shore and Fort Nelson on the mainland. The town was chartered in 1780 and named Louisville in honor of King Louis XVI of France. That year it received an influx of 301 settlers. In 2003, the city of Louisville merged with Jefferson County to become Louisville-Jefferson Metro. As of the 2010 census, it is the largest city in the state of Kentucky, the second largest on the Ohio River, and 29th largest city in the nation. Notable residents of the city have included inventor Thomas Edison, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, boxing legend Muhammad Ali, newscaster Diane Sawyer, actors Victor Mature, Ned Beatty and Tom Cruise, actresses Sean Young and Jennifer Lawrence, singer Nicole Scherzinger, R&B; singer Bryson Tiller, the Speed family (including U.S. Attorney General James Speed and Abraham Lincoln's close friend Joshua Fry Speed), the Bingham family, industrialist/politician James Guthrie, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and contemporary writers Hunter S. Thompson and Sue Grafton. Notable events occurring in the city include the largest exhibition installation to date (in 1883) and first large space lighted by Edison's light bulb, and the first library in the South made accessible to African Americans. Medical advances included the 1999 first human hand transplant in the United States and the first self-contained artificial heart transplant in 2001. Pre-Anglo-American settlement history (pre-1778) There was a continuous indigenous human occupation of the area that became Louisville from at least 1,000 BCE until roughly 1650 CE, when the Beaver Wars resulted in depopulation of much of the Ohio River region. The Iroquois maintained this area as a hunting ground by conquest. Archeologists have identified several late and one early Archaic sites in Jefferson County's wetlands. One of the most extensive finds was at McNeeley Lake Cave; many others were found around what is now the Louisville International Airport area. People of the Adena culture and the Hopewell tradition that followed it lived in the area, with hunting villages along Mill Creek and a large village near what became Zorn Avenue, on bluffs overlooking the Ohio River. Archeologists have found 30 Jefferson County sites associated with the Fort Ancient and Mississippian cultures, which were active from 1,000 AD until about 1650. The Louisville area was on the eastern border of the Mississippian culture, which extended through the Mississippi Valley and its tributaries. Regional chiefdoms built dense villages and cities characterized by extensive earthwork mounds arranged around central plazas. When European and English explorers and settlers began entering Kentucky in the mid-18th century, there were no permanent Native American settlements in the region. The country was used as hunting grounds by Shawnee from the north and Cherokee from the south.Lewis, p. 243. The account of the first European to visit the area, the French explorer, Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in 1669, is disputed and not supported by facts. La Salle travelled along the St. Lawrence River to Lake Ontario, then to Lake Erie. The two priests traveling with his party departed the group at that point, and the written documentation of the expedition apparently ceased. Reports of what occurred differ, including abandonment of the journey due to illness, or traveling onward but not to the Ohio River. La Salle did not claim to discover the Ohio River on that voyage nor travel to the falls (of the Ohio).Barnhart & Carmony (1954): Indiana from Frontier to Industrial Commonwealth The \\"discovery\\" of the Louisville area in 1669 is thus perhaps better assigned to myth or legend. Subsequently, La Salle explored areas of the Mississippi river valley and lower Great Lakes region from the Gulf of Mexico up to modern-day Canada, claiming much of this land for France. In 1751, the English colonist Christopher Gist explored areas along the Ohio River. Following the defeat of France in the French and Indian War (part of the Seven Years' War in Europe), it ceded control of its territory east of the Mississippi River to Britain. In 1769, British colonist Daniel Boone created a trail from North Carolina to Tennessee. He spent the next two years exploring Kentucky. In 1773, Captain Thomas Bullitt led the first exploring party into Jefferson County, surveying land on behalf of Virginians who had been awarded land grants for service in the French and Indian War. In 1774, James Harrod began constructing Fort Harrod in Kentucky. However, battles with the Native American tribes established in the area forced these new settlers to retreat. They returned the following year, as Boone built the Wilderness Road and established Fort Boonesborough at a site near Boonesborough, Kentucky. The Native Americans allocated a tract of land between the Ohio River and the Cumberland River for the Transylvania Land Company. In 1776, the colony of Virginia declared the Transylvania Land Company illegal and created the county of Kentucky in Virginia from the land involved. Foundation and early settlement (1778‚Äì1803) Louisville's founder George Rogers Clark as painted by Matthew Harris Jouett in 1825 Col. George Rogers Clark made the first Anglo-American settlement in the vicinity of modern-day Louisville in 1778, during the American Revolutionary War. He was conducting a campaign against the British in areas north of the Ohio River, then called the Illinois Country. Clark organized a group of 150 soldiers, known as the Illinois Regiment, after heavy recruiting in Virginia and Pennsylvania. On May 12, they set out from Redstone, today's Brownsville, Pennsylvania, taking along 80 civilians who hoped to claim fertile farmland and start a new settlement in Kentucky. They arrived at the Falls of the Ohio on May 27. It was a location Clark thought ideal for a communication post. The settlers helped Clark conceal the true reason for his presence in the area.Yater, pp. 2‚Äì4. The regiment helped the civilians establish a settlement on what came to be called Corn Island, clearing land, and building cabins and a springhouse. On June 24, Clark took his soldiers and left to begin their military campaign. A year later, at the request of Clark, the settlers crossed the river and established the first permanent settlement on the mainland. By April, they called it \\"Louisville\\", in honor of King Louis XVI of France, whose government and soldiers aided colonists in the Revolutionary War.Yater, pp. 9‚Äì10. Today, George Rogers Clark is recognized as the European-American founder of Louisville; many landmarks have been named for him. During its earliest history, the colony of Louisville and the surrounding areas suffered from Indian attacks, as Native Americans tried to push out the encroaching colonists. As the Revolutionary War was still being waged, all early residents lived within forts, as suggested by the earliest government of Kentucky County, Virginia. The initial fort, at the northern tip of today's 12th street, was called Fort-on-Shore.Kramer, p. 34-35. In response to the threat of British attacks, particularly Bird's invasion of Kentucky, a larger fort called Fort Nelson was built north of today's Main Street between Seventh and Eighth streets, covering nearly an acre. The GBÔø°15,000 contract was given to Richard Chenoweth, with construction beginning in late 1780 and completed by March 1781. The fort, thought to be capable of resisting cannon fire, was considered the strongest in the west after Fort Pitt. Due to decreasing need for strong forts after the Revolutionary War, it was in decline by the end of the decade. In 1780, the Virginia General Assembly and then-Governor Thomas Jefferson approved the town charter of Louisville on May 1. Clark recruited early Kentucky pioneer James John Floyd, who was placed on the town's board of trustees and given the authority to plan and lay out the town.Ambler, Charles Henry. The Life and Diary of John Floyd (Richmond Press), pp. 13‚Äì30. Jefferson County, named after Thomas Jefferson, was formed at this time as one of three original Kentucky counties from the old Kentucky County, Virginia. Louisville was the county seat.Yater, pp. 18‚Äì19. Also, during 1780, three hundred families migrated to the area, the town's first fire department was established, and the first street plan of Louisville was laid out by Willian Pope. Daniel Brodhead opened the first general store here in 1783. He became the first to move out of Louisville's early forts. Jonathan Cessna built the first house in newly platted Louisville. James John Floyd became the first judge in 1783 but was killed later that year. The first courthouse was completed in 1784 as a 16 by log cabin. By this time, Louisville contained 63 clapboard finished houses, 37 partly finished, 22 uncovered houses, and over 100 log cabins. Shippingport, incorporated in 1785, was a vital part of early Louisville, allowing goods to be transported through the Falls of the Ohio. The first church was built in 1790, the first hotel in 1793, and the first post office in 1795. During the 1780s and early 1790s, the town did not grow as rapidly as Lexington in central Kentucky. Factors were the threat of Indian attacks (ended in 1794 by the Battle of Fallen Timbers), a complicated dispute over land ownership between John Campbell and the town's trustees (resolved in 1785), and Spanish policies restricting American trade and travel down the Mississippi to New Orleans. By 1800, the population of Louisville was 359 compared to Lexington's 1,759.Yater, pp. 24‚Äì25. From 1784 through 1792, a series of conventions were held to discuss the separation of Kentucky from Virginia. On June 1, 1792, Kentucky became the fifteenth state in the United States and Isaac Shelby was named the first Governor. Lewis and Clark on the Lower Columbia by C.M. Russell In 1803, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson to make an expedition across North America; they organized it at the Falls of the Ohio and Louisville. The Lewis and Clark Expedition would take the explorers across the western U.S., surveying the Louisiana Purchase, and eventually to the Pacific Ocean. City development (1803‚Äì1900)=Antebellum= Since settlement, all people and cargo had arrived by flatboats and later keelboats, both of which were non- motorized vessels, meaning that it was prohibitively costly to send goods upstream (towards Pittsburgh and other developed areas). This technical limitation, combined with the Spanish decision in 1784 to close the Mississippi River below Vicksburg, Mississippi to American ships, meant there was very little outside market for goods produced early on in Louisville. This improved somewhat with Pinckney's Treaty, which opened the river and made New Orleans a Free trade zone by 1798.Yater, pp. 26‚Äì28. However, most cargo was still being sent downstream in the early 19th century, averaging 60,000 tons downstream to 6,500 tons upstream. Boats passing through still had to unload all of their cargo before navigating the falls, a boon to local businesses. The frontier days quickly fading, log houses and forts began to disappear, and Louisville saw its first newspaper, the Louisville Gazette in 1807 and its first theatre in 1808, and the first dedicated church building in 1809. All of this reflected the 400% growth in population reported by the 1810 Census.Yater, pp. 32‚Äì33. The economics of shipping were about to change, however, with the arrival of steamboats. The first, the New Orleans arrived in 1811, traveling downstream from Pittsburgh. Although it made the trip in record time, most believed its use was limited, as they did not believe a steamboat could make it back upriver against the current.Yater, p. 34. However, in 1815, the Enterprise, captained by Henry Miller Shreve, became the first steamboat to travel from New Orleans to Louisville, showing the commercial potential of the steamboat in making upriver travel and shipping practical.Hunter, Louis C. (1949), Steamboats on the western rivers, an economic and technological history. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. Industry and manufacturing reached Louisville and surrounding areas, especially Shippingport, at this time. Some steamboats were built in Louisville and many early mills and factories opened. Other towns were developing at the falls: New Albany, Indiana in 1813 and Portland in 1814, each competing with Louisville to become the dominant settlement in the area. Still, Louisville's population grew rapidly, tripling from 1810 to 1820. By 1830, it would surpass Lexington to become the state's largest city, and would eventually annex Portland and Shippingport.Yater, pp. 36‚Äì37. In 1816 the Louisville Library Company, the city's first library, opened its doors with a subscription-based service.Kleber, p. 511. Also, in a series of events ranging from 1798 to 1846, the University of Louisville was founded from the Jefferson Seminary, Louisville Medical Institute and Louisville Collegiate Institute. In response to great demand, the Louisville and Portland Canal was completed in 1830. This allowed boats to circumvent the Falls of the Ohio and travel through from Pittsburgh to New Orleans.Yater, pp. 38‚Äì39. In response to several epidemics and the increasing need to treat ill or injured river workers, Louisville Marine Hospital was completed in 1825 on Chestnut Street, an area that is today home to Louisville's Medical Center.Yater, p. 41. In 1828, the population surpassed 7,000 and Louisville became Kentucky's first city. John Bucklin was elected the first Mayor. The nearby towns of Shippingport and Portland remained independent of Louisville for the time being. City status gave Louisville some judicial authority and the ability to collect more taxes, which allowed for the establishment of the state's first public school in 1829.Yater, pp. 46‚Äì48. In 1831, Catherine Spalding moved from Bardstown to Louisville and established Presentation Academy, a Catholic school for girls. She also established the St. Vincent Orphanage, which was later renamed as St. Joseph Orphanage. Louisville's famous Galt House hotel‚Äîthe first of three downtown buildings to have that moniker‚Äîwas erected in 1834. In 1839, a precursor to the modern Kentucky Derby was held at Old Louisville's Oakland Race Course. Over 10,000 spectators attended the two- horse race, in which Grey Eagle lost to Wagner. This race occurred 36 years before the first Kentucky Derby. It was a popular competition to test the quality of horses. Louisville became a center for sales of horses and other livestock from the Bluegrass Region of central Kentucky, where horse breeding became a major part of the economy and traditions. The Kentucky School for the Blind was founded in 1839, the third-oldest school for the blind in the country. In 1847, William H. Gibson opened one of the city's first schools for African Americans in the basement of the Methodist church on Fourth and Green Streets.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell & Company, 1887. pp. 545‚Äì548 In 1840 William Burke Belknap the elder (1811‚Äì1884) started the Belknap Hardware and Manufacturing Company on the banks of the Ohio River. In 1848, Zachary Taylor, resident of Jefferson County from childhood through early adulthood and a hero of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, was elected as the 12th President of the United States. He served only sixteen months in office before dying in 1850 from acute gastroenteritis. He was buried in the east end of Louisville at Zachary Taylor National Cemetery. Following the 1850 Census, Louisville was reported as the nation's tenth largest city, while Kentucky was reported as the eighth most populous state. The Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N;) Company was founded in 1850 by James Guthrie, who also was involved in the founding of the University of Louisville. When the railroad was completed in 1859, Louisville's strategic location at the Falls of the Ohio became central to the city's development and importance in the rail and water freight transportation business. Historical marker from the corner of Second and Main in downtown Louisville describing the slave trade On August 6, 1855, a day dubbed Bloody Monday, election riots stemming from the bitter rivalry between the Democrats and supporters of the Know-Nothing Party broke out. Know-Nothing mobs rioted in Irish and German parts of the city, destroying property by fires and killing numerous people. Founded in 1858, the American Printing House for the Blind is the oldest organization of its kind in the United States. Since 1879 it has been the official supplier of educational materials for blind students in the U.S. It is located on Frankfort Avenue in the Clifton neighborhood, adjacent to the campus where the Kentucky School for the Blind moved in 1855. \\"Sold down the river\\" Louisville had one of the largest slave trades in the United States before the Civil War, and much of the city's initial growth is attributed to that trade. Shifting agricultural needs produced an excess of slaves in Kentucky, and many were sold from here and other parts of the Upper South to the Deep South. In 1820, the slave population was at its height at nearly 26% of the Kentucky population, but by 1860, that proportion had dropped significantly, even though this percentage still represented over 10,000 people. Through the 1850s, slave traders sold 2500‚Äì4000 slaves annually from Kentucky down river.Kleber, p. 825. The expression \\"sold down the river\\" originated as a lament of eastern slaves being split apart from their families in sales to Louisville. Slave traders collected slaves there until they had enough to ship in a group via the Ohio and Mississippi rivers down to the slave market in New Orleans. There slaves were sold again to owners of cotton and sugar cane plantations. Guy Mendes, \\"Kentucky's Underground Railroad\\" , KET, accessed April 22, 2009 Wilma A. Dunaway, \\"Put in Master's Pocket: Interstate Slave Trading and the Black Appalachian Diaspora\\" , in Appalachians and Race: The Mountain South from Slavery to Segregation, ed. John Inscoe, Lexington, KY: University Press of Kentucky, 2000, republished on filebox.vt.edu, accessed April 21, 2009 Louisville was the turning point for many enslaved blacks. If they could get from there across the Ohio River, called the \\"River Jordan\\" by escaping slaves, they had a chance for freedom in Indiana and other northern states. They had to evade capture by bounty-seeking slave catchers, but many were aided by the Underground Railroad to get further north for freedom.Kentucky's Underground Railroad ‚Äì Community Research , KET =Civil War= Union Gen. Jefferson C. Davis shoots Union Gen. William \\"Bull\\" Nelson on the steps of the Galt House During the Civil War, Louisville was a major stronghold of Union forces, which kept Kentucky firmly in the Union. It was the center of planning, supplies, recruiting and transportation for numerous campaigns, especially in the Western Theater. While the state of Kentucky officially declared its neutrality early in the war, prominent Louisville attorney James Speed, brother of President Abraham Lincoln's close friend Joshua Fry Speed, strongly advocated keeping the state in the Union. Seeing Louisville's strategic importance in the freight industry, General William Tecumseh Sherman formed an army base in the city in the event that the Confederacy advanced. In September 1862, Confederate General Braxton Bragg decided to take Louisville, but changed his mind. There was lack of backup from General Edmund Kirby Smith's forces. In addition, the decision to install Confederate Governor Richard Hawes in the alternative government in Frankfort made people think the state might change. In the summer of 1863, Confederate cavalry under John Hunt Morgan invaded Kentucky from Tennessee and briefly threatened Louisville, before swinging around the city into Indiana during Morgan's Raid. In March 1864, Generals Sherman and Ulysses S. Grant met at the Galt House to plan the spring campaign, which included the capture of Atlanta, Georgia. (, that this meeting actually occurred has fallen into dispute.) By the end of the war, Louisville itself had not been attacked once, although it was surrounded by skirmishes and battles, including the Battle of Perryville and the Battle of Corydon. The Unionists‚Äîmost of whose leaders owned slaves‚Äîfelt betrayed by the abolitionist position of the Republican Party. After 1865 returning Confederate veterans largely took political control of the city, leading to the jibe that it joined the Confederacy after the war was over. During the postwar years, the Freedmen's Bureau opened a school, led by W. H. Gibson, and a bank in the city to serve the now free and growing African American population.Gibson, William H. History of the United brothers of friendship and Sisters of the mysterious ten: in two parts; a Negro order; organized August 1, 1861, in the city of Louisville, Ky. Printed by the Bradley & Gilbert company, 1897. pp. 55, 69, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://archive.org/stream/brofriendsismyst00gibsrich Confederate women organized in associations to ensure the dead were buried in cemeteries, to identify missing men, and to build memorials to the war and their losses. By the 1890s, the memorial movement came under the control of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) and United Confederate Veterans (UCV), who promoted the \\"Lost Cause\\". Making meaning after the war was another way of writing its history.Blight, David, Race and Reunion: Civil War in American Memory, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2001, pp. 258‚Äì260. In 1895, in one of their successes, a Confederate monument was erected near the University of Louisville campus. =Post-Reconstruction= Churchill Downs in 1901 James Callahan and other area businessmen organized the Louisville, Harrods Creek and Westport Railway in 1870 and continued construction through the Long Depression before failing in 1879. Although the LHC&W; never reached beyond Harrods Creek, its service was continued by the L&N; and contributed to growth in the city's eastern suburbs, particularly after the LRC purchased and electrified the track between Zorn Avenue and Prospect in 1904. The first Kentucky Derby was held on May 17, 1875, at the Louisville Jockey Club track (later renamed to Churchill Downs). The Derby was originally shepherded by Meriwether Lewis Clark, Jr., the grandson of William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and grandnephew of the city's founder George Rogers Clark. Ten thousand spectators were present at the first Derby to watch Aristides win the race. A giant baseball bat adorns the outside of Louisville Slugger Museum in downtown Louisville On February 2, 1876, professional baseball launched the National League, and the Louisville Grays were a charter member. While the Grays were a relatively short-lived team, playing for only two years, they began a much longer lasting relationship between the city and baseball. In 1883, John \\"Bud\\" Hillerich made his first baseball bat from white ash in his father's wood shop. The first bat was produced for Pete \\"The Gladiator\\" Browning of the Louisville Eclipse (minor league team). The bats eventually become known by the popular name, Louisville Slugger, and the local company Hillerich & Bradsby rapidly became one of the largest manufacturers of baseball bats and other sporting equipment in the world. Today, Hillerich & Bradsby manufactures over one million wooden bats per year, accounting for about two of three wooden bats sold worldwide. In 1877 the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary relocated to Louisville from Greenville, South Carolina, where it had been founded in 1859. Its new campus, at Fourth and Broadway downtown, was underwritten by a group of Louisville business leaders, including the Norton family, eager to add the promising graduate-professional school to the city's resources. It grew quickly, attracting students from all parts of the nation, and by the early 20th century it was the second largest accredited seminary in the United States. It relocated to its present campus on Lexington Road in 1926. In February 1882, Oscar Wilde lectured in the city and on that occasion met Emma Speed Keats, the niece of his poetical hero (John Keats), who had settled in the city. She was the daughter of Keats' brother George Keats and she later sent Wilde an autograph manuscript by Keats of his poem 'Sonnet on Blue'. On August 1, 1883, U.S. President Chester A. Arthur opened the first annual Southern Exposition, a series of World's Fairs that would run for five consecutive years adjacent to Central Park in what is now Old Louisville. Highlighted at the show was the largest to-date installation of incandescent light bulbs, having been recently invented by Thomas Edison, a former resident. Columbia Building was the tallest building in Kentucky for a decade Downtown Louisville began a modernization period in the 1890s, with Louisville's second skyscraper, the Columbia Building, opening on January 1, 1890.Kleber, p. 212. The following year, famous landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted was commissioned to design Louisville's system of parks (most notably, Cherokee, Iroquois and Shawnee Parks) connected by tree-lined parkways. Passenger train service arrived in the city on September 7, 1891, with the completion of the Union Station train hub. The first train arrived at 7:30 am. Louisville's Union Station was then recognized as the largest train station in the South. Interrupting these developments, on March 27, 1890, a major tornado measuring F4 on the Fujita scale visited Louisville. The \\"whirling tiger of the air\\" carved a path from the Parkland neighborhood all the way to Crescent Hill, destroying 766 buildings ($2 million worth of property) and killing an estimated 74 to 120 people. At least 55 of those deaths occurred when the Falls City Hall collapsed. This is one of the highest death tolls due to a single building collapse from a tornado in U.S. history. In 1893, two Louisville sisters, Patty and Mildred J. Hill, both schoolteachers, wrote the song \\"Good Morning to All\\" for their kindergarten class. The song did not become popular, and the lyrics were later changed to the more recognizable, \\"Happy Birthday to You\\". This is now the most performed song in the English language. Also in 1893, the Louisville Presbyterian Seminary was founded, building a handsome campus at First and Broadway downtown (now occupied by Jefferson Community College). Eight years later, it absorbed an older Presbyterian seminary in Danville, Kentucky. In 1963 Louisville Seminary relocated to a modern campus on Alta Vista Road near Cherokee Park. 20th century and beyond=Early 20th century= Louisville, Kentucky, ca. 1910 In the early 20th century, controversy over political corruption came to a head in the 1905 Mayor election, called the most corrupt in city history. An anti-corruption party unique to Louisville, called themselves the Fusionists, briefly emerged at this time. Democratic boss John Whallen succeeded in getting his candidate, Paul C. Barth, elected, but the results were overturned in 1907. Elections gradually became less corrupt, but political machines would still hold considerable power for decades. The Waverly Hills Sanatorium was opened in 1910 to house tuberculosis patients. The hospital was closed in 1961. It was later used as a retirement home (1963‚Äì1982). It was unused for more than a decade until 1991, when it was reopened for tours. During World War I, Louisville became home to Camp Taylor. In 1917, the English-bred colt \\"Omar Khayyam\\" became the first foreign-bred horse to win the Kentucky Derby. Two years later, in 1919, Sir Barton became the first horse to win the Triple Crown, though the term for the three prime races did not come into use for another 11 years. In 1920, Louisville's first zoo was founded at Senning's Park (present-day Colonial Gardens), next to Iroquois Park. Barely surviving through the Great Depression, it closed in 1939. Its successor, the current Louisville Zoo, did not open until 1969.Kleber, p. 803. In 1923, the Brown Hotel's chef Fred K. Schmidt introduced the Hot Brown sandwich in the hotel restaurant, consisting of an open-faced \\"sandwich\\" of turkey and bacon smothered with cheese and tomato. The Hot Brown became rather popular among locals and visitors alike, and can be ordered by many local restaurants in the area today. The Belle of Louisville, today recognized as the oldest river steamboat in operation, came to Louisville in 1931. That same year, the Louisville Municipal College for Negroes was established to allow black Louisvillians to attend classes. (The college was dissolved into the University of Louisville with the ending of segregation in 1951.) Louisville during the Ohio River flood of 1936; the following year's flood was even worse. On March 28, 1936, the river reached a level of 60.6 feet, flooding parts of the city. In late January and February 1937, a month of heavy rain throughout the Ohio River Valley prompted what became remembered as the \\"Great Flood of '37\\". The flood submerged about 70 percent of the city and forced the evacuation of 175,000 residents. In Louisville, 90 people died. At the crest on January 27, 1937, the waters reached above flood level in Louisville. Photojournalist Margaret Bourke-White documented the flood and its aftermath in a series of famous photos. Later, flood walls were installed to prevent another such disaster. Standiford Field was built in Louisville by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1941. Bowman Field, a smaller airport, had been previously opened in 1919. Louisville was a center for factory war production during World War II. In May 1942, the U.S. government assigned the Curtiss-Wright Aircraft Company a war plant located at Louisville's air field for wartime aircraft production. The factory produced the C-46 Commando cargo plane, among other aircraft. In 1946 the factory was sold to International Harvester, which began large-scale production of tractors and agricultural equipment. Otter Creek Park was given to Louisville by the U.S. Government in 1947, in recognition of the city's service during World War II. Throughout the 20th century, the arts flourished in Louisville. The Speed Art Museum was opened in 1927 and is now the oldest and largest museum of art in Kentucky. The Louisville Orchestra was founded in 1937. In 1949 the Kentucky Shakespeare Festival was begun, and today it is the oldest free and independently-operating Shakespeare festival in the United States. The Kentucky Opera was started in 1952, and the Louisville Ballet was founded that same year, though it only achieved professional status in 1975. In 1956 the Kentucky Derby Festival was started to celebrate the annual Kentucky Derby. The next year, in 1957, the St. James Court Art Show was started. Both these are still popular festivals in the region. =Decline in mid-century= Eight whiskey distilleries opened on 7th Street Road after the end of prohibition, and Louisville attempted to annex them to increase its tax base. Not wanting to pay city taxes, the whiskey companies persuaded the Kentucky General Assembly to pass the Shively Bill, which made it much more difficult for Louisville to annex additional areas. The distilleries used Kentucky's existing laws (which favored the mostly rural communities in the state) to form a square-mile city named Shively in 1938. Shively grew to include residential areas. In 1946 the General Assembly passed a law allowing the formation of a Metropolitan Sewer District, and Louisville's Board of Aldermen approved its creation a few months later. With the expansion of sewer service outside of traditional city limits and laws hindering Louisville's annexation attempts, areas outside of the city limits that were developed during the building boom after World War II became cities in their own right. This status prevented their annexation by Louisville. As a result, Louisville's population figures leveled off. The incorporation of such several new communities contributed to the defeat of Louisville's attempt to merge with Jefferson County in 1956. Louisville continued fighting to annex land to grow. 800 Apartments was Louisville's first modern high rise. For a variety of reasons, Louisville began to decline as an important city in the 1960s and 1970s. Highways built in the late 1950s facilitated movement by the expanding middle class to newer housing being developed in the suburbs. With the loss in population, the downtown area began to decline economically. Many formerly popular buildings became vacant. Even the previously strong Brown Hotel closed its doors in 1971 (although it later reopened). Fontaine Ferry Park, Louisville's most popular amusement park during the early 20th century, closed in 1969 as people's tastes for entertainment changed. The once-strong farmer's market, Haymarket, ceased operations in 1962 after 71 years of operation. The final death-knell for the Haymarket, already in decline due to changing economic trends, was the construction of an Interstate 65 ramp through the main part of the open-air market. Not only did interstates facilitate suburban living, they sliced through older city neighborhoods and often divided them irreversibly. The Haymarket in Louisville before its closing. Another major (F4) tornado hit on April 3, 1974, as part of the 1974 Super Outbreak of tornadoes that struck 13 states. It covered and destroyed several hundred homes in the Louisville area but was only responsible for 2 deaths. It also caused extensive damage in Cherokee Park. Despite these signs of decline, a number of activities were taking place that presaged the Louisville Renaissance of the 1980s. Southeast Christian Church, today one of the largest megachurches in the U.S., was founded in 1962 with only 53 members. In 1964, Actors Theatre of Louisville was founded. It was later designated the \\"State Theater of Kentucky\\" in 1974. It has created a strong regional theater. In 1973, the racehorse Secretariat made the fastest time ever run in the Derby (at its present distance) at 1 minute 59 seconds. Excitement over him raised interest in the Derby. There were signs of revival in the 1970s. Throughout the decade, new buildings came under construction downtown, and many historic buildings were renovated. Louisville's public transportation, Transit Authority of River City, began operating a bus line in 1974. And in 1981 the Falls of the Ohio was granted status as a Federal conservation area. On the downside, in the early morning hours of February 13, 1981, sewer explosions ripped through the southern part of Old Louisville and near the University of Louisville. The cause was traced back to chemical releases into the sewer system from a nearby Ralston-Purina soybean processing facility. Louisville continued to struggle during the 1980s in its attempt to redevelop and expand. It fought with other Jefferson County communities in two more failed attempts to merge with county government in 1982 and 1983. Barry Bingham, Jr. sold the family business Standard Gravure in 1986, which sent the company into a major restructuring in the following years. The Courier-Journal was one of the papers printed by Standard Gravure. On September 14, 1989, Joseph Wesbecker, on medical leave due to mental illness and work-related stress, entered the Courier-Journal building and shot and killed eight employees, injuring another twelve before killing himself. =Civil Rights Movement= During the Civil Rights Movement in the late 1950s and through the 1960s, Louisville was affected, as it had maintained a segregated society. Civil rights groups had undertaken a variety of actions to challenge that. In addition, black neighborhoods had declined during the economic downturn of the city. Urban renewal efforts undertaken for ostensible improvements had adversely affected the center of their neighborhood.Dr. Bruce M. Tyler, KENTUCKY DESEGREGATION: AN ABSTRACT OF EVENTS, and \\"Background on the Louisville Riot, Dr. Tyler's website, University of Louisville. After national civil rights legislation had passed in 1964 and 1965, energy continued among African Americans to push for social changes. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) had for years had an office in the Parkland neighborhood, which had an African-American majority population. In Louisville, as in other cities, there was a political struggle between the NAACP and more militant activists associated with Black Power. The latter's attempt to organize people was one of the catalysts for the riot. In addition, feelings were raw because Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated less than two months before. On May 27, 1968, a group of 400 mostly African-Americans gathered for a protest in Parkland. They opposed possible reinstatement of a white officer involved in an incident where physical conflict had occurred in the arrest of two African- American men. The group was organized by the Black Unity League of Kentucky, known as BULK. BULK had announced that activist Stokely Carmichael was to come to Louisville to speak, but he had no such plans. When the crowd gathered, speakers spread rumors that Carmichael's plane had been purposely delayed; protesters got angry, and a disturbance began. The crowd's tossing bottles and looting forced the police to retreat. By midnight, rioters had looted several stores in Downtown Louisville. Cars were overturned and some burned. Mayor Kenneth A. Schmied ordered the 2,178 Kentucky National Guardsmen to help disperse the crowd. The mayor also issued a citywide curfew. 472 arrests were made during the riots, two African-American teenage boys were killed, and over $200,000 in property damage was done.Williams, Kenneth H. (1988). \\"Oh...It's Really Happening: The Louisville Race Riot of 1968\\", Kentucky History Journal, pp. 57‚Äì58. The National Guard remained in place until June 4, 1968.Downtown America: A History of the Place and the People Who Made it by Alison Isenberg (University of Chicago Press), p. 394, . Following these events, the city's demographics changed dramatically; the city became more racially segregated by neighborhoods, and more middle-class people, of both races, moved to newer housing in the suburbs. Despite the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, Louisville's public schools were still essentially segregated, especially as regional residential segregation had become more pronounced due to other economic changes. In 1971 and 1972 the Kentucky Civil Liberties Union, Legal Aid Society, and NAACP filed suit in federal court to desegregate the Louisville and Jefferson County school systems. The Kentucky Commission on Human Rights also filed suit asking that desegregation be achieved through merger of the Louisville, Jefferson County and Anchorage school systems, to overcome residential segregation and the inability of the city to expand by annexation and take in a more diverse area. By February 28, 1975, the state Board of Education ordered the merger of the Louisville and Jefferson County schools systems effective April 1, 1975. On July 17, 1975, Judge James F. Gordon stipulated that a desegregation plan would be implemented at the beginning of the 1975‚Äì76 school year, to begin September 4, 1975. The school system used mandatory busing to distribute students to integrate the newly merged school systems. The students were bused according to the first initial of their last name and their grade level. The busing was to achieve certain percentages of racial diversity in schools regardless of where the students lived. In practical effects, the plan required black students to be bused up to 10 of their 12 years in school, and white students 2 of their 12 years. In 1978 the judge ended his supervision of the project, but the decree remained in effect in some places. The school system continued the busing system. In the mid-1980s, the school system restructured the plan to try to provide for more local schooling for students. Guidelines remained in effect for percentages of the student population based on ethnicity. =Revitalization efforts= Since the 1980s, Louisville has had a revival in popularity and prosperity. This can be seen in the many changes in this period, including a great deal of downtown infrastructure. The Louisville Waterfront Park features gentle hills, spacious lawns, and walking paths along Louisville's waterfront in the downtown area The retail environment changed here and across the country. Woolworth went out of business in 1990. The building in Louisville, designed by architect Frederick W. Garber and completed in 1946, was demolished in 2004. The site was not redeveloped at the time, but paved for a parking lot. Many cultural showcases were founded or expanded in this period. The Kentucky Center for the Arts was officially dedicated in 1983. In 1984 the center hosted one of the U.S. presidential election debates between candidates Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale. Today the Center hosts many touring plays and performances by the Kentucky Opera and the Louisville Ballet. An IMAX theater was added to the Kentucky Science Center in 1988. Phase I of the Louisville Waterfront Park was completed in 1999, and Phase II was completed in 2004. Though originally built as a standard movie theater in 1921, the Kentucky Theater was reopened in 2000 as a performing arts venue. In 1988, the Louisville Falls Fountain, the tallest computerized fountain in the world, began operation on the Ohio River at Louisville. Its high spray (later reduced to due to energy costs) and fleur- de-lis patterns graced Louisville's waterfront until the fountain was shut down in 1998. The headquarters of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the largest Presbyterian denomination and a pillar of the religious \\"main line,\\" moved to Louisville in 1988. The move was the result of a concerted campaign, led by Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary president John Mulder, Louisville mayor Jerry Abramson, and with a gift of waterfront buildings from Humana founder David Jones.William Weston, \\"A Kentucky Home\\" [on the headquarters of the Presbyterian Church (USA) in Louisville]. Kentucky Humanities, 2001 nos. 1 & 2 (appeared March 2002): 45 ‚Äì 50. In communications, The Courier-Journal, Louisville's primary local newspaper, was purchased in 1987 by media giant Gannett. The Louisville Eccentric Observer (LEO), a popular alternative newspaper, was founded in 1990. Velocity was later released by the Courier-Journal to compete with the LEO in 2003. The Muhammad Ali Center, alongside Interstate 64 on Louisville's riverfront In 2003, the city of Louisville and Jefferson County merged into a single government named Louisville-Jefferson County Metro Government. This merger made Louisville the 16th or 27th most populous city in the U.S., depending on how the population is calculated. The change enabled consolidation of some services and activities to provide better government for the region. New changes and growth continued in the city. The entertainment and retail district called Fourth Street Live! was opened in 2004, and the Muhammad Ali Center was opened in 2005. Between the 1990 Census and 2000 Census, Louisville's metro area population outgrew that of Lexington by 149,415, and Cincinnati's by 23,278. Preservation and presentation of Louisville history : See also: Louisville museums and interpretive centers covering regional history Since 1884, The Filson Historical Society (originally named the Filson Club), with its extensive collections, has led the way in preserving Louisville's history, and publishes articles in its quarterly journal. The University of Louisville and the Louisville Free Public Library have also maintained extensive historical collections. As of 2016, Louisville did not have a museum dedicated to the city's history. Various museums and historic homes present exhibits that interpret this history. These include the Filson, Portland Museum, Historic Locust Grove, Falls of the Ohio State Park interpretive center (Clarksville, Indiana), Howard Steamboat Museum (Jeffersonville, Indiana), Carnegie Center for Art & History (New Albany, Indiana), and the Thomas D. Clark Center for Kentucky History (Frankfort). In 2004 The Frazier History Museum, previously known as the Frazier Historical Arms Museum and the Frazier International History Museum opened a history museum located on Museum Row in the West Main District of downtown Louisville, Kentucky.

Mai oder Konrad reitet in die S√ºdsee in German, its original language) is a novel by Erich K√§stner, first published in 1931. Unlike most of K√§stner's other works - set in a completely realistic contemporary Germany - the present book is a work of fantasy and satire. In his preface to the 1928 Emil and the Detectives K√§stner recounts that he intended to write a humorous South Sea adventure story, but got stuck with the concrete details and finally followed the advice of a friend to write instead a book set in the familiar Berlin reality. Several of the plot details and characters briefly mentioned where K√§stner describes his aborted fantasy were taken up in \\"35th of May\\", written four years later. Plot introduction The novel is about Conrad, a young boy, who spends each Thursday afternoon with his uncle, Mr. Ringelhuth. One Thursday ‚Äî it happens to be the 35th of May ‚Äî they meet Negro Caballo, a black horse that can speak, is well-versed in German literature, and at the same time, is the best roller skater in the world. Together they enter Mr. Ringelhuth's huge wardrobe, which stands in the hallway, and end up in a series of magical lands, starting with the land of Cockaigne (\\"free entry ‚Äî children half price\\"), followed by a mediaeval castle complete with jousting, an upside-down world in which children send bad parents to reform school, a science fiction nightmare city with mobile phones and moving walkways, and a South Sea island. On his return to the real world, Conrad writes a school essay about his experiences. The plot device of a magic wardrobe through which the characters enter magical lands anticipates the similar device used by C. S. Lewis in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and, earlier, in the 1912 short story by E. Nesbit, \\"The Aunt and Amabel\\" ‚Äî in which a girl enters a magic world through a wardrobe.

It is owned by the Minnesota Department of Transportation. It is shared by the rural communities of Piney, Manitoba and Pinecreek, Minnesota. Also known as Pinecreek/Piney Pinecreek Border Aerodrome, it is one of six airports that cross the Canada‚ÄìUS border, the only one with a paved runway, and the easternmost. The other airports, east to west, are International Peace Garden Airport, Coronach/Scobey Border Station Airport, Coutts/Ross International Airport, Whetstone International Airport (Del Bonita/Whetstone International Airport), and Avey Field State Airport. The airport, located at , was originally located entirely within the United States. Needing to extend the runway, the owners found it could not be extended south due to a nearby road, but the land to the immediate north was unused. After arrangements were made with Canadian and Manitoba authorities, the runway was extended across the 49th parallel. The airport, located in Manitoba and Minnesota, has both United States and Canada customs services and is attractive to tourists, hunters and fishermen. Ground access is available on Manitoba Highway 89 and Minnesota State Highway 89. The airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). CBSA officers at this airport can handle general aviation aircraft only, with no more than 15 passengers. History An airport for the town of Pinecreek was proposed by resident Eugene Simmons in 1949, to expedite cross-border general aviation traffic. The airport initially opened on July 29, 1953, with a runway terminating just before the international border. To allow operation of larger aircraft, a 1150-foot extension was proposed in 1972. However, this had to cross the US- Canadian border and required extensive negotiation between local and national governments. The extended runway and bi-national airport was dedicated on July 28, 1978.https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/28/archives/border-airport-overcomes- gophers-and-bureaucracies-killdeer.html Border Airport Overcomes Gophers and Bureaucracies, Andrew H.

Between 1971 and 1986 he was a member of the celebrated Argentine group Les Luthiers, with which he acted as composer, comedian, singer, and performer on more than twenty instruments, some of which he created himself. Before separating from the group, he was involved in individual projects as composer ‚Äì including a soundtrack, a quartet for clarinet and strings, a string sextet and a symphonic poem for viola and orchestra. In 1988 he founded the La Banda El√°stica (The Elastic Band), gathering some of the most outstanding Argentine jazz musicians. The band dissolved in 1993. Since then he has developed several musical and comedy projects, and performed as an orchestral conductor. Background He is Jewish.Trauma, Memory and Identity in Five Jewish Novels from the Southern Cone By Debora Cordeiro Rosa p.42  Training and career  As a child, he studied piano and, in his teens, as he became interested in jazz, the clarinet. In 1965 he graduated as an architect from the University of Buenos Aires's Architecture and Urbanism School, where he worked also as a teacher on special-structures design. In parallel, he continued his musical studies with Professor Erwin Leuchter. In January 1971 he put architecture aside and devoted himself to music. During the following years he resumed musical studies with Jos√© Maranzano, and quite later he took up orchestral conducting with Carlos Calleja.  Les Luthiers  In March 1971 he became a member of Les Luthiers, replacing Marcos Mundstock as presenter as well as performer on several both formal and informal instruments. As a composer, his first work for the group was a jazz piece for informal instruments: Tristezas del Manuela (Manuela¬¥s Blues). Upon Mundstock\`s return in 1972, Acher was asked to stay as actor, composer, arranger and multi-instrumentist. He was the motor behind the group¬¥s collective format, and in the use of amplification with a view to the new, larger venues in which they were eventually to play. Through his friend Alfredo Radoszynski, who at the time headed the legendary Trova recording label, Acher promoted the group¬¥s recording activity as a means to reach larger audiences. Some of his works are: a cycle of jazz pieces with single-vowel titles (a joint idea with Carlos N√∫√±ez Cort√©s), Miss Lilly Higgins, Bob Gordon, Papa Garland, Pepper Clemens and Truthful Lulu; his folk pieces La yegua m√≠a, A√±oralgias and Epopeya de los quince jinetes; Teresa y el Oso (Theresa and the Bear), a symphonic poem for narrator and the informal- instruments ensemble, parodying Prokofiev¬¥s Peter and the Wolf, and transcribed in 1976 for narrator, informal instruments and symphonic orchestra; Quartet Op. 44 for five players, and the Cantata de Don Rodrigo, in cooperation with Jorge Maronna and Carlos L√≥pez Puccio. His most celebrated main roles are that of Don Rodrigo in the Cantata, the king in El rey enamorado (The lovesick king), and the ‚Äúlittle brat‚Äù in La gallina dijo Eureka (Eureka, said the hen). The instruments designed and built by Acher include the ‚Äúvalve gom-horn‚Äù, the ‚Äúgom-horn da testa‚Äù and the ‚Äúkalephone‚Äù. He also collaborated with N√∫√±ez Cort√©s in the ‚Äúglamocot‚Äù (which can be heard inTheresa and the Bear) and the ‚Äúclamaneus‚Äù, which has never been introduced, and with Carlos Iraldi in designing Antenor, the musical robot in the 1979 show Muchas gracias de nada (Much ado with nothing at all). On top of his talents as composer, arranger and his remarkable ability at different instruments, such as clarinet, bass clarinet, French horn, trombone, piano, accordion, drums and other percussion instruments, plus half a dozen of assorted informal instruments, he was quite expert in approaching different genres and styles. Besides his activity with Les Luthiers, he composed the soundtrack for Carlos Jerusalinsky¬¥s medium-length film Caja de sorpresas (Jack-in-the-box), based on a short story by Ray Bradbury, which received several awards at the 1976 Uncipar Festival, and had his String Sextet performed at the 1978 Contemporary Music Festival at Santiago, Chile, as well as Molloy, a symphonic poem for viola and orchestra, with soloist Marcela Mag√≠n and the Buenos Aires Philharmonic under maestro Pedro I. Calder√≥n, in 1980. After his extensive stint with Les Luthiers, he quit the group for reasons that have remained unclear. Acher¬¥s diplomatic explanation is that ‚ÄúLes Luthiers is a multiple marriage, and gentlemen do not ask spouses what went on in their marriage.‚Äù  The Elastic Band  In early 1988 Acher brought together some of the best Argentine jazz musicians in La Banda El√°stica (The Elastic Band). Its members included Carlos Costantini (trumpet, flugelhorn, keyboards, bass, vocals, composing and arrangements), Hugo Pierre (alto & soprano saxophone, clarinet), Enrique Varela (tenor & soprano sax, clarinet, vocals); Ernesto Acher (trombone, baritone sax, clarinet, bass clarinet, French horn, piano, vocals, composing and arrangements), Jorge Navarro (piano, keyboards, percussion, vibraphone, vocals), Ricardo Lew (guitars, bass, percussion, composition and arrangements); Juan Amaral (bass, guitar, vocals), Enrique Roizner (drums, percussion). The group¬¥s idea was to approach all genres, from jazz to Argentine folk songs, with both physical and musical humour, and a certain jazzy flavour, which led famous trombone player (and chef) Christian Kellens to assert that \\"What you do is like a ministry, ¬¥cause you do jazz all the time, and people enjoy it without perhaps realizing\\". Another important feature is that the players¬¥ multiple abilities enabled them to approach nearly any given genre from different instrument combinations. Their first performance, in June 1988, at the Cervantes Theatre, Buenos Aires, was widely acclaimed by audience and critics alike. It was followed by greatly successful seasons in Buenos Aires (Blanca Podest√°, Lorange, and del Globo Theatres), and Mar del Plata (Las Estrellas and Col√≥n Theatres), Then came three recordings and a chockfull of awards, plus performances in other Argentine cities, Montevideo (Uruguay), S√£o Paulo (Brazil), and Asunci√≥n (Paraguay). In 1991 Acher conceived and organised a show called Together in concert, with The Elastic Band and Camerata Bariloche, Argentina¬¥s most celebrated chamber ensemble. It was a resounding success at the Opera Theatre and Luna Park. The group disbanded in 1993.  Other projects  Later in 1993, Acher performed for the first time as a stand-up comedian in Humor, con Acher (Humour with Acher); he also presented his radio programme Los rincones de Acher (Acher¬¥s corners) over FM Del Plata, later over Radio Cl√°sica, FM Palermo, and a few years after that over Radio Universidad de Concepci√≥n (Concepci√≥n, Chile) and Radio Universidad de Chile (Santiago, Chile). Also that year he performed the first version of his Veladas espeluznantes (Creepy soir√©es), combining repertoire works with musical jokes, conducting the Rosario Symphony Orchestra, Argentina, with the participation his friends Daniel Schapiro and Carlos N√∫√±ez Cort√©s for the occasion. New versions were performed in C√≥rdoba, Mendoza, Rosario, Bah√≠a Blanca (Argentina) and Concepci√≥n, Santiago and Antofagasta (Chile). In 1995 Acher founded the \\"Offside Chamber Orchestra\\", a miniature (23 member) symphonic ensemble specialising in a variegated repertoire, from musical jokes to regular symphonic pieces in reduced arrangements. He participated in countless private events and during a season at the then reopened Lassalle Theatre, Buenos Aires. In 1997, together with his friends, and most celebrated jazz pianists, Jorge Navarro and Rub√©n ‚ÄúBaby‚Äù L√≥pez Furst, he presented Gershwin, el hombre que amamos (Gershwin, the man we love), with arrangemens by himself and L√≥pez Furst; the show combined the piano duo of Navarro-L√≥pez Furst with a symphony orchestra, pairing the highest symphonic jazz standards. After two initial presentations at the Avenida Theatre in Buenos Aires in early October, the show stayed on through the end of November, to be repeated the following years in Buenos Aires, C√≥rdoba, Santa Fe and Mar del Plata (Argentina) and S√£o Paulo (Brazil). It ended abruptly in July 2000 with L√≥pez Furst¬¥s death, which precluded an eventual performance in Los Angeles (USA) with the American Jazz Philharmonic. In 1998 Polygram issued a live recording of the 1997 concert, whilst in September 2010 an album was released including a DVD of that concert plus a CD recording of the first (1986) concert by the Navarro-L√≥pez Furst duo. In 1999, after some chamber music projects, Acher, as arranger and conductor, along with his friend Jorge de la Vega (solo flutist of the Colon Theatre Orchestra) as soloist, presented Los animales de la m√∫sica (Music animals) with a forty- member orchestra. The constant pranks between the twain in a humorous and subtle musical context were found highly amusing by both children and grown- ups. Following a successful stint at the Avenida Theatre, the show was again performed at the San Martin Theatre. In 2005, after a short interval, the show made a dashing comeback to the Colon Theatre with more than twenty sold-out performances, and was repeated in C√≥rdoba and Bah√≠a Blanca (Argentina), Asunci√≥n (Paraguay) and still is going on. A revised version of the Gershwin project was presented with Jorge Navarro trio and orchestra during the 2006 Easter at the Wine Festival in Mendoza, Argentina. The success led to further performances at the Colon, Coliseum and Opera Theatres in Buenos Aires, the San Martin Theatre in Tucuman, and the Campana Jazz Festival in Buenos Aires province. After having lived for a little over a year in C√≥rdoba, Acher moved to Chile, initially to Concepci√≥n, later to Santiago and since 2013 he resides in Linares, 300 km south of Santiago. While in Concepci√≥n, he accomplished new projects such as Tribute to Piazzolla, for chamber orchestra, first performed by members of the University of Concepci√≥n Symphony Orchestra, and in later years by the Chamber Orchestra of Chile and the School of Modern Music Chamber Orchestra. In 2003 he premiered his Fantasy in Concert, combining five sequences from Disney¬¥s film and live music, and in 2004 his The Orchestra Goes to School, a symphonic/didactic concert, both with the University of Concepci√≥n Symphony Orchestra. Before leaving for Santiago, he presented Acher en serio? (Acher‚Ä¶ seriously?), conducting a chamber ensemble with works by Jobim, Schreker, Piazzolla and Richard Strauss. In 2006, Acher started a fruitful collaboration with Alejandro Garc√≠a \\"Virulo\\", a Cuban humourist with a long career behind him. With Virulo and two well-known Venezuelan humourists, Emilio Lovera and Laureano M√°rquez, Acher toured the Humour quartet on a single string in Mexico, Venezuela and Spain, besides a single performance in Havana, Cuba. In December 2009, Acher and Virulo presented in Havana their Symphonic pranks, combining musical jokes and orchestrated versions of Virulo¬¥s songs. Since 2006 Acher has been professor of subjects related to art and literature at the Diego Portales University in Santiago, Chile, whilst continuing with his musical and humour activity.  Present time  In November 2011 he presented in Buenos Aires his Tribute to Piazzolla, recorded and issued by Acqua Records. After a short period as Artistic Director of the Linares Town Hall in 2013, he was appointed as Resident Conductor of the 'Orquesta Cl√°sica del Maule', post which he held until December 2014. After returning in 2014 with his Symphonic pranks in Havanna and Gershwin, the man we love several times in Buenos Aires, he is planning to continue abroad these two projects in 2015 and 2016.

Orchestra and soloists are usually professionals, though their services are often donated for charity benefits. The \\"scratch\\" name derives from the idea of cooking or building from scratch. History The Great Handel Festival at The Crystal Palace, 1857 Scratch Messiah performances have their origins in the British tradition of choral societies, when large choruses of untrained amateur singers could participate in performances of large-scale concert works. Handel's Messiah was originally composed with charitable purposes in mind, having grown out of the 1749 performance of the Foundling Hospital Anthem and Handel's annual Easter performance of Messiah in the chapel of the Foundling Hospital in London. Messiah was composed so that it could be performed after a limited number of rehearsals, and thus lent itself well to the large Handel Festivals held from the 1820s onwards in Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and London. At these gatherings, large, amateur \\"scratch\\" choirs were formed from members of the public who travelled to the cities from all over Britain. Performances Such performances have become a tradition among music lovers in the English- speaking world, especially around Christmas time, and appear to be developing a following in the Netherlands and China as well. Often a \\"Sing-along Messiah\\" is organised in a concert hall or church, where a choir has rehearsed the music, but the public are invited to bring scores and join in. On a smaller scale, a Messiah party may take the form of a group of friends gathered around the piano in someone's home, and this is typically sung entirely a prima vista. Usually these are informal events, though occasionally there is a dress code: formal concert dress or even 18th century period costume. One example of a large-scale event is the \\"Do-It-Yourself Messiah\\" held in Chicago since 1976, organized by the International Music Foundation. It is held in the Harris Theater for Music and Dance. There is a volunteer orchestra and hired soloists, and the audience serves as the chorus. Similarly, CAMMAC in Canada organizes \\"Come! Sing Messiah\\" events. Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center is another large-scale annual event, with professional orchestra and soloists. It uses nearly two dozen conductors chosen from various choirs in New York City, who each conduct one selection from the work.. A similar event, among the first in the US, has been held in Lexington MA since 1962. The largest regular performance in the UK, the \\"Messiah from Scratch\\", is held annually at the Royal Albert Hall, London. This event, which now attracts more than 3000 singers each year, was first held in 1974. From 1979 until 2009, the performance was conducted by Sir David Willcocks.

The window shows characteristic themes based on Arthurian legends. Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. (1861‚Äì1875) was a furnishings and decorative arts manufacturer and retailer founded by the artist and designer William Morris with friends from the Pre-Raphaelites. With its successor Morris & Co. (1875‚Äì1940) the firm's medieval-inspired aesthetic and respect for hand-craftsmanship and traditional textile arts had a profound influence on the decoration of churches and houses into the early 20th century. Although its most influential period was during the flourishing of the Arts and Crafts Movement in the 1880s and 1890s, Morris & Co. remained in operation in a limited fashion from World War I until its closure in 1940. The firm's designs are still sold today under licences given to Sanderson & Sons, part of the Walker Greenbank wallpaper and fabrics business (which owns the \\"Morris & Co.\\" brand,) and to Liberty of London. Early years Design for Trellis wallpaper, 1862 Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., \\"Fine Art Workmen in Painting, Carving, Furniture and the Metals\\", was jointly created by Morris, Ford Madox Brown, Edward Burne-Jones, Charles Faulkner, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, P. P. Marshall, and Philip Webb in 1861 to create and sell medieval- inspired, handcrafted items for the home.Dictionary of National Biography, 1901, \\"William Morris\\" The prospectus set forth that the firm would undertake carving, stained glass, metal-work, paper-hangings, chintzes (printed fabrics), and carpets. The first headquarters of the firm were at 8 Red Lion Square in London. The work shown by the firm at the 1862 International Exhibition attracted much notice, and within a few years it was flourishing. In the autumn of 1864, a severe illness obliged Morris to choose between giving up his home at Red House in Kent and giving up his work in London. With great reluctance he gave up Red House, and in 1865 established himself under the same roof with his workshops, which by then had relocated to larger premises in Queen Square, Bloomsbury. The decoration of churches was from the first an important part of the business. A great wave of church-building and remodelling by the Church of England in the 1840s and 1850s increased the demand for ecclesiastical decoration of all kinds, especially stained glass. But this market shrank in the general depression of the later 1860s, and the firm increasingly turned to secular commissions.Charles Harvey and Jon Press, \\"The Businessman.\\" in Parry, William Morris, pp. 49‚Äì50 On its non- ecclesiastical side, the product line was extended to include, besides painted windows and mural decoration, furniture, metal and glass wares, cloth and paper wall-hangings, embroideries, jewellery, woven and knotted carpets, silk damasks, and tapestries. Morris was producing repeating patterns for wallpaper as early as 1862, and some six years later he designed his first pattern specifically for fabric printing. As in so many other areas that interested him, Morris chose to work with the ancient technique of hand woodblock printing in preference to the roller printing which had almost completely replaced it for commercial uses.Parry, William Morris Textiles, pp. 36‚Äì46. Reorganization and expansion In August 1874, Morris determined to restructure the partnership, generating a dispute with Marshall, Rossetti, and Madox Brown over the return on their shares. The company was dissolved and reorganized under Morris's sole ownership as Morris & Co. on 31 March 1875. During these years, Morris took up the practical art of dyeing as a necessary adjunct of his manufacturing business. He spent much of his time at the Staffordshire dye works of Thomas Wardle, mastering the processes of that art and making experiments in the revival of old or discovery of new methods. One result of these experiments was to reinstate indigo dyeing as a practical industry, and generally to renew the use of those vegetable dyes, like madder, which had been driven almost out of use by the anilines. Dyeing of wools, silks, and cottons was the necessary preliminary to what he had much at heart, the production of woven and printed fabrics of the highest excellence; and the period of incessant work at the dye-vat (1875‚Äì76) was followed by a period during which he was absorbed in the production of textiles (1877‚Äì78), and more especially in the revival of carpet-weaving as a fine art. The Pond at Merton Abbey by Lexden Lewis Pocock is an idyllic representation of the works in the time of William Morris. In June 1881, Morris relocated his dyeworks from Queen Square to an early eighteenth-century silk-throwing works at Merton Abbey Mills, after determining that the water of the River Wandle was suitable for dyeing. The complex, on , included several buildings and a dyeworks, and the various buildings were soon adapted for stained-glass, textile printing, and fabric- and carpet-weaving.Parry, William Morris, p. 57 In 1879, Morris had taught himself tapestry weaving in the medieval style and set up a tapestry workshop with his apprentice John Henry Dearle at Queen Square.Parry, Linda: William Morris Textiles, New York, Viking Press, pp. 103‚Äì104 Dearle executed Morris and Co.'s first figural tapestry from a design by Walter Crane in 1883.Waggoner, The Beauty of Life, p. 86. Dearle was soon responsible for the training of all tapestry apprentices in the expanded workshop at Merton Abbey, and partnered with Morris on designing details such as fabric patterns and floral backgrounds for tapestries based on figure drawings or cartoons by Burne-Jones (some of them repurposed from stained glass cartoons). and animal figures by Philip Webb. Suites of tapestries were made as part of whole-house decorating schemes, and tapestries of Burne-Jones angels and scenes from the Arthurian legends were a staple of Morris & Co. into the twentieth century. Important commissions Two significant secular commissions helped establish the firm's reputation in the late 1860s: a royal project at St. James's Palace and the \\"green dining room\\" at the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert) of 1867. The green dining room (preserved as the Morris Room at the V&A;) featured stained glass windows and panel figures by Burne-Jones, panels with branches of fruit and flowers by Morris, and olive branches and a frieze by Philip Webb. The St. James's commission comprised decorative schemes for the Armoury and the Tapestry Room, and included panels of stylized floral patterns painted on ceilings, cornices, dadoes, windows, and doors.Linda Parry, \\"Domestic Decoration.\\" In Parry, William Morris, pp. 139‚Äì140 In 1871, Morris & Co. were responsible for the windows at All Saints church in the village of Wilden near to Stourport-on-Severn. They were designed by Burne- Jones for Alfred Baldwin, his wife's brother-in-law. Standen near East Grinstead, West Sussex, was designed between 1892 and 1894 by Philip Webb for a prosperous London solicitor, James Beale, his wife Margaret, and their family. It is decorated with Morris carpets, fabrics and wallpapers. Stanmore Hall was the last major decorating commission executed by Morris & Co. before Morris's death in 1896. It was also the most extensive commission undertaken by the firm, and included a series of tapestries based on the story of the Holy Grail for the dining room, to which Morris devoted his energies, the rest of the work being executed under the direction of Dearle.Linda Parry, \\"Domestic Decoration.\\" In Parry, William Morris, pp. 146‚Äì147 Other Morris & Co. commissions include the ceiling within the dining room of Charleville Forest Castle, Ireland; interiors of Bullers Wood House, now Bullers Wood School in Chislehurst, Kent; and stained glass windows at Adcote. Last stages Merton Abbey c. 1890, from a booklet commemorating the 50th anniversary of the firm, 1911 As Morris pursued other interests, notably socialism and the Kelmscott Press, day-to-day work at the firm was delegated. Morris's daughter May became the director of the embroidery department in 1885, when she was in her early twenties. Dearle, who had begun designing repeating patterns for wallpapers and textiles in the late 1880s,Parry, Linda: William Morris Textiles, pp. 30‚Äì31 was head designer for the firm by 1890, handling interior design commissions and supervising the tapestry, weaving, and fabric-printing departments at Merton Abbey.Parry, Linda, ed.: William Morris, Abrams, 1996, p. 54 Dearle's contributions to textile design were long overshadowed by Morris. Dearle exhibited his designs under the Morris name rather than his own in the Arts and Crafts Exhibitions and the major Morris retrospective of 1899,Parry, Linda: Textiles of the Arts & Crafts Movement, Thames and Hudson, revised edition 2005, p. 122Parry, Linda: William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement: A Sourcebook, New York, Portland House, 1989, pp. 9‚Äì10 and even today many Dearle designs are popularly offered as \\"William Morris\\" patterns. On Morris's death in 1896, Dearle became the art director of the firm, which changed its name again, to Morris & Co. Decorators Ltd., in 1905. The company was still making good-quality stained glass into the 1920s: Holy Trinity Church, Elsecar, has several Morris & Co. windows dated 1922. Dearle managed the company's textile works at Merton Abbey until his own death in 1932. The firm was finally dissolved in the early months of World War II.

Enrique's is a well known Mexican restaurant in the terminal. Scheduled passenger flights on Great Lakes Airlines to Denver and Dodge City ended in August, 2006. The service was subsidized by the Essential Air Service program.  History  The airport opened in November 1938 with a single concrete runway. The United States Army Air Forces took over the facility in the summer of 1941 and used it as part of the British Flying Training School Program. This training was part of the Lend-Lease act where Royal Air Force flying cadets received a 20-week basic flying course taught by civil contractors. The Darr School of Aeronautics provided flight training. Fairchild PT-19s were the primary trainer at the airfield, but PT-17 Stearmans and P-40 Warhawks were also assigned to training. In November 1942, Royal Air Force training ended at Miami and the airfield became a primary (stage 1) pilot training airfield assigned to AAF Flying Training Command, Gulf Coast Training Center (later Central Flying Training Command). The civil instructors were retained under USAAF control by the 323d Flying Training Detachment. Pilot training at the airfield apparently ended on May 30, 1944, with the reduced demand for new pilots. The airfield was returned to the local government at the end of the war. Airline flights began in the 1930s, on Braniff. From the early 1950's well into the 1960's, the airport was served by Central Airlines.  Facilities Ponca City Regional Airport covers 500 acres (202 ha) at an elevation of 1,008 feet (307 m). Its one runway, 17/35, is 7,201 by 150 feet (2,195 x 46 m) concrete. In the year ending August 26, 2008 the airport had 61,500 aircraft operations, average 168 per day: 93% general aviation and 7% military. 64 aircraft were then based at this airport: 91% single-engine, 5% multi-engine, 3% jet, and 2% ultralight. There are multiple hangars on the grounds, and the Northern Oklahoma Flight Academy is based there.

Williams died in practice at Mines Field, Los Angeles on September 11, 1928.http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v007/v007p487.html Charles Lindbergh, for whom the three had served as escorts, filled in following Williams death. Two weeks later, W. L. Cornelius died when his plane collided with another plane. On January 20, 1933, Bert Woodring fell 2,000 feet to his death over Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, when his Consolidated P-30 fighter exploded in mid-air.

Joe: A Real American Hero toyline, comic books, and animated series. He is one of the main villains in the Marvel Comics series G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero as the leader of the Dreadnoks, and a mercenary who often worked directly for Cobra Commander. His character was voiced by Zack Hoffman in the 1985 TV series, and he was portrayed by Arnold Vosloo in the live-action film, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra and its 2013 sequel, G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Profile Zartan is a master of make-up and disguise. Very little is known of his background, but he is suspected to have received European military academy training at St. Cyr. Zartan can alter his skin color at will to blend in with his environment, and is a practitioner of several mystic martial arts. He is also a ventriloquist, a polyglot (speaking over 20 languages and dialects), and an acrobatic- contortionist. Zartan and the Dreadnoks have also been known to use holographic technology and other means to disguise themselves. He has a younger brother and sister, twins named Zandar and Zarana,Hasbro Heroes Sourcebook #3 (August, 2017) as well as a daughter named Zanya. The Dreadnoks are a fictional biker gang from the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero toyline, comic books and cartoon series. They are affiliated with Cobra as shock troops, offering their mercenary services as subordinates of Zartan. Toys When Zartan was originally released in the toy line, it stated on his file card that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder. After a complaint from a mental health organization, Hasbro removed this information from the file for later print runs, and was not referenced on file cards for future releases of the character. In early development, he was called Captain Chameleon. He was later named Zartan, an anagram of Tarzan, by writer Larry Hama. =Vintage= The 1984 Zartan action figure featured UV reactive plastic. In its natural state, Zartan appeared Caucasian, but when exposed to sunlight, Zartan's skin changed to a dark blue. The action figure also came with thermal sensitive stickers that were applied to Zartan's chest- and thigh-armor. These stickers changed from maroon when cold, to aqua at room temperature, and blue when hot. Zartan was sold with an accompanying \\"swamp skier\\" called the Chameleon, which also contained thermal reactive plastic. The Chameleon could be disassembled into several parts and loaded into a small cart that was included with the action figure; the cart, loaded with the vehicle's parts, would act as part of a disguise, making Zartan appear to be a parts or junk dealer. A small face mask, included in a detachable backpack, completed the disguise. The action figures for Zartan's brother Zandar and sister Zarana were also constructed of the same UV reactive plastic. Zartan was updated in 1993, as part of the Ninja Force line. A complete departure from his classic uniform, Zartan wore a leather jacket and neon green pants. Instead of a cowl, he wears a short orange mohawk on his otherwise bald head. All the Ninja Force figures were designed with a \\"real ninja move\\". Zartan was designed with a spring-action hip; if Zartan's right arm was pushed back, his upper torso turned right. When the arm was let go, the torso sprang back forward, resulting in a punching motion with the right arm. After the line was canceled in 1994, Hasbro made several attempts to resurrect A Real American Hero through repaint series. Zartan was released only once in this four-year period (1997‚Äì2001) at the tail-end. Because of difficulty obtaining the original mold, Hasbro compromised, and repainted the 1990 SAW-Viper body with a modified Zartan head. Although true to the classic look, both this figure and the Ninja Force release are unpopular reinterpretations of the character. =Modern= When Hasbro revamped the Real American Hero toyline in 2002, Zartan made an appearance as a figure again. Zartan sports his trademark hood and an open vested shirt. This figure was offered with a variety of paint schemes including with disguises in the Spy Troops line. In 2004, Zartan was redesigned again for Valor vs Venom. Trading his hood for a ski cap, Zartan is the furthest from his biker roots here, retaining only the recognizable face markings to make him stand out. =Sigma 6 figures= In a new 8\\" scale, Sigma 6 figures were heavily stylized and inspired by Japanese anime. Zartan released in the \\"Commando\\" collection in 2006, featuring his Sigma 6 outfit. A repaint of this figure was released in 2007, featuring a new version of Zartan called \\"Toxic Zartan\\" featuring a new purple uniform, and green highlights. =25th Anniversary= 2007 was the anniversary of the launch of G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, the third major reinvention of the G.I. Joe brand since 1964. To celebrate, Hasbro created new figures based on the A Real American Hero line, featuring modern sculpting with updated and increased articulation (including the replacement of G.I. Joe's trademark O-Ring construction). Zartan was unveiled at the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con, and the figure, based on designs from the Devil's Due comic series, included a removable mask and also changes color like its 1980s counterpart. A second 25th Anniversary-era figure, more closely hewing to the original figure from 1984, was released in 2008 that does not change color, but came with a scaled down version of the Chameleon swamp skier and two removable masks. Zartan was also released on the G.I. Joe Hall of Heroes Line to commemorate the 25th anniversary figures. He came with three face masks, his trademark pistol and a sniper rifle. =Pursuit of Cobra= Zartan was released in the second wave of figures for the Pursuit of Cobra line in 2010. In a review of the action figure, MTV said that Zartan \\"one of the few JOE-verse characters that weren't stripped of all their coolness in the recent film\\", though still praised the action figure for not referencing the film, calling the figure \\"all-around amazing\\". Comic series=Marvel Comics= left Zartan first appeared in issue #24 of the Marvel Comics series. He was fully introduced in G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #25 (July 1984). Zartan can imitate anyone he wishes to an exact physical and vocal likeness. Zartan was featured in issue #48, where he had been brought into The Pit, the Joe's Headquarters, disguised as an injured Joe, Ripcord. He almost escapes, by impersonating various Joes, such as Doc, Tripwire, General Hawk and Gung-Ho. Zartan is confronted by Sgt. Slaughter while impersonating Gung-Ho, as the real Gung-Ho is standing next to him. Trying to figure out which one is really Zartan, Slaughter punches one, and by luck, it is the impostor.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #48 (June 1986) Zartan eventually does escape, with the help of the Dreadnoks.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #51 (Sept. 1986) This leads to Cobra Commander's assault, which destroys the Pit.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #53 (Nov. 1986) Zartan is famous for delivering the killing blow to Serpentor during the Cobra Civil War, by shooting the Cobra emperor in the eye, with the same longbow that he used to kill the Hard Master years ago.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #74-76 (1988) After the war, Zartan leaves Cobra and the Dreadnoks, while his sister continues to work with Cobra. Zartan disguises himself as the Arashikage Blind Master, in order to mentor a boy named Tyrone.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #91 (1989) He eventually returns to Cobra Island, along with Billy, Captain Minh, and Tyrone, to expose Fred VII as an impostor pretending to be Cobra Commander. The mission is interrupted by the return of the real Cobra Commander, who traps Billy, Zartan, Fred VII, Tyrone, Captain Minh, Raptor, and several others in a landlocked freighter, which he then buries under a volcano.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #98 After several months of digging, Billy and Zartan manage to escape, while most of the others die from tainted food.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #114 =Action Force= Zartan also faced off against Shipwreck in the UK Action Force series. =Devil's Due= Zartan and his siblings, Zack and Zoe, grew up sometime during the early 1970s.1970s based on print date of comic; stating that it was 30 years ago when Zartan was a child As a child, he was diagnosed with an unknown mental health condition requiring medication. They were raised by their French actress mother and movie-mask sculptor father. They grew up in a broken home with a temperamental father.G.I. Joe Dreadnoks Declassified #1 Sometime after he began working as an assassin and mercenary, using his disguise abilities. Zartan also worked for a government agency under the name Amauri Sanderson. He underwent a top- secret French genetic experiment, which infused him with chameleon DNA, giving him the ability to blend into his background. During an arms deal with Destro, Amauri Sanderson met the leader of a motorcycle gang who was the original Zartan. Amauri joined the Dreadnoks and reunited with Zandar and Zarana. He was later approached by several Dreadnoks for the purpose of overthrowing the leader, who considered all the members expendable. When the insurrection was exposed, the leader planned to have Amauri executed by dismemberment. Zandar and Zarana incited a rival gang to attack, which gave them the opportunity to free their brother. The traitorous Dreadnoks teamed up with the rival gang, and Amauri fought and overpowered the leader and his rivals. With no one left to back him up, the leader was killed by Buzzer, Torch, and Ripper, and Amauri assumed the identity of Zartan.G.I. Joe Dreadnoks Declassified #3 =IDW= Zartan is introduced in G.I. Joe Origins. He was orphaned as a young boy, and made his way by pickpockets on the street. When he was confronted by the local police, he gave them the name \\"Zartan\\" that he saw on a movie poster behind them, eventually adopting it at the beginning of his named career. Years later, Zartan is a Cobra agent answering directly to Baroness. He was tasked with infiltrating a presidential airliner, to ensure the continued cooperation of President Rumanapar. His mission is a success, and he contacts Baroness for extraction. Displeased with Zartan, Baroness sends him to be a test subject for Destro's teleportation device. Destro sends him to assassinate Nico Mandirobilis; however, the teleportation process was not finalized, and Zartan's body quickly disintegrated.G.I. Joe Origins #16 With Zartan's complete genetic map stored in the M.A.S.S.' Relay Star Satellites, Cobra geneticist Doctor Taggac was able to brew a plasmid medium, which injected into a blank clone body, reformatted the slug into a copy of Zartan. The body was corrupt, with unstable skin lividity, numerous cancers, renal failure and more. Taggac used bio-magnetic pads to stabilize the body, and began teaching Zartan how to live again. This instruction included both physical elements and basic language and math skills. Zartan's unique biology gave him the ability to change his appearance and skin tone, a skill which Taggac attempted to keep secret from Cobra. Eventually the magnetic pads were surgically implanted beneath the skin, giving him a normal appearance. He expressed a desire to leave the lab and go to the outside world, and days later he kills a guard and poses as wait staff, to escape before anyone notices he was gone.G.I. Joe Origins #17 Cobra agents track him using a subcutaneous transmitter, but he evades them, fakes his own death, and sneaks back into the lab. He pulls a gun on Taggac, and forces him to contact Cobra Commander. Zartan negotiates his services as an assassin, and when the terms are agreed upon, he kills Taggac.G.I. Joe Origins #18 Zartan later reappeared in IDW's reboot of Mobile Armoured Strike Kommand. Here, he identifies as \\"Emil Zartan\\" and infiltrates the MASK team to steal their technology so he can sell it. Animated series=Sunbow= Zartan first appeared in the G.I. Joe mini-series \\"The Revenge of Cobra\\", along with Dreadnoks Buzzer, Ripper and Torch. He and the Dreadnoks abduct Colonel Sharp, so that Zartan can impersonate him and free Cobra Commander from prison. In the cartoon, his disguise techniques are all masks, make-up and vocal impersonating techniques. In \\"The Revenge of Cobra\\", Zartan and the Dreadnoks recover a piece of Destro's Weather Dominator, offering to sell it to the highest bidder, Cobra or G.I. Joe. Zartan is also initially able to change the color of his skin to perfectly blend in with his background. Zartan's camouflage abilities are negated by the sun, causing his skin to turn blue (much like his action figure), and weakening him significantly. However, both aspects were dropped almost immediately after the first season began. \\"Jungle Trap\\" was the last episode to showcase this particular ability. Zartan appeared throughout season one of the cartoon, and was one of the few Cobra characters to carry over to season two, along with Cobra Commander, Baroness and Destro. In the second season of G.I. Joe, he expanded the Dreadnoks to include his younger siblings, Zarana and Zandar, as well as Monkeywrench and Thrasher. The Zartan of the cartoon had a rivalry with Destro, who considered Zartan a petty criminal. He was also a more cowardly character, often fleeing battle when things turned against him. His loyalty usually lay with Cobra Commander, even after Serpentor took control of Cobra. Zartan also helped Cobra replace people with Synthoids in one episode. G.I. Joe: The Movie In G.I. Joe: The Movie, Zartan is seen being angry with Cobra Commander, for blaming his lacking courage on the troops. Zartan is given a valuable gem by Pythona of Cobra-La, so that he and his Dreadnoks will aid them in freeing Serpentor. They accomplish their task, but Zartan himself is curiously absent from then on, and is not seen during the final battle at the film's climax. =Spy Troops= Zartan appeared in the direct-to-video CGI animated movie G.I. Joe: Spy Troops, voiced by Colin Murdock.GI JOE Spy Troops voice cast, www.behindthevoiceactors.com =G.I. Joe: Sigma 6= Zartan appeared in G.I. Joe: Sigma 6. His disguise techniques are due to hologram generators in his suit. =Resolute= Zartan makes two appearances in the G.I. Joe: Resolute series. =Renegades= Zartan first appears in the G.I. Joe: Renegades episode \\"Dreadnoks Rising\\" as the leader of the Dreadnoks. He reappeares in \\"Knockoffs\\" and \\"Cutting Edge.\\" Live action films Zartan is played by Arnold Vosloo in Stephen Sommers's film G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, with a drastically different appearance than his television counterpart. He is a master of disguise, able to mimic other peoples' mannerisms and characteristics. Sent by McCullen with the Baroness and Storm Shadow, Zartan breaks into the Pit and disguises himself as a G.I. Joe Pit member. He murders Cover Girl with a knife as she reports to General Hawk, taking them by surprise. When the two Cobra agents fight their way out soon after, Zartan takes an alternate route and kills off a nearby Bedouin, donning his clothing to escape detection by Pit members. Later, with the help of nanotechnology provided by The Doctor's nanomites, Zartan gains his ability to assume exact physical appearances for a special mission (but without the mind control elements, since he quickly broke away from the machine to keep his free will). During the final battle, Zartan is sent to America using the missile crisis as a cover, where he infiltrates the White House as part of Cobra's plans for world domination, and assumes the identity of the President of the United States. Several times in the film, he whistles the tune \\"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\\", including at the end of the film, confirming that he has taken the place of the President. Vosloo reprises his role as Zartan in the 2013 sequel G.I. Joe: Retaliation, with a much larger role. According to Vosloo, Zartan is still in disguise as the U.S. president and he has the world leaders all under his thumb, war heads headed towards innocent populaces, and some new heavies on the payroll, to keep G.I. Joe at bay. Zartan orders air-strikes on the G.I. Joes and kills a majority of them. He is later revealed to have been the one who killed the Hard Master and raised Storm Shadow as a ruthless assassin. Zartan is eventually killed by his former student, at which time his guise as the President finally fades. Video games Zartan is one of the featured villains in the 1985 G.I.

It is located in the southwestern suburbs of Paris, France, from the centre of Paris. Inhabitants of Orsay are known as Orc√©ens. History There has been a village called Orsay on this site since 999, and the first church there was built in 1157. From the sixteenth century, the town and surrounding area were owned by the Boucher family, and it was in honour of this family that Louis XIV gave the quai d'Orsay its name. This is the reason that the Mus√©e d'Orsay is not in Orsay. In the eighteenth century, the family of Grimod du Fort bought the land and received the title of comte d'Orsay. In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian war, Orsay was occupied by the Prussian army. 88 young \\"Orc√©ens\\" were killed in the First World War. In 1957, largely due to the influence of Fr√©d√©ric and Ir√®ne Joliot-Curie, the Institut de physique nucl√©aire (nuclear physics institute) was opened in the Chevreuse valley, and the region, especially Orsay, became an important scientific centre. Another development was the creation of the Universit√© de Paris-Sud, whose most important faculty is the faculty of science. On 19 February 1977, a part of the territory of Orsay was detached and merged with a part of the territory of Bures-sur-Yvette to create the commune of Les Ulis. Transport Orsay is served by two stations on Paris RER line B: Le Guichet and Orsay-Ville.

In other media=Film= When The Shredder found out that the substance that mutated the Turtles had been created by TGRI (Techno-Global Research Industries), he sent his Foot Soldiers to steal the ooze and kidnap head TGRI scientist, Professor Jordan Perry. Shredder instructs Perry to use the ooze to mutate an Alligator Snapping Turtle and a Gray Wolf (kidnapped from the Bronx Zoo) which resulted in the creation of Tokka and Rahzar. However, Jordan had secretly altered the mutagen, and as a result, the two mutants had the intelligence of human infants. Shredder ordered the monsters to face him in battle, to teach them who their master was, except the infantile mutants misinterpreted the word \\"master\\", thinking it meant \\"mamma\\", and hugged him instead. Angered, Shredder ordered them to be destroyed, but Perry had sympathy for them and showed Saki their total obedience to him and that, as they were \\"playing\\" in the junkyard, partially lifting a skid steer, they had great strength. This prompted Shredder to keep them alive. Despite their low intelligence, the two mutant's incredible physical strength made them more than a match for the Turtles. On their first encounter at Shredder and Tatsu's junkyard base, the Turtles were ill-prepared and barely managed to escape when trying to save their brother Raphael from capture and rescue Dr. Perry. During the escape they trapped Tokka in a manhole from the waist down. Michaelangelo teased Tokka and tickled the bottom of the snapper's clawed feet. Later that night, Shredder let them loose in the city, telling to 'go play', which they did by tipping over cars, knocking down telephone poles, and trashing buildings. After doing a report on the devastation the next day, April O'Neil was confronted by the Foot with a message for the Turtles: If they didn't meet the Foot at a construction site near the docks that night, Shredder would set Tokka and Rahzar out again into Central Park. As many people would get hurt, the Turtles and Splinter agreed that there was no other choice but to face Shredder, regardless of their disadvantage against Tokka and Rahzar's immense strength. However, the professor had a plan; with the help of Donatello and Keno and using the contamination in the ooze that mutated Tokka and Rahzar as a basis, Dr. Perry prepared an anti-mutagen to de-mutate them, which had to be ingested. During their second encounter at the construction site, amidst a distraction, Leonardo and Michaelangelo trick Tokka and Rahzar into eating the antidote (they froze the concoction into ice cubes and then hid them in a box of donuts, which they then offered to the two mutants as the \\"ritual of the traditional pre-fight donut\\"). Rahzar and Tokka devoured some of the donuts with continued coaxing from the Turtles. Surprisingly, Rahzar, regardless of his infant-like mentality, figured that something was wrong with the situation, and crushed one of the donuts in his claw, discovering the anti- mutagen cube hidden inside. Enraged at what they assumed was an attempt to poison them, Tokka and Rahzar attacked the Turtles with Rahzar grabbing Michaelangelo by the hands and spinning him around before smashing him through a wall and into the Dockshore Club, interrupting a crowded dance concert by Vanilla Ice. As the final showdown commenced at the club, Leo and Raph were fending off Rahzar and Tokka's snapping attacks. Dr. Perry informed Donatello that carbon dioxide was essential to the demutation process and their repeated burping was slowing down what little anti-mutagen they had ingested. To speed the process back up, the Turtles knocked their foes off their feet and flat on their backs with a couple of barrels they found somewhere in the concert, and then the turtles shoved fire extinguishers into the creatures' mouths, which administered the needed carbon dioxide to reverse the mutation. Finally, the antidote took effect and the two mutants returned to their normal animal forms. What happened to them after this is unknown, though it is most likely that they could've been sent back to the Bronx Zoo. Turtles Forever During the course of Turtles Forever, Ch'rell the Utrom Shredder uses mutagen obtained from the universe of the 1987 animated series to mutate his human troops, with two of these mutated soldiers taking on forms identical to Tokka and Rahzar. However, they are later dispatched by the 2003 incarnations of Donatello and Raphael with the aid of the 1987 Party Wagon.TMNT Blog - Turtles Forever: Part 5 =Television=1987 series Tokka and Rahzar only appeared once in the seventh season of the 1987 animated series. In 1993, they were featured in the season 7 episode \\"Dirk Savage: Mutant Hunter\\". They were out-of-control mutants created when the Shredder exposed zoo animals to mutagen years earlier (whether this refers to when he created Bebop and Rocksteady or Groundchuck and Dirtbag, is not made clear). Not long after their first battle with the Turtles at the Crystal Palace Mall, they were captured by Dirk Savage. The animated versions were more intelligent and more eloquent, particularly Rahzar. Rahzar states to Tokka, \\"...You are my only friend.\\" Tokka has a very uncontrolled appetite which leads him into Dirk Savage's trap which consists of a buffet. The Snapper gets captured by the Mutant Hunter after he devours the smorgasbord. Even though Rahzar made a big deal of his friend being captured, and he was shown attacking Dirk later on, it was never shown if he ever got reunited with Tokka, even after the bad guys were defeated. Their look in the cartoon was very much like that of their action figures, made two years prior to their animated appearance. In this episode, their names were spelled Toka and Razar. Toka was voiced by Rob Paulsen while Razar was voiced by Townsend Coleman. 2012 series In the 2012 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series, Tokka and Rahzar are portrayed with drastically different origins than past incarnations. So much so that they are never seen together in this series, with Tokka's role as Rahzar's partner given to Fishface, an original character. Rahzar (voiced by Clancy Brown) starts the series as a celebrity martial artist, Chris Bradford (who bears a resemblance to Chuck Norris). But Bradford is revealed to have been secretly trained by Shredder, who gave his student a twisted version of the events of Tang Shen's death where Hamato Yoshi was the one who betrayed their friendship. Bradford grew to respect Yoshi, acknowledging he was as powerful as his master, but believed he would never go through with killing his enemy. During the first season, when Shredder arrived to New York City, Bradford is tasked to hunt down Yoshi through the turtles. He tricks Michelangelo into a faux friendship to get to them. Bradford reveals his deception when he has captured the turtle, sparking a bitter hatred from him. After this plot failed to kill the Turtles and a repeated failure, the Shredder became enraged at his lieutenant's incompetence. This drove Bradford to kill the turtles even if it meant his own death when he confronts the Turtles near a Kraang mutagen bomb with fellow Foot member Xever Montes. Though the bomb was defused, Bradford was exposed to the mutagen alongside Xever. Having been previously bitten by Shredder's pet akita, Bradford became a large dog mutant with increased strength that Michelangelo dubbed Dogpound as he was a dog who always pounded them into the ground. Despite his attempts to redeem himself, expressing disdain for his mutant status and lack of agility, Dogpound finds himself on the bad end of several vicious beatings from his master before replaced by Karai as Shredder's second in command. When given the takes to retrieve Baxter Stockman after he escaped the Foot's custody, Dogpound believing the scientist can turn him human again. But during an ensuing fight with the turtles, Dogpound is knocked into a mutagen vat and is painfully mutated further into a skeletal zombie-like werewolf mutant. Renamed Rahzar by Michelangelo, he takes some pride in his new form despite Shredder's initial comment that he looked terrible. When Tiger Claw is named the new second-in-command, Rahzar forms a sincere friendship with him while revealed to be third-in-command of the Foot whenever Shredder or Tiger Claw are absent. In the third-season finale, \\"Annihilation: Earth!\\", Rahzar joined in the alliance between the turtles and Foot Clan in an effort to save the world. Rahzar battled several Triceratons before watching in shock as Shredder killed Splinter in an act that doomed Earth to destroyed by the black hole generator. But in the fourth-season episode, \\"Earth's Last Stand\\", the Turtles create a new timeline when they save the Earth from the Triceratons, negating Rahzar's death in the process. When his master was mutated into the Super Shredder, Rahzar took part in the climactic clash with the combined forces of the Turtles and the Mighty Mutanimals. Rahzar ran afoul of Leatherhead, who used his massive size and strength to easily overpower Rahzar, and dragged him to the bottom of the river, drowning him. In the fifth-season episode, \\"The Forgotten Swordsman\\", Tiger Claw orders an annoyed Fishface to retrieve Rahzar's corpse from the river, and has Kavaxas resurrect him. Overjoyed at having been brought back to life, Rahzar finds himself questioning his loyalty when Hattori Tatsu arrives in New York, offering him a place as his right-hand man in his new Foot Clan. Rahzar ultimately remains loyal to the Shredder, but is repulsed and terrified when Kavaxas resurrects him as a shambling corpse. When Tiger Claw realizes that Shredder is only living to serve Kavaxas' will, it is revealed that Rahzar has suffered much of the same fate, as Kavaxas takes control of his body and refers to Rahzar as his \\"undead warrior\\". After dueling Tiger Claw, Rahzar falls into a pit to the netherworld, and is not seen again, potentially dead for good this time. In season four of the series, Tokka is introduced as a monstrous alien guardian of the final piece of the Black Hole Generator on the planet of ever-burning fire, Magdomar, of the end of the known cosmos. This version of Tokka, bearing a resemblance to Gamera with similar abilities, is asexual but is referred as female as she is the parent of Chompy Picasso, an alien turtle that Raphael becomes attached to and becomes a father to it. Lord Dregg is able to steal the Black Hole Generator piece from Tokka, who attempts to recover before being seemingly destroyed by the explosion of a dwarf star triggered by the Triceratons, though Chompy survives and remains with the Turtles. It is later revealed to have survived and angrily crash lands on Earth to find her baby whom Raphael had adopted as Chompy Picasso but decides to let Raphael take care of her baby after seeing how much they have bonded. Raphael decides to keep Chompy, though he knows the creature will eventually have to leave Earth. =Comics= Tokka and Razhar appeared in two non-canon stories in the Turtle Soup limited series. Tokka was April O'Neil's pet snapping turtle who bit Raphael and became Tokka due to Raphael's mutagen blood. Razhar was a mutated dog created by Krang. In the current TMNT comic series, published by IDW, Slash bears resemblance to Tokka. =Games= Although the old TMNT video games are based on the 1987 cartoon version of the franchise, and the first game listed here came out in 1991, two years before Tokka and Rahzar appeared on that show, the two mutants are nonetheless part of three of the games. They are in both versions of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time once again voiced by Frank Welker. In the original arcade version, they are the bosses of the pirate ship level, while in the Super NES version, they have been moved to the new Technodrome level. They are paired together as a boss fight. They can team up in their attacks in the SNES version; one of their moves involves Tokka withdrawing into his shell and Rahzar hopping on top and riding around the screen chaotically like a skateboard. Their low intelligence from the movie is also included in the game: they will often accidentally hit each other instead of the player, and will take damage for it. In the Super NES version, Tokka is also able to use an ice breath attack, while Rahzar uses a fire breath attack. Just like in the movie, when the player defeats them in the game, they de- mutate to normal animals. It is possible to attack Rahzar after he has de- mutated. He makes a 'Yelp' sound. Also, in the game, their names have the spelling of the movie, not the later spelling of the TV show. The Super NES version borrows a quote from the movie which Tokka and Rahzar said, right before the fight: \\"Master say have fun.\\" \\"FUN!\\" In the movie, they say this when they are tearing up a backstreet to lure the Turtles into a confrontation. They also made an appearance in the NES game Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project. Here the player fights them individually in separate instances. Rahzar appears in the Technodrome level immediately before Shredder, and uses an ice breath attack. Tokka appears as the boss of the rooftop level and carries a shield for blocking jump kicks. Rahzar's name is spelled \\"Rahzer\\" in the game's ending sequence. They also return in the modern remake Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Re- Shelled for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. They again are featured as a double-boss in the pirate ship level.

A friend of surgeon James Braid, he is distinguished for his contributions to the study of mental illness and epidemic diseases. Life He was a Roman Catholic, born 14 January 1810, the son of Mary Dewhurst and Edward Noble of Preston, Lancashire, a descendant of a Yorkshire Catholic family. Apprenticed to a Preston surgeon named Thomas Moore, Noble was in time admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and a licentiate of Apothecaries Hall. In 1834 he began to practise in Manchester, becoming a specialist in mental illness. Noble was President of the Manchester Phrenological Society from 1835 to 1838 but had turned away from the subject by the early 1840s, a time that coincided with his rise in social and professional status and also the general realisation that phrenology was unlikely ever to be accepted by the British Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1842 he who wrote the anonymous article titled \\"True and False Phrenology\\" in the aftermath of an address of seismic proportions, given by William Collins Engledue in 1842, that significantly split the Phrenological Association and led to Noble's own resignation from it.True and False Phenology,The British and Foreign Medical Review, Vol.14, No.27, (July 1842), pp.65-80. Noble dropped phrenological ideas completely in 1846 after criticism from William Benjamin Carpenter, who favoured the theory of brain physiology. That criticism came in a review of Noble's Brain and Its Psychology and his renunciation was formally recorded in his Elements of Psychological Medicine, published in 1853. Noble's views on mental illness influenced the terminology introduced by Henry Monro. On 9 February 1847, Noble assisted his friend, Manchester surgeon James Braid,Braid practised/resided at 67 Piccadilly Manchester, and Noble practised/resided at 105 Piccadilly. to (successfully) conduct a mastectomy, using inhalation ether as an anaesthetic agent.Note that (i) the anaesthetic agent was inhaled, rather than ingested; and, (ii) in this case, the ether was administered by Braid's, son, James Braid, MD (1822‚Äì1882). Braid was, perhaps, one of the first thirty surgeons in the U.K. ever to use inhalation ether as an anaesthetic.See Yeates, L.B., James Braid: Surgeon, Gentleman Scientist, and Hypnotist, Ph.D. Dissertation, School of History and Philosophy of Science, Faculty of Arts & Social Sciences, University of New South Wales, January 2013, pp.365, 767, 809.

KFTC is a multi-issue organization of working-class families, with a history of working for land reform, environmental justice, and low income assistance programs. In the 1980s KFTC was part of a campaign to end strip mining using the broad form deed and has since continued to provide support to the Appalachian region. Joe Szakos was one of the founding organizers. Notable accomplishments January 7, 1982, KFTC held their first meeting to develop a platform for an upcoming Kentucky General Assembly meeting, establishing a series of demands and support for legislation including an unmined mineral tax, an increase in the mining severance tax and primary support for House Bill 44. In 1988 after a series of legislative efforts pushed and supported by KFTC the broad form deed laws were amended and removed in Kentucky preventing companies from mining land without land owner's permission. KFTC has continued to encourage growth towards its platform by helping establish an unmined coal tax that provides funding for local schools. They also worked with lawmakers to cut sales tax for residents below the poverty line and further develop safe mining regulation standards and mine safety provisions.

Originally titled The Lonely Stage, the film was renamed so that audiences would know that Garland sings in it; she had not sung in a film since A Star Is Born in 1954. Although not a huge box-office success on release, the film won Garland much praise for her performance. Bogarde claimed that he had substantially rewritten Garland's lines, with her consent.John Coldstream, Dirk Bogarde, Weidenfeld & Nicolson 2004, p. 287 The film had its world premiere at the Plaza Theatre in London's West End on 6 March 1963.The Times, 6 March 1963, Page 2 Plot Jenny Bowman (Judy Garland) is a successful concert singer who regularly tours the world. During a stay in London, she visits recently widowed David Donne (Dirk Bogarde), a prominent surgeon. More than a decade ago, the two had an affair that led to the birth of Matt, who is raised by David alone and has been told that he was adopted. Although Jenny and David agreed that Matt would never know the truth, David takes Jenny to Matt's boarding school in Buckinghamshire so that she may meet him just once. Jenny and Matt hit it off and the three spend the whole day together. Jenny invites the two to her concert at the London Palladium, but David is unable to make it because of work in Rome. With David absent and under the impression that Matt is back at school, Jenny and Matt spend a few days together exploring London. Jenny's manager and assistant try to cover for Matt by calling his school, but word about his absence gets back to David in Rome, who is furious. When David returns to London, he and Jenny have a fight, during which Matt overhears that they are his birth parents. David implores Matt to remain in England and finish his schooling, while Jenny insists that Matt should accompany her on her world tour. Confused, Matt rejects Jenny's invitations and the two agree to see each other again sometime in the future. Jenny turns to a night of drinking on the town to cope with the heartbreak and ends up twisting her ankle. At a clinic, she demands that David come to treat her. When he arrives, she claims to be quitting singing as she is \\"stretched too thin and everyone wants a bite,\\" but David insists that she cannot let herself down this way and tells her that he loves her. At her concert that night, Jenny sings marvelously to the crowd. David leaves midway through her first number.

And if you aren't, forget about her new movie, I Could Go On Singing, and leave the discussion to us devotees. You'll see her in close-up...in beautiful, glowing Technicolor and striking staging in a vibrant, vital performance that gets to the essence of her mystique as a superb entertainer. Miss Garland is - as always - real, the voice throbbing, the eyes aglow, the delicate features yielding to the demands of the years - the legs still long and lovely. Certainly the role of a top-rank singer beset by the loneliness and emotional hungers of her personal life is not an alien one to her...\\", Writing in the New York Daily News, Dorothy Masters said, \\"3 stars...Judy Garland is back on screen in a role that might have been custom- tailored for her particular talents. A new song, I Could Go On Singing, provides her with a little clowning, a chance to be gay, a time for wistfulness, an occasion for tears. She and Dirk Bogarde play wonderfully well together, even though the script itself insists on their being mismatched...\\" Soundtrack A soundtrack album was released by Capitol Records at the time of the original film release.

When Selena was signed with EMI Latin, EMI president Jos√© Behar told Selena that \\"the world wanted Selena, not Selena Los Dinos.\\" Selena then began releasing her studio albums under her own logo title Selena and not Selena y Los Dinos. Before Selena was signed with EMI, the band had sold more than 80,000 copies in the state of Texas.  Band history = Beginning (1957-1981) = Between 1957 and 1971, Selena's father, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. had played with Los Dinos. He loved to play music, and persuaded Selena to play music. Although she initially complained she didn't want to, she later found that she actually loved to play. Selena herself joined the family band at the age of ten, and they turned professional two years later. Selena not only sang in some concerts that her father arranged, but she also sang in school whenever she was asked. Selena's father discovered her amazing voice, and spread musical talents (which he pursued himself in his earlier days) among his two older children: Abraham III (A.B.), was put on the bass guitar, and Suzette, was put on drums. The family first showcased their band on street corners, at quincea√±eras, and at other family gatherings until Selena's father opened up a much-needed Mexican restaurant in Lake Jackson, Texas called Pap√°gayos () in 1981. While her parents took care of the restaurant, Selena performed for the first time in public at the age of nine with her older siblings to entertain the diners. However, the restaurant began to lose its customers when the recession of 1981 hit South Texas and the restaurant was forced into foreclosure. Soon after the restaurant's closure, Selena's family moved their musical aspirations to Corpus Christi, Texas. There, Selena began to gain popularity and respect as a child singer. Within a year, the family's restaurant went bankrupt and the family was forced to move in with relatives, as Abraham had quit his job to manage the restaurant full-time. The band then performed wherever they could, including weddings, street corners, fairs, Events, and Quincea√±eras. At some places, the band began to gain a lot of appreciation, while at other performances, where Mexican Americans were not accepted, it was booed. On one occasion while performing at a wedding, the band was booed and then food was thrown on stage. = Mainstream success (1981-1988) = In 1981, Corpus Christi, Texas-based Freddie Records signed Selena y Los Dinos to a recording contract. By 1981, the label began promoting the yet-to-be released debut album by selling singles from tracks off the album in local stores. Selena y Los Dinos began to perform more frequently in local Texas clubs and fairs as their name began to spread around Texas. In 1984, Freddie released the band's very first full-length album entitled Selena y Los Dinos - Mis Primeras Grabaciones. When the album was completed, the president and owner of Freddie Records told Abraham that his band, Selena y Los Dinos, were not professionally ready to record and release a full-length album. Undeterred, Abraham dropped the record deal with Freddie Records and walked out. While still under the record deal, Selena's father came upon another small local Texas record company called Cara Records. The rumored album The New Girl in Town was never sold in stores, but singles from Cara Records were sold separately and promotionally around the state of Texas. In 1987, GP Productions, which discovered Selena y Los Dinos performing, signed the group for a yearly record contract. Selena y Los Dinos were in the recording studio soon after the agreement. That same year, Selena y Los Dinos recorded their second full-length album Alpha (A in the Greek alphabet), which was the first album to be released without legal actions or threats. In 1987, Munequito De Trapo (Rag Doll) was released and an increase in sales began to spread the news about the band, which was promoted and showcased in the Tejano Music Awards,. Selena won best \\"Female Vocalist of The Year\\", which she then won eight consecutive times. The band as well received and won awards separately. In 1987, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., who was proud of the band's winnings and awards, released And the Winner Is... and made Selena sing more Tejano and Mexican songs which followed their roots in order to gain more recognition in the Tejano world. In 1988, Selena y Los Dinos released Preciosa (Precious), a nickname that was given to Selena as a child, which sold 20,000 units in Texas alone. No other record or single sales were ever documented outside the U.S. By 1988, Selena's albums began to sell 20,000 units apiece. Selena y Los Dinos' last independent studio album was released in 1988 under the title Dulce Amor (Sweet Love). The album helped Selena to be noticed during the 1989 Tejano Music Awards by Jos√© Behar, who had just opened the Latin division of EMI Records; EMI Latin. Jose Behar recalled seeing Selena perform and the whole place \\"blew up\\" from so much excitement and enthusiasm emanating from the charismatic Selena. Soon after her performance, Behar signed Selena as a solo artist. Selena began releasing her albums with her new logo titled after her name, while the band Los Dinos was still beside Selena in concerts. = Chris P√©rez (1988-1995) = Selena's brother A.B. met Chris P√©rez in 1988 and they became friends. When one of the guitar players for the band would leave, Abraham Quintanilla Jr. would let out an open call for anyone in the state of Texas who was willing to participate with them and tour alongside the band. P√©rez was interviewed and performed for one of the open calls at Abraham Quintanilla's house. A.B., who had told Chris to come, was confronted by his father, who did not like the energy and image of Chris P√©rez, who had his own Rock band and performed entirely in the English language. A.B. insisted that P√©rez would learn the music quickly, convincing him to hire P√©rez as the new lead guitarist. P√©rez's addition to the band proved to be more than anticipated. He and Selena fell in love, but her father, who wanted to keep the band's clean-cut image, only saw envy in P√©rez. He confronted P√©rez and Selena and told them that the relationship had to end or the band would break up. P√©rez quit, while Selena stayed with the band. However, they were secretly married on April 2, 1992, and Selena added Perez's last name to hers. She tried to hide the marriage from the rest of the family, but the news quickly spread to radio stations and newscasts. The senior Quintanilla later accepted P√©rez into the family and allowed him to re-join the band. Soon after Selena's murder, P√©rez left to form the Chris P√©rez Band. He dedicated a song to his late wife, calling it \\"The Best I Can\\". The band broke up in 2002, and he joined with Selena's brother A.B. in the Kumbia Kings, 2006, Kumbia All Starz A.B. is now honoring Selena by using her name in his songs. = The Reunion: Selena ¬°Vive! (2005) = The surviving band members reunited for a historic massive tribute concert in honor of Selena on April 7, 2005. The concert, Selena ¬°VIVE!, was held at the Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas.The event not only sold out, but it became the highest-rated and most viewed Spanish-language TV special ever. In attendance were Gloria Estefan, Kumbia Kings, and an introduction by Jennifer Lopez, who portrayed Selena in the film made about her life. Suzette Quintanilla, Selena's sister, the former drum player for Selena y Los Dinos, announced that the band Los Dinos were reuniting to record a new song for A.B. Quintanilla's group Kumbia All Starz with surprise guest recording artists on the album La Vida De Un Genio.

Early life Bowers was born on 29 July 1883 in Greenock, of Scottish descent. After his father died in Rangoon, his mother alone raised him from the age of three with his two older sisters. By January 1896, the family had moved to Streatham, in South London, and lived at 19 Pathfield Road, where Mrs Bowers was still residing in 1899. Whilst living in Streatham, Bowers attended Streatham High School for Boys in Pinfold Road in 1896‚Äì7. The building survives today as the Computer Centre behind Streatham Library, on which a plaque was placed by The Streatham Society on 29 March 2012 to commemorate the centenary of his death. He went to sea first as a cadet in the merchant service, training on HMS Worcester and sailing around the world four times on the Loch Torridon.Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World, Carroll & Graf Publishers, 1922. He then enlisted in the Royal Indian Marine Service in 1905. He was appointed sub-lieutenant, serving in Ceylon and Burma, and commanded a river gunboat on the Irrawaddy. He later served on , preventing gun-running in the Persian Gulf.  Terra Nova expedition  Edward Adrian Wilson, Henry Bowers and Apsley Cherry-Garrard on Their Return from Cape Crozier. Bowers joined Robert Falcon Scott's Terra Nova expedition in 1910, after having read the accounts of Scott's earlier Discovery expedition, and of Ernest Shackleton's expedition in . He had no previous polar experience, but was recommended to Scott by the ex-President of the Royal Geographical Society, Sir Clements Markham, who had been the main organiser of Scott's earlier Discovery expedition. Markham had met Bowers aboard HMS Worcester and had been so impressed with him that Scott invited Bowers to join the expedition without a prior interview. After Bowers fell 19 feet into a hold when loading the ship (someone had carelessly left the cover off), Scott was less impressed by the short, stout young man. \\"Well, we're landed with him now, and must make the best of it,\\" said Scott, but he soon changed his mind. Originally appointed as a junior officer of the ship's party in charge of expedition stores, Bowers quickly distinguished himself as an extremely hard-working, highly skilled organiser. By the time the Terra Nova left New Zealand, Scott had promoted him to be a member of the shore party, in charge of landing, stores, navigation and the arrangement of sledging rations, a role in which his extraordinary powers of memory served Scott well. Six months after arriving in Antarctica, Bowers made the winter journey to the emperor penguin breeding grounds at Cape Crozier in July 1911 with Edward Adrian Wilson and Apsley Cherry-Garrard. The aim of the party was to secure an unhatched egg for scientific study. In almost total darkness and with temperatures ranging from , they man-hauled their sledge from Scott's base at Cape Evans to the far side of Ross Island. Frozen and exhausted, they reached their goal, only to be pinned down by a blizzard. Their tent was ripped away and carried off by the wind, leaving the men in their sleeping bags under a thickening drift of snow. When the winds subsided, by great fortune they found their tent lodged about half a mile away in rocks. Having successfully collected three eggs and desperately exhausted, they eventually arrived back at Cape Evans on 1 August 1911, five weeks after setting off. Cherry-Garrard later referred to this trip as The Worst Journey in the World, which became the title of his book published in 1922 recounting the fate of the 1908‚Äì1912 expedition. On 1 November 1911, the long trek to the South Pole began. Scott had not originally planned to include Bowers in his polar party. He had been a member of the sledge team led by Scott's second-in-command, Lieutenant Edward Evans and the last support party to accompany Scott and his team southward, but on 4 January 1912, just as Evans party was about to turn back, Bowers was assigned to the polar party. Some have argued that this seems to have been an impulsive decision by Scott, however, others, such as Antarctic explorer Ranulph Fiennes, have indicated that this was a logical decision ‚Äì particularly when one intended to increase the speed of a polar land-crossing, in an effort to reduce the consumption of resources. Only a few days earlier, he had ordered Evans' men to depot their skis, so that Bowers had to travel on foot to the pole while the others were still on skis. In addition, adding a fifth man to the party meant squeezing another person into a tent made for four, and having to split up rations that were packed in units for four men. The most likely motivation for Scott to add Bowers to the polar party was a realisation that he needed another experienced navigator to confirm their position at the South Pole to avoid controversy, such as that surrounding the claims of Frederick Cook and Robert Peary at the North Pole, although why he did not substitute Bowers for another member of the party‚Äîmost likely Oates‚Äîis not clear. To back this theory up, it was Bowers who eventually took the sights to fix the exact location of the geographic South Pole for the Polar party. It was also Bowers who was in charge of the expedition's remaining camera and took most of the famous photographs at the South Pole and at Amundsen's tent. On 16 January 1912, as Scott's party neared the Pole, it was Bowers who first spotted a black flag left at a camp made by Roald Amundsen's polar party over a month previously. They knew then that they had been beaten in the race to be first to the South Pole. On 18 January, they arrived at the South Pole to find a tent left behind by Amundsen's party at their Polheim camp; inside, a dated note informed them that Amundsen had reached the Pole on 14 December 1911, beating Scott's party by 35 days. The grave of Edward Adrian Wilson, Henry Bowers and Robert Falcon Scott. During the return journey, they first made good progress, but P.O. Edgar Evans died on 17 February, presumably of a brain injury after a fall. At the end of February, temperatures fell sharply, the dog relief team failed to show up at the prearranged meeting point on 1 March, and Oates' foot became frostbitten and gangrenous, slowing the party down; in a vain attempt to save his companions, he deliberately walked out of their tent to his death on 16 March. Scott, Bowers, and Wilson continued on for three more days, progressing more, but were stopped short of the next food depot by a blizzard on 20 March. The blizzard continued for days, longer than they had fuel and food for. Too weak, cold and hungry to continue, they died in their tent on or soon after 29 March‚ÄîScott's last diary entry‚Äî from their base camp. Their bodies were found by a search party the following spring on 12 November 1912. The search party collapsed the tent over them, thus burying them where they lay under a snow cairn topped by a cross made from a pair of skis. Among the items they found and took back with them were the Kodak film rolls with the photographs at the South Pole and geological specimens which later proved the Gondwana theory. The Bowers Hills in Antarctica, later renamed the Bowers Mountains, were named in his honour. Character and nickname Bowers was short, at five-foot four inches. He had red hair and a distinctive beak-like nose that quickly earned him the nickname of \\"Birdie\\" among his fellow explorers. He was known for his toughness, dependability, and cheerfulness. Apsley Cherry-Garrard, a fellow expedition member, remarked that his \\"capacity for work was prodigious\\", and that \\"There was nothing subtle about him. He was transparently simple, straightforward, and unselfish\\". In his diary, Scott wrote of Bowers that \\"he is the hardest traveller that ever undertook a Polar journey as well as one of the most undaunted\\". In a letter to Bowers' mother retrieved from the tent containing their bodies, Scott wrote \\"I write when we are very near the end of our journey, and I am finishing it in company with two gallant, noble gentlemen. One of these is your son. He had come to be one of my closest and soundest friends, and I appreciate his wonderful upright nature, his ability and energy. As the troubles have thickened his dauntless spirit ever shone brighter and he has remained cheerful, hopeful, and indomitable to the end.\\" Archives Bowers' life is celebrated with a small display at Rothesay Museum on the Isle of Bute, near where his mother and sister went to live; he visited them during shore leave and loved walking in the Scottish Highlands. Copies of the photographs Bowers took on the last stages of the South Pole journey were widely exhibited during the centenary of the South Pole expedition and are held at the Scott Polar Research Institute and other archives.

U.S. national computing research=1980s= The presidential Office of Science and Technology Policy in the United States set a first list of grand challenges in the late 1980s, to direct research funding for high-performance computing. A grand challenge is a fundamental problem in science or engineering, with broad applications, whose solution would be enabled by the application of high performance computing resources that could become available in the near future. Examples of these grand challenges were said to be:\\"A Research and Development Strategy for High Performance Computing\\", Executive Office of the President, Office of Science and Technology Policy, November 20, 1987 * Computational fluid dynamics for **the design of hypersonic aircraft, efficient automobile bodies, and extremely quiet submarines **weather forecasting for short- and long-term effects **efficient recovery of oil, and for many other applications * Electronic structure calculations for the design of new materials such as **chemical catalysts **immunological agents **superconductors * Plasma dynamics for fusion energy technology and for safe and efficient military technology * Calculations to understand the fundamental nature of matter, including quantum chromodynamics and condensed matter theory * Symbolic computations including **speech recognition **computer vision **natural language understanding **automated reasoning **tools for design, manufacturing, and simulation of complex systems This was partially in response to the Japanese 5th Generation (or Next Generation) 10-year project.

Joe: A Real American Hero toyline, comic books and animated series. He is best known as the Cobra Commander's ninja bodyguard, and for his history with fellow ninja Snake Eyes. Throughout their history, he has changed sides several times; conflicted in loyalties between Cobra, G.I. Joe, and his blood brother, Snake Eyes. Storm Shadow is one of the most prominent characters in the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero franchise, and has appeared in every series since its inception. He is portrayed by Lee Byung-hun in the 2009 live-action film G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, and the 2013 sequel G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Andrew Koji will portray Storm Shadow in the upcoming 2020 spin-off film, Snake Eyes. Profile In his original A Real American Hero incarnation, Storm Shadow's real name is Thomas S. Arashikage („Éà„Éº„Éû„Çπ„ÉªÂµêÂΩ±) (Arashi meaning \\"Storm\\" and kage meaning \\"shadow\\" in Japanese), a Japanese American. Storm Shadow served in the U.S. Army special operations group along with Snake Eyes, and later invited him to train as a ninja with his family in Japan. The duo have been everything to one another from the bitterest of enemies, to the most loyal of friends, who would fight and die for one another. Storm Shadow can trace his family history through thirty generations of assassins. He is an 8th degree black belt in several martial arts, and can endure unimaginable amounts of hardship and pain. Storm Shadow moves with blinding speed, can scale sheer walls with bare hands and feet, and is an expert with a long bow, katana, shuriken and nunchaku. He usually wears a white uniform and mask. When out of his uniform, he is shown to be Japanese with black hair and dark eyes. In 2007, the character's creator, Larry Hama, revealed an alternate name for the character, Tomisaburo Arashikage (ÂµêÂΩ±ÂØå‰∏âÈÉé), in the solo series Storm Shadow. His tattoo is a hexagram of the I Ching named Êó¢Êøü (j√¨ j√¨), or \\"Already Fording\\". Storm Shadow was only listed with a rank while a member of the Joe team. There are four instances where his file card provides a pay-grade: 1991, 1994, and 1997 releases all have him listed as a Master Sergeant or E-8 (the same rank as Duke), and in the 2007, 25th anniversary release, the file card lists him as E-5. Toys Storm Shadow is one of the few characters from the \\"G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero\\" line that has been released as both a member of Cobra and a member of G.I. Joe. He first appeared in 1984 as a member of Cobra, but with his second figure released in 1988, he had defected to being a member of G.I. Joe. A new version of Storm Shadow was released as part of the Ninja Force line in 1992. The figure was repainted and released as part of the \\"Shadow Ninjas\\" line in 1994. His loyalties remained with G.I. Joe until in 2000 his figure was released again as a Cobra agent. Since then, he has remained a member of Cobra. He is most often paired with his sword brother, Snake Eyes, in multi or comic packs. He has been released two times unmasked as Tommy Arashikage (once as a mail-away figure and once in a comic pack). =25th Anniversary= The year 2007 was the 25th anniversary of the launch of G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, the third major reinvention of the G.I. Joe brand since 1964. To celebrate, Hasbro created two boxed sets of brand new figures, featuring modern sculpts with updated articulation (including the replacement of G.I. Joe's trademark O-ring construction). Storm Shadow contained some new, more intricate details that the original character didn't have. He was included in the Cobra set, along with Cobra Commander, Destro, Baroness, and a Cobra Trooper. He was also included in a two-pack consisting of Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes in their original costumes, and a reissued G.I. Joe #21 comic book, Storm Shadow's first appearance in the series. He was also included in the first wave of single pack figures in his 1988 G.I. Joe urban-camouflage ninja uniform, but still contained slight differences from the 1988 character outfit, since Hasbro decided to reuse most of the tooling of the first figure; hence, he didn't have long sleeves, the placement of his arm tattoo had been moved, and he was missing the recurve bow and the calves garments (the latter of which were actually included on a Cobra-aligned figure featured in a comic pack with Firefly, along with a black backpack based on the 1988 figure's red backpack). A modified version of his 2007 figure appeared in the 2009 Hall of Heroes sub-line, as well as a new Cobra box set, featuring the sleeveless version of his original outfit as it appeared in the original comics and cartoons. =Movie tie-ins and 50th Anniversary= As a featured character in the live-action movie franchise, Storm Shadow received several figures in the respective movie-based toy lines based on his appearances in the films. In addition, as part of the G.I. Joe: Retaliation toyline in 2013, he received an \\"Ultimate\\" edition figure based on his original Cobra costume (without sleeves), featuring an additional unmasked head and numerous accessories, including a jet pack with colors and markings based on the Cobra C.L.A.W. jet glider. A budget-line figure exclusive to discount retailers was released in 2012, based on his Ninja Force costume. As part of the 50th anniversary celebration of the G.I. Joe franchise, Storm Shadow received one more release based upon his G.I. Joe urban camo outfit (although his file card and figure stand aligned him with Cobra) in a two-pack with Spirit Iron-Knife in 2015. This figure more accurately replicated the 1988 figure than the 2007 release, and used the backpack and swords from the Firefly comic-pack release, with the backpack colored red like the 1988 toy. Comics=Marvel Comics= Storm Shadow first appeared in Marvel's G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #21 (March 1984), and was created by Larry Hama. Storm Shadow served in Southeast Asia on the same Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol team as future Joes Stalker and Snake Eyes. The intense nature of this service together forged a strong friendship between him and Snake Eyes. After Vietnam, Storm Shadow visited his family in Japan. His family, the Arashikage Clan, had actually been a fierce ninja clan, but for many centuries had remained clandestine. Hoping to learn the ways of the ninja, Storm Shadow studied under the tutelage of his estranged uncle, the Hard Master. When Snake Eyes arrived in Japan following the death of his entire family in a horrific automobile crash, he was invited to study with the clan. He quickly began to surpass Storm Shadow's abilities and was the Hard Master's choice to succeed him as the head of the clan. This caused a rift between the two friends, and Snake Eyes decided that he would leave the clan. However, before he could, an assassin (who would later be revealed as Zartan) killed Storm Shadow's uncle while he was demonstrating a ninja technique. Storm Shadow, seeing the assassin fleeing in a Cobra helicopter, left the clan to follow the assassin. Due to his abrupt disappearance and the fact that the killer appeared to use a technique that Storm Shadow was a master of, Snake Eyes, the Soft Master, and the remaining clan members thought that Storm Shadow was to blame for the murder. Storm Shadow blamed Snake Eyes for the murder, as the Hard Master was using a ninja technique to imitate Snake Eyes, thus fooling Zartan into shooting the wrong target. Years passed and Storm Shadow eventually was led to the international terrorist organization Cobra. He was quickly made Cobra Commander's bodyguard and soon thereafter encountered his old friends, Stalker and Snake Eyes, as members of the American strike team, G.I. Joe, designed to destroy Cobra. Storm Shadow befriends the son of Cobra Commander, a teenager named Billy. Eventually the two escape together.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #38 After several battles with the Joes, Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes would work together to bring down the men responsible for the death of the Hard Master (Zartan, Cobra Commander, and Firefly). During their first attempt, while trying to flee Cobra Island, Storm Shadow was shot by the Baroness and believed to be dead. He was revived during Doctor Mindbender's creation of Serpentor.G.I. Joe A Real American Hero #47-50 Finally, Storm Shadow was made an official member of the G.I. Joe team and regained his honor through countless acts of courage. He would later return to Cobra after being captured and brainwashed along with several other former Cobra agents. He was frequently given continuous sessions of brainwashing to ensure his loyalty, and it took him a few years to finally shake off the programming and rejoin his sword brother, Snake Eyes. Storm Shadow participates in training the Joe's official Ninja Force. He relates to the students how he was unable to master a specific skill until he attempted to teach it; this allowed him to view the skill from different angles and ultimately master it.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #135 (April 1993) In the next issue, Storm Shadow and the Ninja Force encounter an attack from the Cobra allied mercenary force called the 'Night Creepers'.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #136 (May 1993) =Devil's Due Publishing=America's Elite When the G.I. Joe team is reactivated in Devil's Due Publishing's G.I. Joe: America's Elite, Storm Shadow is added to the team due to his expertise as a covert ops specialist and ninja. However, what proves more important to the team, is the knowledge he gained as Cobra Commander's bodyguard. While Snake Eyes and Stalker accept him as a member, fellow team member Shipwreck is the most vocal about his suspicions, considering the ninja's constantly changing loyalties.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #0 (June 2005) Storm Shadow is the first to learn of the Baroness being alive and being held in the basement of the new G.I. Joe command center, \\"The Rock\\".G.I. Joe: America's Elite #1 (July 2005) After Snake Eyes' death aboard Destro's sub, Storm Shadow assists the team in search of the body, and encounters Major Bludd in Australia.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #9 (March 2006) He finds the Red Ninja clan had raised Snake Eyes from the dead, and had used some of their ancient techniques to place Sei-Ten in the body of T'jbang.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #11 (May 2006) After stopping Snake Eyes by placing Scarlett's life in danger, Storm Shadow temporarily leaves the team to assist the Red Ninjas in rebuilding and reviving their leader to set things right.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #15 (September 2006) Storm Shadow returns to stop Cobra from liberating prisoners from the G.I. Joe prison facility \\"The Coffin\\", assisted by a mole within Cobra. He is partially successful, but Tomax manages to free Major Bludd and several others, while killing those Cobra Commander considered \\"loose ends\\". Storm Shadow then tracks down Destro and the Baroness, so that they can help disable Cobra's M.A.R.S. tech devices. They join the rest of the main team, in defeating several Cobra cells, and disarming nuclear weapons that Cobra Commander has placed in the Amazon and Antarctica.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #30-35 (2008) The seven-issue solo series Storm Shadow, written by the original writer Larry Hama, follows Storm Shadow after leaving the G.I. Joe team. =G.I. Joe: Reloaded= In the alternate continuity series G.I. Joe Reloaded, Storm Shadow is similar to his original continuity counterpart in his Cobra roots, as he serves as Cobra Commander's assassin/bodyguard. He does not wear a mask, and instead, is seen wearing a much different white uniform with a long jacket. He does face off with Snake Eyes, who in this series is his half-brother, and comments on Snake Eyes' traitorous nature. This series ended without fully exploring their relationship. Animated series=Sunbow= Unlike the comic, the Sunbow animated series never explored the relationship between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. He was often being bandied about as a counterpart to G.I. Joe member Spirit, and later on against G.I. Joe member Quick Kick. Also, he remained loyal to Cobra until the end of the Sunbow series. He was featured in the episode Excalibur, where he finds King Arthur's sword. During Season 2, he sided with Cobra Commander against Serpentor, and was seen helping the Commander in his various plots to overthrow Serpentor. =G.I. Joe: The Movie= In G.I. Joe: The Movie, Storm Shadow is seen in two frames when Serpentor yells at all the Cobra characters in the beginning. =DiC= Storm Shadow returns in the DiC-produced G.I. Joe series, but this time on the side of the Joe team and as a member of the Ninja Force, reflecting his status in both the toy-line and the comics at that time. He came to side with the Joes because the initial cartoon's storyline ended after G.I. Joe: The Movie and so the comic dictated the path of the toys. Had the series continued with a third season, Storm Shadow would still have been a Cobra. Cobra Commander makes several comments in the episode Shadow of a Doubt about Storm Shadow being a traitor. Storm Shadow claims that he only joined Cobra to find out who had dishonored his ninja clan. Aside from that, he is given little backstory in the animated series. The relationship between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow is best showcased in the Season 2 episode, The Sword, when it is shown that they both respect each other's ninja skills and abilities. Storm Shadow was voiced by Scott McNeil. =Direct to video= Storm Shadow appeared in the direct-to- video CGI animated movies G.I. Joe: Spy Troops and G.I. Joe: Valor vs. Venom, voiced by Ty Olsson. These two movies seem to ignore the previous continuity, and deal more with the continuity of the toys and cartoon at that time. Storm Shadow is again a Cobra ninja as in previous Sunbow cartoons; however, unlike previous times, he now faces Snake Eyes. In the animated short G.I. Joe: Ninja Battles, a new ninja Tiger Claw is joining G.I. Joe, and learns of Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow's past in the Arashikage clan. The rivalry between the two ninjas is explained to some degree, and it shows how they have dealt with each other to this day. Most of the movie is narration over original artwork, and some scenes from the previous movies, as well as some new footage at the end. =G.I. Joe: Resolute= In the G.I. Joe: Resolute miniseries, Storm Shadow's past is revealed as his rivalry with Snake Eyes being the result of Storm Shadow fearing his uncle would teach the seventh move of the \\"Seven Steps to the Sun\\" to Snake Eyes instead of him because of his bloodlust, and then hiring Zartan to take out their master. By present time, during the attack of the U.S.S. Flagg, Storm Shadow murders Bazooka and places a scroll marked with the Arashikage symbol that issues to Snake Eyes a final duel at their former dojo. Revealing his true reasons for hating Snake Eyes, Storm Shadow pins him down using the sixth move. However, Snake Eyes's counters reveal he, in fact, had learned the final move from their master prior to his death, using it to kill Storm Shadow. However, in the DVD release of the film, the grave that Snake Eyes buried Storm Shadow in is shown to be empty and Storm Shadow is presumably still alive. Storm Shadow was voiced by Eric Bauza. =G.I. Joe: Renegades= In the animated series G.I. Joe: Renegades, Storm Shadow is voiced by Andrew Kishino. Born Tomisaburo Arashikage, he is the cousin of Kimi Arashikage (Jinx) and nephew of the Hard Master, head of the Arashikage clan of ninja. He once trained with Snake Eyes and has had a bitter rivalry with him. The rivalry reached its zenith when Tomisaburo slipped poison in the tea cup meant for Snake Eyes as he was to talk to the Hard Master. However, without the youth's knowledge, the cups were accidentally switched and the Hard Master drank the poisoned tea. Mistaking Snake Eyes' attempt to save his uncle (via an emergency tracheotomy) as an act of cold-blooded murder, scarring him while driving him off, Tomisaburo vowed revenge while becoming acting leader of the Arashikage. Storm Shadow pursued Snake Eyes to his hidden dojo in the mountains, telling Kimi of how her father died and convincing her to reclaim her birthright. During the events of \\"Homecoming\\", Storm Shadow fought Snake Eyes on board a military train and assisted the Baroness, later infiltrating Cobra Industries and proposes an allegiance with her. Later, in \\"White Out,\\" Storm Shadow receives the Shadow Vipers from Doctor Mindbender and pursues the Joes to Canada, where he barely managed to survive being caught in an avalanche. In \\"Cutting Edge,\\" Baroness calls on Storm Shadow when a high-tech ninja is targeting Cobra Commander. Storm Shadow ends up discovering that the assassin to be Jinx, who revealed (as explained to her by Scarlett) that Snake Eyes's action against the Hard Master was actually an attempt to save him from the poison inflicting him. Hearing it, Storm Shadow leaves and later returns to help Jinx and Snake Eyes destroy a cadre of B.A.T.s. Once the fight resolved, Storm Shadow admitted to his murder attempt on Snake Eyes and how the Hard Master died as a result. Believing himself to be beyond redemption for unknowingly killing the Hard Master, Storm Shadow takes his leave. Sigma 6 In G.I. Joe: Sigma 6, Storm Shadow is Cobra's ninja master. He began his career in mainstream U.S. intelligence groups. Early on he went undercover into the Cobra organization and was brainwashed by the enemy. With powerful mind tricks, they convinced him that the groups he worked for were really traitors, and that Cobra forces were the good guys trying to stop them. He is a powerful ninja who has adapted his martial arts skills to suit his own evil purposes. A covert ops counterintelligence expert, he once performed undercover sabotage operations. Now as a member of Cobra, he uses this knowledge against the Sigma 6 team, always working to destroy them and anyone else who gets in his way. In the animated series, Storm Shadow is voiced by Tom Wayland. The rivalry between Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes is one of the focal plot lines of the series. There have been hints and references as to the cause of their enmity. The 4Kids TV website for Sigma 6 states that Storm Shadow was on an infiltration mission in a Cobra base and was captured and brainwashed into thinking the Joes and Snake Eyes were his enemies. Although Storm Shadow called Snake Eyes \\"brother,\\" the exact nature of that relationship is unknown. Storm Shadow frequently blames Snake Eyes for the downfall of the Arashikage ninja clan. The exact nature of Snake Eyes's betrayal of the Arashikage is as yet unknown. On occasion, he used ninja B.A.T.s as support troopers. This is in contrast to the A Real American Hero series, wherein Storm Shadow preferred highly trained humans as opposed to machines. Devil's Due also created a miniseries based on Sigma 6. It follows the style and the content of the animated series, spotlighting a different member of Sigma 6 and Cobra in each issue. Live action film In the 2009 film, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, the young Storm Shadow is played by Brandon Soo Hoo and the adult by Lee Byung-Hun. In this film adaptation, Storm Shadow is portrayed as a Korean ninja who was trained in Japan. The young Storm Shadow is seen speaking in Korean while training in Tokyo. Storm Shadow has a long history with Snake Eyes going back to when they were children, when he caught a starving Snake Eyes attempting to steal food. However, much to Storm Shadow's chagrin, Snake Eyes is immediately welcomed into the dojo. While Storm Shadow is initially superior, Snake Eyes persists and eventually earns the favor of the Hard Master. Shortly after, Snake Eyes is proclaimed the best student, and it is made to appear that Storm Shadow murdered the master and fled the scene. This turns their rivalry into bitter hatred as they find themselves on opposing sides. Similar to his continuity counterparts in background and attire, Storm Shadow serves as McCullen's assassin and as both bodyguard and mentor to the Baroness. Sent by McCullen to support the Baroness in acquiring the nanomite warheads, Storm Shadow was also given a direct order to kill Baron Daniel DeCobray if he ever touched the Baroness again, with her intentionally giving him reason as DeCobray outlived his usefulness to them. In another instance, however, Zartan mocks Storm Shadow for his unwillingness to kill women. During a lengthy fight in Cobra's arctic base, Snake Eyes slashes Storm Shadow several times, eventually compelling the latter to remove his white uniform. At the end, he is stabbed by Snake Eyes and falls into icy water. In Operation HISS, a comic sequel to the film, Storm Shadow survived his apparent death in the film. Lee Byung-hun has stated in an interview that he is signed on to return to future sequels, and has returned in the film G.I. Joe: Retaliation. It is learned that he was framed for the murder of the Hard Master by Zartan, who proceeded to raise Storm Shadow to be a ruthless assassin. Eventually Storm Shadow betrays Cobra and takes his revenge on his former master. Storm Shadow will appear in the upcoming Snake Eyes with Andrew Koji portraying the character. Video games Storm Shadow is one of the featured villains in the 1985 game G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero. Storm Shadow is featured as a playable character in the 1992 game G.I. Joe: The Atlantis Factor. In the 2009 game G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, he is a mini- boss, who is fought once in each of the first three acts. Reception Topless Robot ranked Storm Shadow as second on the 2010 list of The 10 Coolest G.I. Joe Ninjas, adding that he \\"been voted the #1 Cobra villain by the old Action Force Weekly\\".Ethan Kaye Daily Lists (Toys), The 10 Coolest G.I. Joe Ninjas, Topless Robot, September 14, 2010 His likeness is also featured in League of Legends, where the yordle ninja character named Kennen can be given the Arctic Ops skin, displaying the camo pattern worn by the 1988 Storm Shadow, as well as the character Zed who has a skin that appears similar to his appearance.

She is known for her works about sexual equality in oppose to the contemporary sexual double standard, and as such a participator of the famous Sedlighetsdebatten. Life She was born to Erik Johan Martin and Karolina Margareta Adolphson, who worked as confectioners. From 1868 until 1895 she was married to the Stockholmer merchant A. Agrell. She was engaged in the contemporary women's movement and the Sedlighetsdebatten, and belonged to the few radical women to wear the reform dress of the Swedish Dress Reform Association in public. She temporarily used the pseudonyms Thyra, Lovisa Petterqvist and Stig Stigson, but she soon begun to use her own name, which was unusual for a woman; other famed female Swedish playwrights of the century, such as the sisters Louise and Jeanette Granberg, both used male pseudonyms. The subject that she concentrated on, sexual double standards, was very shocking for her time. Alfhild Agrell was an important contributor to the cause of gender equality in regards of sexuality; in her work, she handles the questions and consequences of sexual injustice, the sexual double standards such as the fact that a woman is subjected to contempt when she does the same thing as a man in sexual matters, the questions of having \\"a bad reputation\\", the questions of the blame put on the woman and not the man when a child is born out of marriage, and the difficulties when a woman of the people and a man of the upper classes falls in love and the consequences of such a relationship. But she was pessimistic of the hope that men and women would ever reach sexual equality, and she doubted that a woman could find such a thing in marriage, where she by law was much restricted and given to her husbands whims.
