It contains a single species, B. markmitchelli, named in 2017 by Caleb Brown and colleagues from a well- preserved specimen known as the Suncor nodosaur. Discovered at an oil sands mine north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, that is owned by the Suncor Energy company, the specimen is remarkable for being among the best preserved dinosaur fossils of its size ever found. It preserved not only the armor (osteoderms) in their life positions, but also remains of their keratin sheaths, overlying skin, and stomach contents from the animal's last meal. Melanosomes were also found that indicate the animal had a reddish skin tone. Discovery and history Holotype shown from above The Suncor Borealopelta was uncovered on March 21, 2011, at the Millennium Mine, an oil sands mine north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, that is owned and operated by Suncor Energy. The Wabiskaw Member sediments were being removed to allow mining of the underlying bitumen-rich sands of the McMurray Formation when an excavator struck the fossil. Noting the unusual nature of the exposed fragments, the operators alerted the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology. In accordance with Suncor's mining permit and Alberta fossil law, the specimen became the property of the Albertan government. On March 23, Royal Tyrrell Museum scientist Donald Henderson and senior technician Darren Tanke were brought to the mine to examine the specimen, which, based on photographs, they expected to be a plesiosaur or other marine reptile, as no land animals had ever been discovered in the oil sands previously. Upon correct identification, which was made on site by Tanke, Henderson was astonished to learn that it was an ankylosaurian dinosaur and not a marine reptile. The animal had apparently been washed out to sea after death. After three days of mine safety training, museum staff and Suncor employees began working to recover all pieces of the fossil. Aside from the several pieces broken free, the bulk of the specimen was still embedded up a cliff that was high. The process took fourteen days in total. As the major piece of rock containing the fossil was being lifted out, it broke under its own weight into several pieces. Museum staff salvaged the specimen by wrapping and stabilizing the pieces in plaster, after which they were able to successfully transport them to the Royal Tyrell Museum. There, technician Mark Mitchell spent six years removing the adhering rock and preparing the fossil for study, which was sponsored by the National Geographic Society. The species B. markmitchelli was named for him in recognition of his skilled work. The specimen was put on public exhibit on May 12, 2017, as part of the Royal Tyrrell Museum's \\"Grounds for Discovery\\" exhibition, along with other specimens discovered via industrial activity. Description Restoration The Suncor Borealopelta is remarkable for its three-dimensional preservation of a large, articulated dinosaur complete with soft tissue. While many small dinosaurs have been preserved with traces of soft tissues and skin, these are usually flattened and compressed during fossilization. Similar- looking hadrosaurid \\"mummies\\" have a shriveled, desiccated appearance due to their partial mummification prior to fossilization. The Suncor specimen, however, appears to have sunk upside-down onto the sea floor shortly after its death, causing the top half of the body to be quickly buried with minimal distortion. The result is a specimen that preserves the animal almost as it would have looked in life, without flattening or shriveling. The Suncor specimen preserved numerous closely spaced rows of small armor plates, or osteoderms, lining the top and sides of its broad body. From the shoulders protruded a pair of long spines, shaped like the horns of a bull. Study of the pigments present in remnants of skin and scales suggest that it might have had a reddish-brown coloration in life, with a countershaded pattern that was used for camouflage. Classification Side view of its display case at the museum. Photocomposite and schematic line drawings of the holotype Borealopelta was classified by Brown et al. within the Nodosauridae. In the phylogenetic analysis conducted by the authors, Borealopelta nested within nodosaurids more derived than Nodosaurus. The completed cladogram was a strict consensus in 480 different trees, each with slightly different results. In both strict consensus and majority rules cladograms Borealopelta nested with Pawpawsaurus and Europelta in a group of Albian nodosaurs, with Hungarosaurus being the next closest taxon. The phylogeny below displays the results of the strict consensus, excluding taxa outside Nodosauridae. Paleobiology Comparisons of the size of the bony core and keratinous sheath of the parascapular spine of Borealopelta to modern analogues The discovery that Borealopelta possessed camouflage coloration indicates that it was under threat of predation, despite its large size, and that the armor on its back was primarily used for defensive rather than display purposes. Additionally, the spikes of Borealopelta had a dual function as defensive weapons and potential display structures useful in attracting mates and in species recognition. Examination of the specimen's stomach contents indicate that ferns were a major part of the animal's diet. The fact that ferns made up the majority of Borealopelta's last meal suggested that it was a highly selective feeder. Roughly six percent of the stomach contents contained charcoal as well, leading to the conclusion that Borealopelta was feeding in an area that was experiencing regrowth after a recent wildfire. Brown and colleagues inferred that the ferns themselves had been halfway through their growing season when ingested, suggesting that the Borealopelta individual ingested them in early or mid-summer, dying only a few hours afterward. =Diet= A study conducted in 2020 revealed that Borealopelta had a diet which consisted of leaves, stems, wood, leptosporangiate ferns, cycads, and conifers. Paleoecology Specimen from the left side The Suncor Borealopelta was preserved in the marine sandstones and shales of the Wabiskaw Member of the Clearwater Formation, which were laid down during the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous period, about 110‚Äì112 million years ago. At that time, the region was covered by the Western Interior Seaway, an inland sea that stretched from the Arctic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico, and the Wabiskaw sediments were being deposited in an offshore marine environment. The Borealopelta must have been washed out to sea, perhaps during a flood. The bloated carcass floated, possibly for weeks, until it burst and sank. It landed on the seabed on its back with enough force to deform the immediately underlying sediments. About 15 centimetres (6 in) of sediment settled over the carcass prior to the release of body fluids, as evidenced by fluid-escape structures preserved in the sediments, and the body cavity became filled with sand. A siderite concretion began to form around the carcass shortly after its arrival on the seabed, which prevented scavenging and preserved the body intact, with its scales and osteoderms in their original configuration.

Setanaxib is a member of the pyrazolopyridine dione chemical series. The compound is the only specific NOX inhibitor that has entered into clinical trials. Setanaxib, despite having demonstrated biological activity in a number of in vitro and in vivo animal pharmacological models including diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, atherosclerosis, liver fibrosis, osteoporosis, pulmonary hypertension and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, has failed two subsequent phase 2 clinical trials proof-of-concept studies in human. Setanaxib is currently developed by Genkyotex, a French biotech company based in Archamps.  Development strategy  The strategy of development of setanaxib was initially focused on the treatment of fibrosis and particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a life-threatening disease. Setanaxib obtained orphan drug designation from regulatory agencies in the US and EU in early 2010. Despite excellent in vitro and in vivo pharmacology results obtained in preclinical animal pharmacological models of fibrosis and IPF, and promising phase 1 data showing low toxicity of setanaxib, the company Genkyotex decided to initiate a phase 2 Proof-of-concept in the complex indication of diabetic nephropathy in 2014. As a result, setanaxib did not reach the primary clinical endpoint and the compound failed to make any significant reduction in albuminuria. Thereafter, the company decided to refocus development to initial clinical applications in fibrosis. But in May 2019, setanaxib failed again to reach primary and secondary endpoints in a second phase 2 in patients with primary biliary cholangitis, demonstrating much lower potency than Intercept‚Äôs compound Ocaliva, the only drug marketed for PBC so far. These cumulated disappointing clinical data confirm a major issue with setanaxib that clearly lack potency in human. History Setanaxib was discovered in the early 2000s by scientists at Genkyotex and was patented in 2007. Setanaxib was initially developed for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and obtained orphan drug designation both by FDA and EMEA by end of 2010. Setanaxib was developed by rational drug design following a campaign of high-throughput screening on several NOX isoforms. The initial lead compound GKT136901, a pyrazolopyridine dione derivative was further structurally modified in order to enhance binding affinity and improve pharmacokinetic properties, resulting in the discovery of setanaxib. In 2014, following a reorganization the company did get reed of the research team that discovered setanaxib. Since then no additional compound was discovered by the company despite major investments and attempts with GKT-771, a compound that failed to initiate clinical trials.https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/news/trial-results/rose- tinted-glasses-might-not-save-genkyotex.  Clinical trials  Development of setanaxib candidate showed promise in Phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers with no adverse effects. However, setanaxib failed its Phase 2 trial in diabetic nephropathy (DN) and did not reach the primary clinical endpoint, making no significant reduction in albuminuria and ending further development for DN. In a second phase 2 trial in primary biliary cholangitis published in May 2019, setanaxib failed again to meet both primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. The compound showed no effect in the 400 mg daily group and a very weak effect in the high dose group of twice 400 mg daily. The 111-patient study tested two doses of setanaxib, 400 mg once daily and 400 mg twice daily, versus placebo. It did not meet its primary endpoint, the percentage change in serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) at 24 weeks. Genkyotex claimed to show a reduction in ALP with setanaxib, with a nominal p-value of 0.002. However, this analysis took into account the entire treatment period, and in fact, the results were distinctly weaker using only data from the 24-week timepoint. The compound showed 22% reduction in liver stiffness seen with the twice-daily dose of setanaxib, versus a 4% increase with placebo. Liver stiffness, which was measured using noninvasive transient elastography, is an indicator of fibrosis. This was a prespecfied endpoint, but it featured low down in a list of 27 secondary outcomes. In any case, statistical significance was not reached and such findings can only be considered exploratory. A bigger red flag is the fact that the data touted by Genkyotex came from a subgroup of 45 patients who had baseline liver stiffness levels of 9.6kPa or greater, indicating stage 3 fibrosis or higher. Across the entire trial cohort, the liver stiffness data were much less impressive. Overall, setanaxib showed sub-optimal data for two proof-of-concept phase 2 clinical trials that question the future of this compound.Rose-tinted glasses might not save Genkyotex. Armstrong. May 2019.  Toxicity and potential risks  Setanaxib did not show any signs of toxicity in phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers. However, the compound is bearing an aniline moiety known to be associated with risks of unpredictable idiosyncratic toxicity.. Indeed, in the paper from Kalgutkar, the author analysed toxicity trends associated with the aniline structural alert in the top 200 prescribed drugs and recently approved (2009-2013) small molecule drugs. The authors found that the toxic anilines were the one for which the daily dose-drugs were the ones with higher daily doses (exceeding 100 mg). Current clinical data with setanaxib demonstrates that weak activity in human is found with a very high dose of 2 x 400 mg daily, which classify setanaxib has an aniline-based compound with a high risk of idiosyncratic toxicity particularly in a large population of patients such as metabolic disease or fibrosis.  Challenges and future perspectives of the therapeutic concept of Nox inhibition  With the multiple failures of setanaxib in clinical trials proof-of-concept, the concept of developing Nox inhibitors with the objective of treating potential diseases is now becoming extremely weak. The effects of antioxidants or scavengers in clinical trials has always been very disappointing in human clinical trials in many diseases and as a result, no antioxidative therapy reached the market due to failed clinical trials. Setanaxib is claimed to act through a different mechanism of action than standard antioxidants or scavengers. However, setanaxib owns similar features than standard antioxidants. Indeed, the compound requires a very high dose in human (2 x 400 mg once-a-day) in order to demonstrate very little or no pharmacological effect. Also, the compound has scavenging activity similarly to standard antioxidants. Indeed, GKT136901 a strongly similar chemical analogue of setanaxib was found to be a selective scavenger of peroxinitrite. Setanaxib demonstrated a great ability to treat rodents in a number of animal pharmacological models similarly to standard antioxidants. However, all of those antioxidant compounds failed in treating human diseases, similarly setanaxib did fail to repeat pharmacological effects in human clinical trials. The multiple failures of the lonely Nox Inhibitor setanaxib should hamper the future of the concept of Nox inhibition which is not identified as a hot topic by large pharmaceutical companies and major biotech partners. Genkyotex remains the lonely company developing Nox inhibitor with currently little future perspectives. On the other hand, if the hypothesis of testing NOX has only been addressed with suboptimal compounds such as setanaxib, or compounds with various chemical liabilities, the hypothesis has not yet been tested properly. Thus, future research should focus on creating genuine target-engaging NOX inhibitors, which can be used as probes and drug leads to properly test the NOX inhibition hypothesis.

She was the first suffragette to be tried by jury, and one of the first hunger strikers. She was known as 'Jennie Baines' in the suffragist movement.  Early life  Sarah Jane Baines was born in Birmingham, England, in 1866 to Sarah Ann (n√©e Hunt) and James Edward Hunt, a gun maker. She began work at Joseph Chamberlain's ordnance factory aged eleven. At age fourteen, Sarah joined her parents in working with the Salvation Army. Upon attaining the rank of lieutenant, now aged twenty, she was sent to work as an evangelist in an independent working men's mission in Bolton. In this role, she was also called upon to act as a police court missionary caring for women who had been arrested. Emmeline Pethick Lawrence receiving a bouquet of flowers from Jennie Baines, Flora Drummond and Frederick Pethick Lawrence watching. On 26 September 1888 in Bolton she married George Baines, a boot and shoemaker, and the couple had five children between 1888 and 1899 three of whom survived childhood. Between motherhood and working as a sewing machinist, there was little time for public activities. Yet Baines' commitment never wavered, her youngest surviving child was six years old when she was imprisoned for the third time. Annie Kenney called her 'one of the most kind-hearted woman one could meet, a born revolutionary'. Baines also joined the Independent Labour Party, the feeding of school children committee and the unemployed committee.  Campaigning for women's suffrage  In October 1905, Baines read about the arrest of suffragists Annie Kenney and Christabel Pankhurst for assault and this motivated her to join the Women's Social and Political Union. Initially this was as a voluntary basis but in February 1908, Baines was made a paid organiser on a wage of ¬£2 a week, organising open-air rallies, disrupting meetings and establishing new branches of the WSPU in the North of England and the Midlands. Later this same year, in November 1908, Baines was to be tried of unlawful assembly at the Coliseum in Leeds, the first ever member of the WSPU to be tried by jury. Refusing to be bound over, she was convicted to six weeks imprisonment in Armley Goal, Leeds because \\"she did ‚Äònot recognise the laws of this Court administered by men\\". One of the first to advocate militant methods, Baines was imprisoned some fifteen times for her part in protests. In July 1909 with twelve others, including Mary Leigh, Lucy Burns, Alice Paul, Emily Davison and Mabel Capper and another in her wheelchair [May Billinghurst perhaps] she was jailed for obstruction for trying to stop Lloyd George's public budget meeting in Limehouse. The protest was witnessed by Annie Barnes who was inspired to join the East London Federation and influenced by Sylvia Pankhurst. On the way to Holloway prison the women arrested had shouted and sung protests and demanded to be treated in 'first division' in their own clothes as 'political' prisoners rather than criminals, this was not granted and the women broke 150 panes of glass at the prison and refused to give their names, prison officers had to use 'force necessary' to get the women into prison clothes. In Liverpool, in 1910, Baines was making speeches with Ada Flatman and Patricia Woodlock, when she was interrupted by Constance Lytton disguised as 'Jane Wharton' a seamstress asking 'the men and women of Liverpool to be the first to wipe out the stain [of force-feeding]' and a crowd followed them to the prison Governor John Dillon's house, chased by police. In July 1912, Baines was part of an attempt, under the name 'Lizzie Baker' along with Gladys Evans and Mary Leigh and Mabel Capper, to burn down the Theatre Royal in Dublin the night before a scheduled visit from then Prime Minister, H.H. Asquith, to speak on Home Rule. For this Baines was sentenced to seven months hard labour and Central Bridewell prison, Dublin. Joining her fellow suffragette prisoners on hunger strike, she was released after five days. Jennie Baines, a prisoner The next year, on 8 July 1913, with her husband George and son Wilfred, Baines was accused of attempting to bomb first-class railway carriages at a Lancashire and Yorkshire railway siding, and leaving suffragist material, near where they lived in Manchester. A bomb, loaded revolver, masks and cutting tools and two catapults were found at their premises. As a result, her husband and son were charged with malicious damage and not imprisoned, but Baines was re-arrested under the 'Cat and Mouse act' and imprisoned at Holloway Prison. She again went on hunger strike, refusing food and water, and was released in a 'very serious condition'. Baines suffered from chorea ( St Vitus‚Äô Dance ) causing spasms brought on by emotional stress, making it almost impossible to force-feed her. Baines had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour'. In May 1913 another arrest for obstruction during a meeting in Hyde Park, and a month sentence led WSPU leaders to determine that her health could not endure another stint in prison, so Baines and her family were smuggled into Wales as the 'Evans' family and set sail aboard The Ballarat, bound for Australia, before their trial (as a family) was due in November 1913. The trial went ahead and acquitted George and Wilfred Baines. WSPU saw this migration as a reward for all Baines had done, as Australia had achieved the female federal vote in 1902.  Later life in Australia  After being smuggled out of England, Baines arrived in Melbourne, Australia in December 1913. She was forty-seven years old. Adele Pankhurst would later arrive in 1914. Upon settling in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy, the Baines family joined the Victorian Socialist Party and the Labour Party while Sarah busied herself working with the Women's Political Association as early as January 1914 and co-founded the Women's Peace Army. With Adele Pankhurst, Baines campaigned against World War I conscription in 1916-1917 and against the spiralling cost of living, as profiteering. Both were sentenced to nine months imprisonment but both were freed on appeal on a legal technicality. Baines was again jailed in March 1919 for flying the prohibited red flag on the Yarra Bank and became the first prisoner in Australia to undergo hunger strike. A special Federal Cabinet meeting was held and her release after four days starving was secured on the advice of the Attorney-General. In 1920, Baines helped establish the Communist Party in Victoria. Five years later, she would be expelled and this saw her rejoin the Labour Party. In 1926, the family relocated to Port Melbourne and Baines was appointed special magistrate to the Children's Court there from 1928 to 1948.  Death and legacy  Although her post Second World War activities were curtailed by her failing sight, Sarah Jane Baines continued her \\"fiery eloquence on the hustings\\" until her death from cancer, only giving up public speaking a few months before she died on 20 February 1951 in Port Melbourne. Survived by her husband and her three children, Baines's legacy could perhaps be summed up in her own words: > 'To fight for that which is better and nobler in this world is to live in > the highest sense, but to submit and tolerate the evils which exist is to > merely vegetate in the sewers of iniquity'. Jennie Baines quoted in The > Socialist, 11 April 1919.

Born in Providence, Rhode Island, Foss began learning baseball at an early age with her four brothers. While at high school, she participated in a wide variety of sports and became the captain of the varsity softball team. After graduating, she married and her husband went off to war, being killed while serving in the U.S. Navy. Thereafter, Foss played organized softball and was seen by a league scout. As a result, she was invited to a tryout in New Jersey and made the grade. Subsequently, Foss was sent to Opa- locka, Florida for spring training in 1948 and was assigned to the Springfield Sallies. But before she played one game for Springfield, she was traded to the Muskegon Lassies, who used her at second base. She then found herself on the move again, this time to the Grand Rapids Chicks late in the season. Foss opened 1949 with the Rockford Peaches, who tried to turn her into a pitcher. In her new role, Foss pitched a couple of games before returning to Muskegon, where she threw in one game. She did not come back the next season. In a 28-game career, Foss hit .117 (6-for-51) with a double and five stolen base, driving in five runs while scoring five times.Madden, W. C.

Pullman built four in 1938 and another two in 1949, after World War II. Their most prominent assignment was on the Broadway Limited, the Pennsylvania's flagship New York‚ÄìChicago train, but they were also assigned to the General and the Liberty Limited. Several of the cars have been preserved.  Design  = Prewar cars = The four prewar cars were long and weighed . The cars contained a single vestibule at one end; at the other was a rounded-off observation area. Raymond Loewy styled the cars and employed an Art Deco motif. The exteriors were painted in the Pennsylvania's tuscan red, with a maroon band around the windows and gold pinstripes. The interior was divided into two sections. At the vestibule end, and extending for half the car length, was a bedroom and two master rooms. The master rooms each contained a private shower. A single hallway to one side led past the private rooms to a lounge area. The lounge contained a buffet, desk, and seating for twenty-two people. Historians described the interior as \\"warm, colorful, and cheery.\\" = Postwar cars = The two postwar cars differed in various minor ways from the prewar cars. Externally, the most obvious difference was that the observation end was squared-off instead of rounded. It was longer, at , and heavier at . The lounge area was arranged with facing chairs, resulting in seating for twenty-five.  History  The Mountain View at Chicago in 1963 Pullman- Standard built the first four View series cars as part of the \\"Fleet of Modernism\\", comprising 56 new lightweight cars for passenger service on the Pennsylvania Railroad. Two, the Metropolitan View and Skyline View, were assigned to the Broadway Limited. That train was the flagship of the Pennsylvania Railroad, an all-Pullman luxury train providing overnight service between Chicago and New York. The cars went into service on June 15, 1938. The other two, Federal View and Washington View, were assigned to the Liberty Limited, which ran between Chicago and Washington, D.C.. The Liberty Limited had once been the Washington section of the Broadway Limited, and while it had gained coaches in 1932, it remained an important train. The shower bath in the master rooms was unique on Pullman trains in the United States well into the 1940s. Following the end of World War II the Pennsylvania ordered new equipment for the Broadway Limited, including two new View series sleeper- observation cars. These cars, Mountain View and Tower View, were similar in appearance and function to their prewar predecessors. The cars were delivered in January 1949. The displaced prewar cars were assigned to the General, another New York‚ÄìChicago train. The cars came off the Liberty Limited in 1957 and two, the Skyline View and Washington View were rebuilt as parlor cars. They were retired no later than 1962. The Pennsylvania merged the Broadway Limited and the General on December 13, 1967. The two postwar cars moved to the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad's Florida Special, a seasonal New York- Florida train. At the end of April Mountain View was sold into private ownership. Several cars survive. Penn Central, successor to the Pennsylvania, donated Tower View to the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in 1970. After a period of private ownership the Railway Museum of Greater Cincinnati acquired the Metropolitan View in 1997. The Railroaders Memorial Museum acquired Mountain View in 2006.

After the death of her parents her house in Putney became the centre of her extended Nasmyth family. Life Nasmyth was born on 13 November 1798 to Alexander and Barbara (n√©e Foulis) Nasmyth in Princes Street in Edinburgh. Her father was an engineer and a very successful artist who was taking on commissions not only for paintings but also for theatre scenery in both Edinburgh and London.J. C. B.

She was one of eleven children who were taught to draw and paint by their father. Alexander was keen that their daughters would be able to contribute to the family business and to be independent. Two of her brothers, Patrick and James painted but James was also a notable inventor and engineer. Anne and five of her sisters became notable painters. The Nasmyth painting school in Edinburgh was managed by the six sisters with the eldest, Jane, taking the lead. The school attracted young women and they were taught to paint and they would be taken on sketching trips to picturesque spots. Her sister Elizabeth was married to the actor Daniel Terry and he died in 1829. The same year Anne began to help with classes in London at her sister, Elizabeth's house in Portland Place. In 1831 Anne spent time with her brothers, James and George, as they started out in their careers as engineers in Manchester. Here she met an engineer named William Bennett. Anne was not as productive at exhibiting her work as her other sisters but she did exhibit a painting at the Royal Academy, Royal Society of British Artists, Royal Hibernian Academy, Royal Scottish Academy and the British Institution.

Elizabeth remarried, Charles Richardson, in 1835. She continued to teach at Elizabeth's house until 1838 when she married William Bennett in St Pancras church. They went to Italy for their honeymoon and set up their home in Salford. William Bennett ensured her brother's fortune when he lent him the money to patent his steam hammer. In 1840 her father died and her mother and unmarried sisters moved out. In 1851 Anne and William moved to Putney in London. Their house in Charlwood Road became a new social centre for the extended Nasmyth family. Anne's mother had died in 1847 and all of her unmarried sisters moved to Putney.

The boat series was built by C&C; Yachts in Canada, but it is now out of production. C&C; also produced the unrelated C&C; 25 Redline design. Design Dick and Irene Steffen had owned a yacht dealership for C&C; Yachts, that was located in Pointe Claire, Quebec. The dealership had done good business selling C&C; boats, but the C&C; line did not offer a boat smaller than the C&C; 27 at that time. Dick Steffen was a competitive sailing racer and thought that there would be a good market for a C&C; 24 foot keelboat. At his request C&C; designed the boat, but decided not to proceed with production. Steffen bought the design from C&C;, founding Mirage Yachts in February 1972 to build the design. The Mirage 24 sold well and quickly established a strong racing record in Midget Ocean Racing Club (MORC) class events. Caught off guard by the success of the boat, C&C; decided to design a competitor, which they named the C&C; 25, that was very similar to the Mirage 24's design. The C&C; 25 designs are both a small recreational keelboats, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. They have masthead sloop rigs, transom-hung rudders and fixed fin keels. Operational history In a review of the Mark II Michael McGoldrick wrote, \\"The newer version of the C&C; 25 (the Mark II) was introduced in the early 1980s. Compared to its predecessor, it has a more modern look about it, a slightly deeper keel which allows it to point a little higher, and a truck cabin that is raised all the way forward (as opposed to the original cabin which sloped downwards towards the front of the boat).

Constructed in 1870, the track was part of the Montana State Fairgrounds, now the Lewis and Clark County Fairgrounds. The racetrack was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 20, 2006. Portions of the track were demolished from 2006 to 2008 due to new construction on the fairgrounds. Horse racing in Montana Native Americans first brought horses to the northern Great Plains in the early to mid 1700s, and horse racing among Native Americans in what later became Montana was common.; ; Horse racing also became popular among white settlers in the area, particularly miners.; Semi-formal local horse flat racing meets first occurred in Montana in Deer Lodge, Helena, and Virginia City in the 1860s. Helena's first permanent horse racing track was Madam Coady's Two-Mile House, a track located a few miles from Helena. The first Montana Territorial Fair was held at the site 1868, and included Montana's first regionally-organized horse flat race. Harness racing was added at the second Territorial Fair in 1869. The Montana State Fairgrounds track =Construction of the track= In August 1870, a group of Helena businessmen and civic leaders organized a new association, the Montana Agricultural Mineral and Mechanical Association, to host a new regional fair. Among the trustees of the new organization were such prominent Montanans as Daniel A. G. Floweree, Cornelius Hedges, Anton M. Holter, and Conrad Kohrs. The group purchased property outside Helena (at the current location of the Montana State Fairgrounds), and construction of the racetrack began immediately. The track was built according to the rules of the American Horse Congress and the California State Agricultural Society, had a home stretch, and was wide enough to accommodate eight sulkies. It is unclear if the track was a regular oval or if it had slightly distorted third and fourth turns which gave it an irregular oblong shape. At the time of its construction, it was the only regulation track in the territory. Several other buildings were erected about the same time as the track was constructed. Grandstands were constructed probably at the same as the track, beginning near the starting line and extending eastward. A \\"paddock\\" was built to the east of the grandstand, and around the first turn were three stables. =Early history of the track= Races were held throughout the summer (not just at fair-time). They attracted horses from as far away as Salt Lake City, and even included some high-quality Kentucky thoroughbreds. By 1884, horse racing tracks had been built in Bozeman and Butte, and a \\"Montana Circuit\\" for horse racing had evolved. Races at Montana Circuit tracks became more exclusive, and applicant horses had to be vetted by a nomination committee before being allowed to race. The Montana Circuit eventually expanded to 15 regulation tracks. On either side of the finish line were judging stands. These are two-storied structures which gave judging officials a clear view of the finish line so that they might declare which horses won and placed in the race. Initially, these were merely covered platforms, but they were replaced several times over the years with more elaborate, permanent structures with walls, windows, and amenities. Montana became a U.S. state in 1889, and the fair was renamed the Montana State Fair in 1891 after being sold to a new group of investors. Helena horse racing continued to gain in prestige, with owners in Denver, Colorado, and Spokane, Washington, sending entries. The track was rebuilt that year. A Montana Central Railway spur reached the fairgrounds that same year, and local undocumented tradition claimed that several railroad cars of earth from Kentucky were laid on the track. The Panic of 1893 created significant economic disruption in Montana, and the Montana State Fair shut down after the 1895 event. The fairgrounds were mortgaged, and the issuers of the loan foreclosed. =Period of state ownership= Helena residents raised money in 1903 to buy the fairgrounds, which were donated to the state. By this time, the track had so deteriorated that large amounts of soil had to be trucked in to restore the turns. The state of Montana authorized a subsidized Montana State Fair in 1903, and in 1904 relay races were added. About this time, a two-story raised platform was erected just outside the first turn. This platform was used by racing officials to direct animals and riders before and after races. In 1904, the three stables were moved from the first turn to outside the far stretch and rebuilt as speed barns. A fourth speed barn and three more stables were built at some point thereafter. Two small cottages were erected about this time as well. One was against the north fence between the speed barns and stables, and another was at the end of a long shed built east of the speed barns. The cottage attached to the shed was used by the racetrack veterinarian. Significant changes to the viewing area were made after 1904. Three sets of bleachers were erected at the racetrack between 1903 and 1914. The first (the \\"long bleachers\\") was erected about west of the grandstands, probably in 1904. The second set was erected between 1904 and 1913 to the west of the grandstand, and the third (the \\"small bleachers\\") to the west of the long bleachers, probably in 1914. The old grandstands were demolished in 1906, and replaced with larger ones. Roughly long and wide, they cost $20,000 ($ in dollars) and were capable of seating 5,000 people. Beneath the grandstands were a small jockey's dressing room (eastern end), a restaurant, and a room with betting windows. The horse racing at the Montana State Fair began to decline after the Montana Legislature banned betting on horse races in 1914. The fair's financial situation deteriorated when the state legislature significantly cut the subsidy in 1915, and a worsening decade-long drought led to fewer paying exhibitors. A dirt automobile racing track was built in the horse racing track's infield in 1916, nestled against the first turn. Although horse racing remained popular at the fairgrounds, economic difficulties led to the fair's cancellation in 1926. Organizers managed to host only small fairs 1927 to 1932. The ban on gambling was lifted in 1930. That year, more than 350 high-quality racehorses from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico raced at Helena, and parimutuel betting (assisted by an automatic totaliser) first occurred. The \\"paddock\\" was abandoned the same year, and a true, open-air paddock was built next to it. =Closure and reopening= The last Montana State Fair was held in Helena in 1932. The 1935 Helena earthquake and several fires in the 1930s and 1940s destroyed several unspecified structures associated with the horse racing track. In the fall of 1937, the three north stables and veterinarian's cottage burned down. Horse racing ended during this time, and the track was abandoned except for the small section in front of the grandstand (used as part of the automobile race track). The largest of the four north barns was relocated to nearby Green Meadow Ranch about 1938. The remaining three north barns either burned down or were demolished by 1951. Both finish-line judging stands were removed by then as well. In mid-1953, the Capital City Racing Association constructed a oval stock car racing track inside the 1916 automobile track. It remained in until 1956. Horse racing returned to the horse track in 1964, some years after organizers hosted the first Last Chance Stampede at the fairgrounds. Some newspapers began referring to the horse track as \\"Helena Downs\\" at this time. Horse racing lasted until 1998, and a year later the state turned the fairgrounds over to Lewis and Clark County. =County ownership and changes to the track= The grandstands were demolished in 2000. They had fallen into a decrepit state, and preservationists vigorously asked for them to be preserved. But the cost was too great, and the state declined to assume the cost. New modern, metal bleachers were erected in their place, and in the infield just west of the first turn. The new grandstands, designed to accommodate rodeo activities in the infield, occupied about one-eighth of the horse racing track surface. Both the second turn, home stretch, and backstretch were bulldozed to accommodate rodeo activities. The public discussion over the grandstands led the Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Office to conduct a historic assessment of the Montana State Fairgrounds in 2003. In 2005, the Lewis and Clark County Fair Board began consideration of a plan to reconfigured the old Montana State Fairgrounds for reuse. The plans called for a new grandstand and a large new exhibition building in the horse track infield, and demolition of the home stretch. Although there was support for the return of horse racing and restoration of the track, the fair board declined to amend the plan to accommodate it. When the county began building an access road across the horse racing track in the fall of 2005 in preparation for construction, an organization named Save the Track Foundation unsuccessfully sued to have the road stopped. In November 2006, Lewis and Clark County voters approved a $5.7 million ($ in dollars) tax levy to implement the changes proposed by the fair board. Despite the partial blockage and demolition of the track, the horse racing track (but not any associated buildings) was added to the National Register of Historic Places in December 2006. In 2006, the Save the Track Foundation filed several lawsuits to enjoin Lewis and Clark County from implementing its reconfiguration of the fairgrounds. The group claimed that the fair board had misled voters by failing to disclose that the horse racing track would be partially demolished and the infield used for construction. County officials said the reconfiguration plan saved most of the track for horse racing and preservation purposes, and that a lengthy planning process determined that partial demolition and use of the infield was the best use of the land given current and future needs. A Montana District Court judge declined to issue a temporary injunction halting the plan, and in March 2008 issued a formal ruling in favor of the county. The ruling allowed final construction on the new exhibition building to go forward. About the track The Montana State Fairgrounds Racetrack is located in the center of the fairgrounds. Grandstands, three sets of bleachers, an enclosed \\"paddock\\", two judging platforms, and three stables were built during the track's early history on the home stretch and first turn. Speed barns, three stables, and two cottages were built adjacent to the back stretch in the first two or three decades of the 20th century. No historic structures associated with the track's history remained as of 2006. The Montana State Fairgrounds Racetrack was one of only three tracks west of the Mississippi River in 2005. It was reported to be the oldest of these tracks in 2006, as well as the oldest extant horse racing track in Montana, and the only racing track built in Montana's territorial period to survive into the 21st century. According to the American Racing Manual, it was the second oldest horse racing track of its kind in the nation.

The system was similar to indentured servitude and both were in operation during the same period, with the kangani system becoming more popular from late 19th century onward. Under the kangani system, recruitment and management were taken up by people called the kangani (from the Tamil word for foreman), who directly recruited migrants from India- especially South India in Tamil-majority areas- via networks of friends, family and other contacts, with that same person then responsible for the supervision of the labourers he recruited. . The leader of these groups of immigrants had considerable control over their affairs and generally forced them to enter debt-bondage relationships by illegally deducting their wages. In smaller groups they might work as labourers themselves in addition to their other responsibilities but in larger groups their role was more one of organisation, supervision and dealing with the landowner. With certain estimates showing that nearly 1 in 8 Indian labourers in Burma was a kangani, some have argued that stepping into the role of recruiter and supervisor, with its accompanied rise in income and status, was a relatively achievable form of social mobility among the labourers of the plantations  References   Further reading  * Category:Labor relations Category:Asian people by ethnic or national origin Category:Labor history Category:South Asian culture ","title":"Kangani system"},{"id":"54042855","text":"Isaac Getz is a Professor at ESCP Business School and author of books and articles.

He plays at fly-half. Background Born in the Philippines to a British father and a Filipina mother, Smith picked up the game of rugby union at the age of seven with Centaurs RFC when his family moved to Singapore. Later, Smith received a sports scholarship to attend Brighton College and went on to captain the school's 1st XV. The young fly- half was named Player of the Tournament at the 2016 St Joseph's Rugby Festival. Smith is the second youngest debutant featured in the Aviva Premiership at 18 years and 200 days old whose record is behind George Ford when Ford made his league debut for Leicester Tigers in 2010. Club career Smith contributed ten points from the tee in Harlequins U18s Academy Final win over Sale Sharks U18s and he played in five of the fixtures during the 2016‚Äì2017 season and scored two tries along the way, one against London Irish and once against Saracens. The young fly-half previously played for Harlequins at the 2016 Singha Premiership Rugby Sevens. In March 2017, Smith was promoted from Harlequins Elite Player Development Group (EPDG) up to the full-time Academy starting in June. Having just joined the academy side, Smith was named in the 12-man senior squad alongside with another Brighton College graduate Calum Waters for the 2017 Singha Premiership Rugby Sevens at Franklin's Gardens. Smith had a stand-out evening on the first day of the tournament by scoring two tries against London Irish and eventually assisted Harlequins to reach the club Semi-final before losing out to Newcastle Falcons. On 2 September 2017, Smith made his professional debut wearing the number 10 jersey for the senior Harlequins side in the Aviva Premiership London Double Header fixture against London Irish at Twickenham Stadium. Two weeks later, Smith made a man-of-the-match performance against Wasps and subsequently ended the home side's 22-match winning streak at Ricoh Arena. International career Smith made his first appearance for England with a try in the U16s match victory against Wales in April 2015. He later represented England at U18s and at the 2017 Six Nations Under 20s Championship. In May 2017, Smith took part in one of the training sessions with the England elite senior squad during their 3-day camp held at Brighton College in preparation for the Old Mutual Wealth Cup match against the Barbarians and the summer tour to Argentina. On 12 July 2017, Smith was named in the England U18s squad for a three-match tour of South Africa in August. On 3 August 2017, Smith was named in Eddie Jones' pre-season senior England training squad. The Harlequin has \\"been called up having been involved in some sessions at England's training camp in Brighton at the end of last season, as well as playing in England U20s 2017 Six Nations Grand Slam winning squad.\\". Eddie Jones described Smith's inclusion in the senior England squad as part of the plan to develop young players as well as to give pressure on experienced players such as Owen Farrell and George Ford. On 22 September 2017, Smith was named in the 33-man England training squad for a camp in Oxford ahead of the Autumn internationals, although England coach Eddie Jones said he would be 'treated like an apprentice'. In the following month on 26 October, Smith was called into the England squad for the Autumn international series after an impressive start in the premiership season. Smith was part of the senior England training squad during the 2018 Six Nations Championship. After a break-through 2017-2018 season, he was named in the England U20 squad in the 2018 World Rugby Under 20 Championship in France. The fly-half came off the bench in the opening match against Argentina and scored his first try in his U20 jersey. Later he started at No. 10 in the pool match against Italy, semi-final against South Africa and in the final against France. On 2 June 2019 Smith made his England XV debut against the Barbarians. During the game, Smith contributed 26 points which included his first try for the full team. The final score was 51-43 to England. Smith was awarded Man of the Match for his outstanding performance.

Early life and education  Feinberg was born in Washington, DC and grew up in Bethesda, Maryland where he attended Walt Whitman High School and graduated in 2001 along with journalist Ashley Parker, currently White House Correspondent for The Washington Post. Feinberg attended the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and graduated in 2005 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in History and History of Science. He was a coxswain on the university's rowing team and participated in the 2002 selection process for the United States' Under-23 National Rowing Team, but was cut along with future 2008 Olympic Medalist Marcus McElhenney.  Journalism career  Feinberg began his career at Warren Communications News where he covered telecommunications and Internet policy for Communications Daily and Washington Internet Daily. He was the first reporter to break the story of House Democrats' 2008 attempt to restrict and regulate the use of social media by Members of Congress. In 2012 Feinberg joined The Hill as a staff writer covering technology and telecommunications policy. Over the years his work has appeared in publications including Washington Business Journal, Politico Magazine, Silicon Angle, and Mashable. = Sputnik News = Seeking a full-time reporting position, Feinberg interviewed with Sputnik News editor Peter Martinichev in December 2016 and was hired as Sputnik's first full-time White House Correspondent, joining the D.C. bureau at the beginning of the Trump administration. While working for Sputnik Feinberg covered daily press briefings and other events at the White House while working out of the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room. In March 2017, he became the first Sputnik reporter to apply for permanent White House press credentials. On May 26, 2017, Feinberg announced on Twitter that he was no longer working for Sputnik. In an interview with Erik Wemple of The Washington Post, he explained that Sputnik's management was angry because they prefer that their reporters remain anonymous. He also said that Sputnik editors wanted him to bring up the Seth Rich conspiracy theory at White House press briefings and to write about it for their news wire. Feinberg stated that Sputnik's management had been upset with the publicity he received after another Washington Post article said how he aggressively questioned White House OMB Director Mick Mulvaney over plans to restrict the Earned Income Tax Credit to families with parents who are in the United States legally, even if undocumented/illegal immigrants have American citizen children and pay enough taxes to be eligible for the EITC. The exchange was covered by Dana Milbank of The Washington Post. In an interview with Brian Stelter of CNN, Feinberg noted that another source of tension with Sputnik's management was their insistence on pre-approving questions he would ask at White House press briefings, and that they would often order him to ask questions that were based on completely false premises to push narratives that \\"don't comport with reality.\\" After a lawsuit by private investigator Rod Wheeler against Fox News alleged that members of the Trump administration had a hand crafting a story (which was later retracted) which pushed the Seth Rich murder-conspiracy theory, Feinberg told Joy-Ann Reid of MSNBC that it was \\"troubling\\" that both the White House and a Russian propaganda service were both attempting to promote the discredited story. Shortly after publication of a Politico article in which he documented his experiences, Yahoo News reported that on September 11, 2017, Feinberg met with an FBI Special Agent and an Assistant US Attorney from the National Security Division of the US Department of Justice at their request as part of an investigation into whether Sputnik should be required to register as foreign propaganda under the 1938 Foreign Agents Registration Act. At that meeting, during which he provided information on \\"internal structure, editorial processes, and funding\\", Feinberg turned over a flash drive containing over 6,000 internal emails‚Äîevery message he'd sent or received during his tenure at Sputnik‚Äîincluding messages pertaining to the percentage of funding Sputnik receives from Russia's government and his editors insistence that he pre-clear all White House briefing questions with them. Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitri Peskov condemned the FBI's questioning of the former Sputnik reporter (who spoke with the FBI voluntarily), telling the TASS news agency,\\" \\"We don‚Äôt have detailed information, but in any case questionings of journalists or ex- journalists, but in connection with their journalist activity, clearly don‚Äôt speak well for pluralism of opinions and freedom of the media. They rather suggest that serious problems are emerging with censorship and restriction of the field for media work.\\" Feinberg dismissed concerns that such an investigation posed any threat to press freedom, telling the Columbia Journalism Review that ‚ÄúSputnik does not operate like any news organization I have worked for or I have ever seen.‚Äù = Current work = Feinberg has held various roles with for Breakfast Media LLC, publishers of the technology/telecommunications news site BroadbandBreakfast.com and the general political news site BeltwayBreakfast.com since 2008. He is currently listed as the company's White House Correspondent and Managing Editor. From late 2017 to mid 2018 he worked part-time as an editor and political reporter for the Montgomery County Sentinel, and since June 2019 he has contributed regularly to The Independent, including coverage of the impeachment of Donald Trump as a Washington, DC-based correspondent. On March 28, 2020, Feinberg announced that he was joining Newsweek as the publication's White House correspondent, but his contributions to the website stopped after approximately a month. In August 2020, after the site published an op-ed claiming that Senator Kamala Harris was not eligible to be Vice President because her parents were both immigrants, Feinberg alluded to disagreements with management in which he was told certain White House officials were \\"off-limits.\\"  Clashes with Kellyanne Conway  During a question-and-answer session with reporters on May 29, 2019, Feinberg confronted Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway over whether she believed she had violated the Hatch Act by endorsing Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore during a 2018 special election. Conway's reply, \\"let me know when the jail sentence starts,\\" was cited by the Office of Special Counsel in a report recommending that she be removed from federal service. Six weeks later, Feinberg asked Conway what countries President Trump was suggesting that members of \\"The Squad\\" should return to during a media availability at the White House. She responded by demanding to know his ethnic background. Conway's retort was widely condemned, with CNN's Chris Cilizza calling the exchange \\"outrageous\\" and \\"unreal.\\" Feinberg later told CNN's Don Lemon that he had \\"no earthly clue what either her question or the answer [he] could have given to that question had to do with what the President said or to what country she was referring.‚Äù  References  Category:American political journalists Category:People from Bethesda, Maryland Category:Journalists from Maryland Category:Living people Category:Journalists from Washington, D.C.

He became commander of the Lithuanian Army after the resignation of Stasys Ra≈°tikis in January 1940. In this capacity, Vitkauskas opposed armed resistance to the Soviet occupation in June 1940 and subsequently collaborated with the new Soviet regime. During World War I, he was mobilized to the Imperial Russian Army and served in the Romanian Front where he became close friends with Antanas Merkys. This relationship proved crucial in Vitkauskas' career. He returned to Lithuania in 1918 and fought in the Lithuanian Wars of Independence. Thanks to Merkys, Vitkauskas became deputy commander of the Lithuanian Military Brigade and commandant of Klaipƒóda in the aftermath of the Klaipƒóda Revolt. Despite success in the field and evaluation as a capable officer, his military career was dampened by rumors and suspicions that he sympathized with the Bolsheviks and socialists. He resigned active duty in 1927 and worked as a lecturer at the higher military courses in Kaunas. After the completion of training with the German Reichswehr in 1929, Vitkauskas became inspector of the infantry and helped Stasys Ra≈°tikis, commander of the army, to implement much needed reforms. He was particularly involved with practical training and military exercises. In October 1939, Vitkauskas led Lithuanian troops to Vilnius ‚Äì the historical capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania which was fiercely contested between Lithuania and Poland since 1920. It was a prominent assignment that brought public recognition. In November 1939, Merkys became Prime Minister. Ra≈°tikis resigned in January 1940 and was replaced by Vitkauskas. When Soviet Union presented an ultimatum on 14 June, Vitkauskas argued against armed resistance. The ultimatum was accepted and Lithuania lost its independence. Vitkauskas collaborated with the new regime becoming Minister of Defense in the People's Government, an elected delegate of the People's Seimas, and a member of the delegation that presented Joseph Stalin with a Lithuanian petition to become one of the republics of the Soviet Union. The Lithuanian Army was reorganized into the 29th Rifle Corps of the Red Army commanded by Vitkauskas. In June 1941, just before the German invasion of Russia, Vitkauskas was sent to the Military Academy of the General Staff in Moscow where he studied and later taught until early 1946. He returned to Lithuania and taught at the University of Kaunas and Kaunas Polytechnic Institute until retirement in 1954. Biography =Early life= Vitkauskas was born in the village, then part of the Congress Poland, a puppet state of the Russian Empire. His parents were poor peasants. His father traveled to United States where he worked as a coal miner in Pennsylvania for seven years to save up enough money to buy of land in . He continued to work the farm until his death in 1937. Between ages of 7 and 11, Vitkauskas attended a primary people's school in Lankeli≈°kiai but financial difficulties did not allow to continue the education. He remained home and helped his father with farm work. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, Vitkauskas and his elder brother helped smuggling publications and weapons from East Prussia to Marijampolƒó. In 1908, at the age of 18, Vitkauskas resumed his education as an external student in Marijampolƒó (1908‚Äì12) and Vilkavi≈°kis (1912‚Äì13). To earn a living, he worked as a tutor. In 1914, he took high school exams at the 2nd Gymnasium, known as Alekseevskaya (), in Oryol and obtained a high school diploma. He then became a mathematics student at the Moscow State University. In the evenings, he also took classes at the Stroganov Academy of Arts. = World War I=  1916  In 1916, he was mobilized to the Imperial Russian Army. From 1 June to 1 December, Vitkauskas was a student at the . After graduation, as a praporshchik, he was assigned to the .  1917  In January 1917, he was sent to machine gun courses at the . In March, he was sent to Voronezh where he joined the . His machine gun company was moved to the 5th Infantry Regiment, part of the 9th Army, and deployed in the Romanian Front. By the end of the war, he was promoted to podporuchik and commander of the machine gun company. He demobilized in February 1918 and waited until September in Kiev to get the permission from the Germans to return to Lithuania. = Lithuanian Wars of Independence = Map of the Battle of the Niemen River: 3rd Battalion, commanded by Vitkauskas, managed to outmarch Polish encirclement from Ho≈æa via Lida to Ashmyany He returned in October and joined the fledgling Lithuanian government to become the county governor of Vilkavi≈°kis. On 1 February 1919, he volunteered to the newly established Lithuanian Army and was assigned as the commandant of Raseiniai. There he organized a company and faced the threat of the Bermontians.  Fight against the Bermontians  On 21 October, an ammunition shipment to Raseiniai was attacked by the Bermontians near ≈†imkaiƒçiai. The Lithuanians defended and killed six attackers. In retaliation, the Bermontians attacked Jurbarkas on 25 October and Raseiniai on 26 October. They looted and took valuables. In Raseiniai, they searched for Vitkauskas but unable to find him captured lieutenant Vincas Rimaviƒçius and later executed him. Vitkauskas and other men retreated to Girkalnis and Betygala. At the end of May 1919, Vitkauskas' brother Juozas, who served in the Red Army and fought Lithuanians in the Lithuanian‚ÄìSoviet War, was captured and executed by the Lithuanian Army. That cast a doubt on Vitkauskas' loyalties and on 15 January 1920 he was demoted to commander of a machine gun company with the 7th Infantry Regiment. On 10 July, he was promoted to the commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 7th Infantry Regiment. At the time, the battalion was stationed in Vilnius.  Fight against Poland  On 21 September, during the Battle of the Niemen River, he was given urgent orders to depart to and take up defensive position along the Neman River. At the time, the battalion had 500 men and only 5 officers and no telephones. In Ho≈æa, Vitkauskas learned that Lithuanian forces moved to Druskininkai where Polish forces concentrated their attack. Vitkauskas contacted the commander of Russian forces in Grodno who promised to send 48th and 49th Infantry Regiments but they never showed. Polish forces took Druskininkai and began their advance towards Ho≈æa. Vitkauskas ordered a retreat to , a railway station on the Saint Petersburg‚ÄìWarsaw Railway, but Polish forces got there first. The battalion was cut off from other Lithuanian units. Vitkauskas then decided to march back to . The next day they marched to but it was also taken by the Polish Army. The battalion turned to Vasilishki and pushed to Lida where it found some men from the 1st Battalion of the 7th Infantry Regiment. Vitkauskas managed to get permission from the Russian commander to gather the men and continue to Ashmyany which they reached on 30 September 1919. From there, they turned to Vilnius and reunited with Lithuanian forces. In total, to escape the encirclement and capture, Vitkauskas led some 750 men who marched in 7 days in very difficult circumstances due to lack of food for the men and feed for the horses.  ≈ªeligowski's Mutiny  While the 7th Infantry Regiment was recuperating and regrouping in Vilnius, Polish General Lucjan ≈ªeligowski began an attack towards the city on 8 October 1920. The action became known as the ≈ªeligowski's Mutiny. Vitkauskas commanded the 1st and the 3rd Battalions of the 7th Infantry Regiment and took the positions across the Vilnius‚ÄìUkmergƒó road north of Vilnius. On 15‚Äì16 October, his men successfully attacked Polish positions near Rie≈°ƒó but Vitkauskas was injured. For his actions in fighting the Poles, Vitkauskas was awarded the Order of the Cross of Vytis (1st type, 1st class). =Interwar Lithuania= Stalling career Despite success in the field and evaluation as a capable officer, Vitkauskas was demoted to commander of a company of the 7th Infantry Regiment on 2 August 1921. Minister of Defence Konstantinas ≈Ωukas though that Vitkauskas was a Bolshevik sympathizer. However, on 6 September, he was transferred to the staff of the Lithuanian Military Brigade (), a unit established in February 1920 to maintain public security. At the time, the brigade was commanded by Antanas Merkys, a friend from the Romanian Front, who trusted Vitkauskas to become his deputy. Vitkauskas officially became the commander of the brigade's staff on 12 October 1922. In December, he began studies at the higher officers' courses in Kaunas but the studies were interrupted by the Klaipƒóda Revolt in January 1923. He was one of the Lithuanian soldiers sent to stage the revolt. Under the codename Vilius Kremeris, he was head of the Administration of the rebel forces. In April, he was called to become commandant of Klaipƒóda. This position was also Merkys' doing ‚Äì he was a secretary to Antanas Smetona, the Commissioner of the Klaipƒóda Region. A month later he was promoted to major. When the office of the commandant of Klaipƒóda was liquidated in November 1923, he was reassigned to the 3rd military district as commander of the 1st general staff. Concurrently, from January to September 1924, he was the commander of the staff of the 3rd Infantry Division. In September 1924, Vitkauskas began law studies at the University of Lithuania. Though he completed most of his courses and examinations, he never graduated. In February 1925, he was temporarily assigned as the commander of the 9th Infantry Regiment, stationed in Marijampolƒó. After the May 1926 elections to the Third Seimas, Christian Democrats lost their majority and Vitkauskas' command was made permanent and he was awarded the Order of the Cross of Vytis (2nd type, 1st class). In December 1926, Vitkauskas together with many other military officers traveled to Kaunas for the celebration of the 60th birthday of President Kazys Grinius. The occasion was used to stage the military coup d'√©tat that brought Antanas Smetona to power. The morning after the coup, all commanders of military units were ordered to report to the General Staff. That night Vitkauskas visited his in-laws and did not receive the order. When he did not report on time, rumors started spreading about his political leanings reviving old suspicions of his socialist sympathies. The new government did not trust Vitkauskas and started gathering intelligence on him. He kept his command of the 9th Infantry Regiment because of Antanas Merkys, who was now Minister of Defence. However, Vitkauskas felt the distrust and submitted a resignation which was granted on 4 May 1927. He became an instructor of the higher military courses and worked there until mid-1930. Career resumed Lithuanian troops, commanded by Vitkauskas, enter Vilnius in October 1939 In April‚ÄìNovember 1929, Vitkauskas along with polkovniks Aleksandras Plechaviƒçius and Oskaras Urbonas was sent for a training with the 7th (Bavarian) Division of the Reichswehr. After his return, he was sent to a six-month higher courses for officers in Kaunas and, upon the completion, was promoted to the inspector of the infantry on 1 July 1930 and the inspector of the army on 1 April 1934. The armed forces were reorganized by Stasys Ra≈°tikis and Vitkauskas once again became the inspector of the infantry in August 1935. He continued to improve his military knowledge by inspecting German proving grounds and observing their military exercises, learning about anti-aircraft defense in Switzerland, and touring infantry schools and shooting rages in the Soviet Union. He further briefly visited France, Belgium, Italy, Denmark. In Lithuania, he spent a significant amount of time at the proving grounds educating others on machine guns, anti-aircraft and anti-tank defenses, mortars. He was active both in military practice (e.g. participated in military exercises) and theory (e.g. wrote 12 statutes, contributed to military press, published a book on heavy machine guns). In 1938, Vitkauskas was elected chairman of the officers' club (Karinink≈≥ ramovƒó). Vitkauskas was appointed as the commander of the 1st Division on 4 April 1939 and promoted to divisional general in June. He had no formal military education, but Stasys Ra≈°tikis, commander of the army, valued his hard work, initiative, and dedication. In September 1939, after the Invasion of Poland, the Lithuanian Army was mobilized and Vitkauskas was commended for the smooth mobilization of his division and effective guard of the Lithuanian borders between Neris river and Latvia. In October, Lithuania gained a portion of the Vilnius Region according to the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty. On 28 October, the Lithuanian Army entered Vilnius, which was fiercely contested between Poland and Lithuania, for the first time since 1920. The troops were commanded not by Ra≈°tikis but by Vitkauskas ‚Äì the first public sign that Ra≈°tikis was losing favor with the Smetona's regime. Two weeks later, in an interview to Lietuvos ≈æinios, Vitkauskas claimed that it was the happiest day of his life. This high-profile appointment was also linked with Merkys, who was appointed the Lithuanian representative to the region. On 17 November 1939, Merkys became Prime Minister and offered Ministry of Defence to Vitkauskas, but he refused. Merkys' relationship with Ra≈°tikis was poor and Ra≈°tikis was forced into a three-month vacation for \\"health reasons\\" on 22 January 1940. In his duties, Ra≈°tikis was replaced not by his deputy divisional general , but by Vitkauskas. It was a surprising appointment as he gained prominence only after the takeover of Vilnius, but he was described as a non-political candidate which was important to Smetona. =Soviet occupation= According to the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact of August 1939 and the subsequent German‚ÄìSoviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty, Lithuania became part of the Russian sphere of influence. Delayed by the Winter War with Finland, Soviet Union began heightening tensions in late spring 1940 just as Nazi Germany was winning the Battle of France. Though the Lithuanian government and army had several months to plan for a contingency, the reaction was sluggish and no decisive steps were taken. The military developed a defensive plan against Russia (known as Plan R), but it was just a slightly modified Plan L for defense against Poland. Before midnight on 14 June 1940, Soviet Union issued an ultimatum to Lithuania. The Lithuanian government, given less than 12 hours to respond, held an emergency meeting that night. Vitkauskas, as commander of the army, opposed calls for armed resistance. The government voted to accept the ultimatum and Lithuania lost its independence. Vitkauskas departed to station on the Libau‚ÄìRomny Railway to meet the new Soviet contingents. President Antanas Smetona and Minister of Defense Kazys Musteikis fled to Nazi Germany. Merkys became acting President and named Vitkauskas to replace Musteikis. Two days later, as directed by Soviet envoy Vladimir Dekanozov, a new government led by Prime Minister Justas Paleckis was formed. It became known as the People's Government. Vitkauskas continued his role as Minister of Defense. Merkys no longer had any role in the government and attempted to escape to Sweden a month later. Soviet officials began rapid Sovietization of Lithuania and its military. Already in July, the purge of the army started ‚Äì Lithuanian officers were dismissed and replaced by more communist-leaning personnel, more vocal opponents of the Soviet regime were arrested. On 2 July 1940, People's Government issued order to reorganize the Army into the People's Army. This, among other things, introduced political commissars and a propaganda section. On 11 July, even before the elections to the People's Seimas, Soviet Commissar of Defense Semyon Timoshenko announced the creation of the Baltic Military District. The next day, Vitkauskas was replaced by major general Feliksas Baltu≈°is-≈Ωemaitis. Vitkauskas remained Minister of Defense though the position was largely deprived of any meaningful authority. On 14‚Äì15 July, Vitkauskas was elected in the show election to the People's Seimas. The Seimas met on 21 July 1940. Its main order of business was a resolution creating the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and petitioning the Soviet Union to admit the new Lithuanian SSR into the Union. Vitkauskas was elected a member of the 20-member delegation to present the petition to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, which was approved on 3 August. Vitkauskas, together with Justas Paleckis, Icikas Meskupas-Adomas, and Antanas Snieƒçkus, was personally received by Joseph Stalin on 9 August. The next day he met with the Commissar of Defense Timoshenko and the Chief of the General Staff to discuss the liquidation of the Lithuanian Army. On 17 August, it was officially declared that the Lithuanian People's Army was to be liquidated and reorganized into the 29th Rifle Corps of the Red Army. On 27 August, two days after the adoption of the new constitution copied from the 1936 Soviet Constitution, the order to liquidate the Ministry of Defense was given. Vitkauskas became the chairman of the liquidation commission, but he was mostly absent and most the work of the commission was handled by his deputy Stasys Ra≈°tikis. On 1 September, he was appointed commander of the 29th Rifle Corps; Feliksas Baltu≈°is-≈Ωemaitis became his deputy but soon was replaced by Russian major general Anatoly Rozanov (–ê–Ω–∞—Ç–æ–ª–∏–π –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤–∏—á –†–æ–∑–∞–Ω–æ–≤). The process of liquidating the Lithuanian Army continued until December 1940. According to data provided by Ra≈°tikis, during that time, about 15% of lower and 30% of higher officers as well as almost 50% of the generals were purged. On 29 December, Lithuanian generals were officially given Red Army ranks. Only Vitkauskas was given the rank of lieutenant general. On 23 February 1941, Vitkauskas swore allegiance to the Red Army. =Later life and evaluation= On 15 June 1941, just a week before the Nazi German invasion of Russia, Vitkauskas was sent to the Military Academy of the General Staff in Moscow to complete courses for higher officers. It was part of a larger initiative to send Lithuanian officers to various courses and replace them with Russians. Two explanations are given ‚Äì as a preparation for the German invasion or a precaution against a possible mutiny due to the June deportation. According to Vitkaukas' wife, the orders to depart to Moscow were urgent and Vitkauskas was placed under armed guard at the railway station. After the completion of the courses in December 1941, he taught tactics of the great military formations. He was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union from 1941 to 1954. In 1946, Vitkauskas returned to Lithuania and taught at the Kaunas University and from 1950 at the Kaunas Polytechnic Institute until retirement in November 1954. He became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1950 and was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR from 1955 to 1963. Vitkauskas contributed articles, mostly memoirs and commentary on current events, to communist press, including Tiesa and Kauno tiesa. He wrote several poems for children, which were published in 1927, 1965, and 1980. He also translated plays by Alexander Ostrovsky (including The Storm published in 1948) and short stories by Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy (first published in 1949). He died in 1965 and was buried in the Petra≈°i≈´nai Cemetery. Vitkauskas is a controversial figure in the history of Lithuania. On one hand, he loyally served in the Lithuanian Army for over two decades (1919‚Äì1940). On the other hand, he actively collaborated with the Soviet regime that arrested and executed many Lithuanian officers. Opinions range widely: from a traitor and a sleeper Soviet agent to a desperate man who contemplated suicide (according to Jonas ƒåernius) and mourned the loss of independence (according to his daughter). Historians further point out that Vitkauskas destroyed most sensitive and damning military archives before turning them to the Soviets. An objective evaluation is not possible due to lack of archival data (most relevant archives are kept in Russia). Awards Vitkaukas received the following awards: *Order of the Cross of Vytis (1920 and 1926) *Independence Medal (1928) *Silver Medal for the Liberation of Klaipƒóda (1929) *Order of Vytautas the Great (1930) *Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas (1934) *Riflemen's Star by the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union (1938) *Order of the Three Stars of Latvia (1938) *Order of the Red Star (1945) *Order of the Patriotic War (1947) *Order of Lenin (1950) References ;Notes: ;Bibliography:        External links * Autobiography Category:1890 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Communist Party of Lithuania politicians Category:First convocation members of the Soviet of Nationalities Category:Lithuanian collaborators with the Soviet Union (1940‚Äì41) Category:Lithuanian generals Category:Lithuanian people of World War I Category:Ministers of Defence of Lithuania Category:People from Suwa≈Çki Governorate Category:People from Vilkavi≈°kis District Municipality Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin Category:Recipients of the Order of the Cross of Vytis Category:Recipients of the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas Category:Recipients of the Order of Vytautas the Great Category:Russian military personnel of World War I Category:Second convocation members of the Soviet of the Union Category:Soviet lieutenant generals Category:Third convocation members of the Soviet of the Union Category:Vytautas Magnus University faculty ","title":"Vincas Vitkauskas"},{"id":"54043046","text":"Danny Norman Newland (born December 9, 1949 in Wapakoneta, Ohio) is an American freelance journalist, blogger, translator, editor, writer and ghostwriter.

History Before the colonization period of the Netherlands (before 1592), there was no dedicated unit acting as park ranger. However, the function was already covered in customary law and local culture and tradition in preserving and protection forest and its wildlife; these were already done from generation to generation. Dedicated personnel as park rangers were created, ', during the colonization period of the Netherlands. In 1620, formal rules were introduced, including prohibitions against cutting down forest trees without permits, and the introduction of ', whose main purpose was to help ' in preserving and protecting the forest.

Many Sri Lankan kings, beginning with King Vasabha, and up until the formation of Kingdom of Kandy, belonged to this clan or related clans. History The first reference to this clan is found in Mahavamsa, appearing during the reign of King Ilanaga. According to the Mahavamsa, the Lambakarna were royal attendants. They accompanied the king to Thiswewa. Upon returning from their journey, the Lambakarnas had left the king alone. Enraged, Ilanaga employed the Lambakarnas to menial work under the supervision of chandalas. In response, the Lambakarnas revolted and usurped the throne.Mahavansha(sinhala),Buddhist Cultural Center,2010,pp-150,151 Ilanaga eventually managed to take the throne back. Later, the Lambakarnas set up their own dynasty with the rule of King Vasabha. According to Kotte era sources, the Lambakarna is related to the clan that was entrusted to protect the Sri Maha Bodhi tree. King Vasabha began Lambakarna rule over the Anaradhapura Kingdom in 65 CE. They ruled for four centuries until the Pandyan invasion of Sri Lanka. References in Inscriptions and literature Members of the Lambakarna clan used titles such as \\"Lamani\\" and \\"Mahale\\", and were found frequently in inscriptions and literature. According to Dipavamsa, sixteen Lanka Mahalekhas (identified with the Lambakarna clan) arrived with the Sri Maha Bodhi. They functioned as chief guardians to the institutions and functioned as writers as well.Inscriptions of Ceylon ,Volume V, Part II,Department of Archaeology-Sri Lanka,2004 In addition, they are mentioned in Mahavansha, acting as parasol and flag bearers in coronation festivals.

Despite the founder's particular affiliation, the church intends to incorporate all forms of Taoism in Italy. The establishment of the church has been defined by a scholar of religious rights as a \\"crucial event for both Taoism and religious freedom in Italy\\". History After an earlier experience as the \\"Taoist Association of Italy\\" (Associazione Taoista d‚ÄôItalia) in the 1990s, master Vincenzo di Ieso‚ÄîLi Xuanzong ordained the first Italian disciples into Taoist priesthood in 2010, then formally constituting the Taoist Church of Italy on 14 November 2013. The statute of the organization is \\"designed according to Italian regulations and in the perspective of a future agreement with the state\\" (under article 8 of the Constitution of Italy, the Italian state officially recognizes a number of religious bodies through legal agreements). The Taoist Church of Italy would be the \\"first case in the world of a Taoist institution adopting such a type of confessional organization\\", according to the description given by the Italian CESNUR. At its dawn in China, however, Taoism organized itself into communitarian-confessional experiences,The churches of Â§™Âπ≥ÈÅì T√†ip√≠ngd√†o (\\"Way of the Great Peace\\") and ‰∫îÊñóÁ±≥ÈÅì W«îd«íum«êd√†o (\\"Way of the Five Pecks of Rice\\", otherwise called Â§©Â∏àÈÅì TiƒÅnshƒ´d√†o, \\"Way of the Celestial Masters\\") of the 2nd and 3rd century CE. . Online at archives-ouvertes.fr. pp. 6-15 to develop in later centuries merely as an ensemble of ritual traditions exercised by priestly lineages (transmitted generation by generation or by ordination) and monastic orders. Such character is maintained in contemporary China, where those who qualify for the title of \\"Taoist\\" are only the initiates of priestly and monastic orders, who exert their sacerdotal function within the framework of Chinese folk religion. Organization According to the statute of the church, \\"adherents\\" are all those members who are not \\"Taoists\\", that is to say all those members who have not formally undertaken any Taoist religious engagement and yet participate, even temporarily, to the activities of the church.TCI Statute, article 7 - Membri (\\"Members\\") The Taoist Church of Italy, which is recognized by the Chinese Taoist Association, makes a distinction between its lay members and its sacerdotal body in accordance with the Chinese Taoist tradition. Only the members of the sacerdotal body, whether novices or already ordained ones, may call themselves \\"Taoists\\" in the Chinese acceptation of the term (that is daoshi, literally \\"masters of the Tao\\"). All lay members may have access to the novitiate, formally choosing to apply Taoist ethical principles into their own life. Through an initiation, members may pass from the degree of adherents to that of novices, and thenceforth they may attend the courses of the Higher Academy of Taoist Education. If novices are then accepted as disciples by a master (shifu), a fully ordained priest, they may take the vows and be ordained themselves as daoshi. =Priests and monks= In the Taoist Church of Italy, \\"Taoists\\" or \\"actual Taoists\\" are all the novices and fully ordained priests. They guide the church (that is the body formed by all adherents) exerting liturgical functions and spiritual assistance. Newly ordained priests are formally appointed as \\"daoshi\\" by the Taoist Holy Ecclesiastical College, whose members confer on them the \\"License for the Ministerial Exercise of Taoist Liturgy\\" and inscribe them into the \\"Public Register of the Taoist Clergy\\". The newly ordained clergymen may choose, in accordance with their own vocation, to be simply priests with the possibility of getting married, or monks taking the vow of chastity. Thus, the Taoist Church of Italy embodies both the priestly and the monastic traditions of Taoism, which in China are respectively represented by the \\"Right Unity\\" orders (Ê≠£‰∏ÄÈÅì Zh√®ngyƒ´d√†o) and by the \\"Full Truth\\" orders (ÂÖ®ÁúüÈÅì Qu√°nzhƒìnd√†o). According to the statute of the church, there is no substantial difference between the two orders, being both equated in training and functions.TCI Statute, article 22 - Ministri di culto (\\"Worship ministers\\") =Higher Academy of Taoist Education= The Higher Academy of Taoist Education is a school of university level.TCI Statute, article 27 - Accademia Superiore di Educazione Taoista (\\"Higher Academy of Taoist Education\\") It works under the aegis of the Chinese Taoist Association organizing three-year courses for training Taoist novices in the theory, liturgy and energetic medicine of Taoism. =Taoist Holy Ecclesiastical College= The Taoist Holy Ecclesiastical College is a body of daoshi whose number may vary based on the needs of the occasion and on the numerical consistency of the entire clergy of the Taoist Church of Italy. Only those clergymen who are forty years of age and who have matured at least five years of religious activity may enter the college, although clergymen who do not meet such requirements and yet have matured exceptional merits may be admitted too into it. The Holy College is directed by a prior, a primus inter pares. The Holy College remains in office for four years and the constituent members may not receive more than two mandates.TCI Statute, article 20 - Sacro Collegio Ecclesiastico Taoista (\\"Taoist Holy Ecclesiastical College\\") Statistics According to the most recent data relative to the year 2014, provided by the Taoist Church of Italy to the CESNUR, the church is composed of 403 lessons‚Äô attendants, 352 participants, 83 novices and 16 fully ordained \\"Taoists\\" (daoshi).

She was successful in her only start as a two-year-old in 1992 and developed into a top-class middle-distance performer in the following year. She won the Prix Penelope, Prix Cl√©op√¢tre and Prix de Malleret in France before recording her biggest win in the Irish Oaks and also finished second in the Prix Vermeille. After being retired from racing she became a successful broodmare, producing the Arlington Million winner Beat Hollow. She died in April 2009 at the age of 19. Background Wemyss Bight was a bay mare with a white blaze and a white sock on her right hind leg bred in England by her owner Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte Farms. During her racing career she was trained in France by Andr√© Fabre. She was named after a town on Eleuthera in the Bahamas. Her sire Dancing Brave was the most highly rated British racehorse of the 1980s winning a series of major races culminating in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. At stud, he was a modest success, siring the Group One winners Commander in Chief, White Muzzle, Ivanka and Cherokee Rose before being sold and exported to Japan in 1991. Wemyss Bight's dam Bahamian was a high class staying mare who won the Lingfield Oaks Trial and was placed in the Prix de l'Esperance (finished first, disqualified), Prix de Pomone and Park Hill Stakes. As a broodmare, her other descendants have included Oasis Dream, Zenda and Kingman. Racing career =1992: two-year-old season= Wemyss Bight began her racing career in the Prix Messaline over 1800 metres on soft ground at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse on November 6, 1992. Ridden by Thierry Jarnet she won by five lengths from the Fran√ßois Boutin-trained Oubava. =1993: three-year-old season= Spring On her three-year-old debut Wemyss Bight was matched against the Prix des Ch√™nes winner Dancienne in the Group 3 Prix Penelope over 2100 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 16 April. Starting at odds of 2.4/1 she won by four lengths from Dancienne with a gap of six lengths back to Miss Kadrou. Four weeks later, over the same course and distance, she followed up in the Group 3 Prix Cleopatra, taking the lead in the straight and holding off the challenge of Bright Moon to win by a nose. Summer Wemyss Bight was then sent to England to contest the 215th running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 5 June. Ridden as in the Cleopatre by Pat Eddery she was made the 11/2 third choice in the betting behind Yawl and Intrepidity (also trained by Fabre). She reached third place in the straight but looked outpaced on the good-to-firm ground in the last quarter mile and finished fifth of the fourteen runners behind Intrepidity, Royal Ballerina, Oakmead and Sueboog. Three weeks later, with Jarnet in the saddle, she started 6/5 favourite for the Group 2 Prix de Malleret over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and won by four lengths from Diamonaka. On 10 July at the Curragh Wemyss Bight faced Intrepidity again in the Irish Oaks and started 9/2 second favourite behind her stablemate. Royal Ballerina and Oakmead were again in the field while the best fancied of the other seven runners were Takarouna (Pretty Polly Stakes) and Danse Royale (Derrinstown Stud 1,000 Guineas Trial). Racing on her favoured soft ground Wemyss Bight was restrained by Eddery in mid- division before beginning to make progress in the straight. She took the lead entering the final furlong and won by half a length from Royal Ballerina with Oakmead four and a half lengths back in third, just ahead of Intrepidity. After the race Eddery explained \\"I was told to hold up Wemyss Bight for a late run. At Epsom she didn't pick up at all in the straight, but I was confident that her form overall was equal to that of the favourite. This time Intrepidity had an off day and my filly left her English Oaks form behind\\". Autumn The third racecourse meeting between Wemyss Bight and Intrepidity came in the Prix Vermeille over 2400 metres at Longchamp on 12 September. Intrepidity won the race but Wemyss Bight looked an unlucky loser after being denied a clear run in the straight and then finishing strongly and failing by only a head to overhaul her rival. Wemyss Bight was strongly fancied for the 1993 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on 3 October, going off the 4/1 third favourite, but failed to recover after being hampered halfway through the race and trailed in 21st of the 23 runners. Intrepidity finished fourth. On her final start she was sent to California to contest the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita Park on 6 November. She started a 41/1 outsider and finished eighth of the fourteen runners behind Kotashaan. Breeding record After her retirement from racing Wemyss Bight became a broodmare for Juddmonte Farms. She produced at least eleven foals and four winners between 1995 and 2008: *Wemyss Quest, a bay colt (later gelded), foaled in 1995, sired by Rainbow Quest. Won six National Hunt races. *Yaralino, bay colt, 1996, by Caerleon. Won one race. *Beat Hollow, bay colt, 1997, by Sadler's Wells. Won seven races including Newmarket Stakes, Grand Prix de Paris, Manhattan Handicap, Turf Classic Stakes, Arlington Million. *Biloxi, bay filly, 1998, sired by Caerleon. Unraced. *Brightest, bay filly, 1999, by Rainbow Quest. Third in her only race. *Court Cave, bay colt, 2001, by Sadler's Wells. Unraced. *Bimini, bay filly, 2002, by Sadler's Wells.

Unraced. *Farmers Hill, chestnut colt (gelded), 2008, by Dalakhani. Failed to win in eleven races.

It is considered the founding book of sociological analysis of elections not only in France but also in the world. Siegfried's thesis: the influence of geology on the behaviour of voters Geological map of western France. In this book, the author analyses the influence of geographical and social determinants (structure of ownership, relation to authority, the influence of traditional structures) on the vote of the inhabitants of fifteen departments in western France. He thus compares different territorial units by postulating that there is a correlation between the social structures that are anchored in the local geography and the behaviour of the voters. Under this approach, and based on an old French saying that \\"the limestone gave the teacher and granite the priest\\", Siegfried then establishes a direct relationship between the geography of the Vend√©e and the vote of the people. In the geological division of the territory (in the north of the department, the granite bocage, to the south the calcareous plain), it is possible to superimpose according to him a division of the electoral behaviours. The very nature of the granitic soil favours the dispersal of the habitation, the rurality, the large landed property and Catholicism. All these factors, arising indirectly from the nature of the soil, may contribute to explaining the right-wing vote in northern Vend√©e at the time. On the contrary, the limestone soil favours a more restricted habitat, urbanity, small property and petite bourgeoisie. The role of the Church is less central in these areas. So the data may explain that the south of the Vend√©e department voted then (during the first years of the Third Republic) to the political left, that is to say in contrast to the north of the department. This work also explains the partition of the Vend√©e between the Republican south and the monarchist north during the French Revolution. Reception, criticism and posterity The Siegfried analysis has often been reduced to \\"granite votes right, limestone votes left\\", which lead to the work being decried as too simplistic by Raymond Aron (\\"on trouve l‚Äôh√©t√©rog√©n√©it√© g√©ographique quand on la cherche, on trouve les deux blocs quand on les organise\\"Revue fran√ßaise de science politique, 1955). Half a century later, in the Western Peasants, the historian Paul Bois fleshed out Siegfried's analysis on the basis of \\"this suggested idea of Siegfried, by the failure of the study of the past is essential to understanding the present\\", and by paying more attention to the weight of traditions inherited from the local French Revolution.

Only six manuscript copies are now known to exist, two are dated 1653 and the other four 1666. He was one of the early pioneers to use glass aquariums to study fish in life. He was also possibly the first to write on the migration and life-history of the salmon. The exact date of birth of Baldner is unknown but he was born in an old fisher family in Strasbourg. He married Salome, daughter of Hans Michael Fries on January 25, 1636 and had four children. He married his second wife Anna Ursula, daughter of a goldsmith, Abraham Sprengel in 1650 and they had four children. He worked as a toll collector, later a forester and then a forest manager. After the death of his second wife, he married Barbara, daughter of Benedictus Grossen, a professor of Hebrew. They too had four children of whom the youngest son, Andreas born in February 1673 transcribed the manuscripts of his father. Baldner died on February 1, 1694 and is buried in the Saint-Urbain cemetery in Strasbourg. A facsimile edition of Baldner's manuscript was published by Robert Lauterborn in 1903 although there are slight differences between the plates among the various surviving manuscript editions. It included three parts; the first on birds included 68 species while the second dealt with 45 fishes and crustaceans. The third part included quadrupeds and other animals. His writings were based on personal observation and he did not rely on reports by others. He hired a Strasbourg artist, Johann Georg Walther, to illustrate the book. At least one and probably two copies of the book were obtained by Francis Willughby in 1663. The German text was translated into English for Willughby and his collaborator John Ray by Frederick Slare.

With the length of , it is the second longest cave in Serbia after the long Lazar's Cave. Waterfall at the entrance to the cave  Location  The cave is located east of the village of Cerje in the Municipality of Pantelej and north of the City of Ni≈°.  Geology  Entry into the Cerje cave is situated on the western side of the Kalafat mountain, in the wider area of the Kameniƒçki vis plateau. Entrance is located at the point where the river of Provalijska reka sinks underground. The cave itself is hydrologically active. Geologists estimate that the cave is some 2 million years old. The cave is characterized by the small and narrow entry section and the large dimensions of the Main corridor, which is mostly over , but also up to high, which points to the different genesis of the two features. Right behind the ending of the low entry section, a large fossil canal was discovered. Today it ends with the plug of blocks, but it is believed that it represents the connection with the old entries into the cave which are now buried under the eroded sides of the amphitheater which marks the ending of the Provalijska reka's blind valley. The Cerje cave is a wet cave. Even during the summer, when the river dries out, there are ponds at the entrance. Further in the cave, the water flows for through the Main corridor, up to the siphon. Other corridors, including the High canal (which is above the central flow), even though they have water in the eroded holes, doesn't seem to have an active water flow. Area of the cave between the siphon and the \\"Salomna chamber\\" is called the Moon canal and is carved in the black limestone, eroded into sharp, pointy forms. Eroded water holes are everywhere and the upper sections of almost all corridors, even those deep in the cave, are abundant in allogenic pebblestone and gravel which remained in the niches. It shows that the entire cave was once filled with the allogenic material which was later washed away. Geology had to be different at that time as the modern topography and hydrography in the surrounding area of the cave does not point to the river flow so powerful to wash away the cave. Ceiling of the cave is partially made of an unusual mass which has an appearance of the decomposing limestone. Microscopic analysis showed that the limestone used to be altered by the thermal waters. Today, there are several thermal springs at the foothills, west of the cave, but the role of these thermal springs in the formation of the cave has still to be explored. The cave was explored for the first time in 1976 by the members of the Belgrade Mountaineering Union when it was established that the cave was long which, at the time, made it the longest cave in Serbia. Plans were made to turn it into a touristic attraction so the narrow entrance was widened by the explosives and the silt brought by the Provalijska reka was removed. However, the job of turning it into the touristic destination was never achieved. Since the 1970s, the river has washed away the beams which were placed in 1976 to function as the bridges and again brought silt which turned the entrance into the narrow passage, up to high, that can only be passed by crawling. Thought to be completely explored, the cave was left unattended until the fall of 1995 when the members of the Student speleologic and alpinistic club (ASAK) explored the cave again and discovered that there is an extension to the main corridor. In July 1996 they returned and discovered of new corridors, raising the overall length to , with the total depth of . The Provalijska reka, which enters the cave at an altitude of , springs again as the well of Kravljansko vrelo at an altitude of , northwest of the entrance into the Cerje cave. Explorations in 1996 established that the Kravljansko vrelo is away and beneath the siphons which mark the end of the cave. Dye tracing conducted in the 1970s proved the connection between the cave and the well of Kravljansko vrelo, but members of ASAK wanted to dive through the well to the cave. Due to the technical problems, they had to quit at the depth of . Another feature which is suspected to be connected to the cave is the pit above the Kravljansko vrelo. It is located at an altitude of and is deep. In the winter of 1996 ASAK explored the pit again. Strong air drift from the eroded shaft at the bottom of the pit points to the existence of the spacious canal in the pit's extension, which is most likely connected to the Cerje cave. Previous measurements showed that the pit is located right above the cave's \\"Salomna chamber\\" which is located at the end of the corridor, as much as it was explored at the time. However, repeated measurements showed that the pit is actually east of the cave's canal and that the pit's bottom is close to the level of the Kravljansko vrelo, below the cave's siphon. A plan was made to dig through the pit's bottom shaft in order to make an easier access to the distant areas of the cave. The pit corridors and the spring are called Gornjekravljansko vrelo or Peƒáurina. Explorations in August‚ÄìSeptember 1998 lengthened the cave's total size to . A bypass was discovered around the siphon at the then ending of the corridor. New extension is wide and wet and away from the well of the Kravljansko vrelo. In September 1999, a new attempt of diving through the well followed, but again had to be stopped at the depth of , this time because of the plug made of the sand and silt sediments. It is assumed that during the period of the spring high waters, the plug is probably washed away, establishing connection between the siphon and the well. In October 1999, new corridors were explored and the cave is at the moment long, out of which the Main corridor has . Total depth is . Passages which lead to the extension behind the siphon were widened and the new corridor is named \\"Via Kravlje\\". \\"Via Kravlje\\" is only away from the Kravljansko vrelo, but as it ends on both sides with the siphons, further explorations can only be conducted by the speleo divers. At that moment, it was the third longest cave in Serbia after the Lazar's Cave and the U≈°ak Cave system. In 2015, new corridors were discovered, and an assumption that they connect the cave with the Kravljansko vrelo was confirmed in December 2016 when the corridors were successfully passed through. The new corridor to Kravljansko vrelo was named the \\"Houdini passage\\" and the final feature in it is the Siphon II. In August 2017, the speleologist finally reached what they believe is the end of cave but they also established that the Cerje Cave System consists of the cave (Provalija), the spring of Kravljansko vrelo and the corridors surrounding the Peƒáurina pit above. A narrow vertical shaft near the small cave lake was also explored, two narrows were widened and the area from the \\"Chamber of Blocks\\" to the high interior ridge was also examined. The explorers wish to continue examination of the cave and to find whether it is connected to another local pit, Cerjanska propast. With the total measured length of , it is the second longest cave in Serbia.  Name  Original, local name for the cave was Provalija, after the river which sinks into the cave. Provalija is Serbian for chasm or abyss. Speleologists who explored the cave named it Cerjanka, after the village of Cerje as the cave is located in the village territory. Official name was established as the Cerjanska peƒáina (Cerje cave).  Characteristics  Varieties of the speleothems that developed in the cave include stalactites, stalagmites, helictites, wave draperies, cave corals and crystal flowers. The cave is especially noted for its helictities or the cave roses, which are actually stalactites that have a central canal with twig-like or spiral projections that appear to defy gravity. They can have many forms and those in Cerje cave are rose-like, as they spread in all directions due to the air currents. Cave roses, like the ones formed in the cave are not found in any other locality in the Balkans.  Wildlife  The cave is abundant in fire salamanders.  Protection  The Cerje cave is under protection since 1955. In 1998, Institute for nature conservation of Serbia declared the cave a natural monument. In 2013 another plan for the turning of the cave into the touristic attraction was announced. Two mini dams and one bridge were built on the Provalijska reka in order to prevent it from burying the entrance with silt. But as of 2017, the cave is still not open for public.

After these sufferings, Stalaƒá is not mentioned anymore, neither in Turkish nor Hungarian sources on their respective military campaigns. It must be that the fortification was no more in use or worth mentioning. It could be that the level of destruction of the ramparts, towers and the size of the fortification made reconstruction difficult and hard, plus the fact that Stalaƒá lost its strategic importance as it found itself far back in the background of Turkish goal for conquests.

The test is defined according to the Eumos 40509 standard. The test was invented by Marc Juwet of KU Leuven in 2008 and is now in worldwide use. As with other types of cargo, a pallet load must be properly secured during transport. In most cases it is impractical to secure every product on the pallet. To make sure that the load does not significantly deform, it must be properly packed.  Eumos 40509  In 2012 the Eumos40509 standard described a method to certify packaging effectiveness. A test pallet is put on a loading platform that is accelerated at a constant acceleration for 0.3 seconds or longer. This constant acceleration level must be reached within 50ms. During the test the sides of the pallet load are not supported, thus allowing the products and the packaging to deform. Most often an acceleration level of 0.5 gravities is used according to legislation in most countries. Eumos 40509 includes certification criteria. Maximum elastic deformation must not exceed 10%, maximum permanent product deformation must not exceed 5% and packaging must not be damaged during the test. The test certificate includes a detailed description of the load under test as well as a picture of the pallet load before and after the test. Certified pallet loads must carry a label mentioning the date of the test, the name of the test institute, the producer and the maximum inertial force. Pallet loads that resist an acceleration test up to 0.5 g, can be prevented from sliding and tilting in the transverse transport direction. Most often a single lashing, support by a vehicle wall or other pallet loads provide a legally required safety level in most countries.

George French, CEO of Rocketplane Limited, announced on 27 February 2006 that he was purchasing Kistler Aerospace for an undisclosed sum, and renaming it Rocketplane Kistler. Kistler Aerospace had designed and begun construction of the K-1 launch vehicle, a fully reusable two-stage to orbit launcher, but filed for bankruptcy before the vehicle could be completed. French used the K-1 to bid for commercial crew and cargo resupply contracts to the International Space Station under the NASA COTS (Commercial Orbital Transportation Services) program. This contract was awarded jointly to SpaceX and Rocketplane Kistler on 18 August 2006.  Space tourism  Rocketplane Limited intended to fly space tourism flights using the Rocketplane XP spaceplane it was building. It had announced plans to fly the XP in 2007, but on August 31, 2007 its chief executive officer, Calvin Burgess, said test flights would be delayed until 2009 and commercial flights were pushed back until at least 2010. Rocketplane anticipated ticket prices of US$200,000 for a seat on a suborbital flight, including 4 minutes of weightlessness, with an apogee of over 100 kilometers altitude.  Bankruptcy Space News, Aviation Week and the Oklahoma Gazette reported layoffs and funding problems. These publications reported, \\"Rocketplane Kistler officials failed to meet a funding deadline mandated by a NASA contract to build a reusable rocket ...\\" Space News reported in a June 25, 2007 story, \\"... if RpK [Rocketplane Kistler] misses the new deadline, it would be the fourth time the company has gone back to NASA and requested an extension.\\" On October 18, 2007, NASA discontinued its agreement with Rocketplane Kistler, and announced that the remaining $175 million commitment to the project would be made available to other companies. On October 19, the company appealed the decision, and asked NASA to reconsider the termination or, alternatively, pay $10 million in costs incurred to date. In February 2009, Rocketplane vacated its Oklahoma City headquarters building. According to Oklahoma State Representative David Dank, Rocketplane no longer has any presence in the state, but Rocketplane has paid all of its taxes and has no outstanding debts which is remarkable for a company to accomplish this while going bankrupt. Rocketplane filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and liquidation in July 2010.  Out of Bankruptcy  In 2011 Rocketplane Limited's assets were sold in an auction and bought by George French and John Burgener. The assets were rolled into the new company Rocketplane Global LLC, based in De Pere, Wisconsin. Focus moved from passenger flights with the XP spaceplane to satellites with the Pathfinder / XS larger rocketplane. Rocketplane Global significantly updated and revised the Pathfinder plans to submit a bid for DARPA's XS-1 program, but did not win a contract. Rocketplane Global moved its state of incorporation to Delaware in April, 2017, to allow for better financing opportunities  New Life  Rocketplane Global Inc. has one of the most affordable designs to provide reusable launch services for small to medium satellites. With an expected retail price of $20 million per launch, and a 2,000 kg payload to LEO, Rocketplane Global can provide launch services at half the present retail pricing on launches. Rocketplane Global has agreements to launch over 100 satellites starting in 2021 - 2022 if it can obtain sufficient funding in 2017.  The XS design  Rocketplane Global's XS design follows on the work done on the XP passenger vehicle and continues using jet engines for take off and flight to altitude. It then loads on LOX and fuel from a tanker airplane, and then fires its rocket engines and flies to 100+ km, where it releases a second stage booster to carry the satellite(s) to orbit. With a totally reusable first stage, and an expendable second stage, the costs are minimized and the system is more reliable than trying to land vertical take off and landing rockets. The Rocketplane XS bears some similarity to the Black Horse concept.

The SMART task force is a United Nations INSARAG certified Heavy USAR (Urban Search and Rescue team) in June 2016. The team draws its members from the Malaysian Armed Forces, Royal Malaysian Police and Fire and Rescue Department of Malaysia.  History  Malaysia has been through three major disasters since 1988 which is Sultan Abdul Halim ferry terminal bridge collapse in the year 1988, Bright Sparklers Fireworks disaster in 1991 and Klang Port Chong Hong 3 Tanker Explosion in 1992. The pinnacle of disaster in Malaysia happens in the year 1993 when the Highland Towers collapse in Ulu Klang, outskirt of Kuala Lumpur. The tragedy came to world attention in which five countries sent aid workers to help. They are from the USA, Great Britain, D√©tachement d'intervention catastrophes a√©romobile (DICA) from France, Japan Disaster Relief Team (JDRT) from Japan and Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (DART) from Singapore. The JDRT lead by Kiyoshi Shidara then donates their sophisticated equipment to Malaysia. Following the collapse of the Highland Towers tragedy on 11 December 1993, Malaysia intends to establish a disaster rescue team based on the Japanese JDRT. The Cabinet Committee then convened on 18 May 1994 approved the establishment of the SMART team under the management of the National Security Council. The SMART will draw its members from three government departments which are Fire and Rescue Department of Malaysia (FRDM), Royal Malaysian Police (RMP) and the Malaysian Armed Forces (MAF). On 1 August 1996, the SMART finally established with a strength of 85 personnel including officers. SMART is put under the National Security Council. On 1 January 2004, SMART is expanded to 104 personnel. On 1 June 2009, SMART moving to new SMART Headquarter in Pulau Meranti, Puchong. On 1 June 2014, SMART is expanding again to 141 personnel and their salary grade was standardised. On May 2015, SMART planning to apply for INSARAG certification. On 5 June 2016, SMART gets INSARAG certification. With this certification, SMART is the second Disaster Relief team to be certified in Southeast Asia after the Singaporean Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team. On 11 April 2019, the SMART was chosen to become a mentor to the Brunei rescue team. SMART will assist the team until they get their INSARAG certification.  Functions  Under National Security Council Directive No.19 and Directive No.20, there are four main functions of SMART outlined by the Malaysian Government: # Act to perform search and rescue duties which the task is beyond the capabilities of existing rescue agencies. # Conduct search and rescue operations which require high expertise and sophisticated equipment. # Responsible in the event which is expected to be a major disaster and involving many victims. # Act to help in overseas disasters when directed to do so by the Prime Minister.

History The building was designed as offices for the Territorial Force Association and completed in 1913. The building has two halls and is therefore designed to accommodate two military units, typically a cavalry or infantry regiment in one hall and an artillery regiment in the other hall. In early 1914 the cavalry / infantry hall became the headquarters of the 1st (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers) and the artillery hall became the headquarters of the London Brigade of the Royal Field Artillery. The 1st (City of London) Battalion was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 and was deployed on railway guarding duties before sailing for Malta and, ultimately, for the Western Front. By 1936 the London Brigade of the Royal Field Artillery had been replaced by the 90th Field Brigade Royal Artillery in the artillery hall. When the London Regiment was broken up and the battalions reallocated to other units in August 1937, the cavalry / infantry hall became the home of the 8th (1st City of London) Battalion The Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment). In December 1946 the 8th (1st City of London) Battalion was placed in suspended animation and the cavalry / infantry hall fell vacant. In 1947 the City of London Yeomanry (Rough Riders) occupied the cavalry / infantry hall which became known as \\"Yeomanry House\\". At the same time there was a re-organisation in the Royal Artillery, and 240 Field Regiment (City of London) Royal Artillery occupied the artillery hall, by then known as \\"Artillery House\\". The whole complex was taken over by 3 Military Intelligence Battalion in 1965 and by London University Officers' Training Corps in 1992. It is also the home of the Army Training Unit London.

Early life and military  Homer Hurst was born on October 25, 1919 in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas as one of nine children born to Theodore and Elva Harvey Hurst. Homer enlisted in the United States Navy in 1942, and served as a pilot in the South Pacific during World War II. Hurst married Beverly Arnold in 1944 and they had four children: Ted, Hyla, JaNan and Rhoda. Hurst continued in the Naval Reserves as a pilot for 20 years after the war, and flying became a lifelong passion.  Education and career  Following his military service, Hurst attended Ohio State University. Upon graduating with multiple engineering degrees in 1955, he was hired as an agricultural engineering and architecture research professor at Virginia Tech. Hurst spent the next 35 years at Virginia Tech and became a charter member of the National Institute of Building Sciences in 1974. He retired from teaching in 1990 at the age of 70.  Research projects  As an architecture research professor, Hurst received multiple awards from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for his research project and publications. = \\"The Solar House\\" = Hurst's most notable research project is \\"The Solar House\\", a passive solar housing research project in Blacksburg, Virginia in 1980. The project demonstrated energy conservation methods based on passive solar principles and innovative wood framing techniques. Beyond its inventive passive solar design, a remarkable aspect of the project was its use of just one third of the typical amount of building materials of a traditional wood framed home. This accounted for savings of more than 25% of overall construction costs and 44% of energy costs by using solar power. Hurst's design was selected as one of 19 finalist out of over 200 entries in HUD's \\"Building Value into Housing\\" competition in 1980. He and Jerry Smith presented the project in an article titled \\"The Hillside Fourplex Housing\\" in 1981. Construction of the prototype was completed in the summer of 1982. Since then, the quadruplex has been leased to Virginia Tech students. It is located at 500 Harrell St in Blacksburg, VA and is commonly referred to as \\"The Solar House\\". = Other published works and projects = Hurst published a number of his research projects in books, journals and magazines, including: * Structurally balanced roof frames, (1963): Co-authored with JPH Mason * Tilt- up timber rigid frame buildings, (1964): Co-authored with N.F. Meador, and E.L. Townsend, published by Virginia Tech. * The wood frame house as a structural unit, (1965): Part I, Floor deflection as influenced by various stages of construction, published by Virginia Tech. * The wood frame house as a structural unit, (1966): 29 pages, published by Virginia Tech. * Pole-type, tilt-up economy house design: the first generation prototype, (1973): Published by Virginia Tech. * Engineered housing reduces initial cost/accommodates solar heating, (1976): With Sandra J.

However, by being both a materials and building code expert, Hurst was fully aware of a building's constructability in terms of the material's limitation and overall safety. Hurst was a proponent of affordable housing, evident in his strong support for Habitat for Humanity. He also served on a governor appointed committee, formed to update Virginia's dated building codes. Being a veteran inspired Hurst with his efforts to improve military housing. In 1986, Mortimer M. Marshall, Jr., FAIA, fellow founding member of the National Institute of Building Sciences said, \\"Homer‚Äôs research at Virginia Tech was a great help in our efforts to improve the quality and performance of military housing throughout the world. His research results will continue to have an everlasting effect on the housing industry.\\"  Retirement and death  In 1990, after retiring from teaching, Homer T. Hurst remained in Blacksburg, VA and spent most of his time managing his rental properties during his retirement. Hurst died on October 31, 2011, shortly after his wife, Beverly's death on August 11 of the same year.

Visser was mostly known for his travel reports and lectures about his expeditions to the Karakoram Mountains in the far north of then British India. Biography Visser was born on May 8 1882 in Schiedam, where his father was the owner of a small restaurant. After completing the HBS, he followed a trade education and became a partner in this company. After a trip to Switzerland, Visser became fascinated by high mountains and alpinism. He climbed several peaks in the Alps and wrote a book about nature and topography of the high mountain, which for the first time proved his talent for writing. In 1912, he married Jenny Hooft, who shared his fascination with the mountains. Expeditions =Early years= A portrait of Visser in Sweden in 1920 aged 30 The couple undertook an expedition to the Caucasus in 1914 to return to Russia after the outbreak of the First World War. Back in the Netherlands, Visser gave lectures on his journey. In 1916 a second trip to Russia followed. After the war, Visser worked as an attach√© in the Dutch parish in Stockholm in 1919. He was able to explore Finland in the following years, to make another trip to Switzerland and to visit the Arabian peninsula. In Stockholm, he met the well-known Swedish explorer Sven Hedin and discovered the idea of exploring the Karakoram. This mountain in the middle of Asia was still largely empty on maps. This fantasized Visser. Visser and his wife organized four expeditions to Karakoram between 1922 and 1935, which at that time formed the inhospitable border between British India, Tibet and Central Asia. The couple was accompanied by the Swiss mountain guides Franz Lochmatter and Johann Brantschen. During the first expedition in 1922, on eastern part of the mountain, around the Saser Muztagh, was explored by the group. Visser (front left) with his wife and guides Franz Lochmatter (right) and Johann Brantschen (left) on their return to the Netherlands after the first Karakorum expedition With the same participants, a second expedition followed between November 1924 and January 1926, to the area north of the Great Karakoram, which at the time belonged largely to the Hunza State. To investigate the animal world, biologist Lex Sillem was part of the third Karakoram expedition of the Fishermen (between February 1929 and January 1931). During this expedition, Sinkiang was overwhelmed by visiting Kashgar and Yarkand. The expeditions performed pioneering work for later alpinists in the Karakoram. One expedition that climbed some lower peaks and explored the routes that would be used by later climbers to clamp the eight-thousand-one in the area. With the help of Afraz Ghul Khan and Muhammad Akram of the Survey of India, the extremely inhospitable Karakoram was accurately mapped. Visser studied the location, shape and flow of the glaciers while his wife documented the local flora. Visser findings found that the Karakoram glaciers hold the middle between those in the Alps, which originate in firnbekkens, and those in the Pamir (Sinkiang and Russian Turkestan), which are mainly fed out of avalanches. This as the first time these glaciers were ever mapped. =Karakoram expedition findings and reports= Back in the Netherlands, work was started on detailed scientific expedition reports published in different volumes between 1923 and 1940. Besides glaciology, Philips Visser also took account of scientific dissertations on the population and meteorology of the area. In addition, he gave lectures and wrote articles in newspapers, giving the couple publicity. Following the third Karakoram expedition, Visser was appointed Dutch council in British India in 1931. For this work, he moved back and forth between Calcutta (the winter capital) and Simla (the summer capital of British India). In 1932, the Fishermen received the unique opportunity to visit Nepal, a kingdom that was still strictly closed for European travelers at that time. In 1933, they traveled to Dutch-Indie on behalf of the Dutch government. In the summer of 1935 a fourth Karakoram expedition followed and in 1937 a trip to Dutch-India was made again. Diplomacy career In 1938, Visser was appointed ambassador to Istanbul, Turkey. In 1945, Visser was transferred to South Africa, where he also served as an envoy. Between 1948 and his retirement in 1950 he was still a Dutch ambassador to Moscow. Later life and death Even in his later years Visser remained active in his diplomacy and mountaineering career. In 1949 he climbed the Table Mountain and visited the Drakens Mountain. On May 3, 1955 Visser died of heart failure in his sleep at the age of 76. Personal life In 1939, a year after he began his diplomatic career, his first wife Jenny Hooft died. This was a huge loss for Visser who later said: \\"Ze was mijn beste vriend, ik zal haar nooit vergeten\\" or in English \\"She was my best friend - I will never forget her\\". Nevertheless, he remarried Cornelie Alexine de Graeff in 1941. The couple had three children together.

In 1983, the President of Nigeria, Shehu Shagari issued an executive order mandating immigrants without proper immigration documents to leave the country or they would be arrested according to the law. The order was in alleged response to the religious disturbances that had engulfed parts of the country in 1980 (Kano 1980 Riots ) and 1981. Most of the immigrants were West Africans and mainly Ghanaians. Over 2 million men, women and children were affected. This is part of a recurring incident in West Africa, where immigrants are expelled for various reasons. Examples of such directives within West African countries include deportations from Ghana of Nigerians in 1954, Cote d'ivore deportation of Togolese, Dahomeyans and Nigerians in 1958, and deportation of aliens (mostly Nigerians) from Ghana in 1969. Over 1 Million Ghanaians and other west Africans were affected by the order. These Migrants were mostly attracted to Nigeria because of the oil market of the 70's, but in 1983 when the \\"Ghana Must Go\\" revolution started, the economy had weakened and was fast falling apart. It was also the election year. The major route to Ghana was through the West passing through Benin and Togo. Once the migrants got to Benin, the way out was restricted. Those who had already made it to Benin were stuck in the port of Cotonou, the capital city of Benin, with hopes of getting a boat to Ghana. The problems they experienced didn't end there, because due to an attempted coup the previous year, Ghana's president Jerry Rawlings had closed the main land crossing with Togo to avoid the sudden arrival of over 1 Million people. Togo then also shut its borders with Benin. The Ghanaian immigrants were stranded for weeks, thereafter the Ghanaian authority opened their borders causing Togo to also open theirs, for the Ghanaian to have access back home. The relationship between Nigeria and Ghana has since been strengthened.  Ghana Must Go Bag  A type of cheap matted woven nylon zipped tote bags, used by the migrants to move their belongings got the moniker \\"Ghana must go\\" during the migration. As of 2019, the bag is still commonly referred to with this name in most parts of Nigeria, Ghana, and certain parts of West Africa The bag has a variety of names worldwide in Germany it is called the \\"Tuerkenkoffer\\" (Turkish suitcase), in the USA , it is called the \\"Chinatown tote\\", in Guyana it is called the \\"Guyanese Samsonite\\" and the \\"Refugee Bag\\" in various places around the world.

In 1986, international pressure on apartheid had mounted so much that the American film company Columbia Pictures threatened to boycott South Africa's Ster Kinekor theatre chain if they did not end segregation of their cinemas in 1987. In January 1987, the then- Pietersburg (now Polokwane) Town Council of the Transvaal, controlled by the Conservative Party, recommended that a cinema in the town continue to be segregated. Officially, the cinema was reserved for whites only; however, blacks were allowed entry through a back entrance and to view from a special gallery. The owner of the cinema, Sydney Segal, collected more than 1,000 signatures in a petition calling for desegregation, and Cruywagen overruled the town council's recommendation, approving the opening of the cinema to all races.Race Relations Survey, 1988 by the South African Institute of Race Relations In the late 1980s, Cruywagen described the transformation of African councils from advisory bodies in the 1970s into local authorities in the 1980s as the \\"most important constitutional event in the history of this country\\", and recommended that black and white people jointly govern the Transvaal province.

This concept has largely been developed by Andreas Wimmer and Nina Glick Schiller, who specifically define it as \\"the assumption that the nation/state/society is the natural social and political form of the modern world\\". Methodological Nationalism has been identified in many social science subfields, such as anthropology, sociology, and the interdisciplinary field of migration studies. Methodological Nationalism, as a practice within Social Science, has been further critiqued by scholars such as Saskia Sassen, who contends that the nation-state and its borders are an insufficient unit of analysis and that the national is at times the \\"terrains of the global\\".  Three types of methodological nationalism  Per Andreas Wimmer and Nina Glick Schiller, there are three types of methodological nationalism in social science scholarship: ignoring or disregarding the importance of nationalism for modern societies, naturalization, and confining studies to geopolitical boundaries of a particular nation-state. These types may co-occur or occur separately. When they co-occur, they may reinforce each other.  Methodological Nationalism and Migration Studies  Methodological Nationalism and its conception of nation-states has been a component of both contemporary and historical methodologies in migration studies, insofar as certain studies have adhered to it or diverged from its theoretical foundations. This adherence has been acknowledged or otherwise criticized in numerous studies. Moreover, the historical prevalence of methodological nationalism within social science has been explored by scholarship which argues that many turn-of-the-century writings on globalization have \\"conflated the necessary conceptual critique of methodological nationalism with the empirical claim of the nation-state‚Äôs diminishing relevance\\". On the other hand, research on transnationalism and transmigrants has contemporary examples of divergence and criticism of methodological nationalism as an enduring practice in scholarship. Recent studies in transnationalism have conceived of the nation-state as one agent in a complex relationship with many global actors. Migration Studies that conceive of society as extending beyond national boundaries, then, sever this link between nation-state and society. Research on transnational Latina motherhood has negotiated issues of the nation-state as well as transnationalism. The conceptual frameworks of power geometries, social location, and geographic scales is positioned to counteract the analytical tendency to fall back on methodological nationalism. Other scholarly research has combined transnational migration studies and conceptual frameworks such as coloniality of power to avoid methodological nationalism and better account for the intersecting transnational phenomena that constitutes the experiences of transmigrants and better explains the processes of transnational migration. Colonial Modernity and Methodological Nationalism  This video is of a lecture by Sujata Patel at University of Hyderabad (India), given on September 21, 2011 talking about effects of Methodological Nationalism in India.

Despite the presence of many well-known artists among its lineup, the event remains largely unknown. It is considered by some to have been the first rock festival. Inception Towards the end of 1966, Grantham promoter, former footballer Brian Thompson, set about booking Geno Washington and the Ram Jam Band and The Move. Their management persuaded Thompson to also book three relatively unknown acts at that time, being Pink Floyd, The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Cream. The event was held in Spalding at the tulip auction hall, most likely the largest building in the area that could hold a large crowd. In addition, Zoot Money's Big Roll Band were booked along with a local covers outfit, Sounds Force 5, who were booked to ensure a decent turnout and were to perform in all changeovers between each band at the side of the stage. Advertising was national and massively underestimated, with thousands making their way to the market town causing national radio to warn travellers to turn back. Attendance numbers have been estimated with a venue capacity of 6,000 and twice as many unable to gain entry. Tickets cost just ¬£1 and covered accommodation came in the form of the Spalding Town F.C. stand next door.

The event appeared to be unorganised and the sound terrible. Whilst the venue at the start for Pink Floyd was bare this quickly became overfull with fans being trapped underneath the stage. The two bands grouped under Psychedelic started, Pink Floyd and The Move, followed by the two Blues Rock groups, Jimi Hendrix and Cream. Pink Floyd performed at the rear of the venue using a white bed sheet to project moving images. Hendrix had many issues, including tuning problems, was late on stage meaning only a half hour set and finished by setting fire to his guitar and trashing his speaker stack. It was widely agreed that Clapton out played Hendrix that day and that Geno Washington made a great show. Legacy Whilst a groundbreaking event for its time in the Summer of Love ahead of the famous Monterey Pop Festival and possibly the first Rock music festival in the UK, the event remains largely unknown outside of its home. The event became a one off in Spalding due to opposition from local residents. Thompson, however, moved to a location in nearby Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, for the 1968 event, Barn Barbeque Concert and Dance, which included Donovan, Fairport Convention, Fleetwood Mac and The Move. In 2009 the event was featured in the BBC TV show Inside Out.http://www.spaldingtoday.co.uk/news/memories-of- barbeque-67-featured-on-tv-programme-1-582235 In 2016 a blue plaque commemorated the event, placed at the Red Lion Hotel where Jimi Hendrix resided that night. The 50th anniversary of the event is to be commemorated in the town at The Punchbowl with a Jimi Hendrix Experience tribute band and local covers groups. The event is the subject of a 2017 play, Barbecue ‚Äô67 Revisited, based on the concert by the Nottingham-based theatre group 'Excavate'.

Both insects are native to Europe, but the sawfly has been accidentally introduced into North America where it has become established. The larvae of the sawfly tunnel into developing apple fruitlets which later fall to the ground, where the larvae continue their development. The wasp parasitises the larvae and has been released in North America as part of a biological control programme for the sawfly. Ecology In a research study in the Netherlands, L. ensator was the only parasitoid of the apple sawfly larvae that was found, and the sawfly was the only host used by it. The wasp preferentially chose second instar larvae in which to lay eggs, and the spring emergence of the adult wasp usually synchronised with this stage of the host's life cycle. The female wasp produced around 150 eggs but did not actually oviposit as many as half of these. Use in biological control In Europe, the apple sawfly is part of the food web, but when it was accidentally introduced into North America, there were no natural enemies to control it and it caused much damage to the apple crop. In a classical biological control programme. L. ensator was released into Quebec between 1994 and 2001 and became established in the Frelighsburg area. Further work was undertaken between 2002 and 2015 to spread the parasite throughout eastern North America. This was done by collecting fallen fruitlets of apple trees in infected orchards in the Frelighsburg area, and scattering them in orchards in other parts of Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia and New Hampshire. As a result of this introduction, the wasp became established in three other parts of Quebec and in Hilton in Ontario.

In the night, about 50 to 80 heavily-armed robbers closed off the perimeter of the office with cars and, during a three-hour assault, were reportedly able to access at least one of the three vaults of the company. One police officer was killed, and several people were wounded. The robbers were thought to have taken between 8 million to US$40 million. According to Prosegur, US$8 million were missing from one vault. Authorities have assumed that the robbers came from and returned to Brazil where an apparent staging house was found across the border in Foz do Igua√ßu. A subgroup of the robbers was reported to be intercepted in Itaipulandia resulting in a gun battle during which three suspects were killed and four arrested.

Familial background  Chevalier Robert Sutton de Clonard was born to Thomas Sutton de Clonard, an officer in the French East India Company, and to Phyllis Masterson, from Castletown. Thomas Sutton de Clonard travelled several times to India on business. Several members of the family served in the Navy, notably Robert's uncle Lieutenant Thomas de Clonard, and Robert's younger brother, who was killed on 15 December 1778 during the Battle of St. Lucia while serving on Languedoc.Familia 1990: Ulster Genealogical Review: Number 6, p. 28  Biography  Robert Sutton de Clonard started sailing in 1768, serving on the East Indiamen Laverdy and Duc-de-Praslin. In 1774, as Lap√©rouse defended besieged Mah√© on Seine, Clonard was in command of a one-gun boat, which he used to attack shore positions, sustaining a light wound in the action. On 16 March 1775, Clonard successfully defended a small fort. As Louis XVI awarded him a 300-pound pension for his conduct, he requested that the Order of Saint Louis be granted instead as he was \\"more sensitive to honour than to pecuniary graces\\". Letter of Marque given to Clonard for Comte d'Artois. Promoted to Lieutenant, he served on Glorieux under Captain vicomte d'Escars in the War of American Independence, taking part in the Invasion of Tobago on 30 May 1781. Captured by the British, he was exchanged and given command of the privateer Comte d'Artois, a large East Indiaman converted to a privateer, capturing several British merchantmen but encountering several warships on his second journey. In the action of 13 August 1780, Comte d'Artois encountered , and , which was further away. The British warships had been looking for Comte d'Artois and an engagement ensued in which Sutton was eventually forced to strike his colours. Clonard himself was slightly wounded. Of his crew, 21 men were killed and 35 wounded; Clonard himself was slightly wounded. Bienfaisant had three men killed and 20 wounded.Campbell (1818), Vol. 7, pp.277-8. Charon only joined the action towards the end of the engagement and only had a single man wounded. Two British frigates, Licorne and also came up towards the end of the action and so shared in the prize money with Bienfaisant and Charon. Clonard was released after his capture and on 12 September took command of Diligente on the orders of comte de Grasse. In 1782, Diligente was lost, and Clonard was cited for his \\"prudence (...) courage and (...) strength of character\\". In the nect severn years, he served as first lieutenant in charge of intendance, sailed to Riga to procure wood, and served in India and American in combat operations. By 1785, Clonard had served in eight campaigns, including three as commanding officer. He was tasked with commissioning Boussole for her scientific campaign under Lap√©rouse. From 29 April, Clonard was appointed to Boussole. He initially served as the administrative officer. On 1 January 1787 Clonard was promoted to the rank of capitaine de vaisseau. However, from November 1786 on he had been the recipient of a supplement of 120 livres as a flag captain. On 12 December 1787 Clonard transferred to Astrolabe.Dunmore (1994-5), p.547. Disappearance La Perouse's expedition vanished mysteriously in 1788 after leaving Botany Bay on 10 March 1788. In 1827 Captain Peter Dillon eventually discovered the fate of the expedition when he found remnants of Astrolable and Boussole at Vanikoro Island in the Solomon Islands. The ships had been wrecked in a storm. Survivors from one ship had been massacred while survivors from the other ship had constructed their own small boat and sailed off the island, never to be heard from again.Bateson (1972), p.24.

Following her training at Normal School in Saskatoon, she taught at schools near Canwood, Viscount, and Young but did not get much chance to play sports, except for joining the Saskatoon Pats softball team in 1942. She continued playing in Saskatoon until an All-American League scout noticed her and gave her an opportunity to play in the league. Afterwards, Grambo was sent to Pascagoula, Mississippi for spring training and was assigned to the Grand Rapids Chicks in 1946. She served as a backup for Ruth Lessing and had the chance to catch pitchers such as Connie Wisniewski, Josephine_Kabick, Alice Haylett and Audrey Haine.Madden, W. C.

Unfortunately, her career was cut short when she broke the index finger of her throwing hand early in the season. She returned to Canada and married to Robert Hundeby in 1947 and never returned to the league. The couple established in Elbow, Saskatchewan, where they raised their seven children on the family farm. Their extended family includes 16 grandchildren.

His experiences before and during the war are documented in an almost 4 hour interview with the USC Shoah Foundation. He immigrated to Chicago in 1953, after having lived in a post-war displaced persons camp and for a time in Belgium, where many displaced persons were offered work in coal mines, a program not without controversy. During his life in the United States he was an avid photographer and captured some important moments in the 1960s civil rights era, such as the Chicago Black Easter Parade of April 7, 1969, photographing Jesse Jackson on the \\"Black Sheep\\" float.

The film was the director's first sound film and also the first of the Soviet production company Ukrainfilm. The film's score is considered experimental and avant-garde because of its incorporation of factory, industrial, and other machine sounds; human speech plays only a small role in the film's sounds. Vertov himself described Enthusiasm as \\"the lead icebreaker in the column of sound newsreels.\\" He considered the film's \\"complex interaction of sound with image\\" to be the work's most significant achievement. The director viewed the film as an extended experiment in which the juxtaposition and misalignment of sound were completely intentional. The film is also notable for the fact that it is a documentary filmed on location. Like many of his other films, Vertov worked on Enthusiasm with his wife Elizaveta Svilova. Intention The film was created to promote and celebrate Stalin‚Äôs Five-Year Plan which took place during the years 1928 to 1932. The setting of the film is an important facet of examining Vertov‚Äôs intent as a director, since Ukraine‚Äôs Donbass region was a focal point of the Five-Year Plan. The Donbass was regarded as particularly rich in natural resources‚Äînamely, coal‚Äîwith which the Soviet state could achieve its productive and goals. The Donbass area of Ukraine had already been industrialized since the 1800s, but the Soviets wanted to attain its full industrialization after the Bolshevik Revolution. In his writings, Vertov expounded on the prominent role he envisioned for the natural resources: ‚ÄúCoal comes out of the earth. Coal for factories. Coal for locomotives. Coal for coke furnaces. Coal has arrived. The conveyors and sorting machines have started up. The aerial chains of coal-filled carts have begun to move. The blast furnaces are operating at full speed. Metal has arrived. The rolling and open-hearth, rolled, open-hearth, rolled, open-hearth‚Äîin a single creative thrust toward socialism.‚Äù The film emphasizes the importance of coal in its setting and image content. As mentioned in the film summary, once the setting of the film changes to that of the Donbass region, there are numerous images of coal workers, furnaces, and carts full of coal. Vertov and his film crew purposefully juxtaposed image and sound in Enthusiasm. He attempted to do so by refusing to synchronize the film's images with its score to create a greater effect on the viewers. Presumably due to the complex role Vertov wanted his film's score to undertake, one source describes the movie's sounds as a ‚Äúprotagonist‚Äù in and of itself. ‚ÄúIn 1931, in his Entuziazm (subtitled ‚ÄòSymphony of the Donbass‚Äô) he turned the microphone into protagonist just as earlier, he had made the camera his hero. Not only did he and his team conduct a successful experiment with a mobile microphone, they did not settle for simply synchronizing sound and image, instead taking the line of ‚Äògreatest resistance‚Äô by creating an eloquent counterpoint between the two.‚Äù Summary The film opens with a young woman putting on and adjusting a radio headset. The film then moves between shots of the young woman with the radio to various individuals praying outside of a church in front of as statue of Jesus Christ. An announcement is made on the radio that the Last March is about to be played from Shostakovitch‚Äôs ‚ÄúSymphony of Donbass‚Äù. While the musical piece is playing, there are more shots of various people praying outside of the church; there is a scene of churchgoers coming up to the statue, kneeling and kissing the statue's feet. The film shifts its attention to various groups marching. These scenes are juxtaposed with images of the church. An announcement is made that ‚ÄúThe pope is chained to the church‚Äôs moneybag‚Äù is some of the previous marchers deconstructing a church; revolutionaries remove the church's contents while also dismantling the external signs of its religious nature. There is a scene of what appears to represent a factory and factory production. Images of smiling workers are mixed with images of production. The words ‚ÄúTowards Socialism‚Äù flash across the screen. The setting of the film changes and transitions to a montage of images representing industrialization and mechanization, along with references to the Five-Year Plan. The footage in this portion of the film is clearly from the Donbass. Workers are depicted on their way to work. As time passes after the start of the Five-Year Plan, annual progress is commented upon. The film focuses on the production of coal for the country and for its factories. There are shots of individual workers laboring near large open flames. There are shots of groups of workers laboring together to, presumably, break the coal apart. There is an announcement made which states that the Five-Year Plan, presumably due to workers‚Äô enthusiasm and dedication, was completed in four years. Despite their completion of the Plan, they continue working. Approximately an hour in the film's runtime, various celebrations take place to rejoice the victory of socialism. There are depictions of numerous marches and speeches. Audiences also get a view of how socialism functioned in rural, agricultural areas, as people are shown baling hay, riding tractors, and taking part in their own local celebrations of socialism. Analysis Scholars have identified a few ways to divide and analyze the film. John MacKay, Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatureshttp://slavic.yale.edu/people/john-mackay and a specialist in Soviet cinema studies at Yale, has argued that Enthusiasm can be divided into three sections. The first portion is where the social ills of religion and alcohol are disregarded to prepare for the implementation of socialism. The film transitions to its second portion when the focus is placed on production in the Donbass region. MacKay argues that the third and final portion of the film as when the Donbass's production is sent off to provide for other regions of the U.S.S.R. On the other hand, academics have organized the film into two parts: ‚ÄúIn the first part of the film, before we are hit by the barrage of new sounds of industrialization, Vertov creates a series of disjunctures between the images and sounds of the immobile and decadent pre-socialist society entrenched in the old forms‚Ä¶Eventually the montage shows how the old way has been formally superseded by the industrialized and socialist world‚Ä¶‚Äù. To do so, the director juxtaposed images of the role of religion, the church, and churchgoers‚Äîamong other symbols recognized as vestiges of the past‚Äîwith images of industry, production, and mechanization. Production Most of the film was shot in Ukraine‚Äôs Donbass region. The Donbass, although it was relatively industrialized compared to other regions in the U.S.S.R., presented its own challenges to the film project. Once Vertov and his crew arrived to the Donbass, they did not have much time to record the film score. Upon their arrival to the region, they had about a month to record the location‚Äôs sounds. The lack of time was further compounded by a dearth in available transportation, and as a result, the film crew was forced to lug their equipment: ‚ÄúFaced with the complete absence of means of transport, we walked, dragging, as we went, a twenty-seven-hundred-pound load. Crawling on all fours to the ‚Äòsticks‚Äô.‚Äù Therefore, creating the film was as much a mentally-taxing endeavor as it was a physical one. Starting in 1929, Vertov began recording the film‚Äôs visual footage before he formulated the film score. Vertov‚Äôs sound production and the sounds used in the film are both essential to understanding the significance and context of Enthusiasm has in Soviet cinema and cinematic history. The film served as a platform on which Vertov could experiment with sound and filming on location. He wanted to refute long-standing, preconceived notions of the way sounds were thought to be used in cinema. Some of the assumptions Vertov worked against included the idea that movie directors should only include sounds produced in a studio or that cinematic sound could only be of the artificial variety. The Donbass Symphony, in contrast, was an experiment in using mobile sound equipment while outside and filming on location. Release and Reception Just before the film‚Äô release the director wrote: ‚ÄúThe shooting of Enthusiasm was completed more than half a year ago. Released by the factory for the 1930 October celebrations, it‚Äôs still not been released to the public. It awaits a serious appraisal of its merits and shortcomings. It awaits a strict, but not irrelevant evaluation. Not an evaluation in general terms (outside of time and space), but one based on sound cinema‚Äôs present state of development.‚Äù The movie was released on April 2, 1931. Audiences were confused by the work and there were not many positive reviews‚Äîtherefore, Enthusiasm did not fare well in theaters and was quickly taken out of circulation. \\"[Enthusiasm] was rediscovered only in the 1960s due to renewed interest to the Soviet avant-garde in the West. Enthusiasm was restored by the National Dovzhenko Film Studios on request of the State Film Agency of Ukraine in 2011.‚Äù Criticism Vertov has been critical of Enthusiasm in his own writings. He has written that the project's goals were incredibly ambitious and most likely beyond the technological capabilities‚Äîin the realm of sound production and film footage‚Äîof his time. Vertov's lack of satisfaction with the film's finished product may explain why he viewed Enthusiasm as neither an incomplete nor ‚Äúentirely realized‚Äù film. The director also received criticism for the ‚Äúinhuman noises,‚Äù he used as the film's score. Vertov wrote in response to the criticism his film received upon its release. On page 114 of Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov, the director expressed his frustration with those critics who wanted to critique the film's sound or the film's footage individually and separately from each other. Instead, he believed that critics should view both the film's sound and images and the way they worked together. In the same section of his writing, he urged for a holistic, contextualized critique of the film: ‚ÄúThose who worked on Enthusiasm and, I think, all those in newsreel film, are interested in a many-sided (and not a one-sided) analysis of this film.‚Äù To Vertov, the role and place of his film in the course of cinema, Soviet cinema, and documentary film were all necessary components of critically appraising Enthusiasm's success and significance. On an abstract, theoretical level, criticism has been levelled against the film because of a supposed lack of conflict. In John McKay's \\"Disorganized Noise: Enthusiasm and the Ear of the Collective\\", he notes that Enthusiasm‚Äîalong with another Vertov film, One Sixth of the World‚Äîwas accused of presenting a sort of utopian world in which socialism was established and functioned without any apparent conflict. Vertov‚Äôs decision to present a society in which socialism had triumphed and create a movie without conflict‚Äîwithout a struggle to mirror the challenges in the real-world realization of socialism‚Äîgained him his share of critics. For this reason, some Bolshevik party members were skeptical as to whether the film truly represented the party and its ideology and history. Further reading *Annette Michelson ed.

Back in the States after the war, he started his studies at the New Mexico Highlands University. Later on he moved back East, and obtained his AB in 1952 at the Upsala College. Next at The New School he had participated in the Asch conformity experiments, and in 1955 obtained his MA in Experimental Psychology. In 1956 he obtained his M.B.A. at the New York University, where in 1961 he also obtained his Ph.D. under John Glover.

Wrege wrote his PhD thesis at the New York University about the Hawthorne studies conducted by Elton Mayo and others in the 1920s and 1930s at the Hawthorne Works in Cicero, Illinois. Wrege published his findings in 1961 and his work was republished in 1986 by Garland publisher in New York. Wrege conducted a historical study of the Hawthorne illumination tests, one of the earliest studies at the Hawthorne works that studied the effect of light levels on worker productivity. Wrege looked at the origins, procedures, and results of these early studies and their influence upon the later Hawthorne studies.Wrege (1986, p. iii) In his later years Wrege supplied Steven D.

History  The original fortification was built during the reign of Justinian I, the emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, in the 6th century. The town flourished under administration of Princess Milica of Serbia. Its nickname however implicates that the latest fortification was built under the overwatch of Eirene Kantakouzene, the wife of ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, infamous in the folk for putting maximum work load onto the peasantry for building very demanding fortifications on steep mountain tops. There are several medieval towns in Serbia that are nicknamed as Eirene's Town.  Characteristics  Not much is known about Grabovac, however the latest findings imply that the fortified town was three times bigger than Koznik, and two times bigger than Magliƒç. It is estimated to include the surface of 1 hectare, and the fortification itself is located on the altitude of 300 meters. The fortification is accessible via a foot trail next to the Grahovac-Lozna road. Around 350 meters remain preserved, among which the tallest part is 8 meters tall and 2 meters thick.

She is the Section Chief of Vascular Biology and Hypertension and the Director of the Vascular Biology and Hypertension Program of the Division of Cardiovascular Disease at the University of Alabama-Birmingham (UAB) Medical School. Oparil earned an A.B. in Zoology from Cornell University in 1961 and continued on to earn her medical degree in 1965, graduating in the top of her class from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. After receiving further training at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital and completing her residency and cardiology fellowship at Massachusetts General Hospital, Dr. Oparil obtained her first faculty position at the University of Chicago in 1971. In 1975, she was promoted to Associate Professor before leaving the University of Chicago in 1977. It was in 1977 that Dr. Oparil began her work at the University of Alabama-Birmingham as an Associate Professor until her promotion to Professor in 1981. Early life Suzanne Oparil was raised on a dairy farm in Elmira, New York in the 1940s as the daughter of Czech immigrants. It was there, early in life, that she developed an appreciation of nature and a respect for its uncontrollable elements. She says ‚ÄúI was always interested in science and thought about pursuing a career in bench research like Madame Curie.‚Äù She credited her brother with inspiring her to become a doctor, telling her that she could still ‚Äúdo research and make a lot more money that way.‚Äù She attended Cornell University as a National Merit Scholar, then went to Columbia University for medical school. She graduated first in her class from Columbia at a time when men outnumbered women in the program 9 to 1. She says she entered the field of cardiology because the late 1960s were a ‚Äúgolden age of new things in cardiology‚Äù and because her father died from congestive heart failure related to ischemic heart disease. Research Oparil‚Äôs pioneering research and work with hypertension began during her time at Massachusetts General Hospital. As a postdoctoral fellow, she found that most of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II is produced in the lungs. In most organs, angiotensin II is degraded as it is generated from angiotensin I via Angiotensin Converting Enzyme, preventing much from contributing to the total amount of active angiotensin in the body. In the lungs, the angiotensin II is not degraded, so its vasoconstrictive effects are felt in the body and can lead to hypertension. Her work led to the use of ACE inhibitors in hypertension treatment to keep angiotensin in its inactive state, angiotensin I. Dr. Oparil‚Äôs work with angiotensin and ACE inhibitors proved to be foundational to hypertension research. Oparil continues to research novel approaches to treat hypertension as well as organ damage related to treatments. She also investigates hormonal modulation of inflammatory responses to vascular injury and mechanisms of estrogen-mediated vasoprotection. Since beginning her research in the 1970s, Oparil has authored or co-authored over 775 peer-reviewed articles in various aspects of cardiological diseases and medicine. Leadership in science and medicine She served as the President of the American Heart Association, the American Society of Hypertension, and the American Federation for Medical Research. She has served on various National Institutes of Health (NIH) task forces, panels, and committees, including: the Panel on Scientific Boundaries for Review, NIH Center for Scientific Review, and the Special Emphasis Panel of the NIH Loan Repayment Program. She has been a member of several writing committees in hypertension research, as well as co-chair of the Joint National Committee responsible for developing guidelines for prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of hypertension in the United States. Her work to progress the field of cardiovascular medicine has earned her the American Heart Association‚Äôs Council for High Blood Pressure Irving Page-Alva Bradley Lifetime Achievement Award, the Virginia Franz ‚Äô22 Award for Distinguished Women in Medicine, by the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, and the Dr. John Foerster Distinguished Lecture Award for Lifetime Achievements in the Field of Cardiovascular Medicine from the Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences. Tobacco industry controversy In his book Golden Holocaust: Origins of the Cigarette Catastrophe and the Case for Abolition, Robert Proctor included Suzanne Oparil as an example of a paid witness for the tobacco industry in the years following the dissolution of the Council for Tobacco Research (CTR). He states that she received about $500,000 in funding from the CTR between 1989 and 1995. Later she testified in several suits on behalf of the CTR, crediting it as a ‚Äúlegitimate, valuable scientific research organization‚Äù citing its ‚Äúcutting edge‚Äù work. In her testimony, Oparil would not state that smoking causes cancer or that it is addictive.

Gurpreet Dhuri is known for his clay modeling and portraiture in medium of sculpture. Gurpreet Singh Dhuri loves to be called Gurpreet Dhuri and alumni of Government College of Arts, Chandigarh. His upbringing in a working-class family has taught him to be tough and work passionately to rise. But unlike many who shared similar socio economic background, he has not given up to destiny. He is a contemporary sculptor and prosthetics artist who has worked in Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi and Mumbai. Completed his Graduation and masters of Fine art BFA and MFA from Government College of Arts Chandigarh. He has worked as artist at dirty Hands studio for a period of five years where he was trained in prosthetics. He is founder member of Studio hash, Delhi among other fellow artist Rakesh Kumar, Harpreet Singh, Akash Gaur. Recently they have done a full figure Silicon Sculpture of Shri Nek Chand maker of Rock Garden of Chandigarh. __FORCETOC__  Early life and background Born on 26 December 1983, to mother Joginder Kaur and father Labh Singh, he is the youngest among his four siblings. Father tried to carry forward the traditional shoe making, his ancestral occupation in the small village Ghanaur for many years. But, with the advent of the new technology and new trends in shoe industry, his occupation was subject to constant economic pressures. He somehow delayed his surrender to the time when, Gurpreet dhuri was of 24 (age). The father finally gave up and took on to his bicycle and tiffin box to join the contingent of laborers working in the Sugar mill at Dhuri. This shift somehow ensured the continuity of studies of his children as the fixed salary of the sugar mill started flowing in. The meager income of the father was not in a capacity to provide a carefree childhood to Gurpreet, he had to think of taking of a few hours of work to be of some help to his family. His passion for colours and painting drove him to work with Rinku Painter as an assistant. Here he had his first stint with the paints. Though, the job may not be considered as some higher form of art in the modern sense, but it was how the common men needed art in their lives. Dhuri learned, the techniques to handle Poster and enamel paints over clothes, walls and metal sheets etc. ‚ÄúBy the time I passed my matriculation, I had already realized that I have a special attraction towards art pieces, though I was not aware of the dimensions and scope of this area as a sphere of human activity.\\" Gurpreet Dhuri informs. The knowledge of art as a field of academic came with small and sudden incident. \\"One day my elder brother Gurmeet came to me with a piece of newspaper cutting in his hand, and showed it to me saying that it may interest me. Unable to make out any much sense out of it, I took it to my primary teacher, who explained that it is an advertisement for admission to college of art. I immediately knew that it was my destiny.\\" Remembers Gurpreet, who still maintains that newspaper cutting in his scraps along with his important documents. This incident gave him a near target in life and he now had a purpose in everything which he was, though, already doing. After passing 10 plus 2 in the year 2000 he still had to look for work. He found work with Rinku painter dhuri and recalls writing banners for advertisements and political parties during election days. This job had another mile to go along with him. Education He joined graduation in a nearby college in the year 2001, which he left in the year 2002 when he cleared the entrance test for the government College of Arts in July 2003. The art college was a new world but he could not afford to submerse himself into it fully due to the economic constraints. He took a bus every Friday to travel 128 km to his home town Dhuri so that he can utilize the weekend to earn by painting banners. As he progressed in his studies, many recognized the sculptor within him and he started getting some commercial work in the college sphere itself by the third year of education. ‚ÄúI met many kind people, who were always ready to help, promote and encourage me. Most notably Mr. Rahi Mohinder Singh, painter and Sant Singh Dhuri, Rinku Painter Dhuri & Jagdeep Jolly\\" . Dhuri further joined MFA after graduating in the year 2006 and completed the masters in 2009. Awards and honors * In 2008 Gurpreet Dhuri received Rabindranath Tagore Scholarship sponsored by late Mrs. Amita Mundra from Lalit Kala Akademi Chandigarh * 2008‚ÄòIndo-Swiss Friendship‚Äô Art Exhibition, Government Museum and Art Gallery, Chandigarh. Career By the time he completed MFA, he had realized the length and breadth of the big field of sculpture and art he was about to plunge into. He was not very keen to find a job and look for a quick settlement in the most mundane sense, instead, he set out to explore. He started experimenting with new materials like silicone and proceeded towards good results which invited attention of many.

After his father's death in 1971, his mother married Dr. Andr√© Fr√©d√©ric Cournand], a physician who was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1956. Career After graduating from Harvard, Berle joined the United States Air Force where he trained as a parachutist and intelligence officer. After being honorably discharged with the rank of first lieutenant, he returned to Cambridge for law school. After graduating from law school, he joined the prestigious law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind and Garrison, where he was assigned to case litigating against Consolidated Edison.

Berle, who was known as \\"fiercely independent,\\" was forced to resign on December 12, 1978 after several disagreements with Gov. Carey. He was succeeded by Robert F. Flacke, who was previously the chairman of the Adirondack Park Agency. =National Audubon Society= From 1985 to 1995, he served as President of the National Audubon Society, succeeding Russell W. Peterson, the former Governor of Delaware. Concurrently, he was the president of the Stockbridge Land Trust, director of the Orion Society and a trustee and former chairman of the Century Foundation. As president, he worked to prevent oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as well as arguing before the Supreme Court in support of responsible handling of water issues in the Midwest. =Joint Public Advisory Committee= In 1993, he was one of the five U.S. members appointed by President William J. Clinton to the Joint Public Advisory Committee, a constituent piece of the Commission on Environmental Cooperation under the North American Free Trade Agreement, serving until 2002. Personal life In 1960, Berle married Lila Sloane Wilde in Lenox, Massachusetts. She was the daughter of Helm George Wilde (1907‚Äì1998) and Marjorie Lila Field (1910‚Äì1997), herself a granddaughter of Emily Vanderbilt Sloane (1874‚Äì1970). Lila's maternal uncle was Frederick Vanderbilt Field (1905‚Äì2000). Peter and Lila were the parents of: * Dolf A.

Based in England, the channel started in 2012. Their channel includes fan interviews, previews and reviews of Arsenal players. They have interviewed past and current players including Olivier Giroud, Ian Wright and Thierry Henry. History The channel was created on YouTube in October 2012, and was founded by former BBC reggae radio host Robbie Lyle. Lyle had worked as a surveyor before quitting his job to work on ArsenalFanTV full-time. He created the channel with his cameraman 'Tao' who had also quit his job to pursue a career on YouTube. ArsenalFanTV film their interviews outside the Emirates Stadium after Arsenal's home games Their first fan interviews were after Arsenal's 5‚Äì2 win against local rivals Tottenham Hotspur. When asked by Vice on why he created the channel Lyle said \\"we've all had enough of the so-called pundits, most of whom aren't even at the games. So I started my own channel to hear from the real fans, with real opinions. That was my aim with the site\\". ArsenalFanTV pioneered the concept of supporters led TV or \\"Fan TV\\" which has led to other club supporters creating similar channels on YouTube. Since its creation, the channel has continued to provide viewers with fan interviews and content about Arsenal on social media. But its rise in the YouTube community occurred as a result of many viral videos it has posted from fan interviews. The channel has posted interviews of many angry rants from Arsenal supporters directed at the club's ownership. Many of these fan interviews include Chris Hudson's rant after the loss to Aston Villa in 2013 and Troopz in 2017 following Arsenal's 5‚Äì1 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League. The rise of the channel has been helped by viral videos it has posted from fan interviews, with fans venting their frustration at the club following defeats. Much of the anger from supporters on the channel was directed towards former manager Ars√®ne Wenger, who many believed should have resigned following his long tenure at the London-based club, especially during the 2016‚Äì17 season where there was a divide among Arsenal fans, with a minority being 'Wenger In' and a majority being 'Wenger Out' There has also been criticism towards major shareholder Stan Kroenke who many Arsenal fans believe he should sell his shares to the next major shareholder Alisher Usmanov, following claims of his lack of desire towards the club, and comments made by Kroenke himself stating that he \\"didn't buy Arsenal stakes to win trophies\\". This was referenced on BT Sport by the former England international Rio Ferdinand when he mentioned the frustration of Arsenal supporters with Wenger on ArsenalFanTV in 2016. On 20 April 2018, Channel 4 premiered a new late-night football show called The Real Football Fan Show hosted by Lyle and featuring many AFTV regulars. In March 2020, Lyle was also the subject of an ITV documentary Robbie Lyle: Football Fans Under Their Skin in which he discusses racism within football and the experiences of black football supporters. Notable contributors From left to right (foreground): Ty, Claude and Robbie in 2017 Although the channel interviews a variety of Arsenal supporters after every game, there are a few supporters who are regularly interviewed by Robbie Lyle and are well known by many of the channel's viewers. = Current = * *\\"Ty\\" (Taiwo Ogunlabi): Seen as very optimistic and is well known for his support of Ars√®ne Wenger. Ty constantly defended Wenger during his tenure as manager despite facing growing opposition from supporters. *\\"DT\\" (Liam Goodenough): A vocal critic of Wenger, DT is also known for his angry rants whenever Arsenal lose and has been responsible for putting many 'Wenger Out' banners at Arsenal matches. He has his own channel with over 203,000 subscribers. *Kelechi Anyikude: Originally from Nigeria, Kelechi is well known for singing at the start of his interviews. *Lee Judges: A lifelong Arsenal supporter, Lee has given several passionate rants about the demise of Arsenal under Wenger. = Former = * Claude Callegari: An outspoken critic of Ars√®ne Wenger. He is famous for his saying \\"it's time to go\\" with regard to Ars√®ne Wenger. In July 2020, he was removed as a contributor after making a racist remark about Tottenham Hotspur F.C. player Heung-Min Son during a live stream. * ‚ÄúTroopz‚Äù: Another vocal critic of Wenger, Troopz is known for his use of multicultural London English words such as 'blud' and 'fam'. In September 2020, he left AFTV to join Barstool Sports. However, he still appears in post match interview with AFTV despite his announcement. Controversies = 2017 = The channel has received many criticisms. Lawrence Tallis, the creative director of Big Balls Films (which launched Copa90), questioned whether many viewers were watching the channel for analysis of Arsenal or for the entertainment. Similarly, former Manchester United player and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville criticised Arsenal fans who appeared on the channel for being too harsh on Wenger. \\"I was watching Arsenal fans slating and slanging into him, and I thought, 'he doesn't deserve that'\\". ArsenalFanTV later extended an invitation for Neville to discuss his comments on the channel, which he accepted. After Arsenal's 2‚Äì2 draw against Manchester City in April 2017, many Arsenal supporters attempted to attack Robbie as well as other regulars such as Claude. There had been tensions between pro-Wenger and anti-Wenger supporters in the stadium which led to fights during the game between Arsenal fans. One man shouted \\"ArsenalFanTV won't be happening today\\", indicating that although it was unclear why the attacks happen, many fans were unhappy with the content the channel had been producing. In a video days later, Lyle addressed the issue and stated that he spoke to the fans who tried to attack and they had apologised. That same month, AFTV came under criticism for a video they posted in association with The Sun newspaper. The video, which featured Lyle, DT and Ty, received backlash from many football fans, especially Liverpool supporters, who have boycotted The Sun due to its controversial reporting of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster which killed 96 Liverpool fans, which included allegations of Liverpool fans urinating on police officers and pickpocketing dying supporters. Liverpool had recently banned the newspaper from attending press conferences and Everton followed, following an article posted about Ross Barkley, which they had compared him to a gorilla which was considered offensive due to his grandfather's Nigerian heritage. In response to the criticism, Lyle appeared on the Ball Street YouTube channel and apologised to the people of Liverpool for offence that was taken, and has promised to not work with the tabloid in the future, and the video has since been deleted from the channel. Following Arsenal's 2‚Äì0 defeat to Tottenham in April 2017, Lyle was escorted out of White Hart Lane with police protection after being abused by many Tottenham fans, and was unable to film ArsenalFanTV after that match. In a video afterwards, Lyle stated that much of the abuse he received was racist and was not something he experienced for years. Tottenham Hotspur condemned any racial abuse and was working with the Metropolitan Police on the issue. = 2018 = In February 2018, at a scheduled talk at Oxford Union, Arsenal defender H√©ctor Beller√≠n criticised the channel stating that it's wrong for people to consider themselves to be fans while having their success built off of the team's failures, as well as claiming that some fans were 'hustling' in order to make money from the channel. This prompted Lyle to respond in defense retorting that ArsenalFan TV exists not as a way to profit off of failure but as a platform for any and all fans of the club to freely voice their opinions, support or even frustrations towards their club without feeling that their opinion is less important. In August 2018, ArsenalFanTV were forced to change their name to AFTV following discussions with Arsenal regarding the channel breaching Arsenal's copyright by using the term \\"Arsenal\\" without authorisation which had a negative effect on the club. Some media outlets claimed Arsenal had issued a cease and desist letter against ArsenalFanTV, however they confirmed this was not true. = 2020 = In July 2020, contributor Claude Callegari made a racial slur about South Korean Tottenham Hotspur F.C. player Heung-Min Son during a live stream, referring to him as a DVD. This has been considered a racial slur since at least 2005, referencing the large number of Asian people who sell DVDs around the East London area. After making an video on the platform alongside Lyle, where the issue was discussed but no apology given. Channel sponsor Harry's issued a statement that they would no longer be working with AFTV. Following this, AFTV announced that Callegari would be removed from the channel \\"indefinitely\\". During the same live steam, contributor Troopz made a comment ‚ÄúHarry Kane is white so he must be right‚Äù. No action has been taken against Troopz. In August 2020, AFTV were criticised during a live stream watching the 2020 FA Cup Final, after some fans celebrated when Chelsea F.C. player Christian Pulisic was injured and had to be taken off. Influence The success of AFTV led to fans of other clubs setting up similar channels such as Full Time Devils (Manchester United F.C.) and The Redmen TV (Liverpool F.C.).

During her student years, she was active in both the civil rights movement and feminist causes. Since then she has had a career involving feminism, community organization, and progressive politics. Early life and family Booth's father, Jerome Sanford Tobis (1916‚Äì2012), was a physician who specialized in physical therapy and cardiac rehabilitation. Her mother, Hazel Victoria Weisbard Tobis (1918‚Äì2002), was a stay at home mother during the childhood of Booth and her two brothers. Booth was born in a military hospital in Brookhaven, Mississippi, on December 15, 1945, during a period in which her father was serving as an Army doctor. Soon after her birth, her family moved to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, where she received her elementary education in P.S. 200 in the Bath Beach neighborhood. Later, she attended high school in Long Island's North Shore after her family had moved to that upscale area. She has two brothers, David and Jonathan. Booth grew up in a warm, loving, and supportive family. Her parents taught her the importance of recognizing injustice and acting to correct it. They were observant Jews, belonging to a liberal synagogue, who showed by example the importance of treating others with decency and respect. From her Jewish upbringing, Booth learned to take on responsibility for building a society that reflected these goals. After her family had moved to Long Island, Booth's mother, using Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique, made her aware of the growing discontent of prosperous suburban housewives with the conventionally narrow lives they led. In high school, Booth joined a sorority and the cheerleading team but left both of them when she came to believe that their members were discriminating against students who did not lead their privileged lives. She began leafleting against the death penalty. In 1960, she joined CORE in a protest against the segregationist policies of the Woolworth's chain. Upon graduating from high school in 1963, she spent the summer traveling in Israel and that fall enrolled as a freshman at the University of Chicago. She chose that school in part because it had no sororities and deemphasized sports. In college, she quickly immersed herself in political activism. In 1967, she received a Bachelor of Arts degree in social sciences, then in 1970, a Master of Arts degree in educational psychology, both from the University of Chicago. She and Paul Booth married in July 1967, shortly after she graduated from college. They had met at a sit-in protesting the University of Chicago's cooperation with the policies of the U.S. Selective Service System whose local boards were then drafting men to serve in the Vietnam War. The couple had two sons, Gene and Dan, born within a few years of their marriage. One of the founders of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Paul Booth was national secretary of the organization when they met. He helped organize the 1965 March on Washington for Peace in Vietnam, subsequently became president of the Citizen Action Program in Chicago (a group formed in 1969 by members of Alinsky's Industrial Areas Foundation), and was later a director of the Midwest Academy. Beginning in the 1980s, he held a series of positions within the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union. In 2017, by then executive assistant to the union's president, he retired, continuing his political engagement by supporting Heather Booth in her work. He died January 17, 2018, from complications of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Career =Civil rights= Booth's opposition to racial discrimination began when she was still in elementary school. She defended an African-American fellow student who was being attacked for allegedly stealing another student's lunch money. Years later, she learned that the girl who made the accusation had put the money in her shoe and forgotten it. In a 1985 interview, Booth said \\"I remember having the feeling that you don't do this to people.\\" While in high school, she joined the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) to help protest Woolworth's lunch counter discrimination in the South. In 1963, soon after enrolling in college, she joined the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and, as head of the campus Friends of SNCC group, was student liaison to another coordinating committee, the Chicago Council of Community Organizations (CCCO), that was protesting school segregation in the city. In that role she helped coordinate freedom schools in the Chicago's South Side. A few months later she was recruited to participate in Freedom Summer, in which volunteers from Northern and Western colleges and universities worked to register black voters and set up freedom schools and libraries. In an interview conducted in 1989, she said that the experience reinforced her commitment to the civil rights movement. Confronted by the violent resistance of white Mississippians, she feared for her own life, but also realized that she could leave whenever she wished and was awed by the extraordinary heroism of the black residents with whom she worked. \\"They had a quiet heroism,\\" she said, \\"not just by standing up to bullets, but by day to day being willing to go and talk to their neighbors, have meetings in their churches, take people into their homes.\\" She said the work was frightening, but also full of tiring and frustrating tasks, and recognized that it is the mundane everyday work that brings meaningful change. In 1965, Booth was arrested for the first time while demonstrating at banks that were providing financial support for the apartheid regime in South Africa. Shortly afterward, she helped form a number of local groups that sought to learn about urban problems and find ways to overcome them. She left SNCC about 1968, when its leaders no longer welcomed whites as members. She then devoted more of her time to issues related to feminism and the anti-war movement. =Feminism= Soon after she arrived on campus, Booth ran up against the university's bias in favor of its male students. In 1965, she began to set up consciousness raising groups to deal with the problem. These small groups of women met regularly to speak about incidents, both minor and more serious, that seemed to be private but often proved to be shared. In a pamphlet published in April 1968, Booth and two co- writers noted a tendency for women to \\"see their problems as personal ones and thus blame themselves.\\" In discovering how many ostensibly unique concerns were actually common ones, members gained a sense of the collective influence they might exert toward changing the unfair practices and dismissive attitudes they had previously accepted as cultural norms. She also helped to organize a course on women's studies, began to coach women who were uneasy about speaking up in class, and conducted a study on the disparity of treatment between male and female students in the classroom. Noticing a similar unequal treatment among student activists, she founded a campus group, the Women's Radical Action Program, to document and counter the ways in which women were relegated to subordinate roles in national organizations such as Students for a Democratic Society and SNCC. In 1965, a fellow student asked whether Booth could help his sister who was so greatly distraught about an unwanted pregnancy as to consider killing herself. By contacting the medical arm of the civil rights movement, she was able to refer the woman to a reputable doctor who was willing to perform an abortion. As word quietly spread throughout the university community she was asked to make more referrals to the same doctor. In complying, she made sure that he would not only treat them, but also make sure the patients made a successful recovery. The Jane Collective, or simply Jane, emerged from this early start. Booth formed it by involving like-minded students in a clandestine organization for evaluating doctors, counseling women who contacted them, performing referrals, and conducting follow-up discussions by phone. By 1969 this group, calling itself the Abortion Counseling Service of Women's Liberation, began to advertise in student and underground newspapers, advising pregnant women who needed help to \\"Call Jane.\\" The Jane Collective disbanded following the Roe v. Wade decision of the U.S. Supreme Court on January 22, 1973, which effectively legalized abortion throughout the country. In 1969, recognizing the need to counter a strong tendency among feminists to see all organizational structures as oppressive, Booth joined with five other women to found the Chicago Women's Liberation Union (CWLU). They believed that organization was essential for the movement be able to reach out to women who were not already radicalized and for it to develop strategies for winning reforms that would demonstrably improve women's lives. They said a structured approach was needed, including careful planning, the setting of specific goals, and developing strategies achieve these goals. Overall, they were committed to helping women to gain a sense of their collective power. The CWLU organized local chapters, published newspapers, engaged in direct action, and ran a liberation school founded by CWLU's first staff member, Vivian Rothstein.\\"The Liberation School for Women, a Project of the Chicago Women's Liberation Union.\\" Vivian Rothstein. Revolutionary Moment conference, 2014. Accessed April 09, 2020. Booth married in 1967, then with the birth of two sons (in 1968 and 1970), she began to experience family- related issues that most feminist activists had considered to have little or no importance. Finding no local child care centers in the Hyde Park community where she lived, she joined with two friends in an effort to set one up. The bureaucratic obstruction that they encountered led the three to set up a new citywide organization in Chicago called the Action Committee for Decent Childcare (ACDC). Based on the rationale given for setting up the CWLU, to which it was related, ACDC created an organizational structure having specific and achievable goals. A position paper written anonymously in 1972 stated these goals as building a power base of women who work together to accomplish specific reforms in childcare policy, with the expectation that each victory will provide an opportunity to expand the power base and bring further goals within reach. The committee did not set up childcare services but worked to overcome legal barriers to the substantial expansion of these services throughout the city. Within a few years it had forced the liberalization of licensing procedures and won a million dollar city investment in childcare centers. In 1972, \\"Socialist Feminism: A Strategy for the Women's Movement\\", which is believed to be the first publication to use the term \\"socialist feminism\\", was published; it was by the Hyde Park Chapter of the CWLU which included Booth, Day Creamer, Susan Davis, Deb Dobbin, Robin Kaufman, and Tobey Klass. =Community organizing= After earning her master's degree in 1970, Booth took on part-time editorial work to help support her family. Outraged at her employer's treatment of its clerical staff, she encouraged them to organize. When they confronted him, the boss agreed to meet their demands but insisted on firing Booth. She sued and in 1972 won her case before the National Labor Relations Board. The next year, using money she was awarded in the suit, she founded the Midwest Academy, a training organization that taught grassroots community organizing methods based on earlier work done by Saul Alinsky. Booth and the other leaders of the Academy created a highly regarded tool for the use of the community organizers who came to them for training. Using the tool, Academy instructors taught the importance of establishing organizations to set specific goals for using pressure-group tactics in a formally-structured campaign. This tool, the \\"Midwest Academy Strategy Chart,\\" instructed students in the actions that must be taken following the articulation of a problem and the methods that must be used for determining the success of the resulting campaign. The steps include setting concrete near- and long-term objectives, identifying individuals or groups that are either committed to solving the problem or likely to become supportive allies, and they include measuring the strength and likely tactics of those who will oppose the change. The chart directs attention to targets‚Äîthe specific individuals who hold decision-making power and are able to affect the campaign‚Äîand it asks how these people can be influenced. It focuses on the resources that the campaign can call upon: its budget, its staff, and facilities available to it. And it asks how the campaign can be used to strengthen the coordinating group, what experience its leaders will gain as they conduct it, and whether it offers a good chance to expand into new constituencies and raise additional money. In 1978, Booth was the founding executive director of an alliance of citizen activist and labor organizations called the Citizen-Labor Energy Coalition that worked to reform national energy policy during a time of rapidly increasing costs. The experience she gained as president of the Midwest Academy and the many contacts she made with people who attended its training programs enabled her to set up a nationwide coalition of local activist groups in 1980. This organization, called Citizen Action, also proved to be successful and by 1989 had a membership of two million people with 24 state affiliates. The issues it took on included plant closings, affordable health care, high energy costs, toxic waste sites, and similar problems, most of them having a degree of bipartisan support. Largely influenced by the negative fallout following the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan, Citizen Action began to move away from the nonpartisan activism of the other organizations that Booth had founded. Departing from her previous practice, she began to make alliances with labor organizations and take first steps toward entering mainstream politics by helping to defeat Republican candidates for office. =Progressive politics= She was an adviser to Harold Washington's 1983 and 1987 mayoral campaigns in Chicago and subsequently served as field director for Carol Moseley-Braun's successful campaign for the Senate in 1992. Because the headquarters of Citizen Action was in Washington, D.C., her position as its president caused her to make frequent trips there from her home in Chicago. In Washington she was able to make a growing number of connections with the national leadership of the AFL-CIO and the Democratic Party. In 1993, she became outreach coordinator for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and coordinator of its National Health Care Campaign. The DNC made her its training director in 1996. Four years later, Julian Bond asked her to lead an NAACP voter registration effort that helped produce the unusually large African-American turnout in the presidential election of 2000. Late in 1999, Booth helped found a new federation of progressive community organizing groups called USAction, which named her its vice president for external affairs. USAction absorbed some of the member organizations of Citizen Action and, like Citizen Action, it is a progressive advocacy organization that stimulates and coordinates community pressure groups. Booth also began working as a political consultant. Having previously worked with the National Organization for Women (NOW) during efforts to obtain passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, she directed field outreach for the pro-choice rallies that were connected to the 2004 March for Women's Lives which NOW helped organize. In 2003, she was lead consultant to the Campaign for Comprehensive Immigration Reform and subsequently to the Voter Participation Center. She was also the senior advisor to the One Nation Working Together rally held in October 2010 and consultant to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare a year later. Since 2011, she has been a member of an organization of political consultants called Democracy Partners. In 2004, Booth was Get-Out-the-Vote (GOTV) coordinator for the New Mexico Kerry/Edwards presidential campaign. In 2008, she was director of the AFL-CIO Health Care Campaign. In 2009, she directed the campaign to promote congressional passage of President Obama's first budget. Booth worked to achieve financial reform and establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In 2010, she was hired to direct Americans for Financial Reform (AFR), a coalition of about 200 consumer, labor, and special interest groups established in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 and the subsequent Great Recession. AFR played a key role in achieving passage of the Dodd-Frank Act later that year. As Elizabeth Warren later explained: > AFR managed to scrape together some money, and they used it to hire a > handful of employees, including Heather Booth as executive director and Lisa > Donner as her deputy. Creating a small team to organize the overall campaign > for reform was a brilliant move. Instead of each nonprofit putting a little > time into fighting for this or that provision, AFR coordinated the efforts > of dozens of groups, magnifying the work of each one by helping them speak > with a single voice. Heather and Lisa and the rest of their crew put out > press releases, coordinated briefings on Capitol Hill, and organized groups > of volunteers. The staffers and lobbyist and lawyers for the megabanks > outnumbered them by a zillion to one, but the AFR people were there‚Äîday in > and day out‚Äîhammering on the need for financial reform. They worked their > hearts out. Regarding passage of the Dodd-Frank Act Booth, she was jubilant but did not see the achievement as an end in itself. She wrote: > The big lesson is that if we organize, we can win. The progress we made was > because people raised our voices, took the message to the public, to the > streets, and to the Halls of Congress, where we were joined in our efforts > by some committed elected representatives.... [T]he legislation headed to > the President‚Äôs desk is a better start than almost anyone predicted was > possible in the face of the powerful opposition and entrenched power of the > status quo. We won. Now let's get back to work. Calling her \\"one of the nation's most influential organizers for progressive causes,\\" a profile published in 2017 by journalist David Wood said: > Inside almost every liberal drive over the past five decades ‚Äï for fair pay, > equal justice, abortion rights, workers' rights, voter rights, civil rights, > immigration rights, child care ‚Äï you will find Booth.

Political opponents and critics As an activist on the national scene, Booth has drawn considerable criticism from political opponents. In 1978, Congressman Larry McDonald (R. Ga.) claimed that Booth and the Midwest Academy were associated with the Communist Party USA. A year later, he quoted an article claiming that: \\"The founder of the Midwest Academy, Heather Tobis Booth, and her husband, Paul Booth, were top leaders of Students for a Democratic Society in the mid-1960s who decided like many other S.D.S. activists that the way to create a socialist system in the United States was to organize a 'hate the rich' campaign under cover of a 'populist' movement for those who have incomes near or below the poverty line.\\" In a book published in 2010, conservative author Stanley Kurtz called Booth \\"arguably the queen of socialist politics in Chicago,\\" also saying she was determined \\"to drag modern American socialism, kicking and screaming, into the heart of America's mainstream institutions.\\" Conservative website Discover the Networks said of Booth that, \\"notwithstanding her commitment to incrementalism\\", she advocated a \\"revolutionary showdown\\" toward the achievement of socialism. In 2013, Paul Sperry said she was a leading figure among the \\"socialist activists and their front groups [who] played a shockingly outsized role shaping and passing the monumental financial reform legislation that authorized the creation of President Obama's powerful consumer credit watchdog agency.\\" Honors and awards * On May 9, 1987, Booth received the Thomas-Debs Award at a dinner in her honor held by the Democratic Socialists of America. * On June 16, 2009, the Washington, D.C., office of AVODAH held a \\"Partner in Justice Event\\" honoring Booth. * On July 6, 2013, during the national conference of the National Organization for Women, Booth accepted the Victoria J.

Civil War ‚Äì Three months' service  In response to President Abraham Lincoln's April 1861 call for 75,000 troops to defend Washington, D.C., following the fall of Fort Sumter to Confederate forces, Alexander enrolled for military service in Reading at the age of 31. Commissioned a captain, he mustered in for duty with Company G of the 1st Pennsylvania Infantry in Harrisburg on April 20, 1861. Regimental assignments during this three-month period often involved guard duty along key transportation points (railroads, main roads used by Union Army troops, etc.), as well as the occupation of Martinsburg, Virginia, and other towns in Maryland and Virginia.

The club, since inception, has provided a wide range of walks of all difficulties and durations both locally and internationally, as well as regular cycling, kayaking, and canyoning activities. The Bush Club has hundreds of members located in and around Sydney, and is affiliated with Bushwalking NSW, and through them, with Bushwalking Australia.  Foundation and early history  The club was founded by two well-known conservationists and bushwalkers, Marie Byles and Paddy Pallin, in 1939. Originally, the Bush Club concentrated on day-walks. In the club's earlier years, this focus was quite different to other clubs, such as the Sydney Bush Walkers Club, that had both an emphasis on longer, more difficult walks that involved overnight camping and rigorous entry tests screening out less able membership applicants. Byles and Pallin‚Äîwho were friends and both early and prominent members of the Sydney Bush Walkers‚Äîhad seen the need for a new club that allowed people to be introduced to bushwalking and the Australian bush, without overnight camping or entry tests. Relatively large National Parks‚ÄîRoyal, Ku-ring-gai Chase, and Blue Mountains National Parks, and other bushland reserves, such as Lane Cove Park‚Äîlie within easy reach of Sydney, providing ample scope for day-walks. Many of its earlier members were pre-war refugees from Nazi Germany and Austria. Although these members were refugees, many still had German and Austrian nationality and were classed as 'enemy aliens'‚Äîneeding to report to police regularly and therefore unable to participate in overnight camping activities. The Bush Club provided outdoor activity on its day-walks, as well as introducing these refugees to their new country, its flora and fauna, and to a welcoming network of new friends with a common interest. The club played a significant role in integrating pre-war and, later, post-war European refugees into the broader Australian community, at a time when insular and xenophobic attitudes to such refugees were quite common in Australia. The club also provided an outlet for older walkers, keener on nature observation than adventure, who did not wish to undertake arduous walks with overnight camping.  Geographical area of activity  Since inception, the club has organised walks in all national park areas around Sydney. These include The Royal National Park, the Blue Mountains, and the many national parks of the Hawkesbury River region. A number of urban and heritage walks are regularly scheduled in the inner parts of Sydney, as well as walks interstate and overseas.  Membership  Membership is open to anyone over 18. Prospective members need to complete at least three qualifying walks from the Walks Programme.  Leadership and management  The Club is run by a Committee of volunteers. Activity leaders are all volunteers from within the Club membership, and new members are encouraged to lead walks when they feel confident to do so. First aid training and navigation skills are encouraged for all members. Optional Leadership training is also available. The Bush Club provides an extensive programme of walks to its members. Those members can suggest and volunteer to lead specific walks which are then advertised in a quarterly electronic newsletter and programme. Walks are graded according to Bushwalking Australia guidelines, from easy to hard. As of July 2019 the Club had approximately 700 members.

History James Chapman, a tailor and draper of Kent, England, emigrated to South Australia with his wife Mary and their seven children aboard Rajah, arriving at Adelaide in April 1850. He founded a drapery on Hindley Street, at that time the premier business strip in the young city. Arthur Chapman was educated at J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution and began working for his father, then after some experience at the gold diggings at Goulburn, Victoria, where he worked as assistant in a general store for three years, returned to Adelaide and took up some clerical work. He then went into business on his own account at the Register Chambers as liquidator, in 1869 taking on Michael Kingsborough as partner, in Kingsborough & Chapman, land agents and investment brokers, with an office in the Advertiser Building. Among their staff was Harry Dickson Gell, later chairman of trustees of the State Bank. They dissolved the partnership seven years later, and in 1886 Chapman went into business as hotel broker and licensed valuator, with an office in Pirie Street. On the death that year of his brother Edgar Chapman, of the brewing firm of Simms & Chapman, he took over management of his estate, which included the Theatre Royal in Hindley Street, though he was acting for the ailing brother as early as 1883, In January 1885 he had joined George Rignold and James Allison as lessee and in December they withdrew from the partnership, leaving Chapman as sole manager until Wybert Reeve became lessee in 1887. Chapman initiated extensive alterations in 1905 at a cost of over ¬£4,000 and a rebuild of the theatre in 1913‚Äì1914 at a cost of ¬£21,000. He was a prominent Freemason.

With the erection of Fetislam the Turkish defense line towards Hungary was completed and this line was made of fortresses in Smederevo, Kulic, Ram, Golubac and Fetislam. The last one was composed from two parts: the Smaller and the Greater town. The Smaller town was erected around 1524 as a starting point of Turkish assaults on Erdelj. During the Austro-Turkish conflicts from 1717 to 1739 the Smaller Town acquires strategic importance, thus the Greater Town is erected around it. Later around 1818 the dirt-built ramparts are topped with curtain walls. After the last reconstruction Fetislam is turned into a artillery bastion. The whole complex of this fortress was surrounded with a still visible deep and wide trench, which used to be filled with water from a Danube's branch. The Turkish garrison stayed up until 1867, when Fetislam was handed over to the Serbian prince Mihajlo Obrenoviƒá along with six other cities.

He immigrated to Hawaii from Guangdong in 1849 and adopted the surname Afong after the diminutive form of his Cantonese given name, Ah Fong. Afong started off working for his uncle's retail store in Honolulu and later became the co-owner of a chain of stores selling Oriental novelties. In due time, he made a fortune investing in retail, shipping, opium sales, and sugar and coffee plantations, eventually becoming the first Chinese millionaire on the islands. In 1856, Afong helped organize a ball in honor of the wedding of King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma that helped to solidify the Chinese community's position in Honolulu. He briefly served as the commercial agent and diplomatic consul for the Qing Dynasty to the Hawaiian Kingdom and was a member of King KalƒÅkaua's Privy Council. While retaining a separate family in China, Afong married Hawaiian-British noblewoman Julia Fayerweather Afong, a marriage which brought with it closer ties to the Hawaiian nobility and ruling class. They raised a large mixed-race family which included many daughters and two sons: Chun Chik-yu and Chun Lung (his eldest son from his Chinese wife), who assisted him with his business empires. After four decades in Hawaii, Afong retired to his home village in 1890 leaving Julia and most of her children behind. He relocated his business empire to Macau and Hong Kong. In his last years, his charitable deeds were recognized by the Guangxu Emperor who erected the Meixi Memorial Archways and made him a mandarin of the first rank. He died in his home village in 1906. His life has been caricatured in 1912 short-story \\"Chun Ah Chun\\", by American novelist Jack London and 13 Daughters, a short- lived 1961 Broadway musical written by his great-grandson. In 1997, Bob Dye, who married one of Afong's descendants, wrote a book chronicling his life titled Merchant Prince of the Sandalwood Mountains: Afong and the Chinese in Hawai ªi.  Biography  Afong was born in the village of Wong Mau Cha (), Xiangshan County, the present day Meixi Village, Qianshan, Zhuhai, Guangdong. He was of the Punti Cantonese community which held a longstanding dispute with the Hoklo and Hakka peoples; the latter conflict spilled into the Punti-Hakka Clan Wars from 1855 to 1868. Competition between Hakka and Punti continued in the immigrant communities of Hawaii. Afong arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in 1849 with his uncle to assist at his retail store in Honolulu. At the time, Hawaii was known by the Chinese as the \\"Sandalwood Mountains\\" () after the abundant sandalwood trees which were exported to Asia during the reign of Kamehameha I. When asked his name by a Hawaiian immigration official, he responded by giving his Chinese family name Chun followed by Ah Fong using the common Cantonese diminutive prefix Ah (). However, the official thought he had given his name in the Western fashion and thus he became Chun Afong with his Chinese given name used as his surname. He started his own business with his friend Qing Ming Qwai or Achuck in 1865. They became the co-owners of Afong & Achuck, a chain of stores selling Oriental novelties including brocades and silks to Chinese residents and the upper echelon of Honolulu society. In 1856, Afong and the Cantonese merchant community hosted a ball in honor of the wedding of King Kamehameha IV and Emma Rooke. The multi-racial event helped to solidify the Chinese community's position in Honolulu. Afong returned to China in 1850 to marry Lee Hong (), who became his primary kit-fat (wife) (). However, he would marry again in Hawaii while Lee Hong remained in China. In 1857, he was naturalized as a Hawaiian subject in order to marry the British- Hawaiian noblewoman Julia Fayerweather Afong. The union connected him to the ruling Hawaiian elite class including the future king, KalƒÅkaua, who owed his 1874 election as monarch in part to Afong's financial support. His business in Hawaii grew steadily with investments in retail, shipping, opium sales, and sugar and coffee plantations. Afong soon became the first Chinese millionaire in the Hawaiian Islands. = Political appointments = King KalƒÅkaua appointed Afong to the Privy Council of State, the advisory council to the monarch, on June 5, 1879. However, he resigned shortly afterward to become a diplomatic agent for the Chinese government in Hawaii. He was appointed commercial agent (shangdong) for China by the Chinese Minister to the United States in Washington, DC, Chen Lanbin, on August 13, 1879. He was not recognized by the Hawaiian government until mid-February 1880 when he was issued an exequatur. He resigned as consul in March 1882. Ultimately, the Aki opium scandal (in which his son Chun Lung, called Alung, was involved) became one of the corruption charges leading to the July 1887 coup of the king by his opponents. He was forced to sign the 1887 Bayonet Constitution which restricted his executive power. After the signing of the Bayonet Constitution, the suffrage system in the kingdom was changed. New racial and property restrictions targeting poor Native Hawaiians and all Asians were implemented. These groups, along with many naturalized subjects of Chinese descent who had been able to vote in previous elections, were disenfranchised, while the vote was extended to non-naturalized foreign Euro-American residents. = Return to China = After his eldest son Alung died in August 1889, he sold or reorganized most of his business holdings in Hawaii and invested in the Douglas Steamship Company in Hong Kong. He named Samuel Mills Damon as administrator of an estate left in Hawaii to support his wife Julia and their many children. He relocated his business quarter to Hong Kong and Macau and sailed from Hawaii for a final time on October 17, 1890. Toney (Chun Chik-yu), his eldest son by Julia, accompanied him back to assist him and would later become an influential businessman in his own right. Afong would remain in China for the rest of his life while managing his remaining business abroad. On September 25, 1906, Afong died quietly at the age of 81 at his home in Meixi Village.  Legacy  The Meixi Memorial Archways built by order of the Guangxu Emperor to commemorate the charitable deeds of Chun Afong = Former residences and memorials = In his hometown, the Meixi Memorial Archways, combining Chinese and European architectural elements, were built by order of the Guangxu Emperor in 1886 and 1891 to commemorate the charitable deeds of Chun Afong and his father in their home village. He was also made a mandarin of the first rank by imperial edict and was awarded with four tablets bearing the words: \\"Generous, Charitable, Selfless and Kindhearted\\". The property, part of the larger Chun family estate, includes the family mansion, gardens, ancestral temple, and the cemetery grounds of the extended family. The site was looted and vandalized during the Cultural Revolution and one of the four arches was destroyed. Even Afong's grand tomb was ransacked and his remains later reburied in a more simple grave next to his first wife, his concubine and son Toney. The residence was subsequently used as barracks and later dormitories for factory workers. The Chun family estate in Meixi is presently a museum and tourist attraction. The first lychee (litchi chinensi) tree in Hawaii was planted at Afong's Honolulu mansion on Nu ªuanu Avenue and School Street in 1873 by his business associate and friend Achuck, who had brought the plant back from a trip to China. The tree later became known as the \\"Afong\\" tree. The cultivar variety once identified as Guiwei was later re- identified as the Dazou variety. The lychee tree still stands at the former Nu ªuanu Shopping Plaza (now a Walgreens) along with a banyan tree (reportedly the oldest banyan in Honolulu) also planted by Afong. A second historic banyan tree was cut down in 2005.; ; ; ; The site of Afong's Waikƒ´kƒ´ villa, where he entertained royalty and dignitaries, was sold in 1904 to the United States Army Corps of Engineers for the construction of Battery Randolph and Battery Dudley, built to defend Honolulu Harbor from foreign attacks. It is now part of the property of the U.S. Army Museum of Hawaii and Fort DeRussy Military Reservation. There is an informational marker describing the villa and Afong's legacy and it is a stop on the Waikƒ´kƒ´ Historic Trail. = Literary representation = In 1909, Chun Afong's life was fictionalized in the short magazine story, \\"Chun Ah Chun\\", by American novelist Jack London. It was later published in his 1912 book The House of Pride: And Other Tales of Hawaii. London's highly embellished story of Afong depicts him as a \\"crafty coolie\\" who spites the white capitalist establishment through his own business success. He also entices white men with money to marry his racially-mixed daughters across the color-line. In 1961, his great-grandson Eaton \\"Bob\\" Magoon Jr. wrote the book, music and lyrics to 13 Daughters, a short-lived Broadway musical. Don Ameche played the eponymous Chun. In 1997, Kailua-based freelance writer and historian Bob Dye (1928‚Äì2010) wrote Merchant Prince of the Sandalwood Mountains: Afong and the Chinese in Hawai ªi. The book was dedicated to his wife ballet dancer Tessa Gay Magoon Dye (1946‚Äì2002), a great- great granddaughter of Chun Afong, who assisted her husband with her personal research into her family history. The couple visited the site of Afong's old family compound in Meixi and were consulted by the local Chinese authorities when they were transforming it into a museum and tourist attraction. Dye's book was praised for its meticulous research and detailed account of the experiences Afong and of the Chinese immigrant community in Hawaii. In a 1998 review in Hawaiian Historical Society's The Hawaiian Journal of History, contributing professor Loretta Pang noted: > Bob Dye has enriched our understanding of the complexities of life in > Hawai ªi. This labor of familial love (his wife, to whom the book is > dedicated, is Afong's great-great granddaughter) pares away some of the myth > surrounding Chun Afong and the immigrant experience. In a way, what emerges > is a cautionary tale of the dangers of a single-crop economy and weak > political leadership, the human cost of diplomatic maneuvers, and the > difficulties of creating a multicultural society free from exploitation. Yet > although the title of the book refers to Afong and the Chinese in Hawai ªi, > the two dimensions alluded to are not explored as fully as they might be. > That is, Afong's relations with and place among the Chinese in Hawai ªi and > the place of the Chinese among the native people of Hawai ªi with whom Afong > associated are topics deserving fuller treatment in their own right and as > approaches to understanding Afong.  Marriage and children  Chun Afong fathered a large family with his two wives Lee Hong (who remained in Meixi) and Julia Fayerweather Afong (who remained in Hawaii) and one concubine (also in China). The following list of descendants is compiled from the family history of his descendants in Dye's Merchant Prince of the Sandalwood Mountains: With his primary wife Lee Hong (), he had three sons: #Chan Lung, known as Chun Lung or Alung, (1852‚Äì1889), married Ung See Soy and had three children: Chan Mui-Ngan, Chan Wing-On and Chan Unnamed.

Anti- Pacifism  The WPC, having formed after World War I and during the First Red Scare, was allied against communism, anarchy, and pacifism (especially internationally).

Topics discussed in the journal included the role of stylization versus naturalism in actors' physical movement, role of spectacle, the grotesque aesthetic, intellectualism, Formalism, audience affect, proletarian content, divisions between art and life, children's theatre, populist forms, comparisons with European and American trends in culture. The journal welcomed letters from the readers, in particular those of proletarian background. In and outside of the pages of the journal, the contributing writers played an active role in the discussion of the role of theatre in Moscow during NEP reforms and actively defended the development of the Left front against what they termed as rightist, conservative critique. In a preface to the 24th edition, the writer V. Mass discussed the determining relationship between revolutionary theatre and NEP policy, the state financier and official promoter of cultural reforms in the USSR. He stated that \\"we need to remember that today's art is an unavoidable reaction caused by the economic situation. We are experimenting and sharpening our weapons. Let our animosity towards today's art aid us in the creation of truly new forms, ready for the new objective reality.\\" In the 22nd edition, the writer A. Fevralsky characterized the task of the Left front as one of careful study of the material and the effective use of dialectic materialism as a tool for the forging of the new Marxist science of art. A. Fevralsky stated that \\"in parallel to this task, we need to strengthen the propaganda of the materialist understanding of art: the unveiling of class essence contained not only in the subject, but in the formal element of art.\\" The editors univocally condemned any \\"fetish of beauty\\" in art and were critical of bourgeois tendencies, unsubstantiated aesthetic, and spiritual escapism. \\"What kind of theatre does the proletariat need?\\", an article published in the 18th edition, reviewed the discussion in the forum of the same name held at the Central Proletarian Club by members of the Left front (with the participation of Arvatov, Pletnev, Gomza, O. Brik, Tretyakov and Chuzhak) and the so-called Marxist opposition, the followers of Plekhanov on 20 December 1922. The article reported on statements issued concerning correct and timely theatre as one that specifically activates the consciousness of the proletariat, and restated that the existent forms of theatre were not appropriate for the task. In the article, the speaker Arvatov argued that proletarian theatre ought to appropriate forms such as cabaret, circus, operetta and clown-show, then praising the work of V. Meyerhold for pioneering revolutionary worker's theatre. Despite the critique of the journal for its intellectualism, the left-wing writers of the journal were highly invested in developing mass forms of popular spectacle, such as the circus and dance. Boris. Arvatov, in an article titled \\"What is it about worker's theatre\\" argued for the need to develop an \\"agit-theatre,\\" which would discourage from passive viewing and escapist illusion and which would activate real people. \\"Because of this task,\\" Arvatov writes, \\"we have to use circus, cabaret and cinema.\\" For the duration of the journal's run (1922-1924), the members of the Left front were critiqued for their affiliation with Formalism. The critiques were published and engaged with in the pages of the journal. The basis of the critique in articles such as \\"A Spoon without Soup\\" was that the Left front, in an attempt the empty the art of psychological, subjective bourgeois content, was creating \\"empty and incomprehensible forms\\" that were accessible only to an intellectual audience. The members of the Left front understood art as necessarily formal, but also, were committed to destroying the bourgeois separation between art in life, and in effect, fought for an art that could represent new revolutionary life. The writer Vladimir Mass wrote a defense of the Left front against such accusations by stating that the form/content debate itself was regressive and that \\"goal-oriented expediency is the main question of new art.\\" According to Mass, revolutionary art should either be utilitarian like constructivism or it should serve as a tool for the organization of social consciousness and be the crucial expression of new culture. \\"The search for new forms by the true artist is always the result of the need to express new content,\\" he wrote. Another frequent topic of the journal was the role of audience in theatre. In a letter to the journal, \\"Simple Truths. I am a viewer,\\" a theatre-goer opposed the view that theatre should be a particular way and that there is a correct way for theatre to be experienced by the audience. \\"I don't need an accurate understanding of theatre, but simply form the experience of pleasure when viewing a spectacle.\\" The writers of the journal held idealistic views about serving an audience of proletarian background. Among the discussion on the means of integration of the proletariat into revolutionary culture, was the conversation on the general discrimination against uneducated viewers from theatre, which had previously been reserved for the bourgeois audience. In \\"About polite and impolite audience,\\" a writer narrated the conception of the working-class audience as being late and eating during the performance, and argued that to the contrary, true \\"vulgarity is the sister of riches.\\"  Vsevolod Meyerhold & GITIS  The journal was supportive of the work of Russian and Soviet theatre director Vsevolod Meyerhold. The 30th edition of the journal was dedicated to the celebration of 25 years of Meyehold's work in theatre. The writers of the journal praised Meyerhold's constant commitment to dialectic method and his intuitive awareness of revolutionary theatre that predated the 1917 Revolution. M. Beksin wrote that \\"Already in 1906(!) Meyerhold makes the following remarks: Natural theatre does not understand plastics, it inhibits actors from training their bodies, and, while making theatre schools, forgets that the base subject should be physical sport.\\" Other articles, such as those by O. Brik and Mikhail Levidov reveal the general lack of support for Meyerhold in Moscow circles by praising him despite his failure. The article \\"Success to the Loser\\" stated Meyerhold as a true revolutionary, and that only \\"a loser is true to the revolution.\\" Other articles examined his pedagogy and the development of new forms of communist theatre in his workshop. The State Institute of Theatre Arts (GITIS, Russian:–ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç –¢–µ–∞—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—á–æ –ò—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–∞, –ì–ò–¢–ò–° ), was opened on September 17, 1922 with Meyerhold serving as creative director. The journal extensively promoted the workshops at GITIS, seeing GITIS as the first school of revolutionary theatre and a victory for the Left front. Meyerhold envisioned GITIS as a place for the scientific development of the human through physical exercise and the construction of new culture where science, art and work would be united. Meyerhold's interest in Taylorism influences his development of Biomechanics - the actor training technique, implemented at GITIS. Biomechanics was called \\"Taylorism on stage\\" and was favorably reviewed by the journal. In the inaugural season 1922‚Äì1923, 125 students were studying in GITIS and staged 136 performances in total. In a review, the journal stated that the performances were up to 70% sold out. The report also stated that the economic conditions of the theater troupe were difficult. In 1923 the theatre of GITIS became separate from the school and was called Meyerhold Theatre. The writers of the journal defended Meyerhold from the critique he received from Lunacharsky, as part of a larger critique of Formalism at this time. In his article \\"On the theatre of red byt,\\" reviewed in the journal, Lunacharsky discussed the importance of revolutionary content and heroism. In a discussion piece, V. Shershenevich stated that \\"art requires a formal solution. Without form there is no art, but there can be art without content. But that does not mean that content is impossible, unnecessary or evil.\\" Meyerhold's theatre was accused of being stylized by Lunacharsky, where revolutionary theatre called for aesthetic realism. Shershenevich argued that Meyerhold's theatre pursued true realism. As socialist realism became the official aesthetic, Meyerhold, serving as theatre director, continued to oppose it. Meyerhold was arrested on June 20, 1939 and executed by a firing squad in 1940.  Views On Western Art  Several editions of the journal are dedicated to the discussion and critique of Western trends in art. The method of dialectical materialism, developed in the journal, was used to evaluate the cultural activities in bourgeois countries. The 19th edition featured a review of the reception of \\"Leftist Russian theatre\\" in Europe and America. The reception was not favorable: \\"The orientation on the money-spending audience of Europe and on the European bourgeoisie is not successful. When the Left Russian theatre that will have the material opportunity to perform in front of the working masses of the West, we will be deserving of real, moral success.\\" The timing of the article was concurrent to the exceptional success of state-sponsored First Russian Art Exhibition in Berlin in October 1922, which featured the work of both representative painting and the Left front. An article titled \\"Berlin Today- from the Reflections and Meetings of Mayakovsky\\" narrated Mayakovsky's meetings with the Russian emigre writers in Germany. The article described Berlin as an \\"impoverished and ill city, waiting to be cured by the proletarian revolution.\\" According to Mayakovsky, there were no interesting theaters in Germany and the general poor state of the arts was due to the expiration of formalist aesthetics without a social basis. With frequent mention of Charlie Chaplin, the pages of the journal offer much praise for the development of cinema in Hollywood. In \\"Art of the West\\", the critic Osip Brik praised American popular drama for its mass appeal and ability to create \\"tension, unpredictability and grotesque situations, comicality\\" and stated that the Soviet Union had a long way to catch up to the American level of creativity. In a discussion on dance in the West vis a vis by the bourgeois standard of morality, Osip Brik wrote that dance had been seen as vulgar due to its physicality. Contrary to the exile of dance to the stage, Brik argued that dance should be available to everyone and ought to be practiced by the proletariat as a sport after work. An interview with Stanislavsky, who was traveling in the United States and visited theatre productions in New York, was published in the 35/36 edition of the journal. Stanislavsky critiqued the appropriation of European theatre technique in American dramatic arts, stating the need to be inspired by American way of life. M. Gering, in a review that remarked on American jazz and the reception of Moscow theatre troupe in USA, wrote that Americans love theatre, but do not have real theatre: \\"Meyerhold today uses elements of almost American theatre, but he also knows what to do and what theatre is, which the Americans do not.\\"  Contributors  * Lev Kolpakchi * Vsevolod Meyerhold * Sergei Tretyakov * Pingvin * Ikar * Riurik Rok * M Beksin * Nikolai Tarabukin * Sergei Bugoslavsky * Samuil Margolin * Vadim Shershenevich * Momus * Mikhail Levidov * Aksel Eggegrekht * Aleksei Gan * Aleksandr Fevralsky  References  Category:Weekly journals Category:Soviet literature ","title":"Zrelishcha"},{"id":"54046169","text":"The 1970 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team represented the Georgia Institute of Technology in the 1970 NCAA University Division football season.

The original two-part bronze statue of a human figure was commissioned for the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City, where it has been displayed outdoors since 1965 in a pool of water to the north of the new Metropolitan Opera House. Other copies in plaster or bronze exist, and are displayed in other cities. Background Moore received the commission to create a sculpture for a pool of water outside the Lincoln Center in December 1961, with the substantial fee of $225,000 to cover all his costs, including materials, casting and shipping, using funds donated by Albert List and Vera List. The center's architect, Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, suggested Moore, but there was resistance from some members of the Lincoln Center Arts Committee. Some objected to the selection of a European sculptor; Newbold Morris, then Parks Commissioner of New York City, described the work as \\"junk\\", and wanted it removed. Moore visited the site in 1962, exclaiming that the pool was as big as a cricket pitch, but declined to create a site-specific work. Instead, the work was based on some exiting ideas from Moore's earlier drawings and maquettes. Moore was attracted by the idea that the work would be reflected in the water, and decided to work on the concept of woman and rock rising from the water. (Meanwhile, back-room negotiations ensured that the Moore sculpture intended for the Lincoln Center would not become overshadowed by prospective Moore commissions for the Seagram Building, at One Chase Manhattan Plaza, and at Columbia Law School, although a cast of Moore's Three-Way Piece: Points was installed at Columbia in 1967.) Description The sculpture comprises two elements: one resembles the head and torso of a human figure, and the other can be seen the figure's legs. The torso is a relatively thin slab of bronze, with protruding rounded lumps suggesting body parts, the top terminating at a fin which can be interpreted as the head and which extends down the back of the torso into its backbone. It has no discernible arms, and becomes arched into two parts as it enters the water. It leans towards the second element, which also joins the water with columns separated by an arch. The roughly textured surfaces and other smoothly rounded faces of the second element bear some resemblance to an eroded cliff. Indeed, the art critic David Thompson has suggested an allusion to the arch at √âtretat painted by several French Impressionists. Casts Two Piece Reclining Figure No.5 1963-4 at Kenwood House in 2005 Moore's ideas for the sculpture may have been inspired by a flint stone, and he probably worked on some early clay or plaster maquettes in 1962 to develop his ideas, although none have been identified from those that survive. Two of the maquettes were increased in scale to create half-size plaster working models, each supported by an armature. Moore worked on the surface of the working models with chisels and other tools. The completed plaster models were painted a dark colour, and placed in a pond at his home and studio at Perry Green, Hertfordshire. Moore selected one working model (LH 518) for the Lincoln Center commission, and the other became Two Piece Reclining Figure No.5 1963-4 (LH 517). Moore later had two bronze casts made of the plaster working model, measuring . Moore presented one bronze cast to the Tate Gallery in 1978, along with 35 other works. It was included in the exhibition to celebrate Moore's 80th birthday at the Tate that year, on the grass outside the gallery. It has been on long-term loan to Charing Cross Hospital since 1980, where it is displayed in a pool that was created for it. Moore donated the plaster working model to the Art Gallery of Ontario in 1974. A second bronze cast is in the collection of the MIT List Visual Arts Center, mounted on a granite base; it was donated by Vera Glaser List in memory of Samuel Glaser. A third version is located on Henry Moore‚Äôs estate in Hertfordshire, England. The working model was scaled up again to create a plaster version of the full-size sculpture. This sculpture was so large that Moore needed a new temporary studio, a metal structure covered with transparent plastic sheeting, to house it while he worked on it. He used the same structure for his largest outdoor works until it became dilapidated and was removed in the 1980s. After the full-scale plaster model was completed in August 1964, it was cut into pieces to be sent to the Hermann Noack foundry in Berlin, where the pieces were cast in bronze and welded together again to create the completed work. It was shipped on MS Finnclipper in July 1965, and installed at the Lincoln Centre on 21 September 1965. The full-size bronze sculpture (LH 519) is high and feet long, making it Moore's largest work at that date: it was twice the size of his stone UNESCO Reclining Figure of 1958, although his later Large Reclining Figure of 1984 would be long. The work was removed in 2007, to allow the North Plaza at the Lincoln Center to be reconfigured. The sculpture was reinstalled in a smaller pool in 2009, which was named the Paul Milstein Pool in 2011.

Although their distribution covers a large portion of the western United States, crescents are often found in similar contexts in close proximity to water sources including playas, lakes, rivers, and mainland and island coast lines. Crescents are generally thought to be diagnostic to the terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene (approx. 12,000-8,000 years before present [YBP]) and are representative of assemblages that include fluted and stemmed projectile points.  Crescent morphology  Crescents are a type of artifact or group of artifacts that are somewhat morphologically diverse, but typically consist of a chipped-stone tool that is bilaterally symmetrical, bifacially pressure flaked, may have winged edges, and typically have edge-grinding. Crescents are typically found as part of surface assemblages as opposed to well-dated subsurface contexts, and lack good chronology which would indicate if the degree of morphological variability represents changes over time, or if the differences represent regional expressions. Crescent morphology has been subdivided into three groups including lunate, winged, and eccentric crescents. Lunate crescents typically have a curved/convex proximal lateral edge with a generally straight to convex distal lateral edge. Winged crescents are characterized by convex proximal lateral edge and a concave distal lateral edge. Some eccentric crescents have been described as being shaped like animals such as bears, while others consist of serrated or barbed edges. The most common materials crescents are made of include chert, chalcedony, and jasper‚Äîall strong and durable lithic materials that are not as brittle as obsidian; however, although its rare, some crescents are made of obsidian.  Temporal and spatial distribution  Chipped-stone crescents are found within the western United States, primarily as part of surface assemblages throughout the Great Basin, the Columbia Plateau, and in California ‚Äì primarily along the mainland and Channel Island coastlines, as well as the San Joaquin Valley and Mojave Desert. Crescents are associated with archaeological assemblages dating from the Terminal Pleistocene-to the Early Holocene (12,000-8,000 calibrated years before present [cal BP]) and tend to disappear from the archaeological record after 7,500 cal BP. Of the thousands of crescents documented to date in the western United States, approximately 94 percent of the sites in which they were discovered are within 10 kilometers of large existing or extinct bodies of water including wetlands, marches, rivers, and pluvial lakes. In the Great Basin, crescents are often found in artifact assemblages characterized as belonging to the Western Stemmed Tradition (WST), which is composed of artifact classes that would indicate an economy focused on big-game hunting. These WST assemblages represent a timeframe spanning from approximately 12,000-8,500 cal BP, which spanned the Terminal Pleistocene and Early Holocenea period of cooler and wetter climate that supported hundreds of pluvial lakes throughout the Great Basin. Many WST assemblages are found on the remnant landforms of pluvial lakes; however, there are some that are found in caves far from known bodies of water. In California, the known distribution of crescents extend along the coast from Sonoma County in the north to northern Baja in the south, in addition to inland settings in the southern San Joaquin Valley where crescents have been recovered along shorelines of extinct lakes. Approximately one-third of the crescents recovered from coastal California sites come from Santa Rosa and San Miguel islands. Though many crescents found on the islands are associated with surface artifact scatters, there are those that have been recovered from stratified subsurface deposits from which diagnostic artifacts, such as the Channel Island Barbed projectile point, as well as with faunal assemblages comprising waterfowl, seabirds, marine mammals, and fish. Within the San Joaquin Valley, thousands of crescents have originated from sites located on the shoreline of Tulare Lake, which covered much of the southern portion of the valley. Similarly, crescent fragments have also been found in subsurface deposits dating to 7,600-8,200 cal BP associated with sites on the shoreline of extinct Buena Vista Lake, also located in the southern San Joaquin Valley.

Mustering in for the first time during the presidential era of George Washington, members of this artillery unit went on to serve tours of duty in the War of 1812, Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and, as members of the Union army of the United States, during the American Civil War, before disbanding. Having determined that Reading needed to improve its military readiness, civic leaders of the 1880s authorized the formation of a new artillery unit, and also chose to name it as \\"Reading Artillerists\\" in deference to the original unit's storied history. That militia unit then mustered in for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and continued its service during the early part of the 20th century.A Condensed History of the Reading Artillerists, in Reading Times.

Founding of the organization  Although the 1859 Reading Times article, A Condensed History of the Reading Artillerists, stated that this militia unit was founded \\"in the year 1799, for the purpose of quelling the celebrated Whiskey Rebellion,\\"Reading Artillerists, Condensed History, in Reading Times, 1859. the exact founding date was half a decade earlier ‚Äì March 23, 1794, according to Berks County historian Morton L. Montgomery.Montgomery, Morton L. Historical and Biographical Annals of Berks County Pennsylvania Embracing a Concise History of the County and a Genealogical and Biographical Record of Representative Families, Vol. I. Chicago: J. H. Beers & Co., 1909, p. 143. Known as the Reading Union Volunteers when mustered in for the Whiskey Rebellion, this militia unit quickly gained a reputation for skill and dependability, as evidenced by its having been accorded the honor, just seven months after its founding, of serving as the escort for U.S. President George Washington.Reading Union Volunteers, in Historical and Biographical Annals of Berks County, pp. 143, 158. Per Montgomery, during a visit by Washington to Reading, Pennsylvania on October 1, 1794, a parade was held in Washington's honor, \\"and the distinguished visitor reviewed the troops from the second story front window of the building over the doorway. The 'Reading Union Volunteers' participated in this military parade, and on the next day when President Washington continued his journey towards Carlisle, they accompanied him as an escort. While at Carlisle, they served as his body-guard. ... When they returned, the name of the Company was changed to 'Reading Washington Guards.'\\" The commanding officer of the unit at this time was 22-year-old Captain Daniel de Benneville Keim, a native of Reading.Reading Washington Guards, in Historical and Biographical Annals of Berks County, p. 143.Reading Artillerists, Condensed History, in Reading Times, 1859. Mustering out after the rebellion's end, members of this unit continued to maintain their readiness as a functioning militia, and mustered in again formally as the Reading Washington Guards in 1799 in response to the \\"Fries' Insurrection,\\" which erupted when Congress attempted to tax house windows.Montgomery, Historical Sketch, pp. 12-13.  War of 1812  Just over a decade later, the Reading Washington Guards were called upon once again to defend the nation, this time during the War of 1812. During this phase of duty, the group changed its name yet again, this time becoming the Reading Washington Blues sometime in or before October 1814.Reading Artillerists, Condensed History, in Reading Times, 1859.Montgomery, Historical Sketch, pp. 13‚Äì14. Departing for Philadelphia by boat on the Schuylkill River on September 16, 1814, the unit helped defend the city from threatened invasions by British troops. When those threats lessened, the 74 militiamen from Reading were ordered to Camp Dupont near Wilmington, Delaware, where \\"they became a part of the 'Advance Light Brigade,' in the First Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, which was under the command of General Cadwalader.\\"Montgomery, Historical Sketch, pp. 13-14. Ordered from Camp Dupont to Baltimore, Maryland, they were assigned to artillery duty, and given charge of four brass, six-pound cannon, one of which they would bring home with them to Reading when they returned to the city. They were officially mustered out from service in March 1815.Montgomery, Historical Sketch, pp. 13-14. Sometime between their service in Baltimore and 1820, the members of the unit opted to change their name again ‚Äì this time to the Reading Artillerists. Keim was re-elected as the group's captain in 1820 with William Darling, Peter Aurand, and Peter Reitzel serving, respectively, as first, second, and third lieutenants. The unit strength at this time was 98.Reading Artillerists, in Historical and Biographical Annals of Berks County, p. 143.  1820s‚Äì1830s  In 1824, the Reading Artillerists were among the Pennsylvania soldiers who were on hand in Philadelphia to welcome the Marquis de Lafayette, the last living French general who fought beside George Washington during the American Revolution. Sometime after this, the unit's blue uniforms were exchanged for dark gray with yellow facings. On July 19, 1828, the unit's leadership adopted \\"a code of laws for the better government of the corps.Reading Artillerists, Condensed History, in Reading Times, 1859.Montgomery, Historical Sketch, p. 15. In 1830, the Artillerists' longtime commanding officer, Daniel Keim, ended his tenure of leadership. He was succeeded by his nephew, George May Keim, who served as captain from 1830‚Äì1834.Reading Artillerists, in Historical and Biographical Annals, p. 143. A former manager of the Reading Library Company, George Keim later went on to become Colonel of the 53rd Pennsylvania and, in 1835, \\"Major-General of the Sixth Division,\\" according to The Biographical Encyclopaedia of Pennsylvania.Keim, General George May, in The Biographical Encyclopaedia of Pennsylvania of the Nineteenth Century. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Galaxy Publishing Company, 1874, p. 331. Elected as captain by the group's membership in 1834, William H. Miller then served as commanding officer until 1839.Reading Artillerists, in Historical and Biographical Annals, p. 143. Before the decade was out, the Artillerists were bidding a sad, but fond farewell to their former leader. Following his passing on March 16, 1837 at the age of 65, Daniel Keim was eulogized by the Democratic Press as someone with an \\"enviable reputation for honesty\\" and a \\"generous disposition,\\" which \\"made him generally known as 'the poor man's stay and the soldier's friend.\\"Montgomery, Historical Sketch, p. 21.  1840s  In 1841, the organization's leadership changed again when Thomas S. Leoser was elected as captain and commanding officer in February. At their next meeting in March, members of the unit unanimously agreed \\"to adopt the full dress uniform of the United States Artillery,\\" according to Montgomery.Reading Artillerists, Condensed History, in Reading Times, 1859. Called up during the religious riots rocking Philadelphia in 1844, the Reading Artillerists guarded the Girard Bank and state arsenal there, and were attached to the First Battalion of the Reading Volunteers, along with the National Grays and Washington Grays.Reading Artillerists, in Historical and Biographical Annals of Berks County, p. 143.Reading Artillerists, in Condensed History, Reading Times, 1859.Montgomery, Historical Sketch, p. 15. Upon their honorable discharge in July 1844, Major-General Robert Patterson, commanding officer of the Pennsylvania Militia, described the Reading Artillerists and their fellow members of the First Battalion as \\"gallant and well-disciplined\\" men who exhibited \\"exemplary and soldier-like deportment,\\" and thanked them for \\"their alacrity in reporting for duty.\\"Montgomery, Historical Sketch, p. 15.  Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War  The day after Christmas in 1846, 90 Reading Artillerists headed off for what would be one of this militia unit's most challenging and dangerous duty assignments. Mustering in for federal service at Pittsburgh on January 5, 1847, they formed Company A of the 2nd Pennsylvania Infantry. Their officers included Captain Thomas S. Leoser, First Lieutenant William Wunder, and Second Lieutenants Levi P. Knerr and H. A. M. Filbert.Montgomery, Historical Sketch, pp. 15‚Äì17.Reading Artillerists, in Historical and Biographical Annals of Berks County, p. 143. Transported by boat to New Orleans, Louisiana, they were stationed initially on the Island of Lobos in Mexico. Attached to the command of General Winfield Scott during the Mexican War, the Artillersts then engaged with their fellow 2nd Pennsylvania infantrymen in the Siege of Veracruz from March 9‚Äì29, fought in the Battle of Cerro Gordo on April 18, garrisoned Jalapa from May through mid-June, skirmished at the Pass of Latoeya June 20, and were also present at Contreras, Cherubusco, Perote, Puebla, and Tepeyahualco, as well as the Battle of Chapultepec. They were also on hand for action at the Gate of Belen and Citadel on September 13 and at the city of Mexico from September 14‚Äì15, 1847.Reading Artillerists, Condensed History, in Reading Times, 1859. According to a 1915 Reading Times recap of the Artillerists' service during the war, \\"Col. John W. Geary in his report to General Winfield Scott after the taking of the city of Mexico stated that the Reading artillerists allowed no one to surpass them in the performance of duty and in crossing from Garita to the breast work of the citadel acted with great coolness in exposed positions.\\"Company A Has Long and Varied Military History: Name Has Been Changed Five Times Since Organization in 1794, in Reading Times.

Wunder's \\"remains were sent home and buried from the Court House with great civic and military display,\\" according to Montgomery.Montgomery, Historical Sketch, p. 16. Their tour of duty ended, the Reading Artillerists mustered out from the 2nd Pennsylvania on July 28, 1848, and returned home to their families. The next day, \\"they were given a brilliant reception by a military parade of 800 men, consisting of two companies of cavalry and eight companies of infantry,\\" according to Montgomery.Montgomery, Historical Sketch, p. 16.  1850s  As with prior peace-time periods, the Reading Artillerists' membership continued to fluctuate over the next several years. By 1855, the entire slate of officers had been replaced. Commanding the unit moving forward were Captain W. I. Clous, First Lieutenant W. W. Diehl, Second Lieutenants S. T. Ketterer and J. D. Hain. Their places were then filled on the November 2, 1857 by Captain George Warren Alexander, First Lieutenant W. H. Andrews, and Second Lieutenant H. R. Myers. Alexander would continue to lead the Reading Artillerists through the earliest days of America's Civil War.Reading Artillerists, Attention!, in Reading Times. Reading, Pennsylvania: September 12, 1861.Reading Artillerists, Condensed History, in Reading Times, 1859.  U.S. Civil War  Offering the services of his soldiers to President Abraham Lincoln and Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin on April 16, 1861 in response to Lincoln's call for 75,000 volunteers to defend Washington, D.C. following the fall of Fort Sumter to Confederate forces, Captain G. W. Alexander then oversaw the preparations of his militiamen as they readied their unit for what many hoped would be a short deployment.Montgomery, Historical Sketch, pp. 17‚Äì19. According to Berks County historian Arthur D. Graff, Rosa Nicolls presented a letter to Alexander \\"just as the company was departing for service\\" in which she advised him of her society's intention to support the Reading Artillerists and other local militia units in their efforts to protect the state and nation: > [A meeting of the Ladies Aid Society] was held here last evening for the > purpose of furnishing clothing and other necessities to those in need of > same.

On 20 April 1861, Alexander and his Reading Artillerists officially mustered at Harrisburg, Dauphin County with Company G of the 1st Pennsylvania Infantry. Primarily tasked with protecting several major roads used by Union Army troops, they also stood guard at vulnerable points along key railroad lines. After honorably completing their three months' service, they then mustered out at Harrisburg on July 23, 1861.Snyder, Laurie. Lieutenant Colonel George Warren (\\"G.W.\\") Alexander, in 47th Pennsylvania Volunteers: One Civil War Regiment's Story, retrieved online May 2, 2017. Alexander was then recommissioned as the second in command of the newly formed 47th Pennsylvania Infantry, which would become the only regiment from the Keystone State to fight in the Union's 1864 Red River Campaign across Louisiana. Wounded severely in both legs during the Battle of Sabine Cross Roads (Mansfield) on April 8, 1864, he recovered, and was honorably discharged in September 1864 upon expiration of this three-year term of service.Bates, Samuel P.

Most of Alexander's subordinates also re- enrolled for three-year terms of service, serving with different units until war's end. Several were wounded or killed in combat, including William H. Andrews who died during the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862.Civil War Veterans' Card File. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania State Archives.  Post-Civil War  During the 1890s and early 1900s, Keystone Hall on Penn Street in Reading, Berks County, Pennsylvania served as the headquarters and armory of the Pennsylvania militia unit known as the Reading Artillerists (1897, public domain). Following their honorable discharges from their respective Union Army regiments at the end of the U.S. Civil War, the Reading Artillerists returned home to Berks County. Their taste for military life soured by their long and difficult service, its members decided to disband.Montgomery, Historical Sketch, p. 19. Roughly 15 years later, civic leaders determined that the city should have a more robust defense force and, in May 1881, created an entirely new militia unit, but chose to give it an historic name. According to The Reading Eagle: > Last evening the new military company of this city held a meeting and > adopted the name of 'Reading Artillerists,' in honor of the organization of > the same name that was one of the first miitary companies in this county > after the revolution.

Reading, Pennsylvania: April 26, 1883. As membership grew, the new Reading Artillerists became a visible fixture in the community. During the summer of 1886, The Reading Eagle alerted readers to the group's plans for regular cannon training sessions: > The Reading Artillerists will have a target practice on their range at > Bernhart's Crossing, next Thursday afternoon.

In 1887, leaders of the Reading Artillerists purchased the former Metropolitan Bank building on South Sixth Street in Reading to use as their organization's headquarters and armory, and then contracted with a local architect, K. K. Moll, to make improvements to the structure, according to multiple Reading Times updates that year, including one which noted that the building would be \\"lighted by the Seibel gas enriching apparatus.\\" Reading Artillerists, in Reading Times. Reading, Pennsylvania: January 7, February 15, March 9, April 1, April 19, May 4, July 25, August 18, and September 10, 1887. The redesign and remodeling of the building was done on such a large scale, in fact, that newspapers changed their references to the building from being located \\"on South Sixth street\\" to being \\"on Penn street above Seventh.\\" Per the February 11, 1890 Reading Times, the Reading Artillerists also chose to rename the building as \\"Keystone Hall\\".Reading Artillerists, in Reading Times. Reading, Pennsylvania: February 11, 1890.  Homestead strike  Before the century was over, the Reading Artillerists were asked, once again, to become part of a joint Pennsylvania militia force. This time they were called out in response to the massive 1892 labor uprising in western Pennsylvania known as the Homestead strike (or the Pinkerton Rebellion).Montgomery, Historical Sketch, p. 19. The conflict began when the Carnegie Steel Company employed union- breaking tactics while negotiating a contract with the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers, and union leaders responded by ordering a strike at the company's Homestead steel plant near Pittsburgh.Foner, Philip. From the Founding of the A.F. of L. to th Emergence of American Imperialism, in History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 2. New York: International Publishers, 1955. The situation then deteriorated as workers at other plants also walked off their jobs in support. When violence erupted, the Reading Artillerists and other militia units were mobilized. Placed under state leadership, they quickly regained control of the plant, ended the strike, and returned home to their respective communities.The Strike at Homestead Mill.

Samuel Willits, commanding officer during the 1890s of the Reading Artillerists, a Pennsylvania militia unit based in Reading, Berks County (1896, public domain). On Monday evening, May 26, 1896, the Reading Artillerists celebrated the unit's 102nd anniversary with pomp and joy at Metropolitan Hall in Reading, Berks County. Several hundred men and women were in the audience, according to historical accounts penned that same year.Montgomery, Historical Sketch, p. 2 \\"The hall,\\" wrote Morton Montgomery, \\"was beautifully and profusely decorated with the national flag in various sizes, and knapsacks, canteens, caps, accoutrements and various military insignia were arranged against the balconies and walls in a most pleasing manner.\\" The Artillerists drilled before the crowd, which then listened to a musical program and Montgomery reading his history of the militia group. The commanding officer at the time was Captain Samuel Willits.Montgomery, Historical Sketch, p. 3.  Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War  Sometime around the mid-1890s, Captain Samuel Willits reorganized the Reading Artillerists yet again, this time preparing the men from Reading for state service as Company A of the Pennsylvania Infantry. The unit was then called up again in 1898 when President William McKinley issued his call for volunteers in the War with Spain. Arriving in Arroyo, Puerto Rico while U.S. gunboats were lobbing shells into the town, the men from Company A were assigned to outpost duty along the Patillo road. Ten days later, a peace accord was reached, and the unit was shipped home.Company A's History, in Reading Times, 1915.Montgomery, Historical Sketch, p. 19.  Early 1900s  At the turn of the century, Company A of the Pennsylvania Infantry responded once again to a citizen uprising. This time, the artillerists helped calm tensions in Pennsylvania's coal regions as miners and their families pressed mine owners for better wages and working conditions, and were called upon specifically to help bring an end to the anthracite coal miners' strike of 1902.Company A's History, in Reading Times, 1915. In 1905, H. Melvin Allen was appointed as captain of the unit. J. Lewis Lengle and Edward V. Kestner served, respectively, as his first and second lieutenants.Company A's History, in Reading Times, 1915. The organization disbanded briefly again during this era, but was reinvigorated in 1917 when two former captains ‚Äì Edward Machamer and H. Melvin Allen ‚Äì reorganized the group.The Artillerists Are Reorganizing Again: Reading's Former Crack Military Body Is to Be Active Again, in Reading Times.

In childhood her mother supported her artistic endeavors, and at the age of twelve she began lessons with Alice H. Howes, a former pupil of Frank Weston Benson and William Merritt Chase. She graduated from Smith Grammar School and Cony High School before attending Mary Colman Wheeler's school in Providence, Rhode Island, where she was especially interest in the classes on art. She studied at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re in Paris, and had lessons as well with Richard E. Miller and Eben F. Comins. She received a prize from the International Art Union in 1912. During her early career Burrage traveled extensively in Europe, and also visited the Armory Show. She returned to the United States at the outbreak of World War II, moving to Kennebunkport with her sister Madeline, known as \\"Bob\\", in 1917, and remaining there until 1947, when they moved to Wiscasset. Her style continued to develop during this time, shifting from the Impressionism of her youth to an abstraction informed by the work of Jackson Pollock; later in life she created collages from mica. Some of her work is influenced by cartography. Active as a preservationist as well as an artist, she served as a director of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and in 1954 helped to found the Lincoln County Historical Association. She was also involved in the founding of the Maine Art Gallery. Upon her death Burrage was buried with Madeline, who predeceased her, at Evergreen Cemetery in Portland. Burrage exhibited widely across the United States during her career, both alone and in group exhibitions, and her work is in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.

During spring melt Lake Ubinskoye covers a maximum area of and is deep; during periods of low water it is only deep, and in October 2013 it was estimated from aerial imagery to cover . The lake drains an area of . Lake Ubinskoye is mainly fed by melting snow and usually has no outlet, but in the spring of some years it overflows into the Ubinke River, a tributary of the Om River. Lake Ubinskoye is an oval-shaped lake with gently sloping banks. The lake bottom consists of clayey sand covered by a thick layer of gray fine-grained silt.. There are several islands in the lake, the largest of which is called Medyakovsky. The western part of the Ubinskoye basin also contains a number of other small lakes. Lake Ubinskoye freezes over from November to late May. The ice on the lake is thick. In summer the water warms up to . The temperature is uniform throughout the water column due to good mixing. The water pH is between 7.6 and 9.0. Ubinskoye is a mesotrophic lake whose plankton is dominated by green and blue- green algae. The shores of the lake are overgrown with reeds and sedges. In the mid-20th century Lake Ubinskoye was well known for its abundance of fish: bream (introduced in 1929), roach, pike, ide, carp, and peled were exploited commercially. Fish stocks crashed in the 1990s, likely due to the lowering of the water level; currently only small crucian carp remain. Attempts to restock the lake have failed, but a recent increase in water levels gives hope for future efforts. The lake and its surrounding wetlands continue to host a great variety of bird life. Lake Ubinskoye is surrounded by several villages, the largest of which is Chernyy Mys on the north shore. According to legend, Kuchum, the last Khan of Sibir, flooded his treasure in the lake while fleeing from the Russians.

In 2015, he lashed out at the impact of corruption in the province, stating that there was a breakdown of capacity due to misuse of funds for personal interests leaving poor people in poverty, with \\"airstrips, schools and health centres all [...] closed and rundown\\", while the \\"people behind the scenes\\" are \\"booking hotel rooms, travelling overseas and living in luxury\\". In facing what he termed a \\"breakdown in the system of delivering basic services in Gulf Province\\", he described his experience of trying to deliver services as \\"painful and challenging\\". In May 2016, he crossed from the government to the opposition, leaving the United Resources Party for the Papua New Guinea Party, but recontested his seat at the 2017 election for the National Alliance Party.

It was a traditional burial site of Omaha chiefs, including Blackbird\\"Nebraska National Register Sites in Thurston County.\\" Nebraska State Historical Society. Retrieved 2013-06-22. The site was visited by Lewis and Clark in 1804. It includes petroglyphs. It is on private land and is not open to the public. It was painted by George Catlin and by Karl Bodmer.  Popular culture  Blackbird Hill, particularly in Nebraska, may be associated with lost love due to it being the setting of a folktale which was popular in the early twentieth century. One account of the story was recorded in Nebraska Folklore, a pamphlet printed in 1939 as part of the Work Projects Administration's Nebraska Writers' Project. According to the 1939 story, on a fall day in the mid-eighteenth century, members of the Omaha tribe happened upon a white man wandering their territory who was \\"raving mad and nearly starved.\\" The Omaha took the man to their medicine man, who nursed the man back to health. After regaining his strength and sanity, the man decided to return to his home in the eastern United States, but first told his benefactors the story of how he had fallen into such despair. The man had been shipwrecked for five years while returning from a business venture abroad. The girl whom he had planned to marry eventually lost hope that he would ever return and instead married the man's childhood friend. When the man returned home and learned of this, he set out to find his sweetheart, whom he assumed had moved west with her new husband to California in search of gold. When he could not find her in California, he began his journey home, heartbroken. On his return voyage, he sailed down the Missouri River and one evening landed at the foot of Blackbird Hill, where he saw a trail which he followed up the hill to a cabin. He knocked on the door and, to his surprise, his sweetheart answered. The two declared their love for each other and the woman promised to leave with him the next day. The woman's husband returned shortly after and she told him she planned to leave him. The husband begged the woman to stay, but she would not. Mad with rage, the husband took his hunting knife from his pack and killed his wife, nearly decapitating her with the knife. Then the husband, upon realizing what he had done, gathered up his wife in his arms and carried her to a cliff on the hill. The husband flung both himself and his wife's body down the cliff into the waters of the Missouri. The man from the east had been nearby but could not stop the tragedy and instead was struck with shock upon witnessing the horrors and could not tell the Omaha anything that had happened between that night and the day he was rescued. The man returned home, but never forgot about the horrors he had seen on Blackbird Hill. The Omahas never forgot the story either, and it is said that in October, when the moon is full, one can still hear the screams of the woman on Blackbird Hill and that no grass grows where her blood was shed. The tale is almost certainly the invention of white authors and not a story told by the Omaha, as the Omaha would have already known the site well for being the burial place of Chief Blackbird, rather than the place where two unnamed Europeans died. There are, at least in the 1939 telling, a number of historical inaccuracies. For instance, the story claims that the man found wandering the area was taken to the tribe's medicine man and placed in his wigwam. The Omaha built permanent settlements out of earth lodges and temporary housing in the form of tipis, but wigwams were not a customary form of housing for the Omaha. Furthermore, the author alleges the story took place in the mid-eighteenth century, which would place the events around 1750. In the 1750, Chief Blackbird had not yet died and been buried on Blackbird Hill. The United States was not a sovereign nation in this time period, and even after the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, there was not contact between citizens of the United States and the Omaha tribe in the 1700s. While other Europeans, such as the French and Spanish, had been in contact with the Omaha since at least 1700, the American citizens did not interact with the Omaha tribe until the Corps of Discovery in 1804. The author may have confused the term eighteenth century to mean the 1800s, which is likely given that the story claims that the man went looking for his lover in California because he believed she had gone there following a gold rush, which likely refers to the 1849 California Gold Rush.

Biography  Louis Bobozo was born in 1915 in the Mongala District, √âquateur, Belgian Congo. He voluntarily enlisted in the Force Publique on 28 June 1933. On 1 April 1940 he was promoted to the rank of sergeant. In 1941 he was deployed to Ethiopia to participate in the East African Campaign of World War II, commanding a machine gun platoon during the Siege of Sa√Øo. From 1953‚Äì1954 he served as drill instructor to the young Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu in Luluabourg and became his mentor. He was one of the few Congolese soldiers in the entire army to achieve the rank of adjutant before the independence of the Congo in 1960. Following independence, the Force Publique mutinied to protest poor conditions. African officers were appointed to replace European personnel to alleviate the problem, and Mobutu was made chief-of-staff of the force, renamed the Arm√©e Nationale Congolaise (ANC). Due to the upheaval in the officer corps and his family ties with Mobutu, Bobozo was quickly promoted to colonel and put in charge of the garrison of Camp Hardy in Thysville. He briefly acted as interim commander-in- chief of the army in October. In 1963 he was put in charge of a new unit, the fourth groupement (regiment) of South Katanga. On 30 May 1964 he led a small government force to recapture the town of Albertville from Simba rebels. In July 1964 he was promoted to the rank of major general. Following Mobutu's coup in November 1965, Bobozo was appointed commander-in-chief of the ANC. On 13 November 1970 he suffered a severe stroke and had to relinquish his duties to an acting general. He officially retired as commander-in-chief in 1972. He died in July 1982.

The term circannual is Latin, circa meaning approximately and annual relating to one year. Chronobiology is the field of biology pertaining to periodic rhythms that occur in living organisms in response to external stimuli such as photoperiod. The location of the physical circannual timer in organisms and how it works are almost entirely unknown.  Examples  In one study performed by Eberhard Gwinner, two species of birds were born in a controlled environment without ever being exposed to external stimuli. They were presented with a fixed Photoperiod of 10 hours of light and 14 hours of darkness each day. The birds were exposed to these conditions for eight years and consistently molted at the same time as they would have in the wild, indicating that this physiological cycle is innate rather than governed environmentally. Researchers Ted Pengelley and Ken Fisher studied the circannual clock in the golden-mantled ground squirrel. They exposed the squirrels to twelve hours of light and 12 hours of darkness and at a constant temperature for three years. Despite this constant cycle, they continued to hibernate once a year with each episode preceded by an increase in body weight and food consumption. During the first year, the squirrels began hibernation in late October. They started hibernating in mid August and early April respectively for the following two years, displaying a circannual rhythm with a period of about 10 months.Foster RG, Kreitzman L. Seasons of life: The biological rhythms that enable living things to thrive and survive 1-303. New Haven (Connecticut): Yale University Press. . 2009. A classic example in insects is the varied carpet beetle.  Biological advantages  Generating biological rhythms internally helps organisms anticipate important changes in the environment before they occur, thus providing the organisms with time to prepare and survive. For example, some plants have a very strict time frame in regards to blooming and preparing for spring. If they begin their preparations too early or too late they risk not being pollinated, competing with different species, or other factors that might affect their survival rate. Having a circannual cycle may keep them from making this mistake if a particular geographic region experiences a false spring, where the weather becomes exceptionally warm early for a short period of time before returning to winter temperatures. Similarly, bird plumage and mammal fur change with the approach of winter, and is triggered by the shortening photoperiod of autumn. The circannual cycle can also be useful for animals that Migrate or Hibernate. Many animals' reproductive organs change in response to changes in photoperiod. Male gonads will grow during the onset of spring to promote reproduction among the species. These enlarged gonads would be nearly impossible to keep year round and would be inefficient for the species. Many female animals will only produce eggs during certain times of the year.  Interaction with changing climate  Changing climate may unravel ecosystems in which different organisms use different internal calendars. Warming temperatures may lead to earlier blooms of flora in spring. For instance, one study performed by Menzel et al., analyzed 125,000 phenological records of 542 plant species in 21 European countries from 1971 to 2000 and found that 78% of all plants studied advanced in flowering, leafing, and fruiting while only three percent were significantly delayed. They determined that the average advance of spring and summer was 2.5 days per decade in Europe. Meanwhile, fauna may breed or migrate based on the length of day, and thus might arrive too late for critical food supplies they co-evolved with. For example, the Parus major closely times the hatching of their chicks to the emergence of the protein-rich winter moth caterpillar, which in turn hatches to meet the budding of oaks. These birds are a single-brood bird, meaning they breed once a year with about nine chicks per brood. If the birds and caterpillars and buds all emerge at the right time, the caterpillars eat the new oak leaves and their population increases dramatically, and this hopefully will coincide with the arrival of the new chicks, allowing them to eat. But if plants, insects, and birds respond differently to the advance of spring or other phenology changes, the relationship may be altered. As another example, studies of the Pied Flycatcher (ficedula hypoleuca) have shown that their spring migration timing is triggered by an internal circannual clock that is fine tuned to day length. These particular birds overwinter in dry tropical forest in Western Africa and breed in temperate forests in Europe, over 4,500 km away. From 1980-2000, temperatures at the time of arrival and the start of breeding have warmed significantly. They have advanced their mean laying date by ten days, but have not advanced the spring arrival on their breeding grounds because their migration behavior is triggered by photoperiod rather than temperature. In short, even if each individual species can easily live with elevated temperatures, disruptions of phenology timing at ecosystem level may still imperil them.  Challenges for scientific study  One reason for the paucity of research on circannual cycles is the duration of required efforts. The ratio of the period length of a circannual cycle to the length of the productive life of a scientist makes this branch of chronobiology difficult. It takes an entire year to get a time series which makes it difficult to see how these cycles adjust over the years. To put this into perspective, a two- week experiment for a circadian biologist would take fourteen years for a circannual researcher, in order to achieve the same level of data robustness for the conclusions.

He reaches a cabin and sends his daughter Lucy away with the \\"Once Upon A Time\\" storybook, telling her to keep it safe as he fights off the creature. In Storybrooke, the Enchanted Forest and other realms during Fiona‚Äôs Curse It has been hours after Fiona enacted her curse on the entire town that engulfed everyone after the wedding. However, Henry, who is spared, thanks to being the Author and having the Heart of the Truest Believer, wakes up with the Storybook in his hands, and starts searching for his family. After running into Archie, he tells Henry that Emma is at the hospital, where she has been committed to a psychiatric ward for the past two years. While visiting Emma, he learns that with Fiona's Curse, Regina's original curse was never broken, and Emma had stopped believing him. He asks her where Snow, Hook and David are, but the new Curse now has Emma believing that these events never happened, citing that she has made so much progress and can't go back, then tells Henry to stop telling her about these stories. Suddenly Fiona (who is now the Mayor and Henry's mother) arrives and takes the book from Henry, but before he leaves he whispers in Emma's ear to tell her to resist, as the Final Battle is coming. At the same time in the Enchanted Forest, Snow, David, Hook and Regina wake up and discover they have returned to the place where the events that lead to the First Curse began. They discover it is a prison for them and is tied to the book. Fiona, who is using this to banish Emma's family forever, tells Emma that she must burn the storybook if she wants to be released from the hospital, but Emma refuses, as she doesn't want to break Henry's heart. Back in the Enchanted Forest, everyone realizes that the Final Battle will begin over Emma's soul and belief. Fiona is trying to get Emma to stop believing so the realm of stories will be consumed by the Darkness and cease to exist. It is later revealed that as each realm is destroyed, the Darkness grows stronger, and so does Fiona, while Light Magic weakens across the remaining cursed realms. When Zelena shows up with the Mad Hatter hat, they transport to a portal of doors, where Zelena's realm (Oz) has disappeared. If Fiona succeeds, she can make Emma destroy all the realms, prompting them to come up with a plan to save Emma. At the same time in Storybrooke, Fiona brings lunch to Gold and asks that he fix her watch, as it appears that she is now the primary support in the wake of Belle's \\"disappearance.\\" It appears that Emma is starting to lose her faith, as the realms start to be consumed by the Darkness, forcing everyone and all the survivors from the other realms to take shelter in the Evil Queen's Castle, including Aladdin and Jasmine after Agrabah was consumed. Outside, Hook and David climb the magic beanstalk, in hopes of finding a magic bean that will get everyone back to Storybrooke. At the same time, Henry breaks Emma out of the hospital and takes his mother to the rooftop where she was married, in hopes that she will remember her wedding to Killian. She has glimpses of her memories, but Emma has doubts and tells Henry that she wants to return to Boston, for fear that Fiona will put her back in the psychiatric ward. Henry decides to help her. Meanwhile, Gideon is extremely upset with Belle \\"deserting\\" him and now sees Fiona as more of a mother than Belle, and Gold's attempts to console his son don't help either. When Gold searches through his belongings, he also discovers that most of his magic potions had been removed by Fiona's Curse. Back in the Enchanted Forest, Regina and Zelena try to work on a potion but most of her ingredients have been removed by Fiona's Curse, when The Evil Queen arrives and offers to help. In Storybrooke, hours later, Henry attempts to steal the Storybook back from Fiona but she catches him, and believes that she can use him to control Emma. As Henry escapes, Fiona uses her magic to push him down the stairs. Moments later, Gold asks Fiona to reopen the investigation into Belle's disappearance. As Fiona tries to talk him out of it, she shows him pictures of Belle enjoying life in other countries, and wants Gold to move on from Belle. Back in the Enchanted Forest, Hook and David began their search for the magic beans and Hook finds one, only to encounter a dragon. The creature chases them down the beanstalk after they take the bean. At the hospital, Henry wakes up and discovers that Fiona is manipulating Emma during their visit. Afterwards, Fiona finally succeeds in convincing Emma to burn the storybook in the furnace as Fiona tells Emma it's the only way to keep Henry safe and to end the delusions. Thanks to Fiona's scheme, most of the realms depicted in the book are consumed by Darkness (at least 17 realms), and the Darkness arrives on the outskirts of the Enchanted Forest, in the form of a massive storm of Dark Magic. However, as the book is burning, the pages flip to a picture of Hook, and Emma stares at his image as the flames consume the page. =Part 2= =In Enchanted Forest (in the Future)= Many years in the future, the young girl returns to her home and discovers everything destroyed. However, Tiger Lily shows up and tells her to take the book to her mother, telling her that the fairies foresaw that she will be reunited with her father and to never give up on the lesson the book gives, to never lose hope. =In Storybrooke= Back in Storybrooke, Fiona, convinced that she has succeeded, brings what was left of the book to Henry and gloats that Emma has lost her faith, though Henry refuses to accept this. Emma leaves Storybrooke to return to Boston. When she gets home, she discovers that Henry left her a hand-drawn storybook in order to make her remember their past. Meanwhile, as the realms are starting to collapse, and the Darkness approaches, David and Hook escape the dragon, but while climbing down the beanstalk, they lose their balance and fall. Regina and the Evil Queen discover that the bean had withered and lost its magic, because Fiona's Curse has caused Emma's lack of faith to drain the magic from the realm. Snow finds Hook alright, and she tells him to take the bean to the castle without her. When Snow finds an unconscious David, she kisses him and when he wakes, he tells her that Darkness never wins. As they rush to the castle, the storm of Dark Magic accelerates towards them. In Storybrooke, Henry goes to the pawnshop and meets with Gold who attempts to feign ignorance of the Curse. However, Henry goes to the back and uncovers Gold's potions, proving that Gold remembers his past. Gold acknowledges Henry's cleverness, but also refuses to help Henry as his primary concern is finding Belle. Henry decides that he should take on Fiona himself, and Gold heals his injuries and allows him to take an enchanted sword, from the shop. Back in the Enchanted Forest, the Darkness has arrived at the castle, the Evil Queen decides to sacrifice herself and use all of her magic to protect the castle, in order to buy enough time for Regina to restore the bean with her magic, while everyone else gathers together in the courtyard. However, Regina fails to restore the bean in time, and the Darkness bursts into the castle, surrounding them, while slowly closing in. They realize that Henry is their only hope, since Regina can't restore the bean before they are all consumed. When Henry arrives at the Mayor's office with the sword, Emma arrives. She tells Henry that while she doesn't remember being who Henry tells her she is, but she does believe that she can be that person with his help. Her renewed belief stops the destruction of the Enchanted Forest just in time to save the others. The Darkness pulls back, revealing that everything in the Enchanted Forest Realm had been consumed, except for a small column of land that the group stands on. At the same time, Gold uses a tracking spell on \\"Her Handsome Hero\\" to find Belle, who was hiding from Fiona, and she hides from Gold as well, having been turned into a coward by Fiona's Curse. Gold tells her about Fiona's deception, and vows revenge on Fiona for what she had done to Belle. Fiona stops by the pawn shop to see Gideon, now that Emma has regained her memories, where it turns out that Fiona had reclaimed Gideon's heart with the Curse. Then, she uses him to recover her own wand, which she uses to decipher the mysterious writings that Henry had scribbled in the page. Fiona then reads the inscriptions, which details the birth of Light and Darkness, their battle throughout the ages waged via their emissaries, the deaths of the previous Saviors and their enemies at each other's hands, and how the Final Battle will begin after the Emma's birth. After Gideon leaves to find Emma, Gold arrives in the shop, but Fiona fails to trick Gold into thinking that she had only come for her watch. When Gold confronts Fiona about her plans, she tells her son that once the Final Battle is over, the Curse will be lifted and they can be a family again. She also tells Gold that after she destroys all Light Magic, she will have so much power that she will be able to break the Laws of Magic at will, and she will even be able to bring back the dead. She tells him that she can bring back his first-born son, Baelfire, for him. She goes on to say that with her new powers, she will be able to make his family love him as the Dark One, so that he can keep his power and be loved at the same time. However, Gold knows that is will come with a steep price and tells her that he refuses to pay the price of magic anymore, and he slips Fiona's wand into his hand. He forces her onto the ground with magic, vowing to make her pay for what she did to Belle and Gideon. Fiona tells Gold that she had deciphered Henry's writing. She learned that Darkness cannot destroy Light, since Darkness isn't strong enough. However, Light can destroy Light. She explains she gave Gideon one final command; to kill Emma, and that even if she dies, Gideon will still be forced to carry out her command. Gold decides to test this and kills Fiona with her own wand, breaking the Dark Curse. This causes Snow, David, Regina, Hook, and Zelena to be transported back to Storybrooke from the Enchanted Forest, while Emma and the other residents of Storybrooke regain their memories. Soon afterward, Belle returns to Gold and comforts him over his actions, while Gideon arrives at the Mayor's Office with the sword Hrunting in his hand. As expected, Gideon confronts Emma, and is ready to face off against her. Both Gold and Belle set off to search for Gideon's heart. Henry helps Emma escape from Gideon (knocking him out with a fire extinguisher) with Emma placing a protection spell to contain him temporarily. The others realize that Fiona has crafted the perfect trap: If Gideon kills Emma, Light will be destroyed. And if Emma kills Gideon, she will turn dark and Light will still be destroyed. Regina consoles Emma and encourages her to find another way like she always does. Emma attempts to hold off Gideon as Gold finds Gideon's heart. When Gold finds Gideon's heart he is tempted by a manifestation of the Darkness, which takes the form of his Enchanted Forest counterpart, Rumplestiltskin. The Dark One manifestation tells him to let Gideon kill Emma so he can finally have it all: power and love. The manifestation reminds Gold of what Fiona told him, that if Emma dies, his Dark Magic will increase exponentially. After it's all over, he can spend all the time he wants exploring the world with Belle, before spending the next 100 years destroying it. Gold resists the temptation and chooses to do the right thing and tries to use Gideon's heart to stop him from killing Emma. However Fiona's spell keeps him from being able to free Gideon, and instead, Gideon's heart stops beating and dims. The manifestation taunts Gold before disappearing, and Gold heads out to Belle, who consoles him for trying to do the right thing. Back at the intersection, Emma and Gideon fight with Emma acknowledging her role as the Savior to protect those she loves, protect the innocent and to spread light and hope no matter what the cost. Realizing what she must do, Emma throws down her sword and Gideon apologizes and kills her, releasing an enormous blast of light magic, ending the Final Battle and causing Gideon to disappear. As everyone gathers around Emma's body Henry, using true love's kiss, brings her back to life. Gold and Belle discover to their shock that Gideon is once again a baby with his heart restored into his body. Realizing that this is a new start as a family, Belle tells Gold that this is their happy beginning. Snow then sees the \\"Once Upon a Time\\" storybook reappear. Henry looks at the final page of the storybook which suddenly writes itself with the words \\"When both good and evil did the right thing, faith was restored and the final battle was won.\\" Snow reminds everyone that the story isn't over. The Enchanted Forest, Neverland, Wonderland, Agrabah, Arendelle, the Land of Oz and all the other realms are restored and their residents obtain their happy beginnings, as does everyone in Storybrooke. Emma and Hook patrol as the town Sheriffs, Henry goes to school, Regina returns to her role as Mayor when dwarfs gave her title \\"queen\\" without \\"evil\\", David farms with a growing Neal, Zelena spends time with baby Robin, Gold and Belle renew their relationship and raise their son together, Snow White becomes a teacher again and Robin Hood from the Wish Realm proposes to the Evil Queen in Regina's restored palace.

The second selected woman is then asked to join the other finalist on the gold podiums. The contestants, guests and host frequently exchange banter with each other when video clips aren't being shown. If a girl in the favourites group doesn‚Äôt like the man, she will turn her light off (followed by a sound cue). The girls in the observation group may use their thermometers to measure their interest in the single man. If, after both videos have been played, if there is still at least one girl from the favourites group still with lights on, the man can elect to either swap one of the finalists for one of the girls from the favourites group with her light still on or to keep the initially selected girls on the gold podiums as finalists. The man puts to the finalists a question that he chooses from a set menu of queries, followed by putting forward a question of his own. If the single man had chosen to keep the initial two finalists selected during the final questions round, the host asks the single man to choose a preferred finalist to take. This is followed by the host revealing separately whether the finalists had kept their light on for the single man during the round. If his preferred girl from the final two had kept her light on, the single man leaves with the girl. If his preferred girl had turned off her light, the man leaves the stage alone. If the single man had chosen to swap out one of the finalists out for one of the girls that had kept their light on in the favourites section during the round and decides to choose the woman that was swapped into the finalists podiums after the final question round, he is able to walk to her, take her hand and leave together for a presumed future date. If all the girls in the favourites group had turned their lights off at the end of the round, the host bypasses the question round and goes directly to the finalists decision by revealing to the single man whether if both finalists had kept their light on during the round. If it is revealed that one or both finalists had kept their light on for the man, it is up to the man to choose whether to leave with one of the finalists. If it has been revealed that both finalists had their lights off, the man leaves the stage alone. Occasionally, a man elects to choose none of the finalists and departs alone. The post-game interview appears with the man alone, or with him and his chosen girl if he is \\"successful\\". Matched couples are also awarded a cruise to Japan. Songs featured on the show The song as the male contestant walks through the backstage tunnel is an advertising jingle for show sponsor Pinduoduo. The song when a girl makes her entrance whilst the male is selecting his groups is Martin Jensen's \\"Solo Dance\\". The introduction song when a male contestant enters the stage is Jean-Roch's \\"I see your light\\". When the finalists are selected, the song New Thang by Redfoo plays. If the male contestant leaves without a date, Yoga Lin's (ÊûóÂÆ•Âòâ) \\"Back\\" (ËÉåÂΩ±) plays. A matched couple leaves to the tune of \\"A bit sweet\\" (ÊúâÈªûÁîú) by By2 featuring Wang Su Long (Ê±™ËãèÊ≥∑).

He is known for his weekly magazines containing fiction and gossip aimed at a working-class audience, which he ran while also cultivating upmarket readers with monthly publications. Life Maxwell was from Ulster, an orphan from a Limerick family, and came to London around 1842, attempting to have Gerald Griffin's poetry published. In the 1850s he was in business in London, selling newspapers and advertising space in them. From 1858 Maxwell founded a series of newspapers, beginning that year with Town Talk which lasted for 18 months, followed by The Welcome Guest from 1859, bought from Henry Vizetelly and loss-making as a 1d. weekly but relaunched as Robin Goodfellow at 2d. Temple Bar from the end of 1860 was a successful monthly but Maxwell, in partnership by then with Robert Maxwell, lost control of it. He survived a financial crisis in 1862, supported by the earnings of the author Mary Elizabeth Braddon, with whom he was living. Maxwell continued as a publisher, in particular of reprint fiction. Maxwell also developed property in Richmond, where he and Braddon lived at Lichfield House. Two nearby streets that he developed are named after characters in Braddon's novels. Audley Road, which Maxwell developed in the 1880s, was named after Braddon's novel Lady Audley's Secret. Marchmont Road is named after her novel John Marchmont's Legacy. The Streets of Richmond and Kew (Third edition, 2019), pp. 17 and 77. Richmond Local History Society. . Family Maxwell married twice. With his first wife, Mary Anne Crowley, whom he married in 1848, he had at least five surviving children. She was later confined to a lunatic asylum, after the birth of their seventh child, dying in 1874. He then married Mary Elizabeth Braddon. The actor Gerald Melbourne Maxwell, author W. B. Maxwell and barrister Edward Henry Harrington Maxwell were her sons.

The church was built by the Dutch in 1706 and was one of the oldest Protestant churches in the country. History Kruys Kerk (Cross Church) constructed in the form of a Greek cross, in the south-eastern section of Jaffna fort. The church was erected in 1706, nearly half a century prior to the construction of the Wolvendaal Church in Colombo and the Groote Kerk in Galle, during the administration of Adam van der Duyn, the Commandeur of Jaffnapatnam. The architect and builder was Martinus Leusekam, who is described as a Baas Landmeter (Chief Surveyor) and the resident Predikant was Philippus de Vries. In September 1795 Jaffna fell to British forces. The church was then used as place of worship by the British garrison. The church gradually lost its congregation and in 1872 when the British began using their own church in the centre of Jaffna ( away), it was abandoned. When the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam occupied the fort during the Sri Lankan Civil War the church, along with a number of other key buildings, were demolished in an attempt to stop the Sri Lankan Army gaining control of the site. Currently only the remains of the walls remain. Fortunately a number of the historic tombstones were rescued and are currently housed at the church in Batticaloa for safekeeping. Architecture The Kruys Church within Jaffna fort. Drawing of the interior of the church. The church was in the form of a Greek Cross, with arms of equal length and a wide central area. The walls were four to five feet thick, built out of rubble and coral stone, with a covering of cement. The pillars, arches and pediments of the doorways were built with imported Dutch bricks. The floor was paved with stones in area, with a number of tombstones, dating from 1660, suggesting that they contained re-interred ashes or remains. The ends of the church's naves were gabled. The windows contained multiple panes and were heavily mullioned. The church could accommodate up to 600 worshippers.

This proved to be pivotal in his choice of Jazz as the major musical force in his life. He played in a U.S. Navy band while stationed in Puerto Rico from 1951 to 1953 and it was there that he met Bill Evans. After military duty, Jack received a four year scholarship to the Manhattan School of Music majoring in piano and composition.

John LaPorta hired Jack to perform at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1958, the year he graduated from MSM. The critics gave high praise for the quartets performance and raves for Reilly's playing. During this time he also worked with Warren Covington, George Russell, Lennie Tristano, and Jerry Wald. He moved to California briefly in the mid-1960s to study Indian classical music with Ali Akbar Khan, and returned to Manhattan where he composed the large-scale piece Requiem Mass for Chorus and Jazz Quartet.

His Panth√©on Musical was one of the most famous and widely reproduced musical caricatures of the 19th century. His younger brother was the painter and illustrator √âdouard Travi√®s.Bellier de La Chavignerie, √âmile and Auvray, Louis (1885).

Donizetti and the World of Opera in Italy, Paris, and Vienna in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century, p. 205. Octagon Books (reprint). Life and career Travi√®s was born in W√ºlflingen (now a district in the Swiss city of Winterthur) although he later became a naturalised French citizen. His father was an engraver of English descent. His mother was from a French family and a descendant of the Marquis de Villers. He studied art in Strasbourg and later under Fran√ßois Joseph Heim at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. When he was a young man, a series of financial misfortunes left his parents in poverty, and he became their sole support. He began his career producing portraits and genre paintings and made his debut at the Paris Salon in 1823. He also turned his hand to producing designs for wallpaper and printed fabrics. Lithograph/Cartoon: principal composers of 1843 - \\"Panth√©on Musical\\", by J. Travi√®s By the late 1820s he had become a popular caricaturist enjoying particular success with his collections Tableau de Paris and Galerie des √âpicuriens. He then joined Charles Philipon's satirical magazines La Caricature and La Charivari where he was to become one of their most prolific caricaturists.De Ruvo, Francesca and Mazzaro, Alessandramonica (2016). Un secolo di satira, pp. 130‚Äì133. Universit√† degli Studi Suor Orsola Benincasa. Vapereau, Gustave (1870). \\"Travi√®s de Villers (Charles-Joseph)\\". Dictionnaire universel des contemporains, Vol. 2, p. 1682. Hachette et Cie Both magazines were highly critical of the July Monarchy and its king, Louis Philippe, whom they mercilessly caricatured. His most famous creation during this period was the character \\"Mayeaux\\" (sometimes spelled \\"Mahieux\\") a hunchback who came to represent all the faults and foibles of the bourgeoisie who were the principle supporters of Louis Philippe. The character, which first appeared in the pages of La Caricature in 1831, was the inspiration for several other satirists including Daumier, Grandville, and Honor√© de Balzac. Using pseudonyms, Balzac wrote two articles on Mayeux's adventures for La Caricature‚Äî\\"M. Mahieux en soci√©t√©\\" and \\"M. Mahieux au bal de l'Op√©ra\\". The hunchback character \\"Mayeux\\" ridicules Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans, exclaiming, \\"Dieu de Dieu! mon prince, vous perdez vos mollets.\\" (Good God! my prince you are losing your calves). Published in La Caricature. 5 March 1835. During this time Travi√®s also became involved in early socialist movements, an interest which he maintained throughout his life. He was first attracted to Saint-Simonianism and then to the ideas of Simon Ganneau, becoming a follower of Ganneau's sect Evadisme which focused heavily on equality of the sexes. In his later years he would become increasingly attracted to the utopian socialism of Charles Fourier and Fourier's disciple Jean Journet. He also carried out lengthy correspondence with Flora Tristan and Fran√ßois Ponsard, a poet and playwright of socialist leanings.Kerr, David S. (2000). Caricature and French Political Culture 1830-1848, p. 40. Clarendon Press. Following the assassination attempt on Louis Philippe in July 1835, a law was passed on 9 September 1835 forbidding political caricatures and articles critical of the king. In light of the subsequent fines and imprisonments imposed on the press for violations of this law, Travi√®s, like many of his colleagues, turned his attention to satirizing French customs and culture. He also provided illustrations for Balzac's La Com√©die humaine and Eug√®ne Sue's Les Myst√®res de Paris as well as producing many depictions of the Parisian poor and their daily life.Deberle, Alfred (15 September 1859). \\"C.

Baudelaire, who was an admirer of his work, including these later pieces, wrote of Travi√®s: > He is the prince of the unfortunate. His muse is a nymph of the suburbs, > pale and melancholy. [...] Travi√®s has a deep feeling for the joys and > sorrows of the common people. He knows the scoundrel thoroughly, and he > loves him with tender charity. For this reason his Sc√®nes Bachiques will > remain a remarkable work.Baudelaire, Charles (1 October 1857). \\"Quelques > caricaturistes fran√ßais\\". Le Pr√©sent, pp. 93‚Äì95 When Baudelaire wrote these words in 1857 he observed that Travi√®s had been inexplicably \\"missing from the scene\\" for quite a while. After 1845 Travi√®s had worked more and more sporadically. The last fourteen years of his life were marked by depression and illness. However, he exhibited portraits in the 1848 and 1855 Paris Salons and finally managed to complete his religious painting Christ et la Samaritaine which was exhibited in the 1853 Salon and bought by the French government. He died in his Paris apartment on 13 August 1859 at the age of 55. According to contemporary obituaries, he died in poverty lying on a straw bed.\\"A.

The British North Borneo Herald (BNBH) was a periodical magazine in British North Borneo, published between 1883 until 1941 by the government of North Borneo under various official names.  History  After the entry into force of the Royal Charter for the North Borneo Chartered Company on 1 November 1881, the company faced with the task of creating a functioning governmental structure for the acquired territory. The resolutions passed by the Court of Directors, the highest administrative body of the company in London, required efficient distribution within the administrative units in North Borneo as well as among the shareholders and investors of the company. For this reason, the first sixteen-page edition of the periodical \\"The North Borneo Herald and Official Gazette\\" appeared on 1 March 1883, in Kudat, the first capital of North Borneo. For the monthly publication of the newspaper and the printing in the Dent Road no. 1, Thomas J. Keaughran, a former reporter of The Straits Times was responsible. The single price was 10 cents, while the annual subscription was 1.50 Straits dollar. In 1883, Sandakan was raised as the new capital instead of Kudat, and this herald moved their place of publication to the new administration area. The editorial and printing from 1885 to 1891 were by W. J. Rozario. From 1 January 1896, the herald turned into a four-day appearance. The price per issue was still 10 cent, while the annual subscription including postal delivery increased to 2.50 Straits dollar. The last edition appeared in 1941. Following the Japanese occupation in January 1942, especially when the Japanese marched into the town of Sandakan on 19 January; the journalistic activities were forbidden with immediate effect. The end of the operation under the North Borneo Chartered Company on 26 June 1946 also sealed the fate of the Herald, while the Official Gazette continued to exist as a memorandum of the British colonial government until 1963.  Name changes  Title graphic from 1 January 1892. The 'Herald', title graphic from 1 January 1896 after conversion to 14-daily appearance. Extract from the title page of the British North Borneo Official Gazette of 16 April 1902. Although the herald is usually quoted as British North Borneo Herald, its official name has undergone several minor changes: * British North Borneo Herald and Monthly Record (1 January 1892) * The British North Borneo Herald And Fortnightly Record (1 January 1896) * British North Borneo Herald and Official Gazette  Outsourcing of legal texts  In accordance with the intention of a governmental news organisation, legislative texts and ordinances had been part of the herald from the very beginning. Even in the edition of the herald on 1 April 1885, these were printed in a separate section of the \\"Gazette\\". A section \\"Official Gazette\\" was established for the editions from 1 May 1885 to 1891. After that, the British North Borneo Official Gazette was continued as an independent governmental advisor.  Political orientation  As a governmental report, the herald was not a neutral source as it did not publish any information that was detrimental to the image of the North Borneo government (in the form of the Court of London) or to the share price of the North Borneo Chartered Company. In none of these accounts are there any comments on the trench battles between William Clark Cowie and the highly popular Governors Hugh Charles Clifford and Ernest Woodford Birch, who led in both cases the resignation of the governor. Also the inadequacies of the North Borneo Railway, the catastrophic misjudgment regarding the manganese deposits at Marudu Bay in 1907 and the big fire, which destroyed the sawmill of British Borneo Timber in 1934, were not mentioned.  Used as a reference  Herald's archival editions are now available in various libraries in Asia and Europe. Among the periodicals, the herald, together with The Straits Times and The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884‚Äì1942) is the most important source of knowledge for the history research on North Borneo and the North Borneo Chartered Company. Comprehensive original editions of the herald are in the Sabah State Archives, The National Archives, Kew and the Singapore National Library.

The purpose of the band was to financially support the school, which educated the poor and orphaned Black children in that state. But in 1941, the Sweethearts severed their ties with the Piney Woods Country Life School, moved to Virginia and recruited seasoned professionals to join their band, including Ernestine \\"Tiny\\" Davis. The Sweethearts were unique for the time as all-female and racially integrated group, featuring Latina, Asian, Caucasian, Black, Native American and Puerto Rican players. Tiny played and toured with the International Sweethearts of Rhythm until 1947, including on USO tours during World War II and in the film How About That Jive. The International Sweethearts of Rhythm also played the Apollo Theater in New York, the Regal Theater in Chicago, and the Howard Theater in Washington, D. C., where their debut set a box office record of 35,000 patrons in one week. In the 40s, Louis Armstrong and Cab Calloway, among others, came and stood in the wings to listen to her. Later, her all- female band played opposite Armstrong and Fletcher Henderson and jammed with many jazz greats. \\"I could have played with Count Basie, Cab Calloway--the greatest,\\" Tiny said. \\"But I loved them gals too much. They were some sweet gals.\\" After the Sweethearts disbanded in 1949, she formed her own all-female band from some erstwhile members of the Prairie View Co-eds, which she called the Hell Divers. On June 25, 1950, Tiny Davis and Her Hell Divers performed at the sixth famed Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles which was produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. Also featured on the same day were Lionel Hampton, PeeWee Crayton's Orchestra, Roy Milton and his Orchestra, Dinah Washington, and other artists. 16,000 were reported to be in attendance. Tiny Davis and her Hell Divers ensemble recorded for Decca Records and toured through 1952, including in the Caribbean and Central America. Among her sidewomen in the Hell Divers was bassist Ruby Lucas, who became Davis's life partner. They opened a club together in Chicago called Tiny and Ruby's Gay Spot in the late 40s, which they ran through the 1950‚Äôs. Tiny and Ruby were together 40-some years, until Tiny‚Äôs death. Tiny was active in performance into the 1980s, and died in Chicago in 1994. Filmography Davis was featured in two independent short documentary films produced and directed by Greta Schiller and Andrea Weiss. International Sweethearts of Rhythm: America's Hottest All-Girl Band (1986) presented a history of the first racially integrated all-female jazz band in the United States. Davis was one of six surviving band members interviewed in the film. In 1988, she was the co-featured artist in the documentary Tiny & Ruby: Hell Divin' Women that focused primarily on Davis' career after leaving the Sweethearts, as well as her more than 40 year relationship with Ruby Lucas. Tiny & Ruby had its premiere at the 1988 Chicago Lesbian and Gay International Film Festival, with Chicago residents Davis and Lucas in attendance.

It promotes nature conservation and an ecologically resilient society, and undertakes programmes for school students. ASED has worked with over 200 schools across the country. It has three flagship programmes, the \\"Green Rhinos\\" programme, \\"Nature Smart\\" and \\"Nature Club\\". These programmes are conducted under the guidance of the Chief Executive Officer, Diti Mookherjee, a Fulbright-Nehru Fellow for Environmental Leadership.  History  Founded by Diti Mookherjee and Rekha Basu on 7 September 2001, the Association for Social and Environmental Development (ASED) was established in order to actively engage youth in nature conservation in a sustained manner.http://india.ashoka.org/how-does-green- rhinos-program-intend-create-youth-nature-leaders  Programmes  = Green Rhinos = Launched in April 2012, the Green Rhinos programmehttps://medium.com/green-rhinos envisions the existence of an Earth in which the youth, acting as a community, adopts a lifestyle which is ecologically resilient in nature. The programme hopes to fulfil the above objective through the creation of youth nature leaders involved in nature conversation through a transformational leadership process. The success of various biodiversity-related projects conducted by the Association for Social and Environmental Development extending from 2004-2010 convinced the Chief Executive Officer of the organisation, Diti Mookherjee, to initiate a structured programme which would involve the active participation of students to develop their own projects relating to conservation. Thus, supported by the Rufford Foundation,http://www.rufford.org/http://www.rufford.org/projects/diti_mookherjee_0http://www.rufford.org/rsg/Projects/DitiMookherjee the Green Rhinos programme was established in several schools in the Sundarbans in 2012 after which it was extended to Kolkata, Delhi, Orissa, and Hisar as well to include a total of 17 schools. Methodology Summary Diagram FINAL-page-001 The methodology *http://india.ashoka.org/how-does-green-rhinos- program-intend-create-youth-nature-leaders of the programme involves the formation of a Green Rhinos team comprising fifty ‚Äònature smart‚Äô middle school students and two mentors. After nature orientation, seminars, audio-visual presentations, discussions and interactive games, the students are provided with the necessary tools required to create school-based projects which are to be executed in six months. The ASED team helps them to gain access to resources during the stipulated period and once the ten-month program cycle is completed, a ‚Äòsharing workshop‚Äô is held and the Green Rhinos receive a badge and certificate. The efforts of the organisation have resulted in the creation of over 3500 Green Rhinos who have successfully conducted various projects such as raising two thousand saplings and planting and nurturing as many as twenty thousand trees in the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve and creating a butterfly garden within the Maheshtala Girls High School campus.https://www.facebook.com/GreenRhinos/  References  Category:Non- profit organisations based in India Category:Companies based in Kolkata Category:Indian companies established in 2002 Category:Nature conservation organisations based in India ","title":"Association for Social and Environmental Development"},{"id":"54047728","text":"Live in Hollywood, is a live album by saxophonist Warne Marsh recorded in 1952 and originally released on the Xanadu label in 1979.Jazzlists: Xanadu Records LP discography accessed May 12, 2017Godwin, M.

The \\"International Alpine Trial\\" was not the only sporting event that failed to take place in 1930. * The 1935 event was cancelled because of the rapidly deteriorating political situation, notably between France and Italy.

If the contamination was serious, the decontamination team would have been wearing hazmat gear Hazmat diving is underwater diving in a known hazardous materials environment. The environment may be contaminated by hazardous materials, the diving medium may be inherently a hazardous material, or the environment in which the diving medium is situated may include hazardous materials with a significant risk of exposure to these materials to members of the diving team. Special precautions, equipment and procedures are associated with hazmat diving. Scope Hazmat diving describes diving operations which involve risk of exposure to hazardous materials beyond the usual range encountered in professional diving operations, where special precautions must be taken to reduce and mitigate the risks of exposure to these materials. Hazmat diving implies that specialised equipment will be required to dive at an acceptable level of risk. Equipment Most equipment used for hazmat diving is similar to other professional diving equipment, but may be modified to limit the risk of direct exposure of the diver and support personnel to the hazardous materials known or suspected to be present. The equipment appropriate to a hazmat diving operation will depend on the nature of the hazardous materials present and their potential effect on the diving team, and also to legislative constraints and the recommendations or requirements of codes of practice and organisational guidelines. The legal constraints commonly only allow the use of surface supplied diving equipment ‚Äì scuba is generally not permitted for hazmat diving. One of the features common to hazmat diving equipment is breathing gas exhaust systems that minimise the risk of backflow of contamination through the exhaust valves into the helmet. Most of these systems provide a slight over-pressure inside the helmet to prevent backflow in addition to non-return valves. * Positive pressure full-face mask: ‚Äì this system maintains a slightly higher internal pressure inside the mask so that any leakage will be outward. Generally only used for low risk contamination. * Redundant exhaust valves: ‚Äì Full-face masks and helmets can be fitted with exhaust systems in which the gas must pass through two valves in series to reach the outside environment, and therefore contaminants must pass through both sets of valves to get into the helmet. * Free-flow breathing gas supply: ‚Äì A supply of breathing gas in excess of the divers needs ensures that there is always an outward flow in the exhaust system, and reduces the risk of contaminated liquid getting in against the flow. * Exhaust to atmosphere: ‚Äì A reclaim type helmet which has an exhaust regulator can be used. The exhaled gas is not reclaimed but is returned to the atmosphere above the contaminated water. The reclaim valve prevents helmet squeeze by preventing exhaust flow except when there is a slight overpressure inside the helmet. The material of the diving suit should be selected for best resistance to the contaminants, and ease of decontamination. In some cases the suit may only be able to safely resist the chemical attack of the contaminants for a limited period, and may have to be discarded after a single use. Dry suits are used to isolate the diver from the diving medium. The helmet may be directly sealed to the suit. The suit is more easily decontaminated if it has a slick outer surface. Gloves will generally be integral parts of the suit to reduce the risk of leaks at cuff joints. Automatic suit dump valves are an additional potential leak and may be omitted from the suit if the helmet is directly sealed to the suit. Where there may be atmospheric contamination in the vicinity of the dive site, both main and reserve breathing gas supply will be from high pressure storage cylinders. Procedures The procedures used in hazmat diving depend on the specific hazard and the assessed risks to health and safety of the diving team. =Risk management= Besides the ordinary hazards of the underwater environment and the special hazards of the specific dive site, the hazmat diving team must deal with the exceptional hazards of the contaminants that are classed as hazardous materials to which they may be exposed during a diving operation. The three major classes of pollutants are chemical, biological and radioactive materials, and the risks associated with them vary considerably. The first stage of assessing the risk of a hazmat dive is to identify the contaminants present and assess the possible consequences of exposure and the type of equipment that may be used to protect the personnel, particularly the divers. Risk management will include assessing possible modes of contamination, available protective equipment, consequences of exposure, methods of mitigation, level of risk, and post dive health monitoring, as it is often not possible to exclude the possibility of contamination having occurred despite all precautions, particularly with pathogens. =Decontamination= The route to and from the contaminated environment will pass through a decontamination station. After exiting the water all equipment will be decontaminated at this point before proceeding further. The decontamination procedures and precautions will depend on the nature of the hazardous materials to which the equipment has been exposed. Decontamination may begin with a washdown with fresh water to remove the bulk of contamination. This may occur at the first convenient opportunity, including hosing down as the diver exits the water. The diver is then more comprehensively decontaminated using materials appropriate to the specific contaminants. The decontamination team may be at risk during decontamination procedures, and will wear suitable protection while in the decontamination area. Decontamination will start with the diver still fully dressed in all equipment, so it is necessary to work quickly and systematically to minimise the time the diver is required to endure the process. Particular attention is given to the sealing areas between helmet and suit, as these can trap contaminants and expose the diver to contact when the helmet is removed. Precautions are taken to contain and properly dispose of decontamination fluids. The decontamination team must be appropriately competent in the required procedures and equipment. The diver will be stripped of diving equipment and suit by the decontamination team and will then go through a decontamination shower, or in some cares two showers in isolated compartments in series, followed by a medical examination and neurological survey, depending on the hazardous materials involved. Diving equipment must also be adequately decontaminated, and in some cases it may be necessary to dispose of equipment. Further details on diver decontamination are available in USEPA's Diving Safety Manual, Appendix Q at www.epa.gov/diving/safety. =Health monitoring of personnel= Specific environments and associated hazards =Nuclear diving= Nuclear diving is a kind of hazmat diving; the distinguishing feature is the exposure to radiation instead of a water borne contaminant. To this end, different precautions are required for nuclear diving, mainly, equipment which will not absorb radioactive contamination and pose a disposal problem after several dives. Moreover, exhaustive briefing of the group or diver for the specific environment he is going to work, depth, water temperature and potential radioactive sources. Heat stress can also be a danger for the diver, in which case a cold water suit may be used: the cold water suit is a special canvas coverall which floods the outside of the diver's drysuit with chilled water, countering the dangerously high ambient water temperature. A dosimeter is used to ensure that the diver does not accumulate a dangerous dose of radiation during the dive, assisting in calculating the maximum length of the dive. In addition the dosimeter can also be used to find radiation hot spots, which can indicate areas in need of repair. =Sewer diving= Sewer diving is one of the most dangerous of all the hazmat jobs due to the disease vectors carried by raw sewage and because hypodermic needles and broken glass may contaminate the raw sewage, creating risks of contracting diseases through cuts and punctures. Divers working in a dangerously contaminated environment wear a full drysuit with integral boots. Cut-resistant dry-gloves and helmet will seal directly to the drysuit, leaving no skin exposed to the environment. The diver will generally use a free flow diving helmet which continually supplies more air than the diver needs to breathe so that there is a constant outflow through the exhaust valve, as the internal pressure must be slightly higher than ambient to maintain the flow. A free flow helmet has a significantly lower risk of leakage back through the exhaust valve compared to a standard demand helmet where the exhaust valve must maintain a watertight seal against a slightly higher external pressure during inhalation. The risk of leakage through the exhaust valve of a demand system can be reduced in three ways. A series system of valves can be used - the exhaust gases must pass through two sets of exhaust valves before reaching the contaminated environment, and therefore contaminated water would have to leak back through both sets of valves to get to the diver. Positive pressure systems maintain a slightly higher pressure inside the mask or helmet than the ambient pressure on the outside, ensuring that any leaks flow from inside to outside, and reclaim type systems duct the exhaled breathing gas back to the control panel on the surface, but do not necessarily reclaim the exhaust gas. Combinations of these methods are possible depending on the assessed risk. The drysuit will be made from a material resistant to the hazardous materials at the site: normally the diver wears a vulcanized rubber drysuit, which is relatively easy to decontaminate as it has a slick outer surface, but occasionally a neoprene or tri-laminate suit is needed. Often, a diver will wear extra protection over the drysuit to reduce the risk of a puncture: leather, PVC and nylon coveralls are used for this purpose. In such diving, light levels are often very low and the water is usually very turbid, so divers may rely on touch to guide them, and they are connected via the umbilical to the surface. The umbilical serves as a supply of breathing gas, for communications, and as a lifeline to find and retrieve the diver in an emergency. It is also used as a guide to find the way back to the surface.

It is the oldest known example of embroidery in Japan, dating back to 622 CE. It was created in honour of Prince Sh≈çtoku, one of the earliest proponents of Japanese Buddhism. Creation In the J≈çg≈´ Sh≈çtoku H≈ç≈ç Teisetsu, it is recorded that Tachibana no ≈åiratsume, one of the widows of Prince Sh≈çtoku, commissioned the mandala after her husband's death, to represent the heavenly realm to which he had departed so that she could envision his afterlife. The artwork was created by maidservants of the Imperial Court, with the permission of the Empress Suiko. The original was stitched in silk on a series of large square curtains, approximately across, but only a small portion of this, measuring approximately by , still survives. Replica and current version The mandala is held at the Nara National Museum, but remains the property of the Ch≈´g≈´-ji temple in Nara Prefecture. The extant version was created in the Edo period by combining remnants of the original embroidery with a replica made in the late 13th century. Its association with the temple and its reconstruction are due to the work of the Buddhist nun Shinnyo, who recovered the original mandala from its storage at H≈çry≈´-ji in 1273. According to the narratives of Shinnyo's life, she had a dream in which she learned that the mandala contained the death date of the , consort of Emperor Jomei and mother of Sh≈çtoku (Shinnyo was researching Hashihito, the patroness of Ch≈´g≈´-ji, as part of her work to restore the temple). The mandala was locked away at H≈çry≈´- ji, but a break-in at the H≈çry≈´-ji treasury allowed Shinnyo to access their stores under the pretext of checking for damages. There, she found the mandala, severely damaged, and was given permission to remove it to Ch≈´g≈´-ji. She subsequently took it on a fund-raising tour to Kyoto, and received enough donations to fund the creation of a replica. Both the replica and the original were damaged by fires at Ch≈´g≈´-ji in the early fourteenth century, but the damaged pieces were preserved and in the nineteenth century were combined together to create the current version. The colour fastness of the original material was superior to that of the later replica; in the extant version of the artwork, the brighter sections are all derived from the original. Content The mandala depicts the Buddhist realm of Tenjukoku (), or the \\"Land of Infinite Life\\", and presents a number of different elements representing various Buddhist concepts. The building in the bottom right is assumed by most scholars to represent the heavenly palace of Zenp≈çd≈ç from the Maitreya Sutra. The main pattern of tortoises contains characters spelling the names of Sh≈çtoku, Hashihito and ≈åiratsume, arranged as a Buddhist triad, and represents Sh≈çtoku's genealogy; other tortoises contain further characters recorded in the J≈çg≈´ Sh≈çtoku H≈ç≈ç Teisetsu, including the death dates of Sh≈çtoku and his mother, and the story of the mandala's creation. The original version of the work contained 100 such tortoises. An inscription, purportedly a statement by Sh≈çtoku, was originally appended: \\"The world is folly. Only the Buddha is real.\\" The original base fabric on which the images are embroidered is a woven purple gauze, which may have been imported; the later replica sections are stitched onto purple twill or plain white silk. The embroidery threads of the original are z-twisted (right laid) and are sewn exclusively in backstitch while the replica uses looser s-twisted yarn and a variety of different stitches. The looser twist of the yarn may be one of the reasons that the replica sections are less well-preserved. Some researchers argue that the similarity of the mandala's iconography to Chinese and Korean funeral monuments, together with the gauze fabric on which it was originally stitched, indicate that it is not in fact a Buddhist artefact. This theory suggests that the artwork does not represent Tenjukoku, but rather constitutes a record of the memorial rites performed for Sh≈çtoku, and that the association with Buddhism was a later development.

Education response ecosystem  Within the education sector, there is a diversity of actors and systems to address substance use. These are elements of an effective education sector response which include * ¬ÇA policy framework to prevent and address substance use among children and young people; * ¬ÇNational and/or subnational curricula (contents and methods for the delivery of those contents) including skills-based prevention education; * ¬ÇTraining and support for teachers, school health practitioners and other school staff to plan, develop and implement a comprehensive school- based intervention strategy; * ¬ÇEvidence-based interventions related to curricula implemented in educational institutions; * ¬ÇEvidence-based interventions related to the school environment implemented in educational institutions, including substance use policies in schools, as well as other evidence-based prevention interventions delivered in the context of educational institutions; * ¬ÇSchool health services, providing both prevention and care and support for young people who use substances; * Management, coordination and evaluation of the response in the education sector, including monitoring of prevalence of substance use among children and young people.  Curricula  Substance use is one of several important social and health issues that society calls on the education sector to address through the curriculum, along with other behavioural prevention areas, for example, mental health, sexual health, nutrition and bullying. In a curriculum, substance use prevention education is usually and most appropriately accommodated in a health-related subject area (variously termed healthy active living, health and family living, health and physical education, personal and social skills education, health and career education, life-skills education, etc.). Many schools choose also to supplement or replace the standard life-skills or other health-related curriculum with a manualized programme, i.e., a programme standardized through the creation of manuals and protocols for those who implement it. This has been shown by research to be effective in preventing substance use later in life and/ or supporting resilient mental health or acquiring life or academic skills.UNODC. 2013. International Standards on Drug Use Prevention. Vienna: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/prevention/prevention-standards.html Curriculum aiming to prevent substance use before the typical age of first use within the school system is directed at children who are around 6‚Äì12 years old. The typical age of first use of any substance will vary according to the national or local situation. Prevention education curriculum during this period is centred on what is referred to as ‚Äòskills-based health education‚Äô. It aims to develop key personal and social skills such as those that support healthy emotional and social development during this period, and protect against later substance use. In addition to protecting against later substance use, skills- based education has also been shown to have a positive effect on general problem behaviours, commitment to school, academic performance, self-esteem, mental well- being, self-management and other social skills (besides Australia, Canada, Europe and the United States, the evidence also originates from Africa, Latin America and India).  Training and supporting educators and other personnel  Research has found that training increases the likelihood that a teacher will actually deliver skills-based prevention content, and do it in the way it was intended. Training can help teachers adapt programme methods to their own teaching styles and aptitudes, while retaining the core components of the programme.  Evidence-based responses at school level  At the school level, approaches to responding to substance use can be broken down into two categories: Universal prevention and selective and indicated prevention. = Universal prevention = Universal prevention aims to prevent substance use in the school population at large. This approach aims to reduce risks across the school or target age/ year group by providing knowledge and skills that are protective towards substance use, or by changing school policies and environment in ways that prevent and reduce substance use among all students. = Selective and indicated prevention = ¬ÇSelective and indicated prevention targets individuals or groups deemed at particular risk of initiating substance use or who are already involved in substance use behaviours. These approaches involve identifying at-risk individuals or groups and targeting prevention efforts towards them, or identifying those who are showing early signs of substance use and then intervening. =Mindfulness and stress skills programs as a preventative response to substance use= Schools are experimenting with Mindfulness programs in classrooms to reduce stress and anxiety of students. Yoga and the practice of being present in one‚Äôs environment provide a life-long stress reduction tool and improve social, emotional, and physical health. In addition to Yoga and Mindfulness, social emotional learning has been newly introduced into substance use prevention programs, with the goal of increasing self-awareness and reducing risky behaviors associated with substance use. Previous drug intervention programs involved ‚Äújust saying no‚Äù, which offers no defense against temptation, other than a strong will to avoid peer pressure. Mindfulness and other stress- reduction techniques offer a tool that combats the need for drug use by teaching individuals how to process emotions effectively rather than numbing emotions or stress with substances. In the United States, acceptance of meditation and yoga programs in public schools is needed, as there is some resistance from parents and those who feel these practices have religious origins, violating religious freedoms provisions under article 1, section 4 of the California Constitution guided under the First Amendment. In the case of Sedlock V. Baird, the Appellate court rejected Sedlock's claim of unconstitutional yoga teaching in the district of Encinitas, CA, deeming yoga as non-religious. These practices are worth pursuing in the education sector, as there is scientific evidence emerging of the health benefits, along with the argument that any reasonable students would not be swayed for or against religion through these exercises. While mediation and yoga may be controversial, there is a strong case for some form of life skills training to strengthen teen's resistance to drug use. Mentor programs also act as preventative maintenance in guiding the youth away from maladaptive behaviors. A core issue of addiction is that it is often learned behavior from family exposure, and the cycle persists. Mentorship programs along with meditation, yoga, and social emotional learning in schools show great promise for breaking the cycle of addiction in families.  School health services  School health services are most commonly led by nurses, but doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists, dentists, social workers and counsellors may also be involved. By virtue of their professional training, nurses are very well positioned to provide a central role with school-based health services and with substance use prevention. Their professional role permits them to: * ¬ÇProvide prevention education in school (e.g. concerning non-medical use of prescribed medicines by children and young people). * ¬ÇIdentify and safely manage a new situation in the community (e.g. an emerging substance use pattern). * ¬ÇHelp families and teachers recognize signs and symptoms of substance use, as well as risk factors related to use (such as anxiety, depression or attention deficit, for example) and help them also in supporting protective factors against substance use such as resilient mental health. * ¬ÇIdentify and meet substance use- related needs of individual students and help students or families locate resources, and assist them in finding a route to specialist services. * ¬ÇWhen trained, deliver brief interventions to students, an effective response to substance use (see Section 3.2.4) (Pirskanen et al., 2006). * ¬ÇIdentify and manage emergency situations (e.g. overdose) until relieved by emergency medical service personnel, and follow up with the health care provider. * ¬ÇProvide advocacy in the community on issues of concern to the health of children and youth. * ¬ÇLead and train other school professionals or other school staff to be part of the prevention project and to deliver evidence- based content related to substance use within the curriculum.  National education sector policies on substance use prevention  At the national level, education sector involvement is most effective in the context of a long-term integrated substance use prevention and control system or strategy that targets various ages and levels of vulnerability through a full range of sectors. A majority of countries have national policies or strategies/ action plans concerned with tobacco and the reduction of supply and demand of drugs, and many have a separate alcohol policy or strategy. However, the trend is toward comprehensive and balanced policies or strategies that integrate the various substances. Current substance use control strategies increasingly understand substance use to be first and foremost a health issue that is best addressed through a range of demand reduction measures including: early intervention; treatment; rehabilitation; recovery and social reintegration measures; and measures to minimize the public health and social consequences of substance abuse.UNODC. 2014. E/CN.7/2014/7. Action taken by Member States to implement the Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem. Report of the Executive Director. Available at https://www.unodc.org/documents/commissions/CND/CND_Sessions/ CND_57/_E- CN7-2014-07/E-CN7-2014-7_V1389056_E.pdf All of these functions, including prevention, can fall within the purview of a public health system. The national education sector derives a clear mandate to respond to substance use through policy language that typically calls the sector to take responsibility for promoting ‚Äòhealth and safety‚Äô, ‚Äòhealthy lifestyles‚Äô or ‚Äòlife- skills‚Äô among students. For example, within the Eastern European and Central Asian region, most countries address the primary goal of substance use prevention by establishing education laws that oblige schools to build skills and foster a culture of healthy lifestyles and safe behaviour among children and young people.UNESCO. 2015b. Substance use prevention in educational settings in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Moscow: UNESCO. Within this context, national education sector substance use prevention policy has taken a number of forms, and can be categorized as follows: = ¬ÇMandatory school substance policies = National substance policies may mandate school policies to prevent substance use and its health and social consequences within schools. This typically includes bans on substances (use, selling and advertising) on school premises or surrounding properties. School rules relating to substance use often include the behaviours of teachers and other adults, and policies regarding dealing with substance use-related incidents. = ¬ÇStatutory health and substance use education = National education policies may enshrine the duty of schools to provide health and/or substance use- related education and training. Such training is often incorporated within other subject headings such as science or physical education, or in free-standing health or personal skills curricula. This often implies that prevention methodologies and contents are part of the mandatory teacher training. = ¬ÇProvision of school health services = National policies may mandate the implementation of school health services. These services allow for the provision of an accessible range of health services including preventive, routine and acute health services for students. They may include a range of personnel, including school nurses, advisors and counsellors and mental health professionals. The services provided often contribute to preventive education, the development of school health and substance use policies, early identi cation and interventions and connections with the social and health sectors. = ¬ÇNational quality standards for school-based prevention efforts = School substance use prevention can be encouraged and guided by quality standards. They are increasingly available (e.g. European drug prevention quality standards;http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/manuals/prevention- standards Canadian Standards for School-based Youth Substance Abuse Prevention),http://www.ccsa.ca/Eng/topics/Children-and-Youth/Drug-Prevention- Standards/Pages/default.aspx and typically advocate for evidence-based programming, sound planning and design, comprehensive activity, monitoring, evaluation, professional development and sustainability. Quality standards help to support national policy initiatives and guide schools in meeting their mandate to promote health and prevent substance use. = ¬ÇMonitoring of substance use among children and young people = Some countries participate in global or regional monitoring or conduct national- level monitoring of substance use prevalence among children and adolescents. This is not an education sector activity per se but it does indicate that the issue is a priority, providing a measure of endorsement and most importantly, guidance, for school prevention activity.  International frameworks to guide Education sector responses to substance abuse  A number of international statutes stipulate the responsibility of various sectors, including the education sector, to prevent and minimize harm from substance use among children and young people. Most relevant are the following: = ¬ÇInternational policy initiatives that enshrine the right of children and young people to health and safety = * International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966); * UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989); * Dakar Framework for Action ‚Äì Education for All (2000), and Incheon Declaration ‚Äì Education 2030: Towards inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all (2015); * Declaration and Plan of Action ‚ÄòA World Fit for Children‚Äô (2002); * UN Global Monitoring Framework (2013). = ¬ÇRecent policy conventions focusing on the management of psychoactive substances and substance use call for broad action = * WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (2005); * Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem (2009); * WHO Global Strategy to Reduce the Harmful Use of Alcohol (2010). = ¬ÇUN International Drug Control Conventions that provide a framework for efforts to control the supply and demand for illicit drugs = * Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961); * The Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971); * Convention against the Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988). = ¬ÇRecent initiatives that may inform and mandate an education sector response = * In the 2030 Development Agenda adopted in 2015, the UN Member States commit to strengthen prevention and treatment of substance abuse by 2030, in the sub goal 3.5. * The Commission on Narcotic Drugs calls on ‚ÄòMember States to formulate and implement, where appropriate, a broad system of primary prevention and early intervention based on scientific evidence, such as the International Standards on Drug Use Prevention and other measures, including educational activities and interactive campaigns‚Äô. * The Outcome Document of the UN General Assembly Special Session on drugs, organized in 2016, highlights a balanced health- and human rights-based approach to addressing the world drug problem, giving an additional mandate to drug prevention and treatment.
