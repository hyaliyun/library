Two, both cutters, served at the same time between 1799 and 1801. A third, variously referred to as a tender or cutter, served from 1803 to 1814. Earl Spencer (1) Earl Spencer, of 163 tons (bm) served under contract between 7 July 1799 and 20 October 1801. She carried two 6-pounder guns and twelve 12-pounder carronades.Winfield (2008), p.390. At some point in early 1800, Earl Spencer and the hired armed cutter Nile recaptured Molly, which was in ballast. This was probably Molley, which had been sailing from Exeter to Newcastle when a French privateer had captured her. Molley came into Deal on 14 February.London Chronicle, 15‚Äì18 February 1800, p.165. On 15 September Rye and Earl Spencer brought into Portsmouth a neutral vessel they had detained.Naval Chronicle, Vol.4 , p.253. This was probably Maria Margaretha, which they had captured on 12 September. Then on 23 November Earl Spencer left Portsmouth in search of a privateer reported to be off the back of the Isle of Wight.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.439. Lastly, Rye returned to Portsmouth on 24 December from a cruise. A few days earlier she had chased a French 16-gun privateer lugger but had lost her quarry in a thick fog. Still, Earl Spencer brought in with her the ship Martha, which she had detained and which was \\"richly laden\\".Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.525. On 1 January 1801 Rye received promotion to Commander, and transferred to .O'Byrne (1849), vol. 3, p.1017. Lieutenant James Leach replaced Rye. On 15 May 1801 Fisgard, and the hired armed cutters Hirondelle and Earl Spencer, recaptured the brig Victory from the French. Victory, John Bowden (or Barden), master, had been sailing from London to St John's, Newfoundland, when on 1 May the French privateer Arriege had captured her. The recaptured Victory came into Plymouth.[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015005721512?urlappend=%3Bseq=91 Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4154.

The privateers sent Robuste into Jersey.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4365. A few days later Robuste, of 300 tons (bm), and her cargo of sugar and coffee, arrived at Guernsey.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4366. On 13 September Lloyd's List reported that the French privateer Venus, of Nantes, had captured Royal Charlotte, Hamilton, master, sailing from Wilmington to London. Earl Spencer recaptured Royal Charlotte and left her at . Earl Spencer then put into Penzance. She had lost two men killed and seven wounded in an engagement with Venus, and had sustained heavy damage.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4384.

On 17 April 1800, Lieutenant Anthony Thompson, commander, and Earl Spencer captured Faderland. In December Earl Spencer and Thompson recaptured two brigs: Mary Ann and Hardwick. Mary Ann, Bexfield, master, came into Dover. Hardwick, Nobs, master, came into Ramsgate. Both had been sailing from Yarmouth to Liverpool when they were captured.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ41119. Earl Spencer (3) Earl Spencer, of 141 tons (bm) served under contract between 27 July 1803 and 9 June 1814. She carried twelve 12-pounder carronades. Winfield (2008), p.392. She had an uneventful war. There are numerous mentions in the press of her escorting convoys. In May 1805 Lieutenant William Bothwell is reported to be her commander. His name appears again in 1808, and 1811. His is the only name linked to her. On 26 February 1805 Lloyd's List reported that Ann, Heineman, master, arrived at Cork. Earl Spencer had recaptured her after she had been captured while sailing from Dublin to London.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4195. On 27 October 1806 Earl Spencer returned to Belfast. She had been convoying the linen ships from Belfast when she encountered heavy seas near the Isle of Man. She had had to throw her guns overboard to ride out the waves.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4097.

After showing promise when finishing third on her only start as a two-year-old in 1983 she improved in the following year to become the best filly of her generation in Ireland. With the implementation of front-running tactics she won four races including the Pretty Polly Stakes and the Irish Oaks as well as finishing third in the Irish Champion Stakes. She failed to reproduce her best form in 1985 and was retired from racing at the end of the year. As a broodmare she produced winners, the best of whom was the Cambridgeshire Handicap winner Pasternak. Background Princess Pati was a \\"lengthy\\" bay mare with a white star and snip and a white sock on her right hind leg bred in Ireland by the Ardenode Stud, which was owned and managed by Jim and Meg Mullion. During her racing career she carried the colours of Meg Mullion and was trained at the Curragh in Ireland by Con Collins. Her sire Top Ville was an Irish-bred, French-trained horse who won the Prix du Jockey Club in 1979. At stud his other progeny included Toulon, Saint Estephe, Pistolet Bleu (Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud), Darara and Shardari. Princess Pati's dam Sarah Siddons was a top-class performer who won the Irish 1,000 Guineas and Yorkshire Oaks for the Mullions in 1976 before becoming a successful broodmare: she also produced the Great Voltigeur Stakes winner Seymour Hicks and was the female-line ancestor of numerous winners including Excelebration and the Prix Vermeille winner Leggera. Sarah Siddons was the first of only three foals produced by Mariel, a high-class mare who won the Pretty Polly Stakes, and was placed in the Irish 1000 Guineas, Epsom Oaks and Irish Oaks. Mariel's dam Ela Marita won the Fred Darling Stakes and the Musidora Stakes and was a half-sister to Ragusa. Racing career =1983: two-year-old season= Princess Pati made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse in September 1983. She led the field until the closing stages and finished third of the eighteen runners behind Princess Tracy, a filly who had previously finished fourth in the Moyglare Stud Stakes. =1984: three-year-old season= Princess Pati began her second season with a victory in a maiden race over six furlongs at the Curragh and then took the April Stakes over seven furlongs at the same track, winning with \\"impressive ease\\" on both occasions. In May she was stepped up in class and distance for the Group 1 Irish 1,000 Guineas over one mile and finished seventh of the twenty-three runners behind the British-trained Katies. It was subsequently revealed that the filly had been in season at the time of the race. In June she was matched against male opposition in the Woodpark Stud Race over ten furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse and finished third behind the colts Sondrio and Solar City. She returned to winning form at the Curragh later that month when she won the Pretty Polly Stakes over ten furlongs, beating the Dermot Weld-trained Quick Reference by six lengths after making most of the running under Pat Shanahan. In the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles on firm ground at the Curragh in July she started 9/2 second choice in the betting behind The Oaks winner Circus Plume with the other nine runners including Clare Bridge (second in the Prix de Malleret) and the Epsom runner- up Media Luna. Shanahan sent Princess Pati into the lead from the start and opened up a clear advantage while Lester Piggott restrained the favourite towards the rear. Princess Pati's advantage diminished on the final turn but she accelerated again in the straight and had no difficulty holding off Circus Plume to win by two lengths in a new course record time of 2:28.60. Shanahan, who was in his first season as a professional jockey later recalled that he had been \\"a nervous wreck\\" at the prospect of riding against Piggott, who had been his childhood idol. In her two remaining races of the season, Princess Pati was matched against the best weight-for-age competition. In the Phoenix Champion Stakes, the most valuable horse race ever run up to that time in Ireland, she led for most of the way before coming home third to Sadler's Wells and Seattle Song with Desirable and Tolomeo among those finishing behind her. On her final appearance of the season she made her first start outside Ireland when she was sent to France to contest the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in October. She was among the early leaders but lost her place entering the straight as she tired on the heavy ground and finished unplaced behind Sagace. =1985: four-year-old season= Princess Pati remained in training as a four-year-old but made no impact in three races. She was equipped with blinkers on her debut when she finished unplaced in the Tattersalls Gold Cup in May and then slipped and fell on her next start. In her final appearance she started a 100/1 outsider and finished eleventh of the twelve runners behind Petoski in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot Racecourse on 27 July. Assessment In 1983 the independent Timeform organisation described Princess Pati as \\"promising\\" and awarded her a rating on 83 p, the \\"p\\" indicating that she was likely to make more than usual progress. In the official International Classification for 1984 she was the highest-rated Irish-trained three-year-old filly and the fifth best filly of her generation in Europe behind Northern Trick, Katies, Reine Mathilde and Circus Plume. Timeform gave her a rating of 124 in 1984, seven pounds behind Northern Trick and described her as \\"an admirably genuine sort\\". Pat Shanahan regarded her as the best horse he ever rode. Breeding record After her retirement from racing Princess Pati became a broodmare for the Arenode Stud. She produced at least eight foals and six winners between 1987 and 1999: *Srivijaya, a bay colt (later gelded), foaled in 1987, sired by Kris. Won three flat races and five National Hunt races. *Maxwelton Braes, bay colt (gelded), 1989, by Lomond. Won one race. *Princess Pavlova, bay filly, 1990, by Sadler's Wells. Unraced. *Parthian Springs, bay colt, 1991, by Sadler's Wells. Won three races. *Pasternak, bay colt, 1993, by Soviet Star. Won four races including Cambridgeshire Handicap. *Arapi, bay filly, 1994, by Arazi. Won two races. *Milling, bay filly, 1995, by In The Wings. Won one race. *Compton Dictator, bay colt (gelded), 1999, by Shareef Dancer. Failed to win in eight races.

From 1920 to 1923, she headed the Norwegian Labour Party's Women's Federation (Arbeiderpartiets kvindeforbund), taking a more radical stand than her predecessors Gunhild Ziener and Martha Tyn√¶s by supporting dictatorship of the proletariat and socialization in line with trends in Moscow. Biography Originally from R√∏yken, Adolfsen first became active in the seamsters' association in Christiania where she served as both chairman and treasurer. In 1917, she became secretary of the Norwegian Tailors Association (Norsk Skr√¶dderforbund), where she was appointed treasurer in 1920. In addition to becoming a board member of Kvinnenes kontor (The Women's Office) from its establishment in 1909, she served on Oslo's city council where she worked on hospitals and social care. Adolfsen was elected chair of the Labour Party's Women's Federation after a dramatic confrontation with the less radical former chairman Gunhild Ziener. Under her leadership, the Federation's membership decreased from some 4,000 to 3,000 but later began to rise again. As a result of pressure from Moscow, at the 1923 national congress, the Federation became an arm of the Labour Party itself where it was known as Arbeiderpartiets kvinnesekretariat (The Labour Party's Women's Secretariat). It was first headed by Thina Thorleifsen. Hanna Adolfsen died from an illness in 1926.

Paul Pollitz and published in Leipzig, Germany, in 1916. It is a summary of previous findings on psychological, social and economic characteristics of criminals for a variety of different crime types based on the statistics of the early 20th century. The focus lies on three main causes for committing crimes, which can interact or are presented in solitude. These causes depict crimes as a result of socio-economic circumstances, impaired psyche, and/ or personality of the criminal. The book is divided into five main categories, which include an introduction to the necessity of criminal psychology, followed by the second section on Lombroso's theory of a criminal's psychological characteristics. Afterwards, the third main section, namely general criminal psychology and statistics, presents different frequency numbers and trends of crimes in various background, including for instance sex, age, profession, and marriage relations to crime. Furthermore, the fourth main section deals with specific criminal psychology and describes crimes of people with mental illnesses, alcoholism, prostitution, puberty, and others. The closing words highlight the areas, which the author believes to be most crucial to interfere with in order to decrease the frequency of crime. Historical background During the end of the 19th century, criminal psychology became known as a proper field of studies due to Cesare Lombroso's research on characteristics of the \\"criminal man\\" (1876). Inspired by Charles Darwin recently published theory of evolution, Lombroso conducted anthropological research and performed extensive analyses on physiological, psychological, zoological and ethnological characteristics of criminals. Based on his results, he concluded that a habitual criminal can be seen as a regression of the human being to his very roots as a wild, uncivilized person. This regression is also called atavism, and, according to Lombroso, explains a large number of criminal acts. Further, Lombroso stated that criminality is an inheritable feature which can be detected by presence of tattoos or a felon's physiognomy, meaning measurements based on visible face and skull characteristics. Charles Goring was the first to refute a relation of physical aspects and criminality-likelihood with an extensive study that compared non- criminals to convicts on numerous physical features and mental abilities. Goring's results, published in 1913, could not support Lombroso's findings on inheritable criminality. In the presently reviewed book, Pollitz refers to Lombroso and his theory's current status in criminal psychology. Content =Lombroso's theory= Pollitz denies the correctness of Lombroso's investigations on criminal physiognomy, as at that time the accuracy of such measures has already been discredited. However, Lombroso's notes on the lack of empathy, cold-hearted cruelty and indifference, and even on tattoos and racketeer language are picked up at later parts of the book. Moreover, Pollitz supports Lombroso's description of the habitual female criminal, whose physical built is supposedly very similar to a man's body. In the following topics of the book, Pollitz bases several sub-topics on areas that Lombroso already identified as being significant to criminal statistics and crucial to consider in mathematical analyses. =General criminal psychology - Overview of criminal statistics= Pollitz emphasizes the importance of statistics in criminal psychology, for which it is essential to also inspect the reasons for a decrease or increase in criminality. Here are a few examples of his disquisition on criminal statistics: Psychology of the sexes At the time of publication, a small step in the direction of improving emancipation could be observed by decreasing marriage rates and an increasing variety of work that women took part in. The slight reluctance to such independence might be sensed when reading through Pollitz's description of sex differences in criminal acts. By quoting other authors on criminality, he supports the point that women who are increasingly participating in non-traditional work would lead to a larger amount of criminal women, as this work is not in accord with the ‚ÄúNatur des [weiblichen] Geschlechts‚Äù (English: ‚Äúnature of the [female] sex‚Äù). Additionally, Pollitz justifies the far higher number of male criminals, which has a ratio of 5:1 to female criminals, with the higher number of possible crimes that men can be prosecuted for. As an example, he indicates child's murder or abortion to be hardly provable, whereas men could easily be found guilty for sex crimes. Furthermore, Pollitz describes that the previously mentioned ratio varies between different crime types and especially perjury shows a much higher ratio for women than for men (8:3). Perjury is described as a typical \\"female crime\\", justified by the following observation: \\"Nicht nur die Unf√§higkeit der Frauen, Erlebtes und Beobachtetes ohne Beimengung von Erfundenem und Phantastischem zu reproduzieren, sondern auch die starke Gef√ºhlsbeeinflussung macht sie zu unsicheren Zeuginnen, besonders wenn eigene Interessen (Freundschaft, Liebe, Feindschaft, Hass) mit in Frage kommen.\\" (English: Not only women's inability to reproduce experiences and observations without interference of imaginations and phantasies, but also the strong influence of emotions makes women uncertain witnesses, especially when her interests (friendship, love, enmity, hate) are affected.) Relation of mental illness and crime Even at the time of publication, the law prevented any mentally disabled person to be responsible for his or her actions. The first described type of psychological characteristics related to crime reminds of the DSM-5's characteristics for antisocial personality disorder, which Pollitz explains to be heritable. As an illustration of such, he shows a pedigree with all the crimes existent in that family. However, it is important to note that with the example itself, he does not claim \\"lunatics\\" to be wild apes but rather that mania in its common meaning might be an heritable illness. A further type of mental illness is epilepsy. Its resulting degeneration of character is widely considered in criminal psychology, as it is strongly related to idiocy, indifference, egoism and sometimes tremendous cruelty. Further, when epileptic seizures decrease in number with increasing age, the result of such illness is solely the changed character without the visible physiological symptoms. Taking into account previous illnesses like epilepsy when evaluating a criminal's motives can improve understanding of some criminal acts. Pollitz‚Äô s general conclusion states, that the relation of mental impairment and crime is most often some form of deteriorated intelligence related to a variety of different crimes. Reception The following book receptions refer to the first edition of Pollitz's Die Psychologie der Verbrecher (1908). However, there are few differences between the first and the second edition, as the presently reviewed second edition mostly differs in the calculated statistics, which are updated for the new year of publication (1916). Generally, Pollitz was a respected prison director and therefore, his research was perceived as reliable and accurate. Especially Henderson (1912) describes the first edition and Pollitz's only other book, Strafe und Verbrechen (1910) in a very positive light by using terms as \\"remarkable\\" and \\"illuminating\\". Moreover, he finds the information given by the handbook informative and properly researched. Even though Upson (1911) does not indicate the opposite, he is restricting his enthusiasm by commenting on the downside of Pollitz's handbook. Upson mentions the limitations of content in so far that the book only focuses on a few causes for criminality. Nevertheless, he agrees that the most important factors are considered and the less scientific features, like Lombroso's anthropological notion, are discarded. Further criticism hints at the fact that Pollitz only enlists the factors which increase the frequency of criminal acts, but he does not provide any idea of improvement on economic, social, or cultural matters, nor does he indicate a potentially better-fit treatment for mentally-ill criminals.

Deutsche Bahn classifies it as a category 6 station and it has two platform tracks. The station is located in the network of the Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund (Karlsruhe Transport Association, KVV) and belongs to fare zone 575. Since 2001, the station has also been part of the area where the fares of the Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund (Karlsruhe Transport Association, KVV) are accepted at a transitional rate. The address of the station is Bahnhofstra√üe 8. It is located on the Schifferstadt‚ÄìW√∂rth railway and was opened on 25 July 1876 with the commissioning of the Germersheim‚ÄìW√∂rth section of that railway. It is now classified as a Haltepunkt (halt). Since late 2010 it has been part of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn. Since a new halt was opened at the same time, it is sometimes called Bellheim Bahnhof (Bellheim station), including in the recorded announcements of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn.  Location The station is located on the south-eastern outskirts of Bellheim.  History = Railway initiatives around Bellheim= Originally the administration of the Circle of the Rhine (Rheinkreis), which was part of Bavaria, planned that its first railway line would be first in the north-south direction from Rheinschanze via Lauterbourg to Strasbourg, which would compete with the Mannheim‚ÄìBasel railway proposed by Baden. However, instead it was decided to build the Palatine Ludwig Railway (Pf√§lzische Ludwigsbahn, Ludwigshafen‚ÄìBexbach), which was opened in the period from 1847 to 1849. In the meantime, discussions took place as to whether a line from Neustadt via Landau to Wissembourg or a line along the Rhine via Speyer, Germersheim and W√∂rth was more urgent and desirable. Since the military preferred a route on the edge of the Palatinate Forest (Pf√§lzerwald), this was built in the form of the Maximilian Railway between Neustadt and Wissembourg. The line to Speyer, which was opened in 1847, was extended to Germersheim in 1864. As a result, plans were made to establish a strategic railway between the fortresses of Germersheim and Landau. Of a total of four options, two would have run south of the Queich via Offenbach. The city council of Landau, in particular, supported a route through Bellheim. Nevertheless, the line was built north of the river, passing through Westheim, Oberlustadt and Niederlustadt and Zeiskam. In 1863 and 1864, a local committee from the surrounding community of R√ºlzheim, which included representatives of Bellheim, campaigned to extend the line that ended in Germersheim to W√∂rth. Subsequently, its first plan was produced, showing a route that ran via Bellheim. = Further development = The station became part of the area of the Reichsbahndirektion (Reichsbahn railway division) of Ludwigshafen after the founding of the Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1922. During the dissolution of the railway division of Ludwigshafen, responsibility for it was transferred to the railway division of Mainz on 1 May 1937. Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB), which was responsible for railway operations from 1949, assigned the station to the railway division of Mainz, which was responsible for all railway lines within the newly created state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In the course of the staged dissolution of the railway division of Mainz from 1 August 1971, its counterpart in Karlsruhe took responsibility for the station. The station had been downgraded to a halt in the 1990s. The station became part of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn in 2010. This involved the replacement of the island platform by a side platform. Entrance building Entrance building The former entrance building was built around 1870 as a so-called \\"standard building\\" in brick. It was built in the period when the station was opened and is under heritage protection. It is no longer used for railway operations. Operations The station is served at 30-minute intervals. Lines S 51 and S 52 of Karlsruhe Stadtbahn run once an hour, beginning in Germersheim station and running to the Karlsruhe inner city. The former follows the Winden‚ÄìKarlsruhe railway until shortly before Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof, where it runs over the ramp to the Albtalbahnhof to connect with the tram network. The S 52 leaves the Winden‚ÄìKarlsruhe railway east of Maxau, then runs over tram lines through the Karlsruhe district of Knielingen and from there to the inner city. Previously, Bellheim station had a connecting line to a NATO oil terminal and one to the B√ºrom√∂belfabrik Kardex, both of which are now dismantled.

The Pennsylvania Railroad manufactured three prototypes in the 1930s and a full fleet of sixty cars in 1947‚Äì1949. They were among the first examples of bilevel rail cars in the United States. The design was unpopular with both LIRR employees and commuters; the last cars were retired in 1972. A single example is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Long Island.  Design  The MP70 was an early attempt to increase the capacity of commuter trains without lengthening the train, foreshadowing the successful gallery cars introduced after World War II. The car was not a true bilevel design. It featured a single level with a centerline aisle, and two levels of seats, with the second staggered above the first. Passengers stepped up or down to reach the seats, which were in a facing 2√ó2 arrangement. This unusual arrangement was devised by Albert E. Hutt in 1928. The original prototype trailer seated 120 passengers, the first prototype motor car 134; all others 132. The Pennsylvania Railroad constructed the cars out of aluminum. This led to significant weight savings in the prototype: compared to an expected had the Pennsylvania used steel. The car was even slightly lighter than the single-level PRR MP54s then in service. Prototype No. 200 was long; all others were . Production motor cars weighed ; trailers weighed . The cars stood tall, short enough for the clearances in Pennsylvania Station and the East River Tunnels.  History  The Pennsylvania Railroad constructed the original prototype No. 200 in 1932. It was an unpowered trailer, with a seating capacity of 120. It entered revenue service on August 13, 1932. Two more prototypes arrived in December 1937: 201 (another unpowered trailer) and 1347 (a motor car). Because of the scarcity of aluminum, no further cars were built until after World War II. After World War II, the LIRR acquired sixty more double-decker cars. The first ten, five pairs of motor cars and trailers, entered service in 1947. Each car cost $102,000. The remaining fifty, forty- three motors and seven trailers, entered service in 1948‚Äì1949. The per-car cost rose on this order to $143,000. Although the LIRR claimed early on that \\"the passengers like them fine\\", the double-deckers were not successful. An early indicator was the LIRR's order in 1953 for twenty single-level multiple units from Pullman-Standard. These seated five across in a 3√ó2 configuration, for a maximum capacity of 128: nearly that of the MP70, but in a more conventional design. The split-level seating slowed boarding at stations and made ticket collection cumbersome. Cleaning the cars took longer than with single-level units because of the odd angles. On rainy days, water could run down into the lower seats from the center aisle. The facing seats earned the cars the derisive sobriquet \\"knee-knockers\\", while female passengers complained about the lack of modesty when seated in the upper level. The LIRR withdrew the last double-decker on February 29, 1972. William Ronan, then chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), cited mechanical unreliability, high operating costs, passenger discomfort, and the entry of new M1 railcars into service. The experience soured the LIRR on the concept, and it did not contemplate double-decker cars again until the late 1980s, when it ordered the C1 coach. No. 200, the original prototype, is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Long Island.

Brinkley decided to run for governor, a position that would enable him to appoint his own members to the medical board and thus regain his right to practice medicine. He began his candidacy in September 1930, just three days after he lost his medical license. He used his radio station to help his campaign, including recruiting a country music star to campaign for him. He also made use of several other publicity stunts. Brinkley campaigned on a vague program that included public works (a state lake in every county), education (free textbooks for public schoolchildren and increased educational opportunities for African Americans), lower taxes, and old-age pensions.Brock, Pope. Charlatan: America's Most Dangerous Huckster, the Man Who Pursued Him, and the Age of Flimflam, Crown Publishing. 2008. Because Brinkley announced his campaign so late, he had to run as a write-in candidate. Three days before the election, the Attorney General of Kansas (a known opponent) announced that the rules surrounding write-in candidates had changed, and that Brinkley's name could only be written in in one specific way for the vote to count (as \\"J.

Biography  Jean Par√© completed classical studies at the Petit S√©minaire de Qu√©bec and at the College Levis and then scientific studies at Montreal University (1955‚Äì1958). In 1992 he and some colleagues of other publishing houses were at the origins of the formation of the QAME (Quebecer Association of Magazine Editors), of which Par√© was the first chairman until 1993. He was also broadcaster and radio commentator. Jean Par√© wrote many books and also translated the work of many Anglo-Canadian writers, including Marshall McLuhan and Michael Ignatieff, former leader of the Canadian liberal party. = L‚Äôactualit√© = He is mostly known for founding the newspaper L'actualit√©, which he ran for over 25 years. He was also chairman of the media group Maclean Hunter Quebec and then of Rogers Media Publishing from 1995 until 2000. The first issue of the magazine L‚Äôactualit√©, published by the group Maclean Hunter, was released in September 1976. The purpose of this new monthly newspaper, born from the merger of Le Magazine Maclean and Actualit√©, is to give information about the political, economic, cultural and social news from here and elsewhere. The founders of L‚Äôactualit√© are Lloyd M. Hodgkinson, publisher, and Jean Par√©, who was editor at that time. Jean Par√© had succeeded to Louis Martin at the head of Le Magazine Maclean in April 1975 and had immediately set himself the task of creating a lasting newspaper with both of those struggling publications. Le Magazine Maclean was created in 1981. The other, Actualit√©, was the property of Claude Martin, a gallery-owner in Drummondville, and was founded around the same time by a group of influential Montrealers, among them Lucien Saulnier, town-councilor. The first editor of this newspaper was the Jesuit Jean-Louis Brouill√©. 25 years later, when Jean Par√© left, so at the end of the year 2000, L‚Äôactualit√©, which had become bimonthly in 1990, was still one of the biggest editorial successes in Quebec. While Le Magazine Maclean had been the loyal companion of the quiet revolution during the 60s, L‚Äôactualit√© became the witness of the new orientations of Quebec society and of the success of the new young generation. The newspaper played an important role at the time of the referendums in 1980 and 1995, as well as during the constitutional negotiations of 1982 and during the so- called Meech Lake accord and Charlottetown Accord.

Early life and family Born August 18, 1875Certificate of Death, State of Hawaii Dept. of Health, No. 151 1952-002489, at Wailuku, on the island of Maui, she was the daughter of Augustine Enos, a Portuguese immigrant to the Kingdom of Hawaii who worked as a rancher and merchant at Makawao, and Kininia Makaokatani, the daughter of a Native Hawaiian farmer from Koloa, on the island of Kauai. She was educated at St. Anthony's School for Girls on Maui at Wailuku and later Sacred Hearts Academy in Honolulu. At the age of eighteen, she eloped with and married Thomas Benjamin Lyons (1869-1926). T.B. Lyons was born in Hana, Maui. The couple lived in Hana, Maui where their first born son, Augustine John Edward Lyons (1894‚Äì1967) was born. After that they moved to Wailuku, Maui. They had a total of seven sons and two daughters. One daughter, Frances died at the age of 4; the other daughter, Cecilia died at the age of 1. They divorced in Jan 11, 1916 _The Maui News_ , Aug. 4, 1916, p. 3and she was remarried to Samuel Keli ªinoi on Feb 20, 1916 at the Congregational Church of Ewa _Maui News_ , March 3, 1916, . Both her husbands were active in politics: Lyons was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the Hawaii Territorial Legislature and served as postmaster of Wailuku while Keli ªinoi was a member of the Republican Party and was elected as a representative in the legislature from 1903 to 1904 and in 1911. They moved from Maui to Kapa ªa, Kauai in 1917. Political career After the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution giving women the right to vote, Keli ªinoi entered politics with the assistance of her husband and Hawaii Senator Charles Atwood Rice. She ran for the 1924 Hawaii Territorial election and was elected as a Republican representative for the sixth district (corresponding to the island of Kauai). She became the first woman since the monarchy to sit in the legislature. _The Honolulu Star Bulletin_ reported on Keliinoi's election win: ‚ÄúWhen the 13th territorial legislature convenes next February the first woman representative in the history of Hawaii will take her seat. She is Mrs. Rosalie Keliinoi of Kapaa, Kauai who was nominated at the primary as one of four Republican candidates out of a total of 14 contestants and who came second on the ticket at the general election. Mrs. Keliinoi is particularly interested in education and health matters, such as the control of tuberculosis, prevention of malnutrition and the reduction of infant mortality.‚Äù _The Honolulu Star Bulletin_ , Nov 13, 1924, p. 10. Keli ªinoi served in the 1925 session of the Hawaii Territorial Legislature, as the only female member. During her one term, she introduced sixteen bills and was responsible for the passage of four bills improving upon women's rights in Hawaii. Her notable contributions included a bill which gave married women the right to sell and manage their own lands without their husbands' consent (Act 274), a bill promoting the welfare of pregnant women (Act 31) and a bill designating Hulihe ªe Palace as a museum (Act 51). Finally, she had a bill passed that issued back-pay for Kaua'i public school teacher, Adelaide M. Baggott (Act 68). Keli ªinoi died of heart failure, in Honolulu, on November 2, 1952. She was buried at the Saint Anthony Church Catholic Cemetery in Wailuku. Her status as Hawaii's first female legislator paved the way for other future Hawaiian women in politics.

Although high eosinophil levels are associated with certain diseases and thought to contribute to the tissue destruction found in many other eosinophilia-related diseases (see clonal eosinophilia), clinical manifestations and tissue destruction related to the eosinophilia in familial eosinophilia is uncommon: this genetic disease typically has a benign phenotype and course compared to other congenital and acquired eosinophilic diseases.  Presentation  Individuals with familial eosinophilia exhibit hypereosinophilia presumably from birth (earliest documentation at 4 months of age). Elevated blood levels of eosinophils are remarkably stable over time in affected family members. These individuals are generally detected on routine blood cell counts and at the time of diagnosis present without symptoms or at least no symptoms related to their eosinophilia. Their blood cell counts are typically normal except for eosinophil numbers which range between ~2000 and 5000 cells/microliter (normal <450 cells/microliter). Peripheral blood smears revealed that eosinophils showed normal morphology, a finding distinctly different from many other types of hypereosinophilia in which blood smears commonly shown immature blood cells and eosinophils showing distinctly abnormal areas of cytoplasmic clearing. Ultrastructural changes characteristic of eosinophil activation (e.g. piecemeal degranulation of eosinophils and increases in the number of their lipid bodies), other eosinophil activation markers (e.g. elevated serum levels of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin and major basic protein), and increased expression of a marker for T cell activation, interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain, are absent in individuals with familial eosinophilia but common in other types of hypereosinophilia. = Accompanying diseases = In spite of being generally considered a benign expression of eosinophilia, isolated cases of family members with familial eosinophilia have been afflicted with tissue dysfunctions that are often associated with more pathological forms of eosinophilia. These dysfunctions include fatal endomyocardial fibrosis, valvular heart disease, and diminished motor and/or sensory function in skin areas served by peripheral nerves. Three patients with heart tissue for pathology examination had eosinophilic infiltration or fibrosis in their heart's endomyocardium. One patient who died suddenly had autopsy findings of eosinophilic infiltration not only in the heart but also in lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and meninges. It is unclear whether these tissue damages were due to primary eosinophil infiltrations or eosinophil infiltrations secondary to other causes.  Genetics  Familial eosinophilia is an autosomal dominant disorder. Genetic linkage gene mapping family studies localize the gene responsible for this disease to chromosome 5 at position q31-q33, between markers D5S642 and D5S816. Studies on other disorders associated with high levels of blood eosinophils (e.g. childhood asthma, schistosomiasis) have likewise linked eosinophilia to the q31-q33 area of chromosome 5. The 5q31-q33 region contains a cytokine gene cluster that includes genes for Interleukin 3, interleukin 5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Each of these genes functions to promote the proliferation and differentiation of eosinophil precursor cells. Nonetheless, no gene polymorphisms were found within the promoters, exons, or introns of these 3 genes or in the regions' IL-3/GM-CSF enhancer. In addition to these studies, 8 affected members of a family with familial eosinophilia had peripheral blood or bone marrow cells that carried the same chromosome abnormality, a pericentric inversion of chromosome 10, inv (10) (p11.2q21.2). The meaning and relationship, if any, of this inversion to familial eosinophilia is unclear.  Pathophysiology  Earlier studies found no evidence of abnormal blood levels of interleukin 5, interleukin 3, or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. A more recent study used a more sensitive assay for interleukin 5 to compare members of a single extended family with some members lacking the disorder. The study found that members with the disorder had: a) peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as T helper cells (major physiological source of interleukin 5), CD8+ cells, CD14+ cells, and CD19+ cells that expressed high levels of messenger RNA for interleukin 5 while their peripheral blood mononuclear cells expressed normal levels of messenger RNA for RAD50, a gene in close proximity to IL-5; b) elevated serum levels of interleukin 5 as well as soluble Interleukin 5 receptor alpha subunit; and c) innate lymphoid cells (also major physiological sources of interleukin 5) that produced increased amounts of interleukin 5 in response to stimulation. A second family with asymptomatic eosinophilia over three generations likewise exhibited increased production of interleukin 5. These studies suggest that the dis-regulated overproduction of interleukin 5 by blood mononuclear cells is an underlying cause of the eosinophilia found in at least some families with this disorder. Diagnosis The diagnosis of familial eosinophilia rest upon a) familial clustering of the disorder; b) exclusion of \\"family acquired eosinophilia\\" (i.e. eosinophilia due to chronic parasite or other infestations that afflict multiple members of a family); c) lack of eosinophil-induced tissue destruction such as that which occurs in the hypereosinophilic syndrome; d) absence of signs or symptoms of other hereditary eosinophilias (e.g. hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome, Omenn syndrome), Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome, and numerous other primary immunodeficiency syndromes); and d) lack of evidence for reactive eosinophilias (e.g. allergy-related), neoplastic eosinophilias (e.g. eosinophilic leukemia, clonal eosinophilia), or eosinophila associated with various hematological and non-hematological malignancies as outlined in causes of eosinophilia.  Treatment  Since longitudinal data, including eosinophil counts obtained over a 20- to 30-year periods in some family members, show remarkable stability in the absolute eosinophil count with no evidence of disease attributable to eosinophil-related tissue injury, therapy to lower eosinophil counts such as corticosteroids, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and antibodies directed against interleukin 5 have in general not been used to treat familial eosinophilia. One patient with severe heart damage was treated with a corticosteroid but soon thereafter died. Familial eosinophilia unassociated with possible eosinophil-related tissue injuries may not require drug treatment, those cases with such tissue injuries, it is suggested, should be considered for such interventions. In all cases, however, regular follow-up of the disorder is strongly recommended.

He is one of the pioneers of automated speech recognition and statistical spoken dialogue systems. He served as the Senior Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge from 2009 to 2015, responsible for Planning and Resources. He currently holds a joint appointment between his professorship at Cambridge and Apple, where he is a senior member of the Siri development team. Early life and education Young was born in Liverpool on 23 January 1951. He studied at the University of Cambridge, completing a BA in Electrical Sciences in 1973 and a PhD in speech recognition in 1978, under the supervision of Professor Frank Fallside at the Engineering Department. He held lectureships at both Manchester and Cambridge before being elected to the Chair of Information Engineering at Cambridge University in 1994.  Research and academic career  He is best known as the leading author of the HTK toolkit, a software package for using Hidden Markov Models to model time series, mainly used for speech recognition. Its first version was originally developed by Young at the Machine Intelligence Laboratory of the Cambridge University Engineering Department (CUED) in 1989. Due to the growing popularity of the toolkit worldwide, Microsoft decided to make the core HTK toolkit available again and licensed the software back to CUED after its acquisition of Entropic, the startup Steve co-founded in 1993 to distribute and maintain the HTK toolkit. The HTK book, which is the tutorial of the HTK toolkit, has received more than 6,000 citations. In the late nineties, Steve's research interests shifted to the design of statistical spoken dialogue systems. His most notable contribution to the field is the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) based dialogue management framework, which includes the Hidden Information State (HIS) dialogue model, the first practical dialogue management model based on the POMDP framework. His research focuses on developing spoken dialogue systems that are robust against noise introduced by noisy speech recognisers, as well as adapt and scale on-line in interaction with real users. One notable instance of this approach is the application of Gaussian process based reinforcement learning for rapid policy optimisation. In recent years, Steve's research group has successfully applied deep learning techniques to various submodules of statistical dialogue systems, winning multiple best paper awards at prestigious speech and NLP conferences. = Entrepreneurship = Apart from his academic and scientific contributions, Steve is also a successful entrepreneur. He cofounded three startups over his career: * Entropic, a speech recognition software company that developed applications for voice-enabling the web via mobile operators. The company was acquired by Microsoft in 1999. * Phonetic Arts, a speech synthesis company that delivered technology for generating natural expressive speech. The technology developed by the company allowed computer games to say various sentences with different kinds of voices. Phonetic arts was acquired by Google in 2010. * VocalIQ, a dialogue technology company that built the world's first dialogue system application programming interface. The company's technology provided a platform for voice interfaces, allowing businesses to voice-enable mobile devices and proprietary apps. VocalIQ was acquired by Apple in 2015. Young was one of the two cofounders and chairman of the company. = Awards and honours = Young is a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the RSA and the International Speech Communication Association (ISCA). He received the IEEE Signal Processing Society Technical Achievement Award in 2004, and the ISCA Medal for Scientific Achievement in 2010. He also received the European Signal Processing Society Individual Technical Achievement Award in 2013, and the IEEE James L Flanagan Speech and Audio Processing Award in 2015.

In that case the House of Lords affirmed that under English law a person could grant a mortgage or other security interest over future property, ie. property that they did not actually own at the time of granting the charge. Prior to decision, the generally accepted principle under English law was that pursuant to the nemo dat rule it was impossible for a person to convey a security interest in property which they did not own at the time of granting the charge. The case is also notable in that no less than three persons who were, or one day would be, Lord Chancellor, gave judgments. It is also a rare example of one Law Lord interrupting another during their speech to object to a point in their judgment.(1862) 10 HLC 191, 226 Background The case was decided against the backdrop of the industrial revolution in Victorian England. With the expansion of industry, companies were hungry for capital, and commercial parties were exploring new ways for these companies to raise debt finance by way of debentures. As part of that process debenture holders were seeking greater protection for themselves to protect the capital which they invested in these new ventures to ensure that, if the company failed, that they had a prior claim the company's assets over any competing creditors. Facts The underlying borrower was a businessman named James Taylor, who was engaged as a damask manufacturer at Hayes Mill, Ovenden, near Halifax, Yorkshire. The case reports that \\"[i]n 1858 he became embarrassed, [and] a sale of his effects by auction took place\\". The Holroyds purchased all of his machinery. They subsequently sold it back to him, but because he could not pay for it, the purchase price was left outstanding and a security interest was granted over the machinery. However, the indenture granting the security interest not only referred to the existing machinery, but separately to: :\\"... all machinery, implements, and things which, during the continuance of this security, shall be fixed or placed in or about the said mill, buildings, and appurtenances, in addition to or in substitution for the said premises,The \\"premises\\" being the property charged under the indenture. or any part thereof ...\\" The indenture was duly registered under the Bills of Sale Act 1854 (17 & 18 Vict, c. 36). As time passed Taylor sold and replaced some of the machinery, and bought some new machinery. On 13 April 1860 one Emil Preller sued Taylor, and Mr Garth Marshall, the high sheriff of York, executed a writ of scire facias against Taylor and machinery was seized in appropriation of the claims. On 30 May 1860 the Holroyds filed a bill for relief claiming that they had superior title. The case came initially before the Vice Chancellor, who found in favour of the Holroyds. The judgment creditors then appealed, and the case came before Lord Campbell LC, who reversed the decision. He held: :\\"My judgment rests upon Lord Bacon's maxim, 'Licet dispositio de interesse future sit inutilis, tam fieri potest declaratio pr√¶cedens quoe sortiatur effectum, interveniente novo actu.' Before any subsequent act is done, the assignment gives an equitable interest as between assignee and assignor; but a legal interest subsequently, bona fide acquired before possession taken by the equitable assignee shall prevail.(1862) 10 HLC 191, 193 The Holroyds then appealed to the House of Lords. Decision Lord Westbury LC. Lord Westbury LC, Lord Wensleydale and Lord Chelmsford each gave judgments. Lord Westbury started by noting that the respondents had conceded that if the mortgagees (the Holroyds) had an equitable interest in the added machinery then it could not be seized by them as judgment creditors. He then stated that \\"[t]he question may be easily decided by the application of a few elementary principles long settled in the Court of Equity.\\"(1862) 10 HLC 191, 209 He noted that a contract for sale of any property would immediately pass a beneficial interest in that property, and this applied not only to real estate but also to personal property. This drove him to the inevitable conclusion that: He accepted that a contract for the sale of property which does not exist at the time is law. However, he felt that there was a crucial distinction between the position at law and in equity: Therefore he concluded: Lord Wenslydale affirmed that if an agreement was specifically enforceable, then once the property was acquired, then an incohate interest in the property vested immediately. Consequences The decision had a transformative effect on security interests and the ability of companies to raise finance. It led indirectly to the decision of Giffard LJ in In re Panama, New Zealand, and Australian Royal Mail Co (1870) 5 Ch App 318 which is generally accepted as the first decision under English law to recognise a floating charge.

She belonged to the intimate circle of friends of the queen and was for a while known as one of her favorites.Hardy, B. C. (Blanche Christabel), The Princesse de Lamballe; a biography, 1908, Project Gutenberg Life She was the maternal niece of the Archbishop of Narbonne, Arthur Richard Dillon, and married her second cousin count Arthur Dillon (1750‚Äì1794) in 1768, and became the mother of Henriette-Lucy, Marquise de La Tour du Pin Gouvernet. Dillon was described as a beauty and became one of the favorite companions of Marie Antoinette and one of the close confidants she invited to her petit cabinets. To keep Dillon near her, the queen appointed her dame du palais surnum√©raire in 1780, a step which created great jealousy at court, and for a while, she was reportedly always in the queen's presence.Joan Haslip (1991). Marie Antoinette. Stockholm: Norstedts F√∂rlag AB. Like the other favorite Princesse de Lamballe, who was regarded to be affiliated with Palais Royal, Dillon was regarded to be a pawn of her uncle the Archbishop de Narbonne, to whom she was economically dependent.Joan Haslip (1991). Marie Antoinette. Stockholm: Norstedts F√∂rlag AB. She had a relationship with Henri Louis, Prince of Gu√©m√©n√© and was also an intimate friend of her lover's spouse Victoire de Rohan, who were also a personal friend of the queen, and Abb√© de Vermond reportedly reproached Marie Antoinette from keeping company with women of ill repute like Dillon and Gu√©m√©n√©.Hardy, B. C. (Blanche Christabel), The Princesse de Lamballe; a biography, 1908, Project Gutenberg Dillon was eventually taken ill in tuberculosis, which caused her death in 1782. During her illness, the queen reportedly visited her on her sick bed and daily sent for news of her friend's illness, and were reportedly devastated upon her death. However, only one day after the death of Dillon, Marie Antoinette had seemingly recovered from her sorrow and expressed a wish to go to the theater. Louise-Charlotte de Duras, who was sent to advise her against it because she was allegedly the lady-in- waiting the queen respected the most, told her that it would be better if she visited the Opera, as the way to the theater was passing near the Saint Sulpice, and she would in that case risk to run in to the funeral procession of Madame Dillon on her way.Joan Haslip (1991).

Its budget is estimated at about 2.5 million dollars. The film has many celebrity guest stars in it (i.e. Paul McCartney).  Music video  The short film includes a brand new song entitled \\"The Brain Song,\\" in which the last few minute of the short are of the music video. It starts with a picture of the brain which then starts to move. It shows you that he brain is \\"divided into two hemispheres\\" and that the left side \\"controls your right side and your left controls your right side\\" which happen to be \\"tied together\\" by the Corpus Callosum, as well showing that the brain is covered with a meninges layer, cerebral spinal fluid and afterwards you are looking at the four lobes of the brain, which compose of the Frontal, the temporal, the parietal and the occipital lobes and that they are all important. It shows you that the reason we can see things is because \\"eyes cones are sending stimuli to your thalamus, which joins up to your occipital lobe,\\" and that you can hear things when the \\"scilia down in your ear\\" vibrate and send \\"those impulses along to your temporal lobe.\\" Al then shows through a telescope how the different parts of the brain can \\"communicate with each other.\\" It shows a school of neuron, \\"a funky funky neuron,\\" which has an axxon on one side and a denox on the other side. It then shows what happens when a neuron's denox gets a signal from another neuron, it \\"sparks a chemical reaction in the nucleus,\\" which creates a \\"nerve impulse which travels down a long long myelin coated strand.\\" The neurotransmitter molecules then enter the vesicle of the axon terminal, and then the neurotransmitters \\"jump a millionth of an inch across the synaptic gap\\" which then enter into \\"the receptors of the dendrox of another neuron,\\" which connects \\"neuron to neuron to neuron to neuron all across your entire brain.\\" This also explains that the more you use your brain, the smarter you'll be. The film ends with Yankovic saying to \\"[always] wear a helmet\\".  Release  The short film was released to the public at the Orange County Fair 2009 airing from July 16 to August 15.

Language The tribe's name comes from a reduplication the word for 'no' (wati), typical of tribal names in this area. Country The Watiwati's lands enclosed some of territory north and south of the Murray River and Swan Hill. It reached northwards towards Moolpa, N.S.W. To the west its boundary lay at Piangil in Victoria. To the east were the related Wemba-Wemba, north east the Nari-Nari, north northwest the Muthi Muthi, and to their west the Tatitati. Social structure The Watiwati were formed of several clans, one horde called the Dacournditch was located in the area between Tyntynder and Swan Hill. Mythology According to A. L. P. Cameron, the Watiwati believed that the first inhabitants of the earth, all endowed with a capacity for metamorphosis into other animal species, were called Bukumurri, who were changed into ordinary men by Thathapuli, the dreamtime creator spirit. Fire had been the exclusive possession of Pandowinda, the cod fish. After a while, Pandowinda passed the secret of fire-making to the rakali water rat, Kerambin, on condition that the latter would cook for him. Other Bukumurri were deeply disgruntled at the arrangement, and convened a meeting, presided over by the native bat, Rakur to work out how to steal the secret. The task was delegated to the hawk Keridka, who twice dispatched strong winds to make spread the fire being used by Pandowinda and his offkick, Kerambin. On each occasion, his attempt failed. A third attempt, with a powerful whirlwind succeeding, despite prodigious efforts to snuff them out, succeeded, and a wuildfire burnt out over the forests to create the plains of the Riverina. While the others rejoiced that the fire was now accessible, only Rakur went about, clearing the fire from some trees, and spiriting ashes in the clefts to keep the flame, as they others mocked his efforts. When a rainstorm doused the conflagration he made them realize the folly of their ridicule, and he taught them to rub sticks together and coax the flames out of the concealed embers. A very old Watitwati told Cameron of what happens to a man's soul, once he dies. Initially it wanders about I n a dazed state, confused by its new surroundings. Bumbling along a path, it comes to a fork, one track coveted with hindrances, being overgrown with brambles, the other offering an easier prospect. The good man's soul would choose the harder track, knowing the unencumbered route would be rife with perils. Some way on, it comes upon two women, one haggishly ugly, the other young and enticing. The old woman warns him not to be cajoled by the charms of the young woman. Further on, it encounters a chasm, brimming with flames, and the soul springs over it as the flames recede. It comes upon a rope drawn across the path by two women who endeavour to trip him up. Once this obstacle is negotiated, it arrives among the blessed, but even there the trial is not ended, as it was endure a period of probation with a special diet, and subjected to testing challenges. Lastly, it is placed at a spot where fleet emus race past, and given a spear, and told to spear one if he is to finally meet the maker. In Wati lore, shooting stars are the traces of spears thrown by souls as they try to hit the emus and, if successful, encounter their high being, Thathapuli.

Biography  Reine Flachot arrived in France at the age of twelve when her French parents returned home. There, she began her studies with Jean Dumont and then, in 1935, entered the Conservatoire de Paris in the class of G√©rard Hekking. At the age of fifteen or sixteen, she was awarded several prizes (1st prize of cello in 1938) and entered the concerts Colonne for which she performed the Cello Concerto by √âdouard Lalo. There followed a career that made her the ambassador of the \\"French school of cello for sixty years\\" (Christine Heurtefeux) all over the world, with a strong activity between the end of the 1950s and the beginning of the 1970s, a period from which she devoted much time to the transmission of her knowledge. During these years, she served in particular the works of Darius Milhaud (Suite Cisalpine, 1954), Charles Brown (Concerto pour violoncelle et orchestre, 1956), Pierre-Max Dubois (Concerto pour violoncelle et orchestre, 1958), Francis Miroglio (Sonate pour violoncelle et piano, 1961), √âmile Mawet (Concerto pour violoncelle et orchestre, 1965), Aram Khachaturian (Concerto- Rhapsodie, 1967), Andr√© Jolivet (Concerto pour violoncelle et orchestre, 1971), Henri Sauguet (Sonate pour violoncelle, 1972... At the same time, Reine Flachot became a pedagogue. In 1966, she joined the √âcole normale de musique de Paris, which she left in 1970 for the Centre musical international of Annecy before the T≈çh≈ç Gakuen called her. She stayed there until 1974, when she joined the City of Basel Music Academy, while continuing her studies at the ENM in Paris and becoming the first woman named cello teacher (CNSM de Lyon). She ceased all teaching activities in 1995. That same year, she gave her last concerts in Japan, preferring to withdraw. \\"I prefer,\\" she said, \\"to leave a beautiful picture of me and I'm tired.\\" She was then 73 years old and ended a career having led her to choose with restraint her discographic production (4 recordings).

She won one minor race from three starts as a two-year-old in 2016, but made considerable improvement in the following spring and won the 1000 Guineas on her fifth racecourse appearance. She went on to record further Group 1 victories in the Irish 1,000 Guineas, Coronation Stakes and Nassau Stakes. Background Winter is a grey filly bred in Ireland by the Laddies Poker Two Syndicate, a horse breeding company associated with the Coolmore Stud. The filly was sent into training with David Wachman at Goolds Cross, County Tipperary. Like many Coolmore horses, the official details of her ownership have changed from race to race but she is usually described as being owned by a partnership of Derrick Smith, Michael Tabor and Susan Magnier. She has been ridden in all of her races by Wayne Lordan. She was sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo is now one of the world's leading stallions and has been champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland eight times so far. His other progeny include Cape Blanco, Frankel, Golden Lilac, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Found, Minding and Ruler of the World. Winter's dam Laddies Poker Two, from whom she inherited her grey colour, was a lightly raced sprinter best known for winning the Wokingham Stakes at Royal Ascot as a five-year-old in 2010. She was a great granddaughter of the Prix Morny winner Ancient Regime, who was closely related to Scottish Rifle and many other good winners descended from the British broodmare Radiopye (foaled 1954). Racing career =2016: two- year-old season= Winter began her racing career on 11 May in a maiden race over six furlongs at Naas Racecourse in which she finished third to Cuff and Wayside Flower after struggling to obtain a clear run in the closing stages. After a break of more than two months she returned for a maiden over one mile at Gowran Park in July, and started favourite but ran disappointingly, finishing third to Butterflies. On 14 August the filly started 7/4 favourite for a maiden over seven furlong at Dundalk Racecourse and recorded her first success, taking the lead inside the last quarter mile and winning by one and a quarter lengths from Dreamy Gal. When Wachman retired from training at the end of the season, Winter was transferred to the stable of Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. =2017: three-year-old season= Spring Winter began her second season in a strong renewal of the Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes on 8 April. After chasing the leaders in the early stages she stayed on strongly to finish second, beaten a head by her stablemate Hydrangea with Intricately (winner of the Moyglare Stud Stakes) in fourth and the favourite Promise To Be True (second in the Prix Marcel Boussac) in sixth place. The filly's performance attracted little immediate attention, but at the start of May she began to attract considerable support for the 1000 Guineas, being backed down from 33/1 to 10/1 in the ante-post betting market. On 7 May Winter was one of fourteen fillies to contest the 204th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket Racecourse. Rhododendron (alo trained by O'Brien) started the 5/4 favourite ahead of Daban (Nell Gwyn Stakes) and Fair Eva (Princess Margaret Stakes), with Winter next in the betting on 9/1 alongside Hydrangea. The other runners included Intricately, Queen Kindly (Lowther Stakes), Poets Vanity (Oh So Sharp Stakes) and the highly regarded maiden winner Talaayeb. After meeting some interference in the early stages Wayne Lordan settled the filly in mid division before producing Winter with a strong run down the center of the track to take the lead two furlongs out. Winter kept on well and never looked in serious danger of defeat, winning by two lengths and a neck from Rhododendron and Daban. After the race Lordan said \\"I went forward quite early because she's a filly that gallops and I knew the track would suit her. This means a lot. I'm very grateful to Aidan for letting me keep the ride on the filly\\". Three weeks after her win at Newmarket, Winter, ridden by Ryan Moore, started the 8/13 favourite for the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh. Hydrangea and Intricately were again in opposition whilst the other five runners included Rehana (Athasi Stakes) and Roly Poly (Duchess of Cambridge Stakes). After being settled in fourth place, Winter took the lead inside the last quarter mile and drew away to win \\"easily\\" by four and three quarter lengths from Roly Poly. Moore commented \\"It was very easy. She gave me a lovely ride and it was very straightforward. She was relentless.\\" Summer At Royal Ascot on 23 June Winter attempted to become only the second filly (after Attraction) to follow up wins in the English and Irish 1,000 Guineas with a success in the Coronation Stakes. Hydrangea and Roly Poly were again in the field, but her biggest dangers appeared to come from the French filly Precieuse (Poule d'Essai des Pouliches) and the John Gosden-trained Dabyah (Fred Darling Stakes), whilst the other two runners were La Coronel from Canada (Appalachian Stakes) and Tomyris (Michael Seely Memorial Stakes). Starting the 4/9 favourite, Winter took the lead in the straight and won by two and a quarter lengths and a neck from Roly Poly and Hydrangea. Aidan OBrien said \\"She's a filly who is thriving from race-to- race, she travelled well, Ryan had her in a lovely position and she's won very well. She gets the trip very well, she's very classy and is a great traveller. When you ask her she gallops out strong\\" before stating that the Breeders' Cup at Del Mar would be her end-of-season target. On 3 August at Goodwood Racecourse Winter was moved up in distance and matched against older fillies and mares in the ten-furlong Nassau Stakes, a race for which she started 10/11 favourite. Hydrangea was again among her rivals while the other four runners were Queen's Trust (Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf), Sobetsu (Prix Saint- Alary), So Mi Dar (Musidora Stakes) and Blond Me (Topkapi Trophy). Running on soft ground she raced close behind the leaders, took the lead a furlong out, and kept on well to win \\"quite comfortably\\" by one and a half lengths from Blond Me. O'Brien expressed his satisfaction with the fily saying \\"She‚Äôll be happier back on good ground but she's a good bit bigger and stronger than she was. That ground was like National Hunt ground. She should be ready for the second half of the season and getting a mile and a quarter that well leaves an awful lot of options open to her\\".

Along with her brothers, Orson Squire Fowler and Lorenzo Niles Fowler, her sister-in-law, Lydia Folger Fowler, and her husband, Samuel Roberts Wells, she was an early American popularizer of phrenology. Wells founded Fowler & Wells Company, published the American Phrenological Journal, and taught the first class in phrenology in the United States. She died at her home in New Jersey in 1901. Early life and education Charlotte Fowler was born in Cohocton, New York, August 14, 1814. She was the fourth in a family of eight children. Her father, Horace Fowler, was a deacon and judge. Her mother, Martha Howe, was an intellectual, who died when Wells was five years old, but her teachings left a lasting impression upon the daughter. Wells received most of her education in the district school, with only two winters of three months each of instruction in the Franklin Academy in Prattsburgh, New York, beginning in autumn 1831. She was otherwise self-taught, with a wide range of reading. Her older brothers, Orson and Lorenzo, were among the first to examine and believe the doctrines of Franz Joseph Gall and Johann Spurzheim. The increasing interest in the science of phrenology was greatly the result of the brothers' lifelong work. Career Wells studied and became interested in Spurzheim's works, teaching the first class in phrenology in the United States, and thereafter, her life was devoted to promoting it. Urged by her brothers, she closed her school in 1837, and joined them in New York City in the family-run business of O.S. & L.N. Fowler, a lecture bureau, museum, and publishing house, where she served as proofreader, writer, business manager, and editor. She also maintained the organization's cabinet and was also instrumental in keeping the permanent offices from being abandoned. When Orson was in the field lecturing, and Lorenzo was establishing a branch in London, England, she had charge of the business in New York, and was considered instrumental in its success. Samuel Roberts Wells (1820‚Äì1875) was studying to be a doctor when he attended a course of lectures delivered by the Fowler brothers in Boston. He was impressed with the theme and resolved to investigate it, his first ideas of phrenology having been obtained as a boy from a chart which had been marked by Charlotte Fowler, then in her teens. In 1843, he joined the Fowler brothers's institute, and in the following year, he formed a co-partnership with the Fowler brothers, at their Nassau Street, New York office, the name having been changed to Fowler & Wells. Wells organized the book business and gave a new impetus to the Phrenological Journal. On October 13, 1844, Charlotte and Samuel were married. The Wells worked together for 31 years. For long periods of time, she was left with the control of the entire business, while her husband and brothers were traveling through countries, spreading the science and items for their cabinet. After Lorenzo moved to England in 1855, the firm's ownership passed to the Wells. After the husband's death in 1875, she became the sole proprietor and manager for nine years. In 1884, she formed a stock company, Fowler & Wells Company, of which she was president, and published the American Phrenological Journal. She also served as vice- president and one of the instructors of the American Institute of Phrenology. In addition, in 1863, she was one of the founders, and served as a trustee of the New York Medical College for Women. Personal life Wells believed in spiritualism. From 1884, she made her home in West Orange, New Jersey where she died June 4, 1901, due to degeneration of the heart. Wells was buried at Rosedale Cemetery, in Orange, New Jersey. Her papers are held by the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections of Cornell University Library.

Typically, a valley formed by glaciers has a series of basins with intervening steps formed by the locally varying erosion depths of valley glaciers. After the ice melts, this initially becomes a sequence of lakes with intermediate rapids or waterfalls. The transportation of gravels, erosion and sedimentation processes in the streams lead to the formation of sequences of flat valley bottoms and gorges. Typical valley step in a trough valley (Vilsalptal, Allg√§u Alps). In the foreground its U-shape is almost filled in; behind is a gentle ravine Such basin forms, with an abrupt beginning, often appear as marked steps, which may separate the flatter sections of the valley. Large steps were often formed where the erosion forces of the glacier that once filled the valley were suddenly increased, for instance, when large glaciers merged. They are then referred to as confluence steps. Similar steps are formed when moving sheets of ice merge into glacial streams, which can intensify surface scouring of the rocks (exaration). If these valley steps are close to the upper end of a valley, they are also referred to as a valley head or trough head; otherwise, they subdivide the course of the valley into often very distinct individual valley sections, with gentler and broader hollows alternating, chain-like, with and narrow intermediate valleys or gorges. In the interior of mountain ranges, these valleys dictate the structure of settlements, and may result in isolated communities that are difficult to access. Side valleys, which rise high above the valley floor in a trough valley, also join the main valley at a marked step in the terrain, the stream descending over the valley wall of the main valley. This is referred to as a hanging valley, and the step is seen geomorphologically as the valley wall of the main valley, so it is not a valley stage in the narrow sense described above. Borderline cases are, for example, cirques, which typically form basins in which there is often a lake which either drains periodically over the valley threshold or seeps entirely into the subsoil. Valley steps may also have existed before the glaciation of mountainous terrain or may be formed without the aid of glacial processes, typically due to varying erosion resistance of the rock, or due to active faults. These are then only accentuated by glacial and / or fluvial erosion. Examples of this are the tobel valleys in sandstones or, often only underground, draining troughs in the limestone, where the valley step is formed by downward erosion. Valleys that were formed without the aid of glaciers are often found in the area of cuestas. These can then also create a very characteristic structure of a river course in its lower reaches on the broad plains and form a significant obstacle to navigation.

It is a means by which a person may be held liable for copyright infringement even though he or she did not directly engage in the infringing activity. In the United States, the Copyright Act does not itself impose liability for contributory infringement expressly. It is one of the two forms of secondary liability apart from 'vicarious liability'. Contributory infringement is understood to be a form of infringement in which a person is not directly violating a copyright but, induces or authorises another person to directly infringe the copyright. This doctrine is a development of general tort law and is an extension of the principle in tort law that in addition to the tortfeasor, anyone who contributed to the tort should also be held liable.  Requirements  The requirements for fulfilling the threshold of contributory infringement and imposing liability for copyright infringement on a party areGershwin Publishing Corp. v. Columbia Artists Management, Inc., 443 F.2d 1159, 1162 (2d Cir. 1971).\\\\- # The defendant having knowledge of a direct infringement; and # The defendant materially contributing to that infringement. Contributory infringement leads to imposition of liability in two situations. First situation is when the defendant, through his conduct, assists in the infringement, and the second situation is when the means for facilitating the infringement such as machinery is provided by the defendant.Matthew Bender & Co. v. West Publ'g Co., 158 F.3d 693, 706 (2d Cir. 1998) = Knowledge = The knowledge requirement for contributory infringement is an objective assessment and stands fulfilled if the defendant has actual or constructive knowledge of an infringement, i.e., if he or she has reason to believe that an infringement is taking place.Sega Enters. Ltd. v. MAPHIA, 948 F. Supp. 923, 933 (N.D. Cal. 1996) But, constructive knowledge need not be imputed to the defendant if the product was capable of significant noninfringing uses.Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 (1984) = Material contribution = Material contribution is the second requirement of contributory infringement. For instance, merely providing facilities or the site for an infringement might amount to material contribution.Fonovisa, 76 F.3d at 264 But, some courts put emphasis on the contribution to be 'substantial' and therefore, would hold that providing equipment and facilities for infringement is not in itself determinative of material contribution.Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 821 F. Supp. 616, 625 (N.D. Cal. 1993)  Difference from vicarious liability  Vicarious liability is another form of secondary liability for copyright infringement through which a person who himself has not directly infringed a copyright can, nevertheless, be held liable. The requirements for attracting vicarious liability under copyright law are- # The defendant had the right to control the infringing activity; and # The defendant derives a financial or commercial benefit from the infringement Unlike contributory infringement, vicarious liability can be imposed even in the absence of any intent or knowledge on part of the defendant. In the Napster case, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit observed: \\"In the context of copyright law, vicarious liability extends beyond an employer/employee relationship to cases in which a defendant \\"has the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity and also has a direct financial interest in such activities.\\"  In the United States  In the United States of America, the doctrine of contributory infringement is based on the 1911 case of Kalem v Harper Brothers.Kalem v. Harper Brothers, 222 U.S. 55 (1911). The ingredients of contributory infringement were laid down in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Gershwin Publishing Corp v Columbia Artists Management Inc.443 F.2d 1159, 1162 (2d Cir. 1971). in which the court said that contributory infringement is said to happen when someone, with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes, or materially contributes to the infringing conduct of another. This doctrine was developed in the context of the 1909 Copyright Act which did not have any reference to contributory infringement. But, the 1976 Act recognised the exclusive right of a copyright owner 'to do and to authorize' the rights attached to a copyright enumerated in the Act.17 U.S.C. ¬ß 106 The words 'to authorize' were meant to bring contributory infringements within the purview of the Act. But, still, the Act did not specify the requirements of such forms of infringement and left its application to the discretion of courts. = Sony Betamax case = The case of Sony Corp v Universal City Studios Inc,464 U.S. 417 (1984). commonly known as the Betamax case, gave the United States Supreme Court its first opportunity to comprehensively look into and interpret the rules regarding secondary liability and contributory infringement in context of the 1976 Copyright statute. The primary issue in this case was whether a VCR manufacturing company could be held liable for copyright infringements done by its customers. The court held that secondary liability for copyright infringements was not a foreign concept to US Copyright law and it was well enshrined in the copyright law of the United States. In the court's own words But, in this case, the Court held that Sony did not have actual knowledge of the infringing activities of its customers. At the most it could be argued that Sony had constructive knowledge of the fact that \\"its customers may use that equipment to make unauthorised copies of copyrighted material.\\"464 U.S. 417 (1984). at 439 The court then relied on the \\"staple article of commerce\\" doctrine of patent law and applied it to copyrights. The 'staple article of commerce' defence is available under Patent law in the United States and it lays down that when an infringing article is capable of 'substantial non infringing uses', it would become a 'staple article of commerce' and therefore, not attract any liability for infringement. Based on this reasoning, it was held Since the Betamax was capable of \\"significant noninfringing uses\\", Sony was not held liable for contributory infringement. = Contributory infringement in P2P services = Contributory infringement has been the central issue in the cases involving 'peer to peer' services such as Napster, Aimster, Grokster and Morpheus. The courts have applied the Sony Betamax ratio differently in all these cases. For instance, Napster was held liable for contributory infringement. But, a similar service like Grokster was not held liable for contributory infringement as in this case, a district court, grounding its reasoning on the Sony Betamax decision, held that secondary liability could not be applied to peer to peer services.  A&M; Records v Napster  Napster was the first peer to peer service to be subject to copyright infringement litigation. In the Napster case,239 F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 2001) the issue was regarding the infringement of copyrights through the 'Music Share' software of Napster. Whenever, this software was used on a computer system, it would collect information about the MP3 files stored on the computer and send it to Napster servers. Based on this information, the Napster created a centralised index of files available for download on the Napster network. When someone wanted to download that file, the Music Share software would use the Napster index to locate the user who already had that file on their system and then connect the two users directly to facilitate the download of the MP3 file, without routing the file through Napster's servers.239 F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 2001) at 1012. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found Napster liable for both \\"contributory infringement\\" and \\"vicarious infringement\\". Regarding the issue of contributory infringement, the court held that Napster had \\"actual knowledge\\" of infringing activity, and providing its software and services to the infringers meant that it had \\"materially contributed\\" to the infringement. It was held that the defence in Sony was of \\"limited assistance to Napster\\". The test whether a technology is capable of substantial non infringing uses was relevant only for imputing knowledge of infringement to the technology provider. But, in Napster's case, it was found that Napster had \\"actual, specific knowledge of direct infringement\\", and therefore, the Sony test would not be applicable.  In Re Aimster  In In re Aimster,334 F.3d 643 (7th Cir. 2003) the Seventh Circuit was called upon to decide the liability of peer to peer sharing of music files through the Instant Messaging services provided by Aimster. Aimster had argued that the transmission of files between its users was encrypted and because of that, Aimster could not possibly know the nature of files being transmitted using its services. But, the Seventh circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the district court which had issued a preliminary injunction against Aimster. It was found that Aimster had knowledge of the infringing activity. Its tutorial showed examples of copyrighted music files being shared.334 F.3d 643 (7th Cir. 2003) at 649. Also, the 'Club Aimster' service provided a list of 40 most popular songs made available on the service.334 F.3d 643 (7th Cir. 2003) at 651. It was also held that the encrypted nature of the transmission was not a valid defence as it was merely a means to avoid liability by purposefully remaining ignorant. It was held that 'wilful blindness is knowledge, in copyright law..\\"334 F.3d 643 (7th Cir. 2003) at 650. The Sony defence raised by Aimster was also rejected because of the inability of Aimster to bring on record any evidence to show that its service could be used for non infringing uses. Lastly, Aimster could also not get benefit of DMCA 'safe harbor' provisions because it had not done anything to comply with the requirements of Section 512. Instead, it encouraged infringement.  MGM Studios v Grokster  The District Court for the Central District of California, in MGM Studios v Grokster,545 U.S. 913 (2005) held that the peer to peer services Morpheus and Grokster were not liable for copyright infringements carried out by their users. Unlike Napster, these services did not maintain a centralised index. Instead, they created ad hoc indices known as supernodes on the users computers. Sometimes, the software operated without creating any index at all. Thus, it was held that Grokster and Morpheus had no way of controlling the behaviour of their users once their software had been sold, just like Sony did with Betamax. It was found that the defendants did have knowledge of infringement because of the legal notices sent to them. But, it was also held that to attract liability under contributory infringement, there should be knowledge of a specific infringement at the precise moment when it would be possible for the defendant to limit such infringement.545 U.S. 913 (2005) at 1037. Also, it was found that there was no material contribution. For this, the court relied on Sony and compared the technology to that of a VCR or a photocopier to hold that the technology was capable of both infringing as well as non infringing uses. Grokster differs from Sony, as it looks at the intent of the defendant rather than just the design of the system. As per Grokster, a plaintiff must show that the defendant actually induced the infringement. The test was reformulated as \\"one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.\\" = Digital Millennium Copyright Act = The Digital Millennium Copyright Act's Title II, known as the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act, provides a safe harbor for online service providers and internet service providers against secondary liability for copyright infringements provided that certain requirements are met.17 U.S. Code ¬ß 512 Most importantly, the service provider must expeditiously take down or limit access to infringing material on its network if it receives a notification of an infringement.17 U.S. Code ¬ß 512(b)(E) = Inducing Infringements of Copyright Bill = The Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act, or the INDUCE Act, was a 2004 proposal in the United States Senate which meant to insert a new subsection '(g)' to the existing Section 501 of the copyright Act which defines 'infringement'. The proposed amendment would provide that whoever intentionally induces a violation of subsection (a) would be liable as an infringer. The term 'intentionally induces' has been defined in the bill as- \\"intentionally aids, abets, induces, or procures, and intent may be shown by acts from which a reasonable person would find intent to induce infringement based upon all relevant information about such acts then reasonably available to the actor, including whether the activity relies on infringement for its commercial viability\\".  In the European Union  In the European Union, the European Court of Justice has issued several rulings on related matters, mainly based on the InfoSoc Directive and E-Commerce Directive and focused on what constitutes an act of \\"communication to the public\\" or of \\"making available\\".  In India  Section 51 of the Copyright Act, 1957 deals with copyright infringement in India. Section 51(a)(i) provides for when an infringement of a copyright is deemed to have taken place. It states that when somebody does anything, the exclusive right to which is conferred on a copyright owner, without first securing a license to do so from the copyright owner or in contravention of a licence, the copyright shall be deemed to have been infringed. The basis for contributory infringement under Indian copyright law can be found in Section 51(a)(ii) which states that when someone 'permits for profit any place to be used for the communication of the work to the public where such communication constitutes an infringement of the copyright in the work, unless he was not aware and had no reasonable ground for believing that such communication to the public would be an infringement of copyright', then also, the copyright shall be deemed to have been infringed. Secondary infringement itself can be sub divided into two categories- activities which assist primary infringements, and activities which accentuate the effects of the primary infringement. Section 51(a)(ii) deals with cases in which somebody assist the primary infringement. Section 51(a)(ii) itself gives the defence which can be taken by a defendant to avoid liability under this provision, i.e., the defendant was not aware or had no reasonable ground for believing that the communication to the public would be an infringement of the copyright. Section 51(b) deals with situations in which the effects of an already existing primary infringement are accentuated by the actions of the defendant. Section 51(b) provides that a copyright infringement will also be deemed to have taken place if a person sells, distributes, imports or exhibits in public by way of trade an infringing copy of a copyright protected work. Therefore, Section 51(a)(ii) and Section 51(b) are the statutory basis for secondary liability in India including contributory infringement. = Information Technology Act, 2000 = The Information Technology Act, 2000 (\\"IT Act\\") contains specific provisions dealing with liabilities of Internet Service Providers. These provisions provide for 'safe harbors' for Internet Service Providers. Section 2(w) of the IT Act defines an 'intermediary' as 'intermediary with respect to any particular electronic message means any person who on behalf of another person receives, stores or transmits that message or provides any service with respect to that message'. Due to this wide definition, almost every entity, including ISPs, search engines and online service providers can get benefit of the safe harbor provisions in the IT Act.Aakanksha Kumar, Internet Intermediary (ISP) Liability for Contributory Copyright Infringement in USA and India: Lack of Uniformity as a Trade Barrier, Journal of Intellectual Property Rights Vol 19, July 2014, pp 272-281. Section 79 of the IT Act provides that an intermediary shall not be liable for any third party information, data, or communication link made available or hosted by the intermediary. But, an intermediary will get benefit of the safe harbor provisions only if it satisfies certain conditions. The intermediaries function should be limited to providing access to a communication system, the intermediary should not initiate the transmission, select the receiver or modify the transmission and should observe the guidelines formulated by the Central Government in this regard.Section 79(2), Copyright Act, 1957. The 'IT (Intermediary guidelines) Rules 2011' have been formulated to specify the conditions that an intermediary must satisfy to get protection of safe harbor provisions. As per these guidelines, the intermediary must observe due diligence measures specified under Rule 3 of the guidelines. For instance, the intermediary should take down any infringing material on its network within thirty six hours of the infringement being brought to its notice.  My Space Inc. vs Super Cassettes Industries Ltd.  In December, 2016, the Delhi High Court reversed the judgement passed by a single judge bench earlier to hold that unless 'actual knowledge' was proved, an intermediary could not be held liable for contributory copyright infringement. In 2008, T-Series (Super Cassettes) had instituted a copyright infringement suit against MySpace for hosting infringing material in which Super Cassettes was the copyright owner, without first obtaining a licence.FAO(OS) 540/2011 (available at https://indiankanoon.org/doc/12972852/) The infringing material primarily consisted of sound recordings. It was alleged that MySpace was commercially exploiting the works of T Series by including advertisements with the works made available by it. The Single Judge had held that MySpace was guilty of copyright infringement under Section 51 of the copyright Act and the benefit of safe harbor provisions under Section 79 of the IT Act were not available to it in light of Section 81 of the IT Act. The judgment of the single judge was reversed on the following grounds- * No Actual Knowledge Liability under Section 51(a)(ii) can be avoided by the defendant if he or she is able to show that he or she did not have any knowledge of the infringing act or that he or she did not have any reason to believe that the communication would amount to an infringement. Super Cassettes had argued that 'place' under Section 51(a)(ii) includes a virtual space similar to the one provided by MySpace. It was argued that MySpace had knowledge of the infringement based on the fact that it had incorporated safeguard tools to weed out infringing material and that it invited users to upload and share content. Therefore, it was argued that there was implied knowledge. The Court held that to qualify as knowledge there should be awareness in the form of \\"actual knowledge\\" as opposed to just general awareness.Without specific knowledge of infringements, the intermediary could not be said to have reason yo believe that it was carrying infringing material. Therefore, there was a duty on the plaintiff to first identify specific infringing material before knowledge could be imputed to the defendant. * Safe Harbor under Section 79 of IT Act Section 79 of the IT Act provides safe harbor to intermediaries provided certain conditions are met by them. But, Section 81 of the IT Act also states that nothing in the IT Act shall restrict the rights of any person under the Copyright Act, 1957. The single judge had interpreted Section 81 to mean that safe harbor under IT Act is not applicable in cases of Copyright Infringement. The Court reversed this and held that Section 79 starts with a non obstante clause and precludes the application of any other law including Copyright law. Thus, any restriction on safe harbor provisions such as Section 81 can be read only within the limits of Section 79. Also, the IT Act and the Copyright Act should be construed harmoniously given their complementary nature. Further, MySpace's role was limited to providing access to a communication system. It only modified the format and not the content and even this was an automated process. Therefore, there was no material contribution also. To amount to an infringement under Section 51 of the Copyright Act, the authorisation to do something which was part of an owner's exclusive rights requires more than merely providing the means or place for communication. To be held liable for being an infringer on the grounds of authorisation, it was necessary to show active participation or inducement. Therefore, Section 79 is available in cases of copyright infringement also provided the conditions under the Act and Intermediary Guidelines, 2011 are fulfilled. Since MySpace had fulfilled these requirements, it was given the protection of Section 79 of IT Act.

Her work was nationally and internationally acclaimed. Characterized by bold colors, thick textures, and mixed media, her paintings center largely on the following themes and genres: Everyday community life and popular manifestations in S√£o Paulo, particularly in the neighborhoods of Brasil√¢ndia and Casa Verde; Afro-Brazilian religions, specifically Candombl√©, Trinidad Orisha, and Umbanda; self-portraits in which she represents herself as an artist, a bride, and a woman living with cancer; intimacy and affection between women; and urban and rural life.  Life  Maria Auxiliadora and her family moved to the city of S√£o Paulo when she was only three years old. She stopped going to school at age 12 to help out her family by working as a housekeeper, only returning to get an education in 1972, at age 37. She is one of 18 siblings, many of whom are also artists who exhibited their works at art fairs in Embu das Artes and in Rep√∫blica Square, in S√£o Paulo. Other artists in the Silva family include the sculptor Vicente Paulo da Silva (1930-1980); the painters Benedito da Silva (1953-1998), C√¢ndido Silva (1933) and Concei√ß√£o Aparecida Silva (1938); the poet Nat√°lia Natalice da Silva (1948); the painter and dollmaker Georgina \\"Gina\\" Penha da Silva (1949); and the story teller Efig√™nia Ros√°rio da Silva (1937). Their mother, Maria Trindade de Almeida Silva (1909-1991) was also an artist, working with sculpture, painting, poetry and embroidery. Their father, Jos√© C√¢ndido da Silva, was a railroad handy man that played the accordion. In 1972, she was diagnosed with cancer, undergoing six surgeries in 10 months, and treatment in spiritist and candombl√© centers. She never stopped painting, and portrayed aspects of her illness and medical care through her painting, including representations hospitals, ambulances, angels, and funerals. Maria Auxiliadora died of cancer on August 20, 1974.  Artistic career  Maria Auxiliadora did not have any formal training in the arts. She learned embroidery from her mother at age 9 and began drawing with charcoal at age 14. By 16, she was using colored pencils and guache, only moving on to oil painting by 26. In 1967 she dedicated herself exclusively to painting. In 1968, along with some of her siblings, she joined the artist group spearheaded by the artist, musician and poet Solano Trindade in Embu das Artes, S√£o Paulo. In the same year, she participated in multiple shows in the state of S√£o Paulo, winning first prize at the V Art Exhibit of Embu das Artes. By the early 1970s she became discontent with the art scene in Embu, which was losing its focus on Afro-Brazilian art and culture. She moved back to the city of S√£o Paulo and began exhibiting her works at Rep√∫blica Square. There, she met the German marchand Werner Arnhold and the Brazilian art critic M√°rio Schemberg. The latter introduced her to the consul for the American Embassy, Alan Fisher, who organized a show of her works in the Embassy's Library in 1971. During the 1970s, she gained popularity in Europe as her work circulated through art fairs and galleries in Basel, D√ºsseldorf and Paris. In 1971, Pierre Bouvet, the director of the Mus√©e d'Art Na√Øf et des Arts Singuliers, acquired her paintings for their collections.  Technique  Maria Auxiliadora chronicled day-by-day life in her paintings. She used acrylic paint in bold colors, emphasizing with three-dimensionality parts of the human body and of the landscapes. In an interview to Lea Coelho Frota in 1972, the artist says that her first paintings in 1968 were flat, with no texture. She started playing with dimensionality, adding thick layers of paint or plaster mixed with her own hair when painting figures. Around the same time, she starts exploring with the use of text, writing dialogues out of the mouths of the figures she painted in the style of comics.  Critical recognition  Auxiliadora gained more notoriety after her death, particularly overseas. A book about her work was published by the Italian publisher Giulio Bolaffi in 1977, with contributions by Max Fourny, the director of the Mus√©e d‚Äôart na√Øf de Vicq en √éle-de-France, Emanuel von Lauenstein Massarani, a cultural attache of Brasil in Switzerland, and Pietro Maria Bardi, a director of the Museum of Art of S√£o Paulo (MASP). Tribute solo shows were organized in Italy, France and Germany, as well as in MASP and the National Museum of Fine Arts, in Rio de Janeiro. Because of her hybridism of painting and reliefs, Leia Coelho Frota considered Auxiliadora's visual expression as bordering on pop art, while Massarani characterized her work as being in the border of art na√Øf and art brut, far from social and cultural conformity. In recent years, MASP has reconsidered her work beyond these \\"paternalistic and reductive categories,\\" instead focusing on the ways in which Auxiliadora's art functions as a political intervention that demands how art can represent non-dominant cultures.

She was a pioneer of swimming in South America.  Biography  Lilian Harrison was born in Quilmes, is a city in the , in 1904, within a family of British immigrants. As a child, when she has 8 years old, she went to England to attend school at Hertfordshire, where she learns to swim.Eduardo McCallum, 'Gema de Plata,' N√°utico N¬∫ 265 (2009): 62-65, pp. 62-63. She returned to Argentina in 1920, when she was 16 years old, and started to swim in the Club N√°utico San Isidro, where she was coached by Gunther Weber, with whom she started to prepare for a crossing of the River Plate. She was assisted in her training by Vito Dumas, Romero Maciel and Enrique Tirabocchi, among others.  World record  Her first big endurance test was the 67 kilometer (41.2 miles) Z√°rate-Tigre raid, down the Paran√° River, on February 4, 1923. Completing this swim, she established a world female record of permanence in the water of 21 hours and 20 minutes.Eduardo McCallum, 'Gema de Plata,' N√°utico N¬∫ 265 (2009): 62-65, pp. 63.  First crossing of the River Plate  Lilian Harrison, arriving at Punta Lara, on December 22, 1923; Cover of El Gr√°fico. In 1923 she embarked on the crossing of the River Plate. Until then, nine attempts to cross the River Plate had been made. But these attempts, by swimmers Enrique Tirabocchi, Luis Garramendy, Elio P√©rez, Romero Maciel and Vito Dumas, had failed. Of these, Dumas had been the one who resisted longest in the water (25 hours and 17 minutes), while Maciel was the swimmer who covered the longest distance, abandoning his attempt when he was only 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) short of his point of destination. Lilian Harrison started her crossing on December 21, 1923, from the port of Colonia, in Uruguay, at 9:28 in the morning. During the first stretch, she was accompanied by uruguayan swimmers Caracciolo and Graneri, and had to struggle during three hours against the current pushing them back toward the uruguayan coast. Then she headed toward the south, accompanied by Tiraboschi and Wernotri. At 15:30 she drank some orange juice, at 17 a coffee, and at 18:30 a lump of sugar. As night fell, her team realized that they had not brought reflectors, an error that could have boomed the crossing but that was partially compensated by the moon light, From 1 o'clock until 4 a.m. she swam alone. At 4:30 the argentine coast was seen from the boats that were accompanying her. At that moment she was about to abandon, given that she was exhausted. But she managed to continue when she was told that she was 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) away from her goal. She touched shore on the argentine side of the River Plate at 9:47 in the morning, on the Playa Colorada, close to the Punta Lara. She had covered 48 kilometers (29.8 miles) in 24 hours and 19 minutes.Eduardo McCallum, 'Gema de Plata,' N√°utico N¬∫ 265 (2009): 62-65 , y Eduardo McCallum, 'Lilian, la Primera reina del Plata,' N√°utico N¬∫ 266 (2009): 52-61  The English Channel  Harrison entering the English Channel, 1924. In 1924, she attempted to cross the English Channel four times, without achieving her goal. On the last of these attempts, she was close to drowning.Lilian Harrison's attempts to swim the English Channel are described in Glenn Stout, Young Woman and the Sea: How Trudy Ederle Conquered the English Channel and Inspired the World (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2009).  The Seine River  On August 1, 1925, she participated in the 42K (26-mile) marathon of the City of Paris, a competition on the Seine River. Lilian Harrison was the only woman among the twelve swimmers, ending in fourth place.  Private life  In 1926 she married and abandoned high performance swimming. She had one daughter, Sheila Clark and six grandsons and granddaughters. Her grandsons include Ronaldo Munck, a well-known sociologist living in Ireland and Gerardo Munck, a political scientist living in the United States.  Prizes and honors  For her crossing of the River Plate, she was decorated by the Minister of navy, in the presence of the president of Argentina Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear and the first lady; and honored by the Governor of the province of Buenos Aires, Jos√© Luis Cantilo, during a celebration in Quilmes, her native city.Eduardo McCallum, 'Gema de Plata,' N√°utico N¬∫ 265 (2009): 62-65, pp. 64.

History The first major upstream landing on the Tennessee River after leaving Paducah, Kentucky, was Riverton, a former town site in Colbert County, Alabama. Riverton was located on the east side of the junction of the Tennessee River and Bear Creek, across Bear Creek from Eastport. Colbert and Bee Tree Shoals were immediately up river from Riverton and prevented major river traffic between Riverton and Florence, Alabama, for six months of the dry season.Annual Report of the Chief of Engineers, United States Army, 1925 In the late 1890s Muscle Shoals Canal was nearing completion; this traversed the other major shoals above Florence, Alabama, and Chattanooga, Tennessee. In 1891, George Washington Goethals, an engineer and US Army officer, was promoted to captain and was assigned the oversight of completing Muscle Shoals Canal. Goethals developed a design for a single high lift lock to be located at the downstream end of Colbert Shoals canal at Riverton. Goethals was successful in convincing the Army Corps of Engineers that the high lift lock was feasible and was eventually given the approval for its construction.The Panama Canal - an army's enterprise p14, Center of Military History, United States Army Riverton Lock began operation on November 11, 1911, and at its completion was the highest lift lock in the world.

It often causes fatal inflammation of the brain in humans and other mammals, such as dogs and mongooses in Haiti. The term \\"rabies\\" is derived from a Latin word that means \\"to rage\\"; rabid animals sometimes appear to be angry. Early symptoms can include fever and tingling at the site of exposure, followed by one or more of the following symptoms: violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and loss of consciousness. Once symptoms appear, death is nearly always the outcome. The time period between contracting the disease and showing symptoms is usually one to three months; however, this time period can vary from less than a week to more than a year. The time between contraction and the onset of symptoms is dependent on the distance the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system. Haiti is one of five remaining countries in the Americas where canine rabies is still a problem. It has the highest rate of human rabies deaths in the western hemisphere with an estimated two deaths each week. Only about seven deaths are reported to health authorities each year due to poor surveillance, limitations in diagnostic capacity, and lack of awareness and education about the disease among Haitians. Epidemiology  Globally, 59,000 people die from rabies each year. This is the equivalent of one person dying every nine minutes, with half of the people who die from rabies being under the age of 15. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the Pan American Center of foot-and-mouth disease (PANAFTOSA) led a mission to eliminate dog-mediated rabies in the American region by 2015. These organizations are cognizant of the regional control of rabies. The PAHO and PANAFTOSA visited Haiti in early December, 2013, and the objectives of the mission were to assess the status of Haiti's rabies program as delivered by the Haitian Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development (MARNDR) and the Ministry of Health (MSPP). The mission was to seek opportunities for collaboration between Haiti, Brazil, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Haiti. Even in 2017, rabies in Haiti is still identified as a national problem, even with PEP proposed. Treatment  In Haiti, few cases of human rabies are reported to health authorities. In 2016, a report of a woman who had been exposed to rabies three months prior and was showing symptoms went to the hospital where no treatment was administered to her. Even after being reported to both the CDC and the national Department of Epidemiology and Laboratory Research (DELR), as required by Haiti's surveillance program, the woman ended up passing away. This goes to show the lack of communication and effectiveness in caring for human subjects in Haiti, and the continued focus is on eliminating dog- mediated rabies altogether. Human diploid cell culture rabies vaccine (HDCV) and purified chick embryo cell culture rabies vaccine (PCEC) are used to treat post-exposure immunization against a human rabies infection. Recommendations for treatment are given by governmental health care organizations and in health literature. Health care providers are encouraged to administer a regimen of four 1-mL doses of HDCV or PCEC vaccines. According to the CDC, these injections should be administered intramuscularly to persons who have not yet been vaccinated for rabies. For those who are unvaccinated, the first of four doses is administered immediately after exposure to the rabies virus. Additional doses are given three, seven, and fourteen days after the first vaccination. Exposure usually means a bite from a rabid animal. At an individual patient level, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of local treatment of the wound, vaccination, and administration of immunoglobulin, if necessary [3]. At the program level, several components are critical, including: adequate and prompt recognition of the need for PEP by the public, if exposed, and by health officials, prompt and sufficient availability of high-quality PEP, and adequate follow-up of PEP use. Health officials' awareness of the need for PEP after a dog bite can only be achieved if the exposure is attended to immediately and communicated effectively. Animal treatment  Dog vaccination is most effective for controlling dog-mediated rabies. This can be seen throughout the American region where medical authorities have achieved rabies control. In Haiti, the CDC is mainly focusing on dog-mediated rabies. Specifically in collaboration with the NGO Christian Veterinary Mission, the CDC has trained, to date, more than 20 MARNDR laboratory personnel in rabies diagnostic methods (Direct Fluorescent Antibody [DFA] and Direct Rapid Immunohistochemistry Test [dRIT]). The organizations have also improved a diagnostic laboratory in Port-au-Prince by providing it with advanced equipment. The surveillance system is a bite-reporting model where the public and medical providers report bite events to rabies control officers. In addition, more than 30 field veterinary and health agents were trained in rabies surveillance, in support of this effort. In 2011, the CDC along with MARNDR initiated a five-year rabies infrastructure improvement program that focused on surveillance, diagnostics, and education. The MSPP also helped out by improving public education on rabies. Because Haiti has a gross national income per capita of US$1,035, it is the only country in the American region that is part of the group of low-income countries. The World Bank has classified 33 other low-income countries in Africa and Asia, where dog-mediated rabies is a major problem and results in thousands of deaths annually. The persistence of dog rabies is connected to limited resources and weak governance. In conducting a rabies assessment, rabies control officers try to locate the offending animal. Animals that have bitten a victim are either euthanized and tested or quarantined for 14 days while remaining in their owner's residence. In addition, animals who show signs of rabies are tested, regardless of human exposure. This surveillance program is restricted to two of the ten geographical departments of the country (West and Artibonite) for security reasons. The area includes approximately 50 percent of the Haitian population. The CDC and the NGO Christian Veterinary Mission support the mission by maintaining four Haitian staff in the West Department and three in the Artibonite Department, respectively. Results of this mission showed the level of under-reporting of canine rabies. Specifically, six cases of rabid dogs in early December, 2012, were reported for the country. During the first nine months of the surveillance mission, 42 rabid dogs were identified in just three communities in Port-au-Prince during the first nine months in 2012. That being said, no laboratory-based surveillance exists for the human population that is exposed to rabies and all diagnoses are based on clinical history. This is because of the lack of laboratory facilities, making it difficult to identify evidence for the virus in humans and shed light on the disease as a whole for them, in Haiti. There are insufficient numbers of pathologists to collect samples for human rabies, as well. There do exist other methods for viral antigen detection that may merit study. In 2013, the CDC and its partners began an animal rabies surveillance program in several regions of Haiti and saw an 18-fold rise in detection of rabid animals. In 2015, the CDC evaluated Haiti's canine rabies vaccination program and found that only 45 percent of dogs were vaccinated, far short of the 70 percent needed to stop the spread of rabies in the dog population. In addition, the researchers found that Haiti had nearly 1,000,000 dogs, twice as many as previously thought. The CDC and its partners had already begun a dog vaccination trial in evaluating the best vaccination methods for dogs in Haiti. As a part of this effort, they vaccinated 3,000 dogs in just four days during the summer of 2016 and planned to vaccinate a total of 8,000 dogs as part of this campaign. Challenges In Haiti, the control of dog rabies is led by the MARNDR while the MSPP manages health-care and rabies prevention in the human population. The separation of these ministries makes it easier for responsibilities to be divided among them. Communication about finding the source of exposure and implementing control methods to prevent further cross- species transmission is also more effective. This task is difficult enough within departments of the same ministry, (e.g., health care and epidemiology), which can be seen in experiences elsewhere. This is why a comprehensive evaluation of Haiti's rabies program should heavily consider the costs and benefits of this separation of responsibilities between the two ministries early on. Despite a planned mass vaccination for dogs in 2013, no campaign was actually conducted. Authorities in Haiti relied on funds donated by the World Bank for the purchase of approximately 500,000 doses of inactivated, injectable vaccine (IMRAB by Merial). Although the funds were awarded in April 2013, the vaccine itself did not arrive until 2014 when the dog vaccination finally went underway in September 2014. The process as a whole was expected to terminate in January 2015. The lack of manpower needed to deliver faster implementation made it impossible for the campaign to be completed in less than four months. Another challenge presented is vaccination failure, which usually leads to recurrent rabies in dogs and inconsistent control of the disease. The failures that disrupt annual campaigns or have insufficient coverage, for example, are seen as the main cause for this problem. Another factor is that in Haiti, dog vaccinations have been inconsistently applied. Back in 2012 when the last mass vaccination was led by the MARNDR, approximately 400,000 dogs were vaccinated. With this in mind, considering a current human population of approximately 10,000,000, a relation of one dog per ten people, and aiming to attain 70 percent of vaccine coverage, 700,000 dogs would have to be vaccinated. Assessing the effectiveness of this vaccination campaign is difficult because the dog population figures are unreliable (estimates range from 800,000 to 1,200,000 dogs), and though the overall success seems to be limited. The number of rabid dogs detected by the MARNDR, MSPP, and CDC is a huge risk to people and is not accurately reflected in their surveillance figures. Although international support is common in both technical help and donations, it is not comprehensive. In addition, the MARNDR, MSPP, and other actors do not communicate effectively because of human resource limitations. That being said, the 2015 elimination goal in the region was compromised and control of the disease could not yet be achieved, despite the efforts of resolute national officials. In conclusion, rabies in the dog population is still a problem and major threat to the Haitian population.

Pikmin is an action game in the Pikmin series developed by Arzest and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS handheld video game console. It is a standalone sequel to Pikmin 3, and is the series' first installment on a handheld console. Hey! Pikmin was released worldwide in July 2017, and was a launch game for the New Nintendo 2DS XL.  Gameplay  Hey! Pikmin consists of main character Captain Olimar leading a group of Pikmin through 2D levels while collecting items that contain \\"sparklium\\", the main source of fuel for Olimar's ship. Unlike other games of the Pikmin series, players do not choose what Pikmin to bring into levels. Instead, players enter a level and use whatever Pikmin they find while exploring. Olimar is able to swim and use a jetpack to reach new areas. Winged Pikmin are able to carry Olimar while flying. Olimar is incapable of attacking on his own, instead relying on the Pikmin for defense. As players continue to collect more sparklium, Olimar is able to upgrade his space suit's capabilities such as the amount of fuel the jetpack has or the amount of hits it can take. After clearing a level, all recruited Pikmin are taken to the Pikmin Park, an area where Pikmin can be sent to look for more objects with sparklium. By finding colored pellets, the amount of Pikmin in the park can be increased. After clearing a section of the Pikmin Park, more sections open up for the Pikmin to explore. The game is compatible with every Amiibo released before the game's launch, which provide a variety of in-game bonuses. A Pikmin-themed Amiibo was also released at launch.  Plot  Olimar is flying in space on his new ship, the S.S. Dolphin II, when he hits an asteroid and crash-lands on an unknown planet. He learns that in order to bring his ship back in working order, he must collect 30,000 of the substance known as Sparklium. He soon re-encounters Red Pikmin, which he figures out he can use to carry Sparklium-rich treasures and acorn-like seeds. These \\"treasures\\" are usually common household objects, such as glasses or toothpaste. As Olimar searches more sectors of the planet, he finds Yellow Pikmin, Blue Pikmin, Rock Pikmin, and Winged Pikmin in that order. Once the player gathers up 30,000 Sparklium, Olimar learns he must retrieve an essential component needed to repair the ship, the Sparklium Converter. However, it is revealed that it was eaten by the Beserk [sic?] Leech Hydroe, a giant plant-like boss which he must fight. After defeating it and obtaining the converter, Olimar heads back to his home planet, Hocotate.  Development  On November 6, 2014, Miyamoto stated during a Q&A; of his recently released Pikmin short films that \\"Continually launching campaigns after the release of software will lay the groundwork for the next iteration of Pikmin in the future. And needless to say, we want it to be one of the motivations for potential consumers to purchase a Wii U. We are making a variety of different efforts.\\" Later, on January 6, 2015, Miyamoto gave further confirmation that the Pikmin franchise would be receiving more games in the future, stating \\"I still have a lot of ideas about what I want to do with Pikmin, but nothing's decided yet in terms of anything else. But of course, we will continue to make Pikmin games.\\" Furthermore, on September 7, 2015, Miyamoto confirmed in an interview with Eurogamer that the next Pikmin game was in development, and was \\"very close to completion.\\" During E3 2016, Miyamoto gave further updates, stating \\"Yes, you are right, and we're working on [the next Pikmin]. So, you know, when we're in development we have to create a list of priorities and it has been hard to kind of fit that into that list, but we're hopefully starting to see that on the list now.\\".  Reception  The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The game was criticized for its simple puzzles and lack of depth. Game Informer stated: \\"Puzzles are also extremely simple, and usually boil down to tossing Pikmin around obstacles... Nintendo's low-impact blend of strategy and action flounders between relaxing and boring.\\" Areas praised in the game include the amiibo functions. Allegra Frank of Polygon said \\"Hey!

The project aims to trace circulation of news, money, commercial goods, migration, artistic and architectural patterns amongst others to create a Big Data of the Past. Its fulfillment would represent the largest database ever created on Venetian documents. The project is an example of the new area of scholar activity that has emerged in the Digital Age: Digital Humanities. The project's widespread critical acclaim led to the submission of a European counterpart proposal to the European Commission in April 2016. The Venice Time Machine forms the technological basis of the proposed European Time Machine. The first full reconstruction of Venice showing the evolution of the city between 900 and 2000 was shown at the Venice Biennale of Architecture in 2018.http://padiglionevenezia.it/casi/venice-time-machine/ The Venice Time Machine model of the city of Venice in 1750 was also used for an exhibition at the Grand Palais in Paris in September 2018. Organisation and funding The Venice Time Machine Project was launched by EPFL and the University Ca'Foscari of Venice in 2012. It includes collaboration from major Venetian patrimonial institutions: the State Archive in Venice, The Marciana Library, The Instituto Veneto and the Cini Foundation. The project is currently supported by the READ (Recognition and Enrichment of Archival Documents)European eInfrastructure project, the SNF project Linked Books and ANR-SNF Project GAWS. The international board includes renowned scholars from Stanford, Columbia, Princeton, and Oxford. In 2014, The Lombard Odier Foundation joined the project Venice Time Machine as a financial partner. Technology and tools The State Archives of Venice contain a massive amount of hand-written documentation in languages evolving from medieval times to the 20th century. An estimated 80 km of shelves are filled with over a thousand years of administrative documents, from birth registrations, death certificates and tax statements, all the way to maps and urban planning designs. These documents are often very delicate and are occasionally in a fragile state of conservation. The diversity, amount and accuracy of the Venetian administrative documents are unique in Western history. By combining this mass of information, it is possible to reconstruct large segments of the city's past: complete biographies, political dynamics, or even the appearance of buildings and entire neighborhoods. =Scanning= Paper documents are turned into high-resolution digital images with the help of scanning machines. Different types of documents impose various constraints on the type of scanning machines that can be used and on the speed at which a document can be scanned. In partnership with industry, EPFL is working on a semi-automatic, robotic scanning unit capable of digitizing about 1000 pages per hour. Multiple units of this kind will be built to create an efficient digitization pipeline adapted to ancient documents. Another solution currently being explored at EPFL involves scanning books without turning the pages at all. This technique uses X-ray synchrotron radiation produced by a particle accelerator. =Transcription= The graphical complexity and diversity of hand-written documents make transcription a daunting task. For the Venice Time Machine, scientists are currently developing novel algorithms that can transform images into probable words. The images are automatically broken down into sub-images that potentially represent words. Each sub-image is compared to other sub-images, and classified according to the shape of word it features. Each time a new word is transcribed, it allows millions of other word transcripts to be recognized in the database. =Text processing= The strings of probable words are then turned into possible sentences by a text processor. This step is accomplished by using, among other tools, algorithms inspired by protein structure analysis that can identify recurring patterns. =Connecting data= The real wealth of the Venetian archives lies in the connectedness of its documentation. Several keywords link different types of documents, which makes the data searchable. This cross-referencing of imposing amounts of data organizes the information into giant graphs of interconnected data. Keywords in sentences are linked together into giant graphs, making it possible to cross-reference vast amounts of data, thereby allowing new aspects of information to emerge. The Digital Humanities Laboratory of EPFL announced on the 1st of March 2016 the development of REPLICA, a new search engine for the study and enhanced use of the Venetian cultural heritage to be online by the end of 2016. Reception =Praise= *Interdisciplinarity and internationalism. Major Venetian patrimonial institutions, academic institutions and professors coming from different disciplines and different institutions across the world are collaborating to achieve this collective effort. The Venice Time Machine page describes three hundred researchers and students from different disciplines (Natural Sciences, Engineering, Computer Science, Architecture, History and History of arts) to have collaborated for this project. *Development of technology. The programme faces multiple technical challenges associated with converting the unique and vast cultural heritage into a digital archive. Mass digitization not only requires the systematic scanning of ancient manuscripts, but also the automatic processing of different hand-writing styles, as well as the analysis of Latin and several other languages as they evolve through time. Researchers of EPFL working on the Venice Time Machine project have, for instance, presented a methodology to analyze linguistic changes by studying 200 years of Swiss newspaper archives. *Democratization of knowledge and culture. The project seeks to open up knowledge and history to a wider audience through a virtual database that anyone can access, thus enhancing the link between the scholars and the wider public. Moreover, in reverse Digital Humanities aims to reduce barriers to the contribution and the sharing of knowledge and data by allowing a wider public to contribute to the effort of collection of data. The elite group of scholars and professionals should no longer be the only ones that can contribute and dissipate cultural and historical knowledge and digital humanities seeks to reduce this. =Criticism= *Skewed audience. The whole project, along with the development of technology it entails, seems to be for a purely Western audience. Both the Venice Time Machine and the subsequent European Time Machine are centered around European history, culture and patrimonial heritage. Nothing has been done so far to include more regions' cultural history (although the project and digital humanities are still in its early stages) but still goes to show that more value is given to European history. *Content selection. The scientists and researchers working on the project that develop the datasets still have the power to select the information presented to the audience, which goes against the initiative's goal of knowledge democratization. The scientists involved are in a position of power to curate the content and educational information of the Venetian database. *Business opportunity in disguise. Previous similar initiatives suggest that creating a link between the scholars and the wider public represents a business opportunity for those that control such a data platform. For instance Google Books and Google Scholar have helped to achieve Google's long-term strategy to change users' habits of searching for books of both scholarly and popular reading and making the digital become a key mean to find knowledge, information and the historic past. *Ethical issues regarding Big Data. Although the data collected is mainly from the population that lived in the past, the same ethical issues arise nonetheless as with Big Data. Data collection is not always guaranteed to be anonymous, for instance, \\"if an individual's patterns are unique enough, outside information can be used to link the data back to an individual\\". As technology continues to advance current anonymization procedures are likely to decrease, according to Joshua Fairfield. Researchers may find that requiring consent from the families concerned is cost-ineffective. =Other consequences= *The programme seeks to develop numerous tools and technologies that question and challenge the role of historians and humanists altogether.

Initially founded in 1956, the temple has employed two facilities in Glen Cove, the first burning down in 1982. Following that, the congregation was sheltered by the local Congregation Tifereth Israel and St. Paul's Episcopal Church for three years until the dedication of the current synagogue in 1985. Since 1996, the congregation has been led by Rabbi Dr. Janet B. Liss. History In 1955, the nearest Reform synagogue to Glen Cove, NY was Roslyn's Temple Sinai. Alvin Rubin, then-rabbi of the Roslyn congregation, recommended to 30 of the 40 families in his congregation to meet at the household of congregant Paul Ressler to discuss planning a new Reform congregation. Assisted by the Union for Reform Judaism (URJ), at that time called the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the congregation held its first independent service at Friends Academy in January 1956. That March, Kal Macklin, who was among the original congregants who met at the Ressler household, was elected as president of the congregation. At the time of the High Holidays, the congregation numbered 100 and was offered housing from Methodist and Masonic churches, and the local Neighborhood House. In May 1957, the congregation moved to its first self-owned temple. The white pillared building, owned by an accountant named \\"Herrick\\", sat on a 4.5 acre estate, and was often called \\"castle in the woods\\" by residents of Glen Cove. The congregation's first rabbi, Milton Schlager, was forced to resign in 1959 during a debilitating illness, he died in 2011. Schlager was replaced by Rabbi Alton Winters, who stayed with the congregation until 1971 when he began employment at Congregation B'Nai Shalom, a Reform temple in Deerfield Beach, Florida, where he died in 2016. The following September, Rabbi Morton Kaplan was employed as Winters' replacement, where he served as Rabbi for little under two years before moving out-of-state with his family, following which he served as rabbi under numerous Reform temples; Temple Sinai of Newport News, Virginia, Temple Beth Israel in Woodbury, New Jersey, and finally Temple Bat Yam in Ocean City, Maryland, before retiring from rabbinics to Charlotte, North Carolina in 2006, where he still resides and teaches classes in a local Reform shul. In 1974, Laurence Kotok became the congregation's fourth rabbi. In 1978, the congregation elected its first woman president, Susan Cort. That same year, the sanctuary was enlarged. In 1982, the synagogue's kitchen was renovated at a cost of $25,000. On February 17, a nineteen-year-old janitor accidentally set fire to the synagogue while attempting to soften wax contained by plastic with fire. Attempting to extinguish the blaze resulted in an explosion which destroyed the building's framework. Despite the efforts of firefighters, the entire building was destroyed, with the exception of a single column, which stands at the front of the new building. The janitor falsified evidence to convince police vandals were to blame for the blaze, but ended up pleading guilty to arson two months later. With the displaced assembly now sheltered by a local congregation and church, the towns surrounding Glen Cove held a large fundraiser that provided enough to fund the construction of a new synagogue. Groundbreaking began August 21, 1983 and the synagogue was finally completed on February 10, 1985, being dedicated with \\"Ner Tamid\\" affixed to the title that May. Rabbi Kotok continued as rabbi until 1996, when he accepted a position with Temple B'rith Kodesh, the oldest and largest Reform congregation in Rochester, New York, from which he retired in 2014. Kotok was replaced by the current rabbi, Dr. Janet B. Liss, marking both the first woman and member of the LGBT community to ever head the congregation. Liss had previously served as the rabbi for the Reform congregation Temple Kol Ami in Plantation, Florida. As of 2017 more than 325 families belong to the congregation, and the Temple hosts a K-5 religious school, a URJ-affiliated youth group, and a sisterhood.

Of the 421 species, 48 are classed as very rare, four are classed as occasional, 52 are classed as accidental, five have been introduced to North America, three are known to be extinct, and five have been extirpated. Only birds that are considered to have established, self-sustaining, wild populations in Arkansas are included on this list. This means that birds that are considered probable escapees, although they may have been sighted flying free in Arkansas, are not included. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them.' The following codes are used to designate some species: *(VR) Very Rare - \\"encountered at irregular or infrequent intervals\\" per the AAS *(O) Occasional - \\"occasional, 3-4 state records overall with at least 2 records since 1950\\" per the AAS *(A) Accidental - \\"1-2 state records\\" per the AAS *(I) Introduced - Species established in North America as a result of human action *(E) Extinct - a recent species that no longer exists *(Ex) Extirpated - a species no longer found in Arkansas but which continues to exist elsewhere Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Cackling goose American black duck Bufflehead Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

It was the first international conference held by the United Nations to focus solely on women's issues and marked a turning point in policy directives. After this meeting, women were viewed as part of the process to develop and implement policy, rather than recipients of assistance. The conference was one of the events established for International Women's Year and led to the creation of both the United Nations Decade for Women and follow-up conferences to evaluate the progress that had been made in eliminating discrimination against women and their equality. Two documents were adopted from the conference proceedings, the World Plan of Action which had specific targets for nations to implement for women's improvement and the Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace, which discussed how nations foreign policy actions impacted women. It also led to the establishment of the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women to track improvements and continuing issues and the United Nations Development Fund for Women to provide funding for developmental programs. The conference marked the first time that the parallel Tribune meeting was successful in submitting input to the official meeting and became a catalyst for women's groups to form throughout the world. History The World Conference on Women occurred in the 1970s amid the Cold War when geopolitical conflict was controlled based on the interests of the United States or the USSR in various regions throughout the world, polarizing the world into two camps and their respective fields of influence. At a time when the United States had just withdrawn from Vietnam, forty-eight separate conflicts would rock Asia in such places as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka. African wars during the end of decolonization in the 1970s turned toward long-lasting civil wars in Angola, Ethiopia-Somali, Mozambique and other African nations, with the superpowers manipulating the conflicts in the background with troops and arms. Decolonization of the Caribbean saw twelve states gain their independence between 1962 and 1983, but simultaneously remain marginalized by pressures from world powers which continued to manipulate local concerns. Two significant Middle East conflicts occurred in 1967 and 1973 with the US backing its Arab allies and Israel, while the USSR backed Arab socialist regimes. In Central and South America various coups d'√©tats in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, El Salvador and dictatorships led to instability and decimation of indigenous populations. Responses to the conflict often had additional repercussions, such as the 1973 Oil embargo, a response to the Arab-Israeli conflict, which caused the price of oil to rise on the world market from three dollars per barrel to twelve dollars per barrel. The embargo was followed by the 1979 energy crisis, sparked by concerns over lowered production caused by the Iranian Revolution and how continued instability might impact oil availability. That in turn led to a build up of reserves, during which time the price of oil doubled and forced the world to look at alternative sources of oil. Adding to the conflicts of the time were racial inequalities, ranging from Apartheid and Zionism to Paternalism. Work had long been ongoing by the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) to adopt a declaration to eliminate discrimination against women. By 1965, it was believed that enough support had been garnered to obtain passage of a declaration to secure women's human rights. Collating responses covering education, employment, inheritance, penal reform, and other issues, from government actors, NGO representatives and UN staff, CSW delegates began drafting a declaration. On 7 November 1967, the Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (DEDAW), was passed by the General Assembly. In 1972, the United States Congress passed Title IX, eliminating discrimination in education for any institution receiving federal funding. That same year, CSW proposed that DEDAW become a legally binding Convention. To that end, the United Nations proclaimed 1975 as International Women's Year and the CSW set about the tasks to prepare the \\"machinery\\" necessary to secure passage. Helvi Sipil√§, was selected as the Assistant Secretary General for Social Development and Humanitarian affairs and placed in charge of organizing events. Added significance of the date was that the conference would take place on the thirtieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations. =Official conference= When the United Nations designated 1975 as International Women's Year, no conference was planned as part of the celebrations because delegates on opposing sides of the Cold War could not agree to authorize one. Initially proposed by the Romanian delegate of the UN Commission on the Status of Women, communist women joined to filibuster the project, instead proposing a women's congress in East Berlin, which had nothing to do with the United Nations. As a counter, the US proposed a gender neutral conference to be held in Bogot√°, Colombia to promote equality for men and women, because the presence of men would legitimize the conference. When Mexico City agreed to host the conference, Princess Ashraf of Iran began collecting funds, and each side mobilized to shape the agenda. The US position advocated for political rights and elimination of discrimination through legal remedies. The Soviet camp advocated for women to be empowered so that they could use their natural abilities as nurturers to stem violence and inequality which created poverty and injustice. Though , the Mexican Attorney General, was appointed head of the conference, the majority, 113 of the 133 delegation leaders were women. The conference was a governmental meeting, not a meeting of women, and as such the high percentage of women marked the first time that 73% of the delegates for a UN conference were women, even if the 27% participation by men was higher than the number of women typical at such conferences. The nature of the conference also dictated that all delegates, as representatives of their governments would follow the ideological agendas of their governments, rather than act upon any private convictions. Among the prominent delegates, which many feminists felt were chosen for ideological reasons or ties to prominent male politicians, were Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Prime Minister of Sri Lanka; Anna Louise Beer, chair of the Norwegian National Women's Council; Vilma Esp√≠n de Castro, sister-in-law to the Cuban president; Francoise Giroud, French Minister of Women's Affairs; Imelda Marcos, First Lady of the Philippines; Ashraf Pahlavi, twin sister of Iran's shah; Leah Rabin, First Lady of Israel; Elizabeth Anne Reid of Australia; Silvana Maria Rota, Argentine congresswoman; Jehan Sadat, First Lady of Egypt; Soviet Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space; Vida Tom≈°iƒç, Yugoslavian representative of the Non-Aligned Movement; Khunying Suparb Visessurakarn, vice president of Thailand's National Council on Social Welfare; but not First Lady Betty Ford, as the US administration feared linking the threat of anti-capitalist sentiment with women's issues. After opening remarks by Kurt Waldheim, President Luis Echeverr√≠a of Mexico spoke, stating that women, in their role as mothers, were allies of the oppressed and that \\"no woman was more discriminated against or exploited than the woman without bread, school or medicines for her children\\". Setting the stage, Echeverr√≠a's comments mirrored the position that the nurturing nature of women could help to solve the world's crises, if marginalization were eliminated. It was agreed that the themes of equality, development and peace were the primary focus of action, as they were international in nature and required simultaneous action by global components. In general discussion it was recognized that to achieve equality and attain the fundamental human rights and freedoms expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the inferior status of women had to be addressed to bring about parity in civic, economic, legal, social and political spheres. Recognizing that legal changes alone could not ensure equality, the general discussion agreed that developmental programs made available to both urban and rural women must include women in all decision-making levels, from planning to implementation and analysis, and must provide adequate training. The discussion also recognized the need to monitor advances in women's progress as well a societal change in attitudes toward women via national institutions. In efforts toward peace, the discussion recognized women's contributions to developing friendly international relationships and pressing for disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament. Increased participation by women in international and regional problem-solving summits, was discussed as a way to maintain peace and security. The first committee, under the chair Jeanne Martin Ciss√© of Guinea, with vice-chairs, Gladys Freire de Addiego of Uruguay, of Czechoslovakia and Nilima Ibrahim of Bangladesh and Rapporteur John Bruce Campbell of Australia discussed the World Plan of Action. The plan, which had previously been drafted by a diverse range of UN committees, established a broad range of targets, considering that national developments were in varying stages, to be accomplished over the next decade (1975‚Äì1985). In addition to adopting the overall plan as revised by subcommittees, the first committee evaluating six draft resolutions, which dealt with research and training, international cooperation, women's status, the role of the UN in implementation of the Plan, women's health, and participation of women in future meetings of the UN. All were accepted with either no or minimal modification. The Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace, was also reviewed by the committee and the draft accepted with minimal or no modification. Some radical feminists, uninterested in reviewing a plan already prepared by UN committees tried to take over a US embassy meeting and yet another group walked out of the conference when Leah Rabin spoke. The second committee, under the chair Shapour Rassekh of Iran, with vice-chairs, Edmonde Dever of Belgium, Annie Jiagge of Ghana and Anna Papp of Hungary and Rapporteur Phyllis MacPherson-Russell of Jamaica evaluated current trends and obstacles in the roles of men and women to achieving parity in rights, opportunities, and responsibilities; and how women could be integrated into developmental programs. They discussed passage of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) as a critical step in the process. Recognizing the wide gap between the de jure and de facto status of women, the committee noted that to achieve equality changes would need to be made in a broad spectrum of areas including: education, employment opportunity, family, integration into existent systems, and the law. Fifty- eight draft resolutions had been submitted for the committee to review, which covered these areas and they divided them into working groups to reduce duplications. Winnowing down the drafts to twenty-one items which were accepted with modifications, the major areas concerned communications media, education and training, employment, exploitation of women and girls, family health, family planning, family security (including the elderly and disabled), financial assistance, integration to development, political and social participation, and systems to gather, collate and evaluate data on women's status. The committee evaluated seven other drafts having to do with expanding the role of women in peace initiatives and nation rebuilding, and adopted each of them with little or no modification. =Tribune= The International Women's Year Tribune was a parallel conference scheduled by women to be held simultaneously with the official conference. The format allowed for non- governmental organizations (NGO) to meet and discuss the issues tabled at the official conference, but gave them no authority to take any action. There were around 6,000 delegates who attended the Tribune, organized by Mildred Persinger the UN's YWCA observer, including such women as Domitila Barrios de Chungara, head of the Siglo XX Miners' Union Housewives Committee of Bolivia; Nancy C√°rdenas, Mexican lesbian activist; Jacqui Ceballos, former president of the New York chapter of National Organization for Women (NOW); Thelma Daily of the Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW); Carole DeSaram, president of the New York NOW Betty Friedan, founder of NOW; Ronnie Feit of the National Women's Political Caucus; Dorothy Haene of the United Auto Workers; Dorothy Height of the National Council of Negro Women; Pat Keppler of the Harvard Divinity School; Esperanza Mart√≠, director of Fem magazine and a Mexican feminist; Jan Peterson of CLUW; and Margo St. James, founder of COYOTE. The founders of Women's World Banking met as part of the tribunal, including Michaela Walsh, a program associate at the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, who met Ela R. Bhatt, founder of Self-Employed Women's Association of India, and Esther Ocloo, a Ghanaian businesswoman. The Tribune was held on the opposite side of Mexico City, creating a physical as well as philosophical separation of the two groups. The difference in format stemmed from position that the delegates participated in discussions on official policy; whereas, the NGO tribunal women dealt with means and methods of program implementation to improve women's educational opportunities, equality, economic position and collaboration. The Tribune hosted thirty-six planned meetings and nearly two hundred spontaneously organized additional sessions covering a wide variety of topics from development, education, health, human rights, peace and work to birth control, gender violence, lesbianism, prostitution, racism and sexism. The dynamics of this conference were different from the official UN session because the participants were not governmental representatives, and delegates were free to discuss items openly avoided by the officials. But the free discussion also made apparent the divide separating the women. Westernized women focused on individual freedom, Socialist women focused on the state's obligation to enforce the collective rights of all members of a society, and those from countries not aligned to either of these views pointed to the need for development, economic empowerment, food security and correction of the structural problems in systems. Women from developing nations pointed out issues such as how aid from industrialized nations was often harmful, as it displaced women practicing subsistence agriculture with technology. Without adequate training to utilize technology, women who had been the prevalent food producers no longer had means to support their families. If they were utilized by new industry, women tended to be exploited as a cheap labor source, as laws for equal pay were non-existent in many developing economies. In light of these survival issues, the demands of others asking for sexual and reproductive health and rights seemed frivolous and indicative of self- indulgence. Socialist women felt that equality could only come with a transformation of geopolitical relationships, which recognized the contributions of all members of society and denounced exploitation and discrimination on any basis. Amid the wide range of views, there were performances aimed at capturing media attention, with some attendees wearing national costumes and others wearing business attire, as well as rhetoric pitting ideologies against each other to gain a spotlight. At one point, frustrated that they could not be part of the official dialogue, a group of radical feminists planned to stage a march through the streets of Mexico City. Instead, a group of fifteen delegates was chosen who presented amendments to Helvi Sipil√§ requesting that they be given to the official committees. It was the first time that a Tribune had ever been successful in presenting their input to the officials. The amendments the Tribune proposed included establishment of a UN office to monitor success of the Plan, issue annual progress reports, and investigate human rights abuse against women. They also asked for the UN to improve their internal hiring policies so that more women were not only hired, but promoted to management and executive positions. Outcomes The conference adopted the official World Plan of Action, as well as the Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace, which was an indictment of the foreign policies that pushed military or corporatist intervention to coerce developing nations from determining their own path. The Declaration passed with a vote of eighty-nine in favor, three against, and eighteen nations abstaining. The Plan established minimum targets to be attained within the next five years to secure for women the equal access of the mechanisms to attaining equality and eliminating discrimination; to full participation in development and their integration in extant systems; and to their contributions toward world peace and non- aggression. To reach these goals, the conference made education, employment, family planning, health and nutrition, and housing key focal points. The Tribune played a uniting role, by bringing together people of diverse cultures and backgrounds to formulate the means to overcome differences in objective and create pathways for NGOs to participate in the policy-making process. The conference not only encouraged member countries to develop policies which would lead to the improvement of women's lives, but led to the establishment of the United Nations Decade for Women as a means to focus those policies, as well as establishing a series of conferences to follow-up. The first of these would be the Second World Conference on Women to be held in Copenhagen. To assist in advancing women's development with research, operations support and training, the UN created the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW) and the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). For the first time, institutional collection within the UN evaluated the extent of problems and conditions of women in varying nations, specifically separating data by sex to bring to light the level of inequality and discrimination towards women. It was also one of the first international meetings of organized lesbians from multiple countries and cultures. Attitudes within the member nations and the UN itself began to change as a result of the focus on women brought about by the conference. Another benefit of the conference was that it connected women to other women in their struggles. Though in many ways the conference was not as effective in poor and undeveloped countries, because enforcement of the principals established and communication with women was harder in the developing world, there was a surge in women's activists coming together across the globe, as well as governmental understanding of the needs of their constituent women.

Ultimately, with a sufficient amount of flooding, an ice layer of significant thickness can be built, for a higher quality road in terms of effectiveness and load bearing capacity. Ice aggregate, typically collected from a nearby frozen lake, is also used on uneven terrain - it is flooded and allowed to freeze.

Pursuant to section 453 of the Internal Revenue Code, installment sale treatment allows a seller to defer recognition of a portion of the gain on the sale of an asset where at least one payment is to be received by the seller after the close of the taxable year in which the sale occurs. In a monetized installment sale, the seller defers recognition of tax on the installment sale payments while 'monetizing' the installment note via a separate, tax free borrowing. Although the tax is deferred until the receipt of payment under the installment contract, an interest charge is imposed on installment sales above $5,000,000, except in the case of agricultural assets, which has no limitation.  Used by public companies  Because of the lack of limitation on agricultural assets, installment sales generally, and monetized installment sales in particular, have been popular among public companies selling their timberland assets. Notable monetized installment sales that public companies have reported from 1999 to the present have included: 1\\\\. The $43.25 Million Monetized Installment Sale by GREIF, Inc. 2\\\\. The $617 Million Monetized Installment Sale by Kimberly Clark. 3\\\\. The $350 Million Monetized Installment Sale by Plum Creek. 4\\\\. The $1.47 Billion Monetized Installment Sale by OfficeMax. These transactions typically are structured with the help of an advisor in connection with the imminent sale of the appreciated asset. Among public companies, the closing of the transaction has been contingent upon the company's receipt of a private ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  Internal Revenue Service review  The Internal Revenue Service's (IRS's) analysis in the above referenced memorandum focused on the step transaction doctrine and the substance over form doctrine. The IRS concluded that the transaction was permissible and that the judicial doctrines of substance over form and step transaction did not apply in that case. While the monetization component of the transaction had an unusual interest rate, it concluded: ::\\"Taxpayer needed to sell its Asset and structured the sale in a way that minimized its taxes... Substantively, the steps of the Transaction matched their form: an installment sale coupled with a monetization loan. The Transaction allowed Taxpayer to take advantage of tax deferral on the asset sale, which is a permitted result under I.R.C. ¬ß¬ß 453 and 453A.\\" Because a monetized installment sale is subject to these standard levels of review, it is important that all components of the transaction (i.e. the installment sale and the subsequent loan) be structured in accordance standard commercial documentation and terms. An article on the transaction was published, \\"Monetizing Installment Sale Transactions,\\" 31 Corporate Taxation 29, in November 2004. Alternatives While monetized installment sales are used to defer taxable gain while maintaining near liquidity, a related transaction may be employed to achieve other objectives. For example, a structured sale based on Private Letter Ruling 150850-07 is common where the seller wants to defer tax but receive a guaranteed income stream from a high quality payer such as an insurance company or other highly rated financial institution.

In 2003, braschler/fischer started collaborating as a photography team while developing the portrait project ‚ÄûAbout Americans‚Äú Edition Braus. In the following years, braschler/fischer created portraits of humans from all backgrounds and cultures. ‚ÄûFaces of Football‚Äú() Nicolai Verlag, a series of portraits of the world‚Äôs most important soccer players, ‚ÄûChina‚Äú, portraits of people from all social backgrounds and regions of China, and ‚ÄûAffected - The Human Face of Climate Change‚Äú, a series of environmental portraits from around the world, are among their largest projects. Their project ‚ÄúAct Now!‚Äù, a portrait series of famous climate activists to raise awareness at the 2015 climate negotiations in Paris, was created in close collaboration with the United Nations. For their international work, the duo visits remote places, such as the island state of Kiribati or Tuktoyaktuk in the far North of Canada. The types of people braschler/fischer capture range from celebrities like David Beckham to nomadic farmers in the Sahel Zone. braschler/fischer have won numerous awards for their works, including a World Press Photo Award in 2007. Their photography projects appear internationally and have been published in The Guardian, Vanity Fair and Stern, as well as in photo books (see below). Their work has been exhibited in Europe,C/O Berlin, Berlin, Germany Asia,The Chinese Paris-Beijing Gallery, Beijing, China and the Americas.  Biographies  Mathias Braschler was born in Aargau, Switzerland, in 1969. He studied geography and modern history at the University of Zurich. He was strongly touched by a photographic exhibition of Sebastiao Salgado and learned from photographer and filmmaker Alberto Venzago before beginning his career in photography in 1994. Starting out as a photo journalist, he worked for various magazines and newspapers such as NZZ and Sonntags Zeitung in Switzerland before moving to New York City in 1998, where he carried out his first book project, Madison Avenue in 1999( ) Edition Andreas Z√ºst. Through his experience of covering 9/11 for Newsweek, Mathias Braschler decided to move more into portrait photography.Photonews, June 2012, p.29 In the following years he lived and worked in New York. Monika Fischer was born in St. Gallen‚Äôs Rhine Valley in Switzerland in 1971. While studying Romance and German philology at the University of Zurich, she also began working as a dramaturg and director‚Äôs assistant at the Zurich opera house. Over several years she worked with international theatre directors in Switzerland. Monika Fischer graduated from the Zurich University of the Arts with an executive master in scenography in 2005. Her experience in lighting and mis-en-scene is an important part of braschler/fischer's visual style.Photonews, June 2012, p.30 The duo met while studying at university and first started working on a project based on the Werner Herzog Film Fitzcarraldo for the Opera house of Manaus, Brazil in 2002. Their work relationship evolved into the formation of a permanent team, and they became the duo braschler/fischer in 2003. They have a son and divide their time between Zurich and New York. Work and projects Braschler/fischer work project-based, with projects usually lasting several months to two years and requiring extensive travel. Braschler/fischer always work as a team and are specialized in portrait photography. Strongly influenced by the works of Sebastiao Salgado, Richard Avedon, Robert Capa, Werner Bischof and Henri Cartier-Bresson, and having been compared to August Sander, braschler/fischer have developed a style that balances between illuminating the subject while telling their true story. They apply this style to a variety of topics: =Socio-geographic= A whole country is portrayed by showing a variety of typical members of a country‚Äôs society. Usually braschler/fischer accomplish this task through extensive road trips. For example, they covered more than 30.000 km in seven months in China to portray 172 people. Published projects: About Americans China The Swiss =Environmental= To raise awareness on environmental issues, braschler/fischer create portraits of humans who are affected by them, such as people affected by climate change, or known activists.

It has a circumboreal distribution, and is also found in South America and Antarctica.  Description  Like other species in the Polytrichaceae, Polytrichum strictum has leaves with a single costa, vertical lamellae, a water-repelling cuticle, and rhizoids that appear to facilitate external water movement in addition to anchoring the plant. Dense tufts of slender stems from 6‚Äì12 cm form 20‚Äì40 cm hummocks in bogs and similar substrates. Leaves are narrowly lanceolate, appressed to the stem when dry and spreading to erect when moist. The reddish awn (formed by the slightly excurrent costa) and smooth, inrolled leaf margins separate P. strictum from other Polytrichum species; only juniper haircap moss (P. juniperinum) shares these attributes. P. strictum, however, can be easily distinguished by the wooly-tomentose white rhizoids that extend up its stems (absent in P. juniperinum), as well as its boggy habitat and predilection for organic soils (in contrast to the weedy nature and preference for mineral soils that characterize P. juniperinum).  Distribution  Polytrichum strictum is found throughout Canada, the northern half of the United States, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, northern Europe and Asia, as well as Antarctica and the southern half of South America. It is characteristic of boggy peatland habitats dominated by Sphagnum mosses, but can also be found in wet heaths, tundra, sedge meadows, and peaty forests from low to high elevations; in warmer climates, it is largely confined to relict bogs. Its microhabitat is at the top of peat hummocks, which it often helps to form.  Reproduction  The male reproductive structures of P. strictum, featuring splash cups. Immature sporophytes of P. strictum, with calyptra clearly visible. Polytrichum strictum is dioicous, with male and female reproductive structures produced separately by male and female gametophytes, which are haploid (1n). As in other Polytrichum species, the antheridia are borne terminally on male plants and swell and burst when mature, launching sperm into the air; in addition, they develop in splash cups, which further facilitate sperm dispersal by catching and harnessing the energy of rain drops. The lucky few sperm to land near the archegonia of a female plant (also borne terminally) use their two whiplash flagella to swim down the neck and into the venter, where one will fertilize the ovum. Once fertilisation takes place, the zygote develops into the diploid (2n) sporophyte, which consists of a foot (embedded in the tissue of the gametophyte), a seta (or stalk), and a capsule. The capsule, which is covered by a dirty-white calyptra, matures after the seta elongates, at which point the calyptra is shed. Within the capsule, each sporoctye undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid (1n) spores; when these are mature, the operculum is projected and the spores are released through the peristome, which is joined by the epiphragm and ringed by 64 nematodontous teeth. When the proper conditions and substrate are available, the spores germinate into a filamentous protonema, from which the gametophytes emerge, completing the cycle.  Use in restoration  P. strictum leaf cross section, showing lamellae, costa, and inrolled leaf margin Polytrichum strictum is considered an important pioneer species in peatlands, able to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions and disturbance regimes. It is instrumental in preventing frost heaving in harvested peatlands, and research suggests it can be used in the restoration of unstable peat areas, although little is known about whether it aids or hinders Sphagnum growth.

A group of officers, who were previously members of the Polish Legions in World War I, submitted resignation from duty as a response to the statement of General Franciszek Latinik, Commander of Corps District No. X., garrison of Przemy≈õl. The officers that have resigned, which included Major General Edward ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz, Lieutenant General Gustaw Orlicz-Dreszer, Lieutenant General Roman G√≥recki, Lieutenant General Jakub Krzemie≈Ñski, Lieutenant General Aleksander Litwinowicz, Colonel Felicjan S≈Çawoj Sk≈Çadkowski and Lieutenant Colonel Stefan DƒÖbkowski, considered Latinik's unfavorable comments on the former Legions' members a source of personal insult and demanded a firm reaction of the state authorities to these comments. The events gained high publicity, being widely discussed in both Polish and international press. Request of the group that made a collective resignation was rejected; the crisis eventually contributed to the resignation of Latinik himself. On February 28, 1925, at the age of sixty, at his own request, he left the active service.  Background  Franciszek Latinik gained experience serving until 1918 in the Austro- Hungarian Army (as Poland did not exist as an independent state), and participated as a Colonel in the fights of World War I. After entering Polish Army, he did not show sympathy to former soldiers of Polish Legions. Having been educated in an elite Academy of the General Staff in Vienna, Latinik considered Legions members incompetent and did not respect their military qualifications. Politically, he sympathized with National Democracy. According to Jerzy Rawicz, in 1919, when commanding Polish forces defending the Czech offensive in Cieszyn Silesia, Latinik has entered into a dispute with some representatives of leftist circles, among others Dorota K≈Çuszy≈Ñska, social activist and feminist who later became a Member of the Senate from PPS list. The first incident pointing to Latinik's reluctance to former members of the Legions took place in the spring of 1921. At the time, Latinik was already appointed Lieutenant General and was a commander of the General District Kielce. In July 1921 Major Marian Proso≈Çowicz lodged a complaint with Latinik to the Ministry of Military Affairs, stating that his superior \\"offended legionaries as such.\\" In his testimony, Poros≈Çowicz recalled the words of Latinik: However, in the opinion of other witnesses, there was no basis to recognize these words as referring generally to the legionnaires as a group. The then Minister of Military Affairs J√≥zef Le≈õniewski dismissed the complaint of Proso≈Çowicz, stating that Latinik's statement was \\"offensive but not political\\". In the situation given, Minister Le≈õniewski had demanded that Latinik summoned Major Poros≈Çowicz to the report and informed him about the minister's decision, demanding from Latinik also to state \\"that he considered the words addressed to Major Proso≈Çowicz on May 23rd to be uttered in exaltation and he did not intend to punish his younger colleague\\". From October 1921, Latinik was the Commander of Corps District No. X. in Przemy≈õl. Residing in Przemy≈õl was unprofitable for him; he previously counted on transferring to the city with an academic center due to the possibility of providing higher education to his daughters. Chief of State J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski had a negative attitude to the activity of Latinik in Przemy≈õl. As Latinik described in a later report, after the assassination of President Gabriel Narutowicz on December 16, 1922 he was ordered to report to Pi≈Çsudski: Pi≈Çsudski answered: The basis for the indictment was a report of a secret meeting at Latinik's house that took place a few days before the attack on President Narutowicz. The election of Narutowicz less than two weeks earlier was followed by several protests and strong negative propaganda from the anti- Semitic right-wing; some historians argue that these actions led, in the climax, to the murder of Narutowicz. Latinik strongly denied the allegations, declaring that \\"the reporter must either have been mentally ill or a malicious calumniator\\". For the meeting mentioned in the report Latinik invited, among others, Bishop of Przemy≈õl J√≥zef Pelczar and the Starost of Przemy≈õl District. It was to take place in November and deal with the increasing acts of sabotage in Przemy≈õl and propose forms of self-help organizations. As Pi≈Çsudski remained unconvinced by these explanations, Latinik was to present a printed report of the meeting to the Marshal later on.  Cause and course of the strike  In the late summer of 1924 in many Polish cities former Legion soldiers who still actively served in the Polish Army began preparations to the events celebrating the tenth anniversary of the set out of the First Cadre Company from Krak√≥w. The anniversary date was August 6. The main celebrations took place on August 9‚Äì11 in Lublin; the local celebrations in Przemy≈õl took place on Sunday, September 7, 1924.Ziemia Przemyska, September 20, 1924, p. 2. On the same day, General Latinik together with his deputy, General Wiktor Jarosz, took part in the welcome of President Stanis≈Çaw Wojciechowski, who stopped in Przemy≈õl on the way from Lviv to Warsaw. The Honorary Company and the Military Orchestra also attended the Presidential Welcome Ceremony at the railway station.Ziemia Przemyska, September 13, 1924, p. 1. Before that, at the end of July, a delegation with publisher J√≥zef Styfi, foreman ZajƒÖczkowski, H. Stieberow and Professor B. Groch came to Latinik to ask the Army help in organizing the anniversary and the participation of the 38th Infantry Regiment in the march of former legionaries through the city. Latinik turned to the applicants with the following response: On the legionaries themselves he said: On the following day the incident was a subject of an article in a local paper Nowy G≈Ços Przemyski (New Voice of Przemy≈õl), which condemned General Latinik for his demeanor. Latinik ordered to confiscate the issue; the case went to a court which ruled in October that the confiscation was unfounded and abolished it. The subject of Latinik's unfavorable attitude to the legionaries was, however, taken up by other papers, some of which undermined the sense of Polish national identity of Latinik before 1918, i.e. before regaining independence by Poland. The editorial office of Ziemia Przemyska (Land of Przemy≈õl), on the contrary, stood strongly in defense of Latinik. The attack on him was described as \\"a revenge for an unsuccessful show in honor of former Chief Pi≈Çsudski and the Legions in Przemy≈õl\\". On October 30, a group of MPs from the Polish People's Party \\"Wyzwolenie\\" and the \\"Unity of People\\", headed by Bogus≈Çaw Miedzi≈Ñski, submitted an interpellation in which they described the events that took place in Przemy≈õl and asked W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, the Minister of Military Affairs, \\"a living legionary officer\\", if he \\"got acquainted with the case\\" and if \\"he has responded to the insane and criminal prank of General Latinik so that the punishment that he was to receive secured future relations in the army and offended part of the army from this kind of provocation.\\" Sikorski did not answer. He could not downplay Latinik's words, after numerous press publications and the submitted interpellation, but it is also possible that he did not want to advocate on the side opposite to the General. Shortly after that the Ministry of Military Affairs started to receive individual complaints of soldiers that were personally offended by the statements of Latinik and demanded \\"protection of the honor of the uniform\\". Complaints and appeals on this subject were submitted, among others, by Leon Berbecki, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jaxa-Ro≈ºen and Mariusz Zaruski. Because of Sikorski's absence in Warsaw, General Edward ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz turned to the Deputy Minister of Military Affairs, Stefan Majewski, with the request of intervention and punishment of Latinik. Majewski refused, as he didn't want to make controversial decisions for his superior, General Sikorski. Then, a group of generals and senior officers, who previously served in the Polish Legions, have resigned from active service to protest against the passive attitude of the Ministry. Following officers formed the group: * Major General Edward ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz, Inspector of the Army No. 1 in Vilnius; * Lieutenant General Gustaw Orlicz-Dreszer, commander of the 2nd Cavalry Division in Warsaw; * Lieutenant General Roman G√≥recki, head of the Corps of Controllers in Warsaw; * Lieutenant General Jakub Krzemie≈Ñski, the judge of the Supreme Military Court in Warsaw; * Lieutenant General Aleksander Litwinowicz, head of the Department of Military Industry of the Ministry of Military Affairs in Warsaw, * Colonel Felicjan S≈Çawoj Sk≈Çadkowski, head of the Department of the VIIIth Department of Sanitary Ministry of Military Affairs in Warsaw; * Lieutenant Colonel Stefan DƒÖbkowski, commander of the 10th Engineer Regiment in Przemy≈õl.Gazeta Lwowska, November 4, 1924, p. 1.  Aftermath  The submission of the resignation was a subject of several press articles and polemics; it was widely discussed in the national press; some foreign newspapers also took notice of the incident. French L'Illustration was the first to use the term \\"strike\\" in reference to the events that occurred. Shortly after that the term began to function in Poland as well. Right-wing publicists pointed to a weak sense of military duty of these, who have resigned. As the author of an article in Dwugrosz√≥wka remarked, \\"they are ready to take off their grinds for whatever reason\\". The commenter went on, adding ironically: Stanis≈Çaw Mackiewicz judged that strike participants \\"submitted evidence of military immaturity\\". Latinik, in turn, was attacked by Wojciech Stpiczy≈Ñski, activist and radical supporter of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. Stpiczy≈Ñski also criticized other officers whose roots were in the Austro- Hungarian Army: As the absence of Minister Sikorski in Warsaw prolonged, Deputy Minister Majewski declined to make the final decision himself. Instead, he ordered to the court of honor to settle the case. On October 31, 1924 he appointed General Eugeniusz Pogorzelski to investigate the justification of allegations made to Latinik; as Deputy Minister summarized: Then, on November 3, Latinik was summoned by the Deputy Minister to Warsaw. In the subsequent report, two applications were made: firstly, that Latinik should leave at his own request from the army, and secondly, that the case should be handed over to the general honorary court. On November 4, 1924 Polska Zbrojna has published a statement from the Cabinet of the Minister of Military Affairs, which claimed that: * due to the late notification of the prosecutor's office, Latinik's legal proceedings and prosecution, as well as disciplinary proceedings, were time-barred, * Lieutenant General Stefan Majewski, as the Deputy Minister acting on the behalf of the Minister of Military Affairs, provided materials for the case to be considered by the honorary court for the generals, * General Latinik made a request to transfer him to permanent rest and was granted leave on November 3. On Thursday, November 6, 1924, Deputy Minister Majewski on the behalf of Minister Sikorski ordered the limitation of military orchestras' performances due to \\"too much overload in some of the larger garrisons of the orchestra's performance, impeding their rational training\\".Dziennik Rozkaz√≥w Ministra Spraw Wojskowych z 6 listopada 1924 r., Nr 44, poz. 644. Latinik applied for release from active service and said that \\"he was morally forced to resign so as not to be exposed to the suspension\\". In a letter to Minister Sikorski, he indicated that he expected a positive consideration of the request of Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy and other officers, which would result in their retirement. At the same time he criticized Rydz: Ziemia Przemyska in the comment closing the case stated: Latinik has been out of active service since March 1, 1925. Although the authorities approved his dismissal, they did not take into account the prior request of the malcontent legionaries.

It is the first installment in the Sakura Wars series, created by Oji Hiroi. Originally released for the Sega Saturn, it was later ported to other systems including the Dreamcast and a remake for the PlayStation 2. Defined by Sega as a \\"dramatic adventure\\" game, Sakura Wars combines overlapping tactical role-playing, dating sim, and visual novel gameplay elements. Set in a fictionalized version of 1923 in the Taish≈ç era, the game follows the exploits of the Imperial Combat Revue, a military unit dedicated to fighting supernatural threats against Tokyo while maintaining their cover as a theater troupe. Imperial Japanese Navy Ensign Ichiro Ogami is assigned leader of its all-female Flower Division, a group of women with magical abilities that defend Tokyo against demon attacks using steam-powered armor called Kobus. He becomes embroiled in both the group's latest conflict with the Hive of Darkness and the personal lives of its members. Hiroi created the concept for what would become Sakura Wars in 1990. In 1993, his small team in the Planning Department of Red Company began elaborating on his concept, with full development beginning the following year after being approved by Sega. Several prominent figures were brought on board the project including writer Satoru Akahori, composer Kohei Tanaka, and character designer K≈çsuke Fujishima. Although the game was only published in Japan, English-speaking players have been able to play Sakura Wars due to an unofficial fan translation released in 2019. The game was a critical and commercial success, becoming one of the highest-selling titles for the Saturn, and spawned many successful sequels and supplementary titles in the form of the Sakura Wars series. A direct sequel, Sakura Wars 2: Thou Shalt Not Die, was released in 1998. Gameplay Sakura Wars is a cross-genre video game in which the player controls Ichiro Ogami and the all-female Flower Division of the Imperial Combat Revue, who must save Tokyo from the Hive of Darkness. Dubbed a \\"dramatic adventure\\" game and taking place across 10 episodes, the gameplay segments incorporate tactical role-playing, dating sim, and visual novel elements. It has two gameplay modes: an adventure mode and a battle mode. The adventure mode is divided between periods where Ogami navigates the Grand Imperial Theater and interacts with various characters, while the battle mode is governed by a turn-based battle system on a tilted grid-based battlefield. Progress is saved at the end of each episode, and the player may also save the game during intermissions. In the adventure mode, Ogami navigates the theater during limited time sequences between battles. This game introduces the Live & Interactive Picture System (LIPS). When Ogami is faced with critical choices during conversations with both members of the Flower Division and supporting characters within the combat revue, dialogue trees are displayed with a time limit for the player to input. Depending on the type of response, the character may respond positively or negatively, impacting their relationship with Ogami and future interactions. Other actions within LIPS include holding the cursor over parts of a character's portrait to trigger internal monologues and varying responses from the characters. Each main heroine has different personality quirks that must be taken into consideration while talking with them, with correct responses raising their \\"Trust\\". In the battle mode, the Flower Division fights demons using machines called Kobus. Each unit has its own turn, with each turn allowing two actions. These actions include \\"Attack\\", \\"Defend\\", \\"Move\\", \\"Deathblow\\" (a critical strike that can kill a normal enemy in one hit), Charge (store energy for a more powerful action during the next turn), and Heal (which restores health points (HP) to a chosen unit). Different units specialize in different skills such as support actions, melee attacks, or ranged attacks. Units have varying movement abilities based on available space and unit statistics, as well as a separate attack range based on their weapon type. Actions taken during LIPS sequences with members of the Flower Division directly impact battles; raised trust during LIPS segments grant statistic increases and subsequently improve combat ability. The game ends when certain conditions, such as winning a battle, are not met or if the HP on Ogami's Kobu reaches zero, although the player can continue by selecting \\"Rematch\\". The game also contains animated cutscenes and musical numbers. Synopsis In 1923, Imperial Japanese Navy Ensign Ichiro Ogami is transferred to the Imperial Combat Revue, a secret combat unit based in Tokyo. Meanwhile, swordswoman Sakura Shinguji arrives from Sendai as the Assault Force's latest recruit and meets Ogami at Ueno Park. Traveling to the Grand Imperial Theater together, Ogami meets the team's main actresses: Sumire Kanzaki, Maria Tachibana, Iris Chateaubriand, Kanna Kirishima, and Kohran Ri. The theater's manager Ikki Yoneda tells Ogami he has been assigned as an usher. Initially bemused and hurt by his assignment, it turns out to be a bluff to decide his worth. The Imperial Combat Revue also functions as a theater troupe called the Imperial Revue. Central to the unit is the Flower Division, the Imperial Revue's main actresses, who use their spirit powers to defend Tokyo against demon attacks using steam-powered armor called Kobu. The current wave of attacks is being controlled by the Hive of Darkness, a group of black magicians led by Tenkai and his powerful subordinates the Lords of Death. Tenkai's goal is to restore the shogunate and banish the growing Western influences from Japan, with the Hive of Darkness destroying magical seals around Tokyo that keep a powerful demonic horde at bay. As the Flower Division battles the Hive of Darkness, each member must confront their personal problems to function as an effective combat unit. Ogami also becomes involved in the running of the theater and is witness to on-stage incidents including Sakura bringing down the stage during one performance through her clumsiness, and Kanna and Sumire clashing on stage during another. The Flower Division are unsuccessful in preventing the Hive of Darkness from destroying the seals, allowing Tenkai to summon a magical fortress from which he intends to conquer Japan. The Flower Division storm the fortress and destroy Tenkai and the fortress. During these events, Ogami becomes close to each member and can pursue a romantic relationship. The city recovers as the group relaxes, but a surviving Hive of Darkness member Kuroki Satan launches a fresh attack, renaming himself \\"Aoi Satan\\". He is actually Shinnosuke Yamazaki, a former comrade of Yoneda who was presumed killed with Sakura's father Kazuma when creating the original seals. Yamazaki survived and was possessed by the true Satan, being responsible for controlling the demons and resurrecting Tenkai. Yoneda's deputy, Ayame Fujieda, is turned into a demon using her suppressed feelings for Ogami. Satan summons a great fortress called the Seima Castle from the sea near Tokyo, intent on releasing the population of Hell to overrun humanity. Using the airship Mikasa, the Imperial Combat Revue launch a concentrated attack on the castle. They successfully unite their spiritual power to banish Satan back to Hell. Ayame's demon form is destroyed at the cost of her life, and after bidding farewell she ascends to Heaven as an angel named Michael. After Aoi Satan's defeat, the final scene varies depending on whether Ogami romanced a member of the Flower Division and which member he chose. Production =Concept and development= Oji Hiroi created the concept for what would become Sakura Wars in 1990. He saw a Japanese stage production of the play Shanghai Rhapsody and was impressed by the spectacle of the acting troop he saw on stage. In 1993, Hiroi and anime composer Kohei Tanaka worked together on an original video animation (OVA) adaptation of the video game Tengai Makyou: Ziria. Hiroi was highly impressed by Tanaka's music, to the point where he wanted him to create a musical set to it. This concept evolved into his wish for Tanaka to score a video game focused on the theater. Later in 1993, a small team in the Planning Department of Red Company (now Red Entertainment) led by Hiroi began promoting his concept and planning the game's basic concepts. At this stage, the project was titled to connect it with Japan. It was described as an \\"example plan\\" rather than a practical project. While distinct from the final Sakura Wars the proposal shared an alternate historical setting with steampunk technology, a female lead and mecha combat. In addition to Hiroi, the team included Ryoma Kaneko and Naoki Morita, who would later work on Sakura Wars proper. While developing the \\"Sakura\\" proposal, Hiroi and his team created two tabletop role-playing games dubbed \\"Sakura 1\\" and \\"Sakura 2\\". This resulted in the strategy elements almost overriding the game's other aspects. Inspired by the combination of tactical combat and the story used in the Fire Emblem series, Hiroi steered the project more in that direction. Influences from contemporary anime were also added to bring depth to the story and characters. With the basic elements defined, the team continued refining the project for between half a year and a year. Convinced of the project's potential to become a video game, Hiroi presented \\"Sakura\\" to multiple game companies, but none of them had confidence in the project. Despite his determination to see the project realized, Hiroi put the project aside with no expectation that it would be produced. In 1994, following Hiroi's decision to put Sakura aside, Shoichiro Irimajiri‚Äîthen vice president of Sega‚Äîcontacted him about the possibility of developing a game with a popular mascot character for Sega's in-development Sega Saturn home console. Irimajiri wanted a unique video game property for the system and had heard positive feedback about Hiroi's work. Hiroi was initially reluctant but eventually accepted Irimajiri's offer, inviting him and other potential contributors to spend a fortnight's holiday in Saipan. Hiroi later said the decision to work on a game for the Saturn was a hard one, as he had previously worked on games for rival unspecified home console systems. It was Sega's favorable response to his pitch that persuaded him to develop Sakura Wars on the Saturn. Hiroi pitched his old concept for Sakura to Irimajiri during their stay on Saipan. While Hiroi harbored doubts as to whether such an ambitious and unusual project would be accepted, Irimajiri was convinced. On their return to Japan, Sega and Red Company began development on Hiroi's project. That October, it was given the title Sakura Wars. Due to problems trademarking the kanji version of Sakura because it is the native name for cherry blossom, the word \\"Sakura\\" was written in katakana instead. The inclusion of adventure segments alongside the strategic simulation elements was contentious early on, with some fearing Sakura Wars would turn into a bish≈çjo game. The strategic segments were designed to feel like interactive anime battles, with everyone getting a chance to attack as in many anime fight sequences of the time. The wish for an anime style also came through in the adventure segments with LIPS, turning conversations into a kind of confrontation to be won. LIPS was born out of staff frustration with the adventure game tradition of time freezing while the player decided which response to select in a tense situation. By implementing a time limit, the team made Sakura Wars more interactive and removed this frustration. The \\"LIPS\\" name was chosen for its distinct sound rather than any special meaning. Full development of LIPS began after running a test using a scene where Ogami could choose whether to look inside a shower cubicle. The battle sequences were inspired by similar scenes found in the Kamen Rider and Ultraman television shows. The two shows' violence was actively referenced during the last battle with the combined final attack of the entire Flower Division. Each battle sequence was hand-crafted by one member of staff to simplify production. The game's \\"Trust\\" system was a means of incorporating simulation elements without utilizing role-playing elements such as experience points. The decision to remove experience points entirely proved controversial within the team. According to director Tomoyuki Ito, the process of creating \\"Trust\\" and associated systems was based on trial and error, mainly around how best to express it. Development of Sakura Wars lasted for approximately three years‚Äîdouble the original estimate. Hiroi acted as the general producer, while Ito acted as a director. Buildup Entertainment and Neverland developed the computer-generated imagery (CGI) segments, and the anime cinematics were directed by Shunji Oga and produced by Sega-owned studio Kyokuichi Tokyo Movie (later TMS Entertainment). Sega initially outsourced programming to an unnamed external company. By 1995 it had already developed one or two chapters of the game's combat-based content before Hiroi objected to the direction the game was taking. It was becoming a generic simulation game that deviated from his vision. Red Company refused to continue development of the prototype, and it was removed from development. Sega's CS Research & Development No. 2 (CS2 R&D;) division desired the game's completion, so they co-developed it with Red Company. The conflicting gameplay elements needed to be divided between different teams within CS2 R&D;, only bringing the two parts together at the end of development. Because of this development technique, none of the elements could be effectively tested until the game was close to completion. As a result of these difficulties, the Sega team found production difficult. Sega stated that Sakura Wars was their most expensive video game production to date, although no exact budget was given. =Art design= The main cast of Sakura Wars as portrayed in later original video animation adaptations. Each character was designed around a particular theme, with battle outfits modelled on tuxedos. Manga artist K≈çsuke Fujishima, who at the time was working on the long-running manga series Oh My Goddess!, designed the main cast. Before Fujishima joined the project, the characters had placeholder designs created by Red Company staff. His editors resisted letting him do the designs due to his heavy workload, including his commitment to Oh My Goddess!. Sakura Wars was the first time Fujishima had worked with Sega or been associated with a Sega property. He was skeptical of the project because of the state it was in when he was first approached. It was in a very early stage of development and neither the story nor gameplay mechanics had been finalized. Red Company's placeholder character designs were in place at a time when it was uncertain whether Fujishima would join, but Hiroi was adamant he would be the character designer. Fujishima eventually joined the project in late 1994. His first design was for Sakura. The first sketches for Sakura moved Hiroi to tears and fully convinced both Red Company and Sega that Fujishima was the right designer. The positive reception to Fujishima's work, together with his understanding of the project's goals, helped raise staff morale for the entire project. Fujishima was responsible for designing eight characters including Ogami and Sakura, along with formal and casual clothes, and accessories. Hidenori Matsubara designed the supporting cast and helped with general animation. Fujishima found it easy to design the characters as their concepts had been firmly established before he created the first drafts and moved on to the final designs. The designs were meant to communicate the characters' inner thoughts and had to be understandable for players. Due to the game's Taish≈ç period setting, he needed to stop himself adding anachronistic elements like fasteners. Hiroi made detailed character sheets for Fujishima to use when designing the cast. An example was Sumire, whose personality was communicated through her clothes. Each character had distinct traits, such as a ponytail and hakama kimono for Sakura. Fujishima combined these elements with his own design ideas for the final artwork. The Taish≈ç period meant he could combine traditional Japanese clothing with Western accessories such as shoes, allowing the female characters an otherwise improbable range of movement. His design for each main protagonist‚Äîfrom Ogami to the Flower Division members‚Äîdirectly mirrored Hiroi's concepts for them. The Flower Division's battle dress was modeled after the tuxedo, and Fujishima compared them with the costumes of the Takarazuka Revue. Futoshi Nagata created the Kobu mecha designs, along with the game's CGI sequences. His initial design outline from Hiroi was the basic concept of using steampunk technology within the Taish≈ç period. When designing the Kobu, Nagata was guided by Morita, who showed him photographs of both steam-powered trains and early deep-sea diving suits‚Äîspecifically those made of spherical segments. Nagata did extensive research on the Second Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom and consciously avoided the trope of anachronistic near-future technology while creating the designs. The concept of a diving suit was integrated into the concept for the Kobu being reinforced armor rather than robots. Its front was designed after the steam trains that ran on the Aji Express Line. For each Flower Division member's Kobu armor, Nagata designed them to mirror their traits and beauty so they would be unique. Since the Kobu were meant to be armor, they were not given faces. Because Nagata was brought on early in the game's production, he had considerable freedom when submitting and adjusting his designs. When the designs were finalized, Nagata began working full-time on CGI, finishing the first Kobu model in five days. =Scenario and characters= When Hiroi was creating the original concept for Sakura Wars, he had trouble picking the exact era in which the story would take place. He initially considered using the Sh≈çwa period, with a focus on the post-war black market. He also considered setting it shortly before and during World War II. Hiroi eventually abandoned this idea as there was too much documentation about the Sh≈çwa period making its use as a fantasy setting complicated. He next considered using the Meiji period, which was a time of turbulence after the fall of the isolationist Tokugawa Shogunate that saw Western Culture introduced into Japan. Hiroi also abandoned this idea as Meiji-era Japan could not allow for the \\"modern\\" feeling he wanted. With this in mind, Hiroi settled on using the Taish≈ç period as the setting for Sakura Wars. The Taish≈ç period involved Japan integrating Western culture into its own, allowing for political changes and the emancipation of women after a prolonged feudal period. In the original draft, the story was much darker, with a key event being the Great Kant≈ç earthquake and the resultant breakdown of the Taish≈ç period. This version was almost entirely discarded. Hiroi wanted to create a version of the Taish≈ç period where the social advances and freedoms the Japanese began exploring continued without being brought to an end by the Great Kant≈ç earthquake and the subsequent shift to militarism before World War II. Another reason for using the Taish≈ç period was the lack of documentation about it and Tokyo's development because the Great Kant≈ç earthquake destroyed much of it. Originally Hiroi wanted to distinguish the Sakura Wars Taish≈ç from the historical Taish≈ç by modifying the kanji slightly. He did not do this because his staff wanted a world that blended real and fictional events. To further distinguish it, Hiroi made use of steampunk technology in the game's world. Despite it being a fantastic version of the Taish≈ç period, Hiroi did his best to incorporate realistic elements. The world's general setting, while conceived by Hiroi, was further developed and fleshed out by Kaneko and Morita. Author and screenwriter Satoru Akahori wrote the main script and branching storylines. Hiroi felt the script would lose entertainment value if he wrote it himself as the setting was based on family stories. He had previously worked with Akahori on other projects. When Akahori first heard the concept before talking with Hiroi he was highly skeptical, but Hiroi convinced him to come on board. When he was first pitched the project, all that had been finalized was that the story would involve young girls and mecha. Akahori was unsure how to approach the project as he had never written for a video game. Hiroi told him to write the story like an anime television series. When Akahori first joined the team, the story was still unfinished. The only points that had been finalized were its setting, the overall theme of steampunk mecha combat, and a cast of five or six characters. Akahori's early work was focused on expanding the narrative and characters based on Hiroi's draft. Due to the deep connection to Hiroi's family history, Akahori could not work on the script by himself and needed to consult frequently with Hiroi. Hiroi also insisted on making frequent changes if Akahori's work did not fall in line with his vision. Akahori wrote a thirteen-episode storyline for the game, with the final battle taking place across three episodes. After talks with staff, the final battle was condensed into a single chapter, bringing the game to its current ten-episode length. Kaneko and Morita created the additional dialogue around Akahori's main scenario, and worked on script editing and debugging. Creating strong representative characters was part of Sega's request for a new mascot character for their Saturn system. A major element of the cast was taking advantage of the game's setting. It could allow for characters from countries outside Japan‚Äîlike Russia and France‚Äîto be part of the Imperial Combat Revue. During early planning, Hiroi produced character concepts for the Flower Division, imitating character archetypes commonly found in high school manga. Using this inspiration, he created a gentle yet strong-willed woman (Sakura), a rival character with a negative first impression (Sumire), a cold leader figure (Maria), a small cute character who would be jealous of the other members (Iris), a woman who would be good at athletics (Kanna) and an oddball character who wore glasses (Kohran). The role of the male protagonist was given initially to a young man named Kusaku Kanuma, a member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department who inherits a blade forged by the Japanese swordsmith Muramasa and must work with Sakura to pilot a two-person mech. As with most of the draft scenario, the male character underwent major alterations. Most of the protagonist's development into Ichiro Ogami happened after Akahori joined the team. He created Ogami's role as an avatar for the player who could be friends with every member of the Flower Division. The Japanese word for \\"wolf\\" , referring to his energetic personality traits, inspired his name. =Audio= Casting When casting actors to voice the game's characters, Hiroi needed people who could both act and sing the musical numbers. To this end, he required potential voice actors to have experience with live stage performance and be able to sing. Hiroi personally approached each of the voice actresses who played members of the Imperial Combat Revue based on their acting and singing abilities before they were pitched the concept of Sakura Wars. Staff members recommended several actresses to Hiroi. Bringing together the voice cast for a video game at such an early stage was unheard of at the time. Because of this, the cast recorded their lines and songs as the game was developed. *Chisa Yokoyama voiced Sakura. Hiroi chose Yokoyama, who had appeared in notable anime series including Tenchi Muyo!, based on his wish to create a compelling final deathblow line. She was originally cast in the role of Iris but was recast in the role of Sakura after Iris' final voice actress was cast. Yokoyama was used to recording strong characters, so portraying Sakura as a \\"normal\\" girl made the role difficult for her to perform. *Urara Takano voiced Maria. Hiroi offered her the role because of her positive working experiences with Yokoyama. Takano was performing in a concert when Hiroi first approached her. Although the project was in the early stages of development, she was intrigued by Maria's character and agreed to take the role. *Michie Tomizawa voiced Sumire. Hiroi first approached her in late 1994 during a Christmas concert on the recommendation of a mutual friend. Hiroi pitched his concept for Sumire, and after seeing Tomizawa's performance offered her the role. *Mayumi Tanaka voiced Kanna. Hiroi selected her for the role based on her experience performing the comedic \\"handsome man\\" archetype in kabuki stage performances. Tanaka was instructed to play Kanna as a tomboyish character unconcerned by her true gender. *Yuriko Fuchizaki voiced Kohran. Fujishima recommended her to Hiroi. She was approached in mid-1995 when recording was being planned for the opening and ending themes, and questions were still being asked by the cast about how to portray the characters. *Kumiko Nishihara voiced Iris. After hearing Nishihara's performance as Sakura, Yokoyama, who was originally given the role of Iris, suggested they switch roles and Nishihara became Iris' voice actress. *Ai Orikasa voiced Ayame. She was planning a fan club concert when Hiroi approached her about Sakura Wars on Yokoyama's recommendation. After seeing Ayame's performance, Hiroi offered her the role. While recording her part, Orikasa encountered difficulties portraying the three different versions of Ayame's character. *Akio Suyama voiced Ogami. At the time, Suyama had little to no voice acting experience and was working part-time at Red Company while training as a voice actor. Hiroi was still looking for a voice actor for Ogami but had a limited budget. On hearing of Hiroi's situation, Suyama offered to take on the role, despite there being only a few notable lines. Faced with his budget and time limitations, Hiroi accepted his offer. Ogami was the last main character to be cast. Once selected, Hiroi and Tanaka gathered the cast and told them about the project. They were given pictures of their respective characters. The recording sessions were overseen by noted anime and feature film sound director Toshio Sato. He followed Hiroi's request that the characters be portrayed as real people. Sato was initially shocked at being given four script books and told they were just one-third of the script. Sato told the cast voices would be the characters' main emotive force, as the faces of character portraits would be mostly static. Sakura was the last character to be recorded so Sato could focus on how to bring out her heroine status alongside the other characters. One of the elements Sato concentrated on was portraying the fractious relationship between newcomer Sakura and established star Sumire. Music The score for Sakura Wars was Kohei Tanaka's first successful video game music composition. He was among the first people to offer support for Hiroi's vision, as few people believed the project would come to fruition. Tanaka was also among the first brought on board for production and served as a teacher figure to the rest of the development team. In a later interview, he stated that he felt like his composing career was at risk while supporting the game. When he began composing the score in 1995, rhythm and percussion dominated Japanese popular music rather than melody. Both Tanaka and Hiroi wanted to reintroduce younger Japanese to beautiful melodies. While thinking about how he could construct the music, Tanaka looked at popular music from the game's time period and worked to re-create its melodies and structure using the popular music styles of the 1990s. Because of the setting and Tanaka's goals, he was able to incorporate multiple music genres including jazz, rumba, and samba alongside more traditional Japanese musical styles. Tanaka initially planned 50 songs, but this was too many to record and fit into the game within the allotted time and budget. The number was reduced to 24, then to seven. Hiroi was upset by the proposed cuts, so Tanaka asked how much music the team could manage and was told that one CD's worth of content was enough. Tanaka eventually settled on between eleven and twelve songs which made it into the final game. Hiroi wrote the lyrics for all the songs, despite repeatedly protesting that he was not a professional lyricist. Because of his self-professed inexperience, Tanaka ended up being a teacher figure for him. As part of his training, Hiroi went to karaoke sessions, studied the work of famous songwriter Y≈´ Aku, and bought old records of vintage songs. It took between one and two months before Hiroi felt competent enough at writing song lyrics. Sakura Wars songs all began with Hiroi creating the lyrics and then handing his work to Tanaka for polishing and to be set to music. Tanaka composed the main theme, , based on Hiroi's instruction to combine the music of a Super Sentai opening theme with the vocal style of the title song for the film Aoi sanmyaku (1949). The main theme was composed and approved in a very short time and Yokoyama sang it. Because of the structure of the song, and the variations in style and vocal strength it required, the recording sessions was a strenuous experience for her and required several takes. One of Tanaka's favorite pieces to compose was the ending theme , which represented the strong will of the Imperial Combat Revue. Yokoyama was the main vocalist, with backing and chorus work from the rest of the main female cast. The recording took an hour and proved to be an emotional experience for both singers and staff. As the songs were completed very early in the game's development, the rest of the development staff were able to work with them and use them as references when creating other parts of the game and storyline. The 1997 soundtrack album Sakura Wars Soundtrack: Steam Gramophone contains 51 tracks of music from Sakura Wars. It was published by BMG Japan. In addition to the original soundtrack album, a vocal collection was published by BMG Japan in 1996. Music for the 2003 remake, which features remastered versions of the original soundtrack, was also composed by Tanaka. The soundtrack for the 2003 remake was released by Avex Mode as an album, titled Sakura Wars: In Hot Blood Teigeki Complete Music Collection, shortly after the game's release in February 2003. Release Sakura Wars was first announced at a special Sega presentation in 1995 for release in April 1996. The game's unique blend of genres and styles resulted in it being labelled as a new genre dubbed \\"dramatic adventure\\" in its marketing. Because of the greatly increased amount of content‚Äîparticularly the amount of voice acting Hiroi wanted to include‚Äîthe release date was delayed several months at his insistence, and the game was expanded from a single disc to a two-disc release. To meet the new release date, the developers worked long hours and sometimes through the night. Several pieces of finished content needed to be cut to make the release date. Sakura Wars was released on September 27, 1996. It was reprinted on June 20, 1997, and released as a budget title on February 11, 1998. A port for the Dreamcast was released on May 25, 2000, and a version for i-mode mobile devices was released on December 18, 2006. It was ported with its sequel to the PlayStation Portable (PSP) and released on March 9, 2006. The game was also ported to multiple Microsoft Windows operating platforms. It was released for Windows 95 and Windows 98 systems on August 18, 2000, and for Windows ME and Windows 2000 on February 20, 2003. Because of the game's size, these versions were released on multiple CD-ROMs. A DVD-ROM version was released for Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista on January 25, 2007. ASCII Corporation also published two companion guide books for the Saturn release: Sakura Wars Official Guide: Battle Story on December 6, 1996, and Sakura Wars Official Guide: Romance Story on January 9, 1997; both were revised for the Dreamcast release and published by Enterbrain on June 3, 2000. While Hiroi wanted a Western release for the game, Sakura Wars was not released in English regions. The game's PSP port was scheduled for the North American market, but it was cancelled after Sony classified it as a text novel. Efforts at localizing the series were not undertaken due to Sega's uncertainty over whether the game's blend of genres would find a large enough audience in the West to be profitable. The PC version was twice licensed for release outside Japan; a Chinese version was released in Taiwan and mainland China by Dysin Interactive on August 17, 2001 and a Russian translation was published by Akella on January 11, 2006; it was the first Sakura Wars title to be localized into a European language. In 2019, a fan translation project for Sakura Wars led by C.J. Iwakura and Noah Steam was completed and made available on the internet as an unofficial patch. =PlayStation 2 Remake= In July 2002, a 3D remake of the game for the PlayStation 2 titled was announced as part of the Sakura Wars World Project, Sega's effort to introduce the Sakura Wars series to a new worldwide audience. Developed by Overworks, the successor to Sega's CS2 R&D; division, the remake was directed by Takaharu Terada, who had been battle planner for later Sakura Wars titles. The remake was conceived because unlike the sequels, the first game's previous versions seemed outdated. New CGI segments were created and the anime cinematics were produced by Production I.G. The subtitle was taken from a tanka featured in Midaregami, a collection of tanka by the famous Japanese writer and poet, Akiko Yosano. Hiroi enjoyed her work, so he featured quotes from her poems as subtitles for Sakura Wars titles several times after the first game's release. The number of graphics and artwork pieces was increased greatly, more recent and new LIPS functions were incorporated, and the Active and Real-time Machine System (ARMS) battle system introduced in later Sakura Wars titles was incorporated with new improvements including special attacks with accompanying short movies. Two additional story episodes were added. One expanded the story of one of the supporting characters, while the other connected to the next entry in the Sakura Wars series. New voice acting was recorded for the characters, with the original actresses returning; these included Tomizawa, who had previously announced her retirement from the role in the early 2000s. Terada positively noted the increased quality of voice recording compared to both the original version and the later Dreamcast titles. The music was redone by Tanaka, mainly at the insistence of the original voice cast. In Hot Blood was released on February 22, 2003. First print editions came with a special DVD which included a documentary detailing the development process of the Sakura Wars series to that point. Mobile-based tie-in content related to the original mini-games was released later that year. The content was initially going to be accessed through a direct cable connection, but due to driver capacity issues, Hiroi used a password system instead. Reception =Critical reviews= Due to its Japanese exclusivity, most of the English-language reviews for Sakura Wars were published years after the initial release. One contemporary English- language review was in 1996 by GameFan, which covered import games; a 2000 review rated the Dreamcast port of the game highly. Famitsu and Sega Saturn Magazine gave the original version of Sakura Wars high praise. The Dreamcast Magazine rated the Dreamcast port highly, though slightly lower than the Saturn release. Critics have also rated the game highly in retrospective reviews, most of which were published after the release of the 2000 Dreamcast port. Jake Alley of RPGamer was positive about the story and art design and its replay value but found the gameplay and aspects of its menu design lacking. RPGFans Nicole Kirk was highly positive about all aspects of the title, citing the artwork and voice acting as the main draw for players. GameSpots Peter Bartholow, reviewing the Dreamcast port, also praised the game's visuals and story, while noting a lack of real gameplay and the low degree of difficulty. Famitsu praised In Hot Blood, with reviewers noting that it was more like an entirely new game than a standard remake. Chris Winkler of RPGFan praised the visual upgrade from earlier versions and the continued quality of the music and voice acting. He also positively noted the theme of the clash between Japan's Edo-era cultural isolation and the cosmopolitan attitude after the Meiji Restoration. He concluded the game \\"can only be wholeheartedly recommended\\" for both series veterans and newcomers. At the first CESA Awards in 1996, Sakura Wars won Grand Award, as well as awards in the Best Director, Best Main Character and Best Supporting Character categories. =Sales= Several staff members were highly sceptical the game would be a commercial success, but Hiroi promised Sega that the game would sell at least 200,000 units. Sakura Wars sold out in many stores within hours of its release. According to Famitsu sales data, Sakura Wars sold an estimated 205,270 units in its first week, reaching the top of the sales charts and selling through just over 57% of its stocks. It was recorded as having the most sales of a Sega original title to that point. As of 2007, Sakura Wars for the Saturn has sold 359,485 units, becoming the 13th best-selling console title in Japan. The Dreamcast port debuted with 71,123 units, selling through nearly 65% of its shipment. It eventually reached total sales of 109,686 units, becoming the 33rd best-selling game for the platform. Sakura Wars: In Hot Blood debuted with sales of 142,351 units, reaching third place on Japanese gaming charts. Despite high anticipation, the remake was outsold by Star Ocean: Till the End of Time from Enix (second) and Dynasty Warriors 4 from Koei (first). During 2003, the remake sold 235,622 units, becoming the 54th best-selling title of the year. The Chinese PC version was apparently an unexpected success, with the first print selling out quickly. Legacy Sakura Wars was an unexpected success for both Red Company and Sega, prompting the companies to develop further entries in the series. It spawned three direct sequels; Sakura Wars 2: Thou Shalt Not Die for the Saturn, and Sakura Wars 3: Is Paris Burning? and Sakura Wars 4: Fall in Love, Maidens for the Dreamcast. A fourth sequel was developed for the PlayStation 2; known as Sakura Wars V: Farewell My Lovely in Japan, it was published overseas as Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love, becoming the first entry to release outside Japan. Numerous spin-off titles covering multiple genres related to each entry have also been developed for multiple platforms. Sakura Wars has remained popular in Japan since its release. It was rated as the 13th best game of all time in a 2006 Famitsu pole, with all the main entries then released also appearing in the list. Sakura herself was rated in 2009 by Famitsu as the 17th best Japanese video game character. In a poll published by Famitsu, Sakura Wars and its first sequel were both ranked among the ten most memorable games for the Saturn, while the Dreamcast port of Sakura Wars was also ranked among the most memorable for that platform. Characters from Sakura Wars, Sakura Wars 3 and Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love were included as playable characters in the 2012 Nintendo 3DS crossover title Project X Zone and its 2015 sequel. =Media adaptations= An OVA series dubbed Sakura Wars: The Gorgeous Blooming Cherry Blossoms was produced and released between 1997 and 1998. Created by Animate and Radix Ace Entertainment, it told a series of stories around events mentioned in Sakura Wars as well as origin stories for the Flower Division members. An anime series of the same name was broadcast in 2000 over a six-month period. Co-produced by Red Company, Madhouse and Studio Matrix, Ryutaro Nakamura directed the anime series. While following the basic plot of Sakura Wars and preserving Hiroi's original vision, several elements such as depictions of the main antagonist's past, Sakura's childhood memories and scenes within the Flower Division before Ogami's arrival were added. A major issue was being faithful to both the video game and OVAs while keeping within the restrictions of a television format. A manga adaptation written by Hiroi and illustrated by Ikku Masa, with cover illustrations by Fujishima, began serialization in 2002. The first series ended in December 2008, but its popularity led to a second ongoing series the following year. The first manga was originally serialized in Monthly Magazine Z until it closed down in 2008, shifting to other publications. The manga has been released as tank≈çbon since 2003 by the magazines' parent company Kodansha.

He was born in Droitwich, Worcestershire, in 1917, the third and youngest son of a relief signalman and a dressmaker. After a scholarship to the Royal Grammar School Worcester, he attended Birmingham College of Art from 1934 to 1939. During the Second World War, he served in the Royal Navy, where he encountered the poet Charles Causley, who was to remain a lifelong friend. He painted a number of portraits of Causley, and the poet dedicated his 1970 book of poems for children, Figgie Hobbin to Simmonds and his wife. Serving aboard the aircraft carrier , he observed the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Service in the Far East awoke an interest in oriental art, which is reflected in the colour-palette of some his later paintings. After the war, he studied at the Royal College of Art, graduating in 1948 with the ARCA in Painting. It was around this time that he married the artist Cynthia King, whom he had met at the college. In 1949 he began teaching art at Chislehurst and Sidcup Grammar School, where he was to remain for the entirety of his teaching career. Among his pupils was Quentin Blake, who has paid tribute to him as a mentor: > He was enormously helpful and valuable to me, as I am sure he was to many > others, because his commentary on your work was not a question of marks and > assessment but an adult exchange about what you had actually done. This is supported by the school's historian, who notes that Simmonds fought against the headmaster's \\"relentless drive for academic laurels\\". Style Droitwich Orchard by Stanley Simmonds. Oil on wood. 43cm x 43cmHis early work was purely figurative, with portraits, urban and country scenes, exemplified by Droitwich Orchard. These early works were praised by a reviewer as > lavish landscape oil paintings, which could be equated to the eloquence of > Wordsworth in a frame. Typical of his early work, the luscious strokes of > deep greens and bursts of colour capture England‚Äôs delicate wilderness > beautifully. In the post-war period, his paintings developed a more abstract approach, though still reflecting the physical world, as seen in a series of paintings of Billingsgate Market and its porters: > His paintings of the market document his journey from figuration through to > abstraction, exploring blocks of colour and tonal valuation but all imbued > with the light and atmosphere of the market at dawn. Billingsgate Porters by Stanley Simmonds. Oil on board, 53cm x 69cm. In later years he started to embrace a more complete abstraction, seen, for example, in the Untitled painting shown here, originally exhibited in 1960. Of Simmonds's development, Quentin Blake commented, > The Billingsgate paintings were evidently the fruit of many studies made on > site; but it wasn‚Äôt, you felt, the detail of everyday life that took the > artist‚Äôs attention as much as, together with substantial reality, the > architecture of forms supplied by the porters and their surroundings. Those > pictures were soon followed by a remarkable development into abstraction. > What was formerly substance becomes atmosphere. It is a world of movement, > distance, luminosity, but one which the architecture of the canvas is still > disposed with authority. Untitled, 1960, by Stanley Simmonds. His retirement to Cornwall saw a return to more representational work, such as the paintings of the Barbican harbour in Plymouth, though these still had a strong abstract flavour. Exhibitions He exhibited at the Royal Academy and with the London Group. In 1958, he was part of the ‚ÄúContemporary British Landscape Painters‚Äù exhibition at the Bear Lane Gallery, Oxford, along with John Piper, John Bratby and Ivon Hitchens, and he had a number of further exhibitions at that gallery. In 1963 Hertford College, Oxford hosted a joint exhibition of his and Quentin Blake's work. In 1978 he was awarded The George Rowney Prize for Oil Painting in ‚ÄòThe Spirit of London Competition‚Äô. Alongside his work as a painter, he undertook book illustration and theatre design. Later life In 1983 he retired from teaching, and he and Cynthia moved to South Petherwin, near Launceston in Cornwall, home of his friend Charles Causley. There he set up a studio in a former Bible Christian chapel, where he continued to paint until his death in 2006. Cynthia Simmonds died in 2012. Retrospective exhibitions of his work were held in Launceston in 2012, organised by the Charles Causley Society, Lewes in 2014 and Egdean, Sussex in 2015. The Lewes retrospective was described by Quentin Blake as \\"an eloquent tribute to an exemplary life in art\\".

Created by Jim Aparo and Mike W. Barr for the first issue of Outsiders, they are androids designed by a dying nuclear scientist to resemble himself and his deceased family. The Nuclear Family made their first live adaptation in the DC Universe series' first season of Titans, where they were portrayed by Jeff Clarke, Melody Johnson, Jeni Ross, Logan Thompson, and Zach Smadu. Publication history The Nuclear Family first appeared in Outsiders #1 and were created by Jim Aparo and Mike W. Barr. Fictional team history An early nuclear science researcher named Dr. Eric Shanner made some careless mistakes during his research which ended up exposing him and his family to dangerous levels of radiation. His family died and he was rendered ill with radiation poisoning. Afterward, Dr. Shanner made a vow to teach the world about the dangers of radiation. His began years later by building six androids resembling a younger version of his family, including himself. Each android was equipped with powers matching the various effects of nuclear weapons. Dr. Shanner then sent them to destroy the city of Los Angeles where they managed to damage the Esperanza Canyon Nuclear Power Plant during its opening day. When the Nuclear Family returned the next day to destroy the nuclear power plant, they ran afoul of the Outsiders but managed to defeat them. After briefly holding Looker captive and sedated, they fought the Outsiders again where they managed to destroy the Nuclear Family while Dr. Shanner expired from his nuclear radiation illness. During the Infinite Crisis storyline, the Nuclear Family has been rebuilt and are seen as member of Alexander Luthor Jr.'s Secret Society of Super Villains. They were seen taking part in the Battle of Bl√ºdhaven. Members The Nuclear Family have different powers and all have an immunity to radiation. The Nuclear Family consists of: * Dad - The patriarch of the Nuclear Family. He can fly and emit immense amounts of radiation from his body. * Mom - The matriarch of the Nuclear Family. She can fly and project an electromagnetic pulse which can kill and disable all electronic equipment around her. * Biff - The oldest son of the Nuclear Family. He can fly and emit a thermal pulse that gives off the same heat found in a nuclear explosion. * Sis - The only daughter of the Nuclear Family. She can fly and create a blast wave that can take down entire buildings. * Brat - The youngest son of the Nuclear Family. He can fly and transform himself into radioactive fallout. * Dog - The pet of the Nuclear Family. It can fly and transform itself into radioactive fallout. In other media * The Nuclear Family appears in the Justice League Action episode \\"Nuclear Family Values\\" with Dad voiced by Kevin Shinick, Mom and Brat voiced by Melissa Disney, Biff voiced by Jason J. Lewis, and Sis voiced by Rachel Kimsey while dog sound effects were used for Dog. In this show, the Nuclear Family were originally built by Dr. Eric Shanner during the Cold War to show people the side effects of using nuclear weapons. While the Nuclear Family were programmed to behave like a real family, they were unaware that they were androids. When a nuclear explosion went off, the Nuclear Family were not destroyed and absorbed the blast and its radiation fallout. Upon gaining sentience and nuclear-related powers, the Nuclear Family escaped the test site where they plan to find a place they could call home. They go on a rampage where they plan to destroy a nuclear power plant and run afoul of Firestorm the Nuclear Man. When the Nuclear Family traps Firestorm in the main reactor in order to start a chain reaction, Martin Stein advises Firestorm to have one of the Nuclear Family members do a supercharge to the fuel rod pool. Turning a floatie into the squirrel floatie, Firestorm tricks Dog into getting in so that it can do a supercharge to the fuel rod pool, which was enough to free Firestorm. The Nuclear Family then engage Firestorm in battle, while Mom works to raise the reactor to high temperatures. Firestorm uses the water from the fuel rod pool to restrain the Nuclear Family as Firestorm \\"hugs it out\\" with them. It is then shown that Firestorm had placed the Nuclear Family in a smaller replica of a typical family house so that they will not cause any more trouble and damage. * The Nuclear Family appear in Titans with Dad portrayed by Jeff Clarke, Mom portrayed by Melody Johnson, Sis portrayed by Jeni Ross, Biff portrayed by Logan Thompson, and a second patriarch, Nuclear Stepdad, portrayed by Zach Smadu. In the series, they are depicted as humans who were brainwashed by Dr. Adamson to become assassins under Trigon and use a serum to enhance their abilities. Referred to as \\"The Family\\", they are activated by Dr. Adamson to track down and capture Rachel Roth, Trigon's daughter. They initially succeed in abducting Rachel after defeating Dick Grayson, Hank Hall, and Dawn Granger in a surprise attack, but Rachel is rescued by Kory Anders, who kills Dad. The Family, now joined by Stepdad, later finds Rachel at a motel where they are defeated and captured following a battle with Dick, Rachel, Kory and Garfield Logan. When Dr. Adamson learns of their capture, they are killed when he detonates planted explosives in their heads.

She joined the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the 1950s. Hayden graduated from Howard University with a master's degree in chemistry, and became an expert in spectrophotometry, the measurement of how substances absorb light. She published work on infrared and other techniques for analyzing chemicals in a range of journals. Hayden was appointed Chief of the Spectrophotometer Research Branch in the Division of Pharmaceutical Chemistry at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1963, and may have been the first African-American scientist at the FDA. Hayden came to national attention in 1963 when she led the team that exposed the common substance in Krebiozen, a long-controversial alternative and expensive drug promoted as anti-cancer. Education Alma Levant was born in Greenville, South Carolina on March 30, 1927 and graduated with honors in 1947 from South Carolina State College, a historically black college in Orangeburg, South Carolina. Originally planning to be a nurse, she found herself so interested in chemistry that she \\"just didn't want to part from it\\". She gained a master's degree in chemistry from Howard University. Career Hayden joined the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases at the NIH. The above photograph was taken there in 1952, showing her working with a technique called paper chromatography, spraying reagent on liquids dropped onto paper to detect precursors to steroids. In the mid-1950s Hayden moved to the FDA, where she may have been the first person of color to work at the Agency. There had reportedly been a reluctance to employ African-Americans there because scientific officers may have to give testimony in courts, and there was concern about how this would be received in some parts of the U.S. In 1963, Hayden became Chief of the Spectrophotometer Research Branch in the Division of Pharmaceutical Chemistry. In 1962 in the wake of the Thalidomide tragedy, the Kefauver Harris Amendment increased the FDA's role in ensuring drug safety.Peltzman, Sam. An Evaluation of Consumer Protection Legislation: The 1962 Drug Amendments. The Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 81, No. 5. (Sep. ‚Äì Oct. 1973), pp. 1051. With these provisions in place, the FDA sought to identify the ingredients in Krebiozen, a controversial and expensive alternative cancer treatment. Hayden assigned students in her branch the task of seeing whether spectrometer images of Krebiozen matched any of the 20,000 alphabetically-listed images on file at the FDA. On September 3, 1963, a likely match was quickly found in the \\"C\\"s: a common substance, creatine. It occurs in the body at a far higher level than contained in Krebiozen, and had been shown to have no impact on cancer in animals. Spectrophotometry and crystallography studies were conducted independently by three teams, including scientists from MIT. The discovery was announced at a press conference. Hayden's report is detailed in the U.S. Congressional Record. Hayden testified at the lengthy criminal trial of the promoters of Krebiozen, Stevan Durovic and Andrew C. Ivy. Personal life Hayden married a fellow NIH research chemist, Alonzo R. Hayden. Alonzo Hayden was from West Virginia, with a PhD from the University of Wisconsin. He had also undertaken postgraduate studies at Howard University, and worked at the NIH from 1952 to 1958. Alonzo also worked in the US Department of Agriculture for the research facility in Beltsville, MD. The Haydens had two children, Michael and Andrea.

The journal had published a peer-reviewed article by Tuvel in which she compared the situation of Caitlyn Jenner, a trans woman, to that of Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who identifies as black. When the article was criticized on social media, scholars associated with Hypatia joined in the criticism and urged the journal to retract it.Singal, Jesse (2 May 2017). \\"This Is What a Modern-Day Witch Hunt Looks Like\\". New York magazine. The controversy exposed a rift within the journal's editorial team and more broadly within feminism and academic philosophy. In the article‚Äî\\"In Defense of Transracialism\\", published in Hypatias spring 2017 issue on 25 April‚ÄîTuvel argued that \\"[s]ince we should accept transgender individuals' decisions to change sexes, we should also accept transracial individuals' decisions to change races.\\" After a small group on Facebook and Twitter criticized the article and attacked Tuvel, an open letter began circulating, naming one of Hypatias editorial board as its point of contact and urging the journal to retract the article. The article's publication had sent a message, the letter said, that \\"white cis scholars may engage in speculative discussion of these themes\\" without engaging \\"theorists whose lives are most directly affected by transphobia and racism\\". On 1 May the journal's Facebook page apologized for the article's publication on behalf of \\"a majority\\" of Hypatias associate editors. By the following day the open letter had 830 signatories, including scholars associated with Hypatia and two members of Tuvel's dissertation committee. Hypatias editor-in-chief, Sally Scholz, and its board of directors stood by the article.Schuessler, Jennifer (19 May 2017). \\"A Defense of ‚ÄòTransracial‚Äô Identity Roils Philosophy World\\". The New York Times. When Scholz resigned in July 2017, the board suspended the associate editors' authority to appoint the next editor, in response to which eight associate editors resigned. The directors set up a task force to restructure the journal's governance. In February 2018 the directors themselves were replaced. The academic community responded with support for Tuvel.Walters, Suzanna Danuta (5 May 2017). \\"Academe's Poisonous Call-Out Culture\\". The Chronicle of Higher Education..

At the time of the dispute in April 2017, the journal was published by John Wiley & Sons. Miriam Solomon (Temple) was president of the board of directors and Sally Scholz (Villanova) editor-in-chief. In addition to the directors and editorial staff, in April 2017 there was a 25-strong editorial board; a 10-member advisory board; 12 local editorial advisors; and a board of 10 associate editors.

Jenner became one of Glamour magazine's Women of the Year and appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair, while Dolezal lost her position as president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People chapter in Spokane, Washington, and became, in her view, unemployable.Engber, Daniel (30 May 2017). \\"Are Angry Mobs on Facebook Taking Over Academia?\\". Slate. \\"Caitlyn Jenner Glamour Women of the Year 2015 Award Acceptance Speech\\". Glamour, 9 November 2015. P√©rez- Pe√±a, Richard (12 June 2015). \\"Black or White? Woman's Story Stirs Up a Furor\\". The New York Times. Tuvel was not interested in the details of the cases but in their structure. She set about writing an argument in support of the position: \\"Since we should accept transgender individuals' decisions to change sexes, we should also accept transracial individuals' decisions to change races.\\" =Arguments= Tuvel suggests that \\"[g]enerally, we treat people wrongly when we block them from assuming the personal identity they wish to assume.\\" Self-identification and social recognition of the new identity are the two components needed for a successful change. As an example, she offers conversion to Judaism; if there is no reason to block the conversion, such as the rabbi doubting the seriousness of the commitment, transition to the new identity will be accepted. Arguing for \\"an account of race that allows for racial membership on the basis of social treatment and ... self-identification\\", she maintains that race is a malleable social construct and that, while ancestry‚Äîa feature external to the body‚Äîis a highly valued determinant of race in America, its value varies elsewhere. In Brazil, for example, Dolezal's self-identification as black, her living as someone society had accepted as black, and her exposure to black culture, would be enough to deem her black, according to Tuvel. Tuvel addresses four objections to transracialism. First, a claim to be black requires the experience of having grown up with the suffering anti-black racism causes; the journalist Tour√© called this the \\"one thing that binds black people\\".; Schwartz, Ian (16 June 2015). \\"Toure Roasts Rachel Dolezal: \\"The One Thing That Binds Black People Is The Experience Of Racism\\". RealClear Politics. That trans women are not raised with the suffering caused by sexism is not reason enough, Tuvel argues, to reject their identification as women. Therefore, in Tuvel's view, Dolezal's experience of racism while living as a black woman would be sufficient exposure. A second objection is that Dolezal cannot identify as black because of the importance placed in America on ancestry; no matter the facts, there is intersubjective agreement that ancestry matters. Tuvel argues that this position holds the possibility of change \\"hostage to the status quo\\". Third, there is an objection that the black community is harmed when a white person seeks to enter it; Dolezal's passing as black was compared to blackface. Tuvel distinguishes between problematic and unproblematic identification. Dolezal's self-identification was not based on a change in physical appearance alone; there was nothing insulting about it; it did not appear to be temporary; there were no questionable ends; and there was no reinforcement of harmful stereotypes. It was therefore an example of unproblematic identification, Tuvel argues. A fourth objection is that Dolezal was engaged in a \\"wrongful exercise of white privilege\\": a white person can restore their white privilege whenever they need it, while a black person is denied this ease of movement. Tuvel writes that the same argument applies to trans women, especially before surgery; that someone could return to male privilege should not preclude their transition. =Peer review and publication= The paper thanks J. Baird Callicott (UNT), Andrew Forcehimes (NTU) and David Gray (UofM) for having read earlier drafts. Tuvel submitted the article to Hypatia on 12 February 2016,\\"Publication history\\", \\"In Defense of Transracialism\\", Hypatia, 25 April 2017. and on 26 February she presented it to a conference at the University of Waterloo.\\"Philosophy Colloquium Series 2015-2016\\", University of Waterloo. Retrieved 9 May 2017. The manuscript was revised on 24 September and accepted for publication on 10 October 2016, after the standard double-blind peer review by at least two reviewers. Tina Fernandes Botts On 4 January 2017 Tuvel presented the paper to the American Philosophical Association Eastern Division.\\"2017 Eastern Division abstracts of accepted papers\\". American Philosophical Association. Retrieved 7 May 2017. The scheduled commentators were Kris Sealey (Fairfield), a Hypatia reviewer in 2016, and Tina Fernandes Botts (Fresno State). Sealey's rebuttal included that the biology of race \\"is really about a relationship between actual genetic ancestry (on the one hand), and the cultural and social signification of that ancestry (on the other)\\". The role of ancestry is therefore not biological but cultural, she argued. She argued further that \\"the white person who attempts to shed her white identity becomes blind to the racial privilege that she cannot opt out of\\". Botts did not attend the meeting but submitted a short reply, arguing that the contemporary understanding of race in the US sees it as an \\"identity marker based in ancestry\\", which unlike gender is not changeable; she called race \\"externally derived\\" and gender \\"internally derived\\".. She presented a more detailed position at a Fresno State meeting in March and at the Res Philosophica conference in April.; Uribes, Tom (9 March 2017). \\"Philosophy Professor Tina Botts kicks off Women's Studies Lunchtime Talks\\". The College of Arts and Humanities at Fresno State. Hypatia made Tuvel's article available online on 29 March 2017 and included it in their spring issue on 25 April. It was published while Botts was at the Res Philosophica conference. There was support there for both Botts' and Tuvel's positions; according to Botts, the view was expressed that Tuvel's ideas were out of step with recent scholarship, but that she might be onto something in calling for the right to reject one's designated race. Social-media response =Criticism= On 28 April 2017, Tuvel and the article came under attack on Facebook and Twitter. Tuvel was called transphobic, racist, crazy, and stupid, and was accused of having engaged in \\"epistemic violence\\".. Several feminists referred to her as a \\"Becky\\"..Brean, Joseph (3 May 2017). \\"After 'In Defense of Transracialism' sparks outrage, editors of philosophy journal castigate its Canadian author\\". The National Post. The article was called violent, crap, and \\"wack shit\\". The philosopher Kelly Oliver, who chaired Tuvel's dissertation committee in 2014, defended Tuvel on Facebook by asking for arguments rather than insults, and suggested that Hypatia invite critical responses. She was told her comments were \\"unforgivable\\" and that her suggestions were \\"doing violence\\" and triggering PTSD. According to Oliver, several people associated with Hypatia joined in the criticism and apologized individually for the article. A friend of Oliver's described one of the Facebook apologies as \\"like something ISIS makes its captors read in a hostage video before beheading them\\". Dissenters were shut down or afraid to speak up; several people who wrote sympathetically to Tuvel in private attacked her in public. Others who posted criticism acknowledged privately that they had not read the article. A \\"senior feminist philosopher\\" telephoned Tuvel to remind her that she had to appeal to the \\"right people\\" to get tenure. Oliver writes: \\"Through every medium imaginable, senior feminist scholars were pressuring, even threatening, Tuvel that she wouldn't get tenure and her career would be ruined if she didn‚Äôt retract her article.\\" Tuvel said that people were \\"absolutely vicious\\" toward her. Nora Berenstain, assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Tennessee, wrote on Facebook on 29 April that the paper contained \\"egregious levels of liberal white ignorance and discursive transmisogynistic violence\\". Criticizing Tuvel for failing to cite black women philosophers or black trans women, Berenstain objected to Tuvel's parenthetical reference to Jenner's former name (deadnaming) and her use of the terms \\"transgenderism\\", \\"biological sex\\" and \\"male genitalia\\". The paper's references to surgery, Berenstain wrote, objectified trans bodies, and its reference to \\"a male-to-female (mtf) trans individual who could return to male privilege\\" promoted \\"the harmful transmisogynistic ideology that trans women have (at some point had) male privilege\\". =Open letter= Signatories and objections An open letter requesting a retraction appeared on 29 April 2017; its point of contact was Alexis Shotwell of Hypatias editorial board. The letter had 130 signatories by 9 a.m. on 1 May, and 830 by the afternoon of 2 May.Piper, Greg (2 May 2017). \\"Sorry for comparing transgenders to Rachel Dolezal, feminist journal tells outrage mob\\". The College Fix. The top five signatories were Elise Springer (Wesleyan), Alexis Shotwell (Carleton), Dilek Huseyinzadegan (Emory), Lori Gruen (Wesleyan), and Shannon Winnubst (Ohio State). Two signatories, Gruen and Lisa Guenther (Vanderbilt), had been members of Tuvel's dissertation committee. Delivered on 2 May to Hypatias editor-in-chief, the letter urged the journal to retract the article; avoid deadnaming; open its editorial procedures to scrutiny; release a statement about improving its review process; and undertake to involve in future \\"people targeted by transphobia and racism and scholars who specialize in the related relevant subfields of philosophy\\". It alleged of the article that: Rebuttal According to the philosopher Justin Weinberg, most of the letter's claims were false or arguable. GLAAD does caution against using the term transgenderism. The deadnaming consisted of Tuvel including Jenner's previous name in parentheses, a name Jenner herself refers to, Singal wrote. Weinberg argued that it was unclear why the conversion example was deemed objectionable. Tuvel did not identify Charles Mills as a \\"defender of voluntary racial identification\\"; Weinberg wrote that this allegation was \\"just plain false\\". The criticism that Tuvel did not cite enough women of color might be a fair point, according to Singal, but hardly sufficient to demand a retraction. Weinberg wrote that Tuvel's critics had failed to point out any work that was directly relevant and had been omitted. The philosopher Justin E. H. Smith described the claim that Tuvel did not cite the relevant literature as \\"fatuous nonsense\\": \\"None of the experts within the narrow community of scholars Tuvel was faulted for ignoring had themselves cited more than the tiniest fraction of potentially relevant literature ...\\". =Associate editors' apology= On 30 April 2017‚Äîtwo days before the open letter was delivered to Hypatia‚ÄîCressida Heyes, then one of Hypatias 10 associate editors, posted a 1,000-word apology on her Facebook page from \\"We, the members of Hypatia's Board of Associate Editors\\". On 1 May it was reposted to Hypatias Facebook page, this time from \\"a majority\\" of the associate editors. The apology stated: \\"We, the members of Hypatia's Board of Associate Editors, extend our profound apology to our friends and colleagues in feminist philosophy, especially transfeminists, queer feminists, and feminists of color, for the harms that the publication of the article on transracialism has caused\\". It continued that \\"clearly, the article should not have been published\\" and blamed the review process, which had exposed Tuvel to criticism that was \\"both predictable and justifiable\\". The associate editors had been asked but declined, the letter said, to name the anonymous reviewers. Reception =Author's statement= Tuvel issued a statement on 1 May 2017 saying she had written the article \\"from a place of support for those with non-normative identities\\", because she had perceived a \\"transphobic logic that lay at the heart\\" of the attacks against Dolezal. Citing scholars who have adopted sympathetic positions on transracialism, including Adolph L. Reed Jr. and Melissa Harris-Perry, she argued that failing to examine the issues would \\"reinforce gender and racial essentialism\\". She apologized for the reference to Jenner's previous name, which was removed from the article at her request on 4 May. Regarding the personal attacks, she wrote that commentators had warned her that failing to retract the article would \\"be devastating for ... [her] personally, professionally, and morally\\". She argued that \\"critical thought is in danger\\" and that \\"the last place one expects to find such calls for censorship rather than discussion is amongst philosophers\\".McKenzie, Lindsay (1 May 2017). \\"Journal Apologizes for Article Likening Transracialism to Being Transgender\\". Chronicle of Higher Education. =Hypatia response= Sally Scholz, the editor-in-chief, called the associate editor's repudiation of the article \\"utterly inappropriate\\". Scholz was supported by Miriam Solomon, president of Hypatia Inc.'s board of directors. The journal referred the matter to the Committee on Publication Ethics. On 18 May the board issued a statement with a mixed message.Allen, Charlotte (18 May 2017). \\"Finally, a (Meek and Halfhearted) Defense of Rebecca Tuvel from Hypatia\\". The Weekly Standard. Signed by Elizabeth Anderson, Leslie Francis, Heidi Grasswick, Miriam Solomon, and Lisa Tessman, it dismissed the view that objections to the article were too minor to have triggered such a response; that view reflects \\"ignorance of the cumulative history of marginalization ... of oppressed groups\\".McKenzie, Lindsay (18 May 2017). \\"Journal's Board Disavows Apology for 'Transracialism' Article, Making Retraction Unlikely\\", The Chronicle of Higher Education. Condemning the personal attacks on Tuvel, the directors said they stood behind the editor-in-chief, that the associate editors had apologized without adequate consultation, and that the article would not be retracted. The associate editors' apology on Hypatias Facebook page was updated to say that it did not represent the views of the editor or board of directors. =Academic response= The academic community came out in support of Tuvel, particularly on two popular philosophy blogs, Justin Weinberg's Daily Nous and Brian Leiter's Leiter Reports.Leiter, Brian (1 May 2017). \\"The defamation of Rebecca Tuvel by the Board of Associate Editors of Hypatia and the authors of the Open Letter\\". Leiter Reports. Leiter wrote that he had \\"never seen anything like this in academic philosophy\\". Mark Newman, chair of the Rhodes College philosophy department where Tuvel teaches, expressed the department's \\"complete and unconditional support\\" for her. Paul Bloom called the episode \\"a bizarre and ugly attack\\". The associate editors' letter had twisted the concept of harm \\"beyond all recognition\\", according to the philosopher Jos√© Luis Berm√∫dez.Berm√∫dez, Jos√© Luis (5 May 2017). \\"Defining 'Harm' in the Tuvel Affair\\". Inside Higher Ed. Commentators blamed social media's call-out culture for the speed with which the dispute unfolded. In the view of Suzanna Danuta Walters, editor-in-chief of the feminist journal Signs, the associate editors had undermined \\"the whole process of peer review and the principles of scholarly debate\\". The philosopher Dan Kaufman blamed the profession's \\"increasing obsession with identity politics\\" and \\"purity-purges\\".Sosis, Cliff (25 January 2018). \\"Interview with Dan Kaufman\\". What Is It Like to Be a Philosopher?. Rogers Brubaker, author of Trans: Gender and Race in an Age of Unsettled Identities (2016), described as \\"epistemological insiderism\\" the idea that as a white cisgender woman Tuvel had no standing to argue about transgender or transracial issues. There had been tension for some time between Hypatia and women-of-color philosophers, who believed the journal did not take their work seriously, according to Tina Fernandes Botts. Botts was critical of the Hypatia peer-review process, which she said had allowed the paper to be published without ensuring that it was \\"situated within contemporary scholarly discussions\\". Sally Haslanger Sally Haslanger, later co-chair of Hypatia governance task force, complained about poor working conditions and the narrow focus of philosophy journals; she wrote that there are days she can \\"hardly stand the arrogance, the ignorance, the complacency, in short, the bullshit, of the profession\\". The situation was not Tuvel's fault; she had been unfairly targeted, in Haslanger's view. Of 13,000 professional philosophers in the United States in 2013, she wrote, only 55 were black women and 30 percent of those were PhD students.Haslanger, Sally (4 May 2017). \\"Focus On The Fire, Not The Spark\\". Daily Nous. Citing sexual- harassment complaints and figures showing that, in 2016, 75 percent of APA members identified as male and 80 percent white, Shannon Winnubst, editor of PhiloSOPHIA and one of the open letter's top signatories, wrote that the publication of Tuvel's article had brought \\"all of the systemic problems\\" of philosophy and feminist philosophy to a head.Winnubst, Shannon (8 May 2017). \\"Why Tuvel‚Äôs Article So Troubled Its Critics\\". The Chronicle of Higher Education. Oliver Traldi argued in Quillette that the dispute was partly attributable to the influence of continental as opposed to analytic philosophy, and the idea that philosophy should be a vehicle for social change, rather than an impartial search for truth.Traldi, Oliver (9 May 2017). \\"A Line in the Sand for Academic Philosophy\\". Quillette. Philosophy Today published a symposium on Tuvel's article in its Winter 2018 edition, with contributions from Chlo√´ Taylor (Alberta), Lewis Gordon (UConn), Kris Sealey (Fairfield), Sabrina Hom (GCSU), Tina Fernandes Botts (Fresno State), and Tuvel.\\"Special symposium: Rebecca Tuvel and her interlocutors\\". Philosophy Today. 62(1), Winter 2018. Tuvel's contribution includes responses to Sealey's and Botts' critiques. =Hypatia resignations= The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) reported in July 2017 that the associate editors' apology had been inappropriate, and that, when responding to an external complaint about a journal article, an internal inquiry should be held prior to a public response. The associate editors apparently refused to accept the report's conclusions. On 20 July Hypatia announced the resignation of Sally Scholz, the editor-in-chief, and Shelley Wilcox, editor of Hypatia Reviews Online. They also announced that a task force would restructure the journal's governance, and that anyone holding an editorial or non-board position with Hypatia would be \\"required to sign a statement of adherence\\" to COPE guidelines. According to a statement from the associate editors, the board asked them, on 17 July, to resign or it would suspend the journal's governance documents, thereby removing the associate editors' authority to choose the next editor. Eight of the associate editors resigned. In a resignation letter, they argued that feminist philosophy had an ethical commitment to transform philosophy into \\"a discipline that honors the perspectives and welcomes the scholarly contributions of historically marginalized groups, including people of color, trans* people, disabled people, and queer people\\". Sally Haslanger, Serene Khader, and Yannik Thiem were appointed as co-chairs of the governance task force and Ann Garry, Serene Khader, and Alison Stone as interim editors. In February 2018 the five-person board of directors was replaced. Linda Mart√≠n Alcoff and Kim Hall, two of the associate editors who resigned in July, became, respectively, president of the board of directors and chair of the search committee for the new editorial team. As of March 2020, the journal was led by four co-editors, Bonnie J. Mann, Erin McKenna, Camisha Russell, and Roc√≠o Zambrana, and published by Cambridge University Press.

Early life and family Sultana Petrova was born Sultana Pantaleeva Minchovich in the Ottoman city of Tulcea, on 15 July 1869, the daughter of Dr. Pantaley Minchovich. Petrova's father studied in Paris, was employed by the Turkish navy and later became a politician. Her mother died when she was 27, leaving her father to raise three children. She was educated in the Royal College of French in Bucharest, capital of the Romanian Old Kingdom. As a young woman, Petrova was noticed by Queen Carmen Sylva who wished to help her to go to Paris to become an opera singer. Her father objects to this, and when Petrova is 16, the family move to Sofia. At age 24, she met Racho Petrov whom she marries in 1887. They had three children, Maria, Vlada and Blagoi. They eventually divorce in 1919. Memoirs and legacy The marriage was an unhappy one, compounded by an alleged affair which Petrova had with Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria. She was close to the prince, and was privy to much of the personal affairs and meetings of the prince and Prime Minister Stefan Stambolov. She published her memoirs in 1922 entitled From My Memories, with a second volume being published posthumously. It is her involvement in the Bulgarian government which has led to her memoirs being an important primary source for the time. During World War II, Petrova was sent to a concentration camp St. Kirik due to her condemnation of Bulgaria's support of Nazi Germany. It is also believed that Petrova was the first woman in Bulgaria to undergo plastic surgery. She died in Sofia on 26 November 1946.

Recognition of fictional characters as works eligible for copyright protection has come about with the understanding that characters can be separated from the original works they were embodied in and acquire a new life by featuring in subsequent works.Paul Goldstein, Copyright: Principles, Law And Practice (OUP 1989)158.  United States  In the United States, in order to avail of copyright protection, a work must be original that is, it must involve an element of creativity,Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Services Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361 (1991). and must be fixed in a tangible medium.17 U.S.C. ¬ß 102. Further, there can be no copyright in mere ideas and facts, but only in the unique expression of the same.Mannion v. Coors Brewing Co., 377 F.Supp.2d 444 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). US Copyright Statute of 1976 does not explicitly mention fictional characters as subject matter of copyright, and their copyrightability is a product of common law. Historically, the Courts granted copyright protection to characters as parts of larger protected work and not as independent creations. They were regarded as ‚Äòcomponents in a copyrighted works‚Äô and eligible for protection as thus.Walt Disney Prods. v. Air Pirates, 581 F.2d 751, 754 (9th Cir. 1978). Recognition of characters as independent works distinct to the plot in which they were embodied came about only in 1930 in the case of Nichols v. Universal Pictures.45 F.2d 119, 121, 7 USPQ 84 (2d Cir. 1930). Following Nichols, the American judiciary has evolved two main tests to determine whether a character in a work can be eligible for copyright protection. = Well-delineated test = In Nichols, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied protection to the plaintiff's characters on the grounds that they were not ‚Äúdistinctly delineated‚Äù, but poorly developed. The plaintiff's characters of the Jewish gentleman and the poor Irish catholic girl he loved were regarded to be no more than mere ‚Äòprototypes‚Äô. Judge Hand held that the less developed the character, the less the copyrightability of the same. Copyright protection shall therefore be enjoyed by a character provided it is well delineated. By applying this test, copyright protection was held to subsist in the character of Tarzan because it was found to be ‚Äúsufficiently delineated.‚Äù Burroughs v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 683 F.2d 610 (2d Cir. 1982). Similarly, the character of Superman was held to found to be well delineated by virtue of embodying original literary expressions and incidents, and therefore deserving of copyright.Detective Comics, Inc. v. Burns Publications, 111 F.2d 432; 434 (2d Cir. 1940) Under this approach, a three-step test is required to be followed. Firstly, the character must possess physical and conceptual attributes. Secondly, the character must be ‚Äúsufficiently delineated‚Äù to be identified as the same character across multiple occasions. He must therefore show consistent traits. Lastly, the character must be ‚Äúespecially distinctive‚Äù and ‚Äúcontain some unique elements of expression.Halicki Films, LLC v. Sanderson Sales & Mktg., 547 F.3d 1213, 1224 (9th Cir.2008). The consistency of a character's traits and attributes is considered as the key factor for whether the character qualifies for copyright protection.DC Comics v. Towle, 989 F. Supp. 2d 948 (C.D. Cal. 2013). = Story being told test = The second approach was propounded by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Warner Bros. v. Columbia Broadcast Systems. 216 F.2d 945, 950 (9th Cir. 1954). The Ninth Circuit court ruled that a character can avail of copyright protection only if it ‚Äúconstitutes the story being told‚Äù. In this case, the character in question, Sam Spade of the Maltese Falcon detective novel, was held to be a ‚Äúmere vehicle‚Äù for carrying the story forward. Accordingly, copyright protection did not prevail. The holding in Warner Bros. case came to be known as the Sam Spade Test, this approach does not allow for copyright protection if the character is a ‚Äúmere chessman in the game of storytelling.‚Äù On the other hand, if the character is central to the story, then it will be copyrightable. In the case of Universal City Studios v. Kamar Industries217 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 1162 (S.D. Tex. 1982). this test was applied to hold that E.T was a distinctive character around whom the story in the movie E.T the Extra Terrestrial revolved. Therefore, the copyright in E.T was held to be enjoyed by Universal Studios, and the defendants were held liable for a violation of the Studios‚Äô copyright by the manufacturing and sale of goods under the title ‚ÄòE.T Home Phones‚Äô. The American judiciary has followed both these tests. There have also been a number of instances where the Court has used both the tests in its analysis. For instance, in Anderson v Stallone,11 USPQ2D 1161 (C.D. Cal. 1989). it was held that the character Rocky played by movie star Sylvester Stallone in the eponymous movie franchise had come to be identified with certain physical traits and mannerisms that qualified as a well delineated character. Further, this ‚Äòhighly developed‚Äô character was held to constitute the story being told. Similarly, the character of James Bond was awarded copyright protection on the grounds of being both sufficiently delineated as well as central to the story being told.Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer v. American Honda, 900 F. Supp. 1287 (C.D. Cal. 1995). The fact that the character had been played by multiple actors was not held to be relevant since the characteristics associated with Bond had remain consistent across sixteen films. = Visual and literary characters = Copyright protection is available to both characters that have been solely described in writing, as well as characters depicted in a visual or graphic form.Amanda Schreyer, 'An Overview Of Legal Protection For Fictional Characters', 6 CYBARIS IP L. Rev. Vol. 51 (2015) available at http://open.mitchellhamline.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1043&context;=cybaris What is required is that the character in question possesses original or a set of distinctive traits, and visual representation is not an essential. For example, simple representation of anthropomorphic versions of human emotions by color is not sufficient for copyright without unique characterization traits. If the literary character is not depicted in a visual form, and has only been described in writing in a few lines, then the character cannot enjoy copyright.Olson v. Nat‚Äôl Broad. Co., 855 F. 2d 1446, 1452‚Äì53 (9th Cir. 1988). On the other hand, where the characters, like Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are found to be distinctive enough, they are held to be subject matter of copyright, even if they are merely in written form.Klinger v. Conan Doyle Estate Ltd., 755 F.3d 496, 503 (7th Cir. 2014). Copyright protection may be granted to comic characters where the physical and conceptual characteristics find unique expression in graphic form.Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates, F.2d 751 (9th Cir. 1978). = Components of character‚Äôs identity = Copyright protection may also be afforded to the individual components of a character's identity. For instance, copyrightability was granted to the glove worn by the protagonist in the movie A Nightmare on Elm Street on the grounds that it helped identify the character, and therefore enjoyed a distinct protection separate from the character.New Line Cinema v. Russ Berrie, 161 F. Supp. 2d 293, 302 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). Similarly, the superhero Batman‚Äôs car the Batmobile was held to be protectable by copyright on account of the fact that firstly it had a set of distinctive traits, and secondly these traits could be separated from the utilitarian functions of the car and be represented in pictorial, sculptural and graphic form.DC Comics Supra 10. = Stock characters = The scenes a faire doctrine holds that those scenes or aspects that are indispensable to the story or are standard expressions cannot be copyrighted.Alexander v. Haley, 460 F.Supp 40 (S.D.N.Y. 1978). This limitation also applies to fictional characters.Gaiman v. McFarlane, 360 F.3d 644, 659 (7th Cir. 2004). Therefore, stock characters or archetypical and hackneyed elements are disqualified from protection by virtue of the fact that they are not unique in their expression.Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin Co., 268 F.3d 1257 (11th Cir. 2001). = Infringement = In cases of copyright infringement of a fictional character, a two-step test developed by the American Courts has to be satisfied.Kenneth E. Spahn, 'The Legal Protection of Fictional Characters', 9 U. MIAMI ENT. & SPORTS L. REV. 331 (1992) available at: http://repository.law.miami.edu/umeslr/vol9/iss2/6. Firstly, it must be established that the character in question is capable of being copyrighted. Secondly, it must be demonstrated that there has been an infringement of this unique expression.Zambito v. Paramount Pictures, 613 F.Supp. 1107, 1111-12 (E.D.N.Y. 1985), aff'd, 788 F.2d 2 (2d Cir. 1985). The delineation test and the story being told tests as explained above are used to determine the copyrightability of the character, and the Court must check whether the same is precluded from being afforded protection by virtue of applicability of the scenes a faire doctrine. Following this, the actual infringement is to be decided by comparing the original and allegedly infringing work for ‚Äúsubstantial similarities‚Äù in appearance, as well as in personality traits.United Artists v. Ford Motor Co., 483 F. Supp. 89, 91 (S.D.N.Y. 1977). = Other sources of protection = Protection of fictional characters may also be derived from certain alternative sources in American law. Trademark Law: Trademark rights may be enjoyed in a fictional character and can be enforced as such. To determine the infringement of the trademark it must be shown that the fictional character has acquired a ‚Äúsecondary meaning‚Äù, and that there is a likelihood of confusion to be caused to the public by the defendant's mark which is deceptively similar to the original.Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.., 746 F.2d 112, 115 (2d Cir. 1984). Characters such as Mickey Mouse have been held to have acquired such a secondary meaning and protected under trademark law.Walt Disney Supra 18 Right to Publicity: This right traces its origins in the tort of privacy and is the right to prevent others from commercially exploiting one's name and likeness. The portrayal of the Marx brothers as characters in a play was held to be an infringement of their right to publicity.Groucho Marx Prods. v. Day and Night Co., 523 F.Supp. 485, 492-3 (S.D.N.Y.), rev'd on other grounds, 689 F.2d 278, 287 (2d Cir. 1981). Dilution: Yet another remedy with its roots in trademark law is that of dilution. Under the doctrine of dilution, the plaintiff can seek relief for whittling away of the value of character. This doctrine has been applied for protection of fictional characters including that of Superman. In DC Comics v. Unlimited Monkey Business,598 F.Supp. 110 (N.D. Ga. 1984). the defendants‚Äô costumes were found to present a likelihood of dilution of the plaintiff's trademark in the Superman character. Misappropriation: In order to argue for misappropriation of fictional characters, the plaintiff must demonstrate that firstly, there has been an investment of substantial amount of time and effort by him, secondly, the defendant has appropriated the product of such investment, and thirdly, such appropriation has caused loss to the plaintiff.Spahn Supra 24 The action of taking the plaintiff's news bulletins and selling to its competitors was held to be a case of misappropriation.International News Service v. Associated Press, 248 U.S. 215 (1918).  India  Section 13 of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957 allows for copyright in original literary, artistic, musical and dramatic works, as well as in sound recordings and cinematography films. The statute does not recognise fictional characters as subject matter of copyright, and protection for the same is derived from judge-made law. The first instance where this issue was brought into light was in the case of Malayala Manorama v VT Thomas.AIR 1989 Ker 49. The Kerala High Court held that the defendant owned the copyright in his cartoon characters that he had created before entering into the plaintiff's employment. Subsequently, the Delhi High Court in Raja Pocket Books v Radha Pocket Books1997 (40) DRJ 791. found that the plaintiff's copyright in his comic character the herpetologist ‚ÄòNagraj‚Äô had been infringed by the defendant's character ‚ÄòNagesh‚Äô based on the semantic and phonetic similarities in their respective characters‚Äô names, as well as in their visual representations and conceptual characteristics. However, the Court in VT Thomas did not discuss independent copyright in characters as this case was concerned with the issue of ownership of copyright.Shan Kohli, 'Can Literary Characters Be Copyrighted?: Criticism Of The ‚ÄúStory Being Told‚Äù Test And The Indian Status ‚ÄìII' SPICY IP (April 14, 2016) available at https://spicyip.com/2016/04/can-literary-characters-be- copyrighted-a-reformulation-of-the-especially-distinctive-test-ii.html. Further, the comparative analysis in Raja Pocket Books to arrive at a conclusion of infringement was undertaken by the Court without firstly stating that copyright subsisted in the plaintiff's character.Id. Therefore, in India, it can be implied that copyright protection is available to fictional characters, but the judiciary is yet to lay down any criteria for availing this protection.Inika Charles, 'Copyright-ing Fictional Characters: Bombay HC Permits Release of ‚ÄòRangoon‚Äô'SPICY IP (March 6, 2017) https://spicyip.com/2017/03/copyright-ing-fictional-characters-bombay-hc- permits-release-of-rangoon.html. = Alternate protection = In India, recourse can be had to trademark law which recognises that fictional characters enjoy goodwill, and provides relief for cases of ‚Äòcharacter merchandising‚Äô. Character merchandising has been defined as involving the exploitation of fictional characters by licensing these fictional characters in the case of Star India Private Limited vs Leo Burnett (India) Private Ltd.2003 (2) BomCR 655. A prerequisite for character merchandising is that the character to be merchandised must have gained some public recognition, independently of the original product in which it appears. In this case, the characters in the plaintiff's were found not have acquired an independent recognition as a commodity, and therefore the suit for character merchandising by the defendants failed.

The matrix was first isolated in 1994 as an amorphous collection of 12 proteins that remained associated together in the presence of detergent (which removed Golgi membranes) and 150 mM NaCl (which removed weakly associated proteins). Treatment with a protease enzyme removed the matrix, which confirmed the importance of proteins for the matrix structure. Modern freeze etch electron microscopy (EM) clearly shows a mesh connecting Golgi cisternae and associated vesicles. Further support for the existence of a matrix comes from EM images showing that ribosomes are excluded from regions between and near Golgi cisternae.Fig. 14 in GMAP210 has functional regions at both ends. The ALPS of GMAP210 binds to curved, but not flat, lipid layers Structure and function GRASP domain alignment of GRASP55 and the GRASP homologue of Cryptococcus neoformans Microinjection of antibodies to GRASP65 prevents normal Golgi stack formation. The first individual protein component of the matrix was identified in 1995 as Golgin A2 (then called GM130). Since then, many other golgin family proteins have been found to be in the Golgi matrix and are associated with the Golgi membranes in a variety of ways. For example, GMAP210 (Golgi Microtubule Associated Protein 210) has an ALPS (Amphipathic Lipid-Packing Sensor) motif in the N-termal 38 amino acids and an ARF1-binding domain called GRAB (Grip-Related Arf-Binding) at the C-terminus. Thus, the GRAB-domain can bind indirectly to Golgi cisternae and its ALPS motif can tether vesicles. Golgins have coiled-coil domains and are thus predicted to have elongated structures up to 200 nm in length. Most are peripheral membrane proteins attached at one end to Golgi membranes. They have flexible regions between the coiled-coil domains, which make them ideal candidates for mediating the dynamic vesicle docking to Golgi cisternae and dynamic structure of the Golgi itself. Golgi reassembly-stacking proteins are an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins in the Golgi matrix. GRASP65 and GRASP55 are the 2 human GRASPs. These proteins were named from their requirement for accurate Golgi reassembly during an in vitro assay, but they have also been shown to function in vivo, as shown in the accompanying figure. GRASPs associate with lipid bilayers because they are myristoylated and their myristic acid residue intercalates into the lipid layer. Their trans oligomerization is controlled by phosphorylation and is thought to explain the fragmentation of the Golgi as required during mitosis.

She was also known as Mahalda, Mahault, Mafalda and Matilda. She was the wife of Ram√≥n Berenguer II, and thus Countess of Barcelona (1078‚Äì1082). After her husband‚Äôs death, she remarried Aimery I, the Viscount of Narbonne (1086‚Äì1108). Lineage Maud was the first daughter of Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia and Calabria, (ca.1020 - 1085) with his second wife Sikelgaita. Her brother was Roger Borsa, the effective ruler of southern Italy from 1085 until his death. Her first cousins were Simon of Sicily and Roger II (sons of Roger) who led the effort to consolidate southern Italy and Sicily under Norman (D‚ÄôHauteville) rule, which was accomplished in 1130. She was also a half sister of Bohemund of Taranto, who was one of the leaders of the First Crusade and became Prince of Antioch. Countess of Barcelona The wedding of Ramon Berenguer II with Maud took place at the beginning of 1078. The marriage could have been the result of the policy of Pope Gregory VII, who sought support among the Norman nobility of southern Italy against Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor.

A few days before, Maud had given birth to a son, the future Ram√≥n Berenguer III. The death of her husband left Maud and her son in a precarious situation, since the infant could not inherit the county until after the death of his uncle.

Whereas the kNN classifier supports binary classification, multiclass classification and regression, the Structured kNN (SkNN) allows training of a classifier for general structured output labels. As an example, a sample instance might be a natural language sentence, and the output label is an annotated parse tree. Training a classifier consists of showing pairs of correct sample and output label pairs. After training, the structured kNN model allows one to predict for new sample instances the corresponding output label; that is, given a natural language sentence, the classifier can produce the most likely parse tree. Training As a training set SkNN accepts sequences of elements with defined class labels. Type of elements does not matter, the only condition is the existence of metric function that defines a distance between each pair of elements of a set. SkNN is based on idea of creating a graph, each node of which represents class label. There is an edge between a pair of nodes iff there is a sequence of two elements in training set with corresponding classes. Thereby the first step of SkNN training is the construction of described graph from training sequences. There are two special nodes in the graph corresponding to an end and a beginning of sentences. If sequence starts with class \`C\`, the edge between node \`START\` and node \`C\` should be created. Like a regular kNN, the second part of the training of SkNN consists only of storing the elements of trained sequence in special way. Each element of training sequences is stored in node related to the class of previous element in sequence. Every first element is stored in node \`START\`. Inference Labelling of input sequences in SkNN consists in finding sequence of transitions in graph, starting from node \`START\`, which minimises overall cost of path. Each transition corresponds to a single element of input sequence and vice versa. As a result, label of element is determined as target node label of the transition. Cost of the path is defined as sum of all its transitions, and the cost of transition from node \`A\` to node \`B\` is a distance from current input sequence element to the nearest element of class \`B\`, stored in node \`A\`. Searching of optimal path may be performed using modified Viterbi algorithm. Unlike the original one, the modified algorithm instead of maximizing the product of probabilities minimizes the sum of the distances.

Production Cuthbertson & Cassian designed the boat for Hinterhoeller Yachts, who put it into production in 1967 in Canada as the Redwing 30. When C&C; Yachts bought out Hinterhoeller in 1972 the boat was still in production and was then sold as the C&C; Redwing 30. Production ended later in 1972, in favour of more modern designs, with only about 145-150 examples completed Design The Redwing 30 is a small recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a masthead sloop rig, a raked stem, a raised transom, an internally-mounted, scimitar-shaped, spade-type rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed swept fin keel. It displaces and carries of ballast. The scimitar shaped rudder design was dictated by the proximity of the propeller shaft and the need to reduce rudder pressure. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel fitted. The boat is fitted with a Universal Atomic 4 gasoline engine. The design has a hull speed of . Operational history In a 2000 used boat review, writer Karen Larson noted the boat's aesthetics and also wrote: \\"The Redwing isn't like the rest of the Canadian-built C&Cs; that came a bit later and are so common on the Great Lakes ... Only 145 to 150 Redwings were built by Hinterhoeller between 1967 and 1972, before they cast those plans aside in favor of the C&C; 30, of which more than 800 were produced between 1973 and 1985 ... Since the Redwing came relatively early in the history of production fiberglass boats, Cuthbertson and Cassian were clearly influenced by the designs of Carl Alberg. The Redwing has the recognizable wooden cockpit coamings and the pedestal- mounted winches. She has that beautiful upswept stern and a narrow beam. At 21 feet 9 inches her waterline is much shorter than her 30 feet on deck would lead you to believe. And space below is tight, as can be expected of all boats with the Alberg look.\\" Redwing 30 Redwing 30 Redwing 30 Reviewer Ted Brewer wrote in 2000: \\"the Redwing was still very much state-of-the-art when she was designed ... The yacht was able to compete with CCA cruiser/racers of her size and larger and still win more than her share of silver ... she simply gobbled up competitors that rated a foot or so higher under the CCA rule. That is due, in part, to the unusually high ballast/displacement ratio, which keeps her standing up to the breeze despite her modest beam and her generous (by CCA standards) sail area ... In light weather she would still shine, as her short waterline, modest beam, and relatively slack-bilge hull help to reduce wetted surface, the major cause of resistance when the winds soften. Redwing's spade rudder and shark-style fin were also state-of-the-art for the late '60s. Her all-lead outside ballast gave her an edge over many competing yachts ... I don't consider the Redwing 30 to be a true bluewater yacht, due to her lack of a bridge deck and her deck-stepped mast, although I'm sure that many of them have made extensive offshore voyages ... By any standards, she is a classic.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Alberg 30 *Alberg Odyssey 30 *Annie 30 *Aloha 30 *Bahama 30 *Bristol 29.9 *C&C; 1/2 Ton *C&C; 30 *C&C; Mega 30 One Design *Catalina 30 *Catalina 309 *CS 30 *Grampian 30 *Hunter 30 *Hunter 30T *Hunter 30-2 *Hunter 306 *J/30 *Kirby 30 *Leigh 30 *Mirage 30 *Mirage 30 SX *Nonsuch 30 *Pearson 303 *S2 9.2 *Southern Cross 28 *Tanzer 31 References External links * Category:Keelboats Category:1960s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ","title":"C&amp;C 30 Redwing"},{"id":"53985986","text":"Del Rey is an American instrumental post-rock band from Chicago.Review of Speak it Not Aloud.

Davison, (September 22, 1868 ‚Äì May 26, 1913) was a part Native Hawaiian female educator, philanthropist and governmental social worker. She served as assistant secretary of the Board of Education of the Territory of Hawaii and represented Hawaii in the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. Early life and education Rosalie Compton Kahipuleokalaniahumanu Davison was born on September 22, 1868, in Honolulu, Kingdom of Hawaii, to American pharmacist Benoni Richmond Davison and British-Hawaiian chiefess Mary Jane Kekulani Fayerweather, the granddaughter of the British Captain George Charles Beckley and Ahia, a distant relation of the reigning House of Kamehameha and descendant of the 15th-century King Lƒ´loa. Her siblings included William Compton Malulani, Emma Ahuena, Henry Fayerweather, and Marie Hope Kekulani. Her father died in 1875 and her mother later remarried to photographer A. A. Montano in 1877.; She was initially educated at St. Andrew's Priory School and Fort Street School and later graduated from Oahu College (the modern-day Punahou School). After finishing school, Davison worked as a schoolteacher and became the first English language instructor at the government school in the MƒÅnoa Valley in 1889. She later worked as a governmental school agent and was appointed as assistant secretary of the Territory of Hawaii Board of Education under the leadership of Alatau T. Atkinson. During the 1900 United States Census, she assisted Atkinson who was serving as census superintendent. Career In 1901, Davison was appointed by the Department of Public Instruction to head a delegation of Hawaiian educators who attended the Pan- American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. She was charged with assembling an educational exhibit showcasing the products of the students of the islands including school assignments, industrial products and sewing. The intents of the exhibit was to \\"surprise the American population which yet believes that Hawaii is a land of cannibals\\". Davison and her retinue of part-Hawaiian ladies, including Mapuana Smith and Miss Ordway, became representatives of \\"Kanaka civility\\" in contrast to the hula dancing troupes which have been the main Hawaiian attractions in past international exhibitions. pƒÅ ª≈´ riders Davison was actively involved in philanthropy and the betterment of ill- treated children and animals. Especially devoted to the welfare of dogs and horses from her youth, she was considered \\"one of the finest horsewoman in the Islands\\" and helped to arrange pƒÅ ª≈´ riders in floral parades. She became involved with the Hawaii Humane Society and received a police commission and appointment in 1909 as humane officer by Sheriff Curtis P. Iaukea. Her duties included inspecting the barns and stables of the islands to ensure compliance with the humane society. She also worked to protect children, especially young girls, taking them from abusive families and placing them in foster care or into industrial schools. She would personally go to the lowly parts of town at night to save the children in these areas. It was noted, \\"Hardly a school child in the country, whether white or brown but knew Miss Davison and the boys always took off their hats to her as she passed them.\\" Illness and death Rose C. Davison Davison retired from her position as special officer with the Hawaii Humane Society in 1912 due to her illness. A trip to California with her sister Emma did little to improve her health and she returned to Honolulu a few weeks before her death. Two weeks before her death, she was strong enough to visit and inspect stables and barns on Oahu. She fell into a coma and died at her home in the MƒÅnoa Valley, on May 26, 1913.; ; Following a funeral at the Central Union Church, her cremated remains were buried directly over her father's grave at Oahu Cemetery.; Her obituary in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin noted: > Few women will be mourned as she is mourned by this community. Rich and > poor, high and low, great and small,‚Äîher friends were legion. She was a > splendid type of woman, an honor to her Hawaiian-American blood, an honor to > woman-kind. Her work as a humane officer was effective, quiet, broad, > earnest. Her personality was a rare combination of the alertly vigorous and > the womanly sympathetic.

It is situated on top of the Vraƒçar hill, in the municipality of Savski Venac and was the former location of the Belgrade Observatory from 1891 to 1929. Location View at the old observatory View at the Pasterova street The park is located in the northeast section of the municipality, pm the border with the Vraƒç–∞r municipality. It is bounded by the streets of Tir≈°ova to the north, Pasterova to the south, Bulevar osloboƒëenja to the east and the building of the University Children's Clinic Tir≈°ova to the west. The park is situated right across the northernmost tip of the Karaƒëorƒëev Park, across the Bulevar osloboƒëenja to the east. History New building of the Belgrade Observatory, as previously a rented private house was used, was built and opened on 1 May 1891 on the location of modern park. The site atop of Vraƒçar hill was specifically chosen due to its elevation. The building was specifically constructed for that purpose. It was constructed according to the design of architect Dimitrije T. Leko and equipped with the modern small instruments for astronomical and meteorological observations. Two small astronomical pavilions were also built. The Observatory was a workshop for practical training for the students of the Grand School and People's Observatory, but was opened for the citizens, too ‚Äì for example, in 1910 the Halley's comet was observed. Apart from its importance for astronomy and meteorology, the newly built Observatory was a cradle of the seismic and geomagnetic researches in Serbia as the observatory was equipped with a seismograph.ƒêorƒëe Stanojeviƒá in works of Jules JanssenThey built Serbia ‚Äì ƒêorƒëe Stanojeviƒá In 1924, by ruling of the Faculty Council the Observatory was divided into two separate institutions: Astronomical Observatory and Meteorological Observatory of Belgrade University. In 1929 funds were granted for the constructions of a new, modern, observatory, at distance southeast from the city's centre, at the high hill on Veliki Vraƒçar, while the old building remained a meteorological observatory.Astronomical Observatory by Sasa Mihajlov As original Serbian word for an observatory was zvezdara, old building became known as the \\"Stara Zvezdara\\" (Old Zvezdara) while the new observatory was simply called \\"Zvezdara\\", giving its name to the Veliki Vraƒçar hill, the surrounding forest, the neighborhood which developed later and the modern municipality of Zvezdara. Around the building, a park was planted in the 1950s, retaining the name of Stara Zvezdara. In 2010 the name of the park was changed to the Park Milutin Milankoviƒá, after a worldwide renown scientist Milutin Milankoviƒá who worked for decades in the observatory. The building is today the seat of the Center for the Climate Changes \\"Milutin Milankoviƒá\\". Park was renovated and re-opened under the new name on 28 December 2010. Characteristics The park is located at the entry point into the complex of the Clinical Center of Serbia, so many medical institutions are in the park's vicinity. The closest ones, apart from the University Children's Clinic, are: Oncology and Radiology Institute, Neurology Institute, Occupational Health Institute, Microbiology Institute, Pathology Institute and \\"Milan Jovanoviƒá Batut\\" Institute for Public Health, all located south and southwest from the park. To the west, the Church of Saint Sava and the National Library of Serbia are situated. In 2011 city decided to erect the monument to Milankoviƒá in the park. On 26 June 2017 the monument, work of Zoran Ivanoviƒá, was dedicated. The pedestal is encased in marble and tall, while the statue itself is cast in bronze and tall.

In the case of joint authorship, the authors share the copyright in the work with each other.  International conventions  Article 7bis of the Berne Convention states the term of protection for works of joint authorship and extends the general terms of protection provided under Article 7 to works of joint authorship, under the condition that the term of copyright protection must be measured from the death of the last surviving author. But the Berne Convention doesn‚Äôt define what works of joint authorship are, because various national legislations have a lot of variations while defining the same, and have a different approach to the topic. This problem relating to joint authorship is not specifically dealt with by other international agreements as well, like the UCC, TRIPS, and the WIPO Copyright Treaty 1996.  Law in the United States  A joint work is defined in Section 101 of the U.S. Copyright Act as \\"a work prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole\\". Section 201(a) gives the status of co-ownership in the copyrighted work to such authors of a joint work. = Elements = Under the US copyright law, a person has to prove the following two things for claiming joint authorship in a work: # First, he must show that he made a copyrightable contribution to the final work at issue. # Second, he must show that all of these contributors intended that their various contributions be merged into a unitary whole.  Copyrightable contribution  The individual contributions made by authors to a joint work need not necessarily be equal in quality or quantity. Nevertheless, the author has to show that his contribution to the joint work is copyrightable by itself. A contribution of mere ideas is not sufficient. In order to be a joint author, one must contribute expression. For the expression to be copyrightable it has to be original ‚Äì that is independently created and possess at least a minimal degree of creativity. However, in Gaiman v. McFarlane, where the issue of joint authorship was on the creation of new characters for an existing comic series, the court held that there will be joint-authorship even though the author's contribution was not independently copyrightable. The reasoning given behind this was that if more than one person laboured to create a single copyrightable work, then it would be paradoxical if no one was able to claim copyright because the individual contributions were not themselves copyrightable. While in this case, recent decisions holding that individual contribution must be independently copyrightable were not explicitly overruled, they were distinguished on facts. It was also observed that the lower standard for joint authorship only applies to mixed media works.  Intention to be merged into a unitary whole  The core of joint authorship is joint labouring by two or more persons in order to complete a pre-concerted common design. In the absence of a pre-concerted common design, the completed work will not be regarded as a joint work. However, it is not required of the several authors that they must necessarily work in physical propinquity or in concert. In Edward B. Marks Music Corp. v. Jerry Vogel Music Co, the court held that while producing a musical composition jointly, two men will be coauthors and owners of the copyright even if they labour at different times, without consulting each other, and remain strangers to each other. It is a work of joint authorship if a person creates lyrics or music with the intention that his work shall be combined with the work of another person who shall create the music or write the lyrics, as the case may be, so as to make the composition complete. The touchstone here is the intention, at the time the writing is done, that the parts be absorbed or combined into an integrated unit, although the parts themselves may be either \\"inseparable\\" (as the case of a novel or painting) or \\"interdependent\\" (as in the case of a motion picture, opera, or the words and music of a song). Hence, joint authors must have the intention of combining their respective works at the time of creating the work, and not at some later date. However, they are not required to have an express collaboration agreement creating a joint-author relationship. There have also been situations wherein the parties shared a pre-concerted intent that their works be merged into one, and yet the court did not grant joint authorship. This was since all the participants in a work did not consider themselves or others to be joint authors. = Relevant cases =  Childress v. Taylor  In Childress v. Taylor, actress Clarice Taylor asked playwright Alice Childress to write a play about legendary comedienne Jackie \\"Moms\\" Mabley. While writing, Childress accepted Taylor's assistance. Taylor mainly contributed ideas regarding the portrayal of characters in the play and also provided research on the life of \\"Moms\\" Mabley. On finalization of the draft, Childress rejected that it was owned equally by her and Taylor and registered the same in her name. Later, Taylor took a copy of the play and produced it at another theatre without Childress' permission. As a response to a suit for infringement by Childress, Taylor claimed that she was a joint author of the script and hence had equal rights in it. The Court while determining this issue, looked at whether the both the participants intended to combine their works into a unitary whole. Additionally, the court checked whether the parties intended to be joint authors in the work. The court held that Taylor was not a joint author of the script due to lack of contribution of sufficient expression. It observed that no evidence was shown to establish Taylor's role as anything more than giving advice and ideas.  Thomson v. Larson  In another case wherein both the participants had contributed expression, the court denied joint authorship status due to lack of requisite intent. Thomson v. Larson revolved around the claims to co-authorship of the musical Rent made by a dramaturge. In this particular case, Jonathan Larson, the author, had written the original play and was having it produced by the New York Theatre Workshop (\\"NYTW\\"). Lynn Thomson, who was a literature professor at New York University, was hired to help shape and form the plot. The NYTW and Thomson entered into an agreement the terms of which stated that Thomson was to be listed as 'dramaturge' for billing purposes as an independent contractor. However, not long after the dress rehearsal, Larson died and Thomson filled in his shoes and concluded the book to be used for the musical. At this stage, Thomson was yet to sign a waiver which would entail her handing over any copyright interest in the concluded work. Notwithstanding the fact that Thomson had a significant contribution in portions that could be copyrighted to the end result, the court held that Rent was not the product of joint work and as such Thomson could not claim the status of co-author. The argument furthered in this regard was that there was a lack of expression of an indication on behalf of Larson which would indicate that it was ever his intention for Thomson to be a joint author. Instead, his intention as expressed characterized her capacity as an editor of his original work. The court reiterated the precedent established by Childress, rejecting Thompson's argument that the requirement of intention needs to be met with only in a situation where an author's contributions are minimal. The court held that in order to be characterized as a joint author, an individual must show two things: first, that he or she produced independent copyright material within the context of the creative process and second, that both individual authors exhibited mutual intent to create the joint work. However, the court argued that, despite Thomson's significant contribution to the development of Rent, Thomson's claim was without a clear demonstration that Larson knowingly intended to share the playwright credit with her and hence Thomson would not qualify as a joint author. = Difference from collective work = In the case of a collective work, defined in Section 101, separate and independent works are assembled into a collection, and while the independent works may have a copyright protection, the nature of copyright protection of the collection is different from that of the independent works. The collective work exists as a distinct entity, other than the individual works that form the collection. Therefore, the key characteristics are assemblage or collection of \\"separate and independent works into a collective whole\\". Unlike a work of joint authorship, a collective work such as periodicals lacks the elements of unity and merger. = Difference from derivative work = The definition of \\"joint works\\" has led to some concern that when a previously written work such as a play, novel or music is incorporated in a future work such as a motion picture, the authors of such previous works could claim to be the coauthors of the motion picture. It is usually true that a motion picture would be a joint work and not a collective work with respect to the authors actually working on the film, but the usual status of \\"employees for hire\\" given to them would not let the question of co-ownership come up. Although an author such as a songwriter or novelist may write a work hoping and expecting that his work will be used in a motion picture, it will still be a work of independent authorship because the author did not write the work with the intention of it being used in the motion picture. In such a case, the motion picture will be a derivative work, and Section 103 makes it amply clear that copyright in a derivative work is independent of, and does not affect the extent of any rights in any pre-existing works incorporated in the said derivative work. = Economic effect = In the case of joint authorship, each author is the owner of not only the part he or she created but of the whole work. Every author can freely use the work and license it out for others to use it. A co-owner of a work of joint authorship does not require other authors' permission to use the work himself, and the other authors can't object to such a use. If the license has been granted by one of the joint authors unilaterally, then the license fee collected, if any, must be shared appropriately with other joint authors. In the absence of an agreement determining how the license fee is to be shared, every joint author must receive an equal share irrespective of the amount of their individual contribution to the joint work. A joint author can sign a written statement in compliance with Section 204(a) to alter his ownership shares he is initially vested with. A joint author may also sue any third party for copyright infringement without asking other co-owners to join the litigation. Moreover, a joint author does not require other joint authors' consent to transfer his exclusive proportional interest in the work. However, a joint author cannot transfer all interest in the work without obtaining authorization from other co-owners, since that would result in \\"an involuntary transfer of the other joint owners' undivided interest in the whole\\". The interest of a joint author in a work of joint authorship is passed on to his heirs after his death, and not the other joint authors. Hence, in this regard, joint authorship in copyright law is similar to tenancy in common in property law and not a joint tenancy.  Law in India  Indian copyright law defines 'work of joint authorship' in Section 2(z) of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957 as \\"a work produced by the collaboration of two or more authors in which the contribution of one author is not distinct from the contribution of the other author or authors\\". The term of copyright protection in case of joint authorship is calculated from the death of the last author, which is sixty years post the death of the last author. = Relevant case = The leading case of joint authorship in India is Najma Heptulla v. Orient Longman Ltd. and Ors. In this case, the plaintiff is the legal heir of the author of the book India Wins Freedom. The defendant is the publisher of said book. The defendant entered into an agreement with one Prof. Humayun Kabir to make contents of the book known to the public. The plaintiff obtained an injunction restraining defendants from breaking seals of covers of the complete book India Wins Freedom and from making its contents known to the public. According to the preface to the said book written by Kabir, Maulana Azad used to describe his experiences in Urdu, on the basis of which a draft in English would be prepared by Kabir. The court held that active and close intellectual collaboration and cooperation between Maulana Azad implied that Kabir is a joint author of the book with Maulana Azad. Hence, the defendants were allowed to break the seals of the covers of the complete book India Wins Freedom and make its contents known to the public.

He is known for his free-standing sculptures and large-scale wall pieces made of thousands of components of various materials engaged to create an effect of fluidity and soft-like appearance. Mersh was born in Dorset and studied 'Art & Design' at The Arts Institute at Bournemouth. He then obtained a BA in 'Multi-Media Textiles' at Loughborough University (2003) and then moved to London to attend a Master's degree course in 'Mixed Media Constructed Textiles' at the Royal College of Art where he graduated in 2005. The same year he was awarded the 'Mercury Music and Art Prize' with his sculpture 'Shape of Music' and the Victoria & Albert Museum acquired 'Vinyl & CD Sculpture Part 2' and 'DNA Ball Sculpture' for its permanent collection. Over the past six years Mersh has focused on making sculptures using sea shells. In 2016 he was awarded the 'Mo√´t Hennessy Prize' for 'Best Contemporary Design' at PAD London (Pavillon d'Art et du Design).  Work  Rowan Mersh's early artworks consisted in textile sculptures and kinetic installation. One of his textile sculptures, 'Vinyl and CD Sculpture Part 2', was made using CDs and vinyl records covered with stretched jersey fabric. In 2009 Mersh took part to the group show 'Corn Craft' at Gallery FUMI - an exhibition that aimed at reconsidering the notion of beauty and luxury during time of economic struggle. For the occasion he worked at a dramatic ceiling installation made of 40000 individual pieces of corn strung onto mono-filament line. In 2012 he participated to the project 'Future by Artisan / 'Fatto a Mano commissioned by Italian fashion house Fendi. 'Fatto a Mano' involved a collaboration between Fendi artisans and artists, such as Mersh, who were commissioned to reinterpret Fendi's traditional practices. Mersh created a machine that registered his heart rate and rhythmically punched small holes in leather strips. The final installation consisted in a colourful composition of leather strips woven onto a steel framework. This interactive performance-based installation was shown at Harrods during the 'London Design Festival' and then toured to the Salone Del Mobile (Milano) and the Venice Biennale (Venice). Driven by his interest in sustainability Mersh participated to the charity event 'Pandamonium 2' - commissioned by WWF. Using surplus WWF paper the artist produced a wearable sculpture folding each sheet with origami techniques. Since 2012 Mersh has mainly worked at large scale sculptures made of responsibly sourced sea shells: dentalium, turritella and capiz. The artist selects, cuts, sands and polishes each shell before painstakingly hand assembling each of them into dynamic patterns. Mersh associates the process of assembling the shells to drawing. He respects the natural shape of the material - the curvature of each shells informs the position of the following one and the construction process ends in self-informed brush strokes.

The Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) approved Chicago's bid to host a World's Fair in 1982, but three years later the city withdrew its offer to host the event following the evaporation of political support and concerns that the event would not be able to recoup its expenses. The fair would have been twinned with the coinciding Seville Expo '92. Background Chicago had twice before hosted major worlds fairs, the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893 and Century of Progress from 1933 through 1934. The first of these predated the establishment of the of the Bureau International des Expositions, a sanctioning body for official worlds expositions, while the latter was formally sanctioned by it. Conception Several architects, including Harry Weese, would later claim to have been discussing the idea ever since plans for a 1976 World's Fair in Philadelphia faltered. The idea for a World's Fair in Chicago to mark the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in the \\"New World\\" first began to appear publicly in the late 1970s. The idea appeared in a 1977 newspaper article written by Charles Brubaker, vice-president of the architecture firm Perkins and Will. In 1978, officials from the City of Chicago indicated their interest in potentially hosting a future world's fair to the BIE. By 1979, idea took hold among a group of architects from the Chicago chapter of the American Association of Architects. They began to hold regular meetings to discuss the prospects of such a world's fair. Architects involved included such luminaries as Gertrude Kerbis, Helmut Jahn and Bertrand Goldberg. In 1980, Harry Weese met with business leaders including Thomas Ayers for a breakfast meeting at the Tribune Tower for the purpose of discussing means to \\"improve the image of Chicago\\". This ultimately led to the establishment of a tentative steering committee, led by Ayers. An official 1992 Worlds Fair Steering Committee would be established on February 11, 1981. Bid process =Becoming the United States candidate city= In October 1980, United States Secretary of Commerce Philip Klutznick notified the BIE that they intended to submit an application. The Chicago 1992 Worlds Fair Steering Committee also contacted the BIE to inform them that they intended to apply for a fair. Chicago Mayor Jane Byrne directly communicated her support for the fair to BIE president Patrick Reid. In January 1981, the planning committee officially incorporated as the Chicago World‚Äôs Fair - 1992 Corporation. In late June 1981, the Illinois General Assembly proclaimed its, \\"support for the goals of the Chicago World‚Äôs Fair 1992 Corporation and the establishment of a 1992 World‚Äôs Fair in Chicago.\\" On July 30, 1981, the Chicago City Council formally endorsed the fair. In August 1981, Illinois Governor James R. Thompson officially supported the fair. By November 1981, United States President Ronald Reagan endorsed the planned fair and offered, \\"the support and assistant of myself and the departments of my office in the staging of a successful exposition\\". By 1982, Jane Byrne's mayoral administration had included plans for a 1992 world's fair in Chicago's comprehensive plan. Byrne strongly supported the fair effort. The fair corporation garnered donations from corporations, including as Commonwealth Edison, Continental Bank, FCB, Marshall Field's, National Can Corporation, and Illinois Bell. Chicago was selected as the United States candidate city through a competitive selection hosted by the United States Department of Commerce, defeating the cities of Columbus, New York, Miami, Houston, Oklahoma City, and Sacramento. =Bureau of International Expositions bidding= Chicago was seen to be competing with Paris, France for the right to host a \\"universal exposition\\". Paris was seeking an exhibition in 1989 to commemorate the bicentennial of the French Revolution. June 24, 1982, the Bureau of International Expositions provisionally approved both Paris' and Chicago's proposed exhibitions, waiving the rule that mandated that \\"universal expositions\\" be held at least ten years apart, while also provisionally approving for Seville to host a \\"general exhibition\\" in 1992. =Bid proposal= Chicago proposed hosting a fair in 1992 to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in the \\"New World\\". Several teams of architects presented proposals for the fair grounds. One team was led by Stuart Cohen (a member of the \\"Chicago Seven\\") and Anders Nereim. Ultimately, a Skidmore, Owings & Merrill proposal, involving extensive use of lakefill, was selected. Chicago's proposal was to use 23 blocks of the city's lakefront, covering 475-acres of the Near South Side lakefront (295 acres of existing land, 180 acres of lakefill, 100 acres of lagoon and harbor areas), in addition to a 150 acre parking lot to accommodate 19,000 cars plus a secondary lot for 10,000 more cars. Outside of the proposed parking lots, all the land was owned by either the Chicago Park District of the State of Illinois. The land used would include Grant Park, and would massively expand the lakefront parkland on the Near South Side. The plan also entailed the closure of Meigs Field. New artificial islands would dot the lakefront between Balbo Drive and 31st Street. The new parkland would partially fulfill the vision Daniel Burnham had outlined in the Plan of Chicago. Proposed infrastructure improvements included widening Lake Shore Drive and the Dan Ryan Expressway, upgrading roads in the neighborhoods of Pilsen and Chinatown. The fair anticipated 65 million visitors, and was estimated to cost between $400 million and $600 million to stage. Preparations Architects such as Harry Weese collaborated with the World's Fair Authority throughout the design process. There was a Women‚Äôs Committee for the 1992 Chicago World‚Äôs Fair, which sought to bring about greater female representation at the fair, including a Women's Building, similar to the one at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition. The election of a new Chicago mayor, Harold Washington, in 1983, as well as the coinciding election of new members to the Chicago City Council, saw greater hostility towards the fair in the city's government. Washington was wary of the fair, refusing to have the city bear the burden of cost overruns. Members of the Chicago City Council regularly expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed location of the fair, with several alderman pushing to move the fair to their own wards. On June 27, 1984, United States President Ronald Reagan issued a presidential proclamation inviting US states to participate in the exposition and both authorizing and directing the United States Secretary of State to, on his behalf, invite foreign countries to participate in the exposition. However, from the start, Reagan only had promised limited, and contingent, federal support. The fair preparations ultimately became hampered by a lack of federal resources and support. There were continued arguments in Chicago about the site of the fair, with many alternate sites being proposed. In 1984, architect Bertrand Goldberg proposed alternate plans for the fair grounds, instead focusing on inland development along the Chicago River, creating a \\"floating World's Fair\\" sited in three new basins within the river, and also siting other parts of the fair \\"floating\\" in Monroe Harbor. The most planned out and supported alternative site proposal was a 450 acre site on Lake Calumet on the far south side. =Financing= When the city first bid, it estimated the fair to cost between $400 million and $600 million. Costs estimates for the fair rose. By 1984, it was estimated to cost $800 million. By 1985, the price sat at $1.1 billion. The fair struggled to amass solidified financial pledges from private industry or from state and local governments. It was estimated that the fair would require over 50 million visitors to remain solvent. For instance, in 1984 when the price tag sat at $800 million, it was estimated that the fair would need to attract 54.5 million visitors and generate $892 million to remain solvent. While the fair officials were projecting the fair would turn a profit, several outside studies were projecting massive deficits. In 1984, the fair had failed in a quest to receive a $450 million loan from the state of Illinois. In the end, the fair planners had been proposing that the fair would be funded, in part, with $511 from the private sector, including $290 in bonds. The State of Illinois was being requested to directly provide $278 million in funding, and sell an additional $220 million in guarantee bonds. The United States Federal Government was anticipated to provide $80 million in funds. Chicago was to provide $28 million in funds to develop Navy Pier. The city was also expected to provide 14 years of property tax abatements on the land for the fair, giving up $33 million in annual tax revenues. State legislatures took issue with the plans that specified that the private investors would have priority over the state in recouping their investment. The state also desired for the state to contribute less, and the city to contribute more. Federal financial contribution was not guaranteed. The Chicago city government ultimately refused to make a financial investment in the fair. Cancellation The 1984 Louisiana World Exposition financially failed and declared bankruptcy, proving a death knell for the embattled Chicago fair effort. In June 1985, the Illinois state legislature refused to appropriate funds to finance the fair, criticizing the planned fair as, \\"misguided, risky, and fatally flawed\\". That month, a legislative advisory panel issued a report, declaring that, \\"proceeding with the fair as planned would be a misguided economic decision.\\" The fair lost the support of Governor James R. Thompson, Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, and the support of the Chicago World's Fair 1992 Authority itself. The fair also did not have support from Chicago mayor Harold Washington. By the time of its 1985 death, $12 million in both public and private funding had already been spent on the fair effort. In December 1987, the BIE formally withdrew its sanction for a 1992 Chicago universal exposition, officially marking its death and preventing its revival.

They had three sons: Albert Kahiwahiwa NƒÅwahƒ´ (1881‚Äì1904), Alexander Ka ªe ªeokalani NƒÅwahƒ´ (1883‚Äì1942) and Joseph NƒÅwahƒ´, Jr. (1885‚Äì1888). Through their sons, they have surviving descendants living to this day. They also adopted a daughter named Emmeline Kaleionamoku \\"Kalei\\" NƒÅwahƒ´ (1877‚Äì1901), who died while attending St. Andrew's Priory School in Honolulu.; During her husband's political career and the couple's residency in Honolulu, Emma became a lady-in-waiting and confidante to Queen Lili ªuokalani. Political activism The Hui Aloha  ªƒÄina o Na Wahine, 1893 Following the overthrow of the monarchy, on January17, 1893, her husband Joseph NƒÅwahƒ´ became the president of Hui Aloha  ªƒÄina oNa Kane (Hawaiian Patriotic League for Men), a patriotic group founded shortly after the overthrow to oppose annexation and support the deposed queen. Emma joined the corresponding female organization, the Hui Aloha  ªƒÄina oNa Wahine (Hawaiian Women's Patriotic League), which was under the leadership of Abigail Kuaihelani Campbell as president.; She served one of the member of the executive committee of the organization in 1893 and later served as the Secretary of the Hilo Branch of the League. In 1893, Emma and the other members of the executive committee of Hui Aloha  ªƒÄina oNa Wahine submitted a petition to the United States Commissioner James Henderson Blount sent by President Grover Cleveland to investigate the overthrow. The petitions addressed to the government of the United States read: In December 1894, a search warrant was served on the NƒÅwahƒ´s' KapƒÅlama home looking for \\"sundry arms and ammunition.\\" Although nothing was found, Joseph NƒÅwahƒ´ was arrested for treason and bail was set at 10,000 dollars. He spent nearly three months in jail until being bailed out. In May 1895, NƒÅwahƒ´ and Emma founded Ke Aloha Aina, a weekly anti-annexationist newspaper written in the Hawaiian language to promote Hawaiian independence and opposition to American annexation. The paper ran until 1920.; Following his release, NƒÅwahƒ´'s health deteriorated from the tuberculosis he had contracted during his imprisonment. On the recommendation of his doctor to seek a change of climate, they left Hawaii for a trip to San Francisco, California. They left Honolulu aboard the steamer Alameda on August 20, 1896, along with the families of Edward C. MacFarlane and Hermann A. Widemann, both influential royalists and former cabinet ministers of Lili ªuokalani.; ; ; On September 14, 1896, NƒÅwahƒ´ died of tuberculosis in San Francisco. According to Silva, his last words were to Emma, apologizing for \\"taking her so far from the ‚Äò√§ina and from her family and friends, to deal with his death alone in a foreign place\\". Emma had the remains of her dead husband embalmed and returned to Hawaii for two grand state funerals organized by his supporters, and burial at their home in Hilo. An anti-annexation meeting at Hilo, 1897 After NƒÅwahƒ´'s death, Emma became an important political leader in her own right, continuing the legacy of her husband. In 1897, Emma and members of both the male and female branches of Hui Aloha  ªƒÄina collected over 21,000 signatures by the residents of the Hawaiian Islands opposing an annexation treaty being discussed on the floors of the United States Senate. These K≈´ ªƒì Petitions were submitted by a delegation of Native Hawaiians and was used as evidence of the strong resistance of the Hawaiian community to annexation, and the treaty was defeated in the Senate. After the failure of the treaty, Hawaii was instead annexed by the Newlands Resolution, issued in July 1898, shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. After annexation, Emma helped organize the Democratic Party of Hawaii in 1899 at the time of the formation of the Territory of Hawaii. In the 1910s, she became a supporter of the women's suffrage movement prior to the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920.

Flow description Consider a plane wall located at \\\\theta=0 in the cylindrical coordinates (r,\\\\theta), moving with a constant velocity U towards the left. Consider another plane wall(scraper), at an inclined position, making an angle \\\\alpha from the positive x direction and let the point of intersection be at r=0. This description is equivalent to moving the scraper towards right with velocity U. The problem is singular at r=0 because at the origin, the velocities are discontinuous, thus the velocity gradient is infinite there. Taylor noticed that the inertial terms are negligible as long as the region of interest is within r\\\\ll u/U( or, equivalently Reynolds number Re = Ur/ u \\\\ll 1), thus within the region the flow is essentially a Stokes flow. For example, George BatchelorBatchelor, George Keith. An introduction to fluid dynamics. Cambridge university press, 2000. gives a typical value for lubricating oil with velocity U=10\\\\text{ cm}/\\\\text{s} as r\\\\ll0.4\\\\text{ cm}. Then for two- dimensional planar problem, the equation is : abla^4 \\\\psi =0, \\\\quad u_r = \\\\frac 1 r \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi}{\\\\partial\\\\theta}, \\\\quad u_\\\\theta = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi}{\\\\partial r} where \\\\mathbf{v}=(u_r,u_\\\\theta) is the velocity field and \\\\psi is the stream function. The boundary conditions are : \\\\begin{align} r>0,\\\\ \\\\theta =0: &\\\\quad u_r = -U, \\\\ u_\\\\theta= 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ r>0,\\\\ \\\\theta =\\\\alpha: &\\\\quad u_r = 0, \\\\ u_\\\\theta= 0 \\\\end{align} SolutionAcheson, David J. Elementary fluid dynamics. Oxford University Press, 1990. Attempting a separable solution of the form \\\\psi =U r f(\\\\theta) reduces the problem to :f^{iv} + 2 f + f =0 with boundary conditions :f(0)=0,\\\\ f'(0)=-1, \\\\ f(\\\\alpha)=0, \\\\ f'(\\\\alpha)=0 The solution is :f(\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha^2 - \\\\sin^2\\\\alpha} [\\\\theta \\\\sin \\\\alpha \\\\sin (\\\\alpha-\\\\theta) - \\\\alpha(\\\\alpha-\\\\theta) \\\\sin\\\\theta] Therefore, the velocity field is : \\\\begin{align} u_r &= \\\\frac{U}{\\\\alpha^2 - \\\\sin^2\\\\alpha} \\\\\\\\{ \\\\sin \\\\alpha [\\\\sin(\\\\alpha-\\\\theta)-\\\\theta\\\\cos(\\\\alpha-\\\\theta)] + \\\\alpha[\\\\sin\\\\theta - (\\\\alpha-\\\\theta)\\\\cos\\\\theta]\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\\\\\ u_\\\\theta &= -\\\\frac{U}{\\\\alpha^2 - \\\\sin^2\\\\alpha} [\\\\theta \\\\sin \\\\alpha \\\\sin (\\\\alpha-\\\\theta) - \\\\alpha(\\\\alpha-\\\\theta) \\\\sin\\\\theta] \\\\end{align} Pressure can be obtained through integration of the momentum equation : abla p = \\\\mu abla^2\\\\mathbf{v}, \\\\quad p(r,\\\\infty)=p_\\\\infty which gives, :p(r,\\\\theta) - p_\\\\infty = \\\\frac{2\\\\mu U}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\sin\\\\theta+\\\\sin\\\\alpha\\\\sin(\\\\alpha-\\\\theta)}{\\\\alpha^2 - \\\\sin^2\\\\alpha} Stresses on the scraper Stresses on the scraper The tangential stress and the normal stress on the scraper due to pressure and viscous forces are :\\\\sigma_t = \\\\frac{2\\\\mu U}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\alpha-\\\\alpha\\\\cos\\\\alpha}{\\\\alpha^2 - \\\\sin^2\\\\alpha}, \\\\quad \\\\sigma_n =\\\\frac{2\\\\mu U}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\sin\\\\alpha}{\\\\alpha^2 - \\\\sin^2\\\\alpha} The same scraper stress if resolved according to Cartesian coordinates (parallel and perpendicular to the lower plate i.e. \\\\sigma_x = \\\\sigma_t \\\\sin\\\\alpha + \\\\sigma_n \\\\cos\\\\alpha, \\\\ \\\\sigma_y = -\\\\sigma_t \\\\cos\\\\alpha + \\\\sigma_n \\\\sin\\\\alpha) are :\\\\sigma_x = \\\\frac{2\\\\mu U}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\alpha-\\\\sin\\\\alpha\\\\cos\\\\alpha}{\\\\alpha^2 - \\\\sin^2\\\\alpha}, \\\\quad \\\\sigma_y =\\\\frac{2\\\\mu U}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\sin^2\\\\alpha}{\\\\alpha^2 - \\\\sin^2\\\\alpha} As noted earlier, all the stresses become infinite at r=0, because the velocity gradient is infinite there. In real life, there will be a huge pressure at the point, which depends on the geometry of the contact. The stresses are shown in the figure as given in the Taylor's original paper. The stress in the direction parallel to the lower wall decreases as \\\\alpha increases, and reaches its minimum value \\\\sigma_x = 2\\\\mu U/r at \\\\alpha=\\\\pi. Taylor says The most interesting and perhaps unexpected feature of the calculations is that \\\\sigma_y does not change sign in the range 0<\\\\alpha<\\\\pi. In the range \\\\pi/2<\\\\alpha<\\\\pi the contribution to \\\\sigma_y due to normal stress is of opposite sign to that due to tangential stress, but the latter is the greater. The palette knives used by artists for removing paint from their palettes are very flexible scrapers. They can therefore only be used at such an angle that \\\\sigma_n is small and as will be seen in the figure this occurs only when \\\\alpha is nearly 180^\\\\circ. In fact artists instinctively hold their palette knives in this position. Further he adds A plasterer on the other hand holds a smoothing tool so that \\\\alpha is small. In that way he can get the large values of \\\\sigma_y/\\\\sigma_x which are needed in forcing plaster from protuberances to hollows. Scraping a power-law fluid Since scraping applications are important for Non-Newtonian fluid (for example, scraping paint, nail polish, cream, butter, honey, etc.,), it is essential to consider this case. The analysis was carried out by J. Riedler and Wilhelm Schneider in 1983 and they were able to obtain self-similar solutions for power-law fluids satisfying the relation for the apparent viscosityRiedler, J., & Schneider, W. (1983).

The solution for the streamfunction of the flow created by the plate moving towards right is given by :\\\\psi = Ur\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\left[1-\\\\frac{J_1(\\\\theta)}{J_1(\\\\alpha)}\\\\right]\\\\sin\\\\theta + \\\\frac{J_2(\\\\theta)}{J_1(\\\\alpha)}\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\right\\\\\\\\} where :\\\\begin{align} J_1 &= \\\\mathrm{sgn}(F) \\\\int_0^\\\\theta F^{1/n} \\\\cos x\\\\, dx,\\\\\\\\\\\\ J_2 &= \\\\mathrm{sgn}(F) \\\\int_0^\\\\theta F^{1/n} \\\\sin x\\\\, dx \\\\end{align} and :\\\\begin{align} F = \\\\sin(\\\\sqrt{n(2-n)}x-C)\\\\quad \\\\text{if}\\\\, n<2,\\\\\\\\\\\\ F= \\\\sqrt{x-C}\\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\quad\\\\text{if}\\\\, n=2,\\\\\\\\\\\\ F=\\\\sinh(\\\\sqrt{n(n-2)}x-C)\\\\quad \\\\text{if}\\\\, n>2 \\\\end{align} where C is the root of J_2(\\\\alpha)=0.

The highway was signed into law designating the route, along with the proposed extension of I-57 by President Donald Trump and was designated on May 7, 2017. It travels north from a trumpet interchange with I-24 south of Hopkinsville to a cloverleaf interchange with its parent, I-69 and the Western Kentucky Parkway near Nortonville. As of June 2019, I-169 is still signed as the Pennyrile Parkway. No signage for I-169 has yet been put up, although \\"Future I-169\\" signs are present along the route. I-169 signage is expected to be installed when required upgrades to the Parkway are completed. Route description The route begins at a trumpet interchange with I-24 near Hopkinsville. It runs northward into the city of Hopkinsville. After passing through, I-169 runs through farmland and the West Kentucky Coalfield, running roughly parallel to U.S. Route 41 (US 41), bypassing numerous small towns before ending at a cloverleaf interchange with I-69 and the Western Kentucky Parkway, merging with I-69 through traffic. History The freeway was originally known solely as, and part of the Edward T. Breathitt Pennyrile Parkway, one of the original nine parkways in the Kentucky parkway system, from its 1969 opening until May 7, 2017, when the United States Congress officially designated the section from I-24 junction in southern Christian County to the I-69/Western Kentucky Parkway junction near Nortonville. In addition to I-169‚Äôs current alignment, the Pennyrile Parkway also traveled further northward to its original terminus in Henderson until most of that stretch of the Pennyrile was signed as I-69 in November 2015. US 41 followed the remaining routing of the Pennyrile Parkway from the Henderson Bypass exit to the US 41/US 60 junction in Henderson. After the I-169 designation was made official on May 7, 2017, the unsigned Kentucky Route 9004 (KY 9004) designation associated with the parkway was removed. The first was not built and completed until March 2011. The Pennyrile Parkway‚Äôs original southern terminus was at the exit 7 interchange in Hopkinsville. Construction of that section was built in phases from 2009 to 2011. At some point in the early 2010s after I-69 was designated on the first of the Western Kentucky Parkway, the current I-169 alignment was rumored to be a future I-24 spur instead, in which no plans were made.

For 57 years, its founders and owners maintained an office in New York City, and were the recognized leaders in the phrenological, physiological, and hygienic sciences. For half a century, they were the main educators in these branches of study. The organization was located at 27 East 21st Street, near Broadway. The work was inaugurated by Orson Squire Fowler and Lorenzo Niles Fowler in 1835. They were the first in America to give the science of phrenology a practical value by making special delineations of character. They began work in a small way, but steadily increased its scope. In 1843, they were joined by Samuel Roberts Wells, who subsequently married Charlotte Fowler, the sister of his partners. Later, the Fowler brothers withdrew from the publishing house. Orson died in 1887. Lorenzo continued his professional practice in London. Samuel Wells conducted the business of the original house until his death, in 1875, and Charlotte Fowler assumed the management until 1884. American Institute of Phrenology An outgrowth of the business was the American Institute of Phrenology, which was incorporated as an educational institution in 1866. Among the original incorporators were Horace Greeley, Rev. Dr. Samuel Osgood, Judge Amos Dean, Henry Dexter, Samuel R. Wells, Edward P. Fowler, M. D., and Nelson Sizer. Each year, beginning on the first Tuesday in September, a course of instruction in practical phrenology was given by a corps of experts, under the direction of Prof. Sizer, the president of the institute. Incorporation The Fowler & Wells Company was incorporated in 1884 with Charlotte Fowler Wells, President; Nelson Sizer, Vice-President and phrenological examiner; Dr. Henry Shipman Drayton, Secretary and editor of the company's publications; and Albert Turner, Treasurer and business manager. The company published The Phrenological Journal, a number of serial publications, and a large list of standard works on phrenology, physiognomy, ethnology, physiology, psychology and hygiene. Early in 1892 the house took possession of new quarters at 27 East 21st Street, which included business offices, editorial rooms, lecture rooms, and phrenological parlors, where examinations were made and charts were created daily. An interesting feature in the lecture-room of the Fowler & Wells Company's building was a large collection of casts of the heads of people who were prominent in various ways in past years. In addition, there were skulls from many nations and tribes, as well as animal crania, illustrative of phrenology; this constituted a free public museum, and included material for instruction at the Institute.

It won the 12th Annual FC2 Illinois State University National Fiction Competition judged by William T. Vollmann. The novel is a prime example of ecofiction, and culminates in a battle between a fictional Missouri town named Isaura and the Ozark chemical company, which has been the economic linchpin for the community for many decades. The company is accused of releasing toxic waste which has poisoned the groundwater. Writing in the Washington Post, Tom LeClair compares the book favorably to The Recognitions by William Gaddis, saying: \\"This first novel resembles the ambitious debuts of McElroy (A Smuggler's Bible) and Pynchon (V), but author Evan Dara pushes the bar back upward toward Recognitions-height. With The Lost Scrapbook Dara asks readers to vault into an insistently bookish book, a dangerous and courageous request in an age of Web browsers and Net servers....I'd hate to see The Lost Scrapbook lost for 30 years, as The Recognitions went unrecognized, because Dara is a consummate ventriloquist of our time's voices and a remarkable ringmaster of our culture's circus acts....At the end of The Recognitions a composer finally plays his own music in a cathedral, hits a very difficult note, and brings the cathedral down on his head.

Established in August 1944 on the basis of the J√§gerstab (Fighter Staff), it was composed of government and SS personnel, as well as representatives of the armament manufacturers. J√§gerstab played a key role in the exploitation of slave labour for the benefit of Germany's industry and its armed forces, the Wehrmacht. The task force supported the Luftwaffe's Emergency Fighter Program, including the development of the \\"people's jet\\", Heinkel He 162. Background and formation The J√§gerstab (Fighter Staff) was established on 1 March 1944 by the order of Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments and War Production in the Hitler Cabinet, with support from Erhard Milch of the Reich Aviation Ministry. Its goal was to increase the production of fighter aircraft to counteract the Allied campaign of strategic bombing. Speer and Milch played a key role in directing the activities of the agency, however, the day-to-day operations were handled by Chief of Staff Karl Saur, the head of the Technical Office in the Armaments Ministry. The J√§gerstab had been given extraordinary powers over labour, production and transportation resources. The task force immediately began implementing plans to expand the use of slave labour in the aviation industry. The progress achieved through the work of the J√§gerstab was seen as a success by the German authorities. The cooperation between the Reich Ministry of Aviation, the Ministry of Armaments and the SS proved especially productive. Although intended to function for only six months, already in late May Speer and Milch discussed with Goring the possibility of centralising all of Germany's arms manufacturing under a similar task force. On 1 August 1944, Speer reorganised the task force into the R√ºstungsstab (Armament Staff) to apply the same model of operation to all top-priority armament programs. Karl Saur stayed on as chief of staff. Activities and results Internal view of the planned underground factory, Weingut I, one of J√§gerstabs projects, as found by the U.S. Army in 1945. The formation of the R√ºstungsstab allowed Speer, for the first time, to consolidate key arms manufacturing projects for the three branches of the Wehrmacht under the authority of his ministry, further marginalising the Reich Ministry of Aviation. Several departments, including the once powerful Technical Office, were disbanded or transferred to the new task force. The organisation of the task force was further streamlined in October 1944, by combining Airframes Main Committee and Equipment Main Committee into the Aircraft Construction Main Committee under Karl Frydag. The committee in turn was subdivided into four key task forces: single-piston engine fighter aircraft; jet fighters; bombers and special aircraft. In this capacity, Frydag oversaw the day-to-day development and production activities relating to the He 162, the Volksj√§ger (\\"people's fighter\\"), as part of the Emergency Fighter Program. The task force continued the J√§gerstabs work on the fighter aircraft, which by then were being produced in sufficient numbers. By the autumn of 1944, however, the Luftwaffe (air force) lacked trained pilots to operate them. In November 1944, Colonel Gordon Gollob, at the time the leader of day fighters, noted that the air force lacked fuel to be able to train pilots. Speer acknowledged the problem in a December 1944 speech at a test facility, by teasing Adolf Galland, the Inspector of Fighters, with a joke that the Armaments industry had \\"won the first round\\" and that he fully expected the Luftwaffe to win the next. The R√ºstungsstab assumed responsibilities for the underground transfer projects of the J√§gerstab. In November 1944, 1.8 million square meters of underground space were ready for occupancy, encompassing over 1,000 spaces commissioned by the task force. According to the historian Marc Buggeln, the R√ºstungsstab played a key role in maintaining and increasing production of fighter aircraft and V-2 rockets.

His career peaked as the head coach for Merrimack for seven seasons. Career Serino started his coaching career with Saugus High School in his home town of Saugus, Massachusetts, heading the program for seven seasons. In 1988 he became the bench boss for Northfield Mount Hermon School and remained there for three years before he accepted an offer to become an assistant coach at New Hampshire under Dick Umile. Serino served in that capacity until 1998 when he became the head coach for Merrimack. When he took over the program the Warriors had not had a winning season since joining Hockey East in 1989 and during his entire 7-year tenure that trend continued. Merrimack never finished above 7th place in the conference and lost every Hockey East tournament game they played. In his final season Serino had by far his worst record, going 1‚Äì22‚Äì1 in the conference and missing the tournament. Unconfirmed reports at the time asserted that the players on the team had asked Serino to resign as head coach, which he did do after the season, but not before he accepted a move back to the High School ranks, this time at Malden Catholic. Serino remained the head coach for Malden until his death in 2012 as a result of throat cancer, a disease he had been diagnosed with in 2001.

A well-known name on the international jazz scene and veteran touring bass player, he has graced stages alongside many staple names including, Steve Coleman, The Roots, Rudresh Mahanthappa, Wayne Krantz, Meshell Ndegeocello, Common, and Jill Scott, to name a few. Currently, Tidd regularly tours and records with alto saxophonist Steve Coleman, is the Creative Music Program Director at the Kimmel Center for Performing Arts in Philadelphia, PA and is the owner of recording/production studio Tidbit Sonos.  Early life  Anthony Tidd was born in London, England to Trinidadian immigrants. At the age of 5 he enrolled at London's prestigious Newham Academy of Music and began studying classical violin. Tidd said \\"There, I got a whole classical background, playing in orchestras and learning how to read music, and they also taught me music theory.\\" Tidd went on to learn how to play the electric bass. He was enrolled at Newham Academy of Music until age 16 and then he moved on to Thurrock College, followed by Goldsmiths University.  Music career  Tidd's professional music career began as a teenager with the group Quite Sane in the 90s. The group was formed with guitarist Eric Appapoulay and drummer Richard Cassell. Tidd said of the group, \\"We started out playing James Brown covers and stuff that was popular at the time, like Michael Jackson, and it wasn't long before we arrived at fusion music like Chick Corea and the Yellowjackets\\". The group went on to record the critically acclaimed album The Child of Troubled Times. During that same time period of the late 1990s Tidd was introduced to the music of saxophonist Steve Coleman by another Quite Sane band member. Shortly thereafter the manager of the then unsigned band The Roots, Richard Nichols, and Steve Coleman made a trip to London to hear Tidd play. Coleman's frequent collaborator Greg Osby had recommended the young British bassist so highly that the saxophonist flew across the Atlantic to hear for himself. As Tidd recalls, \\"He put on a cassette ‚Äî that's how long ago this was ‚Äî and I said, 'This is amazing. Who programmed the drums?' He said, 'That's a live drummer, a guy called Ahmir Thompson'\\". Tidd went on to live with The Roots while they spent some time in London with the help of Richard Nichols. In 1996 with the help of resources from Nichols and Coleman Tidd moved to the U.S. and formed the production team Noize Trip with Melvin \\"Chaos\\" Lewis. Through his work as a producer and musician Tidd has worked with well-known names such as Common, Jill Scott, The Black Eyed Peas and Macy Grey. He continues to work regularly with members of The Roots on various projects. In 2010 Anthony Tidd began working for the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia as the Creative Music Program Director. Tidd has grown the program from the ground up creating content and educating students in a variety of areas including theory, harmony, rhythm skills, ear training, improvisation, sight reading and jazz history. In addition to his role as the Creative Music Program Director Tidd is the curator of a free monthly jam session at the Kimmel Center called \\"Sittin In.\\" Tidd's arrival in the states was during the height of the Black Lily era and his position at the Kimmel has created a great opportunity to revive the essence of a live jam session and showcase the talented artist and musicians in Philadelphia and the surrounding area. Tidd has said, \\"If I could sum up my mission, it's to bring the public at large back into the fold of appreciating creative music\\". Currently, Tidd continues to work with Steve Coleman recording albums and touring domestically and internationally with several of Steve Coleman's ensembles.  Other work  Tidd has composed music for the United Nations, the BBC, American Airlines, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as film & television. In 2016 he was chosen for the Jazz Composers Orchestra Institute in which he wrote an orchestral piece for the Buffalo Philaharmonic Orchestra.

Commercially, the book was a success, spending three weeks at the top of the list of bestselling books in the world as well as reaching the number one spot on The New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover graphic books in Japan. Background Middleton had been considering writing a book for a number of years In an interview with The Guardian, Middleton admitted he is not an avid reader by any standard, but in the end did decide to author a novel that \\"the kind of book that I would read\\". He considered the opportunity to write a book about the stock characters that he employs in his YouTube videos an \\"important\\" way to give them their own style. Rights to publish the book were auctioned by Middleton's management agency OP Talent Limited, and bought by HarperCollins in the US and Trapeze (Orion) in the UK. The news that Middleton was writing a book was made public in May 2016. In October 2016, Middleton promoted his book at the Cheltenham Literature Festival where he was the first author of 2016 to sell out his tickets to the event. Plot Trayaurus and the Enchanted Crystal is a story about DanTDM and his scientist friend Trayaurus, who, one day, discovers a crystal that has crashed on The Overworld while shattering into five pieces. It does not take long until they discover its powerful potential. DanTDM and Trayaurus set out to find the other crystals, but are hindered in their objective by their nemesis Denton who appears in many of Daniel‚Äôs old Minecraft videos. Denton is trying to gain all of that power for himself. The lead characters feel like they have no choice but to stop Denton by finding all the remaining pieces first, preventing Denton from becoming more dangerous than he already is at present. Sales Commercially, the book was well received in both the United Kingdom and the United States. In the UK, Trayaurus and the Enchanted Crystal was able to reach the first spot of the bestsellers list for three weeks. In the US, the book was able to reach the twenty-third spot on the USA Today's Best-Selling Books list while also reaching the first spot on The New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover graphic books and remaining there for eleven consecutive weeks.Listings on The New York Times Best Seller list per week: Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 5, Week 6, Week 7, Week 8, Week 9, Week 10, Week 11, Week 12, when it fell to the second spot. Critical reception Common Sense Media rated Trayaurus and the Enchanted Crystal three out of five stars saying that although the novel tells an \\"amusing tale\\" and spins a \\"classic good-vs.-evil\\" story, the action within the book is \\"sometimes hard to follow\\" and occasionally moves the plot along too slowly. GeekDad gave a generally favourable review as well, hailing its \\"straightforward, easy-to-follow story\\" but criticizing the art style: \\"Lines are often roughly sketched and colors lack finesse\\". Night Owl Reviews was enthusiastic about the book and gives it four out of five stars. The website praised both the \\"outstanding\\" art style and \\"delightful\\" story, but did take issue with the fact that all characters are male: \\"I realize that most comics are read by boys but it would have been nice to see a female or two\\".

It organized various events, including lectures, literary evenings, and musical performances, but it is most noted for its contribution to the development of the Lithuanian theater. In total, R≈´ta staged about 50 plays. History and choir The official permission to establish R≈´ta was received on 25 September 1908 and the founding meeting took place on 11 January 1909. At that time the society registered 66 members and elected a 12-member board, which included (chairman), (vice-chairman), Mykolas Sle≈æeviƒçius (secretary), Jonas Basanaviƒçius, . The membership dues were set at a minimum of four rubles per year. Sle≈æeviƒçius was the main driving force behind the society ‚Äì he established a cultural society of the same name as a law student at the Odessa University. During the first year, the number of members grew to 192 and the society held 33 evenings (mostly dance) and four lectures. The society had a group for singers, dancers, music players, and theater performers. Most performances were open to the public. The society had a choir (about 50 members) which performed works by Lithuanian composers (Mikalojus Konstantinas ƒåiurlionis, Juozas Naujalis, Mikas Petrauskas, ƒåeslovas Sasnauskas, Stasys ≈†imkus) as well as foreign composers (Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Robert Schumann, Jules Massenet). In 1910, a Latvian subsidiary of the Gramophone Company recorded Tauti≈°ka giesmƒó and eight other patriotic songs. The singers were little trained ‚Äì their voices were loud but enthusiastic. Another recording of 20 songs by Lithuanian composers was made in 1914. Together with a symphonic orchestra, the choir performed cantata \\"De profundis\\" by ƒåiurlionis in 1913. Theater Backdrop painted by ƒåiurlionis The theater group with Mykolas Sle≈æeviƒçius was particularly active. It also included Gabrielius Landsbergis-≈Ωemkalnis, Antanas ≈Ωmuidzinaviƒçius, and others. The backdrop was painted by Mikalojus Konstantinas ƒåiurlionis in June 1909. It has survived and is preserved at the M. K. ƒåiurlionis National Art Museum and commemorated by a fresco inside the former theater of R≈´ta. The group, which was active even before R≈´ta was officially organized, staged several plays, most notably historical dramas Mindaugis, Lietuvos karalius by Juliusz S≈Çowacki (Mindaugas, King of Lithuania; premiered on 27 April 1908) and ≈Ωivilƒó, duktƒó Karijoto by Vincas Nagornoskis (≈Ωivilƒó, Daughter of Karijotas; premiered on 4 January 1909). The plays had to be approved by Russian censors who diligently removed any anti-Russian sentiments. As a result, many plays were significantly cut. For example, ≈Ωivilƒó, duktƒó Karijoto lost the entire first section and many scenes. The theater shift from simple comedies to historical dramas revealed limitations of the amateur theater and the need of a professional Lithuanian theater. To that end, in September 1910, the theater group separated from R≈´ta and joined the theater group of the Lithuanian Mutual Relief Society of Vilnius (Vilniaus lietuvi≈≥ savitarpinƒós pa≈°alpos draugija) to form an independent Lithuanian Artists' Union of Vilnius (Vilniaus lietuvi≈≥ artist≈≥ sƒÖjunga) which two years later established the first theater company. The union and the company closely cooperated with R≈´ta and staged many new plays. Lithuanian activists hoped that it would become the basis for the professional Lithuanian theater, but it faced financial difficulties and internal disagreements, paid no heed to theater education and hoped that practice would be enough. The last play, modernist The Snow by Stanis≈Çaw Przybyszewski, was performed on 10 May 1914. Further activities were disrupted by World War I.

Coal was mined in 50 mines in the area and towns, now annexed to Colorado Springs, were established to support residents of the coal mining industry. It was the home to gold and silver mine investors, like Winfield Scott Stratton and William Jackson Palmer. The Midland Terminal and Colorado Midland Railways were established in Colorado Springs to transported metals and ores and people from mountain towns. Once in Colorado Springs, ore was smelted there. People and goods were transported on the Railways to and from Colorado Springs, as well as on the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad. Mine workers typically lived on the west side of town, like Old Colorado City, while investors lived in the Old North End. Gold During the Pike's Peak Gold Rush, Old Colorado City was founded in 1859, based upon the vision of it being a major supply hub via Ute Pass for the new gold mines in South Park, the Upper Arkansas River area, and Blue River.Jerome C. Smiley, Semi-Centennial History of Colorado, (Chicago: Lewis, 1913) 267-268. Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek District Railway, Colorado Midland Railway, and Midland Terminal Railway operated between Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek. Colorado Midland traveled further west to other mining towns. There was a significant tie between Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek, particularly among investors and people who settled in Cripple Creek. Mining exchange businesses were established in downtown Colorado Springs. Colorado Springs Mining Stock Association was founded about 1886 to trade stock of Cripple Creek mines, some of which grew between 1,000% and 10,000% by 1893. It traded stocks \\"in almost every state and country in the world.\\" John W. Proudfit & Co., founded in 1890, was the first organization in Colorado Springs to buy and sell mining stocks. It had office in three cities in Colorado and in London. The Crosby- Ehrich Syndicate was a mining stock and investment brokerage house, with representatives coordinating transactions with Cripple Creek businesses. Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek District Railway at St. Peter's Dome, 1910s When gold was discovered in Cripple Creek and Victor in 1890, some of the Colorado Midland Railway owners formed the Midland Terminal Railroad, a standard gauge spur line from Divide to Cripple Creek, which allowed for passenger travel to and from Cripple Creek, shipment of equipment into the area, and the transport of ore to processing mills in Old Colorado City beginning in 1895. Colorado Springs was a transfer point for people and goods to and from other areas of the country via the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad. The Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek District Railway completed an alternate route to Cripple Creek and Victor, traveling through the mountains south of Pikes Peak, called the Short Line in 1901. It was used to transport cargo, as well for sightseeing. In 1920, the tracks were abandoned the resulting road is the current Gold Camp Road. Andrew James Harlan, Assaying office in Colorado Springs, 1915, Pikes Peak Library District digital collections Assay offices were established in Colorado Springs to test the purity of precious metals. In the 1890s, the metal ore smelting businesses were established in Old Colorado City. Golden Cycle Mining and Reduction Company, involved in coal and gold mining, operated a custom mill, treating up to 40,000 tons of Cripple Creek ore each month. The mill had rolls, roasting furnaces, and cyanide equipment. In 1900, Cripple Creek was the world‚Äôs second richest gold camp, bringing in $20 million a year. Three years later, mine industry workers went on strike for better working conditions and higher wages. This involved people that worked in smelting firms, mills, and in mines. After people had died and property was damaged during the strike, the strikers were unable to make an agreement with their employers during the Colorado Labor Wars (1903‚Äì1904). The mining business faltered during World War I, when workers supported the war effort. It also slowed during the Great Depression (1930s). Silver and lead Ore was also sent, such as from Leadville, to Colorado Springs, where was processed for silver and lead. Coal = Colorado Springs Coalfield = The Colorado Springs Coalfield is located in the southwestern part of the Denver Basin, where the lower part of the Laramie Formation ranges from 150 to 200 feet thick, and the upper part ranges from 100 to 150 feet thick. The lower part of the Laramie in the Colorado Springs coal field includes alternating beds of very fine to fine-grained sandstone, claystone, and coal, whereas the upper part is composed primarily of claystone with thin interbeds of fine-grained sandstone. In 1910, Marcus I. Goldman designated three coal beds in the lower part of the formation as coal beds A‚ÄìC in ascending order; other unnamed thin and lenticular coal beds are also present in the area. Most of the mines in the Colorado Springs coal field produced coal from the A and B coal beds. Coal bed A is present from 30 to 65 feet above the base of the formation, and as a single bed, is as thick as 20 feet locally. Elsewhere in the coal field, coal bed A splits into two coal beds separated by about 8 feet of rock; in more extreme cases, the bed splits into a series of four to five thin coal beds separated by rock partings. Coal bed B is present from 25 to 50 feet above coal bed A, with massive sandstone typically separating the two coal beds. Coal bed B is as much as 13 feet thick locally, although the bed is more typically 5 feet thick or less throughout much of the Colorado Springs coal field. Coal bed C is lenticular and in places is absent. Where coal bed C is present, it lies from 20 to 50 feet stratigraphically above coal bed B and generally is less than 2 feet thick. By 1922, there were nine active coal mines, Pikeview, Keystone, City #1 and #2, Old Patterson, Danville, Cottonwood, Altitude, and Black Mariah. That year, workers of the Pikes Peak Coal Company (owner of Pikeview mines) complained of working conditions, particularly the smoke generated by firing shots to clear the mines. Ths is a common problem that the state had not been able to resolve. The State Mine Inspection Department reported that the company had found a solution; The shot firer would only fire shots when the mine had been vacated. Over the years, there was more than 16 million tons of coal mined from the Colorado Springs coal field. = Mining = Shaft or Lode Mining, lithograph, 1866, lithograph by Julius Bien, Pikes Peak Library District collection. The interior of a coal mine shaft, depicting workers and mining activities. Beginning about 1859, the area was mined for coal. There were 50 coal mines in the Colorado Springs, mostly in the Rockrimmon and Cragmor - Colorado Springs Country Club area. Mining in the Rockrimmon area occurred between below the surface, while the Cragmor mines were shallow, some only below the surface. Depending upon the depth of the coal bed, the mines were entered through vertical mine shafts or through inclined openings. The mines in the Rockrimmon area were the Corley, Columbine, Knights of Industry, three Pikeview, and the Klondike mines, the deepest of which was the Klondike mine at 500 feet. The Cragmor mines were the City Mine, the Altitude, Williamsville Mine, Curtis Mine, Patterson Mine, the Climax mines, the Conley, Busy Bee, and the Danville. The Country Club area mines were City #3, Keystone, New Keystone, Rapson, Austin Bluffs, El Paso, and Unknown mines. Even further southeast, near Academy and Constitution were City #4, Tudor, and Cardiff mines. Coal was mined using the \\"room and pillar\\" method, in which areas of unmined coal acted as pillars while coal was removed from the shafts, creating rooms. Sometimes, rather than leaving the pillar for support, the supporting coal was removed. The seams of coal was one to fourteen feet deep in the Colorado Springs area. =Subsidence and other hazards= Subsidence process and effects Of the city's 50 abandoned mines, 22 have become hazardous because they were \\"very shallow mines\\"‚Äîsome no more than below the surface‚Äîthat are now subject to sinking under developed land. In a study of mine subsidence in the Colorado Springs coal field by the Dames and Moore consulting firm in 1985, trough-like subsidence over room-and-pillar mines was observed to be irregular, and the authors of that report interpreted that the interior of any given subsidence trough would likely undergo varying periods of tension and compression, depending on the timing required for failure of existing coal pillars and supports. They also suggested that as overburden above the room-and-pillar mine decreases, trough subsidence would primarily be a series of sinkholes resulting from the collapse of mine rooms with scattered larger depressions (troughs) forming from the general failure of pillars or mine floor over the larger areas. Many of the hazardous, abandoned mines are near Cragmor, such as Cragmor Country Club Estates that had about 3,000 residents in the late 1980s. There were more than 2,400 crack and sinkholes in the Cragmor Country Club Estates area, while there were only a total of seven in other areas of Colorado Springs during a 1985 study supervised by the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Division. In 2005, there was a collapse on Country Club Circle that threatened five houses. Because it is the most hazardous subsidence area in the state, a study was conducted in 2008 using Geophones to locate mining tunnels. The plan is to fill in voids with sand and gravel. Strategies for mitigating the risk due to sinkholes and subsidence include filling the voids, which can be costly due to the amount of material needed, and construction techniques so that structures are not prone to sinking. Strategies for managing the risk include insurance for subsidence and sinkholes. There are also hazards due to mine openings, drainage of metals or other pollutants from the mines into groundwater, or fires within mines or the outside waste banks. There are no known occurrences of groundwater contamination or fires, but they are ongoing risks. In April 1979, the surface plug of the 500-foot Klondike mine shaft at Woodman Road and I-25 had deteriorated and was reopened. Two mine opening hazards remain at the Cragmor- Country Club and the Wilson Ranch area. =Real estate development= By the 1950s, coal was no longer mined in the Cragmor area and land was developed for the construction of about 3,500 houses, which was completed in the early 1960s. Then, the initial instances of subsidence began, such as one on Mount View Lane in 1963. In another case, a dog died when the earth sunk in the backyard beneath a dog who became trapped in the falling dirt and died due to suffocation. In 1979, earth fell through an old mine shaft by a fourplex on Magnolia Street in the Cragmor area, forcing the evacuation of the residents and requiring a means to brace the building. That year, subsidence resulted in a sinkhole in the park. It was discovered that below the surface of the park were mine shafts and the pool was slipping into a shafts. The sinkhole was filled and the pool was braced when tons of concrete were poured into the shafts. Limestone Limestone was mined from the Pikeview Quarry, which began operations in 1905. Queens Canyon Quarry, north of Garden of the Gods, was mined for limestone from 1958 to 1990, creating a noticeable gash or scar in the Queens Canyon Quarry. A reclamation effort, led by Greg Francis, resulted in \\"resculpting\\" the terrain to support ongoing landscaping and tree planting efforts. On August 1, 2003, the hillside was renamed Greg Francis Bighorn Sheep Habitat in honor of Francis, who died October 2002. A statue of a bighorn sheep stands on Greg Francis Bighorn Sheep Habitat in recognition of the herd of 65 bighorns (in 2003) and Greg Francis, hundreds of volunteers, and efforts by Castle Concrete to reintroduce Rocky Mountain juniper trees, native grasses, and small pi√±on to the hills.  Cheyenne Mining District  The Cheyenne Mining District, located on Cheyenne Mountain, was the site of the Little Suzie gold mine established in the 1870s and silver and mineral mining that began in 1883. Eureka mine, Cather Springs, and Duffield near St. Peter's Dome on Gold Camp Road was mined for minerals, including Fluorite, cryolite, topaz, smoky quartz, fayalite, galena, and microcline.

A Nong married the chieftain and zhou-level official Nong Quan-fu (N√πng T·ªìn Ph√∫c) around 1020. She had several children, chief among them Nong Zhigao (born 1025). According to a legend of Zhetu villagers from Guangnan County, A Nong was both brave and wise. She is called Yah Woeng (Powerful Mother), with the legend recounting that she became accidentally pregnant one day. Her husband was unknown to her, as he always visited her at night. Per her father's suggestion, she tied a silk thread to his leg one night, only to discover the thread tied to the leg of one of their family dogs. Before fleeing to escape the wrath of her father, the dog told her that she would give birth when she met a deer. She gave birth, though when she met a buffalo. The legend relates that her son, Nong Zhigao, was defeated by a Chinese emperor because he was born prematurely. Although the History of Song describes A Nong as a shamaness who engaged in magic, including ritual human sacrifice, but Confucian prejudices may color the data. The Zhuang gender system was egalitarian, relative to Confucian orthodoxy. Confucian historians usually minimized or ignored powerful women, attributing their actions to their fathers, husbands, or sons. But the importance of Zhuang matriarch A Nong can be perceived, despite their veil of Confucian prejudices. Later events suggest that A Nong influenced her husband to kill his brother and take lands belonging to the Cen clan. The Nong clan then grew in power, with Nong Quan-fu founding the kingdom of Longevity (Èï∑ÁîüÂúã) and styling himself Tu Dan Chao, the first king of Dali. In 1039, Vietnamese emperor L√Ω Th√°i T√¥ng led an army into the region and captured Nong Quan-fu and much of his family. They were executed, though A Nong and her son Nong Zhigao both escaped. A Nong was reputed to be resourceful; \\"Zhigao often asked for and adopted her strategies when conquering cities and towns. She arrogated herself the title of Empress Dowager.\\" A Nong and Nong Zhigao developed close relationships with Chinese traders who made regular trips from Guangzhou to purchase gold. A Nong, with a trader known as Huang Wei, advised Nong Zhigao to engage Song forces at Yong. He was successful and went on to capture Hengzhou and Wuzhou before laying an unsuccessful siege on Canton in 1052. The court of Song placed bounties on the heads of Nong Zhigao and A Nong. A Nong's head fetched a 3,000 guan bounty and an official post ‚Äî a greater bounty than those placed on two Cantonese traitors. Following the mobilization of Song forces and a military defeat at Yong, A Nong and Nong Zhigao fled to Temo in Yunnan, where they attempted to raise more troops. They were caught and A Nong was executed in 1055. A Nong led a long struggle to preserve the unity of her people, but the forces arrayed against her were too great. Zhuang women have continued to act as leaders in the region, some of them worthy successors to A Nong, including the remarkable Zhuang woman Wa Shi.

The name comes from the Latin word Praeses which means \\"placed before\\" or \\"at the head\\". In 2011, the office of Preses was changed by law to be a 12th permanent bishopric within the Church of Norway. Prior to 2011, it was an elected position from within the 11 diocesan bishops that made up the Bishops' Conference of the Church of Norway. Former Preses of the Bishops' Conference, Helga Haugland Byfuglien The first permanent Preses was Helga Haugland Byfuglien who was appointed to the position on 25 March 2011 by the Cabinet of Norway, and she officially took over on 2 October 2011 at the next meeting of the Bishops' Conference. She retired in 2020 and was replaced by Olav Fykse Tveit. The Preses is a bishop, but is the only bishop in the Church of Norway who does not oversee a diocese. Rather, this bishopric primarily oversees the work of the Bishops' Conference and the duties assigned to it by the conference. The Preses is based at the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, along with the Bishop of the Diocese of Nidaros. The Preses is also the dean of the Nidaros domprosti (deanery) in central Trondheim. History View of the bishops in the Bishops' Conference in 2009 The Preses of the Bishops' Conference () was the official title of the elected leader of the Bishops' Conference since 1932. Before that time, the name was unofficially used along with \\"chairman\\" of the conference. Since 2011, the title is no longer elected, but a permanent bishopric. The Church of Norway separated from the Church of Denmark in 1814 when the union with Denmark ended. The Bishops of the Church of Norway met together rarely, with only minutes from 1877 and 1915 surviving. The Bishop of the Diocese of Kristiania served as the chairman of both meetings. This was a reflection of the fact that the royal court order of precedence from 1817 until the 1920s ranked the Bishop of Kristiania (Oslo) firmly in front of the other bishops. In 1934, the Bishops' conference was formalized by the law that was adopted by Johan Ludwig Mowinckel's 3rd government such that the Bishop of Oslo was elected by the bishops as the Preses for each meeting. In 1984, the rules were adjusted so that the Preses was not elected for each individual meeting session, but rather they were elected for one year at a time. In 1998 the Bishop of Oslo, Andreas Aarflot, resigned as bishop (and preses) and the other bishops decided that the rules should be changed and that the elections for Preses should be every four years rather than annually and that it would not have to be the Bishop of Oslo. Bishop Odd Bondevik, the Bishop of the Diocese of M√∏re was elected, the first time a non-Oslo bishop was elected. In 2011, the government of Norway changed the law to create a permanent Preses. The first permanent Preses was Helga Haugland Byfuglien. On 17 October 2019, Olav Fykse Tveit, the current General Secretary of the World Council of Churches, was nominated to be the next Preses. He took office in 2020. =List of elected Preses= *1877: Carl Peter Parelius Essendrop, chairman because he was the highest ranking bishop (Oslo) *1915: Jens Fr√∏lich Tandberg, chairman because he was the highest ranking bishop (Oslo) *1917‚Äì1922: Jens Fr√∏lich Tandberg, elected by bishops for each meeting *1922‚Äì1937: Johan Lunde, elected by bishops for each meeting *1937‚Äì1951: Eivind Berggrav, elected by bishops for each meeting *1951‚Äì1968: Johannes Smemo, elected by bishops for each meeting *1968‚Äì1972: Fridtjov Birkeli, elected by bishops for each meeting *1973‚Äì1977: Kaare St√∏ylen, elected by bishops for each meeting *1977‚Äì1998: Andreas Aarflot, elected by bishops for each meeting (1977‚Äì1984); elected by the bishops annually (1984‚Äì1998) *1998‚Äì2002: Odd Bondevik, elected by the bishops for four years *2002‚Äì2006: Finn Wagle, elected by the bishops for four years *2006‚Äì2010: Olav Skjevesland, elected by the bishops for four years *2010‚Äì2011: Helga Haugland Byfuglien, elected by the bishops until the new permanent Preses was in place =List of permanent Preses= *2011‚Äì2020: Helga Haugland Byfuglien *2020-present: Olav Fykse Tveit References External links *Official Bispem√∏tet site Category:Primates of the Church of Norway Category:Church of Norway ","title":"Preses (Church of Norway)"},{"id":"53988056","text":"Ferdinand III's Reichsexekution against Saxony and Bavaria in 1620 In German history, a Reichsexekution (sometimes \\"Reich execution\\" in English) was an imperial or federal intervention against a member state, using military force if necessary.Lars Vinx, The Guardian of the Constitution: Hans Kelsen and Carl Schmitt on the Limits of Constitutional Law (Cambridge University Press, 2015), p. 256, defines it as \\"the enforcement of the constitution of a federal state against the government of a constituent state, if need be with coercive means\\". The instrument of the Reichsexekution was constitutionally available to the central governments of the Holy Roman Empire (800‚Äì1806), the German Empire of 1848‚Äì49, the German Empire of 1871‚Äì1918, the Weimar Republic (1918‚Äì33) and Nazi Germany (1933‚Äì45). Under the German Confederation (1815‚Äì66) and the North German Confederation (1867‚Äì71), the same right belonged to the confederal government and is called Bundesexekution. Holy Roman Empire The basis of the Holy Roman Emperor's right to act against an Imperial Estate, by military means if necessary, lay in the imperial reforms enacted by the Diet of Worms in 1495, most importantly the declaration of Eternal Peace within the bounds of the empire. Against those who broke the peace, the emperor could obtain a ruling from the Imperial Chamber Court or the Imperial Aulic Council and then issue a Reichsexekution against the offending estate. Often, the imperial execution would be delegated to one or several other estates belong to the same Imperial Circle as the offender. When this was insufficient, it fell to the empire as a whole and the Reichsarmee (imperial army) to enforce the verdict of the court, resulting in a full Reichskrieg (imperial war), which may be known as a Reichsexekutionskrieg or Exekutionskrieg. This final escalation required the approval of the Imperial Diet after 1648.S√©bastien Schick, \\"Reichsexekution\\", in Falk Bretschneider and Christophe Duhamelle (eds.), ¬´ Les mots du Saint-Empire ¬ª ‚Äì un glossaire (Histoire du Saint-Empire: regards crois√©s franco-allemands, retrieved 7 May 2017).Sven D√ºwel, Ad bellum Sacri Romano-Germanici Imperii solenne decernendum: Die Reichskriegserkl√§rung gegen Brandenburg-Preu√üen im Jahr 1757: Das Verfahren der \\"preu√üischen Befehdungssache\\" 1756/57 zwischen Immerw√§hrendem Reichstag und Wiener Reichsbeh√∂rden (Berlin: Lit Verlag Dr. Wilhelm Hopf, 2016), vol. 1, p. 11.John Gagliardo, Reich and Nation: The Holy Roman Empire as Idea and Reality, 1763‚Äì1806 (Indiana University Press, 1980), p. 309, n. 13.

Although the act of parliament did not grant this body the right of Reichsexekution, the Frankfurt Constitution that came into effect on 28 March 1849 did grant it to the imperial government (which never in fact came into being). In January 1849, the Frankfurt Parliament passed a law banning casinos and other gaming establishments. It was to take effect on 1 May. The Landgraviate of Hesse- Homburg demanded compensation for the loss of its lucrative Spielbank Bad Homburg, but this was refused. On 9 March, Hesse-Homburg formally protested the law and on 1 May it had not complied. On 7 May, the provisional government sent a Reichskommissar, Theodor Friedrich Knyn, to Homburg with 700 troops in order to carry out a Reichsexekution.\\"Hessen-Homburg\\", in Heinrich August Pierer and Julius L√∂be (eds.), Universal-Lexikon der Gegenwart und Vergangenheit, 4th ed., vol. 8 (Altenburg, 1859), pp. 322‚Äì23.Wolfram Siemann, Vom Staatenbund zum Nationalstaat: Deutschland 1806‚Äì1871 (Munich: C.

Weimar Republic Soldiers on the streets during the Reichsexekution against communists in Saxony in 1923 Under Article 19 of the Bismarckian Constitution (1871‚Äì1918), a Reichsexekution could be undertaken only with the permission of the Bundesrat (Federal Council). After 1918, Reichsexekution was provided for by Paragraph 1 of Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution. Unused by the empire, it was employed four times between 1919 and 1933 against the following states:Michael Stolleis, A History of Public Law in Germany, 1914‚Äì1945 (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 99. *Thuringia (1920) *Gotha (1920) *Saxony (1923), for which see German October *Prussia (1932), for which see Preu√üenschlag Bundesexekution The right of Bundesexekution was confirmed by Article 26 of the Final Act of the Viennese Ministerial Conferences on 15 May 1820. This was the treaty that gave the German Confederation its final structure. It permitted the military occupation of a state that was in violation of confederal law, the assumption of executive powers by a Bundeskommissar, the deposition of the ruling prince and the abrogation of all unconstitutional laws.Articles 25‚Äì28 of the Final Act of the Viennese Ministerial Conferences (May 15, 1820), in \\"From Vorm√§rz to Prussian Dominance (1815‚Äì1866)\\", German History in Documents and Images (GHDI). In the German Confederation, a Bundesexekution was distinct from a Bundeskrieg (federal war), which was waged by the confederation as a whole against an external enemy, and a Bundesintervention (federal intervention), which was an intervention by the confederation on behalf of a member state to maintain order. The following Bundesexekutionen took place under the Confederation: *against the Duchy of Brunswick in 1830, because its duke, Charles II, refused to recognise the constitution accepted by his guardian, George IV of the United Kingdom, when he was a minor *against the Free City of Frankfurt in 1834 during the Frankfurter Wachensturm *against the duchies of Holstein and Lauenburg in 1863, which led to the Second Schleswig War in 1864 *against Prussia in 1866, because of a dispute over the government of occupied Schleswig-Holstein, which led to the Austro-Prussian War and the collapse of the confederation The same right of Bundesexekution is found in Article 19 of the North German Constitution of 26 June 1867.Verfassung des Norddeutschen Bundes at documentarchiv.de References Further reading *Brennert, Joachim. \\"Reichsexekution im alten Reiche\\".

Her paintings won awards at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1916 and 1917 and the annual Hoosier Salon exhibitions of 1926 and 1928. Her paintings were also selected for magazine covers for Woman's Home Companion (January 1920) and Literary Digest (January 17,1925). The Terre Haute, Indiana, native studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and at the Acad√©mie Vitti in Paris, France. In 1917 she moved from her longtime home in Delavan, Wisconsin, with her artist husband, Adolph Shulz, and son Walter, to the Brown County Art Colony in Nashville, Indiana. In 1926 she became a founding member of the Brown County Art Gallery Association in Nashville. She was also a member of the Chicago chapter of the Society of Western Artists. Her paintings are held in several collections, including those at the Art Institute of Chicago, the Indianapolis Museum of Art (Newfields), the Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites, the Ball State University Museum of Art, the Dailey Family Memorial Collection of Hoosier Art at Indiana University, the Brown County Art Gallery and Museum, and the Art Museum of Greater Lafayette, among others. Early life Ada Walter was born on October 21, 1870, in Terre Haute, Indiana. She was the daughter of Mary and John M. Walter, who had established a stone masonry and marble business and was also described as an architect. Ada's younger brother, Allen, was born when she was about two years old. Her father died of diphtheria in January 1873, before she was three years old. Mary Walter and her two children remained in Terre Haute until 1884, when the family moved to Indianapolis, Indiana. From 1885 until 1889 Ada attended Indianapolis High School, which was renamed Shortridge High School in 1897, and began to develop her artistic talents. Walter later credited Roda Selleck, the head of the school's art department, as the first person to inspire her interest in drawing. After her brother's death in December 1888 and her graduation from high school in 1889, Ada and her mother moved to Chicago, Illinois. From 1889 to 1893 Ada took lessons at the Art Institute of Chicago, where her instructors included John Vanderpoel, Oliver Dennett Grover, Frederick Freer, A. Kellogg, C. Wade, and Lorado Taft. Her mother died in 1892, when Ada was twenty-one. Ada Walter met Delavan, Wisconsin, native and fellow artist Adolph Shulz in 1892, when she summered in Delavan as an art student with Vanderpoel's class. Two weeks after their marriage in September 1894, the Shulzes sailed to Paris, France, where Ada studied at the Acad√©mie Vitti in under Luc-Olivier Merson and Rapha√´l Collin. Adolph studied at Acad√©mie Julian and the Acad√©mie Colarossi.Newton and Weiss, Skirting the Issue, p. 71.Perry, \\"Children and Sunlight,\\" p. 17. The couple had one son, Walter, who was born on June 10, 1895. After returning to the United States later that fall, the family settled in Delavan, Wisconsin, where they remained for the next twenty years. Adolph supported the family as a landscape painter and art educator, while Ada became a full-time wife and mother. She did not paint for the next ten years. Career Shulz resumed painting around 1905. She also began regularly exhibiting her work at the Art Institute of Chicago and elsewhere in elsewhere in the Midwest. Shulz's painting, The Picture Book, won an Art Institute award in 1916 and her painting, Mother and Child, won a Chicago Art League purchase price in 1917. She also had paintings selected for magazine covers for Woman's Home Companion (January 1920) and Literary Digest (January 17, 1925).Newton and Weiss, Skirting the Issue, pp. 73 and 324‚Äì25.Perry, \\"Children and Sunlight,\\" pp. 18, 20‚Äì21. The Shulz family began summering in Brown County, Indiana, in 1908, and in 1917 chose to move there permanently.Perry, \\"Children and Sunlight, \\", p. 19. Ada and Adolph Shulz built a home on land they purchased on Hoop Pole Ridge in Nashville and members of the Brown County Art Colony. Adolph painted local landscapes while Ada focused on painting scenes of Brown County's mothers and children. She was also active in organizing the local Christian Science Society and Nashville's public library. Adolph and Ada Shulz were founding members of the Brown County Art Gallery Association in 1926.Perry, \\"Children and Sunlight,\\" p. 20.Rachel Berenson Perry, \\"Introduction: An American Art Colony\\" in Letsinger-Miller and Perry, The Artists of Brown County, p. xxv. The couple were also members of the Chicago chapter of the Society of Western Artists. In addition to regularly exhibiting her work at the Brown County Art Gallery, Ada's painting were displayed at the annual Hoosier Salon art shows from 1925 through 1930. She won Hoosier Salon prizes for A Mother from the Hills in 1926 and The Pet Duck in 1928.Newton and Weiss, A Grand Tradition, p. 297. =Artistic style= Shulz favored painting outdoors throughout her career, and was particularly receptive to the effects of light. Unlike most of the Brown County Art Colony, who were primarily landscape painters, the major themes and subject matter of her Impressionistic style were mothers, children, and barnyard animals. Later years Ada and Adolph Shulz's son, Walter, began developing a career as an artist in Delavan, Wisconsin, prior to his enlistment and assignment to the Sixteenth Infantry, First Division, in France. Although he survived the fighting during World War I, Walter volunteered for occupation duty and died of diphtheria on December 12, 1918, after a hiking and sketching trip through the German countryside. Walter's death and grief over their loss caused the couple to grow apart. The marriage became even more strained in 1921 after Adolph became the art teacher of Alberta Rhem Miller and allowed her and her young daughter to stay at the Shulz home in Nashville. In 1924 Adolph moved into a separate cabin with Alberta. Adolph and Ada Schulz divorced on September 30, 1926. Adolph married Alberta within a month of his divorce from Ada.Newton and Weiss, Skirting the Issue, pp. 77 and 79.Perry, \\"Children and Sunlight, \\", p. 21. After the breakup of her marriage, Shulz resumed painting and exhibiting her artwork. She also became active in the Indiana Artists Club; however, her health declined after a solo exhibition of her work was held at the Milwaukee Journal Art Gallery in March 1928. Due to her Christian Scientist faith, she refused to seek medical treatment and died two months later. Death and legacy Shulz died in Nashville, the county seat of Brown County, on May 2, 1928, at the age of fifty-eight. The cause of her death is unknown, but is believed to have been cancer.Newton and Weiss, Skirting the Issue, pp. 324‚Äì25. She is buried at Spring Grove Cemetery in Delavan, Wisconsin.

The twenty-first tropical disturbance, third named storm, and second severe tropical cyclone of the annual cyclone season, Donna formed from an area of disturbed weather that was first monitored west-northwest of Fiji on 1 May 2017. The disturbance drifted eastward amid an increasingly favourable environment, and it was designated Tropical Depression 21F late on 2 May. Twelve hours later, it intensified into a Category 1 on the Australian tropical cyclone scale and was designated Tropical Cyclone Donna as the storm's motion shifted west and then south. After reaching its initial peak as a Category 4 cyclone early on 6 May, the effects of wind shear and upwelling caused the storm to weaken. However, it reintensified into a Category 5 cyclone on 8 May. Soon after, Donna entered a region of strong westerly flow and began to rapidly weaken. Continuing to accelerate in a southerly direction, Donna eventually weakened into a tropical low on 10 May. By 16 May, Donna's remnants had fully dissipated. Buffeting the island chain of Vanuatu, Donna has resulted in severe damage throughout the northern provinces, though the exact extent is unknown in the absence of good communication. Meteorological history On 1 May, the day after the official end of the South Pacific cyclone season, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring an area of disturbed weather about 1,455 km (905 mi) west-northwest of Nadi. Though it possessed an oblong area of low pressure partially exposed to the northeast of deep shower and thunderstorm activity, the system was embedded within an environment of moderate wind shear, good upper-level outflow, and warm ocean temperatures. The official warning agency for the South Pacific, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS), began monitoring the disturbance a short while later. As fragmented spiral bands began wrapping into the centre of circulation, the JTWC assessed that the potential for tropical cyclone formation was high, issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert accordingly at 21:00 UTC on 1 May. The storm tracked slowly eastward through the northern islands of Vanuatu but consolidated rapidly as upper- level winds became light, prompting the FMS to upgrade the disturbance to Tropical Depression 21F at 18:00 UTC on 2 May. This was followed by the JTWC's classification of Tropical Cyclone 18P three hours later. Following formation, the depression turned west in response to a developing subtropical ridge to its south. A continued favourable environment allowed it to intensify into a Category 1 on the Australian tropical cyclone scale by 06:00 UTC on 3 May, at which point it was named \\"Donna\\" by the FMS, and further to Category 2 intensity by 18:00 UTC. The JTWC, meanwhile, upped the cyclone to the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale, citing consolidation of deep convection near the centre and satellite intensity estimates around 120 km/h (75 mph). Despite some evidence of wind shear along the northern fringes of the storm, it began to clear an eye late on 4 May, prompting the JTWC to classify Donna as a Category 2 equivalent, and the FMS to upgrade to Category 3 strength. At 00:00 UTC on 6 May, after re-tracking through Vanuatu and beginning a southward track, Donna attained its initial peak as a Category 4 cyclone. Shortly thereafter, the effects of increased northeasterly upper-level flow became more prevalent as the storm's cloud pattern changed to a central cold cover and then devolved into patchy areas of moderate convection. Around 09:00 UTC on 6 May, the JTWC reduced the storm back to a Category 1 equivalent, and by 18:00 UTC, the FMS indicated Donna had weakened to a Category 3 cyclone on the Australian scale. Drifting south- southwest and then south, Donna continued to struggle under the combined effects of upper-level winds and ocean upwelling. By early on 7 May, however, convection within the eyewall began to increase in intensity, and the FMS upgraded Donna to a Category 4 cyclone for a second time accordingly. Three hours later, the JTWC estimated that it had intensified to a Category 4 equivalent, completely skipping Category 3 status. With a solid ring of deep convection surrounding a well-defined 55 km (35 mi) eye, the FMS upgraded Donna to a Category 5 cyclone at 00:00 UTC on 8 May, estimating that the storm possessed 10-minute sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph). As a result, Donna became the strongest off-season tropical cyclone on record during the month of May in the South Pacific basin. Weakening began shortly following peak intensity as Donna's eye became partially obscured and the eastern eyewall was eroded; the storm weakened back to Category 4 intensity by 18:00 UTC on 8 May, Category 1 intensity by 21:00 UTC on 9 May, and ultimately degenerated into a tropical low by 06:00 UTC on 10 May as it dodged New Caledonia. Preparations and impact According to Aon Benfield Inc. in January 2018, Donna was responsible for two deaths and a total of US$10 million in damage. =Vanuatu= As Donna buffeted Vanuatu, entire villages across the Torres Islands of Torba Province were forced to seek refuge in caves. Throughout the province, buildings were destroyed and others had their roofs ripped off. Heavy rainfall led to flooding of low-lying areas of Efate. In Port Vila, rushing water carved out large chunks of land that resulted in structural collapse. Across the entire northern half of the island chain, crops sustained significant damage and water sources were contaminated, though the full extent of the damage was unknown as a result of severed communications. =Solomon Islands= In the Temotu Province, Donna caused two fatalities; an adult who was struck by a fallen branch and a primary school student of Tarano School who drowned on an out-board motorboat when crossing from one-side to the other side of a lake. =New Zealand= Moisture from the remnants of Donna combined with a weakening Tasman Sea low to produce heavy rains over much of the North Island and the west coast of the South Island. In expectation of more than of rain, heavy rain warnings were issued for Nelson and the Bay of Plenty regions, while severe weather warnings were issued for much of the North Island.

Includes 35 photos from 2014 and 18 historic photos and other illustrations. The house, built in the early 1950s, is a one-story building with similarities to 1950s ranch houses and 1930s bungalows. It has weatherboard siding and is built on concrete piers. The property also includes a 1906-built \\"mill house\\" built by the Great Southern Lumber Company when it developed the company town of Bogalusa from the ground up in 1906-1907. History Hicks was a co-founder and leader of the local chapter of the Deacons for Defense and Justice, founded in February 1965 and affiliated with the original group founded in Jonesboro, Louisiana. They organized men for armed self-defense in order to protect civil rights activists and their families, under attack in those years by the Ku Klux Klan. He was also a leader of the Bogalusa Civic and Voters League (BCVL), which was seeking to register black voters. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. It was deemed significant for its role in the Civil Rights Movement in Bogalusa and for its association with leader Robert Hicks. The house served as the headquarters for the executive board of the BCVL, and for the Deacons for Defense and Justice. On February 1, 1965, the house was threatened with bombing by whites seeking to intimidate the activists of the BCVL. On February 21, 1965, Hicks and others founded the local chapter of the Deacons for Defense and Justice to protect activists and their families. On May 17, 1965, Hicks participated in an attempt by blacks to use one of Bogalusa's public parks. Despite passage the previous year of the national Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibiting segregation of public facilities, local whites continued to exclude blacks from parks and other places. Confrontations continued through the summer and in July 1965, the federal government used Reconstruction-era law to order the local police to protect the civil rights activists. A historic plaque was erected at the house site. The Robert Hicks Foundation is supporting work for a civil rights museum at the site.

The science behind determining a safe concentration to the environment is imperfect, statistically limited, and resource intensive. There is an unfilled demand for the rapid assessment of different chemical toxicity to many different organisms. The ACR is a proposed solution to this demand. While empirical methods are crucial to making scientific conclusions and informed decisions, best personal judgement is often the best tool to the regulator in allowing or prohibiting potentially toxic chemicals from entering the environment. This means taking into consideration information about chemical structure, physical and chemical properties including fate and transport in the environment, and most importantly toxicological data. The ACR is mathematically the inverse of the application factor (AF), which was first proposed by Mount and Stephan (1967). It provides no new information, it simply converts AF values into whole integer numbers that are more easily comparable for researchers visually. Calculation The ACR is the inverse of the application factor (AF). This makes it easier for regulators to visualize data as whole numbers rather than decimals. The AF is calculated by dividing the Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration (MATC) by the Lethal Concentration that kills 50% of test organisms in an acute toxicity test (LC50). MATC = \\\\sqrt{(NOEC)(LOEC)} The Maximum Allowable Toxicity Concentration (MATC is determined by taking the square root of the No Effects Concentration (NOEC) multiplied by the Low effect concentration (LOEC). AF = MATC/LC50 The Application Factor (AF) is determined by dividing the MATC by the LC50 ACR = 1/AF or LC50/MATC The ACR is then the inverse of the AF. Regulatory use There are thousands of new and different chemicals that are designed and synthesized by private chemical manufacturers every year. The public demands that all of these chemicals go through testing and be approved for use by the EPA under the TSCA. Part of that testing requirement is determining the toxicity of chemicals to organisms in the environment. =Law= Section 5 of the TSCA states that the EPA must respond to pre-manufacturing notices (PMN) 90 ‚Äì180 days after submission by the manufacturer. The EPA is responsible for identifying the substance, its proposed use, amount made, byproducts, exposure levels, and all existing environmental and health data necessary to prevent significant harm to the environment. Additionally there are no PMN test requirements so there is often a minimal amount of data presented. This may be discussed as a fault of the TSCA. New chemical PMNs are submitted early in the chemical‚Äôs development so they rarely contain information about chronic toxicity - yet the EPA must respond within the 90-180 day time period after submission of the PMN. This essentially puts a huge burden on the EPA because chemical effects to the environment are extremely hard to predict simply based on single species toxicity tests (SST). The limited time period that the TSCA gives the EPA for making this decision requires the EPA to make decisions with a high amount of uncertainty. This ultimately makes the goal of protecting the environment from significant adverse effects difficult. The results of acute and chronic toxicity testing form the basis of knowledge that regulators draw from in performing work related to ecological risk assessment and designing policy that defines how much of a chemical of interest should be allowed in certain environments. While this sounds simple enough to the layperson, it is extremely difficult in practice due to a large number of modifying factors inextricably tied to toxicity tests and statistical analysis. Different toxic effects can be observed from the same chemical through different types of environmental exposures and parameters, and thus toxicity results from acute and chronic tests must be jointly considered in decision making. Additionally, chronic toxicity tests tend to require significantly more attention and resources than acute tests which makes them much less feasible for basing decisions off of in a timely manner. The need for development of more advanced statistical methods, and uniformity in using these methods by regulators has been made apparent in literature. Scientific methods for determining acute and chronic toxicity to organisms are inherently imperfect and non-uniform throughout the field of research, and the most useful tool for decision making by officials is more often than not best personal judgement. A popular new method for ecological risk assessment is the acute to chronic estimation (ACE). This method uses computer software to estimate chronic toxicity, which provides similar information with much less effort and expense to the researcher. Limitations The ACR is derived from data generated by SSTs, as so falls victim to the same errors and limitations. These limitations are described in detail in literature Cairns, J. Environ Monit Assess (1984) 4: 259. doi:10.1007/BF00394145 Using point estimates such as NOECs/LOECs reduces a data set containing many values down to an isometric, removing the rich visual information that allows the researcher to assess the reliability and variability in the data. Information such as the slope of the dose-response curve, from which NOECs are LOECs are derived, is lost. However, without NOECs and LOECs regulatory decisions are much harder to make. While ACR has drawbacks due to the uncertainty of the point estimates it uses to define it, it is still widely valued as a regulatory tool in making environmental assessments and policy decisions. ACRs are based on tests with a number of different methodologies, which means that there can be significant variance among ACRs.

Due to its location by the Tampere‚ÄìHaapam√§ki railway, Vilppula was a gateway to the White controlled Central Finland. The Reds were aiming to Haapam√§ki, 25 kilometres north of Vilppula, which was a vital junction of the east-west railways connecting the regions of Ostrobothnia, H√§me and Karelia. From Haapam√§ki, the Reds would be able to reach the White stronghold in Southern Ostrobothnia, including their capital Vaasa. However, the attack along the railway was stopped at the beginning of February. The Reds now turned their attention to the village of V√§√§rinmaja in order to reach Vilppula from southwest by the road connecting Ruovesi and Vilppula. This offensive also failed, and finally on 15 March, the Whites launched their own offensive and the Reds retreated south to defend the city of Tampere.  Battle in Vilppula  = The first clashes = The first clash in Vilppula occurred on 31 January, as 200 Reds attacked the industrial community of M√§ntt√§ which was held by the local White Guard. The conflict was solved with the help of the village priest, and both sides were disarmed. On the next day, the White Guard from nearby Keuruu entered the scene, and the Reds were forced to retreat to the railway station of Lyly, about 15 kilometers south of Vilppula. Later the same day, a White unit led by the prominent warlord Matti Laurila, later killed in the Battle of L√§nkipohja, advanced towards Lyly, but was stopped by a demolished railway bridge. By chance, a train carrying the staff of the Romanian embassy evacuated from Saint Petersburg arrived to the other side of the bridge and the Whites were able to continue by commandeering their train. Finally, the Whites had to turn back before reaching Lyly, as the Reds had broken the railway in several places. The Whites now settled to the Vilppula railway station, while the Reds gathered their troops in Lyly. The Russians got involved with the events as the Whites had captured more than two thousand Russian soldiers who had surrendered their weapons. Mikhail Svechnikov, the commander of the Russian 106th division in Tampere, was forced to take action against the Whites as the captured were under his command. Svechnikov sent a group of 500 volunteers to fight with the Reds. This unit was led by the second lieutenant G. A. Stolbov, but the Russians were soon sent to the Battle of Kuru, which was fought 40 kilometres west of Vilppula. = Red offensive = The Reds launched their first offensive against Vilppula on 2 February with the support of Russian troops and an armoured train. The Whites had built a defensive line behind the two bridges crossing the river Vilppulankoski. During the next five days, the Reds attacked several times, but all efforts failed. As they got reinforcements from the Helsinki Red Guard and the Saint Petersburg Finnish Red Guard, three more attacks were made in the next two weeks, but the Reds could not break through. On 21 February, the Red general offensive was launched, but the Vilppula Reds did not join the attack as the White artillery had stopped their armoured train. Fighting settled down, both sides now focused in firing each other with artillery. On 13 March, the Reds performed a peculiar operation as they loaded a train full of explosives and sent it towards the Vilppula station. The ghost train ran over the roadblocks and finally stopped at the rail yard, where the Whites managed to make the overpressured locomotive harmless and prevent the explosion. = Evacuation of the British embassy = In the beginning of March, a train carrying the personnel of the British embassy in Saint Petersburg arrived in Tampere. The British had left Russia in the aftermath of the October Revolution and were now heading back home through Finland and Sweden. The Finnish-American Reds, August Wesley and Verner Lehtim√§ki, negotiated with the British and the Reds agreed to let them cross the front line in Vilppula. When the British convoy reached the White lines, they were greeted with gunfire as the Whites did not notice the white flag against the snowy background and assumed the Union Jack was some kind of socialist banner. Eventually, crossing the front line succeeded and the British returned safely home. The Red cavalry commander Verner Lehtim√§ki at the Lyly train station  Battle in V√§√§rinmaja  As the Reds were not able to reach Vilppula by the northbound railway, they decided to attack from southwest along the road connecting Ruovesi and Vilppula. The Reds now had to break through the White lines in the village of V√§√§rinmaja, located 13 kilometres southwest of Vilppula. The Reds gathered their troops of 1,000 men to the village of Hyyryl√§, about 4 kilometres south of V√§√§rinmaja. The troops commanded by Mikko Kokko included elite units like the Helsinki Red Guard A-company and the Porttu Battalion, which was composed of the workers of the Katajanokka naval shipyard in Helsinki. The Reds also had a 100 men cavalry unit from Turku, under the command of the revolutionary brothers Verner and Jalmar Lehtim√§ki. The Whites in turn had 600 men in V√§√§rinmaja, commanded by the lieutenant Carl Nordensvan and the volunteer Swedish captain Martin Ekstr√∂m. The Reds launched their first attack on 21 February by pounding V√§√§rinmaja and the nearby villages of Sepp√§l√§ and Enoranta with artillery fire. They took Enoranta, but three days later, the Whites launched a counterattack and took the village back. The second attack was made on 10 March, but also this one failed. The final attempt on 13 March was again preceded by heavy artillery fire, but V√§√§rinmaja remained in White control. Two days later, the Whites launched a major offensive against Tampere. and the Red front collapsed in just a couple of days. The Reds left Vilppula area on 18 March and joined the Battle of Tampere. The total casualties in V√§√§rinmaja were 23 killed Whites and at least 50 killed Reds.

She was a collection manager of Hymenoptera at the Australian National Insect Collection. Career Prior to working for CSIRO, her Master of Science thesis at University of Queensland focused on The biology of amegilla friese (hymenoptera, apoidea). Her thesis focused on describing the females of Amegilla (Amegilla) pulchra (Smith) at nesting sites in Brisbane, Queensland. It also discusses four parasites from A. pulchra cells, and the behaviour of females of Amegilla (Asarapoda) sp. at a nesting site in Brisbane. During her work at CSIRO, she took part in the pre-wet survey for insects which may indicate environmental pollution at McArthur River, Northern Territory (October‚ÄìNovember 1975). The survey was contracted by Mimets Development Pty.Ltd., a subsidiary of Mt Isa Mines. The resulting \\"Report on a survey of the Insects of the McArthur River Area, NT\\" recommended insect populations for monitoring effects of water pollution. Cardale was also part of an intensive collecting trip to the Iron Range area of Cape York, Queensland (June‚ÄìJuly 1986), which garnered 50,000 specimens (Upton, p. 240). She was also in the team which recorded some insects in Australia for the first time during a trip to Kununurra (Mitchell Plateau, Western Australia, May 1983) (Upton, pp. 243‚Äì4). She was credited with working with Dr John Lawrence in collecting most of the specimens of Psocoptera from Christmas Island, Indian Ocean.

Personal life and education  Occhipinti grew up in Sicily and became fascinated with wine in her teens. Her uncle is Giusto Occhipinti, a Sicilian winemaker of the COS estate who has been making wine since 1980. When Arianna was 16, she accompanied her uncle to VinItaly (the annual wine expo in Verona) and was very inspired by the wine culture and people. She attended the University of Milan's school of viticulture and enology at a young age, and released her first vintage at age 22. She started growing wine in the Contrada Fossa di Lupo, and has since expanded to the Bombolieri, Pettineo and Bastonaca districts.  Career  Occhipinti has farmed all of her land Biodynamically since 2009. She started with one hectare of vines, and had 10 hectares as of 2014. Her SP68 Rosso, is a blend of two varieties native to this part of Sicily: Frappato and Nero d‚ÄôAvola. The title \\"SP68\\" refers to the Strada Provinciale 68, a state route that passes by Arianna‚Äôs rural property. Occhipinti introduces very little, if any, sulfur in the wine, uses no filtration, and follows an extremely simple vinification process: wild fermentations from native airborne yeasts, 30 days maceration on skins, six months of aging in cement tanks, and a final rest in bottle before release. Occhipinti is fluent in English, which has helped with U.S. distribution and press.

NHL career In April 2008, Warren was fired by the NHL for what the league said was \\"substandard performance\\". Warren had not worked in the playoffs after the 2006 season, which gave the league the right to release him from his contract through the union's collective bargaining agreement. He claimed that when he became the Vice-President of the NHL Officials Association in 2006, he noticed \\"league bias against him\\". A year before his termination, e-mails were sent during an exchange between Stephen Walkom and Colin Campbell; the e-mails were sent after a 24 February 2007 game between the Florida Panthers and Boston Bruins. Campbell suggested that \\"there must be a way to get rid of this guy\\". The move came as a surprise to some of the members of the NHLOA; linesman Brian Murphy said that he was \\"surprised that any official could fall that far that fast\\". Other officials critiqued Warren post-firing, with referee Paul Devorski calling him \\"horse shit\\". In 2009, one year after his release from the league, Warren went to the Ontario Labour Relations Board in an attempt to be re-hired. While the Board ruled against his request, the Ontario Superior Court stepped in when it came to severance pay. The Court said that the NHL had to pay Warren his severance, even though the OLRB said too much time passed after he was released. In an April 2016 letter to Warren's lawyer, the NHL said they would take the case to the Supreme Court.

Bearer is an American neuroscientist, pathologist and composer. Education Bearer received her Bachelor's of Music from The Manhattan School of Music in Theory, June 1970. She received the Masters of Art from New York University, where her thesis was Structural Innovation in the String Quartets of Haydn. She received the combined MD-PhD degree from University of California San Francisco (UCSF). Prior to studies at The Manhattan School, Bearer was a pupil of Nadia Boulanger, first at the Ecole Americaine des Beau Arts in Fontainebleau and continuing in Boulanger's home on Rus Ballu in Paris. Career After a one-year post-doctoral fellowship with Lelio Orci in Geneva, Bearer returned to UCSF for residency and fellowship training‚Äîclinically in Pathology and Medical Genetics with Charlie Epstein, and scientifically in Biochemistry and Biophysics with Bruce Alberts. She was recruited to a tenure track position at Brown University in 1991 and rose in the ranks to full professorship. In 2009 University of New Mexico recruited her to an endowed tenured professorship and as Vice Chair for Research. =Scientific contributions= Bearer's early scientific contributions include the first ultrastructural imaging of lipid rafts in cell membranes that mediate cell signaling (Bearer and Friend, J. Cell Biol., 1982); the first ultrastructural imaging of endothelial fenestral diaphragms that allow transport of solutes between blood and tissue (Bearer and Orci, J. Cell Biol., 1985), and the first biochemical discovery of Arp2 and 2E4/kaptin, proteins that regulate actin dynamics in platelets, (Bearer and Abraham, 1999; Bearer et al. Ann. of Hum. Genet, 2000). Recent contributions since 2007 include imaging of the brain in living mouse models of human neuropsychological disorders, such as Down syndrome (Bearer et al. 2007), Alzheimer's disease (Gallagher et al. 2012), viral infections of the brain (Cheng et al. 2012), drugs of abuse (Bearer et al. 2009, Zhang et al. 2010; Gallagher et al. 2013), and she is currently working on the functional anatomy and epigenetic mechanisms of changes in the brain associated with PTSD and early life adversity. These more recent contributions were made using magnetic resonance imaging coupled with transgenic mouse models, biochemistry, and optical microscopy. Bearer is currently (2009‚Äìpresent) the Harvey Family Professor in Pathology at University of New Mexico, a visiting professor at California Institute of Technology, and an Elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. =Research details= Bearer's research began with studies of membrane dynamics involved in synaptic transmitter release. She developed imaging labels for anionic lipids and made the earliest observations of membrane lipid rafts. and the protein biochemistry of actin modulators During this investigation, she identified proteins that drive filament formation and mapped one, kaptin/2E4, on human chromosome 19. This work revealed that mutations in the promoter region of kaptin/2E4 lead to inherited deafness. Using herpes simplex virus (HSV) as a tool and the squid giant axon as a model, her lab then discovered that amyloid precursor protein (AAP), whose proteolytic product Abeta is the major component of Alzheimer‚Äôs plaques, recruited cytoskeletal motors to cargo for transport within axons. Live video recording of green-labeled HSV and red-labeled APP and high resolution immunogold electronmicroscopy demonstrated that intracellular HSV viral particles interact with cellular APP. Her work on HSV has been targeted towards understanding the HSV-APP connections. In 2004, Bearer began developing magnetic resonance imaging with Russ Jacobs, John D. Roberts, and Scott Fraser for live imaging of circuitry in mouse models of human neurological and psychiatric disorders. Bearer and Jacobs developed manganese- enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) of neural connections and brain activity in transgenic mouse models of human disorders. Music Bearer is a composer, who has had performances annually of new compositions. While at Brown University from 1991‚Äì2009, she was a professor in both Biology and Medicine and in Music, and sheholds a secondary appointment in the Music Department at University of New Mexico. Her piano concerto, Ode to the White Crown Sparrow, was premiered by Tyler Lincoln and the Symphony of the Redwoods; Ah-tosh-mit Overture for orchestra was commissioned for the 125th anniversary of University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and performed by the UCSF Symphony under the baton of Jonathan Davis; the Magdalene Passion, an hour-long oratorio for five soloists, chorus, organ and chamber orchestra, was commissioned by the Providence Singers and premiered by Julian Wachner, conductor; Ultrasonic, a symphonic tone poem, was commissioned and performed by St Mathew's Music Guild in Pacific Palisades under the direction of Tom Neenan and multiple choral works with various instrumental accompaniments have been performed by the Pasadena Promusica led by Stephen Grimm. In March 2018, Pasadena Promusica premiered Bearer's L'alma rapita for chorus and string quartet inspired by Carlo Gesualdo, the 16-17th century madrigalist. Bearer's piece for solo flute with interactive video projections, Density silver water, was performed as part of the John Donald Robb Composer's Showcase in New Mexico by Jesse Tatum with video projections by John B Carpenter in March 2018; and The Replication Machine, for viola-clarinet duo with readings and audience participation was presented to Bruce M.

Early life Pottinger is the son of author and former Department of Justice official J. Stanley Pottinger. He was educated at Milton Academy and is a schoolmate and childhood friend of fellow journalist John Avlon. Pottinger graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with an undergraduate degree in Chinese studies; he is fluent in Mandarin. Journalistic career Before he joined the United States Marine Corps, Pottinger worked as a journalist for Reuters between 1998 and 2001. Then he moved to The Wall Street Journal until his retirement from journalism in 2005. For four years, he was a regular guest on the John Batchelor Show radio program. His stories won awards from the Society of Publishers in Asia and were nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. He covered a variety of topics, including the SARS epidemic and the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami; in the latter assignment, he met United States Marines and was inspired by their courage. He spent seven years reporting in China. Military career Pottinger's career switch was motivated by his experience in China and the Iraq War. By 2004, Pottinger had \\"sort of a sense of unease that China was not really going to converge with the more liberal order.\\" He believed that when it was powerful enough, China would \\"influence the world on its own terms, on the terms of the ruling party.\\" As he watched all the first phase of Iraq War unfold from a distant location in China, he was a bit troubled that \\"as a nation, the administration, the Congress and to a great extent the press as well had misjudged the nature of conflict.\\" China's rise and the Iraq War had made him realize that democracy is \\"not inevitable and it shouldn't be taken for granted but it is a form of government very much worth fighting for.\\" In September 2005, Pottinger joined the Marine Corps and served as a military intelligence officer. He was over-aged and out of shape when he joined. To meet the physical qualifications, he worked out with a Marine officer who was living in Beijing. He served three deployments: one in Iraq from April to November 2007, and two in Afghanistan from November 2008 to May 2009 and July 2009 to May 2010. On his second tour in Afghanistan, he met U.S. Army General Michael T. Flynn, with whom he co-wrote a report. The report, published in January 2010 through the Center for a New American Security, was titled Fixing Intel: A Blueprint for Making Intelligence Relevant in Afghanistan. After he left active service, Pottinger worked in New York City, including for the hedge fund Davidson Kempner Capital Management. Political career A 2018 Politico profile described Pottinger as \\"a fairly typical conservative internationalist\\" who \\"has never been a Trump-style #MAGA conservative\\" and who donated to both Democrats and Republicans. In 2017, he was hired as a member of the U.S. National Security Council of the administration of Donald Trump. Michael Flynn, whom Pottinger had worked for in the military, made him the NSC's Asia director, and he remained in his position under H. R. McMaster and John R. Bolton. In 2018, after a proposed summit with North Korea had been cancelled, The New York Times reported that \\"a senior White House official told reporters that even if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on June 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed.\\" The President subsequently alleged that the New York Times had made up the existence of the unnamed White House official; on Twitter, journalist Yashar Ali later posted audio of Pottinger giving the officially organized background briefing cited by the Times, in which, without actually using the word \\"impossible\\", he responded to a reporter's question about the feasibility of the originally scheduled date by saying \\"We've lost quite a bit of time that we would need\\" and \\"June 12th is in ten minutes.\\" In his NSC position, Pottinger advocated a tough stance on China that combined trade policy with national security. In September 2019, newly installed National Security Advisor Robert C. O'Brien named Pottinger Deputy National Security Advisor. In May 2020, he gave a speech in Mandarin Chinese regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. During a virtual conversation hosted by Reagan Foundation on September 30, 2020, Pottinger was asked about the national security implication of Chinese students in the United States. In response, he said \\"the great majority are people that we're glad to have here and many will stay here and start great businesses.\\" He said it is that one percent of Chinese students that are under contract and have an obligation to bring back everything they know to serve the state back in China. Personal life Pottinger is married to Dr. Yen Pottinger and has two children.

Early life Born in Honeoye Falls, New York, son of Irish immigrants Edmund Barry, shoemaker and of Bridgett, n√©e Brophy. In 1861, his family moved west to Otsego, Wisconsin and the following year to nearby Columbus. While growing up in Columbus, Wisconsin David F. Barry landed odd jobs assisting an itinerant photographer named Orlando Scott Goff who had maintained a small gallery in that city. Career In 1871, Orlando Scott Goff moved to Yankton, Dakota Territory opening up the first photographer's studio in that settlement and two years later relocated to Bismarck. Goff sent for Barry to join him in 1878, his former young helper, taking him under his wings as an apprentice to assist him at his new Bismarck gallery. Over time their friendship grew to prompt Goff to make Barry his business partner. Between 1878 and 1883, utilizing a portable photographic studio, Barry traveled throughout the Plains, to Fort Buford and Fort Yates in the Dakotas and Fort Assiniboine in Montana taking photographs as he went. Having taken over Goff's business interests he eventually set up his own studio at Fort Yates and later in Bismarck. Barry made his name photographing Lakota people notables such as Sitting Bull, Rain-in-the-Face, Gall (Phizi), John Grass and others. The Lakota people would nickname him ‚ÄúLittle Shadow Catcher‚Äù. Barry returned in 1890 to Wisconsin where he operated a successful gallery in the city of Superior until his death in 1934. Personal life Barry was married in Chicago on March 27, 1884 to Margaret ‚ÄúPatty‚Äù Young of Quincy, Illinois. The marriage remained childless. She died on August 20, 1932. The following year, in 1933 Barry sustained a serious leg injury while stepping off a street car in Duluth, Minnesota from which he would never entirely recover. He died on his 80th birthday at his Superior, Wisconsin home on March 6, 1934.

The description of the Dark Lady distinguishes itself from the Fair Youth sequence by being overtly sexual. Among these, Sonnet 151 has been characterised as \\"bawdy\\" and is used to illustrate the difference between the spiritual love for the Fair Youth and the sexual love for the Dark Lady. The distinction is commonly made in the introduction to modern editions of the sonnets. As with the Fair Youth sequence, there have been many attempts to identify her with a real historical individual. A widely held scholarly opinion, however, is that the \\"dark lady\\" is nothing more than a construct of Shakespeare's imagination and art, and any attempt to identify her with a real person is \\"pointless\\". Speculation about the Dark Lady The question of the true identity of the Dark Lady is an unsolved, controversial issue because of the insufficiency of historical detail. Some believe that she might be of Mediterranean descent with dark hair and dark eyes of Greece, Spain, Italy and Southern France. Other scholars have suggested, given Shakespeare's description of her dark, dun-colored skin and black wiry hair, that the Dark Lady might have been a woman of African descent. Ultimately, \\"none of the many attempts at identifying the dark lady‚Ä¶are finally convincing\\". =Emilia Lanier= In 1973 A. L. Rowse claimed to have solved the identity of the Dark Lady in his book Shakespeare's Sonnets‚Äîthe Problem Solved, based upon his study of astrologer Simon Forman's journal entries describing his meetings with Emilia Lanier. It was later shown that Rowse had based his identification on a misreading of Forman's text: Forman had described Lanier as \\"brave in youth\\", not \\"brown in youth\\", but Rowse, while later correcting his misreading, continued to defend his argument. In the diaries, Emilia is described as the mistress of Lord Hunsdon, the Queen's Lord Chamberlain. She seemed to have similar qualities to ones of the Dark Lady. For example, Emilia was so attractive to men that during the years of being Hunsdon's mistress, she may have been viewed as a prostitute. She might have been a musician because she was a member of the Bassano family which was famous for providing the music to entertain the Courts of Elizabeth I and James I. They were Italians and Emilia may have been of Mediterranean descent. However there are academics, such as David Bevington of the University of Chicago, who refuse to acknowledge the theory that Lanier was the Dark Lady not only due to the lack of any direct proof but also because the claimed association with Shakespeare tends to overshadow her own literary achievements: she published her celebrated collection of poems Salve Deus Rex Jud√¶orum in 1611. =Black Luce= G. B. Harrison, writing in 1933, notes that a Clerkenwell brothel-owner known as \\"Black Luce\\" had participated in the 1601‚Äì1602 Christmas revels at Gray's Inn (under the Latinized stage-name \\"Lucy Negro\\") and that she could there have encountered Shakespeare, as this was the occasion of the first performance of Twelfth Night. Harrison \\"tentatively\\" proposes Black Luce as the Dark Lady. Two Clerkenwell brothel-keepers carried the nickname of \\"Black Luce\\"‚ÄîLucy Baynham and Lucy Morgan‚Äîbut there is no evidence that either was of African descent. Duncan Salkeld, a Shakespearean scholar from the University of Chichester, while acknowledging that \\"[t]he records do not link her directly with Shakespeare\\", established that Luce had multiple connections to London's theatrical scene. =Wife of John Florio= Jonathan Bate in his The Genius of Shakespeare (2008) considers the case for both Lanier and Luce, before suggesting his own \\"pleasing fancy\\" that the unnamed, \\"low-born\\" but \\"witty and talented\\" wife of Italian linguist John Florio (and sister of poet Samuel Daniel) was the Dark Lady, the lover of not only Shakespeare but also of Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, who was at the time the patron of both the linguist and the playwright. Bate acknowledges the possibility that the sonnets may be no more than Shakespeare's \\"knowing imaginings\\", rather than allusions to actual events. Aubrey Burl, a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and commentator on prehistoric monuments, takes up the case that the Dark Lady is the wife of John Florio, whom he names as \\"Aline Florio\\". He arrives at his theory from a play-on-words he invented: the name of the dark-haired character Rosaline in Love's Labours Lost being suggested to Shakespeare by combining \\"rose\\" from the earl's family name of \\"Wriothesley\\" and \\"Aline\\" from a popular contemporary given name. Burl lists eight possible contenders for the Dark Lady's true identity, and finally asserts that Florio's wife is the real one, using some clues which were mentioned in Shakespeare's work: she was dark- haired, self-centred, and enjoyed sex. According to him, Mrs. Florio loved \\"for her own gratification\\", indulged in \\"temptation and callously self- satisfied betrayal of her husband\\", which coincides with features of the Dark Lady. He also suggests that the fact that she was born of low degree in Somerset explains the darkness of her complexion. Burl reasons that Florio probably first met Shakespeare at Titchfield, the Wriothesley family seat in Hampshire, and met him again in London at Florio's home. Saul Frampton of the University of Westminster identifies Samuel Daniel's birthplace as Wilton, near Marlborough, Wiltshire, citing William Slatyer's The history of Great Britain (1621), with the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography also recording a connection between the Daniel family and Marlborough. Frampton notes that the baptismal records of the parish contain an entry for one \\"Avisa Danyell\\" (dated 8 February 1556) and from this he deduces that this was Samuel's sister and therefore John Florio's wife. Thus, Avisa Florio was the Dark Lady. The speculations that Florio‚Äôs wife, of whatever baptismal name and relationship with Shakespeare, was Daniel's sister may be based on an original, incorrect interpretation. This was first made by Anthony √† Wood (offering no authority) in his Athen√¶ Oxonienses of 1691. There is no documentary evidence to support this: rather, √† Wood arrived at his conclusion from a passage of text where Daniel names Florio as his \\"brother\\" in introductory material to the latter‚Äôs famous translation of Michel de Montaigne‚Äôs Essays. If this were referring (in today‚Äôs terms) to his \\"brother- in-law\\" this could, therefore, have been the marriage of either man‚Äôs sister to the other. Furthermore, in the prevalent usage of the time (ignored by √† Wood), this may simply signify that they were both members of the same \\"brotherhood\\": in this instance, both men were Grooms of the privy chamber (an honorary and not a functional office) and not related by marriage at all. =Mary Fitton= Based upon the recurring theme in the early sonnets of two men vying for a lady's affection, often assumed to be Shakespeare and William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, Herbert's mistress Mary Fitton has accordingly been proposed as the \\"Dark Lady\\". The first to make this suggestion was Thomas Tyler in the preface to his 1890 facsimile edition of the Sonnets but later commentators have assessed the depiction of the rivalry as a \\"fictitious situation\\" presented for poetic effect. When a portrait of Fitton, showing her to have fair complexion, brown hair and grey eyes, was discovered in 1897 the identification fell from favour. It was Fitton whom George Bernard Shaw had in mind when writing his play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets (below). =Jacqueline Field= Field was the French-born wife of Shakespeare's friend and publisher Richard Field. The \\"not impeccable\\" reasoning provided by Charlotte Carmichael Stopes, a lecturer in literary history, to justify the claim does not form a strong case, comprising little more than: ‚Äúas a Frenchwoman‚Ä¶she would have had dark eyes, a sallow complexion and that indefinable charm\\", so matching the character in the sonnets. =Jennet Davenant= Originally arising from nothing more than the poet William Davenant boast that he was the illegitimate son of Shakespeare, Jennet (or Jane) Davenant, the wife of a tavern-keeper on the route between London and Stratford, has been proposed as the Dark Lady.  In popular culture  George Bernard Shaw's short play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets (1910) was written in support of a campaign for a national theatre in Britain; Shakespeare encounters Queen Elizabeth while attempting an assignation with the Dark Lady and commends the project to her. In the Doctor Who series 3 episode \\"The Shakespeare Code\\", set in 1599, Shakespeare becomes infatuated with the Tenth Doctor's new companion Martha Jones, a Black British woman. At the end of the episode, after deducing that she is from the future, he calls her his \\"dark lady\\" and recites Sonnet 18 for her.

As oligomeric or polymeric species of rotaxanes, polyrotaxanes are also capable of converting energy input to molecular movements because the ring motions can be controlled by external stimulus. Polyrotaxanes have attracted much attention for decades, because they can help build functional molecular machines with complicated molecular structure. Although there are no covalent bonds between the axes and rings, polyrotaxanes are stable due to the high free activation energy (Gibbs energy) needed to be overcome to withdraw rings from the axes. Also, rings are capable of shuttling along and rotating around the axes freely, which leads to a huge amount of internal degree of freedom of polyrotaxanes. Due to this topologically interlocked structure, polyrotaxanes have many different mechanical, electrical, and optical properties compared to conventional polymers. Additionally the mechanically interlocked structures can be maintained in slide-ring materials, which are a type supramolecular network synthesized by crosslinking the rings (called figure-of-eight crosslinking) in different polyrotaxanes. In slide-ring materials, crosslinks of rings can pass along the axes freely to equalize the tension of the threading polymer networks, which is similar to pulleys. With this specific structure, slide- ring materials can be fabricated highly stretchable engineering materials due to their different mechanical properties. If the rings and axes are biodegradable and biocompatible, the polyrotaxanes can also be used for biomedical application, such as gene/drug delivery. The advantage of polyrotaxanes over other biomedical polymers, such as polysaccharides, is that because the interlocked structures are maintained by bulky stoppers at the ends of the strings, if the bulky stoppers are removed, such as removed by a chemical stimulus, rings dethread from the axes. The drastic structural change can be used for programmed drug or gene delivery, in which the drug or gene can be released with the rings when the stoppers are cut off at the specific destination. thumb  Types of polyrotaxanes  According to the location of the rotaxanes units, polyrotaxanes can be mainly divided into two types: main chain polyrotaxanes, in which the rotaxane units locate on the main chain (axis), and side chain polyrotaxanes, in which the rotaxane units are located on the side chain. Corresponding polypseudorotaxanes can also be divided based on the same principle: main chain polypseudorotaxnes or side chain polypseudorotaxanes, in which there is no stopper at the ends. In both main chain polyrotaxanes or side chain polyrotaxanes, the unique feature from other polymers is the potential for different motion of the ring unit relative to the string units. Because the shape and location of the assembly are capable of showing different responses to changes in temperature, pH or other environment conditions, polyrotaxanes have many distinctive properties. = Main chain polyrotaxanes = Main chain polyrotaxanes are formed by host‚Äìguest interactions of polymer backbones (main chain) with cyclic molecules that are interlocked by bulky stoppers. There are five major synthesis routes for main chain polyrotaxanes. (1) Cyclization in the presence of main chain. Synthesis routes to main chain polyrotaxanes This synthesis route requires high dilution conditions of cyclization reactions. However, to most cases, it is difficult to sustain the high dilution conditions for rotaxane formation. Other possible methods to solve this problem are template cyclizations, such as cyclization based on metal chelation, change-transfer complexation or inclusion complexes. (2) Polymerization of monomeric rotaxanes units. Through polymerizing stable rotaxane monomers, polyrotaxanes are obtained. This method requires that the monomeric rotaxane units are stable in the solvent and have active groups that can be polymerized, which means the rings will not dethread from the main chain. (3) Chemical conversion. Specially designed linear polymers are required in this method. Designed monomers are polymerized to obtain special linear polymers with precursors of cyclic compounds. After bulky stoppers are modified onto two sides of polymer chains, the \\"temporary\\" chemical bonds in the precursors are cleaved to generate cyclic structure on the main chain, which becomes a polyrotaxane. The disadvantage of this method is the complex chemistry needed in the process of design and synthesis of the special linear polymers with precursors and the transitions to polyrotaxanes, e.g. the selective chemical bond cleavage. Many synthesis steps are required in this method. (4) Threading of preformed main chain molecules through preformed rings. The fourth approach is the simplest method to synthesize polyrotaxanes. Through mixing the main chain polymers and the rings in the solution, polyrotaxanes can be obtained after adding bulky stoppers to prevent the rings from dethreading from the chains. The number of rings on each chain depends on the threading equilibrium. Kinetic limitations due to the low concentration of chain ends and entropic effects also need further consideration. To overcome these obstacles, template threading (see below) is also a feasible alternative that can improve dynamically the number of threading rings by changing the equilibrium constant. (5) Production of linear macromolecule in the presence of preformed rings. Two general methods are included in this approach: the \\"statistical approach\\" and \\"template threading approach\\". In the \\"statistical approach\\", the interaction between rings and strings is weakly attractive or repulsive or even negligible. Through employing an excess of rings, the equilibrium for threading or dethreading is forced to the threading side before polymerization. Compared with synthesis route 1, rings are a major constituent of the system instead of the rotaxanes, so the high dilution conditions are not required for this methods. In \\"template threading approach\\", unlike the statistical approach, the interactions between rings and strings need to be attractive, such as metal chelations or charge transfer interactions which have been mentioned in the synthesis route 1. Because of this, the equilibrium is enthalpically driven, where the enthalpy is negative. In this method, high numbers of threading rings can be achieved, thus it is a useful way to stoichiometrically control the rings ratio of polyrotaxanes. 358x358px An example of the \\"statistical approach\\" is that a polyrotaxane was synthesized through polymerizing the rotaxane monomer that was assembled by oligomeric ethylene glycols (string) and crown ethers (ring) and naphthalene-1,5-di-isocyanate (stopper), which involves the threading equilibrium in the chain-ring system. Cyclodextrins have been extensively studied as host molecules (ring) in polyrotaxanes. The poly(ethylene glycol)s can assemble with Œ±-cyclodextrins to form a molecular necklace. Every two ethyleneoxy repeat units in poly(ethylene glycol)s can thread in one Œ±-cyclodextrin. The models confirm that the distance of form zig-zag structure of repeat units corresponds to the size of cavity in Œ±-cyclodextrins. This is a classical example of \\"template threadings\\" which also explains why poly(ethylene glycol)s are not able to form rotaxanes with Œ≤-cyclodextrin. 514x514px Crown ethers are another type of monomacrocyclic polymers that are used in synthesis of polyrotaxanes. The polyrotaxanes can be prepared by carrying out step-growth polymerizations in the presence of aliphatic crown ethers. In most of the cases, hydrogen bonding between the crown ethers and OH or NH/NHCO moieties are involved in the form of the assemblies. The threading efficiency will increase with the growth of sizes of the crown molecules. Additionally, stoppers will also greatly increase the threading efficiency. 631x631px Metal coordination also can be used to construct polyrotaxane structures. In this method, metal ions are employed as the synthesis templates to determine the coordinating sites of rotaxane structures. Conjugated polyrotaxanes can be synthesized through metal-template strategies followed by electropolymerization that ensures tuning of the electronic coupling between the ring cites and the conjugated backbone (string). = Side chain polyrotaxanes = Side chain polyrotaxanes are formed by host‚Äìguest interactions of polymer side chains with cyclic molecules that are interlocked by bulky stoppers. There are mainly three types of side chain polyrotaxanes: (1) Polyaxis/rotor: Comb-like polymers assembled with the cyclic molecules that are not interlocked on the side chain. (2) Polyrotor/axis: polymers possess cyclic molecules on the side chain, which assemble with guest molecules to form polypseudorotaxanes. Synthesis routes to side chain polyrotaxanes (3) Polyrotor/polyaxis: polymers possess covalently bonded cyclic molecule-moieties assembled with polymers possess guested in the side chain. Similar to the synthesis routes to main chain polyrotaxanes, there are mainly six approaches to side chain polyrotaxane. (1) Ring-threading of performed graft polymerCalder√≥n, Ver√≥nica, et al. \\"Synthesis and characterization of new aromatic polyamides bearing crown ethers or their dipodal counterparts in the pendant structure. II. Benzo‚Äê15‚Äêcrown‚Äê5 and ortho‚Äêbis [2‚Äê(2‚Äêethoxyethoxy) ethoxy] benzene.\\" Journal of Polymer Science Part A: Polymer Chemistry 44.13 (2006): 4063-4075. (2) Ring-grafting (3) Rotaxane-grafting (4) Polymerization of macromonomer with rings (5) Polymerization of rotaxane-monomer (6) Chemical conversion Similarly, the positions of chain and rings can be switched, which results in corresponding side-chain polyrotaxanes.  Properties  In a polyrotaxane, unlike a conventional polymer, the molecules are linked by mechanical bonding, such as hydrogen boding or change transfer, not covalent bonds. Also, the rings are capable of rotating on or shuttling around the axles, resulting in the large amount of freedom of polyrotaxanes. This unconventional combination of molecules leads to the distinctive properties of polyrotaxanes. = Stability and solubility = Due to the existence of stoppers on the ends of the rotaxanes units, polyrotaxanes are more thermodynamically stable than polypseudorotaxanes (similar structure to polyrotaxane but without stoppers at two ends). Also, if the interactions between guest and host molecules are attractive, such as hydrogen bonding or charge transfer, they have better stabilities than those without attractive interactions. However, specific salts, changes of pH condition or temperature that can disturb or interrupt the interactions between ring-ring, ring-backbone, or backbone-backbone will destroy the structural integrity of polyrotaxanes. For example, dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulfoxide is able to interrupt the hydrogen bonding between cyclodextrins in the cyclodextrin-based polyrotaxanes. Also, change of pH or high temperature can also destroy the crystalline domains. Some chemical bonds between stoppers and chains are not stable in acidic or basic solution. As the stoppers cut from the chain, the rings will dethread from the axles, which leads to the dissociation of the polyrotaxanes. For example, a \\"molecular necklace\\" assembled by Œ±-cyclodextrins and polyethylene glycol is insoluble in water and dimethylfomamide, although their parents' components Œ±-cyclodextrin and polyethylene glycol can be dissolved and this synthesis can happen in water. The product is soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide or 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution. This is because the hydrogen bonding between the cyclodextrins. As the hydrogen bonding is destroyed by dimethyl sulfoxide or base solution, it can be dissolved, but the water does not deform the hydrogen interaction between cyclodextrins. In addition, the complexation process is exothermic in thermodynamic tests, which is also corresponding with the existence of hydrogen bonding. = Photoelectronic properties = One of the properties of polytorotaxanes involves the photoelectronic response when introducing photoactive or electrionic-active units into the mechanically interlocked structures. For examples, the polyrotaxane structures are capable of enhancing the fluorescence quenching molecules that grafting on the rings and the other molecules at the ends. Amplification of a fluorescence chemosensory can be achieved by using polyrotaxane structure, which enhances the energy migration in the polymer. It was found that a rapid migration of the hole-electron pair to the rotaxanes sites is followed by a rapid combination which leads to the enhancement of the energy migration. In addition, the conductivity of these polyrotaxanes was lower than the parent components. Also conductive polyrotaxanes can be obtained by employing metal binding in the polyrotaxanes structure. For example, a polyrotaxane containing a conjugated backbone can be synthesized through metal template and electropolymerization. The metal ion binding is reversible when another metal with stronger binding ability is employed to remove the previous ion, which results in the \\"scaffolding effect reversibility\\". The free coordination sites and the organic matrix are able to be maintained by the labile scaffolding.  Potential application  = Molecular Machines = Many mechanically interlocked molecules have been studied to construct molecular machines. Because the molecules are linked by mechanical bonds instead of conventional covalent bonds, a component can move (shuttle) or rotate around the other parent component, which results in the large amount of freedom of mechanically interlocked molecules. Polyrotaxanes, as the polymer form of corresponding rotaxanes, are also applied in molecular machines. For example, the shuttling behavior of the molecular shuttle can be controlled by the solvent or temperature. Due to the hydrophobic interaction between rings and strings, and the repulsive interaction between rings and linkers, conditions that are capable of influencing these interactions can be used to control the mobility of the rings in the molecular shuttle. In addition, if cationic or anionic units are employed to form the polyrotaxanes, the salts or pH in the solution also will influence the charge interactions between rings and strings, which is an alternative method to control the ring motion of the molecular shuttle.Lin, Qianming, Xisen Hou, and Chenfeng Ke. \\"Ring Shuttling Controls Macroscopic Motion in a Three‚ÄêDimensional Printed Polyrotaxane Monolith.\\" Angewandte Chemie International Edition 56.16 (2017): 4452-4457. Poly[2]rotaxane \\"daisy chains\\" (like a string of daisies with stems linked to form a chain)is an example of a molecule that can be used to form a molecular muscle.Ashton, Peter R., et al. \\"Supramolecular daisy chains.\\" Angewandte Chemie International Edition 37.9 (1998): 1294-1297. Poly[2]rotaxane can expand or shrink in response to external stimulus, which is similar to behaviors of muscle, an ideal model to construct a \\"molecular muscle\\". The ring stations on the chain can be controlled by pH or light. Due to \\"daisy chain\\" structure, two rings on the daisy chain will shift from one station to another station, which changes the distance between two rings as well as the state of the whole daisy chain. When the rings come close, the whole size of the daisy chain will increase, which is the \\"expand\\" state. As the rings get to the further station, the molecule become the \\"shrink\\" state as the decreased size. = Slide-ring Materials = Extremely-stretchable- thermosensitive-hydrogels-by-introducing-slide-ring-polyrotaxane-cross- ncomms6124-s3 By chemically crosslinking the rings contained in the polyrotaxanes, sliding gels are obtained by being topologically interlocked by figure-of-eight crosslinks. Although it is a polymer network (gel), the rings are not fixed on the polyrotaxanes in the polymer network, the crosslinks of rings are able to freely move along the polymer chain. This can equalize the tension of the network, just like a pulley manner, which is referred to pulley effect. In chemical gels, the polymer chains are easy to be broken because the lengths of the heterogeneous polymer are limited or fixed. As a result, when the chemical gel is under a high pressure, the tension can not be equalized to the whole. On the opposite, the weakest part in the network will be broken easier, which leads to the damage of the gel. However, in the slide-ring materials, the polymer chain are able to pass through the figure-of-eight crosslinks which is like pulleys, and equalize the tension of network. As a result, slide-ring materials are applied to construct highly stretchable materials, up to 24 times its length when stretching and this process can be reversible. = Drug/gene delivery = Although polyrotaxanes are formed from components, their solubilities are different from the host or guest molecules. For examples, in the cyclodextrin-based polyrotaxanes, due to the hydrophilicity or high polarity of exterior structure of the cyclodextrins, some polyrotaxanes are able to be dissolved in water or other polar solvents though the guest molecules are hydrophobic or nonpolar. These water-soluble can be applied into drug or gene carriers. There are two main advantages for polyrotaxanes applied to drug/gene delivery:  Targeting  Because the mechanically interlocked structures are maintained by bulky stoppers at the ends of the strings, if the bulky stoppers are removed, such as removed by a chemical stimulus, rings dethread from the axes. The drastic structural change can be used for programmed drug or gene delivery, of which drug or gene can be released with the rings when the stoppers are cut off at the specific destination. For example, an enhanced gene delivery vehicle can be obtained by using a polyrotaxane formed by rings, backbones, then stoppers that linked by a disulfide bond (or other chemical bond that can be selected cleave in the body). The cation-functionalized polyrotaxanes can bind with pDNA to form complex through the electronstatic interaction. Glutathione (or other corresponding chemicals that can cleave the sensitive chemical bond) is over- expressed in the target cells. When the polyrotaxane/plasmid DNA (pDNA) complexes are uptaken by the target cells, intercellular glutathione could cleave the disulfide bond to cut off the stoppers at the end of polyrotaxanes, which results in the dissociation of the polyrotaxanes. As the rings dethread from the chain, pDNA is release with the ring molecules.  Long-term controlled release  Another advantage of poly(pseudo)rotaxanes is the ability for long-term release of drugs or genes. Some polyrotaxanes can used to form a physical hydrogel, which is called supramolecular hydrogel. In these cases, a three-dimensional physically crosslinked network formed by the poly(pseudo)rotaxanes, can be obtained, which is able to retain a large amount of water inside this network. If water-soluble drugs or genes are added in the solution, it could be capsulated in the supramolecular hydrogels. Also, functional units can be employed in the units of the poly(pseudo)rotaxanes, which enhances the interaction between the poly(pseudo)rotaxanes and capsulated drugs/genes and provides the carriers with other predetermined functions. As the network is further swollen in the water-based environment, part of the carrier will be dissolved gradually, so the capsulated drug or gene can be released from the hydrogels over a long period of time.

They competed in the c south section and made the Preliminary final losing to glen Waverley by 10 points. The following year the club had transferred to the Eastern Suburban Churches FA and debuted in 'E' Grade. In 1978 saw the first success for the young club as they won the 'D' grade premiership by 27 points defeating Chadstone Salesian. Automatically promoted to 'C' grade the following year they team again made the Grand Final only to be defeated by St Andrews Presbyterians by 12 points. As by association rules, both grand finalists get promoted, the Mountain Lions survived six seasons in 'B' grade before being relegated down to 'C' grade again. They were relegated again in 1990 to the lowest level of the ESCFA. In 1993 the Southern FL absorbed the Eastern Suburbs Churches Football Association. The newly merged league began with around 50 clubs playing 5 divisions, though this had dropped to 28 clubs in 3 divisions by 2002 due to clubs folding, merging, or moving to other competitions. In 2000 the club shortened its name by dropping 'Catholic' from its title. The 2014 SFL third division seniors grand final was called off after a brawl broke out between players and supporters. The game in which Mount Waverley was taking on Carrum Patterson Lakes. A police spokeswoman said supporters started heckling one of the teams as it left the ground at half-time. A fight broke out and one person was treated in hospital.

Despite independent reports by both the Victorian Police and AFL Victoria Integrity Unit Officer stating Mount Waverley FNC were not at fault, the Premiership was not awarded to either clubs. The talk & rumours is that the SFNL considered Carrum-Pattersons Lakes FC a priority club in a growth area that would be important to the further expansion of the SFNL. In 2016 The Mountain Lions had a very successful season, with both their Senior & Reserves Football Teams winning the premiership in undefeated seasons. Their Netball Team also won their Championship as well. Also, their Full-Forward James Gough, winning the league goal-kicking with 118 goals & Centre-half Forward Luke Galle coming 2nd in the league on 82 goals for the season. In 2019 the club went into recess due to personnel and financial issues.

In April 1934, workers noticed the presence of large fossil bones in the southeastern face of the quarry. A scapula was shown to foreman Koehret who notified the company engineers Verhas and Chardin. They advised director √âtienne Haerens to immediately excavate the marl lens containing the remains. Paleontologists Jean Piveteau and Raymond Ciry were asked to supervise this effort. The excavation started in May and was finished on 22 June 1934.Lapparent, A.-F. de, 1943, \\"Les dinosauriens jurassiques de Damparis (Jura)\\", M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© G√©ologique de France (Nouvelle S√©rie) 47: 1-20Dreyfuss M., 1934, \\"Sur une roche √† ossements de Sauriens\\", Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© d'Histoire Naturelle du Doubs 44: 52-54 The same year, baron Jean de Dorlodot published an article about the excavation process, considering most bones part of a single sauropod skeleton, washed into the sea by river flooding.Dorlodot J. de, 1934, \\"L'exploration du g√Æte √† dinosauriens jurassiques de Damparis\\", La Terre et la Vie 10: 563-586 The company donated the bones to the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle at Paris where preparator Pansard partly freed them from the rock matrix. In 1939, Albert-F√©lix de Lapparent began to study them in detail, benefiting from further preparation by Pansard. In 1943, de Lapparent published a description referring the sauropod bones to Bothriospondylus madagascariensis, a species based on fragmentary remains from Madagascar. Seven theropod teeth found among the bones he referred to Megalosaurus insignis. Humerus By the 1980s, a consensus had developed that the skeleton had little to do with Bothriospondylus madagascariensis. It was referred to as the \\"French Bothriospondylus\\" or the \\"Damparis sauropod\\". As it was one of the most complete sauropod finds in France and of a considerable age, it was deemed important enough to be named as a separate taxon. In 2017, Philip D. Mannion, Ronan Allain and Olivier Moine named and described the type species Vouivria damparisensis. The generic name is a latinisation of French la vouivre ‚Äî itself derived from Latin vipera, \\"adder\\" ‚Äî a winged dragon or wyvern from local legend. French writer Marcel Aym√© in 1941 dedicated a famous novel to this theme, La Vouivre, the creature taking the shape of a beautiful lady adorned with an enormous ruby. The specific name refers to the provenance at Damparis. The naming article appeared in an electronic publication and therefore Life Science Identifiers were needed to make the name valid. These are B06BCF72-56A8-4DD6-BC27-CC0BA6D0092D for the genus and CCAA960C-6A39-46A4-8AC9-70D8BA816647 for the species.Philip D. Mannion, Ronan Allain & Olivier Moine, 2017, \\"The earliest known titanosauriform sauropod dinosaur and the evolution of Brachiosauridae\\", PeerJ 5: e3217 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3217 Life restoration The holotype, MNHN.F.1934.6 DAM 1-42, was found in a layer of the Calcaires de Clerval, possibly the Tidalites de Mouchard member dating from the middle to late Oxfordian. Its age is likely between 163.5 and 157.3 million years. It consists of a partial skeleton lacking the skull. It contains five teeth, three neck vertebrae, two back vertebrae, the first four vertebrae of the sacrum, a front tail vertebra, ribs, both shoulderblades, the right coracoid, the right humerus, both ulnae, a right carpal, the first, second and third right metacarpals, the first phalanges of the first to fourth left fingers, two possible hand claws, the left pelvis, the right ischium, both thighbones, both shinbones, both calfbones, a left astragalus, the first left metatarsal and the first, second and third right metatarsals. The bones were recovered from a surface area of about thirty square metres. They were not articulated but roughly located in their natural position. From this it was concluded in 2017 that the animal had died in situ near a coastal lagoon, its weight forming a lens in soft chalkstone, and after an exposure of several years during which it was scavenged by theropods, was covered by a new chalk layer which protected the bones after hardening. Description Teeth The body length of Vouivria has been estimated at fifteen metres, its weight at fifteen tonnes.Imperial College London. \\"Earliest relative of Brachiosaurus dinosaur found in France: Scientists have re-examined an overlooked museum fossil and discovered that it is the earliest known member of the titanosauriform family of dinosaurs.\\" ScienceDaily, 2 May 2017. The thighbone length is 146 centimetres. The describing authors identified a number of distinguishing traits, autapomorphies or unique derived characters. Four of these distinguished Vouivria from all other known sauropods. In the middle and rear neck vertebrae, the spinopostzygapophyseal laminae, or SPOLs, ridges that run from the rear joint processes to the neural spine, thicken towards the rear near the top of the spine. In the third metacarpal of the hand, the ridge that runs along the inner rear corner of the shaft, if the bone is held vertically, splits at about a quarter of the shaft length measured from the top, the outer branch having the form of a bulge. The fourth metacarpal has a flange along the top third of the inner rear corner. Between the lower condyles of the thighbone, two transverse ridges run, at the border with the rear shaft. Also, two \\"local\\" autapomorphies were identified, that distinguished Vouvria from its nearest relatives in the Brachiosauridae. In the front tail vertebrae both the anterior centrodiapophyseal lamina (ACDL) and the posterior centrodiapophyseal lamina (PCDL), ridges that run on the front underside, respectively the rear underside, of the transverse process towards the vertebral body, are well-formed. The humerus or upper arm bone, has a deltopectoral crest, serving for the attachment of the musculus deltoideus and the pectoralis major, that doubles in transverse width to below. Phylogeny Already de Lapparent considered the specimen an exemplar of the Brachiosauridae. This was confirmed by a phylogenetic analysis in 2017, showing Vouivria to be a basal member of the Brachiosauridae, placed above Europasaurus and below Brachiosaurus altithorax in the evolutionary tree. If correct, this would make Vouivria the oldest known brachiosaurid and the oldest known member of the Titanosauriformes.

History  SNAC was established in 2010, with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), California Digital Library (CDL), Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH) at the University of Virginia and the University of California, Berkeley School of Information.. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation funded the second phase of the project from 2012 to 2014. One of the project's tools is a radial-graph feature which helps identify a social network of a subject's connections to related historical individuals. SNAC is used alongside other digital archives to connect related historical records. SNAC is a digital research project that focuses on obtaining records data from various archives, libraries, and museums, so the biographical history of individuals, ancestry, or institutions are incorporated into a single file as opposed to the data being spread throughout different associations, thereby lessen the task of searching various memory organizations to locate the knowledge one seeks. The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH), University of Virginia; the School of Information, University of California, Berkeley (SI/UCB), and the California Digital Library (CDL), University of California are the three primary organizations responsible for processing the different elements of the project. IATH conducts the project and also collect sourcing data from participating institutions, compile record descriptions from MARC catalogs and EAD finding aids, and turned them into EAC-CPF files. SI/UCB manages the process of identifying and pairing similar EAC-CPF records to create a unifying file that searchable. CDL utilizes the Extensible Text Framework (XTF) which connects the different sources that make up a single EAC-CPF file back to its primary resources. With a variety of organizations such as the Library of Congress, Smithsonian Institution, and British Library contributing data to the project, it allows the SNAC team to collect a substantial amount of information available on a subject. With the U.S. National Endowment for Humanities supplying financing, the first half of the project began, enabling the developers of SNAC to explore data extraction from the file creator and develop a model of the record description system. By gathering the contents found within the record creator, it helps to broaden the knowledge available on the entity biographical history. With the tremendous progress made in the initial stage, planning for the second half of the project centered on adding more contributors to continue to build a dissimilar of information. To help the SNAC team with the second portion of the project, funding was received the U.S Institution for Museum and Library Services while global initiatives was managed by U.S. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).  Data gathering  In 2010 the Encoded Archival Context-Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (EAC-CPF) was introduced. The new schema allowed each description to live independently from the record creator it was associated with. With the launch of EAC-CPF, the archival field had a universal standard allowing them to use archival authority records differently. By using a few archival practices, the descriptions of the creator are isolated from the file itself. Permitting the gathering of information and building connections between varies entities. Helping to increase access to additional knowledge. Below are the integrated rational elements used to create relationships. Authority Control - Allows you to locate information related to a subject with multiple or alternate spelling associated with its name through various applications. Biographical/Historical Resources ‚Äì Details all events, dates, and places associated with the file creator. Cooperative Authority Control - Permits libraries to preserve, share, and distribute authority information with other libraries. Flexible Descriptions ‚Äì Incorporates a list of multiple institutions associated with a collection connecting the record creator to it. Integrated Access to Cultural Heritage - Through authority records they act as a unifying folder for all of the descriptions tied to the subject. The authority records help lessen the issue of trying to retain and connect each institution description standard to a family, association, or individual. Social/Historical Context - Professional and social knowledge linked to the subject help connect to other people, families, and institutions creating an integrated summary of them. Within a record creator are EAC-CPF files to locate and retrieve them, the SNAC team uses Encoded Archival Description (EAD) finding aids and Machine Readable Catalog (MARC) bibliographic catalogs to gather biographical/historical data. After the information is placed an archival authority record featuring the EAC-CPF knowledge is created. Once the EAC-CPF record is extracted, the data is compared to other similar files and paired together. To ensure the information is compactible, the SNAC team use Virtual International Authority File (VIAF), Union List of Artist Names (ULAN), and Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF) to establish matches between authority records. To link the knowledge found in one file to a similar one, names, dates, and other identifying aspects are used to draw a comparison to other related records. Links to where the data originated from is also included in the entity file. By both national and international institutions providing source data, it increases the amount of information tied to one entity while linking it to other relevant subjects. With contributions from various organizations, it helps researchers, librarians, archivists, scholars, and none scholars locate an array of data available on associations, individuals, and families reducing the amount of time spent searching through an assortment of resources.

It was developed by the artist and programmer Manuel Bastioni., and was based on his over 15 year experience of 3D graphic projects. Bastioni withdrew support for the project but it has continued as a community project under the MB-Lab name.  Graphical interface and usability  The plugin is completely integrated in Blender. The GUI is designed to be self-explanatory and intuitive and when possible the features are designed to work with one click. Over 90% of the character is defined with only three sliders that control age (from 18 to 80 y.o.), body mass and body tone. The character is finished with other lab tools for body and face details, poses, skin and eye shaders, animation, poses, proxy, etc.  Technology  The software is designed as a laboratory in constant evolution and includes both consolidated algorithms as the 3D morphing and experimental technologies, as the fuzzy mathematics used to handle the relations between human parameters, the non-linear interpolation used to define the age, mass and tone, the auto-modelling engine based on body proportions and the expert system used to recognize the bones in motion capture skeletons. The graph of non-linear functions used in the algo of age metaparameter. The vertical axis represents the delta value to add to the average character. The horizontal axis represents the age from 18 to 80 years old. The software is written in Python and works on all the platforms supported by Blender: Windows, macOS and Linux. All the characters use the same standard skeleton, so the poses and animation can be easily moved from a character to another. Most of the data distributed in the package is stored using the standard json syntax.  License  ManuelbastioniLAB is completely open source, released under standard licenses of the Free Software Foundation. * Code: All files written in Python are released under GNU General Public License 3. * Data: All data files released in the ManuelbastioniLAB package are released under GNU Affero General Public License 3. The characters generated with ManuelbastioniLAB are released under the GNU Affero General Public License 3 (as derivative of AGPL'd data, meshes, textures etc.)  Anatomy and mesh topology of 3D human models  A comparison between the results of the age algorithm. The image also shows the skin shader and the wrinkle map that is automatically created by the ManuelbastioniLAB. ManuelbastionLAB provides two different base meshes for male and female models. Each model respects the fundamental requisites of a professional mesh, as defined by the author: * Optimization for subdivision surfaces. * No triangles. * Edge loops designed for deformation during poses and animation. * The topology permits to model the main features of bodies and faces. * Minimal use of poles. * Human readable topology. * Sculpting-friendly topology. The base humans are modelled after accurate studies of anatomy and anthropology. The lab 1.5.0 provides about 470 morphs for each human character, designed to parametrically describe most of the anatomical range in human bodies, faces and expressions. Genitalia are not present.  Anthropology and phenotypes  Concerning ManuelbastionLAB, the word phenotype is intended with the following meaning: ::A \\"phenotype\\" defines merely the physical appearance of a class of characters, it is not related to politics, culture, language and history. It's used to describe the variations of human traits in relation to the evolution in a specific geographical area. ManuelbastioniLAB supports most of the common human phenotypes to the extent of volumetric modelling features. The lab provides three main classes of humans: Caucasian, Asian and Afro. For each class there is a specific set of phenotypes. Each phenotype can be loaded from the library and used as base for a custom character, or mixed with another phenotype. The available phenotypes are: * Afro phenotypes: Afromediterranean, Afroasian, Aboriginal, African. * Asian phenotypes: Central Asian, North Asian, East Asian, South Asian, Central American, North American. * Caucasian phenotypes: Central European, Afrocaucasian, East European, North European, Euromediterranean, Euroartic, North West European, West Asian.  Non-human models: Anime, Elves, etc  While the lab is aimed to create realistic 3d human beings based on a scientific description of their parameters, the same technology can be successfully applied to non-human characters, like fantasy creatures. The version 1.5.0 of the lab supports three variety of anime characters: classic shojo, modern shojo and \\"realistic style\\" anime. There are also male and female elves and male dwarf. Each model has a separate set of morphs to create millions of variations. Concerning the creation of fantasy characters, the lab supports some extra parameters for humans too, like pointed ears, special teeth, etc..  Comparisons  While Makehuman has similar characteristics to MB-Lab the former is a stand-alone application and requires export and import and import to Blender (software) which is not necessary with MB-Lab.  Current stage of development  The project has been discontinued abruptly by Bastioni, after the release 1.6.1a, which was not compatible with Blender 2.80. Bart Veldhhuzien indicates Bastoni attempted unsuccessfully to raise funds and then chose move quoting Bastoni as saying: \\"I‚Äôm sorry, I did my best, but I cannot continue the development of the lab. I will use Blender as artist, since Blender and its community are part of my life.\\"; and \\"I realized that the lab community size is not enough to support a so expensive project\\". In December 2018, a new repository, based on last Bastioni's version (1.6.1a), aiming at Blender 2.80 compatibility, has been opened on GitHub with project name MB-Lab. New community based versions are available on Github supporting Blender 2.79 and 2.80.

The original station was opened on 25 July 1876 with the commissioning of the Germersheim‚ÄìW√∂rth section of Schifferstadt‚ÄìW√∂rth railway. The address of the old entrance building, which is heritage listed, is Bahnhofstra√üe 6. In the course of the integration of the Germersheim‚ÄìW√∂rth section of the line into the network of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn, it was replaced by a halt (Haltepunkt) called R√ºlzheim Bahnhof some 300 metres further north. Deutsche Bahn classifies the halt as a category 6 station and it has two platform tracks. It is located on the network of the Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund (Karlsruhe Transport Association, KVV) and belongs to fare zone 575. Since 2001, the station has also been part of the area where the fares of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (Rhine-Neckar Transport Association, VRN) are accepted at a transitional rate.  Location The former station was on the northern edge of the built-up area of R√ºlzheim. The local Bahnhofstra√üe (station street), runs parallel to and to the east of the tracks, which run in this section from northeast to southwest; it also forms part of the route of state road 493. To the west and north, agricultural land abuts the station. The railway itself comes from the north and passes through the municipality in an elongated S-curve, in the middle of which both the former station and the modern halt are located. The latter is about 300 metres further north-east directly next to state road 540 to Bellheim.  History = Railway initiatives around R√ºlzheim= Originally the administration of the Circle of the Rhine (Rheinkreis), which was part of Bavaria, planned that its first railway line would be first in the north-south direction from Rheinschanze via Lauterbourg to Strasbourg, which would compete with the Mannheim‚ÄìBasel railway proposed by Baden. However, instead it was decided to build the Palatine Ludwig Railway (Pf√§lzische Ludwigsbahn, Ludwigshafen‚ÄìBexbach), which was opened in the period from 1847 to 1849. In the meantime, discussions took place as to whether a line from Neustadt via Landau to Wissembourg or a line along the Rhine via Speyer, Germersheim and W√∂rth was more urgent and desirable. Since the military preferred a route on the edge of the Palatinate Forest (Pf√§lzerwald), this was built in the form of the Maximilian Railway between Neustadt and Wissembourg. In the course of the endeavours to link the Maximilian Railway to the capital of Baden, several individuals from Rheinzabern and its neighbours campaigned for a route via Offenbach, Herxheim, Leimersheim and Leopoldshafen. This would have met an extension of the Schifferstadt‚ÄìSpeyer branch line, which was opened at the same time as the Ludwig Railway, near R√ºlzheim and they would have been connected accordingly. These plans, however, were in competition with the proposed Winden‚ÄìKarlsruhe railway, which was finally preferred and opened in 1864. In the same year, the Speyer line was extended to Germersheim. Also in 1864, a local committee from R√ºlzheim supported an extension of the line now ending in Germersheim to W√∂rth, which soon resulted in a first draft route plan. The location of the R√ºlzheim station was however disputed. One option placed it to the east of the community, while another put it to the west. The neighbouring communities, which wanted to have it near them, also interfered in the debate. The committee itself called for the location in the west on 30 March 1872, which was finally accepted on 7 July 1872. The line to W√∂rth, including R√ºlzheim station, was opened on 25 July 1876. = Further development = The station became part of the area of the Reichsbahndirektion (Reichsbahn railway division) of Ludwigshafen after the founding of the Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1922. During the dissolution of the railway division of Ludwigshafen, responsibility for it was transferred to the railway division of Mainz on 1 May 1937. Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB), which was responsible for railway operations from 1949, assigned the station to the railway division of Mainz, which was responsible for all railway lines within the newly created state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In the course of the staged dissolution of the railway division of Mainz from 1 August 1971, its counterpart in Karlsruhe took responsibility for the station. The station had been downgraded to a halt in the 1990s. The station became part of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn in December 2010. Entrance building The former entrance building is built of brick with elements of the Neoclassical and Romanesque Revival styles. The heritage- listed building also has a three-storey tower. It is no longer used for railway operations. In the 1980s, it was renovated by a local association and part of it is used as a restaurant. The former freight shed also still exists and was restored in the 2000s. Operations The new halt is served at 30-minute intervals. Lines S 51 and S 52 of Karlsruhe Stadtbahn run once an hour, beginning in Germersheim station and running to the Karlsruhe inner city. The former follows the Winden‚ÄìKarlsruhe railway until shortly before Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof, where it runs over the ramp to the Albtalbahnhof to connect with the tram network. The S 52 leaves the Winden‚ÄìKarlsruhe railway east of Maxau, then runs over tram lines through the Karlsruhe district of Knielingen and from there to the inner city.

It was located on the eastern coast of North Sumatra, Indonesia. In its heyday the kingdom was a formidable maritime power, and was able to control the northern part of the Malacca strait. The kingdom was initially established as a Karo polity. The indigenous population practiced native animism as well as Hinduism. During the 13th century Islam came to be practiced alongside the existing faiths. Aru's capital was located close to present-day Medan city and Deli Serdang. The people of the kingdom are believed to have been descendants of the Karo people from the interior of North Sumatra. Location Traditionally, the location of Haru or Aru is connected to the site of its successor state, the Sultanate of Deli, which was in and around the city of Medan and Deli Serdang today, as suggested by British orientalist Winstedt. However, Groenveldt, a Dutch historian, has suggested that the center of the Haru Kingdom was located further southeast, near the estuary of the Barumun and Panai Rivers, in Labuhan Batu Regency, and is thus related and connected to the earlier Pannai Kingdom. Gilles suggested that the capital was located near Belawan Harbour, while another opinion suggested the estuary of the Wampu River by Haru Bay, Langkat Regency. The Kota Cina site in Medan Marelan, and Benteng Putri Hijau in Deli Tua, Namorambe, Deli Serdang Regency, are archaeological sites near Medan, which are connected to the Aru Kingdom. The Benteng Putri Hijau archaeological site is under threat of residential development. Another archaeological site is Kota Rentang in Hamparan Perak area, Deli Serdang Regency, which archaeological experts have suggested was the capital of Aru Kingdom. Historiography The earliest historical record mentioning the Haru kingdom was a Chinese chronicle dated from the Yuan Dynasty (late 13th century). There is another Chinese record from a later period, the Yingya Shenglan (1416) of the Ming Dynasty. The Kingdom of Haru was also mentioned in two Javanese records, the Nagarakretagama (1365) and Pararaton (c. 15th century). The Malay Annals mentioned Haru as one of a few influential kingdoms in the region, whose prestige rivaled that of Pasai and the Malacca Sultanate. The Portuguese record Suma Oriental written in the early 16th century mentioned Aru as a prosperous kingdom. History =Formation= An imposing traditional Karo house. The people of the Aru Kingdom are believed have been from the same stock as the Karo people of Tanah Karo The people of Aru are believed to be the descendants of, or related to, the Karo tribe which inhabits the Tanah Karo further inland. This suggestion is based on a plausible etymology of similar sounding names, between \\"Aru\\" or \\"Haru\\" with \\"Karo\\". The Benteng Putri Hijau archaeological site, at an ancient fortress near Medan, shows several layers of cultures estimated to date from between the 12th and 18th centuries. The fort is in the Karo and wider Batak tribes' tradition of constructing huta or kuta, a walled compound completed with parik (moat) as a defensive structure to protect the village against incessant tribal warfare. Artifacts found include stone tools, Chinese ceramics, tin bullets and Aceh coins. A fragment of lingam was discovered at the nearby site of Sukanalu, suggesting that the population of Aru adhered to both native animism and Hinduism prior to Islam entering the region. Mao Kun map showing part of the island of Sumatra and the Aru Kingdom at its bottom (‰∫ûË∑Ø) The Haru Kingdom was mentioned in a Chinese chronicle of the Yuan Dynasty. According to this source, in 1282 Kublai Khan demanded that Haru to submit to China's suzerainty and Haru responded graciously by sending tribute to Yuan's court in 1295. Marco Polo however, did not mention Aru in his report as one of the 8 kingdoms of Sumatra during his journey in 1292. The Haru Kingdom is mentioned in two Javanese sources originating from circa the 14th century. According to Pararaton, Haru kingdom was mentioned among polities that Gajah Mada intended to unite under Majapahit suzerainty in his Palapa oath.Mangkudimedja, R.M., 1979, Seat Pararaton. Alih aksara dan alih bahasa Hardjana HP. Jakarta: Departemen P dan K, Proyek Penerbitan Buku Sastra Indonesia dan Daerah. In 1339 a Javanese Majapahit naval expedition attacked several coastal states in Sumatra; although it failed to capture Samudera Pasai, the Javanese expedition did manage to gain control of Haru and Pane (Pannai). The Nagarakretagama (1365) canto 13 mentioned Aru as one of Majapahit vassal states in Sumatra. According to Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai and the Malay Annals the Aru kingdom was Islamized by Nakhoda Ismail and Fakir Muhammad; they also converted Merah Silu, the first king of Samudera Pasai in the mid-13th century. According to Yingya Shenglan (1416), a Chinese Ming dynasty report composed by Ma Huan about the Zheng He expedition, the king of Haru and his subjects had embraced Islam. After the 13th century, Islam slowly began to gain followers among the population of Aru. However, native animism or paganism is still pervasive, especially amongst the population of the interior region, and a few Hindus still survive. =Growth= The map of Malacca Sultanate, Aru shown on the east coast of North Sumatra, southeast from Peureulak The discovery of Muslim headstones at burial sites in Kota Rentang suggests that the ruling elites of Aru Kingdom, the King and his family, has converted to Islam. These Islamic headstones are made from volcanic tuff with Arabic Jawi script similar to those found in Aceh and other Malay states. The site is in Kota Rentang in Hamparan Perak, Deli Serdang, believed to be the location of the capital of the Aru kingdom. Numerous artifacts have been discovered at this site, including Islamic headstones, ceramics and pottery fragments from China, Thailand and Sri Lanka, and Arabic coins from the 13th and 14th century. Other discoveries include traces of timberworks, building stones and the remnants of a wooden ship. In the 15th century, the Malay Annals mentioned the Haru kingdom as one of a few influential kingdoms in the region, with its prestige rivaling those of Pasai and the Malacca Sultanate. During that period, the kingdom was a formidable maritime power controlling the northern part of the Malacca Strait. Both the Malaccan Malay and Portuguese sources mention the demographic split, and sometimes rivalry, between the Muslim minority of the coast and the native pagan heathen majority of the island, with their notorious practice of cannibalism. According to Afonso de Albuquerque the rulers of the small kingdoms of northern Sumatra and the Sultans of Malacca used to have cannibals as executioners, reserved as a punishment for special crimes: \\"There are in Malacca ... others are boiled, others are roasted and given to eat to peoples who are like savages and come from a country called Aru.\\" The Portuguese record Suma Oriental, written in the early 16th century mentions Aru as a prosperous kingdom with plenty of rice, meat, fish and wine. The kingdom was also rich in camphor, benzoin, gold, lignaloes, rattan, honey and slaves. According to the Suma Oriental, Aru governed a town in the land of Arqat, where a large slave market was held in certain months. Many people went there to buy slaves, while other people went there to pay ransom to buy the freedom of their relatives who were being sold as slaves. The coastal area of Aru kingdom was infested with Celates robbers. Duarte Barbosa (1480‚Äì1521) wrote in 1516 that the kingdom of Aru was ruled by cannibal adherents of paganism. Two decades later, Mendes Pinto also recorded the presence of the people of \\"Aaru\\" on the northeast coast of Sumatra where he also visited the local Muslim king. =Decline= The conquest by Iskandar Muda of Aceh, 1608‚Äì1637. The Kingdom of Aru was defeated by Aceh in 1613 Aru steadily grew weaker in the 16th century, caught in a regional rivalry between more powerful neighbours ‚Äî Portuguese Malacca and the Sultanate of Aceh. Because of the incessant pressure from Aceh in the early 16th century the capital of Aru moved inland, from coastal Kota Rentang to Benteng Putri Hijau. The fall of the port city of Kota Rentang to Aceh probably took place in 1539. Some historians suggest that this event marked the end of the Aru kingdom as a maritime power. Aru's influence was reduced and its influence became regional at best, and ceased to exist in the early 17th century due to various factors; including the rivalry with Aceh and other neighboring polities in Sumatra and Malay peninsula, coupled with the loss of its coastal port that isolated the kingdom from the global maritime trading network. In 1564, Aru kingdom was defeated by Ottomans during the Ottoman expedition to Aceh. In 1613, the ambitious and warlike Sultan Iskandar Muda of Aceh, strike a final blow to seal the fate of Aru kingdom. The discovery of tin bullets suggests that Benteng Putri Hijau was a battle site. Aru kingdom was dissolved in the early 17th century. Its successor state was the Deli which was reduced to the status of an Aceh protectorate (1632‚Äì1669) and later conquered by Siak (1669‚Äì1854). Society =Religion= Within the Kingdom of Aru, there were three religions recognised by its people: Islam, the faith adhered to by kingdom's elites, the royal family and coastal society; Hinduism adhered to by Tamil settlers; and native pagan animism practiced by the Karonese population of the hinterland. The Kingdom of Aru was initially built upon the larger Karo society, which was a pagan animist culture. The traditional animist belief system of Karonese is called Pemena. The Chinese Ming source Yingya Shenglan (1416) mentioned that the King of Aru and his subjects had embraced Islam. The conversion to Islam most likely took place earlier, probably in the late 13th century. Islamic gravestones discovered in Kota Rentang confirmed that Islamic society had taken firm root in the kingdom. Archaeological excavation has uncovered fragments of lingam, which suggests that part of Aru's society, possibly Tamil settlers, adhered to Hinduism. Tamil traders settled in the kingdom, bringing Hindu influences with them, and they had integrated into Aru society. =Economy and way of life= The people of Aru made their living by fishing and farming. However, since their lands were not suitable for rice farming, most of them grew coconuts and bananas instead, or forest commodities such as rattan, camphor and frankincense. They raised poultry, ducks and goats, and they consumed milk. When they went into the forest, they used poisonous arrows and bows for protection. Both men and women covered their bodies by wrapping their lower limbs in cloth, however the upper parts were left uncovered. They traded their commodities for foreign goods, including Chinese ceramics, silk and colourful beads. Archaeological findings and artifacts show that the Aru kingdom had established trading relations with India and China. According to a Chinese source, compared to Malacca and Pasai, Aru was not a great center of commerce. It seems that Aru failed to compete with Malacca and Pasai to attract regional and global Muslim traders. This led Aru kings to occasionally turn to piracy and raiding, aided by the Orang Laut, sea gypsies aligned to Aru. =Culture= The Chinese sources mention that the culture of Aru, areas such as customs, marriage and funeral traditions, language and trade, are quite similar to those of Malacca, Pasai and Java. The natural resources and commodities being traded there are also similar to those of the other polities in the region. According to the Malay Annals, Aru kingdom adopted the etiquette and culture of the Malay court; their kings used Malay styles and titles such as \\"Raja Pahlawan\\" and \\"Sri Indra\\". However, this Malay acculturation was not complete, as traces of non-Malay culture, the native Karonese elements, survive to this day. Aru maintained close cultural and trading relations with their kin in the hinterlandthe Karo people of Karolandat a time when they still practiced a native form of animism and paganism, which included a notorious practice of ritualised cannibalism. Thus, from the perspective of foreign records, the Aru country was notoriously known as the origin of savage cannibals.

He was a member of the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea from 1997 to 2002 and from 2012 to 2017, both times representing the electorate of Daulo Open. He was Vice-Minister for Finance (1997) and Vice-Minister for Overseas Development Assistance (1997‚Äì1998) in the Skate government and Minister for Fisheries (1999‚Äì2002) in the Morauta government. Education and business career Ganarafo was educated at Omboran Primary School, Amaiyufa Primary School, and Goroka High School before studying a Bachelor of Economics at the University of Papua New Guinea, graduating in 1977. He was the chief executive officer of Coffee Industry Corporation Limited, the Papua New Guinean coffee industry regulator and advocate, from 1988 to 1997. First term (1997‚Äì2002) He was first elected to the National Parliament at the 1997 election, representing the Pangu Party, although he would later switch to the People's Democratic Movement. Bill Skate, the new Prime Minister, appointed Ganarafo Vice-Minister for Finance from July to December 1997, when he was shifted to Vice-Minister for Overseas Development Assistance. The National Court quashed his election on 7 May 1998 and declared him to have not been duly elected due to an incident where an electoral officer was alleged to have illegally used an unauthorised list provided by Ganarafo's campaign coordinator. The National Court ordered a by-election, but Ganarafo successfully appealed to the Supreme Court, which ruled on 5 October 1998 that there had been no illegality and reinstated him. Ganarafo was promoted to the ministry as Minister for Fisheries in July 1999, following Mekere Morauta's ascension to Prime Minister. As minister, he signed a fishing agreement with South Korea, renewed a previously suspended agreement with Taiwan, restated Papua New Guinea's opposition to Japanese whaling, and brought Papua New Guinea into the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean. He lost his seat to Ben Kiagi at the 2002 election. Second term (2012‚Äìpresent) Ganarafo won back his old seat as an independent at the 2012 election, having reportedly been a fruit and vegetable farmer in his years out of office. In November 2012, he called for restrictions on the importing of fresh vegetables, calling the importing of subsidised vegetables from Australia and New Zealand a \\"disturbing trend\\". Ganarafo was defeated by Pogio Ghate at the 2017 election.

Among these, gray molasses is particularly efficient for atoms with poorly-resolved hyperfine structure, such as the isotopes of potassium and lithium. It combines the effects of Sisyphus cooling with a velocity- selective dark state, which prevents scattering of light by already-cold atoms. Gray molasses relies on the presence of bright states, in which the atom interacts with the laser light, and dark states, which can be created either by using circularly polarized light on an F \\\\rightarrow F'=F or F \\\\rightarrow F'=F-1 transition or EIT-like coherent dark states. A spatially varying light shift of the bright states allows moving atoms to undergo a Sisyphus-like cooling effect. From here, atoms can be optically pumped to dark states. The coupling between the dark and bright states is engineered so that the coldest atoms are trapped in dark states but hot atoms return to the Sisyphus cooling cycle. Historically, gray molasses was introduced with atomic species such as rubidium and cesium on the D2 line, but has more recently been used to enable efficient cooling of potassium and lithium using the D1 line. Avoiding the need of a separate laser system, D2-line gray molasses cooling has also been demonstrated in 40K.

History The Queen Savang Vadhana Museum used to be the mansion of Queen Savang Vadhana from 1916 till the end of her life on 17 December 1955 Then it became the mansion of Princess Srinagarindra (the mother of King Bhumibol Adulyadej). After Princess Srinagarindra passed away, King Bhumibol Adulyadej gave the palace to Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn (the great grand- daughter of Queen Savang Vadhana, daughter of King Bhumibol Adulyadej). The building became one of the important buildings of the Thai Royal family and Thai history from generation to generation.

It existed from 1866 to 1915. The mission was founded by two German missionaries, Johann Friedrich G√∂√üling and Ernst Homann, and two lay brethren, Hermann Vogelsang and Ernst Jakob. After a difficult three-month journey from Tanunda, they established their mission station at Lake Killalpaninna (about 40 km south of Coopers Creek) and tried to convert the Dieri (Diyari) people to Christianity. Anthropologist and linguist Carl Strehlow worked on the mission from 1892 to 1894, before moving to Hermannsburg. Strehlow and Johann Georg Reuther translated Christian works into the Diyari language, and also documented the grammar and vocabulary of the language. The South Australian Royal Commission on the Aborigines gathered evidence from the mission in 1914, and recommended that the mission be taken over by the government. The mission was closed by the state government in 1915. At that time, there were 70 Aboriginal children living at the mission. After the mission closed, the station became a cattle station. The school continued to operate until 1917, when the government closed all Lutheran schools.

In 1994 he was a member of the Croatia Davis Cup team that defeated Portugal in a qualifier which secured them a spot in the World Group. His only match in the tie was the opening rubber and he beat Nuno Marques in five sets. His reverse singles against Emanuel Couto was abandoned in the second set due to rain. At the 1995 World Team Cup he played the doubles when Croatia played Russia. Teammates Goran Ivani≈°eviƒá and Sa≈°a Hir≈°zon were favoured in the other fixtures and the Croatian side finished the tournament as runners-up to Sweden. He played Davis Cup once more in 1996, for a tie against Ukraine. Again used in the singles, ≈†ariƒá defeated Victor Trotsko. This was his final Davis Cup match, meaning he finished with a 100% winning record in the competition.

He played college football as a quarterback at Virginia for three seasons before transferring to Hampton.  Early years  Watford attended Hampton High School in Hampton, Virginia. Professional career =Philadelphia Eagles= Watford went undrafted in the 2016 NFL Draft. He signed with the Philadelphia Eagles as a wide receiver on July 27, 2016. He was waived on September 3, 2016, and was signed to the practice squad the next day. He signed a reserve/future contract with the Eagles on January 2, 2017. He was waived on August 26, 2017. =Saskatchewan Roughriders= On October 9, 2017, Watford was signed to the Saskatchewan Roughriders' practice squad as a quarterback. Watford made his professional debut for the Roughriders the following season in the second half of the Riders Week 3 loss to the Montreal Alouettes. Watord, who came on to replace an ineffective Brandon Bridge, completed 10 of 22 pass attempts for 108 yards, throwing one touchdown and two interceptions in the game. Watford struggled in limited playing time in 2018, completing 15 of 32 pass attempts for 168 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions. In the playoffs where the Roughriders were eliminated in their lone game against Winnipeg in the West Division semi-final, Watford recorded one rush for 6 yards. Additionally he was brought in for the final play where he threw a desperation deep pass which was intercepted. Watford was unable to beat out free agent addition Cody Fajardo during the 2019 preseason, and was cut on June 8.https://3downnation.com/2019/06/08/riders-sever-ties-with-qb-david-watford/ =Hamilton Tiger-Cats= On July 29, 2019, after a season-ending injury to starting QB Jeremiah Masoli, the Tiger-Cats announced that they had signed Watford. Watford provided depth to Hamilton, served as a short yardage rusher who scored 6 touchdowns during 12 games played, and in garbage time in Hamilton's season finale, brought the team in range for a game winning field goal; Hamilton's win was meaningless for playoff seeding purposes which had been settled weeks prior, but it did further establish a franchise best record of 15-3. Watford had two more rushing touchdowns in the Eastern final, a victory which advanced Hamilton to the CFL championship game. During the 107th Grey Cup, Watford was stopped short on a third and short rush, one of many stops made by Winnipeg's defensive line for a Blue Bomber victory.

The building was designed by Thomas Lee and it opened in 1830. In 1844 it became the parish church for Netherton. History Netherton, like many Black Country industrial areas contained many non-conformist chapels. It did not have an Anglican Church until 16 July 1830, when St Andrew's was consecrated and opened by the Lord Bishop of Worcester. The foundation stone of the church had been laid by Dr. Booker, the Vicar of Dudley, on 30 November 1827. The building, designed by Thomas Lee, was a Commissioners' church funded by parliament. It was constructed in the Early English style and cost ¬£8000 to complete. The land on which the church was built was donated by the Earl of Dudley. The churchyard contains the mass unmarked graves of the victims of cholera that struck Dudley in 1831 and 1832. It was originally just a chapel-at-ease to St Thomas's of Dudley, only becoming Netherton's parish church on December 1, 1844. The first incumbent vicar was the Rev. F.S. Bradshaw, appointed in 1845. The church underwent restoration in 1862. Furnishings added in the late 19th century and early 20th century include a font, an alabaster reredos, a pulpit, a wrought iron screen and a lectern. In February 1908, a pinnacle was blown over causing ¬£300 pounds worth of damage to the west end of the church A vestry was added to the east end of the church in 1938. The building is Grade II listed. Situation St Andrew's is situated on Netherton Hill at the highest point in Netherton. The church is surrounded by the gravestones of many of the former residents of the area. The main entrance is from Highbridge Road. Description View of the church from the entrance on Highbridge Road The church has been described as \\"a very good example of an almost unaltered Commissioners' church\\". It was constructed in Early English style. It is of brick construction with Gornal stone (sandstone) facing and a slate roof. A tower with four pinnacles stands at the west end of the church. Inside, the church is 98 feet in length and 54 feet in width with a gallery on the north, west and south sides. The organ, supplied by T.H.Harrison of Rochdale is at the north east end of the gallery. The gallery is supported by iron pillars. Furnishings include the original wooden box pews. The oak altar, designed by the vicar, S.J. Marriot, was installed on News Year's Eve, 1887. The clock, supplied by Bensons of London and installed in the tower, was partially funded by sports events held at the nearby Netherton Cricket Ground. Diocese The church is part of the Diocese of Worcester. It is under the authority of the Bishop of Dudley, Canon Graham Usher and the Venerable Nikki Groarke, Archdeacon of Dudley. The incumbent vicar is Fr Mike Rutter.

Deutsche Bahn classifies it as a category 6 station and it has two platform tracks. It is located on the network of the Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund (Karlsruhe Transport Association, KVV) and belongs to fare zone 540. Since 2001, the station has also been part of the area where the fares of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (Rhine-Neckar Transport Association, VRN) are accepted at a transitional rate. Its address is Bahnhofstra√üe 26. It is located on the Schifferstadt‚ÄìW√∂rth railway and was opened on 25 July 1876 with the commissioning of the Germersheim‚ÄìW√∂rth section of that railway. It is now classified as a Haltepunkt (halt). Since late 2010, it has been part of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn. Since two new halts were opened at the same time in Rheinzabern, it is also sometimes called Rheinzabern Bahnhof (Rheinzabern station) including in the recorded announcements of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn.  Location The station is located on the northern edge of the built-up area of Rheinzabern.  History = Railway initiatives around Rheinzabern= Originally the administration of the Circle of the Rhine (Rheinkreis), which was part of Bavaria, planned that its first railway line would be first in the north-south direction from Rheinschanze via Lauterbourg to Strasbourg, which would compete with the Mannheim‚ÄìBasel railway proposed by Baden. However, instead it was decided to build the Palatine Ludwig Railway (Pf√§lzische Ludwigsbahn, Ludwigshafen‚ÄìBexbach), which was opened in the period from 1847 to 1849. In the meantime, discussions took place as to whether a line from Neustadt via Landau to Wissembourg or a line along the Rhine via Speyer, Germersheim and W√∂rth was more urgent and desirable. Since the military preferred a route on the edge of the Palatinate Forest (Pf√§lzerwald), this was built in the form of the Maximilian Railway between Neustadt and Wissembourg. In the course of the endeavours to link the Maximilian Railway to the capital of Baden, several individuals from Rheinzabern and its neighbours campaigned for a route via Offenbach, Herxheim, Leimersheim and Leopoldshafen. This would have met an extension of the Schifferstadt‚ÄìSpeyer branch line, which was opened at the same time as the Ludwig Railway, near R√ºlzheim and they would have been connected accordingly. These plans, however, were in competition with the proposed Winden‚ÄìKarlsruhe railway, which was finally preferred and opened in 1864. In the same year, the Speyer line was extended to Germersheim. Also in 1864, a local committee from R√ºlzheim supported an extension of the line now ending in Germersheim to W√∂rth, which soon resulted in a first draft route plan. The location of the Rheinzabern station was however disputed. One option placed it to the east of the community, while another put it to the west. The neighbouring communities, which wanted to have it near them, also interfered in the debate. The committee itself called for the location in the west on 30 March 1872, which was finally accepted on 7 July 1872. The line to W√∂rth, including Rheinzabern station, was opened on 25 July 1876. = Further development = The station became part of the area of the Reichsbahndirektion (Reichsbahn railway division) of Ludwigshafen after the founding of the Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1922. During the dissolution of the railway division of Ludwigshafen, responsibility for it was transferred to the railway division of Mainz on 1 May 1937. Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB), which was responsible for railway operations from 1949, assigned the station to the railway division of Mainz, which was responsible for all railway lines within the newly created state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In the course of the staged dissolution of the railway division of Mainz from 1 August 1971, its counterpart in Karlsruhe took responsibility for the station. The station had been downgraded to a halt in the 1990s. The station became part of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn in December 2010. Entrance building The former entrance building is a hip-roofed building, which is built in the Neoclassical style. It is heritage listed. It is no longer used for railway operations. Operations The halt is served at 30-minute intervals. Lines S 51 and S 52 of Karlsruhe Stadtbahn run once an hour, beginning in Germersheim station and running to the Karlsruhe inner city. The former follows the Winden‚ÄìKarlsruhe railway until shortly before Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof, where it runs over the ramp to the Albtalbahnhof to connect with the tram network. The S 52 leaves the Winden‚ÄìKarlsruhe railway east of Maxau, then runs over tram lines through the Karlsruhe district of Knielingen and from there to the inner city.

STAP enables symmetric user-interface access for AI and human users. STAP spec and sample task-side and user-side scripts: https://vdv7.github.io/stap/ Description Main focus of STAP is in providing a functionally-equivalent task experience for human and computational users alike. In its focus to make human software usable by machine agents, STAP aims to eliminate non-task-essential design choices (e.g. font type/size may be irrelevant for many task types), leaving those to be optionally specified via customizable templates (e.g. CSS). STAP messages adhere to JSON formatting, and can be deserialized with any standard JSON library. Deployment Deploying a STAP application is similar to deploying a web application, where STAP takes place of HTML as the language for UI description. Much like HTML, STAP is a means for serializing task interface display and interactions. Unlike HTML documents, STAP messages are incremental updates to the display. Whereas HTML is focused on hypertext look and feel, STAP is focused on function, structure, and affordances of task display. Benefits Benefits of task development with STAP: * less code, more GUI * cross-platform, web-friendly * precision timing * consistent cross-task API, allowing computational agents to interact with the same sw that that human users interact with Benefits of agent development for STAP-compliant tasks: * consistent cross-task API, allowing computational agents to interact with the same sw that that human users interact with * precise user-time [with faster- than-real-time and slower-than-real-time capabilities] * cross-platform, web- friendly * scalable (i.e., core API is minimal, additional UI feature handlers can be added to agent framework on a per-task basis) Sample interactions -> Message sent from task software to participant software <\\\\- Message sent to task software from participant software Sample Interaction 1: // user software ready <\\\\- [0,[0 // display \\"Hello World\\" -> [\\"Hello World\\"] // display a \\"Click Me\\" button -> \\"Click Me\\" // user clicks the button after 30.8s <\\\\- [30800,\\"Click Me\\",true] Sample Interaction 2: // user software ready <\\\\- [0,[0 // let client know that \\"S\\" (start time) and \\"eT\\" (editable-text field) are required directives for this task -> {\\"require\\":{\\"options\\":[\\"S\\",\\"eT\\"]}} // let client know that a goal in this task is to maximize coins earned -> {\\"task\\":{\\"good\\":\\"Coins Earned\\",\\">\\"}} // display a text prompt to get participant's name (eT:1 turns text editable) -> \\"What is your name?\\",\\"\\",{\\"eT\\":1} // participant types in \\"Bob\\" and hits enter (9.876sec after task display first loaded) <\\\\- [9876,\\"What is your name?\\",\\"Bob\\"] // clear display -> null // display two buttons -> \\"choose a button\\",\\"Button 1\\"],[\\"Button 2\\" // first button was clicked after 12.307sec <\\\\- [12307,\\"Button 1\\",true] // give client reward, \\"Coins Earned\\"=7 -> \\"Coins Earned\\",7 // wait 2 seconds and remove the Coins Earned display -> \\"Coins Earned\\",null,{\\"S\\":14307} // second button was clicked <\\\\- [15422,\\"Button 2\\",true] // give reward -> \\"Coins Earned\\",3 ...

The film stars Manisha Koirala in the title role of a lonely woman residing in the hill town of Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. Newcomers Shreya Chaudhary and Madiha Imam play supporting roles in the film which released theatrically on 2 June 2017. Plot The film opens into the lives of teenage girls Anna and Ira, students at a convent (Catholic) school in Shimla. They are particularly close and divide their daytime between school and romance novels and boys and, occasionally, sleepovers. They are very intrigued by their reclusive middle-aged neighbor Maya Devi who lives alone in a large house (with her two dogs) and rarely goes out. Anna's mother explains that Maya Devi lost her father early and lived in that house with her chacha (father's brother) and mother. Maya Devi was, and still is, a beautiful girl but her chacha constantly thwarted her marriage (by berating her and chasing away suitors). This was because he stood to inherit her estate. In time he passed away and Maya resigned herself to a dreary and solitary life. Ira devises a plan to write love letters to Maya. The girls hope that this prank may bring some light into Maya's life. They write letters, vivid and touching and steamy, pretending to be a former suitor, now in Delhi, still pining for Maya. Ira takes the prank further by breaking into Maya's house one evening to steal a photograph. This goes badly; Ira breaks her ankle, as does Maya's maid; the girls are reprimanded and Anna is tasked with filling in for the maid until the maid recovers. During this time Anna gets a little closer to Maya. The letters still arrive and Anna observes that Maya becomes happier with each new letter. One day Maya stuns everyone by announcing that she is selling the house and moving to Delhi to find the letter writer, her long lost suitor. Anna discovers, to her horror, that the letter which prompted the decision was written by Ira and had an explicit invitation. She runs to dissuade Maya but is unable to do so. She confides in her mother. Anna is reprimanded and sent away to boarding school, away from Ira. Anna leaves without saying goodbye to Ira and they never speak again. Ira is shattered. Torn by the guilt of her prank, Anna makes it her mission to find Maya in Delhi. Over the next six years she sticks posters and makes phone calls and follows every lead to find Maya. She finds a boyfriend, Rahul, who ultimately proposes to her but she is unable to accept. She returns to Shimla to discuss this with her parents. Ira visits her but Anna is still angry and turns her away. Ira is profusely sorry and persists and ultimately accompanies Anna back to Delhi. Anna is still mad at Ira for her selfish and childish behaviour which likely destroyed Maya's life, but Ira reveals that she, too, had fallen in love in Shimla, and had lost her love to a motor accident, and now, having lost love, is fully aware of the true consequences of her pranks. Anna forgives Ira and persuades Ira to transfer to a college in Delhi. But Ira decides to return to Shimla. As Anna bids goodbye to Ira on the train station she receives a phone call from Maya. The girls hurry to meet Maya. To their astonishment they find her, bright and sparkling and happy, at the zoo garden. Maya reveals her story. She had arrived in Delhi and tried to trace the letter writer but found nothing. Instead, over time, she found that Delhi, and the world outside Shimla, was not so frightening after all. People were helpful and kind. And she eventually met a kind and charming man who owned a jewelry shop. In time she became close to this man, Ved, and they married. And today Maya is blissfully happy with her Ved. The letters changed her life and she tells them to say 'yes' to life. Anna and Ira are stunned. They joyfully hug Maya and she embraces them and invites them to call any time. The film ends as Anna accepts Rahul's proposal and Ira transfers to a college in Delhi.

The film marked the return of actress Manisha Koirala, who was on sabbatical from the film industry after being diagnosed with cancer. It also features actresses Shreya Chaudhary and Madiha Imam in pivotal supporting roles. Principal photography for the film took place in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh in March 2016. Marketing and release The three- minutes long trailer for the film was released on YouTube on 5 May 2017, to positive response from critics and audience. Manisha Koirala's ability to play versatile roles was met with praise; as noted by a commentator from The Indian Express it was a perfect comeback for Koirala who is, \\"doing what she does best, playing interesting characters onscreen\\". The film had its theatrical release on 2 June 2017 in India. The film had limited screen shows as it only screened on 75 screens. It clashed with seven films at the box office. Soundtrack The soundtrack of Dear Maya was composed by Anupam Roy & SandMan, while the lyrics were written by Irshad Kamil. Reception Upon release in India, Dear Maya received a mixed response. There was praise for Koirala's performance, but criticism of its overstretched narrative.

In the 1980s the work of Gjessing turned increasingly international with many travels to West and North Africa where he studied environmental issues in arid and semi-arid landscapes.

It is the dissertation of Dr. Leopold M√ºffelmann who was a jurist and chief executive of the lodge of the Freemason, and summarizes historical viewpoints on the topic of free will with a focus on the common opinion within German philosophy in the early 20th century. The book considers the general ideas towards the problem, namely indeterminism, fatalism and determinism. M√ºffelmann treats the subject of free will rather objectively, however, it becomes apparent that his view towards the problem of free will is deterministic. In the dissertation M√ºffelmann argues, that the problem of free will is actually not as important as often claimed by philosophers and that ethical life and thought should not be made dependent upon it. The book is divided into five main parts, which include an introduction to the meaning of the topic of free will, followed by the main part, which treats the Problem of free will and its solutions. This part is divided into solutions in the past and solutions in the present. The dissertation ends with a short outlook on the development of the problem of free will in the future. Historical context The topic of free will is a highly debated topic within philosophy since many centuries. As stated by M√ºffelmann, first thoughts towards the question on whether our thoughts are free or determined arose in the ancient greek philosophy, specifically with the stoics. After that many important philosophers contributed their thoughts towards the topic establishing three main views. The book was written at the beginning of the 20th century, where the main streams towards the problem, which are determinism, indeterminism and fatalism were already settled. The \\"newest german philosophy\\" hardly contributes greatly new thoughts towards the debate, but rather finds new arguments for the main views previously mentioned. Content The main part of the book deals with the problem of free will in German philosophy within the early 20th century. M√ºffelmann focuses on the three main streams towards free will within philosophy, which are indeterminism, fatalism and determinism. M√ºffelmann focuses on the viewpoints of some important philosophers and stresses that he only considers those authors who contributed something new to the undoubtedly old debate of free will. =Indeterminism= M√ºffelmann begins with explaining the views on indeterminism. This part is divided into six parts, namely the ‚ÄúLiberum arbiturium indifferentiae‚Äù, the intelligible freedom, indeterminism in catholic philosophy, ‚Äúagnostic indeterminism‚Äù, indeterminism in criminal law and theology, and a retrospect. M√ºffelmann refers to Lotze and his student Sommer who are defenders of indeterminism. Their main claim can be put into a nutshell by saying that indeterminism is true because we all feel that we are free and denying our freedom would mean that humans have much less power than we hope to have. M√ºffelmann argues against this view. He stresses that the arguments for indeterminism are based on feelings rather than rationality. Importantly, he claims that indeterminism is not in line with our conception of a human personality. If nothing about our action was determined, so he claims, then every action would be happening due to chance. Additionally, M√ºffelmann argues against the argument that indeterminism is the only viewpoint that allows the maintenance of human dignity. According to M√ºffelmann, the subjective experience of freedom arises, when our actions are in line with our self. However, these actions are not independent of our surroundings and not a product of capriciousness. =Fatalism= M√ºffelmann goes on explaining fatalism, which neglects all of the premises indeterminism makes. According to fatalism, there is no such thing as freedom, humans have no power to influence the world in any way, there is no responsibility, and there is no accountability. M√ºffelmann stresses, that the boundaries between fatalism and determinism are often blurry and that different philosophers often argue in line with both views. According to M√ºffelmann the newest German philosophy barely argues in line with fatalism and the only thing that fatalism left which is still influential is the materialistic worldview. Philosophers who were mentioned to be fatalists are Ernst Haeckel and the positivist Paul R√©e. =Determinism= When explaining determinism, M√ºffelmann focuses on four main points. He begins with explaining indeterministic and fatalistic determinists, goes on with pure determinists, a statistics on moral, and a retrospect. The central claim of determinism is that every single action of will is motivated and caused by some reasons. Nevertheless, determinism accepts the premise of freedom by defining freedom as determinism of single actions by the self, by ones own character, by ones own individual personality. Important indeterministic determinists mentioned are Christoph von Sigwart and Wilhelm Wundt.M√ºffelmann himself agrees most with the view of determinism. He claims, that the reason why many people feel that freedom and determinism contradict each other, is that they confuse determinism with fatalism. However, if one accepts the determinists definition of freedom, determinism is most in line with conception of the human personality. Reception In a philosophical review, published by Duke university journal, W.G. Everett shortly reviews the dissertation of M√ºffelmann, stating that the book is a characteristic product of German scholarship. Everett states that M√ºffelmann arguments against indeterministic arguments are sound, however, he contents that one could find other arguments which would support the denied arguments. According to Everett the chief service of the book can be found in the material which it offers to students who desire an orientation in German-thought in the topic of free will.

His artwork addresses social justice issues, focusing specifically on topics of immigration, race, and labor. While his work demonstrates a variety of styles and media, including canvas, cardboard, magazine, and paper, his message remains to bring the Latino domestic and menial workforce to the forefront of public discourse. Gomez works with California-based art dealer, Charlie James Gallery, exhibiting his pieces in installations and exhibitions nationwide. He and his art have also been recognized and promoted by news media, giving the Latino community a platform to voice their story. Much of his work highlights the efforts of often unseen laborers who maintain landscapes and produce luxury products.  Early life  Born in 1986 in San Bernardino, California, Ramiro Gomez Jr. is the son of two formerly- undocumented Mexican immigrants. \\"Jay\\", the nickname Gomez adopted in his childhood to distinguish himself from his father, Ramiro Gomez Sr., was born into a working-class family. Both parents, hailing from different parts of the Mexican countryside west of Mexico City and south of Guadalajara, left for the United States in the 1970s. His mother and father arrived in California separately and without legal documentation. They married one year before Gomez's arrival in 1985, and later became US citizens following the births of their two daughters. Gomez spent his childhood admiring the tireless work of his mother Maria Elena, a school custodian, and his father Ramiro Sr., a Costco truck driver. While his parents worked, Gomez's grandmother took care of him and his sisters, assuming a vital role in his upbringing and providing him with unwavering support as he came to terms with his sexuality. Throughout his childhood, Gomez grappled with his sexual identity, understanding that his attraction to other boys was disapproved of by his traditional Mexican family. Following the initial shock, his family came to support his homosexuality. Shortly after graduating high school, Gomez met photographer and filmmaker David Feldman. The pair are now married and live in West Hollywood. Feldman plays a critical role in the documentation and preservation process of Gomez's work. Before his cardboard cutouts are either stolen, thrown out, or destroyed, Feldman photographs the artwork in its intended position and location. These images are then hung in Charlie James Gallery exhibitions, as well as others nationwide.  Education and early career  Throughout his childhood, Gomez found school assignments and class tedious. Nevertheless, he excelled in the art studio, eventually resulting in a partial scholarship to the California Institute of the Arts Due to a combination of financial struggles and the passing of his grandmother, Gomez dropped out of CalArts after one year. In order to make a living, Gomez secured a private nanny job with a Los Angeles family, which he began in September 2009. He held this job for two years and it provided him with the stability he had lacked previously. Not only did it provide a steady income and a reliable living situation, but it also allowed Gomez to work alongside people whose backgrounds resembled his, reminding him of his family's Latino immigrant roots. During these two years when Gomez cared for the family's children, he began his first artistic series, Domestic Scenes, which documented his daily experiences and observations of the other workers in the home and the neighborhood. As the children napped, Gomez would retreat to his room so that he could paint loose representations of his fellow workers, depicting male workers in their outdoor sphere tending to the lawn and pool and female housekeepers cleaning the interiors.  Artistic career  = Early works = While working as a nanny, Gomez would look at issues of Luxe, Dwell, Architectural Digest, and Elle D√©cor displayed in his employer's home. Upon flipping through the pages, Gomez found the images devoid of the workers who maintained the advertised domestic lifestyle. This realization prompted him to begin his series, Domestic Scenes (2012‚Äìpresent), in which he superimposes domestic workers onto advertisements in high-end magazines to reinsert an image of the Latino community into the public consciousness. Gomez depicts the figures of housekeepers, nannies, and gardeners completing their daily duties in the Chicano rasquache style, as a way to both, acknowledge and document their lives and labor. Gomez gives each of his workers a Latino name such as Maria, Lupita, or Carmen but renders the figures with loose and rough strokes that blur any identifiable facial features, which writer Katharine Schwab states \\"reframes the David Hockney paintings and glossy magazine advertisements he takes for inspiration, putting the lives of California‚Äôs near-invisible and individually disposable workers front and center.\\" In addition to their names, most of his figures are presented with dark skin and brown hair to fully represent the archetype of a Latino domestic worker. The series acts as a photo study, documenting the figures that advertisements have erased from the narrative. These images earned Gomez recognition within the art world, resulting in his partnership with the California-based art dealer Charlie James Gallery. =My Cousins and My Aunts without my Tio Carlos= Ramiro Gomez painted this to demonstrate his personal family‚Äôs struggle after his uncle was deported in 2018. In the painting, ‚Äúa man-shaped hole in a family portrait marks the spot where a graduate‚Äôs father should have been‚Äù. Gomez leaves the figures in his portrait faceless, but right next to the graduate is an empty space while the rest of the family is standing next to each other = David Hockney = Gomez has stated that he sees David Hockney as a personal hero and an influence for many of his works, as well as helping him to openly embrace his sexuality. Hockney is known for creating idealistic depictions of Los Angeles, California. His modernist style rendered the splendor of Los Angeles residents, homes and pop culture. Gomez sought to revise Hockney's compositions by including the implied characters who work to maintain the depicted beauty as well as to portray dark-skinned workers, diverting the focus of the piece from luxury to labor. Gomez reimagined Hockney's A Bigger Splash (1967), with his version, No Splash, which he completed in 2014. While Gomez's reproduction does not depict Hockney's large splash in the foreground, it does include two faceless workers in the background who clean windows and rake the pool. Gomez's painting is currently in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, San Diego's (MCA San Diego) permanent collection. = Cardboard cutouts = Gomez crosses mediums to cardboard to represent Latino gardeners, custodians, and workers in his series entitled Cut-Outs. In this series, Gomez‚Äôs main objective was \\"to slow people down, to have them double-take, to make them take notice and see\\" the cardboard figures that he placed along the sidewalks, on lawns, and against buildings. Gomez paints his loose renderings of people on life-size cardboard cutouts, which he collects from the dumpsters behind a Best Buy at the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and La Brea Avenue. While the destinations and arrangements for each figure are carefully thought out and executed, Gomez knows that the cutouts‚Äô lives are short-lived as they are either stolen, thrown out or destroyed. According to Gomez, the disposability of the cardboard figures acts as commentary on the perceived replaceability of domestic and maintenance workers. Gomez's husband, photographer David Feldman, photographs images of the cutouts for exhibitions nationwide. In 2013, the UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center at UCLA offered Gomez his first solo exhibition, entitled Luxury Interrupted, to present images of his cutouts. Gomez displays most of his cutouts throughout the lawns, street corners, and playgrounds of Beverly Hills and West Hollywood, which he says is intended to force passersby to recognize who maintains the city and cares for its children. In 2012, Gomez planted four cardboard Latino workers on the hedge of actor George Clooney‚Äôs home prior to a fundraiser event that President Obama was to attend. One of the figures displayed a sign that read \\"We are all American\\". His intent was to demonstrate the political dimensions of his art by both representing and humanizing his subjects. According to Katharine Schwab, Gomez uses the power and accessibility of street art to force society to recognize who maintains city and cares for its children. Gomez explains that \\"it was strange; actual humans involved in their labor had become invisible to most people, but the image of a human, there, in the middle of your day, and not at some museum or gallery, but there in the middle of your path, somehow that registered.\\" In 2017, LACMA announced the inclusion of Gomez's works from his series, Cut-Outs (2015), in their permanent collection.  Recent works  In 2017, artist Rafa Esparza invited Gomez to the Whitney Biennial in New York to participate in his exhibition, Figure Ground: Beyond the White Field. While working at the Whitney, Gomez observed the custodians, security guards, and staff members, documenting images on his phone so that he could later create cardboard cutouts of these subjects. In the week prior to the Biennial, he gifted his subjects with their cardboard representations, giving them recognition for their labor. Also in 2017, Gomez's work was part of the group exhibition, Home---So Different, So Appealing, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). Both the UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, partnered with LACMA for this exhibition. The exhibit served as part of the J. Paul Getty Museum‚Äôs Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA, an initiative that seeks to promote an appreciation and exploration of Latino and Latin American Art in Los Angeles.  Exhibitions  Gomez's work has been exhibited at: LACMA, the Museum of Latin American Art (MoLAA), the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, the Denver Art Museum, MCA San Diego, MFA Houston, the Torrance Art Museum, the Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art, the Cornell Fine Arts Museum, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and many others. His story and his work have been discussed in a variety of news outlets, including: The New Yorker, The Atlantic, The Washington Post, The New York Times Magazine, Hyperallergic, the Los Angeles Times, The Huffington Post, and on NPR and CNN among others.

Built about 1706 and enlarged several times, it is a well-preserved colonial residence, exhibiting changing construction methods through its alterations. Moved in the 1970s to avoid demolition and restored, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description and history The Abrahm Coult House is located in a rural- suburban area of central northern Glastonbury, on the north side of Hebron Road (Connecticut Route 94). It is set well back from the road, down a drive on over of land, overlooking Salmon Brook. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, central chimney, clapboarded exterior, and concrete block foundation. Its main facade faces southwest, and is five bays wide, with a center entrance framed by Greek Revival pilasters and topped by a multilight transom window and corniced entablature. The interior follows an early colonial central chimney plan, with a narrow entrance vestibule which also has a winding dogleg staircase. There are parlors on either side of the chimney, and the kitchen extends across most of the rear. Original 18th- century woodwork is retained in most of the chambers, but plasterwork and other surfaces have been replaced as part of a 1970s restoration. The house as built about 1706, when the land it originally stood on (closer to Hebron Street) was purchased by Abraham Coult, Sr. The house was held in the Coult family only until 1739, and had a succession of private owners. By the 1960s, it had come into the hands of the local water supply authority, and was vacant and deteriorated. It was sold in 1972 for $500, on condition that it be moved. This was accomplished despite fire damaged caused by vandals during preparations for the move. The move, about to the northeast of its original location, including moving the in-house portion of the chimney.

This project is a collaboration between University College London (UCL), University of Bath, and Queen's University Belfast. The project is led by Professor Graham Worth who is the Chair, alongside Vice-Chairs Dr Stephen Clark and Professor Hugo van der Hart. Quantemol Ltd is also a close partner of the project. The project is a result of the previous Collaborative Computation Project 2 (CCP2), and is an improved version of this older project. CCPQ (and its predecessor CCP2) have supported various incarnations of the UK Molecular R-matrix project for almost 40 years.  Applications  Both academic and industrial researchers use CCPQ. One of its uses is in the field of plasma research; reliable data on electron and light interactions is essential in order to model plasma processes used both on a small and large scale. Large scale industrial processes need to investigate the implementation of new methods thoroughly, and CCPQ can be used to theoretically determine the value of new processes. CCPQ has been used to study the Hubbard models for cold atoms in optical lattices, as it provides codes used in this area of research.

The content of his essay is an elaboration on a lecture series about yoga and psychoanalysis given at the psychoanalytic conference of the School of Wisdom, which took place on the 3rd until 5 March in 1923. Since 1916, Schmitz worked on a framework that should include yoga and Psychoanalysis, but he lacked the final piece that would have allowed him to meaningfully combine them. The inspiration for the absolute binding of yoga and psychoanalysis came from a correspondence with Count Hermann Keyserling, an associate of Schmitz and one of the founders of the school of wisdom, to whom Schmitz dedicated the book. Keyserling's doctrine of creative self-awareness (sch√∂pferische Selbsterkenntnis) serves as a basis for this synthesis and states that there is only one aim in life, namely self- fulfillment, which can be attained by a combination of both methods. Content The book is split into three sections, which build upon each other in order to explain the logic behind the synthesis of the two opposing methods, yoga and psychoanalysis. Schmitz not only attempts to relate them, but he tries to establish psychoanalysis as a European yoga method. In the first part, he explains general terms and concepts of yoga and psychoanalysis and how they relate to each other by referring to the Indian philosophy and different schools of psychoanalysis. In general, he believes that both methods were developed because people have the natural desire to search for a way to unify the individual with the true, inner self. In the Indian philosophy, this true inner self is also known as the Atman, which every person should become aware of. While Yoga is a method to separate from the world to find unity with the personal origin, psychoanalysis instead focuses on the isolated parts of the individual and analyses them critically. However, there is no certain way of how to integrate the single pieces back together into one unity. As a result of their differences, the two methods complement each other. Yoga tries to silence a person's conscious awareness in order to let the unconscious surface. This allows a person to free himself from it and to finally find Atman. However, Europeans are often held up to reach in-depth self-knowledge because they are afraid of their unconscious, which can only be identified and eliminated with the help of psychoanalysis. Schmitz elaborates on the characteristics of the different schools of psychoanalysis by Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler, and Carl G. Jung. Jung, Carl Gustav, and Sonu Shamdasani, The psychology of Kundalini Yoga: notes of the seminar given in 1932, Princeton University Press, 1999, p.XX. In his opinion, the Jungian system comes closest to the Indian yoga method in that it considers a person's psyche as an individual unity and not as a function or part of society. According to Jung's analytical psychology, a person's conscious self is only one-sided. Additionally, every person has underdeveloped functions in their unconscious, which needs to be freed from repression. Psychoanalysis can help to identify these traits and use them to combine those one-sided elements into the true individuality of a person. In that way, psychoanalysis can contribute to higher human development and self-knowledge. In the second part, Schmitz examines in depth the structure and development of the human unconscious, how a person is influenced by it and what a person can do to reveal the unconscious parts of his or her personality. According to him, during the creation of a human being, the psyche is split. In the early years of childhood, a person is aware of their drives and impulses but later on builds up barriers to repress them. The stronger these barriers are the greater is the fear of revealing the unconscious and consequently psychoanalysis. But only if a person reaches self-knowledge can the different elements of the human psyche be reunited. Additionally, Schmitz emphasizes that, since self- fulfilment is an individual process, every person needs to find their own way of achieving it and therefore, every person needs their own yoga method. The last part is centered on the new man for whom Schmitz attempts to develop a European Yoga system. Jung's reception In a letter to Schmitz from 26 May 1923, Carl Jung comments on the work and states his point of view. Even though he agrees with the general comparison between his analytical psychology and yoga, he remains critical about the adaptation of the yoga method to the European culture. In the remainder of his letter, Jung emphasizes that yoga works as a method to gain self-knowledge and self-improvement for Indians, as their unmarred historical development provides each individual with a clear foundation. Europeans, however, are a collection of nations who have lost their primitive roots. As a change for self-improvement must come from within, Europeans need to primarily rediscover their origins. Yoga as a method for self-fulfilment only works if it can build upon a stable basis. As long as this is not given, Jung refers to it as merely an Indian ‚Äòanalogy‚Äô to the European psychoanalysis and not a replacement. Additionally, a short review written by P. Masson-Oursel in the Journal de psychologie normale et pathologique from 1925 supports Jung's view and emphasizes that the comparison between yoga and psychoanalysis is impossible since yoga is no intellectual method and differs in its aim from the European psychoanalysis. Historical context Published in (Germany) in 1923, the book was written during the interwar period in Europe. After suffering through the first world war, Germans had to cope with war memories and accusations of guilt. Thus, the German mindset was centered on overcoming the past (Bew√§ltigung der Vergangenheit) not only concerning the current historical developments but also with a focus on each person's individual past.Murdoch, B. O., German literature and the First World War: the anti-war tradition: collected essays, Ashgate, 2015, p.1-2 Since the late 19th century, psychoanalysis had been on the rise which is also occupied with a person's history, crisis resolution, and self-discovery. Especially after the first world war, unveiling an individual's past, complexes and early childhood experiences became even more important, as people desired to find the way back to their origins. As one school of psychoanalysis, Jung's analytical psychology emphasized the division of the individual into the consciousness, the personal unconscious, and the collective unconscious. Especially the two latter types are discussed in the book as being in the center of psychoanalysis as a therapy method. Jung's analytic psychology was influenced less by science but rather by philosophy, spiritualism, and his interest in the Eastern religion and culture. The fact that Schmitz subscribes to the Jungian school of thought might also come from his fascination with the Indian culture. As an associate of the school of wisdom, Schmitz was in contact with many scholars practicing yoga and the Indian philosophy. Yoga arrived in Western Europe in the 18th century and gained attention with the romantic period. During this time, India was glorified and seen in contrast to the German rational and emotionless culture. Especially the German literature approached the Indian culture in an affirmative and philosophical way. Additionally, as scholars translated works on the Indian philosophy and yoga into German, the ideas became accessible for the wider public. Spiritualism and occultism joined the general interest for the Indian culture. The fascination for the Indian culture continued and was examined more in depth during the 19th and 20th century by philosophers like Arthur Schopenhauer and Hermann Hesse. Therefore, Schmitz examined and compared yoga and psychoanalysis already in their early stages of development in Europe. The book is likely one of the first that discusses their relationship and synthesis.

He was the brother of the politician Jules Destr√©e. Bruno Destr√©e was a monk at Maredsous Abbey and later at Keizersberg Abbey in Leuven. He was interested in the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.  Biography  Georges Destr√©e was born in Marcinelle August 10, 1867. He was the younger brother of the politician Jules Destr√©e. Like his elder brother, he studied law at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles. It was then he started putting his father's first name, Olivier, before his own. He collaborated as an art columnist in the magazine La Jeune Belgique, where he met Max Waller, Albert Giraud and Iwan Gilkin. Anglophile, he was really enthusiastic about Pre-Raphaelite painting: in 1894 he published Les Pr√©rapha√©lites : notes sur l‚Äôart d√©coratif et la peinture en Angleterre, the very first essay on this movement in French. In the Revue g√©n√©ral of October 1895, he gave a nearly complete translation of \\"La Lampe de la m√©moire\\", the sixth chapter of The Seven Lamps of Architecture; a few years later, Marcel Proust‚Äôs reading of that text would be decisive in his own business of translating John Ruskin‚Äôs work. He then collaborated with the Catholic magazine Durendal. He gradually got closer to Catholicism and decided in October 1898 to enter the Order of St. Benedict. He took the name of Dom Bruno and later left Maredsous abbey to enter Keizersberg Abbey in Leuven. He was ordained priest in 1903. In 1911, he collaborated with his brother to organise the exhibition Les Arts anciens du Hainaut. He died of peritonitis on 30 October 1919 in Leuven.

Overall, education sector responses tend to focus on homophobia and violence linked to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression, and less on transphobia. Most responses focus in some way on diverse expressions of gender and support students to understand that gender may be expressed in a different way from binary models (of masculine and feminine). Responses vary greatly in their scope (from a single class to the national level); duration (from one- off events to several years); and level of support that they enjoy (from individual teachers to the highest levels of government). A comprehensive education sector response to homophobic and transphobic violence encompasses all of the following elements: effective policies, relevant curricula and learning materials, training and support for staff, support for students and families information and strategic partnerships, and monitoring and evaluation. This type of approach could also be applied in the form of Gay- Straight Alliances (GSA's). GSAs are ‚Äústudent-led clubs open to youth of all sexual orientations with the purpose of supporting sexual minority students and their heterosexual allies and also reducing prejudice, discrimination, and harassment within the school. Multiple studies have found evidence to support that GSAs are capable of reducing violence, bullying, aggression, and suicide attempts within the student population as a whole, but had the most pronounced effects on LGBT-identified students. Poteat, V. Paul et al. ‚ÄúGay‚ÄìStraight Alliances Are Associated With Student Health: A Multischool Comparison of LGBTQ and Heterosexual Youth.‚Äù Journal of Research on Adolescence 23.2 (2013): 319‚Äì330.

Web. Very few countries have education sector policies that address homophobic and transphobic violence or include sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in curricula or learning materials. In most countries, staff lack training and support to address sexual orientation and gender identity/expression and to prevent and respond to homophobic and transphobic violence. Although many countries provide support for students who experience violence, services are often ill-equipped to deal with homophobic and transphobic violence. Few countries collect data on the nature, prevalence or impact of homophobic and transphobic violence, which contributes to low awareness of the problem and lack of evidence for planning effective responses. In general terms, the range of responses to homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings appears to correlate to a country's: socio-cultural context (in terms of the society's beliefs and attitudes towards sexual and gender diversity, as well as to human rights and gender equality); and legal context (in terms of the rights of LGBTI individuals and the situation of human rights in general).  Policy approaches  Few countries have developed education sector policies to prevent and address homophobic and transphobic violence in schools, reflecting the fact that recognition of the prevalence and harmful impact of such violence in the sector is a relatively recent development. Most countries that have developed policies have taken one of the two following approaches: * Integrating references to sexual orientation and gender identity or to homophobic and transphobic discrimination and violence into existing education sector policies on general violence, bullying or discrimination. * Developing specific education sector policies that focus on violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. The first approach aims to protect and support LGBTI students by mainstreaming issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity into broader policies to prevent and address discrimination and violence. However, available data suggest that in countries where policies do not clearly refer to homophobic and transphobic violence, this form of violence may not be addressed by schools. For example, a large-scale qualitative research study conducted in 19 European countries in 2013 by the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency concluded that: 'Where anti-bullying measures are in place, these are often generic and they may be ineffective in dealing specifically with bullying on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. FRA, Professionally speaking: challenges to achieving equality for LGBT people. Vienna - Austria: European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2016. The second approach requires political leadership and a legal environment that is conducive to the protection of the rights of LGBTI people. A number of countries have developed specific education sector policies that address homophobic and transphobic violence in schools and other educational settings. Work conducted in countering violence in schools, in general, has shown that 'school and system-wide interventions', often referred to as 'whole school' strategies or approaches, are particularly effective. The same applies to education sector responses to homophobic and transphobic violence. In this report, 'whole school' responses to homophobic and transphobic violence are also referred to as 'comprehensive' education sector responses, which can also be referred to as 'holistic', 'systematic', 'systemic', 'system-wide'. These types of approaches are usually most effective when they are implemented within the scope of interacting with the community as a whole. Through a systematic approach, the intended impact is not strictly limited to campus grounds but permeates the barriers between the school and its surrounding populace. Often, aggression and violence does not occur in isolated instances, but rather occurs as a product of the school's negative climate which may endorse or even encourage bullying and/or aggression. Reviews of existing programs that encompass the participation of the students, teachers, and community as a whole have demonstrated their ability in preventing and reducing suicide attempts and peer-to-peer aggression. O‚ÄôMalley Olsen, Emily et al. ‚ÄúSchool Violence and Bullying Among Sexual Minority High School Students, 2009‚Äì2011.‚Äù Journal of Adolescent Health 55.3 (2014): 432‚Äì438. Web.  National policies  Progress in implementing measures to prevent and address homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings varies between regions and countries. The most comprehensive initiatives are being implemented in Australia and New Zealand, Canada and the United States, and a number of countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America. However, the education sector response has been limited in the majority of countries in the world, particularly in Africa, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Central Asia and some areas of the Pacific. In addition, it is important to note that many countries do not have comprehensive strategies to prevent and address violence in schools in general. National legislation against discrimination (as a whole) has served as a basis to develop national policies ‚Äì which either include, or are specific to, the education sector ‚Äì that address discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. In general, the education sector tends to address homophobic and transphobic violence through wider policies on violence, such as those related to bullying in schools or safe schools. = Asia = In Asia, the Philippines is the only country to include specific references to violence on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in a national law (2013).UNESCO, 'From Insult to Inclusion: Asia-Pacific report on school bullying, violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity', UNESCO, Paris and Bangkok, 2015. In Japan, in 2015, the Ministry of Education issued landmark guidance urging local education boards to ensure that schools cater to the needs of LGBT students. At a more local level, the 2004 Gender Equity Education Act in Taiwan of China seeks to eliminate gender stereotypes from the curriculum and prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in schools. However, a regional report developed for this review notes that implementation measures for this Act may be inadequate to effectively prevent and address discrimination. All other countries in the Asia region, apart from Pakistan, have legal or policy frameworks to address violence in educational institutions or the health of minors, although they vary in their nature and jurisdiction. In India, following a 2014 ruling by the Supreme Court recognizing the status of Hijras, the University Grants Commission called on all universities to recognize transgender students and to include a transgender category on all application forms, academic testimonials and official documents.UNESCO, 'Asia-Pacific Consultation on School Bullying based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity / Expression - Meeting Report', UNESCO, Bangkok, Thailand, 2015. = North America = In 2002, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that LGBT students and same-sex parents had the right to be safe from discrimination and to see their lives reflected in the school curriculum.Supreme Court Judgements, 'Chamberlain v.

The Ontario Education Act of Canada was amended in 2012 to specifically integrate attention to homophobic bullying following several years of amendments to Safe School legislation.Legislative Assembly of Ontario, 'Bill 13, Accepting Schools Act', 2012. [Online]. Available: http://ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&BillID;=2549. [Accessed: 23-Sep- 2015]. The Act strengthened legal obligations for school boards to foster positive school environments and to prevent and address inappropriate student behaviour, including homophobic or transphobic violence. For example, principals must suspend students and consider expulsion for misbehaviour that is motivated by bias, prejudice or hatred, including that which is based on gender, sexual orientation or gender identity/expression. School boards must provide support for victims of bullying, witnesses and perpetrators. In Quebec, legislation was adopted in 2012 for schools to provide healthy and safe learning environments, allowing every student to develop their full potential regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity/expression.Assembl√©e nationale du Qu√©bec, 'Bill 56: An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools', 2015.

In the United States, LGBT students are not protected under federal legislation. However, in 2010, the Department of Education issued guidance to specify that federal provisions outlawing discrimination on the basis of sex in education (Title IX) also offered some protection against bullying on the basis of sexual orientation.U.S. Department of Education, 'Dear Colleague Letter', 2010. [Online]. Available: http:// www2.ed.gov/about/of ces/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201010.html. [Accessed: 12-Jul- 2015]. In 2014, it extended this protection on the grounds of gender identity.U.S. Department of Education, 'Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence', 2014. [Online]. Available: http://www2.ed.gov/about/of ces/list/ocr/docs/qa-201404-title- ix.pdf. [Accessed: 12-Oct-2015]. The Department of Justice also clarified that transgender students must be allowed to use restrooms that correspond to their gender identity and that failure to do so amounts to sex discrimination under Title IX. In May 2016, the Department of Education released Examples of Policies and Emerging Practices for Supporting Transgender Students. The document has a list of questions and answers for schools and educators concerning Student transitions, Privacy, Confidentiality, and Student Records, Sex-Segregated Activities and Facilities, Additional Practices to Support Transgender Students, Terminology, Cited Policies on Transgender Students, and Select Federal Resources on Transgender Students. On February 22, 2017, the U.S. Department of Education withdrew statements of support and guidance previously issued in the Letter to Emily Prince from James A. Ferg-Cadima, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy, Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education dated January 7, 2015 and the Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students jointly issued by the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice and the Department of Education dated May 13, 2016. = Latin America = In Latin America and the Caribbean, Argentina is the only country that offers a full normative framework to tackle sexual orientation and gender identity/expression issues in educational contexts through the National Law on Integral Sexuality Education (2006) (26.150), the National Law on Education (2006) (26.206), the National Law for the Promotion of Coexistence and Tackling Social Conflict in Educational Institutions (2013) (26.892) and a federal guide for educational responses for addressing challenging situations linked to school life. The guide also contains a specific section on discrimination and harassment due to sexual orientation or gender identity/expression. In 2015, the Constitutional Court of Colombia and the Supreme Court of Mexico found that bullying undermined victims' dignity, integrity and educationUNESCO Santiago, 'La violencia homof√≥bica y transf√≥bica en el √°mbito escolar: hacia centros educativos inclusivos y seguros en Am√©rica Latina', UNESCO, Santiago, 2015. and that the education sector had a direct duty to protect students from violence based on their personal characteristics. In Uruguay, the General Law on Education (2014) includes a general reference to non-discrimination due to sexual orientation. In El Salvador, the General Law on Youth, while not referring to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression, recognizes and guarantees the right to integral comprehensive sexuality education (2013). Also, the General Law on Education's article 5-A condemns inequalities and discriminatory practices between or towards students when based on traditional gendered roles (1990). Other countries have instruments to prevent and counter discrimination or violence, including bullying. Examples include the following: In Chile, Law 20.609 (2012) and the Law on Education (2009) are in place to counter discrimination in general and can also be applied to a school setting. However, as none of the laws are LGBT-specific, addressing homophobic and transphobic violence is left at the discretion of individual schools. In Colombia, no specific policy exists to tackle homophobic and transphobic violence. Law 1620 (from 2013) and the Regulatory Decree (1965) establish minimal norms for applying the Integral Roadmap for Educational Community Living and its protocols, in order to prevent and mitigate situations affecting school community living and the exercising of human, sexual and reproductive rights. In Honduras, the Law Against Bullying was adopted in 2014. However, it does not refer to particular motives for bullying. In Peru, the General Law on Education (2003) establishes that integral sexuality education is part of the right to education. A Law promoting violence-free community living in educational institutions (29719) exists (2011), although it does not refer to homophobic or transphobic violence. Cuba, El Salvador, and Peru guarantee the right to comprehensive sexuality education, which should cover issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. As with other regions of the world, although these rights-based policies are on the statute books in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, a regional survey of 19 states ‚Äì conducted by the Inter- American Institute for Human Rights in 2011 ‚Äì noted that, in the majority of cases, they are not rigorously implemented and are 'always very general, dispersed, and in some cases ambiguous'.IIDH, 'Informe Interamericano de la Educaci√≥n en Derechos Humanos Un estudio en 19 pa√≠ses: Desarrollo en las pol√≠ticas de convivencia y seguridad escolar con enfoque de derechos', Instituto Interamericano de Derechos Humanos, San Jose, 2011. = Europe = In Europe, some countries have specific laws and policies to address homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings. In Belgium, the Flemish Ministry for Education and Equal Opportunities issued a Common Declaration for a Gender-Sensitive and LGBT Friendly Policy in Schools in 2012, establishing a framework for sexuality education and providing guidelines for schools to develop LGBT-inclusive policies.Flemish Department of Education, 'Gender aware and LGBT friendly policies in education', Brussels, 2012.Flemish Government, 'The Common Declaration for a Gender Sensitive and LGBT Friendly Policy in Schools', 2012. [Online]. Available: http://www.unece.org/ leadmin/DAM/env/ esd/11thMeetSC/Documents/2015_Good_practices_gender_in_ESD_BE_Flanders.pdf. [Accessed: 13-Aug-2012]. In France, although no national policy mentions homophobic and transphobic violence, the Ministry of Education's annual letter to principals has, since 2009, mentioned combating homophobia. Also, a 2012 governmental plan to combat homophobic and transphobic violence foresees specific actions in the education sector.Republique Fran√ßaise, 'Programme d'actions gouvernemental contre les violences et les discriminations commises √† raison de l'orientation sexuelle ou de l'identit√© de genre', Premier Ministre, 2012. In Portugal, the Students' Statute (2012) includes protection against discrimination based on both sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. In Sweden, the Discrimination Act (2009) explicitly bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in education and obliges pre-schools, schools, and universities to take proactive measures against violence. The United Kingdom's Equality Act (2010) makes it a duty for schools to advance equality for their LGBT students. The Act explicitly mentions sexual orientation and gender reassignment and mandates that every school should have a behavior policy preventing all forms of bullying.A. M. Mitchell, M. Gray, K. Green, and K. Beninger, 'What works in tackling homophobic, biphobic and transphobic (HBT) bullying among and young people? Evidence review and typology of initiatives', Government Equalities Of ce, London, 2014. In Turkey, there is very little in terms of representation for its LGBT communities within an educational context, often resulting in educational staff and students alike fearful of the consequences of coming out. The limited number of LGBTs in education, employment, and health care can be explained with reference to structural barriers against the coming out of LGBT individuals both to their peers at school and work.G√∂√ßmen, ƒ∞pek, and Volkan Yƒ±lmaz. ‚ÄúExploring Perceived Discrimination Among LGBT Individuals in Turkey in Education, Employment, and Health Care: Results of an Online Survey.‚Äù Journal of Homosexuality 64.8 (2017): 1052‚Äì1068. Web. = The Pacific = In the Pacific, Australia's 2013 Sex Discrimination Act (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) builds on previous state-level legislation and provides protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity/expression and intersex status (although some exemptions exist for some religious schools).T. Jones, Policy and Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Students. Cham, Heidelberg, New York, Dordrecht and London: Springer International Publishing, 2015. Also in Australia, the State of Victoria's Department of Education and Early Childhood Development provides guidance to support sexual diversity in schools.DoEECD, 'Supporting Sexual Diversity in schools', Student Wellbeing & Health Support Division Of ce for Government School Education Department of Education and Early Childhood Development Melbourne, Melbourne, State of Victoria, 2008. In Fiji, the 2015 Policy on Child Protection in Schools requires schools to respect children's sexual orientation and to take action against bullying, including homophobic bullying. In New Zealand, the Ministry of Education published a Guide for Sexuality Education (2015) stating that school anti-bullying procedures should directly address bullying related to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression and that these incidents should be recorded as such and monitored. The comprehensive guidance also touches upon the curriculum, school uniforms, restroom facilities, procedures and policies in sports and extra- curricular activities. Other countries in the region offer limited protection from school-related violence. Papua New Guinea alone specifically forbids such practice, while other countries protect children's health in general or offer only limited protection to children (in Tonga). = Africa = In Africa, a review of policies on gender, diversity and violence in schools in Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland ‚Äì conducted within the study supported by UNESCO in 2015 ‚Äì found that countries have generic legal and policy frameworks (including in education) that provide a conducive environment to address violence in schools. In Lesotho and Swaziland, they are mostly related to child protection. Swaziland has an education sector policy where Schools as Centres of Care and Support (SCCS) are supposed to be 'protective and secure environments that accommodate all learners'. In Botswana and Namibia, Education for All National Action Plans and other education policies clearly mention inclusive and non-discriminatory education. However, none of these policies make reference to sexual and gender diversity, except for South Africa.UNESCO, 'Gender, diversity and violence in schools in five countries in Southern Africa: Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland (draft)', UNESCO, 2015. Only South Africa has explicit policies to deal with homophobic bullying in education. The UNESCO-supported study found that, in interview, national policy-makers in Southern Africa suggest that the overall absence of specific policies may reflect the lack of reliable evidence on the nature, prevalence and impact of homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings in the region, or that it is not considered a political priority. Where specific national legislation or policies (including in the education sector) are lacking, other entry points may exist to address homophobic and transphobic violence in educational institutions. These include international or regional human rights frameworks, but also general laws and policies against violence in educational institutions (for which additional guidance can be produced to detail how they apply to homophobic and transphobic violence). Finally, national anti-discrimination laws in Southern Africa (whether or not they mention sexual orientation and gender identity/expression) may also provide good entry points for the education sector to consider adopting new policies or upgrading existing ones.  Relevant curricula and learning materials  The second element of a comprehensive response to homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings is relevant curricula and learning materials. Through their content and the way that they are delivered, curricula, learning materials and extra- curricular activities in educational settings ‚Äì such as sports or theatre ‚Äì convey influential messages about 'normality', legitimacy and power. Curricula are never neutral. Those that do not feature sexual and gender diversity convey the implicit message that people with diverse sexual orientations and gender identities/expressions are not part of society. Worse still, some curricula may explicitly convey negative messages about LGBTI people. Curricula generally take one of four approaches for sexual and gender diversity: * Hostile' curricula: i.e. they explicitly convey negative messages about LGBTI people, which reinforce negative gender stereotypes and contribute to homophobic and transphobic violence. For example, textbooks were withdrawn by the government in Croatia (in 2009) and Macedonia (in 2010) because they described homosexuality as a disease. * Non-inclusive' curricula: These omit any representation of sexual and gender diversity in their materials and, for example, ignore these aspects when discussing historical figures who were LGBTI. This has the result of rendering LGBTI people 'invisible'. Most curricula worldwide fall into this category. * Inclusive' curricula: These convey implicit positive messages about sexual and gender diversity when they promote the human rights of all, regardless of personal characteristics including sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. These curricula are likely to also encourage gender equality. * Affirming' curricula: These convey explicit positive messages about sexual and gender diversity by featuring positive representations of LGBTI people and explicitly affirming their equality in dignity and rights. They provide educators with clear guidelines and examples on how to refer to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in a sensitive way. Hostile and non-inclusive curricula tend to exist in contexts where homophobia and transphobia are widespread. They do nothing to prevent or reduce violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. On the contrary, hostile curricula contribute to reinforcing stereotypical and patriarchal views of gender ‚Äì indirectly leading to homophobic and transphobic violence. Meanwhile, by not challenging these stereotypical and patriarchal views, non-inclusive curricula also contribute to homophobic and transphobic violence in educational institutions. In contrast, inclusive or affirming curricula may discuss definitions of masculinity and femininity and challenge existing stereotypes about gender and sexuality ‚Äì contributing to increasing LGBTI students' feeling of belonging and safety.J. Kosciw, E. A. Greytak, N. A. Palmer, and M. J. Boesen, 'The 2013 National School Climate Survey: The experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Youth in Our Nation's Schools', Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network, New York, 2014.F. Bucx, F. Van Der Sman, and C. Jalvingh, 'Different class - Evaluation of the pilot Social safety of LGBT children at school: Summary and Conclusions', The Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, 2014. Research suggests that curricula featuring sexual orientation and gender identity/expression positively impact students' and teachers' beliefs and attitudes, encouraging critical thinking and increasing feelings of safety at school. They also help to address violence. The literature confirms that challenging homophobia and transphobia in education is most effective when LGBTI issues are reflected and featured through teaching and lesson plans, and when LGBTI people are positively portrayed across the curriculum.I.

However, it has been observed that teachers are generally limited in their knowledge of this particular subject.Swanson, K. M. (2015).

In the 2010s, Zelyonka attacks became widespread in Russia and Ukraine by pro-government operatives against anti- government political and other personalities. Zelyonka dye Zelyonka is a triarylmethane antiseptic dye that was widely used medically up until the decline of the Soviet Union. The dye, often used as a milder alternative to iodine, is still available in Russian pharmacies and drug stores. The dye is very hard to wash off and can leave a stain for days afterwards, and requires an acid to fully remove. However, unless zelyonka is mixed with other substances (e.g. as with the second attack on Alexei Navalny), it leaves no long-term damage, and thus victims have little legal recourse.  Victims and influence  The use of the dye was associated with pro-Kremlin forces, although it was never directly tied to the Kremlin government. The victims of zelyonka attacks were almost always Russian opposition leaders: including Sergey Mitrokhin, Mikhail Kasyanov, Alexei Navalny ‚Äî and Ukrainian politicians (Arsen Avakov, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, Oleh Lyashko). As a result of numerous attacks, part of the Russian opposition leaders began to use zelyonka and green color as a \\"badge of honor\\". After Navalny was attacked in Barnaul, dozens of his supporters posted online photos of themselves \\"in green\\" (#GreenNavalny), and blogger Nikolai Danilov, who came to Red Square with a face covered with green colour, was detained by the police. When Kasyanov was attacked on the Nemtsov memorial march, the demonstrants began to cry out: \\"You won't pour zelyonka over us!\\" On May 4, 2017, Alexei Navalny stated that the incidents involving zelyonka helped to raise money to his fund. On the same day, Russian poet Dmitry Bykov published a poem \\"Vivat, Green Russia!\\", in which green color was named as the color of \\"Russian revolution\\". The numerous attacks on Russian anti-government political and media personalities, accompanied by photographs of people who were poured with the dye, forced the Russian media to explain to their readers, most of whom are not familiar with the brilliant green dye, just what \\"zelyonka\\" is, and what has been happening.

President Donald Trump nominated her to the Seventh Circuit on May 8, 2017, and the Senate held a confirmation vote on October 31, 2017. Before and while serving on the federal bench, she has been a professor of law at Notre Dame Law School, where she has taught civil procedure, constitutional law, and statutory interpretation.Wolf, Richard. Notre Dame's Amy Coney Barrett likely a front-runner for Supreme Court vacancy , South Bend Tribune, September 19, 2020. Retrieved September 19, 2020. Eleven months after her confirmation to the Seventh Circuit, Barrett was added to Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees. On September 26, 2020, Trump nominated Barrett to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the United States Supreme Court.  Early life and education  Barrett was born Amy Vivian Coney in New Orleans, Louisiana. She is the eldest of seven children and has five sisters and a brother. Her father, Michael Coney, worked as an attorney for Shell Oil Company and her mother, Linda, was a high school French teacher and homemaker. Barrett is of French descent. Her great-great-grandparents emigrated from France to New Orleans. Her family were devout Catholics, and her father has been an ordained deacon since 1982. Barrett grew up in Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans. She attended St. Mary's Dominican High School, an all-girls Roman Catholic high school, from which she graduated in 1990. She was student body vice president in high school. After high school, Barrett attended Rhodes College, where she majored in English literature and minored in French. She graduated magna cum laude in 1994 with a Bachelor of Arts degree and was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa and Phi Beta Kappa. In her graduating class, she was named most outstanding English department graduate. She then studied law at the Notre Dame Law School on a full-tuition scholarship. She was an executive editor of the Notre Dame Law ReviewAmy Howe, Profile of a potential nominee: Amy Coney Barrett , SCOTUSblog (September 21, 2020). and graduated first in her class in 1997 with a Juris Doctor summa cum laude.  Career  = Clerkships and private practice = Coney spent two years as a judicial law clerk after law school, first for Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1997 to 1998, and then for Justice Antonin Scalia of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1998 to 1999. From 1999 to 2002, Barrett practiced law at Miller, Cassidy, Larroca & Lewin, a boutique law firm for litigation in Washington, D.C., that merged with the Houston, Texas-based law firm Baker Botts in 2001. While at Baker Botts, she worked on Bush v. Gore, the lawsuit that grew out of the 2000 United States presidential election, providing research and briefing assistance for Baker Botts's representation of George W. Bush. = Teaching and scholarship = Barrett served as a visiting associate professor and John M. Olin Fellow in Law at George Washington University Law School for a year before returning to her alma mater, Notre Dame Law School, in 2002. At Notre Dame, she taught federal courts, constitutional law, and statutory interpretation. In 2007, she was a visiting professor at the University of Virginia School of Law. Barrett was named a Professor of Law in 2010, and from 2014 to 2017 held the Diane and M.O. Miller II Research Chair of Law. Her scholarship focused on constitutional law, originalism, statutory interpretation, and stare decisis. Her academic work has been published in the Columbia, Cornell, Virginia, Notre Dame, and Texas law reviews. At Notre Dame, Barrett received the \\"Distinguished Professor of the Year\\" award three times. From 2011 to 2016, she spoke on constitutional law at Blackstone Legal Fellowship, a summer program for law school students that the Alliance Defending Freedom established for inspiring a \\"distinctly Christian worldview in every area of law\\". While serving on the Seventh Circuit, Barrett commuted between Chicago and South Bend, continuing to teach courses on statutory interpretation and constitutional theory. In 2010, Chief Justice John Roberts appointed Barrett to serve on the Advisory Committee for the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. = Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit =  Nomination and confirmation  alt= On May 8, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Barrett to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit after Judge John Daniel Tinder took senior status. A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on her nomination was held on September 6, 2017. During the hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein questioned Barrett about a law review article Barrett co-wrote in 1998 with Professor John H. Garvey in which they argued that Catholic judges should in some cases recuse themselves from death penalty cases due to their moral objections to the death penalty. Asked to \\"elaborate on the statements and discuss how you view the issue of faith versus fulfilling the responsibility as a judge today,\\" Barrett said that she had participated in many death-penalty appeals while serving as law clerk to Scalia, adding, \\"My personal church affiliation or my religious belief would not bear on the discharge of my duties as a judge\\" and \\"It is never appropriate for a judge to impose that judge's personal convictions, whether they arise from faith or anywhere else, on the law.\\" Barrett emphasized that the article was written in her third year in law school and that she was \\"very much the junior partner in our collaboration.\\" Worried that Barrett would not uphold Roe v. Wade given her Catholic beliefs, Feinstein followed Barrett's response by saying, \\"the dogma lives loudly within you, and that is a concern.\\" The hearing made Barrett popular with religious conservatives. Feinstein's and other senators' questioning was criticized by some Republicans and other observers, such as university presidents John I. Jenkins and Christopher Eisgruber, as an improper inquiry into a nominee's religious belief that employed an unconstitutional \\"religious test\\" for office; others, such as Nan Aron, defended Feinstein's line of questioning. Judge Laurence Silberman, for whom Barrett first clerked after law school, swearing her in at her alt= Lambda Legal, an LGBT civil rights organization co-signed a letter with 26 other gay rights organizations opposing Barrett's nomination. The letter expressed doubts about her ability to separate faith from her rulings on LGBT matters. During her Senate hearing, Barrett was questioned about landmark LGBTQ legal precedents such as Obergefell v. Hodges, United States v. Windsor, and Lawrence v. Texas. She said these cases are \\"binding precedents\\" that she intended to \\"faithfully follow if confirmed\\" to the appeals court, as required by law. The letter Lambda Legal co-signed read, \\"Simply repeating that she would be bound by Supreme Court precedent does not illuminate‚Äîindeed, it obfuscates‚Äîhow Professor Barrett would interpret and apply precedent when faced with the sorts of dilemmas that, in her view, 'put Catholic judges in a bind.'\\" In 2015, Barrett signed a letter to the Synod on the Family affirming the Catholic Church's teaching that \\"marriage and family [are] founded on the indissoluble commitment of a man and a woman\\". Barrett's nomination was supported by every law clerk she had worked with and all of her 49 faculty colleagues at Notre Dame Law school. 450 former students signed a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee supporting her nomination. On October 5, 2017, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11‚Äì9 on party lines to recommend Barrett and report her nomination to the full Senate. On October 30, the Senate invoked cloture by a vote of 54‚Äì42. It confirmed her by a vote of 55‚Äì43 on October 31, with three Democrats‚ÄîJoe Donnelly, Tim Kaine, and Joe Manchin‚Äîvoting for her. She received her commission two days later. Barrett is the first and only woman to occupy an Indiana seat on the Seventh Circuit. = Selected cases = On the Seventh Circuit, Barrett wrote 79 majority opinions (including two that were amended and one that was withdrawn on rehearing), four concurring opinions (one a per curiam opinion), and six dissenting opinions (six published and one in an unpublished order).  Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972  In June 2019, the court, in a unanimous decision written by Barrett, reinstated a suit brought by a male Purdue University student (John Doe) who had been found guilty of sexual assault by Purdue University, which resulted in a one-year suspension, loss of his Navy ROTC scholarship, and expulsion from the ROTC affecting his ability to pursue his chosen career in the Navy. Doe alleged the school's Advisory Committee on Equity discriminated against him on the basis of his sex and violated his rights to due process by not interviewing the alleged victim, not allowing him to present evidence in his defense, including an erroneous statement that he confessed to some of the alleged assault, and appearing to believe the victim instead of the accused without hearing from either party or having even read the investigation report. The court found that Doe had adequately alleged that the university deprived him of his occupational liberty without due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and had violated his Title IX rights \\"by imposing a punishment infected by sex bias\\", and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.  Employment discrimination In 2017, the Seventh Circuit rejected the federal government's appeal in a civil lawsuit against AutoZone; the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission argued that AutoZone's assignment of employees to different stores based on race (e.g., \\"sending African American employees to stores in heavily African American neighborhoods\\") violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Following this, Barrett joined the court as it received a petition for rehearing en banc. Three judges--Chief Judge Diane Wood and Judges Ilana Rovner and David Hamilton--voted to grant rehearing, and criticized the three-judge panel's opinion as upholding a \\"separate-but-equal arrangement\\". Barrett did not join the panel opinion, but voted with four judges to deny the petition to rehear the case. The petition was unsuccessful by a 5-3 decision. In 2019, Barrett wrote the unanimous three-judge panel opinion affirming summary judgment in the case of Smith v. Illinois Department of Transportation. Smith was a black employee who claimed racial discrimination upon his dismissal by the department and that he was called a \\"stupid ass ni[]\\" by a black supervisor; the department claimed Smith failed work-level expectations during probationary periods. Barrett wrote that usage of the racial slur was egregious, but Smith's testimony showed no evidence that his subjective experience of the workplace changed because of the slur, nor did it change the department's fact that his discharge was related to \\"poor performance\\".  Immigration  In June 2020, Barrett wrote a 40-page dissent when the majority upheld a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration's controversial \\"public charge rule\\", which heightened the standard for obtaining a green card. In her dissent, she argued that any noncitizens who disenrolled from government benefits because of the rule did so due to confusion about the rule itself rather than from its application, writing that the vast majority of the people subject to the rule are not eligible for government benefits in the first place. On the merits, Barrett departed from her colleagues Wood and Rovner, who held that DHS's interpretation of that provision was unreasonable under Chevron Step Two. Barrett would have held that the new rule fell within the broad scope of discretion granted to the Executive by Congress through the Immigration and Nationality Act. The public charge issue is the subject of a circuit split. In May 2019, the court rejected a Yemeni citizen and her U.S. citizen husband's challenge to a consular officer's decision to twice deny her visa application under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The U.S. citizen argued that this had deprived him of a constitutional right to live in the United States with his spouse., en banc rev. denied, 924 F.3d 969 (7th Cir. 2019) (per curiam). In a 2-1 majority opinion authored by Barrett, the court held that the plaintiff's claim was properly dismissed under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability. Barrett declined to address whether the husband had been denied a constitutional right (or whether the constitutional right to live in the United States with his spouse existed at all) because the consular officer's decision to deny the visa application was facially legitimate and bona fide, and under Supreme Court precedent, in such a case courts will not \\"look behind the exercise of that discretion\\". The dispute concerned what it takes to satisfy this standard. A petition for rehearing en banc was denied, with Chief Judge Wood, joined by Judges Rovner and Hamilton, dissenting. Barrett wrote a rare opinion concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc (joined by Judge Joel Flaum).  Abortion-related cases Barrett has never ruled directly on abortion, but she did vote to rehear a successful challenge to Indiana's parental notification law in 2019. In 2018, she voted against striking down another Indiana law requiring burial or cremation of fetal remains. In both cases, Barrett voted with the minority. The Supreme Court later reinstated the fetal remains law, and in July 2020 it ordered a rehearing in the parental notification case. In February 2019, Barrett joined a unanimous panel decision upholding a Chicago \\"bubble ordinance\\" that prohibits approaching within a certain distance of an abortion clinic or its patrons without consent. Citing the Supreme Court's buffer zone decision in Hill v. Colorado, the court rejected the plaintiffs' challenge to the ordinance on First Amendment grounds.  Second Amendment  In March 2019, Barrett dissented when the court upheld a law prohibiting felons from possessing firearms. The majority rejected the as-applied challenge raised by the plaintiff, who had a nonviolent felony conviction for mail fraud, and upheld the felony dispossession statute as \\"substantially related to an important government interest in preventing gun violence.\\" In her dissent, Barrett argued that while the government has a legitimate interest in denying gun possession to felons convicted of violent crimes, there is no evidence that denying guns to nonviolent felons promotes this interest, and that the law violates the Second Amendment. Criminal procedure In May 2018, Barrett dissented when the panel majority found that an accused murderer's right to counsel was violated when the state trial judge directly questioned the accused while forbidding his attorney from speaking. Following rehearing en banc, a majority of the circuit's judges agreed with her position. In August 2018, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it determined that the police had lacked probable cause to search a vehicle based solely upon an anonymous tip that people were \\"playing with guns\\", because no crime had been alleged. Barrett distinguished Navarette v. California and wrote, \\"the police were right to respond to the anonymous call by coming to the parking lot to determine what was happening. But determining what was happening and immediately seizing people upon arrival are two different things, and the latter was premature...Watson's case presents a close call. But this one falls on the wrong side of the Fourth Amendment.\\" In February 2019, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it found that police officers had been unreasonable to assume \\"that a woman who answers the door in a bathrobe has authority to consent to a search of a male suspect's residence.\\" Therefore, the district court should have granted the defendant's motion to suppress evidence found in the residence as the fruit of an unconstitutional search.  Qualified immunity  In January 2019, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it denied qualified immunity to a civil lawsuit sought by a defendant who as a homicide detective had knowingly provided false and misleading information in the probable cause affidavit that was used to obtain an arrest warrant for the plaintiff. (The charges were later dropped and the plaintiff was released.) The court found the defendant's lies and omissions violated \\"clearly established law\\" and the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights and thus the detective was not shielded by qualified immunity. In Howard v. Koeller (7th Cir. 2018), in an unsigned order by a three-judge panel that included Barrett, the court found that qualified immunity did not protect a prison officer who had labeled a prisoner a \\"snitch\\" and thereby exposed him to risk from his fellow inmates.  Environment  In Orchard Hill Building Co. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 893 F.3d 1017 (7th Cir. 2018), Barrett joined a unanimous panel decision, written by Judge Amy J. St. Eve, in a case brought by a property developer challenging the Corps' determination that a wetland from the nearest navigable river was among the \\"waters of the United States.\\" The court found that the Corps had not provided substantial evidence of a significant nexus to navigable‚Äêin‚Äêfact waters under Justice Kennedy's concurrence in the Supreme Court's decision in Rapanos v. United States. The case was remanded to the Corps to reconsider whether such a significant nexus exists between the wetlands in question and navigable waters for it to maintain jurisdiction over the land.  Consumer protection  In June 2018, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it found that a plaintiff could not sue Teva Pharmaceuticals for alleged defects in her IUD due to the lack of supportive expert testimony, writing, \\"the issue of causation in her case is not obvious.\\"  Coronavirus measures  In early September 2020, Barrett joined Wood's opinion upholding the district court's denial of the Illinois Republican Party's request for a preliminary injunction to block Governor J. B. Pritzker's COVID-19 orders.Illinois Republican Party v. Pritzker, No. 20-2175 (7th Cir. September 3, 2020). Civil procedure and standing In June 2019, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it found that the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act cannot create a cause of action for a debtor who received collection letters lacking notices required by the statute because she suffered no injury-in-fact to create constitutional standing to sue under Article III. Wood dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc. The issue created a circuit split. In August 2020, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it held that a Teamsters local did not have standing to appeal an order in the Shakman case because it was not formally a party to the case. The union had not intervened in the action, but rather merely submitted a memorandum in the district court opposing a motion, which the Seventh Circuit determined was insufficient to give the union a right to appeal.  Judicial philosophy, political views, speeches, and writings According to an analysis by University of Virginia law professors Joshua Fischman and Kevin Cope, Barrett was furthest to the right among 7th Circuit judges, though not statistically distinguishable from six other Republican-appointed judges on the court. Compared to the other judges on the 7th Circuit, she was particularly conservative on civil rights issues. = Textualism and originalism = Barrett is considered a textualist and an originalist (of the original-public- meaning, rather than original-intent, variety).Amy Coney Barrett & John Copeland Nagle, Congressional Originalism, 19 Journal of Constitutional Law (2016).Dylan Matthews, The legal theories of Amy Coney Barrett, explained: An expert explains originalism, the Roberts Court, and what a Justice Barrett might do., Vox (September 25, 2020). According to her, \\"Originalism is characterized by a commitment to two core principles. First, the meaning of the constitutional text is fixed at the time of its ratification. Second, the historical meaning of the text 'has legal significance and is authoritative in most circumstances.'\\" For the purpose of \\"describing the disagreement between originalists and nonoriginalists about the authoritativeness of the original public meaning,\\" she refers to a section of a law review article by Keith E. Whittington, \\"Originalism: A Critical Introduction\\", that reads, \\"Critics of originalism have suggested a range of considerations that might trump original meaning if the two were to come into conflict. From this perspective, fidelity to original meaning is not the chief goal of constitutional theory. ...Confronted with suitably unpleasant results, the nonoriginalist might posit that the original meaning should be sacrificed. Alternatively, we might think that contemporary public opinion should trump original meaning. ...Underlying all these considerations is a view that courts are authorized to impose constitutional rules other than those adopted by the constitutional drafters. ...the originalist must insist that judges not close their eyes to the discoverable meaning of the Constitution and announce some other constitutional rule to supersede it. It is at that point that the originalist and the nonoriginalist must part ways.\\" Textualism, Barrett says, requires that judges construe statutory language consistent with its \\"ordinary meaning\\": \\"The law is comprised of words‚Äîand textualists emphasize that words mean what they say, not what a judge thinks that they ought to say.\\" According to Barrett, \\"Textualism stands in contrast to purposivism, a method of statutory interpretation that was dominant through much of the 20th century.\\" If a court concludes that statutory language appears to be in tension with a statute's overarching goal, \\"purposivists argue that a judge should go with the goal rather than the text\\". For Barrett, textualism is not literalism, nor is it about rigid dictionary definitions. \\"It is about identifying the plain communicative content of the words\\". Barrett clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, and has spoken and written of her admiration of his adherence to the text of statutes and to originalism, writing: \\"His judicial philosophy is mine, too. A judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they may hold.\\" In one article she quoted Scalia on the importance of the original meaning of the Constitution: \\"The validity of government depends upon the consent of the governed ... [s]o what the people agreed to when they adopted the Constitution ... is what ought to govern us.\\" In a 2017 article in the law review Constitutional Commentary, reviewing a book by Randy E. Barnett, Barrett wrote: \\"The Constitution's original public meaning is important not because adhering to it limits judicial discretion, but because it is the law. ...The Constitution's meaning is fixed until lawfully changed; thus, the court must stick with the original public meaning of the text even if it rules out the preference of a current majority.\\" According to Barrett, textualists believe that when a court interprets the words of statutes, it should use the most natural meaning of those words to an ordinary skilled user of words at the time, even if the court believes that the legislature intended that the words be understood in a different sense. If the legislature wishes the words of a statute to carry a meaning different from how a non-legislator would understand them, it is free to define the terms in the statute. As Scalia put it, \\"[A]ll we can know is that [the legislature] voted for a text that they presumably thought would be read the same way any reasonable English speaker would read it.\\" Scalia insisted that \\"it is simply incompatible with democratic government, or indeed, even with fair government, to have the meaning of a law determined by what the lawgiver meant, rather than by what the lawmaker promulgated.\\" Barrett has been critical of legal process theory, which gives a more expansive role to theory in shaping the interpretation of law than do textualism and originalism. She said that one example of the \\"process-based\\" approach can be found in King v. Burwell, in which the Supreme Court, for reasons related to the unorthodox legislative process that produced the Affordable Care Act, interpreted the phrase \\"Exchange established by the State\\" to mean \\"Exchange established by the State or the federal government.\\"  Suspension of habeas corpus  In a journal article, \\"Suspension and Delegation\\", Barrett noted that constitutionally only Congress has the authority to decide the terms under which habeas corpus may be legitimately suspended. In all but one of the previous suspensions of habeas corpus, Barrett thought that Congress violated the Constitution \\"by enacting a suspension statute before an invasion or rebellion occurred‚Äîand in some instances, before one was even on the horizon.\\" In an educational essay, she sided with the dissenters in Boumediene v. Bush after considering historical factors. = Precedent = At her 2017 Senate confirmation hearing for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, Barrett said she would follow Supreme Court precedent while on the appellate bench. In 2020, during her nomination acceptance speech at the White House Rose Garden, Barrett said, \\"Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold\\"; she also said judges \\"must apply the law as written\\". In a 2013 article in Texas Law Review on the doctrine of stare decisis, Barrett listed seven cases that she believed should be considered \\"superprecedents\\"‚Äîcases the court would never consider overturning. They included Brown v. Board of Education and Mapp v. Ohio (incorporating the Fourth Amendment onto the states), but specifically excluded Roe v. Wade (1973). In explaining why it was excluded, Barrett referenced scholarship agreeing that in order to qualify as \\"superprecedent\\", a decision must have widespread support from not only jurists but politicians and the public at large to the extent of becoming immune to reversal or challenge (for example, the constitutionality of paper money). She argued that the people must trust a ruling's validity to such an extent that the matter has been taken \\"off of the court's agenda\\", with lower courts no longer taking challenges to them seriously. Barrett pointed to Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) as evidence that Roe had not attained this status, and quoted Richard H. Fallon Jr.: \\"[A] decision as fiercely and enduringly contested as Roe v. Wade has acquired no immunity from serious judicial reconsideration, even if arguments for overruling it ought not succeed.\\" Concerning the relationship of textualism to precedent, Barrett said, \\"It makes sense that one committed to a textualist theory would more often find precedent in conflict with her interpretation of the Constitution than would one who takes a more flexible, all-things- considered approach.\\" She referenced a study by Michael Gerhardt which found that, as of 1994, no two justices in that century had called for overruling more precedents than Justices Scalia and Hugo Black, both of whom were textualists, even though Black was a liberal and Scalia a conservative. Gerhardt also found that during the Rehnquist court's last 11 years, the average number of times a justice called for the overruling of precedent was higher for textualist justices, with one per year coming from Ginsburg (non- textualist) up to just over two per year from Thomas (textualist). Gerhardt wrote that not all the calls for overruling were related to textualism issues, and that one must be careful in the inferences one draws from the numbers, which \\"do not indicate either why or on what basis the justices urged overruling.\\" = Affordable Care Act = In 2012, Barrett signed a letter criticizing the Obama administration's approach to providing employees of religious institutions with birth control coverage without having the religious institutions pay for it. Barrett has been critical of the majority opinion written by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. in National Federation of Independent Businesses v. Sebelius (2012), which upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. She wrote in 2017: \\"Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power; had he treated the payment as the statute did‚Äîas a penalty‚Äîhe would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond Congress's commerce power.\\" = Abortion = Barrett personally opposes abortion. In 2006, she signed an advertisement placed by St. Joseph County Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, in a South Bend, Indiana newspaper. The ad read, \\"We, the following citizens of Michiana, oppose abortion on demand and defend the right to life from fertilization to natural death. Please continue to pray to end abortion.\\" An unsigned, second page of the advertisement read, \\"It's time to put an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade and restore laws that protect the lives of unborn children.\\"Ramesh Ponnuru, Barrett and That Pro-Life Ad, National Review (October 1, 2020).Siobhan Hughes & Brent Kendall, Supreme Court Nominee Amy Coney Barrett Signed Antiabortion Ad in 2006, The Wall Street Journal (October 1, 2020). In 2013, Barrett signed another ad against Roe v. Wade that appeared in Notre Dame's student newspaper and described the decision as having \\"killed 55 million unborn children\\". The same year, she spoke at two anti-abortion events at the university.  Supreme Court nomination  President Donald Trump nominated Barrett to the Supreme Court on September 26, 2020 Barrett has been on Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees since 2017, almost immediately after her court of appeals confirmation. In July 2018, after Anthony Kennedy's retirement announcement, she was reportedly one of three finalists Trump considered, along with Kavanaugh and Judge Raymond Kethledge.Mark Landler & Maggie Haberman, Brett Kavanaugh to Supreme Court , The New York Times (July 9, 2018). After Kavanaugh's selection, Barrett was viewed as a possible nominee for a future U.S. Supreme Court vacancy. Ginsburg died on September 18, 2020, and Barrett was widely mentioned as the front- runner to succeed her. On September 26, 2020, Trump nominated Barrett to the Supreme Court. Barrett's nomination was generally supported by Republicans, who have sought to confirm Barrett before Election Day.Nicholas Fandos & Emily Cochrane, With Friendly Visits to Republicans, Barrett Makes Her Capitol Debut, The New York Times (September 29, 2020). She is a favorite among the Christian right and social conservatives.Matthew Brown, Fact check: 'Kingdom of God' comment by SCOTUS contender Amy Coney Barrett lacks context in meme, USA Today (September 27, 2020): \\"Barrett is a conservative and a favorite among the religious right\\"Stephanie Kirchgaessner, Amy Coney Barrett: spotlight falls on secretive Catholic group People of Praise, The Guardian (September 26, 2020): \\"the Louisiana native and Notre Dame Law graduate, a favorite among Trump's evangelical Christian base\\" Democrats generally oppose the nomination, and are opposed to filling the court vacancy during the 2020 presidential election campaign, in which voting was already underway in many states at the time of the nomination proceedings. Democrats are angered by the move to fill the vacancy in a presidential election year, as the Senate Republican majority had blocked President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016, during the last year of his presidency.Adam Liptak & Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Shadow of Merrick Garland Hangs Over the Next Supreme Court Fight, The New York Times (September 19, 2020). In October, the American Bar Association rated Barrett \\"well qualified\\" for the Supreme Court opening, its highest rating.Wise, Lindsay (October 15, 2020). \\"Amy Coney Barrett's Character, Qualifications Discussed by Witnesses,\\" Wall Street Journal. Retrieved October 18, 2020. The ABA confines its evaluation to the qualities of \\"integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament\\". On October 5, Senator Lindsey Graham formally scheduled the confirmation hearing, which began on October 12 as planned and lasted four days.  Personal life  Barrett and her family with President Trump on September 26, 2020 Judge Barrett with her husband, Jesse In 1999, Barrett married fellow Notre Dame Law School graduate Jesse M. Barrett, a partner at SouthBank Legal - LaDue Curran & Kuehn LLC in South Bend, Indiana, and a law professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School.

In this system, parties and voters are arranged on a single axis from open (socially liberal and globalist) to closed (culturally conservative and protectionist). Each side draws from both traditionally left- and right-wing ideas and values. For example, \\"closed\\" parties usually hold conventionally right-wing views on social issues but may support the left-wing policies of market intervention and redistribution of wealth. Open parties can hold left-wing or progressive opinions on many issues but be staunchly in favour of the traditionally more rightist policies of free trade. Depending on context, open‚Äìclosed can be a replacement to left‚Äìright or a second axis on a political compass. A political realignment along these lines across the Western world has been described by political scientists in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, the Great Recession and the European migrant crisis, with mainstream left-wing and right-wing political parties shifting or falling behind populist parties and independents. Examples of votes described as having been fought on open-closed lines include the 2016 Brexit referendum, presidential elections in Austria in 2016, the United States in 2016 and France in 2017, and general elections in Poland in 2015 and the Netherlands in 2017.  Precursors and terminology  Prior to the development of socialism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the primary divide in British politics was between classical liberalism (Whiggism) and traditional conservatism (Toryism) as seen in debates about free trade and the Corn Laws, and James Kirkup, writing in the Daily Telegraph, has suggested that the open-closed split marks a return to this era of politics. In the United States, the rise of the socially-liberal New Left and socially-conservative religious right in the 1970s, and the subsequent \\"culture wars\\", marked the beginning of the open-closed cleavage. Fareed Zakaria, writing in the Washington Post, described the Nordic model of free market social democracy as another early example of open politics. Stephan Shakespeare, director of public opinion research at YouGov, identified the divide in an analysis of the party positions in the 2005 UK general election, but termed closed and open voters \\"drawbridge up\\" and \\"drawbridge down\\" respectively. The terms \\"open\\" and \\"closed\\" for this divide were first used by then-British prime minister Tony Blair in 2006, with reference to the horseshoe theory that far-left and far-right politics are similar in substance. Blair, who declared himself staunchly for \\"open\\", had overseen the development of the Third Way New Labour movement in 1990s and the schism in the Labour Party between \\"open\\" Blairites and \\"closed\\" traditional socialists has remained. Political analyst James Bloodworth criticised Blair's choice of terminology, describing \\"closed\\" as pejorative to those threatened by globalism and \\"open\\" as overly laudatory of the \\"Davos Man\\" type of globalist.  Rise and development  Although both are conservatives, the \\"open\\" Angela Merkel and \\"closed\\" Donald Trump fall at opposite ends of the spectrum Following the financial crisis and subsequent recession, plus the arrival of large numbers of refugees of the Syrian Civil War, populist political parties made significant gains across the European Union. In southern European countries, these tended to be anti-austerity left-wing parties such as Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain, while northern European countries saw anti- immigrant right-wing parties such as the UK Independence Party and the Alternative for Germany gain support. However all these parties shared a Eurosceptic and anti-elite viewpoint, and appealed to the \\"left-behind\\" who saw their livelihoods or communities as threatened by globalism and immigration. In 2015, Syriza became the largest party in the Parliament of Greece, while the right-wing populist Law and Justice became the first party since the fall of Communism to win an absolute majority in the Polish Sejm in elections the same year. At the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, the Leave option narrowly defeated the cross-party Remain option. The subsequent realignment of British politics saw the Conservatives, aligned with \\"Leave\\", and Liberal Democrats, aligned with \\"Remain\\", rise in the polls while Labour, which remained deeply divided between its open and closed wings, lost ground rapidly. Similar political developments followed in the United States in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, liberal and pro-globalism, faced two political opponents who both represented protectionist viewpoints from opposite ends of the left‚Äìright spectrum: Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist who challenged her in the primaries, and the Republican nominee Donald Trump, running on a nativist \\"America First\\" platform. Trump eventually triumphed, winning several Rust Belt states from the \\"Blue Wall\\" of Democratic safe states which had suffered deindustrialisation and economic deprivation. While \\"closed\\" politicians scored several electoral victories, another realignment in the political centre began in Europe, as cosmopolitan pro-European voters abandoned traditional parties of government and clustered around new liberal parties and independent politicians. In the Netherlands, where the closed anti-Islam and anti-European Party for Freedom (PVV) under Geert Wilders led opinion polls for much of the previous parliament, the liberal pro-EU Democrats 66 and the green GroenLinks positioned themselves as the main open opponents of the PVV. At the 2017 elections, all three parties made significant gains at the expense of the established parties. Alexander Van der Bellen, an independent formerly of The Greens, defeated the anti-immigrant Norbert Hofer of the Freedom Party of Austria in the 2016 Austrian presidential election, while Emmanuel Macron, a former member of the Socialists who described himself as \\"neither left nor right\\" and who founded his own party En Marche, defeated the Front National candidate Marine Le Pen in the 2017 French presidential election. In both cases, neither of the mainstream parties of left and right reached the second round of voting ‚Äì instead, each election saw an open centrist independent against a closed far-right party.  Open and closed policies  Although they can come from all sides of the left‚Äìright spectrum, closed parties share common ground on many issues, as likewise do open parties. = Immigration and social integration = Opposition to immigration is one of the starkest divides between open and closed parties. The closed position supports restrictions on migration, and prefers that immigrants integrate into the national culture. By contrast, the open position takes a more liberal stance on migration, and tolerates or even celebrates multiculturalism. Both left- wing and right-wing parties can be closed on the topic of immigration: the conservative Polish Law and Justice accuses immigrants of undermining Polish values and bringing in terrorists, while the socialist German Left Party considers immigrants a drain on the welfare state. Conversely, in the United Kingdom for example the Adam Smith Institute (a neoliberal right-wing organisation) and Vince Cable (a centre-left social democrat and former business secretary) stand together as some of the strongest defenders of immigration. = Trade and economic integration = Issues of international trade and international cooperation are another significant line of division between the two camps. In the open ideology, free trade and globalism is a net good, strengthening the national economy and providing jobs while cutting prices. In the closed ideology, free trade is detrimental to the national economy and encourages companies to offshore industries, resulting in lower wages and higher unemployment, as well as potentially threatening national culture. The closed attitude to globalism manifests in opposition to trade agreements such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, to military alliances such as NATO, and to supranational unions such as the EU, which are generally supported by the open side. = Elites and anti- establishmentism = Pro-closed politicians opposing free trade and immigration usually describe these as impositions from an existing political elite, either within the country or outside its borders, and campaign on an anti-establishment platform. In the most extreme case, this can cross over into conspiracism, alleging that shadowy figures are actively trying to harm the nation. = Identity = Identity politics plays a role in forming both the open and closed coalitions. Pro-closed voters tend to have a strong sense of national identity, while pro-open ones share a more cosmopolitan identity. This does not mean that all closed voters are racist, nor that all open voters are unpatriotic. Nationalist pride can be enhanced by the arrival of newcomers, if these assimilate to the national culture quickly. Conversely some open politicians, such as Jesse Klaver, leader of GroenLinks, and Emmanuel Macron, have succeeded in developing a patriotic alternative to nationalism in which tolerance and cooperation are themselves considered national values to be prized and protected.  Demographics of cleavage  Political scientists have identified several lines of cleavage between supporters of open and closed parties. Educational attainment was the strongest predictor of voting preference in the Brexit referendum and the 2016/2017 US, Dutch and French elections: in each case, those with low educational achievement were more likely to vote for the closed or populist option. This was described by the BBC as \\"one of the most remarkable features of the US election\\", as the Republican party usually performs well among university graduates. Income has been suggested as another dividing line: in the EU referendum, the bottom fifth of UK earners overwhelmingly voted for Brexit (68% Leave, 32% Remain) while a large majority of the top quarter voted against Brexit (39% Leave, 61% Remain). However, Trump performed better with middle class voters than with either the highest or lowest earners and, although a small wealth effect was seen among French voters, this disappeared when controlling for education. Pessimism and optimism also appear to be important psychological factors in determining whether a voter chooses an open or a closed candidate. Le Pen only took 20% of the vote of those who believed the situation would improve for the next generation, but over 40% among those who believed it would deteriorate. A majority of Leave voters agreed life in Britain is worse than it was thirty years ago, while a majority of Remain voters disagreed.

The R-matrix method is used in computational quantum mechanics to study scattering of positrons and electrons by atomic and molecular targets. The fundamental idea was originally introduced by Eugene Wigner and Leonard Eisenbud in the 1940s. The method works by fixed nuclei approximation, where the molecule's nuclei are considered fixed when collision occurs and the electronic part of the problem is solved. This information is then plugged into calculations which take into account nuclear motion. The UK Molecular R-Matrix codes were developed by the Collaborative Computational Project Q (CCPQ).  Software  The CCPQ and CCP2 have supported various incarnations of the UK Molecular R-matrix project for almost 40 years. The UK Molecular R-Matrix Group is actually a subgroup of CCP2, and their codes are maintained by Professor Jonathan Tennyson and his group of researchers. Advances in research have shown that the UK Molecular R-matrix codes can be used to explain scattering problems involving light molecular targets. Quantemol-N (QN) is software that allows the UK molecular R-matrix codes, which is used to model electron- polyatomic molecule interactions, to be employed quickly with reduced set-up times.

However, because of in Spain, the English-term \\"Prime Minister\\" is not used, this change of power is called in the country a presidential transition, because the Prime Minister of Spain is called Presidente del Gobierno de Espa√±a (President of the Government of Spain).Official web site of La Moncloa, the Spanish Prime Minister's Office Accessed 2009-03-05The Oxford Spanish Dictionary and Grammar, ed. C.Lea et al., 2nd ed.(2001) This is because when the first executive branch appeared in representation of the Monarch, it was called to the head of the government, President of the Council of Ministers. Election In Spain, the President is elected not by the people but for the Congress of the Deputies. In the General Elections, the different parties present a closed list of candidates to the Congress and people vote for each party and the full list. Normally, each party has his own candidate to presidency and this is normally, the leader of the closed list and the party. When the results come out, each party (if it has enough votes) wins seats (Esca√±os) on the Congress in proportion to the number of votes. Following the general election of the Cortes Generales (Cortes), and other circumstances provided for in the constitution, the king meets with and interviews the leaders of the parties represented in the Congress of Deputies, and then consults with the Speaker of the Congress of Deputies (officially, Presidente de Congreso de los Diputados de Espa√±a, who, in this instance, represents the whole of the Cortes Generales and was himself elected from within the Congress to be the Speaker) before nominating his candidate for the presidency, according to Section 99 of Title IV.Part IV Government and Administration Often minor parties form part of a larger major party, and through that membership it can be said that the king fulfills his constitutional mandate of consulting with party representatives with Congressional representation. > Title IV Government and Administration Section 99(1) & (2) *(1) After each > renewal of the Congress and the other cases provided for under the > Constitution, the King shall, after consultation with the representatives > appointed by the political groups with parliamentary representation, and > through the Speaker of the Congress, nominate for the Presidency of the > Government. *(2) The candidate nominated in accordance with the provisions > of the foregoing subsection shall submit to the Congress the political > program of the Government he or she intends to form and shall seek the > confidence of the House. After the Congress confirmation, the Speaker of the Congress formally reports to the king of the congressional confirmation. The king then appoints the candidate as the new President of the Government. The king's order of appointment is countersigned by the Speaker. During the inauguration ceremony performed by the king, customarily at the Sal√≥n de Audiencias in the Zarzuela Palace, the president elect of the Government takes an oath of office over an open constitution and next to the Bible. President Zapatero swearing the office on 2008 Presidents =Acting president= The acting president is the president that remains in office until the next president is sworn in or the current acting president is re-elected. The acting president does not have to be an outgoing president, however, his powers are limited by the Constitution. =Outgoing president= The outgoing president not presenting for re-election, he remains in office as a caretaker until their successor is sworn in. However, his powers are limited because his official term finished the day that he convoked the elections. In this way, many decisions are reserved for a legit and elected president. An example of this was the 2011 General Elections of Spain, when Outgoing President Zapatero wasn't presenting to re-election and he took care of the office until the elected president was sworn in.Rajoy y Zapatero se re√∫nen durante dos horas en la MoncloaActing President Zapatero =Elected president= The term elected president is not proper to the parliamentary system because the president is not elected directly by the people but for the Congress.

S√°enz de Santamar√≠a giving the briefcase to the incoming Deputy PM Calvo. Powers transition After the President's confirmation in the Congress, he becomes the official President of the Government. The powers transition is just a solemnly act because the outgoing president is not the president or acting president anymore. The new president normally meets the outgoing president at the Moncloa (presidential palace and headquarters of the government) and after a talk, they go to the main door in front of the media and the outgoing president gives the president the presidential briefcase as a symbol of a transition of power.Rajoy y Zapatero comienzan el traspaso de poderes con dos horas de encuentro en Moncloa The Ministers do the same with their respectives briefcases.

Together with Harry Voss, Rijhiner remains one of only two Surinamese soldiers to have been awarded the Military William Order.  Biography  Rijhiner joined the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) in the 1920s. After he was promoted to sub-lieutenant on 24 June 1939, Rijhiner was granted a temporary leave from the military and subsequently left the Dutch East Indies for the Netherlands, with the intention to travel onwards to Suriname. While he was in the Netherlands, the Second World War broke out, and Rijhiner was mobilized for the war effort in Europe. During the Battle of Rotterdam, Rijhiner was responsible for the defence of an ammunition depot in Overschie. While inspecting his troops on 12 May 1940, Rijhiner was shot in his left thigh by friendly fire, presumably because his wearing a KNIL uniform with a Dutch army coat and helmet was considered suspicious by one of the soldiers. Despite being wounded, and against the advice of his superiors, Rijhiner moved back to the front the next day, to defend the ammunition depot. This move was the basis for the decision to award Rijhiner with the Military William Order, which was promulgated by royal decree by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands on 26 June 1946. After the surrender of the Dutch army on 14 May 1940, Rijhiner went into hiding and joined the Dutch resistance while adopting the hiding name \\"Reinier\\". He was eventually apprehended by the Sicherheitsdienst and after a short incarceration at Scheveningen prison sent to a camp in Darmstadt.
