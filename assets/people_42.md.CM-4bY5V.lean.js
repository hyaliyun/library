Carpenter's first commission, in 1909, was for 116 East 58th Street, a nine-story apartment house, since demolished. His designs in Tennessee include the Columbia military arsenal (later the Columbia Military Academy), the Maury County courthouse in Columbia, Tennessee, the Kirkland Tower at Vanderbilt University, the Hermitage Hotel, Lynmeade Mansion and the Stahlman Building in Nashville, the Hurt Building in Atlanta, the American National Bank Building (Pensacola, Florida), and several noteworthy buildings in New York City, including 907 Fifth Avenue, 620 Park Avenue, 625 Park Avenue, 640 Park Avenue, 655 Park Avenue, 825 Fifth Avenue, 819 Park Avenue, 550 Park Avenue, completed in 1917, the neo-Italianate 1030 Fifth Avenue, built in 1925https://streeteasy.com/building/1030-5-avenue-new_york, and the Lincoln Building (42nd Street, Manhattan), completed in 1930.Withey & Withey, 1956, p. 109.West, http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=C035, 1998.

It is located southeast of the historic center of Mexico City. It borders are marked by the following streets, to the north Eje Tres Sur or Avenida Calzada del Chabacano, Calzada de la Viga to the east, Calzada de San Antonio Abad to the west and Hernandez Davalos street to the south. The origins of the neighborhood are based in the extension of neighboring Colonia Asturias. \\"Ampliaci√≥n\\" means \\"amplification.\\" Prior to the 1940s, the area was pasture and farmland, growing alfalfa and corn. The original Colonia Asturias is marked by Calzada del Chabacano, formerly known as Calzada de San Estaban. This road was extended to the La Viga area along a canal that was here. This canal, which passed the length of the current neighborhood, was an important venue to transport goods for sale and consumption, using wind or steam-powered boats. This canal connected with another called La Esperanza, which connected to the canals that connected the center of Mexico City to Chalco in the 19th century. However, by the end of the centuries, dropping groundwater tables dried up enough of the canals to make transport between these two entities impossible in this manner. The drying of the area allowed for road construction and the creation of this colonia, along with the expansion of Asturias and the creation of Colonia Vista Alegre. Connecting them is Calazada de Chabacano, named such for the large quantity of apricot (chabacano) trees that used to grow in the area. One of the main Metro stations serving the neighborhood is Metro Chabacano, from which pass Lines 2 and 8 which pass on the edges of the colonia. Line 8 passes through the neighborhood and connects Metro Chabacano with Metro La Viga, which is on the eastern border of the colonia. The neighborhood is part of the Cuauht√©moc borough, which as of 2007 was home to seven of the ten most crime-plagued colonias in Mexico City. Although Ampliaci√≥n Asturias is not one of these seven neighborhoods, it has one reputed \\"hot spot\\" for crime, which is the area around Calzada de Chabacano, Jose A Torres, Juan A Mateos and Jose Sotero Casta√±eda streets in the area that borders with Colonia Vista Alegre.

They captured various key points and announced over national radio the overthrow of the incumbent regime. With the help of the Americans, Kh√°nh was able to rally support and the coup collapsed the next morning without any casualties. In the immediate month leading up the coup, Kh√°nh's leadership had become increasingly troubled. He had tried to augment his powers by declaring a state of emergency, but this only provoked large-scale protests and riots calling for an end to military rule, with Buddhist activists at the forefront. Fearful of losing power, Kh√°nh began making concessions to the protesters and promised democracy in the near future. He also removed several military officials closely linked to the discriminatory Catholic rule of the slain former President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám; this response to Buddhist pressure dismayed several Catholic officers, who made a few abortive moves to remove him from power. In part because of pressure from Buddhist protests, Kh√°nh removed the Catholics Ph√°t and ƒê·ª©c from the posts of Interior Minister and IV Corps commander, respectively. They responded with a coup supported by the Catholic-aligned ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát Qu·ªëc d√¢n ƒë·∫£ng, as well as General Tr·∫ßn Thi·ªán Khi√™m, a Catholic who had helped Kh√°nh to power. Having captured the radio station, Ph√°t then made a broadcast promising to revive Di·ªám's policies. Kh√°nh managed to evade capture and, during the first stage of the coup, there was little activity as most senior officers failed to support either side. Throughout the day, Kh√°nh gradually rallied more allies and the U.S. remained supportive of his rule and pressured the rebels to give up. With the backing of Air Marshal Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥, commander of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, and General Nguy·ªÖn Ch√°nh Thi, Kh√°nh was able to force Ph√°t and ƒê·ª©c to capitulate the next morning, September 14. ƒê·ª©c, K·ª≥ and Thi then appeared at a media conference where they denied that any coup had taken place and put on a choreographed display of unity, claiming that nobody would be prosecuted over the events. Convinced that Khi√™m was involved in the plot, Kh√°nh had him exiled to Washington as ambassador, and eased General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh out of the political scene, thereby removing the other two nominal members of the ruling triumvirate. However, concerned that K·ª≥ and Thi had become too powerful, Kh√°nh had Ph√°t and ƒê·ª©c acquitted at their military trial in an attempt to use them as political counterweights. Despite his survival, the coup was seen by the historian George McTurnan Kahin as the start of Kh√°nh's ultimate political decline. Due to the intervention of K·ª≥ and Thi, Kh√°nh was now indebted to them, and in an attempt to maintain his power in the face of increasing military opposition, he tried to court support from Buddhist civilian activists, who supported negotiations with the communists to end the Vietnam War. As the Americans were strongly opposed to such policies, relations with Kh√°nh became increasingly strained and he was deposed in February 1965 with US connivance.  Background  General Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh had come to power in January 1964 after surprising the ruling junta of General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh in a pre-dawn operation, taking control without firing a shot. Because of American pressure, he retained the popular Minh as a token head of state, while holding the real power by controlling the Military Revolutionary Council (MRC).Shaplen, pp. 228‚Äì240. In August, the Vietnam War expanded with the Tonkin Gulf incident, a disputed encounter between North Vietnamese and American naval vessels; Washington accused the communists of launching an attack in international waters.Moyar (2004), p. 757.Moyar (2006), pp. 310‚Äì311.Moyar (2006), p. 311. Kh√°nh saw the tense situation as an opportunity to increase his power. On August 7, he declared a state of emergency, giving the police the ability to search properties under any circumstances, ban protests and arbitrarily jail \\"elements considered as dangerous to national security\\". He further enacted censorship to stop \\"the circulation of all publications, documents, and leaflets considered as harmful to public order\\". Kh√°nh produced a new constitution, known as the V≈©ng T√†u Charter,McAllister, p. 762. which would have augmented his personal power at the expense of the already-limited Minh. However, this only served to weaken Kh√°nh as large demonstrations and riots in the cities broke out‚Äîwith the majority Buddhists prominent‚Äîcalling for an end to the state of emergency and the new constitution, as well as a progression back to civilian rule. Fearing he could be toppled by the intensifying protests, Kh√°nh met with Buddhist leaders.Moyar (2004), p. 761. They asked him to repeal the new constitution, reinstate civilian rule, and remove C·∫ßn Lao Party‚Äîa secret Catholic body used by former President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám to infiltrate and control all aspects of society‚Äîmembers from power, and Kh√°nh agreed. General Tr·∫ßn Thi·ªán Khi√™m claimed \\"Kh√°nh felt there was no choice but to accept since the influence of Tr√≠ Quang was so great that he could not only turn the majority of the people against the government but could influence the effectiveness of the armed forces.\\"McAllister, p. 763. Kh√°nh publicly promised to reformulate the V≈©ng T√†u Charter, allow protests and liberalize the press.Moyar (2004), p. 762. This encouraged more demonstrations by activists, and Kh√°nh responded with wider concessions. Under the new arrangements, the new constitution would be repealed, and the MRC would disband. Kh√°nh also promised to create an elected legislature within a year. alt=Middle-aged man with greying dark hair parted slightly off-centre. He wears a green dress uniform, with suit and tie, is clean-shaven, and has four stars on his shoulder to indicate his rank. Many senior officers, particularly the Catholic Generals Khi√™m and Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu, decried what they viewed as a handing of power to the Buddhist leaders.Moyar (2004), pp. 762‚Äì763. They tried to remove Kh√°nh in favor of Minh, and recruited many officers to their plot. Khi√™m and Thieu sought out US Ambassador Maxwell Taylor for a private endorsement of their plan, but Taylor did not want any more changes in leadership, fearing a corrosive effect on the already-unstable government. This deterred Khi√™m's group from acting on their plans.Moyar (2004), p. 763. The division among the generals came to a head at a meeting of the MRC on August 26‚Äì27. Kh√°nh said the instability was due to troublemaking by members and supporters of the Catholic-aligned ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát Qu·ªëc d√¢n ƒë·∫£ng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam), whom he accused of putting partisan plotting ahead of the national interest. Prominent officers associated with the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát included Thieu and Khi√™m.Kahin, pp. 229‚Äì230. Khi√™m blamed Kh√°nh's weakness in dealing with Buddhist activists for the demonstrations in the cities and the rural losses to the communists.Moyar (2006), p. 318. Thieu and another Catholic General Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu C√≥ called for the replacement of Kh√°nh with Minh, but the latter refused. Minh claimed that Kh√°nh was the only one who would get funding from Washington, so they should support him, prompting Khi√™m to angrily say \\"Obviously, Kh√°nh is a puppet of the US government, and we are tired of being told by the Americans how we should run our internal affairs.\\" Feeling pressured by the strong condemnations of his colleagues, Kh√°nh promised to resign, but no replacement was agreed upon and another meeting was convened. After more arguing between the senior officers, they agreed that Kh√°nh, Minh, and Khi√™m would rule as a triumvirate for two months, until a new civilian government could be formed. However, because of their disunity, the trio did little. Kh√°nh dominated the decision-making and sidelined Khi√™m and Minh. The US military commander in Vietnam William Westmoreland deplored the concessions Kh√°nh made to political opponents and lobbied Washington for permission to attack North Vietnam, saying that Kh√°nh could not survive without it.Moyar (2006), p. 319.  Coup  At the start of September 1964, General L√¢m VƒÉn Ph√°t was dismissed as Interior Minister, while General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn ƒê·ª©c was about to be removed as IV Corps commander. Both were removed partly due to pressure from Buddhist activists, who accused Kh√°nh of accommodating too many Catholic Di·ªám supporters in leadership positions.Moyar (2006), p. 327. Di·ªám had tried to use the loyalist Ph√°t to help thwart the November 1963 coup, but the rebels managed to sideline Di·ªám's general and execute the president. Disgruntled by their demotions, Ph√°t and ƒê·ª©c launched a coup attempt before dawn on September 13, having recruited ten army battalions.Moyar (2006), p. 326. They gained the support of Colonel L√Ω T√≤ng B√°, the head of the 7th Division's armored section, and Colonel D∆∞∆°ng Hi·∫øu Nghƒ©a, a tank commander who had been one of Di·ªám's assassins.Kahin, p. 231. It appeared at this stage that the coup was supported by Catholic and ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát elements.Shaplen, p. 288. Another member of the conspiracy was Colonel Ph·∫°m Ng·ªçc Th·∫£o, who while a Catholic, was a communist spy trying to maximize infighting at every possible opportunity.Karnow, pp. 39‚Äì43. ƒê·ª©c and Ph√°t's plot was supported during the planning phase by Defense Minister and triumvirate member Khi√™m. General Hu·ª≥nh VƒÉn Cao, a Catholic and Di·ªám loyalist while the former president was alive, claimed in a 1972 newspaper interview that Khi√™m‚Äîby then prime minister‚Äîhad asked him to join the coup. Cao said he had declined Khi√™m's invitation, mildly mocking him by asking \\"You're part of the 'Troika' now ... won't you be overthrowing yourself?\\" Cao said he had pointed out that political upheaval in Saigon would be a bad idea because Vietnam was prominent during the ongoing US presidential election campaign and negative publicity could lead to a decrease in American public and political support for South Vietnam.Kahin, p. 498. alt=A portrait of a middle-aged man, looking to the left in a half-portrait/profile. He has chubby cheeks, parts his hair to the side and wears a suit and tie. Four battalions of rebel troops moved before dawn from the Mekong Delta towards Saigon, using armored personnel carriers and jeeps carrying machine guns. After cowing several police checkpoints on the edge of the capital with threats of machine-gun and artillery fire, the plotters put rebel sentries in their place to seal off Saigon from incoming or outgoing traffic. They then captured communication facilities in the capital, including the post office, to prevent messages from being sent in or out. As his troops took over the city, Ph√°t sat in a civilian vehicle and placidly said \\"We'll be holding a press conference in town this afternoon at 4 p.m.\\" He said \\"This is nothing to worry about. Just a little operation against some politicians.\\" The rebels set up their command post in the Saigon home of General Duong Ngoc Lam, who had been removed from his post as Mayor of Saigon by Kh√°nh. Lam had commanded the Civil Guard during Di·ªám's presidency and was one of his trusted supporters. The rebels took over the city without any gunfire, and used the national radio station to make a broadcast. Claiming to represent \\"The Council for the Liberation of the Nation\\", Ph√°t proclaimed a regime change, and accused Kh√°nh of promoting conflict within the nation's military and political leadership. He promised to capture Kh√°nh and pursue a policy of increased anti-communism, with a stronger government and military. Ph√°t said he would use the ideology and legacy of Di·ªám to lay the foundation for his new junta. ƒê·ª©c claimed the coup attempt was prompted by \\"the transfer to the capital of some neutralist elements, and by some pro-communists in the government\\". According to the historian George McTurnan Kahin, Ph√°t's broadcast was \\"triumphant\\" and may have prompted senior officers who were neither part of the original conspiracy nor fully loyal to Kh√°nh to conclude that Ph√°t and ƒê·ª©c would not embrace them if they abandoned Kh√°nh.Kahin, p. 232. In contrast to Ph√°t's serene demeanor, his incoming troops prompted devotees at the Catholic cathedral‚Äîwho were attending mass‚Äîto run away in fear. The Buddhists however, made no overt reaction to the pro-Di·ªám coup, even though the former president had pursued policies that discriminated against them. There was little reaction from most of the military commanders. The Republic of Vietnam Air Force commander Air Marshal Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥ had promised a fortnight earlier to use his aircraft against any coup attempt, but he took no action early in the morning. At the same time, Khi√™m and Thieu's lack of public action was seen as implicit support for the coup, as their criticism of Kh√°nh's leadership in junta meetings and private attempts to remove him were well-known.Moyar (2006), pp. 316‚Äì319. A US Embassy report to the State Department during the coup described Thieu and Khi√™m as being \\"so passive that they appear to have been either tacitly supporting or associated with this move by ƒê·ª©c and Ph√°t\\". alt=Black- and-white photo of a runway and hangars. Only one large airplane can be seen. Some time later, K·ª≥ called in troops serving on Saigon's outskirts to come to Tan Son Nhut Air Base, the largest in the country and the headquarters of the military. He barricaded the soldiers into defensive positions and vowed a \\"massacre\\" if rebels attacked the base. A stand-off ensued between rebel tanks and loyalist troops around the perimeter of the base, but it petered out without any violence after the rebels stepped back. K·ª≥ had apparently been angered by comments made by a rebel source who claimed that he was part of the coup attempt. K·ª≥ was also well known for his hawkish attitude and close relations with the American military presence in Vietnam, and US opposition to the putsch was thought to have been quickly conveyed to him. Ph√°t and ƒê·ª©c could not apprehend Kh√°nh, who had escaped the capital and flown to the Central Highlands resort town of Da Lat. Their forces stormed Kh√°nh's office and captured his duty officers but could not find the junta leader. There was then a lull in the movement of troops and units. One Vietnamese public servant said that \\"All these preparations are the result of a big misunderstanding on both sides. I don't think either group will start anything, but both think the other will.\\" Taylor was on an emergency flight from Honolulu‚Äîwhere he had been in meetings with senior American military figures‚Äîback to Saigon and he said the coup \\"certainly was unannounced and unheralded.\\" In the mid-afternoon Kh√°nh made a radio broadcast on a loyalist system, condemning the coup and calling on the military to remain loyal, claiming that support for the \\"rebellious leaders\\" would play into the hands of the Viet Cong. = U.S. intervention = Some U.S. advisers serving with units involved in the coup were driven off by rebel officers who did not want interference. The plotters thought the Americans would disapprove of their actions, as Taylor had recently talked of an \\"upward trend\\" in the war against the communists, while President Lyndon Johnson praised the \\"continued progress\\" against the Viet Cong. During the early hours of the coup, officials in Washington remained guarded in public, saying they were monitoring the situation and calling for calm, without explicitly supporting either side. Despite this, they did hint at a preference for the status quo: \\"hope that consultations among the leadership will shortly permit the Government to restore the situation in the city to normal\\". Behind the scenes, they used the respective American military advisers to lobby unit leaders against participating in the coup. U.S. officials flew after Kh√°nh to encourage him to return to Saigon and reassert his control. The general refused to do so unless the Americans publicly announced their support for him. The Americans then asked Kh√°nh about his plans for the future, but felt that his answers betrayed a lack of direction. After talking to Ph√°t and ƒê·ª©c, they concluded the same, so they decided to back the incumbent and made a press release through the embassy endorsing Kh√°nh. Their decision was augmented by the rebels' inability to land a decisive blow, making the Americans more favorable to a continuation of Kh√°nh's rule. The Voice of America broadcast a message emphasizing ongoing U.S. support for Kh√°nh and opposition to the coup. It said the Americans had been monitoring the situation closely and that the incumbent regime was functioning; it further said: At the same time, anonymous U.S. sources told journalists that the coup was concerning even if it failed, due to its destabilizing effects. Kh√°nh also requested to General William Westmoreland, the commander of American forces in Vietnam, that U.S. Marines come to his aid, and called for the Americans to formulate a \\"counter-plan\\" for him. Although no U.S. forces made landfall, marines were placed just offshore near Saigon and Da Nang in readiness. = Coup collapse = alt=Middle-aged man with side-parted black hair and moustache, in a black suit, white shirt and brown tie. To the left is a clean-shaven Asian man with black hair and a green military cap. The U.S. announcement of support for Kh√°nh helped to deter ARVN officers from joining Ph√°t and ƒê·ª©c, who decided to give up. Westmoreland had spoken to ƒê·ª©c and reported to Washington that he \\"in no uncertain terms ... informed him [ƒê·ª©c] that MACV, the U.S. Mission, and the U.S. Government did not support in any way his move, [and] advised that he get his troops moved out of town [Saigon] immediately. He said that he understood and thanked me. He seemed to be a shaky and insecure young man.\\" ƒê·ª©c mistakenly thought that K·ª≥ and his subordinates would be joining the coup, but he later realized his misjudgement. When he found out he had been tricked into thinking the plotters had great strength, he gave up. According to an anonymous source, ƒê·ª©c was alarmed by Ph√°t's strong statements during his radio broadcast, which made him reconsider his participation in the coup. Brigadier General Nguy·ªÖn Ch√°nh Thi of the 1st Division also supported Kh√°nh.Shaplen, p. 287. A CIA log of the coup proceedings said Thieu and Khi√™m \\"issued expressions of firm support for Kh√°nh somewhat belatedly\\". K·ª≥ then decided to make a show of force as Ph√°t and ƒê·ª©c began to wilt, and he sent jets to fly low over Saigon and finish off the rebel stand. They circled continuously but never actually fired. He also sent two C-47s to V≈©ng T√†u to pick up two companies of South Vietnamese marines who had remained loyal to Kh√°nh. Several more battalions of loyal infantry were transported into Saigon. Ph√°t then withdrew with his forces to M·ªπ Tho, the base of the 7th Division. In the early hours of September 14, before dawn, K·ª≥ met senior coup leaders after inviting them to Tan Son Nhut and told them to back down, which they did. Loyalist forces regained control of the radio station and broadcast an announcement claiming control and ordering students and public servants to go about their normal lives. In the meantime, air force planes continued to set off flares to show their alertness, and rocket launchers and more weapons were deployed around Tan Son Nhut. Three battalions of paratroopers were brought in to patrol the airfield's perimeter.  Media conference  As the coup collapsed, K·ª≥ and ƒê·ª©c appeared with other senior officers at a news conference where they proclaimed that the South Vietnamese military was united. They announced a resolution by the armed forces, signed by them and seven others, claiming a united front against corruption. Apart from K·ª≥ and ƒê·ª©c, the other seven signatories were Thi, General Cao VƒÉn Vi√™n, an airborne brigade commander, the commander of I Corps General T√¥n Th·∫•t X·ª©ng, the commander of the Marine Brigade General L√™ Nguy√™n Khang, General Nguyen ƒê·ª©c Thang of the General Staff, the commander of the Republic of Vietnam Navy Admiral Chung T·∫•n Cang, and the commander of the Rangers Colonel Pham Xuan Nhuan. The officers claimed the events in the capital were misinterpreted by observers, as \\"there was no coup\\". K·ª≥ said Kh√°nh was in complete control and that the senior officers involved in the stand-off \\"have agreed to rejoin their units to fight the Communists\\", naming ƒê·ª©c, Ph√°t, Lam and commander of the 7th Division Huynh Van Ton. ƒê·ª©c claimed that the leading officers had agreed: ƒê·ª©c further commented that fair treatment of citizens was the only way to defeat the communists. When asked if he now supported Kh√°nh, ƒê·ª©c, \\"looking ill with weariness, if nothing else\\", simply nodded in agreement. K·ª≥ also claimed that no further action would be taken against those who were involved with ƒê·ª©c and Ph√°t's activities. After Kh√°nh was again secure in Saigon, he said \\"I am very moved by the spirit of unity shown by the armed forces and population when faced with the threat of internal strife. I commend the patriotism of all the soldiers who knew how to put the higher interests of the nation above all else.\\" Kh√°nh said he would relinquish power and return to a purely military rule in two months time, but reneged on an earlier explicit promise to guarantee a purely civilian government, simply stating that the new regime would be one \\"that has the confidence of the entire people\\". The Soviet Union said the coup \\"demonstrated once again on what a rotten foundation Washington's policy in South Vietnam is based\\".  Arrests  Despite K·ª≥ and ƒê·ª©c's media event, it appeared that Ph√°t and Ton were remaining defiant after returning to the latter's 7th Division's headquarters in M·ªπ Tho. Ton was apparently still maintaining a hostile political stance, and threatening to break away from the Saigon regime by overseeing the area around M·ªπ Tho as a virtual independent state. Ton was reported to have threatened to cut the main highway from Saigon into M·ªπ Tho and further south into the rest of the Mekong Delta, although it was thought he had no intention or means of assaulting Saigon militarily. K·ª≥ said a helicopter had been sent to arrest Ton but that a stand-off had developed. However, on September 16 Kh√°nh had the plotters taken into custody. ƒê·ª©c, the rebel tank commander Nghia, Ton, and Lam were all arrested, followed by Ph√°t, who returned to Saigon to turn himself in. A trial was then scheduled. Kh√°nh removed three of the four corps commanders and six of the nine division commanders for failing to move against Ph√°t and ƒê·ª©c.Karnow, p. 396.  Power shift  K·ª≥ and Thi's role in putting down the coup attempt gave them more leverage in Saigon's military politics. Indebted to K·ª≥, Thi, and the youthful clique of officers dubbed the Young Turks for helping him stay in power, Kh√°nh was now in a weaker position. K·ª≥'s group called on Kh√°nh to remove \\"corrupt, dishonest and counterrevolutionary\\" officers, civil servants and \\"exploitationists\\", and threatened to remove him if he did not enact their proposed reforms, as \\"the people and the armed forces will be compelled to make a second revolution\\". This was interpreted as a thinly veiled warning to Kh√°nh that the younger officers were intent on holding significant power through the military apparatus, contrary to any plans for civilian rule. K·ª≥ specifically said nine or ten other officers should be dismissed for involvement in the coup, but refused to identify who he had in mind. Some observers accused K·ª≥ and Thi of deliberately orchestrating or allowing the plot to develop before putting it down in order to embarrass Kh√°nh and allow themselves to gain prominence and prestige on the political stage. In later years, Cao Huy Thuan, a professor and Buddhist activist based in the northern town of Da Nang, claimed that during a meeting with K·ª≥ and Thi a few days before the coup, the officers had discussed their plans for overthrowing Kh√°nh. Another conspiracy claim was propagated by General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n, who conjectured that Kh√°nh had tried to provoke or bait rival generals, such as Khi√™m, into revolting against him so he could defeat and remove them from the scene, thereby strengthening himself and boosting his political image. The communists were pleased by the coup, as the South Vietnamese military was wasting its resources and energy on infighting. They did not make any attacks in the days immediately after the coup as they were worried their doing so might galvanize the divided society into action against a common cause.  Retribution and trial  alt=Three Asian men with black hair standing from left to right. The first is in profile, wearing a beret. He has three stars as a Lieutenant General and has a moustache. The next man is facing towards the camera smiling. He is clean shaven and has three stars. A third man on the right has his back to the camera and is wearing a cowboy hat. All are wearing military fatigues. Following the coup, Kh√°nh concluded that his triumvirate partner Khi√™m had played a major role in fomenting the coup and insisted he be sent out of Saigon. The Americans agreed and Ambassador Taylor organized for Khi√™m to be made Saigon's representative in Washington. Soon after, Thao was dispatched to join Khi√™m as his press attach√©. During the coup, Minh had remained aloof from the proceedings, angering Kh√°nh and keeping their long-running rivalry going. By the end of October, the Johnson administration had become more supportive of Taylor's negative opinion of Minh and concluded that US interests would be optimized if Kh√°nh prevailed in the power struggle. As a result, the Americans eventually paid for Minh to go on a \\"good will tour\\" so he could be pushed off the political scene without embarrassment. In the middle of October, Ph√°t and 19 others were put on trial in a military court; observers predicted Ph√°t would be the only one to face the death penalty, and that this would be reduced to a custodial term. Of the accused, 7 were civilians and 13 were military officers. They tried to appear confident and waved to family and friends. ƒê·ª©c told the assembled media the trial was unfair, stating \\"I believe in the supreme court of conscience\\". He then pointed to his subordinate officers and called them \\"national heroes\\". He denied media speculation he had backed down during the coup to avoid being bombed by K·ª≥, claiming \\"I wanted to avoid bloodshed ... I am very proud of my decision\\". Ph√°t's lawyers started by asking for the charges against the conspirators to be dismissed, claiming the rebels had not been captured \\"red- handed\\", but this request was denied. They were more successful in another demand, managing to persuade the five military judges to allow witnesses to be called. The court agreed to their request to compel Kh√°nh, K·ª≥ and the civilian Deputy Prime Minister Nguy·ªÖn Xu√¢n O√°nh to appear before the hearing. The accused officers claimed to have only intended to make a show of force, rather than overthrow Kh√°nh. ƒê·ª©c claimed that the objective of his actions was to \\"emphasize my ideas\\" and said his actions did not constitute a coup attempt. ƒê·ª©c said that if he was intending to overthrow the government, he would have arrested public servants or military officials and denied having done so. On the other hand, he also admitted to being concerned by Kh√°nh's policies. ƒê·ª©c said he had decided to end what he regarded as a military protest demonstration when Kh√°nh promised to consider his concerns, and then returned to the IV Corps headquarters in the Mekong Delta. He claimed responsibility for the actions of his subordinate and co-accused, Colonel Ton, who led the 7th Division of IV Corps into Saigon. Ton agreed that ƒê·ª©c had ordered him to move his troops into the capital. During questioning, ƒê·ª©c did not refer to his coup partner Ph√°t. Asked why he had denounced Kh√°nh as a \\"traitor\\" in a radio broadcast during the coup attempt, Ph√°t said he had merely \\"gotten excited\\". Ph√°t was asked about the collapse of his coup attempt and he discussed his visit to the American Embassy along with labor union leader Tran Quoc Buu on the evening of September 13. He said his discussion with Deputy Ambassador U. Alexis Johnson was \\"not too important\\" and played down its impact, claiming that Johnson's perfunctory use of French had limited any talks he would have wanted to have. This was contradicted by Buu, who told journalists that the discussion with Johnson had lasted for around 90 minutes. Of the civilians arrested, Buu was the most prominent. He was accused of involvement in trying to overthrow the regime because he had been involved in the meeting between Ph√°t and Johnson. Buu acknowledged that he organized the meeting but said he was not involved in any plans for a leadership change. He claimed that US Embassy officials had phoned him during the coup to ask him to order his union members to refrain from agitating on industrial relations matters during the physically dangerous period. He said he then offered to arrange a meeting for the Americans with the coup leaders to see if a non-violent solution to the stand-off could be found. Buu said he was not acting in a partial manner and did not listen to Johnson's discussion with Ph√°t. The Americans agreed with Buu's claims and privately thought he had been arrested for staging labor union activities and demonstrations unrelated to the military power struggle. One week later, on October 24, the charges were dropped. Kh√°nh then gave ƒê·ª©c and Ph√°t two months of detention for indiscipline; their subordinates were incarcerated for shorter periods. According to Kahin, Kh√°nh rigged the military trial so that ƒê·ª©c and Ph√°t were acquitted so they could be used as a Catholic counterweight to the Young Turks faction of K·ª≥ and Thi, who in Kh√°nh's eyes had become increasingly strong and ominous. Kh√°nh also tried to build an alliance with the \\"Da Lat Generals\\"‚Äîso-called as he had put them under house arrest there after toppling them in the January 1964 coup‚Äîby recalling them to active roles. On November 14, Kh√°nh brought back Don as the deputy chief of staff, and installed fellow Da Lat General T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê√≠nh as his assistant. However, the Young Turks were cognizant of Kh√°nh's motives, and continued to pressure him to sideline Don and Dinh in an attempt to gain more power for themselves. For his part, realizing his political base within the junta was precarious, Kh√°nh had to seek more popular support. According to Kahin, \\"in what was strictly a marriage of convenience\\", Kh√°nh had to try to ameliorate the only large civilian political force in South Vietnam, the Buddhist activists, who publicly called for a negotiated end to the war. This was regarded by Kahin as the start of Kh√°nh's ultimate political downfall, as the Americans were resolutely opposed to any coexistence with the communists and their relations with Kh√°nh declined steadily from then onwards.Kahin, pp. 232‚Äì235. In December, Kh√°nh and Taylor had an angry exchange after the junta dissolved the consultative High National Council, leading both men to call for the other to leave the country and prompting Kh√°nh to repeatedly denounce the ambassador in the media.Kahin, pp. 255‚Äì260. Kh√°nh was eventually deposed in February 1965 by K·ª≥ and Thi with the backing, encouragement and some organizational help from the Americans.Kahin, pp. 288‚Äì300.

Early life and education The New York State Department of Education building, Albany. Graves was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1869. He was educated in the Brooklyn Public schools, and attended Columbia University, earning an A.B. in 1889 and a Ph.D. in Greek in 1892. He gained membership in Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Delta Kappa, and Phi Beta Phi. In 1895, he married Helen Hope Wadsworth.James Malcolom, ed., The New York State Red Book (Albany, NY: J.B.

He later became president of the State University of Wyoming for two years, and president of the University of Washington for five years. Both institutions quadrupled their enrollment during his tenure.Malcolm, New York State Red Book, p. 173. This experience heightened Dr. Graves' interest in the history of education; and so he returned to Columbia and earned another Doctorate, this time in Education. Graves went on to become professor of the History of Education at the University of Missouri, Ohio State University, and the University of Pennsylvania, over a period from 1904 to 1921. During this time he also taught at the University of Wisconsin, the University of Chicago, and at Columbia.Malcolm, New York State Red Book, p. 173. Commissioner in New York Graves became Commissioner of the New York State Education Department in 1921, and held that post under six governors, for nearly two decades. Under his tenure, the state took major steps in rural school consolidation, an important, if often very controversial, endeavor.

As chairman of Tottenham, Scholar became known for a number of innovations in the commercialisation of the club, innovations that were copied by other football clubs. He was also instrumental in pushing for higher fees paid by television companies for rights to broadcast football matches. The financial imperative would eventually led to the formation of the Premier League with Tottenham one of the five prime movers who pushed for its formation. Tottenham won a UEFA Cup and a FA Cup with him at the helm, but his chairmanship at the club ended with heavy financial losses and the club was sold to Alan Sugar and Terry Venables. Early career Scholar was a surveryor and became a property developer and business executive. He made his money through a company associated with European Ferries called Townsend Thoresen Properties. He then moved to Monte Carlo for tax reasons.Jason Nisse, BOOK REVIEW / How Irving Scholar won and lost his Spurs: 'Behind Closed Doors' from The Independent Tottenham Hotspur In 1981, Scholar, a lifelong supporter of Tottenham, turned up at a meeting at Tottenham with the intention of leasing a box in the West Stand of White Hart Lane that was to be rebuilt by 1982. However, Scholar became convinced that the club would get into financial trouble over the rebuilding of the stand, and as a fan with a keen interest in the club's fortune, he started buying up shares in the club from various shareholders in order to get into the boardroom. At that time there was a rift in the boardroom between former chairmen Arthur Richardson and Sidney Wale, and Scholar persuaded Wale to sell his shares, buying up 25% of the club for ¬£600,000. Together with the help of Paul Bobroff who had bought 15% of shares from the family of a previous chairman Fred Bearman, he took control in December 1982 from the Richardson and Wale families who had been major shareholders for many years. After he took over, Douglas Alexiou, the only remaining member of the previous board, was made chairman, but later in 1984 Scholar took over the position of chairman. Scholar inherited a club in debt to the tune of nearly ¬£5 million, what was then the largest debt in English football, but a rights issue after he took over brought in a million pounds. As chairman of Spurs, Scholar worked closely with fellow property developer Paul Bobroff and they diversified the club into other areas such as computing and the clothing firms Hummel UK and Martex, merchandising as well as floating on the London Stock Exchange, with Spurs becoming the first sports club in the world to float on any stock exchange.Financial times Scholar played a significant role in the commercialisation of English football clubs, and his activities in these areas would later see him branded a visionary in a 2001 BBC documentary The Men Who Changed Football, as merchandising and stock market flotation would later become popular for football clubs. Manchester United in particular hired a former Spurs executive involved and became the most successful English club in merchandising their brand. The commercial imperative would also lead to the formation of the Premier League with Scholar one of the prime movers who pushed for its formation. At that time, the television companies operated a cartel to keep the broadcast fees for football on television low, but Scholar persuaded the major clubs that the television companies should be made to pay considerably more for their coverage of football matches. In the ensuing dispute over broadcast fees with the television companies, no matches were broadcast for a few months in the 1985‚Äì86 season. According to Scholar who was involved in the negotiations of television deals, each of the First Division clubs received only around ¬£25,000 per year from television rights before 1986, this increased to around ¬£50,000 in the 1986 negotiation (worth ¬£6.3 million to the Football League in a two-year deal), then to ¬£600,000 in 1988 (¬£44 million in total over four years). Broadcast rights would later become a significant part of the income of English football clubs in the Premier League era with deals reaching several billions. By the early 1990s, however, Scholar's Tottenham faced financial troubles due to investment in new players, the construction of a new stand at the club's White Hart Lane ground, and losses in the companies he had created with Tottenham.Veneables with Sugar Scholar looked to Robert Maxwell to help bail the club out. Maxwell agreed to support a rights issue he soon backed out and instead loaned ¬£1.1 million to the club, with the proviso that the deal be kept secret. When news of the deal came out, Tottenham were left in turmoil and a struggle for power broke out between Scholar and Bobroff. Scholar eventually prevailed and Bobroff was forced to resign. Terry Venables then sought a number of backers in his attempts to buy the club, eventually teaming up with Alan Sugar. Scholar finally sold his shares in the club for ¬£2 million and left in the summer of 1991, a couple of months after the club won the FA Cup for the eighth time. Scholar spoke a couple of weeks later to writer Alex Fynn and predicted that the Sugar-Venables marriage would last a short time, stating \\"The first year will be the honeymoon, the second will be the divorce\\". Venables was thrown out of Spurs exactly two years later, in the summer of 1993, contributing to a highly public slanging match and bringing a court case against Sugar, which he lost. Scholar published a book about his time at White Hart Lane, Behind Closed Doors, in 1992 with Mihir Bose as his co-author. Nottingham Forest Scholar became a director of Nottingham Forest in 1997 with the consortium that took over the club, the group included author Phil Soar, businessman Julian Markham and Saracens F.C. chairman Nigel Wray. Irving would go on to sell some of Nottingham Forest's top talent behind the back of manager Dave Bassett which lead to Dutch forward Pierre van Hooijdonk going on strike. Nigel Doughty bought Forest after the club's flotation on the Alternative Investment Market. Scholar resigned from his directorship in June 1999 after attacking other board members for a \\"farcical lack of professionalism\\". Forest have never played in the Premier League since then. At one point the team was relegated to the third tier of English Football, its lowest position since the 1950s.

Players take control of a wolfpack of submarines attempting to stop an enemy invasion. Gameplay In Sub Hunt, the player commands a fleet of four submarines. An enemy nation is preparing an invasion fleet to attack the player's home island, and it is up to the player to either destroy the convoys arriving to build the invasion fleet or, failing that, to destroy the invasion fleet itself before it reaches the player's island. After selecting from one of five skill levels, the \\"deployment\\" mode game map appears, showing the player's island on the far right side of the screen and an enemy-controlled harbor at the top of the screen. The first of six convoys, each with six ships, begin arriving from the far left of the screen, on a course to the enemy staging harbor. All four of the player's submarines are active, but only one can be controlled at any one time. The player dispatches submarines to intercept the convoys as they make their way across the ocean; the submarines will move in a straight line on their last heading until ordered to stop or until they reach an enemy convoy. When a submarine encounters a convoy, the game switches to the \\"battle\\" mode. Here, the player is presented with a simulated periscope view and a sonar map of the immediate area. The player controls the depth, speed and rudder position of the submarine as they attempt to hunt down and sink each ship in the convoy. The convoy is defended by a destroyer (two destroyers in higher difficulty levels) equipped with surface cannons and depth charges that will seek out the player's submarine if it is detected. The player's submarines are armed with a pair of torpedo tubes and an unlimited supply of torpedoes, and the player may turn off the submarine's sonar and engines in order to run silent and avoid detection. If the player's submarine takes too much damage, it will sink (indicated by the screen turning blue, as if being flooded) and the deployment map screen will reappear. Similarly, if the player destroys all six ships, or if the player's submarine is far enough away from the enemy convoy, play switches back to the map screen. If enough convoys reach the staging harbor, the enemy's invasion fleet, made up of three destroyers and three troop transports, will be launched toward the player's home. The player must stop the fleet before it reaches their home, otherwise the game is over. However, if the player successfully destroys all six convoys (36 ships in total), or too few ships reach the staging harbor such that an invasion fleet cannot be formed, the player wins. Legacy Sub Hunt was re-released as part of the Intellivision Lives! collection for computers and other video game consoles, including the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube. The game was also released on Microsoft's Game Room service.

Built in Nevada County in 1856, it is a California Historical Landmark as, in 1879, the foundry became the first manufacturing site of the Pelton wheel. History Figure from Pelton's original patent (October 1880) Pelton wheel, circa 1880, built by the Miners Foundry Edward Coker started up the Nevada Iron Foundry and Machine Shop in 1855. The ironworks foundry and blacksmith shop was situated in a rented building on Spring Street behind the National Exchange Hotel. The Nevada Foundry was built to serve the needs of loggers and California Gold Rush miners who were working mines in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Nevada City's fire of July 1856 destroyed the small foundry operated by Coker. Afterwards, he acquired a new site on the corner of Bridge and Spring streets and began construction on a new building, constructed of native timber and stone. In 1857, the Nevada Foundry had built its first entire steam engine.Bean, pp. 89 But before the new building was completed, Coker lost interest in the business and sold the machinery to David Thom, Thomas J. Williams and J. Jones. By 1859, Jones was no longer associated with the business, and Williams had sold out to William Heugh, leaving William Heugh and David Thom as proprietors of the Nevada Iron and Brass Foundry and Machine Shop. In 1866, they employed approximately 22 men. In the following year, the largest casting made at their foundry was the mortar of a quartz mill weighing 5,600 pounds, and thought to be the heaviest mortar in the state of California.Bean, pp. 133 Heugh died in 1867 and his business interests were acquired by George Grant Allan who became a partner of David Thom, though Allan's ownership was not established until 1871. Their foundry fabricated mining equipment, stamp mills, and mining tools. By 1868, it employed approximately 150 men. There were machine shops and boiler works. The works, driven by a 60 horse power steam engine, consumed 1800 tons of pig iron, 300 tons of wrought iron, and 700 tons of coal. In one month of 1872, the North Bloomfield Mining and Gravel Company made a $30,000 purchase. =Pelton wheel= In 1876, Allan bought out Thom and changed the business name to George Allan's Foundry and Machine Works. It was during Allan's ownership of the foundry that Lester Allan Pelton of Camptonville invented a new type of water wheel in the late 1870s. He brought it to Allan's foundry, where he and Allan tested it before manufacturing the first Pelton wheel. When the foundry could not keep up with Pelton wheel orders, production for the Pelton wheel was moved to San Francisco, though limited production of it continued at Allan's foundry. In 1892, Allan brought his son, Albert D. Allan, into the business as his partner and the younger Allan became the successor sole proprietor. William H. Martin also owned a foundry higher up on Spring Street, at Bennett Street. In 1906, W.H. Martin, W.R. Martin, Miss May C. Martin, B.J. Hall, and J.G. O'Neill incorporated the Miners Foundry Co. W.H. Martin purchased Allan's Foundry from the estate in 1907 and renamed it Miners Foundry and Supply Co. He was the sole proprietor until 1921 when, in that year, he transferred ownership to his son-in-law, Richard Goyne. Under Goyne, times changed and the foundry began fabricated steel. It built mining tools, equipment, and vehicles, such as the side-dump ore car, ball mill, and scoop feed.Brower, pp. 27, 29 It also built non-mining commercial vehicles.Brower, pp. 30 In 1947, it diversified. A new division began selling welding supplies, legging supplies, rubber products, and Bethlehem Steel wire rope while another division began producing a centrifugal juicerBrower, pp. 31 Ray Amick owned the foundry from 1965 until 1974 when manufacturing in the foundry ended. In 1972, the building was purchased by the American Victorian Museum and two years later, it was converted into a non-profit cultural center that is used by 50,000 people each year. Landmark For over 110 years, the building was continuously used as a foundry. A California Historical Landmark plaque, No. 1012, and dated May 11, 1994, was added to the site in honor of the Pelton wheel's history associated with the foundry. In 1986, the Nevada City Constitutional Commission and E Clampus Vitus added another marker. On July 29, 2011, rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers played an invitation-only show at the Miners Foundry Cultural Center.http://andigood.wordpress.com/2011/07/29/chili-peppers-are-go/ The Nevada City Winery, the first bonded winery to open in Nevada County following Prohibition in the United States, is located in the Miners Foundry Garage.

In contemporary sources he is only named king of the former, but his sons and later descendants appear as dynasts of the latter. In addition, at his death in 980 Donovan is styled King of Ressad, a unique title in the surviving Irish annals, and the identity of which place is uncertain. He is the progenitor of the medieval and modern O'Donovan family. Playing a notable role in the early twelfth century fictional political saga Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib (CGG), Donovan is notorious for his alliance with his apparent father- in-law or at least relation Ivar of Limerick, the last Norse king of Limerick, and with M√°el Muad mac Brain, king of Desmond, against the rising D√°l gCais in the persons of Mathgamain mac Cenn√©tig, king of Cashel, and his famous brother Brian B√≥ruma, later High King of Ireland. The latter would prove the victors, altering the political landscape of Munster and Ireland forever. It was Donovan's assistance that made M√°el Muad King of Munster from 976 to 978. Accession and pedigree The lineage of Donovan as set forth by John O'Donovan in the Appendix to the Annals of the Four Masters positions Donovan as the senior descendant of Oilioll Olum (d. 234 A.D.), and ultimately, the senior descent of the race of Heber. Such a lofty claim attracts considerable scrutiny, and Donovan's lineage suffers criticism as possibly missing a number of generations. It has been argued by one scholar, Donnchadh √ì Corr√°in, to possibly be a fabrication intended to link the Donovan dynasty to the U√≠ Chairpre √Åebda, although √ì Corr√°in grudgingly allows that the pedigree may be syncopated.√ì Corr√°in 1974, p. 23 The genealogy of the √öA CAIRPRI is set forth in Rawlinson B 502, an 11th-century manuscript, from Oilioll Olum to Cenn Faelad, who died approximately 744 A.D. It would appear that Donovan's grandfather, Uainide mac Cathail, is poorly documented, and undocumented in contemporary sources, appearing in the 12th century Caithr√©im Chellach√°in Chaisil,Bugge, pp. 72‚Äì3, 135 and in records compiled in the 14th‚Äì16th centuries as being the grandson of Cenn F√°elad. Generally, five generations of descent will encompass more than 250 years. Other manuscripts have an additional two generations of descent during the 744 to 977 period. √ì Corr√°in's research does demonstrate that Donovan's ancestry was far from certain only a two hundred years after his death in 977. However, the author of the Caithr√©im had available to him an extensive collection of official Munster pedigrees and his inclusion of known historical figures for purposes of giving credibility to his propaganda tract would indicate the existence of the individuals. Donnuban's accession to the kingship of U√≠ Fidgenti appears to be referred to in the mid 10th century Betha Adamn√°in.Herbert and √ì Riain, p. 26 But in this passage the acceding prince in U√≠ Fidgenti is actually said to belong to the U√≠ Echach Muman, another name for the E√≥ganacht Raithlind, an entirely separate dynasty from the southern region of Munster (Desmond), but curiously the one to which M√°el Muad mac Brain, Donovan's close ally, happens to belong. With the recent collapse of the E√≥ganacht Chaisil the U√≠ Echach or E√≥ganacht Raithlind were the most powerful of all the E√≥ganachta remaining at this time. The prominent appearance of the U√≠ Fidgenti at the same time was undoubtedly related. In any case the passage in Betha Adamn√°in is: However, Herbert and √ì Riain believe this is an error, because the U√≠ Chairpre themselves also descend from a Laippe, and so they conclude Donovan belonged to a sept known as the Cein√©l Laippe or U√≠ Laippe. Thus the passage can actually be used to support his descent from the U√≠ Chairpre. Notably both of his known sons are described as kings of U√≠ Chairpre. The U√≠ Echach may appear either for the above reason, namely Donovan's close association with M√°el Muad, or because of influence from another part of the text, or because the name Laippe was found in their dynasty as well.Herbert and √ì Riain, p. 25 ff None of this necessarily proves his descent from the early medieval U√≠ Chairpre but simply associates Donovan's family with the later kingship of their territories in the 10th century. There is no doubt however, regarding his classification as a member of the Ui Fidghente, as he is noted as king of the Ui Fidghente in a number of instances (see below). MacCotter argues Donovan belonged to the U√≠ Mac Eirc, an early sept of U√≠ Cairbre possibly giving their name to Kinellerc, the territory surrounding Adare, further noting that another Eirc is a direct ancestor of Donovan.MacCotter, Medieval Ireland, p. 185 and also citing Nicholls, p.25, and O'Brien, pp. 231‚Äì2 Another early known location of the O'Donovans was at Croom, where in the 1130s they are mentioned in the Caithr√©im Chellach√°in Chaisil,Bugge, 15; MacCotter, Medieval Ireland, p.185 an epic describing both its contemporary and 10th century Munster. That Donovan's wife was the daughter of Ivar of Limerick has long been the oral (an perhaps once written) tradition of the family. Regardless of this, it has been argued that Donovan's mother was also Norse based on his father's other associations, by the 3rd Earl of Dunraven, who argued that his father Cathal's association through marriage with \\"Amlaf, king of the Danes of Munster\\" Probably meaning Amla√≠b Cenncairech, but Ivar also had a son Olaf and the two appear to have merged in family tradition, and of course additionally with the later Olaf O'Donovan. officially created the alliance between them.Wyndham-Quin, p. 234 Something of this sort might even be hinted at in a 14th-century official pedigree, the earliest surviving, reprinted by C√∫ Choigcr√≠che √ì Cl√©irigh in the early-mid 17th century,√ì Cl√©irigh, ¬ß2034 Genelach . H. Donnabhain where his own father is given as Amla√≠b (mac Cathail). The most commonly accepted genealogy is given by John O'Donovan.Compare O'Donovan, Four Masters, Vol. VI, Appendix, p. 2436 Sulcoit It is impossible to prove that Donovan was among those opposing the D√°l gCais at the Battle of Sulcoit. According to CGG both M√°el Muad and he did support Ivar there,Todd, pp. 74 ff but the annals unfortunately offer no confirmation and no details. Capture of Mathgamain The \\"new\\" alliance formed between Ivar, Donovan, and M√°el Muad alarmed Mathgamain greatly. M√°el Muad had preceded him as King of Munster until deposed around 970, and naturally very much wanted to reclaim the kingdom for himself and for the distressed and disorderly E√≥ganachta. Also, by the D√°l gCais' own confession Mathgamain was committing repeated depredations throughout Munster,Todd, p. 83 and thus had probably become persona non-grata throughout much of the province.O'Mahony, pp. 31‚Äì4 The author of CGG further claims Mathgamain took hostages from Donovan at this time, but this is rejected by Canon O'Mahony, noting subsequent events.O'Mahony, p. 33 For a now unknown purpose, Mathgamain agreed to meet with the allies, with Donovan's house chosen as the place for the meeting, possibly because he was perceived to be the most neutral, or because Mathgamain may have hoped to detach him from the alliance.O'Mahony, p. 35 According to Alice Stopford Green this act of going into a probable enemy's house was \\"the formal sign of submission and renouncing supremacy\\", and it may have been understood that from there he was to go on to yield allegiance to M√°el Muad.Green, p. 365 Such speculation is extremely unlikely, given Mathgamain's success over a 15-year period of raiding into the territories of Bran and Donovan, and the military strength of his forces and those of his brother, Brian. Today's records do not fully illuminate the events of that day, and the political tides and developing relationships and commerce between the Danes and the Irish, and so the reason for the meeting has been lost. The following annals report Donovan's decision at the meeting regarding his promise of safety to his adversary: The last, from the Annals of the Four Masters, is the latest in date, and in it both M√°el Muad and Donovan have been demoted to the rank of lords, whereas Mathgamain is made \\"supreme King of all Munster\\". He certainly was not this and was never at any time greater than semi-nominal overlord with substantial opposition. The spectacular success of his younger brother Brian becoming a genuine monarch of Munster and eventually Ireland, had a powerful influence on the minds of later historians. It was Mathgamain's fate to pave the way. Also of interest is the claim made by the author of CGG that he was taken prisoner as a result of Ivar's interference with Donovan,Todd, p. 87 not M√°el Muad's. While unsupported by the brief annals this is supported by Donovan's close association with the Limerick dynasty, and Canon O'Mahony has pointed out that M√°el Muad was a considerable distance away at the time, making his way north from his stronghold in Desmond.O'Mahony, pp. 34‚Äì6 His argument that all of this removes M√°el Muad from the plot may or may not be refuted in principle by the fact he quickly received word of the prisoner and ordered him put to death. Final battles and death The sources somewhat disagree on the manner and date of Donovan's death. According to the writer of CGG Brian went on an expedition into U√≠ Fidgenti against both Donovan and the newly elected king of the Norse of Munster Aralt (Harald), who is given as a third son of Ivar. There, according to CGG, the two were killed in the Battle of Cathair Cuan, presumably referring to a fortress of Donovan's, together with a great number of foreigners or Norse:Todd, p. 103 But the Annals of the Four Masters, containing a record of this possibly identical battle, do not mention the death of Donovan, nor even mention Harald at all: It is unclear if the Annals of Inisfallen refer to the same or a different event the previous year, but here they do not mention Donovan: In any case, these two accounts support the claims of the O'Donovans in their pedigrees that Donovan survived the battle with Brian.Irish Pedigrees: O'Donovan, Lords of Clancahill No. 107, from O'Hart, p. 197Cronnelly, p. 254 These state that he was killed later in the \\"battle of Croma\\" against Dunchuan mac Cenn√©tig, a brother of Brian, and was assisted by the troops of Curradh-an-Roe or Curra the Red and the Corcu Baiscinn, many of whom were slain on the field. However these accounts, as well as the one given by John Collins of Myross, and the one found in the Dublin Annals of Inisfallen, state that Donovan's Norse companion was Auliffe (Olaf), whose parentage is not given. These last two also disagree with the above in stating that Donovan and his Norse companion were killed here. According to the first:O'Donovan, Four Masters, Volume II, p. 706, notes Collins of Myross took his own account from an apparently now lost source:O'Donovan, Four Masters, Volume II, pp. 706‚Äì7, notes Finally, both these accounts, that of CGG, and possibly those in the pedigrees, may all be contradicted by a notice in the Annals of Inisfallen in 980, leaving only the above account in the Annals of the Four Masters and brief notice in the Annals of Inisfallen completely accurate. Here, curiously, no cause of death is given: Concerning the above accounts, the Dublin Annals of Inisfallen are a frequently unreliable 18th century compilation and the source used by Collins is of unknown date, while the earliest account of Donovan's slaying by Brian's army is found in the early 12th century CGG, written over 120 years after the alleged events. The remaining sources offer no confirmation. As Donovan was evidently still alive in 978 he may have supported M√°el Muad in the fateful Battle of Belach Lechta, but this is nowhere recorded. No details of this battle, besides his ally's death, are known for certain, nor even its location. Territory The identity of Ress or Ressad is uncertain. According to Paul MacCotter it is \\"apparently an archaic name for U√≠ Chairpre or one of its divisions.\\"MacCotter, p. 185 Noting that Donovan's son Uainide is styled king of U√≠ Chairpre at his death two years later in 982,AI982.3 MacCotter states \\"Clearly, U√≠ Dhonnabh√°in must have been local kings of... U√≠ Chairpre √çochtarach.\\" This was the northeasternmost local petty kingdom or t√∫ath within U√≠ Fidgenti and was adjacent to Norse Limerick, a considerable portion of the surrounding settlement of the same name apparently lying within Donovan's own native kingdom. Directly cross the River Shannon to the north could be found Brian's own sept of the D√°l gCais, namely the U√≠ Tairdelbaich or U√≠ Blait. =Occupied?= According to the author of CGG the U√≠ Chairpre/U√≠ Dhonnabh√°in were in \\"occupation\\" of territory he claims actually belonged to the D√°l gCais, namely \\"... Caille Cormaic, from Oclan to Luimnech, and from Cnam-Coill to Luachair.\\"Todd, p. 87 This region has been difficult to identify, but it apparently stretched east into the modern neighbouring County Tipperary, Cnam- Coill being found a mile or mile and a half east of Tipperary itself. Oclan or Hoclan has not been identified but presumably was to the north of this. Marriage(s) and issue It is the oral tradition of the family that Donovan married a daughter of his ally Ivar of Limerick, although two alternatives exist, each with support. The first is that she was actually the daughter of the later (2nd) Amla√≠b/Olaf mentioned above, himself possibly identical with Olaf son of Ivar of Limerick, who was killed along with his father in 977 but who may simply have replaced Aralt in the later accounts of the following battles. Clearly, there was a Danish influence on Donovan, as descendants of Donovan bore Danish names for more than three hundred years, including Amla√≠b Ua Donnub√°in, who was slain in 1201. In addition, based on naming conventions in the 10th century, it is assumed that Donovan (son of Ivar of Waterford) who was slain in 996, would have been named after his mother's brother, thus making Donovan (slain 977) his uncle. It is possible, that Ivar of Waterford was married to Donovan's daughter, or he could have been married to his sister; a conclusion can not be formed as the ages of the individuals is unknown, and classification into generations is not possible. In any case Donovan's known children were * Uainide (\\"Greenish\\") mac Donnub√°in, king of U√≠ Chairpre (died 982) ** other children? * Cathal mac Donnub√°in, possibly also king of U√≠ Chairpre or U√≠ Fidgenti ** Amla√≠b ua Donnub√°in *** O'Donovan family * Daughter (or sister) of Donnub√°in, assumed to have married Ivar of Waterford ** Donndub√°n mac √çmair (slain 996) *** other O'Donovans? ‚Äì once commonly believed,Encyclop√¶dia Britannica but so far unproven. ** other children Unfortunately no account at all is preserved of the nature of the connection, beyond intermarriage, between Norse Waterford and the O'Donovan family. The name Ragnall is likely to have entered the latter, where it became popular, from the former, where it seems to have been dynastic.

In fiction and popular history Donovan makes a number of appearances in Morgan Llywelyn's New York Times best-selling novel Lion of Ireland (1980). Here is mistakenly called king of \\"Hy Carbery\\" (U√≠ Chairpre), which he is never called in contemporary sources. This mistake is also common in many popular histories.

On 17 September 2005, the area opened replacing the previous Gum Tree Gully section. Based on the musicians of the same name, the area was the first of several to be installed at theme parks around the world; it is also currently the only one, following the closure of the area at various Six Flags parks. History During July 2005, Gum Tree Gully was closed to aid in the construction of Dreamworld's second children's area, Wiggles World. Only a narrow corridor remained for pedestrian access during the construction period. On 17 September 2005 Wiggles World officially opened to the public with a performance by The Wiggles. On the first anniversary of the opening of the area, Dreamworld added Dorothy's Rosy Tea Cup Ride. On 12 December 2006, American-based amusement park operator Six Flags released plans to partner up with The Wiggles to add Wiggles Worlds to some of their parks. In 2007, Six Flags Great Adventure, Six Flags Great America, and Six Flags New England all opened a Wiggles World at their park. This was followed by Great Escape in 2008 and Six Flags Fiesta Texas in 2009. In late 2010, Six Flags terminated licenses with various brands including The Wiggles. This saw the areas changed to more generic themes such as KIDZOPOLIS and Safari Kids. In mid-2012, Dreamworld announced that they would be adding a new ride to Wiggles World. It was later revealed to be the Big Red Boat Ride. The ride was officially opened on 14 December 2012 with 7 members of The Wiggles in attendance. By 2015, it has been incarnated into ABC Kids World which has additional children's Australian TV series such as Giggle and Hoot, Play School, and Bananas in Pyjamas. Attractions The entrance to the Big Red Car Ride. =Big Red Car Ride= The Big Red Car Ride is a dark ride that takes 6 guests at a time on a car journey through the Wiggles' house. The house features Wag's Kennel, Henry's Underwater Big Band, and Dorothy's rosy garden. The attraction opened with Wiggles World on 17 September 2005. The attraction was developed by two New Zealand-based firms who have previously worked for Walt Disney Imagineering prototyping autonomous vehicles. Arvus Group oversaw the project and subcontracted the manufacturing of the trackless ride system to Simtech, a now-defunct manufacturer. The trackless ride system relies upon a wire buried in the floor and allows the cars to rotate on the spot, something many track-based dark rides cannot do. The five vehicles are recharged at the station through an inductive charging system. On August 12, 2020, Dreamworld removed the attraction from their website. =Dorothy's Rosy Tea Cup Ride= Exactly one year after Wiggles World opened which is 17 September 2006, the area was expanded to include Dorothy's Rosy Tea Cup Ride. As the name suggests this ride is a tea cup ride. It features six separate cups for guests to board and spin as they wish. =Big Red Boat Ride= In 2012, Big Red Boat Ride was added to Wiggles World. This is a Zamperla Rockin' Tug amusement ride. The ride consists of a boat following a U-shaped track whilst slowly spinning. It is similar in concept to the Shockwave but provides a gentler ride experience. =Fun Spot= The Fun Spot is an activity centre featuring various interactive elements designed for children. The indoor attraction also features play kitchens, a mini supermarket, playhouses and a dress-up chest. During the area's expansion into ABC Kids World in 2015, the attraction was renamed the ABC Kids World Fun Spot. =SS Feathersword= The SS Feathersword is an interactive attraction situated alongside the Murrissipi River in Dreamworld. The attraction is a fa√ßade pirate ship which is used as a children's playground. During the area's expansion into ABC Kids World in 2015, the attraction was rethemed and renamed as the Giggle and Hoot Pirate Ship. Shopping and dining Wiggles World is also home to a merchandise shop and a dining outlet. Guests can purchase a variety of Wiggles merchandise items from The Wiggles Shop, while they can top up on food at the Yummy Yummy Food Outlet.Dreamworld and WhiteWater World Park Map (2009). Character appearances Wiggles World gives guests the chance to meet the Wiggles' friends.

It is the oldest church founded by African Americans in Los Angeles, dating to 1872. It has more than 19,000 members. History The church was established in 1872 under the sponsorship of Biddy Mason, an African American nurse and a California real estate entrepreneur and philanthropist, and her son-in-law Charles Owens. The organizing meetings were held in Mason's home on Spring Street and she donated the land on which the first church was built. The parent AME Church is a Methodist denomination founded by the Rev. Richard Allen in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1816. The AME Church now has over 2,000,000 members in North and South America, Africa and Europe, and includes other major churches such as the Greater Allen A. M. E. Cathedral of New York with over 23,000 members and the Reid Temple A.M.E. Church in Glenn Dale, Maryland with over 15,000 members. The former location of this church was at 8th & Towne (1902 - 1968) and in 1971, while at that location, it was nominated as Los Angeles' \\"#71 Landmark.\\" The location prior to that was on Azusa Street, a building that was rented to the Azusa Street mission. The 8th & Towne building was burned down July 4, 1972, and was razed. The current church, located in the Jefferson Park neighborhood of the West Adams district, was completed in 1968. It was designed by African American architect Paul R. Williams. In 1993 Federal authorities unearthed an alleged plot by young men associated with the \\"Fourth Reich Skinheads\\" to attack the First AME Church. The accused, said to be planning to blow up the church to ignite a race war, negotiated plea bargains with prosecutors. =Leadership= In 1977 Dr. Cecil L. \\"Chip\\" Murray was assigned to the church as pastor. At that time it had 300 members. Under Murray's leadership the church grew during the next 27 years to a membership of 18,000 people. In 2004 the Reverend Dr. John Joseph Hunter succeeded Cecil Murray as senior minister. In 2008 Hunter entered into a repayment plan to pay for tax obligations, family vacations, clothes and jewelry purchased with church funds. Several church leaders asked the church bishop to remove the pastor and his wife from authority. In November 2009 Hunter settled a sexual harassment complaint he denied for an undisclosed sum. In October 2012, in the face of continuing controversies about his ministry and the church's declining finances, Hunter was transferred to a San Francisco church, which refused to accept him. His replacement was J. Edgar Boyd. In December 2012, the church filed a lawsuit against Hunter, his wife, and others, charging that the Hunters have improperly maintained their control of the church and its assets. Mr. Hunter said he was blindsided by the lawsuit, and called the asset control changes lawful. Social involvement Kamala Harris and Eric Garcetti at the First AME Church of Los Angeles in 2020. The church is a center of political and social action in the city. In the 80's and 90's, the church created 40 task forces concerned with health, substance abuse, homelessness, emergency food and clothing, housing, training, employment and so on. President George H. W. Bush named the Church the 177th Point of Light for outreach in community services. In December 1989 city officials including Mayor Tom Bradley and First AME leaders broke ground for FAME Arms, a 40-unit apartment complex for physically disabled, low-income people in Southwest Los Angeles. After an earthquake in January 1994 FAME Renaissance, the nonprofit economic development arm of First AME Church, helped provide loans of up to $25,000 for affected small and new businesses who could not get help otherwise. In September 2009 the church launched an open-air fresh produce market to bring healthful foods to residents of South Los Angeles.

The film was one of the last black and white films released by Universal Pictures, and Stanwyck's final film role. Plot Irene Trent is unhappily married to a blind, pathologically possessive millionaire inventor, Howard. Howard and Irene's palatial mansion is packed with an endless assortment of cuckoo clocks, all in perfect synchronization, and Howard tape records all conversations in the house for later reference, hoping to catch Irene plotting an illicit liaison. Irene thus lives in a constant state of dread, wondering how far Howard's jealousy will go. Yet despite Howard's continual accusations of infidelity, Irene remains faithful to Howard, albeit with nightly recurrent dreams of a fantasy lover and an attraction to Howard's personal attorney, Barry Moreland, the only visitor allowed in the house. Howard spends most of his time working in his laboratory on a variety of projects, the nature of which he refuses to divulge to anyone. As tensions mount, Irene feels trapped in a loveless, lonely relationship. But suddenly, everything changes: Howard is killed by an explosion in his laboratory, and Irene inherits the house and Howard's entire fortune. The laboratory itself, a charred wreck, is secured from the rest of the house by a padlock so that no one may enter it. Irene, after consulting with Barry Moreland, decides to move out of the house, and into the back room apartment of a small beauty shop she owns, \\"Irene's,\\" which she operated before she met and married Howard. Almost immediately, the dreams begin again, with increasing intensity, until they take the form of an \\"ideal\\" man‚Äîknown only as \\"The Dream\\". Night after night, \\"The Dream\\" appears before Irene, whisking her away to a bizarre wedding ceremony in which she \\"marries\\" \\"The Dream\\" in front of a group of wax figure witnesses, or engages in a harmless tryst over champagne. Irene begins to doubt her sanity and unaccountably finds herself wishing to return to the nightmarish house she shared with Howard. But the reality behind Irene's dreams is a secret that The Night Walker withholds until the very end; a bizarre and complex tale of murder, betrayal, and deception. Cast * Robert Taylor as Barry Morland * Barbara Stanwyck as Irene Trent * Judi Meredith as Joyce * Hayden Rorke as Howard Trent * Rochelle Hudson as Hilda * Marjorie Bennett as Manager * Jess Barker as Malone * Tetsu Komai as Gardener * Lloyd Bochner as The Dream Production Modestly budgeted, and shot entirely at Universal City, the film was a change of pace for Castle, who usually relied on gimmicks to sell his films, such as \\"Emergo\\" for House on Haunted Hill, or \\"Percepto\\" for The Tingler. This time, Castle relied on Bloch's reputation as the author of the novel on which Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is based, as well as the re-teaming of Stanwyck and Taylor, who had been married from 1939 to 1951, as being sufficient to publicize the film. Originally titled The Dream Killer, the role of Irene Trent was first offered to Joan Crawford (an old friend of Stanwyck) who declined as she was committed to appearing in Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte. When asked if they had any objections to appearing in the film together, (Robert Taylor had remarried after his divorce from Barbara Stanwyck), Taylor replied \\"It's all right with me if it's all right with her,\\" and Stanwyck said \\"Of course not--but you'd better ask Mr. and Mrs. Taylor.\\" When asked if it was all right with her, Taylor's current wife Ursula Thiess said only \\"not necessarily.\\" Despite all of Castle's efforts, and mixed but generally favorable reviews, the film was not a financial success. It marked the end of Castle's most influential period as a director, although he would go on to produce and direct a number of additional films for Universal, and later, Paramount Pictures. It was Stanwyck's final film role in a career that began in 1927. She worked exclusively in television after this. Availability After many years of unavailability on home video (aside from a 1993 VHS release), the film was finally released on DVD by Universal Pictures and Turner Classic Movies as one of their \\"TCM Selects\\" titles on December 7, 2015, as part of a Double Feature with Dark Intruder from 1965. Shout! Factory later released the film on Blu-ray Disc for the first time on February 20, 2018.

Kramer was United States Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor from 2008 to 2009. He was President of Freedom House from October 2010 to November 2014. He is currently a non-resident fellow at the McCain Institute. Life and career David J. Kramer was born in Malden, Massachusetts in December 1964 to Jewish parents. He grew up in Middleborough, Massachusetts where he studied Russian in high school. He was educated at Tufts University, receiving his B.A. in Soviet Studies and Political Science in 1986. His advisor there was Sally Terry. Kramer then went on to get his M.A. in Soviet Studies in 1988 at Harvard University. In 1983 Kramer and his parents traveled to the Soviet Union to meet a relative who was still living in Latvia.http://adst.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Kramer-David.pdf He continued to make trips back to Latvia to visit family starting in 1992. After university, Kramer was a Lecturer in Russian Studies at Clark University, a Teaching Fellow for Adam Ulam at Harvard University, and a consultant for Arthur D. Little in Cambridge, Massachusetts. During the collapse of the Soviet Union, he was an analyst for The Christian Science Monitor Network. In 1990 Kramer, his brother Mark Kramer, Nicholas Daniloff, Natalie Rumer, and other associates from the Russian Research Center at Harvard opened a consulting business called the Cambridge East-West Consulting Group Inc.. The business did not last long, however. Kramer moved to Washington, D.C., and began working at the Center for Strategic and International Studies for Stephen Sestanovich in 1993, on Ulam's recommendation. He followed Sestanovich to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, becoming Associate Director of the Russian and Eurasian Program there, and setting up the Carnegie Moscow Center. He worked briefly as a Senior Fellow at the Project for the New American Century, before joining the United States Department of State as Executive Director of the United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy in April 2000. He next served as Special Advisor to the Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky, from June 2001 to October 2003. Kramer then became a professional staff member for the Policy Planning Staff. From July 2005 to March 2008, he was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs under Dan Fried. While there Kramer worked on issues related to Belarus, Moldova, Russia, Ukraine, and nonproliferation. In 2008, President of the United States George W. Bush nominated Kramer as Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, and, after Senate confirmation, he held this office from March 21, 2008 to January 20, 2009. While there he led the resumption of the human rights dialogue with the Chinese, traveling to Beijing in May 2008. He spent much of his time at this post traveling to places like Hanoi, Vietnam, twice to Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia, among others. Kramer left his position at the State Department during the transition in January 2009, and became a Senior Transatlantic Fellow at the German Marshall Fund. He went on to become executive director of Freedom House on October 4, 2010. On June 18, 2014 Freedom House announced that Kramer planned to resign that fall. On October 1, 2014 Freedom House announced that Mark P. Lagon would replace him in 2015. In November 2014, Kramer became the Senior Director for Human Rights and Human Freedom at the McCain Institute. In February 2013, Kramer caused controversy at the bicentennial North American Invitational Model United Nations, when Kramer's opening keynote speech, which was rife with incrimination of the Chinese citizenry for obsequiousness towards the Chinese government and Communist Party, incited a walkout of 300 Chinese visitors, prompting Kramer to cut the much-advertised speech short. Kramer has since pushed back on the backlash, suggesting that the Chinese students who were invited to the event are close to the Chinese political elite, and that their walkout only reinforced the point of his remarks. Later, Kramer suggested that students close to authoritarian power groups should not have been invited to an event focused on the promotion of peace and diplomacy. Mr. Kramer currently serves as a member of the board of directors of the Halifax International Security Forum and a Member of the Advisory Council for the George W. Bush Presidential Center's Human Freedom Project,http://www.bushcenter.org/people/david-j-kramer.html as well as a member of the International Advisory Council at the Center for European Policy Analysis.http://cepa.org/International-Advisory-Council/Kramer In addition, Kramer is a member of the Ukraine Today media organization's International Supervisory Council. In 2016 Kramer argued that the Minsk II peace agreement should be scrapped and western sanctions on Russia maintained. In his book, Back to Containment, published in 2017, Kramer excoriated various elder statesmen of the United States, such as Henry Kissinger, for undertaking hybrid back-channel efforts to re-approach Russia, accusing them of naivete and violation of the Logan Act. Kramer contends that these actions undermined American security vis-a-vis Russia and the region, citing Kissinger's inclusion into Myrotvorets, Ukraine's semi-official blacklist. In 2018, he was on a list of Americans to be questioned by the Russian government. David Kramer, the then-Sen. John McCain aide who leaked the Christopher Steele dossier on President Trump, testified in a libel case that he spread to journalists the contents of the Steele dossier during the presidential transition. Kramer was identified as the source of the dossier in a recently unsealed deposition related to the libel case brought by Russian businessman Aleksej Gubarev against Buzzfeed. In 2017, in an article for a Politico Magazine, Kramer called for the most edgewise brinkmanship in tailoring new policy towards Russia, especially on the domestic side, including obligating dual Russian-American citizens to relinquish their Russian citizenship or face deportation.https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-sanctions-obama-putin- trump-gop-turn-up-heat/ See also *2018 Russia‚ÄìUnited States summit *Timeline of investigations into Trump and Russia (2017) References Copyright ¬© 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

In the 1920s, while working for the French customs service, Bonifas took classes in acting at the Conservatoire de Paris in his spare time. He left with the first prize for comedy, which allowed him to join the Od√©on Theatre in 1933, then the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise in 1938. He made his first film appearance in 1935 in a version of Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, directed by Pierre Chenal. During World War II he served as a lieutenant in the artillery, was badly wounded, and evacuated from Dunkirk with his unit. In London he joined the Free French, and worked for Radio Londres broadcasting to occupied France. In 1942 he appeared in the film The Foreman Went to France. In 1943 he formed \\"The Moli√®re Players\\", who staged a repertoire of mainly Moli√®re works in London theatres, as well as in regional towns and at French army barracks. In 1944 \\"The Moli√®re Players\\" appeared in the short film Aventure malgache directed by Alfred Hitchcock. This written by, and based on the experiences of, Jules Francois Clermont, an actor in Bonifas' troupe working under the name of Paul Clarus, who had operated an illegal radio station Madagascar Libre in Madagascar while the island was under Vichy control. Bonifas then appeared in a number of other British films, including Two Fathers with Bernard Miles, directed by Anthony Asquith, and had minor roles in the musicals Heaven Is Round the Corner and Champagne Charlie, the action adventure film The Man from Morocco, the comedy-drama Johnny Frenchman and the horror film Dead of Night. Bonifas returned to France in 1946 and resumed his career in theatre, specializing in comedy, but also taking dramatic roles. His later film career included appearances in Trapeze (1956), The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1956), Fanny (1961), Charade (1963), Greed in the Sun (1964), The Train (1964), Is Paris Burning?

The band is named after the character Kilgore Trout in the Kurt Vonnegut classic Breakfast of Champions. Through a number of band name and line-up changes, Kilgore released two albums, Blue Collar Solitude (1995) and A Search for Reason (1998). The band landed a slot on the 1998 Ozzfest. They followed with a 1998 national tour with Slayer and Fear Factory and a 1998 European tour with Fear Factory and Spineshank. History The band started in 1991 at Rhode Island Catholic high school La Salle Academy, Providence. Once or twice a semester, the bands would gather for concerts attended by most of the student body. This allowed many of the musicians their first concert opportunities. Outside of the school, the band began to work on original music influenced by Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Metallica and Faith No More. The band was composed of songwriter Brian McKenzie (guitar), Bill Southerland (drums), Jason Smith (bass), Mike Pelletier (guitar) and Jay Berndt (vocals). The band was first known as \\"Regicide\\" during high school and played its first shows at band concerts at La Salle Academy, Providence. After high school they changed their name to Smudge, and started to develop and fine tune their sound. The music became more aggressive containing a groove element with hints of their early influences as well as elements of the New York hardcore scene. Jay Berndt‚Äôs lyrics were influenced by the Beat Generation authors, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Franz Kafka and Charles Bukowski. His vocal style was sometimes compared to Glen Danzig of the Misfits or Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots. The fast almost hardcore-like songs, along with Jay Berndt's lyrics and vocal melodies, allowed the band to really stand out. They released their first demo cassette called Spill (1993) and began playing shows at numerous Providence clubs and opening for established acts as The Cro-Mags, Sick of It All, Sheer Terror and Life of Agony. After discovering an Australian pop-punk band by the same name, they changed their name to Stain. As Stain, they released another cassette demo, Die Cast, in 1994. It was the release of Die Cast that brought the band to the attention of manager Scott Cohen (music business) and Unsound Records (subsidiary of Warner Bros. Records), with whom they signed a recording contract. Around this time Berndt suggested the band name \\"Kilgore Smudge\\" as a nod to the protagonist from the classic Kurt Vonnegut novel Breakfast of Champions. Blue Collar Solitude (1995) In 1995, Kilgore Smudge released Blue Collar Solitude, recorded in Los Angeles with producer Howard Benson. The band opened for acts such as Marilyn Manson, Biohazard, Clutch and Sublime. The months spent on the road took its toll on Jason Smith (bass), who was replaced in 1996 by Steve Johnson. A Search for Reason (1998) The band flew out to Los Angeles for 4 months to write, rehearse and record A Search for Reason, which was produced by Ed Stasium. Marty O'Brien was then asked to join the band to replace Steve Johnson. The band marked the release of A Search for Reason with a string of east coast dates starting at New York City‚Äôs Coney Island High club. As a new management deal was inked, the band shortened their name to just \\"Kilgore\\" and then landed a spot on Ozzfest 1998. While on tour with Ozzfest, Kilgore recorded a cover of Pantera's \\"Walk\\" for Extreme Championship Wrestling. The song was used as Rob Van Dam's entrance music. They followed Ozzfest with a 1998 national tour with Slayer and Fear Factory, and finished the year with a European tour with Fear Factory and Spineshank. Break-up and reunion Singer Jay Berndt left the band and the music industry in early 1999. In 2005, he returned to music by fronting Providence country band The Revival Preachers and released an album, Breathin' Through a Bruise. He is currently signed to North Carolina record label Rusty Knuckles and will release a solo album called Sad Bastard Songs in October 2010. In 2003, guitarist Brian McKenzie began performing as a solo singer/songwriter and released two solo albums. In 2009, McKenzie began working with Jay Berndt who produced his forthcoming album, Resolution, to be released in 2010. Pelletier, Southerland and O'Brien moved to Los Angeles in 2000 to look for a new singer for Kilgore. Shortly after arriving, Marty O'Brien began playing with Tommy Lee's Methods of Mayhem as well as providing session work for other artists. He now plays with We Are the Fallen. Mike Pelletier began scoring video game soundtracks and was playing with In for the Kill. Bill Southerland returned to Providence and has been working with children for the last few years. In 2008, Southerland and Berndt reunited for a short time in a heavy metal band called Bloodwitch which also featured members of Massachusetts band Seemless. In 2007, original members Jay Berndt, Brian McKenzie, Bill Southerland, and Jason Smith reunited to play a benefit show in Providence, RI called \\"Fight to Remember\\". The band helped to raise over $13,000 and all proceeds went to Susan G. Komen for the Cure and National Philanthropic Trust for breast cancer treatment and research. Stated on their facebook page, they are going to record new music and tour in 2017. On December 23, 2017, the band released a new song titled \\"Death On The Installment Plan\\". Their new EP Someday This War Is Going To End will be released on December 29, 2017.

Schwartz Professor of Government at Cornell University. He was a subject-matter expert on English and American political thought and history. Research Kramnick has researched, written, or edited about twenty treatises. His Bolingbroke and His Circle: The Politics of Nostalgia in the Age of Walpole was awarded the Conference of British Studies Prize for the best book on British politics. His other works include the Godless Constitution: A Moral Defense of the Secular State, co-authored with R. Laurence Moore, studies of Edmund Burke, a biography of the English socialist Harold Laski, and an edition of The Federalist Papers. Kramnick edited American Political Thought (2009) with Cornell‚Äôs Professor Theodore Lowi. An excerpt: > ‚ÄúAmerica has a conservative political tradition that is just as broad and > deep as the liberal tradition. But the two are rarely in true competition, > let alone dialectical tension. They are as ships passing the day ‚Äì > conservatism being local and parochial, liberalism more cosmopolitan; > conservatism concerned with order and obligation, liberalism with > consequences and satisfactions. One pursues goodness, the other > happiness.‚ÄùAmerican Political Thought, eds. Isaac Kramnick and Theodore J. > Lowi 2009. Professor Kramnick‚Äôs research has perhaps been less data-oriented than directed toward a textual critique of the metaphysical, the product of extensive reading and writing. This is true of his 1986 work on Joseph Priestley, author of The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated (1777). The Godless Constitution Kramnick's controversial treatise, written with Cornell co-faculty member R. Laurence Moore, does not deny that the Republic's founding generation had religious beliefs. Rather, The Godless Constitution argues that the founding fathers believed that a clear separation between religious and civil authority could prevent a specific kind of tyranny. Kramnick and Moore suggest that the colonial 18th century American eastern seaboard experience proved that civil magistrates given religious authority used that power irresponsibly. By separating church and state, one preserved the integrity of both.Matthew Dallek, \\"Politics: The Godless Constitution,\\" Wash. Post (Feb. 18, 1996). Personal life Isaac Kramnick and his wife, author Miriam Brody, have three children: Rebecca, Jonathan and Leah. Isaac and Miriam also have four grandchildren: Madeline, Anna, Samuel and Milo. Early life and career Kramnick was a native of Millis, Massachusetts, the son of Max and Sarah Shushulski Kramnick. The family emigrated from Grudno, which then was in the Silesia region of the German Empire.Kramnik Family Isaac Kramnick took his bachelors and doctoral degrees from Harvard (1959, summa cum laude; 1965) and studied at Cambridge University from 1959-1960. He taught at Harvard University, Brandeis University, and Yale University, and arrived at Cornell in 1972. Kramnick served as Chair of Cornell's Government Department (1981‚Äì1985; 1996‚Äì2001). He was Associate Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences (1986‚Äì1989) and Faculty-elected Trustee (1990‚Äì1994). Professor Kramnick was Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education at Cornell from 2001 to 2005. During this time he provided leadership for Cornell's initiative to reorganize undergraduate residence policy. Kramnick's commitment to the quality of Cornell's undergraduate living and learning included service as a founding member of the Cornell Faculty Fellows and Faculty-in-Residence programs and as a faculty leader in the University Committee on Restructuring West Campus Residential Life. Just after the turn of the century, Kramnick was responsible for the planning and coordinating academic programming for Cornell's North and West campuses. He also was in charge of undergraduate research opportunities, student advising, and the art and practice of teaching.Cornell Chronicle (July 12, 2001), supra. Honors Professor Kramnick was a fellow of Britain's Royal Historical Society. He has also served as President of the American Society for Eighteenth Century Studies (1989). In 1998, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences elected him fellow. Cornell University honored him with the Clark Award for distinguished teaching (1978) and the Steven Weiss Presidential Fellow Prize (1988) for teaching, and the Cornell Students chose him as \\"favorite professor of the year\\" (1996).

The Aqualoop Flume was a body slide which featured several helices before a splashdown in the main pool. Krakatoa's Revenge was the second slide to launch directly off the mountain. This tube slide was terrain based and weaved its way down the mountain before a splashdown in the main pool. The third slide was the Toboggan. It was launched from a separate tower attached to the mountain. Riders would sit on a hard plastic toboggan and would plunge down a steep drop and stop in a specially designed pool.

He served in the North Dakota House of Representatives from 1925 to 1932. Early life George Worner was born in Germany on October 13, 1855. His father George (1828 - 1905) emigrated to the United States with the family, settling in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. His mother died after they had arrived in Wisconsin. His father remarried and had three more sons. In 1874, the family moved to present day Richland County in Dakota Territory, homesteading near what is now the city of Great Bend. In 1879 married Augusta Brendel, a fellow German immigrant whose family had moved to the Dakota Territory from Iron Ridge, Wisconsin. George and Augusta had 8 children. Time in North Dakota The Worner family settled in Brandenburg Township in Richland County. They established a post office on their homestead in 1875, and named it Berlin in honor of their homeland. The post office was moved in 1882 to a site closer to Great Bend, North Dakota, and was closed permanently on July 12, 1883. George Worner was instrumental in the eventual establishment of Great Bend in 1888. Part of the city was platted on his homestead. Worner served as one of the first station agents in town for the Northern Pacific Railroad, operated the first general store, and served as one of the town's first postmasters. Worner reportedly hired future U.S. Senator Porter J. McCumber to work on his farm. Political career Worner was also active politically. He served in county government as one of Richland County's commissioners. He was elected in 1924 to the North Dakota House of Representatives, and served from 1925 to 1932.

Ryan then was assigned as personnel officer at the American Embassy in Tegucigalpa from 1970 to 1971. Ryan subsequently served as a consular officer at the American consulate general in Monterrey. In 1973, Ryan was assigned as administrative officer in the Bureau of African Affairs in Washington, D.C., from 1973 to 1975, and she served as a post management officer in the Bureau of African Affairs from 1975 to 1977. For the next three years, Ryan worked as a career development officer in the Bureau of Personnel. In 1980, Ryan received French language training, followed by assignments as administrative counselor in Abidjan from 1980 to 1981, and Khartoum from 1981 to 1982. From 1982 to 1983, Ryan served as an inspector in the Office of the Inspector General in the Department of State. She was the executive director of the Bureau of European and Canadian Affairs from 1983 to 1985. In 1985, she became the Executive Assistant to the Under Secretary of State for Management Ronald I.

In 1994, Ryan testified at a congressional hearing, advocating against a proposed provision to declare all members of Hamas as terrorists and prohibiting them from entering the United States. Ryan said that all Hamas members are not considered terrorists because Hamas performs some social welfare activities, such as giving economic, educational, and medical assistance to Palestinians.Weiss, Steve (February 25, 1994). \\"U.S. House Panel Ponders Ban on Hamas Members' Entry to U.S.]\\" Jewish Telegraphic Agency. p. 1.

Ryan testified that, during 2001, each consular officer stationed Saudi Arabia interviewed 200 people per day. Ryan said that consular officers did not review an applicants' local criminal record because they were so unreliable; in many countries, a person could bribe local police departments to delete their criminal history.Mollison, Andrew (November 1, 2001). \\"Student visas don't track terrorists, officials say Of 19 hijackers, one admitted to pursue studies\\". The Atlanta Constitution. p. A13. Ryan testified that it was unlikely that a consular officer would detect a terrorist during a visa interview. Ryan said that visa applications ask whether the applicant belongs to a terrorist organization, and applicants always say no. Ryan told Congress that consular officers were not given the intelligence necessary in order to detect and reject visa applicants suspected of committing terrorism. Ryan said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation refused to share this intelligence information with consular officers. Ryan said that it was up to the U.S. intelligence community to detect people at risk of committing terrorism before they apply for visas and then give the list of names to visa officers so that they can then refuse their visa applications. Despite terrorist leader Mohamed Atta having met with Osama bin Laden in 2000, Ryan said that the intelligence community had not informed Consular Affairs that Atta was a terrorist and that visa officers had no way of knowing that Atta was a terrorist.Malone, Julia (October 13, 2001). \\"Visa official faults intelligence agencies Series\\".

History and classification The species is known from only the holotype, a single, mostly complete adult female, now deposited in the Geological Survey of Canada collections as specimen number \\"GSC No. 22689\\". The shale specimen is from deposits along the Horsefly River in the Cariboo District of British Columbia, Canada. The holotype was first studied by Dr H M A Rice of the Geological Survey of Canada. Rice published his 1968 type description for P. campbelli in the Geological Survey of Canada professional paper number 67-59. The specific name campbelli was coined in honor of R. B. Campbell who collected the holotype specimen in 1959. Pseudosiobla campbelli is the smallest species of Pseudosiobla to be described from the fossil record. The single known female possesses a head, thorax and posterior segments of the abdomen which are dark brown to black. The central segments of the abdomen appear to have been pale colored. The wings are hyaline with very dark veins and short, stout hairs across the wing membrane. While the specimen is missing portions of her legs and antennae, her ovipositor is visible and well preserved. P. campbelli is distinguished from members of the related genus Eriocampa in general and E. tulameenensis found in the related lake deposits in Princeton, B.C. by several features: P. campbelli is notably larger than members of Eriocampa and the wing vein patterning is distinct. There are only two other described species of Pseudosiobla from the fossil record, P. megoura and P. misera. Both species are described from specimens found in the Florissant Formation of Colorado which, at 39 million years old, is younger in age then the Horsefly locality, dated to approximately 49 million years old. P. campbelli can be distinguished from both younger species in that P. campbelli is the smallest species of the three. P. megoura also possesses an abdomen which is twice as long as that of P. campbelli. P. misera has a larger and more elongate abdomen. In his 1908 paper on the Tenthredinoidea of Florissant, S.A. Rohwer, put the possibility of P. megoura and P. misera being the same species.

He first attempted to make the crossing in 1913, two years after Thomas William Burgess became the second person to successfully complete the swim, but was forced to abandon the attempt a mere five miles from the French side of the Channel. In 1916, Sullivan outswam Charles Toth (a competitive swimmer who would also successfully swim the distance in 1923), setting an American record of continuously swimming for 20 hours and 28 minutes while attempting to swim from Provincetown, Massachusetts to Nantucket. He made two more attempts at the channel crossing in 1920, his best effort leaving him 1.5 miles from the French coast before unfavorable tides forced him to give up. In a 1921 attempt, he was forced to quit while within five miles of France after swimming for 19 hours and 5 minutes.

Though the straight-line distance is 22.5 miles, choppy waters and capricious tides forced him to swim an estimated 56 miles.

Reception The film garnered negative reviews from audiences and mostly went unseen by critics, it currently holds a 50% audience approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 91 user reviews and 5.2/10 on IMDb based on 5 user reviews. Audiences mainly felt that the movie was too slow and boring, quoting that \\"Jean Rollin is really a mixed bag. For me he's at his best when he sticks to vampires and castles and artistic/strange symbolism and atmosphere. Those are what he knows, what he's about, and that's what he brings incredible magic and intrigue to.

Historical context At the beginning of the First World War Britain set up the Protectorate of Egypt and imposed martial law, at the same time giving a solemn pledge to defend Egypt and not call on the Egyptian people to aid them in the conflict. The Egyptians had become subject to British rule in the 19th century when their country was invaded and occupied by the British.Wavell 1968, pp. 25‚Äì6Wilson 1934, p. 3 However, the British quickly realised that they desperately needed the support of Egyptian labour in a land which was so inhospitable to Europeans.

They worked to manage sanitation, were employed as stevedores and on wharf construction. They loaded and unloaded lighters, carried stores for supply depots and loaded lorries for the ASC.Letter written by General Allenby in GS GHQ EEF February 1918 War Diary AWM4, 1-6-22 p. 21 They laid the pipelines, built the railway embankments and helped lay the track, loaded and unloaded the trains, manned the surf boats, stowed or discharged the cargoes of surf boats from supply and store ships, and were employed everywhere on conservancy duties.Bowman‚ÄìManifold 1923, p. 25Downes 1938, pp. 705‚Äì7 Landing stores near Gaza Railway Construction Team They constructed the duplication of the Zagazig to Ismailia section of the railway from Cairo to the Suez Canal, built metalled roads out into the Sinai desert and laid water pipelines.

At the beginning of December 1916, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force had a ration strength of 150,000 British and 6,000 Indian troops, and 13,000 Egyptian labourers.Keogh 1955, pp. 46 & 71Bruce 2002, p. 81 Egyptian Labour Corps moving along a Wire Netting Road Rail was laid at the rate of a month and the pipeline construction eventually caught up with the railway at El Arish in February 1917.Bruce 2002, p. 80‚Äì1 At this time General Harry Chauvel ordered the aerial bombing of the enemy to stop as the retaliation by German planes on the Egyptian Labour Corps was stopping the railway gangs from continuing the strategically vital railway on to Rafah.Cutlack 1941, p. 52 Under the supervision of administrative officers of corps, divisions and sanitary sections, troops worked alongside the Egyptian Labour Corps in the fight against pests in the Jordan Valley.Downes 1938, pp. 705‚Äì7 This involved, among other strategies, draining swamps, and constructing hard horse standings.Keogh 1955, p. 228 Near Jericho in 1918 a 600-strong company of the Egyptian Labour Corps worked for two months to suppress mosquitoes breeding in the overflow from the Ain es Sultan spring.Powles 1922, pp. 260‚Äì1 Recruitment This was carried out by native agents who visited villages in their sub-district under the direction of a district recruiting officer who was assisted by a medical officer.

The recruits enlisted for six months and were given an advance of English ¬£3/-/- to provide for dependents. At the Recruiting Depot the recruit was issued with blankets and an overcoat and at the corps or service depot he was disinfected, given clothes and equipment. In the Egyptian Labour Corps the pay was 5 P.T. per day while the other corps and services paid 6 P.T. per day plus clothing and rations.Letter written by General Allenby in GS,GHQ,EEF War Diary February 1918 AWM4, 1-6-22 p. 21 Egyptian Labour Corps engaged on road making, railway construction and laying water pipeline being paid at Romani in September 1916 These men were most often from extremely poor villagers and the daily inducement of 7 piastres (1 shilling and 6 pence) and rations was very attractive to them.

Then, for a consideration, the Muidir, Lord Lieutenant or Omdah, mayors of Egyptian towns, organised press gangs and the necessary native armed guards to keep the forced labour at work.Letter Wingate to Allenby, 8 May 1918 in Hughes 2004, pp. 154‚Äì5 It is also probable that members of the Egyptian Labour Corps were 'sealed' like members of the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps by a seal being attached to their wrists. Initially the periods of service appear to have started as quite short term but became very long term as their importance was recognised and the difficulty of finding more recruits increased.Carman & McPherson 1983, pp. 147‚Äì9Wingate to Allenby 8 May 1918 in Hughes 2004, pp. 154‚Äì5See also War Diary 3rd LHB April 1919 p. 43 and War Diary 4th LHB Weekly Report 5 to 12 April 1919 Appendix 29 which show the chain of command between the Army and the Muidir, and Omdah exercised during the Egyptian Rebellion.

At first Wingate contemplated \\"some form of compulsory service\\" but such a step would not be supported by the Sultan of Egypt and cause deep resentment throughout the country. A meeting at the Residency, in Cairo, decided that requisitioning labour from the villages through the Mudirs, Mamours and Omdas might prove effective. The meeting felt this corv√©e system would be supported by the Sultan and his Ministers and could be introduced without causing discontent among the general population.Letter Wingate to Allenby, 8 May 1918 in Hughes 2004, pp. 154‚Äì5 Organisation Grave of Sabit Harun Mohamed, Egyptian Labour Corps, in Adinkerke Military Cemetery, Belgium By 1917 the Egyptian Labour Corps had over 55,000 labourers, mainly organized into companies with 12 gangs forming one company. The gang was the working unit consisting of 50 men with a headman, often all belonging to one home village. These men often sang while they worked and this was thought to be an indication that they were happy, but one Egyptian chant sung by the workers was, \\"Kam Lehloh, Kam Yaum?\\" which translates as \\"How many days, how many nights?\\"Woodward 2006, p. 40; Bowman‚ÄìManifold 1923, p. 25 The Egyptian Labour Corps was described in February 1918 as organised into Companies of 600 men with a Subaltern commanding officer and two junior officers. Three to six of these Companies formed a Camp under an officer commanding Egyptian Labour Corps of an Area. The officers were at first drawn from Arabic speaking Anglo-Egyptians and afterwards NCOs and privates were recruited from British units and trained in Arabic. Their level of proficiency was recognised by a special rate of extra duty pay. Supervision was provided by the reis of each gang and by civilian foremen who were paid from English ¬£1/10/- to English ¬£15/-/- per month. These civilian foremen were graded as 'NCO Foremen' provided with a uniform and treated as acting Non-commissioned officers of the ELC.Letter written by General Allenby in GS, GHQ EEF February 1918 War Diary AWM4, 1-6-22 pp. 21-2 It was found to be 'practicable and advisable' to recruit different companies from different parts of Egypt and new gangs could be trained in particular types of work required to ensure efficient and rapid handling of stores and materiel.Letter written by General Allenby in GS, GHQ EEF February 1918 War Diary AWM4, 1-6-22 p. 21 Acknowledgement The great value of the service of the Egyptian Labour Corps was acknowledged by Allenby in his despatch of 16 December 1917 where he mentions the great value and importance of their service, their steadiness under fire and devotion to duty under difficult conditions.A Brief Record of the Advance of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force under the command of General Sir Edmund H.

Within limits of a decent debate, the ATKT system should be moderated (on a \\"live basis\\", instead of a \\"one size fit all\\") approach by competent education administration authorities. This can be based upon sound knowledge of the local,group-level & individual social dynamics (Election Years, Increased festivities, Sports events, Loss of personal relative/educators etc.,). This requires a perfection in co-ordination between local administrator's (such as DEO, Education Commissioners, Principals of Schools/Colleges, VC's of Universities), sound knowledge of the history of local events during academic sessions and an interface with counsellors. With the increased outreach of the internet and other media, it is easy to compare Education Systems by \\"arm-chair critics\\",\\"struggling teachers/educators\\" as well as \\"peer group of guardians/parents/senior students(guiding junior students, without training)\\".

Themes and symbolism  = Relationships = Susan Power uses the aspect of relationships as a sub-primary theme throughout The Grass Dancer. Harley and Pumpkin relationship in the beginning of the story which brings out the jealousy of Charlene Thunder. Crystal Thunder's (daughter to Charlene Thunder) love for a non-native Indian, Martin Lundstrom. Mercury Thunder uses her ‚Äúbad magic‚Äù out of revenge against Calvin Wind Soldier because he is wearing a belt that repels her spells to make him fall in love with her. Instead, Mercury Thunder casts a spell that makes him have an affair with his wife's sister, Evelyn. Power uses the idea of marriage as an end result throughout the book. Lydia Wind Soldier marries Calvin Wind soldier after two months of dating. Power continues the struggle of power in relationships between ‚Äúlove, revenge, and jealousy.‚Äù = Non-Indian ideology = Susan Powers deals with the theme of non-Indian ideals throughout The Grass Dancer. Whether or not this is because she was not raised on the reservation is unknown, but there are many elements that point towards the theme of leaving the reservation and issues that are non-native Indians. Jeannette McVay coerces her students to share their real cultural stories with the class. Powers flirts with the notion of non-native Indian relationships with white partners throughout the story. Jeanette McVay and her husband have a baby that doesn't look white at all and Herod has an affair with a white woman named Clara Miller. Crystal Thunder (daughter of Anna/Mercury Thunder) also falls in-love with a white boy named Martin Lundstrom. Powers also deals with the notion of the end result of leaving the reservation. Charlene Thunder (1981) leaves the reservation after she tries to work some love magic to get Harley to fall in-love with her. She ends up leaving the reservation to go to Chicago to find her parents. = Ghost story = Throughout the novel the reader is presented with two legends of two fabled spirits, Red Dress and Ghost Horse. Red Dress became a spirit according to the legend to protect her descendants and was projected to be the start of the magical medicine of the Thunder family. While ghost horse is a warrior who chose to become a heyoka, or sacred clown, after his love Red Dress died. His spirit was said to guard over her body for one year. The legends states that both spirits are constantly seeking one another in the generations that follow. However towards the end of the novel it becomes clear that Red Dress is the only supernatural force influencing the novel, since Ghost Horse has left the earth in spirit form after he died on the battle field. Yet the legend does hold truth, since Charlene Thunder constantly seeks out the love of Henry both of which are descendants of Red Dress and Ghost Horse. = Overcoming adversity = Within the novel Charlene Thunder is faced with the problem of overcoming adversity imposed by the family tradition of magical medicine. Charlene's connection to Red Dress is through her grandmother, who refuses to allow Charlene to act on what she believes in and instead wants Charlene to follow in her footsteps of being the tribes witch. The connection to witchcraft ultimately creates more problems for Charlene of which she has no control, although the community recognized her lineage of holding great power ultimately she is shunned by association. Ultimately Charlene is faced with either becoming the witch that her family has destined her to be, or overcoming all adversity and living her life free and how she wants. Charlene chooses to be free and live her life away from the imposed tradition of her family's magical ties. = Magical realism = Magical realism is found throughout Susan Power's novel The Grass Dancer. Magical realism blends the natural with the supernatural. Magical realism in The Grass Dancer makes its appearance during certain rituals performed by the Dakota tribe, such as when Frank Pipe retells the story of when someone was killing reservation dogs and shooting coyotes. The tribe decided to perform a Yuwipi ceremony in order to discover who the killer was. During the ceremony, coyote spirits appeared and exposed the killer by carrying off one of the tribe members through the window of the gymnasium. The tribe members later found his body abandoned at Angry Butte with bite marks on his body. The coyotes not only identified the criminal, but they also sought justice. According to Roland Walter who wrote ‚ÄúPan-American (Re)Visions: Magical Realism and Amerindian Cultures in Susan Power's The Grass Dancer, Gioconda Belli' s La Mujer Habitada, Linda Hogan's Power , and Mario Vargas Llosa's El Hablador,‚Äù ‚ÄúMagical realism realizes the hybridization of the natural and the supernatural by focusing on specific histori- cal moments in order to problematize present-day disjunctive reali- ties‚Äù (Walter 66). When Margaret Many Wounds passes away in 1969, Harley Wind Soldier witnesses through a television screen his grandmother's spirit dancing on the moon while Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin first set foot on its surface. Margaret Many Wounds‚Äô spirit calls out to her grandson, ‚ÄúLook at me, look at the magic. There is still magic in the world‚Äù (Power 121). = Traditions = The Grass Dancer often describes a Yuwipi ceremony where tribe members gather together to call on the spirits for answers. An example of this ceremony happens in chapter 3 when Archie Iron Necklace has a dream about a medicine hole. During the Yuwipi ceremony, the spirits of Sioux ancestors guide the tribe members on a vision where Archie Iron Necklace, Herod Small War, Frank Pipe, and Harley Wind Soldier appear as young Sioux Indians riding their horses on the plain in the year 1877. On this day, one year after the Custer battle, four young warriors were trapped in the valley by white soldiers out for revenge. They prevented the warriors from escaping the valley, forcing their horses to die of starvation. When the soldiers discovered the corpses of the horses, the young warriors seemed to have vanished. The Yuwipi vision revealed how the four warriors managed to escape. The earth opened a hole and the four men were able to escape. (Power 85). Background The Grass Dancer was written in two and a half years, with half of the book written in the last eight weeks of the deadline.VG:Interview Susan Power The chapter titled \\"Medicine Hole\\" is inspired by a real life experience involving Susan Power's at the age of fourteen years old and her mother and two aunts, searching for a medicine hole in North Dakota.VG:Interview Susan Power In an interview with Shari Oslos from Voices from the Gaps, author Susan Powers discusses her take on the critics reaction to The Grass Dancer. She reminds her readers that the culture told in the plot is her reality. A lot of people who have read the novel has been said to be drawn to her \\"magical realism.\\" But in fact, Powers ensures that this was not her literary strategy. In an interview with Emerson College, Susan Powers talks about her early ambitions to become a writer. \\"I've been writing all my life, even before I could read I filled pages with the letters I knew from the Alphabet song, and would seek out my parents, hold up the nonsense paper and declare, \\"This is what I wrote!,\\" then I would tell them whatever story I concocted on the fly.\\" Critical reception It received the 1995 Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award.List of Hemingway/PEN winners, accessed 5 August 2010.

A later student of his school, Gregory of Catino, wrote a fuller history of the monastery partly based on Hugh's earlier account.Marios Costambeys, Power and Patronage in the Early Medieval Italy: Local Society, Italian Politics, and the Abbey of Farfa, c. 700‚Äì900 (Cambridge: 2007), 11.

Chris Abani depicts the poverty and violence in Lagos and how it affects the everyday lives of Elvis and his family. Having emigrated from Nigeria himself as a result of the Biafran War, Abani's novel touches on many issues relevant to corruption, poverty, and violence within the country. Elvis's story also touches on issues related to globalization, and how Nigeria's impoverished communities are affected by this phenomenon. The main focus of this story is on Elvis and how he survives in the often harsh environment that is Nigeria's largest city; Elvis himself is a complex and sympathetic character who clearly cares for his family despite a turbulent upbringing. However, this is complicated by the numerous illegal and morally questionable jobs he takes part in with his friend Redemption. Plot summary Set in the Nigerian city of Lagos, GraceLand is the story of a teenage boy named Elvis Oke, who is trying to escape the poverty of his community. Starting out as an Elvis Presley impersonator, he takes on a wide variety of jobs, many of which place him in criminal situations. The novel jumps between two settings, the village of Afikpo from 1972 until 1981, and Lagos from 1983 and onward. This allows readers to observe the shifting nature of Elvis‚Äô family dynamic, which changes drastically after the death of his mother and his subsequent move to Lagos. The complexities of maintaining familial and cultural ties in a modernizing society is brought up as well, which is mirrored in the dramatic fragmentation of Elvis‚Äô family as the novel progresses. In Lagos, Elvis is torn between the influences of two characters: his friend Redemption, and the self-proclaimed King of Beggars. Many of the illegal ventures that Elvis partakes in are due to Redemption's influence, and these escapades often lead to conflict with a man known as the Colonel, a prominent and corrupt member of a brutal military regime. The King of Beggars, on the other hand, attempts to direct Elvis to a different path. His presence throughout the novel serves as a crude, and often ignored, moral compass. Towards the end of the novel, the story briefly diverts its attention from Elvis to take on a slightly larger scope. It depicts the struggle of Elvis's community in resisting the demolition of its home. Elvis‚Äô father and the King of Beggars both play prominent roles in leading the community in protests against the corrupt government's crackdown on the impoverished residents of the slum.  Characters  Since the novel frequently alternates between the present of 1983 in Lagos, and during the past of Afikpo from 1972 until 1981, it is important to separate both time periods. Present: Lagos 1983 : * Elvis: Elvis is an avid dancer and an Elvis impersonator. Not having completed school, he attempts to survive in the chaotic Lagos by making a living for himself. Inexperienced and naive, he meets all kinds of individuals in Lagos, who greatly influence his actions throughout the novel. * Sunday: Elvis‚Äô father. Fallen from grace and broken hearted, he spends most of his time drinking. He used to be severe on Elvis when he was young, causing Elvis to lose all respect for his father. Barely cares about his new wife and Elvis' stepmother * Comfort: Elvis‚Äô stepmother. She dislikes Elvis but is loyal to his father despite his faults. * Tunji, Akin and Tope: Comfort's children. They regard Elvis with respect. * Redemption: Ill-behaved, roguish friend of Elvis. He take Elvis under his wing and teaches him how to survive and adapt to a criminal lifestyle. Redemption is an expert at making connections with the people who will serve his purposes; he is not afraid of committing illegal actions to make ends meet. * King of Beggars: One eyed beggar that Elvis meets on the streets of Lagos. He has a dark past and tries to give season and warn Elvis of the dangers of Lagos and frequenting shady characters. * The Colonel: In charge of the security at Lagos. He is corrupt, impulsive and extremely violent. He does not hesitate to abuse his powers in his notoriously horrible fashion for monetary gain. Past, Afikpo 1972 until 1981: * Joseph: Elvis‚Äô Uncle, wealthy and crooked. * Beatrice: Elvis‚Äô mother, afflicted with breast cancer from which she dies. * Innocence: Elvis's eldest cousin, child soldier. He takes part in a crooked scheme with uncle Joseph. * Oye : Elvis‚Äô grandmother, Beatrice's mother. She support Beatrice through her sickness and tries to comfort Elvis. * Felicia: Elvis‚Äô aunt. She shares a wicked past with Elvis, and helps him to cope with the passing away of his mother. * Efua: Elvis‚Äô cousin. They both share intimate and painful memories. Felicia speculates that Efua followed Elvis to Lagos. * Confusion : town jock, who Elvis regarded highly given the fact that he had the courage to do what he loved as a living.  Themes  = Globalization = GraceLand addresses the topic of globalization in a number of ways throughout the novel. Largely set in Lagos, Nigeria between the 1970s and 1980s, the story takes place at time where modernization and western culture conflict with traditional modes of thought. The novel can often be seen as critical of the foreign influences that operate within Nigeria. The western influences in GraceLand often work in exploitative manners, such as American cigarette companies distributing their products to children in movie theaters. The description of how the World Bank takes advantage of the Nigerian people under humanitarian pretenses is also a clear indictment of globalization. However, it is necessary to observe that global influences also have positive implications in certain areas of the book. For example, it is only the presence of foreign journalists that prevent the Colonel from massacring the protesters at the end of the novel. = Poverty = The novel traces the trajectory taken by Elvis in an attempt to make a living in a slum in Lagos. Elvis‚Äô story shows how difficult making a living can be in impoverished societies, particularly in cases where the regime is a brutal military dictatorship. Elvis goes through a number of jobs, which grow increasingly desperate as the novel progresses. After failing to succeed as a street performer, Elvis goes from being a laborer, to a male escort, to an unwitting human trafficker, and finally to working as a caretaker of young beggars and living on the street. In addition to this, the events at the novel's conclusion expose the problems that arise when members of a community with no economic resources and nowhere to go are forced out of their homes. The reader sees how the demolition of one slum in an attempt to attack all the ‚Äúcenters of poverty and crime‚Äù in Lagos simply results in the expansion of another, with no attention given to the underlying issues of poverty that cause these slums and high crime rates. = Criminality = A large part of the novel is concerned with the concept of criminality. This includes murder, corruption, rape, drug smuggling, human trafficking, child prostitution, torture, and theft. Elvis's role in many of the aforementioned criminal acts brings to light the questions of culpability and innocence. Elvis continues to participate in shady activities with his friend Redemption's encouragement, which culminates in his involvement in a heinous human trafficking venture. The theme of criminality, which is also addressed through a number of other characters, is useful in discussing the justifications of crime. For Elvis, his criminal activities are motivated by his desire to lift himself out of poverty. Sunday's role in having his nephew Godfrey killed off on the other hand, raises the question of how honor killings can still function in a modern society.  Critical reception  GraceLand has been well received in the Western literary world. When asked for a book recommendation for \\"The Today Show\\"'s January selection, writer Walter Mosley recommended GraceLand. Both authors were featured in a discussion on the show, which helped it gain additional renown. Publishers Weekly highlighted its two-fold ability to tell the story of Elvis, and the larger issues of poverty and globalization: ‚ÄúRelating how an innocent child grows into a hardened young man, the novel also gives a glimpse into a world foreign to most readers-a brutal Third World country permeated by the excesses and wonders of American popular culture‚Ä¶The book is most powerful when it refrains from polemic and didacticism and simply follows its protagonist on his daily journey through the violent, harsh Nigerian landscape.‚Äù An equally positive review came from Booklist, which congratulated Abani by stating: ‚ÄúThe novel offers a vibrant picture of an alien yet somehow parallel culture, and while the plot runs off the rails from time to time, the mix of surrealistic horror and cross-cultural humor is irresistible. Abani is a first novelist with a very bright future.‚Äù However, other reviews, such as Kirkus Reviews, had a slightly more critical view on the novel, stating: ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the factual background is superior to the author‚Äôs fictional gifts; the grim story of the Oke family arouses our pity but fails to evoke a more active empathy that would enable readers to see their own yearnings and failures in the rather schematic characters. Worth reading for its searing depiction of modern Africa, but Abani is no Chinua Achebe.‚Äù Sophie Harrison from the New York Times Book Review also had some complaints. She heavily criticizes the novel's seemingly extraneous cultural material as chapter headings and the Nigerian recipes scattered throughout. She also comments that ‚Äúthe horrors of [Elvi‚Äôs life] are never really assimilated into the book‚Äôs imaginative structure, and the author‚Äôs interest in showing us his little-written-about world pulls GraceLand persistently in the direction of nonfiction.‚Äù Like most other reviewers, however, she ends on an overall positive note, calling it ‚Äúawkward and original but ultimately worthwhile.‚Äù GraceLand has won a host of awards, including the 2005 Hemingway Foundation/PEN AwardList of Hemingway Award winners, accessed 5 Aug 2010. and Hurston-Wright Legacy Award, was the Silver Medalist for the California Book Award, was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and Commonwealth Writers Prize,\\"UCR Visiting Professor Wins Prestigious Hemingway/PEN Fiction Award: Chris Abani‚Äôs GraceLand Also Nominated for Los Angeles Times Honor\\", U California Riverside Newsroom, 18 March 2005; accessed 5 Aug 2010. and was shortlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award.

Ski Team Skiing) is a sports video game produced by Mattel and released for its Intellivision video game system in 1980. Up to six players compete individually on either a downhill or slalom course to see who can complete the course the fastest. For the game's initial release, Mattel obtained a license from the U. S. Ski Team and used its name and logo in the game's box art. In 1988, INTV Corporation released an enhanced version of the game entitled Mountain Madness: Super Pro Skiing. During its initial release, U. S. Ski Team Skiing was sold by Sears for its private-label version of the Intellivision console, the \\"Super Video Arcade,\\" without the U. S. Ski Team name or logo. Subsequent re-releases, such as on the Intellivision Lives collection, have also left the game name simply as Skiing. Gameplay The object of Skiing is to complete the chosen course, either downhill or slalom, in the fastest time possible. Play begins by selecting the number of players for the game. Each player will have three heats in which to post their fastest time for the course. With multiple players, players take turns in the same order for each heat. Next, the players choose from one of 15 levels of steepness for the course, with higher numbers representing steeper (and thus, faster) courses. Lastly, the players select either the downhill or the slalom course for their race. Players control their skiers by using the controller to turn them until they reach the desired direction. The skiers will accelerate down the hill automatically, based on the steepness of the course. Players may take turns gradually, or by pushing an action button they may take a turn more sharply. Pushing another action button will cause the skier to jump over obstacles on the course, such as moguls. On both courses, players must successfully pass through a number of gates on their way down the course, with gates on the downhill course spaced farther apart than those on the slalom course. Missing a gate adds a five-second penalty to a player's race time. As each player begins their race, the current fastest time is displayed at the starting line, with their final time displayed after the player crosses the finish line. Reception Skiing was reviewed by Video magazine in its \\"Arcade Alley\\" column where it received little praise but only minor criticism as well. It was described as \\"nothing breathtakingly new\\", and as offering \\"an acceptable range of [gameplay] variations, although there is only one basic trail for each event\\". The reviewers found that multiplayer tournament mode is \\"equally entertaining\\" as the solo-play mode, but they concluded that the game \\"packs an amazing amount of detail into an easy-to-learn contest\\". In 1997, GameSpot alluded to Skiing as the best skiing video game of the past 17 years. Legacy After Mattel Electronics shut down in 1984, INTV Corporation obtained the assets to the Intellivision system and continued producing games for the console. In 1988, INTV released an enhanced version of the original Skiing game called Mountain Madness: Super Pro Skiing. It increased the number of available courses from one downhill and one slalom to 32 courses, each playable as a downhill course, a slalom course or with no gates at all. Options were also added to allow the computer to randomly generate a course (to simulate helicopter skiing) or for players to design courses of their own, although no provisions were included for players to save their designs. While the basic gameplay remains the same between the two titles, including support for up to six players and three heats of racing, Mountain Madness made additional changes. Players are able to preview the desired course prior to selecting it. Each player can choose their own steepness level, instead of a single setting being used for all players. More surface features were added to the original's trees and moguls, such as ice, powder and bare patches of ground. Also, the penalty for missing a gate was decreased from five seconds to two seconds. Mountain Madness: Super Pro Skiing appears alongside the original Skiing on the Intellivision Lives collection, and the Mountain Madness version was one of the launch titles for Microsoft's Game Room service on its Xbox 360 console and on Games for Windows Live. An updated version of Skiing of the same name has been announced for release on the Intellivision Amico video game console. It is one of the six games that will be included with the console.

It has rough, flaky bark, sometimes smooth on the branches, lance-shaped leaves, green to yellow flower buds in group of seven, white flowers and more or less cup-shaped fruit. It is a component of grassy woodland, often in low-lying or swampy areas, much of which has been cleared and it is under threat.Fruit of E. aggragata Description Eucalyptus aggregata grows as a medium-sized tree, reaching in height, with dark grey to black rough bark that is fibrous and flaky on the trunk and smooth whitish, cream-coloured or greyish bark on the uppermost branches. The leaves on young plants vary but are mostly elliptic to egg- shaped or broadly lance-shaped, long, wide and a slightly lighter shade of green on the lower side. The adult leaves are lance-shaped, alternately arranged along the stems and measure long by wide. They are the same colour on both surfaces. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel less than long. The buds are oval, green to yellow, long, wide with a cone-shaped or beaked operculum long. The flowers are white and appear from November to May. The fruit is cup-shaped to conical, long, wide. Taxonomy Eucalyptus aggregata was first formally described by Henry Deane and Joseph Maiden in 1900 from material collected at Wallerawang as the lectotype. The specific epithet (aggregata) is a Latin word meaning \\"clustered\\", referring to the fruit. Distribution and habitat Black gum is a rare species found from Capertee and Bathurst in central New South Wales, south through central and southern tablelands, with an isolated population near Woodend in Victoria. It has a very patchy and scattered distribution, as much of the land throughout its range has been cleared for agriculture. Eucalyptus aggregata grows in woodland and is associated with candlebark (Eucalyptus rubida), ribbon gum (E. viminalis), black sally (E. stellulata) broad-leaved peppermint (E. dives) and snow gum (E. pauciflora), with a grassy understory of river tussock (Poa labillardieri) and silver top wallaby grass (Joycea pallida). The soil is generally poorly drained, alluvial or swampy, with the black gum growing in low-lying areas. These are also natural frost hollows, where cold air persists in the cooler months. It is found at altitudes above , where there are heavy frosts and snow in winter. Conservation  This species is classed as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the New South Wales Government Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. Most of the extant population, estimated at 6300 to 8100 mature trees, are isolated. Their seedlings cannot compete against surrounding weeds. These trees are also threatened by hybridisation with E. viminalis and E. rubida. Climate change may also reduce the extent of frost hollows as the climate warms. Uses Although its soft timber is of little use, the species is versatile in that it grows in other areas where few other local species thrive, and can be a useful shade tree with its dense canopy. Its foliage can be used as fodder.

It was first described by Labillardiere in 1806. It is one of the most common eucalypts in the state, where it is often a tree in sclerophyll forest or a shrub in open scrub and heath. It is known to integrate with E. nitida and E. pulchella. Until 1882 Eucalyptus regnans was believed to be a member of this species, but has since been differentiated. Description The peppermint type slow growing tree can grow to a height of and forms a lignotuber. The bark is rough and covers most of the trunk. It is fibrous and dark grey in colour on the trunk and smooth and white forming ribbons on outer branches. The adult leaves are concolorous, slightly glossy to dull, bluish green aging to green in colour. the leaves are alternate supported on petiole in length. The leaf blade has a lanceolate to linear shape, typically long and wide with the base tapering evenly to the petiole. The foliage emits a strong peppermint odour when crushed. The axillary inflorescences are round with white flowers forming fruit that are cup-shaped to hemispherical in shape and about containing pyramidal to cuboid shaped brown seeds that are long. The tree, along with many other species of Eucalypt is susceptible to dieback. Distribution It is native in Tasmania found in the drier, north-eastern side of the island, from coastal areas extending well inland to the edges of plateaux where it is part of dry Eucalypt forest communities. It grows well in acid loam or sandy loamy soils that are well drained with a moderate rainfall. Uses The wood is commonly used as fuel for open fires, and for fencing.

Structure Two mature PDHA proteins come together with two PDHB proteins to form a heterotetrameric E1 subunit. Crystal Structures allowed for a model in which the enzyme undergoes a 2-A shuttle-like motion of its heterodimers to perform the catalysis. The protein encoded by the human PDHA2 gene is part of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex. The entire human complex is 9.5 MDa in size, and has been described as 60-meric, meaning there are over 60 components that are assembled to make the entire complex. These subunits are conserved across many species, as the function of this complex is essential for the generation of ATP for all eukaryotes. Each component is responsible for the catalysis of one step in this pathway; this complex exists for the purpose of channeling the intermediates of each reaction to the next enzyme, thus greatly increasing the rate of reaction. Function The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is responsible for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, with the final product being Acetyl CoA. Overall the complex catalyzes five reactions, with the overall reaction being: Pyruvate + CoA + NAD+ ‚Üí acetyl-CoA + CO2 There are three different coenzymes required throughout the 5 steps that this complex carries out: thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), lipoamide, and coenzyme A. This step is only one of the central metabolic pathway carried out by eukaryotes, in which glucose is oxidized to form carbon dioxide, water, and ATP. The E1 complex specifically uses the TPP cofactor to cleave the Calpha-C(=O) bond of pyruvate, and then transfer the acetyl group to the TPP coenzyme, thus resulting in an intermediate, hydroxylethyl-Tpp*E1, and producing CO2. The thiazolium ring on the TPP is ideal for adding to carbonyl groups and acting as an electron sink, or a group that can pull electrons from a reaction and stabilize an electron-deficient intermediate. =Regulation= The activity of the PDH complex in mammalian tissues is largely determined by the phosphorylation of certain subunits within the complex. As such, the absolute amounts of site-specific kinases and phosphates expressed in the mitochondria directly affect PDH activity. As this gene is mostly inactive, save for in testis tissue, a methylation mechanism is in place that inactivates this gene in somatic cells. Removing the methyl group from the coding region has shown to activate the enzyme in vitro. Clinical significance Mutations in the PDHA2 gene have been known to cause one form of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is characterized by the buildup of a chemical called lactic acid in the body and a variety of neurological problems. Signs and symptoms of this condition usually first appear shortly after birth, and they can vary widely among affected individuals. The most common feature is a potentially life- threatening buildup of lactic acid (lactic acidosis), which can cause nausea, vomiting, severe breathing problems, and an abnormal heartbeat. People with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency usually have neurological problems as well. Most have delayed development of mental abilities and motor skills such as sitting and walking. Other neurological problems can include intellectual disability, seizures, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), poor coordination, and difficulty walking. Some affected individuals have abnormal brain structures, such as underdevelopment of the tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (corpus callosum), atrophy of the exterior part of the brain known as the cerebral cortex, or patches of damaged tissue (lesions) on some parts of the brain. Because of the severe health effects, many individuals with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency do not survive past childhood, although some may live into adolescence or adulthood. Mutations primarily manifest in the PDHA1 gene. In women, this deficiency can be much harder to detect. This is because of the chance that there will be a skewed X inactivation pattern enzyme measurement in fibroblasts, meaning that the enzyme activity measurement may not be entirely accurate. Because the clinical presentation of this disorder overlaps heavily with deficiencies in oxidative phosphorylation, it is recommended to perform a detailed biochemical analysis on a muscle biopsy in females with a suspected pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, followed by molecular genetic analysis of the PDHA1 gene. The methylation as a form of regulation shows promise as a therapy for those with PDH deficiency due to mutations in other genes, as the gene has been activated in vitro via demethylation.

It is part of the Glens Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area. The village population was 2,614 in 2010. The village of Whitehall is located just south of the point where the Vermont border connects to the south end of Lake Champlain. History Whitehall Armory The village was founded in 1759 as \\"Skenesborough\\" by Major Philip Skene who built the barracks at Crown Point under Gen. Jeffrey Amherst, sold out his commission in the British army to establish the community and the many associated enterprises he planned and later carried out. It was the first settlement at Lake Champlain and became an important trade center. It was on one of two routes between English and French colonies. On May 9, 1775, Lieutenant Samuel Herrick, leading as an advance party for Benedict Arnold's and Ethan Allen's attack on Fort Ticonderoga, surprised Major Skene and his small garrison. While he intended to use Skene's boats to ferry men across the lake, his party didn't arrive in time. Skene's schooner was used later to capture St. Johns. In 1776, General Philip Schuyler built a small fleet of ships here. They were used by Benedict Arnold in the Battle of Valcour Island in October. The event led to Whitehall's modern-day claim to be the birthplace of the United States Navy. The surviving vessels returned to be destroyed to prevent their capture. General John Burgoyne led his forces southward through this area during the Saratoga Campaign. During the War of 1812 the village was a ship building community supplying vessels for naval battles on Lake Champlain.

US Route 4 and NY Route 22 diverge at the village. Whitehall village is the north end of the Champlain Canal, which connects the Hudson River to Lake Champlain. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 2,667 people, 1,104 households, and 705 families residing in the village. The population density was 568.6 people per square mile (219.6/km2). There were 1,288 housing units at an average density of 274.6 per square mile (106.0/km2). The racial makeup of the village was 98.13% White, 0.22% Black or African American, 0.19% Native American, 0.07% Asian, 0.82% from other races, and 0.56% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.65% of the population. There were 1,104 households, out of which 30.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 45.9% were married couples living together, 12.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.1% were non-families. 31.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 15.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial multienzyme complex that catalyzes the overall conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO2, and provides the primary link between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The PDH complex is composed of multiple copies of three enzymatic components: pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) and lipoamide dehydrogenase (E3). The E1 enzyme is a heterotetramer of two alpha and two beta subunits. This gene encodes the E1 beta subunit. Mutations in this gene are associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase E1-beta deficiency.  Structure  The PDH genes that comprise the E1 subunit are 1.36 kilobases long (alpha) and 1.69 kb long (beta). The PDHB gene has a total of 10 exons and 9 introns. All intron-exon splice junctions follow the standard GT/AG rule. There was an Alu family found in introns 2 and 8. The 5' flanking region gene contains a \\"CAAT\\" consensus promoter sequence but no \\"TATA\\" sequence. The transcription start site is an adenine residue located 132 bases upstream from the initiation codon in exon 1. The mRNA species that results from transcription of PDHB has been experimentally determined, via Northern blotting, to be 1.6 kb in length, although another fragment 5.5 kb long was also identified. The PDHB gene encodes a precursor protein that has 359 amino acid residues and a final mature protein that has 329 amino acids, and is part of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex. Two of the mature PDHB proteins come together with two PDHA proteins to form a heterotetrameric E1 subunit. Crystal Structures allowed for a model in which the enzyme undergoes a 2-A shuttle- like motion of its heterodimers to perform the catalysis. Specifically, the catalytic residue has been identified on the PDHB subunit, the 89th residue, which is a glutamate. In forming the entire PDH complex, the 289th beta residue, aspartic acid, interacts with the 276th residue of the E2 complex, a lysine. The entire human complex is 9.5 MDa in size, and has been described as 60-meric, meaning there are over 60 components that are assembled to make the entire complex. These subunits are conserved across many species, as the function of this complex is essential for the generation of ATP for all eukaryotes. Each component is responsible for the catalysis of one step in this pathway; this complex exists for the purpose of channeling the intermediates of each reaction to the next enzyme, thus greatly increasing the rate of reaction.  Function  The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is responsible for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, with the final product being Acetyl CoA. Overall the complex catalyzes five reactions, with the overall reaction being: Pyruvate + CoA + NAD+ ‚Üí acetyl-CoA + CO2 There are three different coenzymes required throughout the 5 steps that this complex carries out: thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), lipoamide, and coenzyme A. This step is only one of the central metabolic pathway carried out by eukaryotes, in which glucose is oxidized to form carbon dioxide, water, and ATP. The E1 complex specifically uses the TPP cofactor to cleave the Calpha-C(=O) bond of pyruvate, and then transfer the acetyl group to the TPP coenzyme, thus resulting in an intermediate, hydroxylethyl-Tpp*E1, and producing CO2. The thiazolium ring on the TPP is ideal for adding to carbonyl groups and acting as an electron sink, or a group that can pull electrons from a reaction and stabilize an electron-deficient intermediate. Additionally, PDHB interacts with Prolyl-hydroxylase PHD3 to regulate the cellular PDH activity.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the PDHB gene have been known to cause one form of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is characterized by the buildup of a chemical called lactic acid in the body and a variety of neurological problems. Signs and symptoms of this condition usually first appear shortly after birth, and they can vary widely among affected individuals. The most common feature is a potentially life- threatening buildup of lactic acid (lactic acidosis), which can cause nausea, vomiting, severe breathing problems, and an abnormal heartbeat. People with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency usually have neurological problems as well. Most have delayed development of mental abilities and motor skills such as sitting and walking. Other neurological problems can include intellectual disability, seizures, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), poor coordination, and difficulty walking. Some affected individuals have abnormal brain structures, such as underdevelopment of the tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (corpus callosum), wasting away (atrophy) of the exterior part of the brain known as the cerebral cortex, or patches of damaged tissue (lesions) on some parts of the brain. Because of the severe health effects, many individuals with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency do not survive past childhood, although some may live into adolescence or adulthood. Most cases of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) deficiency are attributable to mutations in the PDHA1 gene which encodes the E(1)Œ± subunit, with few cases of mutations in the genes for E3, E3BP, and E2 being described. However, there are a few cases in which mutations in the beta subunit gene have resulted in patients with Leigh syndrome. Many pathological mutations have been described, including: R36C, which results in conformational change due to increased amino acid interactions; C306R, overall affecting interaction of the two beta subunits; I142M, affecting conformation around a potassium ion, thereby reducing PDHB stability; W165S, which also affects hydrophobic interaction between the beta subunits; and Y132C. Other cases have been described in which there are no pathological mutations, but inborn errors of metabolism, specifically related to ubiquitination and proteasome machineries, resulted in a PDHB deficiency. This was demonstrated by PDH activity being restored in cells that were treated with MG132, which is known as proteasome inhibitor. The clinical manifestations of this deficiency are similar to those of PDHA1 deficiency, with the exception being that ataxia is less frequent in these cases, and that consanguinity was found only in families with the PDHB deficiency.

History During the late 17th century, the area was a staging ground for raids between English and French colonies. Whitehall was first called \\"Skenesborough\\" in 1759 when it was settled by a land grant to a British officer, Philip Skene (1725-after 1785), who later returned to England, and who was subsequently declared an enemy of the State of New York for his land dealings. During the French and Indian War, the town was one of two major routes connecting the English and French Colonies. During the American Revolution, the village, Skenesborough, was captured by American forces in 1774. Benedict Arnold under Philip Schuyler built a fleet of vessels to confront British forces at Valcour Island (thus the claim that this is the birthplace of the U.S. Navy). The surviving American vessels returned here to be destroyed in order to keep them from falling into enemy hands. The next year John Burgoyne led his forces through this area en route to the Battle of Saratoga. After the war, the town's name was changed to Whitehall. During the War of 1812 the area was used to build ships to battle British forces on Lake Champlain, culminating at the Battle of Plattsburgh. In 1823, the Champlain Canal was completed to Whitehall. The Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad was extended to Whitehall in 1848. During the second half of the 19th Century, the silk industry grew important in the town. Due to the actions in 1775-76, the legislature of the State of New York in 1960 declared Whitehall to be the birthplace of the United States Navy.Chamber of Commerce, Whitehall, New York, whitehall-chamber.org; accessed April 11, 2017. =See also= *Saratoga Campaign, War of 1812 Geography The South Bay of Lake Champlain near Whitehall According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 58.8 square miles (152.2 km2), of which, 57.6 square miles (149.2 km2) of it is land and 1.1 square miles (3.0 km2) of it (1.94%) is water.

The highlight of the season was winning the European Championship at Northampton using a new Frankie Wainman Junior-built tarmac car for the first time. The 2001 season started badly at Coventry when the engine was damaged. After seven second places and four third places, it was not until 12 August at Skegness Stadium that he won his first meeting final. Nevertheless, consistent results kept him in the top three of the National Points. He also successfully defended the European Championship in July, and won the World Championship in September. 2002 saw Rob debut a new space-frame tarmac car. He won the meeting final first time out at Barford, but it was to be the only time that the car won a meeting final. By June, Rob had reverted to his previous car. 2002 was to be the first year he didn't win a major BriSCA F1 title, although he did come close with second place in both the British Championship and World Championship. He also suffered a puncture while in the lead in the European Championship. Rob took the decision to leave BriSCA F1 at the end of the season after disagreements with another driver. In January 2000, Rob was voted 47th in a Motoring News poll to find the world's top 100 racing drivers. He beat names such as Nelson Piquet, Jacques Villeneuve, David Coulthard and Mika H√§kkinen. Coverage of the results were included in The Sun newspaper. 2009 saw a much-anticipated return to BriSCA F2 Stock Cars. Rob was asked by Terry George to race a new Elite model stock car as a test bed for future cars. He raced in seven meetings, including a meeting final win at Buxton. This got him into the World Championship Semi-Final, in which he finished second behind Gordon Moodie. He was disqualified from the World Final for using outside assistance in the form of another car on the centre green to straighten a bent nerf rail. Rob qualified on the front row for the 2011 World Final at King's Lynn, but failed to complete the first lap after being shoved into the fence on the first corner after a heavy rain shower on the parade lap had turned the shale track very slick. He also competed in the World Finals in 2012 at Barford, 2013 at Taunton (where he started from pole position) and 2014 at Cowdenbeath, all of which he failed to finish and were dominated by his battles with Moodie, particularly 2013 which saw the pair clash spectacularly in a battle for the lead and resulted in Speak's tarmac chassis being written off in the crash. Then a year later, the duo had a run-in again, where Rob appeared to \\"brake test\\" Moodie on starting the second lap as he came to pass him, and this held both up. The pair did not meet on track until 11 months later when they both qualified in the same World Championship Semi Final at Skegness. They clashed again, and Speak took himself out of the race, and the 2015 World Championship in his efforts to stop Moodie. Speak won the 2013 British Championship at King's Lynn, after qualifying on the fifth row. 2012 saw a second return to competition, this time to BriSCA F1 Stock Cars. Initially a one-off to race for charity, Speak did enough to qualify for that year's World Championship. The following year saw him primarily a single- surface competitor on tarmac, in 2014 Speak raced both surfaces and won the National Points Championship.Reeves 2015, p.128. In 2015, he won the World Championship a second time, becoming the driver with the longest gap between World Final wins.  ASCAR career  During the 2001 season, Rob debuted in the new ASCAR series racing at Rockingham Motor Speedway with 2 races for the Colin Blower team, in the second race he finished in 4th place a season's best result for the team. At the beginning of the 2002 season, Rob was given a full-time drive with the Colin Blower ASCAR team, it turned out to be a frustrating year with no podiums. 5th place in Round 2 was to be his highest finish. He finished the season in 9th place. In 2003 Rob decided to leave the world of F1 Stockcars and fully concentrated on his ASCAR racing. It was to be a frustrating year with many races being dogged with car trouble. But in a rain shortened 40 lap 3rd round of the Championship Rob produced his best race result winning his first race. It showed what could be done when the car was right. Starting on the 3rd row he took the lead on lap 16 to the flag. Results: RD 1 8th - RD 2 8th - RD 3 1st - RD 4 4th -RD 5 14th - RD 6 DNF - RD 7 18th - RD 8 DNF - RD 9 11th - RD 10 DNF - RD 11 DNA - RD 12 6th - RD 13 3rd. The 2004 Days of Thunder Season was to be the final season he took part in the ASCAR racing with team mate Ben Collins  Other racing  In 2002, Rob raced in a National Hot Rod, driving Dick Hillard's spare Peugeot 205, finishing tenth and eleventh in heats but not completing the final due to a 15-car pile up. Rob continues to occasionally race bangers. One of his typical best nights was the Belle Vue Charity Banger meeting. Rob went to enjoy himself and did just that winning the charity final and the Demolition Derby. This led to a drive in the Banger World Final at Wimbledon. He started well from his 16th position on the 40 car grid. Driving a Granada under the GMP banner and was soon up into the top half dozen but progress was stopped when the engine packed up and that was the end of his night. Next stop Ipswich where he won a heat & started from the back of a 70 car final, he led with a quarter of a lap to go when he was T-boned by a rival from the centre green. He still managed to finish second. Then to Birmingham on cold wet night he came 3rd in the final. He is not to be confused with the driver of the same name who competed in a couple of British Touring Car Championship endurance races in the late 1980s.

The name literally translates as horse racing field from Azerbaijani referring to the tradition of holding horse racing games in the times of the Karabakh Khanate.  Location  The western part of Shusha rises 1,800 meters and the eastern part 1,400 meters above sea level. The Jidir Plain is located in the southern relatively flat yet higher part of Shusha. This meadow overlooks the valley and the Dashalty gorge through which the Dashalty river flows 200 meters below. A trail on the edge of the Jidir Plain leads to Girkh Pillakan (40 steps), a forty step path which in turn leads down to the Dashalty gorge and Khazina Galasy (\\"Treasure Castle\\") cave by the river.  Significance  The Jidir Plain has always been the main location for festivities and sporting events in Shusha. From the time of Shusha's establishment, wrestling matches were part of periodic competitions held by the Karabakh Khans. Both horse racing and camel racing matches were held here. Chovgan (Azerbaijani variation of polo) was also played here. Participants of the games also excelled in jigitovka, a type of horse riding stunt games. Ibrahim Khalil Khan who was fond of Karabakh horses, held official semi-annual horse racing games in the khanate while the regular races took place on a weekly basis. Youths received many awards for exceptional horse riding stunts. One of the variations of the Jidir Plain jigitovka was baharbandi where the participant had to throw off his papakh, rifle, dagger, shashka at assigned spots at full speed and then collect them on his way back with the same speed. The Jidir Plain was also a place for Novruz celebrations as well as official welcoming ceremonies for international guests. The festivities included tightrope walking, stilts and jester performances accompanied by music. The field was often compared to a hippodrome.

The population was 3,619 at the 2010 census. It is located in the southern half of the town of Lyons. The hamlet and the town are named after Lyon (sometimes spelled Lyons), France. Originally named \\"The Forks,\\" Lyons was renamed by land agent George Williamson. Lyons is the county seat of Wayne County. It was an incorporated village from 1854 through 2015. The hamlet is east of the city of Rochester. Government offices for the Town of Lyons are located in the hamlet.Lyons, NY (The Town), Retrieved Jan. 1, 2016.  History  The community was settled around 1789 and incorporated as a village in 1854. The Erie Canal, which once went through the center of the village, was rerouted to the south when it was enlarged in the 1850s. Later, the canal conformed roughly to the bed of the Clyde River. On November 6, 2012, Lyons village residents passed a proposal to dissolve the village into the surrounding town by a 569‚Äì524 margin. The H. G. Hotchkiss Essential Oil Company Plant, Grace Episcopal Church Complex, Broad Street-Water Street Historic District, and U.S. Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1986, parts of two films were shot in Lyons. The Spanish film Slugs filmed in Lyons for its quaint American look and Lady in White, to take advantage of the historic, preserved atmosphere.

Lyons celebrates Peppermint Days in mid-July to memorialize the region's past fame in producing this crop. = Dissolution = In 2012, a coalition of bipartisan taxpayers formed OneLyons, a group seeking to dissolve the village. They circulated a petition to force a dissolution vote after the village did not follow up on a 2010 Center for Governmental Research Study showing that significant tax savings were possible and further efficiencies could be achieved. In November 2012, the village voted to dissolve, beginning a process under the 2009 NYS Government Reorganization and Citizen Empowerment Act pushed by Governor Cuomo and Championed by Senators Nozzolio and Robach as well as local Assemblyman Bob Oaks of North Rose. In 2013, the Village of Lyons formed a dissolution committee and chose a consultant. Per NYS Law, the Village of Lyons had until June 25, 2013 to prepare and approve a dissolution plan, and until July 2 to present it to the village residents. On June 28, 2013 the OneLyons group filed a petition in New York State Supreme Court requesting the court declare the village in violation of GML 17-A. Acting Supreme Court Judge Nesbitt held two hearings, and ordered the Village of Lyons to complete a dissolution plan by October 20, 2013. OneLyons appealed Judge Nesbitt's decision granting additional time to the village citing the New York State Law and asserting that the judge did not have a legal basis to grant time extensions, and that the judge exceeded the discretion he was allowed by law. The Village of Lyons responded to the appeal by asking the NYS Supreme Court Appellate Division, 4th Judicial Department out of Rochester NY to dismiss the Appeal as Moot. On December 6, 2013; five judges of the Appellate Division decided the case had enough grounds and merit to move forward, ordered the Village of Lyons to reply, but reserved the right to still dismiss the case as moot. In 2014 the Appellate Court 4th Department in Rochester dismissed the lawsuit noting that since the Village of Lyons had ultimately complied, then further challenge was not allowed regardless of the evidence. 'Save the Village of Lyons', an anti- dissolution group, organized and led by Police Chief Richard Bogan and Police Clerk Helen Weimer to force a second referendum on dissolution, succeeded with enough votes. However, the OneLyons pro-dissolution group initiated a second lawsuit under Article 78 proceedings challenging the validity of the Village Certification process and claiming gross irregularities, fraud, intimidation, and multiple conflicts of interest. The OneLyons group was presented extensive evidence in support of its positions that can be reviewed on their website at www.onelyons.com. Ultimately, Judge Nesbitt deferred his discretion to the Clerk of the Village who had personally signed and been involved in the anti- dissolution movement, ruling that since she used the proper criteria then there was no further reason to doubt the validity of her decisions. Further, Judge Nesbitt ruled that since none of the citizens appeared before the court willing to testify regarding fraud, intimidation, and conflicts of interest, then there was insufficient reason for the court to intervene. A second vote on dissolution occurred in March 2014 resulted in a YES vote of 519-353. The Village of Lyons officially dissolved on December 31, 2015. http://www.fltimes.com/news/article_3a894bde-9c3b-11e3-aef3-001a4bcf887a.htmlhttp://www.fltimes.com/news/article_3b7325ec-61b2-11e3-8604-0019bb2963f4.htmlhttp://www.onelyons.com/wordpress/http://www.waynetimes.com/community/lyons- votes-474-to-309-to-continue-with- dissolution/http://www.fltimes.com/news/article_619e2978-db7a-11e3-8e11-001a4bcf887a.htmlhttp://www.waynepost.com/article/20140316/News/140319897http://www.villageoflyons.com/thevillage/http://www.lyonsdissolution.org/ All government activities previously managed by the village are now handled by the Town of Lyons.

Six cards have been dealt out and voted on, and the storyteller is indicating which story belonged to them. To the right, scores are tracked by rabbit-shaped tokens on a scoring track. Each player starts the game with six random cards. Players then take turns being the storyteller. The player whose turn it is to be storyteller looks at the six images in his or her hand. From one of these, he or she makes up a sentence or phrase that might describe it and says it out loud (without showing the card to the other players). Each other player then selects from among their own six cards the one that best matches the sentence given by the storyteller. Then, each player gives their selected card to the storyteller, without showing it to the others. The storyteller shuffles his or her chosen card with the cards received from the other players, and all cards are then dealt face up.

Clements (1883‚Äì1966) the firm hit its stride with a series of theaters and commercial projects around MacArthur Park. Clements often worked in Spanish Colonial revival and Mayan revival styles, but their major project was the black Art Deco Richfield Tower, a commanding presence in downtown from its 1928 completion to its 1969 destruction. Walls did not live to see the completion of the building, as he had died in 1922. Clements left the firm in 1937 to start his own practice, Stiles O.

According to the claim, generally associated with fiscal conservatives, although college tuition payments are rising, the supply of college graduates in many fields of study is exceeding the demand for their skills, which aggravates graduate unemployment and underemployment while increasing the burden of student loan defaults on financial institutions and taxpayers. The claim has generally been used to justify cuts to public higher education spending, tax cuts, or a shift of government spending towards the criminal justice system and the Department of Defense. Most economists reject the notion of a higher education bubble, noting that the returns on higher education vastly outweigh the costs.  Discussion  The \\"higher education bubble\\" is controversial and has been rejected by most economists. Data shows that the wage premium, the difference between what those with a four-year college degree earn and what those with only a high school education earn, has increased dramatically since the 1970s, but so has the 'debt load' incurred by students due to the tuition inflation.Michael Simkovic, Risk-Based Student Loans (2012)Thomas Lemieux, Postsecondary Education And Increasing Wage Inequality, 96 AM. ECON. REVIEW 195 (2006)Sandy Baum and Michael McPherson, Job-Skill Trends and the College- Wage Premium, Chronicle of Higher Education, Sept. 21, 2010 Research from the Center for Household Financial Stability, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, presented in 2018, predicts a declining but still positive income premium for completing college but a declining wealth premium, which is almost indistinguishable from zero for the most recent cohort. The data also suggests that, notwithstanding a slight increase in 2008‚Äì09, student loan default rates have declined since the mid-1980s and 1990s. Those with college degrees are much less likely than those without to be unemployed, even though they are more expensive to employ (they earn higher wages).U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Education Pays The management consulting firm McKinsey & Company projects a shortage of college-educated workers and a surplus of workers without college degrees, which would cause the wage premium to increase and cause differences in unemployment rates to become even more dramatic.McKinsey Global Institute, An Economy that Works: Job Creation and America's Future, June 2011 In 1971, Time ran the article \\"Education: Graduates and Jobs: A Grave New World\\" which stated that the supply of PhD students was 30 to 50 percent larger than the expected future demand in upcoming decades. In 1987, U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett suggested that the availability of loans may be fueling an increase in tuition prices and an education bubble. This \\"Bennett hypothesis\\" claims that readily available loans allow schools to increase tuition without regard to demand elasticity. College rankings are partially driven by spending levels, and higher tuition is also correlated with increased public perceptions of . Over the past thirty years, demand has increased as institutions improved facilities and provided more resources to students. A variation on the higher education bubble theory suggests that there is no general bubble in higher education (on average, higher education really does boost income and employment by more than enough to make it a good investment) but that degrees in some specific fields may be overvalued because they do little to boost income or improve job prospects, and degrees in other fields may in fact be undervalued because students do not appreciate the extent to which these degrees could benefit their employment prospects and future income. Proponents of the theory have noted that schools charge equal prices for tuition regardless of what students study, but the interest rate on federal student loans is not adjusted according to risk, and there is evidence that undergraduate students in their first three years of college are not very good at predicting future wages by major. A study from the Labor Department found that a bachelor's degree \\"represents a significant advantage in the job market.\\" In 2011, The Chronicle of Higher Education ran an article saying that the future is bright for college graduates. Glenn Reynolds argued in his book, The Higher Education Bubble, that higher education as a \\"product grows more and more elaborate and more expensive but the expense is offset by cheap credit provided by sellers who are eager to encourage buyers to buy.\\"  Controversy  College Degree Returns by Average 2011 Annual Out-of-Pocket Costs, from B. Caplan's The Case Against Education First-year U.S. college degree returns for select majors, by type of student. Study comparing college revenue per student by tuition and state funding in 2008 dollars\\"Trends in College Spending 1998‚Äì2008 \\" (PDF) Delta Cost Project The view that higher education is a bubble is highly controversial. Most economists do not think that returns to a college education are falling but instead believe that the benefits far outweigh the costs. Yet, the returns for marginal students or students in certain majors, especially at costly private universities, may not justify the investment. It has been suggested that the returns to education should be compared to the returns to other forms of investment such as the stock market, bonds, real estate, and private equity. A higher return would suggest underinvestment in higher education, but lower returns would suggest a bubble. Studies have typically found a causal relationship between growth and education, although the quality and type of education matters, and not just the number of years of schooling. In a financial bubble, assets like houses are sometimes purchased with a view to reselling at a higher price, and this can produce rapidly escalating prices as people speculate on future prices. An end to the spiral can provoke abrupt selling of the assets, resulting in an abrupt collapse in price the bursting of the bubble. Because the asset acquired through college attendance a higher education cannot be sold but only rented through wages, there is no similar mechanism that would cause an abrupt collapse in the value of existing degrees. For this reason, this analogy could be misleading. However, one rebuttal to the claims that a bubble analogy is misleading is the observation that the 'bursting' of the bubble are the negative effects on students who incur student debt, for example, as the American Association of State Colleges and Universities reports that \\"Students are deeper in debt today than ever before.... The trend of heavy debt burdens threatens to limit access to higher education, particularly for low-income and first-generation students, who tend to carry the heaviest debt burden. Federal student aid policy has steadily put resources into student loan programs rather than need-based grants, a trend that straps future generations with high debt burdens. Even students who receive federal grant aid are finding it more difficult to pay for college.\\" However, the data actually show that notwithstanding a slight increase in 2008‚Äì2009, student loan default rates have declined since the mid-1980s and 1990s. During both periods of growth and recession, those with college degrees are much less likely than those without to be unemployed, even though they earn higher wages. Ohio University economist Richard Vedder has written in The Wall Street Journal that: = Alternatives to bubble theory = A different explanation for rising tuition is the reduction of state and federal appropriations to colleges, making them more reliant on student tuition. Thus, it is not a bubble but a form of shifting costs away from state and federal funding over to students.\\"Public Universities Relying More on Tuition Than State Money\\", The New York Times 2011/01/24 This has mostly applied to public universities which in 2011 for the first time have taken in more in tuition than in state funding and had the greatest increases in tuition. Implied from this shift away from public funding to tuition is privatization, although The New York Times reported that such claims are exaggerated. A second theory claims that as a result of federal law that severely restricts the ability of students to discharge their federally guaranteed student loans in bankruptcy, lenders and colleges know that students are on the hook for any amount that they borrow, including late fees and interest (which can be capitalized and increase the principal loan amount), thus removing the incentive to only provide students loans that the students can be reasonably expected to repay. As evidence for this theory, it has been suggested that returning bankruptcy protections (and other standard consumer protections) to student loans would cause lenders to be more cautious, thereby causing a sharp decline in the availability of student loans, which, in turn, would decrease the influx of dollars to colleges and universities, who, in turn, would have to sharply decrease tuition to match the lower availability of funds. Economic and social commentator Gary North has remarked at LewRockwell.com, \\"To speak of college as a bubble is silly. A bubble does not pop until months or years after the funding ceases. There is no indication that the funding for college education will cease.\\" Azar Nafisi, Johns Hopkins University professor and bestselling author of Reading Lolita in Tehran, has stated on the PBS NewsHour that a purely economic analysis of a higher education bubble is incomplete: = Recommendations = Commentators have recommended certain policies to varying degrees of controversy: * State and federal governments should increase appropriations, grants, and contracts to colleges and universities. * Federal, state, and local governments should reduce the regulatory burden on colleges and universities. * Minimize the risk of investment in higher education through loan forgiveness or insurance programs. The federal government should enact partial or total loan forgiveness for student loans. * Colleges and universities should look for ways to reduce costs without reducing quality. * Federal lawmakers should return standard consumer protections (truth in lending, bankruptcy proceedings, statutes of limitations, etc.) to student loans which were removed by the passage of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-394, enacted October 22, 1994), which amended the FFELP (Federal Family Education Loan Program).

Selman Reis was an Ottoman admiral and former corsair who was active in the Mamluk Navy of Egypt and later in the Ottoman Navy against the Portuguese in the first half of the 16th century. Selman Reis was originally from the Aegean island of Lesbos.[ The Ottoman Age of Exploration Giancarlo Casale p.39] Mercenary for the Mamluk regime Selman Reis entered the service of the Mamluks, and led a group of 2,000 armed Levantines, possibly against the own wishes of the Ottoman Sultan Selim I.[ The Ottoman Age of Exploration Giancarlo Casale p.32] Following the disruption of the spice trade between India and Mamluk Egypt by the Portuguese, Selman Reis led a Mamluk fleet of 19 ships into the Indian Ocean in 1515. He left Suez leading the fleet on 30 September 1515.[ An Economic and Social History of the Ottoman Empire, Volume 1\\" by Halil ƒ∞nalcik p.321ff] The fleet also included 3,000 men, 1,300 of whom were Turkish soldiers. The fleet built a fortress in Kamaran, but failed to take Yemen and Aden on 17 September 1516. Selman Reis defended Jiddah against a Portuguese attack in 1517. In 1517, he defended Jeddah against a Portuguese attack, soon before the fall of the Mamluk regime. Selman Reis was sent to Istanbul and imprisoned for disloyalty until 1520. Ottoman admiral Selman Reis came back in favour with the arrival of Ibrahim Pasha in Egypt in 1524. He was able to make a detailed report of the situation of the Indian Ocean at the time, suggesting the occupation of Ethiopia, Yemen and the Swahili Coast, and the eviction of the Portuguese from Hormuz, Goa and Malacca. In 1525, the Portuguese raided the Red Sea, further bringing the threat of their fleet closer to Egypt. Giancarlo Casale In 1525, Selman Reis was put at the head of an Ottoman fleet of 18 ships and 299 cannons as its admiral, with ships taken from the derelict Jiddah fleet and refurbished in Suez. He was in association with Hayreddin al-Rumi, leading around 4,000 infantry. They left Suez in 1526, and first returned Jiddah back to order. Landing in Mocha in January 1527, they led an expedition into the interior of Yemen to subdue the area, which they succeeding in doing after beheading Mustafa Beg. Aden remained independent but recognized suzerainty to Ottoman rule. The fleet then left to establish a naval base in Kamaran. This allowed the Ottomans to retake control of the Red Sea, and for the first time the Portuguese could not send a fleet in the Red Sea in 1527. Following these success, various potentates in the Indian Ocean asked for Ottoman help against the Portuguese: in 1527 the Vizier of Hormuz as well as the Zamorin of Calicut. By 1528, Ottoman mercenaries were present on Islamic shipping as far as Sumatra. After that time however, Selman Reis fell into a dispute with Hayreddin al-Rumi, which greatly weakened these efforts. Selman Reis was later involved in defending Muslim possessions in India against the Portuguese and their Hindu allies. He installed Pro-Ottoman forces under Captain Hoca Sefer in Diu, until the failed Ottoman attempt to expel the Portuguese in the 1538 Siege of Diu.

Early life  Born Marcelle Jeanine Saunier in Nancy, France, she moved with her family in 1940 to the Free Zone in Annecy. After high school, she turned to the theater, performing under the name Janine Saulnier. After eight years of studying piano, singing and drama, in 1950 she met L√©o Ferr√© and fell in love with his songs. In 1952 she sang his \\"Paris canaille\\", which became a hit. In 1954, she won the \\"Grand Prix du Disque\\", a famous French reward, for the song \\"L'Homme\\", again by Ferr√©. On tour in Canada, she made the acquaintance of Gilles Vigneault, who wrote \\"Mon Pays, Le Corbeau, la Manikoutai\\" for her.  Professional career  Arriving in Paris, she adopted the surname Sauvage, borrowed from a childhood friend, and, began studying drama: :I did my apprenticeship with Jean-Louis Barrault, with John Vilar, Roger Blin, Marcel Marceau. [...] The chance of life allowed me to be presented to Moyses, who was the director of the cabaret Le Boeuf sur le Toit. I sang him some stuff like that, recited two or three poems. As a result, Moyses hired me the next day. I used a directory with songs including Marianne Oswald. I stayed two months at the Boeuf sur le Toit --- afterwards, I sang at the Quod Libet, a nightclub on 3 rue des Pr√©s-At-Clerics. She also performed at the cabarets L'Arlequin at 131 bis, boulevard Saint-Germain, then at L'√âcluse at 15, Quai des Grands Augustins, in the 6th arrondissement. She met L√©o Ferr√©, whom she helped in bringing recognition to his music: \\"It was the meeting of my life. As a happiness never comes alone, they say, Jacques Canetti came to hear me a beautiful evening. He was always looking for artists for the record company of which he was the artistic director, as well as for [the concert hall] Les Trois Baudets that he had established.\\" Jacques Canetti hired her in 1953 and 1954 to work at Les Trois Baudets. \\"So I visited that cabaret on Rue Coustou for two years. Later I was featured at the Olympia, and received a grand prize for record L'Homme with L√©o Ferr√©.\\" She died in 1998, aged 68, in Bry-sur-Marne, Val-de-Marne.  Performance style  She has always given preference to poetry set to music. L√©o Ferr√© and Gilles Vigneault have said they considered Sauvage their best performer.

Early life and education  Helwani was born to Mizrahi Jewish parents in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Helwani's mother is from Lebanon, and his father is from Egypt. He is the maternal nephew of David Saad, a judoka who competed in the men's lightweight event at the 1976 Summer Olympics,Lazarus, David. \\"Montreal native is a mixed martial arts broadcaster\\", The Canadian Jewish News, January 13, 2011. and Gad Saad, an evolutionary psychologist. Helwani is fluent in English, French, and Hebrew, and understands Spanish and Arabic. Helwani grew up in Mount Royal, Quebec, and Westmount (a Montreal suburb), and attended the Akiva School and Herzliah High School. In 2004, Helwani graduated from Syracuse University's S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications in Syracuse, New York.  Career  Helwani has covered mixed martial arts professionally since 2006. He worked for MMA Fighting before joining ESPN in May 2018. He formerly served as an \\"MMA Insider\\" for Fox Sports 1's weekly UFC Tonight show and other pre- and post-event programming. He is the former co-host of the Sirius XM radio show \\"Fight Club\\", was formerly the host of The MMA Hour podcast and the MMA Beat show on YouTube. He's interim vice president of the highly controversial Mixed Martial Arts Journalists Association. At ESPN he hosts a show called \\"Ariel & The Bad Guy\\" with Chael Sonnen, continues his podcast, and reports on MMA for all ESPN platforms. = UFC 199 controversy / UFC lifetime ban = On June 4, 2016, Helwani and two colleagues were escorted out of UFC 199 before the main event. He said their press credentials were taken and they were banned for life from all UFC events. He earlier reported the return of Brock Lesnar at UFC 200, hours before UFC announced it on the broadcast, without notifying UFC first. UFC spokesman Dave Sholler said such reporting was against standard practice. According to UFC commentator Joe Rogan, Helwani was asked to not report this news, as management suspected a mole had leaked it to him and, without knowing who it was, would then have to fire all possible moles. Through Twitter, Helwani called Rogan's story \\"100% inaccurate.\\" UFC president Dana White was displeased. He announced that the ban will last \\"As long as I'm here.\\" Later, he reputedly added \\"He can cover all the events he wants, he just can't have a credential\\". On the June 6 episode of The MMA Hour, Helwani detailed the incident in an emotional broadcast. He said he was brought to see Dana White, who told him he was banned for being \\"too negative\\". He later learned this call was made by Lorenzo Fertitta. He stood by his decision to report the news in a timely manner, and said he would continue to work as an MMA journalist. Many high profile UFC fighters sympathised with Helwani. Light-heavyweight champion Jon Jones wrote on Twitter \\"That's unfortunate.\\" Helwani's close friend Daniel Cormier expressed similar sentiment. Former Middleweight champion Chris Weidman said on Twitter \\"This sport needs the GOAT [slang for Greatest Of All Time] of MMA reporting\\". Later on June 6, UFC rescinded the ban, stating: \\"\\"Following a conversation with the editorial team at SB Nation, UFC will not prevent MMAFighting.com from receiving media credentials to cover live UFC events. We respect the role the media plays in our sport and beyond, including MMAFighting's ability to report news. However, in our opinion, we believe the recurring tactics used by its lead reporter extended beyond the purpose of journalism. We feel confident our position has now been adequately communicated to the SB Nation editorial team. =Mayweather vs. McGregor ban= Helwani claimed that he was removed from the Showtime broadcast team for the Mayweather vs. McGregor press tour, hours before the first press conference in Los Angeles. \\"Not working for @SHOsports anymore on the May/Mac tour,\\" wrote Helwani on Twitter, \\"UFC specifically asked to have me removed. Incredibly disappointed.\\" = ESPN = Helwani left MMA Fighting and is now working for ESPN, the UFC's official broadcast partner, where he hosts Ariel Helwani‚Äôs MMA Show on Twitter and YouTube, \\"Ariel and the Bad Guy\\" on ESPN + and a Wednesday podcast. He also contributes to occasional ESPN broadcasts of the NBA.

Life Born in Florida, he was the son of David Yeats, a physician who was the Secretary of the East Florida Colony in Florida. He matriculated from Hertford College, Oxford, on 21 January 1790, graduating B.A. on 15 October 1793, M.A. on 25 May 1796, M.B. on 4 May 1797. He was incorporated M.B. at Dublin in 1807, and graduated M.D. from Trinity College, Oxford, on 7 June 1814. He spent two winter sessions in Edinburgh and one in London, and then practised at Bedford, where he assisted in the establishment of the Bedford general infirmary, and at a later period of the lunatic asylum near the town. He was nominated physician to each of these institutions. While at Bedford he acquired the friendship of Samuel Whitbread and of John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford. On the Duke of Bedford's nomination to the lord- lieutenancy of Ireland, Yeats accompanied him to Dublin in March 1806 as his private physician. While at Dublin he was instrumental in establishing the Dublin Humane Society, and was made a member of Trinity College, Dublin. On the duke's return to England in 1807 he resumed his position at Bedford, where he later served as mayor. About 1814 he moved to London, where he was admitted a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1814, and a fellow on 30 September 1815. He was Gulstonian lecturer in 1817, censor in 1818, and Croonian lecturer around 1826 (speaking against the stethoscope). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 1 July 1819, and died at Tunbridge Wells on 14 November 1836. He married a daughter of Patrick Colquhoun. Works Yeats's major work, Observations on the Claims of the Moderns to some Discoveries in Chemistry and Physiology (London), was published in 1798, after he had settled at Bedford. In it he called attention to the experiments of John Mayow, whose merits Thomas Beddoes had discovered two years before. It was uncritical but helped rescue his achievements from oblivion. Yeats was the author of: * 'An Address on the Nature and Efficacy of the Cowpox in preventing the Smallpox,' London, 1803 * 'A Statement of the Early Symptoms which lead to Water on the Brain, London, 1815; 2nd edit., London, 1833. * 'A Biographical Sketch of the Life and Writings of Patrick Colquhoun,' London, 1815.

It's found in sea side rainforest as well as the drier inland rainforests. From as far south as the Richmond River, New South Wales to Coen in tropical Queensland, and as far west as Melville Island, Northern Territory. Naming and taxonomy The blush condoo has undergone several scientific name changes. Some taxonomists consider it to belong in the wastebasket genus Pouteria, others prefer the genus Planchonella (the latter genus is often sunk into the former). Other scientific names of this plant include Sersalisia laurifolia, Beccariella queenslandica, Pouteria queenslandica, and Sideroxylon richardii. Until fairly recently it was known as Planchonella laurifolia, now recognised as an invalid name. Description The blush condoo is an impressive rainforest tree up to 40 metres (130 ft) tall, with a stem diameter of 90 cm (36 in). The crown of the tree is bright green, with leaves crowded towards the end of the branches. The bark is fairly smooth on younger trees, but becomes scaly and rougher on larger trees. Small rows of vertical lenticels may appear on the trunks of younger trees. Older bark tends to fall off in irregular scales. Small branches are fairly thick and smooth, with a fawny down on the new leaf buds. When cut, a white milky sap may be seen. Leaves are alternately arranged on the stem, without serrated edges. They are oval elliptic or oblong elliptic in shape, 9 to 20 cm (3.6‚Äì8 in) long, and 3 to 6 cm (1.2-2.4 in) wide. Shiny green above, more yellow-green underneath, the leaves are somewhat leathery to touch. The leaf stalk is between 8 and 25 mm long. Leaf veins not easily seen on the top surface, but more clear underneath. Six to sixteen lateral veins appear from the mid-rib. =Flowers and fruit= The caramel scented flowers appear in clusters in the leaf axils from the months of May to November. The hairy green or cream flowers are about 6 mm long with five petals. The fruit is a black berry, 2 cm long. Inside the flesh is one or two brown shining seeds. Narrow and oval, around 12 mm long. The seed has a scar on the side, over half the length of the seed. The fruit ripens from August to December. It's eaten by various rainforest inhabitants, including the topknot pigeon and the wompoo fruit-dove. Fresh seed is advised for regeneration.

Origins The Koyandinsk Fair opened in 1848 when merchant Barnabas Botov first began buying cattle on the banks of the Taldy River near to Karkaraly. The following year, new buyers arrived and soon people from Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, Central Asia and western China were visiting the fair. Because of the nomadic nature of the people‚Äôs lives, they waited until summer to sell their livestock and purchase necessary goods. It has been reported that a two-year-old ram was worth 2 silver rubles. The prosperous years In 1869, the Karkaraly regional administration filed an application to officially recognize the trade fair. By 1900 the Koyandinsk Fair had 30 stores, 276 shops and 707 yurts in the area of . The fair was organized in four long rows. In the two central rows were Russian and Siberian merchants trading iron and copper goods, textiles and tea. In the other two rows were merchants from Kazakhstan, Central Asia and China. They traded silks, oriental sweets, carpets, drinks, bread, leather, grains, textiles, and much more. However, the main product of the fair was livestock. Every year over 200,000 horses, cows, sheep and goats were sold. For the years of its operation, the Koyandinsk Fair was the largest of its kind in the steppe region. By 1913, the turnover at the fair approached five million rubles. Anything could be found at the fair: English clothes, Belgian lace, Paris perfumes, and more. One merchant raised so much money that upon his death, his children made a headstone of black marble for him, something that was unprecedented in this area of the world. In the years of revolution and civil war, the fair stopped. But it was revived again in 1923. By then, the fair had grown dramatically. There was a newspaper, library, playground, and a health center. Radios were present and for the first time, people were able to listen to broadcasts from Moscow. A ‚Äúbureaucratic corner‚Äù was created, where a post-office, bank and courthouse were all built. The fair was a celebration for all. Wrestlers, circus performers, magicians, orators were all common. Visiting Akyns, singers and dombra players included Maira Ualukyzy, Kalybek Kuanyshpaev and paluan Hadzhi Mukana. Land disputes and claims cases were settled at the fair. Many famous people of the day visited the fair. Abai Kunanbaev (the father of Kazakh literature) and Baluan Sholak (composer and famous wrestler) are known to have visited the fair. At the age of 49, Sholak accepted a fight from a well-known fighter named Carona, at the Koyandinsk Fair and during the fight broke several ribs. Closure Kazakh society was changing though and people were less nomadic than in previous years. Largely due to this, the fair was closed in 1930. Today, all that is left are a few dilapidated buildings, warehouses, shops and a chapel. For 80 years the fair played a major role in the development of the region as a center of business and entertainment.

Cheriapally meaning ‚Äòsmall church‚Äô, whose appearance contradicts its name, is one of the oldest and well-preserved churches in the state. Cheriapally is located on the way to Kumarakom from Kottayam. The church is dedicated to mother Mary. It is that architecture, which is as old as 440 years and has retained its old world charm today as well even after so much of environmental changes. The length and breadth of the church is constructed with innovative paintings, mural, and architecture.  History  Many stories and legends regarding the establishment and evolution of Christianity in Central Travancore surrounds this church. The legend is that the Thekkumkore (old Kottayam) kings were glad that Christians were living in their kingdom, as they were committed towards working hard to earn a living, and thus had taken the entire responsibility of their security. King Kothavarma, who was ruling the kingdom during that period, provided them land for constructing the church, without levying tax. A church was first built in 1550 and named Valiyapally. However, the congregation later split on ethnic lines and the dissidents built Cheriapally in 1579. It is said that two worship places were not permitted in a single village and thus the king had to divide the village into two so that both the churches could exist. The church was built by Portuguese architect Antony and his team along with the craftsmen of the Thekkumkore Kingdom (old Kottayam) in 1579. However, the Portuguese had no influence on the mode of worship in the church. It is typically dedicated to Syrian Christians. While visiting Cheriapally, one may feel that the architecture greatly resembles that of some temples in Kerala. However, the fact is that during those days, the mode of building every place of worship was the same, irrespective of it being a temple or a church. Kottayam's iconic Cheriapally Mahaedavaka is an architectural marvel and a repository of legends.  Holy Girdle of St. Mary  Kottayam Cheriapally has the unique distinction of being the first church in India to get the Relics of St. Mary (a small part of the Holy girdle of St. Mary) installed at the church. This relic is also known as the Soonoro or Holy belt of St. Mary. The Holy girdle was presented by Ignatius Yacub III, the Patriarch of Antioch to Baselios Augen I, the then Catholicos & Malankara Metropolitan who ceremoniously installed it at Kottayam Cheriapally on 16 January 1966. The holy girdle is kept in the church and is taken out for public viewing from 10th August to 15th August every year during the 15 days fast to commemorate the translation of St. Mary.  Kottayam Cheriapally - A treasure trove of mural art  Built in the Portuguese-Baroque-Keralite style, the church is a treasure trove of mural art. The extravagant collection of mural paintings at the altar of Cheriapally has been termed as a major breakthrough in the history of mural paintings throughout the world. The striking mural art on the church interiors depicts the major incidents in Jesus Christ's life. The eastern side of the church wall portrays the major happenings in the life of the Lord's mother. Some of the paintings depict the trial of Christ, Crucifixion, and Christ being taken down from the cross. The ceiling with 99 tiles is adorned with various paintings. Historians said that these were painted by foreign artists. Interestingly, the clothes worn by the people in the paintings are also European in style. Thought the paintings are in European style, some experts claim the technique used is that of artists from Kerala. All the paintings have been created by only using organic dyes from vegetables and flowers. The red colour seen in the paintings are drawn using Red brick. People from different countries visit the church to study these paintings. Several of the wall paintings had faded with the passage of time. The centuries-old mural paintings have been restored to their former glory by mural painting artist V.M. Jiju Lal and team after a hard work for three months. The rare paintings, which are believed to be more than 300 years old, at the holy sanctuary (madhaba) of the church were brought back without losing on their aesthetic quality. The consecration of the holy sanctuary (madhaba) after mural painting restoration was done on January 11, 2020.  Architecture  The church exhibits a blend of Kerala and Portuguese styles of architecture. Its European architectural style galleries, large granite pillars, cornices and pediments make it an attractive building. The roof of the portico is supported by ten granite pillars and has a large lotus carved out of single piece of granite. Even the baptism basin inside the church has been chiseled from a single stone. The walls around the church are over one meter thick and are strongly influenced by Hindu temple architecture. The niches in the walls accommodate hundreds of oil lamps. With its unique features and the exciting tales surrounding it, Kottayam Cheriapally is a must-visit for those inclined towards traditional buildings and architecture. Punnathra Mar Dionysius The Malankara Metropolitan of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church Punnathra Dionysius III died on 17 May 1825 and was interred at Kottayam Cheriapally (St. Mary's Orthodox Church). The memorial feast of Mar Dionysius III is observed on 19 May.  Church feast  The Dormition of Mother Mary or holy Theotokos occupies the most important place in the Orthodox Church next to that of Jesus Christ. It is indeed a great feast which depicts ‚Äòfalling asleep‚Äô of the Mother of God and taking her body up into heaven by angels. The Feast of the Dormition of St. Mary (Vaangippu Perunnal or Shoonoyo Perunnal) is observed in this church on August 15. The feast of Dormition is celebrated by two weeks of fasting, known as the Dormition fast, beginning from 1st of August to the 15th of August which draws many people from far and wide. The annual feast of the church (Feast of St. Mary) falls on January 15 and is known as Vithukalude Perunnal which means ‚Äòthe festival of seeds‚Äô. It is observed to invoke the blessings of Virgin Mary upon the agricultural seeds.  Modes of access  One can access Kottayam Cheriapally by many means: * By road: via Kottayam approximately 3 kilometres. via Kumarakom approximately 12 kilometres. Buses and taxis are easily available at all times of the day * By rail: via Kottayam approximately 3 kilometres. * By air: via Cochin International Airport approximately 91 kilometres.

The club currently competes in the National Premier Leagues Victoria, having reached the top tier of Victorian football in 2015. History =Early years= Avondale FC was founded in 1984 as Keilor I.C.K.A.. ICKA stood for Italian Community of Keilor Assoc Inc. (I.C.K.A. Club), the football team having been founded originally by Italian immigrants. Keilor ICKA competed in the Victorian Amateur League Division 3 in 1986, but achieved two consecutive promotions in '86 and '87 to rise to the Amateur League Division 1 by '88. Keilor competed in the Provisional Leagues for the first time in 1991, with the federation placing the club into Victorian Provisional League Division 4 that year, the ninth tier of football in Victoria. The club was promoted the following year, a third-place finish enough to see the club rise to Provisional League Division 3. Keilor was to spend the next eight years at that level. After moving to Doyle Street Reserve in Avondale Heights in 1999, the club was renamed to Avondale Heights SC in 2000. That year proved to be a memorable one for the Melbourne club, finally achieving promotion to Provisional League Division 2 North-West, by taking out the Division 3 North-West title, losing just one game all season. The next year was even better, with the club taking out the Div 2 Nth-West title in their first season at that level, finishing five points clear at the top of the table ahead of Mill Park. Avondale Heights' next promotion was to come in 2006, when the club finished second in the Provisional League Division 1 North-West. This promotion meant that the club would compete in the Victorian State Leagues for the first time, entering State League Division 3 North-West for the 2007 season. Devastatingly, the club were relegated on the final game of the 2007 season, finishing just one point of survival. The club endured another relegation the following season, falling to the sixth tier of Victorian football for the 2008 season. =League ascension= A famous climb through the league divisions began in 2009 when a new committee took over the management of the club. Avondale managed a second- place finish in the Provisional League Division 2 North-West, enough for promotion. Avondale was promoted once more the following season, the club again finishing second, this time in the Provisional League Division 1 North- West. In 2012, Avondale Heights appointed Anthony Barbieri as head manager of the senior side. They were promoted from State League 3 North-West to State League 2 North-West after topping their league table and taking out the Championship, pipping Sydenham Park SC by just one point. In 2013, the club were promoted from State League 2 in their first season in the competition, then from the third division of football in Victoria, after winning a playoff against North Geelong Warriors 1‚Äì0. =National Premier Leagues Victoria= In 2014, Avondale Heights entered the second tier of football in Victoria, the National Premier Leagues Victoria 2, for the first time ever. Avondale went on to win the league championship and earn promotion into the NPL Victoria top division. The club achieved five promotions in six seasons to reach the top flight, a feat that is unrivaled in Victorian football. Avondale Heights Soccer Club changed its name to Avondale Football Club in 2015. The club grabbed headlines around Victoria in May 2015 when it confirmed the signings of former A-League players Francesco Stella and Massimo Murdocca. In their first season in the top flight of Victorian football, the club managed to avoid relegation, finishing mid-table. Avondale announced that it had signed two more former A-League players in Spase Dilevski and Jonatan Germano for the 2016 season. Avondale adopted the moniker The Avengers in early 2016 and announced it would be playing home matches for the 2016 season out of Knights Stadium. On the park, it was a difficult season early on for Avondale, who lost its opening five fixtures. A draw against Oakleigh Cannons was followed up by three consecutive victories, but inconsistent form throughout the season, which included another five match losing streak followed by closing out the season eight games undefeated, saw Avondale finish in 8th place for 2016. Jonatan Germano was a clear standout for Avondale, netting 14 goals from midfield including five braces. 2017 witnessed Avondale qualify for the NPL Victoria finals series for the first time, continuing the club's rise. Avondale even led the league by Round 19, but a stretch of four matches without a win saw Heidelberg United and South Melbourne surpass them in the standings. Avondale faced Oakleigh Cannons in the Elimination Final, losing 2‚Äì1 in extra time. Germano was once more the side's top goalscorer, with eight goals. Avondale conceded the fewest goals of any side in the league but also scored fewer goals than all but the two bottom-placed sides, North Geelong Warriors and St Albans Saints.https://int.soccerway.com/national/australia/national-premier- league/2017/victoria/r39027/ The Reggio Calabria Club soccer pitch, re-opened for use by Avondale in June 2018. In December 2017, the club announced that it had signed a 10-year lease with the Reggio Calabria Club in Brunswick to become the new home base for the club. Avondale played its 2018 home games at Paisley Park Soccer Complex prior to the move.http://www.avondalefc.com.au/ In June 2018, Avondale moved into its new home ground in Parkville, Victoria, newly named 'Avenger Park'. Avondale announced that the club would be completing new change-rooms, a kiosk, medical center, gym, members sports bar and a 450-seat grandstand at the venue. Avondale bolstered its offensive unit with the signings of Joseph Katebian, Kaine Sheppard, Stefan Zinni, Elvis Kamsoba and Liam Boland in the off-season. In May 2018, Avondale qualified for the 2018 FFA Cup national stages after a 4‚Äì1 victory over Richmond, the first time in its history it had made the national stages of the Cup. Drawing former National Soccer League side and four-time Australian national champion Marconi Stallions in the Round of 32, Avondale defeated its opponents 4‚Äì1 at ABD Stadium. Avondale progressed to the Quarter Finals when it defeated Devonport Strikers 4-1 and drew current A-League champions Sydney FC. Despite coming back from 2-0 down at half-time, Avondale took the game to extra-time but were eventually defeated 4‚Äì2 in front of 1,566 people, the club's largest ever attendance. In the league, Avondale finished in 3rd place in 2018, its highest position to date. In the finals series, they defeated Port Melbourne 3‚Äì1 at Avenger Park before staging an incredible comeback at Kingston Heath Soccer Complex against Bentleigh Greens, scoring three goals in the last five minutes of extra time, taking the tie from 3‚Äì1 to Bentleigh to 4‚Äì3 to Avondale, securing their first ever NPL grand final appearance. In the Grand Final, Avondale went down 2‚Äì1 to Heidelberg United at AAMI Park. Two of Avondale's stand-out players joined A-League sides after the season, with Sheppard moving to Newcastle Jets and Kamsoba signing for Melbourne Victory. At the conclusion of the season, after seven seasons at the helm of the club, senior head coach Anthony Barbieri departed Avondale. His assistant coach, Zoran Markovski, was named as his successor in December 2018. In his playing days, Markovski was a two-time National Soccer League championship winning defender with Melbourne Croatia. Avondale started the season with 7 consecutive league wins, remained undefeated until Round 13 and led the league for most of the season. Poor form in the latter stages of the season, including a 3‚Äì2 loss to Heidelberg in the second-last round of the regular season saw the Avengers slip to 2nd place. Liam Boland won the league Golden Boot with 22 goals, while Tasuku Sekiya won the Bill Fleming Media Award. In the finals series, Avondale beat Oakleigh 2-0 before going down on penalties to Bentleigh in the Grand Final at AAMI Park. One day prior to the start of the 2020 season, Football Victoria announced that Avondale FC breached conditions of its NPL Licence in 2018 and 2019. Subsequently, the club was fined $25,000, deducted 3 points for the 2020 NPL Victoria season, awarded a suspended $25,000 fine and 18-point deduction for the 2020 season, retrospectively deducted 18 points for the 2018 and 2019 seasons and required to pay back all prize-money awarded in 2018 and 2019.  Women's football  Avondale fielded a senior women's team for the first time in 2019, entering a side in the Victorian Women's State League 4 West competition. Avondale clinched the league title after round 14 after 14 consecutive victories, and ended the season with 16 wins from 16 games, scoring 110 and conceding just 4 goals.

It contains six rooms and is measured at 320 feet long by 120 feet wide. The cave was first documented by Mark Raymond Harrington in a 1930 edition of Scientific American. Up until about 11,000 BC (11,000 radiocarbon years ago), Gypsum Cave was inhabited by the Shasta ground sloth. A few hundreds feet away, the Gypsum Cave Mine contains gypsum, anhydrite and uranium.  History  Human habitation of the cave dates to around 3000 BC. Harrington provided the first documentation of the contents of the cave following excavation in 1930-1931. Habitation occurred at the same time at other local sites like Tule Springs, Lake Mojave and the Pinto Basin. The skull of the ground sloth Nothrotheriops shastensis Sinclair was found in Room 3 by the archaeologist Bertha Parker, who was Harrington's niece and served as expedition secretary. Excavators also found the dung, backbone, claws and reddish-brown hair of the now-extinct ground sloth (these and other bones from the cave are held by the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles CountyElizabeth Glowiak, Gypsum cave revisited; A faunal and taphonomic analysis of a Rancholabrean-to-Holocene fauna in Southern Nevada, Confex.com, 19 March 2008). Through radiocarbon dating, it was found that the sloth remains date back to 11,000 BC and earlier. The dung has given information about what the environment and vegetation of the area was because the sloth was a herbivore. This ancient plant eater survived on capers, mustards, grasses, agave, yucca, phacelia, borages, mints, grape, globemallow, saltbushes and ephedra. Most of these are still found in the area today, but the agave, yucca and grapes are only found at elevations 800 m and more higher, and close to water in the case of grapes. However, during the ice age, the climate was cooler and wetter. The geology of the area shows that the closest likely water supply was between away. In 1994, a sign, the Nevada State Historical Marker #103, was put up to indicate to tourists the way to the site. It was removed by the private owner of the Gypsum Cave, PABCO Mining Company, to avoid unwanted tourism on its grounds.Gypsum Cave - Las Vegas, Nevada - Ancient Aboriginal Dwelling Place, City-data.com In the early 2000s, the Bureau of Land Management launched a survey for the construction of the proposed Harry Allen-Mead 500kV Transmission Line Project.

The area is divided into several subsections which allow guests to view the animals in their natural habitats. Dreamworld Corroboree is a registered zoo with 800 native and barnyard animals located within the Dreamworld grounds. History Koala Country was Dreamworld's original wildlife exhibit, opening in 1987. After major redevelopment, the Australian Wildlife Experience opened in 2001, featuring Koala Country as one of five wildlife zones. During the redevelopment, access to Koala Country was limited. The new development required the reworking of the Dreamworld Railway tracks causing the train to drive a portion of the circuit backwards during construction. The redevelopment cost A$5 million. On 9 July 2012 at Dreamworld, the Australian Minister for Tourism Martin Ferguson announced that the Australian Government would contribute $1.1 million to the redevelopment of the Australian Wildlife Experience into an Indigenous tourist experience. Dreamworld's owners, Ardent Leisure, vowed to match the grant in order to have the $2.2 million redeveloped area open by late 2013. Dreamworld has previously worked with the Indigenous community to develop the Dreamworld Dreamtime show in 2010 and 2011. Dreamworld Corroboree officially opened to the public on 12 December 2013.

It is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as well as the Rockefeller Foundation. Broadly, it deals with improving agricultural products and supporting local farm owners and labor. The late Kofi Annan was on its board of directors; various other members are internationally eminent in fields such as agriculture, policy management or planning and coordination, such as its president since 2014, Agnes Kalibata.  Goals  AGRA's stated goals (for 2020) are: * doubling the income of 20 million small farmers * reducing food insecurity 50% in 20 countries * ensuring that at least 15 countries are on a path toward sustainable and climate-friendly green agriculture In an interview with This Is Africa, Jane Karuku, President of AGRA, explained their focus: ‚ÄúThe first and most important thing is that we have to continue building on the capacity of Africans themselves to do agricultural research. That requires investment in scientists and in research institutions, which receive very little funding by government, so that we can breed more seed varieties that are high yielding and resistant to pests and diseases.‚Äù  Projects  * Development of disease- resistant strains of cassava. The genetically-engineered cassava are reportedly immune to cassava brown streak virus disease and the cassava common mosaic virus. * PhD programs at universities in Ghana and South Africa  Critiques  A \\"Voices From Africa\\" conference has suggested that AGRA was planned without African voices, and imposes quick-fix technological solutions on complex and historically deep social issues, that it will impose a regime in which farmers lose power over their own seeds and are forced to buy them back from large corporations year after year. This system may also contribute to the marginalization of women. The conference compiled a set of papers containing various arguments: * The Foundation's plan for Africa involves the production of cash crops which can be sold on the global market. This may leave countries unable to produce food for themselves, and dependent on fluctuations in the global market. * Some worry that AGRA will push genetic use restriction technology on African farmers, again leaving them dependent on outside companies for new seeds. * Some critics have said that AGRA misrepresents Africa by cherry-picking spokespeople to support one viewpoint on genetically modified crops. * Some technologies promoted by AGRA may create dependence on herbicides, which raises the possibility of super-weeds. * Hunger in Africa results more from poverty than from actual food shortages; people will not be able to buy any additional food that gets produced without larger systemic changes. Most of these papers call for local control and food sovereignty as an alternative. Other sources, including the African Centre for Biosafety, Ecoterra Intl. and The Guardian, have reported that the Gates Foundation, allied with Monsanto and Cargill, plans to aggressively promote strains of genetically modified soy in Mozambique and beyond. A conference titled \\"Living With the Gates Foundation\\" contained some criticism of Gates Foundation sponsorship. One author suggested that the foundation's influence on media and global health was so great it could chill almost all criticism.

Life After attending school in Sneek, Van den Bergh van Eysinga started studying theology at Leiden University in 1893. He obtained a doctorate in 1901 on a thesis about Indian influences on early Christian stories, for which W.C. van Manen had been the thesis advisor.

Refuting the authenticity of the epistle of Clement and of Ignatius of Antioch, he concluded that there was no evidence for the existence of the Paulines before Marcion. He also listed internal evidence for these epistles being pseudepigraphs from Marcionite circles. In several places, the writing does not fit with a Jewish background of the author. On these matters he disagreed with Adolf von Harnack.

The speed of sukhovey is usually moderate 5 to 20 m/s. Relative humidity is less than 30%. Sukhovey emanates from the periphery of anticyclones in summer predominantly with the intrusion of the tropical masses of air (analogous to khamsin, sirocco and other). At a high air temperature (20‚Äì25 ¬∞C and above) the sukhovey causes strongly increasing evaporation from the soils. The low mobility of anticyclones causes the steady duration of the sukhovey over several days, which with the insufficient soil moisture causes drought, spoiling of the harvests of cereal and fruit crops, loss of plants. The warm and dry air masses originate above the deserts of Africa, Asia Minor, and also in South Kazakhstan, and with them sukhoveys are extended to the wooded plains of Russia and Kazakhstan, but more frequently they invade the semi-deserts and the steppes. Historically, these winds have been a major impediment to large-scale sedentary agriculture in Central Asia.

It aims to establish telecommunication and media companies along a section of the banks of the river Spree as well as to implement an urban renewal of the surrounding area. So far, for the most part, unused or temporarily occupied real estate is to be converted into office buildings, lofts, hotels, and other new structures. The plans date predominantly from the 1990s, but only a part of them was implemented due to unfavorable economic circumstances at the time. Promoters saw in this project a great opportunity for the former East Berlin, while critics saw the selling-out of the area's most valuable properties. The following criteria were defined for sustainable location development: * Public access to the riverfront, * Buildings with ground-floor public areas, * A mixture of large-scale and small-scale use, * Ambitious architectural concepts, * The integration of art and media.mediaspree.de/Zielrichtung at archive.org Project management There is no specific institution that centrally manages and markets the project; Mediaspree is merely a label. The planning for individual building projects lies with property owners, investors, and the borough (in particular, Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg). The association Regionalmanagement mediaspree e.V. (originally, media spree Berlin GmbH) was founded in May 2004 as a contact point for investors and businesses, which lasted until December 2008. It arose from a private sector initiative as a consortium of different interest groups: investors from the building and construction industry, property owners that, after the Wende (i.e., the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany), had acquired the previously unused land around the path of the Berlin Wall, as well as representatives from the Senate, Borough, and Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK: Industrie- und Handelskammer). The borough of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg was not in charge, but rather a partner in the context of a Public-Private Partnership. Association membership was limited to the owners, renters and leaseholders of land or buildings in the Spree area. Mediaspree e.V. had 21 members in 2008, including the Anschutz Entertainment Group, Behala (a dock and storage company), Berlin's waste management agency, Deutsche Post Property Development, GASAG, IVG Real Estate and TLG Real Estate.mediaspree.de/Mitglieder at archive.org This association considered its mission to be: to act as a broker for the corresponding spaces and properties of the Spree-zone; to advise resident businesses as well as those interested in relocating there; to develop contacts between owners, agencies and sponsors; and to take steps toward marketing and image-building.Malah Helman: Mediaspree und der neoliberale Stadtumbau in abriss-berlin.de, 26. Januar 2007 After public sponsorship ran out, Mediaspree e.V. was dissolved on 31 December 2008. Its duties are now fulfilled by a property association, recently constituted, which nonetheless still operates under the name Mediaspree. Project Site Site of the Mediaspree area The project extends along a , space on both sides of the Spree riverfront, on the borders of four districts: Mitte, Friedrichshain, Kreuzberg und Alt-Treptow. It is bordered to the west by , to the north by the railway tracks of the Berlin S-Bahn (rapid transit trains), to the east by , and to the south by two streets (Schlesischen Stra√üe and K√∂penicker Stra√üe). The Spree is about wide along this section and the riverfront runs relatively straight. The river is cross-cut by three bridges within the Mediaspree zone: , and Oberbaumbr√ºcke. Along with large, undeveloped lots one can find numerous industrial and trade buildings from the 19th and 20th centuries, such as the (egg cold-storage warehouse) on the (East Harbor) and the (ice factory), as well as various new buildings and the East Side Gallery. The area is easily accessible by public transit as well as regional and long-distance trains. History In the 19th and early 20th centuries, this area was primarily occupied by industry and trade. Many of the buildings still standing date from this period and are characteristic of the architecture of that era. A few of these are now protected by the Denkmalschutz (de) designation; that is, they are listed as historical monuments. Of particular importance for the region before World War II were the East Harbor, Osthafen (de), opened in 1913 with extensive storage facilities for grains and other goods, as well as the Eierk√ºhlhaus (egg cold- storage warehouse) and the Eisfabrik (ice factory). Between 1939 and 1945, the premises were primarily used by the Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces). The harbor served as a shipping center for goods, and tanks and other munitions were serviced in the former bus garage and present-day event space Arena Berlin (de) in Treptower Park. More than 150 foreign workers and prisoners of war worked on the harbor's premises. Large portions of the buildings were destroyed after the war. Until 1947, large sites were seized and used by the Soviets, transportable material was stripped and shipped to the Soviet Union as a form of reparation. During the time of Cold War, this area lay in the middle of the border zone between East- and West-Berlin, which made commercial development impossible. On the GDR side, portions of the industrial buildings were transformed into watchtowers for border security. The Berlin Wall ran along the northern bank of the Spree, parallel to the river that marked the official border. On the West-Berlin side, south of the Spree and bordering on Kreuzberg, stood various alternative projects. The restructuring of the area after the Wende began slowly. An approximately 1.3 km (0.8 mi) long section of the wall was not torn down, but rather designed and painted by artists since 1990 as the East Side Gallery, the longest open-air gallery in the world. In 1998, the Ostbahnhof train station began renovations, reopening in 2000. Many unused properties were bought up by investors. One decisive development began in 2002 with the passage of a land development plan through the Berlin Senate and the advancement of the \\"Mediaspree\\" project. Overview Among the first development projects to be completed in the Mediaspree-region after the fall of the Berlin Wall were: the Treptowers (de), the ver.di headquarters at the Schillingbr√ºcke bridge, as well as the renovation of the Eierk√ºhlhaus into the German headquarters for Universal Music, which received 10 Million Euros worth of sponsorship funding from the Senate and was completed in the middle of 2002. In early 2004, there followed the similarly subsidized settlement of MTV Networks Germany in a former warehouse at Osthafen. VIVA and VIVA Plus followed in 2005, due to their acquisition by MTV.Information about the \\"Mediaspree\\" in the Media Guide Berlin-Brandenburg . Messetreff.com. Retrieved on 30 May 2011. The O‚ÇÇ World arena was constructed by the Anschutz Entertainment Group on the grounds of the former Ostg√ºterbahnhof (de) (which was the site of the legendary nightclub Ostgut from 1998 to 2003, predecessor to Berghain) and opened on 10 September 2008, accompanied by protests.Wikinews: Protest and Chaos at the Opening of O2 World (11. September 2008), in German Other building and renovation projects in the Mediaspree- region that have since been completed include the EnergieForum Berlin, the Industriepalast (Industry Palace) at Warschauer Stra√üe, the European Shared Service Center of BASF in Oberbaum-City, the Fernsehwerft (TV-Wharf), the cleaning of the Viktoria-M√ºhle (Victoria Mill), the Wissinger H√∂fe (Wissinger Courtyards), the former army bakery and the Josetti-H√∂fe (Josetti Courtyards). In contrast, as-yet unfinished projects include Spree Urban and Spreeport, the Columbus-Haus, the development of the area around Postbahnhof (the postal train station, de), the Anschutz site, BSR's Quartier in Orange, the prospective fashion house Labels 2, a planned yacht harbor, the Neuen Spreespeicher (\\"New\\" Granary on the Spree), and the renovation of the Eisfabrik (de).Berlin liegt an der Spree Informational video about the Mediaspree at google.com, in German For recreational purposes, Mediaspree has planned a 10m (33 ft) wider riverfront strip and a \\"Park on the Spree,\\" as well as small pocket parks between the Spree and Stralauer Allee around the East Side Gallery. Furthermore, footpaths and bicycle paths are slated to be built on both sides of the river. The reconstruction of the destroyed Brommybr√ºcke bridge, intended to alleviate the forecasted increase in traffic volume, was abandoned after further protests; instead, only a temporary \\"artistic footbridge\\" was supposed to be built. It was not built. Stadtumbau West Mediaspree is associated with the Senate project Stadtumbau West (\\"City-Renovation West\\", de), which calls not only for the restructuring of the Kreuzberg riverfront, but also for the development of the Neuk√∂lln- S√ºdring, Sch√∂neberg-S√ºdkreuz and Tiergarten-Nordring/Heidestra√üe areas. With this project, both the federal government and the state of Berlin hope to counteract the negative consequences of economic and demographic change by fostering \\"private investment and sustainable workplaces.\\"Information on the development and aid program Stadtumbau Ost and West , by the Berlin Senate Department for Urban Development, in German Completed Projects Descriptions are largely based on the descriptions posted on the former mediaspree.de websiteSite descriptions by mediaspree.de, at archive.org =Northern Spree Riverfront from West to East=  Fortress Multi Service Center  Built by Fortress Immobilien AG Meerbusch on Holzmarktstra√üe 1‚Äì9, directly next to the Jannowitzbr√ºcke station, this Multi-Service-Center included a Tamoil gas station, a Burger King with \\"drive-in\\", a Lidl discount supermarket and offices. The investment volume came to 8.3 Million Euros. This ensemble was torn down at the end of 2018. Trias BVG The Trias on Holzmarktstra√üe 15‚Äì17 was built between 1994 and 1996 and houses the headquarters of the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) since August 2008. The complex is composed of three 13-floor office towers connected by a seven-floor concourse. Ibis Hotel This seven-floor building complex at the Schillingbr√ºcke bridge was completed in the year 2000 and consists of three parts, in which commercial spaces, 20 apartments and the 242-room \\"Hotel Ibis Berlin City Ost\\" are located. EnergieForum Berlin The structure at Stralauer Platz 33/34 was erected in 1906‚Äì1908 and housed the Zentralmagazin der st√§dtischen Gaswerke (central depot for the municipal gasworks). In 2002, it was converted into the EnergieForum Berlin, with a focus on renewable energy and energy efficiency. The building was also expanded through new construction; the original building, protected as a historical monument, is connected to two modern wings by a glass atrium. The businesses and institutions that reside in the EnergieForum are \\"green energy\\" companies that have established themselves in the fields of environmentally friendly and renewable energy as well as energy efficiency. East-Side-Park Sign for the boat landing at East-Side-Park, with the Berlin Wall and O2 World in the background The East-Side-Park is situated between the East Side Gallery and the Spree. Like the planned \\"Park on the Spree\\" (see below), it was commissioned by the district authority of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg and designed by the landscape architectural firm H√§fner/Jim√©nez. In the middle of the park is the so-called \\"Boat Landing Plaza,\\" a boat landing built for the O2 World complex. The surface area of the park covers approximately and was under construction from August 2006 to early 2009. The construction costs ran to 816,000 Euros. The grounds are split into two levels; the upper level will feature a memorial space for the Berlin Wall and the earlier patrol road. Its sparse design is intended to evoke the \\"death strip\\" that used to run along the wall. The East Side Gallery, painted onto the remains of the wall at this site, was repaired and restored in 2008. The lower level of the park provides a promenade directly along the water. A lawn stretches between the two levels, sloping down to the river Spree. The East-Side-Park has received criticism above all for the boat landing for O‚ÇÇ World, which will require the removal of a section of the heritage-protected East Side Gallery. Moreover, a billboard has been built on this site, which was perceived to be objectionable due to its dimensions, light intensity, and location along the sightline between the Oberbaumbr√ºcke and the Fernsehturm. O2 World O2 World between Berlin Ostbahnhof and Warschauer Stra√üe With a maximum capacity of 17,000, the O2 World at M√ºhlenstr√üe 12‚Äì30 is the second largest multi-use indoor arena in Germany (after the Lanxess Arena in Cologne). The laying of the first foundation stone took place on 13 September 2006; the grand opening, accompanied by protests, followed on 10 September 2008. The owner and operator is the Anschutz Entertainment Group. The construction costs amount to 165 million Euros and were mostly absorbed by the Berlin Senate. The naming rights agreement with O2 (Germany) is set to last for a period 15 years. Since the opening of the arena, it has hosted home games for the city's hockey team, Eisb√§ren Berlin, and their basketball team, Alba Berlin. It is also used for concerts and conventions. The O2 World arena is one of the most criticized projects of the Mediaspree. Complaints have primarily been about the immense size and light intensity of the outdoor LED screens as well as the course of the building's construction, which has been seen as insensitive (see East- Side-Park above). BSR-Kundendienstzentrum (BSR Customer Service Center) This customer service center for the BSR (Berliner Stadtreinigungsbetriebe, Berlin's waste management agency) is part of the still-planned Quartier in Orange (see below). BSR moved into a cluster of buildings on M√ºhlenstra√üe 9/10 that consists of a new building and an apartment building converted into offices. The buildings, including a BSR service station located on the property, are interconnected by an enclosed walkways on two levels. Situated on the premises are also garages and parking lots for the vehicles of BSR's subsidiary Ruwe GmbH, which has its headquarters on Warschauer Stra√üe. Industriepalast Industriepalast on Warschauer Stra√üe The so-called \\"Industriepalast\\" (Industry Palace) on Warschauer Stra√üe 34‚Äì44 was built between 1906 and 1907 according to plans by Johann Emil Schaudt (de). It involves a multi-story factory, typical for its time, made out of five distinct buildings held together by an underlying iron- frame construction. From 1992 to 1993, the heritage-protected fa√ßade of the Industriepalast was remodeled. Buildings 43 and 44 were extensively refurbished for the purposes of the Mediaspree project and a new building was added that matched the style of the historical buildings. The floors were converted into office space, resulting in a total of 3,500m¬≤ (37,674sq.ft.) office and trade space. Toyota-Autohaus (Toyota Car Dealership) The Toyota car dealership at Stralauer Allee 44‚Äì47 arose from an investment of 10 Million Euros and opened in November 2007. New and used cars are put on display in approximately 2,800m¬≤ (30,140sq.ft.) of usable retail space. There is also a car workshop for the luxury line Lexus, which Toyota owns. Universal Music Headquarters, Germany (Eierk√ºhlhaus) The Eierk√ºhlhaus on the East Harbor in Berlin Since July 2002, the German headquarters of the Universal Music corporation has been located at Stralauer Allee 1, in a former Eierk√ºhlhaus (egg cold-storage warehouse), which was built in 1928/1929 and designed by the Dresden's building officer, Oskar Pusch. The functional and heritage-protected fa√ßade of this former refrigerated warehouse features elements of Bauhaus architecture: thick brickwork walls with diamond-shaped decorative patterns made of clinker bricks and molded ceilings. After being closed down, the Berlin Harbor and Warehouse Corporation (Berliner Hafen- und Lagerhausgesellschaft, or BEHALA) decided in 1992 to put the Eierk√ºhlhaus and the neighboring granary (see below) to new use. There were plans, in 1995, to connect the two buildings into one complex and to use it as a \\"Business Design Center,\\" which was nevertheless not brought to fruition. From 2000 to 2002, the cold-storage warehouse was converted into an office and commercial building by the Berlin architect Reinhard M√ºller. It was in doing so that the originally closed fa√ßade of the building was opened on three sides and furnished with a glass curtain wall. Only the northwest side facing the Oberbaumbr√ºcke still features a closed brick wall. The historical style elements of the windows, barrel-vault ceilings and walls have survived. Originally, in the interest of historical preservation, there were plans to cover the window panes in screened diamond shapes to continue the pattern from the brickwork and to achieve the impression of a continuous fa√ßade. Due to problems with the lighting of interior spaces, this was ultimately abandoned. Aside from Universal Music, various other media and service industry businesses have moved into the building. Office Lofts in the Granary The former granary Built between 1907 and 1913, this granary was designed by Berlin architect Friedrich Krause, who had already completed the docks in Stettin. He opted for a classicist design typical for the time, including a giant hipped roof, clinker brickwork, and ashlar masonry. Until 1990 the building was used as a warehouse, after which it stood empty for several years. After a construction permit was issued in May 2000, it was completely refurbished until March 2001, leaving the stylistic elements of the windows, hipped roof and walls intact. Additional stairwells and elevators as well as an underground garage were newly constructed. Over all eight floors, approximately 18,000m¬≤ (193,750sq.ft.) of offices were created, which apparently drew great interest from renters‚Äîat present, there are no spaces available for rent. Oberbaum City Oberbaum-City buildings and the former \\"Narva (Company)-Cube\\", now used by BASF Oberbaum-City is the name given to the former Narva light bulb factory since 1999. It is bordered on the west by Warschauer Stra√üe, on the north by Bahnstrasse as well as the S-Bahn station Warschauer Stra√üe, on the east by Lehmbruckstra√üe and to the south by the river Spree. The name of the complex comes from the neighboring Oberbaumbr√ºcke. After Narva and Osram had completely halted production in 1992, the existing buildings were completely gutted, along with their heritage-protected fa√ßades, and were expanded and renovated under the direction of the architects Reichel und Stauth (from Braunschweig). In doing so, the original structures and their historical fa√ßades could be preserved with modern steel construction. Food and retail space was developed in five building complexes as well as over 80,000m¬≤ of office space. Approximately 70 firms have offices here, including BASF (see below), adesso AG, DEKRA, ThyssenKrupp AG and the customer service center for the Deutsche Post. Oberbaum City is managed and marketed by HVB Real Estate, a subsidiary of UniCredit Bank AG (HypoVereinsbank). Further development projects may be on the horizon for the remaining buildings. BASF European Shared Service Center The most striking building of Oberbaum City is the \\"Narva-W√ºrfel\\" (\\"Narva-Cube,\\" named after the former lightbulb company), also known as the Lichtturm (light tower). It has been leased by BASF since 2005 as a location for its European service center. The building was constructed between 1906 and 1912 by the Deutsche Gasgl√ºhlicht AG (German Gaslight Co., de) as part of a gaslight plant and was Berlin's first high-rise building. The addition of glass construction to heighten the building occurred in 1963. From mid-1997 to mid-2000, the plant was converted into an office building and is now listed as a historical monument of engineering. MTV Central Europe MTV's broadcast center in the former East Warehouse In early 2004, the headquarters of the German broadcaster MTV Germany moved from Munich to Stralauer Alle 6/7, into a former BEHALA warehouse, which was thoroughly refurbished. To the west, between 2006 and 2007, a new building was erected for the affiliate broadcast group Viacom (VIVA, VIVA Plus, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central). The building has a square layout with an edge-length of approximately and a height of approximately . The building houses offices for 300 employees, archival and technical areas, common areas and an in-house daycare center. The clay brick fa√ßade of the new building was intended to match the neighboring warehouse in both brick-shape and color. A-Medialynx GmbH The former harbor offices of BEHALA at Stralauer Allee 8 were renovated in 2007 and subsequently occupied by A-Medialynx GmbH, a full-range supplier for TV productions and satellite communications technology owned by Helmut Audrit. Fernsehwerft (TV Dockyard) The new building for Fernsehwerft between the buildings of A-Medialynx GmbH (left) und von Zigarren Herzog (right). A new building was constructed between July 2007 and February 2009 between BEHALA's former harbor offices and cafeteria. The Fernsehwerft (TV Dockyard) houses two modern TV studios, cutting rooms and offices across a surface area of approximately 6,000m¬≤ (64,583sq.ft.). The building is used by sister companies A-Medialynx GmbH (already based nearby in Stralauer Allee 8) and fernsehwerft GmbH. Since July 2009, the TV programs Sat.1-Fr√ºhst√ºcksfernsehen (de) and Sat.1 Magazin have been produced here by maz&more; Gmbh, a full subsidiary of N24 (Germany), which Sat.1-Zentralredaktion on 1 January 2009. The executive officers are Torsten Rossmann (chairman) and Maria von Borcke. Zigarren Herzog The former BEHALA harbor cafeteria at Stralauer Allee 9 was built in 1909 and is protected as a historical moment. Like the harbor's offices, it was refurbished in 2007 and occupied by A-Medialynx GmbH, who owns the building. Since 2008, a 200m¬≤ (2,152sq.ft.) space has been rented out to Zigarren Herzog Vertriebsgesellschaft mbH (Herzog Cigar Co.), a company that maintains a Salan and a 60m¬≤ (645sq.ft.) humidor for cigar storage. Labels Berlin 1 Labels Berlin 1 in the old East Warehouse (left) and the new building for Labels Berlin 2 The former BEHALA East Warehouse on Stralauer Allee 10/11 was built in 1913 by Friedrich Krause and is listed as a historical monument of turn-of-the-century industrial architecture for its clinker brick fa√ßade, pilasters and moldings of limestone. In 2006, it was thoroughly cleaned, refurbished and renovated by Labels Projektmanagement GmbH & Co. KG in close cooperation with its future occupants. After the completion, eight fashion companies set up showrooms in that location, including Hugo Boss, Esprit and Tom Tailor. Additional new construction has been underway in the neighboring lot for an expansion, Labels Berlin 2 (see below). Labels Berlin 2 East of Labels Berlin 1, and in violation of a successful citizen's initiative in July 2008, the new building Labels Berlin 2 has been constructed.The \\"Bagger\\" is rolling for the Mediaspree, now. Der Tagesspiegel, from 21 August 2008. The design is by the Basel Architectural Firm HHF. The edifice has a green concrete fa√ßade, with a striking cut-out pattern of two alternating sinus curves of differing widths in the exposed concrete. With a total of 7,000m¬≤ in surface area, the five floors offer showroom space for twelve fashion companies. On the ground floor, there is a venue space for fashion shows, parties, and catering. On the roof is a leafy lounge. Additionally, there will be a pier built on the Spree, with a floating island for outdoor events and fashion shows. =Southern Spree Riverfront from East to West=  Treptowers  Treptowers viewed from the Spree The Treptowers are a four-part building complex right at the Elsenbr√ºcke bridge. The highest part is the tower, visible from a distance, which at is the tallest office building in Berlin. The already-existing buildings that were part of VEB Electronics Factory‚Äîin operation until 1995‚Äîwere integrated into the new construction. The developer and owner is Roland Ernst St√§dtebau GmbH. After completion of the complex in 1998 it was taken over by Allianz SE; the building is now primarily a Berlin branch office for the company, although other parts are rented out. TwinTowers The building complex between Hoffmannstra√üe and the river Spree consists of four parts: two 15-floor towers and two five-floor quadrangles. It was designed by the Stuttgart-based architectural firm Kieferle & Partner and completed in 1997. The over 24,000m¬≤ (258,334sq.ft.) of office and commercial space is rented out to various businesses, of which 6,700m¬≤ (72,118sq.ft.) goes to 50Hertz Transmission GmbH. Arena Arena Berlin on Eichenstra√üe 4 is an event venue in Berlin-Treptow. It is located in a former bus garage for the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG, Berlin Transport Company). When it was built in 1927 by the architect Franz Ahrens, it was the largest unsupported hall in Europe, at 7,000m¬≤ (75,347sq.ft.). During World War II, it was used by the National Socialists (i.e., \\"Nazis\\") as a maintenance hangar for tanks and other war machines, then from the end of the 1940s until the beginning of the 1950s it was used as a refugee camp. From 1961, due to its location inside the border strip of the Berlin Wall, it was only accessible to GDR troops and BVG employees with a special permit. In 1993, it was shut down as the center of operations for the BVG, due to structural deterioration. After being refurbished as a historical monument, the association ART Kombinat was founded in 1995 to use the hall for cultural functions. Today, Arena hosts concerts, lectures, conferences, galas, TV shows and other events. The theater and event venue Glashaus (Glass House) also belongs to the Arena Berlin complex, as well as the MAGAZIN exhibit hall, Badeschiff (\\"Bathing Boat\\"), the club/restaurant boat Hoppetosse and the bar Club der Visionaere. Wasserschloss (Castle on the Water) This former commercial park on Schlesischen Stra√üe 26 is distinguishable by its traditional clinker brick fa√ßade and transom windows. After refurbishment, the interior was converted into business lofts, which are rented out Armo Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH. The colloquial name Wasserschloss comes from its position at the mouth of the Landwehrkanal into the river Spree. ORCO-GSG Business Park The building complex on Schlesische Stra√üe 27 was built between 1926 and 197 by the Berlin Mortar Works and is partially protected as a historical monument. In 1997, the complex was expanded with new constructions. The project leader was the Berlin-based Gewerbesiedlungsgesellschaft mbH (GSG, Business Site LLC), which was taken over by the real estate company ORCO Property Group in 2007. All sections of the building are six storeys high. The 32 total rental units are used by various companies as business, office, production, and trade spaces. Industriepalast at Schlesisches Tor The Industriepalast seen from the north bank of the Spree This business park on Schlesische Stra√üe 29/30 was built between 1907 and 1908 and is listed as a historical monument. It is colloquially known as the \\"Industriepalast at Schlesiches Tor.\\" The spaces are rented out by the Verwaltung Berliner Grundst√ºcke GmbH (Berlin Real Estate Management LLC), which also has its head offices in the building. An especially remarkable element of the complex is the steel and glass superstructure that hangs out over the river Spree from the fourth floor of one of the buildings. Viktoria-M√ºhle (Victoria Mill) Victoria Mill (Schlesische Stra√üe 38) was constructed between 1891 and 1898 and is protected as a historical monument. The original complex includes three cross-buildings; in contrast, the granary on Cuvrystra√üe and the factory building on Falckensteinstra√üe were added after World War II. The whole complex is organized into individual parts: the grain silo with cleaning and silo facilities, the mill building, the flour storehouse with a flour silo, and an apartment and business wing. Until the end of the 1960s, grain was processed and stores on the premises. The nightclub Club 103 was located here until September 2008. The remodeling of the area was planned by the architectural firm aschenbrenner mosler & andere. Studios, apartments and office-lofts were created in the refurbished buildings, which are managed by Artus Lagerhaus GmbH (also located in the building). Wissinger H√∂fe (Wissinger Courtyards) The Wissinger Yards were once the largest seed and grain storehouse in Europe. The wholesaler Julius Wissinger had the site built in 1908 as Lagerhaus S√ºd-Ost (South-West Warehouse). One can find the complex, which is listed as a historical monument, at Pfuelstra√üe 5, directly on the river Spree. From the end of the 1990s to the beginning of the 2000s, the buildings were thoroughly refurbished and repaired. They are primarily offices and business lofts as well as music spaces and artists' workshops, in which record labels and modern service enterprises have taken up residence. The building complex is owned and operated by the Berlin-based Kuthe GmbH. N√§hmaschinenfabrik (Sewing-Machine Factory) The former Singer sewing- machine factory on K√∂penicker Stra√üe 8/9 was refurbished in the 1990s. This heritage-protected building complex includes a factory building dating from 1860 as well as a brick building from 1927 that was used by Singer as a storehouse and branch office. Most of the renovated space has been converted to offices; at the beginning of 2009, 200 employees of media and telecommunications companies moved into approximately 3,000m¬≤ of space. There are plans to expand the building in which a private bicycle museum is located. Marmeladenfabrik (Marmalade Factory) This residential and factory building on K√∂penicker Stra√üe 10a was constructed directly on the river Spree in 1889, in the Jugendstil (i.e., Art Nouveau) style. The apartments in the front building were originally stately officer's apartments. The former Marmalade Factory is situated in two cross-buildings behind the front building. The premises are protected under Ensembleschutz (de), which is a form of heritage protection for a collection of structures based on how they fit together (rather than their individual architectural styles, for example). The whole factory site was comprehensively renovated, modernized and expanded between from 2004 to 2005. The factory halls were converted into lofts and penthouses and their balconies were widened. The rental units are managed and rented out by Erber Immobilien. Heeresb√§ckerei (Army Bakery) and Viktoria- Speicher II (Victoria Granary II) Die Heeresb√§ckerei Berlin The Army Bakery was built in 1805 at K√∂penicker Stra√üe 16/17 and was part of the K√∂niglichen Preu√üischen Proviantamt (Royal Prussian Commissariat). From 1888 to 1893 the facility was expanded with five additional buildings, which‚Äîexcepting one mill‚Äîstill stand today and are listed as historical sites. The representative fa√ßade of the Army Bakery is six storeys high and consists of fairfaced, yellow brickwork. Inside, there are cast-iron supports and prussian barrel-vaults. The renovated floorspace amounts to 9,300m¬≤ (100,104sq.ft.). Throughout the complex, office and business lofts are planned within the scope of the Mediaspree. The rooms will be rented out as storage spaces by Polaris Immbobilienmanagement GmbH. This site also features the Lounge-Club and Restaurant Spindler & Klatt. Velvet-Fabrik (Velvet Factory) The lot at K√∂penicker Stra√üe 18‚Äì20 is approximately 10,000m¬≤ (107,640sq.ft) large and features two historical structures, built between 1852 and 1881. This was the former site of the Berlin Velvet Factory. Distinguishing features include high ceilings, cast-iron supports and exposed brickwork. The buildings were refurbished between 2008 and 2009 according to historical preservation standards by Nicolas Berggruen Holdings GmbH and they are now rented out as offices, apartments, and artists' lofts. At the end of October 2008, the designer furniture retailer Exil Wohnmagazin opened their new head offices at K√∂penicker Stra√üe 20 on 6,000m¬≤ (64,580sq.ft.) of floorspace. ver.di-Bundeszentrale Ver.di regional offices on Paula- Thiede-Ufer in Berlin A new office building was constructed at Paula-Thiede- Ufer 10 between November 2002 and July 2004. The building was designed by the architectural firm Kny & Weber and is the first completed part of the larger Spreeport project (see below). It is long, wide and high. The fa√ßade is composed of glass, steel, and red bricks. The main entrance on the river Spree presents a atrium. The building is equipped with a large conference center with modern media technology, catering areas, publicly accessible bookstore by Buchergilde Gutenberg as well as its own landing dock on the river Spree. The principal tenant since August 2004 is Vereinte Dienstungswerkschaft (ver.di), which uses the building as a national office and administration center. BDA-Bundesgesch√§ftsstelle (BDA National Branch Office) The Bund Deutscher Architekten (BDA, Association of German Architects) established their national headquarters in this office building on K√∂penicker Stra√üe 48‚Äì49. The offices of various other architectural and engineering firms are also located here as well as the Deutsches Architektur Zentrum (DAZ, German Architecture Center), an initiative of the BDA. It was developed in 2005 and has since put on events such as exhibitions, congresses, conventions, conferences, workshops and lectures in two halls and three seminar rooms. Furthermore, since 2009, a call has been put out for concrete ideas on how to make new use of the surrounding premises, where currently the restaurant-club and venue space Kiki Blofeld is located. Spree-Carr√©e The office and business site Spree-Carr√©e on Michaelkirchstra√üe 17/18 in Berlin-Mitte brings together a Gr√ºnderzeit-era building and a new building. During the restoration of the older building, efforts were made to preserve the historical character of the fa√ßade, with its typical glazed-brick facing. In the rental units, which are rented out by Bodenkontor Liegenschaften GmbH, there are various firms and businesses as well as a few social institutions, including the Deutscher Verein (German Association, de). Josetti Courtyards Fa√ßade of the Josetti Courtyards on Rungestra√üe This structure is located on Rungerstra√üe 22‚Äì24 near Jannowitzbr√ºcke. It was constructed in 1906 on a former wood storage site and consists of two complexes that extend to the river Spree and are listed as historical monuments. They present a challenging example for the characteristic trade complexes of Luisenstadt (de). Over the last century, these courtyards have been inhabited by a wood and metal processing plant, a cigarette factory belonging to the Jewish manufacturer Oskar Josetti (after whom the buildings are named), a documentary film studio, the GDR-era electronic chip manufacturer Robotron and, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Berlin Senate Administration for Finance. The building complex is owned by Eurohypo, which has put of floorspace for rent since August 2004. Maintenance and management have been assigned to Beletage Immobilienkultur e. K. Over 260 distinct renters have taken up residence there, most of them working in the fields of design, art, culture and communication. In many cases these are self-employed workers, freelancers, small and expanding businesses as well as startup companies. Leases are signed with up to three months' notice for cancellation. By the end of 2012 most of the leases with smaller startup companies were cancelled since the new owner Oceanis S.A. from Luxembourg was renting the complex to companies like Daimler-Benz and Fab.com. Jannowitz-Center The Jannowitz-Center was designed by the architectural firm Hentrich-Petschnigg & Partner (HPP) and built between 1994 and 1997. It is situated directly at Jannowitzbr√ºcke, on Br√ºckenstra√üe 5/6, across from the Chinese embassy. It consists of a modern office and business complex of 30,000m¬≤ (322,917sq.ft), into which mostly retail stores and medium-scale businesses have settled. Three out of the nine floors are being rented by Techniker Krankenkasse (TK, de). The center is owned by Dazzle Zweite Berlin GmbH (based in Frankfurt am Main), which has contracted Tattersall Lorenz Immibilienverwaltung und -management GmbH for building maintenance.

Retrieved on 30 May 2011. =Northern Spree Riverfront from West to East= Columbus-Haus Three eight-floor office blocks are to be erected at Stralauer Platz 35 under the name of Columbus-Haus. (The complex is not related to the Columbushaus that was formerly located on Potsdamer Platz.) The project involves three long, L-shaped building sections, which can also be built and sold separately. The street-facing fa√ßade would be built out of stone, while the river-facing one would be glasswork. The construction will leave a strip against the river for a planned riverfront footpath, which would nonetheless be covered by an overhang from the upper floors. The wood-plank rooftop terrace and the wooden pier in front of the offices is intended to recall a boat-deck, while an elevated setback is supposed to allude to a captain's deck. The internal configuration of the 1,600m¬≤ of floorspace is designed to be flexible. The building permit for Columbus-Haus was issued in 2004 and extended in 2008. The original owner, Wayss & Freytag AG Projektenwicklung based in Frankfurt am Main, sold the premises and the building permit to a Spanish company. This company seems unlikely to carry out the office project, instead proposing a new, predominantly residential building application.Homepage of the citizen's action group, ''Mediaspree versenken'' .

Postal service area with postal station The postal area includes approximately of land near the Ostbahnhof station, bordered by the Stra√üe der Pariser Kommune to the west, the railway tracks to the north, Mariane-von-Rantzau-Stra√üe to the east and M√ºhlenstra√üe to the south. At the center of the premises stands a heritage-protected postal station (Postbahnhof), which was built between 1906 and 1908 using the design of the postal building councillor Wilhelm Tuckermann. It is 4,300 m¬≤ in size and includes two large mail loading rooms, a packing area, and a train shed. The spaces are mostly used as an event location for Fritz Club (operated by the youth-oriented radio broadcaster Fritz; de) as well as for concerts; nonetheless, exhibitions (such as Body Worlds) and various other events (e.g., Berlin Fashion Week) also take place there. For the area surrounding the Postbahnhof, there are plans to create a new city neighborhood of offices, creative businesses, residences, hotels, leisure, dining, retail and retail-related services. They are supposed to be connected to the planned Park an der Spree (see below) with so-called Spreefenster (\\"Spree-Windows\\"). The land-use plan stipulates building blocks with heights of and ; however, two skyscraper buildings at and are also included. The citizens' initiative \\"Mediaspree versenken\\" has criticized the project especially for the dimensions of the structures, the resulting shadows cast on the area as well as the tiny residential section (16.6% of the total floor space). Park an der Spree (Park on the Spree) The Park an der Spree consists of a 2.1-hectare (5-acre) public green space, which will be located between the Postal Service Area (see above) and the river Spree. The Brommysteg (see below) is to be built at the eastern edge of the park. The park is understood to be a continuation of the adjoining eastern riverfront promenade at the East Side Gallery (see the East-Side-Park, above). It was commissioned by the Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg district authority and developed by the landscape-architecture firm H√§fner/Jim√©nez. The building costs will amount to 620,000 Euros. Much like the East-Side-Park promenade, this park is divided into two areas. Due to historical landmark protections, the wall and central patrol strip remains preserved. The space between the wall and the Spree will be arranged primarily as an extensive lawn; 80 Japanese cherry trees are to be planted towards the river. They will stand along the stretch of land above the edge of the riverbank and arranged in individual blocks. A boat pier for ship traffic is to be installed in the middle of the park. In the western part of the park, a \\"Globe-Theater\\" has been planned, which could be used by the circus and theatre company shake! already located on the premises. East-Side-Tower The East-Side-Tower is a planned residential high-rise building composed of upscale and exclusive condominium units. It is right next to the Warschauer Br√ºcke. The property owner and project developer is city.bauten Gesellschaft f√ºr Projektentwicklung und -management mbH, and the blueprints are by nps tschoban voss GbR Architekten BDA. The building's structure involves a and block with a 15-floor tower extending above. The building leaves a strip between itself and the Spree riverfront, and extends back to the Wall of the East-Side-Gallery with a minimal gap. Originally, the complex was supposed to include a chain of individual houses on the Spree riverfront, but those plans have already been retracted. Also, now that the redevelopment of the Brommybr√ºcke (de) is planned to be an automobile-free footbridge (see below), the high-rise project has lost its municipal-planning rationale as a bridge-head. The caf√©-bar Oststrand was located on the premises. Anschutz-Gel√§nde (Anschutz Grounds) The so-called Anschutz- Gel√§nde (Anschutz Grounds) have emerged in the area surrounding O‚ÇÇ World, named the U.S. investor Philip F. Anschutz. This involves a city district with approximately 520,000 m¬≤ (5,600,000 sq.ft.) of leisure, sport, and recreational spaces as well retail stores, offices, and dwellings. For example, an \\"Entertainment-Center\\" is planned west of O‚ÇÇ World, which is to house a \\"Currywurst Museum,\\" among other things. Additionally, five high-rise buildings are slated for construction, measuring between tall; the majority of the other buildings will be approximately tall. Open spaces are not foreseen in the plans, apart from a children's playground. Quartier in Orange The Quartier in Orange is a project belonging to the BSR (de) and located at M√ºhlenstra√üe 9/10. By 2008, the only customer service center had moved into the new location; the headquarters are still in Tempelhof. According to the investor opinion, the terrain between the Oberbaumbr√ºcke, the East Side Gallery, and O‚ÇÇ World has potential for development and flexibly expandable. Additional buildings could be erected on various lots, which could create, for example, up to 4,000 m¬≤ (43,100 sq.ft.) of retail space. NH-Hotel NH- Hotel under construction, April 2010 Directly east of the erstwhile granary (see above), at Stralauer Allee 3, the Spanish company NH Hoteles is building a four-star hotel and convention center with approximately 385 rooms and 13 conference rooms. The NDC Nippon Development Corporation is acting as the project developer. The building was designed by the architectural firm nps tchoban voss and consists of two structures: a traditional substructure of perforated fa√ßades and metal cladding is topped by a glass superstructure that cantilevers out over the Spree. On the upper levels, there is a fitness center with rooftop access, and a restaurant with outdoor patio has been planned on the riverside. The project contradicts the approved building plans in several respects, but it is nonetheless currently underway. The opening is slated for 2010. Hochhaus an der Elsenbr√ºcke (High-Rise at the Elsenbr√ºcke) The open spaces of the East Harbor (Osthafen, de), along Stralauer Allee 3‚Äì16, are to be filled with a dense chain of 20- and 24-m (65- and 79-ft) high buildings. A tower is planned at the Elsenbr√ºcke (de) bridge, which is supposed to form a \\"city gate\\" with Allianz Versicherung's (de) Treptowers across the bridge. Initial building permits were awarded to the owner BEHALA (de), at which point it sold the lots in question to investors. However, the land-use plans for the East Harbor have not been settled. The citizen's initiative Mediaspree versenken is especially opposed to the high-rise plans and the densely packed development projects on the riverside. Since July 2008, the initiative has been partly supported by the district assembly (Bezirksverordnetenversammlung) of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, which has pledged to fight against the construction of the high-rise at the Elsenbr√ºcke.Official information on the citizen's decree \\"Spreeufer f√ºr alle!\\" (\\"Spree riverfront for all!\\") in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg on 13 July 2008 ‚Äì Statement of arguments by the district assembly (Bezirksverordnetenversammlung) = Southern Spree Riverfront from East to West =  Fanny-Zobel-Stra√üe  The site at Fanny-Zobel-Stra√üe 13‚Äì21 is situated between the Treptowers and the TwinTowers.

It is a listed historical monument, protected as an example of industrial architecture. The halls are used by about 20 to 30 firms, who have rented the units out from the property owner, BEHALA. For example, the building materials merchant D√§mmisol established sale and storage spaces there. Since BEHALA wishes to sell the property to the highest bidder in the within the scope of the Mediaspree project, the existing rental contracts were cancelled. This could only happen by 31 December 2008, at the latest. In the course of the re-planning, the halls could have been torn down. The Victoria Warehouse was restored in February 2009. It is now the centerpiece of a new district center, with shops and cultural establishments. It is to be inaugurated in April 2009 and made accessible by water. In addition, an urban design exists awaiting the decision to set up a development plan. It comes from the architectural firm Mola Winkelm√ºller and includes a riverside promenade, bands of green space, and a multi-storey building.Design for the area around the Victoria-Warehouse by architectural firm ''Mola Winkelm√ºller''.

Artificial ice was produced here from 1896 to 1995. The approximately 11,000 m¬≤ (107,640 sq.ft.) complex consists of two courtyards with residential and industrial complexes. This also includes three cold storage warehouses as well as a boiler and machine room, which features clear, neoclassical red-brick architecture in the early modern style. In 1995, Treuhand Liegenschaftsgesellschaft Immobilien (TLG) took over the management of the building. In November 2008, it sold the heritage-protected ice factory to TELAMON GmbH from Bochum. This company also owns Radialsystem V, situated on the opposite bank of the Spree, and it is currently having an extensive inventory and detailed planning carried out.

For the currently filed plans, there is a building permit that includes authorization for the demolition of the historical cold storage warehouses.

April 2007Article: On the Spree Riverfront: hideous building projects, \\"MediaSpree\\" and \\"Stadtumbau West\\" in kreuzberg-info.de It is feared that, among other things, longtime residents will be displaced by rising maintenance costs, which will come about by virtue of the deliberate gentrification of the surrounding residential areas. The term Aufwertung (\\"Valorization\\"), used in this context as a synonym for cost increases and cultural change, has been deemed misleading rhetoric.Article: MediaSpree deserves to be sunk at antiberliner.de, published June/12 July 2007 Likewise, criticism is also directed at the privatization of public space and the Stadtumbau von oben (urban development from above), by which the interests and concerns of neighboring residents are not taken into account. There is talk of \\"part-privatized urban politics\\", whereby the property association \\"Mediaspree\\" understands itself first and foremost as a point of contact for projects and investors and shows hardly any interest in the opinion of residents, while the necessary infrastructure for the Mediaspree, such as streets, bridges, and lighting, are financed by public funds. This refers to things such as the subsidies in the millions of Euros, with which newly arrived businesses such as MTV Central and Universal Music were supported by the Berlin Senate. Furthermore, some have felt it irrational that the Senate welcomed and financed the building of O‚ÇÇ World, although there was no shortage of event spaces. After the Basketball team Alba Berlin made O‚ÇÇ World its new home stadium, the drop in occupancy rates at their former home stadium, Max-Schmeling-Halle in Prenzlauer Berg, must now be mitigated through publicly funded subsidies. The restructuring of wild-growing sections of the Spree is similarly coming under criticism. The now-smaller and narrower publicly accessible riverfront areas are criticized for being mostly under video surveillance.

In their opinion, this development comes at the loss of cultural diversity.Artikel \\"K√∂pi-Mediaspree gets concrete\\" in kreuzberg-info.de A further point of critique was the recognition of Mediaspree e.V. as a non-profit organization, despite it only accepting investors and property owners as members. It was the view of critics that behind the goal of ensuring long-term and ongoing development towards an effective and attractive business and cultural habitat, hid the implementation of merely private-economy interests. Moreover, the work of the association was supported by public funds. With the expiry of this funding and the dissolution of the association on 31 December 2008, this criticism has become obsolete. A rise in through-traffic has arisen as a result of the new event arena, O‚ÇÇ World, which has likewise been criticized by protesters.

According to them, the planned riverfront trail and pocket parks are not sufficient for a city with a population in the millions, like Berlin (3.4 million, as of 2010). The entire project is perceived as an investment in the high-end sector, primarily about profitable riverfront development with a privatized view of the river Spree, while the social realm is neglected.

Reactions  The borough of Friedrichshain- Kreuzberg already reacted to the Mediaspree with the citizens' movement \\"Spreeufer f√ºr alle!\\", which accommodated the initiators through a separate proposal that was put to a vote (see above). In direct comparison, voters preferred the initiators' alternative. The referendum is not binding. Nonetheless, the borough has retreated from some of its Mediaspree plans. Thus, the new high-rise at the Elsenbr√ºcke has been abandoned, and a bicycle- and footbridge will be built over the Spree, instead of the planned road bridge. This partially accommodates the central demands of the citizens' movement. In September 2008, a special committee was constituted, in which members of various factions and the citizens' initiative \\"Mediaspree versenken\\" could discuss possible changes to development projects in light of the referendum. The demands for a 50 m wide strip of free space along the riverfront was also pursued. Thus a compromise is possible with the property company that owns the property where Maria am Ostbahnhof is located: the strip of riverfront there will now be 20 or 30 meters wide (instead of the initially planned 10 m) and will provide space for a small park. At the end of February 2009, however, the Berlin Senate stepped into the negotiations. It feared indemnity claims on the part of investors, should the development plans be altered, and had \\"grave misgivings\\" (schwere Bedenken) against the abandonment of the high-rise project at the Elsenbr√ºcke. On these grounds, it threatened to revoke the borough's rights for independent urban planning. Mediaspree, the CDU and the FDP as well as the Chamber of Industry and Commerce welcomed this move, while the \\"Mediaspree versenken\\" initiative feared the loss of strategic leverage, since they only could exert influence over the borough (and not the entire city-state).Aulich, Uwe / Vorbringer, Anne: Machtkampf in der Mediaspree, published in Berliner Zeitung, 28 February 2009, page 23 References External links * \\"Media Spree\\" on Berlin's river: Swim next to offices at Cafebabel.com =German-language links= * Official Website at web.archive.org * Citizen's group Mediaspree versenken (\\"Sink the Mediaspree\\") * Interview with Ingeborg Junge-Reyer, Senator for City Development * Mediaspree versus Spreeufer f√ºr Alle! ‚Äì an Overview Category:Politics of Berlin Category:Mass media in Berlin Category:Geography of Berlin Category:Urban design Category:Redeveloped ports and waterfronts in Germany Category:Urban planning in Germany ","title":"Mediaspree"},{"id":"28276181","text":"Anne White was the defending champion but lost in the first round to Elly Hakami.

As a strong nationalist, his goal was to remedy the relatively weak American national institutions with a strong state. Weyl wrote widely on issues of economics, labor, public policy, and international affairs in numerous books, articles, and editorials; he was a coeditor of the highly influential The New Republic magazine, 1914-1916\\\\. His most influential book, The New Democracy (1912) was a classic statement of democratic meliorism, revealing his path to a future of progress and modernization based on middle class values, aspirations and brain work. It articulated the general mood: :\\"America to-day is in a somber, soul- questioning mood. We are in a period of clamor, of bewilderment, of an almost tremulous unrest. We are hastily revising all our social conceptions.... We are profoundly disenchanted with the fruits of a century of independence.\\" Early life  His father, Nathan Weyl, had emigrated from the German Palatinate, but his death, when Walter was seven, left the boy in the care of five brothers and sisters at the home of his maternal grandmother, the widow of Philadelphia merchant Julius Stern. Weyl started young (at 13) at Philadelphia Central High School and received a scholarship to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, entering as a junior and graduating (with distinction) two years later (at 19) after studies under economist Simon Patten. He studied law briefly and then went abroad for graduate work in economics at the universities of Halle, Paris, and Berlin. In 1896, he returned to Wharton to complete a doctorate; his dissertation was published a year later, as The Passenger Traffic of Railways. In 1899, he left academia and drifted for several years. He worked at a settlement house in New York. He searched for mineral deposits in Mexico. He performed statistical surveys for the Bureau of Labor and the United States Department of the Treasury. He helped John Mitchell, leader of the United Mine Workers, write Organized Labor: Its Problems, Purposes, and Ideals (1903). =Journalist and economist= Weyl started writing about the lives of new immigrants in popular magazine articles. Over time, he wrote increasingly about national resources and social policy. His book, The New Democracy (1912), came to serve as a statement for the US Progressive Movement and its economic reforms. In 1914, Weyl joined Herbert Croly and Walter Lippmann as a founding editors of The New Republic magazine, where he worked from 1914 to 1916. World War I In 1915, during World War I, he traveled in Germany and Russia, publishing his observations in American World Policies (1917) and The End of the War (1918). American World Policies (1917), published before the outcome of the war was known, examined the profound changes that it caused in the American psyche: \\"The Great War has thrown America back upon itself. It has come as a test and challenge to all our theories. Suddenly, yet subtly, it has shaken our optimism and undermined our faith in the peaceful progress of humanity. Our isolation is gone, and with it our sense of security and self-direction. Americans, who a few days ago would have dared to abolish army and navy as a supreme earnest of good faith, reluctantly agree to arm. 'Self-defence,' they now say, 'comes before progress. We must lay aside our hopes of a world at peace and must guard our gates.'\\" In 1917, Weyl traveled to China, Japan, and Korea. During the war, Weyl helped organize the quartermaster general's office in the War Department. Weyl had hoped but failed to be part of the U.S. delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, but he traveled to Europe anyway in the winter and the spring of 1919 to bear witness to the postwar gathering. He knew many of members of the Commission and spent a great deal of time composing numerous books in his head that might explain the complexities and tragedy of the conference. He was especially concerned with the growing restiveness of the \\"proletariat\\" and wondered if the conference was not marking \\"the suicide of capitalism.\\" Personal In 1907 Weyl married Bertha Poole, a labor organizer, writer, and fellow settlement house worker who came from a wealthy Chicago family. They lived mostly in Woodstock Their only son was Nathaniel Weyl. Death Weyl died of throat cancer on November 9, 1919 at the age of forty-six. Influence Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. included Weyl among important American political thinkers, among whom were Thorstein Veblen, John Dewey, Louis Brandeis; Herbert Croly, Walter Lippmann, and Charles A. Beard; and Rexford Tugwell, Adolf Berle, William T. Foster, Paul Douglas, Frances Perkins, Harry Hopkins, and Felix Frankfurter. The New Democracy celebrated the democratic impulse in the Progressive movement, theorizing that a \\"social surplus\\" (comfortable material prosperity) gave America the opportunity to achieve greater social justice. He decried the excessive individualism of the age, calling for more effective collective action led by experts and the state and national governments. He thought the US Constitution was too confining and that the selfishness of the rich was an obstacle to future reform. He believed that progress called for more direct democracy, more regulation of trusts big business by the federal government greater efficiency in business and in the public sector and an increased role for organized labor unions. He ridiculed the privileged and powerful but rejected socialism.

When off Delaware Bay Low attacked a Royal Navy man-of-war which he mistook for a whaler. The resulting combat lasted several hours and ended with the capture of one pirate vessel.Crooker In fact, the captured vessel was not the one named Fancy - factually, the combat should have been called \\"Capture of the sloop Ranger.\\" Background Edward Low was an eighteenth-century pirate from New England known for his extreme cruelty. He personally killed over fifty men and committed several atrocities such as forcing prisoners he captured to cannibalism. By summer of 1723 Low commanded the eighty-ton schooner named Fancy and was the most feared pirate in the Atlantic, so the British dispatched several warships on counter-piracy patrols. Accompanying Fancy was the sloop-of-war under Captain Charles Harris. Fancy was armed with ten guns and had a crew of forty-four, many of whom were forced into service. Ranger was a former French sloop which was captured by Low off Grenada earlier in 1723. Her armament and number of crew is not known. Some accounts cite Low as having commanded the sloop during the encounter with the British post ship under Captain Peter Solgard. The sixth rate mounted a twenty gun armament and a complement of about 120 officers and crewmen.Crooker Capture Low was headed due northwest from the Azores to attack shipping off the British North American colonies. Searching for Low was HMS Greyhound. While cruising off Delaware Bay's mouth, Low and his pirates sighted the man- of-war and gave chase. Low hoisted his Jolly Roger fully suspecting his prey to be an English whaler but when the pirates drew near, HMS Greyhound revealed herself with the raising of her colors and released a broadside into the Fancy as the pirates were preparing for boarding. A 1936 postcard featuring Edward Low Low's schooner took damage and began returning shot while Harris in Ranger maneuvered into firing position. Ranger opened fire briefly with her guns but after only a few minutes both the sloop and schooner chose to flee. A running battle then continued for several hours. Fancy was dismasted by well-placed cannon fire but escaped, while Captain Harris in Ranger was defeated. Wind was not in favor of the pirates, so they used oars to help steer their ships away from the British. The use of oars proved to be pointless when the faster Greyhound came alongside Ranger and the two crews began skirmishing with small arms. Grappling hooks were thrown and the British sailors boarded the sloop. After a few more moments of intense close-quarters combat the pirates surrendered and were taken prisoner. Captain Low's schooner Fancy is said to have carried around ¬£150,000 in gold during the engagement.Crooker Aftermath Thirty-seven white and six black pirates were captured. Twenty- five of these, including the young Harris, were hung near Newport, Rhode Island on June 19, 1723. Captain Solgard became famous in New York City and in England and also received prize money for the sloop he captured which also carried gold during the time of battle. Solgard eventually rose to the rank of admiral in the Royal Navy. Ned Low continued his life of piracy and took several more ships, including a 22-gun French man-of-war. Depictions of his later career give the impressions that he grew more cruel after his defeat, particularly to his English captives. Circumstances of his death are unknown, though he perished sometime in 1724.Crooker References * Category:Naval battles involving pirates Category:Piracy in the Atlantic Ocean Category:Naval battles involving Great Britain Category:Conflicts in 1723 Category:Anti- piracy battles involving the United Kingdom ","title":"Capture of the schooner Fancy"},{"id":"28276382","text":"U.P.

Description The gravitational constant G is arbitrary and is determined by the mean density of matter in the universe. The theory was inspired by the Wheeler‚ÄìFeynman absorber theory for electrodynamics. When Feynman, as a graduate student, lectured on the Wheeler‚ÄìFeynman absorber theory in the weekly physics seminar at Princeton, Albert Einstein was in the audience and stated at question time that he was trying to achieve the same thing for gravity. Incompatible Stephen Hawking showed in 1965 that the theory is incompatible with an expanding universe, because the Wheeler-Feynman advanced solution would diverge. However at that time the accelerating expansion of the universe was not known, which resolves the divergence issue because of the cosmic event horizon. The discovery of the accelerated expansion is fairly recent and it earned the Nobel prize in 2011. Comparison to Einstein's General Relativity The Hoyle-Narlikar theory reduces to Einstein's general relativity in the limit of a smooth fluid model of particle distribution constant in time and space. Hoyle-Narlikar's theory is consistent with some cosmological tests. Hypothesis Unlike the standard cosmological model, the quasi steady state hypothesis implies the universe is eternal. According to Narlikar, multiple mini bangs would occur at the center of quasars, with various creation fields (or C-field) continuously generating matter out of empty space due to local concentration of negative energy that would also prevent violation of conservation laws, in order to keep the mass density constant as the universe expands. The low-temperature cosmic background radiation would not originate from the Big Bang but from metallic dust made from supernovae, radiating the energy of stars. Challenge However, the quasi steady-state hypothesis is challenged by observation as it does not fit into WMAP data. If the C-field is not used, ignoring the hypothesis regarding mass creation, the theory is no longer steady state and agrees with WMAP data, as developed in the gravitational absorber theory.

It is well known for causing urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, an itchy, irritating, and sometimes painful rash, in most people who touch it. The rash is caused by urushiol, a clear liquid compound in the plant's sap. The plant is variable in its appearance and habit, and despite its common name, it is not a true ivy (Hedera), but rather a member of the cashew and pistachio family (Anacardiaceae). T. radicans is commonly eaten by many animals, and the seeds are consumed by birds, but poison ivy is most often thought of as an unwelcome weed. Poison ivy was formerly treated as a single species, Toxicodendron radicans, but is now generally treated as a complex of three separate species: Toxicodendron radicans (eastern poison ivy), Toxicodendron rydbergii (western poison ivy) and Toxicodendron orientale (Asian poison ivy). Description Poison ivy is characterized by leaves each containing three leaflets, hence the common expression \\"leaves of three, let it be\\". Poison ivy is a low shrub or tall vine with small flowers, developing whitish fruits in fall. File:Poison ivy vine.jpgT. radicans vine with typical reddish \\"hairs\\": Like the leaves, the vines are poisonous to humans.

Taxonomy Three species of poison ivy are now generally recognised, which are sometimes considered subspecies of Toxicodendron radicans: * Toxicodendron orientale (Asian poison ivy), found in East Asia. * Toxicodendron radicans (eastern poison ivy), found throughout eastern Canada and the United States, Mexico and Central America, Bermuda and the Bahamas. * Toxicodendron rydbergii (western poison ivy), found throughout Canada and much of the United States excepting the southeast.  Health effects  A video describing the effects of poison ivy on the body Blisters from contact with poison ivy Urushiol-induced contact dermatitis is the allergic reaction caused by poison ivy. In extreme cases, a reaction can progress to anaphylaxis. Around 15 to 25 percent of people have no allergic reaction to urushiol, but most people have a greater reaction with repeated or more concentrated exposure. Typically, the rash from the urushiol oil lasts about five to twelve days, but in extreme cases it can last a month or more. Over 350,000 people are affected by urushiol annually in the United States. The pentadecyl catechols of the oleoresin within the sap of poison ivy and related plants causes the allergic reaction; the plants produce a mixture of pentadecylcatechols, which collectively is called urushiol. After injury, the sap leaks to the surface of the plant where the urushiol becomes a blackish lacquer after contact with oxygen. Urushiol binds to the skin on contact, where it causes severe itching that develops into reddish inflammation or uncoloured bumps, and then blistering. These lesions may be treated with Calamine lotion, Burow's solution compresses, dedicated commercial poison ivy itch creams, or baths to relieve discomfort,Wilson, W. H. & Lowdermilk, P. (2006). Maternal Child Nursing Care (3rd edition). St. Louis: Mosby Elsevier. though recent studies have shown some traditional medicines to be ineffective. Over-the-counter products to ease itching‚Äîor simply oatmeal baths and baking soda‚Äîare now recommended by dermatologists for the treatment of poison ivy. A plant-based remedy cited to counter urushiol-induced contact dermatitis is jewelweed, though jewelweed extracts had no positive effect in clinical studies. Others argue that prevention of lesions is easy if one practices effective washing, using plain soap, scrubbing with a washcloth, and rinsing three times within 2‚Äì8 hours of exposure. The oozing fluids released by scratching blisters do not spread the poison. The fluid in the blisters is produced by the body and it is not urushiol itself. The appearance of a spreading rash indicates that some areas received more of the poison and reacted sooner than other areas or that contamination is still occurring from contact with objects to which the original poison was spread. Those affected can unknowingly spread the urushiol inside the house, on phones, door knobs, couches, counters, desks, and so on, thus in fact repeatedly coming into contact with poison ivy and extending the length of time of the rash. If this has happened, wipe down the surfaces with bleach or a commercial urushiol removal agent. The blisters and oozing result from blood vessels that develop gaps and leak fluid through the skin; if the skin is cooled, the vessels constrict and leak less. If plant material with urushiol is burned and the smoke then inhaled, this rash will appear on the lining of the lungs, causing extreme pain and possibly fatal respiratory difficulty. If poison ivy is eaten, the mucus lining of the mouth and digestive tract can be damaged. An urushiol rash usually develops within a week of exposure and can last 1‚Äì4 weeks, depending on severity and treatment. In rare cases, urushiol reactions may require hospitalization. Urushiol oil can remain active for several years, so handling dead leaves or vines can cause a reaction. In addition, oil transferred from the plant to other objects (such as pet fur) can cause the rash if it comes into contact with the skin. Clothing, tools, and other objects that have been exposed to oil should be washed to prevent further reactions. People who are sensitive to urushiol can also experience a similar rash from mangoes. Mangoes are in the same family (Anacardiaceae) as poison ivy; the sap of the mango tree and skin of mangoes has a chemical compound similar to urushiol. A related allergenic compound is present in the raw shells of cashews. Similar reactions have been reported occasionally from contact with the related Fragrant Sumac (Rhus aromatica) and Japanese lacquer tree. These other plants are also in the family Anacardiaceae. = Treatment = Immediate washing with soap and cold water or rubbing alcohol may help prevent a reaction. During a reaction, Calamine lotion or diphenhydramine may help mitigate symptoms. Corticosteroids, either applied to the skin or taken by mouth, may be appropriate in extreme cases. An astringent containing aluminum acetate (such as Burow's solution) may also provide relief and soothe the uncomfortable symptoms of the rash.

Built between 1576 and 1579, it deteriorated in the 17th century. Its ruins are a tourist attraction and frequently the site of cultural events. Geography Landskron is southeast of the junction of autobahn 20 and federal route B 199, south of the village Janow (part of the Neuendorf B municipality) and west of the village Rehberg (part of the Spantekow municipality). To the south is the Gro√üer Landgraben valley, marking the border between Mecklenburg and Pomerania. Made of boulders and bricks, it is situated on an elevation of glacial till surrounded by swampy meadows., citing Construction, buildings Construction was started in 1576 by Ulrich II von Schwerin, member of one of the oldest Pomeranian noble houses. The von Schwerin family was divided in about 24 branches in the 17th century, whose members lived in Pomerania, Mecklenburg, Brandenburg, Poland and Sweden. Ulrich was the fifth son of another Ulrich von Schwerin, Gro√ühofmeister at the Pomeranian ducal court. He financed the building, which cost about 40,000 gulden, from pay received for military service for the duke of Mecklenburg. The castle was designed as a Renaissance style water castle. (in English) (in Polish) The rectangular main building, a keep about long and wide with three upper stories and a basement, was secured by four round towers attached to its edges, a wall and a moat. One of the keep's towers (Hungerturm) was used as a dungeon to incarcerate abducted people held for ransom. Attached to the keep's eastern front was the entrance building (Vorschlo√ü), about long and wide. In front of the entrance to the keep, which could be reached by a drawbridge, laid the courtyard (Vorburg), and both the keep and the courtyard were surrounded by an outer wall and another moat. In the west, the outer wall was immediately adjacent to the inner moat and comprised five small bastions. The castle was entered through a gatehouse in the northern outer wall, comprising a guardhouse west of the gateway that led to the courtyard, and the stables in its eastern part, where also a well was located. A second drawbridge, made from copper according to legend, spanned the outer moat in front of the gatehouse. Two other separate buildings stood on the courtyard - a chapel to the south and a kitchen to the east. The castle was finished in 1579. Name The initial and still most widely used name of the castle was Landskron (\\"Land's Crown\\"). Legend tells that the name was frowned upon by the Pomeranian duke, who pressured Ulrich to rename it Lanzkron (\\"Lance's Crown\\"), which is also in use as an alternative name. Some locals believe that the duke advocated for this name change because of the birth last name of Eli the Prophet, which was Lanzkron. Noble owners and deterioration The date of Ulrich von Schwerin's death is unknown. Landskron was inherited by one of his sons, Georg Ernst, who later passed it to his son Ulrich Wigand. The castle deteriorated due to the impact of the Thirty Years' War, during which the villages around Landskron were burned down, and mismanagement. When Georg Ernst died in 1651, Landskron was inherited by his daughter Anna, who married the Swedish noble von Anrieppe (see Swedish Pomerania). Their daughter Agnes von Anrieppe married J√ºrgen von Pentz, who soon abandoned Landskron and in 1699 sold it to Philipp von Schwerin, a nephew of Otto von Schwerin, advisor of the Brandenburgian elector, for 13,000 thalers. Philipp von Schwerin did not rebuild the castle, which had further deteriorated during the Scanian War, but moved his residence to nearby Rehberg. According to local folklore, the nobles at Landskron and the neighboring castles Conerow, Klempenow and Spantekow frequently engaged as robber barons holding up transports between the towns Anklam, Demmin, Friedland, Jarmen and Teterow., citing Legend tells that they used golden horns to communicate with each other, allegedly confiscated from \\"Turkish\\" guards in the age of Barbarossa. Recent history The ruins of the castle have attracted tourists since the 19th century. In 1852, a tavern was built on the ruins of the kitchen building in the courtyard. This building was occupied until the 1960s, but subsequently demolished. Today, it is a tourist attraction and used as a site for concerts and other events.

A feature length telemovie about his life by Underbelly Productions, starring Sullivan Stapleton in the title role, aired in 2011 in Australia and other territories. His writing and documentary career as an investigative journalist has taken him around the world. Police career The major phase of McLaren's real life police career took place during the 1980s and 1990s. McLaren rose through the police ranks rapidly and when asked to join an elite covert surveillance unit, he began spying on drug importers and the ringleaders of organised crime, before going undercover and organising covert stings. As a member of some of the most high-profile task forces in Australia, McLaren, as a suit and tie detective, worked on the Walsh Street murders of police constables Steven Tynan and Damian Eyre,John Sylvester Retrieved 6 August 2010 the Mr Cruel child rapes and the murder of thirteen-year-old Karmein Chan,Liz Porter Retrieved 6 August 2010 and the bombing of the Adelaide NCA police headquarters where he was task force leader.

Eleven Mafia bosses received sentences of up to 13 years each for major drug trafficking and racketeering. He also went undercover for another year to gain evidence on the Mafia responsible for the NCA bombing. Six mafia were jailed. He ended his police career as a permanent lecturer at the detective training school, his subject was 'crime scene management' and 'field investigations'. After leaving police work, he developed his interest in Italian style gourmet food and wine, designing the Italian villa 'Villa Gusto' in the countryside in north-east Victoria, Australia.villagusto Retrieved 6 August 2010https://www.goodfood.com.au/eat-out/news/sold-villa- gusto-bought-by-melbourne-couple-20130503-2ixko Writing career It was during 2005 that Colin discovered that he could write.

McLaren's first book, Infiltration, is the true story of his efforts as a suit and tie detective and the undercover agent who infiltrated the Mafia.ebroadcast.com Retrieved 6 August 2010 McLaren followed this up with On the Run, a novel that details the exploits of Cole Goodwin, McLaren's real- life Mafia alias, which has been adapted to a screenplay. The story picks up with the Mafia sending a hit-man after Cole and his undercover girlfriend, Jude. Cole escapes a hit and goes 'on the run' with the assassin in pursuit; through South America, New York and eventually throughout Italy. The plot follows a massive drug importation as well and culminates with a face-off between the assassin and Cole, in the Mafia-controlled mountains of southern Italy.

He then published his fifth book, JFK: The Smoking Gun, concerning the assassination of John F. Kennedy, in November 2013. McLaren decided to approach the assassination of Kennedy as a cold case investigation.I carried the book in my cabin luggage when I winged my way homeward. By the time I arrived in Australia I had read it again and was charged with a desire to undertake a cold-case forensic study into the killing of the 35th President of the United States.

After more than four years of work, made far quicker and easier by the availability of documents such as the Warren Commission report and testimony as searchable files, McLaren found lost testimonies of dozens of witnesses, which told a different story to the Warren Commission outcome. He published his book both in USA and Australia. The book is in print and also available for kindle. From 2016 to 2018, along with psychologist and documentary maker Eve Ash, McLaren researched the fascinating case of the murder of Bob Chappell in Hobart Tasmania, where Susan Neill-Fraser was convicted of killing her de facto husband, on their yacht. For two years, McLaren spoke to hundreds of people, witnesses and police and produced a book called Southern Justice, to be released in 2019. It details an alternative view into the murder and shows that other persons may have been involved and that Neill-Fraser may well be innocent. His theory has seen him called to give evidence at the Supreme Court, in early 2019. McLaren's current writing project is about the Sicilian mafia. He has been based in Italy since early 2018 and his book is expected to be published in 2020. TV series and episodes McLaren's police career has been the focus of various television documentaries, and the Underbelly Files: Infiltration telemovie series screened on Channel 9. McLaren is a technical advisor for many TV series and films in the crime genre, among them the Screentime Films trilogy of Tell them Lucifer was Here, The Man that Got Away and Infiltration. Also the TV series Squizzy about Squizzy Taylor, a gangster from the 1920s, for which McLaren wrote storyline material. McLaren also contributed to Killing Time, the television mini-series based on once corrupt lawyer Andrew Fraser's life, produced by FremantleMedia, TV1 and Film Victoria. McLaren has narrated episodes on Crimes That Shocked Australia and many other one-hour TV episodes about crime families, gangs and his knowledge of them. He also was a key expert on a US television show on assassinations called Inside the Evidence which was headed by American anchorman Bill Kurtis. It aired on Reelz TV channel in the U.S. This was followed by a 90-minute documentary of his findings in JFK:The Smoking Gun. The documentary aired on Australian and American television.

A one-hour abridged version of this documentary aired in the United Kingdom, entitled JFK's Secret Killer: The Evidence. In the television special, McLaren argues that the truth was covered-up to hide impropriety on the part of Secret Service agents. Throughout 2016 McLaren, in conjunction with Bedlam Productions of London, produced the 2-hour documentary Princess Diana's Death - Mystery Solved. The documentary aired globally on 10 July 2016. The documentary relies on forensic evidence gathered by McLaren when he visited the original crime scene in Paris on 31 August 1997. (McLaren had previously been a lecturer at the Australian-based Detective Training School specializing in crime scene management and procedures. He used these skills during the Diana special.) McLaren's documentary indicates that both the French and English investigations into the death of Diana were flawed. McLaren interviews many of those involved in the investigation, French police and paparazzi included, as well as crucial witnesses, and concludes that a cover-up existed. Through 2018 Colin McLaren - with English film director Tim Conrad - created a six-part TV series; \\"Mafia Killers with Colin McLaren\\" for Reelz TV. Each episode examines a notorious mobster who murdered his way to the top, to take control of a New York City Mafia family, before they themselves met death or lengthy jail terms. The six mafia bosses are: Sammy 'The Bull' Gravano, 'Teflon' John Gotti, Henry Hill, Vinnie 'The Chin' Gigante, Anthony 'Gaspipe' Casso and 'The Snake' Persico. During the shows Colin shares personal stories as an undercover agent in organized crime families, giving viewers firsthand accounts of his experiences. McLaren followed this series by appearing in another six-part TV series 'Undercurrent', on Australia's Channel Seven network, aired in 2019. His role was as on-screen narrator and crime expert as the TV series followed him - identifying blunders by police in a murder investigation. During the series McLaren was adamant that the Tasmania police wrongly charged the victim's wife - Sue Neill-Fraser, concluding that the murder was the work of a gang of violent thieves stealing from yachts, who broke into the Four Winds yacht, only to disturb the owner who was sleeping. A violent fight occurred and the owner was murdered. McLaren secured admissions from one of the gang members as well as highlighting overwhelming forensic evidence; and discovered many new witnesses who were previously ignored. As a result, McLaren was called to give evidence at the Supreme Court. Subsequently, the judge allowed Sue Neill- Fraser to appeal her conviction. Currently McLaren is in New York City working on a recurring podcast series with Endeavour Audio on famous deaths that have attracted global fascination. Thus far he has broadcast a 12 part series on the plane crash death of JFK Junior and also the tragic car crash death of Lady Diana. In between his TV work McLaren remains strongly focused on writing his Italian Mafia book: a true crime history that has never been attempted before, due to the complexities of the subject matter. He has been given full access to the historical records on the mafia, housed in many of the state archives in Italy. The book is due out in 2021.

Griffith was the second son of John Griffith and his wife Elizabeth Bulkeley, daughter of Robert Bulkeley, 2nd Viscount Bulkeley. He is numbered as the fifth of that name in the Griffith family of the Cefn Amwlch estate, Penllech, now in Gwynedd.Welsh Biography Online He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 8 June 1703, aged 15. He succeeded to the estate of his elder brother William in March 1715. Griffith was returned as Whig Member of Parliament for Caernarvonshire in succession to his brother at a by-election on 27 April 1715. He was returned unopposed at the general elections of 1722, 1727 and 1734. He voted for the septennial bill in 1716. During the Sunderland Administration from 1717 to 1720, he may have joined the Whig Opposition like his electoral ally, Thomas Wynn. He consistently supported the Government during Walpole's Administration. Griffith married Ann Lloyd, daughter of Pierce Lloyd of Lligwy and Llanidan under a settlement dated 18 June 1718 and had one son. His son was still a minor when Griffith died on 6 June 1739, and this ended his family's representation of the county in Parliament.

The battle took place around modern Turaida, Latvia.  Battle  By summer of 1211, a larger military plan had been made by Estonian counties whose objective was to capture the stronghold held by Caupo of Turaida and thereafter attack Riga. Estonian troops from the mainland and the Oeselian fleet arrived accordingly on an appointed date at the stronghold of Turaida. The stronghold was surrounded and the attack began. The besiegers promised to keep attacking until they either took the stronghold or the Livs inside agreed to join the Estonians for the attack on Riga. Soon after, a large Crusader reinforcement army arrived from Riga with whom a fierce battle began. The Livonian and German crossbowmen from the stronghold also charged out to join the attack. The Estonian forces were caught between two enemy forces, which made them fall back. They regrouped on a hill between the stronghold and the Gauja river. The battle lasted from morning to night, and eventually the Estonians were forced to surrender and agree to being baptized. At night, however, they secretly tried to escape to the sea along the Gauja using their ships. Unfortunately for them, the Germans had built a bridge with towers on the river, where they fired upon the fleeing Estonians with spears and arrows. The next night the Oeselians left their ships and broke away using the roads on the mainland. The Estonian losses were heavy, which was further elaborated in the Chronicle of Livonia. Approximately 2,000 were killed with nearly the same amount of captured horses and over 300 ships captured as well. These are most likely exaggerations.

He is the former administrator of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). Nilo joined the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) in March 1984 as a meteorologist. He was appointed as PAGASA director in November 2007 by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. On August 6, 2010, the weather forecaster was relieved of his post as administrator of PAGASA by President Benigno Aquino III. The former PAGASA chief had been criticized repeatedly for supposed errors in storm predictions by the agency. According to Aquino, Nilo was fired due to inaccurate predictions of typhoon, particularly during the rush of Typhoon Basyang (international codename: Conson). The new Agency executive was named by Secretary of Science and Technology Mario Montejo, who eventually appointed Graciano Yumul in the position. After such events, the meteorologist was reassigned to another office at the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) where PAGASA is one of the attached agencies. Biography Nilo entered PAGASA in March 1984 as a meteorologist. The metereologist was appointed as PAGASA director in November 2007 by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. =Typhoon Conson= In July 2010, the Philippines were hit by Typhoon Basyang (international codename: Conson), the second tropical cyclone during the 2010 Pacific typhoon season to impact the nation. Conson was poorly forecast by PAGASA. From July 12 to 13, Conson was forecast to hit Aurora and Isabela provinces. But, at PST (1500 UTC) on July 13 PAGASA changed its forecast from hitting Aurora and Isabela provinces, to Quezon province, Metro Manila and southern Luzon provinces. However, residents living in those areas were not advised that the typhoon would hit their area and they also were not informed that public storm signal number 2 was raised. With this, severe damage ensued in the said areas. Later that same day, President Benigno Aquino III reprimanded PAGASA for failing to predict that Conson would pass over Manila. As a result, Aquino criticized PAGASA for not warning the residents of Metro Manila about the strong tropical storm that struck the nation's capital. However, according to Dr. Nilo and PAGASA, the agency didn't have adequate equipment to \\"accurately\\" predict a movement of a storm and the weather forecasting instruments were too old and needed to be upgraded.

The parish was partly within the City of London and partly in the County of Middlesex. Each part operated as a separate parish for civil administration with its own local government, but it was a single parish for ecclesiastical purposes. The part in Middlesex was sometimes known as East Smithfield. It was a heavily built-upon parish with a high population density. Within the City The section of the parish in the City of London was in the Portsoken ward. Following the enactment of the London Government Act 1899, the part of the parish of Whitechapel that was within the City of London was transferred to St Botolph without Aldgate in 1900. The City of London section of the parish was abolished in 1907 when the City of London civil parish was created. Outside the City Civil parish administration was in the hands of the vestry until 1855 when the parish was grouped into the Whitechapel District and the parish elected six members to Whitechapel District Board of Works. The parish was transferred from the County of Middlesex to the County of London in 1889. In 1895 it absorbed the civil parishes of St Katherine by the Tower and Old Tower Without. In 1901 it absorbed the civil parish of the Tower of London. It became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney in 1900 and the local authority became Stepney Borough Council.

It has smooth bark, large triangular to more or less round adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and conical to hemispherical fruit.foliage and bark Description Eucalyptus bigalerita is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. The bark is smooth on the trunk and branches, pale orange to creamy-pink when newly exposed, fading to grey before it is shed. Leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are arranged alternately, dull greyish green, triangular to heart-shaped, long, wide and have a petiole. Adult leaves are triangular to more or less round, mostly long, wide on a petiole long and usually the same glossy green on both sides. The leaves are often shed during the drier months prior to the wet season. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven on a peduncle usually long, the individual flowers either sessile or on a pedicel up to long. The mature flower buds are more or less spherical, long, wide with a rounded to shortly beaked operculum. Flowering occurs between June and September and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, conical to hemispherical capsule long, wide on a pedicel up to long. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus bigalerita was first formally described in 1859 by Ferdinand von Mueller and the description was published in the Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society, Botany. The specific epithet (bigalerita) is derived from the Latin words bi meaning \\"two\\" or \\"double\\" and galeritus meaning \\"wearing a hood\\" referring to the double operculum of the flowers of this species - Mueller emphasised \\"operculo duplici\\" in his description. Eucalyptus bigalerita belongs to a small group of species closely related to the red gums. Other members include E. alba, E. platyphylla, E. tintinnans, E. apodophylla and E. houseana. Within the group E. bigalerita is most closely related to E. platyphylla and E. tintinnans and is only weakly separated from both. Distribution and habitat The northern salmon gum is found in the north of Western Australia and the Northern Territory. In Western Australia it occurs along watercourses and low-lying flats in the Kimberley region where it grows in alluvium or sandy soils. In the Northern Territory it is found across the Top End, including the Tiwi Islands, the Cobourg Peninsula and as far south as Daly Waters. Conservation Eucalyptus bigalerita is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture The plant is easily propagated from seed which germinates readily.

Inspired by Marco Girolamo Vida's Scacchia Ludus, it is a narrative poetry work that describes a game of chess between two men, Fiedor and Borzuj, who fight for the right to marry Anna, princess of Denmark. The poem anthropomorphises the pieces, presenting the game as a battle between two armies, in a style reminiscent of battle scenes in the works of Homer and Virgil. In 1912, Alexander Wagner reconstructed the game described in the poem, while Yuri Averbakh found that it has three possible endings in 1967. Background During his visit to the Italian lands in 1558‚Äì59, Jan Kochanowski encountered Scacchia Ludus, a poem by Marco Girolamo Vida, which describes a game of chess played on Mount Olympus between Apollo and Mercury.Litmanowicz (1974), p. 14 It is possible that Kochanowski also met Vida himself.Litmanowicz (1974), p. 19 Inspired by Scacchia Ludus, Kochanowski decided to create his own poem with a chess game as the main topic. Until the second half of the 19th century, Chess was often thought to be only a paraphrase of Vida's poem, rather than an independent work. In his 1856 essay Chess in Poland (), historian Maurycy Dzieduszycki proved that Kochanowski's poem, while inspired by Scacchia Ludus, is dependent on it only to a small extent and should be considered a fully separate work of art. Chess is dedicated to \\"Jan Krzysztof, count of Tarn√≥w, castellan of Wojnicz.\\" Plot Tarses, the king of Denmark, has a daughter named Anna. Of the many foreigners who wanted to marry her, two men, Fiedor and Borzuj, stood out as the most interested. After the two men proclaim that they want to have a duel, Tarses proposes a game of chess instead. Fiedor and Borzuj learn the rules and after spending some time training, meet in Tarses' palace for the game. Borzuj is chosen to play white and Fiedor black. The game, described as a battle of anthropomorphised pieces starts, comprising the biggest part of the poem. Kochanowski uses the names of the pieces (which are often different from their equivalents in modern Polish) in literal sense, describing the game as a war between infantry soldiers (pawns), knights, bow-wielding priests (bishops), war elephants (rooks), queens and kings. The play is described metaphorically: Captures are referred to as killings, the pieces are said to have emotions. At one point, Borzuj attempts to \\"resurrect\\" a dead knight, i.e. illegally put a captured piece on the board. When both queens are killed, the kings are said to look for new wives among their servants ‚Äì a metaphor of pawn promotion. The play advances into the endgame and Borzuj indeed promotes and gets a new queen. The match progresses to a position which seems to end with white inevitably mating in its next move (see the diagram). Fiedor sees no way to evade his loss and makes no move, despite urging comments from Borzuj and advice to resign from members of Tarses' court who watch the game. The sun sets with black still not making any move and it is decided that the players will stop the game for the night, to resume on the following day. Later Anna, who would rather marry Fiedor, visits the room with the chessboard, guarded for the night. She also initially believes that there is no way to evade white's mate, but subsequently notices a chance for black. Anna loudly expresses an enigmatic opinion: That knights know how to fight, priests are good at giving advice, infantry doesn't hesitate to walk forward and that it's no loss to change a dear thing for someone beloved.\\"Dobry Rycerz jest od zwady \\\\ Popu te≈º nie≈∫le zachowaƒá od rady; \\\\ Daƒá za mi≈Çego wdziƒôcznƒÖ rzecz nie szkodzi, \\\\ Piechota przedsiƒô jako ≈ºywo chodzi\\". Before leaving, the princess turns the black rook to the side. The following day, hopeless Fiedor and content Borzuj meet to finish their game. Fiedor asks the guards about the turned rook and learns about Anna's visit and her words. Borzuj pays no attention, believing she was referring to the real-life knights and priests. Fiedor starts to think deeply and understands that the princess' words are a message with a hidden hint for him: that he should not use the knight and the bishop, but sacrifice the most valuable piece his still has, the rook; before ending the game using the pawns. To get the attention of his spectators, Fiedor proclaims that he will admit loss if he won't be able to mate his opponent in the next three moves. To Borzuj's surprise, black sacrifices the rook and mates with two pawns. Fiedor marries Anna, while Borzuj leaves, declining an invitation to the wedding. Critical analysis =Artistic= Chess is written in eleven-syllable verse. It was one of the first Polish language works created by Kochanowski, who was earlier mostly writing elegies and epigrams in Latin. According to prof. Edmund Kotarski of the Gda≈Ñsk University, Chess resembles a short story in the parts dealing with the human characters, while the battle of the chess pieces is a parody of heroic epos of Homer and Virgil, \\"following its style while presenting a plot which clearly was not monumental or grand\\", so that the \\"clash between seriousness and humour\\" results in humorous effects. The poem was described as more humane that Scacchia Ludus which inspired it,Krzy≈ºanowski (1966) as instead of mythological gods, Kochanowski tells a story of two young men fighting for their future. =Chess= Chess theoretician W≈Çadys≈Çaw Litmanowicz considers Borzuj and Fiedor's playing skills as not extraordinary, but notices that the game's theory was much less advanced in Kochanowski's times compared to the modern day.Litmanowicz (1974), p. 26 The ending combination is a variation of the well-known Dilaram problem. Anna's advice was most likely easily understood by the contemporary readers. Reconstruction =Background= In 1912, the Szachista Polski () magazine announced a contest to reconstruct the game described in Kochanowski's poem. It ended with only one entry sent ‚Äì created by Alexander Wagner, who was one of the magazine's employees.Litmanowicz (1974), p. 22 Wagner submitted his reconstruction under the pseudonym of \\"Wanda Reger Nelska\\" (an anagram of his name), so that his colleagues wouldn't be biased in judging the entries. Most of the commentary in Wagner's work are simply quotations from the poem. =Wagner's reconstruction= 1\\\\. d4 d5 2. c3 e5 3. e3 a5 4. b3 h6 5. a3 Na6 6. h3 Bf5 7.

It has rough bark on the trunk, smooth olive to brownish bark above, lance-shaped adult leaves, flowers buds in groups of between seven and eleven, white flowers and conical fruit.flower budsfruit Description Eucalyptus loxophleba is a mallee or a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. The trunk has a diameter of about of and varying amounts, depending on subspecies, of rough fibrous-flaky or smooth bark on the trunk and smooth grey-brown over copper bark above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have more or less triangular, egg-shaped or almost round glaucous leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, the same glossy, dark green on both sides, long and wide tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven, nine or eleven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to pear shaped, long and wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering has been observed in most months and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, conical capsule long and wide with the valves below rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus loxophleba was first formally described in 1867 by George Bentham in Volume 3 of Flora Australiensis. In 1903 William Fitzgerald changed the name to Eucalyptus foecunda var. loxophleba, but the name is not accepted by the Australian Plant Census.Chippendale, G.M. in George, A.S. (ed.) (1988), Eucalyptus. Flora of Australia 19: 238, 240 Hybrids with E. absita and E. wandoo have been recorded. The specific epithet (loxophleba) is derived from the Greek meaning \\"cross-wise\\" and meaning \\"a vein\\". Noongar peoples know the tree as daarwet, goatta, twotta or yandee, the latter is noted as in popular use.APNI, citing Robson, Peter J. (1993), Checklist of Australian Trees: alphabetical listings of common and scientific names: In 1972, Ian Brooker described the subspecies gratiae and loxophleba and in 1992 Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill described subspecies lissophloia and supralaevis.

Distribution and habitat Woodlands containing E. loxophleba is found across a broad swathe of Western Australia from the Mid West south through the Wheatbelt and east into the Goldfields-Esperance region of the state. It is found among rocky outcrops and on flats, rises, slopes, hilltops, near salt lakes and along drainage lines. The species will grow in a range of soil types such as red-brown or rocky loam, in sands or sandy clays over laterite, dolerite or granite. The tree was recorded as common around the early settlement of York, whence the vernacular \\"York gum\\" is derived, and areas near Bolgart, Toodyay, Northam and from Narrogin to Broomehill. Subspecies gratiae occurs between Dumbleyung and Lake King, subspecies loxophleba from near Moora to Bruce Rock and Chillinup on the Pallinup River, subspecies lissophloia further inland between Bencubbin, Merredin, Lake Minigwal, Coonana and Peak Charles and subspecies supralaevis in more northern areas between the Murchison River, Dongara, Lake Barlee, the Die Hardy Range and Wongan Hills. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as \\"not threatened\\" in Western Australia by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Uses Natural populations of E. loxophleba grows in areas affected by dryland salinity. All four subspecies could possibly be used in the remediation of dryland salinity, but subspecies lissophloia has been more widely cultivated because of its potential as an oil mallee. This subspecies has also been introduced to the eastern States in planting for carbon sequestration. Historically, the wood of subspecies loxophleba was used by wheelwrights and similar workers. The heartwood of the tree is yellow-brown, hard and tough with an interlocked grain. The wood has a green density of about 1185 kg/m3 and an air-dried density about 1060 kg/m3.

The singular homology and cohomology groups of a closed, orientable manifold are related by Poincar√© duality. Poincar√© duality is an isomorphism between homology and cohomology groups. A chain complex is called a Poincar√© complex if its homology groups and cohomology groups have the abstract properties of Poincar√© duality. A Poincar√© space is a topological space whose singular chain complex is a Poincar√© complex. These are used in surgery theory to analyze manifold algebraically. Definition Let C = \\\\\\\\{C_i\\\\\\\\} be a chain complex of abelian groups, and assume that the homology groups of C are finitely generated. Assume that there exists a map \\\\Delta\\\\colon C\\\\to C\\\\otimes C, called a chain-diagonal, with the property that (\\\\varepsilon \\\\otimes 1)\\\\Delta = (1\\\\otimes \\\\varepsilon)\\\\Delta. Here the map \\\\varepsilon\\\\colon C_0\\\\to \\\\mathbb{Z} denotes the ring homomorphism known as the augmentation map, which is defined as follows: if n_1\\\\sigma_1 + \\\\cdots + n_k\\\\sigma_k\\\\in C_0, then \\\\varepsilon(n_1\\\\sigma_1 + \\\\cdots + n_k\\\\sigma_k) = n_1+ \\\\cdots + n_k\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}. Using the diagonal as defined above, we are able to form pairings, namely: :\\\\rho \\\\colon H^k(C)\\\\otimes H_n(C) \\\\to H_{n-k}(C), \\\\ \\\\text{where} \\\\ \\\\ \\\\rho(x\\\\otimes y) = x \\\\frown y, where \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frown denotes the cap product. A chain complex C is called geometric if a chain-homotopy exists between \\\\Delta and \\\\tau\\\\Delta, where \\\\tau \\\\colon C\\\\otimes C\\\\to C\\\\otimes C is the transposition/flip given by \\\\tau (a\\\\otimes b) = b\\\\otimes a. A geometric chain complex is called an algebraic Poincar√© complex, of dimension n, if there exists an infinite-ordered element of the n-dimensional homology group, say \\\\mu \\\\in H_n(C), such that the maps given by : (\\\\frown\\\\mu) \\\\colon H^k(C) \\\\to H_{n-k}(C) are group isomorphisms for all 0 \\\\le k \\\\le n. These isomorphisms are the isomorphisms of Poincar√© duality.

PSA Rennes was acquired by the PSA Group in 1976 when Peugeot took a majority stake in the Citro√´n company which had built the plant. PSA Rennes is the largest private employer in the Rennes conurbation, with approximately 6,900 people as of 2009. Location and site The plant is located to the south-west of Rennes in the commune of Chartres- de-Bretagne, just beyond the Rennes city limits on a large site at Rennes-la- Janais, across the road from the city's airport. The completion in 2010 of a ‚Ç¨50 million investment in new model production facilities will leave the total covered factory area at 500,000 m¬≤. By 2008 the area under cover had grown to more than 700,000 m¬≤, but this was to be reduced in order \\"to reduce fixed costs and optimize logistical efficiencies\\". In practice, the site is a large one: where it was cheaper to build a new dedicated assembly hall than to refit an existing one it is likely that some of the older buildings included in the quoted 2008 figure will have been already unused for many years. Before 1999 the company also owned a plant for the manufacture of rubber components on the city's western (Route de Lorient) Industrial Zone and statistics from that period concerning matters such as employment often aggregate the figures for the two plants together. History At the beginning of the 20th century, with France producing more automobiles than any other country, automobile construction was heavily dependent on a handful of traditional craft based skills, and the country's auto-industry, along with most heavy industry in France, was heavily concentrated in the Paris region. Having grown prosperous as a munitions producer during the war, when automobile pioneer Andr√© Citro√´n was ready to start his own manufacturing business, applying revolutionary production techniques which he had seen in development at Ford's Detroit plant, the obvious place to base a new auto-business in France was Paris, which is where Citro√´n's car factory was established in 1919. Forty years later, the production techniques pioneered by Citro√´n had permitted the auto- industry to become one of the most important sectors in the industrialising economy, and auto-production had become massively labour-intensive. The artisanal skills of the Paris carriage maker were no longer of much relevance, however. Commercial success for the 2CV and (more recently) DS models left Citro√´n desperately short of production capacity in their cramped Paris site, and the decision was taken to build a new greenfield plant. The Rennes location was chosen in 1958 on account of its abundant supply of available labour and the low wages in an area where the economy was heavily dependent on the primary sector. Farming in the 1950s was beginning to shed labour fast as more and more agricultural tasks were transferred from men and women to machines. Citro√´n's decision to build their new plant on a Greenfield site in an area still dominated by agriculture mirrored auto-industry developments taking place at this time in Michigan and several adjacent states in the USA. The Rennes-la-Janais plant was opened in 1961 in a ceremony adorned by the dominating presence of the president. Citro√´n products featured prominently in the presidential cortege, but the first cars produced at the Rennes plant were small Ami 6 models rather than the DS favoured for presidential use. The Ami continued in production for ten years, till 1971, having in 1967 been joined on the production line by the Dyane and in 1970 by the GS which launched Citroen into the middle market sector. It was the medium-sized cars which would henceforth dominate the production lines at Rennes while almost all of the old 2 CVs continued to be produced at the company's Paris plant until the late 1980s after which that model's final years' production were increasingly concentrated on a small plant in Portugal. In the 1980s, with Citro√´n's finances subjected by its new owners to a more rigorous cost control r√©gime, financial stability returned. Investment was applied judiciously, however, and employment at the plant peaked at around 14,000 in the 1980s. This was also a period during which the company's Vigo plant in north-west Spain was beginning to move away from exclusive concentration on small cars, reflecting rapidly rising incomes in Spain. This meant that during the 1990s the two plants would find themselves in increasingly direct competition to build the same cars, with the costs of France's generous social benefits, funded by employment taxes, leaving the Rennes plant looking in some respects expensive. One response, as in much of France's manufacturing industry, was increased dependence on new industrial robots for many routine assembly-line tasks. By the first decade of 21st century nevertheless Vigo was producing more cars than Rennes, and the Rennes plant's labour force had more than halved, to approximately 6,900 in 2009. In 2004, after 42 years, the plant produced its ten millionth car. 2004 was also the year when, for the first time, the company produced a Peugeot badged vehicle, the 407 at the Rennes plant, joined in 2009 by the slow selling (and soon to be discontinued) 607. The Peugeot 407 sold very strongly for several years, although demand tailed off quite sharply in 2008 and 2009: both the sales success of this important model, and its more recent decline, have been closely reflected in the level of activity at the plant in recent years. In 2009 production of the Xsara Picasso, hitherto shared between Spain and France, transferred fully to Vigo. In 2010 the plant's output is concentrated on the company's Platform 3 models, being currently the Peugeot 407 and the Citro√´n C5, along with the larger C6. Preparations are well underway to assemble the forthcoming Peugeot 508 at Rennes, with production commencing on a highly automated production line - eventually at the rate of up to 45 vehicles per hour \\\\- after the 2010 summer break. Other reports apparently based on company press releases have suggested a rate of 55 cars per hours for the extensively upgraded new production line. The decision taken at the start of the twenty-first century to focus on C-class cars, at the larger end of the passenger car market, has not served the plant well. The sector has been under attack from luxury automakers such as Audi and BMW while more cost conscious buyers have been switching to smaller family cars in the Golf / Peugeot 308 class. With annual volumes well below 200,000 cars in recent years the manufacturer has been able to lower the factory's break-even volume, however. The site is a large one, and since February 2014 it has accommodated a substantial workshop for the renovation of High-speed trains, staffed by employees on assignment the SNCF from the PSA workforce.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4sRHGRgnag Site layout The site can be divided into four zones, covering respectively administration, logistics (with general support), quality and production. Of these four elements it is, of course, production that uses most of the space, and the production activities are in turn divided between four sections as follows: :‚Ä¢ Stamping: The principal metal components of the body and chassis are stamped into shape using heavy hydraulic presses. :‚Ä¢ Body shop: The panels are welded together using robotic welding machines, and emerge as recognisable car bodies. :‚Ä¢ Paint shop: The painting process, which is also highly automated, involves immersion of each car body in a succession of basins with the final coats being robotically spray painted. :‚Ä¢ Final assembly: Engines and other sub-assemblies from other PSA plants are fitted to the painted bodies along with smaller more specialist component many of them sourced from third party suppliers. It is the coordination of all these elements that forms a major portion of the company's logistics activity. The various parts of the production area are linked by an array of automated conveyors. At the end of the final assembly area the cars are welcomed first to the testing section and then to the dispatch area. More statistics * The site covers 240 hectares. * The site contains 80 buildings. * More than 300,000 vehicles are produced at the plant annually. The plant is claimed to have an annual capacity of 400,000 though annual output has never exceeded 350,000.

This plant, known as the \\"Barre Thomas\\" (plant), is located in an industrial zone (ZI Ouest/Route de Lorient) to the west of Rennes. The plant was sold to an Italian company in 1999, since when its ownership structure has charted a far from simple course:Le blog finance currently \\"Barre Thomas\\" is owned by an investment fund called Silver Point. The plant, which dates originally from 1954, still employs more than 1,600 people (2005) and still sends more than 90% of its output to the PSA Rennes-la-Janais plant.

After early efforts as a composer and novelist, and service in naval intelligence in World War I, he became music critic of The Morning Post from 1925 to 1937, which he combined with teaching singing and working as managing director of the Restaurant Boulestin in London. In 1939 Toye was appointed director of the British Institute of Florence, but the outbreak of World War II forced him to leave Italy in 1940. During the war, he served as director of the Sociedade Brasileira de Cultura Inglesa, Rio de Janeiro. Toye returned to the institute in Florence in 1946. He retired in 1958 but continued to live in Florence for the rest of his life.

The Times wrote of this period of Toye's life: \\"His tastes were Latin as against the generally Teutonic atmosphere of London music, being however an ardent Handelian; he was interested in singing and even gave lessons in the art. He formulated his creed in a book, The Well-Tempered Musician\\", published in 1925. Sir Keith Falkner, Director of the Royal College of Music in London, praised Toye as a teacher of singing: \\"He was a teacher with a fine ear and down-to-earth knowledge\\".The Times, 20 October 1964, p. 15 Toye's love of singing and of Italian music were deployed in his most important book, Giuseppe Verdi: His Life and Music, published in 1931, which for many years remained the standard English authority on its subject. He followed it with a rather lighter treatment of Rossini in Rossini: A Study in Tragi-Comedy in 1934. In addition to his writing, Toye was a frequent broadcaster, delivering regular talks about music on the main BBC station between 1926 and 1931.See, for example, The Times, 5 November 1926, p. 20; 20 February 1928, p. 21; and 2 July 1931, p. 19 From 1933 to 1939, Toye combined his musical work with the post of managing director of the Restaurant Boulestin in Covent Garden, one of the most famous restaurants of its day, with an international reputation.David, p. 172 =Florence and Rio= In 1939 Toye was appointed director of the British Institute of Florence, an institution dedicated to teaching English language and literature to Italians.

In 1946 he resumed the directorship of the British Institute, whose premises and \\"magnificent library\\" had survived the war intact.

The association is a member of the Central Credit Committee governing the banking industry in Germany and a member of the European Banking Federation. The President of the association is Hans-Walter Peters.

Nowadays it is the German Banking Industry Committee. In 1999 it moved to Berlin while the subsidiary Bankverlag (bank publishing company) remained in Cologne: the association also owns an office in Brussels. Legally, the association is an Eingetragener Verein.

Foster, ‚ÄòPeploe, Hanmer William Webb- (1837‚Äì1923)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 3 Oct 2016 In the late 1970s, the parish of Holy Trinity Brompton (HTB) merged with the neighbouring parish of St Paul's, Onslow Square. St Paul's was declared redundant. An attempt by the Diocese of London to sell the building for private redevelopment was thwarted in the early 1980s when local residents joined with churchgoers to save the church. In the late 1980s, the Parochial Church Council requested that the redundancy be overturned which allowed curate Nicky Lee and his wife Sila to plant a congregation there as well as undertake some building structural maintenance work. In 1997, the congregation at St Paul's divided into three, with some going with curate Stuart Lees to plant a church in Fulham; others returning to HTB with Nicky and Sila Lee; and others forming the St Paul's Anglican Fellowship and remaining based at St Paul's with John Peters. This last group left in 2002 to plant into St Mary's, Bryanston Square. During 2007, after plans by HTB to rebuild the 1960s offices were withdrawn following difficulty in getting support from local residents, HTB decided to undertake some renovations and to resume services in the church. St Paul's launched 9am and 6pm services in September 2007 and followed with an 11am service on 20 January 2008 and a 4pm service on 28 September 2009. In December 2009 the upstairs balcony was recommissioned for worship, having previously been used for administrative offices (the office occupants having moved to HTB's nearby office building purchased in 2008).

Water pollution in Canterbury in New Zealand has become a notable environmental issue due in a large part to the burgeoning dairy industry. Water resources are under the jurisdiction of the Canterbury Regional Council (Ecan) under the Resource Management Act (RMA), and water abstraction and use for irrigation requires a resource consent. The municipal water supply for Christchurch, sourced from the aquifers beneath the city, is untreated. This is unusual for a city of its size. Background Due to the rain shadow effect of the Southern Alps the rainfall in Canterbury is lower than many other parts of the country at 500‚Äì700 mm per year. Water from melting snow and ice and from rainfall drain into the predominantly braided rivers on the Canterbury Plains. The rivers recharge the aquifers beneath the plains. The Canterbury Region was traditionally arable and livestock farming but there have been a large number of dairy conversions in the region. In recent years there has been a huge expansion in dairy farming throughout the South Island. Dairy farming requires the intensive use of water and it is placing a high demand on water resources in the Canterbury Region. Issues A water pollution sign on the Waimakariri River in 2004. The rivers and groundwater are being polluted with nitrates and E. coli. Nitrate concentrations in the groundwater are above the drinking water standards in around 7% of monitored wells according to 2017 data from Environment Canterbury. According to Environment Canterbury's 2 017 progress report on the Canterbury Water Management Strategy, 71% of the 224 wells sampled in 2015 showed no increasing or decreasing nitrate trend, 25% of wells showed an increase nitrate trend and 4% showed a decreasing nitrate trend. According to the Ministry for the Environment, 77% of Canterbury rivers and lakes are graded excellent or good for swimming and 4% are graded as poor. Inorganic nutrients, an indication of water quality, are considered to be low but increase closer to the coast. For 2000-2001 28% of tested sites were classed as \\"alert\\" due to the presence of organic pollutants. Water pollution of the two rivers flowing through the city of Christchurch, the Avon and the Heathcote, is of concern. Untreated sewage can flow into the rivers during times of high rainfall. The estuary where the two rivers discharge had received treated water from the sewerage treatment plant that processed the city's sewage. However, a pipeline was constructed to discharge the water into Pegasus Bay. It became operational in 2010. The Central Plains Water scheme is a large-scale proposal for water diversion, damming, reticulation and irrigation over an area of 60,000 ha. A large number of resource consent applications for intensive dairy farming in the Mackenzie Basin attracted opposition due in part to the potential effects on water quality. The resource consents were called in under the RMA by the Minister for the Environment Nick Smith. Cheviot has been on a boil water notice since October 2004. Mitigation The Dairying and Clean Streams Accord was set up by Fonterra and a number of government agencies as a means of reducing nonpoint source pollution. The Accord is criticised for not achieving its goals.* In recent years, Environment Canterbury has introduced stricter environmental requirements for farms with most farms now required to have Farm Environment Plans as well as many farms having nutrient discharge limits on nitrogen losses. Farm Environment Plans require farms to plan and demonstrate they are actively managing environmental practices such as nutrient application, erosion risk, irrigation, dairy effluent and waterway protection (through fencing off waterways in intensively stocked areas and riparian planting). Recent assessments of water quality in Canterbury have indicated that the introduction of these new requirements is helping to improve water quality. Nitrogen, phosphorus, sediment and e.coli are all now improving at more monitored sites than are worsening. Turbidity is the only measure which showed more sites worsening. Prosecutions In recent years prosecutions have been made for causing water pollution: *2009 - Philip Curry was fined $5,000 after pleading guilty to discharging effluent onto land that may have resulted in contaminants entering nearby Barry's Bay Stream. *2009 - Corlette Holdings was fined $10,000 after pleading guilty to two charges of discharging effluent from an irrigator resulted in ponding and a second charge of effluent being discharged, which may have resulted in contaminated water. *2010 - A prosecution against Brook Farms and Mosbro Farms in Ashburton was withdrawn after they agreed to mitigate the effects of the effluent discharge. * In 2012, Springston dairy farm company, White Gold Ltd, was fined a record $90,000 after illegally discharging 45,000 litres of diluted dairy effluent over a three-day period in 2010. The public reported the dairy effluent flowing into waterways that flowed into Lake Ellesmere.

On 30 May 1788 it was reinforced by a contingent of soldiers taken from the r√©giment de Quercy, r√©giment de Septimanie, r√©giment de Nassau, r√©giment de La Marck, r√©giment de Franche- Comt√© and r√©giment des √âv√©ch√©s, all then cavalry units. The hussars played a prominent role as cavalry in the Napoleonic Wars (1803‚Äì1815). As light cavalrymen mounted on fast horses, they would be used to fight skirmish battles and for scouting. Most of the great European powers raised hussar regiments. The armies of France, Austria, Prussia, and Russia had included hussar regiments since the mid-18th century. In the case of Britain, four light dragoon regiments were converted to hussars in 1806‚Äì1807. Hussars gained notoriety in the Grande Arm√©e after the invasion of Egypt. At the Battle of Salalieh in August 1798, brigade commander Antoine Charles Louis de Lasalle fought \\"like a demon\\" and solidified his reputation as a maverick rider upon returning to France and receiving Weapons of Honour. At the ceremony (in a remark often mistakenly attributed to Napoleon), Lasalle quipped \\"Any hussar who isn't dead at age 30 is a layabout.\\" The hussars of Napoleon's army created the tradition of sabrage, the opening of a champagne bottle with a sabre. Moustaches were universally worn by Napoleonic period hussars, the British hussars were the only moustachioed troops in the British Army ‚Äì leading to occasional taunts of \\"foreigner\\" from their brothers-in-arms. French hussars also wore cadenettes, braids of hair hanging to either side of the face, until the practice was officially proscribed when shorter hair became universal. The uniforms worn by Napoleonic hussars were unique to each regiment but all featured the dolman ‚Äì a colourful, braided stable jacket ‚Äì and the pelisse, a short fur-edged jacket which was often worn slung over one shoulder in the style of a cape and fastened with a cord. This garment was extensively adorned with braiding (often gold or silver for officers) and several rows of multiple buttons. On active service the hussar normally wore reinforced breeches which had leather on the inside of the leg to prevent them from wearing due to the extensive time spent in the saddle. On the outside of such breeches, running up the outside was a row of buttons, and sometimes a stripe in a different colour. A shako or fur kolpik was worn as headwear. The colours of dolman, pelisse, and breeches varied greatly by regiment, even within the same army. The French hussar of the Napoleonic period was armed with a brass-hilted sabre, a carbine, and sometimes with a brace of pistols, although these were often unavailable. The British hussar was armed, in addition to his firearms, with the Pattern 1796 light cavalry sabre. A famous military commander in Bonaparte's army who began his military career as a hussar was Marshal Ney, who after being employed as a clerk in an iron works joined the 5th Hussars in 1787. He rose through the ranks of the hussars in the wars of Belgium and the Rhineland (1794‚Äì1798) fighting against the forces of Austria and Prussia before receiving his marshal's baton in 1804 after the Emperor Napoleon's coronation. On the French Revolution, it was numbered as the 5th Hussar Regiment during the army reorganisation of 1 January 1791, as the fifth oldest cavalry unit in the French army, before being promoted to 4th Hussar Regiment in 1793 after the previous holder of that title. In 1814, just before the fall of the First French Empire, it was renamed the r√©giment des hussards de Monsieur, though it resumed the title of 4th Hussar Regiment during the Hundred Days before being disbanded on the Bourbon Restoration which followed. In 1816 the r√©giment des hussards du Nord was formed and in 1825 this unit took the title 4th Hussar Regiment. It survived until 1940, when it was disbanded. On 15 February 1945 a new 4th Hussar Regiment was formed by splitting-off elements of COABC 405. On 30 October 1945 the new unit was disbanded and turned into the 2nd Hussar Regiment. On 15 July 1956 the 4th Hussar Regiment was again recreated, this time from elements of 251e B, before being disbanded again in 1958. It was re-created yet again on 1 April 1959 from elements of 31st Dragoon Regiment, surviving until 1964, when it was disbanded to become the 8th Dragoon Regiment and immediately recreated from elements of 1st African Chasseurs (1er r√©giment de chasseurs d'Afrique) and from the instruction centre of the 6th Dragoon Regiment. This unit was disbanded at Laon, with its colours being entrusted to the GMR/6-4e RH). In 1991 the 4th Hussar Regiment was yet again recreated, becoming the support regiment to the RMD-NE/CMD Metz. In 2000 it took the name of 4th Hussar Squadron Group (4e Groupe d'escadrons de hussards or 4e G.E.H), which it still holds.

Wallison#Writings Hidden in Plain Sight () is a non-fiction book by Juha Suoranta on helping a minor asylum seeker in Finland. The book, based on the author's journal, is about his attempt to protect Ashraf Sahil, and to help him avoid deportation to inhuman conditions. intokustannus.fi Sahil, who as a young child had fled with his family from Afghanistan to Pakistan in the 1990, was first sent to Iran from where he was carried to Greece through Turkey by human smugglers. From there he traveled across Europe to Finland in summer 2008. The Finnish Immigration officials did not grant him a due asylum process but instead imposed a deportation when the author received an e-mail request for help from his sociologist friend in Minneapolis. Suoranta states that he could not tolerate a situation \\"where a young person was about to be sent into an uncertain, perhaps life-threatening, situation. If it was in my power to do something, I had to do something.... Although I did not know what asylum, deportation, irregular immigration, or the Dublin agreement meant, it was necessary to try to do something, search for help, at least. When I found out that there was no organisation, including the church, which could help, I realised that I had a duty.\\" Thus he hid the youngster to his late grandfather's apartment.http://www.ipsnews.net/2010/05/rights-finland-tough-asylum-policy- opposed-by-civil-disobedience/ The book has three storylines or intertwined layers.

And yet in another level the text contains ethical and moral reflections pertaining universal questions of helping another human beings referring, among others, to sociologist Zygmunt Bauman and philosopher Peter Singer, especially his Practical Ethics and The Life You Can Save. Suoranta's ethics in helping and hiding a stranger is as follows: \\"Suffering and death because of the lack of basic needs or protection are unnecessary.

For Ziris Canvas, the displays are connected through customized PlayStation 3s running Ziris View, which are networked and controlled by a web GUI-based management software, Ziris Manage. It's a modular application developed with Java technology.  Product family  The Ziris family currently consists of 3 different product ranges: * Ziris Lite (entry level signage) * Ziris Professional (professional signage) * Ziris Canvas (video wall signage)  Product outline  The software package consists of several modules each playing a different role in the operation of the application * Ziris Create (for content creation and management) * Ziris Manage (for display status & control) * Ziris Transfer / Edge (for content distribution) * Ziris View (for playback of the output) These components are used through the 3 different ranges. Ziris Create allows for a user to add content to a centralised content library and create play lists that are the essence of a Digital Signage system. It has a folder based structure thus allowing the user to categorise and organise their materials within the system. It includes a play list editor that allows positioning of these elements in certain areas of the screen as well as layering the elements on top, or below of each other. Ziris Manage provides a list of all displays & players on a signage network that can be managed by the product, allowing the user to see what is happening on screen and enable them to control the display by switching power, volume or inputs. There are two different distribution modules available going by the name of Ziris Transfer and Edge. The main difference in architecture between the two is the way the content is distributed to the players. Within Ziris Transfer, a server is embedded operating according to the FTP structure, thereby caching files and pushing them out to the players on the network. When using Ziris Edge, the opposite is achieved by using pull technology instead. By making the player contacting the main server at intervals it is possible to broadcast Digital Signage contents to hard to reach places, through intermittent networks or mobile locations. This enables the usage of Digital Signage in public transport or other mobile locations.  Awards  Sony has been awarded with the bronze European POPAI award of 2009 in the category \\"Supports Digital Innovators\\" with the Ziris Canvas product. In 2010 Sony received the \\"Apex Silver\\" award from the DSE organisation for their project at the American Airlines Arena of the Miami Heat.

The Ark was a 400-ton English merchant ship hired in 1633 by Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore to bring roughly 140 English colonists and their equipment and supplies to the new colony and Province of Maryland, one of the original thirteen colonies of British North America on the Atlantic Ocean eastern seaboard. On the historic trans-oceanic voyage from England in late 1633 and early 1634, The Ark was accompanied by the smaller 40-ton pinnace Dove. Maryland expedition On , after several delays, the two ships, Ark and Dove, sailed from the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England. Three days later a storm in the English Channel separated Ark from Dove. When Dove disappeared from view, she was flying distress lanterns, and those aboard Ark assumed she had sunk in the storm. A second more violent storm hit Ark on 29 November 1633 and lasted three days, finally subsiding on 1 December. In the midst of the storm, the mainsail was split in half and the crew was forced to tie down the tiller and whipstaff so the ship lay ahull', keeping her bow to the wind and waves as she drifted. This was the last bad weather Ark encountered on the trans-Atlantic voyage. On 25 December 1633, wine was passed out to celebrate Christmas. The following day, 30 colonists fell ill with a fever brought on by excessive drinking and 12 died, including two of the Roman Catholic colonists. These were the only losses suffered on the voyage. On 3 January 1633/34 (see below on the start of the new year), Ark arrived at the island of Barbados in the West Indies after a voyage of 42 days from England. About two weeks later, Dove arrived. As it later developed, Dove had been able to reach the shelter of Plymouth harbor where she rode out the storm. On 24 January 1633/34, the ships departed Barbados. An earlier departure was intended but was delayed because Richard Orchard, master (captain) the Dove had departed inland to collect some debts and could not be found on the intended sailing date. After making a few other stops in the Caribbean Sea, on 24 February 1633/34, the ships arrived at Point Comfort (now called Old Point Comfort) at the mouths of the James, Nansemond, and Elizabeth rivers, which formed the great harbor of Hampton Roads in Virginia. This ended their ocean voyage which had lasted slightly over three months, of which 66 days were actually spent at sea. The two ships briefly stopped in Jamestown, Virginia up the James River. After a week's stay, the Calvert colonists then sailed northward up the large expanse of the Bay, landing on St. Clement's Island, also known as Blakistone Island, on the north shore of the Potomac River, across from Virginia's northern border, on 25 March 1634. This day was thereafter celebrated annually in the colony and free State as \\"Maryland Day\\". The colonists planted a large cross, claiming the land in the name of Charles I), King of England, and holding their first communal Mass led by the accompanying Jesuit chaplain, Father Andrew White. The day \\"25 March\\" has been traditionally taken to mark the end of the voyage, although, in fact, the voyage had actually ended earlier on 24 February, when the Ark and the Dove arrived at Point Comfort entering the North American continental waters. 25 March is the Feast of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a major festival day in the liturgical calendar. Until 1752, when England finally adopted the Gregorian Calendar as opposed to the older, now inaccurate Julian Calendar, 25 March was the start of the civil new year,\\"old Style\\" and \\"New Style\\" dates hence the practice of writing dates from 1 January to 25 March as 1633/34.The chronology given here is derived from Father Andrew White's diary account of the voyage using the Barbara Lawatsch-Boomgaarden's translation: White, Father Andrew, Lawatsch-Boomgaarden Barbara, trans. \\"Voyage to Maryland\\", Wauconda, Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, 1995. Although too small for the intended settlement, St. Clement's provided a relatively secure base from which Leonard Calvert, (1606-1647), new first Governor of Maryland and younger brother of Cecilius, could explore the area and negotiate the purchase of land for the new colony. After a brief three-week stay on the island, the new Marylanders occupied a nearby Piscataway Indian village they had purchased on the St. George's (later the St. Mary's) River, several miles (kilometers) southeast from St. Clement's and about northwest from Point Lookout, where the Potomac River enters the Chesapeake Bay. The new English settlement was named \\"St. Mary's City\\" in honor of The Virgin, which later became the provincial capital, and later the county seat/courthouse in the first county to be \\"erected\\" (established), St. Mary's County. In the early summer of 1634, the Ark returned to England. The Dove, which had been also purchased by Calvert and the gentry investors in the new colony, remained for the settlers' use in and around the Bay and coasts of Maryland. In August 1635, the Dove sailed for England carrying timber and beaver pelts, but she never arrived home and was presumed lost in a storm.

The Assembly was endorsed by a referendum in April 1999 which enabled Constituent Assembly elections in July 1999. Three seats were reserved for indigenous delegates in the 131-member constitutional assembly,Van Cott (2003:55) and two additional indigenous delegates won unreserved seats in the assembly elections.Van Cott (2003:56) The constitution was later endorsed by the referendum in December 1999, and new general elections were held under the new constitution in July 2000. This ended the Punto Fijo Pact and ushered in the present-day Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.  Precedents  President Ch√°vez called for a public referendum - something virtually unknown in Venezuela at the time - which he hoped would support his plans to form a constitutional assembly, composed of representatives from across Venezuela, as well as from indigenous tribal groups, which would be able to rewrite the nation's constitution. The referendum went ahead on 25 April 1999, and was an overwhelming success for Ch√°vez, with 88% of voters supporting the proposal.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 130.Jones 2007. p. 238. Following this, Ch√°vez called for an election to take place on 25 July 1999, in which the members of the constitutional assembly would be voted into power, and as Bart Jones commented, \\"The stakes were high. Ch√°vez believed a constitutional assembly controlled by his supporters was the major breakthrough the country needed to end the traditional parties' stronghold on power. Nonetheless, it was not only political supporters of Ch√°vez that believed the assembly was necessarily but also the general public. As a woman in Ch√°vez's home town of Barinas put it on election night, \\"Democracy is infected. And Ch√°vez is the only antibiotic we have. \\" The oligarchy, the traditional parties, and much of the media feared it was the final step to establishing a one-man dictatorship.\\"Jones 2007. p. 239. Former president and Ch√°vez's predecessor Rafael Caldera protested against the constituent assembly, arguing that it violated the 1961 Constitution. Allan Brewer-Car√≠as, a Venezuelan legal scholar and elected member of this assembly, explains that this constitution-making body was an instrument for the gradual dismantling of democratic institutions and values.Allan Brewer-Car√≠as, Dismantling Democracy in Venezuela (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010), 33-35 Of the 1,171 candidates standing for election to the assembly, over 900 of them were opponents of Ch√°vez. Ch√°vez's supporters won 52% of the vote; despite this, because of voting procedures chosen by the government beforehand, supporters of the new government took 125 seats (95% of the total), including all of those belonging to indigenous tribal groups, whereas the opposition obtained only 6 seats.Jones 2007. p. 240. One of the 6 seats was occupied by Professor Allan Brewer-Car√≠as, the most knowledgeable person in the country on the subject of the 1961 Constitution and constitutional history. He was extremely vocal in denouncing and criticizing the abuse that they intended to introduce in the new Constitution. If this new Carta Magna didn‚Äôt bring about more backward thinking into the Republic, it‚Äôs in large part thanks to Allan Brewer‚Äôs work. The 131 member assembly was composed of 121 belonging to the Ch√°vez's Patriotic Pole, which consisted of the Fifth Republic Movement, Movement for Socialism, Fatherland for All, the Communist Party of Venezuela, People's Electoral Movement and others, 3 indigenous representatives and 6 Democratic Pole and other party members consisting of Acci√≥n Democr√°tica, Copei, Project Venezuela and National Convergence.  Setting up the assembly  The Assembly convened 3 August 1999. On 12 August 1999, the new constitutional assembly voted to give themselves the power to abolish government institutions and to dismiss officials who were perceived as being corrupt or operating only in their own interests. As Jones noted, \\"It was a breathtaking move. To its supporters, it could force reforms that had been blocked for years by corrupt politicians and judicial authorities. To its critics, it was an overreach of power and a threat to democracy. The stage was set for a confrontation with the Supreme Court.\\"Jones 2007. p. 241. Indeed, Ch√°vez and his supporters had discussed dissolving both the Supreme Court and the Congress, each of which they believed to be entirely controlled by the oligarchy and the opponents of the Bolivarian movement. The constitutional assembly had the power to perform such an action, and had already fired almost sixty judges whom it identified as being involved in corruption.Jones 2007. pp. 245-246. Nonetheless, the ANC also offered more power to Ch√°vez, it helped him broaden the powers given to the president, and allowed him to call a general election for all public office positions ‚Äîmany of which weren‚Äôt controlled at the time by Ch√°vez or the Movimiento Quinta Rep√∫blica. Soto believes that the ANC enabled Ch√°vez to \\"design a genius political strategy to take over all the spaces in the Venezuelan State.\\" The new constitution included increased protections for indigenous peoples and women, and established the rights of the public to education, housing, healthcare and food. It added new environmental protections, and increased requirements for government transparency. It increased the presidential term from five to six years, allowed people to recall presidents by referendum, and added a new presidential two-term limit. It converted the bicameral legislature which consisted of a Congress with both a Senate and a Chamber of Deputies into a unicameral one that consisted only of a National Assembly.Wilpert 2007. pp. 31-41. As a part of the new constitution, the country, which was then officially known as the Republic of Venezuela, was renamed the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Rep√∫blica Bolivariana de Venezuela) at Ch√°vez's request, thereby reflecting the government's ideology of Bolivarianism. The resulting 1999 Venezuelan Constitution was approved by referendum in December 1999, with the support of nearly 80% of the population.Kozloff 2006. p. 94. Indigenous rights The indigenous peoples in Venezuela make up only around 1.5% of the population nationwide, though the proportion is nearly 50% in Amazonas state.Van Cott (2003:52) Prior to the creation of the 1999 constitution, legal rights for indigenous peoples were increasingly lagging behind other Latin American countries, which were progressively enshrining a common set of indigenous collective rights in their national constitutions. The 1961 constitution had actually been a step backward from the 1947 constitution, and the indigenous rights law foreseen in it languished for a decade, unpassed by 1999.Van Cott (2003), \\"Andean Indigenous Movements and Constitutional Transformation: Venezuela in Comparative Perspective\\", Latin American Perspectives 30(1), p51 Ultimately the constitutional process produced \\"the region's most progressive indigenous rights regime\\".Van Cott (2003:63) Innovations included Article 125's guarantee of political representation at all levels of government, and Article 124's prohibition on \\"the registration of patents related to indigenous genetic resources or intellectual property associated with indigenous knowledge.\\" The new constitution followed the example of Colombia in reserving parliamentary seats for indigenous delegates (three in Venezuela's National Assembly); and it was the first Latin American constitution to reserve indigenous seats in state assemblies and municipal councils in districts with indigenous population.Van Cott (2003:65) Notable Assembly members Nicol√°s Maduro * Luis Miquilena (President) * Ronald Blanco La Cruz * Jos√© Gregorio Brice√±o * Claudio Ferm√≠n * Willian Lara * Nicol√°s Maduro * Alfredo Pe√±a * Marisabel Rodr√≠guez de Ch√°vez * Tarek William Saab * Professor Allan Brewer-Car√≠as See also * 2017 Constituent Assembly of Venezuela  References  Venezuela Constituent Assembly of Venezuela ","title":"1999 Constituent National Assembly"},{"id":"28277709","text":"The Umuaka Autonomous Community is a town in Njaba Local Government Area of Imo State, Nigeria.

It is located near the border of West Khasi Hills district, Meghalaya and Kamrup district, Assam. In Meghalaya's administrative structure, it is under Kyrdum gram panchayat, Mawshynrut block, West Khasi Hills district, whereas Assam assigns it to No. 9 Dakhin Pub Boko gram panchayat, Boko-Bongaon block, Kamrup district, with the Postal Index Number 781129 (shared with Hahimbazar, Nalapara, and Samuka, which are all in No. 70 Dakhin Pub Luki gram panchayat). Facilities The village is served by a government health sub-centre, but it is not staffed by doctors. Teachers rarely come to the village's two schools. The village is not electrified. The village is served by one road, in poor condition, connecting it to the Riangdo-Boko road which itself connects to National Highway 37 in Assam, at a junction just west of Boko. Another road from neighbouring Kthiehthawiar to Meghalaya was under construction in 2008. That would connect Langpih through Kthiehthawiar to a junction with National Highway 44 just west of Nongstoin. It remained under construction by 2011. In 2008, the Assamese government began building a health centre and police outpost in the village, and Assamese police reportedly detained Meghalaya journalists who came to cover the event. Meghalaya Deputy Chief Minister Hopingstone Lyngdoh stated that once the Kthiehthawiar‚ÄìMeghalaya road was complete, the Meghalaya Police would move their temporary police outpost in the area from Lejadubi to Langpih. He stated that two platoons of police would be stationed in the village. Assam Chief Secretary P. C. Sharma rebutted that his state would not allow this. Territorial dispute =1950s to 1990s= Langpih is the subject of a long-running dispute between the Meghalaya and Assam state governments, one of twelve such disputed territories. According to Meghalaya Chief Minister Donkapur Roy, the British annexed the village to Assam's Kamrup district, but then after Indian independence, it was assigned to the United Khasi and Jaintia Hills district, a district in today's Meghalaya state. The Meghalaya government claims that Assam's 1951 demarcation shows the area as part of a district in what would later become Meghalaya state. However, in 1972, Assam's new demarcation showed the area as part of its own Mikir Hills district (now Karbi Anglong District). In 1974, government forces from the two states had a faceoff in the village after Meghalaya policemen allegedly expelled Nepalese grazers, leading Assam policemen to arrive and investigate. Link magazine described the situation as \\"explosive\\". Hopingstone Lyngdoh claims that Assam \\"encroached on the village in 1979\\" and since then encouraged further Assamese settlement there. In 1988, it was claimed in the Lok Sabha that the government of Meghalaya had proposed to set up an electoral constituency, 34-Nongstoin, which covered Kamphaduli, Hakumari, and Langpih. =2010s= The Langpih incident occurred on 14 May 2010, when clashes broke out between the Nepalese and tribal Khasi and Garo communities, leading to shootings by police. National media reported that four Khasi villagers died of the gunshot wounds: Columbus Hujon, Charles Lyngkhoi, Dennis Nonsiej, and Ekros Rani. Reports of the total number of injured varied between twelve and twenty-six. The governments of Assam and Meghalaya have each reported the death toll as two; even this death toll has become an object of political controversy, with authorities of each state moving the corpses around across state borders to manipulate the number. A monument was constructed in memory of the dead villagers. Repercussions of the 2010 incident continued to be felt in 2012, when Pynskhemlang Nongshlong of neighbouring Rambrai village planned to lead a hunger strike in memory of the four slain men. Nongshlong and thirteen fellow activists took to a stage constructed by local people specially for their fast. Two hours after the fast began, the Assistant District Commissioner of Kamrup and 150 police of Assam State arrived at the site. However, Langpih villagers formed a human chain to deny access to police. By the eighth day, eight of the fasters had been retired to Shillong Civil Hospital due to ill health; Nongshlong and five others remained, but were clearly suffering from the effects of dehydration. As the fast neared its second week, Meghalaya Chief Minister Mukul Sangma appealed to Delhi for assistance. Nongshlong declared an end to the fast on 13 July, giving the government a deadline of two months to fulfill a list of demands which the villagers would later announce. However, on 16 July Nongshlong and four women resumed their fast at Nongstoin. Around the same time, the Meghalaya People‚Äôs Human Rights Council sent a delegation to the 20th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland. MPHRC General Secretary Dino Dympep met with UN Special Rapporteur James Anaya regarding the 2010 killings, following which Anaya sent a communique to the Government of India. However, by the following month the GOI had failed to respond.

Parts of this 10-hectare site in the district of Lindenau are used today by art galleries, studios and restaurants. Founded in 1884, the business developed into the largest cotton mill in continental Europe over the next quarter century. During this time, an entire industrial town with over 20 factories, workers' housing, kindergartens and a recreational area, grew in western Leipzig. The mill reached its maximum extent in 1907, with 240,000 spindles processing cotton across a working area of about . Up to 4,000 people worked there, until production of thread was halted in 1993 following the reunification of Germany several years earlier. Subsequently, the area was repopulated by a mixture of people including craftsmen, self-employed, and above all artists, many belonging to the so-called \\"New Leipzig School\\". More than half of the available space has since been rented out again for new purposes. Ten galleries, a communal arts center (Halle 14), and around 100 artists (including Neo Rauch, Jim Whiting, Hans Aichinger, and Matthias Weischer) have all settled at the site, as well as restaurants, fashion designers, architects, printers, a goldsmith, a pottery, a film club, a porcelain manufacturer, and an arts supply store. The site contained several platform interchanges from a now-disused railway between Lindenau and Plagwitz. Parts of the platforms are still intact.

History The University takes its name from the founders Alan Brierley, Richard Price and Charles Prior, who in 1975 set up Brierley Price Prior to train accountancy students. BPP was first granted degree- awarding powers in 2007, and has possessed ‚Äòindefinite‚Äô degree-awarding powers since 1 September 2020. In March 2013, the University and College Union wrote to then UK Business Secretary Vince Cable urging him to shelve BPP‚Äôs application for university title pending an investigation into its relationship with its parent companies, saying, ‚ÄúAt risk are both the interests of BPP students and the international credibility of the UK university title.‚Äù On 8 August 2013, BPP University College of Professional studies was granted the title of university and rebranded as BPP University. The move to grant BPP university status was criticised by the University and College Union in an open letter. In November 2013, BPP was awarded the EducationInvestor magazine's ‚ÄúHigher/Professional Education Provider of the Year 2013‚Äù title. Ownership On 30 July 2009, American private education company Apollo Group-run Apollo Global acquired BPP in a deal worth approximately $607 million, funded by an intercompany loan of approximately $104 million from Apollo Group to Apollo Global, $375 million in capital contributions from Apollo Group and $55 million in capital contributions from Apollo Global‚Äôs minority shareholder, the Carlyle Group. In June 2019, Times Higher Education reported that BPP owners, the Apollo Education Group, were looking to sell the University just two years after ownership changed hands in 2017,Morgan, John (19 June 2019). \\"BPP sale set to test appetite for for- profit investment\\".

Locations and Schools BPP University has six study centres located in London; twelve across the rest of England, including in Doncaster, Newcastle, Milton Keynes, and Southampton; and two in Guernsey and Jersey in the Channel Islands. The university operates four schools: BPP University School of Business and Technology, BPP University Law School, BPP University School of Health and BPP University School of Nursing. As of October 2020, the university offers its students courses in Law, Accountancy, Management, Data, Innovation & Technology, Financial Services, Nursing & Healthcare, Human Resources, Governance, Actuary, Chiropractic, and Psychology. In September 2017, Times Higher Education reported that BPP had shut down its degree programme in dental and oral sciences with immediate effect after it failed to meet General Dental Council standards just a year after launching the course in autumn 2016, leaving new students unable to start and existing undergraduate students facing an uncertain future. Student criticism during COVID-19 pandemic In July 2020, BPP University's Law School was on the receiving end of criticism from its students during the COVID-19 pandemic for not delivering physical copies of ‚Äúpermitted materials‚Äù and textbooks to its Legal Practice Course students. In an open letter to BPP‚Äôs vice chancellor, students on the Legal Practice Course revealed that the law school‚Äôs class sizes had more than quadrupled in the wake of COVID-19, with 15-person classes now containing up to 70 students. In the letter, BPP students claimed ‚ÄúBPP University‚Äôs response to lockdown and Coronavirus has only served to create an environment of mistrust and anxiety for students, severely degrade the quality of teaching and assessment, and push as many costs of adjusting to lockdown onto students.‚Äù On 22 July 2020, The Lawyer reported that many BPP students were locked out of exams due to IT failures and had demanded a partial refund of their fees ‚Äúbased on the period of time students were unable to use BPP facilities.‚Äù On 12 August 2020, the Junior Lawyers Division of the Law Society of England and Wales, which represents LPC students across England and Wales, questioned the University‚Äôs decision to charge students registered at its London campuses higher fees than regional counterparts despite the switch to online education, and urged BPP to ‚Äútake the time to talk with the group‚Äù and handle student concerns moving forward.

In turn, the land passed to Robert Campbell (1769‚Äì1846), and then to Arthur Jeffreys by a deed of partition on 15 April 1848, and a conveyance on 28 February 1854.

On the 29 April 1873, Henry Hocken Bligh (1826‚Äì1904) and Neil Stewart bought from Jeffreys the land on which now stands the Kirribilli Neighbourhood Centre. Bligh had been the Mayor of Willoughby in 1869 and 1871. Bligh and Stewart acquired what was called Lot 2 which was on the northern side of Fitzroy Street with an approximate frontage of , and a depth of to a reserved roadway now known as Bligh Street. On the west it was separated by a fence from Lot 1 which was the lot that occupied the corner of Fitzroy Street and Broughton Street. Lot 1 was already being leased by Henry Hocken Bligh who lived in a wooden house on the Lot until his new house was complete. Research into the early Rate Books of East St. Leonards Council by Marjory Byrne of the North Sydney Historical Society in 1978 shows that the two stone houses were built by Bligh in 1875-1876. They were described at the time as two storey, stone with slate roof, and of eight rooms each. The 1875-76 records show that one of the stone houses was occupied by Mr. Bligh, and the other by Mrs Want. Mr. Bligh's home became No. 16 and the other No. 18 Fitzroy Street. The Rate Books record that the houses were initially stated to be in North Sydney, subsequently Milsons Point, and later still, Kirribilli. Mr. Bligh occupied the house, which he named \\"Trelawney\\" until his death in 1904. Hocken is buried in the heritage cemetery at St Thomas' Cemetery, North Sydney, NSW. On his death his share of the whole property passed to his sons, Henry Albury Bligh (b: Bef. 22 Sep 1862 in Albury, New South Wales, NSW, Australia d: Bef. 15 Sep 1928 in Wyong, NSW) and William Milson Bligh (b: 1867 in St Leonards, Sydney, NSW, Australia d: 1936 in North Sydney, NSW). His widow, and members of the family are thought to have remained in the house until about 1905. His widow, Mrs. Bligh died at \\"Carabella\\", 34 McDougall Street Kirribilli on 28 August 1927. Some of the occupants of No 18 Fitzroy Street were: * Mrs Want (from 1876‚Äì77) * A.C. Rudge (from 1878‚Äì79) (barely readable) * Hayley Marshall (c. 1881) (barely readable) * Alexander Thompson (from 1884‚Äì93) * Rev. Rice (from 1895‚Äì99) (barely readable) In December 1911 the two houses (No. 16 and 18 Fitzroy Street) were bought by Margaret Cullen, wife of Thomas Cullen, retired victualler of North Sydney for ¬£2,300.00. The Cullen family held the properties until 9 March 1951 when they were purchased by Domenico and Mary Re. On 31 January 1961 the property was purchased by Granula Court Pty. Ltd. Subsequently, in 1974, vacant and neglected the property was purchased by North Sydney Council on 4 July 1974. Construction and heritage listing The house has been largely restored to the original layout with relatively minor alterations. The Kirribilli Neighbourhood Centre is heritage-listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981 The building is described on the NSW heritage database as being \\"designed in the Victorian Rustic Gothic style\\". The \\"Two storey symmetrical semi-detached houses of stone with a corrugated iron gabled roof. There are carved bargeboards, finials and a lancet ventillator to the gable ends, three-light square-headed windows and iron lace, columns and balustrades to the verandahs.\\" And as being \\"Built 1876 for Henry Hocken Bligh (1826-1904), former Mayor of Willoughby (1869-70) and husband of Elizabeth Shairp, granddaughter of James Milson. The Blighs lived at No. 16 and owned other properties in the area. It was sold in 1911, through various ownerships until acquired by the Council in 1974. It was restored subsequently as the Kirribilli Neighbourhood Centre.\\" North Sydney Council in more recent documentation has referred to the centre as \\"Rustic Gothic\\" Victorian architecture. Modern usage as a Neighbourhood Centre The establishment of the Kirribilli Neighbourhood Centre was initiated by Alderman Robyn Read Hamilton who had money set aside in the Council estimates and drove the project. An open day was held on 28 September 1974 at the unrestored centre. The public were invited to view the centre and make suggestions as to how the building could be used. A Committee was formed which has operated continuously since that time as a Limited Cooperative. The Centre was opened in May 1976. The Kirribilli Neighbourhood Centre is now run as a community neighbourhood centre by a committee governed by the North Sydney Council. The centre provides spaces for community activities and parties or celebrations. It also provides a wide range of adult education courses, holds a monthly market, and offers activities and services for all ages. Rooms with views of the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge are available for hire. The Centre is commonly used as a meeting place for organisations including: * Sydney Unitarians * Sydney Seniors * Adults Surviving Child Abuse * Storytelling The Centre also features a large outdoor area with a large toy collection for children. The Kirribilli Neighbourhood Centre Committee also manages the Kirribilli General Markets, the Art and Design Market and the Fashion Market.

The resolution was sponsored by Japan, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. Resolution =Observations= In the preamble of the resolution, the Security Council emphasised the importance of stability and security of Iraq and its people, the region and international community. The Iraqi government was urged to continue to strengthen democracy and the rule of law and improvements in the security situation in the country were welcomed, though the Council noted that challenges remained. It underlined the need for an inclusive political process and the role of the United Nations. The Council further welcomed the March 7, 2010 parliamentary election and called for an inclusive government to be formed as soon as possible. The Secretary-General's report had expressed concern at the delay in forming a new government. Greater efforts were urged with regard to human rights and humanitarian issues of the Iraqi people. It reaffirmed that all parties should take steps to protect civilians and create conditions for the return of refugees and internally displaced persons. The preamble concluded by thanking Ad Melkert, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for his leadership of UNAMI and recognised the importance of Iraq achieving an international standing to that prior to the adoption of Resolution 661 (1990). =Acts= The mandate of UNAMI and the Special Representative was extended for one year and would be reviewed at the end of that period or soon if requested to do so by the Iraqi government. The security of UNAMI personnel was emphasised in order for the operation to carry out its work and the Iraqi government and other countries were called upon to provide support to the United Nations in the country. The Council appreciated the efforts of countries that had provided financial, logistical, and security resources to UNAMI. Finally, the Resolution 1936 concluded by requesting the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to report every four months on progress made by UNAMI in fulfilling its responsibilities.
