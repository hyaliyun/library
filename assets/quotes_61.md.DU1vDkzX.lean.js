The parish church is situated in the Tr√∏jborg neighbourhood, immediately north-west of Nordre Cemetery. In 2015, Saint Johannes Parish counted some 8,916 members. The church was consecrated in 1905, thus becoming the fourth church to be built in Aarhus. Saint Johannes Parish was originally part of Aarhus Domsogn but it was made an independent parish when the church was built in 1905. Part of Saint Johannes Parish was separated into Christiansbjerg Church District in 1912 and in 1935 another part of the parish was annexed by Saint Markus Parish. Architecture Saint Johannes Church was designed by the architect and Royal Surveyor Hack Kampmann who built a number of other notable structures in Aarhus at the time, including Aarhus Custom House, Aarhus Theatre, Marselisborg Palace and Villa Kampen. Construction of the church was initiated in 1902 and completed in 1905 under the supervision of architect Valdemar Schmidt. The building is constructed as a traditional cross church with moderate Neo-Romanesque and Neo-Gothic influences but with an Art Nouveau interior and furnishings. Relatively large, with 700 seats, it is a red brick church with a copper thatched tower in the west and choir in the east. In 1960 rooms were added in the northern and southern cross arms of the church. The wooden fence surrounding the choir was replaced with a new one of brass at the same time. In 1971, the building Johannesg√•rden was constructed next to the church for the parish council. The interior has been altered over the years. The rim chandeliers was replaced with new ones of brass in 1930, the benches have been lowered for aesthetic reasons and in 2005 glass mosaics were installed in the southern windows of the church. The altar and font are the only remnants left of the original decor. Saint Johannes Church has an organ by Marcussen & S√∏n from 1979 with 36 notes and the mosaics were designed by Arne Haugen S√∏rensen.

Production  Demons was the first major EP released by From Her Eyes on 25 August 2014. After recording a demo EP in early 2013 from initial live songs, From Her Eyes were unsatisfied with their released material. Wanting to progress more towards melodic metalcore sound and shy away from clean vocals, the band released ex-Rhythm Guitarist Indigo Lani Lewis-Jones who was present with their demo. This was also the first release with Jesse Simmonds, who replaced ex-bassist and founding member Luke Williams in late 2013. With From Her Eyes being big fans of the work of Devil Sold His Soul and The Elijah, the band decided to enlist Jonny Renshaw to Record, Produce, Mix and Engineer the record, feeling he could capture the new melodic sound they were searching for. After recording iduring April 2014, the band released the EP on 25 August 2014, with an EP Launch show the week prior with friends and local compatriots Breathe in the Silence and Set to Break (now Captors) supporting.  Track list   Reception  The album was received positively by critics. Ramzine and Wolves Media gave the EP a maximum score of 10/10. Wolves Media stated in their review that ' In the world of metalcore/hardcore, there aren‚Äôt too many bands that do it for me quite like From Her Eyes, one of South Wales‚Äô best up and coming bands...This EP breaks new ground and will undoubtedly help From Her Eyes establish themselves as one of the defining metalcore bands of this generation.

Philanthropy In the same vein as Carnegie, Coats believed that gain in personal wealth had to be balanced against good deeds in a public way. In 1870 Coats gifted his home town of Paisley a Free Library and Museum, the Paisley Museum and Art Galleries, built wholly at his expense, and intended for the improvement and education of all. Artistic recognition A statue of Peter Coats is paired with a statue of Thomas Coats in the centre of Paisley just west of the town hall. The pair were sculpted by William Birnie Rhind.Paisley‚Äôs Public Sculptures: Leaflet published by Renfrewshire Council, 2008 Family Sir Peter and his wife Gloranna McKenzie had twelve children, five sons and seven daughters.

He graduated from Teacher Training School then received a scholarship to England in 1920 to study pedagogic methods of art teaching, and watercolors. An early pioneer of art education, and the author of the first Arabic book on the subject in 1936. He taught graduates of the Fine and Applied Arts Colleges to prepare them to become arts teachers and get their National Teacher's Certificate. He established the Art Advocates Society in 1928 for artist investigating Egyptian identity through art, and watercolors in particular. His Spontaneous Sculpture School and the Textile Drawing School was continued by son-in-law Ramses Wissa Wassef in Harraneya. He represented Egypt in conferences on art teaching in Paris from 1936, and his educational experiments became an inspiration to major international writers, including Wilhelm Viola, in his book The Art of the Child. During his scholarship period in England, he specialized in watercolours. Habib Georghe was interested in the aesthetics of Egyptian art, and adopted this through his call for painting Egyptian landscapes, and through his establishing the Folk Art School, where he fostered a number of spontaneous artists, including Sayeda Massak, Samira Hosny, Yehya Bu Seri', Bodour Girgis, who were all talented in environmental sculpture, in the period from 1938 to 1951. Philosophy He built a Folk Art School on the principles of the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung concerning the collective unconscious. Gorgi postulated that the Egyptian genius that had brought forth the Pharaonic, Coptic and Islamic art traditions was still present in the being of modern Egyptians, as they were interacting with the same environment, society, climate and genetic factors. If a child, not exposed to the patterns of Western schooling, was given the chance for self-expression through clays, or sculpture, or textiles, the inherent genius would burst forth. His experiment worked, and was acknowledged and admired both in Egypt and abroad. Watercolors He was an accomplished watercolorist, who painted Egyptian landscapes in the outdoors. For example, Christian monasteries standing in the heart of the desert in a pure style reflecting their almost mystical austerity and severity. Habib Gorgi Museum In 1971, Ramses Wissa Wassef designed and built a museum to the teaching experiment and philosophy of Habib Gorgi. The museum at the Ramses Wissa Wassef Art Centre in Giza, Egypt, displayed terracotta figurative sculptures by children and young adults.

She was a deputy director of the Cumberland County Welfare Board in New Jersey. She received several awards for elderly programs.  Roosevelt Park  WPA old-age bungalow during construction in 1936 Morrison was the deputy director of the Cumberland County Welfare Board in 1932. At this time she came up with a concept for a colony for senior citizens. She initiated a series of contacts to transform the concept into a policy and then into a project and reality. Morrison first conveyed the idea to New Jersey Governor Arthur Harry Moore who in turn passed the concept to Leon Henderson. Henderson (who grew up in Millville) and was an economic advisor in the Roosevelt Administration. Henderson transmitted the idea to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who shared the concept with her husband, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Thence the project was added to the Works Progress Administration as the first senior housing project in the United States. The WPA spent $30,000 to build the 14 houses, and then turned them over to the town of Millville, which had donated land for the venture. Millville agreed to keep the houses in good repair and served as the landlord. The retirement colony was built on land which had been repossessed by the town of Millville for back taxes and became known as the \\"Roosevelt Colony\\". It was later renamed to the \\"Roosevelt Park\\" old age colony, and was sometimes referred to as the Colony for the Aged at Roosevelt Park and Roosevelt Park Colony for Aged. When it opened on October 23, 1936, it became the first senior citizens retirement colony in the United States. The colony consisted of 14 houses, each named after a flower, on lots . The houses were in a large square which had graded streets and sidewalks. There was a central community house for social activities within the project square with a resident colonist as a manager and caretaker. The community house had a fireplace, an assembly room, and game rooms. Each of the 14 white cottage style houses at Roosevelt Park consisted of a living room, a bedroom and a bathroom. There were seven houses for married people that rented for $7 per month. There were also seven houses designed for single people which were a little smaller and rented for $5 per month which included water and electricity. The houses were designed with the elderly in mind so that housekeeping chores would be minimized, and each came with a vegetable or flower garden. Residents received $15 monthly from the state under the Old Age Assistance Act that had established the \\"old-age assistance\\" program in 1932.

He was a prominent representative of Czech painting from the turn of the century, a legacy of French cubism, reaching to the Renaissance in the 15th and 16th century, when painters attempted to capture the fascinating element of graphical representation, i.e. space, the third dimension, and depth. In his work, the three-dimensionality of objects was replaced by the non-perspective of spaciousness, containing a meaning. This led to the discovery of a new art called ‚ÄúSpatial Metaphors‚Äú.  Life  Jaroslav Mal√°tek was born on 13 March 1923 in Choce≈à in an old mill. He graduated from ƒåesk√° T≈ôebov√° high school, where he was directed towards painting by Professor Bƒõlsk√Ω, who instructed him in painting. During his studies, he was also interested in athletics. His sport achievements eventually led him to Prague. There he had the opportunity to visit various galleries and encounter the works of famous painters after his sport meetings. A few years after his studies, he and many of his peers were forcibly recruited into the army and sent to Germany. His survival in N√ºrnberg during the war was a miracle, especially the mayhem, full of the sounds of sirens before the airstrikes by the allied units of the United States Air Force (USAF) and the Royal Air Force (RAF) between 1940 and 1945, when N√ºrnberg was almost destroyed, plagues his dreams until today. After WWII he successfully graduated from the College of Education at Charles University in Prague (1945-1949). He studied under Professor Martin Salcman, Professor Karel Lidick√Ω and Professor Cyril Bouda, who successfully instructed him in the technique and art of the master painter Max ≈†vabinsk√Ω. During the fifties, the time of communist oppression, Jaroslav Mal√°tek had to stop pursuing his career as a teacher. He focused even more on painting. He drew much of his inspiration from sceneries, which eventually became his inspiration for life. The View of Homol, Scenery in Z√°mrsk, From Javornice to the Mountains (an area that the painter Vojtƒõch Sedl√°ƒçek was from), Choce≈à by Lhoty, Bƒõstovice Scenery ‚Äì those are only some of his most prominent sceneries. Because during communism having an income from painting was only possible for a select few, Jaroslav Mal√°tek had to work as a glass worker, building painter, miner and a logistics worker. He liked working in advertising and sometimes worked in interior design. In 1980, he moved from Choce≈à to Brand√Ωs nad Orlic√≠. There, he met his girlfriend, Helena, who gave him further inspiration. During that time, he moved away from his scenic compositions to abstract paintings and pictures. This led to the creation of three-dimensional pictures utilizing materials such as fiberboard, metal and glass. All three-dimensional pictures were first created as small drafts and maquettes. These were subsequently magnified using different computer programs, and then fashioned in their intended size. The three-dimensional pictures, \\"Spatial Metaphors‚Äù by Jaroslav Mal√°tek are intended to accent modern housing. They decorate the spaces of several European institutions. Due to their uniqueness, they have lately become sought after by successful individuals from Europe and Asia, mainly as a means of investment. The pictures can be seen at the author's exhibitions and potentially at auctions. = Pictures - Spatial Metaphors = Pohled na oblohu1.jpgDreams Pohled na oblohu2.jpgLife is Life stromoradi1.jpgAlley = Exhibitions (selection) = * Art Gallery, N√°chod * Journey to three- dimensional pictures, Municipal library, Letohrad * Gallery Glass Cube, Pardubice * Journey to three-dimensional pictures 1968 - 2002, Town Hall Gallery, √öst√≠ nad Orlic√≠ * Ghetto Museum, Terez√≠n * Cultural Center Svƒõt Gallery, Mlad√° Boleslav * Czechoslovakian Chamber Sculpture, Exhibition Hall M√°nes, Praha * Movie Art Competition, Z√ºrich, Switzerland * International competition, Jena, Gramny * International competition in Kobe, Japan * International painting competition, Osaka, Japan * International competition, Jena, Germany * International competition, Erfurt, Germany * International competition, Budapest, Hungary * International competition, Wien, Austria  Literature  * Spatial Metaphors. 25 years of three-dimensional pictures, catalogue * Richter M.: Spatial metaphors by Jaroslav Mal√°tek, Echoes of √öst√≠, pages 12‚Äì13, March 2004 * Hudeƒçek Ivan: Stories and opinions in three- dimensional pictures J.

Built in the 1850s, this Italianate structure is one the community's more architecturally sophisticated buildings, and is notable as the home of Nathan Hichborn, a local shipbuilder and politician who was responsible for the town's separation from Prospect. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.  Description and history  Now the location of a Farm to Table restaurant, the Hichborn House is located in the village of Stockton Springs, just south of United States Route 1 and the Stockton Springs Community Church on the west side of Church Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, clapboard siding, and a stone foundation. The roof has broad eaves studded with paired brackets, has gabled dormers facing front, and is topped by an hexagonal cupola. The east-facing front facade is symmetrical, three bays wide, with its center entrance sheltered by a portico supported by clusters of chamfered square posts. A three-part window stands above the entrance, with a molded hood shaped to the window parts' curved tops. The interior of the house has well- preserved woodwork, and has faux-marbled slate fireplace surrounds in the downstairs parlors. An ell extends to the rear, joining the house to a carriage barn. The house has traditionally been given a construction date of 1849, but its construction and styling suggest an 1850s date. The house was designed by Alfred Bither, an architect then based in Bangor, and was built for Nathan G. Hichborn, a local shipbuilder and politician. Hichborn was a prolific shipbuilder, turning out 42 ships over a 28-year period. He was instrumental in the construction of the nearby Stockton Springs Community Church, and led the effort to separate Stockton Springs from Prospect, which was successfully completed in 1857. Hichborn served in the state legislature and as state treasurer, and was a candidate for Governor of Maine on a temperance movement ticket.

The ''''' (Latin for \\"Overview of Grammar\\"; . or ). was one of the earlier works on Latin grammar and Aristotelian logic by the medieval English philosopher Roger Bacon. It is primarily noteworthy for its exposition of a kind of universal grammar. History The work is apparently a series of lectures given by Bacon for the mandatory classes on Priscian's work On Construction (Books XVII & XVIII of his Institutes of Grammar) at the University of Paris, where he taught in the 1230s and '40s. Much more than Bacon's later linguistic works, the ' lies in the mainstream of 13th-century analysis. The first part borrows directly from Robert Kilwardby's commentary on Priscian.Kilwardby, ', Ch. xvii. More generally, the work reflects the speculative grammar taught at Oxford in such 13th-century works as the '. It is probable that the final draft of the work which Bacon mentions in his 'Bacon, Com. Nat., Bk. I, p. 1. was never completed.. His Greek and Hebrew Grammars and Compendium of Philosophy may have been considered as part of it. It survived in two manuscripts: P and W. P is a copy in book hand evidently intended for a personal library.Cambridge Peterhouse 191. W is a students' copy written in the informal hand of the late 13th or early 14th century..Worcester Cathedral, MS Q13. Contents The work describes figurative language, rhetorical devices, and irregular Latin grammar using \\"sophisms\\" or illustrative examples. It aims to complement Bacon's students' required readings of Priscian's work On Construction by presenting its important points in a more thorough and logical order. It assumes a mastery of standard grammatical rules which the students would have already learnt as '.. It most frequently cites Priscian, but more often adopts the solutions of Peter Helias. The first section lays out rules regarding grammatical agreement and the rhetorical devices antithesis, synthesis, procatalepsis,. From the Arisotelian notion that \\"art imitates nature to the extent that it can\\"Aristotle, Phys., Bk. II, 219, 4a21. and under the influence of Averro√´s's commentaries, Bacon argues that nouns and pronouns can be distinguished from verbs and adverbs owing to the distinction between permanent and successive things. Further, verbs constitute a kind of movement from the subject to the object which imposes obligations on the grammar. For instance, owing to their origin from verbs, Bacon considers that participles and infinitives are too unstable to function properly as the object of a sentence, as \\"nothing which is in motion can come to rest in something in motion, no motion being able to complete itself in something in motion\\". The second section deals with non- figurative constructions including impersonals, gerundives, interjections, and ablative absolutes. The third section covers illustrative examples by topic in greater or less detail and more or less at random.. The primary ones are ', ', ', ', ', ', ', ', ', and '. Most of these examples appear in other collections. The fourth section analyses short sentences, along with adverbial phrases and liturgical formulas such as ' whose use of ellipsis presented certain problems. It's divided into three sections on \\"On Some Cases in the Nominal Absolute\\", \\"On Mediate Apposition\\", and \\"On Some Difficulties in Speech\\". Intentionalism Bacon emphasizes that grammatical rules cannot be applied mechanistically but must be understood as a structure through which to attempt to understand the author's intent ('). The desire to communicate some particular idea may require breaking some of the standard rules. Such exceptions must, however, be linguistically justified. In this he follows Kilwardby. Although Bacon considered an understanding of logic to be important for clarity in philosophical and theological texts, he found his era's Modist analyses needed to be tempered by a contextual understanding of the linguistic ambiguity inevitable in the imposition of signs and from the shifts of meaning and emphasis over time. Universal grammar Bacon argues for a universal grammar underlying all human languages. As more tersely stated in his later Greek Grammar: Hovdhaugen leaves open the possibility, however, that, unlike the Modists who followed Bacon, his own statements on the subject did not refer to a universal grammar but to a universal science to be employed in studying linguistics across languages.. This derives from an ambiguity in the Latin ', which referred variously to the structure of language, to its description, and to the science underlying such descriptions.

Geography The townland of Tassan or Tasson is situated approximately two miles north east of Annyalla, close to the border with Northern Ireland, between the towns of Monaghan and Castleblayney, off the old N2 primary road, which linked Dublin and Derry. The area is located close to the Armagh border which provided an option for people to make a living during periods of economic recession also the Cashel and Tonagh bogs supplied a source of fuel to people for many years up to the late 1960s. Two lakes dominate the landscape in the townland, Lough Nahinch (The Island Lough) and Tassan Lough Natural Heritage Area, both of which have been used by anglers for pike and perch fishing over the centuries. History Tassan is located in the postal district of Clontibret where in 1595 in the adjacent countryside the Battle of Clontibret occurred. The territory of Monaghan had been wrested from the control of the MacMahon clan in 1591, when the clan leader was executed by English authority. Subsequent encroachments by the English into the province of Ulster led to the Nine Years War (1595‚Äì1603). The battle was the earliest clash between the two sides, with the Irish led by Hugh O'Neill and the English by Sir Henry Bagenal. Although O'Neill won the battle, the war ended with the completion of the English conquest of Ireland. In 1610 the Plantation of Ulster was established, an event that still defines certain political allegiances in the north of Ireland. =Tassan Mining Company= The Tassan Mining Company was established in the late 1840s. Total production from the mine was reported at 742 tonnes of ore, including 546 tonnes of lead and 37.478g of silver. The mineralization was hosted by two lodes each striking Northwest and dipping Eastwards.Morris J.H (1984) : The Metallic Mineral Deposits of the Lower Palaeozoic Longford-Down Inlier in the Republic of Ireland Geological Survey of Ireland RS 84/1 Mineral Resources, pp.72 The mine appears to have extended to a depth of 160 m below surface, the site contained a combined engine and crusher house as well as mine offices, workshops and at least five shafts.Morris J.H., Lally, P. and Cowman, D. (2002). A history and survey of mine buildings at the Tassan Mine Co. Monaghan. Journal of the Mining Heritage Trust of Ireland 2, pp.41-49 The lead mine continued in operation until 1865-1866, after which production statistics are unavailable. It provided much needed work locally in the aftermath of the Great Famine (1845‚Äì1849). The captains' mine offices remain standing, and the site is largely grassed over with spoil heaps visible near Tassan Lough Natural Heritage Area. =Tassan Rovers GAA team 1937 to 1941= The Tassan G.A.A. team was founded at the beginning of 1937 and participated in the Junior League Mid Monaghan section. The Tassan team progressed to the top of their division in the Junior League by the end of June 1937. In 1939, the team won the Dr. Ward Cup Final re-play against Killanny, which was held in Castleblayney on Sunday 21 April 1940.

The most common metals used for this end are iron [Fe(III)] and manganese [Mn(IV)], which are reduced to Fe(II) and Mn(II) respectively, and most microorganisms that reduce Fe(III) can reduce Mn(IV) as well. But other metals and metalloids are also used as terminal electron acceptors, such as vanadium [V(V)], chromium [Cr(VI)], molybdenum [Mo(VI)], cobalt [Co(III)], palladium [Pd(II)], gold [Au(III)], and mercury [Hg(II)].  Conditions and mechanisms for dissimilatory metal reduction  Dissimilatory metal reducers are a diverse group of microorganisms, which is reflected in the factors that affect the different forms of metal reduction. The process of dissimilatory metal reduction occurs in the absence of oxygen (O2), but dissimilatory metal reducers include both obligate (strict) anaerobes, such as the family Geobacteraceae, and facultative anaerobes, such as Shewanella spp. As well, across the dissimilatory metal reducers species, various electron donors are used in the oxidative reaction that is coupled to metal reduction. For instance, some species are limited to small organic acids and hydrogen (H2), whereas others may oxidize aromatic compounds. In certain instances, such as Cr(VI) reduction, the use of small organic compounds can optimize the rate of metal reduction. Another factor that influences metal respiration is environmental acidity. Although acidophilic and alkaliphilic dissimilatory metal reducers exist, the neutrophilic metal reducers group contains the most well-characterized genera. In soil and sediment environments, where the pH is often neutral, metals like iron are found in their solid oxidized forms, and exhibit variable reduction potential, which can affect their use by microorganisms. Due to the impermeability of the cell wall to minerals and the insolubility of metal oxides, dissimilatory metal reducers have developed ways to reduce metals extracellularly via electron transfer. Cytochromes c, which are transmembrane proteins, play an important role in transporting electrons from the cytosol to enzymes attached to the outside of the cell. The electrons are then further transported to the terminal electron acceptor via direct interaction between the enzymes and the metal oxide. In addition to establishing direct contact, dissimilatory metal reducers also display the ability to perform ranged metal reduction. For instance, some species of dissimilatory metal reducers produce compounds that can dissolve insoluble minerals or act as electron shuttles, enabling them to perform metal reduction from a distance. Other organic compounds frequently found in soils and sediments, such as humic acids, may also act as electron shuttles.Lovley, D. R., Fraga, J. L., Blunt-Harris, E. L., Hayes, L. A., Phillips, E. J. P., & Coates, J. D. (1998). Humic substances as a mediator for microbially catalyzed metal reduction. Acta hydrochimica et hydrobiologica, 26(3), 152-157. In biofilms, nanowires and multistep electron hopping (in which electrons jump from cell to cell towards the mineral) have also been suggested as methods for reducing metals without requiring direct cell contact. It has been proposed that cytochromes c are involved in both of these mechanisms. In nanowires, for instance, cytochromes c function as the final component that transfers electrons to the metal oxide.  Terminal electron acceptors  A wide range of Fe(III)-bearing minerals have been observed to function as terminal electron acceptors, including magnetite, hematite, goethite, lepidocrocite, ferrihydrite, hydrous ferric oxide, smectite, illite, jarosite, among others.  Secondary mineral formation  In natural systems, secondary minerals may form as a byproduct of bacterial metal reduction. Commonly observed secondary minerals produced during experimental bio-reduction by dissimilatory metal reducers include magnetite, siderite, green rust, vivianite, and hydrous Fe(II)-carbonate.

They were mounted with about 2¬∞ of dihedral on a very short centre section from which they could be easily demounted. There were long, narrow chord ailerons. The Delannne 11 was initially powered by a five-cylinder, air-cooled Salmson 5A radial engine in the nose, fed from tanks in the wing centre section.

A high long canopy dominated the upper fuselage, occupying about 40% of its length and enclosing two side-by-side seats, with baggage space behind them. The glazing was unusually free of frames, with just three rectangular glass panels on each side and a smaller, triangular window immediately behind the windscreen. At the rear, the glazing angled in towards the fuselage centreline, the two sides meeting at a vertical edge. A combination of the simple glazing, the canopy height and the surrounding fuselage profile produced notably good all-round vision. The empennage was conventional, with the tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage. In plan the tailplane was semi- elliptical and the elevators almost semi-circular. The fin and unbalanced rudder also had curved edges and together were rather pointed; the rudder extended to the keel and operated in an elevator cut-out. The undercarriage was of the tailskid type, with a track. The wheels were on bent split axles mounted on the centreline of the fuselage underside, their ends rubber sprung from vertical V-struts from the wing centre section. The Delanne 11 was marketed with a Anzani 6-cylinder radial as an alternative to the Salmson. Advertisements also offered a three-seat version, powered by an unspecified engine; there is no evidence that this variant was flown. No sales were made and only the prototype was built. The first flight was made by Descamps on 8 March 1929 from Orly, powered by the Salmson engine. By April 1929 the prototype was Anzani powered. It was registered as F-AJGB on 26 June 1929 and named L'Ibis Bleu (The Blue Ibis). At the end of June 1929 the Delanne 11 was displayed at the IIe Concours International d'Avions l√©gers (Second light aircraft competition) in Rotterdam. It was flown by Descamps, the only French pilot there. In May 1931 it was being offered for sale and was re-registered with a new owner in January 1931. It remained active into 1933 and was scheduled to appear at Le Grand Rally de Vins de Bordeaux in late June.

Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.Freedom of Information, UNESCO. In Serbia, access to public information is guaranteed in the Constitution and protected by the Law on free Access to Information of Public Importance adopted in 2003 and amended in 2007 and 2009. The scope of the right entails that everyone in Serbia has the right to access to information of public importance and to be informed whether public authorities hold specific information, whether such information is already accessible, and to obtain a copy of the requested information. The Commissioner for Information of Public Importance and Protection of personal data is the authority entitled by law to monitor the respect of obligations entailed by this Law. Legal framework Serbia is considered among the countries with the best regulatory framework regarding access to information of public relevance: the Global Right to Information Rating, compiled by NGOs AccessInfo and Centre for Law and Democracy, ranks the country in the second position in its global ranking assessing the quality of legislative frameworks regulating FOI across the world. The right of access to public information is defined in Article 51 of the Constitution of Serbia, which establishes the right of everybody to be informed about issues of public importance and the deriving obligation of state bodies and public organizations to guarantee the access to such information. The right to access to information of public relevance is translated into national law by the Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance adopted in 2003 and amended in 2007 and 2009. The scope of the law is valued positively especially inasmuch as it extends the right to access to information to all natural person, notwithstanding their citizenship, temporary or permanent residence in the country. Moreover, the right to access information applies to the executive, legislative and judicial bodies, State-owned enterprises, as well as other public authorities and private bodies that perform a public function or that receive significant public funding are also obliged to disclose information of public relevance (Art. 3). Requests should be lodged in written form, with no need for the applicant to specify the reason for the request. The public authority shall reply without delay and within 15 days at the latest. If the requested information entails consequences for the protection of a person's life or freedom, public health and the environment, the time span at the disposal of authorities is reduced to 48 hours. In cases in which the document contains information that the public has no legitimate interest to know, the applicant has the right to access to other parts of the documents. Limitations to the right to access to information are defined in Article 9 of the Law, establishing that legitimate limitation may derive if the requested information exposes to risk the life, health, safety or another vital interest of a person; if it obstacles the work of the judiciary; if it threatens national defense, national and public safety, international relations or the government's ability to manage the national economic processes. Finally, classified information are excluded from the right. The authority in charge of monitoring the respect of the Law is the Commissioner for Information of Public Importance. The Commissioner is an independent, second-level appeal instance: if a public authority does not respond to the request within the deadline, the applicant may lodge a complaint with the Commissioner, except in cases prescribed by this Law (Art.16). The Commissioner is entitled by Law to issue decisions on disputed cases, and his/her decisions should be enforced by the Government of the Republic of Serbia if necessary (Art 28). The Commissioner is appointed by the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia on proposal of the Committee of the National Assembly responsible for information. The position of the Commissioner for Information has been held since 2004 by Rodoljub ≈†abiƒá, who was appointed for an initial 7-years term and then re-elected in 2011. Aside from examining individual complaints related to violations of the right to free access to information, the Commissioner also addresses citizens‚Äô requests asking how to exercise their right to information, provides to state authorities opinions about the implementation of the law, trainings for law implementation and takes part in activities related to the EU accession process. It has been noted that a significant limitation of the right set forth in the Constitution is due to the restrictions applied to the admissibility of complaints against first instance decisions: a complaint is not admissible if ‚Äúlodged against decisions of the National Assembly, the President of the Republic, the Government of the Republic of Serbia, the Supreme Court of Serbia, the Constitutional Court and the Republic Public Prosecutor‚Äù (Art. 22).FreedomInfo.org Access to public information in practice Since the adoption of the Law on Access to Information in 2004, a significant increase in the number of requests has been registered by the entitled Commissioner, pointing to the positive fact that the right is increasing being used by citizens and media professionals in Serbia. At the same time, the increasing number of complaints filed to the Commissioner demonstrates the reluctancy by authorities to timely and fully comply with the obligation established by the Law on access to information. In its annual report for 2015, the Commissioner for Information notes some limitation to the effective implementation of the law. These have to do, according to the Commissioner, particularly with insufficient accountability for violations of the Law and inefficient mechanisms of enforcement of the Commissioner‚Äôs decisions. Considering the implementation of the Law on Access to Information in Serbia and its impact on the exercise of journalism, Freedom House has noted in 2016 that ‚ÄúDespite the existence of the 2004 Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance, authorities frequently obstruct journalists‚Äô efforts to obtain public information‚Äù. Concern over implementation, alignment with European standards, endowment of resources to the Commissioner for Information and enforcement of his decisions is highlighted also by the European Union in its annual report. =Youth Initiative for Human Rights v. Serbia= A landmark case by the European Court of Human Rights related to the right to access to information in Serbia. In 2006, the Belgrade-based NGO Youth Initiative for Human Rights (YIHR) filed a request to the Serbian Security Intelligence Agency demanding information concerning the use of electronic surveillance measures by that agency in 2005. The Agency denied access to the requested information twice, first on grounds of secrecy and then, after a binding decision by the Commissioner for Information stating that the information should be made public, by declaring that it did not hold the requested information. YIHR appealed to the European Court of Human Rights under Article 6 and Article 10 of the Convention. In June 2013, the verdict of the ECtHR defined ‚Äúunpersuasive‚Äù the argument used by the Agency according to which it did not hold the information requested and found that the restrictions imposed by the Serbian intelligence agency were not justified by domestic law and hence constituted a violation of article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

In addition, she gratified by designing interiors of villas for tourists. In the 1969-1972 Valmaggia opened a crafts shop in Palau called ‚ÄúRina Palau‚Äù where she still sold furnitures, but already extended her activity to painted clothing, antiques and Sardinian jewellery. During this period she met priest Giacomino Canu from the parish of Baja Sardinia and developed interest for oil painting. \\"Sea and rocks of Capo Falcone (Stintino)\\" by Vittoria Valmaggia (1977) After marrying Gerardo Conforti - a carabinieri marshal, she moved to Riola Sardo where her husband commanded a local station in the 1973-1977.

Early life, education and career  Philip Scheltens was born in Dordrecht, Netherlands, where he grew up in a family of four. His father led a factory and played an active role in the local society. His grandfather developed Alzheimer‚Äôs disease in those years, which made an important impression on his grandson. Philip attended the Christelijk Lyceum, where he graduated in 1976. As a teenager he was an enthusiastic drummer in several bands and fostered a fascination for science and mechanics. After his graduation, he studied medicine at the Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam, while working night hours as a portiere in a famous Amsterdam nightclub, where he met many Dutch celebrities. He obtained his medical degree in 1984 and started his career in neurology. During his PhD he developed MRI criteria to score hippocampus atrophy for the diagnosis of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.  Achievements  Scheltens‚Äô work has changed the way Alzheimer‚Äôs disease is diagnosed. While diagnosis used to be based on specific signs and symptoms and exclusion of treatable causes, he was the first to add MRI criteria for hippocampal atrophy, associated with Alzheimer‚Äôs‚Äô disease in the 1990s, which improved the diagnostic classification of this type of dementia and fueled development of new diagnostics. He was one of the first in the Netherlands to start a dementia clinic and started the Amsterdam Dementia cohort, currently the largest collection of clinical and biomarker data. This enabled him to initiate, together with colleagues, new diagnostic research criteria for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease based on the presence of a clinical phenotype and the presence of amyloid, as reflected in cerebrospinal fluid. This change from a phenomenological, purely symptom driven, diagnosis to a diagnosis based on biomarkers greatly enhanced sensitivity and specificity. Higher diagnostic precision is the crucial step to develop effective therapy, as patients with homogeneous underlying pathology can be included for therapeutic trials targeting the causative mechanism. The new protein-based diagnostic criteria he fathered are now implemented for trials worldwide and the first hopeful results have emerged. Scheltens has improved societal awareness and acceptance of dementia, and prioritized dementia among the top necessities on the Dutch and European research agenda. He initiated a large scientific and societal action plan to improve prevention, treatment and care for dementia in the Netherlands, entitled Deltaplan Dementie in 2012, which has already supported a large number of research projects on dementia, increased societal awareness and improved health care for dementia patients. In 2011 Scheltens became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In November 2018 Expertscape recognized Dr. Scheltens as #6 in the world for expertise in Alzheimer's Disease.

This sometimes includes \\"scientific, indigenous, and traditional knowledge; freedom of information, building of open knowledge resources, including open Internet and open standards, and open access and availability of data; preservation of digital heritage; respect for cultural and linguistic diversity, such as fostering access to local content in accessible languages; quality education for all, including lifelong and e-learning; diffusion of new media and information literacy and skills, and social inclusion online, including addressing inequalities based on skills, education, gender, age, race, ethnicity, and accessibility by those with disabilities; and the development of connectivity and affordable ICTs, including mobile, the Internet, and broadband infrastructures\\". Michael Buckland defines six types of barriers that have to be overcome in order for access to information to be achieved: identification of the source, availability of the source, price of the user, cost to the provider, cognitive access, acceptability. While \\"access to information\\", \\"right to information\\", \\"right to know\\" and \\"freedom of information\\" are sometimes used as synonyms, the diverse terminology does highlight particular (albeit related) dimensions of the issue.  Overview  There has been a signiÔ¨Åcant increase in access to the Internet, which reached just over three billion users in 2014, amounting to about 42 per cent of the world's population. But the digital divide continues to exclude over half of the world's population, particularly women and girls, and especially in Africa and the Least Developed Countries as well as several Small Island Developing States. Further, individuals with disabilities can either be advantaged or further disadvantaged by the design of technologies or through the presence or absence of training and education.  Context  =The digital divide= Access to information faces great difficulties because of the global digital divide. A digital divide is an economic and social inequality with regard to access to, use of, or impact of information and communication technologies (ICT). The divide within countries (such as the digital divide in the United States) may refer to inequalities between individuals, households, businesses, or geographic areas, usually at different socioeconomic levels or other demographic categories. The divide between differing countries or regions of the world is referred to as the global digital divide, examining this technological gap between developing and developed countries on an international scale.  Racial divide  Although many groups in society are affected by a lack of access to computers or the internet, communities of color are specifically observed to be negatively affected by the digital divide. This is evident when it comes to observing home-internet access among different races and ethnicities. 81% of Whites and 83% of Asians have home internet access, compared to 70% of Hispanics, 68% of Blacks, 72% of American Indian/Alaska Natives, and 68% of Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders. Although income is a factor in home- internet access disparities, there are still racial and ethnic inequalities that are present among those within lower income groups. 58% of low income Whites are reported to have home-internet access in comparison to 51% of Hispanics and 50% of Blacks. This information is reported in a report titled ‚ÄúDigital Denied: The Impact of Systemic Racial Discrimination on Home-Internet Adoption‚Äù which was published by the DC-based public interest group Fress Press. The report concludes that structural barriers and discrimination that perpetuates bias against people of different races and ethnicities contribute to having an impact on the digital divide. The report also concludes that those who do not have internet access still have a high demand for it, and reduction in the price of home-internet access would allow for an increase in equitable participation and improve internet adoption by marginalized groups.https://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/legacy- policy/digital_denied_free_press_report_december_2016.pdf Digital censorship and algorithmic bias are observed to be present in the racial divide. Hate- speech rules as well as hate speech algorithms online platforms such as Facebook have favored white males and those belonging to elite groups in society over marginalized groups in society, such as women and people of color. In a collection of internal documents that were collected in a project conducted by ProPublica, Facebook‚Äôs guidelines in regards to distinguishing hate speech and recognizing protected groups revealed slides that identified three groups, each one containing either female drivers, black children, or white men. When the question of which subset group is protected is presented, the correct answer was white men. Minority group language is negatively impacted by automated tools of hate detection due to human bias that ultimately decides what is considered hate speech and what is not. Online platforms have also been observed to tolerate hateful content towards people of color but restrict content from people of color. Aboriginal memes on a Facebook page were posted with racially abusive content and comments depicting Aboriginal people as inferior. While the contents on the page were removed by the originators after an investigation conducted by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, Facebook did not delete the page and has allowed it to remain under the classification of controversial humor. However, a post by an African American woman addressing her uncomfortableness of being the only person of color in a small-town restaurant was met with racist and hateful messages. When reporting the online abuse to Facebook, her account was suspended by Facebook for three days for posting the screenshots while those responsible for the racist comments she received were not suspended. Shared experiences between people of color can be at risk of being silenced under removal policies for online platforms.  Disability divide  Inequities in access to information technologies are present among individuals living with a disability in comparison to those who are not living with a disability. According to The Pew Internet 54% of households with a person who has a disability have home internet access compared to 81% of households that have home internet access and do not have a person who has a disability. The type of disability an individual has can prevent one from interacting with computer screens and smartphone screens, such as having a quadriplegia disability or having a disability in the hands. However, there is still a lack of access to technology and home internet access among those who have a cognitive and auditory disability as well. There is a concern of whether or not the increase in the use of information technologies will increase equality through offering opportunities for individuals living with disabilities or whether it will only add to the present inequalities and lead to individuals living with disabilities being left behind in society. Issues such as the perception of disabilities in society, Federal and state government policy, corporate policy, mainstream computing technologies, and real-time online communication have been found to contribute to the impact of the digital divide on individuals with disabilities. People with disabilities are also the targets of online abuse. Online disability hate crimes have increased by 33% within the past year across the UK according to a report published by Leonard Cheshire.org. Accounts of online hate abuse towards people with disabilities were shared during an incident in 2019 when model Katie Price's son was the target of online abuse that was attributed to him having a disability. In response to the abuse, a campaign was launched by Katie Price to ensure that Britain's MP's held those who are guilty of perpetuating online abuse towards those with disabilities accountable. Online abuse towards individuals with disabilities is a factor that can discourage people from engaging online which could prevent people from learning information that could improve their lives. Many individuals living with disabilities face online abuse in the form of accusations of benefit fraud and \\"faking\\" their disability for financial gain, which in some cases leads to unnecessary investigations. =Gender divide= Women's freedom of information and access to information globally is less than men's. Social barriers such as illiteracy and lack of digital empowerment have created stark inequalities in navigating the tools used for access to information, often exacerbating lack of awareness of issues that directly relate to women and gender, such as sexual health. There have also been examples of more extreme measures, such as local community authorities banning or restricting mobile phone use for girls and unmarried women in their communities. According to the Wharton School of Public Policy, the expansion of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has resulted in multiple disparities that have had an impact on women's access to ICT with the gender gap being as high as 31% in some developing countries and 12% globally in 2016. Socioeconomic barriers that result from these disparities are known as what we call the digital divide. Among low-income countries and low-income regions alike, the high price of internet access presents a barrier to women since women are generally paid less and face an unequal dividend between paid and unpaid work. Cultural norms in certain countries may prohibit women from access to the internet and technology as well by preventing women from attaining a certain level of education or from being the breadwinners in their households, thus resulting in a lack of control in the household finances. However, even when women have access to ICT, the digital divide is still prevalent. =LGBTQIA divide, and repression by states and tech companies= A number of states, including some that have introduced new laws since 2010, notably censor voices from and content related to the LGBTQI community, posing serious consequences to access to information about sexual orientation and gender identity. Digital platforms play a powerful role in limiting access to certain content, such as YouTube's 2017 decision to classify non-explicit videos with LGBTQIA themes as 'restricted', a classification designed to filter out \\"potentially inappropriate content\\". The internet provides information that can create a safe space for marginalized groups such as the LGBTQIA community to connect with others and engage in honest dialogues and conversations that are affecting their communities. It can also be viewed as an agent of change for the LGBTQIA community and provide a means of engaging in social justice. It can allow for LGBTQIA individuals who may be living in rural areas or in areas where they are isolated to gain access to information that are not within their rural system as well as gaining information from other LGBT individuals. This includes information such as healthcare, partners, and news. GayHealth provides online medical and health information and Gay and Lesbians Alliance Against Defamation contains online publications and news that focus on human rights campaigns and issues focused on LGBTQIA issues. The Internet also allows LGBTQIA individuals to maintain anonymity. Lack of access to the internet can hinder these things, due to lack of broadband access in remote rural areas. LGBT Tech has emphasized launching newer technologies with 5G technology in order to help close the digital divide that can cause members of the LGBTQIA community to lose access to reliable and fast technology that can provide information on healthcare, economic opportunities, and safe communities.https://www.lgbttech.org/single- post/2018/06/29/5G-Technologies-Crucial-to-Closing-the-Digital-Divide There are also other factors that can prevent LGBTQIA members from accessing information online or subject them to having their information abused. Internet filters are also used to censor and restrict LGBTQIA content that is in relation to the LGBTQIA community in public schools and libraries. There is also the presence of online abuse by online predators that target LGBTQIA members by seeking out their personal information and providing them with inaccurate information. The use of the internet can provide a way for LGBTQIA individuals to gain access to information to deal with societal setbacks through therapeutic advice, social support systems, and an online environment that fosters a collaboration of ideas, concerns, and helps LGBTQIA individuals move forward. This can be fostered through human service professionals who can utilize the internet with evidence and evaluation to provide information to LGBTQIA individuals who are dealing with the circumstances of coming out and the possible repercussions that could follow as a result. = The security argument = With the evolution of the digital age, application of freedom of speech and its corollaries (freedom of information, access to information) becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise including government control or commercial methods putting personal information to danger. Digital access =Information and media literacy= According to Kuzmin and Parshakova, access to information entails learning in formal and informal education settings. It also entails fostering the competencies of information and media literacy that enable users to be empowered and make full use of access to the Internet.UNESCO (2013a), UNESCO Communication and Information Sector with UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Global Media and Information Literacy Assessment Framework: Country Readiness and Competencies. Paris: UNESCO The UNESCO's support for journalism education is an example of how UNESCO seeks to contribute to the provision of independent and veriÔ¨Åable information accessible in cyberspace. Promoting access for disabled persons has been strengthened by the UNESCO-convened conference in 2014, which adopted the \\"New Delhi Declaration on Inclusive ICTs for Persons with Disabilities: Making Empowerment a Reality‚Äù. =Open standards= According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), \\"\\"Open Standards\\" are standards made available to the general public and developed (or approved) and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process. \\"Open Standards\\" facilitate interoperability and data exchange among different products or services and are intended for widespread adoption.\\" A UNESCO study considers that adopting open standards has the potential to contribute to the vision of a ‚Äòdigital commons‚Äô in which citizens can freely Ô¨Ånd, share, and re-use information. Promoting open source software, which is both free of cost and freely modiÔ¨Åable could help meet the particular needs of marginalized users advocacy on behalf of minority groups, such as targeted outreach, better provision of Internet access, tax incentives for private companies and organizations working to enhance access, and solving underlying issues of social and economic inequalities  Privacy protections  = Privacy, surveillance and encryption = The increasing access to and reliance on digital media to receive and produce information have increased the possibilities for States and private sector companies to track individuals‚Äô behaviors, opinions and networks. States have increasingly adopted laws and policies to legalize monitoring of communication, justifying these practices with the need to defend their own citizens and national interests. In parts of Europe, new anti-terrorism laws have enabled a greater degree of government surveillance and an increase in the ability of intelligence authorities to access citizens‚Äô data. While legality is a precondition for legitimate limitations of human rights, the issue is also whether a given law is aligned to other criteria for justification such as necessity, proportionality and legitimate purpose.  International framework  The United Nations Human Rights Council has taken a number of steps to highlight the importance of the universal right to privacy online. In 2015, in a resolution on the right to privacy in the digital age, it established a United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Privacy.UN Human Rights Council. 2016.

The Council of Europe‚Äôs Convention 108, the Convention for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data, has undergone a modernization process to address new challenges to privacy. Since 2012, four new countries belonging to the Council of Europe have signed or ratified the Convention, as well as three countries that do not belong to the Council, from Africa and Latin America.Council of Europe. 2017.

Regional courts are also playing a noteworthy role in the development of online privacy regulations. In 2015 the European Court of Justice found that the so-called ‚ÄòSafe Harbour Agreement‚Äô, which allowed private companies to ‚Äòlegally transmit personal data from their European subscribers to the US‚Äô, was not valid under European law in that it did not offer sufficient protections for the data of European citizens or protect them from arbitrary surveillance. In 2016, the European Commission and United States Government reached an agreement to replace Safe Harbour, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which includes data protection obligations on companies receiving personal data from the European Union, safeguards on United States government access to data, protection and redress for individuals, and an annual joint review to monitor implementation. The European Court of Justice's 2014 decision in the Google Spain case allowed people to claim a \\"right to be forgotten\\" or \\"right to be de-listed\\" in a much-debated approach to the balance between privacy, free expression and transparency.Cannataci, Joseph A., Bo Zhao, Gemma Torres Vives, Shara Monteleone, Jeanne Mifsud Bonnici, and Evgeni Moyakine. 2016. \\"Privacy, free expression and transparency: Redefining their new boundaries in the digital age\\".

The internet has registered the highest growth in users supported by massive investments in infrastructure and significant uptake in mobile usage. = Internet mobile = The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the work of the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development, co-chaired by UNESCO, and the Internet Governance Forum‚Äôs intersessional work on ‚ÄòConnecting the Next Billion' are proof of the international commitments towards providing Internet access for all. According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), by the end of 2017, an estimated 48 per cent of individuals regularly connect to the internet, up from 34 per cent in 2012. Despite the significant increase in absolute numbers, however, in the same period the annual growth rate of internet users has slowed down, with five per cent annual growth in 2017, dropping from a 10 per cent growth rate in 2012. The number of unique mobile cellular subscriptions increased from 3.89 billion in 2012 to 4.83 billion in 2016, two-thirds of the world‚Äôs population, with more than half of subscriptions located in Asia and the Pacific. The number of subscriptions is predicted to rise to 5.69 billion users in 2020. As of 2016, almost 60 per cent of the world‚Äôs population had access to a 4G broadband cellular network, up from almost 50 per cent in 2015 and 11 per cent in 2012. The limits that users face on accessing information via mobile applications coincide with a broader process of fragmentation of the internet. Zero-rating, the practice of internet providers allowing users free connectivity to access specific content or applications for free, has offered some opportunities for individuals to surmount economic hurdles, but has also been accused by its critics as creating a ‚Äòtwo-tiered‚Äô internet. To address the issues with zero-rating, an alternative model has emerged in the concept of ‚Äòequal rating‚Äô and is being tested in experiments by Mozilla and Orange in Africa. Equal rating prevents prioritization of one type of content and zero-rates all content up to a specified data cap. Some countries in the region had a handful of plans to choose from (across all mobile network operators) while others, such as Colombia, offered as many as 30 pre-paid and 34 post-paid plans. Percentage of individuals using the internet 2012‚Äì2017 = Broadcast media = In Western Europe and North America, the primacy of television as a main source of information is being challenged by the internet, while in other regions, such as Africa, television is gaining greater audience share than radio, which has historically been the most widely accessed media platform. Age plays a profound role in determining the balance between radio, television and the internet as the leading source of news. According to the 2017 Reuters Institute Digital News Report, in 36 countries and territories surveyed, 51 per cent of adults 55 years and older consider television as their main news source, compared to only 24 per cent of respondents between 18 and 24.Newman, Nic, Richard Fletcher, Antonis Kalogeropoulos, David A.

Its mandate since 2003 is \\"... to contribute to sustainable development, democracy and good governance by fostering universal access to and distribution of information and knowledge by strengthening the capacities of the developing countries and countries in transition in the field of electronic media and the printed press.Amendments to the Statutes of the International Programme for The Development of Communication (IPDC) Resolution 43/32, adopted on the Report of Commission V at the 18th Plenary Meeting, on 15 October 2003. The International Programme for the Development of Communication is responsible for the follow-up of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 through indicators 16.10.1 and 16.10.2. Every two years, a report containing information from the Member States on the status of judicial inquiries on each of the killings condemned by UNESCO is submitted to the IPDC Council by UNESCO's Director-General. The journalists safety indicators are a tool developed by UNESCO which, according to UNESCO's website, aims on mapping the key features that can help assess safety of journalists, and help determine whether adequate follow-up is given to crimes committed against them. The IPDC Talks also allow the Programme to raise awareness on the importance of access to information. The IPDC is also the programme that monitors and reports on access to information laws around the world through the United Nations Secretary-General global report on follow-up to SDGs. On 28 September 2015, UNESCO adopted the International Day for the Universal Access to Information during its 38th session. During the International Day, the IPDC organized the \\"IPDC Talks: Powering Sustainable Development with Access to Information‚Äù event, which gathered high-level participants. The annual event aims on highlighting the \\"importance of access to information\\" for sustainable development.  The Internet Universality framework  Internet Universality is the concept that \\"the Internet is much more than infrastructure and applications, it is a network of economic and social interactions and relationships, which has the potential to enable human rights, empower individuals and communities, and facilitate sustainable development. The concept is based on four principles stressing the Internet should be Human rights-based, Open, Accessible, and based on Multistakeholder participation. These have been abbreviated as the R-O-A-M principles. Understanding the Internet in this way helps to draw together different facets of Internet development, concerned with technology and public policy, rights and development.\\" Through the concept internet universality UNESCO highlights access to information as a key to assess a better Internet environment. There is special relevance to the Internet of the broader principle of social inclusion. This puts forward the role of accessibility in overcoming digital divides, digital inequalities, and exclusions based on skills, literacy, language, gender or disability. It also points to the need for sustainable business models for Internet activity, and to trust in the preservation, quality, integrity, security, and authenticity of information and knowledge. Accessibility is interlinked to rights and openness. Based on the ROAM principles, UNESCO is now developing Internet Universality indicators to help governments and other stakeholders assess their own national Internet environments and to promote the values associated with Internet Universality, such as access to information. = The World Bank initiatives = In 2010, the World Bank launched the World Bank policy on access to information, which constitutes a major shift in the World Bank's strategy. The principle binds the World Bank to disclose any requested information, unless it is on a \\"list of exception\\": # \\"Personal information # Communications of Governors and/or Executive Directors‚Äô Offices # Ethics Committee # Attorney-Client Privilege # Security and Safety Information # Separate Disclosure Regimes # Confidential Client/Third Party Information # Corporate Administrative # Deliberative Information* # Financial Information\\" The World Bank is prone to Open Developments with its Open data, Open Finance and Open knowledge repository. = The World Summit on the Information Societies = The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) was a two-phase United Nations-sponsored summit on information, communication and, in broad terms, the information society that took place in 2003 in Geneva and in 2005 in Tunis. One of its chief aims was to bridge the global digital divide separating rich countries from poor countries by spreading access to the Internet in the developing world. The conferences established 17 May as World Information Society Day.  Regional framework  The results from UNESCO monitoring of SDG 16.10.2 show that 112 countries have now adopted freedom of information legislation or similar administrative regulations.freedominfo.org 2016. Of these, 22 adopted new legislation since 2012. At the regional level, Africa has seen the highest growth, with 10 countries adopting freedom of information legislation in the last five years, more than doubling the number of countries in the region to have such legislation from nine to 19. A similarly high growth rate has occurred in the Asia-Pacific region, where seven countries adopted freedom of information laws in the last five years, bringing the total to 22. In addition, during the reporting period, two countries in the Arab region, two countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and one country in Western Europe and North America adopted freedom of information legislation. The vast majority of the world's population now lives in a country with a freedom of information law, and several countries currently have freedom of information bills under consideration.

The Global Right to Information Rating is a programme providing advocates, legislators, reformers with tools to assess the strength of a legal framework.

Retrieved 24 May 2017. According to the United Nations Secretary General‚Äôs 2017 report on the Sustainable Development Goals, to which UNESCO contributed freedom of information-related information, of the 109 countries with available data on implementation of freedom of information laws, 43 per cent do not sufficiently provide for public outreach and 43 per cent have overly-wide definitions of exceptions to disclosure, which run counter to the aim of increased transparency and accountability. Despite the adoption of freedom of information laws; officials are often unfamiliar with the norms of transparency at the core of freedom of information or are unwilling to recognize them in practice. Journalists often do not make effective use of freedom of information laws for a multitude of reasons: official failure to respond to information requests, extensive delays, receipt of heavily redacted documents, arbitrarily steep fees for certain types of requests, and a lack of professional training. Debates around public access to information have also focused on further developments in encouraging open data approaches to government transparency. In 2009, the data.gov portal was launched in the United States, collecting in one place most of the government open data; in the years following, there was a wave of government data opening around the world. As part of the Open Government Partnership, a multilateral network established in 2011, some 70 countries have now issued National Action Plans, the majority of which contain strong open data commitments designed to foster greater transparency, generate economic growth, empower citizens, fight corruption and more generally enhance governance.

An official remake of the 2010 Korean film My Dear Desperado, which was also remade in Hindi as Jayantabhai Ki Luv Story in 2013, the film was released on 11 March 2016 to positive reviews. Plot Kathiravan (Vijay Sethupathi) is a rowdy who works for a local area councillor (G. M. Sundar). His only aim in life is to own a bar of his own. He had just been released from prison after serving a five-year sentence for taking the blame for a crime he did not commit on the orders of the councillor. Kathir did the deed on the promise that his status within the councillor's gang will be elevated once he is released, but the promise was reneged. Meanwhile, a young Villupuram-based engineering graduate Yazhini Bakthirajan (Madonna Sebastian), leaves for Chennai against her parents' wishes to pursue a career in the IT sector. When the company she works for shuts down suddenly five months later, she faces financial hardship and is forced to move into a low-cost housing colony while searching for a new job. Her neighbour is Kathir. Though both of them dislike each other in the beginning, they gradually warm up to each other despite their different backgrounds and become a sort of symbiotic support system for one another. Facing pressure from her family over her career and wedding, Yazhini introduces Kathir to her parents as her boyfriend who is a successful manager in an IT firm. Her parents decide to fix their marriage but change their mind after seeing Kathir thrashing two men opposite a temple, realising that he is a rowdy. They bar Yazhini from returning to Chennai, even forbidding her to attend an important job interview. Meanwhile, Kathir starts a gang war by beating up the henchmen of a rival gangster Kumar (Samuthirakani). The councillor decides that Kathir should murder Kumar. After ensuring that Yazhini attends her interview, Kathir proceeds with the plan to murder Kumar. However, during the ensuing scuffle, Kathir ends up being stabbed with a rebar and is left to bleed to death. Two years later, Yazhini has become a director in her company and has moved out of the housing colony. She constantly thinks about Kathir, whom she had never seen again after her interview. Yazhini yearns to show Kathir her new life, knowing that he is the one person who will be happier than even herself in her having achieved her dreams. She soon finds Kathir working at a petrol bunk, having survived his murder attempt and abandoned his rowdy past. The two rejoice in the happy ending.

They became nationally infamous by advertising for someone to commit suicide live on stage for which the band would pay them ¬£15,000. Early history and record In 1974 bass player Matt Smith joined with vocalist and guitar Robert Fern and drummer Johnny Harrison in a band called Maniac, which was later changed to Anti- Social. After gigging for a while, they recorded what would turn out to be a rare UK punk rock single release, \\"Traffic Lights\\" backed with \\"Teacher, Teacher\\" at Outlaw Recording Studios in Birmingham. The single was released on the Dynamite Label (DR01) in 1977. Paul Morley reviewed their single in NME in January 1978, calling it \\"archaic rock song sneered with incongruous, but violently necessary contempt.\\" Matt Smith left during these sessions (now married to Carolyn Spence who worked at UK's Sounds magazine) Matt felt that the constant aggression associated with the band was no longer to his liking and was replaced first by Paul Cooper and then by Gabrielle Fern. Suicide offer The band's label manager, Bob Green, offered ¬£15,000 to any volunteer who would commit suicide live on stage via a guillotine. Nobody took the offer but the Department Of Public Prosecutions was angered and the band was arrested. Epitaph Band's manager Les Hemmings died in a car crash in the 1970s, while delivering copies of the single to various shops. The Studio Recordings to their follow up single were stolen and their final gig (at the Kingshurst Labour Club) ended with drummer Harrison playing a drum solo on an audience member's head, an offense for which he was later arrested and charged. Harrison phoned Rob Fern the next day to inquire as to whether he was still in the band, to which Fern replied, \\"There is no band\\". The 7 inch record now sells for upward of ¬£500 and has thus led to bootleg copies swamping the market (easy to recognize as they have the release date of 1978 instead of original 1977 and have incorrect label credits).

Life and work Victor Langlois was born on rue Sygogne in Dieppe, France on 20 March 1829. He was educated at the √âcole Nationale des Chartes and Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales. On 7 May 1852, at the age of 23, he received orders from the French government to visit the predominantly Armenian populated area of Cilicia in the Ottoman Empire to carry out studies about historic French and Armenian relations. In particular, Langlois was tasked with studying Armenian-French relations during the Crusades, and to uncover archaeological findings. Remaining in Cilicia until 1853, Langlois published a book on his findings in 1861 entitled Voyage dans la Cilicie et dans les montagnes du Taurus (Travels in Cilicia and the Taurus Mountains). Terracotta figures which he had found in his excavations in the necropolis of Tarsus were exhibited in the Louvre. Between the year 1857 and 1861, Langlois traveled in Italy in order to discover more historical information concerning the relations between France and Armenia during the Crusades. His other works relate to Egyptian and Georgian numismatics (1852), and to the convent of San Lazzaro degli Armeni of the Armenian Mekhitarist congregation, with an outline of Armenian history and literature (1862). During this time, in 1863, he published a book about the massacres of Armenians by Turks entitled Les Arm√©niens de la Turquie et les Massacres du Taurus (The Armenians of Turkey and the Taurus massacres). In 1867 he published (\\"Mount Athos and its monasteries\\"), with a photo-lithographic reproduction of the geography of Ptolemy, of which the Greek manuscript of the 17th century is preserved in that monastery. He became a professor at the Coll√®ge de France in Paris. The first volume of his Collection des historiens anciens et modernes de l'Arm√©nie, a translation from the Armenian language, was published in 1868, under the auspices of the Egyptian-Armenian prime minister Nubar Pasha, but he did not live to complete the work.

Maxman (born 30 December 1938) is an American architect who founded a firm called Susan Maxman Architects in 1985, which she expanded to Susan Maxman & Partners Ltd in 1995. Her firm is associated with a large number of projects involving a wide spectrum of architectural services, including design of old and new buildings, restoration and rehabilitation works, master and site planning, feasibility reports, programming, historic preservation, and interior design. She was the first woman elected as president of the American Institute of Architects in 1992. Her expertise in adoption of the \\"principles of sustainable design\\" in her projects has received national appreciation, and in 2011 Maxman was nominated by President Barack Obama to the Board of Directors of the National Institute of Building Sciences. Early life Maxman was born on 30 December 1938 in Columbus, Ohio, to Gussie Seiden of Palm Beach and Richard J. Abel of Miami Beach. Her older siblings were twin sisters. When she completed her high school studies at the Columbus School for Girls, Maxman continued her education at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, graduating in two years. She married Leonard Frankel in 1958 and, subsequently, they had three children: Andrew, Thomas, and Elizabeth. In 1965 the couple commissioned Philadelphia architect Louis Sauer, to design a weekend home for them in New Jersey, an event that would be instrumental to Maxman‚Äôs decision to eventually pursue architecture herself. Maxman and Frankel later divorced and she married William Maxman, father of three children from an earlier marriage. The six children lived together and were compared to the \\"blended family\\" of The Brady Bunch. With six school-age children, Maxman restarted her college education in the 1970s to qualify as an architect and enrolled as a student of Louis Kahn at the University of Pennsylvania, obtaining her Master of Architecture degree in 1977. Professional career After obtaining her master's degree in architecture in 1977, Maxman started her professional career as an architect with Kopple Sheward and Day. In 1980, she formed a partnership firm with architect Ann Sutphin, a former classmate at the University of Pennsylvania, called Maxman Sutphin Architects, but in 1985 she opened a solo firm called Susan Maxman Architects. After a decade, she expanded the firm to Susan Maxman & Partners Ltd, associating four architects with the business. Maxman's early assignments were historic conservation and rehabilitation projects. She completed a restoration of the Girl Scout's Camp Tweedale in Oxford, Pennsylvania, and was honored by an AIA Award. The recognition led to other contracts from the Episcopal Church and the Girl Scouts and to many projects from NGOs, academic institutions, government organizations, and cultural organizations, which established her expertise in \\"sustainable design\\". Restoration of the Immaculate Heart of Mary Motherhouse in Monroe, Michigan, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service's Cusano Environmental Education Center in Philadelphia are some of the notable projects executed by her firm. Another assignment credited to her firm is known as \\"manufactured home\\" or prefabricated homes that are transported and erected at sites in urban areas, which was implemented in 1997 for the Manufactured Housing Institute. These houses are two storied and single storied buildings built at affordable cost which were erected in Wilkinsburg, Washington, D.C. and Louisville. These houses did not differ in their looks from other in situ-built houses in the neighborhood. William Maxman had died in 1997 and in 2001 she remarried. Her new husband, Rolf Sauer, was an architect from Philadelphia and had one daughter by an earlier marriage. Thus, Maxman has seven children, three of her own and four step children. She has 15 grandchildren. Memberships Maxman joined the American Institute of Architecture (AIA) in 1980. From 1981 to 1987 she served on the Board of Directors of the Philadelphia chapter of AIA and in 1987, she became president of the Pennsylvania Society of Architects, establishing a regional magazine for them. From 1983 to 1986, she was on the AIA's Women in Architecture Committee and served as its chair in 1985. Maxman served on the national AIA Board of Directors from 1989 to 1991. She was elected the 69th AIA president‚Äîthe first women to hold this position in the 134-year history of AIA‚Äîwhich was notable because the first women member, Louise Bethune, had been enrolled 103 years earlier in 1883. In regards to her role as the first woman president of the organization, Maxman later wrote: > It was never in my game plan at all to be president of the AIA. I just was > not interested, though I was interested in promoting my ideas and trying to > get the profession to look at things differently. I became interested when I > talked to women architects around the country. I had been involved in the > Women in Architecture group at the AIA and when I saw how women felt about > the profession at the time, how hostile it was for them, and how downtrodden > they were, I thought the best way to show them that you can do whatever you > want if you want to do it hard enough is by example. You can get beyond the > barriers and go forward and not think about being a woman, just about being > the best you can be at something. In 1992, she represented the AIA at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. As president of AIA, in one of the interviews Maxman elaborated on the theme of sustainability in architectural designs stating: > What's so annoying is that it's not new ... It's just that we've forgotten > everything that we used to know as common sense. We don't use common sense > anymore because when man started to control his environment by [artificial > heating and cooling systems] ..., it freed us up and we forgot that wasn't > really a very sustainable way to design. In 1993, as President of the AIA, Maxman presided over the joint convention of the American Institute of Architects and the International Union of Architects (UIA), the largest gathering of architects to date, drawing an estimated 5,000 architects from more than 85 countries, Argentina to Zimbabwe to Chicago for the World Congress of Architects. Recognition and awards Maxman's firm has received many awards and recognition for their designs. Of their 65 awards, 14 were AIA design awards and another 14 were honored for their environmental importance. Maxman's professional recognition of membership and awards include the following: *College of Fellows, AIA *Honorary fellow, Royal Architectural Institute of Canada *Member of Honor, La Federaci√≥n de Colegios de Arquitectos de la Rep√∫blica M√©xicana *Honorary doctorate, Ball State University *Honorary doctorate, University of Detroit-Mercy *Distinguished Daughter of Pennsylvania *Thomas U.

During the Syrian Civil War that began in 2011, a Kurdish-dominated coalition led by the Democratic Union Party as well as some other Kurdish, Arab, Syriac-Assyrian and Turkmen groups have sought to establish a new constitution for the de facto autonomous region, while military wings and allied militias have fought to maintain control of the region. This led to the establishment of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (NES) in 2016. Supporters of the NES state that the events constitute a social revolution with a prominent role played by women both on the battlefield and within the newly formed political system, as well as the implementation of democratic confederalism, a form of libertarian socialism that emphasizes decentralization, gender equality and the need for local governance through semi-direct democracy. Background 2013 VOA report about the Kurdish situation in Syria =State discrimination= Repression of the Kurds and other ethnic minorities has gone on since the creation of the French Mandate of Syria after the Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement. The Syrian government (officially known as the Syrian Arab Republic) never officially acknowledged the existence of the Kurds and in 1962, 120,000 Syrian Kurds were stripped of their citizenship, leaving them stateless. The Kurdish language and culture have also been suppressed. The government attempted to resolve these issues in 2011 by granting all Kurds citizenship, but only an estimated 6,000 out of 150,000 stateless Kurds have been given nationality and most discriminatory regulations, including the ban on teaching Kurdish, are still on the books. Due to the Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, the government is no longer in a position to enforce these laws. =Qamishli uprising= In 2004, riots broke out against the government in the northeastern city of Qamishli. During a soccer match between a local Kurdish team and a visiting Arab team from Deir ez-Zor, some Arab fans brandished portraits of Saddam Hussein, who killed tens of thousands of Kurds in Southern Kurdistan during the Al-Anfal campaign in the 1980s. Tensions quickly escalated into open protests, with Kurds raising their flag and taking to the streets to demand cultural and political rights. Security forces fired into the crowd, killing six Kurds, including three children. Protesters went on to burn down the Ba'ath Party's local office. At least 30 and as many as 100 Kurds were killed by the government before the protests were quelled. Thousands of Kurds then fled to Iraq, where a refugee camp was established. Occasional clashes between Kurdish protesters and government forces occurred in the following years. The path to self-governed Rojava =Syrian Civil War= Kurds, Assyrians, and Arabs demonstrate against the Syrian government in Qamishli, 6 January 2012 In 2011, the Arab Spring spread to Syria. In an echo of the Tunisian revolution, Syrian citizen Hasan Ali Akleh soaked himself in gasoline and set himself on fire in the northern city of Al-Hasakah. This inspired activists to call for a \\"Day of Rage\\", which was sparsely attended, mostly because of fear of repression from the Syrian government. Days later, however, protests again took place, this time in response to the police beating of a shopkeeper. Smaller protests continued, and on 7 March 2011, thirteen political prisoners went on hunger strike, and momentum began to grow against the Assad government. Three days later dozens of Syrian Kurds went on hunger strike in solidarity. On 12 March, major protests took place in Qamishli and Al-Hasakah to both protest the Assad government and commemorate Kurdish Martyrs Day. Protests grew over the months of March and April 2011. The Assad government attempted to appease Kurds by promising to grant citizenship to thousands of Kurds, who until that time had been stripped of any legal status. By the summer, protests had only intensified, as did violent crackdowns by the Syrian government. Ras al-Ayn and a series of other towns in northern Syria were partially captured by the YPG in 2012 (Battle of Ras al- Ayn depicted). In August, a coalition of opposition groups formed the Syrian National Council in hopes of creating a democratic, pluralistic alternative to the Assad government. But internal fighting and disagreement over politics and inclusion plagued the group from its beginnings. In the fall of 2011 the popular uprising escalated to an armed conflict. The Free Syrian Army (FSA) began to coalesce and armed insurrection spread, largely across central and southern Syria. =Kurdish parties negotiate= The National Movement of Kurdish Parties in Syria, a coalition of Syria's 12 Kurdish parties, boycotted a Syrian opposition summit in Antalya, Turkey on 31 May 2011, stating that \\"any such meeting held in Turkey can only be a detriment to the Kurds in Syria, because Turkey is against the aspirations of the Kurds\\". During the August summit in Istanbul, which led to the creation of the Syrian National Council, only two of the parties in the National Movement of Kurdish Parties in Syria, the Kurdish Union Party and the Kurdish Freedom Party, attended the summit. Anti-government protests had been ongoing in the Kurdish-inhabited areas of Syria since March 2011, as part of the wider Syrian uprising, but clashes started after the opposition Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) and Kurdish National Council (KNC) signed a seven-point agreement on 11 June 2012 in Erbil under the auspice of Iraqi Kurdistan president Massoud Barzani. This agreement, however, failed to be implemented and so a new cooperation agreement between the two sides was signed on 12 July which saw the creation of the Kurdish Supreme Committee as a governing body of all Kurdish-controlled territories in Syria. =YPG claims territory= The People's Protection Units (YPG) entered the conflict by capturing the city of Koban√Æ on 19 July 2012, followed by the capture of Amuda and Efr√Æn on 20 July. The cities fell without any major clashes, as Syrian security forces withdrew without any significant resistance. The Syrian Army pulled out to fight elsewhere. The KNC and PYD then formed a joint leadership council to run the captured cities. The YPG forces continued with their advancement and on 21 July captured Al-Malikiyah (), which lies 10 kilometers from the Turkish border. The forces at the time also intended to capture Qamishli, the largest Syrian city with a Kurdish majority. On the same day, the Syrian government attacked a patrol of Kurdish YPG members and wounded one fighter. The next day it was reported that Kurdish forces were still fighting for Al-Malikiyah, where one young Kurdish activist was killed after government security forces opened fire on protesters. The YPG also took control over the towns of Ra's al-'Ayn () and Al-Darbasiyah (), after the security and political units withdrew from these areas, following an ultimatum issued by the Kurds. On the same day, clashes erupted in Qamishli between YPG and government forces in which one Kurdish fighter was killed and two were wounded along with one government official. The ease with which YPG forces captured the towns and the government troops pulled back was stated to have been because the government reached an agreement with the Kurds so military forces from the area could be freed up to engage opposition forces in the rest of the country. On 24 July, the PYD announced that Syrian security forces had withdrawn from the small Kurdish city of 16,000 of Al-Ma'bada (), between Al-Malikiyah and the Turkish borders. The YPG forces then took control of all government institutions. =Self-governed Rojava established= On 1 August 2012, state security forces on the periphery of the country were pulled into the intensifying battle taking place in Aleppo. During this large withdrawal from the north, the YPG took control of at least parts of Qamishli, Efrin, Amude, Dirbesiye and Koban√Æ with very little conflict or casualties. On 2 August 2012, the National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change announced that most Kurdish-majority cities in Syria, except Qamishli and Hasaka, were no longer controlled by government forces and were now being governed by Kurdish political parties. In Qamishli, government military and police forces remained in their barracks and administration officials in the city allowed the Kurdish flag to be raised. After months of de facto rule, the PYD officially announced its regional autonomy on 9 January 2014. Elections were held, popular assemblies established and the Constitution of Rojava was approved. Since then, residents organized local assemblies, reopened schools, established community centers, and helped push back the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) to gain control of almost all land in Syria east of the Euphrates river. They see their model of grassroots democracy as one that can be implemented throughout Syria in the future. Social revolution Asayish police force After declaring autonomy, grassroots organizers, politicians and other community members have radically changed the social and political make-up of the area. The extreme laws restricting independent political organizing, women's freedom, religious and cultural expression and the discriminatory policies carried out by the Assad government have been superseded. In their place, a Constitution of Rojava guaranteeing the cultural, religious and political freedom of all people has been established. The constitution also explicitly states the equal rights and freedom of women and also \\"mandates public institutions to work towards the elimination of gender discrimination\\". The political and social changes taking place in Rojava have in large part been inspired by the libertarian socialist politics of Kurdish leader Abdullah √ñcalan. =Cooperative economy= The Rojava economy is a blend of private companies, the autonomous administration and worker cooperatives. Since the revolution, efforts have been made to transition the economy to one of self-sufficiency based on worker and producer cooperatives. This transition faces the major obstacles of ongoing conflict and an embargo from all neighboring countries: Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and the various forces controlling nearby areas of Syria. This has forced people to rely almost exclusively on diesel-run generators for electricity. Additionally, strong emphasis is being placed on businesses that can bring about self-sufficiency to the region. There were at first no direct or indirect taxes on people or businesses in the region; Instead the administration funded itself mainly through the sale of oil and other natural resources and tariffs on border commerce (which is clandestine because of the embargo). However, in July 2017, it was reported that the administration in the Jazira Region had started to collect income tax to provide for public services in the region. There are partnerships that have been created between private companies and the administration. The administration also funds the school system and distributes bread to all citizens at a below-market rate. The Movement for a Democratic Society Economic Committee has been helping businesses move towards a \\"community economy\\" based on worker cooperatives and self-sufficiency. Syrians sewing garments in a worker cooperative Other cooperatives involve bottled mineral water, construction, factories, fuel stations, generators, livestock, oil, pistachio and roasted seeds, and public markets. Additionally there are several agricultural communes with families collectively working the land. =Direct democracy= The Rojava Cantons are governed through a combination of district and civil councils. District councils consist of 300 members as well as two elected co-presidents- one man and one woman. District councils decide and carry out administrative and economic duties such as garbage collection, land distribution and cooperative enterprises. Civil councils exist to promote social and political rights in the community. =Ethnic minority rights= Closely related to religious freedom and the protection of religious minorities is the protection of ethnic minorities. Kurds now have the right to study their language freely, as do Assyrians. For the first time, a Kurdish curriculum has been introduced to the public school system. Residents are also now free to express their culture freely. Culture and music centers have formed, hosting dance classes, music lessons and choir practice. In some areas, in addition to the gender quota for councils, there is also an ethnic minority quota. There has been, however, numerous instances of discrimination toward Assyrians, including policies of seizing the property of Assyrians who had to flee due to conflict, and numerous instances of attacks against the Assyrian minority. Kurdish authorities have also shut down privately run Assyrian schools ostensibly to protect students from \\"exorbitant tuition costs\\". =Restorative justice= The criminal justice system is undergoing significant reforms, moving away from a punitive approach under the Assad government to one based on the principles of restorative justice. Reconciliation Committees have replaced the Syrian government court system in several cities. Committees are representative of the ethnic diversity in their respective area. For example, the committee in Tal Abyad has Arabs, Kurds, Turkmen and Armenians. =Women's rights= Jineology and the Rojava revolution Girke Lege's women centre offers services to survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and other forms of harm. Feminism, specifically jineology (the science of women), is central to the social revolution taking place in Rojava. In the Social Contract of the Autonomous Regions of Kobane, Jazira and Afrin of 2014, it is stated that women and men have the same rights. Much of the focus of the revolution has been in addressing the extreme levels of violence which women in the area have endured as well as increasing women's leadership in all political institutions. All YPG and YPJ fighters and Asayish have the study of jineology as part of their training, and it is also taught in community centers. Women's houses In every town and village under YPG control, a women's house is established. These are community centers run by women, providing services to survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and other forms of harm. These services include counseling, family mediation, legal support, and coordinating safe houses for women and children. Classes on economic independence and social empowerment programs are also held at women's houses. Banning of child marriages and honor killings Efforts are being made to reduce cases of underage marriage, polygamy and honor killings, both socially as well as through legislation forbidding these practices. Women's leadership A 40% gender quota is required of all councils in order for a vote to take place. =Religious freedom= The right to religious expression is also safeguarded in the constitution. This, as well as the extreme hostility towards religious minorities in Islamist controlled areas, has led to a large migration of religious minorities to Rojava. Relations and conflicts Military situation in December 2015 There are four major forces involved in the Rojava revolution. The People's Protection Units are working with the PYD and other political parties to establish self-rule in Rojava. Syrian government forces still maintain rule in some areas of Rojava under the leadership of the Assad government. A collection of Sunni Islamist forces, the largest being the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), fought to rule the region by way of Islamic fundamentalism. Finally, there were several militias under the general banner of the Free Syrian Army whose intentions and alliances have differed and shifted over time. =Rojava-Syrian government relations and conflicts= While conflict between the YPG and the Syrian government has not been as active as fighting against Islamist forces, there have been several conflicts between the two forces. Territory once controlled by the Syrian government in both Qamishli and al-Hasakah has been taken over by YPG forces. At the end of April 2016, clashes erupted between government forces and YPG fighters for control of Qamishli. As of the beginning of August 2016, YPG fighters controlled two-thirds of the northeastern city of al-Hasakah, while pro-government militias controlled the remainder. On 17 August 2016, heavy clashes broke out between YPG fighters and the pro-government militias, resulting in the deaths of four civilians, four Kurdish fighters, and three government loyalists. On 18 August, Syrian government aircraft bombed YPG positions in Hasakah, including three YPG checkpoints and three YPG bases. Syrian Kurds had recently demanded that the pro-government National Defense Forces militia disband in al-Hasakah. A government source told the AFP that the air strikes were \\"a message to the Kurds that they should stop this sort of demand that constitutes an affront to national sovereignty\\". Another possible factor behind the fighting may have been the recent thaw in Turkish-Russian relations that began in July 2016; Russia, a key ally of the Syrian government, had previously been supporting Syrian Kurdish forces as a means to apply pressure to Turkey. After the recent territorial defeat of ISIL in Syria and Iraq and improvements in the Turkish- Russian relationship, it is possible that Russia and its allies began to view a strong YPG as increasingly less useful. In response to the attacks by the Syrian aircraft on Kurdish positions near al-Hasakah, the United States scrambled planes over the city in order to deter further attacks. By 22 August, Syrian government troops, Hezbollah fighters, and members of the Iranian paramilitary Basij militia had become involved in the fighting against Kurdish forces in al-Hasakah. =Internal relations and conflicts in Rojava= On 28 December 2012, Syrian government forces opened fire on pro-FSA demonstrators in al-Hasakah city, killing and wounding several individuals. Arab tribes in the area attacked YPG positions in the city in reprisal, stating the Kurdish fighters were collaborating with the government. Clashes broke out, and three Arabs were killed, though it was not clear whether they were killed by YPG forces or nearby government troops. Demonstrations were organised by various Kurdish groups throughout Western Kurdistan in late December as well. PYD supporters drove vehicles at low speeds through a KNC demonstration in Qamishli, raising tensions between the two groups. From 2 to 4 January, PYD-led demonstrators staged protests in the al-Antariyah neighbourhood of Qamishli, demanding \\"freedom and democracy\\" for both Kurds and Syrians. Many activists camped out on site. On 4 January, approximately 10,000 people were participating in the rallies, which also included smaller numbers of supporters of other Kurdish parties, such as the KNC, which staged a rally in the Munir Habib neighbourhood. PYD organisers had planned for 100,000 people to participate, but such support did not materialise. The demonstrations were concurrent with rallies conducted across the country by the Arab opposition, though Kurdish parties did not use the same slogans as the Arabs, and also did not the same slogans amongst their own parties. Kurds also demonstrated in several other towns, but not across the entire Kurdish region. Meanwhile, several armed incidents occurred between the dominant PYD- YPG and other Kurdish parties in the region, particularly the Kurdish Union (\\"Yek√Æt√Æ\\") Party, part of a Kurdish political coalition called the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union formed on 15 December 2012, which excludes the PYD. On 3 January, PYD gunmen staged a drive-by shooting on a Yek√Æt√Æ office in Qamishli. Armed Yek√Æt√Æ members returned fire, injuring one PYD member. The same day, armed clashes broke out between YPG fighters and members of the newly formed Jiwan Qatna Battalion of Yek√Æt√Æ in ad-Darbasiyah. Four Yek√Æt√Æ members were abducted by the YPG, who said they were affiliated with Islamist groups, though Yek√Æt√Æ activists stated that the PYD wanted to prevent other Kurdish groups from arming themselves. Following demonstrations in the town demanding their release and an intervention by the KNC, the four men were released by the end of the day. On 11 January, YPG forces raided an empty Yek√Æt√Æ training ground near Ali Faru which had been built in early January, tearing down both the Kurdish and FSA flags that had been flying at the base. Though PYD members defended the raid by saying that the flags could have attracted government airstrikes, Yek√Æt√Æ condemned the action. Military situation in August 2018 On 31 January, Kamal Mustafa Hanan, editor-in-chief of Newroz (a Kurdish-language journal) and a former Yek√Æt√Æ politician, was fatally shot in the Ashrafiyah district of Aleppo. It was not clear if he was the victim of a stray bullet or of a politically motivated assassination. Yek√Æt√Æ organised a funeral procession in the town of Afrin in the Kurdish-held northwest corner of Aleppo Province on 1 February, which members of both the PYD and KNC attended. Also on 1 February, Kurds staged demonstrations in several towns and villages across West Kurdistan concurrent with opposition demonstrations elsewhere in the country. The demonstrations were organised by various Kurdish groups, including the PYD and KNC. Demonstrators from the KNC demanded an end to fighting in Ras al-Ayn and the withdrawal of armed groups from the town, while PYD demonstrators stressed solidarity with their YPG units and the Kurdish Supreme Council. From 2 to 5 February, YPG forces blockaded the village of Kahf al-Assad (), inhabited by members of the Kurdish Kherikan tribe, after being fired upon by unknown gunmen in the village. YPG checkpoints were also established around other Kherikan villages. The Kherikan are traditionally supporters of the Massoud Barzani government of Iraqi Kurdistan, and as oppose the PYD. The blockade was the third time in two years that hostilities had broken out between the PYD/YPG and locals from Kahf al- Assad. On 7 February, YPG members kidnapped three members of the opposition Azad√Æ party in Ayn al-Arab. On 22 February, Osman Baydemir, mayor of the city of Diyarbakƒ±r in Turkey, announced the initiation of a one-month humanitarian aid programme in which his city‚Äîalong with the surrounding districts of Baƒülar, Yeni≈üehir, Kayapƒ±nar, and Sur‚Äîwould provide food assistance to Kurdish areas in Syria affected by the war, which had received little of the humanitarian aid that other regions of Syria had received. On 11 April 2016, PYD supporters attacked the offices of the Kurdish National Council and the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Syria in Derbessiye and Qamishli. The head of the Kurdish National Council told Turkey's TRT World channel the \\"PYD's oppressive attitude in Syria is forcing Kurds to leave the region\\". On 16 January 2017, more than 270 Syrian Kurdish activists signed an appeal calling for unity talks between the main Syrian Kurdish parties. In response, the Movement for a Democratic Society led by the PYD stated that they welcome unity and called on the Kurdish National Council to participate in federal project. The KNC led by the KDP-S, in response, demanded the release its political prisoners detained in Rojava. The KNC has rejected the federalism project launched by the Syrian Democratic Council and stated that it will participate in the peace talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, with Turkey and Russia. The Kurdish National Alliance in Syria, part of the SDC also welcomed the proposal of unity. On 3 February 2017, amidst clashes between the KDP-S- affiliated Peshmerga group and the Sinjar Resistance Units in Sinjar, a KNC office was burned in Qamishli and another attacked in Dirb√™siy√™. The KNC said the pro-PYD youth group the Ciwanen Soresger was perpetrating the attacks. However, the perpetrators were reportedly arrested by the Asayish. SDF- controlled territory (green) and Turkish-occupied territory (red) in October 2019 On 3 March 2017, the Rojava Asayish arrested more than 40 members of the KNC in Syria while the KDP Asayish arrested 23 opposition protesters in Iraqi Kurdistan. 17 of them were later released but 6 were still imprisoned. By 16 March, more than 13 KNC offices and an Assyrian Democratic Organization office in Rojava were shut down by Rojava Asayish forces, reportedly for failing to register with PYD authorities. In response, the Human Rights Watch called on both sides to \\"immediately\\" release all \\"arbitrarily held political detainees\\". The Mesopotamia National Council announced their support for TEV- DEM's requirement for parties to apply to licenses to operate in Rojava. However, the council also called for the self-management to give sufficient time for applications and denounced \\"random\\" closing of the parties' offices. On 3 April 2017, the Kurdish National Council called on the PYD to release 4 of its detainees: a Kurdish Future Movement in Syria member, a Kurdish Youth Movement member, and two KDP-S members. As of the same day, 6 detainees were still held by Iraqi Kurdish authorities. On 12 April 2017, an official in TEV- DEM met with Gabriel Moushe Gawrieh, head of the Assyrian Democratic Organization, and discussed the closure of the latter's offices since March. It was the first time TEV-DEM officials met with the ADO. =Syrian Kurdish‚ÄìIslamist conflict= Changes of territorial control in the YPG's June 2015 offensive 2016/17 Raqqa campaign Raqqa offensive against ISIL in February 2017 The Syrian Kurdish‚ÄìIslamist conflict is a major theater in the Syrian Civil War, starting in 2013 after fighting erupted between the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) and Islamist rebel factions in the city of Ras al-Ayn. Kurdish forces launched a campaign in an attempt to take control of the Islamist-controlled areas in the governorate of al-Hasakah and some parts of Raqqa and Aleppo governorates after al-Qaeda in Syria used those areas to attack the YPG. The Kurdish groups and their allies' goal was also to capture Kurdish areas from the Arab Islamist rebels and strengthen the autonomy of the region of Rojava. YPG forces as well as later the broader Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have clashed heavily with Islamist forces of all stripes in the following years, in particular with those representing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Including the Siege of Koban√Æ (2014), the Al- Hasakah offensive (February‚ÄìMarch 2015), the Al-Hasakah offensive (May 2015), the Tell Abyad offensive (May‚ÄìJuly 2015), the Battle of Sarrin (June‚ÄìJuly 2015), the Battle of Al-Hasakah (June‚ÄìAugust 2015), and the Raqqa campaign (2016‚Äìpresent) including the Battle of Tabqa (2017). =Rojava‚ÄìTurkey conflict= Turkey has long called the PYD as a Syrian extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), and has therefore taken a hardline stance against the group, the official talking point being that it would not allow a Kurdish state to form along their southern border with Syria. Turkey's policy towards Rojava is based on an economic blockade, persistent attempts of international isolation, opposition to the cooperation of the international Anti-ISIL-coalition with Rojava militias, and support of Islamist Syrian Civil War parties hostile towards Rojava, in past times even including ISIL. Turkey has on several occasions been militarily attacking Rojava territory and defence forces. The latter has resulted in some of the most clearcut instances of international solidarity with Rojava. Turkey received PYD co-chair Salih Muslim for talks in 2013 and in 2014, even entertaining the idea of opening a Rojava representation office in Ankara \\"if it's suitable with Ankara's policies\\". Turkey recognizes the PYD and the YPG militia as identical to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the European Union, the United States and others. However, the EU, the US, and others cooperate with the PYD and the YPG militia in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and do not designate either a terrorist organisation. About its loss in international standing, the consequence of domestic and foreign policies of Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, the Turkish government is contemptuous. The Turkish foreign minister called the PYD a \\"terrorist organisation\\" in his speech at the meeting of Council of Foreign Ministers of the 13th Islamic Summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on 12 April 2016 at Istanbul, Turkey. In November 2016 a state-run media organization of Turkey, Anadolu Agency, stated that the educational institutions of Rojava had \\"prejudice against Islam\\". U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said there were links between the PYD, the YPG, and the PKK. Secretary Carter replied, \\"Yes,\\" to a Senate panel when Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) asked whether he believed the Syrian Kurds are \\"aligned or at least have substantial ties to the PKK\\". Rojava and YPG leaders state that the PKK is a separate organization. YPG representatives have persistently reiterated that their militia has an all Syrian agenda and no agenda of hostility whatsoever towards Turkey. However, according to the Turkish Daily Sabah, at one occasion in January 2016 \\"a YouTube video has appeared of an English-speaking man, reported to be a fighter from the Democratic Union Party's (PYD) armed wing, the People's Protection Units (YPG) (...) making a call for Westerners to join the ranks of the armed group and conduct terrorist attacks against the Turkish state.\\" In the perception of much of the Turkish public, the Rojava federal project as well as U.S. support for the YPG against ISIL are elements of a wider conspiracy scheme by a \\"mastermind\\" with the aim to weaken or even dismember Turkey, in order to prevent its imminent rise as a global power. Women's Protection Units (YPJ) fighters in the Afrin Region during the Turkish invasion of Afrin in February 2018 Following YPG successes in 2015, including the capture of Tell Abyad, Turkey began targeting YPG forces in northern Syria. On 16 February 2016, Turkish forces began shelling Kurdish forces in the Afrin District after the SDF took initiative from an SAA offensive and captured rebel-held areas of the Azaz District, including Tell Rifaat and Menagh Airbase. Turkey vowed not to allow the SDF to capture the key border town of Azaz. As a result, 25 Kurdish militants were killed and 197 injured from Turkish artillery fire. In early 2016, following the capture of Tishrin Dam, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) were allowed to cross the Euphrates River, a proclaimed 'red line' by Turkey. Turkish forces bombed the Kurdish YPG headquarters in Tell Abyad, destroying three armoured vehicles and injuring two Kurdish fighters. The following day, 21 January 2016, Turkish troops crossed the border into Syria and entered the ISIL-controlled Syrian border town of Jarabulus which the YPG had been planning on capturing as part of an offensive to unite their areas of control into one continuous banner of territory. Kurdish-led forces in northern Syria said Turkish airstrikes hit their bases in Amarneh village near Jarablus on 27 August 2016, after Turkish artillery shelled the positions the day before. The Syrian Observatory reported on 27 August 2016, about exchange of gunfire between YPG and the Turkish forces in the countryside north of Hasakah. It is unclear if Turkish forces were on Syrian territory or had fired across the border. In March 2017, U.S. Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend said \\"I have seen absolutely zero evidence that they have been a threat to, or have supported any attacks on, Turkey from Northern Syria over the last two years.\\" The top U.S. commander in the campaign against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) stated that the Peoples‚Äô Protection Units (YPG), the military wing of the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), does not pose a threat to Turkey. \\"Of those YPG fighters, I‚Äôve talked to their leaders and we‚Äôve watched them operate and they continually reassure us that they have no desire to attack Turkey, that they are not a threat to Turkey, in fact that they desire to have a good working relationship with Turkey.\\" See also *Cities and towns during the Syrian Civil War *Democratic Confederalism *International Freedom Battalion *Syrian Democratic Forces *Syrian Kurdish‚ÄìIslamist conflict (2013‚Äìpresent) *Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict (2015‚Äìpresent) *Kurdish rebellion of 1983 References Category:21st-century revolutions Category:Conflicts in 2015 Category:Conflicts in 2016 Category:Kurdistan independence movement Category:Kurdish rebellions in Syria Category:Politics of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria Category:2012 in the Syrian Civil War Category:2013 in the Syrian Civil War Category:2014 in the Syrian Civil War Category:2015 in the Syrian Civil War Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Democratic Federation of Northern Syria Category:Direct democracy Category:Feminist movements and ideologies Category:Islam-related controversies Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War Category:Kurdish secession in Syria Category:Socialism in Syria Category:Socialist feminism Category:Al-Hasakah Governorate in the Syrian Civil War Category:Raqqa Governorate Category:Aleppo Governorate Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Syrian government Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Free Syrian Army Category:Major phases of Syrian Civil War ","title":"Rojava conflict"},{"id":"48303489","text":"Popt√∫n Airport is an airport serving the town of Popt√∫n in Guatemala.

Life Fletcher was born sometime in the mid 1770s in Southwell. His parents' names are not known, but a Byron letter of January 1809 noted his valet's father had died and left some property. A Southwell farmer called Richard Fletcher was buried on 14 January and might have been he. A William Fletcher, a ‚Äòservingman‚Äô, had married ‚Äòspinster‚Äô Sarah Bye ‚Äòboth of Southwell‚Äô on 23 July 1804 at Southwell Minster.Southwell Minster Parish records At Southwell, the Fletchers had a son, William, in March 1805, but he died as a baby the following July. A second son, George, was born in May 1806. Fletcher served the Byron family from about 1804, at first as a footman and groom. Around October 1806, Byron‚Äôs valet Frank Boyce was sacked and later tried and transported for theft. Fletcher became Byron's valet soon after that and remained so until the poet's death in 1824. A third child, William, later William Frederick, was born in late June 1809, just as Fletcher was about to travel to Europe and the East with Byron and John Cam Hobhouse. Byron eventually sent Fletcher home to England, after many tribulations, near the end of 1810. Widowed a few years later, Fletcher married Anne Rood, who was also Lady Byron's maid, in January 1816. Fletcher joined Byron in exile in Europe following the marriage scandal, leaving behind his newly wedded wife to cope with two motherless sons. He was at Byron's bedside constantly during the poet's last illness and accompanied the body to England. Byron almost certainly meant to leave his valet a generous annuity. As any will he had made abroad was not found, an earlier will was proved which left Fletcher no pension. Fletcher and Lega Zambelli, Byron's Italian secretary, tried to set up a macaroni manufacturing business in London, but it seems to have failed around the mid 1830s when the government lifted the duty on importing Italian spaghetti. Zambelli continued the business by importing Italian comestibles and the enterprise eventually passed to Fletcher's son who married Zambelli's daughter. Fletcher had to rely on the impecunious Augusta Leigh for funds but she was forced to stop his allowance in 1838 and his decline and death seem to have followed rapidly. Byron biographer Doris Langley-Moore claimed that Fletcher lived into his 80s, but Byron scholar Ralph Lloyd-Jones has discovered a newspaper report that Fletcher died in 1839.Morning Chronicle, 3 December 1839 References Category:19th-century English people Category:British servants Category:Lord Byron Category:1770s births Category:1839 deaths ","title":"William Fletcher (valet)"},{"id":"48303578","text":"Mokhtar Yahyaoui () was a human rights activist and a Tunisian judge.

He was a deputy and then a senator before and during World War II (1939‚Äì45). He was Minister of Public Works in 1929‚Äì30, Minister of Justice in 1934‚Äì35, Minister of Blockade in 1939‚Äì40 and briefly Minister of the French Family and Public Health in June 1940. After World War II (1939‚Äì45) he was again a senator from 1946 to 1959. Throughout his career Pernot was a vocal pronatalist, pushing for government policies that would support the family and encourage higher birth rates to counter the demographic crisis in France. He believed that women should be encouraged to remain at home to raise children. Early years Auguste Alain Georges Pernot was born on 6 November 1879 in Besan√ßon, Doubs. His father was a barrister at the court of Besan√ßon. He was one of eight children, and would himself have seven children. He inherited conservative Catholic views, but was loyal to the Republic. His early education was at the Fr√®res de Marie in Besan√ßon. In 1904 he submitted a legal thesis on the rights to the salary of the married woman. Georges Pernot became an advocate at the Besan√ßon court of appeal. In 1905, the year in which the separation of the church and state came into force, he fought for the clerical cause. He enlisted in the territorial army in 1914 at the start of World War I (1914‚Äì18). He volunteered for the front, was wounded, received three citations, rose to the rank of captain and was decorated with the Legion of Honor. Pernot was elected a municipal councilor in Besan√ßon in 1919. Throughout his political career Pernot was interested in family rights. In 1921 he founded the Union of Large Families of Doubs, one of the first branches of the Federation of Associations of Large Families (F√©d√©ration des Associations des Familles Nombreuses), created in September 1921. Deputy Pernot was elected deputy for Doubs in 1924. He led the left wing of the National Catholic Federation (F√©d√©ration nationale catholique, FNC). As a Social Catholic he pushed for social reforms. By 1926 there was support for pacification, in which the Catholics would stop trying to capture the state and in exchange would be allowed to teach. In 1927 he criticized the right wing members of the FNC \\"whose intransigence had harmed them in the past, and who were depriving themselves once again of the influence that they ought to have on the destiny of the country. Pernot was elected deputy for Pontarlier in 1928. He was also general councilor for Doubs from 1928 for the canton of Morteau. He was vice-president of the chamber of deputies from 1928. He specialized in legal and family issues. In 1930 Pernot became president of the Federation of Large Families. He was Minister of Public Works from 3 November 1929 to 13 December 1930 in the cabinet of Andr√© Tardieu. During his term of office the parliament voted to double the national road network to . Pernot was reelected deputy for Pontarlier in 1932. After the 1932 election Pernot and left the National Catholic Federation since he was unwilling to join the same parliamentary group as its right-wing members. In 1932 Pernot was the moving force behind the family allocation bill, which forced all employers to provide family benefits. He represented France twice in the League of Nations. He led the negotiations between France and Germany over the status of the Saar. Pernot was Minister of Justice from 8 November 1934 to 7 June 1935 in the cabinet of Pierre-√âtienne Flandin. On 22 February 1935 Henry Dorg√®res, a Fascist sympathizer and leader of the \\"Green Shirt\\" movement, made an inflammatory speech in Rouen. Pernot, who was already concerned about the movement, made sure that Dorg√®res was prosecuted for the speech with no delay. In the end, Dorg√®res was given a suspended sentence of six months in prison on 29 August 1935. Senator Pernot was elected senator for Doubs in November 1935 on the first ballot. He criticized the Matignon accord of June 1936, which settled union grievances after the recent general strike, saying it was \\"an accord between workers and employers reached under government supervision that dealt with everything except family allowances; they thought of everything except the most important!\\". On 8 January 1938 Pernot gave a speech in the Senate on the demographic crisis. He rejected defeatism and stop-gap responses. He called for the family vote, tax code reform, better housing, priority for members of large families in employment in the public service and creation of an appropriate moral climate. He wanted to stop the movement of people to the cities and encourage women to return to the home. He noted that eight million women held jobs, and argued that if women were paid to stay at home the family would benefit while unemployment would be reduced. He said, \\"if the government wishes to undertake this policy with courage, it will have behind it the unanimity of Parliament and the unanimity of the country, for all of us share the deep conviction that we will not achieve the health of the nation except by a return to the old virtues of the family.\\" In February 1938 Pernot talked of the \\"moral sickness\\" of France in a speech in which he cited statistics that showed that France's population was falling behind Italy and Germany. He called for a legal document to organize and strengthen the existing laws and regulations, and an official organization to develop and promote these laws. He said, \\"We must create a policy that will restore this country's faith, soul, ideal, as well as its trust and confidence in the future.\\" The government of √âdouard Daladier established the High Committee on the Population (Haut Comit√© de la Population, HCP) in February 1939. It included Pernot and the pronatalists Fernand Boverat and Adolphe Landry. Its mandate was to prepare reforms to encourage the growth of the population, particularly in rural areas. This led to the Family Code (Code de la Famille), enacted in July 1939, which introduced family allowances in agriculture and reformed family allowances in commerce and industry. It redistributed benefits from small families to larger ones, and gave birth bonuses for children born in the first two years of marriage. After the outbreak of World War II (1939‚Äì45) Pernot was made Minister of Blockade in the war cabinet of √âdouard Daladier from 13 September 1939 to 21 March 1940. The ministry was not staffed until October 1939, and the inter-ministerial Blockade Committee was only formed at the end of October. Pernod chaired the committee, which coordinated preventative purchasing efforts abroad. However, he was handicapped by lack of authority over the departments represented on the committee. The blockade was ineffective. In December 1939 Pernot's optimistic forecasts were rejected by the conservative Paul Bastid. Pernod reported in March 1940 that Germany's shipments from overseas had dropped but imports by land had increased, notably from the Soviet Union, the Balkans and Italy. After being replaced as Blockade Minister, in April 1940 Pernot criticized the failure to stimulate the wartime economy, saying \\"Reports on top of reports, all stuffed with figures, many of which unfortunately provide little comfort. What an effort remains to increase our number of aircraft, to accelerate the production of munitions.\\" On 5 June 1940 the second cabinet of Paul Reynaud created the Ministry of the Family, with Pernot as minister. He was also Minister of Health. The new Family Ministry was to help families that had been displaced by the war. Pernot held office only until 16 June 1940. On 10 July 1940 he voted for the constitutional law that established the Vichy regime. In 1941 Pernot was named a member of the National Council. In June 1941 the High Committee on the Population (HCP) was dissolved and the Consultative Committee on the Family (Comit√© consultatif de la Famille) was created in its place. Pernot, Alfred Sauvy and Jacques Doublet all continued from the HCP to the new committee. The committee established teams to investigate family-related legislation, housing, food rationing, financial assistance, childhood and moral protection. From 1943 to 1945 Pernot was a member of the departmental council of Doubs. He was dismissed from the Senate in 1945. Post-war career As soon as France was liberated Pernot began a propaganda drive to address the demographic crisis in France through stronger policies to encourage families. In July 1945 he launched the pronatalist journal Pour la vie (For Life). The first issues of Pour la vie tried to show that pronatalism had arisen in the pre-war period, and that it should be recognized for the Code de la Famille rather than for its collaboration with the Vichy Regime. Pernot was elected to the Council of the Republic in 1946. At first he was president of the Republican Party of Liberty (Parti r√©publicain de la libert√©, PRL). He then joined the Independent Republicans (R√©publicains ind√©pendants). He remained most active in issues concerning the family and children. He was designated French representative to the committee on social issues of the United Nations Economic Council. He was a member of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe, and chaired the Committee on Population and Refugees of the Council of Europe. Pernot voted for the draft law on constitutional reform on 2‚Äì3 June 1958 that led to the French Fifth Republic. He did not seek reelection in 1959. In July 1959 he was made a commander of the Legion of Honor. He died on 15 September 1962 in Besan√ßon, Doubs, aged 82.

Early and personal life Morneau's parents are William Francis \\"Frank\\" Morneau Sr. who came from Walkerville, Windsor, Ontario, and Helen (Lynch) Morneau, who came from Adjala Township, Alliston, Ontario. Their families had deep roots in both areas. Bill Morneau's father, Frank Morneau, founded the actuarial and benefit consulting firm W.F. Morneau & Associates in 1966. Morneau was born in Toronto at St. Joseph's Health Centre and attended Senator O'Connor College School. From 1981 to 1986, Morneau attended the University of Western Ontario and completed an Honours BA as an undergraduate, he spent one year at the University of Grenoble in France. He then earned an MBA from INSEAD. Morneau eventually went on to earn an master of science (MSc) in economics from the London School of Economics.

According to the office of the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner public registry, Morneau's assets are currently held in a blind trust and his wife, Nancy McCain, is the beneficiary and owner of various holding companies. Business career Bill Morneau had demonstrated an interest in business and entrepreneurship from a young age. At 17, Morneau and a friend started a business servicing swimming pools for homeowners, mostly in the Toronto neighbourhood of Don Mills. Morneau ran the business for four years, helping him pay a good part of his university tuition. W.F. Morneau & Associates was an actuarial and benefits consulting firm; Morneau's father, Frank, founded the company and was the CEO. Morneau joined the company in 1990, and two years later was given the role of president. In 1997, Morneau replaced his father as CEO. In the years when Morneau ran the firm, the company absorbed competitors across Canada as it grew to become the nation's biggest player in the sector. In 1992, the firm bought the Canadian actuarial consulting businesses of Coopers & Lybrand, followed by the 1997 acquisition of Sobeco, a large Quebec-based pension and benefit businesses, from Ernst & Young. In 1998, Morneau also acquired the Canadian pension consulting practice of Deloitte & Touche. In 2008, Morneau's firm also bought Shepell FGI‚Äîa group that helped companies provide mental health and emotional counselling to employees‚Äîand changed its name to Morneau Shepell. As executive chair of Morneau Shepell, Morneau led the firm through a period of growth from a few hundred people in 1992 to almost 4000 employees in 2015 - becoming the largest Canadian human resources services organization, with offices across North America.

The day-to-day operation of the school rests with the Windle Trust and its team of 18 teachers, including eight women, and a staff of 20. Morneau was appointed as pension investment advisor to the Ontario minister of finance, Dwight Duncan in 2012, providing counsel aimed at facilitating the pooling of public-sector pension fund assets. His report led to the eventual establishment of Investment Management Corporation of Ontario, which now pools funds and offers public-sector pension plans lower costs with economies of scale. In 2014, he was appointed by the premier of Ontario, Kathleen Wynne to an expert panel to advise on how to support the 3.5 million workers in Ontario who would not receive a comparable workplace pension after their retirement. This led to the creation of the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan, which was later withdrawn when Morneau became the federal minister of finance and the Canada Pension Plan was expanded.Office of the Premier (Jan 28 2014) Premier Announces Technical Advisory Group Ontario GovernmentMorrow, Adrian (December 18, 2013).

Political career =Seeking election= Morneau has stated his motivation to run for public office stemmed from seeing important changes going on in the lives of Canadians through his exposure running the largest human resources firm in Canada, Morneau Shepell. On the pensions side of his businesses, he saw changes in employee plans, with the burden for saving shifting from corporations to individuals, leaving employees much more vulnerable in retirement. Employee benefit plans were also getting costlier‚Äîmaking hospitalizations, prescription meds, and dental and eye care harder to afford. In the employee assistance part of his business, he saw a rising anxiety among Canadians, and a matched increase in mental health challenges. Through these experiences, Morneau said he began thinking seriously about helping people on a broader scale and that led him to eventually run for the Liberal Party nomination in the downtown riding of Toronto Centre. On October 19, 2015, Morneau was elected as the member of Parliament for Toronto Centre with 57.9% of the vote. He was then named by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as minister of finance for Canada on November 4, 2015, becoming the first rookie MP to hold the position.CBC News (November 4, 2015). Full list of Justin Trudeau's cabinet =Responsibilities= As minister of finance, Morneau was responsible for directing more than $300 billion in revenues via the federal budget each year. Administering tariffs and financial regulations were also part of his portfolio. Additional responsibilities included overseeing the Bank of Canada, the Royal Canadian Mint, and the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Investment Board, among others. Morneau represented Canada at international gatherings, including the G7 and G20 Summits, in addition to serving as governor of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. =Gender equality= Morneau tabled Canada's first gender-based budget and introduced a banknote featuring civil-rights activist Viola Desmond, making it Canada's first circulation banknote to feature a Canadian woman, and the first to feature a Black woman. =Policies= Morneau with Steven Mnuchin in June 2017 Morneau played a key role in implementing a number of signature Liberal government initiatives, including new benefits for parents, low-income workers and seniors, as well as expanding the Canada Pension Plan. Morneau also moved forward with the Liberal's commitment to lower income taxes on the middle class by raising taxes on the wealthiest Canadians. Morneau established the Advisory Council on Economic Growth, which called for a gradual increase in permanent immigration to Canada to 450,000 people a year. Morneau reached an agreement in 2016 with provincial and territorial governments to expand the Canada Pension Plan. The expanded CPP was designed to address the shortfall in middle-income retirement planning that is opening up as a result of disappearing corporate pensions. In 2017, Morneau also led negotiations on new health care funding agreements with the provinces and territories. In August 2017, all provinces and territories agreed to a Common Statement of Principles on Shared Health Priorities, which outlines common priorities for action in home and community care, and in mental health and addiction services. Morneau was responsible for the federal government's economic response plan to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada including the implementation of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, Canada Emergency Business Account and Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. =Canadian economy= During his government's first mandate, the Canadian economy saw a period of high growth and historically low unemployment and fewer Canadians living in poverty. Statistics Canada reported that fewer Canadians are living under the official poverty line than at any time in the last decade, including 278,000 fewer children. =Small business tax changes= The Liberal government changes to small business taxation, proposed in 2017, were a controversial issue during Morneau's tenure as finance minister. The changes involve restricting several tax planning strategies, including passive investment income and income-sprinkling for private corporations, that are often used by small businesses. In response to the criticism, Morneau made several changes, including reducing the overall small business tax rate from 11% to 9%. Morneau with Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump in June 2019 =Intergovernmental affairs and internal trade= Between April and November 2019, Morneau was asked to take on the additional portfolio of intergovernmental affairs and internal trade in addition to the finance portfolio, filling in for Dominic LeBlanc who stepped down for health reasons. In the role, Morneau acted as the federal liaison to the provincial and territorial governments to encourage collaboration and trade.\\"intergovernmental affairs minister Dominic Leblanc on leave after second cancer diagnosis\\" . Toronto Star, April 26, 2019. =Resignation= On August 17, 2020, following a meeting with the Prime Minister earlier in the day, Morneau held a press conference announcing he would step down as Minister of Finance and as the Member of Parliament for Toronto Centre, and that he would seek to become secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Morneau had been under pressure to resign due to his involvement in the WE Charity controversy, where he had failed to recuse himself from Cabinet discussions involving the charity after accepting, then repaying $41,000 in expenses covered by the charity, as well as the fact that two of his daughters worked or volunteered for the charity.. Ethics scrutiny In September 2017, Morneau was fined for failing to disclose a private non-commercial real estate holding company in Avignon, France owned by him and his wife, which owns a family villa in Provence, France, to the ethics commissioner. Morneau said that this was a result of early administrative confusion which led to only the property, and not the legal structure, being disclosed. Prior to his election, Morneau held over 2 million shares of Morneau Shepell through an Alberta numbered company, 1193536 Alberta Ltd, paying Morneau dividends of $135,000 per month. In the Fall of 2017, it was revealed that based on the advise of the ethics commissioner, Morneau did not place his assets in a blind trust upon being appointed finance minister, something he was incorrectly reported to have done. Responding to criticism, Morneau sold the remainder of his shares in his former company, donated a portion of the profits to charity, and placed the remainder of his assets in a blind trust.https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bill-morneau-says-he-doesn-t- report-to-journalists-bristles-at-questions-about-personal-finances-1.4364241 title=Bill Morneau says he doesn't report to journalists bristles at questions about personal finances In 2018, the ethics commissioner cleared Morneau accusations that he had benefited from insider trading. Morneau and his office were also cited in the ethics commissioner's investigation into the SNC-Lavalin affair, which found that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had improperly pressured the minister of justice and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in an ongoing criminal case against Quebec-based construction giant SNC-Lavalin. In July 2020, ethics commissioner Mario Dion confirmed he would be investigating whether Morneau breached the Conflict of Interest Act over his involvement in the WE Charity scandal. Dion further expanded this investigation after Morneau admitted to a parliamentary committee that he accepted more than $40,000 in luxury hospitality from the WE organization in 2017. On July 22, 2020, hours before he was to testify before MPs, Morneau paid the amount back. Federal budgets In 2016, Morneau released his first budget as minister of finance. Items of note in the budget included $120 billion over 10 years for public infrastructure‚Äîfocusing on transit, water, waste management and housing‚Äîas well as the introduction of the Canada Child Benefit. The budget also included money for First Nations communities, as well as larger seniors and employment insurance benefits. In 2017, Morneau released his second budget and Canada's first gender-based federal budget. The budget included new federal investments in early learning and child care, more flexible benefits for family caregivers, more support for Indigenous women, and a national strategy to address gender-based violence. Additionally, Budget 2017 included $11.2-billion for an 11-year national housing strategy. 2018's budget continued the theme of greater equality for women in Canada, with money targeting new parental supports, gender equality and anti-harassment initiatives, as well as measures to promote pay equity. The budget also included new investments to tackle the opioid crisis, cope with a surge in asylum seekers crossing the border from the United States and improve living conditions for Indigenous people. In 2019, Morneau tabled his fourth budget, and final one before the 2019 Canadian federal election. The stated goals of the budget were to help Canadians feel a greater sense of financial security, gain new career skills, and be able to afford a first home. This budget also took \\"initial steps\\" toward a national pharmacare program by creating a national drug agency with the aim of bulk-buying drugs to lower costs. =Stance on budget deficits= Morneau has received criticism for abandoning the Liberal's platform commitment to run annual deficits of less than $10 billion during the first couple years of their mandate, and return to balance by 2019‚Äì20. A few months after taking office, he abandoned those vows, citing a weaker-than-expected economy. He then committed to continuing to reduce the government net debt-to-GDP ratio, arguing it's a better measure of government fiscal health.

It is located beside the city's Gravensteen Castle, crossing a branch of the Leie (river) which here forms a moat for the castle. The bridge is a well loved tourist destination. History Since 1371 or earlier murderers and rapists have been executed by decapitation on the medieval stone bridge. The most recent recorded execution took place in 1585. Till 1799 the bridge was decorated with the statues of two figures, recalling an oft-repeated legend. :In 1371 a father and son were scheduled for execution at the bridge after rebelling against the Count of Flanders. The count decided to conduct a gruesome experiment, from which he intended to find out whether the love of parents for their children is greater or lesser than the love of children for their parents. The father and son were informed that whichever of them would cut the head of the other should have his own life spared. The father explained to the son that under the circumstances the son should execute his father, because he was younger and should expect to live for longer. The son stood on the bridge and had reached the point of touching the father with his sword when the sword shattered. The duke reacted by pardoning both of them. A contemporary engraving shows how the two statues were positioned on the side of the bridge at the moment when the son, standing behind the kneeling father who has evidently had his hands bound, raises the sword. The statues were accompanied by an inscription: \\"Ae Gandte le en Fant fraepe sae pere se Tacte desuu / Maies se Heppe rompe, si Grace de Dieu. MCCCLXXI\\".Quoted from Friedrich Leitschuh (Hg.), Albrecht D√ºrer's Diary of his travels in the Netherlands. First complete edition from the manuscript of Johann Hauer, Leipzig 1884, p. 178. However, the statues were removed at the end of the eighteenth century and appear not to have survived. Albrecht D√ºrer indeed visited Ghent in 1521 and saw the two statues. He recorded the legend in his travel diary, but according to other sources missed the point: \\"I also saw on the bridge the place where people's heads are cut off, where two statues have been erected to commemorate a son cutting off his father's head\\".\\"Auch sah ich auf der Br√ºcke, wo man die Leute k√∂pft, die zwei Ehrenbilder, die errichtet sind als ein Denkzeichen daran, dass ein Sohn seinen Vater gek√∂pft hat.\\"zitiert nach Gerd Unverfehrt, Da sah ich viel k√∂stliche Dinge.

A member of the Liberal Party of Canada, he sat as the Member of Parliament for the riding of Saint-L√©onard‚ÄîSaint-Michel from his victory in the 2015 federal election until his resignation in January 2019.

He worked for now defunct law firm Heenan Blaikie. In 2010, his daughter was involved in an accident when a car she was in, which was driven by a drunk driver, hit a tree in his hometown of Mount Royal. She was rendered comatose for a month. As a result of this, Di Iorio became involved in a program to develop \\"Cool Taxi\\" coupons to assist people in getting a safe ride home. His involvement in the campaign brought him attention in the Quebec media, and led to his being nominated for Person of the Year by the local chamber of commerce. Federal politics In 2015, Di Iorio announced his candidacy for the Liberal Party of Canada's nomination for the 2015 federal election in the riding of Saint-L√©onard‚ÄîSaint-Michel. The previous incumbent, Massimo Pacetti, had been kicked out of the party as a result of a sexual harassment allegation, and Di Iorio earned the strong backing of the riding's Italian community. There was some controversy surrounding the nomination battle, as one of his opponents, Domenic Cusmano, alleged that Di Iorio was distributing memberships in contravention of the rules. Di Iorio nevertheless secured the nomination and won the subsequent general election. =Inappropriate comments= During an in camera session of the Public Safety Committee meeting on March 8, 2017, Dianne Watts received a call on her cellphone, which emitted a \\"jaunty\\" ringtone. In response, Di Iorio remarked \\"Where's your pole to slide down on?\\" According to Watts, after the meeting, Di Iorio personally apologized to her about his comments, saying that he saw what he had meant as a joke had made her uncomfortable. Watts then dropped the matter, but Liberal MP Rob Oliphant, the chair of the committee, confirmed that information about the event had been passed on to Liberal whip Pablo Rodr√≠guez. When this incident was reported on by the National Post on March 23, 2017, opposition MPs called for Di Iorio to be disciplined for his comment. He subsequently apologized to the House of Commons for his comments. =Resignation= Di Iorio announced on April 25, 2018, that he intended to resign his seat by summer for family reasons. He claimed that he had accomplished the goals he had set out for himself when he entered politics in 2015 such as securing funding to extend Montreal's Blue rapid transit line. However, according to CBC News, Di Iorio had expected to handpick the Liberal candidate who would run in the riding for the 2019 Canadian federal election and leave his office by summer 2018. Once the party insisted that an open nomination would be held, he allegedly changed his mind about his resignation. He gave an interview to a weekly newspaper saying that he would stay on for the rest of his mandate. However, in late September, Di Iorio made a Facebook post saying that he was committed to his community and would take a month of reflection to decide on his future. In late October, shortly after the Cannabis Act came into effect, he presented at a Montreal cannabis trade show, but solely as part of his second job as a labour and employment lawyer. Following criticism for his absence from parliament, he announced in November that he would be resigning from parliament, effective January 22, 2019. Di Iorio announced he would give back his salary received as an MP from September 22, 2018 to January 22, 2019. On January 22, 2019, Di Iorio donated $100,000 to support anti-drunk driving efforts, fulfilling an earlier promise to donate his salary since the start of his final parliamentary term. He missed his self-imposed resignation deadline, but submitted his official resignation on January 29 to the Speaker of the House of Commons.

The site is situated one mile southwest from Globe, Arizona and surrounded by a small city park and adjacent museum with excavated items including prehistoric pottery, stone and woven artifacts. The site is operated by the city as Besh Ba Gowah Archaeological Park and Museum. Besh-Ba-Gowah was occupied by Salado populations between AD 1225 and AD 1400. \\"Salado\\" is the term applied to the complex of cultural attributes of the prehistoric peoples who inhabited the Globe/Miami and Tonto Basin regions between AD 1150 and AD 1450. Besh-Ba-Gowah architecture consists of multi- storied, masonry room block clusters connected by long, narrow corridors or elongated plazas. These room blocks and corridors are situated around a large communal plaza area measuring 12 meters north‚Äìsouth by 27 meters east/west. Material recovered from Besh-Ba-Gowah has formed the foundation for the profession's current understanding and definition of the Salado culture concept. Thus, Besh-Ba-Gowah is considered one of the Salado culture \\"type sites\\". Besh-Ba-Gowah, showing vertical stones at base of wall, Globe, AZ All walled architecture at Besh-Ba-Gowah consists of unshaped, large to moderate- sized, granite cobble masonry laid with a clay mortar. Evidence suggests interior room walls were commonly plastered with this mortar or a more calcareous mixture resulting in white-colored finished walls.

The project was announced in 2016 by real estate developer Tishman Speyer as a 1,041 foot skyscraper with 2.85 million square feet and 66 floors. The tower is being designed by Danish architectural firm Bjarke Ingels Group, which also designed the nearby West 57. The Spiral will be located on 34th Street between Hudson Boulevard and Tenth Avenue. When completed, The Spiral will join other developments made possible by rezoning, including Hudson Yards, 3 Hudson Boulevard and Manhattan West.

History  The tower was initially conceptualized in 2014 as the Hudson Spire, with a roof height a architectural height. It was marketed as the tallest building in the United States and the Western Hemisphere. In late 2015, Tishman Speyer paid $25 million to two men who refused to move from their apartment at 10th Avenue and West 34th Street, the future site of the Spiral. In exchange, the men agreed to leave the premises and moved to another building. The developer had spent $438 million on the property and its surrounding area, but despite a court order in Tishman Speyer's favor, the pair had remained until the payout was awarded.

He has published eight coffee table books of his photography, Masculinity (2012), Bare Strength (2014), Always Loyal (2015), Exhibition (2015), Adonis Blue (2016), Invictus (2016), Masculinity (second edition, 2018), Deconstructed (2019), and Divine Eros (2019). Early life Stokes grew up in Berkeley, California. He wrote and directed the short film, Alien (1992),. Published works In 2012, Stokes published his first hardcover male figure study book, Masculinity, which included photographs of the late French singer, actor, and model Quentin Elias. Stokes told The Huffington Post that his interest in war veterans came about after meeting U.S. Marine Corps vet and amputee-turned fitness model Alex Minsky. \\"I had already studied as many amputee photos that I could find. I noticed that most of them emphasized the lost limb, and that the mood was often sorrowful. That was not the vibe I was getting from him, so I decided to simply photograph him as if he were not an amputee, photograph him exactly the same way I would any of my fitness models.\\" Facebook controversy Stokes challenged Facebook's moderation policy after a photo was removed from his public page. The photo in question, of Minsky nude but covering his penis with an athletic cup, was deleted in February 2013 by the social network, who claimed it violated their ban on nudity. In protest, more than 4,000 of Stokes' followers shared the photograph and made it their profile picture. After Stokes questioned the photo's removal in various media outlets, the photo was reinstated and Stokes received an apology stating that the removal was an error. In December 2013, Facebook again removed the same photo of Minsky from Stokes' page, saying it violated their Community Standards, and banned the photographer's page for 30 days. In January 2015, Stokes was locked out of his Facebook account and told that his personal page and his professional one were to be merged for violating the network's policy of discussing work on his personal page, a claim Stokes adamantly denied. After an appeal, Stokes' two pages were not merged and he was once again granted access to both. After still more photos were removed, Stokes questioned why Facebook permitted ESPN to post nude athletes with full buttocks showing while he couldn't show a nude man shot from the side with nothing revealed. In protest, fans of Stokes began reporting the more revealing photos on ESPN's page, but Facebook declined to remove them or ban the sports network. At this point, Stokes told The Advocate, \\"we concluded that one way you can post male nudes on Facebook is if you are a big brand or if you advertise on Facebook.\\" In July 2015, Facebook issued Stokes a warning after he posted a photo called ‚ÄúMary, The Venus,‚Äù which depicts topless female Army veteran and amputee Mary Dague. In an interview with The Independent UK, Stokes said he believed the photo would be acceptable because it shows breast scarring, which Facebook does not prohibit. Two months later, Stokes was banned from the site for 30 days after posting a photo from his book Masculinity that showed a man nude from the side, lighting a cigarette. The photo was later reinstated and Stokes received an apology but not an explanation. Stokes believed the sudden reversal was prompted by a media request from The Independent UK, who had asked Facebook to publicly comment on the removal. When the photo was removed a second time shortly after its reinstatement, Stokes tried to contact Facebook's PR department but received no response. Stokes criticized Facebook's moderation by saying \\"We‚Äôre allowed to see Angora rabbits stripped of their fur live, but we can‚Äôt see a man nude from the side.\\" References External links *Michael Stokes Category:1963 births Category:People from Berkeley, California Category:Photographers from California Category:War photographers Category:Living people ","title":"Michael Stokes (photographer)"},{"id":"48303984","text":"Frank Baylis (born November 15, 1962) is a Canadian politician, who was elected to represent the riding of Pierrefonds‚ÄîDollard in the House of Commons of Canada in the 2015 federal election.

The following day, the UVF launched two retaliatory attacks. In the first, UVF members shot dead a Catholic civilian taxi driver in Carrickfergus. In the second, they shot dead two Protestant civilians in Newtownabbey, whom they believed were Catholics. The Loughinisland massacre, two days later, is believed to have been a further retaliation.  Background  The UVF had been considering calling a ceasefire soon, which they believed would be from a position of strength. The Irish National Liberation Army had been in decline since the late 1980s after the feud with Irish People's Liberation Organization in which the loss of their best operators in Belfast 1987 had left them weak and largely inactive. But in 1992 the INLA had somewhat of a resurgence in its campaign. On 14 April 1992, a British Army (BA) recruiting sergeant Michael Newman (33) was shot dead by two INLA volunteers outside an army recruiting office in Derby.https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-10723635 It was a significant incident as Newman was the first serving member of British Armed Forces to be killed by the INLA since 1984 when they shot dead UDR soldier Colin Houston.Jack Holland & Henry McDonald - INLA: Deadly Divisions p.363 It was also significant in that this was the first person the INLA had killed in England since the Airey Neave killing.Jack Holland & Henry McDonald - INLA: Deadly Divisions p.360 - 366 Two months later they struck in England again with two firebombs in stores in Leeds causing ¬£50,000 worth of damage. On the 14 January 1993 an INLA hit team drove around the Shankill road and the team fired rifle shots through the window of the home of UVF leader John \\"Bunter\\" Graham and seriously injured him. It was a prelude to the 1994 June killings and the INLA was a force to be feared again. In June 1993 they killed retired RUC officer, John Patrick Murphy.Jack Holland & Henry McDonald - INLA: Deadly Divisions p.366  Shootings  Trevor King mural, Disraeli Street, May 2012 On 16 June 1994, high-ranking UVF Commander volunteer Trevor King was standing on the Shankill Road not far from \\"The Eagle\\" (\\"The Eagle\\" was the UVF's Belfast GHQ) and he was talking to fellow UVF members, David Hamilton (43) and Colin Craig (31). They were about one hundred yards away from the UVF headquarters, which was located in rooms above a shop known as \\"The Eagle\\". A car drove past them and as it did so, Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) gunmen inside the vehicle opened fire on the three men. The car was later found burning close to Divis tower. David Lister and Hugh Jordan claimed that Gino Gallagher, who was himself shot dead in 1996 during an internal dispute, was the main gunman in the attack. However, Jack Holland and Henry McDonald said that Gallagher was inside the car which was scouting the area for UVF members, and not one of the gunmen. Colin Craig was killed on the spot. King and David Hamilton lay in the street, seriously wounded as panic and chaos erupted on the Shankill in the wake of the shooting. Presbyterian minister, the Reverend Roy Magee was in \\"The Eagle\\" discussing an upcoming Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC) meeting and the possibility of a loyalist ceasefire with the UVF Brigade Staff when the attack took place. He and the others raced out of the building after hearing the gunfire. He later described the scene he came upon outside. > \\"With some others, I ran down to where the men were. One was already dead > and the others were in a very, very bad physical state. The road was in > pandemonium at that stage. You could see that the leadership of the UVF was > quite naturally very, very broken and disturbed about the shooting of their > colleague. He [Trevor King] was a senior commander\\". King was rushed to hospital where he was put on a life-support machine. The shooting had left him paralysed from the neck down. He died on 9 July with Reverend Magee at his bedside. According to Magee, King himself made the decision to turn off the machine. The killings were a blow for the Northern Ireland peace process and a morale boost for the INLA. The attack was the INLA's most notorious since the Droppin Well bombing in 1982 which killed seventeen people, 11 British soldiers and 6 civilians.  Aftermath  The following day, the UVF launched two 'retaliatory' attacks. In the first, UVF members shot dead a Catholic civilian taxi driver in Carrickfergus. In the second, they shot dead two Protestant civilians in Newtownabbey, whom they believed were Catholics. Two days after the killings the Ulster Volunteer Force decided to launch another revenge attack when they killed six Catholic civilians in a bar while they were watching the Ireland vs Italy 1994 World Cup game opener in what became known as Loughinisland massacre. The tit-for- tat attacks continued on and off for the spring and summer of 1994 until the Provisional IRA ceasefire of 31 August 1994 and the Combined Loyalist Military Command ceasefire in October. The attacks on the Shankill were the INLA's deadliest attack of the 1990s. When interviewed for Boston College for research on the conflict, Progressive Unionist Party leader David Ervine suggested the INLA might have been working in cahoots with the Provisional IRA in targeting prominent Loyalists, as the month after in July the Provisional IRA killed three leading UDA men.

Historically, although homosexuality has not enjoyed a public platform, participation in pride marches, and public acceptance and visibility have risen slowly over the past few years. In spring 2010 Turkey‚Äôs Minister for Women and Family Affairs Selma Aliye Kavaf attracted much media attention when she made a controversial statement during an interview with the daily H√ºrriyet newspaper: ‚ÄúI believe that homosexuality is a biological disorder, a disease.

In 2011, Turkey witnessed the biggest pride march to date in southeast Europe, with participation reaching over 10.000, with support from parties such as CHP and BDP.^ http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25227029/ In 2013, the Istanbul pride march consisted of over 100.000 people, due in large part to the Gezi Park events taking place at the same time. = Conscription = The Conscription Law that dictates conscription as mandatory was introduced in 1919 at the start of the Turkish War of Liberation and has stayed in force since then. Compulsory military service in Turkey applies to all male citizens from twenty to forty years of age, with no legal alternative.Maddie (1927). 111 Sayili Askerlik Kanunu. There has been significant rise in critical discussions about the topic of mandatory conscription, however most government as well as military officials still seem to vigorously oppose the idea of changing Turkey's conscription system.As, inter alia, Erdoƒüan's reaction to the latest ruling on conscientious objection of the ECHR in the Er√ßep vs. Turkey case (CJ 22.11.2011, no. 43965/04). Those who oppose to perform their military service face three options: they can decide to become a deserter by either leaving the country, or trying to find other ways to escape the grip of the state; they can declare to be a conscientious objector, a decision which is followed by legal persecution in the form of a prison sentence; or they can try to find a way to get (legally) exempted within the framework of health regulations. Upon completion of their military service, Turks receive a certificate of completion; a certificate of discharge (colloquially referred to as the \\"pink certificate\\" or \\"rotten certificate\\") if they reveal their homosexual identity any time during the service, in accordance with the health regulation frameworks, or engage in homosexual acts.  Conditions for acquiring the \\"Pink Certificate\\"  = Military Health Regulations = The Military Health Regulation for the Turkish Armed Forces looks to the 1968 American Psychiatrists Association's definition of homosexuality as a disease in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual released that year. As such, homosexuals who are discharged or exempt from military service receive the same report as those who have mental or physical disabilities, and are considered to have a psychosexual disorder. In order to receive this report, individuals have to \\"prove their homosexuality,\\" undergoing what the Human Rights Watch calls \\"humiliating and degrading\\" examinations and tests. In October 2009 the report of the EU Commission on Enlargement stated that \\"The Turkish armed forces have a health regulation which defines homosexuality as a ‚Äòpsychosexual‚Äô illness and identifies homosexuals as unfit for military service. Conscripts who declare their homosexuality have to provide photographic proof (a photograph of the person on the receiving end of anal intercourse). A small number have had to undergo humiliating medical examinations.\\" These steps are taken, according to the military, to make sure that the system is not being exploited by deserters in order to skip mandatory military service, which has been a historical problem. = Acquiring the \\"Pink Certificate\\" = Individual experience of the process has varied depending on the assigned military ward, the examining experts, and the individual. The system has been undergoing change for the past few years: Lambdaistanbul's lawyer Fƒ±rat S√∂yle stated in 2012 that the rectal examinations, and the photographic evidence of anal intercourse have been dismissed as requirements when they gained worldwide and national media attention. The current and most common method is to conduct a series of psychological evaluations, consisting of personality tests and interviews with the draftee as well as with the draftee's family. The individual may even be confined to stay in the psychiatry ward for a short period of time, in a dormitory nicknamed \\"pink dorms,\\" if he is not considered to be effeminate enough, and a chance of recovery is recognized. For those who work for the military, as well as those in military school, homosexuality ends in the immediate termination of their jobs.  Three phases: Family interview, personal interview and committee delegation  To be discharged from the military with a \\"pink certificate,\\" typically, one must appeal to the hospital, or in the case of a draftee, ask to be consigned to the hospital. To undergo the examinations as a draftee, one must procure a written approval from the family doctor, and then go back to the military ward in order to receive a date for an appointment. The first phase will be the family interview, for which one will need a family member to come along. The questions will be asked to the family member, and can be anything along the lines of \\"Does he wear colorful clothing? Does he wear tight clothing? Does he wear accessories? Does he put on makeup? Does he behave feminine?\\" etc. In order to get to the second phase, the personal interview, the doctor must be sufficiently convinced by the answers. The second phase involves a series of tests and personal interviews. This typically includes the 600-question Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory, and the House-Tree-Person test, after which a personal interview is conducted. The questions asked here have a wide range, from \\"Are you a top or a bottom?\\" to \\"Do you receive psychological support?\\" The third phase involves an interview with a committee of doctors that will make the final decision, after asking more personal questions. The process of acquiring the discharge papers might take anywhere from a week to a few months, and it is not guaranteed that they will be granted ‚Äì the process can stop at any point in the way since the evaluations are based on entirely subjective perceptions and frameworks. The army discharges homosexuals only insofar as they are found to be a potential disruptive force in the military, and to establish a connection between sexual identity and disruptive behavior examiners look to the degree of \\"feminine\\" or \\"promiscuous\\" behavior.  Criticisms  Excluding homosexuals from the military has been widely regarded as a controversial topic, its negative effects not only confined to the context of military service. The process by which homosexuals are excluded from the military has received criticism from international and national actors for a multitude of reasons and has been called a \\"Human Rights Crisis\\" by the Human Rights Watch. The process correlates sexual orientation with arbitrary factors, such as \\"feminine\\" qualities or \\"promiscuity,\\" and propagates false narratives, homophobia and violence, inside and outside of the military. The involvement of family members means homosexuals are forced to come out, the pressure of which might deter the option to acquire the pink certificate, and continue military service hiding their identity. This leads increased homophobia, blackmail and violence towards homosexuals or effeminate men, since homosexuals in the army have no place to report such violent discrimination, and no protection from it. The insistence on family is a tactic that exploits feelings of shame, forcing the family to be interrogated about their child's sexual identity, often accompanied by inappropriate questions. Talking about homosexuality in the military is also a taboo, and challenging the status quo can be met with legal challenges, as it is considered illegal to insult the Turkish army. Furthermore, mandatory military service holds a very honorable place in Turkish culture, and not participating in this rite of passage carries a huge social stigma. The stigma stays with the individual for a lifetime, severely damaging the possibility of being hired, as employers typically request proof that the employee has done their military service. In addition, employers can discern the sexuality of potential employees from their discharge papers (differentiating between those discharged for physical or mental disabilities, and for homosexuality) further reducing chances of employment, and resulting in the employee being fired if it is ever found out.

Biography He was the son of Florentyn, a journalist and vice- director of the Warsaw Theatre Directorate. In 1899, he began his artistic studies in Munich where he was accompanied privately by Stanis≈Çaw Grocholski and Anton A≈æbe. There he debuted at the Kunstverein, where he exhibited his artwork. In 1900, he went to Krak√≥w where he studied at the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts, where he was taught by Jan Stanis≈Çawski, and since 1901, in Warsaw where he was taught by Konrad Krzy≈ºanowski. In 1902, he received his scholarship at the Society of the Incentive for Fine Arts (Towarzystwo Zachƒôty Sztuk Piƒôknych) and he went to the Parisian National School of Fine Arts, where he was taught sculpture by Hubert Ponscarm. From that point forward, he spent most of his years in Paris, and in 1904, he exhibited his artwork at the Salon d'Automne - from which Gustaw Gwozdecki became part of the Salon des ind√©pendants. He regularly took part in exhibitions in Warsaw, Pozna≈Ñ, and Vienna. In 1914, he co-lead the Polish Academy of Fine Arts (Polska Akademia Malarstwa) in Paris. From 1916, he had travelled extensively, and from 1917 to 1927 he permanently stayed in New York City, where he was the leader of Annual Salons. During his time in the United States of America he grew interest in the Polish communities. He advocated Polish fine arts in the United States of America and in France, and was a member of the Society of Polish Artists \\"Sztuka\\" (Stowarzyszenie Artyst√≥w Polskich \\"Sztuka\\") and the Society of Polish Artists \\"Rytm\\" (Stowarzyszenie Artyst√≥w Polskich \\"Rytm\\") where he had exhibited his artwork. He died vehemently in his workplace at the age of fifty four years. He painted landscapes, portraits, caryatids and still life. He made sculptures out of marble and gypsum. His artwork contains simple figures, with repleted rich tones. Many of his artwork is based around the life of native people. His primary artwork made him one of Poland's first modernists and expressionists. After 1910, he moved to Fauvism, by which his artwork gained positive views from French fine arts critics. His artwork was promoted by his friend, Guillaume Apollinaire, which were part of the journal \\"La Plume\\". Currently, Gustaw Gwozdecki's artwork is located in various locations, which include: National Museum in Warsaw, Pozna≈Ñ, and Krak√≥w, other international places include: the Society of Polish History and Literature (Towarzystwo Historyczno-Literackie) in Paris; the Gallery of Fine Arts nearby the Yale University; and the New York City based Kosciuszko Foundation in the United States of America.

Its use is recommended - e.g. in the European Commission Impact assessment guidelines and by the European Science Academies \\\\- when a sensitivity analysis (SA) of a model-based study is meant to demonstrate the robustness of the evidence provided by the model, but in a context where the inference feeds into a policy or decision-making process.Saltelli, A., van der Sluijs, J., Guimar√£es Pereira, √Ç., 2013, Funtowiz, S.O., What do I make of your Latinorum? Sensitivity auditing of mathematical modelling, International Journal Foresight and Innovation Policy, 9 (2/3/4), 213‚Äì234. Approach In settings where scientific work feeds into policy, the framing of the analysis, its institutional context, and the motivations of its author may become highly relevant, and a pure SA - with its focus on parametric (i.e. quantified) uncertainty - may be insufficient. The emphasis on the framing may, among other things, derive from the relevance of the policy study to different constituencies that are characterized by different norms and values, and hence by a different story about \`what the problem is' and foremost about \`who is telling the story'. Most often the framing includes implicit assumptions, which could be political (e.g. which group needs to be protected) all the way to technical (e.g. which variable can be treated as a constant). In order to take these concerns into due consideration, sensitivity auditing extends the instruments of sensitivity analysis to provide an assessment of the entire knowledge- and model- generating process. It takes inspiration from NUSAP,Van der Sluijs JP, Craye M, Funtowicz S, Kloprogge P, Ravetz J, Risbey J (2005) Combining quantitative and qualitative measures of uncertainty in model based environmental assessment: the NUSAP system. Risk Analysis 25(2):481-492 a method used to qualify the worth (quality) of quantitative information with the generation of \`Pedigrees' of numbers. Likewise, sensitivity auditing has been developed to provide pedigrees of models and model-based inferences. Sensitivity auditing is especially suitable in an adversarial context, where not only the nature of the evidence, but also the degree of certainty and uncertainty associated to the evidence, is the subject of partisan interests. These are the settings considered in Post-normal science Funtowicz, S. O. & Ravetz, J. R. 1993. Science for the post-normal age.

Sensitivity auditing is recommended by the European Commission for use in impact assessments in order to improve the quality of model-based evidence used to support policy decisions.European Commission. (2015). Guidelines on Impact Assessment - European Commission European Commission Better Regulation Guidelines Similar recommendations can be found in the report from the European Academies‚Äô association of science for policy SAPEA . The rules Sensitivity auditing is summarised by seven rules or guiding principles: # Check against the rhetorical use of mathematical modeling. Question addressed: is the model being used to elucidate or to obfuscate?; # Adopt an \`assumption hunting' attitude. Question addressed: what was \`assumed out'? What are the tacit, pre- analytical, possibly normative assumptions underlying the analysis?; # Detect Garbage In Garbage Out (GIGO). Issue addressed: artificial deflation of uncertainty operated in order to achieve a desired inference at a desired level of confidence. It also works on the reverse practice, the artificial inflation of uncertainties, e.g. to deter regulation; # Find sensitive assumptions before they find you. Issue addressed: anticipate criticism by doing careful homework via sensitivity and uncertainty analyses before publishing results. # Aim for transparency. Issue addressed: stakeholders should be able to make sense of, and possibly replicate, the results of the analysis; # Do the right sums, which is more important than \`Do the sums right'. Issue addressed: is the viewpoint of a relevant stakeholder being neglected? Who decided that there was a problem and what the problem was? # Focus the analysis on the key question answered by the model, exploring the entire space of the assumptions holistically. Issue addressed: don't perform perfunctory analyses that just \`scratch the surface' of the system's potential uncertainties. The first rule looks at the instrumental use of mathematical modeling to advance one's agenda. This use is called rhetorical, or strategic, like the use of Latin to confuse or obfuscate an interlocutor. The second rule about \`assumption hunting' is a reminder to look for what was assumed when the model was originally framed. Modes are full of ceteris paribus assumptions. For example, in economics, the model can predict the result of a shock to a given set of equations, assuming that all the rest - all other input variables and inputs - remain equal, but in real life \\"ceteris\\" are never \\"paribus\\", meaning that variables tend to be linked with one another, so they cannot realistically change independently of one another. Rule three is about artificially exaggerating or playing down uncertainties wherever convenient. The tobacco lobbies exaggerated the uncertainties about the health effects of smoking according to Oreskes and Conway,Oreskes N, Conway EM (2010) Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming. Bloomsbury Press, New York. while advocates of the death penalty played down the uncertainties in the negative relations between capital punishment and crime rate.Leamer EE (2010) Tantalus on the road to asymptopia. Journal of Economic Perspectives 4(2):31-46. Clearly the latter wanted the policy, in this case the death penalty, and were interested in showing that the supporting evidence was robust. In the former case the lobbies did not want regulation (e.g. bans on tobacco smoking in public places) and were hence interested in amplifying the uncertainty in the smoking-health effect causality relationship. Rule four is about \`confessing' uncertainties before going public with the analysis. This rule is also one of the commandments of applied econometrics according to Kennedy:Kennedy, P. (2007) A Guide to Econometrics, 5th ed., p.396, Blackwell Publishing, Oxford. \`Thou shall confess in the presence of sensitivity. Corollary: Thou shall anticipate criticism'. According to this rule, a sensitivity analysis should be performed before the results of a modeling study are published. There are many good reasons for doing this, one being that a carefully performed sensitivity analysis often uncovers plain coding mistakes or model inadequacies. The other is that, more often than not, the analysis reveals uncertainties that are larger than those anticipated by the model developers. Rule five is about presenting the results of the modeling study in a transparent fashion. Both rules originate from the practice of impact assessment, where a modeling study presented without a proper SA, or as originating from a model which is in fact a black box, may end up being rejected by stakeholders.Saltelli, A., Funtowicz, S., 2014, When all models are wrong: More stringent quality criteria are needed for models used at the science-policy interface, Issues in Science and Technology, Winter 2014, 79-85. Both rules four and five suggest that reproducibility may be a condition for transparency and that this latter may be a condition for legitimacy.Saltelli, A., Funtowicz, S., 2015 Evidence-based policy at the end of the Cartesian Dream: The case of mathematical modelling, in \\"The end of the Cartesian dream\\", Edited by √Çngela Guimar√£es Pereira, and Silvio Funtowicz, Routledge, p. 147-162. Rule six, about doing the right sum, is not far from the \`assumption-hunting' rule; it is just more general. It deals with the fact that often an analyst is set to work on an analysis arbitrarily framed to the advantage of a party. Sometime this comes via the choice of the discipline selected to do the analysis. Thus an environmental impact problem may be framed through the lenses of economics, and presented as a cost benefit or risk analysis, while the issue has little to do with costs or benefits or risks and a lot to do with profits, controls, and norms. An example is in Marris et al.Marris, C., Wynne, B., Simmons, P., and Weldon, Sue. 2001. Final Report of the PABE Research Project Funded by the Commission of European Communities, Contract number: FAIR CT98-3844 DG12-SSMI) Dec, Lancaster: University of Lancaster. on the issue of GMOs, mostly presented in the public discourse as a food safety issue while the spectrum of concerns of GMO opponents - including lay citizens - appears broader. An approach which extends this particular rule to a spectrum of plausible frames is the so- called Quantitative storytelling. Rule seven is about avoiding a perfunctory sensitivity analysis. A SA where each uncertain input is moved at a time while leaving all other inputs fixed is perfunctory.Saltelli, A., Annoni, P., 2010, How to avoid a perfunctory sensitivity analysis, Environmental Modeling and Software, 25, 1508-1517 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2010.04.012. A true SA should make an honest effort at exploring all uncertainties simultaneously, leaving the model free to display its full nonlinear and possibly non-additive behaviour. A similar point is made in Sam L. Savage's book \`The flaw of averages'.Savage SL (2009) The Flaw of Averages: Why We Underestimate Risk in the Face of Uncertainty, Wiley.  Questions addressed by sensitivity auditing  In conclusion, these rules are meant to help an analyst to anticipate criticism, in particular relating to model-based inference feeding into an impact assessment. What questions and objections may be received by the modeler? Here is a possible list: * You treated X as a constant when we know it is uncertain by at least 30% * It would be sufficient for a 5% error in X to make your statement about Z fragile * Your model is but one of the plausible models - you neglected model uncertainty * You have instrumentally maximized your level of confidence in the results * Your model is a black box - why should I trust your results? * You have artificially inflated the uncertainty * Your framing is not socially robust * You are answering the wrong question  Sensitivity auditing in the European Commission Guidelines  Sensitivity auditing is described in the European Commission Guidelines for impact assessment . Relevants excerpts are (pp. 392): :\\"[‚Ä¶ ]where there is a major disagreement among stakeholders about the nature of the problem, ‚Ä¶ then sensitivity auditing is more suitable but sensitivity analysis is still advisable as one of the steps of sensitivity auditing.\\" :\\"Sensitivity auditing, [‚Ä¶] is a wider consideration of the effect of all types of uncertainty, including structural assumptions embedded in the model, and subjective decisions taken in the framing of the problem.\\" :\\"The ultimate aim is to communicate openly and honestly the extent to which particular models can be used to support policy decisions and what their limitations are.\\" :\\"In general sensitivity auditing stresses the idea of honestly communicating the extent to which model results can be trusted, taking into account as much as possible all forms of potential uncertainty, and to anticipate criticism by third parties.\\"  SAPEA report  The European Academies‚Äô association of science for policy SAPEA describes in detail sensitivity auditing in its 2019 report entitled ‚ÄúMaking sense of science for policy under conditions of complexity and uncertainty‚Äù Science Advice for Policy by European Academies, Making sense of science for policy under conditions of complexity and uncertainty, Berlin, 2019..

It was built in 1967 as a replacement to older locomotives that were \\"trade-ins\\" for new units in the 1960s. NP 3617 now is a display piece and is in restoration for operation at the Lake Superior Railroad Museum. History In the mid-1960s Northern Pacific started to replace its first-generation diesel locomotives. Northern Pacific's first second-generation diesel locomotive purchases came from General Electric. But General Motors' Electro-Motive Division was determined to regain a lost customer, and persuaded NP to buy four SD45 locomotives, contingent on the performance of the EMD's demonstrators. After the loan of a pair of demonstrators, EMD secured an additional order for sixteen locomotives, and later ten more. A forth order for 20 was still outstanding when the NP merged into Burlington Northern in March 1970. NP 3617 was a part of the second order of SD45s purchased by Northern Pacific. NP 3617 was built in April 1967 and was delivered like all of NP's SD45s in their black and gold freight paint scheme. At , the SD45s were the largest on Northern Pacific's diesel locomotive fleet, and were allocated to the transcontinental freight locomotive pool. NP 3617 operated on the Northern Pacific only 3 years until the Burlington Northern merger. The 3617 received a new number, 6417 and was eventually repainted in BN's cascade green scheme. The 6417 then operated on the Burlington Northern until its retirement in March 1987. Wisconsin Central Ltd. began operation in October 1987, and the 6417 was one of the ex-BN SD45s that the railroad utilised at the start of its operations. The locomotive would be renumbered twice more, to 6485 and later 7495. Canadian National acquired the Wisconsin Central in 2001. The 7495 continued as a WC unit until 2007, when it was donated to the Lake Superior Railroad museum in Duluth, MN. From 2007 until 2015, extensive restoration was completed to restore the locomotive to its original Northern Pacific appearance. It was at one point sent to North Dakota to be repainted. Among being repainted its gyrating- warning light on its nose was restored. Its restoration, as of October 2015, was largely completed, but some electronic equipment is to be installed to complete its restoration as an operation unit. Present-day operations Because 3617 is not yet operational, it is only displayed inside the Lake Superior Railroad Museum. Less than a week after being returned to the museum in September 2015, it was featured during LSRM's annual \\"Railfan Weekend\\". Because 3617 could not operate on its own, the LSRM contributed Soo Line 2500 as a helper. Since then it has been displayed in the museum, awaiting electrical work before going into service on the North Shore Scenic Railroad.

Prior to his legal studies he worked as a financial analyst, while after becoming a lawyer he specialized in mergers, acquisitions and corporate finance on Bay Street.Meet Raj Grewal, Liberal.ca.  Federal politics  Grewal's nomination to represent the Liberal Party of Canada in the 2015 election in Brampton East was attended by some controversy, as initial media reports indicated that a brawl took place at the nominating convention when several hundred members were denied the ability to vote. Police attended the scene in a crowd control capacity.Ethan Lou, Brawl mars Brampton Liberal nomination, The Toronto Star, September 21, 2014. Liberal Party officials subsequently denied that there had been any fighting at the scene.Roger Belgrave, Liberal party says no fists thrown in Brampton East nomination battle, The Brampton Guardian, September 23, 2014. In early 2018, the Ethics Commissioner launched an investigation into whether Grewal violated the conflict-of-interest code when he invited Yusuf Yenilmez, the head of Zgemi Inc., to multiple events during Justin Trudeau‚Äôs trip to India. Grewal had been paid by Zgemi Inc. for legal advice during the previous year.

The Toronto Star has described him as ‚Äúa breath of fresh air,‚Äù The National Post has called him a ‚Äúmaverick,‚Äù and the CBC referred to him as Ottawa's ‚Äúleast predictable MP.‚Äù and Ottawa's ‚Äúleast predictable MP.‚Äù He has voted against party lines when arguing for better assisted dying laws, declaring ISIS guilty of genocide, expunging cannabis possession records, ending public fossil fuel subsidies, among other issues, and he maintains a public record to explain each dissenting vote. Erskine-Smith has written and spoken about the need for greater independence in Parliament, and to highlight the importance of thoughtful and respectful disagreement. For example, in an op-ed in The Toronto Star, he wrote: ‚ÄúNo political party represents our views perfectly. We find the party that best represents our views and values, and we engage, debate and organize to bring both our party and country closer to those objectives. I am a Liberal MP and I continue to support our Liberal government. But that does not mean that I support every government action taken, or that I ought to refrain from public disagreement. In contrast to blind partisan loyalty, we promised to empower MPs and their communities through more free votes in the House of Commons.‚Äù  Animal welfare and Bill C-246  In 2015, Erskine-Smith seconded Bill S-203, the Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act, that became law in June 2019. The bill prohibits the captivity of cetaceans and requires permits to import and export them to and from Canada. Erskine-Smith spoke to the house about the importance of the bill in June 2018. On February 26, 2016, Erskine-Smith introduced Bill C-246, the Modernizing Animal Protections Act, to ban the import of shark fins and make Canada's animal cruelty laws tougher. The bill won support from EndCruelty, a coalition of Canadians who support stronger animal protection laws. Due to concerns from animal use lobbyists, the bill was defeated 198 to 84 at second reading. Two years later, a government bill addressing similar concerns was tabled by Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould. She acknowledged Erskine-Smith's efforts as a precursor to the government's legislation. The defeat of Erskine-Smith's Bill C-246 led to the creation of the Liberal Animal Welfare Caucus in 2017. On September 5, 2017, Erskine-Smith wrote a piece in Now Magazine addressing his veganism and the importance of a social change towards the treatment of animals. = Animal welfare awards = In 2016, Erskine-Smith received the Humane Legislator Award from Animal Justice for his efforts to modernize Canada's federal animal protection laws with Bill C-246.

Erskine-Smith introduced a Liberal caucus policy resolution to address the opioid crisis through a public health approach, and it was adopted as the second overall priority by the grassroots Liberal membership at the Liberal Policy Convention in Halifax in April 2018.  Bill C-460  To ensure more people access treatment, Erskine-Smith introduced a bill to remove criminal sanctions for low-level possession and to reduce the stigma associated with seeking treatment. In 2018, Erskine-Smith appeared on CBC's Power & Politics to speak about his disappointment in the Liberal government's signing of the United States‚Äô ‚ÄòWar on Drugs‚Äô document. He argued it brought the conversation about drugs away from a health issue, which ran counter to his push for drug decriminalization and domestic policy at the time.  Cannabis record expungement  Erskine-Smith seconded a bill introduced by NDP MP Murray Rankin. In March 2019, Erskine-Smith wrote an op- ed for NOW Magazine where he discussed his support for MP Rankin's bill, stating that only expungements would address the injustice of cannabis criminalization.

The Silicon Valley representatives were asked to defend their companies' records on protecting users' data. In August 2019, Erskine-Smith wrote an op- ed for the Toronto Star expressing his desire for the right to be forgotten. He explained that in an increasingly connected, online world citizens should have the right to hide content published about them from search engines if the individual‚Äôs privacy is being seriously violated. = Current Parliament (43rd Parliament, 2019-Present) =  Committee work  Erskine-Smith is a member of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology.  2020 Private members bills  Erskine-Smith introduced two bills in February 2020.

He is a member of the New Democratic Party (NDP) and serves as the party's critic for the Treasury Board and the deputy critic for Ethics in the 42nd Canadian Parliament. He is the son of former NDP deputy leader Bill Blaikie, who held the riding from 1979 to 2008, and brother of former NDP President Rebecca Blaikie. Blaikie was nominated as the NDP candidate for his father's former riding ahead of the 2015 election. He defeated Conservative incumbent Lawrence Toet by only 61 votes, the lowest margin of victory for any Canadian MP elected that year. He was the only non- Liberal elected from a Winnipeg riding, as the Liberals rose from being the third-largest party to Government, while the Conservatives fell from Government to Official Opposition, and the NDP from Official Opposition to third-party status. Blaikie led in most pre-election opinion polling, but a last-minute Liberal surge both in Winnipeg and nationwide resulted in him only defeating Toet by 51 votes. He defeated Toet in a 2019 rematch. Early life and education Daniel Blaikie was born to Brenda and Bill Blaikie in the northeast Winnipeg suburb of Transcona. Before entering the trades, Blaikie studied philosophy and history at the University of Winnipeg, from which he graduated with an undergraduate degree.

Tabbara is currently facing assault, break and enter, and harassment charges. He left from the Liberal Party Caucus to sit as an Independent as a result of these charges. Early life Marwan Tabbara was born in Beirut, Lebanon on August 23, 1984. Four years later, his family immigrated to Canada to flee the ongoing Lebanese Civil War. Early career After receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and Government from the University of Guelph, Tabbara took several construction jobs in the summer before working at the Frito Lay plant in Cambridge, where he worked as a line technician. He also worked as a field supervisor for a management company doing quality control work within the automotive industry. Member of Parliament = 2015 comments on the Middle East = For the 2015 federal election, during a Kitchener South‚ÄîHespeler debate, Tabbara mentioned that Jean Chr√©tien refused to send troops into Afghanistan when he was prime minister even though Canada began sending troops to Afghanistan in 2001 during Chretien's tenure. Tabbara's statement was challenged by Conservative candidate Marian Gagne to which he replied \\"So is bombing Syrian children OK?\\" Tabbara apologized for the comments. = Criminal charges = On April 9, 2020, Tabbara was arrested by police in Guelph, Ontario on charges that included two counts of assault, one count of \\"break and enter and commit an indictable offence\\" and one count of criminal harassment. On June 5, 2020 it was reported that he is \\"stepping back from the Liberal caucus\\" but not resigning as an MP. Tabbara was jailed and bailed on Easter Friday 2020, allegedly nobody was informed about it, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, apparently until June because the police and judicial systems failed to release the information to the public. His bail hearing was done remotely by a Justice of the Peace 120km away from the jailhouse he occupied. Tabbara, who allegedly successfully hid the matter from his caucus until 5 June, now sits as an independent MP. On August 28, 2020 it was reported that the trial was pushed back until the end of September. =Sexual harassment allegations= The Liberals looked into detailed allegations of misconduct made against the Kitchener South-Hespeler MP that included inappropriate touching and unwelcome sexual comments directed at a female staffer during the 2015 election campaign.

Life and work  At the age of 15, Jung began to contribute as a freelance reporter to the regional daily newspaper Nordkurier on topics which included the year he spent as an exchange school pupil in Texas. In 2006, he moved to Berlin, enrolling to study business and law at Humboldt University, but he did not graduate. In 2011, he started his career as a journalist interviewing and editing coverage for the radio show Medienmagazin on radioeins, hosted by Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg. Initially, Jung published uncut interviews on his YouTube channel. The German commercial television station Joiz.Germany began to broadcast episodes of Jung & Naiv six months later, but stopped in November 2014 when the station became insolvent. Notable guests on Jung's show were politicians, journalists and other commentators, including Peer Steinbr√ºck, J√ºrgen Trittin, Heiko Maas, Jeremy Scahill, Noam Chomsky, and Glenn Greenwald. In 2015, Jung shifted his focus to the Bundespressekonferenzen, the regular press conferences of the German government. In mid-April, he began to post shorter, topic-related videos excerpted from his full-length videos on YouTube. He also began a collaborative effort with Stefan Schulz, a journalist from the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.

She is credited for developing photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin (Visudyne), the first pharmacologic therapy for retinal disease. She also co-discovered the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in eye disease and demonstrated the therapeutic potential of VEGF inhibitors, forming the scientific basis of anti-VEGF therapy for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and related conditions.  Early life and education Joan Miller (n√©e Whitten) was born in Toronto, Canada, and attended Bishop Strachan School. She received her SB in biology from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she also rowed crew for four years, taking 2nd place in the Head of the Charles Regatta in 1978 and 3rd nationally in 1980. She received her MD at Harvard Medical School in 1985 and interned at Newton-Wellesley Hospital; she then completed residency training in ophthalmology in the Harvard Medical School Department of Ophthalmology in 1989, and a research and clinical fellowship in vitreoretinal surgery at Massachusetts Eye and Ear (the primary affiliate hospital of the Harvard Medical School Department of Ophthalmology) in 1991.  Medical and academic career  In 1991, Miller joined Mass. Eye and Ear as an assistant in ophthalmology. She became an assistant surgeon in 1992, an associate surgeon in 1996, and a surgeon in 2002. Miller became chief of ophthalmology at Mass. Eye and Ear in 2003, and in 2009 she also became chief of ophthalmology at Massachusetts General Hospital. Miller is the first woman to serve as chief of either department. Miller is a faculty member of Harvard Medical School (HMS) in the Department of Ophthalmology, beginning with her 1991 appointment as an instructor in ophthalmology. She was promoted to assistant professor of ophthalmology in 1994, associate professor of ophthalmology in 1998, and professor of ophthalmology in 2002. In 2003, Miller became chair of the HMS Department of Ophthalmology and Henry Willard Williams Professor of Ophthalmology. In 2017, she was promoted to David Glendenning Cogan Professor of Ophthalmology. Miller is the first female ophthalmologist to achieve the rank of Professor at HMS and the first woman to chair the Department of Ophthalmology.  Research and clinical innovations  =Verteporfin Photodynamic Therapy (Visudyne)= Verteporfin In the 1990s, through a series of preclinical and clinical studies, Miller, Evangelos Gragoudas, and colleagues at Mass. Eye and Ear and Mass General Hospital (in collaboration with QLT PhotoTherapeutics Inc. and Novartis) developed photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin (Visudyne). Verteporfin, a light-sensitive dye, is injected systemically, and a laser specifically activates the drug in the choroidal vessels, blocking vessel leakage and preventing further vessel growth. On April 12, 2000, verteporfin became the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating AMD. In 2000, Visudyne was selected by Popular Science magazine for the \\"Best of What's New\\" Award, and by Business Week as one of the \\"Best Products of 2000.\\" For her role in pioneering the pharmacologic treatment of retinal disease, Miller delivered the 2002 Jules Gonin Lecture, an award that recognizes individuals \\"for making a significant contribution to the understanding and treatment of eye diseases.\\" =Anti-VEGF therapy for ocular disease= During the development of Visudyne, Miller and colleagues also examined the molecular mechanisms of ocular neovascularization. In 1994, using a primate model, Miller (along with Anthony Adamis, Patricia D'Amore, and others) were the first to correlate VEGF with ocular neovascularization in vivo. That same year, Miller and colleagues (including Adamis and Judah Folkman) were the first to report increased levels of VEGF in the eyes of patients with vascular eye disease (diabetic retinopathy). These findings were replicated in a larger study by Lloyd Paul Aiello and George King of Joslin Diabetes Center and Napoleone Ferrara of Genentech. Drs. Miller, Gragoudas, Ferrara, and Adamis also demonstrated that introducing VEGF into normal primate eyes could cause several intraocular vascular disorders, such as retinal ischemia and neovascular glaucoma. These studies strongly correlated VEGF protein with pathological ocular neovascularization both in patients and in experimental models. In a series of parallel and collaborative preclinical studies, Miller and colleagues effectively blocked ocular neovascularization with a VEGF-neutralizing antibody (bevacizumab), a VEGF-neutralizing antibody fragment (ranibizumab), and a VEGF-neutralizing aptamer EYE001 (later known as pegaptanib). These studies not only reinforced VEGF's key role in ocular pathology, but also provided the scientific foundation for clinical trials of multiple anti-VEGF therapies. In July 2005, Miller presented data from the Phase III MARINA trial of ranibizumab (Lucentis) at the 23rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Retina Specialists (ASRS) in Montreal, Canada. In the annual Breakthrough of the Year awards by the journal Science, anti-VEGF therapy for AMD was recognized as one of the top ten scientific distinctions of the year 2006.

In 1869, the first session of the Dunedin diocesan synod rejected Jenner's claim to the see; he very reluctantly resigned the see of Dunedin in 1871, the same year that S. T. Nevill was consecrated and enthroned Bishop of Dunedin. The proper procedures for the legal election of bishops to new dioceses in the independent colonial churches had not been established, so Jenner's possession of the See by right of his appointment (in England, by Longley) and consecration (in England, to a See not then erected) alone was dubious. Jenner maintained his legal right to the See right up until his resignation, encouraged by English and New Zealand bishops and synods. Despite several attempts to appoint him, he was never licensed as a bishop diocesan or assistant, in England or abroad; but he retained his East Kent living (undertaking occasional bishop's duties) until his death at Preston.

It is the longest running bilingual newspaper that is printed in both English and Spanish in California. History El Tecolote can trace its roots to student activism from 1970. The newspaper began as a project in a La Raza Studies class at San Francisco State University that was created by Juan Gonzales, who wanted to try to channel more Latinos into journalism. The final project of this class was to create a bilingual newspaper in English and Spanish. The founder and first editor was Juan Gonzales. It was first printed and came out on August 24, 1970. It was named El Tecolote, Spanish for \\"The Owl.\\" Its signature logo is the wise owl. In 1971 the newspaper moved out of the university and into the Mission District, becoming now part of the community. The paper is published and managed by Accion Latina, a nonprofit organization that promotes social activities that help empower the Latino community in San Francisco. Latino community newspaper The newspaper is written primarily for the Latino community in the Mission District, capturing the everyday life of Latinos, and focusing on local and community affairs that affect them, and covering stories that are often ignored by the mainstream media. The paper writes original news stories, telling news from the Latino point of view. Promoting Latino civil rights, helping to create community identity, and writing stories about the culture of the Latino community are some of the goals of the paper. The paper is largely staffed by volunteers, and many college students and young journalists have written for the paper. New Media The paper has met the challenges of technological change in media by adapting to the digital age by adding a website and now also having online publication. The stories that come out in its printed newspaper are picked from the stories that have come from its online publication. And the paper now has a Facebook page, a Twitter account, and is on Instagram. Coverage and distribution The paper covers the Mission District and the surrounding areas of Excelsior, Bernal Heights, and the East Bay. The paper has thousands of people reading it online, and the paper also distributes 10,000 free copies every two weeks throughout the Mission District and the East Bay by way of restaurants, libraries, clinics and social service centers.

By preaching about Lord Jesus, he started to draw the Indian people towards Christianity. During that period. St. Thomas started healing many people from deadly diseases. By doing those miraculous things, his fame began to spread across Kerala and neighbouring Tamil Nadu. During the first century A.D., the southern tip of India, was under the regime of Pandya Ruler Kandappa Rasa. The king and his family was suffering from a lot of diseases. During this period, he came to know about the miraculous power of St. Thomas through the traders who used to visit Kerala for selling their spices. On hearing about St. Thomas, the king left for Kerala immediately to meet him and described his sufferings and brought St. Thomas to Tamil Nadu. With the blessing of Lord Jesus, St. Thomas healed the sufferings of King and his family. The king was surprised by the miraculous powers of St. Thomas. St. Thomas preached Christianity to the King and his followers and they soon started following Christianity. St. Thomas renamed the King as \\"Sabor\\". As a mark of respect, the King donated 3 cents of land to St. Thomas to build a church for Mother Mary. As per tradition in those days, St. Thomas built the church with palm leaves. This piece of land was the first in India to be donated to Christianity. In this church, St. Thomas embibed a holy cross made of wood and instructed the people to pray the cross. St. Thomas marked the letters INRI on the top portion of the cross. The church built on 3 cents of land donated to St. Thomas is the \\" Athisaya Manalmatha Church \\".http://connectgalaxy.com/pages/view/183553/athisaya-manal-matha-shrine St. Xavier 's visit In the 16th century, St.Xavier started preaching Christianity in India.

Completed in 1310, the structure is one of the oldest worldwide that was used as lighthouse (1814‚Äì2014) and still standing. This former beacon, watchtower and lighthouse is also the oldest building in Hamburg and oldest secular building on the German coast.  History  Neuwerk Tower (1751), before it was turned into the \\"Great Lighthouse\\". Neuwerk Tower at storm surge (around 1840) Feuerbl√ºse Neuwerk (first erected 1644) The construction of the 'new werk' was started in 1300. It was completed after ten years in 1310. The style of a keep matches the common Norman tower type of the time. Contrary to some literature, the tower was built in this form from the beginning. The fire in the 1360s destroyed most of the wooden elements and it had to undergo major reconstruction. The original roof was made of lead, and was replaced by copper in 1474. This was again replaced in 1558 by a tiled roof and by a new copper roof following that. The copper was then used for military purposes in 1916 reconstructed later. The original purpose was to host troops to defend the ships entering and leaving the Elbe from sea and beach pirates. The tower was also refuge for the farmers on the island during storm surges and survivors of shipwrecks over the centuries.e.g. HMS Proserpine (1777) The tower marked the most northern measuring point for the triangulation of the Kingdom of Hannover by Carl Friedrich Gauss in July 1825. Parts of this triangulation net were depicted on the back of last series of the 10 Deutsche Mark note (1989‚Äì2001). The tower of Neuwerk is officially Hamburg's oldest building. A church in Sinstorf is actually older, but only part of Hamburg since the Greater Hamburg Act of 1937. The tower is protected under cultural heritage management since 1924 and the surrounding dwelling hill since 1971. It is used as viewpoint, guesthouse and restaurant. = Lighthouse = Before the tower was turned into a lighthouse in 1814, the dangerous reef and sandbank of Scharh√∂rn was marked by multiple beacons and bearing aids, most importantly the Scharh√∂rnbake. The most important was the bearing of wooden beacons north-west end of Neuwerk and its tower to find the smaller beacon in the open sea. Today's \\"Nord-Bake\\" still shows the form of a beacon to overshadow an open fire once the ships reached this bearing. The Carta Marina shows a fire beacon on \\"Nuge uirk\\" as early as 1539, but other sources mention the open coal fire beacon not until 1644: It was a navigational aid during night time. This required 1000 tons of imported Scottish coal a year starting from 1761. This coal contained more bitumen and burned much brighter than the usual German hard coal.Neuwerk, F√∂derverein Leutchtturm Roter Sand The towers and beacons of Neuwerk (1825/1831) The tower was only turned into a lighthouse on December 20, 1814. The first lamp was made of 21 hollow wick oil lamps with parabolic reflectors and burned on colza oil and kerosene starting 1870. A fresnel lens of measuring a focal length of 700 mm was installed 1892 together with a five-wick kerosene lamp, to improve the brightness even further. This lens is still used today.Leuchtturm Neuwerk ‚Äûgeht‚Äú‚Äì Feuer bleibt! The lamp was again improved in 1908, to be first electrified in 1942.

They had party legal existence between January 1988 and July 1991. It was founded on 11 September 1983 by former members of Fatherland and Liberty and civilian supporters of the dictatorship. The party constitution was signed on April 15, 1987, the Electoral Service ordered his publication in the official Journal on 29 May 1987. Finally, by resolution O-56 of 29 January 1988, the Electoral Service officially signed up the party. This party held various positions during the military regime, including more than 70 municipalities. However, the top-level positions were occupied by representatives of the neoliberal right (next to National Renewal and the Independent Democratic Union and close to the economic right of employers), who always tried to displace the nationalist right because it was not in agreement with the neoliberal economic policies of the Chicago Boys (preferably militants in the UDI and RN to a lesser extent). In addition, nationalists were considered statist, which clashed sharply with the neoliberals. On the political side there were also a number of differences; even many historians point out that if Pinochet had followed the postulates of the nationalists, they would have had more public support as the AN was representative of the political right and not economic. In the 1988 plebiscite supported the Yes option. In late 1988 it created the short-lived Democratic Confederation (Confederaci√≥n Democr√°tica) with the National Party (a faction that supported Pinochet), the Radical Democracy, the Social Democrat Party, the Liberal Democrat Party of Chile, the Democratic Party of Chile, the Free Democratic Centre and the Civic Committees. The confederation disappeared in 1989 during negotiations for parliamentary candidates that year. In the 1989 elections, the party conducted the electoral pact \\"Alliance of Centre\\" with another ruling party, Radical Democracy, in spite of which failed to elect deputies and senators. By the election results the party entered the grounds for cancellation of its legal existence, but this was corrected with the merger with its coalition partners and other smaller parties. On May 7, 1990 the National Advance merged with the Radical Democracy and the National Party to form the National Democracy of Centre, and the registry of the party was void on June 17 of the same year. National Democracy of Centre was later renamed as National Party (like one of their predecessors) on December 3, 1991.

Early life Thomas Burnett Gordon was born in Pitlurg, Scotland, the son of Robert Gordon, 6th Laird of Pitlurg and Catherine Burnett, daughter of Sir Thomas Burnett, 1st Baronet of Leys. Thomas Gordon's grandfather, Robert, 1st Laird of Straloch, was a Scottish geographer, mathematician, and antiquary.

He was a graduate of King's College, Cambridge. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_College,_Cambridge) Thomas purchased several hundred acres bounded by Cedar Brook in what is today Plainfield, New Jersey. He erected a wigwam on the property in the late 17th century, and later sold the estate to John Webster, who, in 1717, erected the oldest portions of Cedar Brook Farm, Plainfield's oldest building. The Gordon family were proprietors of Perth-Amboy, NJ (originally called New Aberdeen in the Jersey Colony). In 1692-1693 he was appointed Deputy Secretary and Register for the East Jersey Proprietors, Clerk of the Court of Common Right, Register of the Court of Chancery, Judge of the Probate Court and a Commissioner to try small cases. On November 10, 1703 he represented the town of Perth Amboy in the first General Assembly of the newly reunited Province of New Jersey and in the same year was appointed Register of the Council of Proprietors of East Jersey. At the Assembly of 5 May 1708 he was elected Speaker in place of Samuel Jennings, who was indisposed. On 28 April 1709 he was made Chief Justice of New Jersey by Governor John Lovelace, but within a few months was appointed Receiver General of the Province, holding the post until 1719. He was also appointed Attorney General (January 22, 1714) and a member of the Council by Governor Robert Hunter, in which latter position he served until 1722. Personal life He married twice; firstly Helen and secondly Janet Mudie, the daughter of David Mudie of Perth Amboy. He had children with both wives. but none of the children from his first marriage survived childhood. Death He died in 1722 and is buried in St. Peter's Churchyard, Perth Amboy, NJ. https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid;=6837167 The church property was deeded by Thomas B.

The parish had become incorporated just four years earlier receiving its charter from King George I. The old corner stone bearing the date 1685, the oldest historic relic of Perth Amboy now built into the chancel wall of the church, was originally probably the stone in the stone grist mill of David Mudie which was on the same site with the present church.

The film's producers gathered feedback from Internet users through various channels including Facebook, Twitter, Google Docs, YouTube, and a custom-built forum. A YouTube channel called FliteTest grew to have nearly 370,000 subscribers and became the core community that provided feedback to Kapper and his team. The team shared a beat sheet and a conceptual trailer with the community and used its feedback to work on costumes and props. The community's feedback also resulted in the addition of new scenes and characters. With a production budget of US$300,000, filming began in mid- summer 2014 and lasted over 12 weeks. Filming mainly took place in Canton, Ohio with the director's son, Christian Kapper, as the protagonist. A 10-episode web series was produced, with each episode being shared with the community, which shared its feedback for the filming of the next episode. The team ultimately partnered with Cinema Libre Studio to edit the episodes into a feature film. Release The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray and via video on demand on October 20, 2015.

The IDEALIST specializes in non-profit positions.  Patients  The Native American Health Center serves a wide range of communities in the Bay Area. The organization offers healthcare services to anyone regardless of any tribal affiliations. There are no requirements on ethnicity or residency. The organization's patients are on average 37% Latinx, 21% Native American, 20% African American, 12% Euro American, 9% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 1% unknown. Based on an average taken in 2011, the Native American Health Center serves roughly 11,265 patients in the Bay Area per year. While healthcare services are provided to everyone regardless of their relationship to any native communities, the center does have specialized services and events specifically for native people. As stated in their mission, their goal is to \\"provide comprehensive services to improve the health and wellbeing of American Indians, Alaska Natives, and residents of the surrounding communities, with respect for cultural and linguistic differences.\\"  Staff  The Native American Health Center has roughly 225 employees ranging from HR administrators to practicing dentists. The majority of employees at the organization are Native American at roughly 36.9%. The rest of the organization's employees are 20.4% white, 16.5% Hispanic/Latinx, 18% Asian/Pacific Islander, 9.3% African American, and 1.6% Unknown/Other. Staff work to serve the community in a holistic way in ten different departments: Administration, Human Resources, Nutrition + Fitness, School Based Health Centers, WIC, Community Wellness Department, Medical, Dental, Youth Services, and Behavioral Health.  Events and groups  While the Native American Health Center is a fully functioning center for healthcare, they also have many social events to specifically serve the indigenous and native communities in cultural and community ways as opposed to medical. Events and groups are frequently held at the Sage Center located on 3124 International Blvd. in Oakland, CA, the Circle of Healing located on 160 Capp Street in San Francisco, CA, and the Native Wellness Center on 2566 Macdonald Avenue in Richmond, CA.

The market takes place the first Sunday of every month in Fruitvale. History There are many people native to the San Francisco Bay Area. The Ohlone People, the Coast Miwok, and the Pomo People are the original inhabitants of the area. The arrival of the Europeans in the 1500s disrupted their traditional way of life and resulted in a steady decline of the Native American population. The decline continued until the 1950s, when the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs‚Äô relocation program moved tens of thousands of Native Americans from reservations across the country to urban centers like San Francisco and Oakland. Although the relocation program was voluntary, many felt coerced by the promise of jobs, housing, health care, and a better life. Many of these promises were kept by the Bureau of Indian Affairs who send relocated Native Americans to training schools, assisted them with a housing subsidy and provided job search and placement. However, many of these services were substandard and inconsistent, resulting in a disenfranchised community. While some of those relocated eventually returned to reservations, many stayed and formed their own community in the Bay Area. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Bay Area Native American community responded to the challenges of urban lifestyle and the broader cultural shifts taking place in society. New Native American run organizations were formed to address the needs for self-determinations and self-sufficiency. Today, the Bay Area is home to one of the largest concentrations of Native Americans in the country with a diversity of over 240 nations represented. According to 2010 Census Data, there are 66,443 Native American individuals living in the five counties of the San Francisco Bay Area. As a direct result of the Indian Relocation Act of 1956, there were many Native Americans in the Bay area without resources or knowledge about the urban area. This need for resources and community is what lead to the creation of the Native American Health Center in 1972 with its first location in San Francisco. This first location quickly expanded to help further meet the need of Native Americans in the Bay area.

In grasses other than maize it is caused by Pyricularia grisea, which only infects perennial ryegrass, tall fescue, and St. Augustinegrass in places with warm and rainy climates such as Florida.  Symptoms  Early symptoms of gray leaf spot can be seen on leaves as small, spherical lesions with a yellow halo around them. These first lesions may be tan or brown before fungal sporulation begins. The initial disease can be hard to identify as gray leaf spot at this stage because it looks similar to eyespot and common rust. However, as the lesions mature, they elongate into rectangular, narrow, brown to gray spots that usually develop on the lower leaves and spread upward on the plant during the season. The lesions elongate and expand parallel to the leaf veins and can be 1.5 to 2 inches long. With favorable weather the lesions can rapidly merge and kill the entire leaf. Mature gray leaf spot symptoms can also be confused with symptoms of anthracnose leaf blight.  Management  Most seed companies have a gray leaf spot resistance rating for their hybrids that are available. As far as controlling Pyricularia grisea, ryegrass, tall fescue, and St. Augustinegrass are all fairly susceptible to gray leaf spot and neither of them are considered resistant. Planting other types of grasses such as Kentucky bluegrass, bentgrass, or annual bluegrass would be a lot more beneficial as they are not affected by gray leaf spot.http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pp126https://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/bp/bp-107-w.pdf Managing crop residue is another important thing to keep in mind when trying to control gray leaf spot. Continuous corn and a no-till or reduced tillage system are at a very high risk for disease development because of the amount of residue being left on the soil surface. Rotating crops away from corn followed by tillage is recommended to prevent disease in the subsequent crop. In fields with a history of gray leaf spot with a no-till system, a two-year rotation may be needed. Using fungicides effectively can also reduce the amount of diseased crops and help stop the spread of gray leaf spot. Some research has shown that strobilurin and strobilurin/triazole fungicides are the most effective at preventing yield loss from the disease. Fungicides should be applied when lesions are first seen on basal leaves. A secondary application may be needed 30 days after the first application depending on the weather conditions.

His son Lakhpatji confined him in 1741 and ruled as a regent until death of Deshalji in 1752. Life Rao Godji I died in 1718 and his son Deshalji succeeded him without opposition. At this time the revenues of the Raos of Kutch were very small. Before the reign of Godji they were chiefly derived from the trifling trade of their seaport Anjar; from the Kera sub-division; from some villages in Miyani; and from Rapar in Vagad region. The lands of Mundra and Kanthi and Anjar Chovisi, added during Godji's reign, brought an important increase of revenue. Still the Raos' income was scanty, and their way of living very frugal and simple. Among his brotherhood the Rao claimed no greater supremacy than what was due to his title and larger resources. Sheltered by the friendly feeling of his relations and servants, he lived safe and unguarded, without crippling his resources by the pay of mercenaries. The leading Jadejas had all lately received their possessions, and as, up to this time, the ties of relationship had scarcely been broken, habit and duty inclined them to obey their common chief. Friendly intercourse and mutual support formed a bond of union between the Rao and his nominal feudatories, in striking contrast to the rivalry and discord of later years. At this time the Halani Jadejas (descendants of Haloji) had not long settled in Abdasa; the Godanis or sons of Rao Godji I, were in their new lands in the Kanthi; the Sahebs, including the long established chiefs of Roha, Moti ViraniandMothala, were continued in their estates; and Tera was allotted to one of the sons of Rao Rayadhan II. These estates, including the best lands and the richest towns in the province, were well peopled, peasants as well as traders being always ready to leave their houses and settle in estates lately granted to specially favoured children of the Rao. Most of the country not held by the Jadejas was in the hands of Vaghela and other Rajput chiefs, who through all changes had kept to their estates, and of smaller proprietors, Miyanas and others, who had earned grants of free or service land. All Jadeja chiefs and Girasia proprietors acknowledged the Rao as their head, and when wanted were ready to fight for him. As a province of the Mughal Empire, Kutch had, for more than a century and a quarter (1583-1718), been free from attack; and for a hundred years, under the arrangement sanctioned by the Emperor Jahangir, pilgrims had been sent to Mecca free of charge, and Kutch spared the payment of tribute. Soon after Deshalji's accession in 1718, the Mughal governor, pressed for funds in the decay of his Gujarat revenue, sent a force into Kutch. This army, under the command of a Pathan, Mozim Beg, advanced to Padar within ten miles of Bhuj. Hearing of their approach, the Rao, calling his Bhayat together, dispatched a force to meet the invaders. At the same time he sent agents, representing the injustice of the demand, and reminding the Mughal leader of the terms under which the Kutch tribute had been remitted. These measures were successful, and the Mughal leader, seeing that the Rao was ready to support remonstrance by force, withdrew. Foreseeing a repetition of the demand, the Rao set to work to build a fort at Bhuj, and in other ways spared neither expense nor trouble in his efforts to meet a future attack. In 1721, before three years were over, Nawab Kesar Khan came into Kutch, again demanding tribute. Hearing much of the strength of the new fort at Bhuj he avoided it and led his army to, and plundered, Naliya, an open town of considerable wealth in Abdasa. But finding that the people of the country round had taken their goods with them and fled to Mandvi and Bhuj he withdrew. The failure of these two attempts, followed by seven years of peace, relieved the Rao into unpreparedness. Then the governor, Sarbuland Khan (1723‚Äì1730), at the head of an army of 50,000 men, and bringing with him Kanyoji, the Morbi chief, as a claimant to Kutch, advanced towards Bhuj. The Rao was ill prepared to meet him, and though the Jadejas loyally gathered at Bhuj, they and their followers were little able to oppose so strong an enemy. To add to the Rao's difficulties his minister failed him, declaring that he knew of no means for raising money or men. Among the women of his palace, Deshalji had one favourite wife, whom his bounty had greatly enriched. Telling her his difficulty she freely offered her whole wealth, and her manager, Seth Devkaran, a Lohana by caste, bowing before the Rao, engaged, if service were given him, to guide the state safely through its present dangers. The Seth was made minister, and, by his power over his rich caste-fellows, gathered such large sums that, by offers of pay and opium, the whole fighting population of the country was quickly drawn to Bhuj. Encamping on the borders of the lake outside the city, they were divided into two armies. One was sent to strengthen the garrison of the Bhujia fort, and the other kept to guard the town whose walls were yet unfinished. The day after the defence was arranged, the Mughal army appeared before the city. An attack was made on the Bhujia fort, and two of its bastions were taken. Next day the garrison, in a successful sally, won back the two bastions, and drove out the Mughals with the loss of their leader the governor's nephew. Cheered by this success, the Rao, choosing three thousand of the best Jadeja horse, and binding round their brows the orange turban of self-sacrifice, dashed into the enemy's camp, and caused such loss and confusion that the invaders retired. At Lakhona, where they halted, their supplies were cut off, and their camp attacked and plundered by troops of Miyana horse. Seeing how matters went, their guide Kanyoji left the Mughals, and gaining his pardon joined the Rao. The governor soon after escaped to Gujarat, and great numbers of his men following him in disorder were pursued and slain by the Kutch horse. Freed from the risk of foreign invasion the Rao rewarded Devkaran Seth by giving into his hands the whole management of the country. He helped to increase the revenue of state and used all his own resources to improve the state. Commerce was encouraged and the land revenue fostered by a useful system of accounts, and by setting agents of the state in every town, and through them supplying the husbandmen with funds. By these means the Rao's yearly revenue was raised to ¬£50,000 (18 lakhs of Kutch koris), and the minister's to more than ¬£25,000 (10 lakhs of koris). Besides enriching the province, Devkarn Seth made it secure against foreign attack, strengthening the Bhujia fort, finishing the walls of the capital, and fortifying the towns of Anjar, Mundra and Rapar. These places were garrisoned by troops, and a regular force engaged to protect the country. Not content with securing the safety of the province, he spread the Rao's name and power by carrying an army into Parkar, and, leaving a post there, overawed the Sodhas and put a stop to their raids. In west Kathiawar, the Okhamandal pirates of Dwarka, who had been harassing the trade of Mandvi, were punished and kept in order by building in their district the fort of Kutchigadh ; and in the east Balamba and other Halar villages were recovered from Kanyoji of the Morbi State. In Sindh, called in by the Raimas, Muslims of the Jadeja stock, Devkarn protected them, and, to secure the lands he had won, built a fort at Rahim-ki-bazar. All this was done without rousing the ill will of the chiefs and proprietors, who, on the slightest summons were ready to gather round the Rao's standard. Lakhpatji, an only son of Deshalji I, was freehanded and spent the money freely. He was denied the share of power and was advised to reduce his expenses. Lakhpatji left Bhuj, and threatening to take service with the king of Udaipur, forced his father to yield to some of his demands. Though to appearance satisfied, Lakhpatji secretly continued to scheme to bring the government into his hand. His first step was to get rid of the minister Devkarn, whom he hated as the cause of his exclusion from a share of power, and whose close intimacy with his mother he is said to have had strong reason for believing to have been criminal. Accordingly, in 1738, he raised a disturbance in front of the minister's house, who, coming out to restore order, was attacked and slain by a hired assassin. At first indignant at the loss of his favourite minister, the Rao was by degrees won by Lakhpatji's submission to grant him forgiveness, and in token of their friendship agreed to be present at an entertainment in Lakhpatji's house. The Rao brought with him most of his chief officers, and to show respect to his father, Lakhpatji had all his attendants in waiting. There was much delay in serving the feast, and the young chief, after many impatient messages, himself left the room to hurry on the banquet. As he left every opening from the room was closed, and the Rao and his officers were quietly secured. Placing his father in confinement, Lakhpatji began to rule in 1941, receiving the submission of the commandants of all the forts in the province except Mandvi. When Lakhpatji was settled in power, he allowed his father a suitable establishment and greater freedom. And his officers and personal friends were released and sent to distant parts of the country. In 1752, Rao Deshalji I died at the age of seventy. His son Lakhpatji succeeded him.

As a senior, he posted 641 rushing yards and 7 touchdowns. Against North Carolina State University, he registered 14 carries for 129 yards and one touchdown. He finished his college career with 2,320 rushing yards and 23 touchdowns on 483 carries. He also practiced track and field, running the first leg of the 1980 ACC champion 4 √ó 100 metres relay team. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= McSwain was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fifth round (135th overall) of the 1983 NFL Draft. He was also selected by the Washington Federals in the 1983 USFL Territorial Draft. In his first career pre-season appearance, he had a game to remember against the Miami Dolphins, scoring 2 touchdowns in less than 2 minutes (including a 67-yard touchdown screen pass reception). After the first regular season game, he was placed on the injured reserve list with a torn tendon in his right ring finger and was replaced with Gary Allen. The next year, he posted 20 kickoff returns for 403 yards. He was waived before the start of the 1985 season. =Los Angeles Raiders= In 1986, he signed with the Los Angeles Raiders as a free agent and was cut on July 28. =New England Patriots= After the players went on a strike on the third week of the 1987 season, those games were canceled (reducing the 16-game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games would be played with replacement players. McSwain was signed to be a part of the New England Patriots replacement team. He was a backup player and registered 23 rushing yards, before being released at the end of the strike. Personal life McSwain works as an athletic director and track coach at Chase High School in North Carolina. He was born into a family of 13 children. His brother Rod McSwain also played in the NFL for the New England Patriots.

It has also been shown to be able to gauge audio quality for non-speech sounds and for listeners without a hearing loss.  Background  While the perception of audio quality can be gauged through perceptual measurements, the testing is time-consuming to undertake. Consequently, a number of metrics have been developed to allow audio quality to be evaluated without the need for human listening. Standardized examples from telephony include PESQ, POLQA, PEVQ and PEAQ. HASQI was originally developed by Kates and Arehart to evaluate how the distortions introduced by hearing aids degrade quality. They also produced a new version in 2014. Kressner et al. tested a speech corpus different from the dataset used to develop HASQI and showed that the index generalizes well for listeners without a hearing loss with a performance comparable to PESQ. Kendrick et al. showed that HASQI can grade the audio quality of music and geophonic, biophonic, and anthrophonic quotidian sounds, although their study used a more limited set of degradations.  Method  HASQI and its 2014 revision are double-ended methods requiring both a clean reference and the degraded signal to allow evaluation. The index attempts to capture the effects of noise, nonlinear distortion, linear filtering and spectral changes, by computing the difference or correlation between key audio features. This is done by examining short- time signal envelopes to quantify the degradation caused by noise and nonlinear filtering, and long-time signal envelopes to quantify the effects of linear filtering. Version 2 of HASQI includes a model to capture some aspects of the peripheral auditory system for both normal and hearing impaired listeners. Kendrick et al. developed a blind (single-ended) method, bHASQI, using machine learning. This enables the audio quality to be evaluated from just the degraded signal without needing the clean reference.

Geography  It is located near a little hill close to the Boedo river. It is situated north of the province of Palencia and is halfway between the subregions of La Ojeda and La Valdavia, in the region of Boedo-Ojeda. His road situation regarding other localities is 4.1 km east from B√°scones de Ojeda, 8.4 km north from Revilla de Collazos, 8.3 km west from Dehesa de Romanos, 9.4 km west from La Vid de Ojeda and 11 km north from Collazos de Boedo, capital and center of the municipality.

Despite this, the Oteros de Boedo population increases during the months of July, August and half of September. In the last fifty years the population figures of the town have suffered a huge decline due to the depopulation which took and still takes place in the Spanish countryside, being Castile and Leon the Spanish region where this fact caused more havoc. The population of the Province of Palencia was drastically reduced due to an exodus by the generations between the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. The few employment opportunities, lack of services and low professional valuation granted to workers led thousands of palentinos to migrate to other parts of the Spanish territory where they would have a greater chance of success, leading the province to lose in only thirty years 20% of its workforce population. The gradual loss of population has continued to be a common and disturbing scene until now. Oteros de Boedo is not left out of it as it is in a critical situation and on the way to absolute abandonment if nothing is done to give an economic boost to the area.  Economy  Agriculture and livestock are the two main economic activities in which people of working age are based. These activities represent more than 90% of the occupation of these people together with freight with own specialized vehicles. Some other occupations, although few, also performed in the village.  History  During the Middle Ages it belonged to the largest Merindad of Monz√≥n, Meryndat de Mon√ßon. When the Antiguo R√©gimen fell the village became a constitutional municipality that in the census of 1842 counted on 20 homes and 104 neighbors, later integrated into the municipal council of Collazos de Boedo.  Tourism  The geographical location of Oteros de Boedo allows the called rural tourism. Despite the small size of the village we can find in it a rural house for travelers who want to leave the busy city life for a few days of relaxation surrounded by a totally relaxed atmosphere where you can enjoy the beautiful landscapes of the fields. The town is in a prime location as it is right between various attractions of the province. To the north, about 60 kilometers, we find the Natural Park Monta√±a Palentina. Then immediately close to the Cantabrian border, the first peaks indicate the start of the called Picos de Europa National Park. In these same peaks, it is the ski resort of Alto Campoo. Also in the north, about 25 km from Oteros de Boedo, near the town of Mave we can find the splendid natural area of Las Tuerces. Oteros de Boedo is also in the region known as the North of Palencia (Norte de Palencia), which includes the administrative regions of Monta√±a Palentina and the northern territories of P√°ramos-Valles. The North of Palencia is also known by many as the Cradle of Romanesque. In the counties surrounding Oteros de Boedo we can enjoy the highest concentration of Romanesque buildings in Spain, which have been recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. To this we must add the Romanesque buildings that can be found in the center of the province near the Camino de Santiago and the great presence of medieval castles through the lowlands of the province, closer to Palencia city.  Local festivities  The festivities of Oteros de Boedo, on the occasion of the days of Our Lady and Saint Roch, are on 14th, 15th and 16 August of each year. The program of the celebrations usually includes new innovations every year, but there are several activities that are always repeated as the great pancetada and chorizada occurring in the Fountain Square barbecues, the local championships of palentino bowling and nita, a rural nightclub session until the morning in the town square, the huge variety of games for all ages or the final chocolate party among other activities. During these days, along with pre and post, it is when there is the best environment in the village and it encourages the citizens to go out and enjoy the companionship.

It was preceded by the 1913 election and followed by the 1922 election. Overview of the result The elections were less politicised than in the pre-war era, with more candidates being elected without any declared political affiliations. The non-political nature of the contests was emphasized by the traditionally Conservative Carmarthen Journal, which had long opposed the politicized nature of local authority elections. Other publications, however, included political affiliations in their coverage of the results. Boundary changes There were no boundary changes. Unopposed returns 22 of the 53 divisions were uncontested, with the majority of the unopposed returns being in the rural parts of the county. Contested elections A greater proportion of the sitting members were challenged than had been the case in most pre-war contests and a number of prominent members were defeated including Mervyn Peel, former Conservative candidate for East Carmarthenshire, at Llangadog. In Carmarthen, the Rev. Andrew Fuller Mills was defeated by an ex-serviceman. In Llanelli, D.C. Parry, a Liberal member of the Council since its formation, was defeated by Gwendoline Trubshaw, who received the support of the Discharged and Demobilised Soldiers' and Sailors' Association.

Biography  = Origins = House of Mihaloviƒá (also Mihalovich, Mihalovics, Mihalovits, Mihajloviƒá) was a noble family from Orahovica in Slavonia that originated in Macedonia. In 1716, Emperor Charles VI granted them nobility status because they served as Habsburg officers and had fought against Ottomans during the Hundred Years' Croatian‚ÄìOttoman War. By 1763 they were Eastern Orthodox Christians and were known under the name Mihajloviƒá. Their economic and social rise began after their conversion to Catholicism. Several notable men came from House of Mihailoviƒá, including composer √ñd√∂n (1842-1929), K√°roly Dragutin (1830-1918), Hugo (1874-1956), Antun (1868-1949), the last ban of Croatia in Austria-Hungary. = Early life and education = Josip Mihaloviƒá was born in a small village of Torda in Hungary (now Vojvodina, Serbia) where he attended lower elementary school. He attended elementary school in Zrenjanin, high school in Szeged and additional schools in Timi»ôoara where he also completed philosophy and theology studies and gained a doctorate in theology. From 1834 he worked in the episcopal office. Mihaloviƒá was ordained a priest on 12 August 1836 by Bishop Josip Lonoviƒá. In 1837, he became chaplain of the town parish in Timi»ôoara and in 1837 notary of the Holy See. In 1841, he was appointed bishop's secretary, and in 1846 Principal of the Office of Bishops. In February 1848, Mihaloviƒá became a canon, and in 1849 bishop's deputy. = Revolutions of 1848 = During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, Mihaloviƒá sided with Hungarian rebels. After the revolution was suppressed, he was brought before the Military Court in Timi»ôoara. On 17 November 1848, he was deprived of all services, honorable titles and estates, and sentenced to four years in prison, out of which he served two in the fortress in the town of Leopold near Nitra in present-day Slovakia. In 1852 he received a pardon and was allowed to serve the next four years as a chaplain in his homeland under constant police surveillance. In October 1855, Mihaloviƒá became pastor of Dude»ôtii Vechi, in 1859 dean and superintendent of the local school, in May 1861 canon, in June 1861 Timi»ôoara factory pastor, and eventually abbot at Sveti Martin na Muri.  Bishop and cardinal  In 1868, Mihaloviƒá received a nomination for the title of Titular Bishop of Duvno. On 4 May 1870, he was appointed Bishop of Zagreb, and on 17 July he received episcopal ordination in Vienna. The main initiator was the Archbishop Mariano Falcinelli Antoniacci, Titular Bishop of Athens. Mihaloviƒá was enthroned in Zagreb on 6 August 1870. Mihaloviƒá was appointed archbishop at the time when the Croatian‚ÄìHungarian Settlement, a pact signed in 1868, that governed Croatia's political status in the Hungarian-ruled part of Austria-Hungary, was fiercely contested by the Croatian opposition parties, and so, Mihaloviƒá was, as a supporter of the rulling Unionist Party, harshly criticised by the Croatian opposition. Ignjat Brliƒá was one of the fiercest critics of his appointment, describing it as a breach of the Settlement because the title of the archbishop was given to a foreigner. On 22 June 1877 Pope Pius IX appointed him to the position of the cardinal-priest at San Pancrazio fuori le mura. He received the cardinal's hat in Rome in St Peter's Basilica on 25 June 1877. Mihaloviƒá participated in the 1878 conclave in which Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi Pecci was elected Pope. Emperor Franz Joseph wanted Mihaloviƒá to become Archbishop of Zagreb, but Mihaloviƒá at first hesitated because of the complex political situation in Croatia at the time, so he decided to resign and seek a transfer to one of the Hungarian dioceses. However, Emperor and church leaders managed to make him change his mind and he eventually stayed. Before the 1881 Croatian parliamentary election, Mihaloviƒá opposed the election of the clergy to the Parliament of Croatia, this was especially directed against the clergy involved with the opposition. Also, Mihaloviƒá, at the request of a Hungarian episcopate to secede Meƒëimurje to them, allowed preaching in the Hungarian language in ƒåakovec. Nevertheless, Mihaloviƒá stood for the Croatian interests as well, when he supported the annexation of the Military Frontier (1881) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878) by Croatia. Bishops Mihaloviƒá, Haulik and Strossmayer have been very active in promoting church, social, cultural and political life. Mihaloviƒá was mostly oriented to church life, especially to the education of young seminarians. In 1878, he initiated the establishment of a male seminary and gymnasium in Zagreb. In addition, he gave financial support for four canons for the students in the seminary. Mihaloviƒá appointed Juraj Posiloviƒá to the position of editor of the Zagreb Catholic paper (ZKL; 1872‚Äì1875). In 1874, Posiloviƒá became a regular lecturer at the Theological Faculty of the University of Franz Joseph I. He remained lecturer until his appointment as Bishop of Senj- Modru≈°. During this period, ZKL published several professional discussions on the occasion of the First Vatican Council including the famous constitution Eternal Shepherd (Vjeƒçni pastir, i. e. Pastor Aeternus), which contains the definition of papal infallibility. Liberals accused Jesuits of being the constitution's real authors, which resulted in many priests, bishops and ZKL having to protect them. ZKL also reported that bishop Strossmayer (active member of the liberal People's Party) published parliamentary regulations in his journal, thus accepting them. = 1880 reconstruction of the Cathedral = One of Mihaloviƒá's greatest accomplishments was the restoration of the Zagreb Cathedral. In 1874, bishop Strossmayer, who had large estates throughout Slavonia, started collecting funds for the Cathedral reconstruction. One of the promoters of reconstitution was also Josip Stadler. Reconstruction was interrupted on 9 November 1880 by a 6.3 magnitude earthquake that struck Zagreb. Although only one person was killed in the earthquake, it destroyed or damaged many buildings, including the cathedral. From a total of 32 altars, only 3 were kept after renovation. After the earthquake, the reconstruction of the cathedral was conducted between 1880 and 1902 in the neo-Gothic style by the architect Hermann Boll√© with funds provided by Izidor Kr≈°njavi.  Death  Mihailoviƒá died on 19 February 1891 in Zagreb at the age of 77. He was buried in the cathedral. Liberal magazine Obzor, which he often defied during his lifetime, paid him tribute by publishing an article which stated in part: \\"[Josip Mihaloviƒá] failed to justify fears of the [Croatian] people, ...For him, the realm of gentleness and justice were not empty words. In 1886, the 50th anniversary of Mihaloviƒá's first Mass was celebrated throughout the Archdiocese of Zagreb. It became clear that \\"he managed to get full sympathy of the incredulous Croatian people with his meekness and wisdom.\\"B. Bangha DJ.

The RailTopoModel has been developed under patronage of the International Union of Railways (UIC) and will be released as International Railway Standard (IRS) 30100. Motivation In the field of railway networks, many non-standard descriptions are needed for addressing specific needs: RINF to describe infrastructure; ETCS for train control and protection; INSPIRE for spatial information. Network operators or suppliers took particular initiatives to harmonize their network representations for gathering, providing, or using network-related data. The purpose of RailTopoModel is to define a general, standard model. History The development of the RailTopoModel is a result of the ERIM project (abbreviation for European Rail Infrastructure Modelling) within UIC that aims at standardized data representation and exchange concerning railway networks. In 2013, starting from the assessment of a small group of IMs about limitation of current exchange formats for ETCS, RINF, Inspire, and European projects based on network topology, the UIC ERIM feasibility study was launched. The objective of this working group was to qualify the business needs, analyze the existing solutions and experiences, and propose a project plan to build a universal ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù to improve the railway data exchange, and support the design of an infrastructure data exchange format based on topology. Based on this study a topology model, the ‚ÄòUIC RailTopoModel‚Äô, was developed. In April 2015 RTM V1.0 was released. ‚ÄòUIC RailTopoModel‚Äô shall become a UIC recommendation called International Railway Standard (IRS 30100) in spring 2016. railML.org, a European open source initiative providing a standard for data exchange in railway networks since 2001, will offer the first use case for RailTopoModel through a new version of its infrastructure schema, railML3. Structure Comparison of intrinsic localization and mileage A piece of railway infrastructure depicted in different aggregation levels RailTopoModel is based on connexity graph theory and it is defined in terms of UML. Its emphasis lies on: *Core elements ‚Äî identification of all network components; *Referencing ‚Äî defining standards for addressing locations e.g. via geographical coordinates. The backbone of referencing in RailTopoModel is a linear referencing system; *Topology ‚Äî expressing the relations between the elements; *Business ‚Äî allowing to project objects and events onto the topology. These can be spots (e.g. a signal), linear entities ( e.g. a tunnel) or areas (e.g. a train station); *Aggregation ‚Äî allowing for the standardized and reversible aggregation e.g. to visualize the network in a broader scale. There are four predefined aggregation levels: **nano: very large scale, depicting e.g. the interior of a switch **micro: large scale, depicting e.g. switches and buffer stops connected by tracks **meso: intermediate scale, depicting e.g. operation points and the number of tracks connecting them **macro: small scale, depicting main operation points and the corridors between them :The model allows defining as many levels as is deemed useful, while ensuring consistency of data between levels. Ideally, standardisation should grant for references and switches between aggregation levels being bijective and different applications being able to exchange data. Applications Current applications are: *railML: the topology core of railML's scheme version 3 will be defined on the basis of RailTopoModel. *Ariane model as foundation of all SNCF R√©seau IT projects: the definition of Ariane model at SNCF R√©seau employs the same concept: it combines a connexity graph (for the topology of the network) with an object approach to define a systemic model of the railway system. The principal benefit of this approach is to distinguish between the business object of the system and the processes that manage them. Moreover, it allows for an evolutive and understanding model. This type of modeling is needed to build a virtual railway system to simulate all processes.

It was built in 1966 as the first production SD45 by Electro-Motive Division. History GN 400 was the first of eight SD45s (numbered 400-407) delivered to the Great Northern in May and June 1966. Great Northern was the first railroad company to purchase this model of locomotive. GN 400 was the fourth SD45 built by EMD after the first three demonstrators. Great Northern christened it with its nickname, \\"Hustle Muscle.\\" All eight SD45s wore Great Northern's simplified orange and green paint scheme, but only 400 wore a nickname. In total, Great Northern owned 27 SD45s built from 1966 through 1968. In 1970, the GN became part of the Burlington Northern (BN). The locomotive was renumbered to 6430, but through 1972 it still wore its GN paint, with the GN logos removed. In 1973, the locomotive underwent a massive \\"class-one overhaul\\", and was painted into BN's cascade green scheme. At the request of railfans, BN kept its nickname painted on both sides of its long hood. The BN retired 6430 in 1986, and donated the locomotive to the Great Northern Railway Historical Society. In 1989, the locomotive was repainted back into its original GN appearance and renumbered back to 400 in Grand Forks, North Dakota. The locomotive was then kept in Duluth, Minnesota on display and in operation until the early 2000s when it was moved to the former Great Northern Jackson Street Roundhouse in Saint Paul, Minnesota, which houses the Minnesota Transportation Museum. In 2006, the 400 was repainted a second time in Horicon, Wisconsin. The second repaint was completed using the original EMD and GN diagrams of the locomotive. The locomotive is housed at the Minnesota Transportation Museum's Jackson Street Roundhouse, where the 400 was serviced while operating for the Great Northern Railway. Present-day operations Prior to moving to Duluth, it was displayed in LaGrange, IL in September 1989 for EMD's 50th Anniversary of the FT diesel, along with other EMD power. The locomotive then operated on the North Shore Scenic Railroad, sometimes being paired with Soo Line 1003 or Duluth & Northern Minnesota 14. After moving from Duluth to St. Paul, the locomotive was called into duty for special excursions, including operating with Milwaukee Road 261 and pulling Great Northern Railway Historical Society and National Railway Historical Society charters. In 2001, it operated on a circle tour with the 261 from the Twin Cities to Superior, then west through Brainerd then south through Staples and east back to the Twin Cities through St. Cloud. It was featured in the 2002 \\"Railroad Days\\" in Galesburg, IL. It pulled a National Railway Historical Society excursion from the Twin Cities to Duluth in 2009 and running some excursions and photo trips on the North Shore Scenic Railroad. Otherwise, 400 was often displayed inside MTM's roundhouse, occasionally pulling their Saturday caboose rides. It was ferried in 2006 to the Wisconsin Southern for a repaint and returned to the Minnesota Transportation Museum in 2007. In 2014 and 2015, the locomotive was displayed for special events at St. Paul Union Depot. GN 400 Hustle Muscle on the Minnesota Transportation Museum's Osceola and St. Croix Valley Railway in 2016. In 2015 the Minnesota Transportation Museum and the Great Northern Railway Historical Society signed a two-year operating lease to have the 400 operate on MTM's Osceola and St. Croix Valley Railway in Osceola, WI, in place of MTM's Soo Line (Ex-Rock Island) GP7 which is undergoing maintenance. After being displayed in St. Paul through May, the locomotive was ferried to Osceola for its first year of regular excursions. GN 400 pulled many trains during the 2015 season including a special for the 2015 Great Northern Convention and for photo charters. It was often set aside just for special runs. At the end of the 2015 season, BNSF railway transported GN 400 to their diesel shop in Northtown yard for a \\"class one inspection\\". After some testing on revenue local trains, GN 400 was given a \\"clean bill of health\\" and was returned to the Jackson Street Roundhouse. In 2016 the 400 was a co-star in a railfan photographer special on May 2 with its former Duluth 'bunkmate' Soo Line 2500. It operated every weekend of May and June 2016 and October 2016. It returned to display at the Jackson Street Roundhouse and went to BNSF for maintenance in March 2017. In 2019, following its third restoration, the GNRHS and Lake Superior Railroad Museum agreed to have the locomotive displayed and operated in Duluth, MN while the Minnesota Transportation Museum restored Soo Line GP7 559 and continued work on Great Northern SD7 558 and Great Northern F7A 454. GN 400 arrived Duluth June 7, 2019. In July, it was displayed in Dilworth, MN during the 2019 Great Northern Convention in Fargo, ND, before returning to Duluth for operation. =Engine Failure & Replacement= In May 2017, while undergoing routine maintenance in preparation for the 2017 Osceola excursion season, the 400 suffered a crankshaft failure in its original 20-645E engine requiring a replacement engine to be installed. BNSF Railway overhauled a 20-645E engine from a retired ex-ATSF SD45-2 and donated and installed the new engine in January 2019 at no cost to the museum or historical society. The 400's engine replacement was completed in April 2019 and the locomotive operated under its own power for the first time with its new engine.

Her daughter, Andrea, was born in 1977, and her son, John, arrived in 1978. Divorced in the early 1980s, she married Michael Huston in 1985. With his encouragement, she enrolled at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in her mid-thirties, where she earned a bachelor's degree in English and a master's degree in British and American Literature, going on to teach in the Cal Poly English Department for the next twelve years. In 1994 she became a Catholic, and in 1999, a Camaldolese Benedictine oblate (a vowed lay member of the contemplative monastic community of New Camaldoli Hermitage in Big Sur). Her first novel, Daughters of Song, was published in 1995. In 1999 she helped design and implement the California State University Consortium Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing, in which she taught for the next three years. When the program ended in 2002, she took an early retirement from Cal Poly to become a full-time writer, speaker and retreat leader. She currently serves as a creative nonfiction mentor for the Seattle Pacific University MFA program. She and her husband live on four acres on the Central Coast of California, where they keep chickens and bees; maintain fruit trees, a raised bed vegetable garden, and an olive orchard; and spend a lot of time with their four young grandchildren.  Work  Before her conversion to Catholicism and subsequent vows as a contemplative oblate, Huston wrote literary fiction for fifteen years, often with artist protagonists or themes involving art. Her first novel, Daughters of Song‚Äîa book that James Bready of the Baltimore Sun said was the \\"best book yet\\" about life at the famed Peabody Conservatory‚Äîis a coming-of-age story about a young piano prodigy. Huston‚Äôs short story \\"Pilgrimage\\" involves a lonely woman reconciling herself to the cold relationship she always had with her famous and now-dead pianist father. \\"The Cattle Raid of Cooley\\" features a literature professor who struggles with, and at times acts upon, sexual fantasies about his students. Post-conversion, she began using the techniques of literary fiction to write about religious faith. In her first project, Signatures of Grace: Catholic Writers on the Sacraments, she and co-editor Tom Grady asked seven prominent literary writers, including novelist Ron Hansen, poet Paul Mariani, novelist Mary Gordon, and essayist Patricia Hampl, to each contribute a long personal essay about one of the Catholic sacraments. In its starred review of the collection, Publishers Weekly said, \\"For Catholics, this volume is a treasure. For those outside the Church, the essays reveal, as no catechism ever could, why Catholics are drawn to these ‚Äòsigns signifying grace.‚Äô\\" Convinced there was an audience for literary writers of faith, Huston went on to write six books of spiritual creative nonfiction, including The Holy Way: Practices for a Simple Life, a narrative account of the spiritual practices she learned from her association with the monks of New Camaldoli. A Catholic Book Club main selection, The Holy Way prompted Doris Donnelly, reviewer for America, to say, \\"Paula Huston has much in common with Kathleen Norris and Henri Nouwen, two major stars in the constellation of contemporary writers on the spiritual journey‚Ä¶ she appears to have the integrity, insight, and originality necessary to make her own important contribution as a credible witness to what happens when God is chosen as the center of one‚Äôs life\\". In 2013, she published her second novel, A Land Without Sin, about a hardened young battlefield photojournalist seeking her missing priest brother in the jungles of Central America. Novelist Valerie Sayers, writing for Commonweal, said of the book, \\"A Land Without Sin succeeds in considering the thorniest problems religious believers face--atrocity, despair, the nature of evil--without moralizing or over-simplifying. It‚Äôs deeply engaging and impressive in its range, and for the most part it manages to keep its many narrative balls spinning gracefully. Perhaps most crucial to its success is a full and intelligent probing of an atheist‚Äôs perspective-- narrated by a complex, sharp, and dynamic female voice whose rue and wit inject healthy doses of irony and skepticism as needed\\". In Huston‚Äôs One Ordinary Sunday: A Meditation on the Mystery of the Mass, she returns to narrative spiritual nonfiction to explain the historical roots and theological meaning of each element of the Catholic Mass. Poet and biographer Paul Mariani writes of the book that Huston has managed to \\"capture in a single summer Sunday Mass what millions of Catholics and those interested in Catholicism have experienced many times over . . . Her worries are our worries, her doubts our doubts, her convictions our convictions, beautifully rendered and surprised by joy. . . To say I loved this book would be an understatement.\\"  Novels  * A Land Without Sin (Slant, 2013). * Daughters of Song (Random House, 1995).

These were requested in response to the Soviet T-34 and KV-1 tanks, with far heavier armour and armament than the mobile armoured vehicles fielded by the Wehrmacht at the time. Many German companies submitted projects, including Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-N√ºrnberg (MAN), Daimler-Benz (DB), Henschel, and Porsche. The winning entry tanks would go on to become the famous Tiger I and Panther tanks, and capable opponents to the T-34 if ultimately too late and at too small of a scale to affect the course of the war. Tiger tank entries The origins of the first VK 30 began with the need for a breakthrough tank, or Durchbruchswagen in 1937, resulting in a few successive iterations. Porsche submitted heavily armoured tank designs, but they were unconventional and also unsuccessful. This was dropped in 1938, around the same time as the start of the VK 20 project, in favour of the first VK 30 designs. These were submitted by Henschel and Porsche. However, it slowly grew in weight and Henschel redubbed it the VK 36. On May 26 1941, Hitler ordered the production of prototypes for a new heavy tank, resulting in the VK 45 project, and later the VK 45.01(H) Tiger I. The VK 45.01(P) or Porsche-Tiger, was later turned into the Ferdinand tank destroyer and used at the Battle of Kursk. Panther tank entries On 13 May 1942, the entries for the medium tank were submitted to the Panzer branch of the Waffenamt Pr√ºfwesen (Wa Pr√ºf 6). These included the MAN and DB models. DB presented an entry very similar to the T-34, but upgraded to German standards. It incorporated a similar full front plate sloped armour design akin to their entry for the VK 20 series of tanks. The DB entry held an early lead and was much simpler. However, the MAN entry finally won due to complications in turret production for the DB design that would have resulted in delayed production.

It helped to defend the coastal towns of Cornwall and sent engineer units to work on the Western Front. Converted to an air defence role before World War I, it served as an searchlight unit during the Battle of Britain, the Blitz, then, as a light anti-aircraft gun unit, it served in the most heavily attacked part of the South Coast of England throughout 1942‚Äì44, including the V-1 flying bomb campaign (Operation Diver). Precursor unit In 1886, the War Office (WO) began organising units of 'submarine miners' in the Volunteer Force to man the fixed minefields being installed to defend British seaports. One such unit was the Falmouth Division Submarine Miners, based at Falmouth in Cornwall. However, the proposed unit was soon abandoned: no officers were ever commissioned into it, and its title disappeared from the Army List in March 1888.Westlake, p. 15. Territorial Force After the Territorial Force (TF) was created by the Haldane Reforms in 1908, a new TF unit of the Royal Engineers was raised to maintain the defences of the Cornish seaports. Designated the Cornwall Fortress Royal Engineers, it had the following organisation by the outbreak of World War I:Monthly Army List, August 1914.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 12. * HQ at Falmouth * No 1 (Electric Lights) Company at Falmouth * No 2 (Works) Company at Fowey Town HallFowey at The Drill Hall Project. * No 3 (Works) Company at Bow Hill, PenrynPenryn at The Drill Hall Project.

No 2 (Works) Company at Fowey maintained a band.Internet Bandsman's site. World War I On the outbreak of war in August 1914, the fortress engineers moved to their war stations in the coastal defences, the Cornwall Fortress Engineers coming under the command of South Western Coast Defences HQ at Devonport, Plymouth.Conrad. Shortly afterwards, the men of the TF were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service and WO instructions were issued to form those men who had only signed up for Home Service into reserve or 2nd Line units. The titles of these 2nd Line units were the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. They absorbed most of the recruits that flooded in, and in many cases themselves went on active service later.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. This process was carried out with the Cornwall Fortress Engineers, resulting in six companies. Once it was clear that the threat to Britain's coastal defences was small, six of the fortress engineer units organised their 1st Line as 'Army Troops' companies for service on the Lines of Communication of the British Expeditionary Force. The 1/3rd Cornwall Army Troops Company embarked for France on 19 January 1915 and after arriving at Camiers was assigned to Second Army.'Embarkation Dates', The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 162/7.Morling, p. 38.

All TF units were demobilised after the Armistice.Watson & Ri8naldi, pp. 20‚Äì21. Interwar The unit was reformed in the renamed Territorial Army (TA) in 1920, consisting of a single company based at the RE Barracks in Falmouth. It formed part of the Coast Defence troops in 43rd (Wessex) Divisional Area. Later, it was amalgamated with the Devonshire Fortress Engineers to form the Devonshire and Cornwall (Fortress) Engineers (D&C; (F) RE).Army List, January 1923.Titles and designations, 1927.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 104.Monthly Army List May 1939. 90 cm Projector Anti-Aircraft, displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth. During World War I, the electric light companies of the fortress engineers, which operated searchlights primarily to assist the coastal defence guns, had increasingly used the lights for anti-aircraft (AA) defence.Short et al. During the 1930s, the threat of aerial bombing was taken seriously, and large numbers of dedicated AA searchlight units were created in the TA. The Falmouth company of the D&C; (F) RE was designated No 4 (AA) Company. World War II Cap Badge of the Royal Artillery. As the international situation deteriorated, the TA was ordered to mobilise on 22 August 1939, and the company draw its equipment from store and began to take up its war stations. Company HQ was moved to the D&C; (F) RE HQ at Mutley Barracks, Plymouth, but took its orders from 55th Anti-Aircraft Brigade, which was in the process of formation. Soon afterwards, the company was redesignated 482nd (Devon & Cornwall) Searchlight Company, RE.482 (D&C;) S/L Bty war diary, 1939‚Äì40, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 166/3323. During 1940, all of the RE's AA units were transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA). On 18 June, the company was informed that its new title was to be 482nd (Cornwall) Independent Searchlight Battery, RA. The following month, the opening of the Battle of Britain saw the start of day and night air raids on Plymouth and the searchlights were frequently in action. =81st Searchlight Regiment, RA= Anti-Aircraft Command was expanding rapidly to meet the threat, and new intakes of recruits arrived in Plymouth to form the 509th S/L Battery on 15 September. On 1 November, the two batteries formed the new 81st Searchlight Regiment, RA at Kea, Cornwall, under the command of under Lt-Col H.D. Bennie.Frederick, pp. 860‚Äì2, 874.81 S/L Rgt War Diary 1940‚Äì41, TNA file WO 166/3101. At the same time, 55th AA Bde came under the command of the new 8th Anti-Aircraft Division. As German night bombing increased, 55th AA Bde was responsible for AA defence of Plymouth, Devonport and the vital naval dockyards as well as smaller ports like Falmouth.8 AA Division at British Military History.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396.Farndale, Annex D, p. 251.Farndale, Annex M, pp. 338, 342. For some months, the new regiment shuttled its HQ between Falmouth and Truro. In the new year, 509 Bty formed a Training Troop, which continued training the recruits under the supervision of the experienced 482 Bty. At this time, the S/Ls were deployed in clusters following a 'master light' (ideally equipped with S/L Control (SLC or 'Elsie') radar),Routledge, p. 99.Brigstock. while single lights were provided for homing beacons at airfields or for anti-minelaying duties at harbours such as Falmouth, Penryn and St Mawes. Each site was supplied with three or four Lewis guns for AA defence. 150 cm Searchlight with AA Radar No 2. In April 1941, the regiment was redeployed from Cornwall to North Devon, with RHQ at the Glenhaven Hotel in Mortehoe, and on 5 May was joined by the newly formed 545 and 555 S/L Btys from 230th and 231st S/L Training Regiments at Blandford Camp, but no equipment arrived for them until July and communications to the remote S/L sites were tricky. By September, the availability of SLC radar (AA Radar No 2) was sufficient to allow AA Command's S/L sites to be 'declustered' into single-light sites spaced at 6000-yard intervals in 'Indicator Belts' along the coast and 'Killer Belts' co-operating with night-fighters.Routledge, p. 399. 81st S/L Regiment moved its HQ to Buckland Filleigh and spent the autumn testing its sites for their suitability to mount SLC radar. The redeployment was completed by mid-October. Further adjustments came in November, when 555 Bty deployed lights to defend RAF St Eval, while 509 and 545 Btys moved to Westward Ho! to conduct dazzle experiments. (Although enemy aircraft were occasionally brought down after being dazzled by S/Ls, it was not particularly effective as a tactic.) =131st Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA= On 7 December 1941, it was announced that 81st S/L Rgt had been selected for conversion to the Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) gun role. The regiment moved to Clacton-on-Sea in Essex and joined 29th (East Anglian) AA Brigade in 6th AA Division to prepare for conversion. The establishment of an LAA Rgt was lower than that of a S/L Rgt, so the tradesmen were transferred to other S/L Regts in 6th AA Division, 200 surplus men were drafted to other S/L regiments that were under-strength and another 100 sent to the AA Driver Training Rgt at Fleetwood in Lancashire.29 AA Brigade War Diary 1941, TNA file WO 166/2251.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80. On 12 January 1942, Regimental HQ moved to Boxted House near Colchester and three of the batteries took over vacant LAA gun positions at the RAF airfields at Debden, Martlesham Heath, North Weald and Wattisham to learn the basics of LAA work before attending a training regiment. 555 Bty stayed at Clacton, training at Butlin's Holiday Camp next to 16 LAA Practice Camp.29 AA Brigade War Diary 1942, TNA file WO 166/7386.

AA Command's formation sign. After training, 131st LAA Rgt joined the roster for deployment overseas at a defended port. Since the establishment for this role was only three batteries, the intention was that one of its existing batteries would become an independent unit. However, the regiment remained with AA Command and never went overseas. By now, 29th AA Bde had been disbanded, so when the regiment returned to 6th AA Division it joined 6th AA Bde, then after a period as an unbrigaded regiment,Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, TNA file WO 212/81. it joined 51st AA Bde under 3rd AA Division in Scotland:131 LAA Rgt War Diary 1942, TNA file WO 166/7717.

The batteries were still operating AA light machine guns (LMGs), but when 434 Bty took over sites from 294 LAA Bty (95th LAA Rgt) in June, some of them were equipped with 40 mm Bofors guns, while 433 Bty went to be trained on the Vickers Mk VIII pom-pom. Only in September did a trickle of new Bofors guns begin arriving. =Hit and run= On 2 October, orders were received from 51st AA Bde to move rapidly by rail to 2 AA Group on the South Coast of England, where the AA defences of Southern England were being severely tested by the Luftwaffe's 'hit-and-run' attacks raids by small formations of low-lying fighter-bombers along the South Coast, and there was a requirement for increased LAA cover. Three days later, the regiment was deployed under 71st AA Bde as follows:Routledge, pp. 400‚Äì4. * RHQ at St Leonards-on-Sea * 432 Bty plus B Trp 433 Bty at Hastings with 16 x Bofors guns * 433 Bty less B Trp plus C Trp, 104 Bty, 19th LAA Rgt, at Bexhill-on-Sea with 4 x Bofors and 12 x 20 mm (either Oerlikon or Hispano-Suiza) * 434 Bty at Hawkinge with 8 x Bofors and Folkestone with 4 x Bofors at * 435 Bty with 4 x Bofors at each of Hythe, Dymchurch and Dungeness (shortly afterwards joined by 464 Bty, 140 LAA Rgt) The gunners soon found that it was difficult to traverse their guns quickly enough to engage the fast-moving Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter-bombers coming in low over the coast, often in poor visibility, to drop their bombs or fire their cannons on the towns. Junkers Ju 88s and Dornier Do 215 bombers at medium altitude were easier targets and 434 Bty claimed its first Ju 88 shot down on 20 October ‚Äì but were told that it was a friendly Beaufighter. The regiment's positions and commands were regularly shuffled in efforts to meet the threats: 435 Bty moved to Littlehampton in 47th AA Bde's area, later back to Friston and Eastbourne, while RHQ, 432 and 433 Btys came under operational command of 5th AA Bde. At the beginning of December, 71 AA Bde sent 434 Bty to Dover where it deployed A Troop to cover the harbour, B Trp the radar station, and C Trp the coast defences. Raids continued at intervals during the winter, with the gun sites reporting a few successes, and several near misses from bombs. At various times the regiment was reinforced by troops and batteries from the neighbouring 19 LAA Rgt (60, 104 and 290 AA Btys) and 7 Canadian LAA Rgt (F Trp). When 19 LAA Rgt departed for mobile training at the end of February 1943, 60 Bty was replaced under 131 LAA Rgt's operational control by 230 Bty from 138 LAA Rgt. Early that month, 463 S/L Bty of 71 S/L Rgt arrived to man Vickers K machine guns (8 twins each at Hastings, St Leonards, Bexhill and Eastbourne) under command of 131 LAA Rgt, followed by reinforcements of the same regiment's 462 S/L Bty later in the month. 131 LAA Regiment was also reinforced by six flights of the RAF Regiment equipped with Beaverette armoured cars, and later other flights with 20 mm guns. Anti-Aircraft Barrage balloons were positioned round the vulnerable towns. In March 131 LAA Rgt's defences around Pevensey and Hastings were further increased by 320 Bty of 93 LAA Rgt, which had been borrowed by AA Command from 42nd Armoured Division in December and positioned between Brighton and Seaford. In addition, the local heavy AA unit at Newhaven, 179 (Mixed) HAA Rgt, was trained by 131 LAA Rgt to operate extra Bofors guns against the fleeting targets of opportunity that the Luftwaffe fighter-bombers presented.131 LAA Rgt War Diary 1943, TNA file WO 166/11749.93 LAA Rgt War Diary 1942, TNA file WO 166/7681.93 LAA Rgt War Diary 1943, TNA file WO 166/11720. Peak strength in LAA defences against the hit- and-run attacks was reached in March 1943, and the success rate began to rise that month. On 11 March a force of 20 aircraft attacked Hastings, of which four were shot down (Category I hits) and one damaged (Cat III) by the massed LAA defences. But on 3 April, when 12 enemy aircraft bombed and machine-gunned Eastbourne from the landward side, the Bofors gunners' predictors and range- finders were useless. Only firing with 'open sights' as with the 20 mm and LMGs was effective. The Bofors guns were equipped with auto-loading devices to increase their rate of fire, and gunshields to protect the crews. Further RAF and Canadian LAA gunners 'thickened up' the defences in the regimental area.Routledge, pp. 402‚Äì5. Apart from battery training at No 8 LAA Practice Camp at Watchet, the regiment remained on the South Coast throughout this period, reverting from 5 AA Bde to 71 AA Bde's command on 1 May. When 71 S/L Rgt was disbanded, some of its personnel were drafted to 131 LAA Rgt as reinforcements, their twin Vickers K and triple Lewis guns being positioned at 131 LAA's regimental, battery and troop HQs to be manned by HQ personnel if required. No. 2872 Squadron RAF Regiment arrived in June with twin Browning machine guns to replace the Beaverettes and came under 131 LAA Rgt's operational control, and trials on siting 2-inch AA rocket launchers ('Z Batteries') alongside Bofors guns were carried out. In July a Gun Operations Room (GOR) was established at Bexhill to co-ordinate early warnings, and Lt- Col Bennie of 131 LAA Rgt was appointed AA Defence Commander (AADC) for the Bexhill‚ÄìDungeness Gun Defence Area. However, the increasing casualties inflicted on raiders in May and June led the Luftwaffe to give up these attacks. Throughout the 'hit and run' campaign, Hastings and Eastbourne had been two of the three most heavily attacked towns in England. The regiment remained in its positions through the remainder of 1943 and into 1944. Some men were posted away to mobile units and replaced by men of lower medical category, while a larger number of men considered untrainable in LAA duties were posted away and replaced by male personnel from 173 (Mixed) HAA Rgt.Order of Battle of AA Command, 1 August 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/84. Between 21 January and 14 March 1944, the Luftwaffe crossed SE England to carry out 11 night raids on London in the so-called Baby Blitz. However, by early 1944, AA Command was being forced to release manpower for service overseas, including the planned invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord), and most of AA Command's regiments lost one of their four batteries. In the case of 131st LAA Rgt, it was 435 Bty that left on 17 February, to be disbanded at St Leonards on 16 March.Routledge, pp. 409‚Äì10.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, TNA file WO 212/85. =Operation Diver= Bofors guns at a South Coast LAA battery, August 1944. Soon after D-Day, the Germans began launching V-1 flying bombs against London by day and night. The stream of V-1s, codenamed 'Divers' flew through 2 AA Group's area between Newhaven and North Foreland, and the AA resources in SE England were strongly reinforced in Operation Diver. These small, fast-moving targets flying at 2‚Äì3000 feet were essentially LAA targets, but the early results against them were poor, even with LAA guns interspersed with the searchlight belt where S/L Control (SLC or 'Elsie') radar could guide the guns. The Diver belt was therefore redeployed with emphasis on HAA and LAA guns firing out to sea as the V-1s approached land. 71 AA Brigade, including 131 LAA Rgt formed part of this belt.Routledge, pp. 99, 399, 411‚Äì15. In August 1944, as part of the redistribution of LAA guns, 414 LAA Bty from 144 LAA Rgt was deployed to Hawkinge, just inland from the coast, and attached to 131 LAA Rgt.LAA (Diver) Bty DIM3 at Pastscape. All these units were heavily engaged until the autumn, when 21st Army Group overran the V-1 launching sites in northern France. The emphasis then shifted to the Thames Estuary as the Luftwaffe began launching V-1s from aircraft over the North Sea. 1 AA Group, previously controlling the London Inner Artillery Zone, established a 'Diver Box' covering the estuary and 131 LAA Rgt left 71 AA Bde and joined 57th AA Bde in this box by 16 October 1944. A new 9 AA Group was formed in November 1944 to take over 'Diver' defences in East Anglia, while 1 AA Group concentrated on the estuary.Routledge, p. 417; Maps 38 & 39. In January 1945, RHQ of 131 LAA Rgt moved across the Thames from Gravesend to Orsett under 9 AA Group, the move having been delayed by damage to the new HQ caused by a V-2 rocket. A gun site was damaged by another V2 near miss, and the guns still occasionally engaged V-1s flying over the area towards London.131 LAA Rgt War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 166/16784. =Demobilisation= By now, 21st Army Group fighting in North West Europe was suffering a severe manpower shortage, and at the end of January the regiment had to send 64 NCOs and men to infantry training regiments, receiving 64 infantrymen of lower medical category in exchange. V-1 attacks declined after January, but the regiment witnessed continuous V2 activity during February, and there was a final flare-up of long-range V-1s launched from North Holland in March.Routledge, pp. 418‚Äì9. The regiment continued to man guns at Vital Points at Chatham Dockyard, Sheerness, Purfleet, Tilbury and Thameshaven, with 425 Bty of 129 LAA Rgt at Chelmsford under operational command of 131 LAA Rgt. Lieutenant-Colonel Bennie, OBE, TD, who had commanded the regiment since the formation of 81 S/L Rgt in November 1940, left in March 1945 to command 625 Rgt RA (an infantry battalion formed from 95 LAA Rgt) in NW Europe, and was replaced by Lt-Col T.W.D. Hackett, MC. After VE Day, the state of readiness was maintained on the regiment's gun positions until ordered to stand down by 9 AA Group on 20 May. 432 Bty (the original Cornwall and Devon Fortress RE) became an independent battery in 28 (Thames & Medway) AA Bde, while the rest of 131 LAA Rgt moved from Tilbury to Birmingham. There it was progressively wound down as the men were demobilised. 433 and 434 Btys began to disband in August, and RHQ 131 LAA Regiment officially ceased to exist at West Derby, Liverpool, on 7 March 1946.Order of Battle of AA Command, 15 November 1945, TNA file WO 212/86.Farndale, Annex M. 432 Bty was briefly regimented with 148 LAA Rgt in August 1945 before passing into suspended animation. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, 856th Movement Light Battery (Devon & Cornwall Fortress Engineers) was reformed at Plymouth from 432nd LAA Battery of the former 131 LAA Regiment.Litchfield, p. 48. Movement light or 'artificial moonlight' units used searchlights to illuminate ground operations at night. The battery converted back to the Royal Engineers in 1956.British Army units from 1945 on ‚Äì Regiments TA 80 to 117 (archive page). A new RE unit was formed in Cornwall in 1956, 409 (Cornwall) Independent Field Squadron, but this was created by converting 409 (Cornwall) Coast Regiment, Royal Artillery, the former Duke of Cornwall's Artillery at Falmouth. From 1961, it was included in 116 (Devon and Cornwall) Engineer Regiment. When the TA was converted into the TAVR in 1967, the unit was reconstituted as a company of the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry (Territorials) at Falmouth, with the old title restored: B Company (Cornwall Fortress Engineers). However, the restoration was short-lived, because the TAVR units were reduced to cadre size in 1969, and although they were expanded again in 1971, the Falmouth unit only formed a detachment of C (Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry) Company in 6th Battalion, The Light Infantry (Volunteers), based at Camborne.337‚Äì575 TA Sqns RE at British Army 1945 on. 80‚Äì177 TA Rgts RE at British Army 1945 on.

As the term implies, this is care that the injured party has not paid for, though the law recognizes that it has value, and can be sued for. A personal injury claim consists of two main sections: General damages and Special damages (see Damages), Gratuitous care is a head of claim that comes under Special damages. Special damages normally encompasses expenses that the injured party has paid for (for example taxi fares where he/she has not been able to drive to places as normal), or of monies he/she would have received but has not due to his/her injuries (for example loss of earnings). However, in the case of Gratuitous care the injured party can claim for the care and help he/she has received by friends and/or family even though he/she has probably not actually paid over any money. The law recognises that this care and help provided by friends and family is necessary and would otherwise need to be paid for, and therefore enables the injured party to claim just as he/she would have done if the care had been purchased from an outside agency. Wednesday, 7 October 2020 Gratuitous can be claimed on an hourly basis on what is known as the gratuitous rate. This is based on what the care would have cost in any particular area if provided to the claimant by a commercial organisation, less the profit margin that organisation would make. This profit margin is generally taken to be about one third of the retail cost. So for example if the commercial cost of the care provided would have been ¬£9 per hour, it can be claimed at ¬£6 per hour. Gratuitous care can be claimed on both a past and futures basis.

It is a best-selling novel and recipient of the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Its reviews have generally recognized its excellence, and it was named a New York Times Editor's Choice. The novel fits the expectations of a number of different novel genres: immigrant, mystery, political, metafiction, dark comedic, historical, spy, and war. The story depicts the anonymous narrator, a North Vietnamese mole in the South Vietnamese army, who stays embedded in a South Vietnamese community in exile in the United States. While in the United States, the narrator describes being an expatriate and a cultural advisor on the filming of an American film, closely resembling Platoon and Apocalypse Now, before returning to Vietnam as part of a guerrilla raid against the communists. The dual identity of the narrator, as a mole and immigrant, and the Americanization of the Vietnam War in international literature are central themes in the novel. The novel was published 40 years to the month after the fall of Saigon, which is the initial scene of the book. In February 2020, Nguyen announced in a Facebook post that writing on the sequel, The Committed, was completed and that the book had entered the editing process. Overview Set as the flashback in a coerced confession of a political prisoner, the book tells the story of the South Vietnamese Government in 1975 and subsequent events in American exile in Los Angeles, through the eyes of a half-Vietnamese, half-French undercover communist agent. The spy remains unnamed throughout the novel from the fall of Saigon, to refugee camps and relocation in Los Angeles, to his time as a film consultant in the Philippines, and finally to his return and subsequent imprisonment in Vietnam. The narrator lives in a series of dualities, at times contradictions: he is of mixed blood descent (Vietnamese mother, and French Catholic priest father), raised in Vietnam but attended college in the U.S., and a North Vietnamese mole yet a friend to South Vietnamese military officials and soldiers and a United States CIA agent. During the imminent fall of Saigon, he, as an aide-de-camp, arranges for a last minute flight as part of Operation Frequent Wind, to secure the safety of himself, his best friend Bon, and the General he advises. While they are being evacuated, the group is fired upon while boarding; during the escape, Bon's wife and child are killed along with many others. In Los Angeles, the General and his former officers weaken quickly, disillusioned by a foreign culture and their rapid decline in status. The General attempts to reclaim some semblance of honor by opening his own business, a liquor store. The continuous emasculation and dehumanization within American society prompts the General to draft plans for assembling an army of South Vietnamese expatriates to return as rebels to Vietnam. While participating in the expatriate unit, the narrator takes a clerical position at Occidental College, begins having an affair with Ms. Mori, his Japanese- American colleague, and then the General's eldest daughter, Lana. While living in the United States, the narrator sends letters in invisible ink to Man, a North Vietnamese revolutionary and handler, providing intelligence about the General's attempts at raising a commando army. When he receives an offer to consult for a Hollywood film on the Vietnam War called The Hamlet, he sees it as an opportunity to show multiple sides of the War and to give the Vietnamese a voice in its historical portrayal. However, working on set in the Philippines, he not only fails to complicate the misleading, romantically American representation of the war, but almost dies when explosives detonate long before they should. There is skepticism as to whether the explosion was a mistake since the director greatly dislikes the narrator. After he recovers, against Man's insistence that he stay in the U.S. and continue his work as a mole, the narrator decides to accompany the exiled troops back into Vietnam. Before he returns, he executes a left-leaning Vietnamese newspaper editor, \\"Sonny\\", who he learns had an affair with Ms. Mori while the narrator was in the Philippines. During his mission in Vietnam, he manages to barely save Bon's life. However, it is to no heroic avail as they are captured and imprisoned. The encampment is where the protagonist writes his confession, a plea for absolution addressed to the commandant who is directed by the commissar. However, rather than writing what his communist comrades wish to hear, the protagonist writes a complex and nuanced reflection of the events that have led him to his imprisonment. He refuses to show only one side, he leaves nothing out (even his painful memories of a childhood without a father or of his first experience masturbating), and he sympathizes with the many perspectives of a complicated conflict that has divided a nation. While he still considers himself a communist and revolutionary, he acknowledges his friendships with those who are supposedly his enemy and he understands all soldiers as honorably fighting for their home. When his confession drafts are rejected, he is finally brought before the commissar. The commissar, the man with no face, turns out to be his direct superior Man. Yet, this does not stop Man from subjecting him to torture as part of his reeducation. First, he must admit his crime of being compliant in the torturing and raping of a female communist agent. Then he must realize that he took part, albeit unconsciously, in the murder of his father. Lastly, he must learn Man's final lesson that a revolution fought for independence and freedom could make those things worth less than nothing, that nothingness itself was more precious than independence and freedom. The novel ends with the narrator among a crowd of boat people at sea.  Style  Almost every review comments on the most distinctive stylistic feature: the anonymous narrator who provides continuous commentary. The narrator has an \\"acrobatic ability\\" that guides the reader through the contradictions of the war and American identity. The first person narration derives from the frame context for the book: a confession by the narrator to communist captors trying to make him account for his exile. The communist captors force him to write and rewrite the narrative, in an attempt to correct his ideological lens on America and the South Vietnamese enemies. Many critiques compare the narrator's style to other authors, typically American authors. Randy Boyagoda, writing for The Guardian, describes the initial passage of the novel as a \\"showy riff on Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man\\". For Boyagoda, the anonymity and doubled life reflection of the narrator closely parallel the African American narrator of Invisible Man's commentary from the perspective of concealment. Ron Charles describes the narrative voice as close to both \\"Roth-inspired comic scene[s] of self-abuse\\" and \\"gorgeous Whitmanian catalogue of suffering\\".  Themes  Most reviews of the novel describe it as a literary response to the typically American-centric worldview of works like Apocalypse Now and Platoon. In particular, the section of the novel where the narrator advises on The Hamlet helps critically examine this worldview. Ron Charles describes this section as \\"As funny as it is tragic\\", able to \\"carry the whole novel\\". The New York Times' book review describes the war as a \\"literary war\\", and says that Nguyen's The Sympathizer is \\"giving voice to the previously voiceless [Vietnamese perspective] while it compels the rest of us to look at the events of 40 years ago in a new light\\". In part, the novel is a response to Nguyen's own admiration of but difficult relationship with works like Platoon, Apocalypse Now, and Rambo and the slaughter of Vietnamese in the films. The narrator's duality of caste, education, and loyalties drive much of the novels' activities. At first this duality is the strength of the novel's narrator, providing deft critique and investigation into the contradictions of social situations, but eventually, in the last, this duality \\"becomes an absurdist tour de force that might have been written by a Kafka or Genet\\".  Reception  The New York Times Book Review praised the novel for its place in the broader Vietnam War literature, and for its treatment of dualities in a way that \\"compares favorably with masters like Conrad, Greene and le Carr√©\\". Writing for The Washington Post, Ron Charles called the novel \\"surely a new classic of war fiction\\" which is \\"startlingly insightful and perilously candid\\". For Charles, it is less the particulars of the thematic explosion of the response to the Vietnam war that makes the novel relevant, but rather how \\"Nguyen plumbs the loneliness of human life, the costs of fraternity and the tragic limits of our sympathy\\". Randy Boyagoda, writing for The Guardian, describes it as a \\"bold, artful and globally minded reimagining of the Vietnam war and its interwoven private and public legacies\\". A Vietnamese reviewer noted that, finally, Americans have a chance to gain a new perspective on the war, one that is in contrast to the one provided by Hollywood myth-makers. The main critique from reviewers is, at times, the overwritten description in the novel. Though generally supportive of the novel, Boyagoda describes this overwriting: \\"the Captain's grandstanding against east/west stereotypes and against the putative ills of the US and Catholicism clogs his monologue because it does little more than advance an equally hackneyed set of complaints and rebuttals. Nguyen's own academic background also seeps in, inspiring didactic language.\\" Awards * Winner, 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction * Winner, 2016 Dayton Literary Peace Prize * Winner, 2016 Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction * Winner, 2016 Edgar Award for Best First Novel * Winner, 2015 Center for Fiction First Novel Prize * Winner, 2015 Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature * Finalist, 2016 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction * Shortlisted, 2017 International Dublin Literary Award See also * Ph·∫°m Xu√¢n ·∫®n References Category:2015 American novels Category:Novels set in Los Angeles Category:Pulitzer Prize for Fiction-winning works Category:American spy novels Category:Novels set during the Vietnam War Category:Vietnamese-American novels Category:English-language books Category:Grove Press books Category:2015 debut novels ","title":"The Sympathizer"},{"id":"48306309","text":"John Bellamy or Iohn Bellamie (ca. 1596‚Äì1653) was an English publisher, semi- separatist and bookseller. He is noted for his connections with the Leyden Community and Mayflower passengers.  Pilgrim Publisher of London  In 1611 Bellamy began his apprenticeship under Nicholas Bourne of London. In 1619/20, Bellamy's term of service terminated. John Bellamy certainly knew Edward Winslow, because Edward Winslow was an apprentice under John Beale and at his bookshop Bourne stocked the titles that Beale had printed. In 1622, Bellamy set up his first shop called \\"Two Greyhounds\\" in Cornhill, near the Royal Exchange. Two years later, he set up a new bookshop called \\"Three Golden Lyons\\", selling and publishing books related to puritans and the New England colonies. Bellamy had published numerous works of the most distinguished puritan leaders, historians, and New England colonists. They are Henry Ainsworth, John Robinson, John Cotton, John Wemyss (Weemse), Edward Winslow, William Bradford, Thomas Hooker, Thomas Shepard, William Wood and Philip Vincent. In 1622, he issued Mourt's Relation, one of the most important narratives relating to New England. In 1624, he published \\"Good Newes from New England\\", another important work by Edward Winslow. In the 1620s/1630s, he published Henry Ainsworth's \\"Annotations upon the five books of Moses\\". Bellamy's contact with the New England colonists was not limited to the publication of the work of their spokesmen. He also supplied them books. When William Brewster came to Plymouth on the Mayflower ship in 1620, he brought with him many books. During the remainder of his life at Plymouth his library was augmented, and it included additional books bought from John Bellamy after 1620.

After finishing unplaced in her only start as a juvenile, she improved to become a top-class stayer in the summer and autumn of 1990. She won both the Ribblesdale Stakes and the Yorkshire Oaks before finishing second when favourite for the St Leger and being the first filly home in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. She later became an outstanding broodmare, producing Islington, and several other major winners. She was retired from breeding in 2010 and died a year later. Background Hellenic was a bay mare with no white markings bred in County Meath by the Ballymacoll Stud. She was sired by Darshaan who won the Prix du Jockey Club for the Aga Khan in 1984 before becoming a successful breeding stallion. The best of his other offspring included Dalakhani, Mark of Esteem and Kotashaan. Hellenic's dam Grecian Sea won one minor race and produced several other winners. She was descended from Knighton House, a full-sister to Reform and a distant relative of North Light and Golan. During her racing career the filly was trained at Freemason Lodge in Newmarket, Suffolk by Michael Stoute and ran in the colours of Ballymacoll's part-owner Arnold Weinstock. She was ridden in all but one of her races by Walter Swinburn. Racing career =1989: two-year-old season= Hellenic made her only appearance as a two-year-old on 7 November 1989 when she ran in a maiden race over one mile at Leicester Racecourse. She started at odds of 11/4 and finished fourth of the seventeen runners behind Lover's Moon, Sanglamore and Visage. =1990: three-year-old season= Hellenic began her second season in the Middleton Stakes at York Racecourse on 16 May. The race is now a Group Two race for older fillies and mares but was then a Graduation race, restricted to three-year-old fillies with no more than one previous win. Starting favourite in a seven-runner field she took the lead approaching the last quarter mile and won by two lengths from the outsider Ballet Classique. On her next appearance, Hellenic was sent to Royal Ascot and moved up in class and distance for the Group Two Ribblesdale Stakes over one and a half miles and started the 6/1 third favourite behind Line of Thunder, a filly who had not run since being narrowly beaten in the 1989 Cheveley Park Stakes and Pharian (winner of the Cheshire Oaks). Hellenic turned into the straight in fourth place, took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew away to win by six lengths from Ivrea, with gaps of seven and five lengths back to Gharam and Spode's Blue in third and fourth. In the Group One Yorkshire Oaks on 22 August, Hellenic started 100/30 second favourite behind her stablemate Kartajana, the winner of the Nassau Stakes. Swinburn opted to ride Kartajana whilst the veteran Scottish jockey Willie Carson took the mount on Hellenic. The other four runners were Wajd (Prix Minerve), Game Plan (Pretty Polly Stakes, runner-up in The Oaks), Cruising Height (runner-up in the Lancashire Oaks) and Ruby Tiger (later to win the E. P. Taylor Stakes). Hellenic was towards the rear of the field in the early stages as Cruising Height set the pace from Kartajana and began to come under pressure at half way. Kartajana took the lead approaching the last quarter mile but Hellenic, switched to the outside by Carson, began to make progress before overtaking her stable companion inside the final furlong and winning by one and a half lengths. On 15 September at Doncaster, Hellenic was the only filly in an eight-runner field for the St Leger and started the 2/1 favourite ahead of the colts River God (Queen's Vase) and Snurge. Hellenic took the lead in the straight but was overtaken by Snurge two furlongs out. The pair drew away from their rivals in the closing stages with the colt prevailing by three quarters of a length. Three weeks later, Hellenic was sent to France to contest Europe's most prestigious weight-for-age race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. She finished eighth of the twenty- one runners, seven lengths behind the winner Saumarez, and achieved the best placing of the three-year-old fillies, ahead of In the Groove and Salsabil. Breeding record Hellenic was retired from racing for become a broodmare for the Ballymacoll Stud. She was a great success in the breeding paddocks, producing at least nine winners from fourteen foals including the Group One winners Islington, Greek Dance and Mountain High: *Election Day, a bay colt, foaled in 1992, sired by Sadler's Wells. Won two races including the Listed Aston Park Stakes and finished third in the Ascot Gold Cup. *Desert Beauty, bay filly, 1994, by Green Desert. Won two races. *Greek Dance, bay colt, 1995, by Sadler's Wells. Won four races including the Bayerisches Zuchtrennen. *Greek Academy, bay colt, 1996, by Royal Academy. Unraced. *Welsh Star, chestnut colt, 1997, by Caerleon. Unraced. *Islington, bay filly, 1999, by Sadler's Wells.

Unplaced in only start. *Just Look Don'tTouch, filly, 2008, by Galileo. Unraced. She was retired from breeding in 2010 at the age of 23. The Ballymacoll Stud manager Peter Reynolds said \\"She's in perfect health and looks brilliant. She has only missed one year since she retired, but can't go on forever. She is a wonderful character, very easy to do anything with, a proper lady.\\" She was euthanized at Ballymacoll in July 2011. Reynolds commented \\"she has had trouble with chronic arthritis. It is one thing to be dealing with in July but it would have been a lot harder for her in the winter months and the one thing you don't want to see is a horse suffer, so we did what we felt was the kindest thing for her.\\" Pedigree References Category:1987 racehorse births Category:2011 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 5-h ","title":"Hellenic (horse)"},{"id":"48306329","text":"Park Lane Academy is a non-selective mixed secondary school located in Exley (near Halifax), West Yorkshire, England.

History  WikiToLearn started as WikiFM in Milan by a group of science students from the University of Milan Bicocca on the May 1, 2012. WikiFM was originally launched as a private wiki for exchange of links, suggestions and other information related to studying at the University of Milan Bicocca. In May 2013 the website has been publicly announced using some money destined to student associations of the University of Milan Bicocca. For this historical reason, while the project has an international aim, the bulk of the oldest content is in Italian. In September 2013 WikiFM received the sponsorship of Wikimedia Italia. In December 2013, WikiFM officially joined the KDE project, by entering, as first project, KDE's incubator program.http://community.kde.org/Incubator/Projects/WikiFM It was later advertised by the KDE project as one of its most important success stories.  From WikiFM to WikiToLearn  2015 has been the turning point for the project. The key event happened during KDE‚Äôs annual conference, Akademy. In July 2015, Riccardo Iaconelli has given a speech on the WikiFM project in order to submit it to the attention of the international community. On this occasion, the website has enriched to accommodate multiple languages, to embrace a larger number of people using their native language. Following the initial feedback, WikiFM was subsequently renamed to WikiToLearn. The project thus started to gather a more official attention from educational institutions. The first foundation interested in using WikiToLearn as a training/tutoring platform has been the High Energy Physics Software Foundation, which experimentally tried its own section on the English website. Several professors from different institutions have subsequently started to collaborate on WikiToLearn, like CERN, HSF,http://news.hepsoftwarefoundation.org/workinggroups/2015/11/04/training.html and Fermilab. In September 2015, the University of Milano-Bicocca became the first institution to officially back the project, asking professors and students to populate the portal with educational content.  The project  The goal of WikiToLearn is to provide free, collaborative and accessible textbooks for the whole world, with a focus on training and didactics. To reach this goal, the project relies on the combined effort of many volunteers in the academic world. Content are written by both students, who ideally start to create textbooks while studying the subject in question, and professors, who provide thorough fact-checking and accuracy.

Historically, tax rates were low and evasion and avoidance were widespread. The 1988 Constitution called for an enhanced role of the State in society, requiring increased tax revenue. In 1960, and again between 1998 and 2004, efforts were made to make the collection system more efficient. Tax revenue gradually increased from 13.8% of GDP in 1947 to 37.4% in 2005. Tax revenue has become quite high by international standards, but without realising commensurate social benefit. More than half the total tax is in the regressive form of taxes on consumption.  Considerations on taxes in Brazil  The Brazilian tax system is a legacy of the Empire, a period that was initially focused on taxes on imports. It had its first significant change only with the Constitution of 1934, when internal taxes on products began to gain projection. In 1960 a reform in order to increase the storage capacity of the state and increase the economic efficiency of the system was introduced. After 1960, alterations were made only in the sense of raising the storage capacity and reduce the degree of distribution of taxes between the federal entities. The end result is that the system is caught in a vicious circle, where tax rates are high and taxes are created. The Brazilian tax reality is notoriously complex, bringing a huge financial cost to the taxpayer, and also causing the constant insecurity of being or not complying with all obligations required by the tax authorities. The site BIPT ‚Äì Brazilian Institute of Tax Planning ‚Äì includes data for 2006 that demonstrate the existence of about 61 taxes levied in Brazil, including taxes, fees and contributions. The system is further overloaded by the huge amount of rules governing the tax system, supplementary laws, ordinary laws, decrees, orders, instructions. There are over 3,000 standards in effect, and the cost that companies have to comply with ancillary obligations is about 1% of their turnover. Those human needs for which the state is responsible, can only be met from the collection of taxes. Moreover, the existence of tax collection is essential for the organized state to maintain itself.  General considerations on the national tax structure  The real growth of federal revenues grew more quickly between 1998 and 2004. Nevertheless, the differences noted throughout that period are too sharp to be explained only by higher rates. The additional variable used to explain the recent behavior of the collection, where successive records are announced, is the surveillance effort, which was significantly increased over the last ten years. During that period there was a move towards to raise the efficiency of the supervisory structure through increases in infrastructure, personnel and new laws. Revenue gains with increases in existing rates are potentially higher than those that would occur with the creation of new taxes. One of the Brazilian government's objectives was, in recent years, raising revenue to reduce the public deficit, with the exchange of more complex taxes by less complex collection and can be cited as an example of this strategy the creation of the CPMF, producing significant gains. Additional gains from such exchange of taxes are obtained by more effective surveillance for less complex in terms of tax collection. It can be seen that the level of effort made by the federal government in order to increase tax revenue, was not negligible in recent years. The increase in the number of registered companies in the outstanding debt shows the growing work of the Attorney General of the National Treasury. There is a direct relationship between revenues and the balance in charge, indicating a high degree of importance of the efforts made by the authorities in the audit.  Tax policy and social function tribute  It should be stressed how aloof are individuals before tax levies. The story of all time, is filled with expressions of displeasure about the state initiative to make tax releases, mainly because, in purely arithmetical terms, the payment of taxes produces impoverishment of the taxpayer. On the other hand, that same taxpayer is not always pleased with the way the state manages the earned financial resources. Brazil is an economy with low tax tradition, where evasion and avoidance are not suppressed with the same intensity observed in other countries with more solid tax tradition. The relationship between the state and the taxpayer has been characterized for a long time as a relationship of power and coercion. In constitutional terms, the highlights are the principles that seek to delimit the state action. This action falls within the context of tax policy. The tax policy, although it consists of tax collection instrument necessarily need not result in imposition and may have tax and extrafiscal character. It is understood as fiscal policy, taxation of activities carried out with the purpose of raising money, or transferring money from the private to the public coffers. The state just wants to get funding. Extrafiscal policy through the tax legislation could encourage or discourage behavior, according to the interests of society, through a regressive or progressive taxation, or for the granting of tax incentives. It can be said that through this policy, taxation activity is intended to interfere in the economy, i.e. the relations of production and circulation of wealth. The commitment to the economic development inserted within a theoretical dissociation with the guarantee of equality of opportunity has become latent in the Federal Constitution of 1988, establishing a duty to ensure the full exercise of citizenship within the fundamentals of the Brazilian democratic state. The text of the 1988 Constitution was a milestone, containing legal provisions committed to eradicating poverty and reducing social inequalities, prohibition of discrimination of origin, sex, race and color. In this context, the state assumed new front should those with which exercises its power, starting to design public policies committed to the enhancement of life and reducing inequalities. In this aspect the 1988 Constitution, in a leading position and effective in the economic area, takes the economic model of welfare, giving the state agent role responsible for the planning and creation of public policies for economic development linked to the promotion of economic development, in conjunction with the reduction of inequalities of opportunity policies. Within the new perspective inaugurated by the 1988 Constitution, the committed economic development with social question arises not only as a necessity, but also as state power and duty, imbued with wide autonomy to define its public policies, which brings out of tax law issues as an indispensable tool. Primarily tribute manifests itself in the form of essential burden to finance state activities committed to the creation of social policies.  Tax burden in Brazil  The first known measure of the Brazilian tax burden was made in 1947 and resulted in a percentage of 13.8% of GDP. Since then, the measure has been growing gradually and continuously. Yet, according to data from the Internal Revenue Service of Brazil, in 1965, the Brazilian tax burden reached 19% of GDP. With the change in the Brazilian tax system, made possible by Amendment No. 18 of 1December 1965, there was significant growth, reaching up to 26% of GDP index. In 1986, the analysis of the tax burden resulted in 26.2% of the national GDP. The analysis of the Federal Revenue of Brazil for 2005 indicates the percentage of 37.37% of GDP. The Brazilian tax burden amounts to 1/3 of the GDP share and places Brazil in the list of countries with the highest burdens in the world, comparable to France, Germany and Sweden, without, however, promoting the same return for the population that these countries provide. Noteworthy in these figures the importance of indirect taxes levied on all taxpayers. Given this number, it can be inferred that in Brazil, taxes have high share in GDP, these numbers consistent with the levels of developed countries and incompatible with the low quality of state consideration offered, especially in the social sphere. The explicit dichotomy, obtained by analysis of the collection product in relation to the state consideration leads to the unequivocal conclusion that the high national tax revenue is lost before reaching its intended purpose. Revenue collections annually achieves a record: in contrast, investments in state consideration of social services and projects experience a stagnation of the amounts invested, covering the inversely proportional to the growth path, compared to what it collects and population increase.  Levy profile  The collection of federal taxes on the reserve base, shows that of the amount collected by the IRS of Brazil, the majority of the taxes are based on consumption, with approximately 53% on average of the funds raised by Revenue Federal Brazil and continue accounting for more than half of tax (52%) charged by the agency. This tax structure is even more perverse when we add the taxes collected at the state and municipal levels, which bring in the largest source of revenue. The tax burden on consumption is regressive. In Brazil those who earn up to twice the minimum wage spend 26% of their income to pay indirect taxes, while the tax burden for families with income higher than 30 times the minimum wage amounts to only 7%. Excessive taxation on consumption depresses demand directly affecting the economy, reducing the consumption of the middle and lower income families. Taxes that affect equity in Brazil have an insignificant collection, and the taxes on income remained virtually the same share of the total revenues, from 38.80% on average to 41.14%.

Star- Lord was able to record Titus' confession of joining the Nova Corps to get involved with the black market and forwards it to the Nova Corps HQ. Titus is defeated by the Guardians of the Galaxy and later arrested by the Nova Corps as he vows to have his revenge on Star-Lord. In the episode \\"Rock Your Baby,\\" the rampant Nova Centurion Helmet causes a mass prison break as Titus claims it and heads to confront the Guardians of the Galaxy who have a Warlock in their possession. Titus' fight with the Guardians of the Galaxy takes them to the planet Onateyac as Titus tries to get Warlock to destroy them. When Warlock's gem turns dark, he makes Titus disappear. In the episode, \\"You Do not Always Get What You Want,\\" Titus is shown in Adam Warlock's gem while also a prisoner of the High Evolutionary. =Video games= Titus appears in Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2.

Introduction Whereas traditional bioinformatics is a wide subject it has a large focus on molecular biology, pharmaceutical bioinformatics more specifically targets chemical-biological interaction and exploratory focus of chemical and biological interactors using e.g. cheminformatics and chemometrics methods. Methods include, apart from many general bioinformatics methods, ligand-based modeling such as Quantitative structure‚Äìactivity relationship (QSAR) and proteochemometrics, computer-aided molecular design, chembioinformatics databases, algorithms for chemical software, and biopharmaceutical chemistry including analyses of biological activity and other issues related to drug discovery.  In silico metabolism prediction  One of the major fields within pharmaceutical bioinformatics is the in silico metabolism prediction of drug candidates. This field is in turn divided into three tasks; * Predicting the occurrence of an interaction between a compound and an enzyme, * Predicting the location in the compound that takes part in the interaction, i.e. the site of metabolism (SOM), * Predicting the outcome from the interaction, i.e. the resulting metabolite product. There are several existing tools trying to solve these tasks, e.g. SMARTCyp and MetaPrint2D predicts the SOM for chemical compounds. Software and tools There are many software tools for pharmaceutical bioinformatics. An example of an open source tool is the Bioclipse workbench.

History  =Origins= The origins of Congregation Sisters of the Most Holy Trinity are traced to four young country women of Saint-Nizier-de-Forez in the archidiocese of Lyon (France). They had joined the Confraternity of the Most Holy Trinity in 1660 and were zealous to serve God in some special way. Under the direction of their leader, Jeanne Adrian adruab, they formed a community and, in 1675, asked the archbishop of Lyon, Camille de Neuville, to allow them to open a combination of school and hostel where they could instruct unschooled poor girls. The archbishop granted their request on the condition that they not go on to become a religious institute. However, in 1676, encouraged by the archdiocesan vicar general, Monsieur de Morange, the community assumed the name of Filles de la Confr√©rie Trinitaire along with the rule and habit of the Trinitarian Recollect order of nuns. They combined the education of youth and the care of the sick with an austere regimen of life. They fasted and abstained of the Divine Office at midnight, and five acts of adoration to the Most Holy Trinity and two hours of prayer during the day. Within a few years the community had five houses. =The Filles at Valence= In 1685, the Filles de Saint-Nizier, as they were commonly called, accepted the management of St. John's Hospital in the city of Valence (Dr√¥me) which became the headquarters of the Congregation. The first superior, Mother Jeanne Adrian, was loved by townspeople and esteemed as a saint when she died in 1688. Life became very hard for the Sisters, especially in 1690, when the wounded in the War of the League of Augsburg crowded their hospital to four times its capacity. In 1695, the third superior general, Mother Marie-Marthe de la Forge, a blood sister of Minister General Gregoire de La Forge, had the congregation redefine its purpose, which was stated to be the glorification of the Most Holy Trinity though a ministry of redemption of people enslaved by sin. In 1727, the Congregation was given legal recognition by King Louis XV, and, ten years later, Bishop Millon of Valance updated their Rule, aligning it with their increased involvement in the hospital and teaching ministries. The habit of the Trinitarians Sisters of Valence in 1847 =The Sisters during the French Revolution= During the French Revolution, all convents and monasteries were suppressed, but the Sisters of Valence were allowed to stay in their hospitals. The scarcity of lay nurses willing to care for the wounded soldiers made their services indispensable. The Sisters were even allowed to wear the religious habit, which the attending doctors told the revolutionary authorities was necessary to assure respect from the soldiers. At St. John's Hospital in Valence, the chapel was converted into a hospital ward, and the attic of the convent was used as a hiding place for r√©fractaires priests who, in the dead of night, would say Mass for the Sisters and a few trusted faithful of the area. When some revolutionary guards attempted to arrest the Sisters for refusing to take the oath of fealty to the Revolutionary Government, the townspeople besieged the police station and forced the gendarmes to release them. The sister who tactfully guided the Congregarion during the difficult years of the Revolution was Motehr Blanche-Agn√®s Dubost. She was superior general from 1790 until her death in 1820. The pope Pius VI was imprisoned by Napoleon in the fortress of Valence. Eight of the Sisters, and Fr. Girolamo Malachia Fantini (trinitarian father), the pope's personal chaplain, were the only ones allowed to visit and care for the Pontiff. =Expansion= In the effort to keep the Congregation alive, Mother Blanche- Agn√®s Dubost succeeded in having the autonomous hospitals of Valence, Mont√©limar and Crest form a corporation legally recognized by the Consulate (1810). In 1818, the town council decided to remove the patients from the Sisters' hospital in Valence, but gave them the building in recognition of past services. The house became the headquarters and novitiate of the Congregation. A steady growth in membership followed the disruption of the Revolution and occasioned the opening of new convents, schools, hospitals, day clinics, homens for the aged and orphanages throughout France and, from 1840 on, in North Africa. In 1880, one hundred fifty Sisters served in nineteen hospitals, clinics and schools attached to their fifteen convents in Algeria. A series of anticlerical laws issued by the French government that year caused the Sisters to lose seventy schools throughout France and Algeria. This prompted the Sisters to start making foundations outside France. So it was that the Congregation expanded to England (1886), Switzerland (1891), Belgium (1895), Italy (1903), Madagascar (1928), Gabon (1963), USA (1964), Spain (1968), Ireland (1977), South Korea (1985), Colombia (1986), Cameroon (1996), China (1996), and Peru (2007). The Congregation became a pontifical institute in 1891. In the course of time the following French congregations of Trinitarian sisters merged with the Sisters of Valence: * The Trinitarian sisters of Lyon, founded in 1711 for the education of children from broken families, these sisters survived with difficulty the suppressions of religious orders by the French Revolution. The reduced membership caused them to merge with the Sisters of Valence in 1848. * The Trinitarian Sisters of Planc√∂et, founded in 1860 and merged with the Sisters of Valence in 1871. * The Trinitarian sisters of Dinard, founded in 1865 for the education of poor girls, these sisters merged with the Sisters of Valence in 1871. * The Discalced Trinitarian Sisters of Marseille or the Trinitarian Sisters of St. Martha, founded in 1843 and merged with the Sisters of Valence in 1964. The Congregation today =Organization= The Trinitarian Sisters of Valence are headed by the Superior General and the congregation's general council; these officers serve six-year terms; the Superior General and the members of the general council are elected by the Chapter General, which meets every six years or upon the death of the Superior General. Each local Trinitarian community is headed by a superior, called a Superior, who is appointed to a three-year term and can be renewed for a second three-year term. The current Superior General of the Trinitarian Sisters of Valence is Mother Lecaillon Benedicte-Marie C.SS.T. =Distribution= In 2013, the Sisters of Valence numbered about 317 and had 50 houses. They are in Europe: France, England, Ireland, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy; in Africa: Cameroon, Gabon, Congo, and Madagascar; in America: Canada, Colombia and Peru; in Asia: China, South Korea, Philippines and Vietnam. Their headquarters is at 17 Rue Chazi√®re, 69004 Lyon, France.

The station building was on the east platform, to the south of the road overbridge which crossed the platforms, which extended under the bridge at the north. The building was a two-storey brick-built building accessed from Lily Lane with the booking hall at road level, steps went down to each platform, the west-side platform steps descending from a pedestrian bridge crossing the lines. There was a wooden shelter on each platform. The maps and photographs show a line to the west of the station, this was a mineral line connecting Cross Tetly's Bamfurlong and Mains Collieries. At the time of opening the station hosted four trains to and five from Wigan.

The station closed on 27 November 1950. After closure Following the dismantling of Bamfurlong railway station, a platform remained for many years, increasingly overgrown. By 2015 the only remaining evidence was the track alignment. Local passenger traffic ceased between Crewe and Preston via Earlestown on 6 October 1969. The lines through the station site were electrified as part of the West Coast Main Line (WCML) modernisation in 1974, this involved the bridge carrying Lily Lane to be rebuilt during the period 1970/1 to provide additional clearance.

It remains one of the most sought after lost horror films of the silent era. All that remains are some still photos. The Wizard did not follow the Leroux novel so closely, turning the story instead into more of an \\"old dark house\\" thriller. The film also had a very strong anti-death penalty message, typical of films of this period. it was released soon after the release of a similar film called The Gorilla (also 1927), which stole some of the Fox film's thunder. Balaoo had been filmed earlier in 1913 as Balaoo, the Demon Baboon, and the film's screenplay would later inspire the 1942 film Dr. Renault's Secret. Plot Paul Coriolos is a professor who seeks vengeance on the members of a jury who sentenced his son to death at the gallows, who he swore was innocent. The professor goes into his dark laboratory where he creates a creature out of a gorilla whom he trains to kill his enemies. Meanwhile, a newspaper reporter named Stanley Gordon and a detective named Murphy are both on the case of the murders. Gordon seeks to save Judge Webster and his daughter Anne who are both marked for death. Eventually discovering who is behind the murders, Gordon faces Prof. Coriolos and his simian henchman in a final confrontation.

According to the Annales Fontanellenses, his father was Warin of Provence.Janet L. Nelson, Charles the Bald (London: Longman, 1992), 161 n. 4. In 850, Isembard and Count Aledramn of Barcelona were sent by King Charles the Bald to subdue the rebellious Margrave William of Septimania. They were both captured through a ruse.Janet L. Nelson, The Annals of St-Bertin (Manchester University Press, 1991), 69 n. 1. On 21 March 858, at the synod of Quierzy, Isembard was one of the lay magnates who swore fidelity to King Charles.Nelson, Charles the Bald, 186. He was thus probably one of the \\"leading men of Burgundy\\" whom the Annales Bertiniani record as joined Charles at Brienne and Chalon that November, when he and Louis the German almost came to battle. On 20 June 859, Isembard (or possibly his son), described as a fidelis (loyal follower) in the charter, received a villa in the Narbonnais from the king, to be held in perpetuity (in proprium aeternaliter) as an allod.Nelson, Annals of St-Bertin, 88 n. 15.Archibald R. Lewis, The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society, 718‚Äì1050 (University of Texas Press, 1965), 115, 119, 162. This royal grant was made at the instigation of Humfrid, the margrave of Gothia. In 864, Isembard (or possibly his son again) was a royal missus and the viscount of Narbonne. The appointment of a royal fidelis to the office of viscount demonstrates that at this stage in Charles's reign, the king still coveted influence at the local level even in the far south of his realm.

Location Xujiayao is located on the west bank of the Liyi River, a tributary of the Sanggan River. Xujiayao actually consists of two sites, Locality 73113 and Locality 74093. Locality 73113 is located near Xujiayao village in Yanggao County, Shanxi, while Locality 74093 is located near Houjiayao village in Yangyuan County, Hebei. Most of the fossils and artefacts were found at Locality 74093. Discovery and excavations Xujiayao was discovered by researchers from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) in 1974. IVPP carried out excavations in 1976, 1977, and 1979. Later excavations, in 2007 and 2008, were carried out by the Hebei Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics. The Xujiayao hominin The Xujiayao hominin Twenty hominid fossils were discovered at Xujiayao, consisting of 12 parietal bones, 1 temporal bone, 2 occipital bones, 1 mandibular bone fragment, 1 juvenile maxilla, and 3 isolated teeth. The fossils remains at Xujiayao are difficult to classify and are of an uncertain taxonomic lineage, possibly representing a distinct hominin lineage. The Xujiayao fossils are characterized by a mix of Homo erectus and Homo sapiens features. The skulls also have a thick cranial vault, at the upper range of Homo erectus pekinensis. The maxilla exhibits features more typical of modern Homo sapiens. Dental analysis shows that the Xujiayao hominin appears to retain many archaic features found in hominin fossils, such as Homo pekinensis, from the Early and Middle Pleistocene in East Asia, share more similarities with these earlier East Asian hominins, and share some similarities with Neanderthals. While fossil sample Xujiayao 15 had mostly non-Neanderthal features appearance-wise, a CT scan revealed that the inner ear, surprisingly, was arranged in a way that was typical of Neanderthal inner ears. One of the fossil samples, Xujiayao 11, had an enlarged parietal foramen (a hole in the skull), an extremely rare abnormality that is found in less than 1 out of 25,000 cases in modern humans. Xujiayao 11 is the oldest hominin fossil to exhibit this abnormality. Fauna Around 5000 specimens from twenty-one distinct species are represented at Xujiayao. The large majority of the remains belong to Przewalski's horse and Equus hemionus. The next most common remains belong to Coelodonta, Spirocerus (Xujiayao antelope/Spirocerus hsuchiayaocus and Pei's antelope/Spirocerus peii), Procapra and Gazella. Some red deer, sika deer and pig remains were also found. The Xujiayao hominin excelled as horse hunters, having regular access to animal protein, primarily coming from equids. Artefacts Almost 30,000 lithic, bone and antler artefacts were also unearthed at Xujiayao. Tools found at Xujiayao include scrapers, points, gravers, anvils, chopper and spheroids. Over 50% of the artefacts consist of finished tools. Over 40% of the artefacts consist of scrapers. The artefacts there include the presence of over 1000 stone spheroids, the most of any Paleolithic site in China.

In 2013, he held an exhibition called \\"A Childhood not for Children.\\"  Death  Nikolayev was previously attacked by members of the Berkut special police forces when reporting on a \\"Euromaidan\\" event in Kiev on 1 December 2013. Nikolayev was killed in crossfire while covering fighting between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian separatists in the village of Peski on the outskirts of Donetsk on 28 February 2015. Pesky is located just 1.5 kilometers away from Donetsk airport. He was there with colleague Bogdan Rossinsky, Rossinsky was non-lethally wounded and Serhiy suffered serious injuries.

He was wearing a bulletproof vest marked as \\"Press\\" at the scene. Nikolay (or Mykola) Flerko, a volunteer in Right Sector battalion was also declared dead from the shell. The police in Krasnoarmeysk are investigating the incident as a deliberate homicide.  Context  The conflict, between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian military, arose after former Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych's departure in March 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine and the occupation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula with the pretext to \\"protect ethnic Russians living there.\\" Russia continues supplying separatists and maintaining an armed conflict with the Ukrainian Government. A ceasefire stopping the shelling and pulling back heavy weapons was issued on 15 February 2015. However, on 28 February 2015, Russian-supported separatists violated the ceasefire by recommencing their shelling attacks.  Impact  Both sides (pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian troops) were blamed for the death. Petro Poroshenko, president of Ukraine, submitted a bill to parliament for the United Nations peacekeepers to monitor the ceasefire. Both government troops and separatists agreed to the continuation of withdrawing heavy weapons.

Entitled a baron (danshaku).  Biography  Arimatsu Hideyoshi was born in Mino-gun in Bizen Province as the child of a samurai named Arimatsu Masayoshi of the Okayama Domain. In 1881, after graduating from Okayama Normal School, he became a disciple of Sinologist Nishi Kiichi while teaching at Obie elementary school in Kuboya County. The book of Mutsu Munemitsu made him aspire to study Western learning in Tokyo, and asked advice from Komatsubara Eitar≈ç who also had studied with Nishi. Concerned that Arimatsu was deeply influenced by Nishi who was immersed in the Freedom and People's Rights Movement, in 1884 Komatsubara supported Arimatsu to enroll at Doitsugaku Ky≈çkai Gakk≈ç college to study German law and politics that was opened by Doitsugaku Ky≈çkai, or \\"Verein f√ºr deutsche Wissenschaften\\", founded in line with national policy in 1881. (Japanese) Doitsugaku Ky≈çkai Gakk≈ç is the foundation for the present day Gakk≈çhoujin Dokky≈ç Gakuen. The founding members of the Doitsugaku Ky≈çkai Gakk≈ç included academics Nishi Amane and Kat≈ç Hiroyuki with German Enlightenment thoughts, and politicians Inoue Kaoru, Katsura Tar≈ç, Hirata T≈çsuke and Shinagawa Yajir≈ç, as well as diplomat Aoki Sh≈´z≈ç. Professor Georg Michaelis influenced Arimatsu so much that he applied the Higher Civilian Trial in 1888 and passed as the first private college graduate. =Political career= There were five offices to which officers as a Higher Civilian like Arimatsu would be appointed; an executive civil officer, a diplomat, a consul, a judge or a public prosecutor. However Arimatsu wished to take an administrative post, he was so discouraged to be appointed in December 1888 to an assistant judge at local Mito court which performed the first trial of minor civil affair and criminal cases, The archive includes 316 articles, saved on microfiche or photographic records (Japanese): the original documents are kept at the University of Tokyo, School of Law. 109 letters including those received from Inoue Tsuyoshi, Hirata T≈çsuke and others; drafts for Newspaper Law; documentation for Police System Maintenance (Keisatsu seido Seibi kankei shiry≈ç); documents and references related to the establishment of administrative execution law (Gy≈çsei shikk≈ç-h≈ç seitei kankei shiry≈ç); autobiographies; materials for biography that he resigned in less than one month (while his resignation was not accepted but taken into the custody of Minister for Justice and handled as a leave of absence from duty). Arimatsu sought to work for politician Inoue Kaoru who was a founding member of the Doitsugaku Ky≈çkai Gakk≈ç college he graduated, and was hired as a reporter for \\"Jiji Shimp≈ç\\" (Autonomy News), a newsletter Inoue published before organzising autonomy party Jichit≈ç. Two years later, Inoue failed to found Jichit≈ç and the magazine was discontinued, when Minister of Justice granted Arimatsu an opportunity and appointed him a judge. Arimitsu's outstanding accomplishment promoted him to the post of Counsellor, Department of Justice in November 1892. As a Counsellor, he supported the government during the dispute on how it controlled the annual expenditure and Article 67, Chapter 6 of the Meiji Constitution; Imperial Diet without an agreement of the government cannot reduce or void the established annual expenditure. His deed was highly esteemed, and promoted him to Councillor of Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce in December 1892. It was in March 1893 when he held the posts of Councillor of Cabinet Legislation Bureau and Home Ministry Secretary, contributing to drafting, draft making for the Security Police Act, Administration Execution Act, Copyright Act, and Publishing Law. Left Japan for Madrid as a Japanese representative to participate in a conference on sanitation and demography in February 1893, and in May same year, assigned to join the new international conference for the welfare of the orphaned and abandoned children as a committee member. During his office at Chief of Police Bureau (1903-1904 / 1908-1911) for the first and the second Katsura Tar≈ç Cabinet, he commanded the investigation of the High Treason Incident in 1910, when police arrested socialist-anarchist K≈çtoku Sh≈´sui and others prosecuted to the death penalty. Performing the Imperial compilation, Arimatsu was administered an Imperial nominee to the House of Peers on August 24, 1911\\"Kamp≈ç\\" (Official Gazette) no. 8454, issued August 25, 1911. and with resignation from government official, enrolled the largest Parliamentary group \\"Kenky≈´kai\\", among members with wide social background including marquis, earl and baron, Imperial nominee, as well as millionaire. In the 1911 term, Arimatsu served the government from 1912 as the Minister of the Imperial Forestry Administration Agency before the Agency was reformed, then the Director of the Privy Council Clerks from April 1914. During Terauchi Cabinet, Arimatsu returned to justice administration holding posts of the 18th Director of the Legislation Bureau (1916-1918) and the Head of Cabinet Pension Bureau, and the Minister of Colonial Affairs (February‚ÄìSeptember, 1918). He finished his governmental career after holding office as the Privy Councilor from February 1920 to September 1927 at the age of 64. Retired from the political career, Arimatsu spent later years as a dedicated head of patrons for the Doitsugaku Ky≈çkai Gakk≈ç college firstly by negotiation with creditors and talked them out of the attempt to suit for seizure of the school property, and stabilized the economic status of his alma mater. Arimatsu left the government during his term as the 12th Governor of Mie Prefecture between 1904 and 1908.

Shushinski authored more than 400 articles and essays. Early life Born in Shusha, Shushinski studied the history of that town which culminated in his book Shusha published in 1968. Shushinski's father was a friend of Firidun bey Kocharli and named his son after him. In 1931, Shushinski started to take violin classes in Shusha musical school. In 1942, during World War II he volunteered for the military and participated in the Battle of Kursk under Soviet General Batov. For his military service, Shushinski was awarded the Medal \\"For Courage\\" and the Order of the Red Banner. Scholar work After the war Shushinski studied at the faculty of history of the Azerbaijan State University. Shushinski conducted research in the archives and museums of several cities in the former Soviet Union and bought at his own expense several documents of scholar interest. His first book was about Jabbar Garyaghdioglu and was published in 1964. Shushinski also researched the biographies of Azerbaijani folk musicians Sadigjan and Seyid Shushinski. After the Russian-language publication of the book Shusha, Shushinski wrote: \\"Back then, because of the hostile attitude of Armenians towards me, I was unable to travel to Shusha for three years. Everywhere on the streets stones were thrown at me. I had my doors and windows broken and the telephone wire repeatedly cut. I experienced several assassination attempts. Azerbaijanis who at that time lived in Zangibasar Raion of Armenia [...], wrote me a letter, warning that \\"a reward of 6 million rubles (now about $6 million) was announced for my head\\". The book Shusha also created a backlash in the Communist Party of Azerbaijan where Shushinski was labelled as \\"a bourgeois nationalist\\". In 1971, the book Folk Musicians of Azerbaijan by Shushinski was published, containing valuable information about virtually unknown musicians of the 18th and 20th centuries. Shushinski died in Baku at the age of 72 and according to his will, was buried in his native Karabakh region, in the town of Barda.

It was founded by Dominican friars led by Bartolom√© de las Casas, the famous social reformer.  History  = Colonial times = In 1564, the Dominican friar and social reformer Bartolom√© de las Casas and his fellow monks founded a monastery in Tecpat√°n, in what is now the Mexican State of Chiapas. Based on the architectural similarities, the Temple of Santiago is believed to have been constructed by the same builders. At the time, the church served a much smaller congregation than it could handle, and was designed in preparation for large population growth. Carlos Navarrete, an architect who worked on a Mexican government report of the church, told the Associated Press: > It was a church built thinking that this could be a great population center, > but it never achieved that. It probably never even had a dedicated priest, > only receiving visits from those from Tecpatan. Navarrete reported that the church was abandoned during the 1773‚Äì76 smallpox epidemic. He wrote about the time of the report: > At that time, we still found the wood from the chorus loft and the roof > beams. Also, a large ossuary of the victims of the plague that depopulated > the area. After its abandonment, the church was never used for ecclesiastical purposes again. = Submersion = In 1966, the Nezahualcoyotl Reservoir was completed from the construction of the Malpaso Dam, and the Temple of Santiago was completely submerged. It has reappeared periodically, at times when the reservoir water levels have dropped, the first recorded such time being in 2002. That time, the water levels were so low that the church floor was dry, and local people visited it to hold parties. In 2015, the Temple reappeared again, after water levels dropped more than 80 feet during a drought. Although this time the church was still partially submerged, local fishermen began operating boat tours to the site.

From Busch's theorem the system is necessarily disturbed by the measurement. In the literature weak measurements are also known as unsharp, fuzzy, dull, noisy, approximate, and gentle measurements. Additionally weak measurements are often confused with the distinct but related concept of the weak value.  History Weak measurements were first thought about in the context of weak continuous measurements of quantum systems (i.e. quantum filtering and quantum trajectories). The physics of continuous quantum measurements is as follows. Consider using an ancilla, e.g. a field or a current, to probe a quantum system. The interaction between the system and the probe correlates the two systems. Typically the interaction only weakly correlates the system and ancilla. (Specifically, the interaction unitary need only to be expanded to first or second order in perturbation theory.) By measuring the ancilla and then using quantum measurement theory, the state of the system conditioned on the results of the measurement can be determined. In order to obtain a strong measurement, many ancilla must be coupled and then measured. In the limit where there is a continuum of ancilla the measurement process becomes continuous in time. This process was described first by: Mensky; Belavkin; Barchielli, Lanz, Prosperi; Barchielli; Caves; Caves and Milburn. Later on Howard Carmichael and Howard M. WisemanWiseman's thesis also made important contributions to the field. The notion of a weak measurement is often misattributed to Aharonov, Albert and Vaidman. In their article they consider an example of a weak measurement (and perhaps coin the phrase \\"weak measurement\\") and use it to motivate their definition of a weak value, which they defined there for the first time.  Mathematics There is no universally accepted definition of a weak measurement. One approach is to declare a weak measurement to be a generalized measurement where some or all of the Kraus operators are close to the identity. The approach taken below is to interact two systems weakly and then measure one of them. After detailing this approach we will illustrate it with examples. =Weak interaction and ancilla coupled measurement= Consider a system that starts in the quantum state \\\\psi\\\\rangle and an ancilla that starts in the state \\\\phi\\\\rangle, the combined initial state is \\\\Psi\\\\rangle = \\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\otimes \\\\phi\\\\rangle. These two systems interact via the Hamiltonian H = A \\\\otimes B, which generates the time evolutions U(t) = \\\\exp[-ixtH] (in units where \\\\hbar = 1), where x is the \\"interaction strength\\", which has units of inverse time. Assume a fixed interaction time t = \\\\Delta t and that \\\\lambda = x \\\\Delta t is small, such that \\\\lambda^3 \\\\approx 0. A series expansion of U in \\\\lambda gives : \\\\begin{align} U &= I \\\\otimes I - i\\\\lambda H - \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\lambda^2 H^2 + O(\\\\lambda^3) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\approx I \\\\otimes I - i\\\\lambda A \\\\otimes B - \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\lambda^2 A^2 \\\\otimes B^2. \\\\end{align} Because it was only necessary to expand the unitary to a low order in perturbation theory, we call this is a weak interaction. Further, the fact that the unitary is predominately the identity operator, as \\\\lambda and \\\\lambda^2 are small, implies that the state after the interaction is not radically different from the initial state. The combined state of the system after interaction is : \\\\Psi'\\\\rangle = \\\\left(I \\\\otimes I - i\\\\lambda A \\\\otimes B - \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\lambda^2 A^2 \\\\otimes B^2\\\\right) \\\\Psi\\\\rangle. Now we perform a measurement on the ancilla to find out about the system, this is known as an ancilla-coupled measurement. We will consider measurements in a basis q\\\\rangle (on the ancilla system) such that \\\\sum_q q\\\\rangle \\\\langle q = I. The measurements action on both systems is described by the action of the projectors \\\\Pi_q = I \\\\otimes q\\\\rangle \\\\langle q on the joint state \\\\Psi'\\\\rangle. From quantum measurement theory we know the conditional state after the measurement is : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Psi_q\\\\rangle &= \\\\frac{\\\\Pi_q \\\\Psi'\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\langle\\\\Psi' \\\\Pi_q \\\\Psi'\\\\rangle}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{I \\\\langle q\\\\phi\\\\rangle - i\\\\lambda A \\\\langle q B \\\\phi\\\\rangle - \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\lambda^2 A^2 \\\\langle q B^2 \\\\phi\\\\rangle}{\\\\mathcal N} \\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\otimes q\\\\rangle, \\\\end{align} where \\\\mathcal N = \\\\sqrt{\\\\langle\\\\Psi' \\\\Pi_q \\\\Psi'\\\\rangle} is a normalization factor for the wavefunction. Notice the ancilla system state records the outcome of the measurement. The object M_q := I \\\\langle q\\\\phi\\\\rangle - i\\\\lambda A \\\\langle q B \\\\phi\\\\rangle - \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\lambda^2 A^2 \\\\langle q B^2 \\\\phi\\\\rangle is an operator on the system Hilbert space and is called a Kraus operator. With respect to the Kraus operators the post-measurement state of the combined system is : \\\\Psi_q\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{M_q \\\\psi\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\langle \\\\psiM_q^\\\\dagger M_q\\\\psi\\\\rangle}} \\\\otimes q\\\\rangle. The objects E_q = M_q^\\\\dagger M_q are elements of what is called a POVM and must obey \\\\sum_q E_q = I so that the corresponding probabilities sum to unity: \\\\sum_q \\\\Pr(q\\\\psi) = \\\\sum_q \\\\langle\\\\psi E_q \\\\psi\\\\rangle = 1. As the ancilla system is no longer correlated with the primary system, it is simply recording the outcome of the measurement, we can trace over it. Doing so gives the conditional state of the primary system alone: : \\\\psi_q\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{M_q \\\\psi\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\langle \\\\psiM_q^\\\\dagger M_q\\\\psi\\\\rangle}}, which we still label by the outcome of the measurement q. Indeed, these considerations allow one to derive a quantum trajectory. =Example Kraus operators= We will use the canonical example of Gaussian Kraus operators given by Barchielli, Lanz, Prosperi; and Caves and Milburn. Take H = x \\\\otimes p, where the position and momentum on both systems have the usual Canonical commutation relation [x, p] = i. Take the initial wavefunction of the ancilla to have a Gaussian distribution : \\\\Phi\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi\\\\sigma^2)^{1/4}} \\\\int dq' \\\\exp[-q'^2/(4\\\\sigma^2)] q'\\\\rangle. The position wavefunction of the ancilla is : \\\\Phi(q) = \\\\langle q\\\\Phi\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi\\\\sigma^2)^{1/4}} \\\\exp[-q^2/(4\\\\sigma^2)]. The Kraus operators are (compared to the discussion above, we set \\\\lambda = 1) : \\\\begin{align} M(q) &= \\\\langle q \\\\exp[-ix \\\\otimes p] \\\\Phi\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi\\\\sigma^2)^{1/4}} \\\\exp[-(q - x)^2/(4\\\\sigma^2)], \\\\end{align} while the corresponding POVM elements are : \\\\begin{align} E(q) &= M_q^\\\\dagger M_q \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi\\\\sigma^2}} \\\\exp[-(q - x)^2/(2\\\\sigma^2)], \\\\end{align} which obey \\\\int dq\\\\, E(q) = I. An alternative representation is often seen in the literature. Using the spectral representation of the position operator x = \\\\int x'dx' x'\\\\rangle \\\\langle x', we can write : \\\\begin{align} M(q) &= \\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi\\\\sigma^2)^{1/4}} \\\\int dx' \\\\exp[-(q - x')^2/(4\\\\sigma^2)] x'\\\\rangle \\\\langle x', \\\\\\\\\\\\ E(q) &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi\\\\sigma^2}} \\\\int dx' \\\\exp[-(q - x')^2/(2\\\\sigma^2)] x'\\\\rangle \\\\langle x'. \\\\end{align} Notice that \\\\lim_{\\\\sigma \\\\to 0} E(q) = x = q\\\\rangle \\\\langle x = q . That is, in a particular limit these operators limit to a strong measurement of position; for other values of \\\\sigma we refer to the measurement as finite-strength; and as \\\\sigma \\\\to \\\\infty, we say the measurement is weak. Information-gain‚Äìdisturbance tradeoff As stated above, Busch's theorem prevents a free lunch: there can be no information gain without disturbance. However, the tradeoff between information gain and disturbance has been characterized by many authors, including Fuchs and Peres; Fuchs; Fuchs and Jacobs; and Banaszek. Recently the information- gain‚Äìdisturbance tradeoff relation has been examined in the context of what is called the \\"gentle-measurement lemma\\". Applications Since the early days it has been clear that the primary use of weak measurement would be for feedback control or adaptive measurements of quantum systems. Indeed, this motivated much of Belavkin's work, and an explicit example was given by Caves and Milburn. An early application of an adaptive weak measurements was that of Dolinar's receiver, which has been realized experimentally. Another interesting application of weak measurements is to use weak measurements followed by a unitary, possibly conditional on the weak measurement result, to synthesize other generalized measurements. Wiseman and Milburn's book is a good reference for many of the modern developments.

He attended the combine and completed all of the required combine drills. Fox Sports listed him as one of their top five biggest winners from the combine and his performance was perceived well overall by scouts for his display of brute strength coupled with exceptional quickness and speed for a man of his size. On March 16, 2016, Billings participated at Baylor's Pro Day along with Corey Coleman, Shawn Oakman, Spencer Drango, Xavien Howard, Grant Campbell, LaQuan McGowan, Jimmy Landes, and seven other teammates. A record 61 team representatives and scouts from all 32 NFL teams attended Baylor's pro day, including general manager Kevin Colbert (Steelers) and head coaches Mike Tomlin (Steelers) and Bill O'Brien (Texans). Billings performed well and chose to run the 40-yard dash (4.96), 20-yard dash (2.89), 10-yard dash (1.76), short shuttle (4.78), and three-cone drill (7.74) and decreased his times from the combine in all of them. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Billings was projected to be a late-first or second round pick. He was ranked the third best defensive tackle prospect in the draft by ESPN, the sixth best defensive tackle by NFLDraftScout.com and NFL analyst Mike Mayock, and was ranked the seventh best defensive lineman by Sports Illustrated He drew major interest and was linked to the Green Bay Packers, Washington Redskins, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Minnesota Vikings. =Cincinnati Bengals= The Cincinnati Bengals selected Billings in the fourth round (122nd overall) of the 2016 NFL Draft. He was the 16th defensive tackle selected in 2016. His fall in the draft was greatly unexpected as no teams gave any indications of it prior to the draft. He was projected as a first rounder in multiple mock drafts by Pro Football Focus and NFL analysts Todd McShay and Mel Kiper Jr. There were many speculations that ranged from his lack of height and size for his position and a possible knee injury. Bengals' head coach Marvin Lewis said ‚ÄúI think his height maybe was restrictive in some ways for some people at times but we‚Äôve done pretty well these guys.‚Äù. Billings stated in regards to his fall in the draft, \\"This is something I'm going to carry with me my whole life,\\" Billings said. \\"It's actually a good thing for me.\\" He drew comparisons, by multiple media outlets, to teammate Geno Atkins and his equally unexpected slide in the draft during the 2010 NFL Draft. 2016 On May 18, 2016, the Bengals signed Billings to a four-year, $2.87 million contract that included a signing bonus of $535,845. He competed with Domata Peko, Pat Sims, and DeShawn Williams throughout training camp for the starting nose tackle position. On August 10, 2016, he was carted off the field during the Bengals' practice after suffering a knee injury. On August 15, he underwent surgery to repair a torn meniscus and was placed on injured reserve for the entirety of the season. The Cincinnati Bengals later lost another rookie (William Jackson III) for the entire . 2017 Billings competed with Pat Sims, DeShawn Williams, and Josh Tupou throughout training camp for the vacant starting nose tackle position left by the departure of Domata Peko to the Denver Broncos during free agency. Head coach Marvin Lewis named him the backup nose tackle to Pat Sims to begin the regular season. He made his professional regular season debut in the Cincinnati Bengals' season-opener against the Baltimore Ravens and recorded one solo tackle in their 20-0 loss. On November 24, 2017, Billings earned his first career start against the Tennessee Titans in place of Sims who had injured his calf the previous week. Billings recorded a season-high four combined tackles in the Bengals' 24-20 loss. Throughout the first seven games he played in 59 total defensive snaps and earned 48 defensive snaps against the Titans. =Cleveland Browns= On March 26, 2020, Billings signed with the Cleveland Browns.

In a response to a petition signed by more than 2,000 voters, the Arkansas Board of Education ordered an election to carve a new school district out of the existing Pulaski County Special School District. Jacksonville voters approved of the separation on September 16, 2014 with a vote of 3,672 for and 202 against (95% to 5%). The Arkansas Board of Education approved an order creating the Jacksonville North Pulaski School District (JNPSD) Thursday, November 13, 2014. According to the JNPSD, the district would be administered by the Pulaski County Special School District until final detachment projected for July 1, 2016. A negotiated plan to separate the JNPSD from the Pulaski County Special School District was approved by U.S. District Judge D. Price Marshall Jr. on October 14, 2015. The plan spelled out how the two school districts would split a multimillion- dollar state desegregation aid payment, assets and liabilities in anticipation of the new district beginning independent operation the on July 1 the following year.

He led a peasants' revolt in the area of Keserwan in 1859, during which he drove out the area's Maronite nobility, the feudal Khazen lords, and declared a peasants' republic. While he had a reputation as a ruffian and provocateur among members of the Maronite clergy and European consuls, Shahin became a popular figure among Christian commoners, many of whom considered him the guardian of their interests, a view which Shahin promoted. Following his victory in Keserwan, Shahin and his fighters launched intermittent raids against villages in nearby regions, such as Byblos and Matn, often in the name of defending the rights of local Christians. The assaults and their repercussions served as catalysts of the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war, particularly the battle of Beit Mery between local Maronites and Druze, in which Shahin was a principal belligerent. Although he claimed he could raise an army of 50,000 to combat the forces of the Druze feudal lords, he did not participate further in the war. Following the war's end, he was defeated by Youssef Karam in a struggle over political influence in Maronite affairs. Shahin subsequently relinquished his republic and worked in the judiciary of his home village, Rayfoun. Early life and character There are sparse biographical details available about Shahin. He was born to a poor Maronite Christian family in the village of Rayfoun in the Keserwan district of Mount Lebanon in 1815.Thompson 2013, p. 43.Makdisi 2000, p. 194. According to the historian Elizabeth Thompson, Shahin may have been literate as indicated by his early career as an artisan and an entrepreneur, while Lebanese historian Kamal Salibi describes him as \\"half-literate\\".Johnson 2001, pp. 95‚Äì96. Before leading the 1859 peasant revolt in Keserwan, Shahin was a blacksmith and a muleteer who transported goods throughout Keserwan. He became associated with the Lazarist school of Rayfoun, whose contacts there attained for him credentials from Beirut's French consulate. Shahin's letters' bearing his seal or signature may have been penned by village clergymen with whom he kept close ties. Shahin was tall and of muscular build. According to Thompson, Shahin \\"was more a man of spoken word than the pen, famous for powerful, sermon-like speeches at village meetings\\", and for his violent temper, according to Salibi. He acted as a local shaykh shabab (leader of young men), a title that carried honor and typically denoted a village strongman who derived power from his following of armed men.Johnson 2001, p. 95. He was admired and respected by the peasants of Keserwan, some of whom considered him their \\"redeemer\\". According to a local chronicler, residents \\"prepared grand receptions for him amid joy and celebrations\\" when he entered a local village. Various European diplomats described him as a \\"ruffian of despicable character\\" and as dishonest, while some clergymen also regarded him as deceitful. Anecdotal accounts gathered by writer Yusuf Mubarak indicate that Shahin's piety, including his twice-daily prayers and refusal to consume meat except on Sundays and Christian holidays. In one of his surviving letters to the clergy in the Keserwan village of Aramoun, Shahin admonishes wine and arak drinkers at Christian festivals and threatens one-month's imprisonment for drunken behavior at such festivals.Makdisi 2000, pp. 194‚Äì195. Leadership of peasants' revolt =Uprising in Keserwan= Skyline of a Keserwan village, 2019 Peasant anger in Keserwan had been building since the mid-19th century, due to a number of factors, including the burdens of corv√©e (unpaid labor for a landlord) that had been imposed during the rule of Emir Bashir Shihab II,Fawaz 1994, p. 44. general economic hardship, and the decreasing availability of land.Makdisi 2000, p. 96. The Maronite Khazen family traditionally served as the sheikhs (chiefs) of Keserwan, although their power had been significantly diminished during Emir Bashir's rule. To meet Emir Bashir's increased tax demands and finance their move to gain further control over Keserwan's silk production, the Khazens took loans from Beirut lenders and accumulated significant debts. Several became destitute in the 1830s and 1840s and Khazen influence over the Maronite Church waned. To compensate for their economic, social and political stagnation, the Khazens increased their pressure on the peasants of Keserwan in the late 1850s, while also spending extravagantly.Aytekin 2012, pp. 205‚Äì206. The Khazens opposed the creation of the \\"Double Qaimaqmate\\" in Mount Lebanon in the 1840s, which divided Mount Lebanon into Druze and Christian-run sectors, and were incensed at the appointment of a sheikh from the mixed Druze-Christian Abu'l Lama family as the qaimaqam (deputy governor) of the Maronite section of the Qaimaqamate. The Khazens feared that such an appointment would formally subordinate them to the Abu'l Lama sheikhs. Following the Abu'l Lama sheikh's death in 1854, his successor Bashir Ahmad Abu'l Lama attempted to further reduce the Khazens' influence, prompting the Khazens to stir the peasants to revolt against Bashir Ahmad. The revolt against Bashir Ahmad soon turned against the Khazen sheikhs and their feudal allies. The peasant subjects of the Khazen sheikhs had long been wary of their rule due to the excessive taxes they imposed as well as the additional gifts the peasants were virtually obligated to give the sheikhs, which many peasants considered humiliating. In early 1858, a group of peasants from Keserwan lodged a formal complaint against the Khazens to Khurshid Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Beirut. Later, in March 1858, the Khazens held a summit for the people of Keserwan to garner support for their nomination of a new qaimaqam. Instead, the peasants participating in the summit voiced their dissent against the Khazens and in October, several villages in Keserwan entered into an alliance against the Khazen sheikhs. Shahin was chosen by this alliance of peasants as their leader in December,Thompson 2013, p. 42. and was declared the wakil awwal (first delegate).Trablousi 2007, p. 30. In January 1859, Shahin intensified the armed revolt against the Khazen sheikhs and with 800 of his peasant fighters, he besieged the Khazens during a summit they were holding in Ghosta. The siege prompted the sheikhs to flee the village, and the peasants under Shahin subsequently plundered the Khazens' estates. Shahin and his men proceeded to attack the Khazens in other villages with little blood spilled in the process, with the exception of the wife and daughter of a Khazen sheikh who were killed in Ajaltoun in July during a raid on their home by the peasants.Makdisi 2000, p. 99. The Maronite patriarch, Paul Peter Massad, condemned their killing as a \\"horrific crime\\". Silk and wheat warehouses belonging to the sheikhs were plundered and the goods were redistributed among the peasants of Keserwan. By July, the Khazens had been routed and between 500 and 600 family members had fled to Beirut in an impoverished state. Shahin broadened the peasants' main demands of tax relief and refunds for the illegal payments they had previously paid to the Khazen sheikhs to also include political and legal reforms. Shahin cited the Edict of G√ºlhane, which mandated equality for all Ottoman citizens.Thompson 2013, p. 37. =Establishment of republic= Following his victory over the Khazen sheikhs, Shahin and the peasants of Keserwan formed a government, with Shahin declaring a jumhuriyya (republic). He became known as the wakil 'amm (general delegate), and in the fall of 1859 moved the headquarters of the rebellion from the coastal village of Zouk Mikael to his hometown of Rayfoun in the mountains. Although revolts were relatively commonplace in Mount Lebanon, the ousting of a noble family by their peasant subjects was unprecedented.Makdisi 2000, p. 97. Shahin's government consisted of a 100-member council made up of representatives from the villages of Keserwan. Over half of the representatives were peasants who did not own land, 32 were relatively well- to-do farmers, ten were clergymen and three were merchants or lenders. Shahin, who by this point oversaw a 1,000-strong militia, exercised power by seizing arms, ensured the upholding of the law and established security on the roads. He disciplined dissidents suspected of betraying the government and issued decrees in the name of the public. He also entered into negotiations with the Khazen sheikhs, but they reached a stalemate. The main villages that supported Shahin's government were Rayfoun, Ajaltoun, Ashqout, Qleiat and Mazraat Kfardebian. The representatives of these villages were able to gain the solidarity of other villages by persuading their inhabitants through both peaceful and coercive means that as Christians they were all a part of single community with a united purpose.Makdisi 2000, p. 98 The leaders of some villages, such as those of Ghosta, Aramoun, Ghazir and Ftuh opposed Shahin and his revolt. Shahin's popularity among the Christian peasants of Mount Lebanon grew as he came to be viewed as their savior from both the Druze nobles and the traditional Maronite elites. This reputation was further solidified after Shahin's men backed Christian residents in a clash with Druze residents in the mixed village of Beit Meri in Matn in August 1859. The Khazens demanded the restoration of their rule in Keserwan and lodged complaints to the Ottoman government about property stolen or damaged by the peasantry. The Ottomans launched an investigation in Keserwan, but in their interviews with the peasants, all claimed that they were unaware of looting and other crimes, while representatives of Shahin denied that they were rebels, insisting that they only sought the implementation of the Tanzimat reforms and the restoration of law and order. In petitions to the Maronite Patriarchate, the peasants demanded compensation by the Khazens for taxes that were illegally extorted from them, an abolition to the traditional gift-giving required of the peasants, the abolition of marriage taxes levied by the Khazens and an end to the practice of beating peasants, among other demands. Shahin nominally recognized the Maronite Patriarchate as the ultimate arbiter of disputes, but consistently urged them to honor their obligations to the \\"ahali\\" (commoners). In one incident he or his men fired shots toward the patriarch's headquarters in Bkirki for hosting a number of Khazens who were seeking refuge there.Makdisi 2000, p. 103. In March 1859, Shahin rebuffed the church's request to make an agreement with the Khazen sheikhs, citing the need to first \\"consult with all the ahali and all the villages\\".Makdisi 2000, p. 104. Shahin's rise generally confused the Ottoman government because Shahin used the Tanzimat to legitimize his revolt. The Ottomans did not consider the religious equality called for by the Tanzimat reforms to translate into class equality, which is how Shahin interpreted it. Moreover, the Ottomans did not countenance that a semi-literate Arabic-speaking peasant from a rural region such as Keserwan would serve as a representative of the Tanzimat.Makdisi 2000, p. 105. They reacted to Shahin's revolt negatively, although the provincial Ottoman authorities of Beirut generally felt powerless to act against the peasant rebels due to a lack of funds and forces on the ground. Khurshid Pasha sympathized more with the Khazen sheikhs and in a letter to the Patriarchate accused Shahin of using \\"deceit to lead astray the minds of the people and to seduce them into following his evil ways\\".Makdisi 2000, p. 106. The principal focus of the Ottoman authorities in Lebanon was containing Shahin's revolt. However, later historians of Lebanon accused Khurshid Pasha of at least tacitly supporting Shahin in order to break communal solidarity. Khurshid Pasha dispatched Emir Yusuf Ali Murad, a Maronite sheikh from the Abu'l Lama family, to rein in peasant rebels in Byblos, but Shahin sent a letter warning Emir Yusuf not to \\"intervene in the affairs\\" of Bybos because the \\"Christians of Jubail [Byblos] were united with the ahali of Keserwan\\" and claimed that \\"all the Christians of Syria have made common cause\\". He condemned Emir Yusuf for aligning himself with the ousted sheikhs and his \\"Druze relatives\\" and accused him of attempting to \\"subjugate the Christians after we achieved our [freedom]\\".Makdisi 2000, p. 107. He threatened Emir Yusuf to \\"return without delay\\" and that if he \\"desires a fight, we are more eager than you, and we are not afraid\\". Shahin's confidence in the support he received from the Christian peasantry of Keserwan and other parts of Mount Lebanon and his challenge to Emir Yusuf through a populist sectarian approach alarmed the Maronite elites, the church and the Ottoman authorities.Makdisi 2000, pp. 107‚Äì108. In response to a Maronite priest's complaints about harassment by Shia Muslims against Christians, Shahin's men attacked and plundered Shia villages and travelers in Byblos and demanded that Shia villages convert to Christianity to avoid assault. The Shia residents of Byblos protested these assaults in June 1859. While Shahin's actions further frustrated the local elites, Christian, Muslim and Druze alike, his reputation as the defender of Christian rights was bolstered at the popular level.Makdisi 2000, p. 111. Civil war in Mount Lebanon The increased assertiveness of Maronite peasants as a result of Shahin's revolt and confidence in their demographic majority in Mount Lebanon alarmed the Druze feudal lords; the latter resolved to arm their peasant fighters. Likewise, Maronite peasants, wary of growing Muslim hostility toward Christians in Ottoman Syria, were also being armed, in particular by Maronite bishop Tobia Aoun.Harris 2012, p. 157. Tensions turned into violence, and between March and May 1860, several retaliatory tit-for-tat killings and attacks of sectarian nature between Druzes and Christians occurred throughout Mount Lebanon and its immediate environs. In late May, Shahin and some 300 of his men entered the village of Naccache in the mixed Druze-Maronite Matn district to seize silk owned by a noble family of Keserwan. However, instead of returning to Rayfoun, they proceeded to enter the nearby Maronite village of Antelias. Shahin's incursion into Antelias was considered a provocation by the Druze who feared that the presence of Shahin's fighters in that village threatened the Druze residents of Matn. Many Christians in turn viewed the deployment of Khurshid Pasha's troops in Hazmiyeh on 26 May as a provocation because they suspected Khurshid Pasha of being allied with the Druze and that this was the signal for the beginning of the Druze counter-attack.Fawaz 1994, p. 50. Shahin's stated purpose for entering Antelias was to protect the Christian Shihab emirs based in the village of Baabda. The Shihab emirs requested Shahin and his men withdraw from Baabda's vicinity to avoid conflict. However, on 29 May, clashes occurred in the Matn village of Beit Mery between its Druze and Christian residents, which led to the participation of their respective coreligionists from other villages in the vicinity. By 30 May, the Druze had defeated the Keserwan fighters in Beit Meri. Fighting subsequently spread throughout Matn, with 35‚Äì40 Christian villages being burned. According to Lebanese historian Leila Tarazi Fawaz, the Keserwan fighters proved to be undisciplined and ineffective against the more experienced, unified and better organized Druze forces. The fighting in Matn spread throughout Mount Lebanon and its surrounding area, becoming a civil war mainly between the Druze and the Christians, which later spilled over into other parts of Syria. Shahin claimed that he could raise 50,000 fighters to fight the Druze,Fawaz 1994, p. 54. and Christians from areas outside of Keserwan appealed for his intervention.Fawaz 1994, p. 56. However, when his men were halted by Ottoman forces in Matn, Shahin and other Maronite militia leaders largely restricted their operations to guarding their areas of origin.Traboulsi 2007, p. 35. In mid-June, when Zahle, the last Christian stronghold, was besieged by the Druze, Shahin did not send reinforcements and the town fell.Fawaz 1994, pp. 66‚Äì67. This all but consolidated a Druze victory in Mount Lebanon.Fawaz 1994, p. 68. On 29 July, under pressure from Bishop Aoun, Shahin agreed to openly declare his obedience to the Ottoman sultan. Although the peasants' revolt had not been directly against the Ottoman state, Shahin's declaration served as a virtual repudiation of the revolt's legitimacy. In his declaration, Shahin asserted that he was forced to revolt by the treacherous \\"men of corruption\\".Makdisi 2000, p. 158. Later life and death French-led international intervention ended the civil war and order was restored by 1861.Johnson 2001, p. 43. Shahin's movement was in a precarious state in the war's aftermath; Shahin could not financially support his impoverished peasant partisans, the Maronite clergy was disillusioned with him, and Ottoman officialdom and the local nobility were arrayed against him. The Ottomans, the clergy and the nobility resolved to bring an end to Shahin's movement because it represented the last obstacle to their political reorganization of Mount Lebanon into the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate. Shahin threatened to convert to Protestantism together with his partisans if the Khazen sheikhs were restored to Keserwan,Khouri 2003, p. 43. while Patriarch Massad of the Maronite Church was prepared to excommunicate Shahin and his supporters. Shahin was defeated in battle by Youssef Karam (pictured) in March 1861. The two reconciled the following month and Shahin retired to take up a judicial post in his home village Meanwhile, Youssef Karam, a Maronite leader from Ehden who acquired a degree of popularity during the war and backing from the Maronite Patriarchate and the French government, was appointed acting qaimaqam of the Christian areas of Mount Lebanon by Fuad Pasha after the war's end.Hakim 2013, pp. 111‚Äì112. Shahin opposed Karam, who in a bid to reconcile the Maronite community, issued orders directed to the peasants of Keserwan to restore properties seized from the Khazens and compensate the latter for their losses. Shahin was backed by Emir Majid Shihab, who sought to replace Karam as qaimaqam. Tensions between Shahin and Karam in Keserwan in late March 1861 culminated in a battle between their forces in an area between Rayfoun and 'Ashqout,Hokayem 1988, pp. 389‚Äì390. in which Shahin was defeated and fled.Porath 1966, p. 152. Karam subsequently raided Shahin's home in Rayfoun, imprisoned some of Shahin's supporters and posted a number of his own troops in villages that supported Shahin's movement. Fuad Pasha advised Karam to pursue and capture Shahin, while the British consul communicated his desire to see Karam restore the Khazens to their former position in Keserwan. Shahin ultimately reconciled with Karam on 12 April under the mediation of the French general Charles de Beaufort.Hokayem 1988, p. 401. Shahin agreed to submit to the Qaimaqamate's authority without conditions. Later in 1861, Shahin relinquished the republic that he established in Keserwan. Subsequent to his retirement from politics, Shahin served as a judicial official in Rayfoun. There, in 1895, he died in relative obscurity. He left no memoirs about his role in the civil war.

The film stars Khushbu Sundar, Hariharan and Riyaz Khan in the lead roles. Music for the film was composed by Vidyasagar and the film opened to mixed reviews on 27 May 2005. Plot Aatma (Hariharan) is an international fusion singer and social activist, who protests for the emancipation of women and writes books on the subject. His latest book, Marana Sasanam, proves to be controversial and subsequently leads to him being put under house arrest. Through a flashback to visiting students, he narrates the story of the Indian village girl Jyoti (Khushbu Sundar) who marries and is then widowed in her formative years, resulting in her dropping out of education. She then marries a wealthy NRI, Shyam (Riyaz Khan), and leaves India to head to Canada. She copes well with the change in her lifestyle until she discovers that Shyam operates an illegal passport business, hence Jyoti attempts to rebel in vain against her husband. Aatma befriends her and offers her solace and subsequently Shyam suspects his wife and Aatma of having an illicit relationship. Jyothi then hears that her husband is going to blow up the CN Tower in Canada, and decides to tell the police but is killed by Shyam. The film concludes with Aatma revealing the various instances in the holy books of different religions which give woman only a secondary status and remarks about his displeasure at the current status quo. The court subsequently chooses not to ban the book. Cast * Khushbu Sundar as Jothi * Hariharan as Aatma * Riyaz Khan as Shyam * Amanda Prasow Production Singer Hariharan joined the film's cast in August 2001 and made his acting debut with the venture.

She has been listed in numerous Who's Who directories, including The Who's Who of Women, Who's Who in America, Who's Who in Politics, Outstanding Educators of America, Who's Who Among Black Americans (1981 and 1985), Who's Who in Religion, Who's Who of American Women, and Who's Who Among African Americans (1997, 2000, 2008). In 1991 she was awarded an honorary doctorate in humane letters by the Meadville Lombard Theological School. Personal She married Paul Nathaniel Graham, a rubber chemist, in 1953. They had two sons. In 1956 they moved to Yellow Springs, Ohio, where Paul Graham was employed at Vernay Laboratories. In 1962 Paul Graham was involved in a racial segregation issue with a local barber who refused to cut his hair and who was subsequently served with a cease and desist order. In 2002 she suffered a heart attack, from which she recovered. She wrote a memoir, The Life of My Times, 1925-2000. She died at her home on November 30, 2015.

She founded the Kenyan Council of Social Services and served as the head of the Sports Association for the Disabled. As the first East African female architect, she owned her own firm and is best known for her design of the Cathedral of the Holy Family in Nairobi. Biography Eugenie Dorothy Ullman was born on 26 June 1910 in London. Her parents moved to the Rift Valley town of Eldoret in Uasin Gishu County, in 1913, constructing the second building in that town. She grew up in Kenya but returned to London for schooling, attending the Architectural Association School of Architecture. She returned to Kenya and married the Kenyan Ford agent, John Hughes, who later founded Hughes Motors. Subsequently, the couple had 6 children. Hughes became a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1946. She opened an architectural firm, Hughes and Polkinghorne, designing such structures as the Golden Beach Hotel, Murangi House, the Princess Elizabeth Hospital, the Rift Valley Sports Club, and St. Mary‚Äôs school, among many others. In 1950, she was awarded Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) for her design work on the hospitals in Kenya, like the Nakuru War Memorial Hospital. Between 1950 and 1951 Hughes served as vice president of the East Africa Women's League, which was formed to promote an initiative and collect funds to address the hospital shortage in Nairobi; she subsequently served as president for the 1951-1952 term. Cathedral of the Holy Family In 1955 Hughes was elected to serve on the Nairobi City Council and was elected by the mostly Afrikaner constituency in 1956 to represent the Uasin Gishu settlers on the Legislative Council. In 1959, she was selected as the delegate to the 1960 Lancaster House Conference in London to secure Kenyan independence. Hughes lost her seat in the 1961 elections primarily because of her Catholicism and membership in the New Kenya Party. The primary was only open to white settlers, the constituency which had previously elected her was mostly non-white, and the New Kenya Party was the first multi-racial party in Kenya. After the loss of the election, Hughes turned her sights to community social welfare projects such as the Cheshire Homes for the disabled. Hughes served as vice chair of the organizing committee for the International Conference on Social Welfare held in Nairobi in July, 1974 and was a founding member of the Kenyan Council of Social Services. She also served as chair of the Kenya Sports Association for the Disabled. Hughes' most noted design work was of the Cathedral of the Holy Family which she designed in 1960. Known for its modernist style and non- figurative stained glass, the building also featured carrara marble and seating for 4,000. In addition to the main altar, there are two side altars, two halls and eight chapels. It currently serves as the headquarters of the Archdiocese of Nairobi. In the late 1960s, she designed an annex to the Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) which held a popular flying saucer-shaped nightclub known for its local benga music, as well as Afro-Caribbean calypso and soukous rhythms. The club, located in the red-light district of Nairobi on Koinange Street, went through various name changes but was locally known as the F1, Madhouse, or Maddi, until its 2014 demolition. Both of these buildings were listed by the Daily Nation in the list of top buildings in Kenya. Late in life, Hughes donated her home in M≈©thangari, in the Lavington area of Nairobi to the organization Opus Dei as the permanent home of Kibondeni College. She had worked with the members of Opus Dei for many years to establish educational opportunities for girls in Nairobi. She died on 16 August 1987 in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England and was buried in St. Austin's Cemetery, M≈©thangari, Nairobi, Kenya.

Formed following the fall of the Galactic Empire after the events of Return of the Jedi (1983), the First Order is the central antagonistic faction in the sequel trilogy. Aside from the films, the First Order appears in various related Star Wars media. In The Force Awakens, the First Order is commanded by Supreme Leader Snoke and seeks to destroy the New Republic, the Resistance, and Luke Skywalker. Snoke's apprentice, Kylo Ren, is the master of the Knights of Ren, a mysterious group of elite warriors who work with the First Order. In the 2017 sequel The Last Jedi, Ren kills Snoke and becomes the new Supreme Leader. In the 2019 film The Rise of Skywalker, the First Order allies with the Final Order, an armada of Star Destroyers built by Palpatine, who is revealed to have been secretly controlling the First Order via his puppet ruler, Snoke, prior to the latter being usurped by Ren. Depiction =Origins= According to Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary (2015) and the novel Star Wars: Aftermath trilogy by Chuck Wendig, after the Galactic Empire was defeated in Return of the Jedi at the climactic Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, thousands of worlds rose up to join the Rebel Alliance and destroy the disorganized Empire, which fell victim to warlordism. The Alliance formally reorganized itself as the New Republic, and retook the Core Worlds, including the galactic capital Coruscant. One year after Endor, the remaining Imperial Fleet made a final, massive attempt at a counter-offensive which came to a climax at the planet Jakku, the biggest battle in the war since Endor. The Imperial counter-offensive was decisively defeated. The remaining Imperial forces were pushed back to a handful of sectors on the fringe of the Outer Rim, containing only a small fraction of the galaxy's population and industrial base. These sectors were a heavily fortified final redoubt, and the New Republic deemed that they posed too small a threat to justify the high cost in life that liberating them would require. The New Republic forced the Empire to settle for the Galactic Concordance, a humiliating armistice agreement which imposed strict disarmament plans and punishing reparations on the remaining Imperials. The Aftermath trilogy establishes Imperial Admiral Rae Sloane, introduced as a captain in John Jackson Miller's 2014 novel A New Dawn, as well as Commandant Brendol Hux as the de-facto founders of the First Order, with Sloane, after achieving the rank of Grand Admiral, coining the term \\"First Order\\" as she establishes the reborn empire that will eventually take that name. She is additionally inferred as a future mentor figure for General Hux, who appears as a child in Empire's End. Over time, elements of the Imperial Remnant reorganized themselves, becoming a firmly entrenched and isolationist hermit kingdom, which spent the next three decades instigating a \\"cold war\\" against the New Republic, gradually rebuilding its military strength and secretly re-arming in violation of its armistice agreements. The vestigial Empire secretly expanded from its original few sectors (in the galactic north), aggressively pushing into the Unknown Regions (the unexplored swaths of territory in the galactic west) to seize new undeveloped worlds in order to supplement their resource base, as well as build new shipyards and industrial infrastructure far from the eyes of the New Republic. The 2016 novel Star Wars: Bloodline explained how this faction officially reorganized into the \\"First Order\\", and that this final transition only occurred about six years before The Force Awakens. By that time, the New Republic Senate had become divided into two parties: the Populists led by Leia Organa, who wanted to decentralize authority, and the Centrists, who wanted power to remain concentrated in a strong central government. Many of the Centrists were former Imperials who admired the old Empire for bringing order to the galaxy, and who feared that without strong central control the New Republic would become as weak and ineffectual as the Old Republic. Ultimately, many Centrist worlds seceded from the New Republic to reunite with the holdout Imperial remnants on the fringe of the galaxy, and formally combined into a new government called \\"the First Order\\". First Order conspirators publicly revealed that Leia was in fact the daughter of Darth Vader, severely harming her political standing among the remaining Populists.Star Wars: Bloodline The vast majority of the New Republic's worlds remained intact, but with the exodus of the Centrists its Senate became dominated by the remaining Populists, who favored decentralization and demilitarization, not confrontation. Even after these events, most in the remaining Senate were happy to see the Centrists go, feeling that the new First Order still controlled far too few sectors of the galaxy to ever pose a serious threat to galactic peace. In their view, it was easier to just let the Centrist worlds peacefully leave of their own volition and rejoin the Imperial worlds rather than fight a war to keep them by force. The new \\"First Order\\" came to be ruled by the mysterious Force-wielder known as Supreme Leader Snoke, who was secretly created by the resurrected Emperor Palpatine to control the First Order after purging its previous leadership. Through Snoke, Palpatine seduced Leia's own son Ben Solo to the dark side of the Force, who renamed himself \\"Kylo Ren\\". On his turn to the dark side, Ben/Kylo slaughtered most of his uncle Luke Skywalker's other Jedi apprentices (with the rest joining him) and destroyed his new academy. Blaming himself, Luke fled into self-imposed exile to search for the ancient first Jedi Temple. Kylo Ren, meanwhile, took on a position as Snoke's right hand within the First Order's military. With her political standing severely weakened, and the New Republic Senate gridlocked and unwilling to recognize the First Order's military buildup, Leia Organa decides to withdraw and form her own small private army, known as the Resistance, to fight the First Order within its own borders. She is joined by other members of the former Rebel Alliance such as Admiral Ackbar. Publicly the New Republic continues to disavow direct association with the Resistance to maintain plausible deniability, and though the majority of the Senate does not want to intervene against the First Order, several Senators privately channel funds and resources to the Resistance. This state of affairs continued on for the next six years until the events of The Force Awakens. Comic book writer Charles Soule, creator of the 2015 Marvel Comics series Star Wars: Poe Dameron, explained that immediately prior to the events of The Force Awakens, \\"The New Republic and the First Order are in a position of detente, and while there have been a few small skirmishes between the Resistance and the First Order, it's very much a sort of cold war.\\" =Military= The First Order's handful of sectors simply do not possess the galaxy-wide resources the old Empire used to be able to draw upon, and in addition the armistice treaties with the New Republic put strict limitations on how many ships it could physically build. Therefore, unlike the old Galactic Empire's swarm tactics, the First Order's military has had to adapt to a more \\"quality over quantity\\" philosophy, making efficient use of what few resources it has. Culturally, the Galactic Empires' Sith-influenced philosophies have been incorporated and streamlined. Its military is built upon \\"survival of the fittest\\"; if one soldier cannot fulfill their duty and dies serving the First Order, then so be it. The Order can only become stronger by culling the weak from their ranks.Resistance (Star Wars); Season 2 A major plot point in The Last Jedi is that the First Order has developed new \\"hyperspace tracking\\" technology, allowing them to continue to chase enemy vessels through hyperspace from one jump to the next (until one or the other runs out of fuel). This technology was first mentioned in passing in Rogue One as another research project the Empire was starting to develop almost forty years before. Starfleet ;Star Destroyers The First Order lacked the resources to build and crew thousands of Star Destroyers. While its fleet is a fraction of the size of the Imperial fleet at its height, on a one-for-one basis its new ships are much more powerful. In addition, they boast thirty years' worth of advances in military technologies compared to the old Empire. As a result, the First Order now deploys starships such as the new Resurgent- class Star Destroyer, nearly twice as large as the old Imperial-class Star Destroyer which it replaced as the mainstay of the First Order fleet. With a naval doctrine that accepted the renewed importance of starfighters within their overall strategy, the Resurgent-class adopted the carrier-centric designs of the Galactic Republic's Venator-class Star Destroyer. ;TIE pilot corps The First Order's TIE fighters, designated TIE/fo, are more advanced than the old Empire's TIE/ln model, and show greater concern for unit stamina and survivability. The First Order's Special Forces use a more heavily armed two-man TIE/sf variant. Visually, their color scheme is reversed from the old Imperial design: the Empire's TIE fighters have black solar panels on a light grey metal body frame, while the First Order TIE fighters have white solar panels on a dark metal frame. The Last Jedi also introduces a new starfighter element to the First Order fleet, the TIE Silencer superiority fighter. Much as TIE Interceptors were the next generation fighter starting to phase out the original Imperial TIE fighters, TIE Silencers are a next-generation fighter given only to the most elite units. Visually they somewhat resemble a cross between a TIE Interceptor and Darth Vader's TIE Advanced x1 prototype, being wider and more elongated, while boasting heavier weapons and shields to be able to face X-wings head-on. Their technical designation is \\"TIE/vn\\" (because in earlier drafts, the ship was called \\"TIE vendetta\\"). Kylo Ren pilots his own personal TIE Silencer in The Last Jedi, which he uses to assault the Resistance ship Raddus. In The Rise of Skywalker, another new TIE is introduced, the TIE Whisper. This fighter is similar to the TIE Silencer but has a spherical hull more in line with typical TIE lines. Kylo Ren uses the TIE Whisper as his personal craft in The Rise of Skywalker, using two ships in his pursuit of both Palpatine and Rey; both ships used are destroyed by Rey. ;Troop Transports For space to surface delivery, the First Order is also seen deploying several standard troop transports. Elite units and high value command personnel such as Kylo Ren use the Upsilon-class command shuttle, a stylistic evolution of the old Imperial Lambda-class T-4a shuttle (but without the third fin on top, and now sporting large wings that retract upon themselves on landing). ;Dreadnoughts The Last Jedi introduces several more ships of the First Order. Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnoughts are larger but rarer than Resurgent-class Star Destroyers, used as orbital bombardment platforms which can functionally wipe out entire planets' population centers (albeit through conventional weapons, just short of being considered superweapons). Dwarfing even these other vessels are Supreme Leader Snoke's personal flagship and mobile capital, the Mega-class Star Dreadnought Supremacy: a wing-shaped vessel wider than it is long, the size of a small country. The Supremacy measures 60 kilometers at its greatest width‚Äîequal to about 18 Resurgent-class Star Destroyers lined up end to end. Ground forces The First Order employs a quality-over-quantity philosophy with its soldiers and personnel. Unable to conscript quadrillions of soldiers to fill its Stormtrooper ranks, yet unwilling to invest huge resources in breeding a rapidly produced clone army, First Order Stormtroopers are kidnapped from their homeworlds and trained from birth, raised their entire lives for no other purpose. First Order soldiers and crews have constantly trained for combat in war games and simulations, making them much more effective one-on- one than the endless waves of Stormtrooper conscripts fielded by the old Empire. First Order Stormtroopers are regularly put through mental indoctrination and propaganda programs, to make sure that they remain fanatically loyal and never hesitate or question orders. Soldiers are not even given individual names for themselves but merely serial numbers, such as \\"FN-2187\\". First Order Stormtroopers are formally deployed in squads of ten, with the tenth spot reserved for a heavy weapons specialist as the needs of the mission require: usually a heavy gunner, but sometimes also flamethrower troops, or riot troops equipped with energy batons (which are incidentally capable of blocking a lightsaber). The design of the armour of regular and heavy gunner Stormtroopers bears significant resemblances to the design used by the Galactic Empire, such as the helmet visor, nasal filters, and overall shape. However, the filter was extended, among other practical features. According to First Order officer Captain Phasma, not even a Wookiee could crush the said armour. Some stormtroopers held high ranks‚Äîa significant improvement from the one-rank system of the Empire. These were indicated by the colour of shoulder pauldrons. In the rare instance of a stormtrooper earning the rank of Captain, they often earned a blasterproof cape. Occasionally, they modify their outfit even further‚ÄîCaptain Phasma made blasterproof, chrome copies of all her equipment and greatly improved vision modes of her helmet's visor. Captain Cardinal, the bodyguard of a First Order founding father, received almost all-red armour from his superior as a sign of trust. Introduced in The Rise of Skywalker, a new variant of troopers were introduced in the form of jet troopers, equipped with G125 projectile launchers and jet packs. The First Order also fields its own evolution of the old AT-series of armored transports, the AT-M6, used as a heavy siege weapon. Dwarfing the older AT-AT, the AT-M6 has numerous design improvements including heavy serrated cable-cutters mounted on its legs‚Äîto avoid being tripped up again like AT-AT's were at the Battle of Hoth. These cutters are positioned in such a way that the AT-M6 walks on its \\"knuckles\\" instead of the pads of its feet, which‚Äîcombined with a heavy siege cannon which gives it a hunched-over appearance‚Äîgives the AT-M6 an almost gorilla-like profile compared to the more elephant-like AT-AT. =Depictions in film= The Force Awakens (2015) In the film, the First Order is led by a mysterious figure named Snoke, who has assumed the title of Supreme Leader. Like the Empire before them, the Order commands a vast force of stormtroopers. The First Order uses regular and Special Forces versions of the Empire's venerable TIE fighter. Its primary base of operations is Starkiller Base, a mobile ice planet which converted into a superweapon capable of destroying entire star systems across the galaxy by firing through hyperspace. The base commander of Starkiller is General Hux, a ruthless young officer dedicated to the Order. Snoke is a powerful figure in the dark side of the Force and has corrupted Ben, the son of Han Solo and Leia Organa who had been an apprentice to his uncle, the Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. Masked and using the name Kylo Ren, he is one of Snoke's enforcers, much like his grandfather Darth Vader had been the enforcer of Emperor Palpatine during the days of the Empire decades earlier. Kylo is the master of the Knights of Ren, a mysterious group of elite warriors who work with the First Order. Kylo and Hux are rivals for Snoke's approval, and the third member of the \\"commanding triumvirate\\" of the First Order is the formidable Captain Phasma, the commander of the stormtroopers. Kylo is searching for Luke, who vanished some years earlier. Snoke believes that as long as Luke lives, a new generation of Jedi Knights can rise again. The First Order launches a preemptive strike on Hosnian Prime, the New Republic's current capital world (as well as Hosnian Prime's Sun and the other planets in the 'Hosnian system' (Hosnian Prime's solar system), as well as the spaceships there), by test-firing the Starkiller superweapon. This devastating first strike takes the New Republic completely by surprise, not only killing most of its leadership in the Galactic Senate, but wiping out a substantial portion of the New Republic's core military fleets. This paves the way for a resulting Blitzkrieg of the rest of the galaxy by the First Order, using the disproportionately powerful military it has rebuilt over the past three decades. Kylo fails to retrieve the map fragment that would lead him to Luke, and the Resistance manages to destroy Starkiller Base moments before it is able to fire on the Resistance base on D'Qar, though Kylo and General Hux are able to escape the explosion, as well as Captain Phasma offscreen. The Last Jedi (2017) At the start of The Last Jedi, the First Order's fleet attacks the Resistance base on the planet D'Qar. Poe Dameron rashly leads an assault against a Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought ‚Äì one of only a handful of heavy orbital bombardment platforms in the First Order fleet ‚Äì and manages to destroy it, but at the cost of the entire bomber wing of the Resistance. Kylo Ren leads an assault in his TIE silencer, destroying several Resistance fighters. First Order TIEs destroy the Resistance carrier ship, wiping out the Resistance leadership. General Leia survives but is incapacitated. Vice Admiral Holdo assumes control of the Resistance fleet while Leia recovers. The First Order tracks the small Resistance fleet via a hyperspace jump using new \\"hyperspace tracking\\" technology. Running low on fuel, the remaining Resistance fleet is pursued by the First Order. This devolves into a siege- like battle of attrition, as one by one the smaller Resistance ships run out of fuel and are destroyed by the pursuing First Order fleet. Finn and a Resistance mechanic, Rose, embark on a mission to disable the First Order's tracking device. Meanwhile, Kylo Ren kills Snoke, replacing him as Supreme Leader of the First Order. Poe Dameron stages a mutiny against Holdo, believing her inept and without a plan. Holdo reveals, however, that she didn't trust Poe with her plan due to his reckless assault on the dreadnought. The plan is for the Resistance to flee in cloaked shuttles to an old Rebel Alliance base on the planet Crait, while Holdo remains on the Resistance command ship. The First Order discover the ruse, however, destroying most of the shuttlecraft. Finn and Rose locate the tracking device but are captured by Captain Phasma. Holdo sacrifices herself by directing the Resistance command ship to lightspeed jump directly into Snoke's flagship, destroying much of the First Order fleet in the process. Finn manages to kill Captain Phasma and escape with Rose to Crait. The First Order blast the door of the Rebel base with miniaturized Death Star technology. Leia sends out transmissions to allies \\"in the Outer Rim\\" begging for aid, but they inexplicably do not appear. Just as the First Order breaches the base, Luke Skywalker appears to challenge them. A full barrage by their artillery has no effect on Luke, so Kylo Ren descends to duel him in person. Ren realizes that Luke is a Force projection; while Ren is distracted, the surviving Resistance escape the planet. The Rise of Skywalker (2019) The Rise of Skywalker takes place a year after The Last Jedi. The First Order is now led by Supreme Leader Kylo Ren after Snoke‚Äôs death. Allegiant General Pryde, who served Palpatine in the Empire, has now joined General Hux at the top of the military hierarchy. Kylo Ren discovers a physically impaired Palpatine in exile on the Sith world Exegol. Palpatine reveals he created Snoke as a puppet to control the First Order and has built a massive armada of Xyston-class Star Destroyers, the Final Order. In a bid to form a new Sith Empire, Palpatine promises Kylo control over the fleet on the condition that he find and kill Rey, who is revealed to be Palpatine's granddaughter. Kylo begins to scour the galaxy for Rey. The Resistance acquires information on Palpatine's location and embarks on a quest to find Exegol. Hux is revealed to have been a spy inside the First Order, due to his contempt for Kylo Ren; he is found out by Pryde and executed for treason. Rey confronts Kylo Ren on Kef Bir at the wreckage of the second Death Star. She impales Kylo after he is distracted by Leia calling out to him through the Force. Rey heals Kylo and flees. Afterwards, Kylo sees a vision of his father, Han Solo, through a memory. This causes Kylo to abandon the dark side, and reclaim his identity as Ben Solo. Palpatine tells Pryde to obliterate Kijimi as a show of force and orders him to come to Exegol, effectively making Pryde leader of the First Order. After encouragement from the spirit of Luke Skywalker, Rey uses his T-65B X-wing to travel to Exegol and leads the Resistance there too. Finn and Poe engage the Sith Eternal forces while Rey confronts Palpatine himself. Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca arrive with reinforcements from across the galaxy, and they manage to defeat the Sith Eternal forces. With help from Ben and the spirits of past Jedi, Rey finally destroys Palpatine for good. The galaxy rises up against the First Order, ultimately defeating it after 30 years of its existence.

Built to protect Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito and up to 350 members of his inner circle in the event of an atomic conflict, the structure is made up of residential areas, conference rooms, offices, strategic planning rooms, and other areas. The bunker remained a state secret until after the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.http://wondersofnaturewith.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/objekat-d0-konjic.html History In 1953, as the Cold War was heating up, President Tito directed the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) to begin work on the ARK bunker. In the event of nuclear war, the complex was designed to function as a center of military operations and a shelter for both the Supreme Command staff and Tito, along with his family and close associates. Its construction and existence were among the most closely guarded Yugoslav military secrets of the time and remained so until the 1990s, when the ARK was revealed to the public. In 1979, when work was completed after 26 years and $4.6 billion in construction costs (equal to $26 billion in today's currencyhttp://stojnic.co.uk/TitoBunker/), the facility was handed over to a JNA detachment of 16 military personnel (by ethnicity: 9 Serbs, 4 Bosniaks, and 3 Croats) tasked with maintaining the structure, should the need ever arise. After Tito's death in 1980, the complex was mothballed but kept ready in case of war. In March 1992, during the breakup of Yugoslavia, the JNA ordered its demolition to deny it to the separatist government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As with the nearby ≈Ωeljava Air Base, it was prepped for destruction with explosives, but the military detachment refused to carry out the order and instead surrendered the structure to the separatist Bosnian government. It was subsequently used as a supply base by Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian War, as medical supplies and equipment were in short supply. Construction Built between 1953 and 1979 inside a Zlatar hill at the southern foothill of the Bjela≈°nica Mountain, the ARK is the largest nuclear shelter, and one of the largest underground facilities, ever built in the former Yugoslavia. For over a decade after its completion, it was the most secret military installation in the country. All construction workers were carefully selected and vetted, signing a contract of silence, and all staff members held the highest security clearance. Visible from the outside of the complex are three nondescript houses, not marked on any map, surrounded by natural settings and located along the Neretva River. For nearly 50 years, the houses concealed entrances to the third largest military facility in Yugoslavia (after the underground ≈Ωeljava Air Base near Bihaƒá and the Lora naval facility in Split, Croatia). The houses consist of a control residence, a building containing secure communication links, and the facility where technical support personnel would be located. Along a corridor located in the first house, three 1.20 meter- thick metal doors protect a tunnel leading to the heart of the shelter, which is 280 meters deep and 202 meters long. The underground horseshoe-shaped structure, built to withstand a 20-kiloton nuclear blast, is divided into interconnected 12 blocks, the most important being Blocks 6 (communication), 8 (Tito's block), 9 (air filtration), 10 (fuel storage), and 11 (water storage). Designed to protect and accommodate up to 350 people for up to six months, the bunker covers an area of 6,854 m¬≤ and contains over 100 rooms, including dormitories, two large conference rooms, five operation centers with direct phone links to the Presidency, two kitchens, five large toilets, a cryptography center, cable television access, and a fully equipped hospital operating room. President Tito's residence consists of five rooms: one for his secretary and party leaders, Tito's office, his bedroom, from which one could enter the room of Yugoslav First Lady Jovanka Broz, and a relaxation room. Within the structure are 21 large systems and maintenance rooms with containers capable of holding 50 tons of oil, climate control systems, 170 cubic-meter water tanks, and running water drawn from natural wells located within the mountain. Each system was equipped with a back-up in case the primary failed. The temperature in the bunker is between 21 and 23 degrees Celsius, with humidity between 60% and 70%, representing near-optimal subterranean living conditions. The complex is lit by approximately 6,000 neon bulbs. Present Today the facility is under the authority of the Bosnian Ministry of Defense and is managed by the country's military, guarded by a five-soldier detachment., and preserved intact with all its symbols of the social, economical, political and ideological system of Socialist Yugoslavia. During the wars of the 1990s, many monuments in the former Yugoslavia were destroyed, particularly those in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ARK is therefore a unique exhibition space, a nontraditional artistic setting from both a psychological and intellectual point of view. ARK D-0 Underground Contemporary Art Biennial Project Tito's bunker now serves as a meeting point for artists from across the region, Europe, and the world. The goal of the Project Biennial of Contemporary Art is to transform a site still officially under military control into a prestigious regional cultural institution at the forefront of emerging artistic trends. The project seeks to preserve cultural heritage and a historic structure as well as to create artistic value and reestablish broken connections between artists and creative people in the region. The Council of Europe in 2011 named the project a Cultural Event of Europe, and it also enjoys strong UNESCO support. A first edition of the Biennial of Contemporary Art in 2011 brought together 44 artists from 18 countries and over 15,000 visitors. Following a second edition in 2013, the opening of the third took place on 26 April 2015, when 35 artists from 19 countries presented their exhibits. Over fifty works of art have remained on-site as permanent exhibits. The project has received financial support from Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey.

The state is one of the main producers of handcrafts, which are noted for quality. The main handcraft tradition is ceramics, which has produced a number of known ceramicists, including Jorge Wilmot, who introduced high fire work into the state. In addition to ceramics, the state also makes blown glass, textiles (including serapes), wood furniture including the equipal chair, baskets, metal items, piteado and Huichol art. Status Jalisco is one of Mexico's main producers of handcrafts and folk art, along with Michoac√°n and Oaxaca. It produces a large quantity and wide variety, with a number of traditions noted for their quality. Most of these are made and sold in the area in and around the state capital of Guadalajara, which is the main focus of commerce for western Mexico. In addition, to providing jobs directly, the manufacture and sales of handcrafts is an important component of the state's tourism industry. The state's oldest craft traditions extend to the pre Hispanic period and many of the traditional designs and forms seen today were developed during the colonial period. However, their modern standing is mostly due to the efforts of Jorge Wilmot, who moved to Tonal√° in the 1950s after studying ceramics in Europe and Asia. Here and in neighboring Tlaquepaque, he introduced modern ceramic techniques, especially high-fire stoneware. He expanded the area's production from pots and jars to complete dish sets, large vases, mosaics and tiles and more. For his work, Wilmot was awarded Mexico National Prize in Arts and Sciences in 1997. Wilmot's efforts were followed up by state government efforts to preserve and promote Jalisco craft traditions. Tlaquepaque is home to the Regional Museum for Ceramics, founded in 1964 by the Patronato de Artes e Industrias Populares (Board for Folk Arts and Industries) under then governor Agust√≠n Ya√±ez. The museum exhibits the best examples of the state's ceramics. In 1965, Jalisco was one of the first states to organize a state institution, the Instituto de Artesan√≠a Jaliscence, to do research into handcrafts, organize its craftsmen and market state goods. The institution began as the Casa de las Artesan√≠as, built in the 1960s, along with a number of other public works projects. About 75,000 artisans are active with the Instituto Jaliscense de Artesanias. However, about half of these are over age sixty and those under thirty are declining these vocations. The main reason for this is economic, as most artisans made subsistence wages, lower than most other occupations. In addition, Jalisco handcrafts face competition from imported imitations, primarily from Asia. One area which is particularly susceptible is the market for nativity scenes, and religious figures. The state looks to preserve crafts, registering artisans for research purposes as well as for grants and other assistance, especially to younger artisans. This assistance include primary materials, equipment, training and marketing. The state sponsors events such as \\"Jalisco es Artesania\\" (Jalisco is Handcrafts) to promote the crafts produced in sixty municipalities in all of the state's regions, as part of efforts to improve the economy of rural areas in particular. Handcraft traditions =Ceramics= Jalisco's most important handcraft is ceramics, which has a national reputation. It produces a wide variety of pieces both decorative and utilitarian including tiles, bathroom fixtures, vases, dishes, storage containers, bottles, jars, platters, figurines, pots and vats. Most of the state's production is in the Atemajac Valley, especially the towns of Tlaquepaque and Tonal√°, which produce some of the most distinctive pottery techniques and decorative styles in the country. The most traditional of this pottery dates from the colonial period. Bandera is named for the red and white, sometimes with green painted decorative motifs, the colors of the Mexican flag. It is a speciality of Tonal√°. Canelo is named for its cinnamon color. It is porous and often used for water jugs as it keeps liquids cool. Betus is a glazed, double-fired ware, characterized by the use of \\"betus\\" oil, derived from pine resin. Its production is mostly based in Tonal√° and Santa Cruz de las Huertas. It is mostly used for making figurines of both animals and humans. Bru√±ido, also a speciality of Tonal√°, is one of the state's oldest techniques, named after the burnishing done for its shine rather than glazing. It is made with a mix of black and white clays and often painted with images of deer and flowers. Related to this is petatillo, which is burnished pottery distinguished by the use of fine cross hatching in areas not painted with images, commonly animals and plants. Two other traditional pottery styles include \\"de lumber,\\" a simple pottery used for making cooking pots and such and \\"de matiz,\\" which is a creamy what with decorations painted in black, red or green, often used to make figures from Mexico's history. More recent additions to Jalisco's current pottery production include maiolica style pottery, often black, white or green, with little or no decoration along with high-fire pieces such as kaolin and stoneware. This advanced pottery was introduced in the mid 20th century and is principally produced in Tlaquepaque and Tonal√°. The state's long history of fine pottery production has resulted in a number of highly notable ceramicists. The Pablo Jim√≥n family is noted for bru√±ido work, especially jars and \\"pomegranate\\" pieces. Amado Galvan makes bru√±ido jars, animal figures, and large vats. =Wood= Wood is worked in varied communities to make a variety of wares, which include furniture, toys and cooking utensils. The most common item is furniture of various types. The best known furniture piece produced in the state is the equipal chair, which are round made with strips of wood and backs and seats of leather. This chair has become common in Mexican restaurants in Mexico and the United States, as well as popular for gardens and terraces. The main center for their production is Zocoalco de Torres, where numerous families make them. They were originally ceremonial chairs, reserved for priests and the upper classes. The wood is from a tree called the palo dulce, with sections sliced with a curved machete and arranged to form the based and supports. The seat and sometimes other parts of the chair are made or covered with leather. These are usually placed around a round table. Another producer is Jalostoltitl√°n, noted for its marquetry work to make furniture and lamps of high quality. However, production has diminished since it depends on sabina wood, which has become scarce. Teocaltiche is known for the production of small wood items, especially lathe-turned pieces, including miniatures, toys, and cooking utensils, especially molinillos, a beater used to make froth in hot chocolate. =Textiles= Textiles are mostly done in cotton. Embroidered and drawn-work pieces can be found in various parts of the state, including Lagos, San Juan de los Lagos and Encarnaci√≥n de D√≠az. Although the most common kind of Mexican serape is associated with the city of Saltillo, Coahuila, the state of Jalisco has laid claim as the originator, with several variations. Encarnaci√≥n de D√≠az has claimed to be the originator of the \\"Saltillo\\" serape, more so Teocaltiche, which claims it has been made there since the 18th century and has sought denominaci√≥n de origen. In reality, genuine versions of this sarape are difficult to fine as it requires fine raw material and a delicate weaving technique. Other serapes styles made in the state include a wool one made in Ajijic, those made in Jocotepec and a style called jorongo in Talpa. Other handcrafted clothing items include rebozos in silk, sashes, shirts and aprons called chincuetes or tilmas, especially in Tlaquepaque, Tonal√°, Lagos de Moreno, Tuxpan and along the shore of Lake Chapala. The Huichols in the north of the state are noted for their embroidery. =Others= Glass being heated for blowing at Cristacolor in Tonal√° Blown glass has been an important industry in the state since the early 20th century, especially in Tonal√° and Tlaquepaque. Initially, it was developed to make bottles for the tequila industry. Since then, it has developed into the making of various utilitarian and decorative objects, using a variety of techniques. Traditional colors for glass pieces include cobalt blue, amethyst and green. Blown glass remains true to traditional forms as well as division of labor, with workshops having apprentices and workers under a master craftsman. However more modern setups have come into play since the mid 20th century, when Jose Camarasa began to manufacture glass prisms for light fixtures and lamps in Tlaquepaque. He also makes ornamental and utilitarian pieces of lead crystal, with the red pieces particularly prized. Tin items in Tonal√° Metals include iron, gold, tin, copper, and silver to make fine and everyday objects. Tin is worked from sheets to make decorative objects such as mirror frames and Christmas decorations. Wrought iron is principally worked in Guadalajara, and in Sayuda where they make knives, blades and machetes and is home to the Knife Museum. Silver is worked into jewelry (earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, etc.) in Guadalajara, which is one of Mexico's main centers for this work. Pewter is worked into bowls, plates, frames and more. Part of the Huichol region lies in Jalisco, and crafts associated with this ethnic group are found in the state. Originally, they were votive in nature but a number of techniques have been adapted to making of commercial items. These include yarn paintings and the making of god's eyes, as well as pieces decorated with fine beads. These commercial pieces range from those with traditional imagery to those incorporating more modern motifs. Bola√±os sponsored the creation of a seven-meter deer sculpture inlaid with beads in the Huichol style. As Jalisco is noted for charros, the working of leather and a decorative technique called piteado are important. Leather is produced from cattle, sheep skin and formed into belts, boots, huaraches (especially in Concepci√≥n de Buenos Aires), other shoes, bags, whips, chaps, saddles and more. Many of these pieces decorated with piteado, a kind of embroidery using tough ixtle fiber. The town of Colotl√°n is particularly noted for its piteado. Stonework is principally done in pink sandstone (cantera) in the Los Altos region. In this region, many of the public buildings such as churches have decorative elements such as columns, fountains and more done in this stone. It is also used to make tables, other furniture pieces, religious figures and more. Basketry is still done in the Lake Chalapa region, where the lake is still a source of reeds and rushes. Other materials used include willow branches and palm fronds to make baskets, mats, hats, rope and more. Towns noted for this work include Jocotepec, Encarnaci√≥n de D√≠az, Usmajac Gomez Farias, Zapotitlan, Tocolotlan, Cuquio, Zapotlan, Barra de Navidad and San Miguel Cyutlan. Masks are made in various parts of the state and in various materials, traditionally connected with ceremonial dances such as the mecos or Apaches in Los Altos, tastoanes in Santa Cruz de la Huertas (Tonala), diablos in Cajititlan, aguila real in Zapopan, tatachines in the north of the state and paixtles in Zapotlan el Grande and Tuxpan. Other handcrafts include cartoner√≠a (pi√±atas, masks and decorative items) made various locations, toys made in Santa Ana Acatl√°n, miniatures made in Tlaquepaque and Items made of corn husk made in Acatl√°n de Ju√°rez. Handcraft centers Most of the state's handcrafts are produced in the Atemajac Valley, in and around the state capital. These includeTlaquepaque, Tonal√°, Tateposco, San Antonio de las Huertas, El Rosario and Santa Cruz. Each has its own specialties and designs. The two main production centers are Tlaquepaque and Tonal√° which make various types of low and high-fire pottery, aluminum goods, clothing, leather, metals such as tin, iron, bronze and copper, stone, wicker, wood, cartoner√≠a, fireworks, blown glass, carved glass and gypsum. The main tradition is pottery, both glazed and unglazed, including sculpted figures which include those for nativity scenes, those of public figures such as Mexican presidents. One family particularly noted for figures is the Panduro family, which has done this for a number of generations. Not only do these towns produce, they are also the main outlets for handcrafts for the entire state, especially the finer wares. Tonal√° is home to the National Ceramics Museum, which was established by Jorge Wilmot. Silver jewelry is mostly made in Guadalajara, which is one of the most important centers for this kind of work. Outside of this area, the town of Sayula specializes in maiolica ceramics, a tradition which has been revived. The town of Talpa is home to a very local tradition of make religious images and ornamental pieces such as flowers baskets and flowers with a local gum substance called \\"chicle.\\" While colorful, they degrade quickly. Most are bought each year in connection with a feast of the Virgin Mary celebrated in the town.

Plot Alpha Trax train guard Joe Griffin (Ed Speleers) arrives at Waterloo Station in time after completing his shift on one of the passenger trains. When he is getting ready to leave, he opens his locker and finds a note in it which says that his application for the post of supervisor had been rejected. He is then confronted by his rival David, who is the new supervisor now. David tells him that he has to do a shift on one of the overnight passenger trains, which is scheduled to depart London at midnight under a full moon, because the regular train guard has taken a sick leave. Joe at first refuses, saying that he has already completed his shift but David threatens to fire him unless he does the shift. Seeing no other option, Joe agrees to do the shift. When he gets in the train and the train starts moving, he starts collecting tickets from passengers, many of whom who despise him. While he is doing this, he meets his unrequited love, the tea-trolley girl, Ellen (Holly Weston), who consoles him for being turned down for a promotion. After a lot of passengers have gotten off on the previous stations and the final station is Eastborough,. A group of passengers are left, consisting of Kate (Shauna Macdonald), Adrian (Elliot Cowan), Matthew (Amit Shah), Billy (Sam Gittens), Nina (Rosie Day), Paul (Calvin Dean) and Ged (Duncan Preston) and his wife Jenny (Ania Marson). An hour after departure, the train is travelling through a remote and forested part of the English countryside (later revealed to be the fictitious \\"Thornton Forest\\"), in a mobile communication \\"dead zone\\". Here the train is forced to undergo an emergency brake to prevent a derailment when a deer runs onto the track line. Joe checks on the passengers and assures them to be calm. The train driver Tony (Sean Pertwee) goes outside to remove the body of the deer from the undercarriage. Whilst outside, Tony gets the deer's blood on him, which attracts the attention of an unknown humanoid creature, later revealed to be one of the werewolves, who suddenly attacks Tony from the trees. He is brutally eviscerated; discarded in the woods soon afterwards. Meanwhile, the passengers inside the stranded Alpha Trax are all initially strangers, and demand that Joe get the train moving. The already strained situation is deepened when Joe discovers that Tony had not returned nor had he maintained contact. He then manages to call a radio center and tells them about the situation. He learns that it will take at least four hours before an emergency team can arrive to track them down because the center has also been facing radio signal problems due to heavy rains and the trees had fallen on the train tracks. When he tells the rest of the passengers about the situation, they abruptly start to quarrel that they can't be stuck between a forest and demand that Joe contact the nearby station. Joe tries to convince everyone to remain calm, but Adrian convinces everyone that the best choice is to disembark and walk towards the nearest station. Joe is reluctant at first, thinking that he might end up losing his job but agrees since there is no other way. Joe leads the group away from the train, telling everyone to stay together. None of them realize that they are being stalked by someone or something. While they are walking, Matthew senses that there is something nearby. Adrian assures him that it must be a deer or a rabbit. But it starts to get nearer. Jenny is convinced that it was the driver, but Matthew asks if it was the driver then why would he enter the woods. Joe and Ellen then go a little farther away to investigate and soon discover the body of Tony which is very brutally eviscerated with his organs lying around. They tell everyone to run back to the train. They all immediately rush as the howls begin. They all get inside but Jenny gets bitten by a werewolf (one of several) on her leg as they try to drag her into the safety of the train (which they are eventually able to do). The group try to help Jenny, who is in obvious and extreme pain, now having a very deep heavy wound on her leg which is cleaned with water and is bandaged. The group hears the humanoid scratching the train and then going back to the forest. They beg Joe to contact help. Nobody answers Joe's calls for help as the antenna is mysteriously damaged. Billy tells Joe that he knows everything about trains and after examining the console it is revealed that fuel lines were damaged and leaking, preventing Billy to restart the engine. Everyone sits around debating what was the actual thing that attacked and wounded Jenny. Adrian thinks that it was a bear, but Nina tells him that bears don't howl. Ellen tells them that a wolf couldn't bite that big. Matthew explains that no bears or wolves have been seen in thornton forest for centuries. Jenny tells them that it felt like it was more like a man than an animal. Suddenly, the bathroom door bangs. Everyone think that the creature might have got inside the train. Joe goes with Adrian and Billy to kill it with a fire extinguisher, but it turns out to be Paul. When Paul sits with the rest in the cabin, Kate goes to check on Nina when the werewolf attempts to get in through the door. Nina's phone begins to ring, and just as she answers it much to the group's irritation, the werewolf smashes through a window, grabbing her and dragging her through much to Kate's horror. She tries to help, but Matthew jumps in and stops her from doing so. Nina is heard screaming from the roof of the train and her blood begins to pour down a window. Everyone else rush to the next cabin and jam both of the doors. Everyone begin to panic and argue but Ged tells them that they are all just baits stuck in a train and tells them that if they keep on fighting, that creature out there is going to get them, one by one. He motivates the remaining passengers to reinforce all the windows in the cabin to help prevent further entries by the werewolves. When Jenny's condition starts to get worse (such as coughing up blood and losing her human teeth), everyone checks on her but Joe realizes that Paul is missing. He realizes that he is in the bathroom which is through a door that they have heavily reinforced. Adrian tells them that he is gone but Joe still goes to check on him. When he checks on him, Paul is still in the bathroom but gets killed by the werewolf when it gets in the train through the bathroom. Joe gets back to the others and they reinforce the door again. Unfortunately, the werewolf breaks the door, enters the cabin and terrorizes everyone. It is eventually killed by all of the other passengers fighting together. After they have killed it, they sit around to look at and debate what the thing is. Joe tells them that the creature was a man but his legs and teeth were similar to a wolf. Matthew agrees it is indeed a werewolf; a hybrid between a man and a wolf. They notice a ring on the creature's finger, indicting that it was once a human. Matt theorizes that the werewolves possess a disease or suffered a mutation that caused them to become what they are. Adrian then says that it may be caught through a bite, and they all look suspiciously at Jenny and Ged. Ged reveals that he remembers a train crash event happening in exactly the same place in 1963. When the backup team arrived, they found some of the passengers half eaten and the others missing. He says that he didn't give it much attention afterwards because he didn't know what caused such a massacre. Now, he knows what really happened during that incident, connecting the pieces of the puzzle together. Suddenly, the werewolf howls, showing that it is still alive. Joe kills it this time by bashing its head in with a fire extinguisher. But its cries manage to alert the rest of its nearby pack, who are now also drawn to the train. Jenny also starts to act strange such as beginning to growl. Adrian tells the group that she is becoming one of them and tries to kill her by strangling but gets punched in the face by Joe. He orders the others to tie both Adrian and Jenny up, also telling Kate and Ged to look after Adrian and Jenny, respectively. Billy offers to help repair the train, and is accompanied by Matthew to act as a lookout. However, he is distracted by calls for help, and wanders into the forest. There, he is confronted and killed by three werewolves just when he discovers the half eaten body of Nina (who is still barely alive and attempting to call for help) up in a tree in the process of still being eaten. Billy manages to repair the train enough so that Joe can start it. However, with the werewolves circling the train, Billy is forced to hide by pulling himself up into the undercarriage as the train starts moving. Kate is thrown out of the train by Adrian and killed by the werewolves even when she begs for mercy. While trying to hold on, Billy accidentally pulls on the fuel line, which disables the train again. Meanwhile, Jenny has almost fully transformed into a werewolf, kills Ged who still thought that she was sick, and is about to attack Adrian when she is killed by Joe. Joe furiously confronts and attacks Adrian for causing's Kate's death, to which Adrian responds that if he hadn't been tied up, she would still be alive. As the other werewolves board the train, Adrian traps Joe and Ellen in the train and jumps off, leaving them to fight for themselves. Billy arrives to help fight off the werewolves, but is soon killed as Joe and Ellen escape into the forest. With the werewolves in pursuit, Joe tells Ellen to keep running while he fights the werewolves. Ellen reluctantly and tearfully does so. Joe manages to hold them off for a brief period with a weapon until he is overpowered and apparently killed. Ellen makes it to the nearest station; walking in a daze, covered in blood, and holding Joe's tag. Adrian is now shown trapped in the forest attempting to find Eastborough station. He ultimately reached a clearing where he runs into Joe, a full fledged werewolf, who kills Adrian while the rest of the pack watch their new member claim his first kill.

Recorded at Manifest Productions Studios in Lake Forest, California, it was produced by the band's frontman Deron Miller and released by Distant Recordings on October 18, 2015. The album is the band's first to feature guitarist Kenneth Hunter, bassist Shaun Luera and Tim Luera, all of whom joined in 2014. Initially conceived as a collaboration between Miller and Canadian songwriter and producer Jonathan Masi, Galactic Prey was later re- written from scratch by Miller and recorded with members of Orange County- based production company Manifest Productions, which includes Hunter. The album's production was funded by crowd-sourced investments on the website Indiegogo. Background Deron Miller was originally inspired to produce another Foreign Objects album after being contacted by a Canadian songwriter and producer called Jon Masi, who was a fan of the group. Masi sent Miller a number of pieces of music, which the band's frontman said he \\"loved\\". The duo's idea was to collaborate on the writing and production of songs on the album, with Masi composing much of the music and Miller writing all of the lyrics. In an interview in August 2015, however, Miller stated that the material Masi produced for the album was not of a high enough quality for Galactic Prey, so he severed ties with him and rewrote the album himself. The music for the title track \\"Galactic Prey\\", written by Masi, remained. After disregarding the material written with Masi, Miller entered the Manifest Productions studio and wrote the majority of the album during recording sessions. Speaking in an interview on The Sinner's Ball radio show in August 2015, he explained that he entered the studio with no material and began playing improvised guitar riffs to the accompaniment of a click track, upon which drummer Tim Luera added drum parts and the songs were subsequently built.

According to United Nations estimates, there are about 60 million refugees and internally displaced people in the world. Proposal Refugee Nation was launched in June 2015 by Jason Buzi and received extensive media coverage in July 2015, beginning with an article in The Washington Post. In his proposal, Buzi offers a number of alternatives for creating a nation of refugees. These include: 1\\\\. Buying uninhabited islands from a country such as the Philippines or Indonesia 2\\\\. A country with a lot of habitable but unused land giving away or selling this land for the purpose of establishing a refugee nation. One example given is Finland 3\\\\. A small island nation which is sparsely populated agreeing to become a refugee nation. Current citizens would receive significant financial benefits. 4\\\\. New islands to be created in international waters as a homeland for refugees. Funding Funding for Refugee Nation is proposed to be by governments, NGOs, the United Nations or private billionaires. Jason Buzi, a successful Bay Area real estate investor, had previously earned positive press as the benefactor behind 2014's Hidden Cash multi-city project. With Refugee Nation, Buzi has drafted the initial proposal, established an online presence (www.refugeenation.org), and gained exposure for his plan through a PR agency. In October 2015, Refugee Nation launched a crowdfunding campaign with the aim of raising billions of dollars to buy land or islands as a permanent home for the world's refugees. Symbols proposed for the nation Unofficial use of the Refugee Nation flag on the 2016 Olympics Yara Said refugee flag. Syrian refugee Yara Said designed a red- orange flag resembling the life vests of Mediterranean refugees and another, Moutaz Arian, created an anthem.https://medium.com/insecurities/creating-a- flag-and-an-anthem-for-the-worlds-refugees-dedc19293ccd Although neither of those could be allowed by the International Olympic Committee for the use by the Refugee Olympic Team at the 2016 Summer Olympics, some of the supporters used the flag unofficially. Other related proposals Less than two months after the proposal received wide media coverage, Naguib Sawiris, an Egyptian billionaire, offered to buy a Mediterranean island to house refugees fleeing the Syrian conflict.

The site features a museum dedicated to the French poet Ronsard, who spent the last twenty years of his life among the Canons Regular there.  History  In 1092 the priory was founded on the site of a 7th Century oratory by a community of Augustinian Canons Regular to accommodate pilgrims on the way to the shrine of St. James of Campostela in Spain, a purpose it served up to the 18th Century. In 1187, King Henry II of England (in whose dominions it was at the time) allowed the Priory to be used as a refuge for the exiled Archbishop of Trier, Folmar of Karden, at a time when the Priory was considered \\"a heaven on earth that eased the journey to the real heaven.\\" In the 15th Century, the Priory benefitted from the generosity of King Louis XI of France who dwelt at times at the neighboring Ch√¢teau de Plessis-l√®z-Tours. He rebuilt the church and the Prior's House in the Gothic style. From 1565 to 1585 Pierre de Ronsard (the ‚ÄúPrince of Poets‚Äù) became the ‚ÄúCommendatory Prior‚Äù of the community. He lived in the Prior's House (now a museum dedicated to his life) and there received visits from Catherine de M√©dicis and her son, King Charles IX of France, as well as the future King Henry III of France and others. At his decease on the 27th of December 1585 at the age of 61 he was buried in the choir of the priory church, where his tomb was found in the 1930s. In 1742 the priory was suppressed and in part dismantled. The site was bombed during the Second World War and partly destroyed. Nothing remains but the Prior's House, the ruins of the church, and the refectory.  A Heritage Site  In 1951 the General Council of Indre-et-Loire undertook an important recovery of the area, and then opened the site to the public. From 1988 on nine gardens have been either created or restored and denominated ‚ÄúOutstanding Gardens‚Äù (). The garden at St. Cosmas is over 2 hectares in area, and boasts 200 different varieties of roses of every description in honor of Ronsard. With these are mingled an important collection of lavender, lilies, irises, peonies, and shrubs of diverse forms and varieties. The French poet and critic Daniel Leuwers chose the Priory as the site for the preservation and display of his conceptual ‚ÄúPoor Books.‚Äù From June 2009 to the end of January 2010 it was the site of important archaeological excavations. In 2011 the painter Zao Wou-Ki was invited by the General Council of Indre-et-Loire to create 14 stained glass windows for the priory refectory. In 2013, an exhibition entitled ‚ÄúEcstasies‚Äù () by the French poster artist Ernest Pignon-Ernest displayed seven posters depicting women in a state of rapture, as well as the preparatory drawings for them.
