Although the disability rights movement itself began in the 1960s, advocacy for the rights of people with disabilities started much earlier and continues to the present. 18th century *1776 ‚Äì Following the Revolutionary War, servicemen who suffered significant injuries or were unable to provide for their household were financially supported by the first pension law, which was enacted by the Continental Congress on August 26, 1776. The Continental Congress enacted the first pension law under which half pay for life or during disability was extended to every officer, soldier or sailor losing a limb in any engagement, or being so disabled in the service of the United States as to render him incapable of earning a living. The resolution allowed for proportionate relief to those who were partially disabled from earning a living. Without the power to raise money to fund the law, however, Congress was dependent on each State to execute the law. 19th century * 1817 ‚Äì The American School for the Deaf was founded in Hartford, Connecticut. This was the first school for children with disabilities anywhere in the western hemisphere. * 1840s ‚Äì The M'Naghten rule (pronounced and sometimes spelled, \\"McNaughton\\") is any variant of the 1840s jury instruction in a criminal case when there is a defense of insanity: :\\"that every man is to be presumed to be sane, and... that to establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.\\"Criminal Law ‚Äì Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012, Wolters Kluwer Law & Business; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder, , The rules so formulated as M'Naghten's Case 1843 10 C & F 200 have been a standard test for criminal liability in relation to mentally disordered defendants in common law jurisdictions ever since, with some minor adjustments. When the tests set out by the Rules are satisfied, the accused may be adjudged \\"not guilty by reason of insanity\\" or \\"guilty but insane\\" and the sentence may be a mandatory or discretionary (but usually indeterminate) period of treatment in a secure hospital facility, or otherwise at the discretion of the court (depending on the country and the offence charged) instead of a punitive disposal. The insanity defence is recognized in Australia, Canada, England and Wales, Hong Kong, India, the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, Norway and most U.S. states with the exception of Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Utah, and Vermont but not all of these jurisdictions still use the M'Naghten Rules. * 1850s ‚Äì When Illinois opened its first hospital for the mentally ill in 1851, the state legislature passed a law that within two years of its passage was amended to require a public hearing before a person could be committed against his or her will. There was one exception, however: a husband could have his wife committed without either a public hearing or her consent. * 1864 ‚Äì The U.S. Congress authorized the Columbia Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind to confer college degrees, and President Abraham Lincoln signed the bill into law. Edward Miner Gallaudet was made president of the entire corporation, including the college. It was the first college in the world established for people with disabilities and is now known as Gallaudet University. * Late 1800s ‚Äì 1970s: From the late 1800s until the 1970s, some American cities had unsightly beggar ordinances known colloquially as ugly laws. These laws deemed it illegal for \\"any person, who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself to public view.\\" * 1867 - The first American ordinance pertaining to preventing people with disabilities from appearing in public was one passed in 1867 in San Francisco, California. This ordinance had to do with the broader topic of begging. The wording in the San Francisco ordinance indicates violators will be sent to the almshouse. This connects with the Victorian Era poor law policy. * 1867 ‚Äì The first recorded arrest pertaining to ugly laws was Martin Oates in San Francisco, California in July 1867. Oates was a former Union soldier during the American Civil War. * 1867 ‚Äì In 1867, the State of Illinois passed a \\"Bill for the Protection of Personal Liberty\\" which guaranteed all people accused of insanity, including wives, had the right to a public hearing. * 1869 ‚Äì State v. Pike, 49 N.h. 399 (1869), is a criminal case which articulated a product test for an insanity defense.Insanity, 2 Encyclopedia of Crime and Justice 736‚Äì40 (1983); Abraham Goldstein The court in Durham v. United States used it as the basis for what came to be known as the Durham rule. * 1880 ‚Äì The National Association of the Deaf was founded in Cincinnati, Ohio; a non-profit for Deaf rights now headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland. * 1881 ‚Äì Portland, Oregon enacted an ugly law. * 1881 ‚Äì A Chicago ordinance of 1881 read as follows: > Any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated, or in any way deformed, so as > to be an unsightly or disgusting object, or an improper person to be allowed > in or on the streets, highways, thoroughfares, or public places in the city, > shall not therein or thereon expose himself to public view, under the > penalty of a fine of $1 for each offense (Chicago City Code 1881) The fine of $1 equates to more than $20 in 2018. * 1881‚Äì1890 ‚Äì At some time from 1881 to 1890 an ugly law was enacted in Omaha, Nebraska. * 1887 ‚Äì The graphic depiction of conditions at the Women's Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell's Island in Nellie Bly's book Ten Days in a Mad-House caused a sensation, which brought Bly lasting fame and prompted a grand jury to launch its own investigation, with Bly assisting. The jury's report resulted in an $850,000 increase in the budget of the Department of Public Charities and Corrections. The grand jury also made sure that future examinations were more thorough so that only the seriously ill went to the asylum. * 1889 ‚Äì Ugly laws were enacted in Denver, Colorado and Lincoln, Nebraska in 1889. * 1894 ‚Äì An ugly law was enacted in Columbus, Ohio in 1894. * 1891 ‚Äì An ugly law was enacted for the state of Pennsylvania in 1891. This law contained language applying to cognitive disability as well as physical disability. 1900‚Äì1939 * 1908 ‚Äì Clifford Whittingham Beers founded the \\"Connecticut Society for Mental Hygiene\\", now named Mental Health Connecticut. * 1909 ‚Äì Clifford Whittingham Beers founded the \\"National Committee for Mental Hygiene\\", now named \\"Mental Health America\\", to reform the treatment of the mentally ill. * 1910 ‚Äì State v. Strasburg, 110 P. 1020 (Wash. 1910), was a case decided by the Washington Supreme Court that held that a statute eliminating the insanity defense was unconstitutional. The court likened the exclusion of evidence of insanity to a denial of trial by jury.Bonnie, R.J. et al. Criminal Law, Second Edition. Foundation Press, New York: 2004, p. 623 * 1914 ‚Äì Schloendorff v. Society of New York Hospital, 105 N.E. 92 (N.Y. 1914), was a decision issued by the New York Court of Appeals in 1914 which established principles of informed consent and respondeat superior in United States law. * 1915 ‚Äì Harry Haiselden was the Chief Surgeon at the German-American Hospital in Chicago, and in 1915 he refused to perform needed surgery for children born with severe birth defects and allowed them to die, in an act of eugenics. Children he denied surgery included John Bollinger, the child of Mr. and Mrs. Julius Werder,Martin S. Pernick, The Black Stork: Eugenics and the Death of \\"Defective\\" Babies in American Medicine and Motion Pictures Since 1915 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 4. Haiselden was in New York on a lecture tour at the time, but authorized withholding treatment via telegram the child of William and Eva Meter, and Paul Hodzima.Martin S. Pernick, The Black Stork: Eugenics and the Death of \\"Defective\\" Babies in American Medicine and Motion Pictures Since 1915 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 4. Haiselden prescribed a narcotic to ease and speed the death of two-year-old Paul, who suffered from a constricted windpipe. Facing considerable public pressure, Paul's mother stopped administering the drugs. The boy's fate is not known. All except Paul Hodzima are known to have died due to lack of medical treatment; Paul's fate is unknown (in addition to lack of medical treatment, Haiselden prescribed a narcotic to ease and speed Paul's death, but Paul's mother stopped administering the drugs, being under pressure from the public to stop.) Eventually the Chicago Medical Society threatened Haiselden with expulsion for his decision to allow John Bollinger to die. He was acquitted by a trial jury, but eventually thrown out of practice by the Chicago Medical Board for his lecture series on eugenics and shameless promotion of The Black Stork, a 1917 silent movie that dramatized the events of the Bollinger case. * 1918 ‚Äì The Smith-Sears Veterans Rehabilitation Act became law, and provided for the promotion of vocational rehabilitation and return to civil employment of disabled persons discharged from the U.S. military. * 1920s: Psychiatrist Henry Cotton worked at Trenton State Hospital in New Jersey. He became convinced that insanity was fundamentally a toxic disorder and in the 1920s he surgically removed body parts to try to improve mental health. This often began with the removal of teeth and tonsils: > An 18 year-old girl with agitated depression successively had her upper and > lower molars extracted, a tonsillectomy, sinus drainage, treatment for an > infected cervix, removal of intestinal adhesions‚Äîall without effecting > improvement in her psychiatric condition. Then the remainder of her teeth > were removed and she was sent home, pronounced cured.Freckelton, Ian (1 > November 2005). \\"Madhouse: A Tragic Tale of Megalomania and Modern Medicine > (Book review)\\". Psychiatry, Psychology and Law. 12 (2): 435‚Äì438. Andrew Scull argues that Cotton's obsession with focal sepsis as the root cause of mental illness \\"persisted in spite of all evidence to the contrary and the frightening incidence of death and harm from the operations he initiated\\". Cotton's approach attracted some detractors, but the medical establishment of the day did not effectively renounce or discipline him. * 1924 ‚Äì The Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924 provided for compulsory sterilization of persons deemed to be \\"feeble-minded,\\" including the \\"insane, idiotic, imbecile, or epileptic.\\"HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 607 (HJ607ER), \\"Expressing the General Assembly's regret for Virginia's experience with eugenics\\", Virginia Legislative Information System This Sterilization Act was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case Buck v. Bell 274 U.S. 200 (1927). In 1979, Virginia's Assembly repealed the Act. In 2001, the legislature overwhelmingly passed a bill (HJ607ER) to express the assembly's profound regret for its role in the eugenics movement. On May 2, 2002, Governor Mark R. Warner issued a statement also expressing \\"profound regret for the commonwealth's role in the eugenics movement,\\" specifically naming Virginia's 1924 compulsory sterilization legislation, which includes though is not limited to the Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924. * 1927 ‚Äì Buck v. Bell, , is a decision of the United States Supreme Court, written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., in which the Court ruled that a state statute permitting compulsory sterilization of the unfit, including the intellectually disabled, \\"for the protection and health of the state\\" did not violate the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The decision was largely seen as an endorsement of negative eugenics‚Äîthe attempt to improve the human race by eliminating \\"defectives\\" from the gene pool. The Supreme Court has never expressly overturned Buck v. Bell. * 1931- The Pratt‚ÄìSmoot Act became law. The act provided $100,000, to be administered by the Library of Congress, to provide blind adults with books. The program, which is known as Books for the Blind, has been heavily amended and expanded over the years, and remains in place today. * 1933‚Äì1945: The White House became one of the first wheelchair-accessible government buildings in Washington when modifications were made during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who used a wheelchair because of his paralytic illness. * 1935 ‚Äì The League of the Physically Handicapped in New York City was formed in May 1935 to protest discrimination by the Works Progress Administration. * 1935 ‚Äì The Social Security Act became U.S. law; it provided federally funded old-age benefits and funds to states for assistance to blind individuals and disabled children. The Act also extended existing vocational rehabilitation programs. * 1936 ‚Äì The Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. ¬ß 107 et seq., a federal law which mandates a priority to blind persons to operate vending facilities on federal property, became law in the U.S. It was amended and updated significantly in 1974. * 1938 ‚Äì The Wagner-O'Day Act, enacted in 1938, mandated that U.S. federal agencies purchase products from workshops for the blind meeting specific qualifications. 1940s * 1940 ‚Äì The National Federation of the Blind was formed in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, by Jacobus Broek and others. They advocated for white cane laws, input by blind people for programs for blind clients and other reforms. * 1940 ‚Äì The American Federation of the Physically Handicapped, founded in 1940 by Paul Strachan, was the first cross- disability national political organization to urge an end to job discrimination, lobby for passage of related legislation, and call for a National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week, as well as other initiatives. * 1943 ‚Äì The La Follette-Barden Vocational Rehabilitation Act became law in the U.S., and it added physical rehabilitation to the goals of federally funded vocational rehabilitation programs and provided funding for certain care services. * 1945 ‚Äì PL-176 became law in the U.S., and it declared the first week in October each year would be National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week. In 1962 the word \\"physically\\" was removed to acknowledge the employment needs and contributions of individuals with all types of disabilities. In 1988, Congress expanded the week to a month (October) and changed the name to \\"National Disability Employment Awareness Month\\". * 1946 ‚Äì President Truman signed the National Mental Health Act (1946), which called for the establishment of a National Institute of Mental Health. * 1946 ‚Äì The Hill-Burton Act (also known as the Hospital Survey and Construction Act) became law in the U.S., and it authorized federal grants to states for the construction of hospitals, public centers and health facilities for rehabilitation of people with disabilities. * 1946 ‚Äì The National Mental Health Foundation was founded by American conscientious objectors from WWII who served as attendants at state mental institutions rather than serving in the war. The Foundation exposed the abusive conditions at these facilities and became an impetus toward deinstitutionalization. * 1946‚Äì1953: From 1946 to 1953, researchers from Quaker Oats Company, MIT and Harvard University carried out experiments at the Walter E. Fernald State School to determine how the minerals from cereals were metabolized. Parents of mentally challenged children were asked for permission to let their children be members of a Science Club and participate in research. Being a member of the Science Club gave the children special privileges. The parents were told that the children would be fed with a diet high in nutrients. However, they were not told (and the consent form contained no information indicating) that the food their children were fed contained radioactive calcium and iron. The information obtained from the experiments was to be used as part of an advertising campaign. The company was later sued because of the experiments. The lawsuit was settled on 31 December 1997. * 1947 ‚Äì The President's Committee on National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week was held in Washington, D.C. Publicity campaigns, coordinated by state and local committees, emphasized the competence of people with disabilities and used movie trailers, billboards, radio and television ads to convince the public that it was good business to hire the handicapped. * 1947 ‚Äì The Paralyzed Veterans of America organization was created. * 1948 ‚Äì The National Paraplegia Foundation, founded by members of the Paralyzed Veterans of America as the civilian arm of their growing movement, took a leading role in advocating for disability rights. * 1948 ‚Äì The University of Illinois at Galesburg disabled students' program was officially founded, and was directed by Timothy Nugent. The program moved to the campus at Urbana-Champaign where it became a prototype for disabled student programs and independent living centers across the country. * 1948 ‚Äì We Are Not Alone (WANA), a mental patients' self-help group, was organized at the Rockland State Hospital in Rockland County, New York. * 1949 ‚Äì Mental Health Awareness Month (also referred to as \\"Mental Health Month\\") has been observed in May in the United States since 1949. Mental Health Awareness Month was started in the United States in 1949 by the Mental Health America organization (then known as the National Association for Mental Health). 1950s * 1950 ‚Äì Mary Switzer was appointed the Director of the U.S. Office of Vocational Rehabilitation, where she emphasized independent living as a quality of life issue. * 1950 ‚Äì Social Security Amendments established a federal-state program to aid permanently and totally disabled persons in America. * 1953 ‚Äì The President‚Äôs Committee on National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week became the President‚Äôs Committee on Employment of the Physically Handicapped, a permanent organization reporting to the President and Congress. * 1954 ‚Äì Public Law 565 amended the Vocational Rehabilitation Act; specifically, it increased the 50‚Äì50 matched funding from the federal government to 3 federal dollars for every 2 state dollars, and expanded services to those with intellectual disabilities. * 1954 ‚Äì Mary Switzer, Director of the U.S. Office of Vocational Rehabilitation, authorized funds for more than 100 university-based rehabilitation-related programs. * 1954 ‚Äì The Social Security Act of 1935 was amended by PL 83-761 to include a freeze provision for workers who were forced by disability to leave the workforce. This protected their benefits by freezing their retirement benefits at their pre-disability level. * 1954 ‚Äì Durham v. United States, 214 F.2d 862 (D.C. Cir. 1954), is a criminal case articulating what became known as the Durham rule for juries to find a defendant is not guilty by reason of insanity, that \\"an accused is not criminally responsible if his unlawful act was the product of mental disease or mental defect\\". It was to enable psychiatrists to \\"inform the jury of the character of [the defendant's mental disease\\" so that a jury could be \\"guided by wider horizons of knowledge concerning mental life\\"; so that juries could make determinations based on expert testimony about the disease.Insanity, Encyclopedia of Crime and Justice, 1983; Abraham Goldstein; pp736-40 It was patterned on State v. Pike. It was adopted by only two states, for a short time, but has and continues to be influential on debate over legal insanity. The decision was criticized for leaving a jury with no standard to judge impairment of reason or control, did not define mental disease, and left the jury dependent on expert testimony. * 1956 ‚Äì The Social Security Amendments of 1956 created the Social Security Disability (SSDI) program for disabled workers aged 50 to 64 in America. * 1956 ‚Äì The Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act of 1956 (Public Law 84-830) was an Act of Congress passed to improve mental health care in the United States territory of Alaska. The Act succeeded in its initial aim of establishing a mental health care system for Alaska, funded by income from lands allocated to a mental health trust. However, during the 1970s and early 1980s, Alaskan politicians systematically stripped the trust of its lands, transferring the most valuable land to private individuals and state agencies. The asset stripping was eventually ruled to be illegal following several years of litigation, and a reconstituted mental health trust was established in the mid-1980s. * 1958 ‚Äì The Social Security Amendments of 1958 extended Social Security Disability benefits to dependents of disabled workers in America. * 1958 ‚Äì PL 85-905, which authorized loan services for captioned films for the deaf, became law in the U.S. * 1958 ‚Äì PL 85-926, which provided federal support for training teachers for children with mental retardation, became law in the U.S. * 1958 ‚Äì The Rehabilitation Gazette (formerly known as the Toomeyville Gazette), edited by Gini Laurie, was founded. It was an American grassroots publication which became an early voice for disability rights, independent living, and cross- disability organizing. It featured articles by writers with disabilities. 1960s * 1960 ‚Äì The National Association for Down Syndrome (originally incorporated as the Mongoloid Development Council), the oldest Down syndrome parent organization in the States, was founded by Kathryn McGee, whose daughter Tricia had Down syndrome. * 1960 ‚Äì The Social Security Amendments of 1960 eliminated the restriction that disabled workers receiving Social Security Disability benefits must be 50 or older. * 1960 ‚Äì Morton Birnbaum's seminal paper on \\"The Right To Treatment\\" appeared in 1960 in the American Bar Association Journal, marking the first published use of the term sanism in reference to the mentally ill. * 1960 ‚Äì Dusky v. United States, , was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court affirmed a defendant's right to have a competency evaluation before proceeding to trial. This case set the current standard for adjudicative competence in the United States. Although the statutes addressing competency vary from state to state in the United States, the two elements outlined in the Dusky v. United States decision are held in common: The defendant must understand the charges against him or her and must have the ability to aid his or her attorney in his or her own defense, although see Felthous (2011), who argues that many state statutes‚Äîand the federal statute‚Äîdo not incorporate the rationality standard enunciated in Dusky). * 1961 ‚Äì U.S. President John F. Kennedy appointed a President‚Äôs Panel on Mental Retardation. * 1961 ‚Äì The American National Standard Institute, Inc. (ANSI) published American Standard Specifications for Making Buildings Accessible to, and Usable by, the Physically Handicapped (the A117.1 Barrier Free Standard). This landmark document, produced by the University of Illinois, became the basis for subsequent architectural access codes. * 1962 ‚Äì The President‚Äôs Committee on Employment of the Physically Handicapped was renamed the President‚Äôs Committee on Employment of the Handicapped, reflecting increased interest in employment issues affecting people with cognitive disabilities and mental illness. * 1962 ‚Äì Edward Roberts successfully sued to gain admission to the University of California, Berkeley, making him the first student with severe disabilities to attend that school. * 1963 ‚Äì Public Law 88-164, also called the Community Mental Health Act, became law in the U.S., and it authorized funding for developmental research centers in university affiliated facilities and community facilities for people with mental retardation; it was the first federal law directed to help people with developmental disabilities. * 1963 ‚Äì U.S. President John F. Kennedy called for a reduction \\"over a number of years and by hundreds of thousands, (in the number) of persons confined\\" to residential institutions and asked that methods be found \\"to retain in and return to the community the mentally ill and mentally retarded, and thereto restore and revitalize their lives through better health programs and strengthened educational and rehabilitation services.\\" This resulted in deinstitutionalization and increased community services. * 1963 ‚Äì South Carolina passed the first statewide architectural access code in America. * 1964 ‚Äì On October 6, 1964, a joint resolution of the U.S. Congress, was signed into law as , and codified at . This resolution authorized the President of the United States to proclaim October 15 of each year as \\"White Cane Safety Day\\". President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the first White Cane Safety Day proclamation within hours of the passage of the joint resolution. * 1965 ‚Äì Medicare and Medicaid were established through passage of the Social Security Amendments of 1965, providing federally subsidized health care to disabled and elderly Americans covered by the Social Security program. These amendments changed the definition of disability under Social Security Disability program from \\"of long continued and indefinite duration\\" to \\"expected to last for not less than 12 months.\\" * 1965 ‚Äì The Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1965 were passed authorizing federal funds for construction of rehabilitation centers, expansion of existing vocational rehabilitation programs and the creation of the National Commission on Architectural Barriers to Rehabilitation of the Handicapped. * 1965 ‚Äì The National Technical Institute for the Deaf at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York, was established by the U.S. Congress. * 1965 ‚Äì The Voting Rights Act of 1965 became law in the U.S., and in addition to providing sweeping protections for minority voting rights, it allowed those with various disabilities to receive assistance \\"by a person of the voter's choice\\", as long as that person was not the disabled voter's boss or union agent. * 1966 ‚Äì In Pate v. Robinson, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that a hearing about competency to stand trial is required under the due process clause of the Constitution of the United States. * 1966 ‚Äì In Rouse v. Cameron, 373 F.2d 451 (D.C. Cir. 1966), Charles Rouse had been tried for carrying a weapon without a license, and was found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed without a hearing to St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, D.C. The maximum sentence was one year on the criminal charge. Years later, still in the hospital, Rouse filed a petition for habeas corpus challenging his confinement. Judge David Bazelon, writing for the court in Rouse, became the first appellate judge to say that civilly committed mental patients had a \\"right to treatment.\\" * 1966 ‚Äì The President‚Äôs Committee on Mental Retardation was established by U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. * 1966 ‚Äì \\"Christmas in Purgatory,\\" by Burton Blatt and Fred Kaplan, was published; it documented conditions at American state institutions for people with developmental disabilities. * 1967 ‚Äì The Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, often abbreviated LPS, (Cal. Welf & Inst. Code, sec. 5000 et seq.) was signed into law by then-governor of California Ronald Reagan (although it only went into full effect on July 1, 1972.) The Act in effect ended all hospital commitments by the judiciary system in California, except in the case of criminal sentencing, e.g., convicted sexual offenders, and those who are \\"gravely disabled\\", defined as unable to obtain food, clothing, or housing [Conservatorship of Susan T., 8 Cal. 4th 1005 (1994)]. It did not, however, impede the right of voluntary commitment. It also expanded the evaluative power of psychiatrists and created provisions and criteria for holds. This Act set the precedent for modern mental health commitment procedures in the United States. * 1967 ‚Äì The Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution dealing with issues related to presidential succession and disability is ratified. It clarifies that the vice president becomes president (as opposed to acting president) if the president dies, resigns, or is removed from office; and establishes procedures for filling a vacancy in the office of the vice president and for responding to presidential disabilities. The Twenty- fifth Amendment was submitted to the states on July 6, 1965, by the 89th Congress and was adopted on February 10, 1967. * 1968 ‚Äì The Architectural Barriers Act became law in the U.S., and required all federally owned or leased buildings to be accessible to disabled people. Among other things, it required provision of disabled-access toilet facilities. * 1968 ‚Äì The California legislature guaranteed that the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) would be the first rapid transit system in the U.S. to accommodate wheelchair users. * 1969 ‚Äì Wolf Wolfensberger's seminal work The Origin and Nature of Our Institutional Models was published. This book posited that society characterizes people with disabilities as deviant, sub-human and burdens of charity, resulting in the adoption of that \\"deviant\\" role. * Before the 1970s ‚Äì Before the 1970s, several US states had banned the procedure of lobotomy.Wood, Jeffrey C.; Wood, Minnie. Therapy 101: A Brief Look at Modern Psychotherapy Techniques & How They Can Help. New Harbinger Publications; 2008. . 1970s * 1970 ‚Äì The Urban Mass Transportation Act became law, and it required all new American mass transit vehicles be equipped with wheelchair lifts. APTA delayed implementation for 20 years. Regulations were finally issued in 1990. * 1970 ‚Äì Disabled in Action was founded by Judith Heumann and her friends Denise McQuade, Bobbi Linn, Frieda Tankas, Fred Francis, Pat Figueroa, possibly Larry Weissberger, Susan Marcus, Jimmy Lynch and Roni Stier (all of whom were disabled). A number of chapters were also started in various other American cities. * 1970 ‚Äì The American Association for the Abolition of Involuntary Mental Hospitalization (AAAIMH) was an organization founded in 1970 by Thomas Szasz, George Alexander, and Erving Goffman for the purpose of abolishing involuntary psychiatric intervention, particularly involuntary commitment, against individuals. The founding of the AAAIMH was announced by Szasz in 1971 in the American Journal of Public Health and American Journal of Psychiatry. The association provided legal help to psychiatric patients and published a journal, The Abolitionist. The organization was dissolved in 1980. * 1970 ‚Äì The Rolling Quads organization was started by Edward Roberts at UC Berkeley in California. * 1970 ‚Äì Developmental Disabilities Services and Facilities Construction Amendments became law in the U.S. These Amendments contained the first legal definition of developmental disabilities. They also authorized grants for services and facilities for the rehabilitation of people with developmental disabilities and state DD Councils. * 1970 ‚Äì The Physically Disabled Students Program (PDSP) was founded by Edward Roberts, John Hessler, Hale Zukas, and others at UC Berkeley. With its focus on community living, political advocacy and personal assistance services, it became the nucleus for the first Center for Independent Living, founded in 1972. * 1971 ‚Äì The Javits‚ÄìWagner‚ÄìO'Day Act, 41 U.S.C. ¬ß 46 et seq., a U.S. federal law requiring that all federal agencies purchase specified supplies and services from nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other significant disabilities, was passed by the 92nd United States Congress in 1971. It was an expansion of the Wagner-O'Day Act of 1938 (see above). * 1971 ‚Äì The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) published American Standard Specifications for Making Buildings Accessible to, and Usable by, the Physically Handicapped (the A117.1 Barrier Free Standard). This landmark document, produced by the University of Illinois, became the basis for subsequent architectural access codes. * 1971 ‚Äì The National Center for Law and the Handicapped was founded at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana. It became the first legal advocacy center for people with disabilities in the U. S. * 1971 ‚Äì The U.S. District Court, Middle District of Alabama, decided in Wyatt v. Stickney that people in residential state schools and institutions had a constitutional right ‚Äúto receive such individual treatment as (would) give them a realistic opportunity to be cured or to improve his or her mental condition.‚Äù Disabled people were no longer to be locked away in custodial institutions without treatment or education. * 1971 ‚Äì The Mental Patients‚Äô Liberation Project was initiated in New York City. * 1971 ‚Äì The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 was amended to bring people with disabilities (other than blindness) into the sheltered workshop system. * 1971 ‚Äì Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389 (1971),. was a case heard by the United States Supreme Court to determine and delineate several questions concerning administrative procedure in Social Security disability cases. In the case the Supreme Court ruled that: 1.) Written reports submitted by physicians in the treatment and evaluation of patients are admissible, and should be considered substantial evidence in disability hearings under the Social Security Act, even though by their nature, they are ‚Äòhearsay.‚Äù 2.) Hearsay evidence is admissible up to the point of relevancy in such hearings. 3.) Subpoena of witnesses is within the jurisdiction and allowable under the rules of procedure in Social Security disability hearings. 4.) Reliance on ‚Äústacked hearsay‚Äù ‚Äì where written records are reviewed by others who have not examined the patient, but issue reports based on their review, which then are followed by more generation of reports by individuals who have reviewed the record ‚Äì should be discouraged. 5.) It is within the jurisdiction of administrative law judges to hire outside case consultants or advisors to review the issues of the case and offer reports and testimony in the furtherance of resolution. This is a practice that is advisable, in particular in those cases where the medical records and testimony are conflicting, or the medical issues are not clear. 6.) The Social Security Act is to be interpreted liberally in favor of the claimant. 7.) Social Security disability is different from welfare entitlements and does not require the same level of due process protections under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution as the court delineated in Goldberg v. Kelly.397 U.S. 254 (1970) * 1971 ‚Äì The Florida Mental Health Act of 1971 (Florida Statute 394.451‚Äì394.47891 (2009 rev.)), commonly known as the \\"Baker Act,\\" allows the involuntary institutionalization and examination of an individual in Florida. The Baker Act allows for involuntary examination (what some call emergency or involuntary commitment). It can be initiated by judges, law enforcement officials, physicians, or mental health professionals. There must be evidence that the person: * possibly has a mental illness (as defined in the Baker Act). * is a harm to self, harm to others, or self neglectful (as defined in the Baker Act). There must be evidence of recent behavior to justify the substantial likelihood of serious bodily harm in the near future. Moments in the past, when an individual may have considered harming themselves or another, do not qualify the individual as meeting the criteria. (\\"Near\\" means close, short, or draws near.) Examinations may last up to 72 hours after a person is deemed medically stable and occur in over 100 Florida Department of Children and Families-designated receiving facilities statewide. There are many possible outcomes following examination of the patient. This includes the release of the individual to the community (or other community placement), a petition for involuntary inpatient placement (what some call civil commitment), involuntary outpatient placement (what some call outpatient commitment or assisted treatment orders), or voluntary treatment (if the person is competent to consent to voluntary treatment and consents to voluntary treatment). The involuntary outpatient placement language in the Baker Act took effect as part of the Baker Act reform in 2005. * 1971 ‚Äì In Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens (PARC) v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 334 F. Supp. 1257 (E.D. Pa. 1971) the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, ruled that it was the obligation of the state of Pennsylvania to provide free public education to mentally disabled children, which it was not doing at that time. This decision struck down various state laws used to exclude disabled children from the public schools. Advocates cited this decision during public hearings that led to the passage of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975. * 1972 ‚Äì The Oregon Court of Appeals upheld the sterilization of a seventeen-year-old mentally ill girl with a history of sexual and physical abuse by her family. The Court based its decision on the recommendation of the State Board of Social Protection and the testimony of a psychiatrist who stated that the patient would never be able to provide parental guidance and judgment, saying, \\"she would never be able to provide the parental guidance and judgment which a child requires even though she might be able to master the skills necessary to take physical care of herself and a child.\\"Cook v. State, 9 Or. App. 224, 227, 495 P.2d 768, 770 (1972) The psychiatrist \\"based this conclusion on the girl's lack of emotional control, her consistent low scores in areas of judgment on psychological tests, and the likelihood that she would abuse a child.\\" * 1972 ‚Äì United States v. Brawner, 471 F.2d 969 (D.C. Cir. 1972), is a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in which the Court held that a person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. The case relied on the Durham rule for determining whether a defendant was not guilty by reason of insanity. The Court ruled that the primary reason they were departing from the old test of insanity is that it put substantial dominance on the testimony of experts. The Court exhaustively examined the justification for the defense of insanity and the need to guide the jury with a specific framework for the insanity defense. The American Law Institute provided a better framework in the majority‚Äôs opinion because it took part of the reliance on experts away and focused on the acts and mental state of a defendant at the time he committed the acts constituting the crime.Insanity, Encyclopedia of Crime and Justice 735‚Äì40 (1983); Abraham Goldstein It proposed a rule that was adopted as the American Law Institute Model Penal Code rule (ALI rule). * 1972 ‚Äì The Center for Independent Living was established by Edward Roberts and associates in Berkeley, California. It was established with funds from the Rehabilitation Administration, and it is recognized as the first center for independent living. This sparked the Independent Living Movement. * 1972 ‚Äì Mills v. Board of Education of District of Columbia, 348 F.Supp. 866 (D.D.C. 1972), was a lawsuit filed against the District of Columbia in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The court ruled that students with disabilities must be given a public education even if the students are unable to pay for the cost of the education.Mills vs. Board of Education of District of Columbia, 348 F.Supp. 866, 877‚Äì78 (D.D.C. 1972). The case established that \\"all children are entitled to free public education and training appropriate to their learning capacities\\".Henry A. Beyer, A Free Appropriate Public Education, 5 363, 365 (1983). Peter D. Roos, a former staff attorney at Harvard University's Center for Law and Education, described Mills as a \\"leading case\\" in a series of lawsuits that attempted to provide access to education for children with disabilities.Peter D. Roos, The Potential Impact of Rodriguez on Other School Reform Litigation, 38 566, 572 (1974). * 1972 ‚Äì The Houston Cooperative Living Residential Project was established in Houston, Texas. It became a model for subsequent independent living programs. * 1972 ‚Äì The Judge David L. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, founded in Washington, D.C., provided legal representation and advocated for the rights of people with mental illness. * 1972 ‚Äì The Legal Action Center (Washington, D.C. and New York City) was founded to advocate for the interests of people with alcohol or drug dependencies and for people with HIV/AIDS. * 1972 ‚Äì Paralyzed Veterans of America, National Paraplegia Foundation, and Richard Heddinger filed suit against the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, asking them to incorporate accessibility into their design for a new, multibillion-dollar subway system in Washington, D.C. Their victory was a landmark in the struggle for accessible public mass transit. * 1972 ‚Äì The Network Against Psychiatric Assault was organized in San Francisco. * 1972 ‚Äì In New York ARC v. Rockefeller, parents of 5,000 residents at the Willowbrook State School in Staten Island, New York, filed suit over the inhumane living conditions at that institution, where residents were abused and neglected. A 1972 television broadcast from the Willowbrook State School, titled \\"Willowbrook: The Last Great Disgrace,\\" outraged the general public. However, it took 3 years from the time the lawsuit documents were filed before the consent judgement was signed. In 1975, the consent judgement was signed, and it committed New York state to improve community placement for the now designated \\"Willowbrook Class.\\" The Willowbrook State School was closed in 1987, and all but about 150 of the former Willowbrook residents were moved to group homes by 1992. * 1972 ‚Äì An early version of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was vetoed by President Richard Nixon in October 1972. * 1972 ‚Äì Demonstrations were held by disabled activists in Washington, D.C. to protest Nixon‚Äôs veto of an early version of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Among the demonstrators were Disabled in Action, Paralyzed Veterans of America, the National Paraplegia Foundation, and others. * 1972 ‚Äì Disabled in Action demonstrated in New York City with a sit-in protesting Nixon‚Äôs veto of an early version of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Led by Judith Heumann, eighty activists staged this sit-in on Madison Avenue, stopping traffic. * 1972 ‚Äì The Commonwealth of Virginia ceased its sterilization program. 8,300 individuals never received justice regarding their sterilizations, which they did not consent to. * 1972 ‚Äì In Jackson v. Indiana, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a person adjudicated incompetent could not be indefinitely committed. * 1973 ‚Äì An early version of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was vetoed by President Richard Nixon in March 1973. * 1973 ‚Äì The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 became law; Section 504 of the Act states ‚ÄúNo otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States, shall, solely by reason of his [sic] handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.‚Äù This was the first U.S. federal civil rights protection for people with disabilities. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (), is a federal law, codified as et seq., that exists to extend and revise the authorization of grants to states for vocational rehabilitation services, with special emphasis on services to those with the most severe disabilities, to expand special federal responsibilities and research and training programs with respect to individuals with disabilities, to establish special responsibilities in the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare for coordination of all programs with respect to individuals with disabilities within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and for other purposes. The Rehabilitation Act requires affirmative action in employment by the federal government and by government contractors and prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in programs conducted by federal agencies, in programs receiving federal financial assistance, in federal employment, and in the employment practices of federal contractors. The standards for determining employment discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act are the same as those used in title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act. * 1973 ‚Äì In the case Sieling v. Eyman the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that a criminal defendant may not have their plea of guilty accepted by a court if they have been found competent to stand trial unless they have also been found competent to waive their constitutional rights as required in a guilty plea. * 1973 - The United States Access Board (also known as the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board) is an independent agency of the United States government devoted to accessibility for people with disabilities. The Board was created in 1973 to ensure access to federally funded facilities. * 1973 ‚Äì The Goldwater rule is the informal name given to Section 7.3 in the American Psychiatric Association's code of ethics, which states it is unethical for psychiatrists to give a professional opinion about public figures they have not examined in person, and from whom they have not obtained consent to discuss their mental health in public statements. It is named after presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. Section 7.3, which appeared in the first edition of the APA's code of ethics in 1973 and is still in effect , says: * 1973 ‚Äì Rosenhan's experiment in 1973 \\"accelerated the movement to reform mental institutions and to deinstitutionalize as many mental patients as possible.\\" * 1973 ‚Äì A federal district court ruled in Souder v. Brennan that patients in mental health institutions must be considered employees and paid the minimum wage required by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 whenever they performed any activity that conferred an economic benefit on an institution. Following this ruling, institutional peonage was outlawed, as evidenced in Pennsylvania's Institutional Peonage Abolishment Act of 1973. * 1973 ‚Äì The American Bar Association‚Äôs Commission on the Mentally Disabled was established in 1973 to respond to the advocacy needs of persons with mental disabilities. After the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the ABA broadened the Commission‚Äôs mission to serve all persons with disabilities and changed its name to the Commission on Mental and Physical Disability Law (CMPDL). In 2011, in order to better reflect the Commission's focus on both disability law and the rights of lawyers and law students with disabilities, it was renamed the Commission on Disability Rights. Its current mission as of 2015 is \\"to promote the ABA's commitment to justice and the rule of law for persons with mental, physical, and sensory disabilities and to promote their full and equal participation in the legal profession.\\" * 1973 ‚Äì Handicapped parking stickers were introduced in Washington, D.C. * 1973 ‚Äì The first Conference on Human Rights and Psychiatric Oppression was held at the University of Detroit. * 1973 ‚Äì The Federal-Aid Highway Act authorized federal funds for construction of curb cuts. * 1973 ‚Äì The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, established under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, enforced the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968. * 1973 ‚Äì The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities advocated for passage of what became the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1975 and the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975. * 1973 ‚Äì In December 1973 Leonard Roy Frank and Wade Hudson founded Network Against Psychiatric Assault (NAPA), a patients' and survivors' advocacy group.

Warren (2002) * 1974 ‚Äì Significant amendments were made to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 in 1974. Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1974. The most important was the expansion of the definition of \\"handicapped individual.\\"Section 111, , Dec. 7, 1974. The original 1973 Act defined a \\"handicapped individual\\" as > any individual who (A) has a physical or mental disability which for such > individual constitutes or results in a substantial handicap to employment > and (B) can reasonably be expected to benefit in terms of employability from > vocational rehabilitation services provided pursuant to titles I and III of > this Act.Section 7(6), . The 1974 amendments substituted a much broader definition of \\"handicapped individual\\" applicable to employment by the federal government (Section 501 of the Act), modification or elimination of architectural and transportation barriers (Section 502), employment by federal contractors (section 503) and to programs receiving federal financial assistance (Section 504) that was not related to employability through vocational rehabilitation services. The 1974 amendments provided a handicapped individual meant > any person who (A) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially > limits one or more of such person's major life activities, (B) has a record > of such an impairment, or (C) is regarded as having such an impairment. Congress adopted that definition in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, substituting the term \\"disability\\" for \\"handicapped.\\"Section 3(2), , July 26, 1990. * 1974 ‚Äì Supplemental Security Income, a United States government program that provides stipends to low-income people who are either blind or otherwise disabled, or aged 65 or older(SSA \\"Supplemental Security Income (SSI)\\" p. 2) was created in 1974 to replace federal-state adult assistance programs that served the same purpose. The restructuring of these programs was intended to standardize the eligibility requirements and level of benefits.(SSA \\"Teleservice Representative Basic Training Curriculum: Supplemental Security Income\\" p. 7) The new federal program was incorporated into Title XVI (Title 16) of the Social Security Act.(SSA \\"Teleservice Representative Basic Training Curriculum: Supplemental Security Income\\" p. 27) * 1974 ‚Äì The Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 (or VEVRAA, 38 U.S.C. ¬ß 4212) is an Act of Congress in reference to disabled veterans, Vietnam-era veterans, and any other veterans who served active duty time in a war event that qualifies for a campaign badge. This law requires that employers with federal contracts or subcontracts of $150,000 or more provide equal opportunity and affirmative action for special disabled veterans, Vietnam-era veterans, and veterans who served on active duty during a war or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized. * 1974 ‚Äì The Disabled Women's Coalition was founded at the University of California, Berkeley, by Susan Sygall and Deborah Kaplan. * 1974 ‚Äì Indiana repealed all laws concerning sterilization of the mentally ill in 1974.Public Law No. 60, Indiana Acts, 1974, p. 262. * 1974 ‚Äì The last recorded American arrest related to an ugly law was in 1974, in regard to an Omaha, Nebraska ordinance. In that instance, the man arrested was homeless and the officer arresting him did so under the guise of the ugly law as the man had visible scars and marks on his body. The judge, Walter Cropper, and assistant prosecutor, Richard Epstein, in this case noted there was no legal definition for ugly and criminal prosecution would demand proving someone is ugly. The end result was the city prosecutor, Gary Bucchino, did not file charges noting while the law was still active, this person did not meet the definition. * 1974 ‚Äì The last ugly law was repealed, in Chicago, Illinois. * 1974 ‚Äì Although the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled in the 1927 Buck v. Bell case that the state of Virginia could sterilize those it thought unfit, Virginia repealed its sterilization law in 1974. * 1974 ‚Äì The Boston Center for Independent Living was established. * 1974 ‚Äì Halderman v. Pennhurst, filed in Pennsylvania on behalf of the residents of the Pennhurst State School and Hospital, highlighted conditions at state schools for people with mental retardation.

Drafted by access advocate Ronald Mace, the code became a model for effective architectural access legislation in other states. * 1974 ‚Äì North Carolina ended its forced sterilization program. The state sterilized 7,600 people from 1929 to 1974 who were deemed socially or mentally unfit. * 1974 ‚Äì Barrier Free Environments, founded by Ronald Mace, advocated for accessibility in American buildings and products. * 1975 ‚Äì The Education for All Handicapped Children Act, PL 94-142, (renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1990) became law in the U.S., and it declared that handicapped children could not be excluded from public school because of their disability, and that school districts were required to provide special services to meet the needs of handicapped children. The law also required that handicapped children be taught in a setting that resembles as closely as possible the regular school program, while also meeting their special needs. * 1975 ‚Äì The Atlantis Community of Denver, Colorado, was founded by Wade Blank, who relocated adults with severe disabilities from a nursing home to apartments. * 1975 ‚Äì The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act became law in the U.S., and it established protection and advocacy (P & A) services. * 1975 ‚Äì The Community Services Act became law in the U.S., and it created the Head Start Program. It stipulated that at least 10% of program openings were to be reserved for disabled children. * 1975 ‚Äì The Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act became law; it is a US law providing federal funds to Councils on Developmental Disabilities, Protection and Advocacy Systems, as well as University Centers. The law defined the relatively new term \\"developmental disability\\" to include specific conditions that originate prior to age 18, are expected to continue indefinitely, and that constitute a substantial handicap. * 1975 ‚Äì The American Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities was founded in Washington, D.C.. It became the leading national cross-disability rights organization of the 1970s. * 1975 ‚Äì The Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps (TASH) was founded by special education professionals in response to PARC v. Pennsylvania (1971) and other right-to- education cases. This organization called for the end of aversive behavior modification and the closing of all residential institutions for people with disabilities. * 1975 ‚Äì On February 19, 1975 the Texas Supreme Court's ruling in the case Jacobs v. Theimer made Texas the first state in America to declare a woman could sue her doctor for a wrongful birth. That case involved Dortha Jean Jacobs (later Dortha Biggs), who caught rubella while pregnant and gave birth to Lesli, who was severely disabled. Dortha and her husband sued her doctor, saying he did not diagnose the rubella or warn them how it would affect the pregnancy. * 1975 ‚Äì The U.S. Supreme Court ruled (in O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563 (1975)) that a state cannot constitutionally confine, without more, a non-dangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely in freedom by themselves or with the help of willing and responsible family members or friends, and since the previous jury found, upon ample evidence, that petitioner did so confine respondent, it properly concluded that petitioner had violated respondent's right to liberty. * 1975 ‚Äì Parent and Training Information Centers were developed to help parents of children with disabilities exercise their rights under the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975. * 1975 ‚Äì Edward Roberts was appointed Director of the California Department of Rehabilitation. He established nine independent living centers based on the Berkeley CIL model. * 1975 ‚Äì In Drope v. Missouri, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that when deciding whether to evaluate a criminal defendant's competency, the court must consider any evidence suggestive of mental illness, even one factor alone in some circumstances. Therefore, the threshold for obtaining a competency evaluation is low. When the issue is raised, the motion should be granted. The defendant must not bear all the burden for raising the issue. * 1975 ‚Äì The Western Center on Law and the Handicapped was founded in Los Angeles. * 1975 ‚Äì Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley, is a United States Supreme Court case concerning the interpretation of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975. Amy Rowley was a deaf student, whose school refused to provide a sign language interpreter. Her parents filed suit contending violation of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975. In a 6‚Äì3 decision authored by Justice Rehnquist, the Court held that public schools are not required by law to provide sign language interpreters to deaf students who are otherwise receiving an equal and adequate education. * 1976 ‚Äì The Higher Education Act of 1972 amendment provided services to physically disabled students entering college. * 1976 ‚Äì Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California, 17 Cal. 3d 425, 551 P.2d 334, 131 Cal. Rptr. 14 (Cal. 1976), was a case in which the Supreme Court of California held that mental health professionals have a duty to protect individuals who are being threatened with bodily harm by a patient. The original 1974 decision mandated warning the threatened individual, but a 1976 rehearing of the case by the California Supreme Court called for a \\"duty to protect\\" the intended victim. The professional may discharge the duty in several ways, including notifying police, warning the intended victim, and/or taking other reasonable steps to protect the threatened individual. * 1976 ‚Äì Centers for independent living were established in Houston and Chicago. * 1976 ‚Äì Karen Ann Quinlan became unconscious after she consumed diazepam along with alcohol while on a crash diet and lapsed into a coma, followed by a persistent vegetative state. After doctors, under threat from prosecutors, refused the request of her parents, Joseph and Julia Quinlan, to disconnect Quinlan's respirator, which the parents believed constituted extraordinary means of prolonging her life, her parents filed suit to disconnect Quinlan from her ventilator. Their request was denied by New Jersey Superior Court Judge Robert Muir Jr. in November 1975. Judge Muir cited that Quinlan's doctors did not support removing her from the ventilator, that whether or not to do so was a medical rather than a judicial decision, and that doing so would violate New Jersey homicide statutes. The Quinlans appealed the decision to the New Jersey Supreme Court. On March 31, 1976, the court granted their request, holding that the right to privacy was broad enough to encompass the Quinlans' request on Quinlan's behalf. * 1976 ‚Äì The Federal Communications Commission authorized reserving Line 21 on televisions for closed captions. * 1976 ‚Äì Disabled in Action of Pennsylvania, Inc. v. Coleman was known as the Transbus lawsuit. Disabled in Action of Pennsylvania, the American Coalition of Cerebral Palsy Associations and others were represented by The Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia. They successfully filed suit to require that all buses purchased by public transit authorities receiving federal funds meet Transbus specifications (making them wheelchair accessible). * 1976 ‚Äì Celestine Tate Harrington, a street musician with quadriplegia, won the right to parent her daughter Nia, having proved to a judge that she could take care of Nia and therefore should not have to give her to the Philadelphia Department of Public Welfare because of her quadriplegia. * 1976 ‚Äì Disabled in Action picketed the United Cerebral Palsy telethon, calling telethons ‚Äúdemeaning and paternalistic shows which celebrate and encourage pity.‚Äù * 1976 ‚Äì In the case Saddler v. United States, the Second Circuit Court ruled that sentencing has to be postponed if the judge has, \\"reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant may not have a level of awareness sufficient to understand the nature of the proceeding or to exercise his right of allocution.\\" * 1976 ‚Äì The Disability Rights Center was founded in Washington, D.C. Sponsored by Ralph Nader‚Äôs Center for the Study of Responsive Law, it specialized in consumer protection for people with disabilities. * 1976 ‚Äì The Westside Center for Independent Living, Los Angeles, was one of the first nine independent living centers established by Edward Roberts, Director of the California Department of Rehabilitation. * 1976 ‚Äì James L. Cherry and several members of the Action League for Physically Handicapped Adults (ALPHA) filed a lawsuit, known as Cherry v. Mathews, which was decided in their favor on July 19, 1976. U. S. District Court Judge John Lewis Smith ruled for them and ordered DHEW (the U.S. Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare) to develop the Section 504 regulation to prohibit discrimination against \\"handicapped persons\\" in any federally funded program. In January, 1977, Mathews (then the U.S. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare) refused to sign the prepared regulation, and James Cherry and his co- plaintiffs went back to the U. S. District Court, where Mathews was held in contempt of court for refusing to follow the Cherry court order. Mathews was soon replaced by Joseph Califano due to Jimmy Carter being sworn in as President (see next entry in this timeline). * 1977 ‚Äì Initially Joseph Califano, U.S. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, refused to sign meaningful regulations for Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which was the first U.S. federal civil rights protection for people with disabilities. After an ultimatum and deadline, demonstrations took place in ten U.S. cities on April 5, 1977, including the beginning of the 504 Sit-in at the San Francisco Office of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare. This sit-in, organized by Judith Heumann, Kitty Cone, and Mary Jane Owen lasted until May 4, 1977, a total of 28 days, with more than 150 people refusing to leave. It is the longest sit-in at a federal building to date. Joseph Califano signed the regulations on April 28, 1977. * 1977 ‚Äì Max Cleland was appointed head of the U.S. Veterans Administration. He was the first severely disabled person and the youngest person to fill that position. * 1977 ‚Äì Rules were changed, so that service dogs were allowed on the U.S. Senate floor. * 1977 ‚Äì The White House Conference on Handicapped Individuals drew 3,000 people with disabilities to discuss federal policy toward people with disabilities. It resulted in numerous recommendations and acted as a catalyst for grassroots disability rights organizing. * 1977 ‚Äì The Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Act (AB 846), also known as the Lanterman Act, is a California law, initially proposed by Assemblymember Frank D. Lanterman in 1973 and passed in 1977, that gives people with developmental disabilities the right to services and supports that enable them to live a more independent and normal life. The Lanterman Act declares that persons with developmental disabilities have the same legal rights and responsibilities guaranteed all other persons by federal and state constitutions and laws, and charges the regional center with advocacy for, and protection of, these rights. * 1977 ‚Äì Legal Services Corporation Act Amendments added financially needy people with disabilities to the list of those eligible for publicly funded legal services in America. * 1977 ‚Äì The US Congress, during the presidency of Jimmy Carter, created the National Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research to investigate allegations that psychosurgery‚Äîincluding lobotomy techniques‚Äîwere used to control minorities and restrain individual rights. The committee concluded that some extremely limited and properly performed psychosurgery could have positive effects.Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Protection on Human Subjects: Use of Psychosurgery in Practice and Research: Report and Recommendations for Public Comment. Part 3. Federal Register. 23 May 1977 [archived 18 June 2013];42(99):26317‚Äì26332. * 1977 ‚Äì In Lloyd v. Regional Transportation Authority, the U.S. Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit ruled that individuals have a right to sue under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and that public transit authorities must provide accessible service. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, in Snowden v. Birmingham Jefferson County Transit Authority undermined this decision by ruling that authorities need to provide access only to ‚Äúhandicapped persons other than those confined to wheelchairs.‚Äù * 1978 ‚Äì On July 5 and 6 1978, a Denver intersection was the site of the first demonstration for wheelchair accessible public transportation when nineteen members of the Atlantis Community (known as the Gang of Nineteen) chanting \\"We Will Ride\\" blocked buses with their wheelchairs, staying in the streets all night. * 1978 ‚Äì Disability rights activists successfully protested the Denver Regional Transit Authority with a civil disobedience campaign because the transit system was inaccessible to people who used wheelchairs. * 1978 ‚Äì The Adaptive Environments Center was founded in Boston. * 1978 ‚Äì Title VII of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1978 became law in the U.S., and it established the first federal funding for consumer-controlled independent living centers and created the National Council of the Handicapped under the U.S. Department of Education. * 1978 ‚Äì \\"On Our Own: Patient Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System\\", by Judi Chamberlin, was published; it became the standard text of the psychiatric survivor movement. * 1978 ‚Äì In Rennie v. Klein, the Federal District Court of New Jersey ruled that an involuntarily committed individual has a constitutional right to refuse psychotropic medication without a court order. * 1978 - In 1971, Judge Harold D. Stump granted a mother's petition to have a tubal ligation performed on her 15-year-old daughter, who the mother alleged was \\"somewhat retarded\\". This led to Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349 (1978), which is the leading United States Supreme Court decision on judicial immunity. It involved the then-grown daughter suing the judge because she had been sterilized without her knowledge as a minor in accordance with the judge's order. The Supreme Court held that the judge was immune from being sued for issuing the order because it was issued as a judicial function. The case has been called one of the most controversial in recent Supreme Court history. * 1978 ‚Äì The National Center for Law and the Deaf was founded in Washington, D.C. * 1978 ‚Äì Handicapping America, by Frank Bowe, was published; it was a comprehensive review of the policies and attitudes denying equal citizenship to Americans with disabilities. It became a standard text of the disability rights movement. * 1978 ‚Äì The Wage and Hour Act was amended in Alaska to exempt businesses from paying minimum wage to \\"an individual whose earning capacity is impaired by physical or mental deficiency, age, or injury.\\" After the amending, employers were required to apply for a state waiver showing that the worker's physical or mental disability impaired their ability to do the job. Then the state labor commissioner would decide whether or not the person would be able to get a job that would pay the minimum wage. However, paying workers with disabilities less than the minimum wage was outlawed in Alaska in 2018. * 1979 ‚Äì Part B funds created ten new centers for independent living across the U.S. * 1979 ‚Äì Vermont Center for Independent Living, the first statewide independent living center in the U.S., was founded by representatives of Vermont disability groups. * 1979 ‚Äì The U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Addington v. Texas raised the burden of proof required to commit persons for psychiatric treatment from the usual civil burden of proof of \\"preponderance of the evidence\\" to the higher standard of \\"clear and convincing evidence\\". * 1979 ‚Äì In Southeastern Community College v. Davis, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, programs receiving federal funds must make ‚Äúreasonable modifications‚Äù to enable the participation of otherwise qualified disabled individuals. This decision was the Court‚Äôs first ruling on Section 504 establishing reasonable modification as an important principle in disability rights law. * 1979 ‚Äì In Rogers v. Okin, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled that a competent patient committed to a psychiatric hospital has the right to refuse treatment in non-emergency situations.Alliance for Human Research Protection, article title, Deaths, A Consequence of Forced Psychotropic Drugs, published Thursday, February 19th, 2009 * 1979 ‚Äì The Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF) was established in Berkeley, California. It conducts landmark litigation and lobbying. * 1979 ‚Äì Frendak v. United States, 408 A.2d 364 (D.C. 1979) is a landmark case in which the District of Columbia Court of Appeals decided that a judge could not impose an insanity defense over the defendant's objections. * 1979 ‚Äì The Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924 was repealed; it had provided for compulsory sterilization of persons deemed to be \\"feebleminded,\\" including the \\"insane, idiotic, imbecile, or epileptic.\\" It had been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case Buck v. Bell 274 U.S. 200 (1927). * 1979 ‚Äì In the case Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584 (1979), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a parent or a guardian can commit a minor to a mental institution if a staff physician certifies that said minor should be committed, even if said minor is very much against this commitment. The Court specifically rejected the idea that such commitment without an adversary hearing is against due process of law. 1980s * 1980 - The Disability Amendments Act of 1980 became law. * 1980 ‚Äì The National Disabled Women's Educational Equity Project, Berkeley, California, was established by Corbett O'Toole. Based at the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF), the Project administered the first national survey on disability and gender and conducted the first national Conference on Disabled Women's Educational Equity held in Bethesda, Maryland. * 1980 ‚Äì The Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act authorized the U.S. Justice Department to file civil suits on behalf of residents of institutions whose rights were being violated. * 1980 ‚Äì The New Hampshire Supreme Court held that a probate court may approve a petition for the sterilization of an incompetent minor if a guardian ad litem is appointed to represent the minor and the court finds with clear and convincing evidence that the sterilization is in the best interest of the patient. * 1980 ‚Äì The New Jersey Supreme Court held that a mentally disabled woman has the right to be sterilized under the privacy rights of both the New Jersey and Federal Constitutions; however, the incompetent must be represented by counsel and the court may only authorize the sterilization if there is clear and convincing evidence the sterilization is in the person's best interest. * 1980 ‚Äì The mother of a mentally incompetent minor petitioned the court for an order authorizing the sterilization of the minor. The Washington Supreme Court held that the Washington Superior courts have authority under the Washington constitution to grant the sterilization; however, the mother failed to show with clear and convincing evidence the sterilization was in the best interest of the minor. * 1980 ‚Äì The American National Standard Institute, Inc. (ANSI) published American Standard Specifications for Making Buildings Accessible to, and Usable by, the Physically Handicapped (the A117.1 Barrier Free Standard). This landmark document, produced by the University of Illinois, became the basis for subsequent architectural access codes Uniform Federal Accessibility Standard 1984 and the Americans with Disabilities Act 1990. * 1980 ‚Äì The Mental Health Systems Act of 1980 (MHSA) was United States legislation signed by President Jimmy Carter which provided grants to community mental health centers. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, signed by President Ronald Reagan on August 13, 1981, repealed most of the MHSA. The Patients' Bill of Rights, section 501, was not repealed; per Congressional record, the Congress felt that state provisions were sufficient and section 501 served as a recommendation to states to review and refine existing policies. * 1980 ‚Äì The California Court of Appeal held in 1980 (in Curlender v. Bio-Science Laboratories, 165 Cal.Rptr. 477, 488 (Cal.App. 1980)) that \\"a reverent appreciation of life compels recognition that [a wrongful life] plaintiff, however impaired she may be, has come into existence as a living person with certain rights\\" ‚Äì i.e. the right to recover against a doctor whose negligence resulted in her disease.Curlender v. Bio-Science Laboratories, 165 Cal.Rptr. 477, 488 (Cal.App. 1980). The Curlender decision involved a child who was allegedly born with Tay‚ÄìSachs disease after the parents relied upon the defendants' representations about the reliability of their genetic tests in refraining from proceeding with amniocentesis. Curlender was not the first appellate decision to authorize a cause of action for wrongful life‚Äîit noted that a 1977 decision of the intermediate appellate court of New York had taken the same position, and was promptly overruled by the highest court of that state a year later. However, Curlender stands as the first such appellate decision which was not later overruled. * 1981 ‚Äì The Alaska Supreme Court held that an Alaskan Superior Court has the authority to order the sterilization of a mental incompetent upon petition by the incompetent's legal guardian if it is proven with clear and convincing evidence that sterilization is in the best interest of the incompetent. * 1981 ‚Äì The Colorado Supreme Court held that a district court may authorize the sterilization of a \\"mentally retarded person\\" if the court finds with clear and convincing evidence the procedure is medically essential. The Court defined \\"medically essential\\" as a procedure that is \\"clearly necessary, in the opinion of experts, to preserve the life or physical or mental health of the mentally retarded person. * 1981 ‚Äì Poe v. Lynchburg Training School and Hospital, Civ. A. No. 80-0172, 518 F. Supp. 789 (W.D. Va 1981) concerned whether or not patients who had been involuntarily sterilized in Lynchburg Training School and Hospital, a state mental institution in Virginia, as part of a program of eugenics in the early and mid-20th century had their constitutional rights violated. The case had been filed in 1980 by the American Civil Liberties Union's Reproductive Freedom Project on behalf of 8,000 women who had been sterilized under the program. The court ruled that the sterilization did not violate constitutional rights, and that though the statute on involuntary sterilization of \\"mental defectives\\" had since been repealed, it had previously been upheld as constitutional (in Buck v. Bell, 1927). However, the fact that state officials did not notify or provide subsequent medical services to the sterilized individuals was found to merit further consideration by the court. In a settlement reached in 1985, the state agreed to inform the women about what had been done to them and to help them get counseling and medical treatment. * 1981 ‚Äì The United Nations established this year as the International Year of Disabled Persons. At the conclusion of the year the UN called on member nations to establish in their own countries organizations for and about people with disabilities. Alan Reich, who headed the U.S. committee for the International Year, established the National Organization on Disability [www.nod.org] in response to this call. * 1981 ‚Äì Estelle v. Smith, , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that, per Miranda v. Arizona (1966), the state may not force a defendant to submit to a psychiatric examination solely for the purposes of sentencing. Any such examination violates the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination as well as the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and is therefore inadmissible at sentencing. * 1981 ‚Äì In Tokarcik v. Forest Hills School District, 655 F.2d 443 (3rd Cir. 1981), the United States Court of Appeals, Third Circuit, ruled that denying a disabled child access to a regular public school classroom without a compelling education justification constituted discrimination. * 1981 ‚Äì Gini Laurie organized the first international conference on post-polio problems. * 1981 - President Reagan ordered the Social Security Administration (SSA) to tighten up enforcement of the Disability Amendments Act of 1980, which resulted in more than a million disability beneficiaries having their benefits stopped. * 1982 ‚Äì A baby known as ‚ÄúBaby Doe‚Äù was born in Bloomington, Indiana, with Down syndrome and a birth defect requiring surgery. The parents refused the surgery because of the child‚Äôs Down syndrome. Hospital officials had a guardian appointed by the Indiana Juvenile Court to determine whether the surgery should be done. The court ruled in favor of the parents (and thus against the surgery), and the Indiana Supreme Court refused to hear the case. The baby died later in 1982. Due to the baby‚Äôs death there could be no appeal to the Supreme Court. * 1982 - A Katie Beckett waiver or TEFRA waiver is a Medicaid waiver concerning the income eligibility for home-based Medicaid services for children under the age of nineteen. The waiver is also called a TEFRA waiver because it was passed as a provision of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. * 1982 ‚Äì Under Title 34 B Chapter 7 of the Maine Revised Statutes, also known as the \\"Due Process in Sterilization Act of 1982,\\" a hearing and a District Court order authorizing the sterilization is required if the sterilization is sought for \\"A. Persons under age 18 years and not married or otherwise emancipated; B. Persons presently under public or private guardianship or conservatorship; C. Persons residing in a state institution providing care, treatment or security, or otherwise in state custody; or D. Persons from whom a physician could not obtain informed consent.\\" The hearing to determine the patient's ability to give informed consent requires at least two disinterested experts in developmental disabilities or mental health, including at least one psychologist or psychiatrist to examine the person to determine competency. If the court determines the person is not competent to give informed consent the court will appoint at least three disinterested experts to examine the person for the beneficial or detrimental effects of sterilization. The sterilization may be authorized if the court determines with clear and convincing evidence that the sterilization is in the best interests of the patient and other methods of contraception are inappropriate or unworkable for the person. * 1982 ‚Äì The Telecommunications for the Disabled Act became law in the U.S., and it mandated that public phones be accessible to the hearing impaired by Jan 1, 1985. * 1982 ‚Äì Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case regarding the rights of the involuntarily committed and mentally retarded. Nicholas Romeo was mentally retarded with an infant level IQ and was committed to a Pennsylvania state hospital. He was restrained for many hours of the day and repeatedly injured. The Supreme Court agreed with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals that involuntarily committed residents had the right to reasonably safe confinement conditions, no unreasonable body restraints and the habilitation they reasonably require. * 1982 ‚Äì In Board of Education v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176 (2nd Circuit Court 1982), the 2nd Circuit Court in the U.S. found that individualized decisions based on the unique needs of each child were essential under federal law. Schools who let one criterion, such as a specific disability, automatically determine the placement are likely to be held in violation of federal law. * 1982 ‚Äì The Appeals Court of Massachusetts held that a court of general jurisdiction has the authority to hear a petition to sterilize a mentally retarded person. The court stated that the court must use substituted consent to determine if the sterilization should be authorized, and \\"no sterilization is to be compelled on the basis of any State or parental interest.\\" * 1982 ‚Äì In a 1982 case involving hereditary deafness, the Supreme Court of California was the first state supreme court to endorse the child's right to sue for wrongful life, but in the same decision, limited the child's recovery to special damages.Turpin v. Sortini, 31 Cal. 3d 220 (1982). This rule implies that the child can recover objectively provable economic damages, but cannot recover general damages like subjective \\"pain and suffering\\"‚Äîthat is, monetary compensation for the entire experience of having a disabled life versus having a healthy mind and/or body. * 1982 ‚Äì The Maryland Court of Appeals held that circuit courts have the jurisdiction to hear a petition for the sterilization on an incompetent minor. The court may only approve of the petition for sterilization if it is proven with clear and convincing evidence that the \\"procedure is medically necessary to preserve the life or physical or mental health of the incompetent minor.\\" * 1982 ‚Äì 1983: In 1982 a ban on the use of electroshock in Berkeley, California was passed. However, in June 1983 Donald McCullom, an Alameda County Superior Court Judge, issued an injunction on the implementation of the ban. Initiative T. (the ban) was overturned shortly thereafter following a successful legal challenge initiated by the American Psychiatric Association, on the constitutionality of the measure.Boodman, Sandra G. (24 September 1996). \\"Shock therapy: it's back\\". Washington Post. * 1983 ‚Äì The Indiana Supreme Court authorized for the sterilization of a mentally retarded twelve-year-old girl who engaged in self-destructive behavior such as pulling her hair, biting herself, banging her head, ripping her skin with her fingernails, and resisting the \\"restraints in order to hurt her own body.\\" The patient's parents and her doctors were both in agreement that a hysterectomy was necessary in order to prevent \\"hemorrhaging and infection, and possibly death\\" because the patient's excitement with her own blood may cause her \\"to induce bleeding by poking into her vagina or abdomen in an attempt to keep the blood flowing\\" once she develops her menstruation cycle. The Court held that a specific Indiana statute authorizing sterilization was not necessary in order to authorize the sterilization, the juvenile court had the authority to authorize sterilizations if there was clear and convincing evidence that the medical procedure was necessary, and in this case there was overwhelming evidence that the sterilization was medically necessary. * 1983 ‚Äì In Hawaii Department of Education v. Katherine D., the U.S. federal appeals court found \\"intermittent\\" nursing services, including care of a child's tracheostomy tube, to be not too burdensome for a school to provide to a student. * 1983 ‚Äì The Americans Disabled for Accessible Public Transit (ADAPT) organization was established in Denver, Colorado. * 1983 ‚Äì The New York Supreme Court authorized the sterilization of an incompetent person. * 1983 ‚Äì In Barefoot v. Estelle the United States Supreme Court held that there was no merit to the petitioner's argument that psychiatrists, individually and as a group, were incompetent to predict with an acceptable degree of reliability that a particular criminal would commit other crimes in the future, and so represent a danger to the community. * 1983 ‚Äì The National Council on Independent Living (NCIL) was founded by Max Starkloff, Charlie Carr, and Marca Bristo. * 1983 ‚Äì A national Americans Disabled for Accessible Public Transit (ADAPT) action was held for accessible transportation in Denver, Colorado at the American Public Transit Association (APTA) Convention. * 1983 ‚Äì The World Institute on Disability (WID) was established in Berkeley, California, by Edward Roberts, Judy Heumann, and Joan Leon. * 1983 ‚Äì The Disabled Children's Computer Group (DCCG) was founded in Berkeley, California. * 1983 ‚Äì The National Council on the Handicapped called for Congress to include persons with disabilities in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other civil and voting rights legislation and regulations. * 1983 ‚Äì The United Nations expanded the International Year of Disabled Persons to the International Decade of Disabled Persons (1983‚Äì1992). * 1983 ‚Äì The Job Accommodation Network (JAN) was founded by the President‚Äôs Committee on Employment of the Handicapped to provide information to businesses with disabled employees. * 1983 ‚Äì Amendments to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provided for the Client Assistance Program (CAP), an advocacy program for consumers of rehabilitation and independent living services. * 1983 ‚Äì In Roncker v. Walter, 700 F2d. 1058 (6th Circuit Court 1983), the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court addressed the issue of \\"bringing educational services to the child\\" versus \\"bringing the child to the services\\". The case was resolved in favor of integrated versus segregated placement and established a principle of portability; that is, \\"if a desirable service currently provided in a segregated setting can feasiblely be delivered in an integrated setting, it would be inappropriate under PL 94-142 to provide the service in a segregated environment.\\" The Roncker Court found that placement decisions must be individually made. School districts that automatically place children in a predetermined type of school solely on the basis of their disability (e.g., mentally retardation) rather than on the basis of the IEP, violate federal laws. * 1983 ‚Äì Jablonski by Pahls v. United States, 712 F.2d 391 (9th Cir. 1983) is a landmark case in which the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals determined that a mental health professional's duty to predict dangerousness includes consulting a patient's prior records, and that their duty to protect includes the involuntary commitment of a dangerous individual; simply warning the foreseeable victim is insufficient. * 1983 ‚Äì State v. Crenshaw, 98 Wash. 2d 789, 659 P.2d 488 (1983), is a criminal case interpreting the relationship of the insanity defense to a deific decree. The Supreme Court of Washington carved out the deific exception from the standard set forth in People v. Schmidt (1915), that a person can be found not guilty by reason of insanity even if they knew their act was morally wrong by the standards of society and wrong under the law, if their mental disorder was a delusion that God commanded their act. A mother insanely killed her child in the delusional belief that she was obeying God's command. It was found that \\"it would be unrealistic to hold her responsible for the crime, since her free will has been subsumed by her belief in the deific decree. * 1983 ‚Äì The Supreme Court of Georgia held the Georgia sterilization code unconstitutional because it used the ‚Äúpreponderance of the evidence‚Äù standard, and a court order that permanently deprives a person of a fundamental right requires a judicial finding of ‚Äúclear and convincing‚Äù evidence. Since this case, the Georgia legislature changed the code to require ‚Äúclear and convincing‚Äù evidence in order to comply with the requirements of the Constitution. * 1983 ‚Äì Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U.S. 458 (1983), is a United States Supreme Court case concerning whether the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services could rely on published medical-vocational guidelines to determine a claimant‚Äôs right to Social Security benefits. In an opinion delivered by Justice Powell, the Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit, saying that ‚Äú[w]here the statute expressly entrusts the Secretary with the responsibility for implementing a provision by regulation, review is limited to determining whether the regulations promulgated exceeded the Secretary‚Äôs statutory authority and whether they are arbitrary and capricious.‚Äù The Court decided that even where an agency's enabling statute expressly required that it hold a hearing, the agency could rely on its rulemaking authority to determine issues that didn't require case-by-case considerations. The court held that the Secretary‚Äôs reliance on the guidelines were not inconsistent with the Social Security Act, nor were they arbitrary and capricious. * 1984 ‚Äì Ted Kennedy, Jr., spoke from the platform of the Democratic National Convention on disability rights. * 1984 - The Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984 was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. * 1984 ‚Äì In January of 1984, the American government issued Baby Doe regulations whereby if parents refused treatment for their infants with congenital defects, Infant Care Review Committees were required to advise the hospital to alert the courts or a child protective agency. In 1986, those regulations were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case Bowen v. American Hospital Association (AHA), et al., on the grounds that the autonomy of the states had been violated and that the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 did not apply to the medical care of handicapped infants.The Future of Children, Journal Issue: Low Birth Weight, \\"Evidence-Based Ethics and the Care of Premature Infants.\\" 5(1), Spring 1995. However, on October 9, 1984, the final Baby Doe law, known as the Baby Doe Amendment, amended the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1974 to include the withholding of fluids, food, and medically indicated treatment from disabled newborns. This law went into effect on June 1, 1985 and is still in effect.For information about this, see: Kathryn Moss (1987) \\"The 'Baby Doe' Legislation: Its Rise and Fall\\". Policy Studies Journal 15 (4), 629‚Äì651. * 1984 ‚Äì The Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984 amended the United States federal laws governing defendants with mental diseases or defects to make it significantly more difficult to obtain a verdict of not guilty only by reason of insanity. It removed the volitional component, that a defendant lacked capacity to conform their conduct to the law, from the ALI test. Defendants were only exculpated only if \\"at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, ... as the result of a severe mental disease or defect, [they were] unable to appreciate the nature and quality or wrongfulness of [their] acts.\\" The law passed in the wake of public outrage after John Hinckley, Jr.'s acquittal by reason of insanity for his attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan. Prior to the enactment of the law, the federal standard for \\"insanity\\" was that the government had to prove a defendant's sanity beyond a reasonable doubt (assuming the insanity defense was raised). Following the Act's enactment, the defendant has the burden of proving insanity by \\"clear and convincing evidence.\\"United States v. Freeman, 804 F. 2d 1574 (11th Cir. 1986). Furthermore, expert witnesses for either side are prohibited from testifying directly as to whether the defendant was legally sane or not, but can only testify as to their mental health and capacities, with the question of sanity itself to be decided by the finder-of- fact at trial. * 1984 ‚Äì The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Irving Independent School District v. Tatro that school districts are required under the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 to provide intermittent catheterization performed by the school nurse or a nurse‚Äôs aide as a ‚Äúrelated service‚Äù to a disabled student. School districts can no longer refuse to educate a disabled child because they might need such service. * 1984 ‚Äì The National Council of the Handicapped became an independent federal agency. * 1984 ‚Äì The Social Security Disability Reform Act was passed in response to the complaints of hundreds of thousands of people whose social security disability benefits were terminated. The law required that payment of benefits and health insurance coverage continue for terminated recipients until they exhausted their appeals. * 1984 ‚Äì The Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act became law in the U.S., and it mandated \\"handicapped and elderly\\" access to polling places, and provided for the creation of permanent disabled access voter registration sites. * 1981‚Äì1984 ‚Äì The Reagan administration threatened to amend or revoke regulations implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975. Disability rights advocates Patrisha Wright of the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF), and Evan Kemp, Jr. (of the Disability Rights Center) led an intense lobbying and grassroots campaign that generated more than 40,000 cards and letters. After three years, the Reagan Administration abandoned its attempts to revoke or amend the regulations. However, the Reagan Administration terminated the Social Security benefits of hundreds of thousands of disabled recipients. Distressed by this action, several disabled people committed suicide. A variety of groups including the Alliance of Social Security Disability Recipients and the Ad Hoc Committee on Social Security Disability fought these terminations. * 1984 ‚Äì Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89 (1984), was a United States Supreme Court decision holding that the Eleventh Amendment prohibits a federal court from ordering state officials to obey state law. * 1985 ‚Äì The Mental Illness Bill of Rights Act became law in the U.S., and it required states to provide protection and advocacy services to protect and advocate for people with psychological disabilities. * 1985 ‚Äì Ake v. Oklahoma, , was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required the state to provide a psychiatric evaluation to be used on behalf of an indigent criminal defendant if they needed it.Greenhouse, Linda. Becoming Justice Blackmun. Times Books. 2005. Page 160. * 1985 ‚Äì The Maine Supreme Judicial Court heard a petition from a mother requesting for the court to authorize the sterilization of her mentally incompetent daughter. The court held that it did have the authority to grant a petition for sterilization if it is proven with clear and convincing evidence the sterilization is in the best interest of the patient; however, in this case, the court did not grant the petition because the physicians did not state the patient was capable of reproducing. * 1985 ‚Äì Final legal hearings on eugenics were held in the Commonwealth of Virginia. No financial settlement was granted. * 1985 ‚Äì The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Burlington School Committee v. Department of Education that schools must pay the expenses of disabled children enrolled in private programs during litigation under the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, if the courts ruled that such placement is needed to provide the child with an appropriate education in the least restrictive environment. * 1985 ‚Äì The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center that localities cannot use zoning laws to prohibit group homes for people with developmental disabilities from opening in a residential area solely because its residents are disabled. * 1985 ‚Äì In People v. Skinner (1985), the California Supreme Court further specified the criteria for \\"settled insanity\\". The person must have a mental illness that is relatively stable over time, not caused solely by the length of time the substance was abused, and it must also meet the legal definition of insanity in that jurisdiction. Therefore, it appears that the court is stating that a threshold condition for the insanity defense exists when there is a permanent impairment caused by chronic substance abuse in a person with a preexisting mental illness unrelated to substance abuse, but aggravated or set off by voluntary intoxication. * 1985 ‚Äì The International Polio Network was founded by Gini Laurie, and began advocating for recognition of post-polio syndrome. * 1985 ‚Äì The National Association of Psychiatric Survivors was founded. * 1985 ‚Äì The North Carolina Supreme Court held that a court has authority to authorize the sterilization of an incompetent person if the sterilization is in the best interest of the patient. * 1985 ‚Äì The Supreme Court of California held that a California statute that completely prohibits the sterilization of the developmentally disabled is overbroad and unconstitutional because a mentally incompetent person has a constitutional right to sterilization if a less intrusive method of birth control is not available. * 1986 ‚Äì Toward Independence, a report of the National Council on the Handicapped, outlined the legal status of Americans with disabilities and documented the existence of discrimination. It cited the need for federal civil rights legislation (eventually passed as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990). * 1986 ‚Äì PL 99-308 became law, allowing former mental patients to appeal to restore their rights to purchase firearms. * 1986 ‚Äì Concrete Change, a grassroots organization advocating accessible housing, was organized in Atlanta, Georgia. * 1986 ‚Äì The Employment Opportunities for Disabled Americans Act was passed, allowing recipients of Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability Insurance to retain benefits, particularly medical coverage, after they obtain work. * 1986 ‚Äì The Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act was passed setting up protection and advocacy (P & A) agencies for people who are in-patients or residents of mental health facilities. * 1986 - The Handicapped Children's Protection Act of 1986 became law. * 1986 ‚Äì The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986 defined supported employment as a ‚Äúlegitimate rehabilitation outcome.‚Äù * 1986 ‚Äì Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157 (1986), was a U.S. Supreme Court case that was initiated by Francis Connelly, who insisted that his schizophrenic episode rendered him incompetent, nullifying his waiver of his Miranda rights. The court ruled that because Connelly was not coerced by the Government to divulge any information, his statement should be allowed in Court due to the lack of violation of the Due Process Clause. * 1986 ‚Äì Ford v. Wainwright, , was a U.S. Supreme Court case that upheld the common law rule that the insane cannot be executed. * 1986 ‚Äì The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 was amended to allow the United States Secretary of Labor to provide special certificates to allow an employer to pay less than the minimum wage to individuals whose earning or productive capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury.\\"S.2884 ‚Äî 99th Congress (1985‚Äì1986)\\". United States Congress. October 16, 1986. These employees must still be paid wages that are related to the individual's productivity and commensurate with those paid to similarly located and employed non-handicapped workers. Paying workers with disabilities less than the minimum wage was outlawed in New Hampshire in 2015, Maryland in 2016, and Alaska in 2018. * 1987 ‚Äì Gini Laurie founded the International Ventilator Users Network (IVUN). * 1987 ‚Äì In School Bd. of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987), the Supreme Court found that a person with a contagious disease is considered a \\"handicapped individual\\" and therefore is entitled to the protections of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. * 1987 ‚Äì Justin Dart, Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration, was forced to resign after he testified to the U.S. Congress that ‚Äúan inflexible federal system, like the society it represents, still contains a significant portion of individuals who have not yet overcome obsolete, paternalistic attitudes toward disability...‚Äù * 1987 ‚Äì The Alliance for Technology Access was founded in California by the Disabled Children's Computer Group and the Apple Computer Office of Special Education. * 1987 ‚Äì Prior to 1987 it was assumed that the Lanterman‚ÄìPetris‚ÄìShort Act allowed involuntary treatment for those who were detained under an initial three day hold (for evaluation and treatment) and a subsequent fourteen day hospitalization (for those patients declared after the three-day hold to be dangerous to themselves or others or gravely disabled). However, in 1987 in Riese v. St. Mary‚Äôs Hospital and Medical Center the California State Court of Appeals declared that these patients had the right to exercise informed consent regarding the use of antipsychotic drugs, except in an emergency, and if they rejected medication \\"a judicial determination of their incapacity to make treatment decisions\\" was required before they could be involuntarily treated. This case was a class action suit brought in the name of patient Eleanor Riese by the California ACLU. * 1988 ‚Äì The Air Carrier Access Act was passed prohibiting airlines from refusing to serve people with disabilities and from charging people with disabilities more for airfare than non-disabled travelers. * 1988 ‚Äì The Civil Rights Restoration Act counteracted bad case law by clarifying Congress‚Äô original intention. Under the Rehabilitation Act, discrimination in any program or service that receives federal funding ‚Äì not just the part which actually and directly receives the funding ‚Äì is illegal. * 1988 ‚Äì A Deaf President Now student demonstration was held at Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C. On March 13 Dr. I. King Jordan was named the first Deaf president of the university. * 1988 ‚Äì The Fair Housing Act was amended to protect people with disabilities from housing discrimination in the areas of rentals, sales, and financing, as outlined in the Civil Rights Act of 1968. The amendment also provided that reasonable modifications had to be made to existing buildings and accessibility had to be constructed into new multi-family housing units.Fleischer, Doris Z. and Frieda Zames. \\"Disability Rights.\\" Social Policy 28.3 (1998) 52‚Äì55. * 1988 ‚Äì Americans Disabled for Accessible Public Transit (ADAPT) protested inaccessible Greyhound buses. * 1988 ‚Äì The Technology-Related Assistance Act for Individuals with Disabilities became law in the U.S., authorizing federal funding to state projects designed to facilitate access to assistive technology. The Act was reauthorized in 1994 (P.L. 103-218) and again in 1998 (P.L. 105-394). It was designated as a systems change grant and is often called the \\"Tech Act\\" for short. Due to the Act every state and territory of the United States was awarded a Tech Act project. The first group of projects started in 1989. Each state project had five years of funding under the 1989 law. A competitive grant application was required to receive an additional five years of funds. Projects were assured of eight years of full funding; the ninth year at 75% of full funding; and the tenth year as a Tech Act project at 50% of full funding. Legislation supporting the state assistive technology projects was scheduled to sunset on September 30, 2004. The Assistive Technology Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-364) reauthorized the assistive technology programs in all states and territories for five years as a formula-based program, and removed the sunset provision from the law. It also required states to provide direct aid to individuals with disabilities to ensure they have access to the technology they need. As a result, the majority of state efforts are required to be conducted in the following areas: assistive technology reutilization programs, assistive technology demonstration programs, alternative financing programs and device loan programs. * 1988 ‚Äì The Congressional Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities was created by Rep. Major Owens, with Justin Whitlock Dart, Jr. and Elizabeth Monroe Boggs as co-chairs. The Task Force began building grassroots support for passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). * 1988 ‚Äì San Francisco historian and disability rights scholar Paul K. Longmore burned his first book, \\"The Invention of George Washington\\", on the steps of a federal building in 1988 to protest policies that discriminated against disabled Americans. The Social Security Administration eventually revised its rules to allow disabled authors to count publishing royalties as earned income. The change became known as the \\"Longmore Amendment\\". * 1988 ‚Äì The Iowa Supreme Court held that a district court has jurisdiction to authorize the sterilization of an incompetent person, even in the absence of an Iowa statute regulating sterilization. * 1988 ‚Äì An act, passed by the General Assembly of Virginia in 1988 and amended in 2013, provides the procedural requirements necessary for a physician to lawfully sterilize a patient capable of giving informed consent and incapable of giving informed consent. A physician may perform a sterilization procedure on a patient if the patient is capable of giving informed consent, the patient consents to the procedure in writing, and the physician explains the consequences of the procedure and alternative methods of contraception. A court may authorize a physician to perform a sterilization on a mentally incompetent adult or child after the procedural requirements are met and the court finds with clear and convincing evidence the patient is or is likely to engage sexual activity, no other contraceptive is reasonably available, the patient's mental disability renders the patient permanently unable to care for a child, and the procedure conforms with medical standards. * 1988 ‚Äì In Honig v. Doe, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the stay-put rule established under the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975. School authorities cannot expel or suspend or otherwise move disabled children from the setting agreed upon in the child‚Äôs Individualized Education Program (IEP) without a due process hearing. * 1988 ‚Äì The original version of the Americans with Disabilities Act was introduced in 1988. It was redrafted and reintroduced in Congress later. Disability organizations and activists across the country advocated on its behalf (Patrisha Wright, Marilyn Golden, Liz Savage, Justin Dart, and Elizabeth Monroe Boggs, among others). * 1989 ‚Äì Community Options was founded by Robert Stack, Dr. Colleen Wieck, Frank Zak, Paul Hritz and Elizabeth Pendler, with a mission to develop supports for persons with disabilities. * 1989 ‚Äì In Penry v. Lynaugh, , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Eighth Amendment did not forbid executing the mentally retarded; however, they also ruled that the three \\"special issues\\" a Texas jury was required to consider before imposing the death penalty did not adequately allow the jury in Penry's sentencing hearing to consider his alleged mental retardation as a mitigating factor. * 1989 ‚Äì In ADAPT v. Skinner, the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that federal regulations requiring that transit authorities spend only 3% of their budgets on access are arbitrary and discriminatory. * 1989 ‚Äì The Center for Universal Design (originally the Center for Accessible Housing) was founded by Ronald Mace in Raleigh, North Carolina. * 1989 ‚Äì Mouth: The Voice of Disability Rights began publication in Rochester, New York. * 1989 ‚Äì The President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped was renamed the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities. * 1989 ‚Äì In Daniel R.R. v State Board of Education, 874 F.2d 1036 (5th Circuit Court 1989), the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found that regular education placement is appropriate if a child with a disability can receive a satisfactory education, even if it is not the best academic setting for the child; non-academic benefits must also be considered. The Court stated that \\"academic achievement is not the only purpose of mainstreaming. Integrating a handicapped child into a nonhandicapped environment may be beneficial in and of itself...even if the child cannot flourish academically.\\" The Circuit Court developed a two-pronged test to determine if the district's actions were in compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA): 1) Can education in the regular classroom with the use of supplemental aids and services be achieved satisfactorily? 2) If it cannot, has the school mainstreamed the child to the maximum extent appropriate? 1990s * 1990s ‚Äì In the 1990s, Hillary Clinton, at the suggestion of Visitors Office Director Melinda N. Bates, approved the addition of a ramp in the East Wing corridor of the White House. It allows easy wheelchair access for the public tours and special events that enter through the secure entrance building on the east side. * 1990 ‚Äì The Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990 , requires the Attorney General to collect data on crimes committed because of the victim's disability, race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. The bill was signed into law in 1990 by George H. W. Bush. * 1990 ‚Äì The Indiana Court of Appeals held that an appointed guardian may consent to health care for an adult incapable of consenting if there is \\"clear and convincing evidence that the judicially appointed guardian brought the petition for sterilization in good faith and the sterilization is in the best interest of the incompetent adult.\\" Judge Sullivan wrote a concurring opinion stating that he was not convinced that in this present case the sterilization was done for healthcare, and consequentially, the consent of the guardian is not a factor in considering the legality of the sterilization. According to Sullivan a sterilization of an incompetent requires \\"an evidentiary hearing, following which the court finds clear and convincing evidence that sterilization is in the best interests of the individual concerned. * 1990 ‚Äì The Colorado Supreme Court held that a person \\"mentally incompetent to make some decisions is not necessarily incompetent . . . to grant or withhold consent to sterilization.\\" Three members of the Court dissented from the majority opinion and stated that the \\"individual‚Äôs capacity to understand the risks of pregnancy and childbirth [should also be part of] the test for determining one‚Äôs competence to make a decision regarding sterilization.\\" * 1990 ‚Äì Sullivan v. Zebley, 493 U.S. 521 (1990), was a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court involving the determination of childhood Social Security Disability benefits. In the decision, the Supreme Court ruled that substantial parts of the Supplemental Security Income program's regulation on determining disability for children were inconsistent with the Social Security Act; particularly, the statutory standard of ‚Äúcomparable severity.‚Äù The suit highlighted what some felt was the need for a step in the evaluation of childhood disability claims that would be akin to the functional evaluation considered in many adult claims. It resulted in the addition of a consideration of functioning, and not merely medical severity, in children's SSI claims. Prior to Zebley, a child would only be found disabled under the SSA's definition if he or she medically met or equaled one of SSA‚Äôs listings of impairments. Following the ruling, the childhood definition of disability was changed to having ‚Äúan impairment resulting in marked and severe functional limitations.‚Äù Enrollment of disabled children on SSI dramatically increased following Zebley and its relaxation of SSA‚Äôs definition of disability for children. The case is noted as part of the trend of the liberalization of welfare benefits occurring at the time of the ruling. * 1990 ‚Äì The Americans with Disabilities Act became law, and it provided comprehensive civil rights protection for people with disabilities. Closely modeled after the Civil Rights Act and Section 504, the law was the most sweeping disability rights legislation in American history. It mandated that local, state, and federal governments and programs be accessible, that employers with more than 15 employees make ‚Äúreasonable accommodations‚Äù for workers with disabilities and not discriminate against otherwise qualified workers with disabilities, and that public accommodations and commercial facilities make ‚Äúreasonable modifications‚Äù to ensure access for disabled members of the public, and not discriminate against them. It also mandated provision of disabled-access toilet facilities in private buildings. (Provision of disabled-access toilet facilities was mandated in federal buildings by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968). The ADA also required access in public transportation and communication. * 1990 ‚Äì Sam Skinner, U.S. Secretary of Transportation, issued regulations mandating wheelchair lifts on buses. * 1990 ‚Äì Americans Disabled for Accessible Public Transit (ADAPT) organized the Wheels of Justice campaign in Washington, D.C., which drew hundreds of disabled people to support the Americans with Disabilities Act. Activists occupying the Capitol Rotunda were arrested when they refuse to leave. * 1990 ‚Äì The Committee of Ten Thousand was founded to advocate for Americans with hemophilia who were infected with HIV/AIDS through tainted blood products. * 1990 ‚Äì Perry v. Louisiana, , was a United States Supreme Court case over the legality of the forcibly medicating a death row inmate with a mental disorder in order to render him competent to be executed. The court determined that the forcible medication of individuals to render them competent to be executed is impermissible. The case was remanded to the Louisiana Supreme Court for further deliberation in view of Washington v. Harper (1990), also a case involving involuntary medication, which had been decided after the District Court's ruling. Upon remand, the lower court ruled against the forcible medication of individuals in order to maintain their competency for execution. This decision was based on the distinction that, unlike the holding in Harper v. Washington concerning involuntary medication for treatment issues, forcing medication for the purposes of execution was not medical treatment (being \\"antithetical to the basic principles of the healing arts\\") but punishment. In addition, the lower court found two state laws on which to base its holding. First it found that forcibly medicating a person for the purposes of execution was cruel and unusual punishment under Louisiana state law because \\"it fails to measurably contribute to the social goals of capital punishment\\" by adding to the individual's punishment \\"beyond that required for the mere extinguishment of life,\\" and could be \\"administered erroneously, arbitrarily or capriciously\\". It also held that forcible medication in this situation violated the right to privacy guaranteed by the Louisiana State Constitution because the inhumanity of the situation rendered the state's interest in executing a person under these conditions less compelling. * 1990 ‚Äì The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act became law in the U.S. It was meant to help communities cope with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. * 1990 ‚Äì The first Disability Pride Parade in the United States was held in Boston in 1990. The featured speaker was Karen Thompson, author of Why Can't Sharon Kowalski Come Home? The Boston Disability Pride Parade was held again in 1991, but has not been held since. It ended with the death of lead organizer, Diana Viets, and with the move of co-organizer Catherine Odette to Madison, Wisconsin. * 1990 ‚Äì In Washington v. Harper the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the involuntary medication of correctional facility inmates only under certain conditions as determined by established policy and procedures. * 1990 ‚Äì Americans Disabled for Accessible Public Transit (ADAPT) changed its focus to advocating for personal assistance services, changing its name to American Disabled for Attendant Programs Today (ADAPT). * 1990 ‚Äì The Education for All Handicapped Children Act was amended and renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). This Act contains a permanently authorized grant program that provides federal funding to the states; all states that receive these federal funds are required to provide a \\"free, appropriate public education\\" to all children with disabilities in the \\"least restrictive environment.\\" * 1990 ‚Äì Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health, , was a landmark United States Supreme Court case involving a young adult incompetent. The first \\"right to die\\" case ever heard by the Court, Cruzan was argued on December 6, 1989 and decided on June 25, 1990. In a 5‚Äì4 decision, the Court affirmed the earlier ruling of the Supreme Court of Missouri and ruled in favor of the State of Missouri, finding it was acceptable to require \\"clear and convincing evidence\\" of a patient's wishes for removal of life support. A significant outcome of the case was the creation of advance health directives. * 1991 ‚Äì In re Guardianship of Kowalski, 478 N.W.2d 790 (Minn. Ct. App. 1991), is a Minnesota Court of Appeals case that established a lesbian's partner as her legal guardian after Sharon Kowalski became incapacitated following an automobile accident. Because the case was contested by Kowalski's parents and family and initially resulted in the partner being excluded for several years from visiting Kowalski, the gay community celebrated the final resolution in favor of the partner as a victory for gay rights. * 1991 ‚Äì Prior to 1991, the Federal Medicaid program paid for services only if a person lived in an institution. The approval of Federal Medicaid Waiver programs allowed states to provide services to consumers in their homes and in their communities. * 1991 ‚Äì The Washington Court of Appeals heard a petition for sterilization brought by the parents of an incompetent child named K.M. The Court held that the sterilization of a mentally incompetent patient can be constitutional; however, the incompetent must be represented by independent counsel and the attorney must take an adversarial role in defense of the incompetent‚Äôs reproductive rights. Two physicians testified in support of K.M.‚Äôs psychological need for sterilization, however; the Court held that K.M.'s attorney did not take an adversarial role because the physicians and witnesses should have been cross examined, and every argument in defense of K.M. should have made. The Appeals Court ‚Äúremanded for a new hearing, with counsel appointed to represent K.M.‚Äù * 1991 ‚Äì In Massachusetts, the Appeals Court affirmed the substituted consent standard and wrote that \\"the guardian's petition\\" to authorize an abortion for their borderline retarded daughter \\"should have been allowed.\\" * 1991 ‚Äì Detectable warnings have been required for the edges of rail platforms in the United States since 1991. * 1992 ‚Äì Amendments to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 were infused with the philosophy of independent living. * 1992 ‚Äì In Greer vs. Rome City School District (11th Circuit Court, 1992), the U.S. Eleventh Circuit Court stated \\"Before the school district may conclude that a handicapped child should be educated outside of the regular classroom it must consider whether supplemental aids and services would permit satisfactory education in the regular classroom.\\" The court also said that the district cannot refuse to serve a child because of added cost, and that school officials must share placement considerations with the child's parents at the IEP meeting before a placement is determined. * 1992 ‚Äì In Foucha v. Louisiana, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the continued commitment of an insanity acquittee who was not suffering from a mental illness was unconstitutional. * 1992 ‚Äì In Riggins v. Nevada, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a defendant has the right to refuse psychiatric medication which is given to mitigate their psychiatric symptoms while they are on trial. * 1993 ‚Äì The American Indian Disability Legislation Project was established to collect data on Native American disability rights laws and regulations. * 1993 ‚Äì Robert Williams was appointed Commissioner of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities. He was the first developmentally disabled person to be named the Commissioner. * 1993 ‚Äì In Holland v. Sacramento City Unified School District, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court affirmed the right of disabled children to attend public school classes with non- disabled children. The ruling was a major victory in the ongoing effort to ensure enforcement of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. * 1993 ‚Äì 3 men were convicted of sexually assaulting a mentally retarded woman in New Jersey, despite attempts by the prosecution to depict the young woman as an aggressive \\"Lolita\\". * 1993 ‚Äì The U.S. Congress explicitly authorized the creation of special needs trusts so that people with disabilities could maintain their public benefits and also have access to other funds. * 1993 ‚Äì The Superior Court of Pennsylvania held that a mentally incompetent patient may be sterilized without her informed consent if there is clear and convincing evidence the sterilization is in her best interest. * 1993 ‚Äì In Heller v. Doe, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the procedures Kentucky had for involuntarily committing mentally retarded people did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The Court declared that because retarded persons are not a suspect classification, Kentucky's statute should only receive rational basis scrutiny. * 1993 ‚Äì In Oberti vs. Board of Education of the Borough of Clementon School District (3rd Circuit Court, 1993), the U.S. Third Circuit Court upheld the right of Rafael Oberti, a boy with Down syndrome, to receive his education in his regular neighborhood school with adequate and necessary supports, placing the burden of proof for compliance with IDEA's mainstreaming requirements on the school district and the state rather than on the family. The federal judge who decided the case endorsed full inclusion, writing \\"Inclusion is a right, not a special privilege for a select few.\\" * 1993 ‚Äì The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 became law in the U.S., and it required states with disabled service agencies to have them act as disabled voter registration agencies as well. * 1993 ‚Äì In the case Mavis v. Sobol, a New York court found school efforts for placement in a regular classroom were inadequate because the school had not provided a behavior management plan or training for staff to help modify the regular curriculum to meet the student's needs. * 1993 ‚Äì Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 389 (1993), was a landmark decision in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that if a defendant was competent to stand trial, they were automatically competent to plead guilty, and thereby waive the panoply of trial rights, including the right to counsel. * 1993 ‚Äì Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District, , was a case before the United States Supreme Court. A deaf child and his parents sued the Catalina Foothills Unified School District in Arizona because the district refused to provide a sign language interpreter for the child after he transferred from a public school to Salpointe Catholic High School, a parochial school. Plaintiffs challenged the refusal to provide an interpreter on a variety of constitutional and statutory grounds, including the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\\"IDEA\\"),20 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1400‚Äì1485 (1988). its Arizona counterpart,ARIZ. REV. STAT. ANN. ¬ß¬ß 15‚Äì761 to 15‚Äì772 (1991 & Supp. 1993). an IDEA regulation,34 C.F.R. ¬ß 76.532(a)(1) (1992). the Arizona Constitution,ARIZ. CONST. art. II, ¬ß 12. and the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs successfully sought relief from a federal district court, which concluded \\"The service at issue in this case is part of a general government program that distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as 'handicapped' under the IDEA, without regard to the 'sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature' of the school the child attends\\". In a 5‚Äì4 decision, the Supreme Court reached the same issue, but reversed on the merits, finding that if it provided an interpreter the school district would not violate the Establishment Clause. * 1994 ‚Äì The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act expanded the scope of required FBI data to include hate crimes based on disability, and the FBI began collecting data on disability bias crimes on January 1, 1997. In 1996, Congress permanently reauthorized the Act. * 1994 ‚Äì Stephanie Keene was born at Fairfax Hospital in Virginia, the United States. At the time of her birth, she was missing most of her brain, including the cortex; only the brainstem, the portion of the brain responsible for autonomic and regulatory functions, such as the control of respiration, the heartbeat and blood pressure, had developed during pregnancy. When baby Keene was admitted to the hospital at six months of age for severe respiratory problems, the hospital filed a legal motion to appoint a guardian for the child's care and sought a court order that the hospital did not need to provide any services beyond palliative care. At trial, several experts testified that providing ventilator support to an anencephalic infant (as Keene was) went beyond the accepted standard of medical care.Matter of Baby K., 16 F. 3d 590 (4th Cir. 1994). In contrast, the baby's mother argued her case on the grounds of religious freedom and the sanctity of life. In 1994, in a controversial ruling, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia decided that the hospital caring for Keene must put her on a mechanical ventilator whenever she had trouble breathing. The court interpreted the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) to require continued ventilation for the infant. The wording of this act requires that patients who present with a medical emergency must get \\"such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition\\" before the patient is transferred to another facility. The court refused to take a moral or ethical position on the issue, insisting that it was only interpreting the laws as they existed. As a result of the decision, Keene was kept alive much longer than most anencephalic babies. It has been suggested by the dissenting judge in the case that the court should have used the condition anencephaly as the basis of the case, not the recurring subsidiary symptoms of respiratory distress. As the irreversibility of anencephaly is widely understood in the medical community, he argued that the decision to continue futile care only resulted in the repetitive diversion of medical equipment. * 1994 ‚Äì 1998: Study 329 was a clinical trial conducted in North America from 1994 to 1998 to study the efficacy of paroxetine, an SSRI anti-depressant, in treating 12- to 18-year-olds diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Led by Martin Keller, then professor of psychiatry at Brown University, and funded by the British pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham‚Äîknown since 2000 as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)‚Äîthe study compared paroxetine with imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, and placebo (an inert pill). SmithKline Beecham had released paroxetine in 1991, marketing it as Paxil in North America and Seroxat in the UK. The drug attracted sales of $11.7 billion in the United States alone from 1997 to 2006, including $2.12 billion in 2002, the year before it lost its patent. Published in July 2001 in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (JAACAP), which listed Keller and 21 other researchers as co-authors, study 329 became controversial when it was discovered that the article had been ghostwritten by a PR firm hired by SmithKline Beecham; had made inappropriate claims about the drug's efficacy; and had downplayed safety concerns. The controversy led to several lawsuits and strengthened calls for drug companies to disclose all their clinical research data. * 1995 ‚Äì Justice for All was organized by Justin Dart and others in Washington, D.C., in order to advocate against calls to amend or repeal the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. * 1995 ‚Äì The American Association of People with Disabilities was founded in Washington, D.C. * 1995 ‚Äì The state of Kansas passed a law (Kan. Stat. Ann. ¬ß 22-3220) which revoked the traditional insanity defense. Defendants could no longer argue that, because of their mental illness, they were incapable of deciding right from wrong. Instead, defendants suffering from mental illness were only permitted to argue that their mental illness prevented them from forming the specific intent (or mens rea) needed to commit the crime. * 1995 ‚Äì The American film When Billy Broke His Head... and Other Tales of Wonder, by Billy Golfus, premiered on PBS. It highlighted the disability rights movement. * 1995 ‚Äì The U.S. Court of Appeals, Third Circuit, ruled in Helen L. v. Snider that continued institutionalization of a disabled Pennsylvania woman, when not medically necessary and where there was the option of home care, was a violation of her rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Disability rights advocates perceived this ruling as a landmark decision regarding the rights of people in nursing homes to personal assistance services. * 1995 ‚Äì Sandra Jensen was denied a heart-lung transplant by the Stanford University School of Medicine in California because she had Down syndrome. After pressure from disability rights activists, Stanford U School of Medicine administrators reversed their decision. In 1996, Jensen became the first person with Down syndrome to receive a heart-lung transplant. * 1995 ‚Äì The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (CAA) became law in the U.S., and it required all offices in the legislative branch to make their public services, programs, activities, and places of public accommodation accessible to members of the public who have disabilities, as well as declaring that employees of Congress cannot be discriminated against in personnel actions because of a disability. * 1996 ‚Äì The Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 (MHPA) became law in the U.S. and it required that large group health plans not impose annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental health benefits that are less favorable than any such limits imposed on medical/surgical benefits. * 1996 ‚Äì Paralyzed Veterans of America v. Ellerbe Becket Architects and Engineers, one of the first major Americans with Disabilities Act lawsuits, was focused on the wheelchair accessibility of a stadium project that was still in the design phase, MCI Center in Washington, D.C. Previous to this case, which was filed only five years after the ADA was passed, the DOJ was unable or unwilling to provide clarification on the distribution requirements for accessible wheelchair locations in large assembly spaces. While Section 4.33.3 of ADAAG makes reference to lines of sight, no specific reference is made to seeing over standing patrons. The MCI Center, designed by Ellerbe Becket Architects & Engineers, was designed with too few wheelchair and companion seats, and the ones that were included did not provide sight lines that would enable the wheelchair user to view the playing area while the spectators in front of them were standing. This case and another related case established precedent on seat distribution and sight lines issues for ADA enforcement that continues to present day. * 1996 ‚Äì Not Dead Yet was formed by American disability rights advocates to oppose those who support assisted suicide for people with disabilities. It focuses on opposing rationing health care to people with severe disabilities and opposing the imposition of ‚Äúdo not resuscitate‚Äù (DNR) orders for disabled people in hospitals, schools, and nursing homes. * 1996 ‚Äì Cooper v. Oklahoma, 517 U.S. 348 (1996), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court reversed an Oklahoma court decision holding that a defendant is presumed to be competent to stand trial unless he proves otherwise by the second highest legal standard of proof, that of clear and convincing evidence, ruling that to be unconstitutional. The court said the defendant's Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process were violated. * 1997 ‚Äì Kansas v. Hendricks, , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court set forth procedures for the indefinite civil commitment of prisoners convicted of a sex offense whom the state deems dangerous due to a mental abnormality. * 1997 ‚Äì The Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act of 1997 enacted , which requires campus security authorities to collect and report data on hate crimes committed on the basis of disability, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. * 1998 ‚Äì The Veterans Programs Enhancement Act became law in the U.S., and it required a cost-of-living adjustment in rates of compensation paid to veterans with service-connected disabilities, as well as various improvements in education, housing, and cemetery programs of the Department of Veterans Affairs. * 1998 ‚Äì The first support group for sexual minorities with developmental disabilities was created in 1998 at the New Haven Gay & Lesbian Community Center in Connecticut. * 1998 ‚Äì The Persian Gulf War Veterans Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-277) became law in the U.S., and it required the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to determine, based on National Academy of Sciences‚Äô Institute of Medicine (IOM) reports, whether particular illnesses warrant a presumption of service connection and, if so, to set compensation regulations establishing such a connection for each illness. * 1998 ‚Äì Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 523 U.S. 637 (1998), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that did not apply to a petition that raises only a competency to be executed claim and that respondent did not, therefore, need authorization to file his petition in the District Court. * 1998 ‚Äì The Michigan Supreme Court held that a probate court has jurisdiction to hear a petition by a guardian for authorization to consent to an extraordinary procedure, including sterilization, if the procedure is in the ward's best interest. * 1998 ‚Äì The case Connecticut vs. Kenneth Curtis changed the views in the justice system of mental competence to stand trial. Prior to this case, those given such an assessment were viewed as not restorable, and charges would be dismissed in favor of periodic reviews used only in determining the need for a civil commitment. * 1998 ‚Äì In Bragdon v. Abbott, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the definition of disability includes asymptomatic HIV. Also in that case, the U.S. Supreme Court held that reproduction does qualify as a major life activity according to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. * 1998 ‚Äì In Jervon Lamont Herbin v. Commonwealth of Virginia (1998), Herbin appealed his convictions of malicious wounding, two counts of forcible sodomy, abduction, and attempted rape. The appeals court held that a \\"settled insanity\\" defense requires substantial evidence of not only long-term and heavy substance abuse, but convincing evidence of a mental disorder that is caused by long-term substance abuse. In Herbin, the court found that > \\"The weight of authority in this country recognizes an insanity defense that > is based on a mental disease or defect produced by long-term substance > abuse.\\" Commonwealth v. Herd, 413 Mass. 834, 604 N.E.2d 1294, 1299 (1992). > At the same time, \\"evidence of mere narcotics addiction, standing alone and > without other physiological or psychological involvement, raises no issue of > such a mental defect or disease as can serve as a basis for the insanity > defense.\\" United States v. Lyons, 731 F.2d 243, 245 (5th Cir.1984) (citing > cases). Although appellant produced evidence of long-term and severe drug > abuse, he did not present any evidence that he was suffering from any mental > disease as a result of this drug abuse. See Hooks v. State, 534 So.2d 329, > 353 (Ala.Crim.App.1987), aff'd sub nom. Ex parte Hooks, 534 So.2d 371 > (Ala.1988). ‚Äì See more at: https://caselaw.findlaw.com/va-court-of- > appeals/1349937.html#sthash.YduwJJE7.dpuf Although Herbin did provide evidence of substantial drug abuse in the past, he was unable to provide expert witness testimony of any mental disorder. The court held that the substance abuse did not serve as evidence for a \\"settled insanity\\" defense alone without the link to a mental disorder. No lay witnesses testified as to any behavior consistent with insanity, even if lay testimony were admissible to establish the insanity defense in Virginia. Also, although Herbin did provide an extensive history of drug and sexual abuse, the court said no evidence showed either of these issues were causes or results of a mental disorder. Therefore, the appeals court upheld his conviction. * 1998 ‚Äì In Pennsylvania Department of Corrections v. Yeskey, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the Americans with Disabilities Act includes state prisons. * 1998 ‚Äì President Clinton signed into law the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Amendments, which includes Section 508. Section 508 \\"requires access to the Federal government's electronic and information technology. The law covers all types of electronic and information technology in the Federal sector and is not limited to assistive technologies used by people with disabilities.\\" * 1998 ‚Äì Title four of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 in order to work with the WIA to accomplish the goal of helping people return to the workforce. Title four created a national council on disability, appointed by the president, to link rehabilitation programs to state and local workforce development systems. However, the Workforce Investment Act was repealed and replaced by the 2014 Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. * 1998 ‚Äì No person shall be deprived of any right because of race, religion, national origin, or physical disability. ‚Äì Florida Constitution, Article I, ¬ß2 (1998). * 1999 ‚Äì In 1999, Jack Kevorkian was arrested and tried for his direct role in a case of voluntary euthanasia of a disabled person (Thomas Youk, who had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.) Kevorkian was convicted of second-degree murder and served eight years of a 10-to-25-year prison sentence. He was released on parole on June 1, 2007, on condition he would not offer advice nor participate nor be present in the act of any type of suicide involving euthanasia to any other person; as well as neither promote nor talk about the procedure of assisted suicide.Monica Davey. \\"Kevorkian Speaks After His Release From Prison\\". The New York Times. June 4, 2007. * 1999 ‚Äì In Carolyn C. Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corporation, et. al., the U.S. Supreme Court decided that people receiving Social Security disability benefits are protected against discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act if and when they are able to return to work. * 1999 ‚Äì In Olmstead v. L.C., the U.S. Supreme Court decided that individuals with mental disabilities must be offered services in the most integrated setting possible. * 1999 ‚Äì The Works Incentives Improvement Act (Ticket to Work) became law in the U.S., allowing those who require health care benefits to work. * 1999 ‚Äì In Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F., the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that taxpayer-supported schools are responsible for the costs of providing continual care for disabled students under a federal law that says all children must receive \\"free, appropriate public education.\\" Under the Court's reading of the IDEA's relevant provisions, medical treatments such as suctioning, ventilator checks, catheterization, and others which can be administered by non-physician personnel come within the parameters of the special education law's related services. * 1999 ‚Äì The United States Social Security Administration's Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program is the centerpiece of the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999; this free and voluntary program supports career development for people who receive Social Security disability benefits. The Ticket program helps move eligible beneficiaries toward financial independence by connecting them with service providers to receive employment-related services and supports to succeed in the workforce. Anyone who is age 18 through 64 and receives Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act and/or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments under Title XVI of the Social Security Act is eligible for the Ticket program. * 1999 ‚Äì The Texas Advance Directives Act (1999), also known as the Texas Futile Care Law, describes certain provisions that are now Chapter 166 of the Texas Health & Safety Code. Controversy over these provisions mainly centers on Section 166.046, Subsection (e), which allows a health care facility to discontinue life-sustaining treatment ten days after giving written notice if the continuation of life-sustaining treatment is considered futile care by the treating medical team. Although it is often stated that the act is officially named as the 'Futile Care Law' or the 'Futile Care Act', that is in fact incorrect and the statute has never legally had that title. * 1999 ‚Äì Barden v. The City of Sacramento, filed in March 1999, claimed that the City of Sacramento failed to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act when, while making public street improvements, it did not bring its sidewalks into compliance with the ADA. Certain issues were resolved in Federal Court. One issue, whether sidewalks were covered by the ADA, was appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that sidewalks were a \\"program\\" under ADA and must be made accessible to persons with disabilities. The ruling was later appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case, letting stand the ruling of the 9th Circuit Court.Barden v. Sacramento from Disability Rights Advocates * 1999 ‚Äì Bates v. UPS (begun in 1999) was the first equal opportunity employment class action brought on behalf of deaf and hard of hearing workers throughout the country concerning workplace discrimination. It established legal precedence for deaf and hard of hearing employees and customers to be fully covered under the ADA. Key findings included # UPS failed to address communication barriers and to ensure equal conditions and opportunities for deaf employees; # Deaf employees were routinely excluded from workplace information, denied opportunities for promotion, and exposed to unsafe conditions due to lack of accommodations by UPS; # UPS also lacked a system to alert these employees as to emergencies, such as fires or chemical spills, to ensure that they would safely evacuate their facility; and # UPS had no policy to ensure that deaf applicants and employees actually received effective communication in the workplace. The outcome was that UPS agreed to pay a $5.8 million award and agreed to a comprehensive accommodations program that was implemented in their facilities throughout the country. * 1999 ‚Äì Kendra's Law, effective since November 1999, is a New York State law concerning involuntary outpatient commitment. It grants judges the authority to issue orders that require people who meet certain criteria to regularly undergo psychiatric treatment. Failure to comply could result in commitment for up to 72 hours. Kendra's Law does not require that patients are forced to take medication. * 1999 ‚Äì In the case Albertsons Inc. v. Kirkingburg, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that not everyone with any sort of physical problem is per se \\"disabled\\" under the Americans with Disabilities Act ‚Äì rather, people must prove they are disabled by showing that their problem substantially affects a major life activity. As well, such an effect could be mitigated by medicine or devices, and the body's own ability to correct itself. 2000s * 2000 ‚Äì The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 became law. * 2001 ‚Äì Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case about Congress's enforcement powers under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court decided that Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act was unconstitutional, insofar as it allowed states to be sued by private citizens for money damages. * 2001 ‚Äì The Commonwealth of Virginia House of Delegates approved a resolution expressing regret for its eugenics practices between 1924 and 1979. * 2001 ‚Äì Detectable warnings for pedestrian curb cuts were suspended for study in 1994, and became officially required in 2001. * 2001 ‚Äì The United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas found that the Texas Department of Corrections was in compliance on the issue of use of force against inmates and had adequate policies and procedures in place. However, the court continued to have issues with the \\"current and ongoing constitutional violations regarding administrative segregation [in] the conditions of confinement and the practice of using administrative segregation to house mentally ill inmates\\" that it found. * 2001 ‚Äì In PGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin (00-24) 532 U.S. 661, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, by its plain terms, prohibited the PGA from denying Casey Martin equal access to its tours on the basis of his disability (a degenerative circulatory disorder preventing him from walking golf courses) and that allowing Martin to use a golf cart, despite the walking rule, was not a modification that would \\"fundamentally alter the nature\\" of the game. * 2001 ‚Äì Penry v. Johnson, 532 U.S. 782 (2001), is a United States Supreme Court case which concerned whether instructions given to a Texas jury were constitutionally adequate to emphasize the mitigating factors in sentencing of mental retardation. The Texas courts had determined the sentencing instructions were consistent with prior Supreme Court jurisprudence, but the Court in a divided decision reversed, finding the sentencing instructions insufficient. This was the second time Penry's case made it to the Supreme Court. * 2002 ‚Äì On May 2, 2002, Virginia Governor Mark R. Warner issued a statement expressing \\"profound regret for the commonwealth's role in the eugenics movement,\\" specifically naming Virginia's 1924 compulsory sterilization legislation, which includes though is not limited to the Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924. * 2002 ‚Äì Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002),. was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States interpreted the meaning of the phrase \\"substantially impairs\\" as used in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. It reversed the decision by the Court of Appeals to grant a partial summary judgment in favor of the respondent, Ella Williams, that had qualified her inability to perform manual job-related tasks as a disability. * 2002 ‚Äì In Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002), the U. S. Supreme Court ruled 6‚Äì3 that executing the mentally retarded violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. * 2002 ‚Äì Carol Carr, an American woman from the state of Georgia, became the center of a widely publicized debate over euthanasia when in 2002 she killed her two adult sons because they were suffering from Huntington's disease.Rimer, Sarah. A Deadly Disease Destroys Patients and Families, June 24, 2002\\"Life, be not too proud ; A caregiver's final act of motherly love,\\" Chicago Tribune, July 5, 2002. Carr pleaded guilty to assisted suicide and was sentenced to 5 years in prison. After serving 21 months, she was released on parole in 2004. The parole board mandated that if Carr's surviving son, James, should become ill with Huntington's disease, she will be prohibited from serving as his primary caregiver. They also stipulated that Carr must receive mental-health counseling during her period of supervision.\\"Mother convicted in mercy killings is granted parole\\" Atlanta Journal-Constitution, February 4, 2004 Unfortunately, Carol's youngest son, James Scott, was diagnosed with Huntington's in 2005. Carr was not allowed to be his caregiver. * 2002 ‚Äì Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co. was a decision of the United States District Court on 18 August 2002. It concerned the nature of Title III of Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The court determined that Southwest Airlines website is not a ‚Äúplace of public accommodation‚Äù as defined in Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The case determined that the Southwest Airlines internet website was not in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is concerned with physical existences and hence cannot govern things that are in cyberspace. Judge Seitz also explained that the ‚Äúvirtual ticket counter‚Äù Southwest Airlines Co‚Äôs website was a virtual construct and hence not a ‚Äúpublic place of accommodation‚Äù and as such ‚ÄúTo expand the ADA to cover \\"virtual\\" spaces would be to create new rights without well-defined standards\\". * 2002 ‚Äì The New Freedom Commission on Mental Health was established by U.S. President George W. Bush through on April 29, 2002 to conduct a comprehensive study of the U.S. mental health service delivery system and make recommendations based on its findings. The commission has been touted as part of his commitment to eliminate inequality for Americans with disabilities. Opponents of the plan questioned the motives of the commission, largely from a civil liberties perspective, asserting the initiative campaign was little more than a thinly veiled proxy for the pharmaceutical industry, which, in its pursuit of profits, is too eager to foster psychotropic medication interventions. Some opponents contended that its objectives are to foster chemical behavior control of American citizens. However, no commission recommendations specifically called for increased drug use and the commission did call for closer scrutiny of psychiatric drug treatment, months before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) started taking these steps in the wake of reports of increased rates of suicide, especially during the first months of drug use. * 2002 ‚Äì The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) became law in the U.S., and it required voting \\"systems\\" to be accessible for all those with disabilities, including special assistance for blind or otherwise visually impaired voters. * 2002 ‚Äì A New York County Court authorized the sterilization of a mentally retarded woman who gave informed consent to the procedure. * 2002 ‚Äì Laura's Law is a California state law that allows for court-ordered assisted outpatient treatment. To qualify for the program, the person must have a serious mental illness plus a recent history of psychiatric hospitalizations, jailings or acts, threats or attempts of serious violent behavior towards [self] or others. A complete functional outline of the legal procedures and safeguards within Laura‚Äôs Law has been prepared by NAMI San Mateo. The measure passed the California Legislature in 2002 and was signed into law by Governor Gray Davis. The statute can only be utilized in counties that choose to enact outpatient commitment programs based on the measure. As of 2010, Nevada County has fully implemented the law and Los Angeles County has a pilot project. * 2002 ‚Äì Kansas v. Crane, is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the Kansas Sexually Violent Predator Act (SVPA) as consistent with substantive due process. The Court clarified that its earlier holding in Kansas v. Hendricks did not set forth a requirement of total or complete lack of control, but noted that the Constitution does not permit commitment of a sex offender without some lack-of-control determination. * 2003 ‚Äì The U.S. Supreme Court decision Sell v. United States imposed stringent limits on the right of a lower court to order the forcible administration of antipsychotic medication to a criminal defendant who had been determined to be incompetent to stand trial for the sole purpose of making them competent and able to be tried. * 2003 ‚Äì On September 17, 2003, the Free Our People March ended, with marchers arriving in the nation's capitol from Pennsylvania, to advocate for MiCASSA, full implementation of the U.S. Supreme Court's Olmstead v. L.C. decision, Money Following the Person legislation, and Medicaid reform other than block grants. * 2003 ‚Äì In Hornstine v. Township of Moorestown Blair Hornstine, then a high school senior, successfully sued her school district, which had said she was able to get a higher grade point average because she had been home-schooled at times because of an immune-system illness and, as a result, had taken more advanced placement courses and fewer low-rated physical education courses. Arguing that she had the highest grades and should not have to share the top honors in her class, Blair won the right to be sole valedictorian. * 2003 ‚Äì The Disability History Association was founded; it is an affiliated society of the American History Association. * 2003 ‚Äì On February 10, 2003, United States Department of Health and Human Services secretary Tommy G. Thompson announced a limited program in Alabama that would fund in-home services for Nick Dupree and 29 others who were turning 21 shortly; previously Dupree had organized \\"Nick's Crusade\\", a campaign which attempted to gain continued in-home services for Alabamians with disabilities who are over the age of 21. * 2004 ‚Äì The Assistive Technology Act of 2004 required states to provide direct aid to individuals with disabilities to ensure they have access to the technology they need. As a result, the majority of state efforts are required to be conducted in the following areas: assistive technology reutilization programs, assistive technology demonstration programs, alternative financing programs and device loan programs. * 2004 ‚Äì On October 30, 2004, President George W. Bush signed into law the \\"Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment Act,\\" Public Law 108-406. The bill authorized funding for its Healthy Athletes, Education, and Worldwide Expansion programs. * 2004 ‚Äì Hangarter v. Provident Insurance Company, 373 F.3d 998 (9th Cir. 2004), (UnumProvident, now referred to as Unum or Unum GroupUnum News Release, \\"UnumProvident Corp. Now Unum Group\\" (March 2, 2007)), is a landmark decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on the issue of disability bad faith insurance law. Because California‚Äôs bad faith insurance law is often referred to in many states as a model nationwide, the 9th Circuit‚Äôs decision has a persuasive impact throughout the country.The Rutter Group, \\"Insurance Litigation\\", \\"Federal Ninth Circuit Civil Appellate Practice\\", \\"Federal Civil Trials and Evidence\\" Affirming in part and reversing in part the district court's opinion in Hangarter v. Paul Revere Life Insurance Company, the 9th Circuit ruled the defendant insurance company, UnumProvident, engaged in biased and bad faith claims handling and investigation. This case marked a milestone victory for disabled claimants who were rejected because disability insurers were basing their decisions on an improper definition of total disability. The 9th Circuit made it clear that California law controls the definition of this crucial phrase in disability policies. Hangarter v. Provident is also a landmark decision in the area of admissibility of expert testimony, under the Daubert factors laid out by the Supreme Court. With experts on insurance claims practices, the Daubert factors will not preclude the kind of testimony whose reliability depends on the knowledge and experience of the expert, rather than the theory or technical framework behind it. Hangarter gave several important findings of law that aid disabled claimants. First, futile attempts to return to an occupation are insufficient to reverse a jury‚Äôs determination of total disability under California law. Total disability may still be found, even if an insured was able to do some work under her occupation. The guiding focus is whether an insured was unable to perform the substantial and material duties of her own occupation in the usual and customary way with reasonable continuity. Second, the 9th Circuit affirmed that recovery under total disability is not precluded because an insured was able to generate income during her disability. Disability insurance is designed not as insurance against loss of income, but as a substitute for earnings when an insured is deprived of the capacity to earn an income. Third, repeated use of a medical examiner overcomes any presumption that an insurance company‚Äôs denial of a claim is a genuine dispute. The practice of using the same medical examiner when claims are being rejected evinces bad faith on the part of the insurance company. * 2004 ‚Äì The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA 2004) became law; it is a United States law that mandates equity, accountability and excellence in education for children with disabilities. * 2004 ‚Äì Archuleta v. Hedrick, 365 F.3d 644 (8th Cir. 2004) was a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in October 2002, appealing the dismissal of a case brought by defendant Benjamin Archuleta. Archuleta had been found not guilty by reason of insanity of assault and subsequently ordered to be confined in a prison mental hospital by the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri after his successful insanity defense, as he was evaluated by a psychiatrist as dangerous. His appeal challenged this confinement and \\"forced treatment\\", requested a withdrawal of his original insanity defense, and sought his unconditional release from custody. The appellate court reversed the lower court's dismissal of the habeas corpus petition, saying that habeas corpus is a last resort remedy available to those without any other, and the case was remanded back to that court with the instructions to transfer the petition to another district court, the United States District Court for the District of Utah. * 2004 ‚Äì Jesse KoochinSocial Security Death Index, 1935‚Äì2014. Social Security Administration. was a 6-year-old American boy who became the center of a legal battle between his parents, Steve and Gayle Koochin, and Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City. On September 15, 2004, Jesse developed respiratory problems and was taken to Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City and placed on a ventilator. On October 8, \\"his tumor pushed his brain stem down through the skull,\\" and he was in an unresponsive coma. Subsequently, two physicians independently examined him on October 11 and 12 and determined that the child was brain dead. The hospital informed his parents that they would order life support removed within 24 hours. However, the Koochins rejected the hospital's definition of death. Instead, relying on traditional notions of cardiopulmonary death, they filed for an immediate restraining order to keep Koochin on a ventilator and to receive other treatment. They declared that he had been in a \\"similar coma\\" from May 23, 2004 to July 11, 2004 and had successfully awakened, and also claimed that the hospital staff did not perform an EEG exam or cerebral perfusion study to test for brain activity. The Utah judge granted the restraining order on October 13 and ruled that the hospital would be allowed to declare him brain dead without performing the two tests. On October 15, the parents removed the brain-dead child from the hospital and put him under hospice care at their temporary home in Salt Lake City. Koochin's heart ultimately stopped beating on November 19, 2004. The landmark case was the first documented instance in the United States in which parents attempted to opt out of legally accepted standards of death. * 2004 ‚Äì Ewing v. Goldstein (Cal. Ct. App. 2004) is a landmark court case that extended California mental health professional's duty to protect identifiable victims of potentially violent persons, as established by Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California, to include acting upon communications from third parties that indicate a possible threat. * 2004 ‚Äì In Tennessee v. Lane, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Americans with Disabilities Act did not violate the sovereign immunity doctrine of the 11th Amendment when, based on Congress's 14th Amendment enforcement powers of the Due Process clause, it allowed individuals to sue states for denying them services based on their disabilities. The Court held that Congress had sufficiently demonstrated the problems faced by disabled persons who sought to exercise fundamental rights protected by the Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment (such as access to a court). The Court also emphasized that the remedies required from the states were not unreasonable ‚Äì they just had to make reasonable accommodations to allow disabled persons to exercise their fundamental rights. The Court thus held that because Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act was a \\"reasonable prophylactic measure, reasonably targeted to a legitimate end,\\" and because Congress had the authority under the 14th Amendment to regulate the actions of the states to accomplish that end, the law was constitutional. * 2004 ‚Äì The first Chicago Disability Pride Parade was the first Disability Pride Parade in the United States after the Boston-based parades of the 1990s. It was held on July 18, 2004. The first Chicago parade was funded with $10,000 in seed money that Sarah Triano received in 2003 as part of the Paul G. Hearne Leadership award from the American Association of People with Disabilities. According to Triano, fifteen hundred people attended the parade. Yoshiko Dart was the parade marshal. * 2005 ‚Äì The California Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) became California law in 2005 after the voters passed Proposition 63. Funded through a 1 percent tax on personal incomes in excess of $1 million, the MHSA established a broad continuum of community-based prevention, early intervention, and other services for Californians with severe mental illnesses. The California Department of Mental Health administers the act, and counties and their contracted agencies provide the direct consumer services. * 2005 ‚Äì In Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd., the U.S. Supreme Court held that Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act applied to foreign- flagged cruise ships in U.S. waters. * 2005 ‚Äì The Terri Schiavo case was a right-to-die legal case in the United States from 1990 to 2005, involving Theresa Marie \\"Terri\\" Schiavo (December 3, 1963 ‚Äì March 31, 2005), a woman in an irreversible persistent vegetative state. Schiavo's husband and legal guardian argued that Schiavo would not have wanted prolonged artificial life support without the prospect of recovery, and elected to remove her feeding tube. Schiavo's parents disputed her husband's assertions and challenged Schiavo's medical diagnosis, arguing in favor of continuing artificial nutrition and hydration. The highly publicized and prolonged series of legal challenges presented by her parents, which ultimately involved state and federal politicians up to the level of President George W. Bush, caused a seven-year delay before Schiavo's feeding tube was ultimately removed in 2005, after which she died that same year. * 2005 ‚Äì Peggy S. Salters, from South Carolina, became the first survivor of electroshock treatment in the United States to win a jury verdict and a large money judgment ($635,177) in compensation for extensive permanent amnesia and cognitive disability caused by the procedure. * 2005 ‚Äì In Campbell v. General Dynamics Gov't Sys. Corp., the First Circuit Court of the U.S. had to consider the enforceability of a mandatory arbitration agreement, contained in a dispute resolution policy linked to an e-mailed company-wide announcement, insofar as it applied to employment discrimination claims brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Under the Court's analysis, the question turned on whether the employer provided minimally sufficient notice of the contractual nature of the e-mailed policy and of the concomitant waiver of an employee's right to access a judicial forum. The Court weighed the attendant circumstances and concluded that the notice was wanting and that, therefore, enforcement of the waiver would be inappropriate; thus the Court upheld the district court's denial of the employer's motion to stay proceedings and compel the employee to submit his claim to arbitration. The case is a principal case in the Rothstein, Liebman employment law casebook.Sixth edition Foundation Press Page 59 * 2005 ‚Äì On November 14, 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. 49, that it is the party which requests a hearing under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act who has the burden of proof in such an action. * 2005 ‚Äì The Sun Hudson case concerned Wanda Hudson and her infant son, who in 2005 was allowed to die via removal of his breathing tube, contrary to her wishes. Bioethicists note that the case is the first time a U.S. hospital has been allowed to remove life sustaining support contrary to the wishes of the legal guardian and lacking advance directives from the patient themselves. This, the bioethicists claim, makes the issue precedent-setting in further cases where it may be applied. * 2005 ‚Äì Spiro Nikolouzos was a Texas man incapacitated from bleeding related to a cerebral shunt, whose care was the subject of an appeal of The Texas Futile Care Law. Nikolouzos was hospitalized on February 10, 2005, at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, Houston, Texas, and was in a persistent vegetative state. He was fed through a gastric feeding tube and respirated by a ventilator. The hospital wished to discontinue life support, allowing Nikolouzos to die. His family opposed this action and claimed the hospital's decision was related to the fact that Nikolouzos's Medicare funding was running out, a contention denied by the hospital. Under the 1999 Advance Directives Act (also known as The Texas Futile Care Law), the hospital may override the family's wishes in such a matter should an ethics committee clear such an action. However, Nikolouzos's family won an emergency injunction preventing the removal of the life support apparatus, and on March 21, 2005, Spiro Nikolouzos was removed to Avalon Place Nursing Home in San Antonio, Texas. Avalon Place had rejected his application nine days earlier. Nikolouzos subsequently died at Avalon on May 30, 2005. The precedent set by the case of Sun Hudson may have helped to expedite the removal of Nikolouzos from artificial respiration prior to the move. * 2005 ‚Äì In Bigby v. Dretke 402 F.3d 551 (5th Cir. 2005), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit struck down jury instructions in death penalty cases that do not ask about mitigating factors including a consideration of the defendant's social, medical, and psychological history, saying that the jury must be instructed to consider mitigating factors even when answering unrelated questions. This ruling suggests that an expanded explanation including these factors be given in the jury instructions to insure the jury weighs all the mitigating factors. This ruling also established that a defendant's mental disorder must be considered as a mitigating factor in sentencing in a death penalty case, even if mental illness was not brought up in the trial. * 2006 ‚Äì On April 19, 2006, it was announced that after nearly 5 years, Duane Reade, a chain of drugstores primarily located in New York City, finally agreed to settle with Disabled In Action to make all of its stores ADA-compliant. * 2006 ‚Äì The Ashley Treatment refers to a controversial set of medical procedures undergone by a disabled Seattle child, \\"Ashley X\\". Ashley, born in 1997, had severe developmental disabilities due to static encephalopathy of unknown etiology; she was assumed to be at an infant level mentally and physically. The treatment included growth attenuation via estrogen therapy; hysterectomy, bilateral breast bud removal, and appendectomy. The principal purpose of the treatment was to improve Ashley's quality of life by limiting her growth in size, eliminating menstrual cramps and bleeding, and preventing discomfort from large breasts. In July 2004, Ashley had a hysterectomy (to prevent menstruation) and surgical removal of her nascent breast buds (to prevent development). She also underwent an appendectomy. The surgery was performed at Seattle's Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center. In addition, in December 2006 she completed estrogen therapy through dermal patches, which sped up the natural closure of her growth plates. The combination of the surgery and the estrogen therapy attracted much public comment and ethical analysis in early 2007, both supportive and condemning. * 2006 - Timothy's Law is the reference used for a New York state statute signed into law on December 22, 2006 by Governor George E. Pataki which took effect January 1, 2007. The law requires that health plans sold in the state provide comparable coverage for mental health ailments as it does for physical ailments. This is often referred to as mental health parity.Text of Bill #S8482 provided by the New York State Psychiatric Association last accessed 2007-02-14. * 2006 ‚Äì World Down Syndrome Day (WDSD) is marked each year on March 21, beginning in 2006. The 21st day of March (the 3rd month of the year) was selected to signify the uniqueness of the triplication (trisomy) of the 21st chromosome which causes Down syndrome. * 2006 ‚Äì National Federation of the Blind v. Target Corporation, 452 F.Supp.2d 946 (2006), was a class action lawsuit in the United States that was filed on February 7, 2006 in the Superior Court of California for the County of Alameda, and subsequently moved to federal court. The case challenged whether the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, specifically Title III's provisions prohibiting discrimination by \\"places of public accommodation\\" (42 U.S.C. 12181 et seq) apply to websites and/ or the Internet, or are restricted to physical places. The plaintiff, National Federation of the Blind (NFB), sued Target Corporation, a national retail chain, claiming that blind people were unable to access much of the information on the defendant's website, nor purchase anything from its website independently. On September 7, 2006, the court ordered that a retailer may be sued if its website is inaccessible to the blind. In the court's opinion, Judge Marilyn Hall Patel explained that the order of the court was based upon \\"42 U.S. Code ¬ß 12182\\", the prohibition of discrimination by public accommodations clause of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which prohibits discrimination in the \\"enjoyment of goods, services, facilities or privileges.\\" * 2006 ‚Äì In United States v. Georgia, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the protection of the Americans with Disabilities Act extends to persons held in a state prison and protects prison inmates from discrimination on the basis of disability by prison personnel. Specifically, the court held that title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, ., was a proper use of Congressional power under the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 5, making it applicable to prison system officials. * 2007 ‚Äì A psychiatric patient in the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in New York, given the pseudonym of Simone D., won a court ruling which set aside a two-year-old court order to give her electroshock treatment against her will. * 2007 ‚Äì A decision by the Colorado Court of Appeals in People v. Grant upheld a lower court ruling that did not allow expert testimony on the defendant's state of mind due to voluntary intoxication, thus ruling out any possibility that the issue of \\"settled insanity\\" might be raised. * 2007 ‚Äì On May 21, 2007 the U.S. Supreme Court held in Winkelman v. Parma City School District, 550 U.S. 516, that parents have independent enforceable rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and may appear pro se on behalf of their children. * 2007 ‚Äì Jonathan's Law is the \\"popular name\\" of the amendments to New York Mental Hygiene Law Article 33. Jonathan's Law, a New York statute, was signed into law in May 2007; it entitles parents and legal guardians access to all child abuse investigation files and medical history records.Governor Spitzer's press release . Retrieved April 1, 2009. The legislative measure is intended to hold residential mental health facilities accountable by requiring notification of guardians in cases of ill treatment, and requires written reports of ensuing investigations. Mike and Lisa Carey, the parents of Jonathan Carey, promoted Jonathan's Law. Jonathan Carey, who had severe autism, was abused and neglected at school and later killed by a direct care worker. * 2007 ‚Äì Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930 (2007), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, ruling that criminal defendants sentenced to death may not be executed if they do not understand the reason for their imminent execution, and that once the state has set an execution date death-row inmates may litigate their competency to be executed in habeas corpus proceedings. * 2007 ‚Äì Doe ex. rel. Tarlow v. District of Columbia, 489 F.3d 376 (D.C. Cir. 2007), is a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, written by Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh, in which the Court upheld a 2003 District of Columbia statute that stated the conditions for authorizing a non-emergency surgical procedure on a mentally incompetent person. This case developed out of an appeal to a district court decision that was brought on behalf of a mentally incompetent patient who was subjected to an abortion without her consent and another patient who was subjected to an eye surgery without the patient's consent. Under the Appellate Court's interpretation of the statute, a court located in the District of Columbia, must apply the \\"best interest of the patient\\" standard to a person who was never competent, and the court must apply the \\"known wishes of the patient\\" standard to a person who was once competent. The appellate decision was remanded back to the District Court. * 2007 ‚Äì Michigan Paralyzed Veterans of America v. The University of Michigan, begun in 2007, was a case filed before The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan Southern Division on behalf of the Michigan Paralyzed Veterans of America against University of Michigan ‚Äì Michigan Stadium claiming that Michigan Stadium violated the Americans with Disabilities Act in its $226-million renovation by failing to add enough seats for disabled fans or accommodate the needs for disabled restrooms, concessions and parking. Additionally, the distribution of the accessible seating was at issue, with nearly all the seats being provided in the end-zone areas. The suit was settled in March 2008.Erb, Robin. \\"U-M fans rave about new seats for disabled,\\" Detroit Free Press. 9 September 2008. The settlement required the stadium to add 329 wheelchair seats throughout the stadium by 2010, and an additional 135 accessible seats in clubhouses to go along with the existing 88 wheelchair seats. This case was significant because it set a precedent for the uniform distribution of accessible seating and gave the DOJ the opportunity to clarify previously unclear rules.Wolffe, Jerry. \\"New wheelchair seats will be full at U-M's Big House.\\" The Oakland Press. 14 September 2008. The agreement now is a blueprint for all stadiums and other public facilities regarding accessibility.Wolffe, Jerry. \\"New wheelchair seats will be full at U-M's Big House,\\" The Oakland Press. 14 September 2008. / * 2007 ‚Äì Legislation enacted in Idaho designated every October as Disability History Month. * 2007 ‚Äì The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires the U.S. states to provide students with disabilities a \\"free appropriate public education.\\" Because the New York City Department of Education did not have an \\"Individualized Education Program\\" for former Viacom executive Tom Freston's son Gilbert, Freston enrolled his son in the Stephen Gaynor School, a private school for special needs students. The school district reimbursed Freston for tuition to the school. Two years later the school district offered a place for Gilbert at a different public school. Freston declined the offer and again sought reimbursement for private school tuition. A United States district court ruled that because Gilbert had never been enrolled in public school, IDEA did not require the school district to reimburse Freston. As Oyez notes, the IDEA act \\"authorizes reimbursement for a child 'who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency,' but it does not explicitly state that parents of children who have never received public education are not entitled to reimbursement.\\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the decision of the district court on August 9, 2006, reasoning by comparing the disputed section of the act with other sections that IDEA was not intended to deny reimbursement for students never enrolled in public school. The court held that upholding the district court ruling would require parents to enroll their children in inadequate public schools as a condition of eligibility for tuition reimbursement. The school district appealed to the Supreme Court in a November 3, 2006 petition for a writ of certiorari. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on February 26, 2007. Later that year in New York City Board of Education v. Tom F. the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Tom. * 2008 ‚Äì The Washington, D.C. District Court decided that the Treasury must ‚Äútake such steps as may be required to provide meaningful access to United States currency for blind and other visually impaired persons,‚Äù siding with the American Council of the Blind. * 2008 ‚Äì In the state of Washington, October is a statutorily designated civic holiday called Disability History Month; the bill establishing the holiday passed the state legislature in 2008 and is codified in Title 28A of the Revised Code of Washington in 2008. In addition to the ceremonial designation, the law also requires that \\"each public school shall conduct or promote educational activities that provide instruction, awareness, and understanding of disability history and people with disabilities\\". * 2008 ‚Äì The Illinois Appellate Court held that in determining a petition for the sterilization of an incompetent ward, a court should apply the substituted consent standard if there is clear and convincing evidence regarding how the ward would decide if the ward were competent; however, the court should apply the best interest of the patient standard if the ward's substituted judgment cannot be proven by clear and convincing evidence. * 2008 ‚Äì The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (, GINA) became law in the U.S. The Act prohibits group health plans and health insurers from denying coverage to a healthy individual or charging that person higher premiums based solely on a genetic predisposition to developing a disease in the future. The legislation also bars employers from using individuals' genetic information when making hiring, firing, job placement, or promotion decisions.Statement of Administration policy, Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget, April 27, 2007 * 2008 ‚Äì The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 became law, and it broadened the scope of who is considered disabled under the law, and when considering whether a person is disabled, the law required that people ignore the beneficial effects of any mitigating measures (except ordinary eyeglasses and contact lenses) the person uses; furthermore, when considering whether a person is substantially limited in a major life activity, which would make them disabled under the law, the law required the consideration of bodily functions as well as other major life activities, and having one major life activity substantially limited is enough; when considering whether a person whose condition is episodic or in remission is substantially limited in a major life activity, the law required the consideration of the person's limitations as they are when the condition is in an active state; furthermore, determining someone is disabled under the law does not require individuals to meet the substantially-limited-in-a-major-life-activity standard, but does not include impairments that are transitory and minor. * 2008 ‚Äì The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act became law in the U.S., and it required that if a group health plan includes medical/surgical benefits and MH/SUD (mental health/substance abuse) benefits, the financial requirements (e.g., deductibles and co-payments) and treatment limitations (e.g., number of visits or days of coverage) that apply to MH/SUD benefits must be no more restrictive than the predominant financial requirements or treatment limitations that apply to substantially all medical/surgical benefits; MH/SUD benefits may not be subject to any separate cost-sharing requirements or treatment limitations that only apply to such benefits; if a group health plan includes medical/surgical benefits and MH/SUD benefits, and the plan provides for out-of-network medical/surgical benefits, it must provide for out-of-network MH/SUD benefits; and standards for medical necessity determinations and reasons for any denial of benefits relating to MH/SUD benefits must be disclosed upon request. However, this law does not apply to small group health plans. * 2008 ‚Äì Indiana v. Edwards, , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the standard for competency to stand trial was not linked to the standard for competency to represent oneself. * 2009 ‚Äì The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act became law in the U.S., and it expanded the definition of federal hate crime to include those violent crimes in which the victim is selected due to their actual or perceived disability; previously federal hate crimes were defined as only those violent crimes where the victim is selected due to their race, color, religion, or national origin. * 2009 ‚Äì The Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act became law in the U.S. It was the first piece of comprehensive legislation aimed at improving the lives of Americans living with paralysis; it created new coordinated research activities through the National Institutes of Health to search for a cure for paralysis, and promotes enhanced rehabilitation services for Americans living with paralysis. * 2009 ‚Äì Forest Grove School District v. T. A., 557 U.S. 230 (2009), is a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) authorizes reimbursement for private special education services when a public school fails to provide a \\"free appropriate public education\\" (FAPE) and the private school placement is appropriate, regardless of whether the child previously received special education services through the public school. * 2009 ‚Äì Section 3A1.1 of the 2009 United States Sentencing Guidelines states that: \\"If the finder of fact at trial or, in the case of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the court at sentencing determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally selected any victim or any property as the object of the offense of conviction because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability, or sexual orientation of any person,\\" the sentencing court is required to increase the standard sentencing range. 2010s * 2010 ‚Äì The 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act, known as CVAA, was signed into law. It requires that unedited, full-length programs shown on TV with captions must also be captioned when they are made available online, with more requirements to be phased in at later dates. * 2010 ‚Äì Rosa's Law, which changed references in many federal statutes that referred to \\"mental retardation\\" to make them refer, instead, to \\"intellectual disability\\", became law in the U.S. * 2010 ‚Äì The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act became law. Due to this law, since 2012 companies cannot drop a person's coverage when they get sick due to a mistake the person made on their application, or put a lifetime cap on how much care they will pay for if a person gets sick, and since 2014 companies cannot deny coverage based on preexisting conditions, or put an annual cap on how much care they will pay for if a person gets sick. * 2010 ‚Äì In United States v. Comstock, 560 U.S. 126 (2010), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the federal government may order the civil commitment of a mentally ill, sexually dangerous person beyond the conclusion of their federal sentence. * 2011 ‚Äì The Joseph Maraachli case refers to an international controversy over the life of Joseph Maraachli, commonly known as Baby Joseph, a Canadian infant who was diagnosed with a rare progressive and incurable neurological disorder called Leigh's disease. After Canadian doctors refused to perform a tracheotomy, calling the procedure invasive and futile, Joseph's parents fought to have him transferred to the United States, arguing that while Joseph's disease was terminal, a tracheotomy would extend his life and allow him to die at home. After several months and efforts by American pro- life groups, Joseph was transferred to a Catholic hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, where the procedure was performed in 2011. The successfully-obtained procedure extended Joseph's life for several months. Joseph died in 2011, at his home. * 2011 ‚Äì On March 15, 2011, new Americans with Disabilities Act rules came into effect. These rules expanded accessibility requirements for recreational facilities such as swimming pools, golf courses, exercise clubs, and boating facilities. They also set standards for the use of wheelchairs and other mobility devices like Segways in public spaces, and changed the standards for things such as selling tickets to events and reserving accessible hotel rooms. The new rules also clearly defined ‚Äúservice animal‚Äù as ‚Äú...any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability.‚Äù This portion of the law also states that the services the service animal provides must be ‚Äúdirectly related to the handler‚Äôs disability‚Äù and dogs that provide only emotional support or crime deterrence cannot be defined as service animals. * 2011 ‚Äì Delaware, in 2011, designated October as \\"Disability History and Awareness Month\\". * 2011 ‚Äì In Wisconsin, the District II Wisconsin Court of Appeals ruled in 2011 that patients with Alzheimer's disease cannot be involuntary committed under Chapter 51 and can only be involuntarily committed for residential care and custody under Chapter 55. The court left open whether this applies also to persons with a dual diagnosis. * 2011 ‚Äì The Broken Arrow City Council, Oklahoma, unanimously voted to create an exotic animal ordinance exemption allowing Christie Carr, who was depressed, to keep her therapy kangaroo within city limits so long as certain conditions were met. * 2011 ‚Äì Meyer v. Astrue, 662 F.3d 700 (4th Cir. 2011) was a landmark Social Security Disability Insurance case argued in Federal Court, resolving a conflict within the Circuit over the summary denial of requests for review when new evidence is submitted to the Appeals Council. After suffering severe injuries in an accidental fall, Maurice Eugene Meyer applied for Social Security Disability insurance benefits. An administrative law judge (ALJ) denied his claim, noting that Meyer failed to provide an opinion from his treating physician. When Meyer requested review of his claim by the Appeals Council, he submitted a letter from his treating physician detailing the injuries and recommending significant restrictions on Meyer's activity. The Appeals Council made this letter part of the record but summarily denied Meyer's request for review; thus, the ALJ's decision denying benefits became the final decision of the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration. Meyer appealed, on the grounds that the Appeals Council did wrong in failing to articulate specific findings justifying its denial of his request for review. The court rejected this argument and ruled that the Appeals Council did not have to explain its reasoning when denying review of an ALJ decision, but because in this case the court could not determine if substantial evidence supported the denial of benefits, the court reversed and remanded. * 2011 ‚Äì In Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy v. Stewart, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Virginia cannot invoke its sovereign immunity to prevent the Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy (an independent state agency and member of the National Disability Rights Network) from suing state officials for a court order. In other words, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Ex Parte Young allows a federal court to hear a lawsuit for prospective relief against state officials brought by another agency of the same state. * 2011 ‚Äì The Fair, Accurate, Inclusive, and Respectful Education Act, also known as the FAIR Education Act (Senate Bill 48), which states that California schools must include the contributions of people with disabilities in their textbooks and in teaching of history and social studies classes, became law. * 2011 ‚Äì Facilities licensed by the DDS (Department of Developmental Services) in Massachusetts, including but not limited to the Judge Rotenberg Center, were banned from subjecting new admissions to severe behavioral interventions including electric shock, long-term restraint, or aversives that pose risk for psychological harm. * 2011 ‚Äì White Cane Safety Day was also named Blind Americans Equality Day by President Barack Obama. * 2011 ‚Äì In May 2011 ADAPT organized a protest in Washington, D. C. against changes to Medicaid as part of US Representative Paul Ryan's budget proposal that would have cut Medicaid funding and given more control of the program to the states. Around 100 disability protesters were arrested in D.C., and similar protests led by local ADAPT groups were later held in Chicago, Philadelphia, and Minnesota. Throughout these protests, ADAPT used their Twitter and Facebook feeds to share photos and links to media coverage of the event, which included images of protesters being arrested, to gain and mobilize support from the broader community. * 2012 ‚Äì It was announced that by 2014, AMC movie theaters in Illinois would be equipped with captioning services and audio-description devices, available to moviegoers at nearly any movie at an AMC theater in Illinois and at all of a film‚Äôs listed showings.\\"AMC Theatres ‚ÄòAccess‚Äô agreement reached in Illinois as a result of complaint filed by Equip for Equality\\". Ability Chicago. April 4, 2012. Retrieved May 29th, 2014. * 2012 ‚Äì In 2012, in Hosanna-Tabor, the Supreme Court faced the ministerial exception for the first time. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts affirmed the exception, grounding it in both the Free-Exercise and Establishment Clauses. The majority also found that it applied to the case at hand, barring Cheryl Perich, a teacher, from suing her employer, a Missouri Synod church and school, under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Although the court declined to adopt a \\"rigid formula\\" to determine who is a minister, it found compelling that Ms. Perich (1) was held out as a minister and given a formal ministerial title, (2) had undergone a \\"significant degree of religious training\\" in order to obtain that title, (3) held herself out as a minister, even claiming special housing allowances for ministers on her taxes, and (4) performed significant religious functions, including playing \\"a role in conveying the Church's message and carrying out its mission.\\"Hosanna- Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 565 US. 171, 176‚Äì96 (2012). * 2012 ‚Äì A lawsuit settlement provided that the Colorado Department of Human Services is required to admit a pretrial detainee to the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo (‚ÄúCMHIP‚Äù) within 28 days of the court determining the need for an evaluation or restorative treatment, the Department is required to maintain a monthly average of no more than 24 days for all patients admitted to CMHIP for evaluation or treatment, and competency evaluations performed in county jails must be completed within 30 days. * 2012 ‚Äì A lawsuit settlement provided that the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York would add wheelchair seating and accessible parking and renovate restrooms to make them more accessible.\\"New York's Lincoln Center settles disability lawsuit\\". Fox News. June 28, 2012. Retrieved May 29th, 2014. * 2012‚Äì In September 2012, Home Depot company agreed to pay $100,000 and furnish other relief to settle a disability discrimination lawsuit filed by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, for the alleged failure to provide a reasonable accommodation for a cashier with cancer at its Towson, Maryland, store, and then for purportedly firing her because of her condition. * 2012 ‚Äì Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn issued an executive order to increase state oversight of investigations into the deaths of adults with disabilities, because a recent Belleville News-Democrat investigation revealed that, since 2003, the inspector general of the Department of Human Services did not investigate 53 cases called into the agency's hotline about disabled adults living at home who were allegedly abused or neglected and later died. * 2012 ‚Äì Gov. Andrew Cuomo and legislative leaders reached a deal to create a new state agency, the Justice Center for the Protection of People With Special Needs, to police abuse and neglect of more than one million New Yorkers with developmental disabilities, mental illnesses and other conditions that put them at risk. Lawmakers also agreed to expand the state‚Äôs public disclosure law, requiring thousands of nonprofit groups that provide services to disabled and mentally ill people to make records of abuse and neglect public. The reforms were based on a report by Clarence J. Sundram, Special Advisor to the Governor on Vulnerable Persons, entitled \\"The Measure of a Society:Protection of Vulnerable Persons in Residential Facilities Against Abuse and Neglect.\\" Some disability activists supported this reform, but others disapproved because they thought investigations should be referred to outside police agencies, not the state. An independent nonprofit group is also being set up to lobby for policy changes for people with disabilities. The group will get powers to conduct its own investigations after complaints and to review documents connected to particular allegations, and that authority is detailed in state law. It will also be given access to group homes and state institutions. * 2012 ‚Äì It was announced that Netflix will offer closed captions on all TV and movie content from September 2014 as part of a settlement with a deaf viewer from Massachusetts (Lee Nettles) who sued the company. In 2012, a federal judge in Springfield, Massachusetts ruled in that lawsuit that Netflix and other online providers that serve the public are subject to the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, the first ruling in the country to recognize that Internet-based businesses are covered by the act. * 2012 ‚Äì On December 17, 2012, the United States of America filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, against the City of Portland, alleging improper use-of-force by the Portland Police Bureau against members of a protected class. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon and the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, sought injunctive and declaratory relief. Based on findings of more than a year of investigation, the complaint alleged Portland police officers engaged in a pattern or practice of unconstitutional use of force against individuals with actual or perceived mental illness. Specifically, the DOJ claimed: (1) Portland police encounters with such individuals too frequently resulted in a higher level force than necessary; (2) Portland police employed Tasers more times than necessary on such individuals, or in circumstances where such force was not justified; and (3) Portland police used a higher degree of force than justified for low level offenses. The case based on this claim, United States v. City of Portland, is notable because of its finding persons with mental illness are primary recipients of police use-of-force. * 2012 ‚Äì The Idaho Fish and Game Commission declared that a companion without a tag or permit is allowed to assist a disabled hunter. * 2012 ‚Äì In Massachusetts the Appeals Court overturned a decision by a lower court requiring a sterilization and abortion on a women with \\"schizophrenia and/or schizoaffective disorder and bipolar mood disorder.\\" The appellate court wrote that the lower court did not follow the due process requirements for a sterilization and the decision to require the abortion was not made using the substituted consent standard. The lower court judge later stated that she required the abortion because she believed that if the patient were healthy she \\"would elect to abort the pregnancy to protect her own well-being.\\" Rima Kundnani wrote that this case shows how \\"proper standards must therefore be established to avoid judicial abuse and to protect the reproductive rights of mentally ill women.\\" * 2012 ‚Äì A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit affirmed that school districts should reimburse parents for independent educational evaluations of students with disabilities, at least in some cases. Though the U.S. Department of Education had long indicated that parents have the right to an independent opinion at public expense under certain circumstance, the Jefferson County Board of Education in Alabama had challenged the rule. * 2013 ‚Äì Since January 31, 2013, all existing pools located at \\"public accommodations\\" must meet Americans With Disabilities Act standards. This requires the installation of a fixed lift for the pool areas. * 2013 ‚Äì Newport News Circuit Court Judge David F. Pugh rejected a guardianship request from the parents of 29-year-old Margaret Jean Hatch, also called Jenny Hatch, that would have allowed them to keep her in a group home against her will. * 2013 ‚Äì The 4th District Court of Appeal held that a developmentally disabled adult with \\"mild mental retardation\\" may be reproductively sterilized if the court determines there is clear and convincing evidence that the procedure is medically necessary for the patient. The court held that Probate Code section 2357 regulated the patients court order for medical treatment because the sterilization was incidental to acquiring medical care and not the purpose of the medical treatment; alternatively, Probate Code section 1950 et seq. applies when the objective is to prevent the patient from bearing children. * 2013 ‚Äì In the case of EEOC v. Hill Country Farms, in a U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, a jury awarded the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission damages totaling $240 million ‚Äì the largest verdict in the EEOC's history ‚Äì for disability discrimination and severe abuse. The jury agreed with the EEOC that Hill County Farms, doing business as Henry's Turkey Service, subjected 32 men with intellectual disabilities to severe abuse and discrimination for a period between 2007 and 2009, after 20 years of similar mistreatment. However, later in 2013 the jury award for the 32 claimants was reduced to $1.6 million due to statutory damages caps applicable to claims brought under the Americans With Disabilities Act, which, along with the Court's previous award of back wages in the amount of $1.3 million, reduced the total recovery in the case to $2.9 million. * 2013 ‚Äì The Iowa Court of Appeals ruled that a girl's tree nut allergy was a protected disability under the Iowa Civil Rights Act, as well as an episodic impairment under the Americans with Disabilities Act. * 2013 ‚Äì The U.S. Justice Department said in a settlement with Lesley University in Massachusetts that severe food allergies can be considered disabilities under federal law. * 2013 ‚Äì The U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston, Massachusetts found that companies can be required to pay long-term disability benefits to a recovering drug addict if the person would face a significant risk of relapse by returning to work. This is believed to be the first time a circuit court said that a risk of relapse into substance abuse can constitute a disability, entitling an employee to long-term benefits, according to the attorney for the plaintiff. * 2013 ‚Äì The U.S. Department of Education issued a mandate requiring schools to provide sports for children with disabilities. Specifically, students with disabilities who want to compete in sports for their school can join traditional teams if officials can make \\"reasonable modifications\\" to accommodate them. If those adjustments would fundamentally alter a sport or give the student an advantage, the department says schools must create parallel athletic programs that have comparable standing to traditional programs. * 2013 ‚Äì Persons with intellectual disabilities, severe physical disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities who opt to apply for a job with the federal government through Schedule A ‚Äì a hiring authority allowing agencies to appoint a qualified, disabled applicant to a position without competing with the general public ‚Äì stopped being required to supply a \\"certification of job readiness\\" from a medical professional or rehabilitation specialist stating they could perform the job. Under the revised policies, agencies became able to hire after determining that the person is \\"likely to succeed\\" in performing the duties of the position, a decision that can be based on any relevant work, educational, or other experience. The new rules also dropped the term \\"mental retardation\\" and replaced it with \\"intellectual disability\\". * 2013 ‚Äì The U.S. Supreme Court blocked North Carolina from trying to take more than $900,000 from a legal settlement won by the family of a 13-year-old girl, identified only as E.M.A, who suffered serious injuries during her birth that left her severely disabled. Writing for the court, Justice Anthony Kennedy said the state cannot claim a share of the settlement as reimbursement for medical care without determining how much of the settlement is attributable to the care. * 2013 ‚Äì Effective July 1, 2013, California Civil Code Section 1938 requires every \\"commercial property owner or lessor\\" in California to include on the lease whether the property has been inspected by a Certified Access Specialist (CASp), and if so, whether the CASp did or did not determine whether the property met all applicable construction-related accessibility standards pursuant to Section 55.53. * 2013 ‚Äì The U.S. Justice Department said on its website April 22 that it was issuing a new nationwide policy for unrepresented detainees with serious mental disabilities. The Executive Office for Immigration Review will make available a qualified representative to detainees deemed mentally incompetent to represent themselves in immigration proceedings. * 2013 ‚Äì North Carolina announced that it would spend $10 million beginning in June 2015 to compensate men and women who were sterilized in the state's eugenics program; North Carolina sterilized 7,600 people from 1929 to 1974 who were deemed socially or mentally unfit. * 2013 ‚Äì Airline website pages which have core travel information and services must be accessible to the disabled within two years, the Department of Transportation said, and all pages on airline websites must within three years be readily available to people with disabilities. The new regulations also required airline ticket agents to disclose ‚Äî and offer ‚Äî web-based discount fares to customers unable to use their sites due to a disability. Airlines already were required to provide equivalent service for consumers who were unable to use inaccessible websites. Airlines and airports were also required by the new regulations to have to make accessible to the disabled automated kiosks providing boarding passes and baggage tags, as they purchased new equipment. If no new kiosks were installed, 25 percent of the kiosks at each airport location in 2013 were required to be accessible within 10 years. Another new rule gave airlines more flexibility in how they transported manual, folding wheelchairs onboard, making it possible for them to carry up to two wheelchairs in the cabin. In addition to being able to stow a wheelchair in a closet, airlines were also allowed under the new regulations to strap a second chair across a row of seats. Closets also were required to have signs saying wheelchairs have priority over other baggage. * 2014 ‚Äì The Iowa Supreme Court held that court approval is required for the sterilization of an incompetent person. * 2014 ‚Äì Employees of federal service and concession contractors with disabilities who had been paid less than minimum wage under Section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act were included in an executive order (signed in 2014) raising the minimum wage for employees of federal service and concession contractors to $10.10 an hour. * 2014 ‚Äì The Stephen Beck, Jr. Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014 (the ABLE Act) was signed into law. This Act creates a new Section 529A of the Internal Revenue Service Code of 1986 to create tax-free savings accounts (ABLE accounts, also known as 529A plans) for qualified expenses. With these accounts (each person may have only one account) people with disabilities who have a condition that occurred before age 26 can save up to $100,000 without risking eligibility for Supplemental Security Income and other government programs. They can also keep their Medicaid coverage no matter how much money they accrue in their ABLE account. Interest earned on savings will be tax-free. Under current gift-tax limitations as of 2014, as much as $14,000 could be deposited annually. However, each state must put regulations in place so that financial institutions can make the ABLE accounts available, and there is no guarantee a particular state will do so. * 2014 ‚Äì The U.S. Justice Department announced that it had entered into a statewide settlement agreement to resolve violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act for approximately 3,250 Rhode Islanders with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Due to this settlement, 2,000 Rhode Islanders with intellectual and developmental disabilities who are being served by segregated programs as of 2014 will have opportunities to work in real jobs at competitive wages. Also, over the next ten years, 1,250 students with intellectual and developmental disabilities will receive services to help transition into the workforce. This was the first statewide settlement in American history to address the rights of people with disabilities to receive state funded employment and daytime services in the broader community, rather than in segregated sheltered workshops and facility-based day programs. * 2014 ‚Äì Marlise Nicole Mu√±oz was an American woman at the center of a medical ethics controversy between November 2013 and January 2014. She suffered a suspected pulmonary embolism and was declared brain dead. Because she was pregnant, doctors at a Texas hospital kept her body on a ventilator in the intensive care unit despite the determination of brain death. Mu√±oz's husband entered a legal battle to have her removed from organ support. A Texas law restricts the application of advance directives in pregnant patients, but Mu√±oz's husband argued that the law was not applicable because his wife was legally dead. A judge ordered the hospital to remove organ support and her cardiac functions stopped on January 26, 2014. * 2014 ‚Äì Hall v. Florida, 572 U.S. ___ (2014), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a bright-line IQ threshold requirement for determining whether someone has an intellectual disability (formerly mental retardation) is unconstitutional in deciding whether they are eligible for the death penalty. * 2014 ‚Äì On September 30, 2014, California Governor Jerry Brown signed Audrie's Law, \\"a bill that increases penalties and decreases privacy protections for teens convicted of sex acts on someone who is passed out from drugs or alcohol or incapable of giving consent due to a disability\\". This law was named after Audrie Pott, a 15-year-old student at Saratoga High School in Saratoga, California who died by suicide on September 12, 2012. She had been sexually assaulted at a party eight days earlier by three of her classmates, Bronson Barna, Saha Ghafouri (or Saha Nicholas) and Vince Rositano, and pictures of the assault were posted online with accompanying bullying. * 2014 ‚Äì Authors Guild v. HathiTrust, 755 F.3d 87 (2d Cir. 2014), was a copyright decision finding search and accessibility uses of digitized books to be fair use. The Authors Guild, other author organizations, and individual authors claimed that the HathiTrust Digital Library had infringed their copyrights through its use of books scanned by Google. A federal court ruled against the plaintiffs in October 2012, finding that HathiTrust's use was permissible under fair use. The plaintiffs appealed the decision to the Second Circuit, and were rebuffed in 2014. In an opinion by Barrington Daniels Parker, Jr., the Second Circuit largely affirmed the lower court's findings of fair use for accessibility and search, remanding only to consider whether the plaintiffs had standing to sue about library preservation copies. The remaining claims were settled on January 6, 2015.Andrew Albanese, \\"Authors Guild Drops HathiTrust Case\\", Publishers Weekly, Jan. 8, 2015.Krista Cox, \\"Authors Guild v.

Scribd moved to dismiss, arguing that the Americans with Disabilities Act only applied to physical locations. In March 2015, the U.S. District Court of Vermont ruled that the ADA covered online businesses as well. A settlement agreement was reached, with Scribd agreeing to provide content accessible to blind readers by the end of 2017. * 2015 ‚Äì It was announced by Oregon state officials that the California-based owner and operator of a housing complex in Lake Oswego, Oregon (Prometheus Real Estate Group) had agreed to pay $475,000 to settle allegations that it failed to provide a reasonable accommodation to a disabled former resident. In October 2011, James Calogridis requested a disabled parking spot closer to his and his wife's unit in the housing complex because of a disability that limited his ability to walk. But in January 2012 he fell in the parking lot of the complex and was injured, dying of his injuries on February 9; February 9 was only one day after the complex owners gave him the parking spot he had requested. In addition to the payment of $475,000, it was also agreed that Prometheus Real Estate Group must, \\"[c]omply with the Oregon Fair Housing Act and the Federal Fair Housing Act (FHA), [p]rovide BOLI [the Bureau of Labor and Industries] with a list of all Prometheus-owned or managed properties, [r]eport any property ownership changes or acquisitions to BOLI for three years, [c]onduct annual FHA trainings for all Prometheus employees, [m]aintain a \\"reasonable accommodation\\" log that documents tenant accommodation requests for BOLI on a semi-annual basis, [p]rovide BOLI with its policies and practices for reasonably accommodating tenant disabilities for the agency's review, [and n]otify all tenants of Prometheus properties in Oregon of their rights to reasonable accommodations.\\" * 2015 ‚Äì U.S. District Judge Beth Bloom of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida ruled that Anthony Merchante's service dog should be allowed to join him at Nob Hill Elementary, and do so without a series of requirements the school district had added on. * 2015 ‚Äì The governor of Maryland signed a law establishing the Ethan Saylor Alliance for Self-Advocates as Educators; it was designed to operate out of the state‚Äôs Department of Disabilities, and to bring together people with intellectual and developmental disabilities to teach law enforcement officers about their needs. The law was named for Robert Ethan Saylor, a 26-year-old man with Down syndrome who died in 2013 after being restrained by three off-duty sheriff‚Äôs deputies when he refused to leave a Frederick, Md. movie theater. * 2015 ‚Äì Brumfield v. Cain, , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that because Brumfield satisfied 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 2254(d)(2)‚Äôs requirements, he was entitled to have his Atkins v.

Morin, No. 15-50197 (5th Cir. 2016) the defendant challenged two special conditions of his supervised release. The court agreed that one of the conditions, which gave a private therapist the right to impose \\"lifestyle restrictions\\" that might be unnecessary to the treatment and could be in force throughout the defendant's supervised release, was an improper delegation. Thus the court vacated that condition. (The court also ruled on a requirement for the defendant to abstain from alcohol and other intoxicants, but that is not relevant to disability rights as forced therapeutic treatment restrictions are.) * 2017 ‚Äì Endrew F. v.

She was subsequently found deceased 11 months later in August 2010. Richardson's parents maintained that their daughter should never have been released on her own by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department given her obviously disturbed condition. In 2011 they won civil lawsuits against the county of $900,000 in damages. In January 2017, the California Attorney General's office concluded an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Richardson's release from jail and decided not to bring charges against anyone involved in her release. * 2018 ‚Äì Delta Air Lines stated that starting March 1, documentation would be required about the health of service and support animals, and in some cases there would have to be a promise of their good conduct. * 2018 ‚Äì United Airlines refused to allow a person to bring her emotional support peacock on a flight leaving from Newark Liberty International Airport. * 2018 ‚Äì Paying workers with disabilities less than the minimum wage was outlawed in Alaska in 2018. * 2018 ‚Äì Starting March 1, United Airlines required documents to confirm that an emotional support animal is healthy and properly trained for being in public places. * 2018 ‚Äì A woman was removed from a Frontier Airlines flight due to her bringing a squirrel and refusing to leave with it; the airline would not allow the squirrel to be considered an emotional support animal. * 2018 ‚Äì Beginning November 1, 2018, Frontier Airlines declared that emotional support animals must be either a dog or a cat, may be only one animal per customer, must have the airline notified of them at least 48 hours before departure, and must be in a carrier that can be stowed under the seat in front of the customer or on a leash while in the airport and aboard the aircraft. * 2019 ‚Äì A law was enacted requiring New Jersey boards of education to adopt instruction accurately showing \\"the political, economic, and social contributions of persons with disabilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, where appropriate.\\" * 2019 ‚Äì In the case Madison v.

Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. (Docket 18‚Äì483) was a United States Supreme Court case dealing with the constitutionality of a 2016 anti-abortion law passed in the state of Indiana. Indiana's law sought to ban abortions performed solely on the basis of the fetus' gender, race, ethnicity, or disabilities. Lower courts had blocked enforcement of the law for violating a woman's right to abortion under privacy concerns within the Fourteenth Amendment, as previously found in the landmark cases Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The lower courts also blocked enforcement of another portion of the law that required the disposal of aborted fetuses through burial or cremation. The per curiam decision by the Supreme Court overturned the injunction on the fetal disposal portion of the law, but otherwise did not challenge or confirm the lower courts' ruling on the non-discrimination clauses, leaving these in place. 2020s * 2020 ‚Äì The FDA banned electric shock devices used to interrupt self-injurious or aggressive behavior, stating, ‚ÄúMany people who are exposed to these devices have intellectual or developmental disabilities that make it difficult to communicate their pain.

It was argued on October 7, 2019 and decided on March 23, 2020. * 2020 ‚Äì A law was enacted in Mississippi banning abortions based on the genetic abnormality, sex, or race of the fetus. * 2020 ‚Äì Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru, 591 U.S. ___ (2020), is a United States Supreme Court case involving the ministerial exception of federal employment discrimination laws. The case extends from the Supreme Court's prior decision in Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & School v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (2012) which created the ministerial exception based on the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the United States Constitution, asserting that federal discrimination laws cannot be applied to leaders of religious organizations. The Supreme Court case Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru, along with the consolidated St. James School v. Biel (Docket 19‚Äì348), both arose from rulings in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that found that federal discrimination laws do apply to others within a religious organization that serve an important religious function but lack the title or training to be considered a religious leader under Hosanna-Tabor. In St. James School v. Biel, in 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declined to use the ministerial exception to bar the disability-discrimination suit of an elementary school teacher who \\"taught religion for about thirty minutes a day, four days a week, using a workbook on the Catholic faith.\\"Biel v. St. James School, 911 F.3d 603 (9th Cir. 2018). The religious organization challenged that ruling on the basis of Hosanna-Tabor. The Supreme Court ruled in a 7‚Äì2 decision called Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru on July 8, 2020 that reversed the Ninth Circuit's ruling, affirming that the principles of Hosanna-Tabor, that a person can be serving an important religious function even if not holding the title or training of a religious leader, satisfied the ministerial exception in employment discrimination.

It has been published in five editions since 1938. The third, fourth and the fifth editions were published in cooperation between the heritage association Selskabet for Oslo Byes Vel and the publishing house Kunnskapsforlaget. The latest edition was published in 2010, comprising approximately 6,100 entries. Editions The five book editions of the encyclopedia Oslo byleksikon =First edition (1938)= The first edition of Oslo byleksikon was published by the Tanum publishing house. It was written and edited by the geographer Aksel Arstal (1855‚Äì1940), who was more than 80 years old at the time of publication. In the edition's preface, Arstal states that \\"the book should contain everything what an Oslo citizen ought to know about the city and the region he frequently visits\\". Arstal also stated that he wanted the entries in the encyclopedia to be \\"short, accurate and factual\\" and without \\"passion\\". The edition strictly followed the new orthographic reform of 1938, which was very radical for its time. In a review of the encyclopaedia for St. Hallvard, architect and antiquarian Arno Berg devoted three pages to finding errors, stating that \\"finding errors could be a funny sport\\". He nonetheless praised Arstal for his work with the encyclopaedia, maintaining that it was a \\"good, funny, and above all a useful book\\". =Second edition (1966)= In 1948, the municipalities Aker and Oslo were merged, which meant an expansion of the city's area from to . Journalist and author Carl Just (1897‚Äì1990) thought that the new, expanded city needed a new encyclopaedia, and started working on the second edition, which eventually was published in 1966. This edition was less systematic than the first edition, introducing much trivia about Oslo that Just was familiar with. In the encyclopaedia, Just enlarged the entries on Oslo's streets by adding descriptions on houses and their architects. The art historian and urban planner Bj√∏rn Sverre Pedersen (1926‚Äì2003) assisted Just with the entries on architecture, though he was not credited in the edition's preface. Just added a new feature in the second edition: A large entry on Oslo in the beginning of the book, containing information on urban planning, nature, geology, plant and animal life, history and politics. The second edition had few illustrations, even fewer than in the first. =Third edition (1987)= The third edition was published in cooperation between the heritage association Selskabet for Oslo Byes Vel and the publishing house Kunnskapsforlaget in the autumn of 1987. It was edited by Reidar Hanssen (1929‚Äì1996), and comprised almost 5,000 entries on 650 pages. The entries were written by more than 50 different people. This edition introduced tables containing information on the city's mayors, award winners, theatre directors, monuments and memorials. It also introduced a systematic index of the contents of the book to aid the reader. The edition became an economical success; a total of 13,000 copies of the encyclopaedia were sold. =Fourth edition (2000)= The fourth edition was edited by Knut Are Tvedt (1952‚Äì). It was expanded with approximately 50 per cent, featuring 5,600 entries. The new content comprised entries on the new administrative boroughs, the Oslo forest, organisations, newspapers, minor sports clubs and political parties. One new feature with the fourth edition was a map in the rear end of the book. This edition also became an economical success‚Äî15,000 copies were printed. =Fifth edition (2010)= The number of entries in the fifth edition grew from 5,600 to 6,100. The new entries were mostly about enterprises and residential areas. This edition was also edited by Knut Are Tvedt, who toyed with the idea of digitalising the encyclopaedia. =Online edition= Oslobyleksikon.no is the sixth edition of Oslo Byleksikon and is disseminated digitally on internet.

It is also the headquarters of a tehsil of the same name.  History  Gyaraspur was of considerable importance in medieval India. The place has several ruins of several old Hindu, Jain and Buddhist places of worship. These include Maladevi Temple, Hindola Torna and the Bajramath Temple.  Transport  Gyaraspur is located near Vidisha (38 km) and Sanchi. Udaipura, famous for its heritage temples, can be reached via Gulabganj and basauda. Topography :Gyaraspur lies in a gorge of some low steep hills, at distance of about 38.4 km north-east from the district and Tehsil headquarters town, Vidisha.. The place is situated on the old high road to Sagar. Buses ply on the road. Places to visit in Gyaraspur The extensive ruins, scattered in and around the Tehsil, narrate the story of glory that was Gyaraspur in the late ancient and early medieval times. These ruins indicate that the place has passed through the influence of Buddhism, Brahmanism and Jainism. #Maladevi TempleThis temple is quite picturesquely situated on the slope of a hill overlooking the valley. Located on a huge platform cut out of the hillside and strengthened by a massive retaining wall, Maladevi temple is in fact imposing and stupendous building. It comprise an entrance-porch, a hall and a shrine surrounded by a circumambulatory passage and crowned with a lofty Shikara all covered with rich carving. Though now Jain images occupy the shrine room and hall, a figure of a goddess occupying the dedicatory block on the outer door frame and other decorative sculptures probably indicate that the temple was originally dedicated to some goddess and it was subsequently appropriated by the Jains. #Hindola Torna:It is one of the 'Toranas' or ornamental entrance arches leading to a large temple either of Vishnu or of Trimurti. Hindola means a swing, and this tarana with its two upright pillars and cross-beam has a truly connotative name. All the four sides of the two lofty pillars are carved into panels with insets of the ten incarnations of Vishnu. #Bajramath/Vajramath Temple:The bajramath is a fine example of a very rare class of temples with three shrines or cells placed abreast. All these shrines now occupied by Jain idols belonging to the Digambara sect. But it is clear from the sculptures placed on the door frames and niches on the basement that originally these shrines sheltered the Hindu Trinity. More precisely the central shrine was dedicated to Surya, the southern to Vishnu and the northern to Siva. The carving of the doorway is exceptionally fine and vigorous. The Shikara of the temple is unusual in its plan and design.

The scope of topics covered by the journal is wide but the emphasis is on social history and long-term trends (longue dur√©e), often using quantification and paying special attention to geographySee Lucien Febvre, La Terre et l'√©volution humaine (1922), translated as A Geographical Introduction to History (London, 1932). and to the intellectual world view of common people, or \\"mentality\\" (mentalit√©). Less attention is paid to political, diplomatic, or military history, or to biographies of famous men. Instead the Annales focused attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis. It is one of the main French outlets for research in historical anthropology. In 2017 the EHESS formed a partnership with Cambridge University Press to publish both the French and English editions of the Annales.https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/annales-histoire-sciences- sociales/article/editorial/8F90DD532271A990FDC22FF94FA842DB (Accessed February 2019) The English language edition has been published since 2012, carrying English translations of the original French articles.https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/annales-histoire-sciences- sociales-english-edition/all-issues (Accessed February 2019)  See also  * World-systems theory  References   External links  * * √âditions de l'EHESS * Free access to all issues of the Annales from 1929 to 2002. * Jstor * Current content of the Annales Category:Bimonthly journals Category:French- language journals Category:History journals Category:Sociology journals Category:Publications established in 1929 Category:Academic journals published in France Category:Cambridge University Press academic journals ","title":"Annales.

He won the 2000 Guineas Stakes and the Derby in 1931 but finished unplaced in the St. Leger in his attempt to win the English Triple Crown. He returned as a four- year-old to win the Champion Stakes in 1932. Background Cameronian was a small bay horse, bred by his first owner, the Scottish whisky distiller Thomas Dewar, 1st Baron Dewar. On Lord Dewar's death in 1930, the unraced two-year- old colt was inherited by his nephew John Arthur ‚ÄúLucky‚Äù Dewar. The death of an owner had traditionally canceled all of a horse's entries, but a rule change in 1929 meant that Cameronian's status was not affected, allowing him to take part in the Classics. Cameronian's sire, Pharos was a top class racehorse who won the Champion Stakes and went on to become a highly successful stallion. He sired many good winners including the French champion Pharis and the unbeaten Nearco, who became one of the most influential stallions of the 20th Century. Cameronian was the third of seven Derby winners trained by Fred Darling at Beckhampton, Wiltshire. Racing career =1930: two-year-old season= Cameronian was slow to mature as a two-year-old and ran only once, winning a minor race at Salisbury. He was not rated in that year's Free Handicap, a rating of the leading two-year-olds. =1931: three-year-old season= Cameronian began his three-year-old season by running third to Philae in the Craven Stakes at Newmarket, beaten just over a length. His effort was attracted attention and he was introduced into the Derby betting as second favourite. In the 2000 Guineas three weeks later he started at 100/8 and was ridden by Joe Childs, as the stable jockey Fred Fox rode the more fancied Lemnarchus. On heavy ground which had forced the withdrawal of the likely favourite Jacopo. Cameronian won by two lengths from the French colt Goyescas In the Derby at Epsom a month later Cameronian started 7/2 favourite. Ridden by Fox he broke quickly and was then steadied to track the leaders in the early stages before moving into the lead as the field entered the straight. Orpen emerged as his main challenger, moving alongside Cameronian two furlongs out but after a \\"terrific struggle\\" Cameronian prevailed by three quarters of a length. Sandwich, who had been badly drawn and been hampered during the race finished strongly to take third. The win for the favourite was extremely popular with the public, though not with the bookmakers, several of whom \\"welshed\\" (failed to pay out winning bets) on the race. At the victory celebration, Dewar, who described himself as \\"the most delighted man in the world\\", decorated the Savoy Hotel with a hundred miles of tartan ribbon. Cameronian was sent to Royal Ascot two weeks later for the St. James's Palace Stakes over one mile. He recorded a popular victory, winning by three lengths from Trinidad in \\"brilliant\\" style. The colt was then rested until the September, when he started odds-on favourite for the St Leger at Doncaster Racecourse, despite doubts from some experts about his ability to stay the one and three quarter mile distance. His attempt to become the first Triple Crown winner since Rock Sand in 1903 however, ended in failure. He pulled hard on the way to the start where, according to Fred Fox, he \\"went mad\\", becoming highly agitated and kicking out at other horses. In the race the colt fought Fox's attempts to settle him. By the straight he was exhausted and dropped out to finish last of the ten runners behind Sandwich. Although Cameronian was found to be running a temperature after the race he soon recovered. His connections were unable to explain his poor effort, with Darling explicitly ruling out the possibility of the horse having been \\"got at\\". Plans to retire the colt at the end of the season were revised. =1932: four-year-old season= At four, Cameronian began in June by finishing third in a \\"stirring\\" finish to the Coronation Cup at Epsom, beaten a head and a short-head by the five-year-old Salmon Leap and Goyescas. In September he ran a close third to Firdaussi, when attempting to give the winner twelve pounds in the Jockey Club Stakes. On his final start he recorded his most important victory since the Derby by beating the three-year-old Dastur in the Champion Stakes. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Cameronian as an \\"average\\" Derby winner.Randall, J and Morris, T. . Portway Press, 1999, p. 137. Stud career Cameronian made a promising start to his stud career by siring the St Leger winner Scottish Union in his first crop of foals. His son Finis won the wartime Gold Cup in 1941, but in the same year Cameronian was sold and exported to Argentina, where he died in 1955.

They play in the Pecos League, an independent baseball league which is not affiliated with Major or Minor League Baseball. Prior to joining the Pecos League, they were a charter franchise of the six- team Pacific Association of Professional Baseball Clubs and were also members of the North American League in 2012. The Pacifics franchise was launched by Centerfield Partners of Dublin, California. Along with a sister team owned and operated by Centerfield Partners, the Sonoma County Grapes, the Pacifics made their debut in the 2012 baseball season at 1,000-seat Albert Park in San Rafael. The team was purchased by Gabe Su√°rez in December 2018 and the Pacifics won the 2019 Pacific Association championship after beating the highly favored Sonoma Stompers in the championship series. The Pacifics were purchased by Andrew Dunn, founder of the Pecos League in March 2020 after the Pacifics and the Pacific Association agreed to not continue their affiliation due to major differences in operating a sound independent baseball league.  North American League  The North American Baseball League was a nine-year- old, ten-team, professional, independent minor league formed from teams of the former Golden Baseball and United Baseball leagues. Play is typically described as A- to AA- caliber baseball, with players primarily coming from previous stints in the major league-affiliated AAA-, AA-, and A- leagues. The North American Baseball League folded in 2012. The Pacifics were the final champions of the league.  Pacific Association of Professional Baseball Clubs (2013‚Äì2019)  The Pacifics' ownership, Redwood Sports and Entertainment, took the four former Northern Division teams from the NAL and created a new league, the Pacific Association of Professional Baseball Clubs. The league initially consisted of the Pacifics, Na Koa Ikaika Maui (also formerly of the GBL), Hawaii Stars, and Sonoma County Grapes. However, the Grapes folded and were replaced by the Vallejo Admirals. In 2014, both Hawaii teams folded and the [onoma Stompers and the Pittsburg Diamonds were added to the league.

It is possible to rephrase such sentences omitting the syntactic expletive \\"it,\\" for example: :\\"That you work hard for the exam is important,\\" or :\\"To work hard for the exam is important.\\" Since subject pronouns are not used in Latin except for emphasis, neither are expletive pronouns and the problem does not arise. For example, the Latin equivalent of it is necessary that you [do something], , translates to 'necessitates to you'. Since English syntax and Latin syntax are not the same, the sentence was and is fully acceptable to native speakers of English and thus was and is widely considered to be proper grammar. It has no meaning here; it merely serves as a dummy subject. (It is sometimes called preparatory it or prep it, or a dummy pronoun.) Bishop Lowth did not condemn sentences that use there as an expletive, for example: :\\"There are ten desks here.\\" The nomenclature used for the constituents of sentences such as this is still a matter of some dispute, but there might be the subject, are the copula, and ten desks a predicate nominal.

Often such words or phrases are regarded as profanity or \\"bad language\\", though there are also inoffensive expletive attributives. The word is derived from the Latin verb ', meaning \\"to fill\\", and it was originally introduced into English in the seventeenth century for various kinds of padding.  Etymology  Expletive comes from the Latin verb ', meaning \\"to fill\\", via ', \\"filling out\\". It was introduced into English in the seventeenth century for various kinds of padding‚Äîthe padding out of a book with peripheral material, the addition of syllables to a line of poetry for metrical purposes, and so forth. Use of expletive for such a meaning is now rare. Rather, expletive is a linguistics term for a meaningless word filling a syntactic vacancy. Outside linguistics, the word is commonly used to refer to \\"bad language\\" or profanity. Some linguists use it as shorthand for \\"expletive attributive\\".  Usage  There are many attributive adjectives and adverbs in English that function to indicate a speaker's anger, irritation or (in some cases) strong approval without otherwise modifying the meaning of the phrase in which they occur. An example is the word bloody as used in the following sentences: :\\"You'd better pray for a bloody miracle if you want to avoid bankruptcy.\\" :\\"That was a bloody good meal.\\" :\\"You'd better bloody well make it happen!\\" An expletive attributive is an intensifier. Unlike other adjective or adverb usage, bloody or bloody well in these sentences do not modify the meaning of miracle, good meal, or make it happen. The expletive attributives here suggest that the speaker feels strongly about the proposition being expressed. Other vulgar words may also be used in this way: :\\"The goddamn policeman tailed me all the goddamn way home.\\" :\\"I fucking hope he fucking chokes on his motherfucking peanuts.\\" Words that are never thought of as offensive can be used in similar ways. For example: :\\"I forgot to pay the phone bill twice running, so the wretched line was cut off.\\" The phone line discussed may (before it was cut off) have been just as good as any other, so would not have been wretched in the literal senses of \\"extremely shoddy\\", \\"devoid of hope\\" or similar. Rather, wretched serves here as a politer equivalent of expletive bloody and the like.  Infixation and interposition  Besides usual positioning for adverbs and attributive adjectives, expletive attributives can be found in unusual positions where others rarely are (including other intensifiers). Although considered colloquial at best, they are inserted:James B.

Previously it was the parish church of St Margaret's Without (that is, outside the city walls of Rochester). Thorpe records it as having previously been called St Margaret's in Suthgate. The building is a Grade II* listed building, English Heritage number 173172. History The first record of St Margaret's is in an 1108 charter of Bishop Gundulf. From the time of Bishop Gundulph until the appointment of William Talvez in 1272 as Vicar, St. Margaret's was a chapel of the parish of St. Nicholas. There was at that time no separate parish church of St. Nicholas, instead the parochial altar was housed in the nave of Rochester Cathedral. From this dependency Wheatley has suggested that St. Margaret's was a chapel of ease to the Cathedral, but the Cathedral itself was never a parish church. During the reign of King Richard I (1157‚Äì1199), bishop Gilbert de Glanville gave the church to his hospital in Strood. After several appeals to the pope the monks of Rochester regained control of it in 1255. The early vicars, up to 1401, received only a yearly stipend from the convent. A settlement in that year endowed the church and established a vicarage and lands for the support of it. In 1488 the convent finally relinquished control, the bishop reserving to himself episcopal rights. In 1540, during the reformation, the church was surrendered into the King's hands and subsequently settled on the newly founded Dean and Chapter of Rochester. The earliest, and only medieval, part of the building is the tower which was either constructed or restored in 1465. The medieval church consisted of a nave and two chancels to the south of the nave, of this nothing remains. During the reign of Charles II of England (de facto 1660‚Äì1685) a coronet \\"set round with precious stones\\" was dug up in the churchyard. It was supposed locally that a Saxon King had been buried there. The original parish was rural, stretching from the city walls of Rochester in the North to Borstal in the South. During the 18th and 19th centuries the City of Rochester expanded South into the parish. Expansion of Rochester to the North and West is blocked by the River Medway and to the East by Chatham. The medieval church became inadequate for the growing population and in 1823 rebuilding started. The nave was complete the following year, the original chancel, tower and side chapels being retained. With the exception of the tower the medieval buildings were demolished a few years later and by 1840 the basic fabric of the present building was complete. A new East window was installed in 1872. Internally the 1840 triple-decker pulpit was lowered and moved in 1872, as were the box pews from the nave. At the same time the west end gallery was removed and the original barrel organ replaced with a small organ at the East of the South aisle built by George Holdich of London. This organ was not to last for long, for in 1877 it was replaced by the current organ, which necessitated removing the gallery above it. A new reredos and altar were added in the early 20th century. Following amalgamation of the parishes of St Margaret and St Peter, St Margaret's again became a chapel of ease. Severe damage to the roof in the storms of 1987 and 1990 added to existing consideration of its closure. However local efforts have kept the building viable and over ¬£100,000 has been spent on internal improvements. Architecture =Exterior= Externally the main body of the church is an undistinguished 19th century building. The plan is nearly a plain rectangle with rendered brick walls and a low pitched slate roof. The side windows are typical iron frames of the period, with separate gallery and ground floor openings. The East end features the 1872 Neo-gothic window with three lights. St. Margaret's, Rochester ‚Äì geograph.org.uk ‚Äì 1346237 The West end is dominated by the medieval stone tower. The stone is random laid ragstone with flint dressings in parts. The tower is crenellated with three stages. The lowest stage is divided externally by a string course between the door and the window. Above it is the old ringing chamber and above that the bell chamber. In the Northeast corner of the tower, adjacent to the nave wall is a small stair turret with an external door. This gives access to the old ringing chamber, the bell chamber and the roof. There are three step diagonal buttresses on the Western corners, the East of the tower is effectively buttressed by the nave. A perpendicular style three light window above the West door illuminates the ground floor. A lych gate to the south of the church leads into the southern section of the graveyard which has generally been levelled. Some of the stones form a path from the lych gate to the nave door and beyond to the west door. Others have been placed against the boundary wall. The resulting area is pleasant open grass with superb views across the Medway valley. Conversely, the tower dominates the skyline when viewed from Strood. The northern section of the graveyard (which has its own access from the street) has more of the grave markers still in situ. The east end of the church has additional doors leading to the vestries and the stairs to the gallery. In 2008 the tower had a major restoration with some replacement of stones. The roofs (tower and turret) were replaced and work to the bell chamber louvres was carried out. =Interior= The interior of the church is based on the 1824 preaching chapel design. The rectangular interior is reduced in width at the East end by vestries and stairs. The galleries down both sides contribute to an impression only of a cruciform shape. The supporting wooden columns are in Doric style below and are carried up to the ceiling as Ionic style. The base of the tower is a few steps lower than the nave and is the current ringing chamber. The present choir stalls were installed in 1898. The 21st century has seen two adaptions at the West end. A kitchen has been built in the Northwest corner and a WC in the Southwest.

It was modified and extended by F. H. Browne of Canterbury in 1902. There is a single pedal stop, a 16-foot bourdon. The great has 8-foot open diapason, stopped diapason treble, stopped diapason bass, dulciana and gamba; 4-foot principal and flute; -foot twelfth and 2-foot fifteenth. The swell has 8-foot open diapason, gedact, slicional, oboe and horn as well as 4-foot gemshorn. =Bells= There is a ring of eight bells, with the tenor weighing tuned to G flat hung in the English style for full circle ringing. Five bells were recorded in 1552, but the earliest extant bell is from 1621. This is currently number 6 but was then the third of five. Three years later the number 7 bell (then the fourth) was recast. In 1761 the 4 and 8 (then treble and tenor) were recast. In 1790 number 5 (then the second) was recast and a new treble added to make a six-bell ring. However, Hasted records five bells in 1798, which was the position before the 1790 recasting and augmentation. In 1884 the 4 and 8 (then two and six) were again recast. Finally in 1896 two new trebles were added to make the existing ring of eight. For the latter quarter of the 20th century, the bells were unringable, but a major project in 2005‚Äì2006 saw the bells removed, retuned (at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry) and rehung in a new frame. They are now rung from the ground floor instead of the 1960 ringing chamber.

The book was published in 1955, after Moore had left Ireland and was living in Canada. It was rejected by ten American publishers before being accepted by a British publisher. Diana Athill's memoir, Stet (2000), has information about the publishing of Judith Hearne. Set in Belfast in the 1950s, Judith Hearne has been described as \\"a sensitive study of a middle-aged alcoholic woman in drab Belfast and her desperate last attempts at finding love and companionship\\". Ann Leary, reviewing the book for NPR, calls it \\"a short book about a lifetime of longing\\" and says \\"Moore uses brilliant economy in his writing; it's as if words are as scarce and precious as sunshine in this gloomy section of postwar Belfast\\". According to Colm T√≥ib√≠n, the book \\"is full of Joycean moments... it takes from ‚ÄòClay‚Äô, the most mysterious story in Dubliners, the idea of a single, middle-aged woman visiting a family and finding both comfort and humiliation there\\". Robert Fulford, writing in Canada's The Globe and Mail, describes it as \\"a bleak post-Catholic novel\\" that depicts \\"a desolate life, stripped of warming humanity\\". Moore won the Authors' Club First Novel Award and the Beta Sigma Phi award for this work, although it was not his first novel. A film based on the book, but with the story relocated to Dublin, was released in 1987 with Maggie Smith in the title role. The book was republished by HarperCollins, under the title The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne, on 16 July 2007 in the Harper Perennial Modern Classics series (; ). Critical reception On 5 November 2019, BBC News listed The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne on its list of the 100 most influential novels. Commenting in the Belfast Telegraph, writer Carlo G√©bler said: \\" [T]he author communicates her specificity (she is a lonely, damaged, needy, alcoholic, Catholic middle-aged woman who yearns for love) with enormous tenderness and precision.\\" His technique, he added: \\"combines third person omniscient narrative with first person stream of consciousness material: by combining the two (and he does this deftly) Moore.. tells his story and he allows us unfettered access to the private interior world of the people he is writing about.\\" References Category:1955 British novels Category:1955 Canadian novels Category:1955 debut novels Category:Canadian novels adapted into films Category:Irish novels adapted into films Category:New Canadian Library Category:Novels by Brian Moore Category:Novels set in Belfast ","title":"Judith Hearne"},{"id":"33634815","text":"The winter-over syndrome is a condition that occurs in individuals who \\"winter-over\\" throughout the Antarctic (or Arctic) winter, which can last seven to eight months. It has been observed in inhabitants of research stations in Antarctica, as well as in polar bases such as Thule, Alert and Eureka. It consists of a variety of behavioral and medical disturbances, including irritability, depression, insomnia, absentmindedness, aggressive behavior, and irritable bowel syndrome.  Contributing factors  The Antarctic winter is a period of no physical contact with other continents or Antarctic stations, including no airplanes, ships, or mail. The area has the driest desert climate on Earth, and a low air pressure and oxygen-poor atmosphere. It is completely cut off during winter, the mean temperature is , and the lowest recorded temperature is . For these reasons, the immobility, monotony, harsh physical environment, sexual deprivation, and the general isolation, are believed to contribute to increased anxiety and depression among the residents of the station. Several studies have been done over the years to determine the contributing causes, or stresses, of \\"winter-over\\" syndrome. These include stress, social isolation, subsyndromal seasonal affective disorder and polar T3 syndrome. It would appear that the cold, danger, and hardships are not major stresses. The most important psychological stresses appear to be: the problem of individual adjustment to the group, the relative monotony of the environment, and the absence of certain accustomed sources of emotional satisfaction. In addition to isolation from the outside world, there is confinement or lack of isolation within the research stations themselves. During fieldwork conducted at McMurdo and South Pole stations in 1988 and 1989, informants complained that the lack of privacy and constant gossip that existed within the community, had a negative influence on social relationships, especially between men and women. As a result, 60% of one's leisure time is spent alone in a dorm room, whereas others are forced to work and live in confined spaces, due to the nature of their work. Symptoms While research around the winter-over syndrome dates back to the 1950s, there is no set of exclusive indicators that can typically reveal a diagnosis of the same. \\"Our analyses of the human experience in Antarctica suggest that there are few, if any, traits that serve as useful predictors of performance during the austral winter,\\" Palinkas wrote in a paper called \\"The Psychology of Antarctic Research.\\" Some of the symptoms included depression, insomnia, anger or irritability, feelings of hostility towards those around you, diminished cognitive performance including difficulty in concentration and memory, absentmindedness, and the occurrence of mild hypnotic states known as 'long- eye' or the 'Antarctic stare'. Bill Spindler, documenting his extensive research on the Antarctic, attributes the effects of sensory deprivation, isolation, and maybe even the effect of extreme cold on the thyroid gland which can cause memory loss, sleepiness or sluggishness.

He attained the rank of major generalCoordination of Government Activities in the Territories and fought in five Arab-Israeli wars, including the wars of 1948 and 1973. Among his many exploits was a daring operation involving leading a paratroop force across the Suez Canal during the Yom Kippur War. The operation was the beginning phase of a larger Israeli counter offensive that ultimately led to the defeat of the Egyptian army. Early life Matt was born on December 10, 1927, in Cologne, Germany. He immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1934. His military career began in 1943 when he joined the British Mandatory Coastal Police but he covertly utilized his status in the Coastal Police to assist the nascent Palyam in its attempts to subvert anti-Jewish British immigration policies. He then attempted to join the British Army's Jewish Brigade but, despite his service with the Coastal Police, was rejected because of his youth. He then pressured his father to sign a false document indicating that he was 18 years old and presented this document to gain acceptance. He saw service in Egypt, Italy and the Netherlands. In 1946, he left the British army, returned to Israel and joined the Palmach, the Jewish para-military strike force. War of 1948 During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, Matt manned a machine-gun post at Ein Tzurim (renamed Rosh Tzurim following the Six-Day War), part of the block of settlements just south of Jerusalem that formed the Gush Etzion block. Arab attacks on the block were sporadic at first but intensified as the British departure date neared. In May 1948, Arab irregulars backed by the Jordanian Legion attacked the Gush Etzion block. Matt stood his ground and sprayed machine gun fire into the attacking forces. The fighting was so intense that at one point, he was throwing hand grenades with his right hand while firing the machine gun with his left. However, with supplies and ammunition exhausted and hopelessly outnumbered, the defenders were ordered by the nascent Israeli government to surrender and Matt was taken prisoner by the Jordanian Legion, however Matt managed to escape and ran into a forest. Matt was known for having a very large beard and as a result, he ripped it off with only his hands and walked out of the forest un-recognised by the Jordanians. Border wars Danny Matt (third from right with beard and beret) with members of 890th Paratroop Battalion Following his release from captivity, Matt returned to civilian life for a short duration but soon returned the IDF. He enrolled in an officer's training course and was given command of a unit responsible for thwarting Arab infiltrations into southern Israel. Ariel Sharon took note of Matt's military talents and persuaded him to join the elite and newly formed Battalion 890. The Battalion, a merge of the paratroops with members of Unit 101, was at the forefront of Israel's counter insurgency and retaliatory operations of the 1950s. Sharon appointed Matt to be a Company Commander. In February 1955 Matt along with Aharon Davidi led a force of 150 paratroopers on a night raid against an Egyptian military encampment in Gaza killing 37 Egyptian soldiers.Karmel, Hasi, Intelligence for peace: the role of intelligence in times of peace, Frank Cass Publishers, (London 1999), p. 56 The raid, which was carried out in retaliation for the murder of an Israeli boy on orders from Egyptian military intelligence,Karmel 1999, p. 56 was hailed as a success by Israeli Defense Minister David Ben-Gurion.Oren, Michael, Origins of the second Arab-Israeli war: Egypt, Israel and the great powers, Frank Cass (Abingdon, Oxon 1992) p. 25 Suez War During the Sinai Campaign of 1956, Matt took part in the battle for the Mitla Pass and was wounded in the neck and shoulder. Some 260 Egyptian and 38 Israeli soldiers were killed in the battle.Katz, Sam, Israeli elite units since 1948, Osprey (1988) p. 12 After his recovery, he was given various command positions within the military. Six Day War During the Six Day war of 1967, Matt commanded a reserve paratroopers brigade assigned to General Ariel Sharon's division and was tasked with silencing Egyptian artillery positions at Um-Katef in the Abu Ageila military complex. After being heliported deep into the enemy's rear, Matt's paratroopers marched several miles over dune-covered ground and surprised the Egyptian gunners and neutralized their artillery. The feat enabled General Sharon to mount a divisional assault unmolested by Egyptian artillery.Lt. Col David Eshel, Mid-East wars: The Israeli Commandos, Eshel- Dramit (1979), p. 31‚Äì33 On June 10, 1967, on the last day of the war, Matt's paratroops ferried by helicopter secured the southern Golan Heights defeating Syrian forces they encountered.Paratroopers Brigade: Israel's wars War of Attrition Following the Six Day war, Egypt and Israel became locked in a series of localized engagements along the Suez Canal. In addition, Palestinian guerilla groups staged infiltrations and terrorist attacks with the (ultimately unsuccessful) aim of establishing a permanent presence in the West Bank. During this period, Matt was given command of Paratroop Brigade 35. On March 21, 1968 he led the brigade in an assault against the Palestinian guerilla base at Karameh. Matt's men along with other infantry elements destroyed the Karameh base killing 150 guerillas and taking another 128 captive. Jordanian forces who attempted to intervene suffered 61 killed, 108 injured and four taken prisoner.Paratroop Brigade: The war of Attrition The IDF sustained 28 KIA and eight of these were from Matt's paras. As a result of the operation, the guerrillas realized that they were vulnerable to Israeli reprisal actions and were forced to move their base of operations farther from the border.Herzog, The Arab-Israeli Wars, Random House New York, 1982 @ page 205 Matt also led his para forces on a daring deep penetration commando raid into the heart of Egypt's Nile valley. On the night of 31 October/1 November, Matt's troops, ferried by Super Frelon helicopters over some 300 km of Egyptian airspace, attacked and destroyed two bridges over the Nile as well as an electrical transformer near the town of Nag Hammadi.Gawrych, Walter, H, The albatross of decisive victory: war and policy between Egypt and Israel in the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli wars, Greenwood publishing (2000), p. 103 The Israelis suffered no casualties but the damage to Egypt was immense and underscored its vulnerabilities to Israel's formidable commandos. Yom Kippur war On October 6, 1973, Egypt and Syria launched a multi-front, surprise attack on Israel. After neutralizing the Syrian threat, the Israelis turned their attention southward to deal with the Egyptians, who had by now dug into defensive positions on the east bank of the Suez Canal. On October 14, large Israeli and Egyptian tank formations dueled in Sinai in a battle that was decidedly one-sided in Israel's favor and resulted in a thorough Egyptian rout. The Egyptians lost some 260 tanks against only six Israeli.Yom Kippur War: Embattled Israeli Bridgehead at Chinese Farm, Historynet.com, August 21, 2006 Capitalizing on their success, the Israelis embarked upon Operation Stouthearted Men, a complex plan involving a multi-divisional crossing of the Suez Canal. These forces would then encircle the Egyptian army. Spearheading the operation was the 247th Paratroopers Reserve Brigade under the command of Danny Matt.John Laffin, Mike Chappell, The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948‚Äì73, Osprey (1982), p. 19 On the night of October 15, Matt and his brigade crossed the Canal and established a bridgehead on the western bank of the Canal Zone. Matt played a critical role in this operation, which ultimately resulted in the encirclement and defeat of the Egyptian army. Other military duties and appointments Following the war, Matt was given command of the 90th reserve armored division. In 1974, he was appointed head of the Military Court of Appeals. From 1979 until 1982 he served as Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories. From 1982 through 1992 he served as the Ombudsman for the soldiers, a role established by the Knesset in 1972 to address concerns and problems encountered by soldiers. In 1992, he retired thus ending 49 years of distinguished military service. Despite his retirement from the army, Matt's commitment to the Israel Defense Forces did not diminish. In his civilian life, Matt served as chairman of the LIBI Fund, a nonprofit organization that assists IDF soldiers.Katz, Yaakov, LIBI Fund board resigns in protest of Barak appointee, The Jerusalem Post, December 28, 2010 Death Matt died at the age of 85 on December 5, 2013, at Sheba Medical Center in Tel HaShomer, Israel.

Plot  Encyclopaedia Britannica describes The Luck of Ginger Coffey as being about an \\"Irish-born Canadian immigrant whose self-deluded irresponsible behaviour nearly breaks up his family\\". The book's protagonist, James Francis Coffey, is called \\"Ginger\\" because of his reddish hair and moustache. He is unfulfilled in his career, no matter which job he takes. After his release from the Army, he and his wife, Veronica, together with their daughter Paulie, move to Montreal. In Canada, Coffey still has trouble finding work. Veronica gets very upset when she finds out that Ginger is still unemployed and has spent their ticket money home. However broke and empty-hearted they may be, they do have one friend to count on in Canada: Gerry Grosvenor, who helps Coffey get a job working as a proofreader at a newspaper. Coffey is unimpressed once again and continues to tell Veronica it will all get better, but Veronica has her own plans for improving her life in Canada. She leaves Coffey for Grosvenor and takes Paulie with her. She also takes all of Coffey's money and most of his belongings. Coffey gets a small place at the YMCA, and during his stay there he encounters a man who offers him a diaper delivery and pick-up job. Coffey finds this job even more repulsive than his current one but takes it anyway, with a plan in mind: To get back at Paulie and impress Veronica with his selflessness. Veronica is still unconvinced, but Paulie turns to her father's side and they get a flat of their own. Coffey is obsessed with Veronica and begins to get sick from lack of sleep and food and an excessive work schedule. He is also obsessed with being promoted to reporter so that Veronica will take him back, but unfortunately she only brings up the topic of divorce. After many drunk excursions, fist fights with Gerry, a run-in with the police and promotion battles, Veronica finally sees how hard Ginger is working and fighting for her, and at the moment when he finally decides to let her go she sees just how much he really loves her.

It starts at the junction station of Herlasgr√ºner on the Leipzig‚ÄìHof railway and runs via Auerbach to Falkenstein. The southern part of the line from Falkenstein via Bergen to Oelsnitz was closed in 1951. History  The Herlasgr√ºn-Oelsnitz line was opened in 1865 as part of the Voigtland State Railway () from Herlasgr√ºn to Cheb (then a mainly German speaking city called Eger in the Kingdom of Bohemia, which formed part of the Austrian Empire). The track was opened on 1 November 1865. In 1874, when a connecting line was opened from Plauen to Oelsnitz, traffic between Herlasgr√ºner and Oelsnitz via Falkenstein decreased dramatically, because now all through traffic ran on the shorter and faster line via Plauen. The former main line was reclassified as a secondary line on 15 October 1878. Because of the low traffic volume, it was decided in 1951 to dismantle the Lottengr√ºn‚ÄìOelsnitz section in favour of so-called priority projects. Arguing that the rail track was needed for the construction of the Berlin outer ring, the line was closed on 27 April 1951 and the track was dismantled a little later. The section between Falkenstein and Lottengr√ºn remained in operation until 1970 / 72 as part of the Falkenstein‚ÄìPlauen line. On 26 September 1970, the line was closed for passenger traffic; freight traffic continued to serve the slate quarries in Theuma until the autumn of 1972. In 1978, the track between the 24.6 km mark and Lottengr√ºn station was dismantled. The remaining track from Falkenstein to the 24.6 km mark was still operated as a siding of the Wismut uranium mine. In subsequent years, this track was used for the parking of damaged wagons bound for the Zwickau repair shop. It is also used during the 1996 upgrading of the junction in Falkenstein. In the mid-1990s, the remaining section of the line, which connected Reichenbach and Zwickau to Adorf and Klingenthal, was selected by the state of Saxony as a pilot project for the revitalisation of endangered branch lines. After an extensive renewal of the track in 1996 / 97 the line speed was raised to 80 km/h. Since 1997, the line has only been served by regional services operated by the private Vogtlandbahn company. The disused Falkenstein‚ÄìOelsnitz section has been converted to a cycle route, which was opened in May 2011.

From 1681, he also carried the title of Count in Ebeleben, and from 1716 Count in Arnstadt.  Life  Christian William was born and died in Sondershausen, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen. He was a son of Count Anton G√ºnther I of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen and his wife Countess Palatine Maria Magdalene of Birkenfeld (1622‚Äì1689). In 1666 he succeeded his father jointly with his brother Anton G√ºnther II. In 1681, they divided the country and Anton G√ºnther became Count of Schwarzburg-Arnstadt. On 3 September 1697, the brothers were raised to Imperial Princes by Emperor Leopold I. Anton G√ºnther died in 1716 and Arnstadt fell back to Christian William. He concluded a treaty of succession with his brother, in which the indivisibility of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen was established and primogeniture would determine the succession. After Prince Louis Frederick I of Schwarzburg- Rudolstadt joined the treaty in 1710, it was confirmed in 1719 by Emperor Charles VI. During Christian Williams reign, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen broke away from the increasing dominance of the Electorate of Saxony. He renovated his Sondershausen Palace and reshaped it from a Renaissance style to a Baroque style. A cultural center in northern Thuringia was named after him.  Marriage and issue  In 1672, Christian Williams was engaged with the hymn poet Ludmilla Elisabeth of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, but she died unexpectedly later that year.

The mining complex is located in the Lualaba Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Kolwezi is about northwest from Lubumbashi, the provincial capital. Ore body The Kolwezi ore district lies near the northwest limit of the Katanga Copperbelt. It holds over half of the copper and cobalt in the copperbelt. The Musonoi mine is located in a dolomitic inferior formation of the Roan Group, Katanga Supergroup, from the Precambrian IV age. It is deeply affected by folds and thrust nappes. Two ore bodies about thick are known, containing copper, cobalt, manganese and uranium. The mine has a rare assemblage of uranyl selenite minerals, and has palladium minerals. Pre-history The Dikuluwe mine near Musonoi has been exploited since prehistoric times. Monseigneur de Hemptinne watched Yeke people working this mine as late as 1924. They would work in the dry season, stopping when the first rains arrived. The mining camp was near a stream where millet could be planted. Women and children collected malachite from the surface, while men used iron picks to excavate pits and shafts, using fire to crack the rocks when needed. The mines were between and deep with galleries up to long. The ore would be sorted and then taken to a nearby stream for concentration before being smelted. Commercial operations A steam shovel loading copper and cobalt ore to be processed at Musonoi Mine in the 1980s or the 1990s. Commercial mining at Musonoi began in the 1920s, with laborers being forcibly recruited. The Union Miniere constantly struggled to prevent recruits fleeing from the site, sometimes taking refuge in Angola. Workers were mistreated and suffered badly from disease brought on by the working conditions. The lowest death rate at the Panda, Lubumbashi, Kisanga and Musonoi work sites in 1928 was four men per month. By the 1930s, the operation at Musonoi was highly mechanized, while world demand for copper was dropping. Workers used sabotage and arson as well as flight as bargaining tools for better conditions. Musonoi Principal, the oldest open cut, was opened in the 1940s. By 1953 the open pit mine was the largest copper and cobalt producer in the country. Another cut was begun in the 1950s and a third in the 1970s. The three were eventually combined and connected with the Kamoto mines. Tailings The Kolwezi tailings project was initiated in 2004 to recover tailings from two deposits, the Kingamyambo tailings dam and the Musunoi river tailings. Due to poor recovery rates when the mines were operational, these tailings hold valuable quantities of copper. In September 2010 the Kolwezi tailings project was the subject of a complaint to the UK regulator by Canadian company First Quantum Minerals. First Quantum's project had been seized by the DRC government. The company alleged that ENRC, which had acquired a large share in the project, had misled investors over the acquisition. The Musonoi River Tailings are now within Area 3 at Musonoi.

The strike lasted from 24 October 1932 to 8 January 1933 and was moderate and non-violent in character as opposed to the 1928 South Indian Railway Strike which was extremely violent.  Prelude  There were protests against retrenchment policies in the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway throughout 1931 and early 1932. On 24 October 1932, a major strike erupted in the Mechanical Workshops of the Perambur branch of the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway company.  Events  The strike began on 24 October 1932 in Perambur demanding the reinstation of 93 railway workers who had been laid off, the previous year. On 3 November, the employees of the engineering workshop at Arakkonam joined in the strike. This was followed by a strike of the employees of engineering and mechanical workshops at Hubli in Bombay Presidency. Consequently, there were strikes in Bezawada, Betragunta and Rajahmundry. A settlement was eventually reached when the Sheriff of Madras brokered a peace between the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway and the striking workers. The strike was called off on 8 January 1933 at the instance of Jamnadas Mehta and V. V. Giri.  Support  The Nizam Guaranteed State Railway Workers' Union, the B. N. Railway Labour Union, the jute farmers of Nellimarla, the workers at the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills, the International Transport Workers Federation, British Trade Union Congress, Railway Clerks Association, National Union of Railways of Great Britain and the International Federation of Trade Unions contributed enormous amounts of money for the strike relief fund. The B. N. Railway Labour Union also resolved to observe 13 November 1932 as \\"M&SM; Railway Strike Day\\".

The project was developed by the Canadian mining companies Adastra Minerals and then First Quantum Minerals between 2004 and 2009, when the DRC government revoked First Quantum's license. Location Kolwezi is a town of about 200,000 people in the Katanga Province of the DRC. It has been a mining center for 100 years. The main river valley is filled with tailings, and there are extensive pits, waste rock dumps and tailings deposits. The air is polluted by wind-blown tailings. Infrastructure such as roads, water supply and management, schools and hospitals was once good, but as of 2004 it was poorly maintained. The state mining company G√©camines no longer provided the high level of social support of the past, and there was very high unemployment. The labor force is skilled and had high expectations of the tailings recovery project. Project The state-owned G√©camines started operating a mineral concentrator at Kolwezi in 1952, taking ores from the western Katanga open pit mines and producing copper concentrates. The tailings still contain significant amounts of metal. The project entails construction of a plant to process the copper and cobalt tailings in the Kingamyambo tailings dam and the Musunoi river tailings, which have an estimated total metal content of 1,676,000 tonnes of copper and 363,000 tonnes of cobalt. A Durban company, Metso ND Engineering, was selected to build the equipment. It was expected to produce around 70,000 tonnes per year of copper metal and up to 14,000 tonnes per year of cobalt hydroxide. Ownership In June 2004, the Canadian Adastra Minerals acquired the right from the DRC Ministry of Mines to exploit the tailings. In February 2006 it was reported that Adastra was putting together the financing to build a tailings recovery plant. At that time, Adastra was facing a hostile takeover bid from the larger First Quantum Minerals. Following the take-over, the project was operated by a consortium of First Quantum Minerals (65%), with G√©camines and institutional investors having minority shares. In August 2009, the DRC government revoked First Quantum's license due to a dispute over renegotiating the contract. First Quantum stopped operations in September 2009, throwing about 700 people out of work. First Quantum had spent $750 million on acquiring and developing the property. First Quantum took out an action against the DRC government in the International Chamber of Commerce Court of Arbitration. In June 2010 the Financial Times of Canada reported that the property was now owned by a British Virgin Islands company called Highwind Properties. Highwinds was allegedly linked to a major shareholder in Nikanor, a DRC-based copper mining company that had merged with Katanga Mining in 2007. In August 2010 it emerged that the Kazakh Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) had acquired the property through its British Virgin Islands subsidiary. First Quantum alleged that ENRC had misled investors by failing to tell them of the disputed ownership. In January 2012, First Quantum settled its action against the Government and ENRC for US$1.25-billion, 'First Quantum was happy with how the litigation was going, and was confident it would get compensation in the future. However, that day was a long way off. At the same time, the legal action was a problem for ENRC, which could not get to work on the DRC projects while ownership was under dispute. The situation was also a negative for the DRC government, which endured enormous criticism from the international community. Additionally, the government had to deal with thousands of furious Congolese people that lost their jobs when the assets were seized. It is understood the government was eager to end the arbitration. ENRC approached First Quantum last fall in an attempt to settle, sources said. Broad negotiations would be nearly impossible with so much tension between the two sides. Instead, each company nominated a negotiator, and they reached an agreement that hands US$1.25-billion to First Quantum. ENRC gets a legal ceasefire and proper claims to all of First Quantum‚Äôs DRC assets, while the arbitration against the government is dropped.'

It operated under contract for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), a government body set up specifically to deal with the nuclear legacy under the Energy Act 2004. In September 2019, it became a direct subsidiary of the NDA. Magnox Ltd is responsible for the decommissioning of ten Magnox nuclear power stations and two former research facilities in the United Kingdom. The twelve sites are located at Berkeley, Bradwell, Chapelcross, Dungeness A, Hinkley Point A, Hunterston A, Oldbury, Sizewell A, Trawsfynydd, Wylfa, Harwell and Winfrith. All the sites have ceased production. In addition, as part of the Trawsfynydd unit, Magnox Ltd operates a hydro-electric power station at Maentwrog. The only Magnox power station in the United Kingdom not managed by Magnox Ltd is Calder Hall, which is part of the Sellafield site and is controlled by Sellafield Ltd.  History  Magnox Ltd is the successor company to Magnox Electric, which was created in 1996 to take ownership of the Magnox assets from 'Nuclear Electric' and 'Scottish Nuclear'. The remaining nuclear power stations of these two companies, seven advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) sites and one pressurized water reactor (PWR) site, were transferred to a separate company, 'British Energy', which was then privatised in 1996. In January 1998, Magnox Electric came under the control of another government-owned company, 'British Nuclear Fuels', operating as 'BNFL Magnox Generation'. Following the reorganisation of the UK nuclear industry in 2005 ownership of BNFL's Magnox sites transferred to the newly created 'Nuclear Decommissioning Authority' ('NDA'). BNFL created a new subsidiary, 'Reactor Sites Management Company' ('RSMC'), to manage and operate Magnox Electric on behalf of the NDA. In June 2007, BNFL sold RSMC to the newly formed US company EnergySolutions; and transferred operational and management responsibilities of Magnox sites to the US company. Bradwell nuclear power station while under the control of Magnox South On 1 October 2008, Magnox Electric was split into two companies based on the locations of the sites. Magnox North became the operator of Chapelcross, Hunterston A, Oldbury, Trawsfynydd and Wylfa. Magnox SouthMagnox South Ltd annual report became and operator of Berkeley, Bradwell, Dungeness, Hinkley Point A and Sizewell A. Both companies continued to be managed by RSMC. In January 2011, to reduce costs and to help extend best practices across all sites, it was decided to reverse the split with Magnox North and Magnox South recombining as Magnox Ltd. In 2015, the Harwell and Winfrith sites managed by Research Sites Restoration Limited (RSRL) were brought under the management of Magnox Ltd. In 2017, the NDA decided to terminate the contract with Cavendish Fluor Partnership believing a simplified approach would provide a more efficient decommissioning programme. Magnox Ltd became a subsidiary of the NDA on 3 September 2019. In February 2018, the UK parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) concluded that the NDA had \\"dramatically under-estimated\\" costs and \\"completely failed\\" in the procurement and management of the contract, which was one of the highest value contracts let by the government. An independent inquiry into the deal was set up.

Life and career Baguer was born in Barcelona in March 1768 and received his first musical training from his uncle, Francesc Mariner, who was composer and organist in the cathedral in Barcelona. He became deputy organist to Mariner in 1786 and replaced him when his uncle died in 1789, a position he held until his own death. Although Baguer was ordained a priest, he resigned this position in 1801. He died in Barcelona in 1808, on the same day that French troops occupied Barcelona during the Peninsular War. His students include Mateu Ferrer (who replaced Baguer as organist of the cathedral), Ramon Carnicer (between 1806 and 1808) and possibly Bernat Bertran. He was one of the most important musical figures in Catalonia at the time and was known as a virtuosic performer and improviser on the organ. Works Perhaps Baguer's most important works are his nineteen symphonies, which rank him, along with Luigi Boccherini and Gaetano Brunetti, as one of the principal composers of symphonies in Spain at the time. Most of his symphonies clearly show the influence of the Italian and German masters, in particular Pleyel and Haydn. He also wrote a concerto for two bassoons, an English horn concerto (which is now lost), a series of six duets for flute and many individual keyboard works. In addition he composed a great deal of religious music, such as masses and Psalms, for use in the Church of St. Philip Neri and the Barcelona Cathedral, and an opera, The Philosopher Princess, which premiered in 1797 at the Teatre Principal in Barcelona. =Symphonies= * Symphony No. 1 in C major * Symphony No. 2 in C minor (1790) * Symphony No. 3 in D major * Symphony No. 4 in D major * Symphony No. 5 in D major * Symphony No. 6 in D major * Symphony No. 7 in D major * Symphony No. 8 in D major * Symphony No. 9 in D major * Symphony No. 10 in D major * Symphony No. 11 in D major * Symphony No. 12 in E flat major (c. 1786) * Symphony No. 13 in E flat major * Symphony No. 14 in E flat major * Symphony No. 15 in E flat major * Symphony No. 16 in G major (c. 1790) * Symphony No. 17 in B flat major * Symphony No. 18 in B flat major (1790) * Symphony No. 19 in B flat major (1790) =Concertos= * Concerto for two bassoons and orchestra in F major * English horn concerto (1801) (now lost) =Chamber music= * Sonata No. 2 in G minor for keyboard * Sonata No. 4 in A major for keyboard * Sonata No. 16 in E flat major * Sonata No. 52 (?)

He founded the modern city of Bhopal, the capital of the Madhya Pradesh state. Dost Mohammad Khan, from a painting at Golghar Museum A Pashtun from Tirah, Dost Mohammad Khan joined the Mughal Army at Delhi in 1703. He rapidly rose through the ranks, and was assigned to the Malwa province in central India. After the death of the emperor Aurangzeb, Khan started providing mercenary services to several local chieftains in the politically unstable Malwa region. In 1709, he took on the lease of Berasia estate, while serving the small Rajput principality of Mangalgarh as a mercenary. He invited his Pashtun kinsmen to Malwa to create a group of loyal associates. Khan successfully protected Mangalgarh from its other Rajput neighbors, married into its royal family, and took over the state after the death of its heirless dowager Rani. Khan sided with the local Rajput chiefs of Malwa in a rebellion against the Mughal empire. Defeated and wounded in the ensuing battle, he ended up helping an injured Sayyid Hussain Ali Khan Barha, one of the Sayyid Brothers. This helped him gain the friendship of the Sayyid Brothers, who had become highly influential king-makers in the Mughal court. Subsequently, Khan annexed several territories in Malwa to his state. Khan also provided mercenary services to the Rani Kamlapati, the ruler of a small Gond kingdom, and received the territory of Bhopal (then a small village) in lieu of payment. After the Rani's death, he killed her son and annexed the Gond kingdom. During the early 1720s, he transformed the village of Bhopal into a fortified city, and claimed the title of Nawab, which was used by the Muslim rulers of princely states in India. Khan's support to the Sayyid Brothers earned him the enmity of the rival Mughal nobleman Nizam-ul-Mulk. The Nizam invaded Bhopal in March 1724, forcing Khan to cede much of his territory, give away his son as hostage and accept the Nizam's suzerainty. In his final years, Khan sought inspiration from Sufi mystics and saints, veering towards spiritualism. He and the other Pathans who settled in Bhopal during his reign, brought the Pathan and Islamic influence to the culture and architecture of Bhopal. At its zenith, the Bhopal State comprised a territory of around . Nearly a century after Khan's death, the state became a British protectorate in 1818, and was ruled by the descendants of Dost Mohammad Khan till 1949, when it was merged with the Dominion of India.  Early life  Dost Mohammad Khan was born in the Tirah region of Bangash district on the western frontier of the Mughal Empire (now in Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan). His father Nur Mohammad Khan was a Pashtun nobleman belonging to the Mirazikhel clan of the Orakzai tribe.\\"Mirazi\\" is probably of \\"Mir Aziz\\". (Shaharyar M. Khan, 2000) This tribe lives in Tirah and the Peshawar region. In his mid-20s, Dost Mohammad Khan was engaged to Mehraj Bibi, an attractive girl from a neighboring Orakzai clan. However, Mehraj was later betrothed to his cousin, because Khan's character was seen as too aggressive and rough. An angry Khan killed his cousin, leading to his ostracism from his family. Attracted by the promise of a bright future in the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb's service, Khan set out for Jalalabad, near Delhi, where his Pashtun relatives had settled. He was welcomed by the family of his relative Jalal Khan, the Mughal mansabdar (a military aristocrat) of Jalalabad's suburb Lohari. He arrived in Jalalabad sometime between 1696 and 1703, and spent some time with Jalal Khan's family. During a birthday celebration, a fight broke out between Dost and one of Jalal Khan's sons, over one of the young housemaids. Jalal Khan's son attacked Dost with a bow and arrow, and Dost killed him with a dagger in retaliation. Following this incident, Dost Mohammad Khan decided to flee to Delhi, the Mughal capital. His horse collapsed and died after six hours of galloping. Khan continued his journey on foot and reached Karnal. While waiting in front of a bakery to steal some food, he was recognized by the old clergyman Mullah Jamali of Kashgar, who had taught him Koran in Tirah. Mullah Jamali had left Pushtunistan, and had founded a madrasa (Muslim school) in Delhi. Khan spent around a year in Delhi under Mullah Jamali's shelter, after which he decided to join the Mughal army. The Mullah helped him financially by giving him a horse and five asharfis (gold coins).  Mughal military service  Mughal emperor Aurangzeb In 1703, Dost Mohammad Khan enlisted with Mir Fazlullah, Aurangzeb's Keeper of Arms. Around 1704, he was ordered to quell a rebellion by the governor Tardi Beg, who commanded a sizable force in the Bundelkhand region. Khan led the Mughal regiment of Gwalior in a battle with the Tardi Beg's forces headed by General Kashko Khan. Although injured by the swords of Kashko Khan's guards and a mahawat (elephant rider), Khan managed to kill Kashko Khan in the battle. He delivered Kashko's severed head to Mir Fazlullah in Delhi. In 1705, Mir Fazlullah presented Dost Mohammad Khan's regiment to the emperor Aurangzeb. According to the Khan's rozanmacha (daily diary), Aurangzeb was impressed by him, presented him with two fistful of gold coins, and asked Fazlullah to treat him well and give him an appropriate command. In return, Khan conveyed his loyalty to the Emperor. Following this, Khan rose rapidly through the ranks, and was assigned to the Malwa province in central India. Malwa was politically unstable at the time, and Aurangzeb had been replacing the governors in rapid succession. The Marathas, the Rajput chieftains and Muslim feudal chiefs were agitating for power in and around the region, and the Mughals were facing several revolts. News of the death of Emperor Aurangzeb on 20 February 1707 reached Khan, when he was at Bhilsa. A war of succession broke out between Aurangzeb's sons, two of whom approached Khan for allegiance. However, Khan refused to side with either of them, saying that he could not raise his sword against any of his sons since he had taken an oath of being loyal to the late Emperor.  Mercenary career  Following the death of the emperor Aurangzeb, Malwa started witnessing power struggles between the various chieftains in the area due to lack of a central authority. Dost Mohammad Khan became the leader of a band of around 50 Pathan mercenaries, and started providing the local chieftains protection against pillage and strife. These chieftains included the Raja Reshb Das (1695‚Äì1748) of Sitamau, Mohammad Farooq (Governor of Bhilsa), Diye Bahadur (the Mughal Deputy Governor of Malwa) and Raja Anand Singh Solanki of Mangalgarh. Mangalgarh was a small Rajput principality in Malwa, ruled by Raja Anand Singh Solanki. The dowager mother of the Raja had taken a great liking to Dost Mohammad Khan. After the Rajas's death at Delhi, she appointed him the kamdar or mukhtar (\\"guardian\\") of Mangalgarh, around 1708. Khan was tasked with protecting the dowager Rani (queen) and her estate. During his service at Mangalgarh, he married Kunwar Sardar Bai, the daughter of Anand Singh, who later converted to Islam and adopted the name Fatah Bibi (also spelled Fateh Bibi). Khan married several other women, but Fatah Bibi remained his favorite wife. Over the next few years, Khan operated out of Mangalgarh, working for anyone willing to pay for his reputed mercenary services.  Berasia estate  In 1709, Dost Mohammad Khan decided to build a feudal estate of his own. Berasia, a small mustajiri (rented estate) near Mangalgarh, was under the authority of the Delhi-based Mughal fief-holder Taj Mohammad Khan. It suffered from anarchy and lawlessness due to regular attacks from highwaymen and plunderers. On advice of Mohammed Sala, Sunder Rai and Alam Chand Kanoongo, Dost Mohammad Khan took on the lease of Berasia. The lease involved an annual payment of 30,000 rupees, which he was able to pay with help of his wife Fatah Bibi, who belonged to the Mangalgarh royal family. Khan appointed Maulvi Mohammad Saleh as the qazi (judge), built a mosque and a fort, and installed his loyal Afghan lieutenants in various administrative capacities. Dost Mohammad Khan also tried to gain some territories in Gujarat, but was unsuccessful. After being defeated by a Maratha warlord during an unsuccessful raid in Gujarat, he was imprisoned by his own rebel soldiers. He was freed after his wife Fatah Bibi paid a ransom to his captors. The rampant power struggles and disloyalty, especially his imprisonment by his own men after the Gujarat raid, had made Khan distrustful of people around him. He, therefore, invited his kinsmen in Tirah to Malwa. Khan's father, Mehraj Bibi (his wife ‚Äì the girl he was engaged to in Tirah) and his five brothers arrived in Berasia in 1712, with around 50 tribesmen of the Mirazikhel. His father died in 1715, shortly after arriving in Berasia. His five brothers were Sher, Alif, Shah, Mir Ahmad and Aqil; all except Aqil died in subsequent battles. The Pashtuns who had accompanied Khan's immediate family, later came to be known as \\"Barru-kat Pathans\\", and their families became highly influential in Bhopal. They were known as the Barru-kat (\\"reed cutter\\") Pathans since they initially made their homes with thatched reeds.  Struggles with the local chieftains  The Rajput neighbors of Mangalgarh, led by the Thakur (chief) of Parason, formed an alliance to counter the growing power of the Rani of Mangalgarh. The ensuing battle between Mangalgarh and the Thakur went on for days. During the festival of Holi, the Thakur insisted on a truce for celebrations. Dost Mohammad Khan agreed to the ceasefire, but also sent a spy dressed as a beggar to the Thakur's camp. The spy came back with the news that the Rajputs were in a state of drunken revelry. Khan violated the truce and raided the enemy camp at night, defeating the Rajput chieftains decisively. Dost also conquered the other adjoining Rajput territories such as Khichiwara and Umatwara. In 1715, Khan ran into conflict with another neighboring Rajput chief, Narsingh Rao Chauhan (also known as Narsingh Deora), who owned the fortified village of Jagdishpur near Berasia. Narsingh Deora demanded tribute from the Patel of Barkhera in Dillod, who had earlier given shelter to Dost after he fled away from the Mughal camp. Khan agreed to negotiate a treaty with Narsingh, and the two parties met at Jagdishpur, with 16 men on each side. Khan pitched a tent on the banks of Thal river (also known as Banganga) for the meeting. After a lunch arranged by him for both the parties, he stepped outside on the pretext of ordering ittar (perfume) and paan (betel leaf), which was actually a signal for Khan's hiding men to kill the Rajputs. It is said that the Thal river appeared red with the blood of the victims, and therefore was renamed to \\"Halali\\" river (the river of slaughter). After this incident, Khan renamed Jagdishpur to Islamnagar, strengthened the fort and made the place his headquarters. Khan's cousin Diler Mohammad Khan (or Dalel Khan) had also acquired some territory, establishing the Kurwai State. In 1722, he visited Berasia with a proposal that the two cousins join hands in extending their territory, and their acquisitions of land and property be equally divided. However, Dost Mohammad Khan got his cousin murdered. Dost Mohammad Khan also fought against Diye Bahadur, a Rajput general and Mughal subedar (governor). Diye Bahadur's forces initially defeated Khan's army, which fled from the battlefield. A badly wounded Khan, who had lost one of his brothers in the battle, was taken prisoner. He was well-treated by the Rajputs, and was presented before Diye Bahadur after recuperating from his wounds. Diye Bahadur offered Khan a position in his own forces, but Khan declined, while expressing gratitude for Bahadur's kindness. When asked what he would do if set free, Khan replied that he will wage another battle against Diye Bahadur. Bahadur, impressed by the Khan's bravery, released him. A few months later, Khan defeated Diye Bahadur with his newly raised force.  Allegiance to the Sayyid Brothers  The Sayyid Brothers were two nobles, who had become highly influential in the Mughal Court after the emperor Aurangzeb's death. Aurangzeb's son Bahadur Shah I defeated his brothers to capture the throne with the help of Sayyid Brothers and Nizam-ul-Mulk, another influential administrator in the Mughal court. Bahadur Shah I died in 1712 and his successor Jahandar Shah was assassinated on the orders of the Sayyid Brothers. In 1713, Jahandar's nephew Farrukhsiyar was installed as a puppet king by the Brothers, who conspired to send Nizam-ul-Mulk to the Deccan, away from the Mughal Court. Disillusioned with the Mughal court, Nizam-ul-Mulk also intended set up his own independent state, and left for the South as the Governor of Malwa and Deccan. When the Mughals sent a force from Delhi to curb the rebellion by the Rajput chiefs of Malwa, Dost Mohammad Khan sided with the Rajputs. In the resulting battle, his men fled from the battlefield, leaving him badly wounded and unconscious. In his diary, Khan wrote that he regained consciousness only when jackals began nibbling his limbs. Khan offered the little water remaining in his mushuk (water carrier) to an injured and thirsty Mughal soldier, who was moaning to ward off the jackals. This man was Sayyid Hussain Ali Khan Barha, the younger of the Sayyid Brothers. When the Mughal soldiers arrived to rescue Sayyid Hussain Ali, Dost Mohammad Khan was also rescued as a reward for his kindness in offering water to the injured Mughal nobleman. Khan subsequently recuperated under the care of Sayyaid Hussain Ali, who offered to make him the Governor of Allahabad. Khan declared his loyalty to the Sayyid Brothers, but refused the offer, because he did not want to leave Malwa. He was sent back to Mangalgarh with gifts of gold coins, a sword and a band of horses. Khan's closeness to the Sayyid Brothers later earned him the ire of Nizam-ul-Mulk, who sided with the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah to get the Sayyid Brothers killed during 1722‚Äì24.  Expansion of fiefdom  Shortly after Dost Mohammad Khan's return to Mangalgarh, the dowager Rani (queen) of the principality died heirless. Following the Rani's death, Khan usurped the Mangalgarh territory. Supported by his loyal \\"Barru-kat\\" Pathan associates, Khan set to carve out a fiefdom of his own. He waged battles to annex several territories, losing two of his brothers in the fights. Several local chieftains (jagirdars and zamindars) accepted his suzerainty without putting up a fight. While Khan was away from Mangalgarh, Mohammad Farooq Hakim, the Governor of Bhilsa, imprisoned his men and confiscated his personal property. When Khan returned and confronted him, he said that he believed that Khan had died in the battle with the Mughals. He released the imprisoned men, but returned only half of the Khan's belongings. The resulting hostility eventually led to a battle near Bhilsa. Farooq's army included 40,000 Maratha and Rajput soldiers, while Khan commanded just 5000 Afghans, supported by some Rajput soldiers. In a one-sided battle, Khan lost his brother Sher Mohammed Khan, and his men fled from the battlefield. Dost Mohammad Khan, with some of his most loyal men, had to hide in a thicket near the battlefield. As he lay hidden, he saw Farooq riding an elephant in the victory procession. He dressed himself in the uniform of one of Farooq's slain soldiers, hiding his face with a scarf and a helmet. Amid the din of the victory drums, he mounted the howdah (seat) on the elephant, killed Farooq and his guard, and claimed victory. Khan also seized control of several territories in Ashta, Debipura, Doraha, Gulgaon, Gyaraspur, Ichhawar, Sehore and Shujalpur.  Rani Kamlapati  Ruins of Ginnorgarh, the Ginnor fort In the 1710s, the area around the upper lake of Bhopal was mainly populated by the Bhil and the Gond tribals. Nizam Shah, the strongest of the local Gond warlords, ruled his territory from the Ginnor fort (Ginnorgarh in the present-day Sehore district). Ginnor was considered an impregnable fort, located at the summit of a steep 2000-foot-high rock, and surrounded by thick forest. Rani Kamlapati (or Kamlavati), the daughter of Chaudhari Kirpa-Ramchandra, was one of the seven wives of Nizam Shah. She was famous for her beauty and talents: the local legends describe her as more beautiful than a pari (fairy). Kamlapati Mahal in Bhopal Nizam Shah was poisoned to death by his nephew Alam Shah (also known as Chain Shah), the raja of Chainpur-Bari, who wanted to marry Kamlapati. Kamlapati offered Dost Mohammad Khan a hundred thousand rupees to protect her honor and her kingdom and to avenge her husband's death. Khan accepted the offer, and Kamlapati tied a rakhi on his wrist (traditionally tied by a sister on her brother's hand). Khan led a joint army of Afghan and Gond soldiers to defeat and kill Alam Shah. The slain king's territory was annexed to Kamlapati's kingdom. The Rani did not have one hundred thousand rupees, so she paid him half the sum and gave the village of Bhopal in lieu of the remainder. Khan was also appointed the manager of Kamlapati's state, and virtually became a ruler of the small Gond kingdom. Khan remained loyal to the Rani and her son Nawal Shah till her death. Historians have debated the reason for Khan's loyalty: some say he was enchanted with Kamlapati's charm and beauty; others think that he believed in keeping his word to women (he had been loyal to the Rani of Mangalgarh till her death as well). In Annals and antiquities of Rajasthan, James Tod mentions a folk story that describes how the \\"Queen of Ganore\\" killed Khan with a poison dress, when he asked her to marry him. In 1723, Rani Kamlapati committed suicide near her palace (present-day Kamla Park in Bhopal). Dost initially feigned allegiance to the Rani's son Nawal Shah, who controlled the Ginnor fort, and was invited to live in the fort. Khan disguised 100 of his soldiers as women and sent them to Ginnor in dolis that were supposed to contain his wife and family. The unsuspecting guards of Nawal Shah let the dolis inside the fort without examination. At night, Khan's soldiers killed Nawal Shah and his guards. Khan then took the control of Ginnor fort and other territories of Kamlapati's kingdom.  Development of Bhopal  Before Dost Mohammad Khan's arrival, Bhopal was a village in the Gond kingdom Dost Mohammad Khan ruled his state from his capital at Islamnagar. At the time of Kamlapati's death, Bhopal was a village of about 1000 people, to the south of Islamnagar. One day, during a shikar (hunting) trip, Dost Mohammad Khan and his wife Fatah Bibi decided to rest in the Bhopal village. Dost fell asleep, and dreamt that an old saint had asked him to build a fort. He told his wife about the dream, who asked him to construct a fort at the spot. This resulted in construction of Fatehgarh fort, named after Fatah Bibi. The foundation of the fort was laid on 30 August 1723. The first stone was laid by Qazi Mohammad Moazzam of Raisen, who later became the qazi (Islamic judge) of Bhopal. The fort was eventually expanded to encircle the village of Bhopal. It never fell to an enemy, and as late as 1880, the city was mainly confined to this fort. The first mosque of Bhopal, the Dhai Seedi Ki Masjid, was also built during this time, so that the fort guards could perform namaaz (prayers). A handwritten copy of the Quran with a Persian language translation was also kept at the fort ‚Äì the book had pages of size 5x2.5 feet (this copy was later given to the Al-Azhar University by Khan's descendant Nawab Hamidullah). Dost Mohammad Khan and his family gradually started using Bhopal as their main bastion, though Islamnagar still remained the official capital of his state. During 1720‚Äì1726, Dost started surrounding the city with a protective wall. Thus, Bhopal was transformed from a village to a fortified town with six gates: # Ginnori (the gate leading to Ginnorgarh) # Budhwara (Wednesday gate) # Itwara (Sunday gate) # Jumerati (Thursday gate) # Peer (Monday gate) # Imami (used for Tazia possession on the day of Muharram) Bijay Ram (or Bijjeh Ram), the Rajput chieftain of Shujalpur, was made the dewan (chief minister) of the Dost's state. Being a Hindu, he helped Dost win over the local population.  Conflict with the Asaf Jah I  Nizam-ul-Mulk attacked Bhopal as a punishment for Dost Mohammad Khan's support to the Sayyid Brothers Dost Mohammad Khan's son Yar Mohammad received from Nizam-ul-Mulk the insignia of the Maha Muratib (the dignity of the Fish). The insignia became part of the Bhopal State's coat of arms. By the early 1720s, Dost Mohammad Khan had transferred himself from a mercenary to the ruler of a small state. After the death of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, the Malwa territory was claimed by the Marathas and some kings of Rajputana, in addition to the Mughals. All these powers made such claims mainly through proxies (such as the local chieftains), although they did engage in occasional punitive raids when the local chiefs refused to pay the tribute demanded by them. Dost Mohammad Khan acknowledged Mughal authority by sending expensive gifts (such as an elephant) and flattering letters to the Mughal Emperor, who was controlled by the Sayyid Brothers. Emperor Farrukhsiyar conferred on him the title Nawab Diler Jung, probably on the recommendation of the Sayyid Brothers. Dost also prevented the Maratha invasions by regularly paying them chauth (tribute). In 1719, the Sayyid Brothers murdered Emperor Farrukhsiyar, who had been plotting against them. Subsequently, they placed Rafi Ul-Darjat and Rafi ud-Daulah as the emperors, both of whom died of sickness in 1719. Muhammad Shah then ascended the Mughal throne with the help of the Sayyid Brothers, who acted as his regents till 1722. The hostility between Sayyid Brothers and the rival nobleman Nizam-ul- Mulk had been growing in the recent years. Dost Mohammad Khan was well-aware of the power of Nizam-ul-Mulk, who was the Subahdar (Governor) of Malwa; he had seen his strong force passing through Bhopal on its way to the Deccan in the south. However, he allied himself with the Mughal Court controlled by the Sayyid Brothers, with whom he had developed a close friendship. In 1720, the Sayyid Brothers dispatched a Mughal force led by Dilawar Ali Khan against Nizam in Malwa. When Dost Mohammad Khan was asked to support this force, he sent a contingent commanded by his brother Mir Ahmad Khan to fight on the Mughal side. The Mughal force ambushed the Nizam at Burhanpur near Khandwa on 19 June 1720, but was decisively defeated by the Nizam, who was supported by the Marathas. Dilawar Khan, Mir Ahmad and other generals sent by the Sayyid Brothers were killed in the battle, and Dost Mohammad Khan's forces retreated to Malwa, pursued and plundered by the Nizam's Maratha auxiliaries. Thus, Dost earned the wrath of both the Nizam and the Maratha Peshwa for opposing them. Subsequently, Nizam-ul-Mulk helped the emperor Muhammad Shah in getting the Sayyid Brothers killed. After having established control over the Deccan, he decided to get even with Dost Mohammad Khan for supporting the Sayyid Brothers. On 23 March 1723, he despatched a force to Bhopal, where Khan put up some fight from his fort. After a brief siege, Khan agreed to a truce the next day. He arranged an expensive welcome banquet for the Nizam, presented him with an elephant and stationed his forces on a hillock renamed to Nizam tekri (Nizam's hillock) in the Nizam's honor. He agreed to cede part of his territory, including the Islamnagar fort. He also paid a tribute of ten lakh (one million) rupees with a promise to pay a second installment later. He was also forced to send his 14-year-old son and heir Yar Mohammad Khan to Nizam's capital Hyderabad, as a hostage. The Nizam assumed control over Bhopal, and appointed Dost Mohammad Khan as a kiledar (fort commander). In return for a fort, the payment of Rs. 50,000 and the pledge of 2000 troops, the Nizam granted a sanad (decree) to Khan recognizing the latter's right to collect the revenues from the territory.  Death and legacy  In his final years, which saw his humiliation at the hands of the Nizam, Khan's aggression had mellowed down considerably. He sought inspiration from Sufi mystics and saints, and veered towards spiritualism. He admonished his brother Aqil for desecrating a Buddhist statue in Sanchi. He encouraged several scholars, hakeems (doctors) and artists to settle in Bhopal. Several Pashtuns, including those of Yusufzai, Rohilla and Feroze clans, settled in Bhopal during his reign due to relatively peaceful environment of the area. Mausoleum of Dost Khan and Fateh Bibi (2).jpg  Mausoleum of Dost Khan and Fateh Bibi Information Mausoleum of Dost Khan Bhopal.jpg  Mausoleum of Dost Khan at Bhopal Mausoleum of Dost Khan and Fateh Bibi (4).jpg  Mausoleum of Dost Khan Dost Mohammad Khan died of an illness in March 1728. It is said that he had 30 wounds on his body from the various fights and battles he had participated in. He was buried in the Fatehgarh Fort beside his wife Fatah Bibi. Dost Mohammad Khan was survived by 5 daughters and 6 sons (Yar, Sultan, Sadar, Fazil, Wasil and Khan Bahadur). He married several times, but only few of his wives have been chronicled. Four of his children were from his first wife Mehraj Bibi. Kunwar Sardar Bai (later Fatah Bibi), his favorite wife of Rajput descent, was childless, but had an adopted son called Ibrahmin Khan. Khan had three children from Jai Kunwar (later Taj Bibi), who had been presented to him by the zamindar (landowning chieftain) of Kaliakheri. The court of Bhopal appointed Khan's younger son, Sultan Mohammad, as his successor. Sultan Mohammad Khan was 7 or 8-year-old at the time. The Nizam overruled the appointment, and sent the Dost's hostage teenage son Yar Mohammad Khan to Bhopal with a thousand horsemen. Yar Mohammad Khan was the eldest son of Dost, but he was not his first wife Mehraj Bibi's son; he could have been born of a consort soon after Dost came to Malwa. The court of Bhopal refused to grant him the title of Nawab on the grounds that he was an illegitimate son. Yar Mohammad was, however, allowed to execute the royal functions as the regent. The Bhopal State later became a protectorate of the British India, and was ruled by the descendants of Dost Mohammad Khan until 1949, when it was merged into independent India.

His use of repetition of line and mastery of color to manipulate the way light plays on the surface give depth to his pictorial compositions.  Biography  Sempere was born in Onil, Alicante, Spain. He began his studies at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Carlos de Valencia (Saint Charles Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Valencia) where he studied painting, drawing and various etching techniques. Due to a childhood disease he had almost no vision in his right eye. In 1948 Sempere went to study in Paris, where he met Palazuelo and Chillida and other avant-garde artists such as Kandinsky and Klee. Here he came under the influence of Braque, and improved the screen printing technique he used frequently in later years. In 1955, his work was noticed by art critics at the Denise Rene Gallery and in 1956 he showed two works at the Salon des R√©alit√©s Nouvelles in Paris. In this period he was greatly impressed by Vasarely‚Äôs theories of kinetic art. In Paris he also met Hans Arp and was friends with Nina Kandinsky, the painter's widow, and Roberta Gonz√°lez, the daughter of sculptor Julio Gonz√°lez. In 1957 he made the acquaintance of Martin Abel who worked with him years later to produce limited editions of his serigraphs. Returning to Spain in 1959, he moved to Valencia, where art critic Aguilera Cern√≠, editor of Arte vivo (The Living Art) magazine, introduced Sempere to the Group Parpall√≥, a cultural movement not limited to the visual arts. Formed in 1957, it included artists such as Castellano, Genov√©s, Navarro, Soria, Michavila, Andres Alfaro, Manolo Gil, Amadeo Gabino, Isidoro Balaguer, and others striving to renew the cultural landscape in Valencia. The group published a magazine, called at first Arte vivo and later Parpall√≥, and began group exhibitions. In 1964, Sempere was granted a Ford Foundation fellowship which allowed him to travel to the United States and put on an exhibition at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery, and to show his work in the Spanish Pavilion at the World‚Äôs Fair in New York. In 1968 Sempere participated in a seminar at the Computer Centre of the Complutense University of Madrid on \\"Automatic generation of plastic forms\\" where he created works using computers. In 1969, he traveled again to the United States on a fellowship and there used a computer to create original art, a technique that he would continue to experiment with on his return to the University of Madrid, where he became a pioneer of this innovation in Spain. Still exhibiting regularly at the Denise Rene Gallery in Paris, he participated in some notable public projects; the best-known examples are the sculptures and carved railings at the Museo Esculturas al Aire Libre (Museum of Outdoor Sculpture) in Madrid. Sempere persuaded his artist friends, including Pablo Serrano, Mir√≥, and Chillida, to donate their work, much of which is spectacular, especially his own cascade that forms a centerpiece of the assembly. Sempere‚Äôs work in the gardens of the Fundaci√≥n Juan March (Juan March Foundation) also in Madrid, next to the concrete sculpture by Chillida, is highly regarded as well. In 1980 he won the Gold Medal for Merit in Fine Arts, awarded by the Ministry of Culture in Madrid, and in 1983 he was awarded the Prince of Asturias Prize for the Arts. He was officially named a favorite son of the city of Alicante and awarded an honorary doctorate by the University. He died in April 1985 in Onil, Alicante, after a long illness. Work Sempere's work is defined by the abstraction of its elements, geometric repetition and linearity, all of which evolved into his synthesis of Op Art and constructivism with elements of kinetic art. M√≥vil. 1972, Museo de Escultura al Aire Libre de Madrid. His personal contribution to the development of kinetic art is a series of abstract geometric constructions that demonstrate the perceptual effects of optical vibration and the illusion of motion. Light also plays an important role in his artistic work. Perhaps influenced by Levantine sources, Sempere uses it as the main element to organize his creations harmoniously. His paintings are considered as two- dimensional surfaces where the artist plays with visual elements‚Äîthe light, the colors and tones‚Äîusing perceptual and optical effects to create suggestive forms in repeating geometric shapes. Sempere worked in many different media, from drawings, gouaches, oil paintings, and silk screen prints to sculptures of iron and stainless steel. Two of his works can be seen in the Museum of Outdoor Sculpture in Madrid, for which he created the rails, now painted blue, which suggest a curious moir√© effect when walking beside them, and a mobile which he had loaned to the museum. The Alicante Museum of Contemporary Art (Museo Alicantino de Arte Contemoraneo) contains the collection of 20th- century art donated by Sempere to the city in 1978. It is located in Alicante's oldest civil building, the Casa de la Asegurada, which dates to 1685. The nucleus of the collection contains works by major Spanish artists of the 1950s: Alfaro, Canogar, Chillida, Joan Castej√≥n, Momp√≥, Saura, T√†pies, Zobel and Viola. Overall, it includes these and more than 500 pieces comprising paintings, sculptures, mixed media and lithographs by other Spanish and foreign artists such as Dal√≠, Picasso, Millares, Serrano, Mir√≥, Gris, Kandinsky, Chagall and Vasarely, and covering all stages of Sempere's own career. Sempere's outdoor sculpture of metal rods at the Juan March Foundation in Madrid inspired two Spanish physicists to develop a new method for cancelling noise. Discussing the mechanics of sound attenuation over beers, they realized that the sculpture might reveal an optimum arrangement of materials that dampens noise not by absorbing it, but by interfering with the transmission of sound waves.

The mountain has been a pilgrimage site since the late Middle Ages, and on its summit are a church containing a 12th-century crucifix, a Franciscan friary, a chapel dedicated to Saint Boniface, and a large free-standing cross. The medieval name for the mountain was Stuffenberg, from which the supposed Germanic god Stuffo derives his name.Wolf; qtd. in L√∂ffler 7. According to some sources the name was changed in the 14th century (or around 1400) because of a famous crucifix in the church, the H√ºlfenskreuz;Weigel et al 14. another etymology for the modern name was given in 1575, based on the legend that Boniface had defeated an army of unbelievers on the mountain, which was subsequently named H√ºlfensberg (helfen: to help) in reference to divine help.Gropper 293; transl. in L√∂fler 4‚Äì5. Pilgrimage The H√ºlfensberg has been a pilgrimage site since the late Middle Ages, and at one point was one of the seven most popular such sites in Germany; the goal of these pilgrimages was a 12th-century crucifix.Ullrich 129. Today pilgrimages occur throughout the year. During the East-West division of Germany, the H√ºlfensberg was less than a kilometer from the border, on the eastern side, meaning that opportunities for pilgrimage were restricted to a small number of people. According to Father Heribert (one of the Franciscan friars, 2010), attendance dropped by two-thirds in 1953, the year after the H√ºlfensberg was placed inside the expanded and protected border area. Permission for visits to the mountain was usually only granted to locals; all others interested in pilgrimage had to request permission, and half were denied. As of 2010, some 250 pilgrims attend Sunday mass in the church, and 1000 to 2000 people participate in each of the four major pilgrimages per year. H√ºlfenskreuz The H√ºlfenskreuz The focal point of pilgrimage on the H√ºlfensberg is the H√ºlfenskreuz, a 12th-century Romanesque crucifix. It is one of the most popular pieces of sacral art in the Erfurt dioceseKeppler 9. as well as one of the most important.Sucher and Wulitzer 67. The wooden sculpture is of Christ as a king looking straight ahead (in a \\"strong frontality\\"), wearing a crown. A renovation in 1850 reconnected the legs with the cross.Handbuch 627. While the 12th-century origin of the cross is oft-repeated, Georg Dehio's Handbuch der deutschen kunstdenkm√§ler states that it may well be a later imitation. The crucifix is placed on a red background covered with gold stars. The frame bears a motto in Latin, Salve Crux Pretiosa (Hail, precious cross). According to the local Franciscans, occasionally miracles happen on the site. St. Salvator church St. Salvator pilgrimage church On top of the H√ºlfensberg is the St. Salvator church, which was built circa 1360‚Äì1367 as a sanctuary, on the remains of an older church (on the south side of the current church, next to the sacristy), dated circa 1000. The oldest document pertaining to the H√ºlfensberg is a papal deed from 1351, which names the parish St. Salvator auf dem Stuffenberg. A later deed naming the location is dated 30 May 1352; at this time the H√ºlfensberg belonged to the St. Martin monastery in Heilbad Heiligenstadt, which in turn handed over the patronage to the Cistercian monastery of Anrode in 1357. Pilgrimages to the H√ºlfenskreuz, found at the church's Gnadenaltar, started from Anrode. In 1583 the area and its church were transferred to the Archbishopric of Mainz, and remained Catholic during the Protestant Reformation. In the course of time, the St. Salvator church was expanded and renovated a number of times, most notably during the Baroque era. In 1810, the Anrode monastery was dissolved by J√©r√¥me Bonaparte and sold, with all its possessions, to Franz Just Wedemeyer, of the Wedemeyer family, making the H√ºlfensberg private property. Eleven years later, Wedemeyer gave the top of the mountain, with its church, to the bishop. In 1890, the church was again expanded, in a neo-Gothic style, by Franciscan architect Paschalis Gratze. The original Boniface chapel, adjacent to the church, was torn down and rebuilt on a different location; the foundation of the old chapel was the base for the new apse, with altar and choir. In 1984, while the church was located in East- Germany, the roof on a church tower was renovated with materials paid for in West-German money through Genex, the East-German commercial exchange. Boniface chapel Boniface chapel Next to the church is a chapel dedicated to Saint Boniface, built in 1903 on the foundations of an earlier chapel. According to local legend, this is where Boniface cut down a Donar Oak, a sacred, pagan tree, in the early 8th century. This legend is based on the proximity of the village Geismar, a place mentioned in the Boniface vitaeWillibald; trans. in Talbot 45‚Äì46‚Äîbut, scholars agree now, this is in reference to another Geismar, now a part of Fritzlar in northern Hesse.Lutz 41‚Äì42. Another legend says that Boniface stood on the top of the H√ºlfensberg and said, Wann wird endlich Frieden schweben √ºber dieser sch√∂nen Aue (\\"when will peace at last hover over this lovely forest?\\"). Folk etymology derived from his supposed words the local place names Wanfried, Frieda (in Meinhard), Schwebda (likewise in Meinhard), and Aue (in Wanfried). Franciscan monastery Franciscans founded a monastery (the oldest in the Eichsfeld area), also named H√ºlfensberg, on top of the mountain; on 16 April 1860, two priests and two lay brothers dedicated the monastery‚Äîoriginally, these were to found a new sanctuary at Kl√ºschen Hagis, with the H√ºlfensberg being nothing but a provisional church. During the Kulturkampf, the monastery was forced to close for twelve years. When in May 1952 the East-German government strengthened the nearby border and its Sperrzone (which placed the H√ºlfensberg inside the protected zone), the monastery and the church suffered a steep drop in attendance. As of 2011, four Franciscans live in the monastery, which belongs to the German Franciscan province of St. Elisabeth, whose seat is in Munich. Dr. Konrad Martin Kreuz Dr. Konrad Martin Kreuz Konrad Martin, Bishop of Paderborn from 1856 to 1875, was born in nearby Geismar. In his honor, a steel cross was erected on top of the H√ºlfensberg and dedicated on 7 August 1933. The cross is tall. It was taken down in 1990, restored and put back up in May 1991. In March 1990, after the Unification of Germany, a plaque was dedicated at the foot of the cross to remember the \\"victims of the fascist and stalinist dictatorship\\".

In 2011 he trained Ian Thorpe in Switzerland.In his swimming career comeback, Ian Thorpe faces critical stage. heraldsun.com.au (29 October 2011). Biography Touretski was born in Leningrad (now Saint-Petersburg), USSR, where he studied in more than one university, obtaining diploma in biomechanics, biochemistry, fluid mechanics and sports physiology. He was trained by the famous Russian swimming coach Alexei Krasikov and competed for 15 years, winning the national championships in the 400 m and 1500 m freestyle in 1968. He barely missed two Olympic Games by finishing third in the trials for the 1968 and fourth for the 1972 Olympics. He was also third in the 1500 m freestyle at the national championships of 1969 and 1970. In 1973 Touretski retired from competitions to become a swimming coach. According to Krasikov, Touretski was not a dedicated swimmer, but turned into a clever and successful coach, bringing several swimmers, such as Gennadiy Prigoda, to Olympic medals. He was the coach of the Soviet Olympic team in 1988 and 1992. Around 1990 Touretski started working with Alexander Popov, and when in late 1992 Touretski moved from Russia to Australia, Popov followed him there.Popov, p. 89. In Australia, besides Popov Touretski coached such stars as Michael Klim, Matthew Dunn, Ray Hass and Clementine Stoney, bringing them to Olympic and world cup medals. Touretski lived in Canberra with a wife and daughter and in 1996 became an Australian citizen. In 2001, thieves stole a small safe from his house and when the Australian police recovered it, they found tablets of the banned steroid stanozolol next to the safe in a pond. Touretski was charged with possession of an illegal drug and suspended from coaching starting from 10 April 2001. The charges were later dropped and he was reinstated at the AIS on 14 September 2001,Gennadi Touretski Reinstated to Full Duty at AIS. Australian Sports Commission (14 September 2001). however, he lost most of his trainees except for Popov. Also, hundreds of drug tests have been imposed on Australian swimmers in 2001.Mass Drug Test After Swim Coach Charged. swimnews.com (11 April 2001) On 6 June 2002, Touretski became involved in a drunken brawl on a plane flying from Singapore to Sydney, and consequently fired by the AIS in July 2002. A similar incident occurred in 1995 when he was jailed for a month in Hawaii, where the plane had to make an emergency landing. In January 2003 he moved to Switzerland and in July 2007 became the head coach of the Swiss swimming team. There, beside Swiss swimmers, he trains a few Ukrainian and Russian athletes, as well as his daughter Alexandra Touretski, and Ian Thorpe who joined him in March 2011. Touretski was known for his knowledge of biomechanics and for individual approach to every athlete, which often appears unorthodox. For example, he persuaded Klim to focus more on butterfly, as well as to change his crawling technique to the straight-arm \\"windmill style\\"; both decisions proved highly successful. His coaching focuses on technique and multiple repetition, with an important addition \\"If you can't do it exactly right, don't do it at all\\". Thus, he does not demand mileage, though his trainees do swim a lot anyway.Popov, p. 126. In 2011, Touretski was decorated by the Russian Order of Friendship.

His sporting exploits were widely followed and on occasion considered worth reporting in The Times. Early life Born in London to Colonel Peter Ryves Hawker and Mary Wilson Hawker (n√©e Yonge), Peter Hawker was educated at Eton and entered military service in 1801 by purchasing a commission as a cornet in The Royal Dragoons (1st Dragoons), soon gaining purchased promotion to captain. Hawker notes in his diary that: \\"I was a Captain of Dragoons soon after I was seventeen years old, but paid dearer for it than anyone in the service.\\" Military career Hawker served with the 14th Light Dragoons under the Duke of Wellington during the Peninsular War. He led his squadron in the Battle of Douro (6 May 1809), his regiment thereby earning the battle honour \\"Douro\\" for its colours. He received a serious thigh wound in the following Battle of Talavera (28 July 1809), was declared unfit, and so resigned and sold his commission. In recognition of his service, Hawker was awarded a modest annual pension of ¬£100. Despite his injuries and consequent ill health, he was later able in 1815 to accept an active commission as major of the North Hampshire Militia; he was recommended for the post by the then Duke of Clarence, heir to the throne and future King William IV. Hawker was made a lieutenant-colonel of the militia in 1821 and ultimately became deputy lieutenant for his county. Sportsman and author Hawker is best known today for his published works on the sporting activities of shooting, wildfowling and fishing. Hawker published his \\"Advice to Young Sportsmen\\" in 1814, a popular work with nine impressions in his lifetime, the latest paper edition appearing in 1975. Forty years after Hawker's death, an Australian book reviewer stated, \\"Probably no book on the subject of sport ever enjoyed so wide or so long sustained a popularity as the Instructions to Young Sportsmen\\". Hawker kept a regular diary which contains observations of Europe before and after the Napoleonic period and of wild-fowling, game-bird shooting and detailed hunting techniques and conditions prevalent in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. His diary, printed in an abridged form in two volumes, became a popular work. The most recent paper edition appeared in 1988. Hawker also published an originally anonymous memoir of the Peninsula War. Revisionist views Hawker's attitudes to guns and shooting have been criticised and parodied from a modern viewpoint in The Economist (in connection with teaching children how to shoot), and in The Times (as being overly bloodthirsty). He was even mildly criticised by Sir Ralph Payne- Gallwey, who described Hawker as \\"something of an egotist\\" albeit a \\"good- natured\\" one) in the introduction to the 1893 edition of the diary. Colin Laurie McKelvie, in a forward to the 1988 edition of the diary, found Hawker's personality \\"unattractive\\" and observed that he \\"appears unacceptably self- absorbed, cock-sure and downright arrogant.\\" McKelvie mitigates this criticism with praise for Hawker's knowledge, fairness, energy and enthusiasm. The musician Hawker was a keen amateur musician, studying the piano under Henri Bertini and regularly playing the organ at his local church. This interest in music was not limited to playing. He devised and patented a device to assist in piano teaching: his \\"hand moulds\\". Development of firearms Joe Manton 1 September 1827. Hawker's inventiveness extended to the development of \\"detonating\\" firearms ‚Äì the percussion lock) and punt gunning. He also claims in his diary to have invented a \\"smokeless chimney\\". Hawker was a firm friend of the noted gunsmith Joe Manton, using Manton's guns, taking an interest in their design, and participating in the manufacture of some of his own commissions. Hawker designed a breech-loading swivel gun mounted on a four- wheeled carriage, a model of which was reportedly on display at the Rotunda, Woolwich. In later life Hawker designed a \\"military musket\\" and commissioned the manufacture of several prototypes at his own expense. Hawker's musket was favourably received by the Board of Ordnance, but it was not adopted, being set aside in preference to the Enfield Rifle-Musket, although elements of Hawker's design were incorporated into the final version of the Enfield. Family life Hawker was married first in 1811 to Julia, only daughter of Major Hooker Barttelot, making the family home in Longparish with a cottage in Keyhaven. After Julia's death in 1844, Hawker married Helen Susan Symonds (n√©e Chatterton), herself a widow. Colonel Hawker had two sons and two daughters by his first wife. Hawker's grand-daughter, Mary Elizabeth Hawker, was a noted late Victorian author under the pseudonym \\"Lanoe Falconer\\". Hawker's cottage in Keyhaven, Hampshire, still stands as \\"Hawker's Cottage\\", immediately north of the Gun Inn public house, which reportedly was named originally to mark Hawker's punt-gunning exploits. Hawker was Lanoe Hawker's great-grandfather through Lanoe's mother.Burke's Landed Gentry, 13th ed., edited by A.

Established in 1564, it has one of the most important collections of tombstones in Scotland, and is protected as a category A listed building. The majority of graves face exactly due east. History Coffer tombs, The Howff, Dundee The land of the burial ground was part of the Franciscan (Greyfriars) Monastery until the Scottish Reformation. In 1564 Mary, Queen of Scots granted the land to the burgh of Dundee, for use as a burial ground. It was used for meetings by the Dundee Incorporated Trades, and subsequently became known as The Howff, from the Scots word howff 'an enclosed open space, yard, area (as a timber yard)', likely related to German or Dutch hof 'enclosed space, courtyard'.Dictionary of the Scots Language, s.v. howf, n1, v.. Old parish records for burials within The Howff begin in the late 18th century. Prior to this records of mortcloth hire, a cloth rented out by the Guildry and Trades to cover bodies or coffins before burial, provide evidence of burials dating back to 1655. Meetings at The Howff ceased in 1776. The last burial took place in 1878 (George Duncan). The walls along the west side date from 1601. The vault to the extreme south west (now simply saying \\"Blackness\\" inside) was the burial Vault of the Wedderburns of Blackness House in Dundee. A sealed window on its exterior appear to indicate this was either a watch- house or part of the original meeting-house prior to the vault being built (c.1630). The graveyard is highly unusual by Scottish standards, containing a high number of Roman-style coffer tombs. It also contains a high number of inscriptions which philosophise on death itself rather than discussing the person interred. Of the 80,000 burials in the Howff around 3% are classed as \\"foreign\\" but with many simply bearing this label due to birth at sea, reflecting Dundee's maritime heritage.

This cemetery, which was influenced by Glasgow Necropolis, was more or less destroyed by later building works. Firstly the construction of Dundee's inner ring road in the 1960s cut through the site, and this was followed by the erection of a multi-storey car park over the New Hoff's southern end. Some grave stones were saved and positioned against its western wall which had originally been the boundary between the cemetery and the Dundee and Newtyle Railway.

He often painted in the style of 17th century Dutch painters. He kept up his painting career as well as a career in banking. Early life The New Bonnet, 1858, Metropolitan Museum of Art He was born on November 22, 1806 in Hudson, New York, one child in a large Quaker family. He was skilled in drawing but found that it was too expensive to get training in etching as he wished. Instead, he followed the path of an uncle into the business of banking. Career He was engaged during the greater part of his life as a cashier in a bank, starting in 1823 in the Tradesmen‚Äôs Bank of New York. The schools of the National Academy of Design opened in 1826, which stimulated him to improve his artistic skills. He registered as a ‚Äústudent of the antique‚Äù from 1827 to 1830, while continuing at the bank. He first exhibited his painting Sammy the Tailor, painted in 1836, at the National Academy of Design in New York City. He exhibited this painting under the pseudonym E. F. Williams, as he was unsure of its reception. ‚ÄúEdmonds was surprised by Sammy the Tailor's warm reception and encouraged by its success to continue to paint.\\" Commodore Trunnion and Jack Hatchway, scene from English novel by Tobias Smollet, \\"The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle‚Äù. c. 1839, Dallas Museum of Art This was followed, among other works, by Dominie Sampson in 1837, the Penny Paper in 1839, Sparking in 1840, Stealing Milk in 1843, Vesuvius and Florence in 1844, Bargaining in 1858, and The New Bonnet in 1859. In 1838 he was elected an associate of the National Academy of Design, and in 1840 an academician. Edmonds was also active in the American Art-Union. He devoted his mornings and evenings to painting, while maintaining his career in banking. His wife died in 1840 and he had a nervous breakdown so he went to Europe for rest for a year. Otherwise, he produced two to three paintings each year, in the manner of 17th century Dutch painting. His subjects were often literary and he had a touch of humor in his approach. After about 1854, his genre painting, which continued throughout this period of his life, shifted in later years toward rural themes, a likely reflection of his increasing remove from day-to-day affairs in New York City. Reception Edmonds paintings were well-received in his lifetime and are in museums across the US. He is recognized to be following the Scottish painter Wilkie. A book in 1867 ‚Äúcredited Edmonds with popularizing ‚Äúhumorous every-day-life-scenes‚Äù whose ‚Äúhomely‚Äù subjects and ‚Äúna√Øve literalness‚Äù appealed to ‚Äúaverage taste.‚Äù‚Äù The purchasers of his paintings did not consider their own taste to be average; rather they felt they bought truly American art. Edmonds ‚Äúart consistently garnered positive critical commentary throughout the 1840s and 1850s, the decades during which he frequently exhibited paintings‚Äù. His ‚Äúgenre paintings with contemporary settings and identifi¬≠ably American narratives were instantly legible to the majority of viewers‚Äù. Edmonds career in banking, contrary to his early fears, increased his appreciation by the Art community. ‚ÄúArtists' organizations prized Edmonds' involvement because of his business acumen and his extensive network of contacts with individuals capable of providing significant financial patronage.‚Äù Personal life He married Martha Norman in Hudson, New York in 1831, and had at least one daughter, Nora H. Edmonds. After about 1854, he devoted much of the remainder of his life to developing a bank-note engraving company, improving his country estate in Bronxville, New York, and raising his large family; he had remarried after returning from Europe. Death He died at his residence in Eastchester, New York on the Bronx River on February 7, 1863.

The Royal Navy captured her at the Battle of Lake Borgne on 14 December 1814. She was sold in 1815. US service (1805‚Äì14) Gunboat No. 5 was built in Baltimore by William Price as one of a number of gunboats that President Thomas Jefferson had built for the defense of the United States. Price built her to a design by Josiah Fox, \\"Head Ship Carpenter and Navy Constructor\\",Smith (1995), pp. 77‚Äì78. and launched her on 1 March 1805. She may have been a double-ender, initially armed with two 32-pounder guns (one fore and one aft). She had 2,600 pounds of copper in the sheathing for her hull and in her fittings, had a single mast amidships, and was rigged with a lateen sail. Sailing Master Alexander Harrison was named to command her.Tucker (1993), pp. 182‚Äì3. Gunboat No. 5 left Hampton Roads on 15 May and sailed to the Mediterranean, in company with Gunboat No. 10.Gunboat No. 5 is not the Gunboat No. 5 that Commodore Edward Preble borrowed from the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1804 for use against Tripoli. He returned that vessel, the three other gunboats, and two bomb ketches he had borrowed, later in 1804. In 1805 the navy sent eight gunboats to the Mediterranean. For the voyage across the Atlantic, the gunboats received a dandy rig, false keels, and lee boards. They stowed their guns below, but carried light guns, possibly swivel guns, in order to have some means of defense.Tucker (1993), pp. 77‚Äì9. No. 5 arrived at Gibraltar on 14 June. She then sailed to Syracuse, staying there 8‚Äì9 July. She was at Tunis in August, and then returned to winter-over at Syracuse. Although Gunboats No. 2 through 10 (minus No. 7) arrived in the Mediterranean too late to see action, they remained there with Commodore Rodgers's squadron until summer 1806. They then sailed back to the United States. No. 5 arrived back at Charleston on 21 July 1806. She then sailed to Gosport, Virginia, where she arrived on 30 July. There she was laid up. Gunboat No. 5 next took up station at Norfolk, Virginia. In July 1806 she joined gunboats Nos. 4, 6 and 10, and the brigs and on a cruise.Tucker (1993), p. 81. During the war-scare immediately after the Chesapeake‚ÄìLeopard affair, No. 5 was in the second division of Stephen Decatur's sixteen gunboats at Norfolk.Tucker (1993), p. 85. Lieutenant James Gibbon took command in August 1807. His replacement, in November, was Lieutenant John Davis. On 13 March 1808 she sailed for Baltimore to assist the Collector of Customs there in enforcing the Embargo Act of 1807 and the subsequent Non-Intercourse Act.Mosier (c.2009) The Daybook, Vol. 12, No. 4, pp. 6‚Äì9.

At some point during her service enforcing the embargo Gunboat No. 5 detained the sloop John Upshaw.Smith (1995), p. 108. It was probably before that interception that Gunboat No. 5 sank. She was under the command of Sailing Master B. G. Hipkins when on 18 June 1808 a squall sank her off Holland Island in the Chesapeake. She lost three men drowned ‚Äì the purser's steward and two marines ‚Äì before the schooner Victory, which saw the loss, could rescue the remaining crew. Though she sank in some six fathoms of water, she clearly was raised as she would continue to serve for at least seven more years. In February 1809 No. 5 Midshipman Thomas C. Magruder took command, and she was ordered to transfer to New Orleans from Baltimore as part of a move by the U.S. government to build up its forces there to enforce the embargo. The gunboats were not effective in enforcing the embargo, and in March 1809 the Non-Intercourse Act replaced the embargo and authorized trade with all nations, save Britain and France.Tucker (1993), pp. 89‚Äì90. She was at Havana in May 1809. Magruder was involved in improper conduct, which caused the Secretary of the Navy to order an investigation in June and the recovery of No. 5 on 25 July. The conduct involved keeping a woman on board. Lieutenant Alexander C. Harrison took command in August.Magruder resigned from the U.S. Navy on 22 January 1812. No. 5 remained at New Orleans, and in May 1812 her commander was Midshipman James Roney. At the time, her armament consisted of one 24-pounder gun and two 6-pounder guns. She was still among the 13 gunboats there in November 1812. By March 1813 there were only five effective gunboats, the others being too rotten to carry cannon or having been disarmed to provide guns for .Tucker (1993), p. 157. In February 1813, her commander was Lieutenant George Merrill. In April, gunboats No. 5, No. 22, No. 65, No. 156, No. 162 and No. 163 sailed for Mobile, Alabama, under the overall command of Captain John Shaw.

Following the 1983 Nigerian coup d'etat which truncated the Second Nigerian Republic, General Muhammadu Buhari became military head of state. He immediately launched an unprecedented military-led social engineering campaign, War Against Indiscipline, with the aim of forcibly promoting civic virtues. Buharism came to represent a national third force at the height of the Cold War era, favouring neither communism nor capitalism. His economic ideology was solely predicated on the practicalities needed for a Third World nation to develop: mainly economic self-sufficiency, disciplined citizenry, and national development. As the supreme leader and commander of the regime, Buhari significantly derived charismatic authority. The revisionist 1985 Nigerian coup d'√©tat was the antithesis of Buharism; his Chief of Army Staff and successor General Ibrahim Babangida opposed the heavy-handedness of Buhari's social campaign and the economic dirigisme policies. Babangida later went on to become the longest-serving post-Civil War military head of state; his regime saw a drastic re-alignment towards the rapidly emerging new international order with the introduction of the IMF-sanctioned programmes: privatisation, deregulation, and devaluation. Imprisoned and subsequently out of power for 30 years, Muhammadu Buhari contested the 2003, 2007, 2011, and later 2015 presidential elections, winning the last one and defeating the incumbent Goodluck Jonathan. Buharism gradually transformed into a cult of personality and initially enjoyed broad support throughout the country, especially in Northern Nigeria, until the 2019 Nigerian presidential election, which caused a significant decline in Buhari's popularity. Overview Buharism is anchored on the economic direction of a centre-left progressive ideology. Its economic reforms are characterised as moving the political economy away from the control of \\"parasitic\\" elites and into the control of a \\"productive class\\". To its students, Buharism represents a two-way struggle: with external globalism and with its internal agents and advocates. Its agenda for social order shows a demonstrable character of State Consequentialism. Consequentialists believe that the morality of an action is contingent on the action's outcome, therefore an action is right if it delivers a greater good for a greater number of people. An action is therefore right if it leads to state order, welfare of the people, and their material prosperity. Economic ideology Buharism rejects the dominant approach of the Washington Consensus, rather holding that for a crisis-wracked country to successfully improve its balance of payments through devaluation, there must first exist the condition that the price of every country's export is denominated in its own currency. In the case of Nigeria, it largely exported crude oil, which was sold on dollar terms, and exported no finished goods, which would be priced cheaper by devaluation and result in supposed economic recovery under the Washington Consensus model. As such a condition did not exist, Buharism asserted that, for any country where Washington Consensus conditions do not exist clearly enough, there are alternate approaches to solving the problem of its economic crisis. Therefore, instead of applying devaluation to get the then crisis- wracked economy of Nigeria back on track, Buharism instead employed a policy of curbing imports of goods deemed unnecessary, curtailing oil theft, and improving exports through a counter trade policy of bartering seized bunkered crude oil for goods like machinery, enabling it to export above its OPEC quota. Neo-Buharism In 2015, with Muhammadu Buhari's return to power as a civilian president, and faced with an economic crisis that included a massive downturn in global oil prices, record level of unemployment, un-diversified economy, and security challenges that cut production without savings due to institutional decay and corruption in successive administrations, Buharism meant an inward-focused strategy that rejected austerity measures targeting the poorest while enhancing investments in infrastructure and leveraging state powers to cut imports. Buharism as an economic policy emphasizes providing incremental domestic production and thus job opportunities by restricting imports and encouraging import substitution. It also emphasizes state investments in infrastructure while curtailing corruption to increase productivity and recovering the economic resources captured by established power blocs to provide social safety nets for the poorest during the transition period to economic self-sufficiency. Criticism Critics have often referred to Buhari's political outlook as dictatorial and authoritarian. The election-centric outlook of Buharism has often been described as an illiberal democracy. Buharism, they argue, and its emphasis on state consequentialism, evidently gives rise to an anti-aristocratic police state as opposed to a legal state. This political anomaly further extends towards a dichotomic relationship between the apparatus of the state on the one hand and legalism on the other, supported by the ruling elite.

Biography He was the son of an artisan and first prepared himself for the calling of a common school teacher, serving in that capacity at the Realschule of Heppenheim an der Bergstra√üe from 1892 to 1896. His literary career began during these years, with the production of poems and short stories, and a number of monographs on German writers, prepared for newspapers in Germany and in the United States. After 1896 he devoted himself entirely to literary pursuits, retaining his home at Heppenheim until 1902, when Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig of Hesse, whose attention had been called to the poet in so favorable a manner that he was determined to give him an opportunity to develop his talents, called him to Darmstadt to become his private librarian. After occupying this position for a few years, Holzamer left it and settled in Paris as correspondent for a number of German papers, moving to Berlin in 1905, where he fell sick with diphtheria and died in the Elizabeth Hospital.

It is a sister church to Darlington United Methodist Church, which forms the Darlington-Rock Run Methodist Charge and is a part of the Baltimore-Washington Conference of the United Methodist Church, headquartered in Columbia, Maryland. It was listed on the Maryland Inventory of Historic Properties in 1977 by the Harford District Commission with code title HA 565.Harford District Commission The church also includes a cemetery behind the building along Rock Run Road. An old school house used to reside on the property. History The founding of Methodism in Harford County, Maryland, can be traced to Francis Asbury during his travels in 1785, when Ms Rachel Barnes Stephenson offered her home as a place of Methodist meetings. This was located near the Rock Run along the Susquehanna River, now located within the boundaries of the Susquehanna State Park. During one of the meetings, her nineteen-year-old son, William Stephenson, was converted. Meetings continued through the following years until 1811. In 1795, approximately ten years after William had been converted to the Methodist faith, he was ordained as a local Methodist preacher. His duties included marriage, burial, and attending to the needs of the sick. In 1830, he and his wife traveled throughout Harford County on horseback to those who were almost secluded from other religious societies.The home of Rev. William Stephenson and the site of Methodist meetings for the Rock Run Society. In 1811, 125 people were members of the Society. It became apparent that more room was needed and the first church was built on land given by Rev. William Stephenson and Mr. Thomas Nathaniel Smith, on the east side of the old Stafford Road (now in the Susquehanna State Park) near a spring. Local field stone were used in the construction of the walls. The building was completed in 1813 and served as both a church and a school house for nearly 30 years. Stephenson is considered the first minister of the Rock Run Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1843, with approximately 145 members, the current stone church was constructed and it was at this time that Craig's Corner Road was named Stafford Road. The land for the church was donated by Stephenson's nephew, Joshua W. Stephens, who also built the church building. Due to the ongoing segregation of the area, a balcony was included inside for the use of the local colored people. It was removed in 1869. Messrs. Oliver Ege and Thomas Swetze were the ministers of the church in the year the Rock Run Church was built. In 1848, the mortgage for the building was paid off, which was written in an old letter by Miss Hannah S. Stephenson to one of the former pastors. In 1893, a 50th anniversary celebration was held at the church with the then minister, Harry D. Mitchell. In preparation for the festivities, the church was painted and decorated. For the celebrations, former ministers who served Rock Run were in attendance. Stained glass windows were added to the building in 1908 during Reverend Beall's term as pastor. In 1912, another renovation occurred that included new carpet. The pulpit furniture currently in the chancel was given in the same year and a painting of a scene regarding the three crosses of Calvary was also completed. It no longer exists.The Rock Run church as it appeared in 1908. The image was taken from the 125th anniversary program. In 1932, shortly after the merger with the Darlington and Thomas Run Methodist Charge, a sesqui-centennial celebration was held. At this time the Rev. Raymond E. Manley was the pastor. In 1945, Thomas Run Church closed which left Rock Run and Darlington United Methodist Church as the remaining churches in the Methodist Charge. Four years later, in 1949, the church was redecorated, with new carpet included, and the addition of side doors on the northeast wall. Chester Soyer was the pastor at that time. With much needed improvements to the building along with the growing needs of the Sunday School, the church formed a committee in 1959 to oversee the construction of a new Christian education wing, which was completed in spring 1962, during the time of the Reverend Luther Starnes. In fall 1967, the church sanctuary was again repainted and the lighted cross was included and placed behind the pulpit. The Church as it appeared in the 1950s. Author unknown. During the week of March 3‚Äì10, 1968, the Church celebrated its 125th anniversary with Bishop John Wesley Lord, Dr. Edward H. Porter (the District Superintendent of the Baltimore Northeast District), and the Reverends Luther W. Starnes (pastor from 1960 to 1962) and Paul Lee Grant (1966 to 1970). Rock Run Academy At the time that the first Rock Run Church was constructed in 1813, the local people decided there was a definite need for a school. It was built and used both as a Church and a school until 1821. The locals named the school the Rock Run Academy, or more formally Stephenson's Stone School House. The Reverend William Stephenson was responsible for its beginning and establishment. The first school teacher was Mr. Samuel Guild, who was from New England. He had previously held the position of a tutor for the Jeremiah Harlan family near Darlington. Jeremiah's son, Dr. David Harlan, attended the Academy shortly after 1813. It was reported that Guild held classes through the week from dawn to dusk and the summer vacation was only two weeks. When Guild died in 1821, the school was discontinued in the church building.Our Harford Heritage Dr. David Harlan, who was born in the then village of Stafford in 1809, now in the Susquehanna State Park, after attending Rock Run Academy later became a distinguished doctor who served in the United States Navy. He served during the Mexican and Civil Wars. He retired in 1871 with the rank of Medical Director of the Navy. Rock Run School The Stephenson farm was the site of the Stephenson school, which was built in 1825. Reverend William Stephenson's daughter, Elizabeth Stephenson, taught at the school house. She received her education at the nearby Gover Seminary, which was opened for approximately five years at the nearby Gover Mansion. The Stephenson school was built of salvaged boards from the nearby Susquehann River and when finished was a one- room building with four windows and a loft. The school was open all year, with the exception of winter months.Our Harford Heritage In 1850, the new Rock Run Public School was opened adjoining the church cemetery. It was a one-room, wooden building. It was later demolished. References *Harford County Directory (1953) *Harford District Commission. (1977). Rock Run Church.

It was registered with the Flag Institute as the flag of the county in 2011. __TOC__ Design The design was developed in consultation with the Flag Institute and has been designed in accordance with the precepts of good flag design. The design is based on the shield from the coat of arms of the former Westmorland County Council. This coat of arms was granted by the College of Arms in 1926 and used by the council until its demise in 1974. Historically Westmorland comprised two baronies: *The Barony of Kendal which covers the southwestern part of the county, including the towns of Kendal and Kirkby Lonsdale. *The Barony of Westmorland which covers the northern part of the county, including Appleby- in-Westmorland, the county town. The two red bars on the flag are from the arms of the de Lancaster family, Barons of Kendal. These also featured prominently in the arms of the former South Westmorland Rural District Council. The stylised apple tree is from the thirteenth-century seal of the Borough of Appleby. Hence, the flag represents the two parts of the county. It is a recognised symbol of Westmorland, being used in the logos of local organisations such as the Westmorland County Football Association. Reaction The MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale Tim Farron said: :\\"I‚Äôd like to congratulate the Westmorland Association for successfully registering the flag. :I hope that it will be enthusiastically adopted by all of us who are lucky enough to live and work in this amazing area. I look forward to seeing it flying high when I am travelling around the South Lakes\\" The flag was flown outside the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government in London as part of Westmorland Day celebrations.

It is a Grade II* listed building. It was built , and according to some sources around 1790, by John Stackhouse of Pendarves, who was a distinguished botanist with an interest in seaweed and plants mentioned by Theophrastus. Stackhouse constructed the castle, with the main purpose of studying marine algae.Pevsner, N. (1970). Cornwall, 2nd ed., revised by E. Radcliffe. Penguin. p. 35. The primary material used for the construction is granite, with the facade and the chimneys made of dressed granite. It has a grouted roof with walls topped by embattled parapets. Wings of two storeys, with tripartite windows, were added at the beginning of the 20th century during its conversion to a country hotel. The castle is named after Susana Stackhouse n√©e Acton, the wife of John Stackhouse, and the heiress of Edward Acton of Acton Scott. John Stackhouse sold the castle to Bulkeley Mackworth Praed, son of William Mackworth Praed a short time before his death. Pread died at the castle on 6 October 1852. The castle passed to his sister, who sold it to Thomas Field, who took up residence at the castle and stayed here for a number of years. In 1861 he sold the castle to Richard Lanyon. After Lanyon's death, his widow remained at the castle till her death in 1899. Below the castle is what is now known as Stackhouse Cove, where Stackhouse pursued his studies.Ralfs, J. (1884). \\"The Marine Algae of West Cornwall\\". Transactions of the Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society. pp. 315‚Äì30. Remains of several large tanks, that were used to hold the seaweed for Stackhouse's research can still be found on the grounds today. In 1797 he published his illustrated work Nereis Britannica.Turk, S. M.; Tompsett, P. E. (Summer 2009). The History of Cornish Seaweed Observers. CISFBR Newsletter. p. 1. During the time the Stackhouses were the owners of the castle, one of their tenants, a local by the name of John Carter who rented the adjoining farm, took advantage of the infrequency of their residence at the castle and used the castle and the cove nearby as a smugglers den. Carter, a prolific smuggler, also known by his nickname, the \\"king of Prussia\\", gave Prussia Cove its name. At one occasion, he even secreted his brother Harry, who had escaped from prison, at the castle. According to local legends, he even constructed tunnels leading from inside the castle premises to the Stackhouse Cove below. The castle was converted into a country hotel during the middle of the twentieth century, but was closed down in 1980s due to lack of business.

The first English edition, translated by Mary Howitt, was published at London, 1843; and a German edition (Das Haus, oder Familiensorgen und Familienfreuden), Leipzig, 1844. An alternative English edition, translated by E A Friedlaender, was published at London in 1849. Background In The Home, Fredrika Bremer for the first time shows herself as the champion of the emancipation of women and their advancement. For years afterward, and especially after her return from a visit to America, it became Bremer's aim in life to deliver also the Swedish woman from the restrictions in her social position. Long before Bremer wrote The Home, the social conditions which confined woman's activities within very narrow limits and left her helpless, unless she was ‚Äúhappily‚Äù married, had aroused the author's indignation. Her bitterness increased when G√∂ta Superior Court opposed the proposition that women, at the age of 25, should have the legal right to manage their own affairs. Through the study of the writings of Harriet Martineau, Bremer had become convinced that reform by law was necessary. Characters and themes The chief character in The Home is Elisa Frank and her relations to her husband, Judge Frank, and her children form the main theme. Fredrika and her own sisters served as models for the daughters whose characters are convincingly described. Petrea, ‚Äúready to give away indiscriminately the presents which had been given to her,‚Äù is the author herself. Tenderness is shown in the description of the death of Henrik (her brother August), while her humor is at its best where Petrea and Jeremiah are described. Evaluation The Home, though not as absorbing as Grannarna, which was translated into many languages and made Bremer famous, it is more true to life. Though the plan of construction of The Home shows a certain weakness, the characters are drawn with superior skill.

He was a candidate for the nomination of the Republican Party for President of the United States in 2012 and 2016, and served as the United States Secretary of Energy until December 1, 2019.  Constitutional issues  Some of Perry's views are in opposition to Constitutional amendments already adopted. In his 2010 book Fed Up!, he takes issue with the Federal government's right to collect income tax, saying \\"if you want to know when Washington really got off the track, the 16th Amendment, giving them the opportunity to take your money with a personal income tax.\\" He also criticizes the 17th Amendment, which allows for the direct election of U.S. Senators. According to Perry, the 16th and 17th Amendments caused states to \\"[hand] over significant chunks of their sovereignty and wealth to the federal government. Congress was free to tax and spend to its heart's content.\\" Perry has expressed support for amending the Constitution to set a nationwide policy on social issues, by prohibiting abortion and same-sex marriage. He also supports abolishing life tenure for judges, empowering Congress to overrule Supreme Court decisions by a two- thirds vote, requirement of a balanced budget, and placing a limit on federal expenditures.  Criticism of Federal Reserve  On August 16, 2011, Perry sharply criticized the Federal Reserve, stating that it would be \\"almost treacherous ‚Äì or treasonous in my opinion\\" to be \\"printing money to play politics\\". Many prominent Republicans criticized Perry for his statements. For instance, Tony Fratto, a Republican who had worked in the Treasury and White House under the Bush administration, described Perry's remarks as \\"inappropriate and unpresidential\\". Perry also suggested that if Chairman Ben Bernanke visited Texas, \\"we would treat him pretty ugly\\", a remark criticized by the White House as threatening. Another of the top-three-polling Republican presidential candidates, Ron Paul, who routinely criticizes Bernanke and has made \\"End the Fed\\" a major platform issue, also criticized Perry's comment, saying that \\"he makes me look like a moderate\\" and that, unlike Perry, \\"I have never once said Bernanke has committed treason.\\"  Immigration  Perry is opposed to the DREAM Act. Perry opposed the building of a Mexico ‚Äì United States barrier. Perry says that the federal government should fulfill its responsibility to its citizens by securing the borders with \\"boots on the ground\\" and technology to improve safety while not harming trade with the state's biggest trading partner, Mexico. Perry said the Arizona immigration law, SB 1070, \\"would not be the right direction for Texas\\" and would distract law enforcement from fighting other crimes. He also opposes requirements that businesses use E-Verify to check the immigration status of prospective employees. He says that employment verification is needed but that the current E-verify system has flaws such as bad data which could be a hindrance to US citizens getting jobs as well as allowing as many as 50% of illegal immigrants through. Perry also wants to grant work visas to undocumented immigrants.\\"Rick Perry Supports Work Visas For Undocumented Immigrants In US.\\" Fox News, 4 November 2011. In response to the 2014 crisis of undocumented, unaccompanied children crossing the border, which generated widespread attention, Perry declared the issue of illegal immigration of minors a \\"side-issue\\" compared with the number of illegal immigrants arriving who have committed crimes, which he estimated was about 80%.  LGBT issues  Rick Perry opposes the legal recognition of same-sex marriage and civil unions, and supported the 2005 ballot proposition which amended the Texas constitution by defining marriage as \\"only a union between a man and a woman\\" and prohibiting the state from creating or recognizing \\"any legal status identical or similar to marriage\\". In 2011, after New York legalized same-sex marriage, Perry stated that it was their right to do so under the principle of states' rights delineated in the 10th Amendment. A spokesman later reiterated Perry's support for a federal constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, saying that position was not inconsistent since an amendment would require approval by three-fourths of the states. In his first book, On My Honor, published in 2008, Perry drew a parallel between homosexuality and alcoholism, writing that he is \\"no expert on the 'nature versus nurture' debate,\\" but that gays should simply choose abstinence. In 2002, Perry described the Texas same-sex anti- sodomy law as \\"appropriate\\". The United States Supreme Court's landmark civil rights decision in Lawrence v. Texas struck down the statute Perry referred to the following year for violating the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution.  Environmental and energy issues  Perry has been a denier of human contributions to climate change. In Perry's book, Fed Up!, he called climate science a \\"contrived phony mess.\\" On August 17, 2011 at a breakfast with business leaders in New Hampshire Perry said that he does not believe the science behind global warming, saying that he thinks \\"there are a substantial number of scientists who have manipulated data so that they will have dollars rolling in to their projects\\". Perry has said that \\"Virtually every day another scientist leaves the global warming bandwagon ... But you won't read about that in the press because they have already invested in one side of the story.\\" Perry's views have been criticized, with fact-checkers stating that surveys showed that more that 97% of climate scientists believed that global warming is anthropogenic and arguing that the ranks of dissenters don't appear to be swelling.Klein, Ezra (August 23, 2011). \\"Despite Rick Perry, consensus on climate change keeps strengthening\\". The Washington PostHolan, Angie Drobnic; Taylor, David G. (August 22, 2011). \\"Rick Perry says more and more scientists are questioning global warming\\". PolitiFact On June 19, 2014 at lunch organized by the Christian Science Monitor Perry criticized the Obama administration's policies on climate change, including proposed regulation of greenhouse gases, saying \\"Calling CO2 a pollutant is doing a disservice the country... I'm not a scientist... I don't believe that we have the settled science by any sense of the imagination...\\". He said he was offended by being called a \\"denier.\\" He said he supports the Keystone XL pipeline. In 2014, a spokesman for Perry cited \\"unsettled science\\" regarding climate change in partial explanation of Perry's opposition to the regulation of greenhouse gases. Texas-based TXU had been planning a $10 billion investment in 11 new coal-fired power plants over the next several years, but drastically reduced those plans in 2007 under the terms of a buyout by a consortium of private equity firms.\\"TXU reversal on coal-plant emissions shocks power industry\\", MarketWatch The Governor's Clean Coal Technology Council\\"Relating to the Creation of the Governor's Clean Coal Technology Council\\".

Perry opposes regulation of greenhouse gas emissions because he says it would have \\"devastating implications\\" for the Texas economy and energy industry.

Social Security  In Perry's book, Fed Up!, published in the fall of 2010, he said that Social Security was \\"a crumbling monument to the failure of the New Deal.\\" He likened the program to \\"an illegal Ponzi scheme\\" and also suggested that it was unconstitutional, having been enacted \\"at the expense of respect for the Constitution and limited government.\\" During the promotion of the book he said that the Federal government should leave health care to the states and focus on putting Social Security on \\"better and more solid footing\\".\\"Texas Gov.

In 2011, after he announced his candidacy for the presidency, a spokesman for Perry said that the book was written \\"as a review and critique of 50 years of federal excesses, not in any way as a 2012 campaign blueprint or manifesto\\". Later, Perry stated in a campaign appearance that he still believed the views in his book, and that he \\"[hadn't] backed off anything in [his] book.\\" Perry has continued to sharply criticize Social Security, describing it as a \\"monstrous lie\\" and a \\"Ponzi Scheme\\". Perry's comments on Social Security have been criticized by many prominent Republicans, including former Vice President Dick Cheney, Republican strategist Karl Rove, and Republican presidential primary candidate Mitt Romney. Romney has released a detailed list of questions as to what would happen if Perry moved Social Security from the federal level over to the states.Ward, Jon (September 21, 2011). \\"Mitt Romney Rules Out Rick Perry's Idea Of Moving Social Security To States\\".

Foreign policy Perry has said that under President Bush's defense secretary, Robert Gates, the Pentagon vastly underestimated China's defense modernization.Chedsey, William (August 27, 2011). \\"Perry: Gates Gave China Fighter-Jet Superiority\\". Newsmax. While visiting Israel in August 2009, Perry gave an interview to the Jerusalem Post in which he affirmed his support for Israel from his religious background, \\"I'm a big believer that this country was given to the people of Israel a long time ago, by God, and that's ordained.\\" In 2011, he accused President Obama of a \\"policy of appeasement\\" for giving \\"equal standing to the grievances of Israelis and Palestinians\\" in peace talks.Stoil, Rebecca Anna; Hoffman, Gil (September 20, 2011). \\"Romney and Perry blame Obama for PA bid\\".

In that same debate, Perry also decried the Obama Administration's refusal to sell F-16C/Ds to Taiwan. Perry criticized Obama's policies in Iraq and Afghanistan, saying that the announcement of the scheduled withdrawal from Iraq by the end of 2011 has endangered American troops in the area.\\"Rick Perry Aims To Reassure Republicans Concerned About Wobbly Debate Performances\\". The Huffington Post. October 30, 2011. Perry has also expressed support for an Israeli military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. In 2012, Perry argued against prosecuting American troops for violations of the Geneva Conventions.\\"Rick Perry accuses Obama administration over Afghanistan video.\\" Associated Press, 15 January 2012. In late 2011, Perry argued for the use of waterboarding as a method of obtaining information from suspects attempting to harm U.S. service personnel. In August 2014, the Pentagon denied Perry's claims that Islamic terrorists were crossing the Texas border. The National Guard members Perry activated to face this \\"threat\\" were then directed to seek help from food banks while they waited to be paid for their service.  Fiscal policy  In October 2011, Perry put forwards a flat tax proposal that would allow taxpayers to choose either their tax rate under existing law or a flat 20% rate. The plan would also eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits and inheritances. Asked if his tax plan would help wealthy taxpayers, Perry said he was not concerned about that because a lower tax rate would encourage greater investment and job creation by the wealthy.Camia, Catalina (October 25, 2011). \\"Rick Perry proposes flat tax, balanced budget\\". USA Today. As Governor of Texas, Perry received grades of B in 2004, B in 2006, B in 2008, B in 2010, C in 2012, and B in 2014 from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors.  2008 presidential endorsements  In October 2007, despite their political differences on many social issues, Perry endorsed Rudy Giuliani for President. \\"Rudy Giuliani is the most prepared individual of either party to be the next President... I'm not talking about any mayor, I'm talking about America's Mayor,\\" Perry said. Some conjectured that, if Giuliani were elected, Perry might have been considered for a position in the new president's cabinet, or perhaps the vice presidency.\\"Texas governor Rick Perry endorses Giuliani\\". The Dallas Morning News. October 17, 2007. Giuliani withdrew from the race on January 30, 2008, after failing to gain support in early primaries. Both Giuliani and Perry immediately endorsed Arizona Senator John McCain for President. Shortly after Mitt Romney's withdrawal from the race in early February, Perry reportedly called McCain rival Mike Huckabee and suggested that he withdraw as well to clear the way for McCain to secure the nomination. Huckabee declined this request and made it clear publicly that he would abandon his presidential bid only if McCain secured enough delegates. Huckabee withdrew his presidential bid on March 5, 2008, after John McCain won the Texas and Ohio primaries.

The peninsula is located at the south end of the Rideau Canal where Lake Ontario empties into the St. Lawrence River. Point Frederick is bounded by the Cataraqui River (Kingston Harbour) to the west, the St. Lawrence River to the south, and Navy Bay to the east. The peninsula is occupied by the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC). Several of the buildings located on Point Frederick and the site of the old naval dockyard are national historic sites. Fort Frederick, at the south end of the peninsula, is a feature of the Kingston Fortifications National Historic Site of Canada. The peninsula was named after Frederick, Prince of Wales. History Fort Henry, Point Frederick and Tete du Pont Barracks, Kingston, from the old redoubt (1841) Map of Point Frederick, c. 1870 Point Frederick c 1874 Aerial view of Point Frederick c. 1920 Point Frederick buildings plaque Indigenous people lived in the area, known as \\"Cataraqui\\" for many years before European colonization. The first Europeans to settle the area were the French, who built Fort Frontenac across the river from the point in 1673. The French referred to Point Frederick as Pointe de Montreal. The area, eventually to be called Kingston, was relinquished to the British after the Seven Years' War and became a receiving centre for Loyalists fleeing from the American Revolution. The Cataraqui area was surveyed in 1783 to determine a suitable location for settlement. Governor Haldimand preferred Point Frederick rather than the area on the west side of the Cataraqui River. This plan, however, was not implemented and settlement proceeded on the west side of the river.Mika, Nick and Helma et al. Kingston, Historic City. Belleville: Mika Publishing Co., 1987. , p. 20 When the Provincial Marine relocated from Carleton Island to Kingston, Point Frederick was established as a naval depot in 1789. The peninsula was the headquarters of the Provincial Marine until 1813 and of the Royal Navy from 1813‚Äì1853.The Canadian Encyclopedia - Royal Military College Retrieved 2013-02-23 During the War of 1812 Point Frederick became a dockyard from which attacks were launched on the American bases at Sackets Harbor and Oswego.Preston, R. Canada\`s RMC: A History of the Royal Military College. University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1969 The Point Frederick War of 1812 Commemorative Plaque, which was installed in 2013, outlines the \\"Strategic importance: During the entire War of 1812, Canadian, British and American land and naval forces campaigned across a vast territory from the Mississippi Valley, through the region south of Montreal, and well into the territories of the Atlantic coast. But the conflict's outcome would be determined, in particular, by events on and around the Great Lakes. For the Anglo-Canadian Forces, the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario was the strategic linkage for manpower and vital supplies for all inland points including the provincial capital, York, the Niagara Peninsula, and further garrisons west. Control of Lake Ontario would give crucial advantages in initiative, surprise, movement and re-supply. During the war, British naval operations on the Lake Ontario were centered here at Point Frederick, at the confluence of the St. Lawrence and Cataraqui Rivers at Lake Ontario. In 1812, the Provincial Marine operated only four vessels armed with 20 short-barreled guns. After May 1813, when the Royal Navy units under Commodore Sir James Yeo took command of the facility, it grew rapidly. At the end of 1814, the Kingston Dockyard produced the largest naval Squadron on the Great Lakes, with 1,600 personnel serving on the massive flagship St. Lawrence, on four other ships, and four smaller vessels totalling 518 guns.\\" Point Frederick War of 1812 Commemorative Plaque With the Rebellions of 1838, the Royal Navy under command of Captain W. Sandom, RN and Royal Marines were on active service at Point Frederick; taking part in the battle of the Windmill at Prescott in 1839. Lieutenant Philip John Bainbrigge (1817‚Äì1881), a Royal Engineer posted to Canada from 1836 to 1842, painted \\"Fort Henry, Point Frederick and Tete du Pont Barracks, Kingston, from the old redoubt\\" (August 1841) showing the Naval Cottages, the Hospital, Stone Frigate, Point Henry and Fort Henry in the distance. The flag flying from atop the Stone Frigate indicates Sandom's HQ. After activities wound down in the following years, the Royal Naval Dockyard was closed in 1853. Because of Kingston's military tradition and the fact that several military buildings already existed at the old naval dockyard, Point Frederick was chosen in 1875 as the location for Canada's first military college, the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC). The dockyard and the Stone Frigate were converted to classrooms, cadet dormitories, a kitchen and mess halls. The stores kept in the Stone Frigate were transferred to less suitable locations further from the pier. Since Point Frederick was a narrow peninsula, officer\`s quarters and a fence could be built to control access, effectively isolating the grounds. The college opened in 1876. Several architecturally significant structures on the peninsula is now used by the Royal Military College of Canada. On the southern part of the peninsula, a forty-foot square blockhouse, which was erected during the winter of 1813, was demolished in the early 1840s to make way for the Martello tower, Fort Frederick, erected in 1812‚Äì13 and rebuilt in 1846. The Martello tower is now the site of the Royal Military College of Canada Museum. The fort is a component of the Kingston Fortifications National Historic Site of Canada. In 1875, the board of governors recommended the adoption of a uniform style of architecture for the college. With a few exceptions, most notably during the depression in the 1930s, subsequent buildings were built of limestone as opposed to brick. An observatory was built in 1885. Between 1885‚Äì90, a boardwalk was built from the outer back gate to the inner gate. A rough breakwater was built on the site of the old wharf between 1885‚Äì90. Near the gymnasium, two tennis courts were constructed between 1885‚Äì1890. Rideout Row or Hogan's Alley, consisting of sixteen small four room cottage houses with basement kitchen facilities was built in 1909 as staff housing. The cottage houses replaced the old naval cottages near the observatory, which had been built in 1822 and were demolished in 1910. In 1909, two squash courts were built on the shore of Navy Bay to the south of the gymnasium, Panet House and the water-pumping plant. In 1918, a temporary wooden building was erected south of the Fort Frederick dormitory for use as a naval college gymnasium and a 'quarter-deck' for divisions and evening quarters for thirty two cadets and twenty-nine ratings who had been rendered homeless by the Halifax Explosion of 6 December 1917. After a fire in 1931, the administration building was rebuilt by men from an unemployment relief camp under the command of the RMC Commandant and enlarged to accommodate a larger library on Barriefield lower common as a measure to deal with the depression. Camp labourers constructed a mechanical engineering building and a physics building during this period with cement blocks as opposed to conforming to the uniform architectural style based on limestone. In 1933, the boathouse was rebuilt after a fire. Camp labourers also dug the foundation for Yeo Hall, a mess and recreation building (1935‚Äì1936) featuring a dining hall, kitchens and a gymnasium. The south wing of Fort Frederick dormitory, now known as Fort La Salle, was added and joined to Yeo Hall by an arch and upper passage featuring a carving of the college arms in 1935‚Äì6. In 1936, camp labourers excavated the foundations of the Fort Haldimand dormitory. When the relief camp closed in 1936, however, the digging stopped. Before 1977, all of the sports fields on the left side of the road going into the College were part of Navy Bay. Part of this land was reclaimed from Navy Bay in 1977‚Äì9. New playing fields on the peninsula were built on landfill reclaimed from Navy Bay.

Peter Screen Priests: The Depiction of Catholic Priests in Cinema, 1900-2018 ISD LLC, 19 Aug 2019 In defiance of the Sacrosanctum Concilium from the edicts of the Second Vatican Council, and a future Fourth Vatican Council, a group of monks from a monastery located on an island offshore the Republic of Ireland conducts the traditional Tridentine Mass in Latin on the Irish mainland. These traditional masses are so popular that groups from all parts of the world make pilgrimages to attend the masses and express their displeasure at the changes in the Roman Catholic Church. This future Vatican Council also destroys the mystery of the Mass, denies Transubstantiation, and insists that priests only wear clerical clothing on ceremonial occasions. The Vatican is outraged at the beginnings of a potential counter reformation, particularly when an upcoming Interfaith dialogue is about to take place in Singapore. The Father General sends out Father Kinsella, a strong adherent of Liberation theology to order the monks to change their ways or face transfer to other monasteries.

As of 2008, ProQuest no longer offers DAI-C as a separate product. Form or content The usability of dissertation abstracts depends largely on their content. Many journals within the medical community have settled on a seven sentence structure, which is also gaining acceptance in the social sciences, education and business. In it, the purpose of the study and methodological choices are outlined succinctly, allowing the reader or researcher to quickly scan and evaluate a number of studies to easily choose ones that meet their particular demands. The structure contains variations on the following seven sentence stems: \\"The purpose of this study is....\\" \\"The scope of this study....\\" \\"The methodology....\\" \\"The Findings...\\" \\"Conclusions reached are ...\\" \\"Limitations of this study include....\\" \\"This study contributes....\\" Abstracts of dissertation proposals contain the same seven concepts, substituting data collection and analysis in place of findings and conclusions.

Pehrson also currently performs with the folk rock band The Fall Risk, which he founded, and previously performed with Box Set, a folk rock band which he cofounded. Early life Jeff was born in 1967 in the Haight-Asbury district of San Francisco. His mother was of Native American heritage and his father, who was a concert pianist, was of Northern European descent. Jeff was adopted at three months of age by John Pehrson, who was an electrician and flight instructor, and Janice Quintana (n√©e Petrie), who was an administrative assistant. Jeff's father remarried Christina Grant, a nurse, in 1980, and has a half-sister, Heather, from that marriage. Jeff was raised in the East Bay area in San Leandro, California and attended Pacific High School from 1981 until 1983, when the school closed, and subsequently attended San Leandro High School until his graduation in 1985. Jeff credits his earliest musical exposure to his father, a stereo fanatic who regularly played jazz music at home, and to his mother, a native of Kansas, who loved listening to country music. In the fourth grade, Jeff started playing saxophone in his school band and continued until the ninth grade, when he began focusing his attention on playing football for the school team and participating in the school's theater, performing regularly in plays and musicals, where his singing skills became increasingly apparent. Musical career In 1985, Jeff matriculated at San Francisco State University, where he majored variously in broadcasting, political science, theater arts, and ultimately, creative writing. In college, Jeff was first exposed to guitar playing via friends in his dormitory, eventually trading his old saxophone for a guitar of his own. He took to the instrument extremely well with an apparent natural ability, and quickly proceeded to mastering rhythm guitar technique, which he used as a foundation for his subsequent songwriting. In 1986, Jeff pursued his love for improvisational comedy by cofounding the Ground Zero Comedy Troupe with his college roommate, Jeff Ballard. The ensemble, which included six comedians and a band, performed humorous skits punctuated by musical numbers, and became increasingly popular around campus. In 1987, Pehrson, along with Matt Twain, began frequenting The Owl and the Monkey Cafe in San Francisco, where they started out performing Pehrson's original songs as the Twain & Pehrson Duo on Thursday's \\"open mic\\" nights, ultimately appearing regularly in 1989 as part of the caf√©'s Saturday night concert series. In 1991, Jeff first met singer- songwriter Jim Brunberg, who came to hear the duo perform at Simple Pleasures, a caf√© in San Francisco's Richmond District. Recognizing their innate musical chemistry, the three united and formed the trio Box Set, named for the then growing trend of artists releasing box set compilations. After a few months of playing locally, Pehrson and Brunberg decided to begin touring regionally. However, Twain, who had a day job, did not wish to travel and decided to leave the band. The resulting Box Set duo began playing small venues between San Francisco and Seattle. In the summer of 1992, the two bought one-way tickets to Europe, where they spent several months playing their music in the streets, selling demo tapes, and writing songs. Returning to the US with accelerating enthusiasm and a plethora of fresh material, the duo began playing more frequently and at larger venues in the Bay Area. The songwriting and vibrant vocal harmonies of the two have prompted comparisons to Simon & Garfunkel. Aspiring to diversify their sound, though, Box Set added bass player Chad Heise and drummer Matt Abbott in 1993, and, shortly after producing their eponymous debut CD, recruited harmonica/keyboard player Sam Johnston in 1994. The band was recognized by Billboard on their \\"Honor Roll of Unsigned Talent\\" in 1994, and was named \\"Group of the Year\\" by the National Academy of Songwriters in 1995. In 1997, Box Set won two Bay Area Music Awards (\\"Bammies\\") for \\"Best Club Band\\" and \\"Outstanding Americana/Roots Band\\". Shortly thereafter, the group began touring nationally, opening for a number of bands, including Huey Lewis and the News and RatDog, and were signed by Capricorn Records, releasing the CD, Thread, in 1998, which was produced by Grammy Award winner Joe Chiccarelli. Box Set released a total of 12 recordings between 1991 and 2006. Box Set continued with a rigorous touring schedule, performing with groups such as Dave Matthews Band, Barenaked Ladies, Lenny Kravitz, Willie Nelson, Hot Tuna, Blues Traveler, and the Goo Goo Dolls, until 2004, when their touring pace slowed, in part due to Brunberg's moving to Portland in 2002, and eventually entering law school (though he never pursued a law career, opting instead to open Mississippi Studios recording studio/music venue). In 2006, Box Set performed its last show at the Sweetwater Saloon in Mill Valley, CA. Jeff subsequently worked in marketing for a merger and acquisitions firm in San Francisco before eventually creating another band in 2009, The Fall Risk, composed of Jeff Pehrson (guitar, vocals), Jeff Ballard (harmonica, percussion), Matt Twain (keyboards, vocals), Mark Abbott (drums) and Eddie Berljafa (bass). In 2010, The Fall Risk added Sam Johnston (organ, accordion, pedal steel) and Rich Goldstein (rhythm, lead, and slide guitar), and in 2011, added \\"Fiddle\\" Dave Muhlethaler (fiddle, mandolin) and Phil Savell (lead guitar). In 2012, \\"Fiddle\\" Dave Muhlethaler left the band, followed by Jeff Ballard and Eddie Berljafa in 2013, at which time Mike Sugar began playing bass. In 1997, Box Set's \\"Can't Save Myself\\" (written by Jeff Pehrson) appeared on the soundtrack for the movie, Trial and Error. In 2001, Pehrson played a biker named Snake in the movie, Christmas in the Clouds. In 2003, Pehrson wrote songs and performed vocals on Jack Casady's first solo album, Dream Factor. In late 2009, Furthur decided to add backing vocals to their newly formed band, enlisting Zoe Ellis and Sunshine Becker. After Zoe left the group in early 2010 to focus on her a cappella ensemble, SoVoS√≥, Jeff was recruited as her replacement and debuted on May 24, 2010. In early 2012, Jeff Pehrson and Jim Brunberg performed together for the first time since 2006 with a Box Set Duo reunion and later played a 7 night run in June 2012 at McMenamins Al's Den in Portland, OR. In March 2013, The Fall Risk began recording their first CD at TRI Studios, which was released on August 1, 2013. Personal life When not performing with Furthur or The Fall Risk, Jeff enjoys riding his Harley-Davidson motorcycle, jet-skiing, reading political satire, sampling regional wines, traveling and spending time with his fianc√©e.

The strike, which lasted from June to October 1921, caused severe losses to the Madras economy. It also created a rift in the ruling Justice Party forcing many Dalit leaders to leave.  Causes  The Madras Labour Union was one of the first organised labour unions in India, having been founded by B. P. Wadia and V. Kalyanasundaram Mudaliar on 3 April 1918. Early union activity took place in the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills during October‚ÄìDecember 1920 when workers struck in protest against working conditions. The government responded by ordering the police to shoot down striking workers on 9 December 1920 to bring the strike to a forceful end. There was widespread unrest among the workers over the low wages and poor working conditions. Their demands were supported by Indian nationalists C. Rajagopalachari, S. Kasturi Ranga Iyengar, A. Rangaswami Iyengar, Singaravelu Chetty, V. Chakkarai Chettiar and S. Satyamurti and by the self-rule supporting Indian National Congress as well as the pro-British Justice Party.  Events  On 20 May 1921, the workers in the Spinning Department of the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills refused to work until the management agreed to discuss their wage rise demands. The protest reached serious proportions when an official strike was declared on 20 June. The striking workers were led by Congressman V. Kalyanasundaram Mudaliar. The Indian National Congress convened a meeting in Madras on 10 July 1921; in this meeting, C. Rajagopalachari moved for a resolution sympathizing with the workers of the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills and supporting their cause. The strike lasted for a total of six months. The authorities adopted a ruthless policy to suppress the agitation. On 29 August 1921, the police opened fire, killing six workers. Almost all the Justice Party leaders joined hands with the Indian National Congress politicians and supported the strike. The support lent by the Justice Party towards striking workers is believed by some to have been influenced by caste identifications, while others believe that the strike actually gave the Justice Party ministry a stick with which to beat the Governor's council, as the Home ministry came under the direct control of the Governor of Madras. The management tactically broke up the unity of the workers by allegedly enlisting the support of Dalits and Indian Christians who had not joined the strike. The abstention of Dalit workers from the strike was severely criticized by the Raja of Panagal, the Chief Minister of Madras Presidency and O. Thanikachalam Chetti. The strike gradually evolved into a confrontation between caste Hindu and Muslim workers who were determined to continue the strike on one hand, and Dalits and Indian Christians who did not participate in the strike on the other. A communal riot broke out on 28 June 1921 when a caste Hindu mob attacked the Dalit village of Puliyanthope and burnt a hundred huts. The Justice Party's publication, Justice blamed the riots on the \\"pampering\\" of Dalits by the Labour Department of the Madras government while Dalit leader M. C. Rajah accused the union leaders of threatening non-participating Dalits from entering the mills. He also criticized the attitude of the Justice Party government of the Raja of Panagal towards Dalits: The strike eventually came to an end in October through the mediation of C. Natesa Mudaliar. That month, Sir P. Theagaraya Chetty, the then President of the Madras Labour Union, advised workers to resume work. But with the exception of a few, most of the striking workers were not re- admitted.  Aftermath  In the aftermath of the strike, the major political factions in the Madras Presidency began leveling charges against one another. The Indian National Congress blamed the government for the ruthless suppression of labour activities, while the Justice Party blamed the Non- Cooperation Movement for causing the unrest and criticized the government for showing partiality towards Dalits. The party demanded that the provision of free meals to Dalits in government camps should be stopped and offenders from all the communities be punished. The Madras government appointed a three- member enquiry committee headed by Sir William Ayling to investigate the causes of the strike. The committee blamed the striking workers for causing extensive damage to property and life, and highlighted the victimization of \\"Adi Dravidas\\". The Home Member of the Governor's Executive Council, Sir Lionel Davidson, said that all the violence was caused not by a labour strike but by \\"a faction inflamed by caste prejudice\\". M. C. Rajah made the following observation on Dalits and the strike:  Notes  Category:1921 in India Category:Textile and clothing strikes Category:Labour disputes in India Category:Textile industry in Tamil Nadu Category:Economic history of Tamil Nadu Category:Indian independence movement in Tamil Nadu Buckingham and Carnatic Mills Strike Category:History of the textile industry in India ","title":"1921 Buckingham and Carnatic Mills strike"},{"id":"33636945","text":"John Hulley (19 February 1832 ‚Äì 6 January 1875) was an English gymnastics and athletics entrepreneur who encouraged public participation in physical education to improve health and well-being, and was one of the instigators of the Olympic movement in Britain. At his Liverpool Gymnasium in 1865 he established the National Olympian Association, the forerunner of the British Olympic Association. With William Penny Brookes and Ernst Georg Ravenstein, he organised the first National Olympian Games in 1866. He organised a series of Assault-at-Arms gymnastic events in Liverpool and Manchester. He organised six Olympic Festivals between 1862 and 1867 in Liverpool and Llandudno. With Robert B. Cummins, he exposed American magicians the Davenport brothers. He introduced the velocipede into Liverpool. Early life John Hulley was born on 19 February 1832 at 10 Gloucester Street, Liverpool, Lancashire, the only son of John Nevitt Hulley (1803‚Äì1840) surgeon, and his wife Elizabeth Speed of Overton, Flintshire (1799‚Äì1890).The National Archives reference C 15/204/H136 He was baptised at St David's Church, Brownlow Hill, Liverpool on 19 July 1832.Register of St David's Church, Brownlow Hill, Liverpool His four uncles, grandfather and great grandfather were all in the medical profession. His ancestors came from Frodsham and previously Rainow in Cheshire. From an early age Hulley had a keen interest in physical activities, education and fitness. He was taught by Louis Huguenin, the famous French gymnast who had settled in Liverpool in 1844 as a teacher of Gymnastics. John attended Huguenin's school in a court at the top of Lord Street for several years before matriculating from the Collegiate Institute, Shaw Street, Liverpool in 1850.Liverpool Citizen, 25 February 1888 ‚Äì Some Old Liverpudlians [By One of Them] ‚Äì No. 11 ‚Äì John Hulley, Gymnasiarch John was destined to succeed his teacher and became the uncrowned king of the local gymnasts. Vocation in physical education In January 1858 Charles Pierre Melly, a Liverpool philanthropist (an ancestor of the late George Melly, musician and entertainer, and Andr√©e Melly film actress) applied to purchase a piece of corporation land for the purpose of transforming it into a free recreative ground, and fitting it up with a gymnasium and other appliances for the use of the local working-class people.The Standard, 12 January 1858 ‚Äì Recreations for the People With John Hulley, he founded the Liverpool Athletic Club at the Rotunda Gymnasium, Bold Street, Liverpool (with the motto mens sana in corpore sano ‚Äì a healthy mind in a healthy body), and was its first president.Liverpool Mercury, 3 December 1863 ‚Äì Grand Assault at Arms John Hulley's first public speech on the role of physical education was given on 25 April 1861 at the Theatre Royal, Williamson Square, Liverpool and was part of a display by members of the 79th Lancashire Volunteer Rifles entitled \\"A Grand Assault of Arms\\".

Huguenin's Liverpool Gymnasium performed a great variety of gymnastic exercises.Liverpool Mercury, 25 April 1861 ‚Äì The Assault on Arms at the Theatre-RoyalMorning Post, 29 April 1861 ‚Äì \\"Assault of Arms\\" at Liverpool Another Assault-at-Arms was held at the same venue in December 1861, where John Hulley delivered an address on physical education in which he stressed the need for physical as well as mental excellence.Liverpool Mercury, 5 December 1861 ‚Äì Grand Assault on Arms Olympic Festivals The 1st Grand Olympic Festival was held at Mount Vernon Parade Ground, Liverpool in June 1862 and John Hulley, Honorary Secretary of the club organised the event.Liverpool Mercury, 12 June 1862 ‚Äì The Grand Olympic Festival The Liverpool Mercury reported that Hulley was praised by Mr. Melly who said that \\"it was entirely owing to John Hulley's indefatigable and praiseworthy exertions that the festival had been brought to such a successful and highly satisfactory issue\\". The Mercury's report also acknowledged the work of John Hulley in making a success of the festival.Liverpool Mercury, 16 June 1862 ‚Äì The Grand Olympic Festival An Assault-at-Arms was held at St. George's Hall, Liverpool in December 1862, again organised by John Hulley.Cheshire Observer and General Advertiser, 2 May 1863 ‚Äì Letter to Editor ‚Äì Physical Education This was followed by the 2nd Olympic Festival held on 13 June 1863 at the Mount Vernon Parade Ground, Liverpool in front of 12,000 to 15,000 spectators.Liverpool Mercury, 15 June 1863 ‚Äì Grand Olympic Festival A Grand Assault-at-Arms held at the Theatre Royal, Liverpool by the Liverpool Athletic Society on 2 December 1863 was the occasion when the prizes won at the Olympic Festival in June were distributed to the winners.Liverpool Mercury, 3 December 1863 ‚Äì Grand Assault at Arms The 3rd Olympic Festival took place in the Zoological Gardens on 9 July 1864, having been postponed from a week earlier due to bad weather, and was formally opened by Sir John Jones.Liverpool Mercury, 2 July 1864 ‚Äì Programme for the 3rd Olympic FestivalLiverpool Mercury, 4 July 1864 ‚Äì Postponement of the Olympic FestivalLiverpool Mercury, 9 July 1864 ‚Äì The Olympic Festival In his address he said inter alia \\"I am sure you will excuse me if I bring to your notice the name of an individual who has exerted himself on behalf of the Athletic Club in a manner not to be exceeded ‚Äì I mean Mr. John Hulley. (Loud cheers.) You are indebted to him for the club which has been established at Liverpool; you are indebted to him for these festivals, and as far as my knowledge goes, the most indefatigable exertions for the promotion of physical education have been displayed by him\\". (Cheers.)Liverpool Mercury, 11 July 1864 ‚Äì The Olympic Festival The Foundation stone of the new Liverpool Gymnasium was officially laid on 19 July 1864 in Myrtle Street by the Mayor, with John Hulley as manager and self-styled Gymnasiarch (an Athenian officer who superintended the gymnasia). Mr. C.P. Melly addressed the invited guests and explained that judging from the success of the Rotunda Gymnasium, and the large receipts from its subscribers during its short career, it was believed that if the services of Mr. Hulley could be secured then an institution might be founded which would be not only of benefit to the public, but also to those who gave their money to it.Liverpool Mercury, 19 July 1864 ‚Äì Laying of the Foundation Stone of the new Liverpool Gymnasium In 1864 John Hulley had the time and inclination to write to The Times suggesting that England should adopt a type of bathing dress used by continentals ‚Äì \\"Gentlemen, wives and daughters walking down to the water were all dressed in a seemly yet convenient fashion. The men wear simply loose, baggy trousers, and a skirted Garibaldi of the same or corresponding material. The ladies wear what may be described as a simple Bloomer costume, consisting of jackets, shaped variously according to taste and loose trousers reaching to the ankle. The dress is completed by slippers, to protect the feet from the shingle, and a straw hat, neatly trimmed to protect the fair wearer's complexion\\".The Times, 6 August 1864 ‚Äì Sea-Bathing in England and France John Hulley's prowess in the field of physical education was formally recognised by the Wenlock Olympian Society in October 1864 when they elected him to honorary membership and awarded him a silver medal as a mark of their appreciation of his talented and valuable services in the cause of physical education.Liverpool Mercury, 18 October 1864 ‚Äì No title ‚Äì page 7 The medal was rediscovered in 2008 in an attic in Wallasey by a descendant of Georgiana Hulley, n√©e Bolton, the wife of John Hulley. The 4th Olympic Festival was held outside Liverpool for the first time, at Llandudno on Saturday 22 and Monday 24 July 1865 at the Croquet Ground above the baths. John Hulley again organised the festival which included an athletic meeting held on the side of the Great Orme and a Grand Procession of Illuminated Boats on the Bay. Unfortunately this had to be postponed from the Saturday evening to the Monday due to the Llandudno boatmen re-hiring their boats to someone else after a price had been agreed with Hulley. At the end of the festival John Hulley was thanked and three cheers were heartily given by the crowd.North Wales Chronicle, 29 July 1865 ‚Äì Olympic Festival at Llandudno The following week's edition of the North Wales Chronicle appealed to the organisers to organise another athletic meeting.North Wales Chronicle, 5 August 1865 ‚Äì Llandudno ‚Äì The Olympic Festival The Liverpool Gymnasium was formally opened on 6 November 1865 by Lord Stanley, who said \\"I congratulate the managers upon having in Mr Hulley, a director who is working out a very real and enthusiastic interest in the business which he is employed to do\\".The Times, 7 November 1865 ‚Äì A Real Move in Physical Education On the same day at the Liverpool Gymnasium John Hulley took the Chair on the formation of the National Olympian Association (NOA) and the Liverpool Mercury reported the inaugural meeting with the following persons present: This meeting was the forerunner of the modern British Olympic Association and was formed mainly through the efforts of John Hulley, Dr. Brookes and Mr Ravenstein ‚Äì the triumvirate of the 19th century Olympic movement. The NOA's articles of foundation provided the framework for the Olympic Charter. The traditional winter Assault-at-Arms was held at the Liverpool Gymnasium on 8 February 1866 under the auspices of John Hulley, with Sir John Jones KCB, hero of Delhi and late President of the Athletic Society in the chair. A large audience was entertained by several gymnastic performances, broadsword and fencing contests, and boxing bouts, one of which featured Jem Mace the current English boxing champion. All proceeds were donated to the Children's Hospital in Liverpool.Liverpool Mercury, 9 February 1866 ‚Äì The Liverpool Gymnasium ‚Äì The Grand Assault at ArmsThe Porcupine, 17 February 1866 ‚Äì The Gymnasiarch and the Children's Infirmary The 5th Olympic Festival was again held at Llandudno on 25‚Äì26 June 1866.The Illustrated London News, 7 July 1866 ‚Äì The Olympic Festival at Llandudno John Hulley followed this event by organising a swimming fete for juveniles at the same venue on 27 July 1866. During his stay at Llandudno he revisited his views concerning the modes of bathing attire for males and females. He addressed a large gathering on the Parade and spoke about the need for British holiday resorts to follow the lead of those on the continent in the matter of dress. His main theme was simply that there were two things to be done before British bathing will be as decent, as moral, as enjoyable, as bathing on the continent. The first was to get men and women to wear decent bathing dresses; and the second was, to induce them to be in company. At the close of his address, discussion was invited, but, with the exception of two gentlemen who spoke in favour of Mr Hulley's views, no discussion was entered upon. The question was then put to the meeting whether the views advocated were such as met the approval of those present, and was carried unanimously. His speech was reported in the Pall Mall Gazette of 7 September 1866.Liverpool Mercury, 29 August 1866 ‚Äì Llandudno ‚Äì The Gymnasiarch of Liverpool on Civilised BathingPall Mall Gazette, 7 September 1866 ‚Äì British Bathing in 1866 John Hulley, with help from William Penny Brookes and Ernst Ravenstein, staged Britain's first National Olympian Games held on 31 July 1866 by the River Thames at Teddington for aquatic events and 1 August 1866 at the Crystal Palace Park Cricket Ground for other events. John Hulley's presence at the Games and mode of dress drew considerable attention and a report in the Penny Illustrated Paper mentioned: > A turbaned gentleman, attired in the garb of a Turk was supposed to > represent the East at the Olympian Festival, but the fancifully-dressed one > turned out to be the Gymnasiarch of Liverpool, John Hulley, and whom no more > gorgeously apparelled.The Penny Illustrated Paper, 11 August 1866 ‚Äì At the > National Olympic Festival The Liverpool Gymnasium reopened for the winter season on Monday 10 September 1866 after a 2-month break. During this period John Hulley had spent time on the continent visiting the principal gymnasia there. In March 1867, he was called upon to advise Sir Philip Egerton and Mr. Reginald Cholmondeley, representatives of the famous public school at Rugby on the erection of a new gymnasium.Liverpool Mercury, 11 September 1866 ‚Äì Re-opening of the Liverpool GymnasiumLiverpool Mercury, 23 May 1867 ‚Äì A Gymnasium for Rugby In planning for the forthcoming Olympic Festival in Liverpool, John Hulley drew attention to his decision that all the contests would be open to amateurs only. He had taken the most stringent precautions that not only the \\"professional\\" but the \\"semi-professional\\" element would be strictly excluded and it was among these classes that disputes and disturbances most frequently arose. This could possibly be the first occasion in which the differences between professional and amateur sportsmen came into the public arena.Liverpool Mercury, 29 May 1867 ‚Äì The Olympic Festival and the Ladies of Liverpool The 6th Olympic Festival was held on 28 June 1867 at the Myrtle Street gymnasium, continued on 29 June at the Sheil Park Athletic Grounds, Liverpool. John Hulley gave a long speech at the former venue and offered this advice: It appears that John Hulley, now President of the Athletic Society, took a back seat in the organisation of this event because of the report which included \\"and the programme was got through very shortly after the appointed time, and this act of itself testifies to the completeness of the arrangements. A better managed Olympic festival has not been held in Liverpool; and this is in great measure due to the exertions of Messrs J.B. Lee and W. D. Hogarth, who, after winning many laurels in the ranks as competitors, this year appeared in the character of joint honorary secretaries.\\"Liverpool Mercury, 1 July 1867 ‚Äì Athletic Society of Great Britain On 29 August 1867 John Hulley and others responded to a request from the Llandudno townsfolk by organising another Grand Carnival. During the day, as the programme has it, \\"in order to restore a light on the evening‚Äôs amusements, a bazaar for the sale of Chinese lanterns was extemporised on the parade.\\" At a little after 8 pm, a grand procession of boats, illuminated all over ‚Äì rigging them astern ‚Äì with lanterns and coloured fire, was started from the landings steps.Liverpool Mercury, 2 September 1867 ‚Äì Llandudno Carnival A Handbook of Gymnastics And Athletics by P.

A Grand Assault at Arms was again held at the Liverpool Gymnasium, Myrtle Street, on 28 March 1868 under the direction of John Hulley and a large audience of spectators witnessed an excellent programme of exercises by the gymnasts. During an interval in the proceedings, diplomas were presented to successful competitors by the Mayor.Liverpool Mercury, 30 March 1868 ‚Äì Assault-at-Arms John Hulley was a patron of the Mercantile Assistants' Athletic Festival which took place at Spekeland Park, Smithdown Lane, Liverpool on 11 July 1868. There was no mention of him in the subsequent report, and compared with his organising abilities in previous athletic festivals, this event was a very small one and appeared to signal the end of his involvement in athletic festivals in Liverpool.Liverpool Mercury, 26 June 1868 ‚Äì Advertisement for Liverpool Mercantile Assistants' Athletic FestivalLiverpool Mercury, 11 July 1868 ‚Äì Advertisement for Public Amusements etc Velocipede and bicycle races 1869 commenced with England being enthralled with the new-fangled velocipede. In January, John Hulley immediately recognised the commercial potential of it in relation to exercises and gymnastics, and contacted several of the principle velocipede makers in Paris, New York and elsewhere.Liverpool Mercury, 20 January 1869 ‚Äì The Bicycle He eventually procured a velocipede from Paris and organised a \\"Velocipede Club\\" at the Liverpool Gymnasium.Morning Post, 20 January 1869 ‚Äì Velocipedes On 22 May 1869 a number of bicycle races were held at the racecourse at Hoylake. 1000 persons watched the events, which was organised by a committee including John Hulley.Liverpool Mercury, 24 May 1869 ‚Äì Bicycle Races at Hoylake Criticism of John Hulley? The general reputation of John Hulley in the latter years of the 1860s appears to have lessened, but the reasons why are unclear. An article in the Cheshire Observer and Chester, Birkenhead, Crewe and North Wales Times of 1 May 1869, may give an indication of the view of the local press towards him, although his work regarding the health and welfare of the lower classes would have still been positive. The unknown author had attended a Bicycle Tournament at the Liverpool Gymnasium and had scornfully compared it with the performances of Music Hall acrobats. He went on to criticise Hulley as \\"one of the most, it not the most unpopular man in the town, though whether that is his fault or his misfortune is not for me to determine\\". He acknowledged that John Hulley was undoubtedly a public benefactor, but went on to suggest that everyone in Liverpool was familiar \\"with his grotesque figure\\" and his hair reminded him of the waves in The Tempest.Cheshire Observer and Chester, Birkenhead, Crewe and North Wales Times (Chester, England), 1 May 1869; pg. 8 ‚Äì Liverpool Notes Exposure of the Davenport brothers Hulley and a colleague called Robert B.

The marriage was an explosive affair: the father by some means had learnt of the proposed nuptials, and at once put in force parental authority to prevent its being carried out to its full fruition. The means taken for this purpose were of the most effectual character. The lady was locked in her chamber, and to all her entreaties \\"the father was flint and the mother was stone\\". However, love prevailed in the face of adversity and thanks to assistance by friends, the happy couple tied the knot a day later. This attracted widespread press coverage throughout the country and several reports of the on-off-on marriage filled the columns of many newspapers for several days after the event.Liverpool Mercury, 16 July 1869 ‚Äì The Gymnasiarch and the Merchant's Daughter ‚Äì A Sudden Prevention of a MarriageBradford Observer, 16 July 1869 ‚Äì The Gymnasiarch and the \\"Cruel Parent\\"Leeds Mercury, 16 July 1869 ‚Äì The Gymnasiarch and the \\"Cruel Parent\\"Glasgow Herald, 19 July 1869 ‚Äì A Marriage under DifficultiesLiverpool Mercury, 17 July 1869 ‚Äì Marriage of the Gymnasiarch A daughter, Georgiana Theodosis, was born in Liverpool in December 1870.

Unveiling ceremony at the Lifestyles Park Road Sports Centre Liverpool. Statue on Marine Parade Apart from a brief mention in an event at the Gymnasium in February 1873, John Hulley faded from the public spotlight after being in its glare for over 12 years. Later reports talk about a trip to North America; he also wintered on the continent to avoid the worst of the English weather but remained in Liverpool throughout the winter of 1874‚Äì75 and unfortunately encountered severe weather. This proved fatal and he died on 6 January 1875 at 91 Grove Street, Liverpool, aged 42.Liverpool Mercury, 8 January 1875 ‚Äì DeathsLiverpool Mercury, 12 January 1875 ‚Äì Funeral of the Late Mr. John Hulley He was survived by his wife Georgiana and daughter Georgiana Theodosis. Hulley's funeral was conducted by Hugh Stowell Brown, a well-known Baptist minister. At the funeral in Smithdown Road Cemetery on 11 January 1875, Brown spoke of the value of physical conditioning: 'exercises benefit the pupils in bodily health, but they led to the cultivation of manly habits, of temperance, and of self-denial, and so acted upon the moral character as well as the physical frame.' In his Commonplace Book Brown noted: \\"Today I buried John Hulley, the Gymnasiarch. He was at one time apparently a very popular man in Liverpool, but there were not more than a dozen people at his funeral. It is a heartless world!\\"Hugh Stowell Brown, ed W S Caine, Extracts from His Commonplace Book, in Hugh Stowell Brown, A Memorial Volume, p 160. Recent events =Rediscovery of John Hulley's grave= The revival of his role in Olympic history was initiated by an article in the Journal of Olympic History entitled \\"The Mystery of John Hulley\\". Subsequently, his grave was rediscovered in 2008; it was badly damaged in that the headstone had been removed from the main covering stones and the grave was in a very bad condition from 130 years of atmospheric pollution. =The John Hulley Memorial Fund= A Memorial Fund was set up to raise money for the restoration of Hulley's grave; to increase awareness of his part in the founding of the British Olympic movement and to revive the interest in him as one of England's finest and forward-looking men. This took several months but thanks to generous donations from the International Olympic Committee, the British Olympic Association, and members of the public, sufficient funds were raised to engage a stonemason. =Restoration and Re-dedication of John Hulley‚Äôs grave= Messrs Welsbys of Liverpool renovated the grave and brought it back to its original condition and a re-dedication ceremony was held on Sunday 14 June 2009 at Toxteth Park Cemetery, Smithdown Road. An Olympic flag had been borrowed from the International Olympic Committee to cover the grave and the Revd Graham Murphy B.A. Dip.Post.Theol., Minister of Toxteth Unitarian Chapel, Liverpool spoke about John Hulley: =The John Hulley Memorial plaque= The plaque commemorating the life and work of the Liverpool Gymnasiarch John Hulley was unveiled on Friday 25 April 2014 by the Lord-Lieutenant of Merseyside and the Lord Mayor of Liverpool at the Lifestyles Park Road Sports Centre. Before an audience of invited guests, Tom Southern, Director of Operation Pathfinder and member of the John Hulley Olympic Festival committee, welcomed everyone to the ceremony and introduced Robin Baynes MBE founder of the Liverpool Heartbeat charity, and Ray Hulley family historian, as keynote speakers at the ceremony. Robin gave an overview of the John Hulley Olympic Festival and the current work in hand to publicise forthcoming events, and Ray spoke of how he researched the life and death of John Hulley and the work necessary to renovate and rededicate his grave. Tom Southern then invited the Lord-Lieutenant (Dame Lorna E F Muirhead DBE) to address the gathering before presenting the plaque on behalf of her Majesty the Queen to The Lord Mayor Councillor Gary Millar who accepted it on behalf of the city of Liverpool. =Waterfront Statue= On 14 June 2019, Princess Anne unveiled a statue of John Hulley on Coburg Wharf, beside the Mersey river. Also in attendance was Tim Quinn, a former Marvel comic book creator who collaborated with Russ Leach to create a comic immortalising Hulley as \\"The First Superhero\\", and a number of schoolchildren from the schools where Tim has given talks. Acknowledgements and tributes Many acknowledgements and tributes to John Hulley's devotion to physical education were made during his lifetime including the following. A correspondent, writing in the Liverpool Mercury of 6 May 1863 reflected the feeling of a growing number of Liverpudlians: Lord Stanley formally opened the Liverpool Gymnasium on 7 November 1865 and was fulsome in his praise of John Hulley. He congratulated the managers upon having in Mr. Hulley a director, who is working not merely for the salary he earns, and which they will be the first to admit is a very inadequate recompense for his labour, but who is working out of a real and enthusiastic interest in the business he is employed to do. He went on to say: Following his death, the Liverpool Mercury wrote: An account of John Hulley's life was featured in the Liverpool Citizen of 25 February 1888 by an unknown writer who obviously had a close association with him. Finally, a 21st-century tribute to him has been instrumental in reviving John Hulley's name, deeds and influence in the early Olympic movement in time for the Games of the XXX Olympiad in London: References Further reading * Day, Dave; Editor (2011).

The club is sponsored by Deloitte and Malones Irish Bar.http://www.euhc.co.uk/men/sponsors.php?s=1 Club Sponsors - Edinburgh University Hockey Club  Club History  The first mention of Hockey at the university was in 1899 when a notice was published in the Student which read \\"Would those in favour of starting a Hockey Club in connection with the University kindly forward their names and addresses to the Secretary, Hockey Club, University PO?\\" One of these founding members was G.M.Melville who although was born in Ireland he was schooled in England and attended university in Scotland. There is no further mention of the club until 1901 when pitches were secured at Craiglockhart and play commenced. On 18 November that year the University Hockey Club as represented that year at the meeting of clubs in Scotland when it was agreed to form a Scottish Hockey Association and so it would seem that the club was instrumental in starting the Scottish Hockey Union! The first match was played against Dumbarton and it was lost with the rest of the season recording 11 played, won 4, lost 5 and drawn 2. By the end of the season a second XI was started and so the sport must have proved a success. The club was admitted to the University Athletic Club (now the Sports Union) in 1902 when W. Sibbald Robertson was the captain and in that year no less than 5 University players were recorded internationalists. T.P Caverhill was one of these 5 and must have been especially good given his numerous mentions and was subsequently awarded blues. The 1905-1906 season was especially good when of the sixteen matches played, twelve were won, three drawn and only one lost. One member of this team was especially of note. Frank Fasson was a former internationalist rugby player and must have brought all his speed and fiery temperament to the Hockey pitch which he demonstrated one match when he took a dislike to his opposing number and slashed his stick against the man‚Äôs shins. The next week Frank had a tooth ache and went to the dentist and much to his dismay found that his dentist consultant was none other than his previous opposing player. However the great sportsman Dr N.L. Stevenson took neither advantage nor a fee! It was Fasson who was playing later that season when Scotland secured the first Scottish victory when playing against the Welsh; the result was 3-1. The best season in the club was recorded in 1908-1909 when the first XI was unbeaten and six of the squad were chosen to represent Scotland. It was around this time that toy rabbits first appeared in the team photos presumably as mascots of the club. Like most sports the First World War halted hockey matches although the club was re- established for the 1919-1920 season. The remarkable growth in the Sport meant that in the following season five teams were fielded for the University. The club suffered a dry spell for victories until 1930-1931 when the competition for places on the teams was so great that an inter-society matches were organised. This successful season saw the first touring side to go down to English Universities and victories were recorded against both Durham and Manchester. It is also in this season that the Scottish Inter University Championship was first recorded which Edinburgh won which was followed the next season with the first successful tour to Ireland. This successful vein continued with the Scottish Championships residing with Edinburgh University until the 1938-1939 season, the last before the Second World War. There was no shortage of matches to be found during the war this time with 20 matches recorded each season. It is the 1942-1943 season which saw the first incarnation of the Scottish university teams play the United Services with no less than six Edinburgh men in the team. Much of the success gained by the team was attributed to the brilliant E.Evans Anfom as club captain. In the history up to 1959 the club recorded a total of 32 full internationalists and one (S.P Theobald) who represented Great Britain and between these players they recorded 183 international caps.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1975 as the Lucinda Cady House. The house is named for Lucinda Cady and her daughter Mary Lee who both owned the house.  History  Henry and Lucinda Cady moved to Takoma Park from Ashland, Virginia in 1886. Henry Cady was a real estate and insurance salesman. He sold properties largely in Takoma Park and South Brookland from his office at 520-10th Street, N.W. in Washington. At the time the area had 16 homes and about 100 people. They hired Washington architect Leon Dessez to design their new home. He had previously worked on the Washington Monument and designed the Admiral's House, now known as Number One Observatory Circle, the official residence of the Vice-President of the United States. Frederick Dudley built the house, which was completed in 1887. Other large homes joined the Cady's along what was known as Magnolia Street, now Eastern Avenue. The Cady's moved into their new home with their five children. They hosted services of the Episcopal Church in their home. Together with other Episcopalians in the area they organized Takoma Parish, now Trinity Episcopal Church. They held a concert at their home to help raise the funds for the new church, which was completed in 1893. Lucinda headed the Ladies Guild at the church for 16 years. Henry Cady died in 1906 and Lucinda remained in the house until her death in 1934. Her daughter Mary, who was a school teacher, inherited the home and she and her husband B.K. Lee had electricity and indoor plumbing installed. The house became known as Cady-Lee at the time. Mary had little money in later years to update the house and created an apartment for herself on the main floor of the house after her husband's death. She invited relatives to move into the rooms on the upper floors. Mary Lee died in 1973. By this time the other large homes along Eastern Avenue were torn down and replaced by garden apartments. The Cady-Lee was also targeted for demolition. Members of the community rallied to save the home and it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 28, 1975. It was the beginning of creating the Takoma Park Historic District in both Maryland and the District of Columbia, which was added to the National Register in 1983. Gerald and Sandra Kurtinitis bought the house for $68,000 the same year. They started to renovate the Cady-Lee room by room. They sold the house in 2000 to Frances Phipps who specialized in house rescues. She also had the financial means to finish the project. She did not intend to live in the house herself and looked for a non-profit agency to take it over. The Forum for Youth Investment bought the house in 2002 and now uses it for their offices. The upper floors and lower-level house the Forum staff and equipment. The first floor provides meeting space for Forum events and other non-profits. Architecture The Cady-Lee was designed in the Shingle Style that was popular on the east coast of the United States in the 1880s. The three-story structure is asymmetrical in design and is built over a basement. It contains 22 rooms, has 50 windows, 12-foot ceilings, seven gables and turreted sleeping porch. The main fa√ßade is dominated by a tower-like bay on the northeast corner. On the second story the dormer and the gable ends are covered in scalloped shaped shingles. They extend down the house to form the porch and veranda roofs. The roofline is varied and reflects the Shingle Style. It consists of gables and cross gables that are topped by finials and two brick chimneys with corbelled chimney caps. The interior features carved oak moldings and a two-story oak staircase where a Tiffany-style stained glass window is located. It also houses six original fireplace mantels. The foyer on the first floor leads to a library with carved bookcases and a front parlor with an original cheery wood mantel and over-mantel. The dining room has a Chinese Chippendale style mantel. It also contains a decorative radiator that the Smithsonian Institution says is one of the few left of its kind. A kitchen, with a cast-iron wood-burning stove, and a morning room, with a hand painted mural of an English garden, are in the back of the first floor. The second floor contains five large rooms, of which one has a working fireplace, and a bath. The third floor contains six rooms, a kitchen and a bath.

The film is credited as 50th film of Kunchacko Boban Plot In a district court of Palakkad, Ananthan (Suresh Krishna) waits for a verdict regarding the heir of an isolated land. The lawyer informs Ananthan that the verdict was postponed. Ananthan threatens Ani (Kunchacko Boban) and his younger sister Aswathi (Samvrutha Sunil) as they, too, were competing for the land. Ani wants to find Hari, who was his cousin and childhood friend. Hari has been missing for seven years. He found his grandmother in tears most of the time and watching her, he decided that he must reach Hari somehow. For many years Ani has been searching for Hari. So when Ani recognizes Hari in a TV program featuring Punjab, he sets forth to Punjab with great expectations of finding Hari. In Punjab, he arrives in Mallu Street and finds Karthikeyan (Biju Menon) and Pappan (Manoj K Jayan). When they both came to know that Ani had come in search of Hari, they ask about the story of Hari. Then there is a flashback. In Kerala Hari (Unni Mukundan) wins a Kabbadi match and from then on all in the village were very fond of him. One day, Valiyampattu Raghavan Nair (Siddique), Ani's father and Hari's uncle was carrying on with his harvest festival. But then arrived Govindan Kutty (Sai Kumar) and Ananthan who had a grudge against Raghavan Nair's family. When Ananthan kicked the plate containing required items, Hari arrives at the spot. Govindan said that Raghavan Nair and Ani had come to seize property of Hari. When Hari ignored, Govindan Kutty warned Hari to be aware of Raghavan Nair as one day he will be kicked out. Hari decided to organise a new business in hope to earn some money but in vain. Ani decided to fix Hari's marriage with Aswathi in order to unite Hari and Raghavan Nair. Knowing this, Raghavan Nair slaps Ani for thinking a proposal for Aswathi with a jobless man. To get rid of burdens and humiliations Hari decides to leave the village for peace and promised a return after a long time. On his way he hears screaming of Raghavan Nair. When he was about to help him, Govindan Kutty and Ananthan accused Hari for killing own uncle for wealth. From then on Hari was never seen. On hearing the story, Karthi and Pappan decides to help him find Hari and resolve his issues in Kerala. Still they were sure that it might not be Hari they knew as he was an entire Sikh. One day he finds Hari who fought the Sardar students for flirting with his sisters. Keen on seeing him, Ani enthusiastically called Hari loudly expecting for something good. But he is Harinder Singh, he spots a beard and turban and his attire is purely Punjabi. Even in his behavior, Harinder Singh looks a typical Punjabi. Ani came to know that Hari is Mallu Singh. Ani wants to make sure about Hari's identity and so decides to stay there for a long period. However Karthi and Pappan helped Ani. Together, the three go in search of proof to make sure that 'Mallu Singh' is Hari. Somewhere along the line, Suseelan (Suraj Venjaramoodu) joins the threesome making the situation worse. Suseelan came to Punjab to start a hair cutting salon but on finding that no one in Punjab cuts hair, took up cycle repair as his occupation for survival. Ani tries all his luck to make Hari reveal the truth. He even brings Ashwathi to Punjab. Even after Harinder Singh's marriage gets fixed with Ashwathi, Hari refuses to admit that he is Hari. Disheartened, Ani says that he is not ready for the marriage and they plan to go back to Kerala. Hari comes to their room and tells them that the real Harinder Singh (Asif Ali) was killed in an accident because Hari slept while driving his truck. Since he took Harinder Singh's role in their family, he cannot live as Hari anymore. Harinder Singh's father hears this and says that Hari can live with them as their son but he has to go back to Kerala and settle his family problems. In Kerala, Ananthan plans the measurement of the land kept for verdict. A day pending for signature in court regarding land case, Ananthan confidently said his brothers that no one from Valiyampattu family would come to take back the land as Raghavan Nair got killed and Hari and Ani had also escaped. Then Hari, Ani, Karthi and Pappan comes to the spot and fights Ananthan and his brothers to get back their land and to avenge the death of Raghavan Nair. Once the things got settled, they move back to Punjab to get their brides married to them.

S2 help screen shot by David Strom of PC Week It also had features that allowed for easy visual connection between formulas and their dependencies - those features were later adopted by Lotus 1-2-3 and Microsoft Excel. S2 was developed almost concurrently with Lotus development of 1-2-3, and matched 1-2-3 feature for feature. The S2 program was used throughout IBM in 1980s and 1990s. In 1986 it caused a legal controversy within IBM because of then current look-and-feel lawsuits between Lotus and other companies, and most importantly because IBM was negotiating a high- profile deal with Lotus to market Lotus 1-2-3. According to a PC WEEK article of 1986\\"IBM has its own Lotus 1-2-3 competitor\\", David Strom, PC Week, 1986 and a subsequent one in 2009,25 years of PC Week the sole author of this program was a developer in Thomas Watson Research Center, Oleg Vishnepolsky. Vishnepolsky developed this program unaware of the brewing deal between IBM and Lotus, and distributed it within IBM community to close to 50,000 users by the time of the controversy. A copy of his program ended up with a reporter of PC Week, who published an article speculating that IBM and Lotus' deal may be coming apart. That article caused a consternation within IBM executive quarters and attorneys. IBM attorneys and executives in the end decided that the program does not violate the Lotus copyright. Given S2's wide adoption within IBM they decided not to withdraw it from use, and let Vishnepolsky to continue its development. Vishnepolsky however lost interest in further development of S2, moved to another project and later authored TCP/IP for OS/2 and IBM POS terminals. S2 spreadsheet got ported to OS/2 and AIX by other developers and remained in use through the 90s.

Usman Boie Kamara unsuccessfully sought the nomination of the SLPP for the 2012 presidential election, placing second behind former military ruler Julius Maada Bio, who won the SLPP nomination at the party's convention held on 31 July 2011 at the miatta hall in Freetown.http://www.thenewpeople.com/front-page/item/1214-usman-boie-kamara- is-still-slpp After he lost the SLPP nomination to Julius Maada, Usman Boie Kamara defected from the SLPP in June 2012 and joined the ruling APC. He was officially welcomed and given an APC membership card by President Ernest Bai Koroma himself. Usman Boie is a devout Muslim and a fluent speaker of his native Mandingo language. He is married and has three children. Early life and family background Alhaji Usman Boie Kamara was born and raised in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone to prominent Mandingo parents. Usman Boie grew up in the neighbourhood of Magazine Cut in the East End of Freetown.http://www.sierraexpressmedia.com/archives/36294http://www.sierraexpressmedia.com/archives/30478 Usman Boie was raised in a Mandingo family and he is a fluent speaker of the Mandingo language. Usman Boie's father Mohamed Boie Kamara was a wealthy businessman and a popular member of the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), serving as the treasurer of the party during the 1960s and 1970s.http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/printer_200518258.shtmlhttp://www.sierraexpressmedia.com/archives/19813 Mohamed Boie Kamara worked closely with other respected SLPP members including Albert Margai, Kande Bureh, Mohamed Sanusi Mustapha, and Alhaji A.B Tejan Jalloh to ensure the SLPP's victory in national and local elections across the country. As a young boy, Usman Boie traveled with his father to attend SLPP meetings, conventions and activities across Sierra Leone. When Prime Minister Albert Margai visited the Madingo Mosque in Freetown in 1965 for Friday prayer, it was Mohamed Boie Kamara who introduced him to the Muslim crowd. Education and career Usman Boie Kamara is a graduate of the Prince of Wales Secondary school in Freetown. He later won a scholarship to study at the Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine in London, England. After he successfully completed his master's degree in mining engineering and Mineral Production Management from Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, Usman Boie was employed by the government of Sierra Leone as a mining engineer in Kenema in 1972 under the Ministry of Mines and Mineral Resources.http://www.ubk2012.com/2010/12/usman-boie-kamara-%E2%80%93-sierra- leone%E2%80%99s-vision-to-a-brighter-future Boie Kamara quickly rose to Assistant Director of Mines, Deputy Director of Mines and finally, Director of Mines in 2008. Usman Boie was later appointed as general manager of the Sierra Leone National Diamond Mining Company (NDMC), spending three years in the position. Usman Boie's greatest achievement in the position was the development of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS), a scheme designed to distinguish and certify Sierra Leone's rough diamonds from blood diamonds. Usman also acted as a mining consultant to the United Kingdom, Botswana, Zambia and Lesotho. Political career Usman Boie Kamara unsuccessfully sought the nomination of the SLPP for the 2012 presidential election, placing second behind former military ruler Julius Maada Bio, who won the SLPP nomination at the party's convention held on 31 July 2011 at the miatta hall in Freetown. After losing the election to Julius Maada Bio on 31 July 2011, there were great division among SLPP supporters and within the SLPP party itself. Some SLPP officials, including the SLPP chairman of the Western Area branch Lansana Fadika, the party's young generation leader Blamoh Robert and regional Secretary Alpha Mohamed Alghali resigned from the party in protest at Bio's nomination. Some of Usman Boie's supporters called for him to leave the SLPP and form his own party to challenge President Ernest Bai Koroma. However, on 4 September 2011 Usman Boie delivered a speech in front of 15,000 of his supporters and senior members of the SLPP at the Attouga Stadium in Freetown.http://www.sierraexpressmedia.com/archives/17745 In his speech, he called for unity within the SLPP and gave his full support to Maada Bio ahead of the 2012 presidential election. Usman Boie stated that nothing would stop the SLPP from winning the 2012 elections and party members should be focused on how to win the 2012 elections.http://www.thenewpeople.com/front- page/item/1214-usman-boie-kamara-is-still- slpphttp://www.sierraexpressmedia.com/archives/29027 Osman Boie focused his speech on criticising President Koroma's government. In June 2012, Usman Boie Kamara surprisingly defected from the SLPP and joined the ruling APC. He was officially welcomed and given an APC membership card by President Koroma himself. In January 2013, Usman Boie Kamara was chosen by President Koroma to serve as Minister of Trade and Industry in his new second term cabinet. He was approved by the Sierra Leone House of Parliament on 15 January 2013http://en.starafrica.com/news/sleone-mps-give-nod-to-12-govt- appointees.html and was sworn in as Minister of Trade and Industry on 16 January 2013 at State House in Freetown.

Structural inequality occurs when the fabric of organizations, institutions, governments or social networks contains an embedded bias which provides advantages for some members and marginalizes or produces disadvantages for other members. This can involve property rights, status, or unequal access to health care, housing, education and other physical or financial resources or opportunities. Structural inequality is believed to be an embedded part of the culture of the United States due to the history of slavery and the subsequent suppression of equal civil rights of minority races. Structural inequality has been encouraged and maintained in the society of the United States through structured institutions such as the public school system with the goal of maintaining the existing structure of wealth, employment opportunities, and social standing of the races by keeping minority students from high academic achievement in high school and college as well as in the workforce of the country. In the attempt to equalize allocation of state funding, policymakers evaluate the elements of disparity to determine an equalization of funding throughout school districts.p.(14) Policymakers have to determine a formula based on per-pupil revenue and the student need.p.(8) Critical race theory is part of the ongoing oppression of minorities in the public school system and the corporate workforce that limits academic and career success. The public school system maintains structural inequality through such practices as tracking of students, standardized assessment tests, and a teaching force that does not represent the diversity of the student body. Also see social inequality, racism, discrimination, and oppression. Social inequality occurs when certain groups in a society do not have equal social status. Aspects of social status involve property rights, voting rights, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, access to health care, and education as well as many other social commodities. Education: student tracking Education is the base for equality. Specifically in the structuring of schools, the concept of tracking is believed by some scholars to create a social disparity in providing students an equal education. Schools have been found to have a unique acculturative process that helps to pattern self-perceptions and world views. Schools not only provide education but also a setting for students to develop into adults, form future social status and roles, and maintain social and organizational structures of society. Tracking is an educational term that indicates where students will be placed during their secondary school years.[3] \\"Depending on how early students are separated into these tracks, determines the difficulty in changing from one track to another\\" (Grob, 2003, p. 202). Tracking or sorting categorizes students into different groups based on standardized test scores. These groups or tracks are vocational, general, and academic. Students are sorted into groups that will determine educational and vocational outcomes for the future. The sorting that occurs in the educational system parallels the hierarchical social and economic structures in society. Thus, students are viewed and treated differently according to their individual track. Each track has a designed curriculum that is meant to fit the unique educational and social needs of each sorted group. Consequently, the information taught as well as the expectations of the teachers differ based on the track resulting in the creation of dissimilar classroom cultures. Access to college Not only the classes that students take, but the school they are enrolled in has been shown to have an effect on their educational success and social mobility, especially ability to graduate from college. Simply being enrolled in a school with less access to resources, or in an area with a high concentration of racial minorities, makes one much less likely to gain access to prestigious four-year colleges. For example, there are far fewer first time freshmen within the University of California (UC) system who graduate from schools where the majority population is an underrepresented racial minority group. Students from these schools comprise only 22.1% of the first time freshmen within the UC system, whereas students from majority white schools make up 65.3% of the first time freshman population. At more prestigious schools, like UC Berkeley, the division is even more pronounced. Only 15.2% of first time freshmen who attend the university came from schools with a high percentage of underrepresented minorities. Issues of structural inequality are probably also at fault for the low numbers of students from underserved backgrounds graduating from college. Out of the entire population of low-income youth in the US, only 13% receive a bachelor's degree by the time they are 28. Students from racial minorities are similarly disadvantaged. Hispanic students are half as likely to attend college than white students and black students are 25% less likely. Despite increased attention and educational reform, this gap has increased in the past 30 years. The costs required to attend college also contribute to the structural inequality in education. The higher educational system in the United States relies on public funding to support the universities. However, even with the public funding, policymakers have voiced their desire to have universities become less dependent on government funding and to compete for other sources of funding. The result of this could sway many students from low-income backgrounds from attending higher institutions due to the inability of paying to attend. In a 2013 study by the National Center for Educational Statistics, only 49% of students from low-income families that graduated from high school immediately enrolled into college.Kena, G., Musu-Gillette, L., Robinson, J., Wang, X., Rathbun, A., Zhang, J., Wilkinson-Flicker, S., Barmer, A., and Dunlop Velez, E. (2015). The Condition of Education 2015 (NCES 2015-144). U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics. Washington, DC. Retrieved November 16, 2016 from http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/ In comparison, students from high-income families had an 80%immediate college enrollment rate. Furthermore, in another 2013 report, over 58% of low-income families were minorities. In the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supported survey, researchers discovered that 6 in 10 students that dropped out was due to the inability to pay for the cost of attending themselves and without help from their families.Johnson, J. & Rochkind, J., with Ott, A., & Dupont, S. (2009) ‚ÄúWith Their Whole Loves Ahead of Them.‚Äù Public Agenda, Prepared with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Retrieved at: http://www.publicagenda.org/files/theirwholelivesaheadofthem.pdf Access to technology Gaps in the availability of technology, the digital divide, are gradually decreasing as more people purchase home computers and the ratio of students to computers within schools continues to decreases. However, inequities in access to technology still exist due to the lack of teacher training and, subsequently, confidence in use of technologic tools; the diverse needs of students; and administrative pressures to increase test scores. These inequities are noticeably different between high need (HN) and low need (LN) populations. In a survey of teachers participating in an e-Learning for Educators online professional development workshop, Chapman finds that HN schools need increased access and teacher training in technology resources. Though results vary in their level of significance, teachers of non-HN schools report more confidence in having adequate technical abilities to simply participate in the workshop; later surveys showed that teachers of HN schools report that \\"they use, or will use, technology in the classroom more after the workshop\\" less likely that that of teachers of non-HN schools. Additionally, teachers from HN schools report less access to technology as well as lower technical skills and abilities (p. 246). Even when teachers in low-SES schools had confidence in their technical skills, other they faced other obstacles, including larger numbers of English language learners and at- risk students, larger numbers of students with limited computer experience, and greater pressure to increase test scores and adhere to policy mandates. Other structural inequalities in access to technology exist in differences in the ratio of students to computers within public schools. Correlations show that as the number of minorities enrolled in a school increase so, too, does the ratio of students to computers, 4.0:1 in schools with 50% or more minority enrollment versus 3.1 in schools with 6% or less minority enrollment (as cited in Warschauer, 2010, p. 188-189). Within school structures, low-socioeconomic status (SES) schools tended to have less stable teaching staff, administrative staff, and IT support staff, which contributed to teachers being less likely to incorporate technology in their curriculum for lack of support. Disabilities The challenge of the new millennium will include a realignment in focus to include \\"the curriculum as disabled, rather than students, their insights in translating principles of universal design, which originated in architecture, to education commensurate with advances characterized as a major paradigm shift.\\" According to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), children with disabilities have the right to a free appropriate public education in the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE). The LRE means that children with disabilities must be educated in regular classrooms with their non-disabled peers with the appropriate supports and services. An individual with a disability is also protected under American with Disabilities Act (ADA) which is defined as any person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Assistive technology which supports individuals with disabilities covering a wide range of areas from cognitive to physical limitations, plays an important role. School finance School finance is another area where social injustice and inequality might exist. Districts in wealthier areas typically receive more Average Daily Attendance (ADA) funds for total (e.g. restricted and unrestricted) expenditures per pupil than socio-economically disadvantaged districts, therefore, a wealthier school district will receive more funding than a socio-economically disadvantaged school district. \\"Most U.S. schools are underfunded. Schools in low wealth states and districts are especially hard hit, with inadequate instructional materials, little technology, unsafe buildings, and less-qualified teachers\\" (p. 31) The method in which funds are distributed or allocated within a school district can also be of concern. De facto segregation can occur in districts or educational organizations that passively promote racial segregation. Epstein (2006) stated the \\"Two years after the victorious Supreme Court decision against segregation, Oakland's\\"... \\"school board increased Oakland's segregation by spending $40 million from a bond election to build...\\" a \\"... High School, and then establishing a ten-mile long, two-mile wide attendance boundary, which effectively excluded almost every black and Latino student in the city\\" (p. 28). History of state funding in U.S education Since the early 19th Century policymakers have developed a plethora of educational programs, each which its own particular structural inequality. The mechanisms involved in the allocation of state funding have changed significantly over time. In the past, public schools were primarily funded by property taxes. Funding was supplemented by other state sources. In the early 19th century, policymakers recognized districts relying on property tax could lead to significant disparities in the amount of funding per student. Thus, policymakers began to analyze the elements of disparity and sought means to address it, numbers of teachers, quality of facilities and materials. To address disparity some states implemented Flat Grants, which typically allocate funding based on the number of teachers. However, this often magnified the disparity, since wealthy communities would have fewer students per teacher. In their attempt to reduce disparity policymakers in 1920 designed what they call the Foundation Program. The stated purpose was to equalize per-pupil revenue across districts. The goal was achieved by setting a target per-pupil revenue level, and the state supplying funding to equalize revenue in underserved districts. Some analyst characterized the program as a hoax because its structure allowed wealthier districts to exceed the target per-pupil revenue level. Also in order to aid persons with categories of issues, policymakers designed Categorical Programs. The purpose of these programs are to target disparity in poor districts, which do not take into account district wealth. Overtime, policymakers began to allocate funding that takes into consideration pupil needs along with the wealth of the district. Healthcare An identified inequality that negatively affects health and wellness among minority races is highly correlated with income, wealth, social capital, and, indirectly, education. Researchers have been able to identify significant gaps that exist in mortality rates of African Americans and Caucasian Americans. There has not been significant changes in the major factors of income, wealth, social capital/psycho-social environment, and socioeconomic status, that positively impact the existing inequality. Studies have noted significant correlations between these factors and major health issues. For example, poor socioeconomic status is strongly correlated with cardiovascular disease.  Social inequalities  When discussing the issue of structural inequality we must also consider how hegemonic social structures can support institutional and technological inequalities. In the realm of education studies have suggested that the level of educational attainment for a parent will influence the levels of educational attainment for said parents child. The level of education which one receives also tends to be correlated with social capital, income, and criminal activity as well. These findings suggest that by simply being the child of someone who is well educated places the child in an advantageous position. This in turn means that the children of new migrants and other groups who have historically been less educated and have significantly less resources at their disposal will be less likely to achieve higher levels of education. Because education plays a role in income, social capital, criminal activity and even the educational attainment of others it becomes possible that a positive feedback loop where the lack of education will perpetuate itself throughout a social class or group. The outcomes can be highly problematic at the K-12 level as well. Looking back to school funding we see that when the majority of funding has to come from local school districts and this leads to poorer districts being less adequately funded than wealthier districts. This means that the children who attend these schools which will struggle to provide a quality education with fewer students per teacher, less access to technology and tend to be unable to prepare students for selecting and attending college or university. When these students who were unprepared to attend higher education fail to do so they are less likely to encourage their own children to pursue higher education and more likely to be poorer. Then these individuals will live in traditionally poorer neighborhoods, thus sending their children to underfunded schools ill-prepared to gear students towards higher education and further perpetuate a cycle of poor districts and disadvantaged social groups. Historical The structural inequality of tracking in the educational system is the foundation of the inequalities instituted in other social and organizational structures. Tracking is a term in the educational vernacular that determines where students will be placed during their secondary school years. Traditionally, the most tracked subjects are math and English. Students are categorized into different groups based on their standardized test scores. Tracking is justified by the following four assumptions: # Students learn better in an academically equal group. # Positive self-attitudes are developed in homogenous groups, especially for slower students that do not have a high rate of ability differences. # Fair and accurate group placement is appropriate for future learning based on individual past performance and ability. # Homogenous groups ease the teaching process. Race, ethnicity, and socio-economic class limits exposure to advanced academic knowledge thus limiting advanced educational opportunities. A disproportionate number of minority students are placed in low track courses. The content of low track courses are markedly different. Low and average track students typically have limited exposure to \\"high-status\\" academic material, thus, the possibility of academic achievement and subsequent success is significantly limited. The tracking phenomenon in schools tends to perpetuate prejudices, misconceptions, and inequalities of the poor and minority people in society. Schools provide both an education and a setting for students to develop into adults, form future societal roles, and maintain social and organizational structures of society. Tracking in the public educational system parallels the hierarchical social and economic structures in society. Schools have a unique acculturative process that helps to pattern self-perceptions and world views. The expectations of the teachers and information taught differ based on tracks. Thus, dissimilar classroom cultures, different dissemination of knowledge, and unequal education opportunities are created. The cycle of academic tracking and oppression of minority races is dependent on the use of standardized testing. IQ tests are frequently the foundation that determines an individual's group placement. However, accuracy of IQ tests has been found by research to be flawed. Tests, by design, only indicate a student's placement along a high to low continuum and not their actual achievement. The tests have also been found to be culturally biased, therefore, language and experience differences affects test outcomes with lower-class and minority children consistently having lower scores. This leads to inaccurate judgements of students' abilities. Standardized tests were developed by eugenicists to determine who would best fill societal roles and professions. Tests were originally designed to verify the intellectuals of British society. This original intent unconsciously began the sorting dynamic. Tests were used to assist societies to fill important roles. In America, standardized tests were designed to sort students based on responses to test questions that were and are racially biased. These tests do not factor in the experiential and cultural knowledge or general ability of the students. Students are placed in vocational, general, or academic tracks based on test scores. Students' futures are determined by tracks and they are viewed and treated differently according to their individual track. Tracks are hierarchical in nature and create, consciously for some and unconsciously for others, the damaging effects of labeling students as fast or slow; bright or special education; average or below average. Corporate America has an interest in maintaining the use of standardized tests in public school systems thus protecting their potential future workforce that will be derived from the high-tracked, successful high income students by eliminating, through poor academic achievement, a disproportionate number of minority students. Also, standardized testing is big business. Although it is often argued that standardized testing is an economical method to evaluate students, the real cost is staggering, estimated at $20 billion annually in indirect and direct costs, an amount that does not factor in the social and emotional costs. Standardized tests remain a frequently used and expected evaluative method for a variety of reasons. The American culture is interested in intelligence and potential. Standardized testing also provides an economic advantage to some stakeholders, such as prestigious universities, that use standardized test numbers as part of their marketing plan. Finally, standardized testing maintains the status quo of the established social system. Teacher and counselor judgements have been shown to be just as inaccurate as standardized tests. Teachers and counselors may have a large number of students for which they are responsible for analyzing and making recommendations. Research has found that factors such as appearance, language, behavior, grooming, as well as academic potential, are all considered in the analysis and decision on group placement. This leads to a disproportionate number of lower and minority children placed unfairly into lower track groups. Teacher diversity is limited by policies that create often-unattainable requirements for bilingual instructors. For example, bilingual instructors may be unable to pass basic educational skills tests because of the inability to write rapidly enough to complete the essay portions of the tests. Limiting resources, in the form of providing primarily English speaking teachers, for bilingual or English as a second language student, limits the learning simply by restricting dissemination of knowledge. Restructuring the educational system, as well as, encouraging prospective bilingual teachers are two of the ways to ensure diversity among the teaching workforce, increase the distribution of knowledge, and increase the potential and continued academic success of minority students. Possible solutions to tracking and standardized testing: *Legal action against standardized test based on discrimination against poor and minority students based on precedent set in the state of Massachusetts. *Curricula designed as age, culture, and language appropriate. *Recruit and train a diverse and highly skilled, culturally competent teaching force. *Elimination of norm-referenced testing. *Community constructed and culture appropriate assessment tests.. *Explore critical race theory within the educational system to identify how race and racism is a part of the structural inequality of the public school system. *Create alternative teacher education certification programs that allow teachers to work while earning credentials.

Inclusive States: Social Policy and Structural Inequalities. Washington, D.C: World Bank, 2008. 3. As opposed to cultural inequality, which focuses on the individual decisions associated with these imbalances, structural inequality refers specifically to the inequalities that are systemically rooted in the normal operations of dominant social institutions, and can be divided into categories like residential segregation or healthcare, employment and educational discrimination.Royce, Edward Cary. Poverty and Power: the Problem of Structural Inequality. Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2009. 217. Globalization has a complex association with development and inequality, and mandates a new framework to help describe its effects. On one level, global competition in production can lead to productivity improvements that lead to a situation where industrial employment falls behind industrial output in a local market.Combating Poverty and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy.

This can have an enormous impact on developing economies that focus on industrialization. At the same time, the liberalization of trade policies may be the only method of securing growth for land-locked developing nations.Collier, Paul. 2007. The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries are Failing and What Can Be Done About It. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press. Combating structural inequality therefore often requires the broad, policy based structural change on behalf of government organizations, and is often a critical component of poverty reduction. In many ways, a well- organized democratic government that can effectively combine moderate growth with redistributive policies stands the best chance of combating structural inequality. Education One particularly influential form of structural inequality can be found in education, since education affects many other opportunities. Examples of institutionalized education-related racism include student tracking, access to college, access to technology, and school finance. Spatial/regional Globally, the problem of spatial and regional segregation is largely a question between urban and rural disparities. A study commissioned by the United Nations University WIDER project has shown that for the twenty-six countries included in the study, spatial inequalities have been high and on the increase, especially for developing nations. Many of these inequalities were traced back to ‚Äúsecond nature‚Äù geographic forces that describe the infrastructure a society has in place for facilitating the trade of goods and employment between economic agents. Another dominant and related factor is the ease of access to bodies of water and forms of long distance trade like ports. The discrepancies between the growth of communities close to these bodies of water and those further away have been noted in cases between and within countries. In the United States and many other developed countries, spatial inequality has developed into more specific forms described by residential segregation and housing discrimination. This has especially come into focus as education and employment are often tied into where a household is located relative to urban centers, and a variety of metrics, from education levels to welfare benefits have been correlated to spatial data.Adelman, Robert M., and Charles Jaret. \\"Poverty, Race, and US Metropolitan Social and Economic Structure.\\" Journal of Urban Affairs 21.1 (1999): Print. =Consequences= Specifically, studies have identified a number of economic consequences of housing segregation. Perhaps the most obvious is the isolation of minorities, which creates a deficit in the potential for developing human capital. Second, many of the public schools that areas of low socioeconomic status have access to are underperforming, in part due to the limited budgeting the district receives from the limited tax base in the same area. Finally, another large factor is simply the wealth and security homeownership represents. Property values rarely increase in areas where poverty is high in the first place.Massey, Douglas S. 2004. ‚ÄúThe New Geography of Inequality in Urban America,‚Äú in C. Michael Henry, ed. Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy. New Haven: Yale University Press. =Causes= The causes of spatial inequality, however, are more complex. The mid-20th century phenomenon of the large-scale migration of white middle-class families from urban centers has coined the term white flight. While the current state of housing discrimination can be partly attributed to this phenomenon, a larger set of institutionalized discrimination, like bias in loan and real estate industries and government policies, have helped to perpetuate the division created since then. These include bias found in the banking and real estate industries as well as discriminatory public policies that promote racial segregation.Massey 2004, p. 177. In addition, rising income inequality between blacks and whites since the 1970s have created affluent neighborhoods that tend to be composed of a homogeneous racial background of families within the same income bracket.Massey 2004, p. 184. A similar situation within the racial lines have helped to explain how more than 32% of blacks now live in suburbs. However, these new suburbs are often divided along racial lines, and a 1992 survey showed that 82% of blacks preferred to live a suburb where their race is in the majority.Cashin, Sheryll. \\"Middle-Class Black Suburbs and the State of Integration: A Post-Integrationist Vision for Metropolitan America.\\" (2001): 737. This is further aggravated by practices like racial steering, in which realtors guide home buyers towards neighborhood based on race. =Transportation= Government policies that have tended to promote spatial inequalities include actions by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) in the United States in promoting redlining, a practice where mortgages could be selectively administered while excluding certain urban neighborhood deemed risky, oftentimes because of race. Practices like this continued to prevent home buyers from getting mortgages in redlined areas until the 1960s, when the FHA discontinued the determination of restrictions based on racial composition.Wilson, William J. More than Just Race: Being Black and Poor in the Inner City. New York: Norton &, 2009. 28. The advent of freeways also added a complex layer of incentives and barriers which helped to increase spatial inequalities. First, these new networks allowed for middle-class families to move out to the suburbs while retaining connections like employment to the urban center. Second, and perhaps more importantly, freeways were routed through minority neighborhoods, oftentimes creating barriers between these neighborhoods and central business districts and middle class areas. Highway plans often avoided a more direct route through upper or middle class neighbors because minorities did not have sufficient power to prevent such actions from happening.Wilson 2009, p. 29. =Solutions= Massey identifies three goals specifically for the United States to end residential segregation: reorganize the structure of metropolitan government, make greater investment in education, and finally open housing market so full participation More specifically, he advocates broader, metropolitan-wide units of taxation and governance where the tax base and decisions are made equally by both the urban and suburban population. Education is the key to closing employment inequalities in a post-manufacturing era. And finally, the federal government must take large strides towards enforcing the anti-segregation measures related to housing it has already put into place, like the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Community Reinvestment Act. Another set of divisions that may be useful in framing policy solutions include three categories: place-based policies, people-based policies, and indirect approaches. Place-based policies include improving community facilities and services like schools and public safety in inner-city areas in an effort to appeal to middle-class families. These programs must be balanced with concerns of gentrification. People-based policies help increase access to credit for low-income families looking to move, and this sort of policy has been typified by the Community Reinvestment Act and its many revisions throughout its legislative history. Finally, indirect approaches often involve providing better transportation options to low-income areas, like public transit routes or subsidized car ownership. These approaches target the consequences rather than the causes of segregation, and rely on the assumption that one of the most harmful effects of spatial inequality is the lack of access to employment opportunities. In conclusion, a common feature in all of these is the investment in the capital and infrastructure of inner-city or neighborhood.‚ÄúRacial Residential Segregation in American Cities,‚Äù in Oxford Handbook of Urban Economics and Planning, ed.

Health disparities, which are largely caused by unequal access to healthcare, can be defined as ‚Äúa difference in which disadvantaged social groups such as the poor, racial/ethnic minorities, women and other groups who have persistently experienced social disadvantage or discrimination systematically experience worse health or greater health risks than most advantaged social groups.‚Äù Kronenfeld, Jennie J., ed. The Impact of Demographics on Health and Health Care: Race, Ethnicity and Other Social Factors. Bingley, UK: Emerald Group Limited, 2010. Print. Manifestations of inequality in healthcare appear throughout the world and are a topic of urgency in the United States. In fact, studies have shown that income-related inequality in healthcare expenditures favors the wealthy to a greater degree in the United States than most other Western nations.Chen, Alex Y., and Jos√© J. Escarce. \\"Quantifying Income- Related Inequality in Healthcare Delivery in the United States.\\" Medical Care 42.1 (2004): 38-47. JSTOR. Web. 2 Nov. 2011. The enormous costs of healthcare, coupled with the vast number of Americans lacking health insurance, indicate the severe inequality and serious problems that exist. The healthcare system in the United States perpetuates inequality by ‚Äúrationing health care according to a person‚Äôs ability to pay, by providing inadequate and inferior health care to poor people and persons of color, and by failing to establish structures that can meet the health needs of Americans‚Äù.Aguirre Jr., Adalberto, and David V. Baker. Structured Inequality in the United States: Critical Discussions on the Continuing Significance of Race, Ethnicity, and Gender. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008. Print. =Racial= Racial disparity in access and quality of healthcare is a serious problem in the United States and is reflected by evidence such as the fact that African American life expectancies lag behind that of whites by over 5 years, and African Americans tend to experience more chronic conditions. African Americans have a 30% higher death rate from cardiovascular disease and experience 50% more diabetic complications than their white counterparts. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), directed by Congress, led an effort for the development of two annual reports by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the National Healthcare Quality Report and the National Healthcare Disparities Report, which tracked disparities in healthcare in relation to racial and socioeconomic factors. These reports developed about 140 measures of quality of care and about 100 measures of access to care, which were used to measure the healthcare disparities. The first reports, released in December 2003, found that blacks and Hispanics experienced poorer healthcare quality for about half of the quality measures reported in the NHQR and NDHR. Also, Hispanics and Asians experienced poorer access to care for about two thirds of the healthcare access measures. Recent studies on Medicare patients show that black patients receive poorer medical care than their white counterparts. Compared with white patients, blacks receive far fewer operations, tests, medications and other treatments, suffering greater illnesses and more deaths as a result.Aguirre and Baker Measures done by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) show that ‚Äúfewer than 20% of disparities faced by Blacks, AI/ANs and Hispanics showed evidence of narrowing.‚Äù One specific study showed that African Americans are less likely than whites to be referred for cardiac catheterization and bypass grafting, prescription of analgesia for pain control, and surgical treatment of lung cancer. Both African Americans and Latinos also receive less pain medication than whites for long bone fractures and cancer. Other studies showed that African Americans are reported to receive fewer pediatric prescriptions, poorer quality of hospital care, fewer hospital admissions for chest pain, lower quality of prenatal care, and less appropriate management of congestive heart failure and pneumonia.Wiliams, Richard A., ed. Eliminating Healthcare Disparities in America. Totowa, NJ: Humana, 2007. Print. Language-barriers became a large factor in the process of seeking healthcare due to the rise in minorities across the United States. In 2007, an estimate done by the Census Bureau stated that 33.6% of the United States belonged to racial ethnicities that were non-Hispanic whites. Of people within the United States during this time, 20% spoke a language different from English at home. Having a language-barrier can cause many hurdles when pertaining to healthcare: difficulty communicating with health professionals, sourcing/the funding of language assistance, having little to no access to translators, etc. A 2050 projection showed that over 50% of the United States would belong to a racial category other than non-Hispanic white. Thus, demonstrating the rapid increase of minorities over time within the United States and the importance of it. =Gender= In addition to race, healthcare inequality also manifests across gender lines. Though women tend to live longer than men, they tend to report poorer health status, more disabilities as they age, and tend to be higher utilizers of the healthcare system.Bayne- Smith, Marcia, ed. Race, Gender, and Health. London: Sage Publications, 1996. Print. Healthcare disparities often put women at a disadvantage. Such time must be scheduled around work (whether formal or informal), child care needs, and the geography‚Äîwhich increases the travel time necessary for those who do not live near healthcare facilities. Furthermore, ‚Äúpoor women and their children tend to have inadequate housing, poor nutrition, poor sanitation, and high rates of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse.‚Äù Since women and children constitute 80% of the poor in the United States, they are particularly susceptible to experiencing the negative impact of healthcare inequality. =Spatial= Spatial distribution and geographic location also affect access and quality of healthcare. A study done by Rowland, Lyons, and Edwards (1988) found that rural patients were more likely to be poor and uninsured.Davis, Karen. \\"Inequality and Access to Health Care.\\" The Milbank Quarterly 69.2 (1991): 253-73. JSTOR. Web. 2 Nov. 2011. Because of the fewer healthcare resources available in rural areas, these patients received fewer medical services than urban patients.Davis 1991 Other studies showed that African Americans and Hispanics are more likely than whites to live in areas that are underserved by healthcare providers, forcing them to wait longer for care in crowded and/or understaffed facilities or traveling longer distances to receive care in other areas. This travel time often poses an obstacle to receiving medical care and often leads patients to delay care until later. In fact, African Americans and Hispanics are more likely than whites to delay seeking medical care until their condition becomes serious, rather than seeking regular medical care, because travel and wait times are both costly and an interference in other daily activities. An individual's environment greatly impacts his or her health status. For example, three of the five largest landfills in the United States are situated in communities which are predominantly African American and Latino, contributing to some of the highest pediatric asthma rates in those groups. Impoverished individuals who find themselves unable to leave their neighborhoods consequently are continuously exposed to the same harmful environment, which negatively impacts health. =Economic= Socioeconomic background is another source of inequality in healthcare. Poverty significantly influences the production of disease since poverty increases the likelihood of having poor health in addition to decreasing the ability to afford preventative and routine healthcare. Lack of access to healthcare has a significant negative impact on patients, especially those who are uninsured, since they are less likely to have a regular source of care, such as a primary care physician, and are more likely to delay seeking care until their condition becomes life-threatening. Studies show that people with health insurance receive significantly more care than those who are uninsured, the most vulnerable groups being minorities, young adults, and low-income individuals. The same trend for uninsured versus insured patients holds true for children as well. Hadley, Steinberg, and Feder (1991) found that hospitalized patients who are not covered under health insurance are less likely to receive high-cost, specialized procedures and as a result, are more likely to die while hospitalized. Feder, Hadley, and Mullner (1984) noticed that hospitals often ration free care by denying care to those who are unable to pay and cutting services commonly used by the uninsured poor. Minorities are less likely to have health insurance because are less likely to occupy middle to upper income brackets, and therefore are incapable of purchasing health insurance, and also because they tend to hold low-paying jobs that do not provide health insurance as part of their job-related benefits. Census data show that 78.7% of whites are covered by private insurance compared with 54% of blacks and 51% of Hispanics. About 29% of Hispanics in the United States have neither private nor government health insurance of any kind. A study done on Medicare recipients also showed that despite the uniform benefits offered, high-income elderly patients received 60% more physician services and 45% more days of hospital care than lower-income elderly patients not covered by Medicaid. After adjustment for health status, people with higher incomes are shown to have higher expenditures, indicating that the wealthy are strongly favored in income-related inequality in medical care. However, this inequality differs across age groups. Inequality was shown to be greatest for senior citizens, then adults, and least for children. This pattern showed that financial resources and other associated attributes, such as educational attainment, were very influential in access and utilization of medical care.Chen and Escarce, 2004. =Solutions= The acknowledgement that access to health services differed depending on race, geographic location, and socioeconomic background was an impetus in establishing health policies to benefit these vulnerable groups. In 1965, specific programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, were implemented in the United States in an attempt to extend health insurance to a greater portion of the population. Medicare is a federally funded program that provides health insurance for people aged 65 or older, people younger than 65 with certain disabilities, and people of any age who have End-Stage Renal Disease (ERSD). Medicaid, on the other hand, provides health coverage to certain low income people and families and is largely state-governed.\\"Frequently Asked Questions About Medicare\\" Medicare.gov. 26 Aug. 2008. Web. 2 Nov. 2011. However, studies have shown that for-profit hospitals tend to make healthcare less accessible to uninsured patients in addition to those under Medicaid in an effort to contain costs. Another program, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) provides low cost health insurance to children in families who do not qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford private health insurance on their own.medicare.org The necessity of achieving equity in quality of and access to healthcare is glaring and urgent. According to Fein (1972), this goal could include equal health outcomes for all by income group, equal expenditures per capita across income groups, or eliminating income as a healthcare rationing device. Some have proposed that a national health insurance plan with comprehensive benefits and no deductibles or other costs from the patients would provide the most equity. Fein also stressed that healthcare reform was needed, specifically in eliminating financial assistance to treat patients that depended on patient income or the quantity of services given. He proposed instead paying physicians on a salaried basis. Another study, by Reynolds (1976), found that community health centers improved access to health care for many vulnerable groups, including youth, blacks, and people with serious diseases. The study indicated that community health centers provided more preventive care and greater continuity of care, though there were problems in obtaining adequate funding as well as adequate staffing. Engaging the community to understand the link between social issues such as employment, education, and poverty can help motivate community members to advocate for policies that improve health status. Increasing the racial and ethnic diversity of healthcare providers can also serve as a potential solution. Racial and ethnic minority healthcare providers are much more likely than their white counterparts to serve minority communities, which can have many positive effects. Advocating for an increase in minority healthcare providers can help improve the quality of patient-physician communication as well as reduce the crowding in understaffed facilities in areas in which minorities reside. This can help decrease wait times as well as increase the likelihood that such patients will seek out nearby healthcare facilities rather than traveling farther distances as a last resort. Implementing efforts to increase translation services can also improve quality of healthcare. This means increased availability of bilingual and bicultural healthcare providers for non-English speakers. Studies show that non-English speaking patients self- reported better physical functioning, psychological well-being, health perceptions, and lower pain when receiving treatment from a physician who spoke their language. Hispanic patients specifically reported increased compliance to treatment plans when their physician spoke Spanish and also shared a similar background. Training programs to improve and broaden physicians‚Äô communication skills can increase patient satisfaction, patient compliance, patient participation in treatment decisions, and utilization of preventative care services The idea of universal health care, which is implemented in many other countries, has been a subject of heated debate in the United States. Employment Employment is a key source of income for a majority of the world's population, and therefore is the most direct method through which people can escape poverty. However, unequal access to decent work and persistent labor market inequalities frustrate efforts to reduce poverty.UNRISD 2004, p. 31. Studies have further divided employment segregation into two categories: first generation and second generation discrimination. First generation discrimination occurs as an overt bias displayed by employers, and since the end of the civil rights era has been on the decline. Second generation discrimination; on the other hand, is less direct and therefore much harder to legislate against. This helps explain the disparity between female hiring rates and male/female ratios, which have gone up recently, and the relative scarcity of women in upper-level management positions.Sturm, Susan. \\"Second Generation Employment Discrimination: A Structural Approach.\\" Columbia Law Review 101.3 (2001): 497. Therefore, while there is extensive legislation passed regarding employment discrimination, informal barriers still exist in the workplace. For instance, gender discrimination often takes the form of working hours and childcare-related benefits.Aguirre and Baker 2008, p. 200. In many cases, female professionals who must take maternity leave or single mothers who must care for their children often are at a disadvantage when it comes to promotions and advancement. =Education level= Employment discrimination is also closely linked to education and skills. One of the most important factors that can help describe employment disparities was that for much of the post-WWII-era, many Western countries began shedding the manufacturing jobs that provided relatively high-wage jobs to people with moderate to low job skills.Adelman p. 38. Starting from the 1960s, the United States began a shift away from low- wage jobs, especially in the manufacturing sector, towards technology-based or service-based employment.Wilson 2009, p. 70. This had an unbalanced effect of decreasing employment opportunities for the least educated in the labor force while at the same time increasing the productivity and therefore wages of the skilled labor force, increasing the level of inequality.Marshall, F. Ray. Back to Shared Prosperity: the Growing Inequality of Wealth and Income in America. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 2000. Print. 6. In addition, globalization has tended to compound this decrease in demand of domestic unskilled labor. Finally, weak labor market policies since the 70's and 80's have failed to address the income inequalities that those who are employed at lower income levels have to face. Namely, the union movement began to shrink, decreasing the power for employees to negotiate employment terms, and the minimum wage was prevented from increasing alongside inflation.Wilson 2009, p. 15 =Racial= Other barriers include human capital occupations that require an extensive network for developing clientele, like lawyers, physicians, and salesmen. Studies have shown that for blacks and whites in the same occupation, whites can often benefit for a wealthier pool of clients and connections.Grodsky, Eric and Devah Pager. 2001. ‚ÄúThe Structure of Disadvantage: Individual and Occupational Determinants of the Black-White Wage Gap.‚Äù American Sociological Review:66(4):542-567. In addition, studies show that only a small percentage of low-skilled employees are hired through advertisements or cold calls, highlighting the importance of social connections with middle- and upper- class employers.Wilson 2009, p. 75. =Gender= Though women have become an increasing presence in the workforce, there currently exists a gender gap in earnings. Statistics show that women who work full-time year-round earn 75% of the income as their male counterparts.Jacobs, Jerry A. Gender Inequality at Work. London: Sage Publications, 1995. Print. 9. Part of the gender gap in employment earnings is due to women concentrating in different occupational fields than men, which is known as occupational segregation.Reese, Laura. Equity in the Workplace: Gendering Workplace Policy Analysis. Ed. Heidi Gottfried. New York: Lexington, 2004. Print. 152. The 1990 Census data show that more than 50% of women would have to change jobs before women would be distributed in the same way as men within the job market, achieving complete gender integration.Jacobs 1995, p. 9. This can be attributed to the tendency of women to choose degrees that funnel into jobs that are less lucrative than those chosen by men.Jacobs 1995, p. 5. Other studies have shown that the Hay system, which evaluates jobs, undervalues the occupations that tend to be filled by women, which continues to bias wages against women's work.Jacobs 1995, p. 10. Once a certain job becomes associated with women, its social value decreases. Almost all studies show that the percentage of women is correlated with lower earnings for both males and females even in fields that required significant job skills, which suggests a strong effect of gender composition on earnings.Jacobs 1995, p. 26. Additionally, women tend to be hired into less desirable jobs than men and are denied access to more skilled jobs or jobs that place them in an authoritative role. In general, women tend to hold fewer positions of power when compared to men. A study done by Reskin and Ross (1982) showed that when tenure and productivity-related measurements were controlled, women had less authority and earned less than men of equal standing in their occupation.Jacobs 1995, p. 11. Exclusionary practices provide the most valuable job openings and career opportunities for members of groups of higher status which, in the United States, mostly means Caucasian males. Therefore, males are afforded more advantages than females and perpetuate this cycle while they still hold more social power, allocating lower-skilled and lower-paying jobs to females and minorities.Jacobs 1995, p. 29. =Inequality in investment of skills= Another factor of the gender earnings gap is reflected in the difference in job skills between women and men. Studies suggest that women invest less in their own occupational training because they stay in the workforce for a shorter period of time than men (because of marriage or rearing children) and therefore have a shorter time span to benefit from their extra efforts.Jacobs 1995, p. 6. However, there is also discrimination by the employer. Studies have shown that the earnings gap is also due to employers investing less money in training female employees, which leads to a gender disparity in accessing career development opportunities.Jacobs 1995, p. 7. =Prescribed gender roles= Women tend to stay in the workforce for less time than men due to marriage or the time devoted to raising children. Consequently, men are typically viewed as the ‚Äúbreadwinners‚Äù of the family, which is reflected in the employee benefits provided in careers that are traditionally occupied by males. A study done by Heidi M. Berggren, assessing the employee benefits provided to nurses (a traditional female career) and automobile mechanics and repairmen (a traditional male career), found that the latter provided more significant benefits such as health insurance and other medical emergency benefits whereas the former provided more access to sick leave with full pay.Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 164. This outlines the roles allotted to women as the caregivers and the men as the providers of the family which subsequently encourages men to seek gainful employment while encouraging women to have a larger role at home than in the workplace. Many parental leave policies in the US are poorly developed and reinforce the roles of men as the breadwinner and women as the caregiver.Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 207. =Glass ceiling= Women have often described subtle gender barriers in career advancement, known as the glass ceiling. This refers to the limited mobility of women in the workforce due to social restrictions that limit their opportunities and affect their career decisions.Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 134. =Solutions= A study done by Doorne-Huiskes, den Dulk, and Schippers (1999) showed that in countries with government policy addressing the balance between work and family life, women have high participation in the work force and there is a smaller gender wage gap, indicating that such policy could encourage mothers to stay in their occupations while also encouraging men to take on a greater child-rearing role. Such measure include mandating employers to provide paid parental leave for employees so that both parents can care for children without risk to their careers. Another suggested measure is government- provided day care for children aged 0‚Äì6 or financial support for employees to pay for their own child-care.Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 184. In 1978, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was passed and amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This act designated discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth, or associated medical issues as illegal gender discrimination. The Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993, required employers to give up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and providing care for immediate family members who are ill. These two acts helped publicize the important role women play in caring for family members and gave women more opportunities to retain jobs that they would have previously lost. However, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 is limited in that only 60% of all employees in the U.S. are eligible for this leave since many small business are exempt from such coverage.Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 205. The fact that parental leave measures continue to enforce traditional division of labor between the genders indicates a need to reduce the stigma of male parenting as well as the stigma of parenthood on female employment opportunities. Some possible developments to improve parental leave include: offering job protection, full benefits, and substantial pay as a part of parental leave to heighten the social value of both parents caring for children, making parental leave more flexible so that both parents can take time off, reducing the negative impact of parental leave on job standing, and encouraging fathers to care for children by providing educational programs regarding pre-natal and post-natal care.Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 209.

Early history and training Maung Maung Gyi lost his mother in early childhood and so his father sent him to Yangon High School as a boarding student. There he exhibited an interest in drawing, but he was temperamental and one day quarreled with a teacher and quit school. He then decided to travel to England to study art. The events which followed, attributed to the year 1906, have become a part of Burmese folklore. He allegedly went to Rangoon harbor to find a ship which would carry him to England and asked the captain of one ship there for a job as a seaman. While talking to the captain he drew his portrait, and the captain was so taken with the youth‚Äôs portrait of him and his adventuresome spirit that he agreed to take him on board as a seaman. Maung Maung Gyi was about 16 years old at that time. Maung Maung Gyi reached England and studied there for two or three years. It is not known what school he attended, but his main studies seemed to have been agriculture, as well as art and chemistry. There is some possibility that during his time in England he may also have had to work as a dishwasher to make ends meet. It seems not to have been an institution of higher learning for when he returned to Burma, about 1908 or shortly thereafter, he continued with his secondary education at St. Paul‚Äôs English High School in Rangoon for two years. Following his studies at St. Paul‚Äôs, he became an agricultural officer for the colonial government, which offered him the chance to tour the country, painting its scenes in his free time. Personality and further imbroglios As a youth who had traveled to England in such a daring way, Maung Maung Gyi became famous in Burma, as a model to young Burmese youth who were so provincial and timid that they often feared leaving their villages. He became notorious in other respects. Although he developed a passion for Western-style painting, he had a great resentment of his colonial masters, especially British officers. In 1938, when a Burmese-Indian massacre or riot broke out in Mandalay, Maung Maung Gyi found himself a catalyst in the conflagration. The city of Mandalay was curfewed and two provocateurs, a Shwe Pe and Shwe Sin, were put on trial behind closed doors. Photographs of the accused were forbidden; however, Maung Maung managed to view the court proceedings accompanying a Burmese reporter and memorized the faces of the accused and then sent their portraits to the newspapers where they were printed. According to Nyan Shein, ‚Äúthe massacre spread through the whole of Burma‚Ä¶ Therefore the British had to curfew the whole country.‚Äù These events are difficult to corroborate, but Cady in his A History of Modern Burma mentions anti-Indian riots occurring throughout Burma in 1938. Another notorious incident involving Maung Maung Gyi is a quarrel that he had with one of his superior British officers in the agricultural department, alleging punching the man and subsequently quitting his job as an agricultural officer for good. This event may have occurred prior to the incidents of the Indian-Burmese riots above, attributed to the year 1938, for in the following year, 1939, when the State School of Art and Music opened up, he became an instructor there. This was a prestigious position. The principal of the school was San Win, and to other painters of note, Ba Kyi and Maung Maung Mya, were teachers at the school. Works Maung Maung Gyi is known to have owned a large collection of paintings, but whether these paintings were strictly his own works or included works which he had collected by other painters in Burma is not known. In any event, during World War II, his house burned down and his entire collection was lost. Not many works by Maung Maung Gyi have survived. Four of his watercolors are currently in the collection of the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford. A fifth painting appears on page 13 of Old Myanmar Paintings in the Collection of U Win (2006) by Hla Tin Htun, and it is said that the National Museum of Myanmar owns a painting or paintings by Maung Maung Gyi but if so, the work has not been on display in recent years. Influences and legacy Although Maung Maung Gyi is said to have studied art in England, his greater influences in painting may actually have come through exposure to British painters whom he personally encountered in Burma or whose works he saw there. In particular, one British painter who may have influenced him is B.H. Wiles, who published reproductions of his paintings of Burma in India and England. B.H. Wiles work has appeared in Christie‚Äôs auctions in recent years but with little biographical information about him beyond the fact that he was a 19th and 20th century painter. One account of Maung Maung Gyi‚Äôs life records that he was a companion painter of B.H. Wiles when Wiles painted in Burma. This account also maintains that Maung Maung Gyi‚Äôs paintings were marketed in Germany. Maung Maung Gyi‚Äôs work also shows irrefutable influence of Robert Talbot Kelly, the British painter who traveled throughout Burma in the early 1900s, producing a large tome of his collected scenes of Burma in his book Burma, Painted and Described (1905). One of the four paintings in the Pitt Rivers Museum collection done by Maung Maiung Gyi is an exact replica of a painting entitled Express Steamer Passing Sagaing on page 146 of Talbot Kelly‚Äôs book. This is not to suggest by any means that Maung Maung Gyi had a habit of copying works from other painters; rather, as many painters of both the Traditional and Western Schools did in Burma in the early days, he copied the works of painters he admired in order to learn. Maung Maung Gyi is said to have influenced and been influenced by the early artist of the Traditional School, Saya Aye. After returning from England, Maung Maung Gyi is said to have given Saya Aye instruction in Western painting in exchange for instruction in Traditional art. However, evidence of Traditional techniques hardly exists in Maung Maung Gyi‚Äôs work, and while Maung Maung Gyi may have left an influence on Saya Aye in his Western-style works, it is clear from a painting dated 1909 by Saya Aye, entitled Burmese Gentleman and Wife, now in the collection of the Fukuoka Asian Art Museum, that Saya Aye must have already made large steps on his own to learn Western techniques before meeting Maung Maung Gyi. Maung Maung Gyi‚Äôs influence in Burma was largely as a watercolor painter who traveled about Burma capturing its scenes in the plein air style. The plein air mode of painting later became very common among Upper Burma painters such as Saya Saung and Ba Thet in his early works. Death In his last years, Maung Maung Gyi acquired heart disease. He died in a small village in Upper Burma His son, Kin Maung (Yangon)‚Äînot to be confused with Kin Maung (Bank)‚Äîalso became a well-known painter in Burma.

Early history The Social Marketing Project was initiated in 1974 when AI.D./Washington, at the request of the Bangladesh Government (BDG), contracted for a two-year program to distribute non-clinical contraceptives throughout the country. A sole-source contract was awarded to Population Services International (PSI), which then signed an agreement with the BDG establishing the activity as a parasternal one, with a project council serving as the board of directors. The council was chaired by the secretary of Health and Family Planning and contained representatives of the government, the private sector, and the international non-profit sector. Products were introduced in late 1975. By the end of the following year, they had spread to all urban markets, and sales reached 4.9 million Raja condoms and about 250,000 cycles of Maya oral contraceptive pills. In 1979, the Joy brand foaming spermicidal tablet, donated by the Japanese, was introduced and sold about 3 million pieces. (Joy was discontinued in 1989 when the Japanese ceased supplying it and no other donor could be found. About 50 million tablets had been distributed.) In 1980, a second pill brand called Ovacon was introduced. Total sales for that year were 33.4 million Raja and over 600,000 pill cycles. In 1982, after the original contract with PSI had been renewed twice, USAID decided to change to a cooperative agreement, which now expires at the end of FY 1992 for family planning and FY 1994 for oral rehydration therapy (ORT). By 1983, the second brand of condoms (Panther) was introduced. Condom sales reached 76 million that year, with pills up to 1.7 million. PSI was asked to call in an outside agency to assist in producing a motivational campaign to promote the virtues of the small family, birth spacing, male responsibility, and the like, through mass media. This campaign was designed by Manoff International Inc. and ran for five years until an unexpected cut in USAID funding. During 1985, SMP introduced a third condom, the ultra-thin Majestic. Total condom sales passed the 100 million mark for the first time and pills the 2 million mark. ORSaline (a brand of oral rehydration salts) was introduced in the same year; initial annual sales of 120,000 have now grown to 10‚Äì12 million. By 1985, SMP employed almost 500 people, and its sales force was regarded as among the best in Bangladesh. In 1988, the BDG began trying to establish SMP as a total government program. Protracted negotiations with USAID ensued through 1989 and into 1990, and USAID funding was suspended from March through September 1989. All available resources during this period were devoted to distribution and sales, while the motivational campaign and brand advertising ceased. Sales during this period increased to their highest-ever levels. This is not unusual, because the adverse effects of suspension of advertising are rarely felt immediately. SMP condom sales peaked in 1989, at 119.3 million, and pill distribution was up 50 percent over the previous year, at 6 million. The Majestic brand condom was discontinued worldwide by ALD because of quality problems. High sales levels suggested that perhaps prices were too low. In addition, increasing emphasis was placed on greater cost recovery and financial sustainability for the project. There was also considerable concern about product wastage. Results from Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys (CPS) consistently indicated that less than 3 percent of couples used condoms for contraception, while sales of SMC products and BDG distribution figures indicated rates two to three times higher. Concern about the so-called \\"condom gap\\" peaked in the mid-1980s with several studies done to account for it. Although a number of contributing factors were identified, the matter is still an issue of some concern. In April 1990, after funding for local costs was withdrawn and SMC was suffering the effects of the long and difficult negotiations between USAID and the government, the consumer price of the Raja condom was raised by 65 percent and the prices of all other products by 50 percent. There was immediate market resistance. Condom sales fell to 73 million, with the popular Raja hardest hit. Pill sales stayed steady, not realizing the 15 percent increase expected. While revenues grew by $200,000, CYP (couple year of protection) was reduced by 400,000. The extent to which this decline in sales has affected the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR), however, is not known. As discussed above, there is a consistent discrepancy between sales and distribution figures and prevalence. This may be clarified when the 1991 CPS is completed. Following the USAID-BDG agreement, SMC was established as a private, non-profit company in 1990. Funding resumed, a new non-government board was constituted, and new management was hired. Products SMC markets a variety of non-clinical (oral pills- Femicon, Minicon, Nordette-28 & Femipil, and condoms ‚Äì Raja, HERO, Panther, Sensation & U&ME;) and clinical (Injectable \\"SOMA-JECT\\") contraceptives. The WHO-formula based packaged oral rehydration salt brand marketed by SMC is ORSaline-N. SMC extended its line of oral rehydration salt by introducing BNF ‚Äì based flavored ORS brand 'ORSaline Fruity' in August 2003. In May 2008, SMC introduced a small sachet of micronutrient powder, popularly known as 'Sprinkles\\", in the brand name of \\"MoniMix\\" to address childhood Iron deficiency anemia (IDA). It also started marketing Zinc dispersible tablets in September 2008 to reduce the severity of diarrhea in children under 5. As part of its maternal and neonatal health programme, SMC launched Safe Delivery Kit branded as \\"Safety Kit\\" in 2008 to ensure clean child delivery at a household level. =Condoms (brand)= { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Brand ! scope=\\"col\\"  Product ! scope=\\"col\\"  Launch - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Raja  Plain Latex condom  1974 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Sensation  Classic Chocolate Strawberry  1992 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Panther  Dotted latex condom  1983 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  U&ME;  Colors Long love Anatomic  2005 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Hero  Plain latex condom  2006 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Xtreme  3 in 1 Ultra Thin  2014 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Amore  Gold Black  2017 } Sales network More than 100 men-strong sales force of SMC distribute products to the far-flung stockist and retail outlets promptly and regularly.

The original hospital building is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The hospital was founded in 1755 following a bequest by Dr William Stratford, who had died two years earlier. It was funded by public subscriptions, and was free to patients who were recommended by the subscribers. It was originally housed in temporary accommodation in part of Bluecoat School. Construction of the permanent building was started in 1758, and was completed in 1761. It was designed by William Yoxall, and the interior was remodelled in 1830 by William Cole, junior. Over the years, extensions were built, and by 1902 the hospital had 118 beds. The appellation \\"Royal\\" was added in 1914 when George V opened the Albert Wood wing, which contained six new wards. This wing was designed by W. T. and P. H. Lockwood, as was a further extension in 1931. During the 1990s patients were transferred to new facilities provided by the Countess of Chester Hospital, and the infirmary closed. Other than the original building, all the later extensions were demolished in 1998. The original hospital building has been converted into apartments. Architecture The hospital is constructed in brown brick with stone dressings and has grey-green slate roofs. The entrance front faces City Walls Road. North and south wings stretch back to join an east wing to form a courtyard; these wings contained the wards. The entrance front has two storeys plus cellars; the wards have three storeys plus attics and basements. The entrance front is in seven bays. A porch projects from the centre of the ground floor. It has two Doric columns, and supports the middle three bays of the upper storey that form a canted projection. Above the porch is a floor band and a segmental pediment. Each bay of the upper storey contains a sash window, that in the middle bay having a round-headed arch painted with \\"ERECTED 1761\\". Above the windows is a frieze and a pedimented gable with a plaque inscribed \\"INFIRMARY\\". Elsewhere all the windows are sashes, or French windows leading to balconies that have been removed.

Into old age, he worked with unbroken creativity. In the years 1931 and 1932 his paintings were still on display at the art exhibitions of the Deutsches Museum in Munich.

She was charged with \\"criminal negligence causing death\\" and found not guilty. Background Harshbarger lived in Meshoppen, Pennsylvania with her husband Mark (married on June 23, 2001) and their two children. Shooting incident On September 14, 2006, Mary Beth, her husband Mark and their two young children, and Mark's brother Barry Harshbarger, were on a hunting trip outside of Buchans Junction, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The facts of the case state that Mary Beth was sitting in the back of a Chevy pickup truck with her children, armed with a rifle, on a logging road late in the day. She waited with her children while Mark and a local hunting guide walked through the nearby spruce woods in the hopes of flushing out a black bear. Barry was at a hunting blind elsewhere in the woods. Mark began to walk back toward the truck with the guide, the guide stopping to urinate in the woods. At this point Mark walked towards the van, ahead of the guide, in dark clothing without an orange hunting hat or vest to improve his visibility. At 7:55 pm (NT) as he emerged from the woods, Mary Beth told police that she saw a dark shape that she believed was a black bear, and fired using her rifle. What she shot was not a black bear however, but was instead her husband Mark. When he was shot, Mark Harshbarger was approximately 200 feet from the truck in which his wife Mary Beth and two children were seated. In recounting the incident to Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers at the lodge where they were staying immediately after the shooting, Mary Beth said she had looked through the scope twice to make sure what she was seeing really was a bear. She insisted that she had not seen the blue of Mark Harshbarger's pants, but instead seen the black of a bear. According to Dr. Nash Denic, the St. John's, Newfoundland pathologist who autopsied him, Mark Harshberger died of one gunshot wound to the abdomen. Dr. Denic revealed during Mary Beth Harshberger's trial that Mark would most likely have been leaning over when he was struck by a bullet. Trial Following a lengthy investigation, Canadian officials issued charges in April 2008. After several years of appeals, Mary Beth Harshbarger was ordered by U.S. District Judge Thomas I. Vanaskie to surrender to the U.S. Marshals Service by 2pm on May 14, 2010. She was then extradited to Canada to stand trial for criminal negligence in the case of her husband's shooting in 2006. Mary Beth Harshbarger arrived in Newfoundland on May 17 to face the charges. If convicted, Mary Beth faced a minimum of four years in prison. Mary Beth Harshbarger was tried in the Newfoundland and Labrador Supreme Court in Grand Falls-Windsor on a count of criminal negligence. The case was heard without a jury in the courtroom of Justice Richard LeBlanc. During a re-enactment that was used as evidence by the defense during the trial, hunting guide Lambert Greene and Reg White owner of the Moosehead Lodge where the Harshbargers stayed during their trip, said what they saw through Harshbarger's rifle scope looked more animal than human. Police who conducted two re-enactments said that all they could make out through Mary Beth's rifle scope was a ‚Äúblack mass‚Äù and that it was ‚Äúplausible‚Äù that she thought she was aiming at a bear. The prosecution argued that Mary Beth knew her husband was in those woods, and that it was possible he would be emerging from the site at any time, wearing dark clothing. In Mary Beth's defense, Dr. Denic, the pathologist that conducted an autopsy on Mark Harshbarger after his fatal accident concluded that Mark was most likely leaning or hunched over when he was struck by the bullet. The issue of his posture was significant to the trial as Mary Beth had steadily maintained that she thought her husband was a black bear. Several witnesses during the trial suggested that it was too dark for any hunter to have shot with confidence. Mary Beth was found not guilty of criminal negligence causing death in the shooting death of her husband. Justice Richard LeBlanc concluded that the Crown had failed to prove Harshbarger displayed a complete disregard for the safety of others, and that the death was ‚Äúa result of an accident and nothing more‚Äù. Controversy While Mary Beth believed she shot at a bear and that her mistake could be attributed to her poor visibility and Mark's dark clothing and was found not guilty by a judge, the Harshbarger family has insisted that the shooting was deliberate. Mark's father Leonard Harshbarger was quoted in the media as saying \\"It isn't an accident to mistake someone for something else and kill him. That's a negligent act‚Ä¶\\" There are reports that Mary Beth and her husband Mark had increased their life insurance not long before the hunting trip.Nexstar Broadcasting. \\"Charges filed in Canada against Mary Beth Harshbarger\\" Mary Beth collected on life insurance policies worth $550,000 (US). After Mark Harshbarger's death from injuries sustained during the shooting incident, his brother Barry Harshbarger moved into the marital home that his brother had shared with Mary Beth and Mary Beth and Barry began a relationship. However, when Mary Beth Harshbarger left the home to stand trial in Canada in May 2011, Barry Harshbarger engaged in a relationship with another woman. Following her acquittal and return to her home that Barry was still living in, on November 1, 2011, Barry Harshbarger obtained a temporary protection from abuse order (PFA) against Mary Beth, claiming that ‚ÄòI am in fear for my life', alleging she had unstable behaviour and past violence. In the order Barry Harshbarger claimed that Mary Beth had threatened him by pointing a loaded rifle at him at some point prior to October 18, 2011. At the hearing, the judge found that Barry's claims were inaccurate exaggerations and were not enough to keep the protective order in place.The Daily Review. Dec 3, 2011. \\"Judge throws out PFA order that had been lodged against Mary Beth Harshbarger.\\" Media coverage The shooting incident and the subsequent trial garnered significant media interest.

Life and work Otto Wiener was a son of Christian Wiener and Pauline Hausrath. Orphan of mother at the age of 3, he married Lina Fenner at 32. He was a pupil of August Kundt at the University of Strasbourg, where he received his doctorate in 1887 with a thesis on the phase change of light upon reflection, and methods to determine the thickness of thin films. Wiener is known for the experimental proof of standing light waves. In 1890 he succeeded in determining the wavelength of light. He was professor at the University of Giessen from 1895. In 1899 he became professor at the Physics Institute of the University of Leipzig,http://www.2iceshs.cyfronet.pl/2ICESHS_Proceedings/Chapter_17/R-9_Schlote.pdf where he succeeded Gustav Wiedemann. Together with Theodor des Coudres, he built an excellent physical institute there, and appointed Peter Debye and Gregor Wentzel. In his academic inaugural lecture at Leipzig of 1900 on The Extension of our Senses, he presented the theory of physical education in the context of evolutionary theory. He took up Heinrich Hertz's theory that separates internal images ‚Äîa conceptualization of reality‚Äî from descriptions of experiment(Principles of Mechanics, 1894). It was the dawn of media technology. Wiener added to Hertz's work, and theorized cinematography as an extension of our senses (1900). The Standing Lightwaves Experiment thumbleft320px Schematic illustration of the experimental setup described by the author in 1890. The film is depicted as if it were a developed positive transparency, showing 27 waves and 2 transverse lines of the carbon arc spectrum near to Fraunhofer's H. Otto Wiener's fame is mostly due to the experiment where he visualized light waves in steady conditions. Although it could be considered equivalent to Hertz's detection of radio waves, their intent differed. Hertz aimed at validating Maxwell's theory, while Wiener's purpose was to determine the plane of vibration of light waves, as they were conceived in mechanical theory. Note that both scientists, like most of their contemporaries, assumed the existence of aether. With the rise of quantum mechanics, the concept of luminous field changed dramatically. Nowadays, quantum optics replaced the problem of visualizing light waves with that of simultaneously measuring their phase and amplitude. =Experimental setup= The light was obtained from a carbon arc light, entering the darkroom through a slit. Then it was filtered through a prism, discarding most of the red side of the spectrum. An achromatic lens focused an 8mm-wide, slightly converging light beam. 220mm after the lens, the light hit a polished silver mirror perpendicularly. Monochromatic light would result in a uniform wavelength, hence a regular standing waves pattern, parallel to the mirror's surface. Wiener's orthochromatic film was transparently thin, about 20 nm, measured by interference, which is much less than the wavelength (the sodium doublet is at about 589 nm). It was laid on the mirror, over an equally thin slice of gel. That way, by applying pressure on one side of the film only, Wiener could slightly tilt it so as to make it traverse several standing waves. The standing waves were revealed by exposing the film for 20~35 minutes, after development and printing. =Drude's critique= Wiener added benzene to the wedge after having been criticized for not considering the possibility of having photographed thin-film interference fringes rather than standing waves. His interpretation validated Fresnel's interpretation rather than Neumann's. Paul Drude criticized Wiener for this. With Nernst, he repeated Wiener's experiment using a fluorescent film as detector, in order to prove that the effect was due to electric fields. =Relationship with interferential photography= A photographic experiment for validating Fresnel's theory had already been suggested by Wilhelm Zenker (1829-1899), after a call by the French Academy of Sciences in 1865. Zenker's proposal didn't delve into the thickness of the film, though. By exposing a thicker film, to be observed by reflection rather than by transparency, Gabriel Lippmann discovered interferential color photography, which he was awarded the Nobel prize for. Wiener contributed to Lippmann's theory thereafter. =Further repetitions of the experiment= Repetition of the experiment under different conditions was carried out by Leistner, a Wiener's student, to better characterize the radiation. Leistner modified a Mach‚ÄìZehnder interferometer so as to insert the film between the mirrors. Another repetition was the thesis of Ernst Schult, commissioned by Nernst and Max von Laue for comparing light intensity with the energy as measured with a micropyrometer, along the verification of the energy quantization hypothesis with respect to the simple wave theory. A further notable repetition, aimed at evaluating the dependence of a cesium film's photoelectric emission upon illumination conditions. Ives and Fry controlled bands formation using a thicker film to be dissected upon development. More recent repetitions avail of laser technology.

Recently eggshell waste has been used as a low cost catalyst for biodiesel production.  Methods  = Non-chemical separators = Joseph H. MacNeil, Professor of Food Science at Penn State University, developed a machine that uses a delicate multi-bladed knife to scrape the membrane from the surface of shell fragments.MacNeil JH: Method and apparatus for separating a protein membrane and shell material in waste egg shells. In United States Patent (Foundation TPSR ed., vol. 6,176,376. United States: The Penn State Research Foundation; 2001. This invention uses a water-based method to separate the eggshell and protein membrane. The two products are processed in two streams to yield mm size particles of dry membrane and mm size particles of dried shell. Another non-chemical separation technique utilizes steam heat, mechanical abrasion, and a light vacuum to separate the hard eggshell from the protein-containing membranes.Adams: Egghell membrane separation method. In US Patent 7,017,277, United States: ESM Technologies, LLC; 2006. This invention passes shell fragments obtained from egg-breaking facilities through a series of heated augers. Once the shell and membrane flakes reach the appropriate moisture content, the vacuum pulls them into a cyclone device. The cyclonic action further separates the heavier eggshell flakes from the lighter membrane flakes. This invention has been commercialized and can easily separate multiple metric tons per day, allowing for the production of valuable products including commercial volumes of natural eggshell membrane or NEM. Levi New invented a non-chemical and non- thermal separation technique that utilizes airflow to pull egg shells through a venturi. The material is subjected to pressure waves while passing through the venturi.New: Eggshell membrane separation process. In US Patent 8,448,884 B2, United States; 2013. A PulverDryer machine configured with a venturi sized to process egg shell pulverizes the shell component into fine powder and discharges the membrane as an intact dry flake material. The two components are separated in post processing by a standard shaker screen table, then the membrane is cleaned via one of several standard washing processes, depending on end use. Up to several tons of egg shell material can be processed per hour. = Dissolved air-flotation separation unit = The waste eggshells are put into water and then ground to separate the eggshell from the protein membrane. Then the ground eggshell is placed in a separate vessel where air is injected into the water flow. The air and water mixture causes the lighter component (protein membrane) to float and the heavier (calcium carbonate eggshells) to sink. This unit recovers 96% of eggshell membrane and 99% of eggshell calcium carbonate in two hours. = Water and acetic acid = The inventor of this method is Vladimir Vlad. The machine uses unseparated eggshells that are placed in a fluid tank, applying cavitation to separate the eggshell membrane from the eggshell. The fluid tank in this case contains distilled water and acetic acid to provide continuous processing. Also this invention has a method for collecting separated eggshells to grind them into an eggshell powder.

In 2008 his testimony for a Spanish documentary was used to claim that at the 1968 Contest the voting had been rigged by Spanish dictator Francisco Franco and that the United Kingdom should have won the contest, although he later clarified that he had just repeated a widespread rumour and that his words had been taken out of context. Between the 2011 Contest and the 2017 Contest, he provided the TVE commentary. √ç√±igo was joined by Julia Varela between the 2015 Contest and the 2017 Contest. =Personal life= In 1970 he married painter and model designer Josette Nahmias in Santo Cristo de El Pardo chapel. On 17 December 1984, he married Mar√≠a del Pilar Piniella by civil marriage at the Registro Civil of Barcelona. =Death= √ç√±igo died in Madrid aged 75 on 5 May 2018, just before the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 on 8 May. The last night, √ç√±igo told Pepa Fern√°ndez he did not have any strength, and died in his sleep. It was then when his widow revealed that he had been diagnosed with cancer two years earlier, but he kept working until the last day. His chapelle ardente was installed the same day in Tanatorio de La Paz.

Their music contains a multitude of different sounds of percussion, vocals, and guitars, but is also described as having a strong composition and attitude. With their debut of the CD Sun Dancer, ATP was hosted on the national Japanese TV shows Zeus' Holiday and Jaka-Jan. The program Dash/Dash regarded ATP as the best band in Japanese alternative music.

For two years after the release of Sun Dancer the band took a break to experiment and record new music while their producer, Crane, became seriously ill. The band resumed normal performances in 1998. That same year, the group produced the album Aroused Zen that included work from the two year performance break. The chairman of MP3.com called ATP ‚Äúthe greatest unknown band from Asia, and a good example of internet possibility.‚Äù Due to this ATP became big overseas, and had their first overseas tour through Asia in 2000.

She was one of only six fillies to win The Derby, and was also the second of only four greys to have won the race. She achieved this feat as a three-year-old in 1912, a year in which she had already won the 1000 Guineas. Although her Derby win was easy and impressive, she failed to reproduce her winning form in her three subsequent races. Background Tagalie was a small, lightly framed grey filly (\\"more like a greyhound then a racehorse\\"), bred by her owner, the financier Walter Raphael. She was sired by Cyllene, an Ascot Gold Cup winner, who went on to become a highly successful stallion. In addition to Tagalie, he sired three other winners of The Derby and through his grandson, Phalaris, he is the direct male-line ancestor of most modern thoroughbreds. Her dam was the French-bred mare Tagale, from whom she inherited her grey coat. In addition to Tagalie, Tagale also produced the Gimcrack Stakes winner Blankney II. Raphael sent the filly to his private trainer Matthew Dawson Waugh at his Somerville Lodge Stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1911: two-year-old season= Tagalie showed some promise as a juvenile in 1911, despite not appearing on a racecourse until October. She won the Boscawen Post Stakes and was then sent to Newmarket for the Cheveley Park Stakes, the most important race of the season for British two-year-old fillies, in which she finished third to Belleisle. On her third and final start of the season she ran unplaced in a race at Sandown. =1912: three-year-old season= On her three- year-old debut, Tagalie was sent straight for the 1000 Guineas on May 3 for which she started a 20/1 outsider. Ridden by the New Zealand jockey Les Hewitt she led from the start and won by one and a half lengths from Alope, with Belleisle third. Her winning time of 1:39.6 was the second fastest recorded up to that time. In the Newmarket Stakes on May 15 she proved herself capable of racing against colts when overcoming interference to finish an unlucky second to Cylgad. As Hewitt was already committed to ride another horse in the Derby, Tagalie was ridden at Epsom on June 5 by the American Johnny Reiff. She started at odds of 100/8 in a field of twenty, in front of a large crowd which included the King and Queen. As at Newmarket, she led from the start, opened up a clear lead and was never in any danger. Reiff was even able to give the filly a \\"breather\\" just after half way before sending her clear again and winning \\"in a canter\\" by four lengths from Jaeger and Tracery. Two days later she started a \\"red-hot favourite\\" at odds of 1/2 for the Oaks, despite rumours that she would miss the race. On this occasion she was held up in the early stages by her new rider George Stern but took up the lead at half way and appeared to be going well. In the straight however, she appeared to tire badly and finished seventh behind Mirska. The only explanation offered was that she was unsuited by the state of the ground which had been softened by heavy rain since the Derby. Tagalie never recaptured her Derby-winning form. Her meeting with the Ascot Gold Cup winner Prince Palatine in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown on July 19 was anticipated as the potential \\"race of the season\\", but the filly ran poorly and was unplaced. Once again, there were some attempts to excuse her performance by claiming that she was unsuited by the soft ground, although another view was that her lack of stamina, which had not been truly tested in the Derby, had now been exposed. In an attempt to redeem her reputation and win an unconventional Triple Crown, Tagalie was sent to Doncaster in September for the St. Leger Stakes, but made no impression in finishing unplaced behind Tracery. She was then retired to stud, having earned ¬£11,200 in her three-year-old season. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Tagalie the thirty-sixth best British filly or mare of the 20th Century .Randall, J and Morris, T. Portway Press, 1999, p. 141 Stud career Tagalie produced only four foals, but they included Allenby, by Bayardo, who finished second by half a length to Tetratema in the 2000 Guineas and won the Newmarket Stakes in 1920. Tagalie died after giving birth in the same year. Pedigree * Tagalie was inbred 3x4 to Isonomy. This means that the stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of her pedigree.

The anti-Zionist group is thought to have roughly 100 activist members. The Sikrikim gained international attention for acts of violence they committed against Orthodox Jewish institutions and individuals who would not comply with their demands. The name Sikrikim comes from sicarii, a group of Jewish Zealots who attacked Romans and their Jewish sympathizers during the Roman occupation of Judea using concealed daggers, sicae in Latin. History The Sikrikim began to appear in ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods in 2005. In Meah Shearim they are called the \\"Mafia of Mea Shearim\\" by some residents of the neighborhood. They are considered to be loosely affiliated with the Neturei Karta.Amoni, P. An Interview with Rav Shlomo Pappenheim. Ami Magazine, September 2011 Incidents =Use of Holocaust symbolism= On 31 December 2011, several hundred Haredim demonstrated in Jerusalem's Kikar HaShabbat (Sabbath Square), protesting against what they call \\"the exclusion of Haredim\\" from society. They specifically accused the \\"secular media\\" of bias in their coverage of both violent and non-violent acts of protest by Haredim with regard to allegedly immodestly clad women in public. They made use of Holocaust imagery, with some of the protesters wearing yellow badges, while others, including children, dressed in concentration camp uniforms, claiming by way of analogy that they are being persecuted in Israel by the secular majority. At the same time, the protesters expressed their solidarity with Shmuel Weissfish, a leading Sikrikim activist sentenced to two-years imprisonment for rioting, extortion, assault and grievous bodily harm, whose sentence was slated to begin on 1 January 2012. The use of Holocaust symbols at the demonstration made headlines in the international media, and was condemned by Israeli politicians. =Orot Banot Girls School= In September 2011, the Religious Zionist Orot Banot Girls School opened in Ramat Bet Shemesh. Many Haredim opposed the school's location and position on religion. Groups of Haredi men believed to be Sikrikim regularly stood outside the school on school days and taunted the students, throwing eggs and rocks at them while claiming that the girls were immodestly dressed. The incidents attracted wide attention in Israel and became an international news story after an Israeli television channel reported about harassments against one of the girls. =Zisalek ice cream parlour= In October 2011, the Sikrikim vandalised a store selling ice cream in a Haredi neighborhood in Jerusalem. The store had set up signs asking men and women to be seated separately, and not to eat in public. The Sikrikim asserted that licking ice-cream cones was \\"immodest\\". They broke in one night and vandalised the store. =Or HaChaim bookstore= The Or HaChaim Bookstore in Meah Shearim, or \\"Manny's\\" as it is known in the neighborhood, was targeted in a series of vandalism incidents in which the Sikrikim took credit via posters hung outside the store. The posters opposed the bookstore's selling of \\"Zionist\\" material. The store's windows were smashed several times, and members of the group put glue in the store's locks and dumped bags of human excrement inside the store. =Rivalry with the Gerrer Hasidim= The Or HaChaim Center belongs to a chain of stores partly owned by Yaakov Bibla and Yaakov Litzman, both Gerrer Hasidim, with whom the Sikrikim have an ongoing rivalry in Jerusalem. Gerrer Hasidim from the Batei Warsaw neighborhood near Meah Shearim reported widespread harassment that had almost escalated into a street war, with people from Ger attacking Sikrikim out of vengeance. The underlying issue seemed to be the large involvement and support that the Ger give to the state and government of Israel. Response The group has been denounced by several members of the Knesset, including National Union Knesset Member Yaakov Katz, who called them \\"terrorists\\". When asked to comment or condemn them, Ramat Beit Shemesh Haredi rabbi Chaim Malinowitz refused, saying that by issuing a public condemnation it would make it look as if they are connected, when \\"No man in his sane mind wouldn't condemn this, just like you wouldn't ask me to condemn Madoff\\". The group and its supporters were criticised by a number of Israeli politicians for using Holocaust symbolism (including yellow badges and Concentration Camp uniforms) to call attention to what they call the exclusion of Haredim from Israeli society. Shas' spiritual leader Ovadia Yosef criticised the Sikrikim, saying that they \\"discredit the Torah\\". Edah HaChareidis, which has been accused by anti-Haredi activists of supporting the Sikarikim, routinely condemn them over their activities. Arrests and trials In January 2011, Shmuel Weissfish, a leading activist of the Sikrikim, and one of the assailants of the Space electronics store owner in Geula was sentenced to two years imprisonment for rioting, extortion, assault and grievous bodily harm by the Jerusalem District Court. The sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court in November of the same year. Hundreds of Haredim protested against his condemnation. In September 2011, one of the heads of the Sikrikim considered responsible for harassing and vandalizing the Ohr HaChaim Bookstore was arrested by the police. In November 2011, Yosef Meir Hazan, a member of the Sikrikim, was arrested in the Geula neighborhood by the Jerusalem Police on suspicion of causing public disturbances, damaging property and assaulting a police officer attempting to arrest him. In a video posted to YouTube, he is shown directing various demonstrations and violent activities against the Ohr HaChaim Bookstore in Meah Shearim and the Batei Warsaw complex in Geula, the focus of a violent struggle between the Sikrikim and the neighborhood's Ger Hasidim. He was indicted and charged with one count of aggravated assault, one count of aggravated assault against a police officer, and rioting. The 21-year-old Hazan was released to house arrest at his aunt's residence, and was placed under the supervision of his aunt, his mother, and a rabbi.

The respondents brought a High-Court application seeking the residents' eviction in terms of the Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act (PIE),Act 19 of 1998.s 6. on the grounds that the property was required for the development. The residents, for their part, argued that they were not unlawful occupiers: They had obtained the necessary consent of the City of Cape Town to occupy the land,s 6(1)(a).In terms of s 1(ii), consent may be \\"express or tacit [...] in writing or otherwise.\\" and hence were not \\"unlawful occupiers\\" as defined in the Act.s 1. They should not, therefore, be evicted. The appellants also depended on the provision of the red cards‚Äîthese, they argued, entitled them to remain in undisturbed possession of their housesPara 40.‚Äîand on the fact that reconstruction work had been done by the City after the fire,Para 43. as well as on the supply of basic services, which ostensibly indicated the City's consent.Para 38. Nomaindia Mfeketo, the previous mayor of Cape Town, denied in her testimony that consent had been given to occupy. She argued that the services had been provided for \\"basic humanitarian reasons.\\"Quoted at para 40. They must not be construed as consent on the part of the City; nor, Mfeketo contended, did they grant the residents any enforceable right to remain in the area. It had always been intended that informal settlements in general would be upgraded or moved or redeveloped, in conformity with the state's constitutional imperative to provide access to adequate housing on a progressive basis.s 26(1).  Issues  The High Court ultimately granted the eviction order, and the residents applied for leave to appeal directly to the Constitutional Court, where, when it was granted, they raised the following issues: # whether or not the applicants were unlawful occupiers in terms of PIE and, if not, whether their occupation was lawfully terminated; # whether section 5 or 6 of the Act was applicable; # whether the technical requirements of PIE had been complied with; # whether the relocation of the applicants was just and equitable; # whether the applicants had a substantive and legitimate expectation in relation to the allocation of housing opportunities in the Joe Slovo settlement to them, and whether this expectation had been or could be fulfilled; # whether the eviction was in all the circumstances reasonable; and # the nature of the appropriate and just and equitable relief. Two key legal decisions arose for decision. The first was whether or not the respondents had made out a case for eviction in terms of PIE. Key to this question was whether or not, at the time of the launch of eviction proceedings, the applicants were \\"unlawful occupiers\\" within the meaning of the Act, and whether or not it was just and equitable to issue an eviction order. PIE defines an unlawful occupier as > a person who occupies land without the express or tacit consent of the owner > or person in charge, or without any other right in law to occupy such land, > excluding a person who is an occupier in terms of the Extension of Security > of Tenure Act, 1997, and excluding a person whose informal right to land, > but for the provisions of this Act, would be protected by the provisions of > the Interim Protection of Informal Land Rights Act, 1996.s 1(xi). The question hinged, therefore, on whether or not the municipality had consented to the occupation. If there had been consent, and the right to occupy had not been terminated, the respondents would not have been entitled to a relocation order. Once there is a right to eject, however,‚Äîand this is so only if there is no municipal consent to occupy‚Äîthe provisions of PIE become applicable as a matter of protection to the person or persons liable to eviction. The second question was whether the respondents had acted reasonably, within the meaning of the Constitution,s 26. in seeking the applicants' eviction.  Judgment  The Constitutional Court held that the provision of basic services was legitimate evidence of the City's state of mind. Clearly it was appreciated that the residents were a reality and would have to be accepted and provided for in a humane manner for a considerable period of time, until access to adequate housing could be realised. The provision of basic services, taken together with several other factors, had to lead to the irresistible inference that the City had tacitly given its permission for the occupation.Paras 155-156, 180, 280, 358. The court found, however, that the invocation of PIE procedures on the public breakdown of the process between the residents and the State served in itself as a final statement that the occupation of the Joe Slovo settlement had been rendered unlawful.Paras 84, 160, 180, 290, 394. Provided that the order for the eviction and relocation made appropriate provision for the safe and dignified and humane relocation of everyone involved, the eviction and relocation would be in accordance with justice and equity, as required by PIE.s 6(3). The order should therefore be coupled with a further order guaranteeing that the applicants should be allocated the specified proportion of the new houses to be built on the site of Joe Slovo within a process of meaningful engagement with the people.Paras 114, 175, 260-261, 313, 326, 409. The appeal was thus allowed in part, but the eviction was permitted to go ahead.

The film won much praise and critical acclaim after premiering at the SXSW festival in the US, and was a success at the box office in the UK and the US, where it received a limited release. Plot On a Friday night in Nottingham, Russell attends a house party with friends. He assures his best friend Jamie that he will be there on Sunday for his daughter's birthday. Russell leaves early, but decides to go to a gay club, alone and looking for a hookup. Just before closing time he meets Glen, an art student, and they have sex back at Russell's apartment. The next morning, Glen coaxes a hesitant Russell to speak into a voice recorder about their experience the previous night. Glen tells him this is for an art project. The more reserved Russell is taken aback by Glen's blunt discussion of sex. After Russell finishes, they exchange numbers and Glen leaves. Russell is shown writing about Glen on his laptop, evidently something he does after each of his encounters. Russell, who works as a lifeguard, spends a lonely morning at the pool, at one point intently watching a gay couple interact. He texts Glen, who agrees to meet. The two begin to learn about each other's careers, their aspirations, and even share a bicycle ride back to Russell's flat, where they continue to discover more about each other's pasts. Glen explains that his art project seeks to explore the gap between who people truly are and who they want to be, as demonstrated by the personas they take on when hooking up with someone new for the first time. Russell reveals that he never came out to his parents because he doesn't know who they are; he grew up in a series of foster homes with his best friend Jamie. Growing closer after their conversation, they have sex. About to leave, Glen then discloses that he had been planning to move to Oregon the next day to attend a two-year art course. Both are visibly upset, but stay affectionate. On a whim, Glen invites him to his goodbye party at a straight bar that night, and later Russell decides to go. While Glen is getting into an argument about heteronormativity with the bar owner, Russell chats with Jill, Glen's friend and flatmate. She first tells Russell that she never got to listen to his recording; Glen had let her listen to all of his others. She then confides in Russell that she and her friends don't expect Glen to follow through with his trip to America, to the point that they've started a bet. She also discloses that Glen had been in a relationship with someone named John, who cheated on Glen repeatedly and was attacked at a park shortly before the relationship ended. Since then, Glen has said he \\"doesn't do boyfriends.\\" Russell and Glen leave the bar, ditching Glen's friends, and head to a nearby carnival. Glen admits he's excited to leave, as he feels like his friends here have held him back. After enjoying their time at the park, they return to Russell's apartment and smoke marijuana, drink alcohol, and snort cocaine. Russell confesses that like Glen's art project, he has been recording his experiences, albeit more privately. He reads some of his entries to Glen, at which time it is revealed that one of the men Russell had slept with had been John, Glen's ex-boyfriend. They begin to argue about the motivations for the fight for gay marriage given Glen's anti-relationship stance. Russell confronts Glen, telling him that he thinks he's only lost faith in relationships because of John. Glen rebukes him and tells him it's not that simple, and says that while he thinks Russell would make an amazing boyfriend, he doesn't want one right now. Russell is upset and steps away to the bathroom. He returns and they reconcile, and share a tender kiss. With all that has happened, they passionately make love that night. Now Sunday morning, they talk in bed. Russell opens up about how self-conscious he feels in public about being gay. Glen deduces that part of the reason Russell keeps a record of his encounters is because he is fascinated by how people come out. Glen then pretends to be Russell's father, and gives Russell the opportunity to finally come out. Glen notes that he'll be leaving by train later that afternoon, while Russell has Jamie's daughter's birthday party to attend. Russell searches for the right way to say goodbye, but Glen shushes him and leaves with a kiss. At the party, Russell makes a feeble attempt to stay interested, but he is clearly distracted. Jamie is able to persuade Russell to talk about what's on his mind, even though they don't usually talk about this part of Russell's life. After Russell explains his angst over the weekend's events, Jamie suggests taking Russell to the train station to see Glen off. Russell is there in time to see Glen show up at the station. As the two wait for the train to arrive, Russell struggles to convey how much their chance encounter has meant to him. Glen stops him, just as he himself begins to hold back tears. They kiss in public, notable for the usually restrained Russell. Glen gives Russell a present (labeled \\"Russell the Lifeguard\\" because Glen had forgotten his last name), and with one last kiss, Glen leaves. Later, looking out from the window in his apartment, Russell opens the present and finds the voice recorder that Glen had used the morning after their first night. He presses play, and hears himself begin to recount what was the beginning of an unforgettable weekend.

The film was shunned by the more than 1,100 cinemas owned by the Catholic Church that comprise the bulk of Italy's network of independent/arthouse theaters.

He was named after his grandfather Shishman of Vidin and was probably born in the capital of the Bulgarian Empire Tarnovo. Background His father, Michael Shishman led aggressive policy in the Balkans, in an attempt to extend the size of Bulgaria to that during the reign of Ivan Asen II (1218‚Äì1241). The Byzantine Empire suffered some setbacks and had to agree to concessions in Thrace but Michael Shishman could not achieve a decisive success. He eventually allied with the Byzantines against Serbia and divorced with his Serbian wife Anna Neda. In 1330 the Serbs defeated the Bulgarian army in battle of Velbazhd, in which the Bulgarian tsar perished. After the battle the two sides negotiated peace in the locality Mraka and it was decided that the eldest son of Michael Shishman ‚Äì Ivan Stephen would succeed his father as emperor. Eight months later, in 1331, Ivan Stephen was overthrown in a palace coup by Ivan Alexander (1331‚Äì1371), son of Michael Shishman's sister. Anna Neda and her sons had to flee to Serbia. Rule in exile A miniature of Ivan Alexander. Shishman did not follow his family and fled to Constantinople. He was immediately sent to the Byzantine regent and later emperor John VI Kantakouzenos, who acknowledged him as Emperor of Bulgaria. That act infuriated Ivan Alexander who demanded that Shishman must be deported to Bulgaria and threatened with war. John VI Kantakouzenos answered that in case of war the Byzantines would transport Shishman to Vidin with ships where the proximity with his family's domains would eventually lead to a civil war. In 1331 Ivan Alexander launched a campaign, assembled his army at Sliven and marched to the south. The Bulgarians and the Byzantines under Andronikos III Palaiologos and Shishman fought a battle near Adrianople which ended without a clear victor or in a minor Byzantine victory and a peace treaty was signed. After that event Shishman is not mentioned in the historical sources. Sources * Fine, John Van Antwerp (1994).

The village is about 5 miles south-west of the town of Dartmouth on the A379 road between Dartmouth and Kingsbridge, atop the cliffs behind Pilchard Cove at the north end of Slapton Sands,Ordnance Survey 1:25000 Outdoor leisure Map 20 which part of the beach is known locally as Strete Sands. The northern end of the beach has been a naturist beach for many years. The parish of Strete was created out of the south-eastern part of Blackawton parish in 1881. There was a small medieval chapel of ease in the village until 1836 when the present church, dedicated to St Michael, was built on the same site, incorporating the chapel's tower. The population of the parish was 520 in 2001, decreasing to 474 in 2011. Its western boundary is formed, in part, by the Gara Brook which separates it from the parish of Slapton, and it also has boundaries with the parishes of Blackawton and Stoke Fleming. The Gara Brook flows into the Higher Ley of Slapton Ley, part of which is in the parish and at the northern end of which is Strete Gate where there is a small, free and a larger, pay-and-display car park with access to Strete Sands and a woodland walk. The first documentary mention of the place was as Streta in 1194. In 1244 it was called Strete. The name derives from Old English Str«£t, meaning a road or Roman road; the village lies on an ancient trackway. Donn's One-Inch map of 1765 records the village as Street, which it remained until the late 19th century, when it was altered to be spelled Strete. Strete was one of the parishes evacuated in December 1943 as part of Exercise Tiger.

RNN was launched as a Facebook-based news source launched on January 25, 2011. It quickly advanced to become a primary contributor of Egyptian revolution- related news that year. Applying the motto \\"From the people to the people,\\" the citizen journalists who created RNN have since added a Twitter feed and launched an independent website dedicated to short news stories favored by an online audience. RNN is an organized citizen news network with four working committees; one for editing the news, another to support the correspondents covering Egypt, a third for managing the multimedia feeds and a fourth for staff functions such as development, training and public relations. RNN's Arabic name, Rassd, is an acronym that stands for Rakeb (observe), Sawwer (record) and Dawwen (blog). RNN created a Ustream channel on January 27, 2011, and a YouTube account a month later. The success of RNN and its new social media model is evidenced in its recent local network expansion into Libya, Morocco, Syria, Jerusalem and Turkey. Even so, one media scholar in the US (commenting in 2011) called the accuracy of RNN's reporting \\"fairly mediocre\\". RNN has endured closures of their Facebook profile and YouTube account as part of the attacks from private media, attempting to thwart their work and influence their content. Use of RNN's news by international media RNN has been a global source of Egyptian revolution-related news since its launch. During the early days of the citizen uprisings across the Middle East, major networks such as BBC, Reuters, Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya used some of Rassd's news and photos, and followed the network on Twitter. Three days after the online portal went live it was streaming video to MSNBC through its Facebook page.

Bodzentyn Castle () is a ruined castle in Bodzentyn, Poland. It was built in the second half of the fourteenth century. History 250px At the beginning of the fourteenth century, the Bishop of Krak√≥w, Bodzanta, built a wooden mansion on a hill above the PsarkƒÖ river. This manor house was destroyed fairly quickly and the later Bishop of Krak√≥w Florian Mokrski erected a stone castle on a hill, surrounded by a moat. One of the greatest events in the history of the castle took place in 1410 when King Wladyslaw Jagiello visited it on pilgrimage to the Holy Cross before the Battle of Grunwald. The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were a time of unprecedented prosperity of the castle. It was expanded after the great fire of 1413 and at the end of the fifteenth century, Cardinal Fryderyk Jagiello≈Ñczyk added a new east wing with the residential towers. Construction work continued during the sixteenth century by successive bishops Jan Konarski, Piotr Tomicki, Franciszek Krasi≈Ñski and Piotr Myszkowski, who gradually gave it all the features of the Renaissance style. All the activities were led by the Italian architect, Jan Balcer. Last significant reconstruction of the castle took place between 1657‚Äì1691, under the leadership of the bishops Jakuba Zadzika, Piotr Gembicki, Piotr Tylicki, Marcin Szyszkowski, Andrzej Trzebicki and Jan Ma≈Çachowski. The building took the form of the Baroque, with a horseshoe-shaped plan. The last investor in the residence was in the 2nd half of the eighteenth century by Bishop Cajetan So≈Çtyk, employing eminent architect, Jakuba Fontanƒô. The importance of the castle in Bodzentyn began to decline following the construction of the episcopal palace in Kielce. In 1789, the Diet decided to proceed to nationalize episcopal property. The castle was converted into a granary and a military hospital. In 1814 the building was finally omitted. The medieval castle became mainly a source of free building materials for the local population, consequently to erode the monument into ruin. Only in 1902 did the building become protected. But it was never rebuilt to its former glory.

Officially established in February 1917, it comprised abjurers of the Austro- Hungarian Army, mainly contingents from Transylvania and Bukovina. These had been obliged to fight against Romania, and, once in Russian custody, volunteered for service against the Central Powers. As campaigners for self- determination and union with Romania, they passed political resolutions which, in both tone and scope, announced those adopted on Union Day 1918. The Corps was effectively an active military reserve of the Romanian Land Forces, and regularly dispatched new units to the Romanian front after June 1917. It helped defend the last stretches of Romania against the Central Powers' unified offensive, and met success in the Battle of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti, but it still lacked a unitary command structure. When the October Revolution in Russia and the Romanian armistice took Romania out of the Entente camp, the Corps was left without backing and purpose. However, it inspired the creation of similar units in Entente countries, most successfully the . Mobilized volunteers or prisoners symbolically tied to the Corps were left behind in Russia after the Russian Civil War was ignited. Various such individuals formed the Romanian Legion of Siberia, which resisted the Bolsheviks in cooperation with the Czechoslovak Legions and the White movement. These units were ultimately repatriated to Greater Romania in 1920. Darnytsia Corps =Origins= During 1916, Romania entered World War I as an Entente country, in alliance with the Russian Empire against Austria-Hungary and the other Central Powers. After a while, Romania began investigating the fate and loyalties of Austria- Hungarian Romanians who were held in Russian POW camps.Otu, Petre, \\"Octavian Goga despre revolu»õia rusƒÉ din februarie 1917\\" (\\"Octavian Goga on the Russian Revolution of February 1917\\"), in Magazin Istoric, November 2007, p.20 Estimates for that period place the total population of Bukovinian and Transylvanian Romanians in such facilities, throughout Russia, at 120,000PƒÉrean, [p.1, 3]; »òerban (AUASH 2004), p.176 or 130,000.

See also »òerban (AUASH 2004), p.176 Russian authorities were undecided about letting them join, and initially prohibited such initiatives; those who insisted to establish contact with Romania were arrested by the Russian police forces.PƒÉrean, [p.1] During the same year, after consultations with Romania, the Russian executive reverted such policies. It was decided that Russia would free at most 15,000 of this demographic group, transferring them to Romania in exchange for a similar number of non-Romanian prisoners from Romanian camps. Subsequently, those who chose to enlist were together relocated at the special camp in Darnytsia‚Äîa suburb of Kiev, rendered in Romanian as Darni»õa. In December 1916, that facility held some 200 officers and 1,200 non-commissioned officers, who formed the nucleus (and general command) of a \\"Romanian Corps\\".Mamina et al., p.40; PƒÉrean, [p.1]. Gocan (p.11) has \\"approx. 300 officers and 1,500 non- commissioned officers and soldiers\\" by March 1917 Elected First Senior of the Camp, the 40-year-old Victor Deleu was a legal professional, rank-and-file member of the Romanian National Party (PNR) and journalist from Transylvania, who came to Darnytsia after internment in Kineshma. The other members of Darnytsia camp's leadership body were Pompiliu Nistor, Vasile Chiroiu, Emil Isopescu, Valeriu Milovan, Octavian Vasu and Ioan Vescan.List varies between PƒÉrean ([p.1-2]) and »òerban (2001, p.145, 146) Regardless of such initiatives, Romania tended to give little attention to the potential of recruitment in Russia, as many decision-makers were still uncertain about the devotion of Transylvanians and Bukovinians, and worried that they might be welcoming Austro-Hungarian spies into army ranks.»òerban (AUASH 2004), p.176-177 Additionally, probably half of the 120,000 men excluded themselves from the pool of recruits, as Austrian loyalists, invalids or men who had reason to fear Austria-Hungary's retaliation.»òerban (AUASH 2004), p.176 Support from within Romania was therefore weak, and Russian obstruction still had a part to play, but in January the camp was visited by Lieutenant Colonel Constantin Gh. Pietraru of the Romanian Land Forces, on a mission to evaluate the recruitment project.»òerban (2001), p.145, 146; (AUASH 2004), p.176-177 The reversal of fortunes on the Romanian front had brought a Central Powers' invasion into southern Romania, and the Romanian military authority became pressured into finding new soldiers for the defensive action.»òerban (1997), p.101; (AUASH 2004), p.176-177 =February Revolution= Romanian soldiers receiving visitors in Darnytsia, 1917 Shortly after these events, Russia experienced the February Revolution, which brought to power a liberal Russian Provisional Government. As a consequence of these, the whole transfer project was delayed,PƒÉrean, [p.2] but the Russian acceptance of self-determination facilitated renewed political action.Gocan, p.11; »òerban (1997), p.101; (2001), p.145-146; (AUASH 2004), p.176 According to veteran Simion Gocan, the soldiers were inspired by both these revolutionary promises and the American entry into World War I, which seemingly made the Wilsonian Self-Determination an official Entente policy.Gocan, p.11 By Order 1191 of , Romania's Minister of War, VintilƒÉ BrƒÉtianu, created the Volunteer Corps as a special formation of the national army.Mamina et al., p.40-41; PƒÉrean, [p.2]; »òerban (2001), p.146 On the same day, in Darnytsia, Pietraru was tasked by Chief of Staff Constantin Prezan with equipping the new recruits and organizing them into units.PƒÉrean, [p.2]; »òerban (2001), p.146 The honorary command was assigned to Constantin CoandƒÉ, who was already the military attach√© with Russia's Stavka (General Headquarters).»òerban (2001), p.146 Over the next month, in Mogilev, CoandƒÉ again negotiated the Corps' recognition by Stavka. CoandƒÉ received the permission, but the number of recruits was no longer clearly specified. On March 18, CoandƒÉ issued a \\"Pledge\\" (Angajament), which regulated the status of Corps soldiers in relation to the Romanian Army, and which the recruits had to sign.PƒÉrean, [p.2-3]; »òerban (2001), p.146 It integrated the former Austro- Hungarian officers into the Romanian Army, with equivalent ranks, and equated their Austrian service, including time they spent in the POW camps, with active duty under Romanian banners.PƒÉrean, [p.2-3] The pledge ended with the words: \\"May God help us, so that through our blood we may liberate our lands and create a Greater Romania, unified in substance and everlasting.\\"PƒÉrean, [p.3] All those who backed out after signing the document were to be considered deserters. Demand for enlistment remained considerable, even though rumor spread that Austro-Hungarian repression forces were by then murdering the families of volunteers and confiscating their property. However, Corps veteran Petru Nemoianu (Nemoian) was later to state that envy and class conflict were also characteristic for the formation, where the intellectual leaders quarreled over the better paid assignments.Nemoianu, p.840-841 In April, Pietraru met with the Provisional Government's Alexander Guchkov, and an agreement was reached regarding the maximum total of troops to be enlisted in the Romanian Corps. Answering to special pleas from Romanian Premier Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu, Guchkov allowed for the recruitment of 30,000 prisoners in his custody.PƒÉrean, [p.3]; »òerban (2001), p.146 The order was revised by Alexander Kerensky, who reduced that number to 5,000 prisoners, noting that they were sorely needed as working hands in Russia's agriculture and industry. In practice, Quartermaster Ivan Pavlovich Romanovsky only allowed recruitment to take place in Moscow Military District, ordering that no more than 1,500 prisoners should be taken into account.PƒÉrean, [p.3, 4] =Darnytsia manifesto= By then, revolutionary examples also inspired the prisoners of Darnytsia to proclaim their own political goals, and openly demand the union of Transylvania with Romania. Their manifesto of , reviewed for publishing by the Transylvanian poet Octavian Goga, was signed by 250 officers and 250 soldiers, and is probably the first unionist statement to be issued by a Transylvanian representative body.PƒÉrean, [p.3]; »òerban (1997), p.101; (2001), p.146-148 The document states: \\"we Romanians, like all other subjugated nations, have grown aware that once and for all that we [...] cannot carry on with our lives within the frame of the Austro-Hungarian state; we [...] demand, with unwavering will, our incorporation into Romania, so that together we may form a single national Romanian state. [...] For the sake of this ideal, we throw in the balance all of what we have, our lives and fortunes, our women and children, our descendants' life and happiness. And we never will stop, lest we vanquish or perish.\\"Gocan, p.12; Mamina et al., p.40 The text, which also survives in slightly different versions, Ivan, Sabin, \\"Cu voluntarii rom√¢ni √Æn Siberia (1917-1920)\\" (\\"With the Romanian Volunteers in Siberia (1917-1920)\\"), in Memoria. Revista G√¢ndirii Arestate, Nr. 30, 2000 included a brief analysis of the international scene. It paid homage to Russia's democratic program, referenced the \\"generous\\" Wilsonian doctrine on self-determination, and looked forward to a congress of \\"blissful, national and democratic states\\".Gocan, p.12-13; »òerban (2001), p.147 The manifesto made ample reference to the activity of \\"traitors\\" to the Transylvanian cause. As Nemoianu later recounted, there was a disguised reference to the PNR, whose moderate leaders, ostensibly loyal to the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, still tried to achieve Austrian devolution.Nemoianu, p.839-840 More leniently, Gocan argued that the PNR at home was \\"deeply terrorized\\" and bound to government by a forcefully signed \\"declaration of loyalty\\". Goga, a civilian refugee in transit through Russia, was supposed to have left Darnytsia with a copy of the appeal. Some argue that he did, and that the subsequent popularization is largely owed to his work as publicist. Such accounts are contradicted by the recollections of another unionist activist, Onisifor Ghibu: \\"[The appeal] was supposed to be handed down to Goga, on his stopover in Darni»õa. For whatever reason Goga stopped for a day in Kiev. In such circumstances I was the one designated to hold it\\".»òerban (2001), p.148 In this version, Ghibu passed it on to Romania's executive, King Ferdinand I and General Prezan. In Russian and French translations, the document was distributed to various institutions: the Provisional Government, the Mossovet, the Petrograd Soviet and the Central Rada.»òerban (2001), p.147-148. See also Gocan, p.11 It was also presented individually to representatives of Russian political life and to the foreign press agencies, and circulated among the national emancipation movements of Czechs, Poles, Serbs and \\"Ruthenians\\". A copy was later taken to the United States by Romania's special delegates Vasile Stoica, Vasile Lucaciu and Ioan Mo»õa, and reprinted in the Romanian American community press.»òerban (2001), p.147. See also Gocan, p.11 According to one account, it was also included in airborne leaflet propaganda dropped over the Austro-Hungarian trenches on the Italian front.Gocan, p.11; »òerban (2001), p.147-148 The Darnytsia soldiers soon gave themselves a special banner, based on the Romanian tricolor, with the added slogan TrƒÉiascƒÉ Rom√¢nia Mare (\\"Long Live Greater Romania\\"). For»õiu, Laura M., \\"Drapelul de la Darni»õa este expus la Muzeul Banatului\\" (\\"The Darni»õa Banner on Display at the Banat Museum\\"), in Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, July 3, 2006 Seven such items were sewn in all, of which one was kept by Banat-born soldier Dimitrie LƒÉzƒÉrel (LƒÉzƒÉrescu). =Arrival in Ia»ôi= Six recruiting commissions were then dispatched from Romania to Russia.Mamina et al., p.40-41; PƒÉrean, [p.3] During May 1917, they received the Romanian volunteers, relocated from Darnytsia to the Girls' Lyc√©e in Podil, where work also began on tailoring of the new Romanian uniforms. From Podil, a newly formed battalion was quickly sent into Romania to reinforce defense. Comprising some 1,300 men,PƒÉrean, [p.3]; »òerban (1997), p.102 this unit traveled by chartered train, stopping first in Kishinev (Chi»ôinƒÉu). The largely Romanian-inhabited Russian city gave them a warm welcome: the battalion received another Romanian tricolor as war flag, and were presented with an Orthodox icon. The battalion arrived in the city of Ia»ôi, Romania's provisional capital, where the volunteers were welcomed as heroes.Mamina et al., p.41; PƒÉrean, [p.3]; »òerban (1997), p.102; (2001), p.148; (AUASH 2004), p.176, 177 On June 9, at Ia»ôi's marching ground, they took their oath and were officially integrated into the Land Forces. The ceremony was attended by King Ferdinand, Premier BrƒÉtianu, General Prezan, by representatives of Entente missions (Alexander Shcherbachov, Henri Mathias Berthelot)PƒÉrean, [p.4]. See also »òerban (1997), p.102 and by ambassadors of neutral countries. Manuel Multedo y Cortina of Spain recalled the sermon as \\"a solemn act\\", clamoring \\"the national aspiration\\" of Romanians.Denize, Eugen, and Oprescu, Paul, \\"1917.

Spain's Envoy Reports: 'National Unity ‚Äî A Reason for Partaking in the War' \\"), in Magazin Istoric, December 1987, p.24 At a later banquet and public rally in Union Square, Victor Deleu addressed the civilian population, describing the Corps' arrival as a rescue mission: \\"We had the duty of coming over here on this day, when you are living through such hardships. We left a foreign country, but did so with just one thought on our minds: coming home. That's why there was only road meant for us, the one leading us ahead. [...] We'll be the victors, for the Carpathians cannot reach as high as our hearts have been elevated!\\" As politician Ion G. Duca recalled, no other speech left as deep an impression on the public: \\"Deleu['s speech] was a pure and simple marvel, something unforgettable.\\" There was a noted effort on the part of Corps staff and other Transylvanian exiles (Ion Ag√¢rbiceanu, Laurian Gabor, Octavian TƒÉslƒÉuanu etc.) to encourage the rapid integration of Podil-formed units into the Romanian line of defense.»òerban (1997), p.103 After a quick session of retraining, the Corps units were attached to the , which was recovering in Ia»ôi. It was, however, decided that the formations, particularly those from Transylvania, were to be kept separated from the rest under the common command structure. An official act of 1918 explained the rationale behind this act: \\"Transylvanians should fight as Transylvanians [...] against the Hungarian state, so as to assert, clearly and beyond all doubt, that the Romanian nationals of the Hungarian state do not recognize its authority. To have fought against Hungary, however the war may end, ought to have been a badge of honor for the Romanian nation in Hungary and a moral reinforcement during the battles to come\\".»òerban (1997), p.103-104 When it was proposed that men from the Corps be assigned noms de guerre so as to avoid execution if captured, Deleu reacted strongly: \\"We intend to be the army of Transylvania! We aim to be the conscience of Transylvania, which is for absolute freedom and The Union! We do not want [to receive] a conquered land, we wish to liberate ourselves with our own forces! Hangings? Let them hang us! But let them be aware that Transylvania herself is fighting for liberty and The Union!\\"»òerban (1997), p.104 =During and after MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti= The Romanian front between November 1916 and January 1917 In July 1917, Corps offices in Kiev circulated the first issue of a recruitment gazette, Rom√¢nia Mare (\\"Greater Romania\\"), which became the essential component of its propaganda effort in Russia.Mamina et al., p.41; PƒÉrean, [p.4]; »òerban (AUASH 2004), passim It was a new edition of the Bucharest gazette founded by Voicu Ni»õescu, and, in this new form, was managed by a team of pro-union activists: the Transylvanians Sever Bocu, Ghi»õƒÉ Popp, Iosif »òchiopu and the Bukovinian Filaret Dobo»ô.»òerban (AUASH 2004), p.177 Rom√¢nia Mare was successful, despite the fact that only between 3,000 and 5,000 copies were published per issue.»òerban (AUASH 2004), p.177-178 Recruitment itself continued at a steady pace, and the Romanian General Staff created Biroul A. B (\\"T[ransylvania] and B[ukovina] Bureau\\") to keep evidence of Austro-Hungarian abjurers, on and behind the front.PƒÉrean, [p.4]; »òerban (1997), p.102 Its founding members were three Second Lieutenants: Deleu, Vasile OsvadƒÉ, Leonte Silion.»òerban (1997), p.102 Biroul A. B. was assisted by a Consultative Commission of intellectuals and politicians of Transylvanian or Bukovinian backgrounds (Goga, Ion Nistor, Leonte Moldovan) and represented in Russia itself by a deputation of Transylvanian officers‚ÄîElie Bufnea, Victor CƒÉdere. Units of the Volunteer Corps earned distinction in the defense of eastern Romania, which postponed the Central Powers' advance during summer 1917. With the 11th Division, the Transylvanians-Bukovinians participated in the battles of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti, Oituz and MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti.Mamina et al., p.41; »òerban (1997), p.104-105; (2001), p.149; (AUASH 2004), p.179-180 At the time, they were split between five regiments of the 11th Division: 2nd, 3rd Olt, 5th Chasseurs, 19th Caracal, 26th Rovine.PƒÉrean, [p.4]; »òerban (1997), p.103; (AUASH 2004), p.179 The three battles to hold back the Central Powers ended in early autumn 1917, by which time there were 31 dead and 453 wounded among the volunteers; 129 received distinction.»òerban (1997), p.105; (AUASH 2004), p.179-180 Dimitrie LƒÉzƒÉrel was one to have survived all three engagements, and legend has it that he never went into combat without the banner. Deleu had left reserve duty to join the 10th Chasseurs Battalion in the MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti combat, but fell severely ill and was reassigned to other offices. The divisive command structure was a disappointment for the Transylvanian and Bukovinian volunteers. In a complaint they sent to King Ferdinand during September, they requested reintegration into a special Corps, arguing: \\"Through such legions the free will of the formerly oppressed citizens would be expressing a common will. One would not be enrolling isolated individuals [...], but an entire people free from the [Austrian] yoke.\\" Like his army staff, the monarch disapproved of this initiative, informing Deleanu and TƒÉslƒÉuanu that, at most, units overseen by Biroul A. B. could expect to form special regiments within the existing divisions.»òerban (1997), p.104-105 Parallel negotiations continued between Russia and Romania over the total number of volunteers allowed to leave Russian soil. During early June, Stavka approved the release of 5,000 Romanian Austro-Hungarian prisoners, all of them from the Moscow Governorate. According to historian Ioan I. »òerban, the approval was creating problems for the Romanian side: of the soldiers in question, the majority were held deep inside Russia, and employed \\"in the agricultural regions and the various industrial centers of southern Russia, the Ural, western Siberia etc.\\" As the MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti battle was waging, the Romanian government called on the Russian leadership to allow yet more recruits to be sent to the front, and received a confirmation of Guchkov's earlier 30,000 directly from Chief of Staff Lavr Kornilov.»òerban (1997), p.103. See also PƒÉrean, [p.4] As a result, two of the recruiting commissions relocated to the Pacific port of Vladivostok, and set in motion a plan for recruiting more volunteers throughout Asiatic Russia.»òerban (2003), p.154 After Kornilov's promise, the Romanian high command took measures of creating a single and distinct division, comprising both those who had passed through Podil and those refugees already in Romanian service. Biroul A. B. was replaced by a Central Service, answering to General Staff.»òerban (1997), p.105 In early December 1917, the Corps was reformed a final time, as a division- sized formation.

However, the Kornilov order came too late in the war for there to have been a more significant Transylvanian-Bukovinian contribution to the Romanian effort.»òerban (1997), p.105-106 =October Revolution and Romanian truce= Bolshevik rally at a train station in either Romania or Bessarabia (1917). Romanian soldiers watching from the side The October Revolution shook Russia and placed most of it under a Bolshevik government which had no intention of continuing with war against the Central Powers. Although the Romanian presence in Kiev was set back by the November Uprising and the January Rebellion,Cazacu, p.112 then dispersed by the anti-Entente Skoropadsky regime,Bodea, p.67 Constantin Gh. Pietraru and a small force remained behind in the new Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR), where they signed up the last group of Romanian volunteers. Some of these efforts were hampered by a diplomatic tensions between the UNR and Romania. Ukrainian officials refused to either rally with the Entente or negotiate border treaties with Romania, but tacitly permitted Deleu, Bocu, Ghibu and other Transylvanian Romanians activists who worked against Austria-Hungary to work on UNR territory.»òerban (1997), p.106-111 Rom√¢nia Mare gazette, which still had Bocu as chief editorial manager, closed down in December 1917, having published 23 issues in all.Mamina et al., p.41; »òerban (AUASH 2004), p.177, 178 By then, Ion Ag√¢rbiceanu and family had left their temporary home in Yelisavetgrad for H√¢rlƒÉu, where he became the Corps' chaplain.

As Romania faced indecision about its future, the Corps was still the subject of unionist propaganda, spread by Romanian intellectuals in the capitals of Entente nations. From his temporary home in France, Bocu reestablished Rom√¢nia Mare as the tribune of Romanian diaspora politics and unionist aspirations.Bodea, p.68; »òerban (1997), p.111; (Apulum 2004), p.363; (AUASH 2004), p.182 He was joined there by Octavian Goga, who had crossed over Bolshevik territory and Finland with false papers, claiming to be a Volunteer Corps veteran.Bodea, passim Legacy =Diaspora units and the cut-off troops= By spring 1918, Transylvanian-Bukovinian prisoners held in France and Italy proceeded to form their own abjurers' units, based upon the existing Romanian Corps.Mamina et al., p.41-43; PƒÉrean, [p.4]; »òerban (1997), p.110-111; (Apulum 2004), p.359 Luciano (Lucian) Ferigo became Commander of the newly formed Romanian Legion in Italy (Legione Romena d'Italia) which took its ceremonial flag from the Regio Esercito on July 28 and contributed the Austrians' defeat at Vittorio Veneto.

The 135 who signed up in October 1918 were put off by the refusal of French officials to recognize their Austro- Hungarian officer's ranks.»òerban (Apulum 2004), p.362 Their unit was attached to the French Foreign Legion, to be joined by the various other categories of Romanian recruits, but the effort was stopped midway; in November, the Entente's victory over Germany ended World War I for both France and Romania.»òerban (Apulum 2004), p.362-365 As the dissolution of Austria-Hungary was taking effect in October 1918, other such units were spontaneously formed on Austrian territory, mainly from rogue components of the Imperial Army. The Romanian Legion of Prague helped the Czechoslovak National Council and the Sokols gain the upper hand during an anti-Austrian uprising, while other Romanian units were breaking away from Austrian command in Vienna.Mamina et al., p.44-45 Romanians also formed a distinct segment of the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine personnel who rioted on the Austrian Littoral and elsewhere in the Adriatic.Mamina et al., p.46 A more complex situation reigned in Russia. As early as April 1918, some Romanian volunteer groups joined up with the Bolshevik Red Army, taking their orders from Commissar B√©la Kun, but some of their members continued to serve the nationalist cause.Bodea, p.67, 68 In June 1918, a number of Romanian prisoners who had signed up for the Volunteer Corps were cut off from Romania by the Russian Civil War and left to fend for themselves. Some crossed into Bolshevik Russia hoping to be repatriated together with the Romanian consulate, while others took to areas controlled by the White movement, reaching Irkutsk; still others escaped through northern routes into Sweden.»òerban (Apulum 2004), p.358 The various groups were monitored by French public opinion, and plans were drafted to merge them into the Romanian Legion on the Western Front,»òerban (Apulum 2004), p.357-358 or even to have them open up a new Eastern Front. Meanwhile, in tandem with larger Serb and Czech national units, Romanian prisoners on the Trans-Siberian Railway were involved in creating new armed formations. Their original goal was to show to the Entente that Romanians were still eager to fight against the Central Powers, but the Romanians also defended the line in skirmishes with the Bolshevik or anarchist cells.»òerban (2003), p.153-154, 156-157 They resisted especially when the Bolshevik Russian government asked them to surrender all weapons. =\\"Horia\\" Regiment and Romanian Legion of Siberia= Czechoslovak Legion in Russia Some prisoners or drifting units in Russia joined up with new arrivals from Kiev. They created the 1,300-strong battalion of Kinel, which was effectively a subunit of the Czechoslovak Legions.»òerban (2003), p.153 Romanian officers' clubs were organizing themselves in lands held by the Komuch Democrats and the White Russian Siberian Autonomy. The original force to emerge from such schemes was formed at Samara by Valeriu Milovan. Criticized for his eccentric idea of imitating egalitarian Bolshevik practices and doing away with military ranks, he also sparked a conflict when he arrested the more conservative officer Voicu Ni»õescu. Ni»õescu escaped imprisonment and fled to Chelyabinsk, but support for his cause continued to be eroded by the privates' growing support for the Bolsheviks.»òerban (2003), p.154-155 As a result of Ni»õescu's activity, supported by Gocan and Nicolae Nedelcu, Dr. iur.,Gocan, p.13 Romanian loyalists in Chelyabinsk created a \\"Horia\\" Battalion (or Regiment).Cazacu, p.113-114; »òerban (2003), p.158-159 Major Ioan D√¢mbu was assigned to lead it, and, under Czechoslovak orders, the new MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti and Reserve battalions were sent on mission to other localities.»òerban (2003), p.158-159 At the time, the two recruiting commissions in Vladivostok were also reactivated by the arrival of an international anti-Bolshevik force. Their propaganda leaflets, drafted by Bukovinian Iorgu G. Toma, reached all 40 POW camps in the region, urging any volunteer to make his own way to Chelyabinsk.»òerban (2003), p.154, 157-158, 161 That city emerged as a main site of Romanian political and military activity, with a reported population of 3,000 liberated Romanians (July 1918). Major D√¢mbu put a momentary stop to Bolshevik influence by arresting Milovan and ordering the Samaran unit to Chelyabinsk. A complex set of sanctions were imposed, in the hope of curbing dissent, ranks were reintroduced, uniforms on the Romanian Land Forces model were distributed around, and a patriotic cultural section began to function.»òerban (2003), p.158-161 Taking a long and perilous journey, Elie Bufnea and some other officers of the original Darnytsia Corps joined up with \\"Horia\\" in mid autumn, at a moment when the Romanian soldiers were celebrating the breakup of Austria-Hungary.»òerban (2003), p.161-163. See also Gocan, p.13-14 The union between \\"Horia\\" and various new arrivals from the western Siberian camps became a second Volunteer Corps, grouping as many as 5,000 volunteers.Cazacu, p.114, 116-117; »òerban (2003), p.161 Through the alliance it formed with the anti-Bolshevik Czechoslovak Legions, it was a Romanian national contribution to the international coalition, but reluctantly so.Cazacu, passim; »òerban (1997), p.109, 111; »òerban (2003), passim Once relocated to Irkutsk and Omsk in late 1918, the volunteers expressed their lack of interest in fighting against the Bolsheviks: after rebelling against Colonel Kadlec, their Czech technical adviser, the Corps was placed under Maurice Janin of the French Mission.Cazacu, p.115-116 A Romanian Legion of Siberia was formed from this structure, but only 3,000 soldiers still volunteered in its ranks‚Äî2,000 others were progressively transferred out of the combat zone, shipped out to Romania or taken back to prisoner of war camps.Cazacu, p.117 As »òerban notes, the Western Front victory had opened the way for Transylvania's union, and \\"their only thought was to regain, as fast as possible, their families and their places of origin\\". A special case was that of Bolshevik sympathizers: in October, D√¢mbu was killed by his own soldiers, partly in retaliation for Milovan's arrest.»òerban (2003), p.155 The combative Legion defended the Trans- Siberian between Tayshet and Nizhneudinsk, where they forced the Bolsheviks into a truce and established their reputation for brutality with the nickname Dikaya Divizia (–î–∏–∫–∞—è –î–∏–≤–∏–∑–∏—è, \\"Wild Division\\").Cazacu, p.117-118 The anti- Bolshevik formation and the Romanian non-combatants were eventually retrieved from the Russian Far East upon the end of foreign intervention, and were fully repatriated with the other Romanians from May 1920.»òerban (1997), p.109; (2001), p.149; (2003), p.145; (Apulum 2004), p.358 Milovan, court-martialled by the Legion, was cleared of the charges by a higher authority; however, those who killed D√¢mbu were sentenced as mutineers and assassins. =Late echoes= The original Volunteers' Corps went out of service in December 1918, soon after German defeat and Transylvania's de facto union (see Great Union Day). The Romanian volunteers' rally in support of self-determination was judged by some Romanian authors as a direct predecessor of Alba Iulia's \\"Great National Assembly\\", whereby union was being endorsed on Wilsonian principles. They call the Corps' April 26 meeting a \\"1st Alba Iulia\\".Nemoianu, p.840; »òerban (1997), p.101; (2001), p.146-147 Within Transylvania itself, opinion was more divided. Shortly before the Hungarian‚ÄìRomanian War erupted, members of Corps were required to present themselves for reenlistment. The old rivals from within the Romanian National Party, who led the Directory Council of Transylvania after 1918, allegedly refused to welcome the Corps back as a single unit, and plans for its mobilization had to be dropped.Nemoianu, p.840 A new \\"Horia\\" Volunteer Corps was reportedly formed on the Cri»ôul Alb River, as a first line of defense against the Hungarian Soviet Republic. Tr. M., \\"O zi istoricƒÉ. - Suveranii la »öebea »ôi povestea celor doi legionari ai lui Avram Iancu\\" (\\"An Historic Day. - The Royals at »öebea and the Story of Two Avram Iancu Legionaries\\"), in Rom√¢nul (Arad), Nr. 32/1919, p.1 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) In 1923, the old Corps set up a veterans' association, the Union of Volunteers, which carried the reputation of being a fascist-inspired section of the PNR. Petru Nemoianu strongly dismissed the accounts as \\"enormities\\", and stated that the Union had good cause to reject the PNR for its handling of the Transylvanian issue.Nemoianu, p.838, 840-841 More sympathetic to the PNR, Simion Gocan was President of the Union in Bihor County, and complained about tensions with Nemoianu.Gocan, p.13-14 The Union even ran for Transylvanian seats in Parliament during the 1931 general election. It formed an electoral cartel with Nicolae Iorga's Democratic Nationalist Party and against PNR's successors (the National Peasants' Party), but was only assigned non-eligible positions on the electoral lists. P., \\"Guvernul 'Uniunei Na»õionale' trage pe sfoarƒÉ U.F.V. din Ardeal\\" (\\"The 'National Union' Government Pulls One on the Transylvanian UFV\\"), in Chemarea Tinerimei Rom√¢ne, Nr. 21/1931, p.4 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) All praise for the Corps' contributions was toned down between 1948 and 1989, when Romania was a communist state. According to »òerban, communist historiography presented the story \\"superficially, usually truncated or in the context of other events\\".»òerban (2001), p.145 During the first wave of communization, repression touched several figures once associated with the Corps: Bufnea, »òtefƒÉnescu, Alex., \\"Scriitori aresta»õi (1944-1964) (II)\\" (\\"Arrested Writers (1944-1964)\\") , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 24/2005 Sever Bocu (beaten to death in Sighet prison), Ungureanu, Cornel, \\"Poetul »ôi capitalele literaturii\\" (\\"The Poet and Literary Capitals\\") , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 12/2009 Ghi»õƒÉ Popp. \\"Popp, Gheorghe (Ghi»õƒÉ)- un 'memorandist' al epocii comuniste\\" (\\"Gheorghe (Ghi»õƒÉ) Popp - A 'Memorandum Activist' of the Communist Epoch\\") , in Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, November 18, 2006 Interest in the Volunteer Corps' activity was only revived after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Among the relics left behind by the Corps is Dimitrie LƒÉzƒÉrel's banner, probably the only one of seven to have survived. In 1923, LƒÉzƒÉrel paraded it at the Volunteers' Union reunion in Arad.Nemoianu, p.841 Referred to as the Darni»õa Banner, it was donated to a local church, then exhibited by the Museum of Banat, Timi»ôoara.

The aircraft was on a domestic flight from London Northolt Airport with 31 passengers and 4 crew on board. Twenty-four of the passengers and three crew members died in the accident. Aircraft The Vickers Type 610 Viking 1B airliner, powered by two Bristol Hercules 634 14-cylinder radial engines, was registered G-AJDL with manufacturer's serial number 262. It was delivered to British European Airways in March 1949. Originally named Vortex by the airline, it was renamed Lord St Vincent around 1951. Accident G-AJDL left Northolt at 7:27, about 25 minutes late. Two hours later it was on approach to Nutts Corner. When the aircraft was out from the runway threshold it was above the glideslope. The aircraft then rapidly lost height and hit the pole supporting an approach light a short distance from the aerodrome. Following the initial impact the aircraft hit further poles; it then hit a mobile standard beam approach van before striking a brick building housing equipment operating the instrument landing system about from the runway. This impact caused the aircraft to break up. There was a slight fire after the accident. Investigation A board of inquiry was formed to investigate the accident, chaired by David Scott Cairns, QC. It opened in London on 14 April 1953. After hearing evidence, the board concluded that the pilot, Captain Hartley, made \\"errors of judgement\\" but that no moral blame was to be attached to him regarding the accident. The board mentioned that hitting the van stopped any chance of the aircraft reaching the runway, and then hitting the building made a tragedy inevitable. The approach lights were found to not be at the top of the poles, to ease maintenance; although that was not judged a factor in the crash, the lights were moved to the top of the poles following the accident. It was also recommended that when the ILS building was rebuilt that it should be offset from the approach path, or that it should be sited underground.

He played high school basketball in the Chicago metropolitan area for Downers Grove South High School. Subsequently, he starred for the Princeton Tigers men's basketball team, where he was a two-time Ivy League Men's Basketball Player of the Year (1990 and 1991) and three-time first team All- Ivy League player (1989, 1990 and 1991) as a center. He was also a two-time Academic All-America selection. As an All-Ivy League performer, he led his team to three consecutive Ivy League Championships and NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournaments. He matriculated to Princeton University, after an injury late in his senior year caused other Division I schools to withdraw their offers. , he continues to rank second and fourth in school history in career assists (381) and points (1546), respectively. He led the team in rebounds all four seasons and in points, assists and blocked shots three times each. He led the Ivy League in field goal percentage three times and ranks third all-time in Princeton history in that statistic for his career. The team earned three consecutive Ivy League championships during his career, including an undefeated conference record during his senior season. Despite the team's success and his individual accolades, his Princeton tenure was punctuated by three NCAA Tournament first round losses by a total of seven points, most notably the March 17, 1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament first round 50-49 loss to the number-one seeded Georgetown Hoyas team featuring Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo as well as 1989 Big East Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year Charles Smith. After his collegiate career ended, Mueller played professional basketball in Switzerland. Then he returned to Chicago, where he became a hedge fund trader. In Chicago, he has played amateur 3-on-3 basketball with other Ivy League athletes at national competitions. High school Mueller attended Downers Grove South High School. As a freshman, he led the sophomore team with 18 points per game. He came off the bench for the varsity team as a sophomore to average 10 points per game as a forward. He grew and prior to his junior season and became a center. As a junior, his outside shot was still undeveloped, but he averaged 20 points and 10 rebounds, leading his team to the 1986 Des Plaines Valley League championship and a second straight trip to the sectional finals. The team was ranked in the Chicago Sun-Times Super 25 for a couple of weeks during the season. He was benched for one game in early March of his junior year for disciplinary reasons by coach Dick Flaiz. The Chicago Sun-Times named him the MVP of the league. Mueller also played varsity tennis as a junior. Following the school year, he played in the suburban summer basketball league at Triton College in River Grove, Illinois. As a senior, he was his team's only returning varsity letterman, and was ranked by the Chicago Sun-Times among the preseason top 50 Metro Chicago basketball players. Off The Glass, a national basketball magazine, ranked him among the 19 best basketball players in the state of Illinois, along with Walter Bond, Marcus Liberty, Brian Banks and Rodell Davis. At the beginning of December of his senior season, the team was ranked 23rd in the Chicago Sun-Times' Metro Chicago top 25, and there was talk of the team improving on the 23-6 record of the prior year. He led the West Suburban Conference in scoring and rebounding most of the season and was an All-Conference selection. Mueller posted his career-high 45 points on March 3, 1987 in an 83-47 victory against Montini High School. By the end of his senior season, he was one of the 20 All-Chicago Area selections by the Chicago Sun- Times, in a class that included Eric Anderson, Bond, Liberty and Sam Mack, after averaging 23 points and 14 rebounds. However, unlike Anderson, Liberty and Bond, he was not one of the 9 area All-State nominees. Mueller, who scored 1290 out of 1600 on his SAT and a 31 on his ACT, was a highly recruited high school basketball player. However, by early March 1987, he had not signed a National Letter of Intent as a commitment to any school. At that time, he was keeping a pair of piranhas at home in an aquarium and accidentally injured his left foot by breaking the aquarium's glass. The resulting injury caused severe damage to his leg including a severed achilles tendon; he had surgery to repair the damage in late March. Division I schools like Northwestern University withdrew their scholarship offers; however, Princeton maintained an interest, with supporters like John Rogers behind him. As most of his scholarship offers were withdrawn, he began to focus on schools that could provide him an academic opportunity in the event that his basketball career was over. He eventually matriculated to Princeton unsure of whether he would ever play competitive basketball again. College As a freshman, Mueller helped the 1987‚Äì88 Tigers win their final three games in March to finish the season with a 17-9 (9-5 Ivy League) record. He posted 25 points in the March 1, 1988 67-65 victory against . Then, two games later in the final game of the season on March 5, he added 22 in 79-58 victory over league champion . He finished the season as the Ivy League statistical champion in field goal percentage for the first of three times. He led the team in rebounds and blocked shots. Mueller began his career wearing the number 55, but switched to 00 by his sophomore year. During his sophomore season, the 1988‚Äì89 team earned a #1 vs. #16 matchup in the first round of the 1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament with their Pete Carril-coached princeton offense. The New York Times reported that the matchup seemed comical to some even though Carill had a system that frustrated many offensive systems and had already produced upsets. In the St. Patrick's Day Georgetown game, the 16th-seeded Tigers were 23 point underdogs according to the Las Vegas bookmakers and Dick Vitale had promised to serve as a Tiger ballboy if they won. Entering the game, the last four Ivy League representatives in the tournament had lost in the first round by an average of 35 points. During the game, Mueller's defensive assignment was Mourning, and he contributed 9 points and 8 assists to Princeton's 49-point effort. During the game, Mueller played beyond the foul line on the offensive end, forcing Mourning to leave passing lanes open for back-door attacks. Although the strategy enabled Princeton to stay in the game, Mourning had seven blocked shots, including two in the final fifteen seconds. Mueller's final shot was deflected by Mourning, which is remembered by Princeton fans as an uncalled foul. The team finished with a 19-8 (11-3) record. Later in the same tournament, Duke would use Christian Laettner at the top of the key, like Princeton had used Mueller, and eliminate Georgetown by shutting down Mourning. The Princeton-Georgetown game is regarded as one of only a handful of close #1 vs. #16 matchups in NCAA tournament history. For the season, he repeated as Ivy League field goal percentage champion. He was a first-team All-Ivy honoree. He led the team in points, rebounds, assists and blocked shots. As a junior, Mueller led the 1989‚Äì90 Tigers to a repeat Ivy League championship as the Ivy League Player of the Year. The team earned a 13 seed for the 1990 NCAA Tournament. The team finished with a 20-7 (11-3) record after losing to the Arkansas Razorbacks by a 68-64 margin. Mueller was one of only six Tigers to appear in the game and led the team with 19 points. As a junior, Mueller earned a third team Academic All-America recognition from College Sports Information Directors of America. He was a first-team All-Ivy performer as well as Ivy League Player of the Year. He led the team in points, rebounds, and assists. In a February 23, 1991, game against , Mueller earned his current position as Princeton's second all-time leading scorer one night after the 1990‚Äì91 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team had clinched its third consecutive Ivy League championship with a victory over . The team went undefeated in the Ivy League and earned a birth in the 1991 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. After its strong tournament performances in the prior two seasons and strong regular season, the team earned a number 8 seed, which was a record for the highest seed by an Ivy League school at the time. The team had another close but disappointing loss, this time by a 50-48 margin to Villanova, finishing with a 24-3 (14-0) record. That year, senior Mueller served as team captain, and earned first team Academic All-America honors. That season marked the third year that Mueller led the team in points, assists and blocked shots and fourth time he led the team in rebounds. For the season, he earned his third Ivy League field goal percentage championship. He repeated as Ivy League Player of the Year and was a first-team All-Ivy performer for the third consecutive season. He remains prominent in the Princeton basketball record books. When Mueller ended his career, his 1546 career points trailed only Bill Bradley and his 381 career assists were also second in school history. His single-season assist totals of 140 in 1989-90 and 128 in 1990-91 remain second and fourth in school history. Only one other Tiger has totalled 11 assists in a game (a feat Mueller achieved three times). His career 59.5 field goal percentage is third in school history, as is his sophomore single-season rate of 64.9%. A 2009 publication by ESPN ranked him among the five greatest basketball players in Princeton history. On March 19, 2012, Doug Davis surpassed Mueller for second place on the Princeton scoring list. On March 1, 2013, Ian Hummer passed him as well. Post graduate After graduation, Mueller played professional basketball in Switzerland. He then became a professional hedge fund trader, and has played in competitive 3-on-3 basketball leagues with various combinations of Ivy League athletes including Arne Duncan, Craig Robinson, Mitch Henderson and Rogers in the mid to late 1990s and early 2000s. The mid-1990s versions of the team were Chicago area champions. In 1998, he won a 3-on-3 tournament in Dallas with Rogers and Robinson. Both the 2001 and 2003 versions of the team, named \\"Slow and Steady\\", qualified for national competition. The 2003 team with Duncan, Robinson, Henderson and Brian Earl made the national championship.

It typically has a bright colour and is served in crystal or any other glasses or cups. Azerbaijanis often use traditional armudu (pear-shaped) glass. Tea is served continuously when there are guests or when there is an interesting conversation. For Azerbaijanis tea with milk is uncommon. According to a common belief, drinking tea with lump sugar instead of sand sugar comes from the medieval period, when rulers who were afraid of being poisoned checked their tea by dunking a piece of sugar in a beverage (it was believed that the poison would react to the sugar). Traditional tea is served with lemon, cube sugar, sweets and fruit desserts (not jam). Sometimes thyme, mint or rose water is added, which is believed to be good for the stomach and heart.

Tea in Azerbaijan is also served during matchmaking. After the negotiations by matchmakers are complete, the maid will bring out tea. If the tea is served without sugar, that is a sign that the chances for marriage agreement are very low; conversely, if tea is served with sugar, it means that there will be a wedding. Azerbaijanis say about tea ‚Äú√áay n…ôdir, say n…ôdir‚Äù which can be translated as ‚Äúwhen you drink tea, the cup count doesn't matter‚Äù and means that tea is something almost ‚Äúsacred‚Äù in Azerbaijan. Chaykhana Azerbaijani people may drink tea in traditional tea houses called chaykhana. Men sit in a chaykhana, playing backgammon (nard), reading newspapers and drinking tea.Azerbaijan. David C. King Historically, Azeri women did not go to public places, so chaykhana used to be a place for men.The Azerbaijani Turks: power and identity under Russian rule. Audrey L. Altstadt  Modern history  Historically, tea production used to be one of main industries in Azerbaijan. Although the first tea bushes were commercially grown in Azerbaijan as early as 1912, tea-growing gained commercial value in the 1930s under Soviet rule. In 1934, specialists from Moscow visited Lankaran and took samples of the soil. They analyzed the samples and found that Lankaran is one of the most fructuous areas for tea growing. Since that time, tea factories have been operating in Lankaran and neighbouring regions. From then on, Lankaran became the main area in Azerbaijan for the cultivation of rice, tea, citrus fruit and vegetables. In the 1980s, tea-production peaked up in Soviet Azerbaijan. Approximately, 34-38,000 tonnes of tea leaves were harvested annually in that time. However, tea production decreased as a result of the fall of the former Soviet Union. In 2007-2008, less than 500 tonnes were harvested and it was the lowest point.  Tea drinking traditions  In Azerbaijan, people drink tea from the special glass called ‚Äúarmudu‚Äù (literally pear-like glass). The shape of Armudu glass is similar to a pear and is associated with the figure of a hostess in Azerbaijani culture. It is believed that the classic shape of Armudu represents the ideal figure of an Eastern woman or an 18 year old Azerbaijani girl. Tea is served with various delicious sweets, fruit jam and sliced lemon.  Samovar tea  In Azerbaijan, people boil water in heated metal containers known as samovars. Archaeologist Tufan Akhundov found a pottery samovar, possibly up to 3,600 years old, in Sheki a town located at the foothills of the Caucasus.

Interchangeable centre sections allowed it to be configured either as a sailplane or a shorter span secondary (advanced training) glider. Only one was completed. Design and development Named for design lead Reginald Foster Dagnall, the all-wood R.F.D. 2's unusual dual span cantilever wing had outer sections with constant chord, slight sweep, blunt tips and full width ailerons, joined by a choice of two rectangular centre sections. The sailplane centre section was about 15 ft (4.57 m) long, reduced to about 5 ft (1.52 m) for the secondary trainer role. The wing was not fitted with flaps or airbrakes. The fuselage of the R.F.D. 2 was a flat-sided monocoque with the wing mounted directly on top of it. The single seat open cockpit was immediately ahead of the wing leading edge. The main landing skid ran from the nose to about mid-chord and there was a small tail skid. The triangular tailplane, mounted on top of the fuselage, and curved fin were both small but carried generous, curved edged control surfaces.

Biography Jan (Joan, Johannes) van Noordt was one of four sons of the schoolteacher and carilloneur Sibrand van Noordt. The family hailed from the North Holland town of Schagen, where Jan was born in 1623, and moved to Amsterdam in the late 1630s, taking a house on the Rusland. Jan's brothers Jacobus and Anthonie became the most prominent organists in the city, gaining posts in various churches, including the Oude Kerk and the Nieuwezijds Kapel. Jan appears already to have started training in Amsterdam well before 1640, under Jacob Adriaensz. Backer, as he contributed to paintings from that year such as Jesus and the Samaritan Woman in Middelburg, and David and Bathsheba in a private collection in Tokyo. Jan studied alongside Abraham van den Tempel and would remain friends with him and his brother Jacob, a textile merchant. As an independent artist Van Noordt turned his attention to genre themes, especially the pastoral scenes that had become fashionable in Dutch art. In the late 1650s he started to draw portrait patronage, and this evidently allowed him to return to history painting. In the course of the 1660s his style shifted from the dynamic elegance studied from Backer to a ripe and robust style drawing mainly on the Flemish painter Jacob Jordaens, who had recently carried out major commissions in Amsterdam. During these years he taught Johannes Voorhout, among other artists. His production declined after 1672, owing to the general economic downturn in the wake of the Triple Invasion of 1672. He remained a bachelor, and was sharing quarters with his brother Anthonie in 1670. In 1674 he gave his address as the Bloemgracht in the Jordaan district of Amsterdam in 1674, and gave up a small studio nearby on the Egelantiersgracht in 1675. A signed and dated Rest on the Flight into Egypt of 1676 is the last recorded trace of him. References *David de Witt, Jan van Noordt (1623-after 1676), Painter of History and Portraits in Amsterdam.

The line was electrified on 27 August 1984 at 25 kW 50 Hz, and was equipped with the restrained permissivity automatic blocking system, which since the 1990s has offered increasingly unsatisfactory operating conditions with respect to the increasing mixed passenger and goods traffic on the line. Route The Amiens‚ÄìRouen railway begins near the Gare de Saint-Roch (Somme) in Amiens, where it branches off the railway from Amiens to Boulogne. It runs in generally southwestern direction, passing through Poix-de-Picardie, Abancourt and Serqueux until it reaches its terminus in Rouen. A branch line from Gare de Mont√©rolier-Buchy to Saint-Sa√´ns has been closed and removed. =Main stations= The main stations on the Amiens‚ÄìRouen railway are: * Gare d'Amiens * Gare d'Abancourt * Gare de Serqueux * Gare de Rouen-Rive-Droite Use One of the peculiarities of this line is the role of freight traffic, which is far more important than passenger traffic. In 1992-93, this line saw transport of 8,000 tonnes of goods daily, 60% of it in the Amiens - Rouen direction. The importance of the freight traffic is explained by the industrial importance of the two regions linked by the line and in particular by the ports of Rouen and Le Havre at the Rouen end. On the other hand, passenger demand is not strong but tends to be focussed by the express TER Rouen - Amiens - Arras - Douai - Lille axis. The Amiens‚ÄìRouen railway is used by TER Hauts-de-France and TER Normandie regional passenger services on the whole line. The typical daily service (2019) sees five passenger trains in each direction, two of which are extended to/from Lille.

They also abolished age restrictions, allowing the then 69-year old President Obiang to run when he turned 75. The changes were hailed by the government as a democratic advance, with the addition of term limits highlighted by state media. They would also allow the president to create the post of Vice President, suspected to be given to Obiang's son, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, then under investigation in the United States and France for money laundering. Conduct Many denounced the referendum as fake, with many widespread cases of voter fraud and intimidation of groups trying to monitor the votes. They also pointed to the fact that votes were counted by those close to the government. Opposition leader Pl√°cido Mic√≥ Abogo claimed that the proposal was not even seen the official text of the constitutional changes. He removed poll watchers after threats of violence, including one of a young supporter who alleged he \\"was threatened with being tortured by a colonel.\\" Despite these reports, the government claimed the vote had passed peacefully.

She was the daughter of the Catherine of K√ºstrin (1549‚Äì1602) and Elector of Joachim Frederick of Brandenburg.  Life  On 5 November 1609 she married Duke John Frederick of W√ºrttemberg (1582‚Äì1628), eldest son of Frederick I and Sibylla of Anhalt. On the occasion of this marriage he had the Urach Palace in Bad Urach renovated: the Golden Hall was constructed, which is today one of the most beautiful Renaissance ballrooms in Germany. They reportedly had a very happy marriage. Her husband died in 1628. In 1630, she began an extensive renovation of Brackenheim Castle, which was promised to her as her wittum. The castle contained an art room with 155 paintings, at the time the second largest collection in W√ºrttemberg. The art room was well preserved until her death, despite the Thirty Years' War ravaging the country around it. During the renovation of her castle, she lived at Schloss Kirchheim Castle in Kirchheim unter Teck and in Stuttgart. She never lived in Brackenheim, despite the Castle, the city and the district forming her wittum. Nevertheless, she was considered a benefactor of the city, due to her dedication to the city during the Thirty Years' War and to the foundations she founded. When her husband died, her 14-year-old son Eberhard III was still a minor and his uncle Louis Frederick, Duke of W√ºrttemberg-Montb√©liard acted as regent. After Frederick Louis died on 26 January 1631, the regency was taken up by Sophie Barbara and Julius Frederick, Duke of W√ºrttemberg-Weiltingen, with Sophie Barbara being \\"high regent\\". She therefore moved back to Stuttgart in 1632 and became politically active. After the Battle of Lutzen in late 1632, Julius Frederick joined the war on the Swedish side. His goal was to drive enemy troops out of the country, as well as the Catholic former owners of secularized church properties. Despite his successes, he was accused of acting selfishly. The councillors and the Estates managed to drive him out of the regency. After Emperor Ferdinand II declared Eberhard III to be an adult, he took up government on 8 May 1633. He joined the Protestant Heilbronn League which on suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of N√∂rdlingen of 6 September 1634. W√ºrttemberg was then looted and pillaged. Duke Eberhard and his entire court hastily fled into exile in Strasbourg. Barbara Sophia died in Strasbourg in 1636 and was buried in the Stiftskirche, Stuttgart.  Issue  From their marriage Barbara Sophia had the following children: * Henrietta (1610‚Äì1623) * Frederick (1612-1612) * Antonia (1613‚Äì1679) * Eberhard III (1614‚Äì1674), Duke of W√ºrttemberg, married *# in 1637 Wild-Rhinegravine Anna Catherine of Salm-Kyrburg (1614‚Äì1655) *# in 1656 Countess Maria Dorothea of Oettingen (1639‚Äì1698) * Frederick (1615‚Äì1682), Duke of W√ºrttemberg-Neuenstadt *# married in 1653 Princess Clara Augusta of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel (1632‚Äì1700) * Ulrich (1617‚Äì1671), Duke of W√ºrttemberg- Neuenb√ºrg, married *# in 1647 Countess Sophia Dorothea of Solms-Sonnewalde (1622‚Äì1648) *# in 1651 Princess Isabella d'Arenberg (1623‚Äì1678) * Anna Johanna (1619‚Äì1679) * Sibylle (1620‚Äì1707) *# married in 1647 Duke Leopold Frederick of W√ºrttemberg-Montb√©liard (1624‚Äì1662)  References  * Wolfram Angerbauer: Schloss Brackenheim als Witwensitz der Herrschaft W√ºrttemberg, in: Zeitschrift des Zaberg√§uvereins, vol. 1, 1980, p. 1-4 * Kat: Das unbekannte Altbekannte, K√ºnstler sehen das historische Zaberg√§u, Brackenheim, 2004, p. 5  External links  * Category:1584 births Category:1636 deaths Category:People from Halle (Saale) Category:Duchesses of W√ºrttemberg Category:House of Hohenzollern Category:17th-century German people Category:Burials at Stiftskirche, Stuttgart Category:17th-century women rulers ","title":"Barbara Sophie of Brandenburg"},{"id":"33639632","text":"Imamzadeh Ja'far or Emamzadeh Ja'far () may refer to: *Emamzadeh Jafar, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, a village in Iran *Emamzadeh Jafar Rural District, in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province, Iran *Imamzadeh Ja'far, Borujerd, a tomb in Iran *Pishva, a city in Iran ","title":"Imamzadeh Ja'far"},{"id":"33639642","text":"Michael G.

He was the author of a number of law books and also founded the predecessor of the School of Law at Tulane University. Biography Gustavus Schmidt was born in Mariestad in V√§stra G√∂taland County, Sweden. He was educated at the classical school in J√∂nk√∂pings, where his father, Hans Kristian Schmidt, was a judge of the Aulic Council for the south of Sweden. In 1810 he entered the Swedish Royal Navy. In 1815 he settled on the eastern shore of Maryland, where he was engaged as a private tutor. Five years later he went to Richmond, Virginia where he studied law and after being admitted to the Virginia State Bar, practiced the legal profession for a number of years. Among the important cases with which he was connected was that of Jose Murando, Jose Hilario Casares, and Felix Barbieto, three Spaniards charged with piracy and murder on board the brig Crawford. He was assigned as counsel for the defendants by Chief Justice John Marshall, to whom he had been introduced by his elder brother, Karl Kristian Schmidt (1792-1872). His brother was a prominent Swedish Jurist and was also the editor-in-chief of the leading law journal of Sweden. The two brothers corresponded frequently throughout their lives. The case of the brig Crawford created an unusual sensation, owing to the horrible nature of the crime. Subsequently, Schmidt published A Brief Sketch of the Occurrences on board the Brig Crawford (Richmond, 1827). In 1829, Schmidt moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, where he met and married Melanie Seghers, (1804-1836). She was the daughter of Dominique Seghers (1767-1848), a prominent attorney who had immigrated with his family from Brussels in 1807. Schmidt established himself in the legal profession and in New Orleans society. He was associated with Henry Clay as co-counsel for the heirs of Claude Joseph Villars Dubreuil (1689-1757) in their suit for the recovery of the land on which the United States Mint stood. His knowledge of the Spanish language led to his selection by the merchants of New Orleans to look after their interests in Mexico. Subsequently, he was sent to Havana, Cuba to supervise the details of certain contracts between investment banker James Robb (1814-1881) and the Spanish authorities in Cuba. James Robb had established the first gas-works for lighting the city of Havana. Works In 1844, Schmidt founded the Louisiana Law School in New Orleans which was one of the predecessors of the Tulane University School of Law. In 1842, Schmidt had begun a series of lectures on civil law, which he continued for three winters. These lectures have been pointed to as a precursor of the Tulane University Law School. He also founded and edited the short-lived Louisiana Law Journal from 1841 to 1843. He published weekly reviews of the decisions of the Louisiana Supreme Court in The Daily True Delta for years, and made contributions to periodicals. He wrote The Civil Law of Spain and Mexico, with Notes and References (New Orleans, 1851). At his death, he left a library with over 1,000 titles, many with multiple volumes.

Project SEED is a nonprofit organization that works in partnership with school districts, universities, foundations, and corporations to teach advanced math to elementary and middle school students as a supplement to their regular math instruction. Project SEED also provides professional development for classroom teachers. Founded in 1963 by William F. Johntz, its primary goal is to use mathematics to increase the educational options of low-achieving, at-risk students.  About  Project SEED is primarily a mathematics instruction program delivered to intact classes of elementary and middle school students, many from low-income backgrounds, to better prepare them for high school and college math. SEED Instruction utilizes the Socratic method, in which instructors use a question- and-answer approach to guide students to the discovery of mathematical principles. The SEED instructors are math subject specialists, with degrees in mathematics or math-based sciences, who use a variety of techniques including hand and arm signals to encourage high levels of involvement, focus and feedback from students of all achievement levels. The approach is intended to encourage active student learning, develop critical thinking, and strengthen articulation skills. The program also emphasizes assessment of student learning and adaptation of instruction to accommodate different math ability levels.Phillips, S. & Ebrahimi, H. (1993). Equation for success: Project SEED. In G. Cuevas & M. Driscoll (Eds.), Reaching All Students with Mathematics (pp. 59‚Äì74). Reston, Virginia: National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. Project SEED curriculum includes topics from advanced mathematics, such as advanced algebra, pre-calculus, group theory, number theory, calculus, and geometry. SEED instruction is supplemental to the regular math program. While teaching students, Project SEED Mathematics Specialists simultaneously provide professional development training for classroom teachers, through modeling and coaching in its instructional strategies.  History  Founded by math teacher and psychologist William Johntz in 1963 to improve the educational outcomes of low-income and minority students, Project SEED is currently run by CEO and National Director Hamid Ebrahimi, and continues to provide direct instruction and professional development for students and teachers across the U.S. Project SEED started as a result of Johntz teaching a remedial math class at Berkeley High School (Berkeley, California) in 1963. Frustrated by the failure of standard remediation to improve the basic math skills of his students, he began teaching them algebra using a Socratic, question-and-answer technique. They responded well to this new material that allowed them to think conceptually about mathematics, but since they were already in high school, there was little time left for them to turn around their academic careers. Johntz began using his free periods to try the same strategies to teach Algebra in a nearby elementary school. These fifth and sixth graders responded with enthusiasm to succeeding in the study of a high school subject. Also, this exploration of advanced concepts gave Johntz a chance to revisit and reinforce the grade-level curriculum.Hollins, E., Smiler, H., & Spencer, K. (1994). Benchmarks in meeting the challenges of effective schooling for African American youngsters. In E. Hollins, J. King, & Hayman, W. (Eds.), Teaching diverse populations: Formulating a knowledge base (pp. 166‚Äì174). Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 1994. Graduate students and faculty from U.C. Berkeley soon joined Johntz in other Berkeley schools. The program spread through presentations for school districts, corporations and conferences, and became a component of the Miller Mathematics Improvement Program, a program funded statewide in California from 1968 to 1970.Wilson, S. M. (2003). California dreaming: Reforming mathematics education. New Haven: Yale University Press. Many of the early instructors were university faculty, graduate students, and corporate volunteers. Project SEED became a non-profit, tax-exempt corporation in Michigan in 1970 where state funding brought the program to ten different cities between 1970 and 1975. When it was founded in 1963, the name Project S.E.E.D. was an acronym for ‚ÄúSpecial Elementary Education for the Disadvantaged.‚Äù The program was reincorporated in California in 1987 as Project SEED, Inc. dropping the acronym. This was done primarily to avoid confusion with ‚ÄúSpecial Education‚Äù which had taken on a specific meaning. Over the years Project SEED has operated in a number of cities and states with funding from state governments, federal grants, school districts, and foundations and corporations. From 1982 through 2002, a district funded program in Dallas, Texas reached tens of thousands of students and hundreds of teachers in dozens of schools. The series of longitudinal studies done by the district evaluation department during that time constitutes the most thorough examination of the effectiveness of Project SEED. Students in identified schools received a semester of Project SEED instruction for three consecutive years beginning in the fourth grade, a program design that is now regarded as the preferred model. District teachers working in kindergarten through twelfth grade classrooms received workshops, in-class modeling, and coaching from SEED staff as a part of the Urban Systemic Initiative that was implemented in the Dallas & Detroit school districts in the mid 1990s. The current Project SEED professional development program is based on this model. The Dallas & Detroit experiences continue to inform much of what Project SEED is today. Hundreds of articles about Project SEED have appeared in newspapers and magazines as well as a number of academic books about successful intervention programs. Many former SEED instructors have gone on to make further important contributions to the field of mathematics education.Warfield, V. M. (n.d.). The impact of a SEED project.

The LSU transit system is operated by First Transit, under contract with LSU's Office of Parking & Transportation Services, formerly known as the Office of Parking, Traffic & Transportation. There are a total of 31 buses in the Tiger Trails fleet. During daytime operating hours, the transit system is capable of operating up to 21 buses during peak hours with three back-up, and six small buses for on demand service. History From 1974 to 2009, Louisiana State University used Baton Rouge's Capital Area Transit System to transport its students, faculty and visitors on and off campus. The motion to create LSU Tiger Trails arose in 2008 due to poor bus service and unfulfilled requirements offered by Baton Rouge's Capital Area Transit System (CATS). The Student Government of LSU, along with the Office of Parking & Transportation Services, received complaints filed against both the service and drivers of CATS. The LSU Student government requested that the university ask CATS to improve their service. After several requests by LSU asking for CATS to improve on their shortcomings, followed by no actions taken by CATS; the university began taking the initial steps of breaking away from the CATS contract and starting their own transit system. Beginnings In September 2008, the president and senior consultant of Solstice Transportation Consulting, Mitch Skyer came to meet with \\"Gary Graham, director of the Office of Parking, Traffic & Transportation [sic],\\" along \\"with administration, Student Government, transportation officials and passenger representatives\\" to initiate contact and being to evaluate the transit system. The Solstice Transportation Group held public forums, generated questionnaires, and researched the surrounding area of LSU for population of the LSU community. With the findings of the Solstice Transportation Group, they then mapped projections of routes which the buses should take to maximize usage and reduce route completion time. Solstice Transportation Group presented their projections to the committee in charge of deciding the matter, and the committee was in favor of the outcome of Solstice's projections. LSU put the projections of their new system up for bid to multiple transportation companies. Out of the several companies who submitted their own proposals, First Transit won the bid because they were well priced and responsible. Before Tiger Trails became 'Tiger Trails,' the LSU student body, facility and staff voted on an appropriate name. The top three most popular names were Tiger Trails, Easy Tiger, and Geaux Tiger, respectively. Tiger Trails took the majority of the vote with 47.3 percent, followed by Easy Tiger commanding 33.4 percent and Geaux Tiger with 19.3 percent. Current fleet There are two types of buses in the fleet. The majority of the fleet consists of the 'Eldorado' buses costing around $300,000. There are ten 30 ft and fifteen 40 ft Eldorados. These are the bigger of the two with flat fronts, and are used for the fixed routes. The other type is the 'Glavel' buses which is built on a Ford truck or van chassis with a passenger cab, and cost around $150,000. There are two E550 vans and four F550 buses. These are used for on demand services running from 5:30pm- midnight 7 days a week.

Flandria Illustrata is a historiographical and cartographic work from 1641 by the Flemish canon Antonius Sanderus. It contains descriptions of the main towns and villages of the former county of Flanders, in addition to a description of its counts and bishops. Often a map or drawing of a city or village is added. The work had several editions in 1735 and was also published in Dutch under the title Verheerlykt Vlaandre.  Sanderus' predecessors  Sanderus tells us in his Sanderus Apologidion that the biggest inspiration for his Flandria Illustrata was the Theatrum sive Hollandiae Comitatus et urbium nova descriptio Marcus Zuerius Boxhornius (Boxhorn Nl), which in 1632 was published by the Amsterdam publisher and engraver Henricus Hondius. This led Sanderus to join the revival of history and cartography that was going on since the 16th century. It was Sanderus' goal to surpass his predecessors, both in terms of completeness and quality.  Publication  The writing and publishing of Flandria Illustrata did not run without a hitch. After the plan was conceived, Sanderus contacted the North Dutch publisher Henricus Hondius, who also published the work of Boxhorn. All this ran through his contacts with a middleman, Johannes D'Hondt, a nephew of Henry and a knowledge also of the family Sanderus. There was one major problem: Henricus Hondius, as a North Dutchman, was a Protestant. The Catholic Church had a habit of publishing books in Protestant countries without the index to places. This would mean not only that the book would be almost unobtainable in Flanders, but that it would portray Sanderus, a canon, in a bad light. The Dutch publishers had already found solution to this problem: the book was printed by a Dutch printing company, but under the name of a Catholic publisher from Cologne. From 1632 Sanderus began with the first studies for his work. In 1634 he signed a contract with Hondius. After some time came, however, tensions arose: Hondius had begun his work with the material he already received, but had to constantly stop because a number of articles and drawings were always omitted. Hondius himself remained not free from blame: he sent back several drawings and cards for unnecessary corrections while failing to implement the corrections that Sanderus suggested. Hondius was so thoroughly tired of the situation in 1641 that he published Flandria Illustrata without notifying Sanderus that his nephew Johannes had sold to its competitor, the brothers Blaeu. Meanwhile the publication already advanced fairly well. Although the original proposed date was Easter 1637, the publication was completed on 1 April 1641.

History The typeface grew out of Excoffon's repeated and ultimately abandoned efforts to make a bold of his typeface Mistral.

In the 1990s, Choc was distributed digitally with the graphics software CorelDraw under the name Staccato 555.

It is India's third- most populous state and third-largest state by area, and includes the major cities of Mumbai, Pune, Nashik and Nagpur. The region that comprises the state has a long history dating back to the 4th century BCE, although the present- day state was not established until 1960 CE. From the 4th century BCE until 875, Maharashtri Prakrit and its Apabhra·πÉ≈õas (dialects) were the dominant languages of the region. The Marathi language, which evolved from Maharashtri Prakrit, has been the common language from the 9th century. The oldest stone inscriptions in the Marathi language date to around 975 AD, and can be seen at Shravanabelgola in modern-day Karnataka at the foot of the Bahubali Statue. Maharashtra was historically the name of a region which consisted of Aparanta, Vidarbha, Mulak, Assaka (Ashmaka) and Kuntala. Tribal communities of Bhil people inhabited this area, also known as Dandakaranya, in ancient times. There was also an ancient race called \\"Rattha\\" (‡§∞‡§†‡•ç‡§† in Marathi), who referred to themselves as \\"Maharattha\\" (Maha is Great). The name Maharashtra first appeared in the 7th century in the account of a contemporary Chinese traveler, Huan Tsang. In the early modern period, the region of Maharashtra came under the rule of several Islamic dynasties, including the Deccan Sultanates and Mughal Empire. For part of 17th century and most of 18th century, the region became a base for the Maratha Empire, which conquered large parts of India before being defeated by the British. The British ruled parts of Maharashtra for more than a century until 1947. After independence from the British, the state of Maharashtra was formed in 1960 after a prolonged campaign to create a Marathi speaking state in the 1950s. Early history Daimabad hoard, Indus Valley Civilization Chalcolithic sites belonging to the Jorwe culture (ca. 1300‚Äì700 BCE) have been discovered throughout the state.Upinder Singh (2008), A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century, p.232P. K. Basant (2012), The City and the Country in Early India: A Study of Malwa, pp. 92‚Äì96 The largest settlement discovered of the culture is at Daimabad, which had a mud fortification during this period, as well as an elliptical temple with fire pits. Some settlements show evidence of planning in the layout of rectangular houses and streets or lanes. Maharashtra region later became part of the Maurya Empire with edicts of emperor Ashoka found in the region. Buddhism flourished during this period in the region.trade including international trade with Greeks and later with the Roman empire also flourished with Traders being the main patrons of Buddhist monasteries.Margabandhu, C. \\"Trade Contacts between Western India and the Graeco-Roman World in the early centuries of the Christian era.\\" Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient/Journal de l'histoire economique et sociale de l'Orient (1965): 316-322.Rath, Jayanti. \\"QUEENS AND COINS OF INDIA.\\"Deo, S. B. \\"The Genesis of Maharashtra History and Culture.\\" Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute 43 (1984): 17-36. Indo-Scythians Western Satraps ruled part of the region during the early part of the first millennium. Middle Kingdoms (3rd-13th centuries CE) The region that is present-day Maharashtra has formed part of a number of states, including the Maurya empire, Satavahana dynasty, the Kadamba dynasty, the Vakataka dynasty, the Chalukya dynasty and the Rashtrakuta dynasty. Most of these empires extended over large swathes of Indian territory. Some of the greatest monuments in Maharashtra, such as the Ajantha and Ellora caves, were built during the time of these empires. Maharashtra was ruled by the Maurya Empire in the 4th and 3rd century BCE. Around 230 BCE it was taken over by the Satavahana dynasty which ruled the region for 400 years.India Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Republic: p.440 A notable ruler of the Satavahana Dynasty was Gautamiputra Satakarni, who defeated Scythian invaders. The Vakataka dynasty ruled from approximately 250 to 470 CE. The Satavahana dynasty mainly used the Prakrit language, while the Vakataka dynasty used both Prakrit and Sanskrit.. =The Chalukya and Rashtrakuta= Kailashanatha Temple, one of the 34 cave temples and monasteries known collectively as the Ellora Caves, was built during the 8th century CE by the Rashtrakuta king Krishna I. From the 6th century CE to the 8th century, the Chalukya dynasty ruled Maharashtra. Two prominent rulers were Pulakeshin II, who defeated the north Indian Emperor Harsha, and Vikramaditya II, who defeated Arab invaders in the 8th century. The Rashtrakuta Dynasty ruled Maharashtra from the 8th to the 10th century.Indian History - page B-57 The Arab traveler Sulaiman called the ruler of the Rashtrakuta Dynasty (Amoghavarsha) \\"one of the 4 great kings of the world\\".A Comprehensive History of Ancient India (3 Vol. Set): p.203 The Chalukya dynasty and Rashtrakuta Dynasty had their capitals in modern-day Karnataka and used Kannada and Sanskrit as court languages. From the early 11th century to the 12th century the Deccan Plateau, including a large part of Maharashtra, was dominated by the Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola dynasty.The Penguin History of Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300 by Romila Thapar: p.365-366 Several battles over the Deccan Plateau were fought between these empires during the reigns of Raja Raja Chola I, Rajendra Chola I, Jayasimha II, Someshvara I and Vikramaditya VI.Ancient Indian History and Civilization by Sailendra Nath Sen: p.383-384 Between 800 and 1200 CE, parts of Western Maharashtra including the Konkan region of Maharashtra were ruled by different Shilahara houses based in North Konkan South Konkan and Kolhapur respectively.Sovani, N.V., 1951. Social Survey of Kolhapur City Vol. Ii- Industry, Trade And Labour,pp=2-4 At different periods in their history, the Shilaharas served as the vassals of either the Rashtrakutas or the Chalukyas. =Yadav dynasty 12th-14th century= The Yadavas of Devagiri dynasty at its peak ruled a kingdom stretching from the Tungabhadra to the Narmada rivers, including present-day Maharashtra, north Karnataka and parts of Madhya Pradesh. Its capital was at Devagiri (present-day Daulatabad in modern Maharashtra). The Yadavas initially ruled as feudatories of the Western Chalukyas. The quoted pages can be read at Google Book Search. The founder of the Suena dynasty was Dridhaprahara, the son of Subahu. It is unclear where his capital was located; some argue that his capital was Shrinagara, while an early inscription suggests that Chandradityapura (modern Chandwad in the Nasik district) was the capital. The name Seuna comes from Dridhaprahara's son, Seunachandra, who originally ruled a region called Seunadesha (present-day Khandesh). Bhillama II, a later ruler in the dynasty, assisted Tailapa II in his war with the Paramara king Munja. Seunachandra II helped Vikramaditya VI in gaining his throne. Around the middle of the 12th century, as Chalukya power waned, the Yadavas declared independence. Their rule reached its peak under Singhana II. The Yadavas of Devagiri used Marathi as their court language.\\"Yadav ‚Äì Pahila Marathi Bana\\" S.P. Dixit (1962) Kannada may also have been a court language during Seunachandra's rule. The Yadava capital Devagiri became a magnet for learned scholars in Marathi to showcase and find patronage for their skills. The origin and growth of Marathi literature is directly linked with the rise of the Yadava dynasty. According to scholars such as George Moraes, V. K. Rajwade, C. V. Vaidya, A.S. Altekar, D. R. Bhandarkar, and J. Duncan M. Derrett, the Seuna rulers were of Maratha descent. Digambar Balkrishna Mokashi noted that the Yadava dynasty \\"seems to be the first true Maratha empire\\". Medieval and Early modern period (1206-1858 CE) Tomb of Salabat Khan II, an example of architecture of Ahmadnagar Sultanate In the early 14th century, the Yadava dynasty, which ruled most of present-day Maharashtra, was overthrown by the Delhi Sultanate ruler Ala-ud-din Khalji. Later, Muhammad bin Tughluq conquered parts of the Deccan, and temporarily shifted his capital from Delhi to Daulatabad in Maharashtra. = Bahmani and Deccan Sultanates = After the collapse of the Tughluqs in 1347, the breakaway Bahmani Sultanate governed the region as well as the wider Deccan region for the next 150 years from Gulbarga and later from Bidar . The early period of Islamic rule saw atrocities such as imposition of Jiziya tax on non- Muslims, temple destruction and forcible conversions. Eventually these incidents largely ceased. For most of this period Brahmins were in charge of accounts, whereas revenue collection was in the hands of Marathas who had watans (hereditary rights) of patilki (revenue collection at village level) and deshmukhi ( revenue collection over a larger area). A number of families such as Bhosale, Shirke, Ghorpade, Jadhav, More, Mahadik, Ghatge and Nimbalkar loyally served different sultans at different periods in time. Since most of the population was Hindu and spoke Marathi, even sultans such as Ibrahim Adil Shah I adopted Marathi as the court language, for administration and record keeping. After the break-up of the Bahamani sultanate in 1518, the Maharashtra region was split between five Deccan Sultanates: Nizamshah of Ahmednagar, Adilshah of Bijapur, Qutubshah of Golkonda, Bidarshah of Bidar and Imadshah of Elichpur. These kingdoms often fought with each other. United, they decisively defeated the Vijayanagara Empire of the south in 1565. The present area of Mumbai was ruled by the Sultanate of Gujarat before its capture by Portugal in 1535. The Faruqi dynasty ruled the Khandesh region between 1382 and 1601 before finally being annexed by the Mughal Empire. The Mughals under Akbar started capturing territories held by the Deccan sultanates towards the end of 16th century.This policy continued under his successors for almost a century when most of the present day area of Maharashtra came under Mughal control. However, the Mughal control was challenged multiple times during this period.Early in the century the resistance was led by Malik Ambar, the regent of the Nizamshahi dynasty of Ahmednagar from 1607 to 1626. He increased the strength and power of Murtaza Nizam Shah II and raised a large army. Malik Ambar was a proponent of guerilla warfare in the Deccan region, and was considered a great foe by Mughal emperor Jehangir. He assisted Mughal prince Khurram (later emperor Shah Jahan) in his struggle against his stepmother, Nur Jahan, who had ambitions to secure the Delhi throne for her son-in-law. In the second half of the 17th century, the Mughals were constantly challenged by the Marathas under Shivaji, and later his successors. Bibi ka Maqbara, a replica of the Taj Mahal, was built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. In fact, the decline of Islamic rule in Deccan started when Shivaji annexed a portion of the Bijapur Sultanate in the second half of the 17th century.In the process he became a symbol of Hindu resistance and self-rule.  Maratha Empire (1674‚Äì1818 CE)  The Maratha Empire (1795 map) was the paramount power in the Indian subcontinent in the 18th and early 19th century until it was usurped by the East India Company. The Maratha Empire dominated the political scene in India from the middle of the 17th century to the early 19th century. = Chhatrapati Shivaji= Shivaji, the founder of Maratha empire Chhatrapati Shivaji was the founder of the modern Maratha empire; his policies were instrumental in forging a distinct identity for the Marathi-speaking people. He was born Shivaji Bhosale as a member of the Bhonsle clan, sometime in the period 1627 to 1630. Shivaji first carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned as the Chhatrapati (Monarch) of his realm at Raigad. However, to achieve this he not only had to fight the Mughals and the Adilshahi but also many Maratha Watandars.These Watandars considered their watan a source of economic power and pride and were reluctant to part with it. The Watandars even initially opposed the emergence of Shivaji, because their economic interests were affected. Shivaji was an able administrator and established a government that included such modern concepts as a cabinet (ashtapradhana mandala), foreign affairs (dabir) and internal intelligence. He established an effective civil and military administration, built a powerful navy and erected new forts (e.g. Sindhudurg) and strengthened old ones (e.g. Vijayadurg) on the west coast of Maharashtra. He died around 3 April 1680, of dysentery. After Shivaji died, Mughal emperor Aurangzeb launched an attack on the Marathas that led to a war lasting 27 years. The death of Aurangzeb in 1707 ended the war and initiated the decline of the Mughal Empire. = Expansion of Maratha Influence in 18th Century under Shahu I and Peshwa rule = Shaniwar Wada, the palace and administrative headquarters in Pune built by Baji Rao I in 1730 During much of the 18th century, the Peshwas, belonging to the (Bhat) Deshmukh Marathi Chitpavan Brahmin family, controlled the Maratha army and later became the hereditary heads of the Maratha Empire from 1749 to 1818.Shirgaonkar, Varsha S. \\"Eighteenth Century Deccan: Cultural History of the Peshwas.\\" Aryan Books International, New Delhi (2010). During their reign, the Maratha empire reached its zenith in 1760, dominating most of the Indian subcontinent.Shirgaonkar, Varsha S. \\"Peshwyanche Vilasi Jeevan.\\" (Luxurious Life of Peshwas) Continental Prakashan, Pune (2012). Bajirao I, a prominent Peshwa (general), was only 20 when appointed Peshwa. For his campaigns in North India, he actively promoted young leaders of his own age such as Ranoji Shinde, Malharrao Holkar, the Puar brothers and Pilaji Gaekwad. These leaders also did not come from the traditional aristocratic families of Maharashtra. All the young leaders chosen by Bajirao I or their descendants later became rulers in their own right during the Maratha Confederacy era. Historian K.K. Datta argues that Bajirao I \\"may very well be regarded as the second founder of the Maratha Empire\\".An Advanced History of India, Dr. K.K. Datta, p. 546 Another general, Raghoji Bhonsle, also expanded the Maratha rule in central and East India and took control of the Nagpur Kingdom. In 1737, the Marathas defeated a Mughal army in their capital, in the Battle of Delhi. The Marathas continued their military campaigns against the Mughals, Nizam, Nawab of Bengal and the Durrani Empire to further extend their boundaries. By 1760, the domain of the Marathas stretched across most of the Indian subcontinent.The Rediscovery of India: A New Subcontinent Cite: \\"Swarming up from the Himalayas, the Marathas now ruled from the Indus and Himalayas in the north to the south tip of the peninsula. They were either masters directly or they took tribute.\\" The Marathas even discussed abolishing the Mughal throne and placing Vishwasrao Peshwa on the Mughal imperial throne in Delhi. At its peak, the empire stretched from Tamil Nadu in the south, to Peshawar (modern- day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan ) in the north, and Bengal in the east. The Northwestern expansion of the Marathas was stopped after the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). However, the Maratha authority in the north was re-established within a decade under Peshwa Madhavrao I. Under Madhavrao I, the strongest knights were granted semi-autonomy, creating a confederacy of Maratha states led by the Gaekwads of Baroda, the Holkars of Indore and Malwa, the Scindias of Gwalior and Ujjain, the Bhonsales of Nagpur and the Puars of Dhar and Dewas. In 1775, the East India Company intervened in a Peshwa family succession struggle in Pune, leading to the First Anglo-Maratha War, which resulted in a Maratha victory. Maratha Navy Shivaji developed a potent Naval force during his rule. In the early part of the 1700s, under the leadership of Kanhoji Angre, this navy dominated the territorial waters of the western coast of India from Bilimora, Gujarat to Savantwadi. It attacked British, Portuguese, Dutch, and Siddi Naval ships and kept a check on their naval ambitions. The Maratha Navy was dominant in the area until around the 1730s, was in a state of decline by the 1770s, and ceased to exist by 1818. Revenue system and Chauth One of the tools of the empire was collection of Chauth or 25% of the revenue from states that submitted to Maratha power. The Marathas also had an elaborate land revenue system which was retained by the British East India Company when they gained control of Maratha territory.Wink, A., 1983. Maratha revenue farming. Modern Asian Studies, 17(04), pp.591-628.  British Colonial period (1818‚Äì1947 CE)  The Aga Khan Palace in Pune, where Mahatma Gandhi and his associates were interned during the Indian independence movement. = Company Rule = The East India Company controlled Mumbai beginning in the 17th century, and used it as one of their main trading posts. The Company slowly expanded areas under its rule during the 18th century. Their conquest of Maharashtra was completed in 1818 with the defeat of Peshwa Bajirao II in the Third Anglo-Maratha War.Omvedt, G.in 1973. Development of the Maharashtrian Class Structure, 1818 to 1931. Economic and Political Weekly, pp.1417-1432.. = British Raj = The British ruled for more than a century and brought huge changes in every aspect of life for the people of the Maharashtra region. Areas that correspond to present day Maharashtra were under direct or indirect British rule, first under the East India Company and then, from 1858, under the British crown. During this era the Maharashtra region era was divided into the Bombay presidency, Berar, Central provinces, Hyderabad state and various Princely states such as Kolhapur and Miraj. The British colonial period saw standardization of Marathi grammar through the efforts of the Christian missionary William Carey. Carey also published the first dictionary of Marathi in devanagari script. The most comprehensive Marathi-English dictionary was compiled by Captain James Thomas Molesworth and Major Thomas Candy in 1831. The book is still in print nearly two centuries after its publication. Molesworth also worked on standardizing Marathi. He used Brahmins of Pune for this task and adopted the Sanskrit- dominated dialect spoken by this caste in the city as the standard dialect for Marathi., Gateway of India, built in the early 20th century in the Indo- Saracenic style of architecture, which combines British, Indo-Islamic and Hindu temple architectural styles. People from Maharashtra played an important part in the social and religious reform movements as well as the nationalist movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Notable Civil society bodies founded by Marathi leaders during 19th century include the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, the Prarthana Samaj, the Arya Mahila Samaj and the Satya Shodhak Samaj. The Sarvajanik Sabha took an active part in relief efforts during the famine of 1875‚Äì76, and is considered the forerunner of the Indian National Congress established in 1885. The most prominent personalities of Indian Nationalism in the late 19th and early 20th century, Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who were on opposite sides of the political spectrum, were both from Pune. Tilak was instrumental in using Shivaji and Ganesh worship to forge a collective Maharashtrian identity for Marathi people. The Marathi social reformers of the colonial era include Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, and his wife Savitribai Phule, Justice Ranade, feminist Tarabai Shinde, Dhondo Keshav Karve, Vitthal Ramji Shinde, and Pandita Ramabai.Ramachandra Guha, \\"The Other Liberal Light,\\" New Republic 22 June 2012 Jyotirao Phule was a pioneer in opening schools for girls and Marathi dalits castes. The non-Brahmin Hindu castes of Maharashtra started organizing at the beginning of the 20th century with the blessing of Chhatrapati Shahu of Kolhapur. The campaign took off in the early 1920s under the leadership of Keshavrao Jedhe and Baburao Javalkar. Both belonged to the Non-Brahmin party. Their early goals included capturing the Ganpati and Shivaji festivals from Brahmin domination. They combined nationalism with anti-casteism as the party's aims.Omvedt, G., 1973. Non-Brahmans and Communists in Bombay. Economic and Political Weekly, pp.749-759. New Palace, Kolhapur In the 1930s, Jedhe merged the non-Brahmin party with the Congress party, changing it from an upper-caste dominated body to a more broadly based but also Maratha-dominated party. Another notable Marathi figure of the time was Dr Ambedkar, who led the campaign for the rights of Dalits, a caste that included his own Mahar caste. Ambedkar disagreed with mainstream leaders like Gandhi on issues including untouchability, the government system and the partition of India. He initiated the Dalit Buddhist movement, creating a new school of Buddhism called Navayana, and leading to the Dalit movement that still endures. As the nation's first Law and Justice Minister, Ambedkar played a pivotal role in writing the constitution of India and is considered the \\"Father of the Indian Constitution\\". The ultimatum in 1942 to the British to \\"Quit India\\" was given in Mumbai, and culminated in the transfer of power and the independence of India in 1947. Raosaheb and Achutrao Patwardhan, Nanasaheb Gore, Shreedhar Mahadev Joshi, Yeshwantrao Chavan, Swami Ramanand Bharti, Nana Patil, Dhulappa Navale, V.S. Page, Vasant Patil, Dhondiram Mali, Aruna Asif Ali, Ashfaqulla Khan and several other leaders from Maharashtra played a prominent role in this struggle. B.G. Kher was the first Chief Minister of the tri-lingual Bombay Presidency in 1937. Although the British originally used India simply as a source of raw materials for the factories of England, by the end of the 19th century a modern manufacturing industry was developing in the city of Mumbai.Majumdar, Sumit K. (2012), India's Late, Late Industrial Revolution: Democratizing Entrepreneurship, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, , retrieved 2013-12-07 The main product was cotton and the bulk of work force in these mills was from Western Maharashtra, specifically from the coastal Konkan region. The census recorded for the city in the first half of the 20th century showed that nearly half the population of the city listed Marathi as their mother tongue.  Post-Independence  thumbrightHyderabad state in 1956 (in yellowish green). After reorganization in 1956, Regions of the state west of Red and Blue lines merged with Bombay and Mysore states respectively and rest of the state (Telangana) was merged with Andhra State to form the state of Andhra Pradesh. = Bombay State = After India's independence, the Deccan States, including Kolhapur, were integrated into Bombay State, which was created from the former Bombay Presidency in 1950. In 1956, the States Reorganisation Act reorganized the Indian states along linguistic lines, and Bombay State was enlarged by the addition of the predominantly Marathi- speaking regions of Marathwada (Aurangabad Division) from erstwhile Hyderabad state and Vidarbha region from the Central Provinces and Berar. The southernmost part of Bombay State was ceded to Mysore. The enlarged bilingual leftFrom 1954 to 1955, the people of Marathi speaking areas strongly protested against being included in the bilingual Bombay state. In response, the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement was formed to fight for a united Maharashtra for the Marathi people. The Mahagujarat Movement also advocated for a separate Gujarat state. Keshavrao Jedhe, S.M. Joshi, Shripad Amrit Dange, Pralhad Keshav Atre and Gopalrao Khedkar were prominent activists in the campaign to create a separate state of Maharashtra with Mumbai as its capital. On 1 May 1960, following mass protests and 105 deaths, Bombay State was divided into the new states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. The state continues to have a dispute with Karnataka, to the south, over the regions of Belgaum and Karwar. Some Marathi-majority talukas were also transferred to the Adilabad, Medak, Nizamabad and Mahaboobnagar districts of new Telugu State (now Telangana), to the east of Maharashtra, in 1956.  Maharashtra since 1960  The present state of Maharashtra came into being on 1 May 1960 with Congress party's Yashwantrao Chavan being the first chief minister of the state. The state since its inception has seen huge growth in Industry in a number of areas of the state, increased urbanization, and migration of people from other states India. =Politics= Present day State of Maharashtra The Congress party and its allies have ruled the state for the major part during the state's existence. After brief reigns by Yashwantrao Chavan, who was inducted as defence minister by Prime minister Nehru, and Marotrao Kannamwar, who died after one year in office, Vasantrao Naik ruled the state as Chief minister from 1963 to 1975. The politics of the state in this period was also dominated leaders such as Yashwantrao Chavan, Vasantdada Patil, Vasantrao Naik, and Shankarrao Chavan. Sharad Pawar became a significant personality in state in 1978 when he broke away from the Congress party to form an alliance government with the Janata party. During his career, Pawar split Congress twice, with significant consequences for state politics. In 1999, after his dispute with the party president Sonia Gandhi over her foreign origins, in 1999, Pawar left the party and formed the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). The party, however, joined a Congress-led coalition to form the state government after the 1999 Assembly elections. The Congress party enjoyed a nearly unchallenged dominance of the state political landscape, until 1995 when the coalition of Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured an overwhelming majority in the state, beginning a period of coalition governments. Shiv Sena was the larger party in the coalition. From 1999 until 2014, the NCP and INC formed one coalition while Shiv Sena and the BJP formed another for three successive elections, which the INC-NCP alliance won. Prithviraj Chavan of the Congress party was the last Chief Minister of Maharashtra under the Congress-NCP alliance that ruled until 2014. The INC during its rule enjoyed overwhelming support from the state's influential sugar co-operatives, as well as thousands of other cooperatives, such as rural agricultural cooperatives involved in the marketing of dairy and vegetable produce, credit unions, etc. For the better part of its existence, politics of the state was also dominated by the mainly rural Maratha‚ÄìKunbi caste, which accounts for 31% of the population of Maharashtra. They dominated the cooperative institutions; and with the resultant economic power, and controlled politics from the village level up to the Assembly and Lok Sabha. Major past political figures of the Congress party from Maharashtra‚Äîsuch as Keshavrao Jedhe, Yashwantrao Chavan, Shankarrao Chavan, Vilasrao Deshmukh, and Sharad Pawar‚Äîhave been from this group. Of the 18 Chief Ministers so far, as many as 10 (55%) have been Maratha. Since the 1980s, this group has also been active in setting up private educational institutions. In the 1980s, Shiv Sena and the BJP parties began gaining a foothold in the state especially in the urban areas such as Mumbai. The Shiv Sena was formed in the 1960s by Balashaheb Thackerey, a cartoonist and journalist, to advocate and agitate for the interests of Marathi people in Mumbai. In its early years in the late 1960s, the party specifically targeted immigrants to Mumbai from South India.Subramanian, R.R., A Tale of Two Cities: Reconstructing the 'Bajao Pungi, Hatao Lungi‚Äôcampaign in Bombay, and the Birth of the 'Other'. Editorial Note, p.37. Over the following decades, the party slowly expanded its base, and took over the then Bombay corporation in the 1980s. The original base of the party was lower middle and working class Marathi people in Mumbai and surrounding urban areas. The leadership of the party came from educated upper caste Maharashtrians. However, since 1990s, strong men have emerged who control their local areas through intimidation and extortion. This has phenomenon has been named \\"dada-ization\\" of the party. In the early 1990s, some of the party leaders incited violence against Muslims which resulted in riots between Hindus and Muslims. The Shiv Sena and the BJP came into the power at the state level in 1995, which was a big blow to the INC. A split emerged within Shiv Sena when Bal Thackeray anointed his son Uddhav Thackeray as his successor over his nephew Raj Thackeray in 2006. Raj Thackeray then left the party and formed a new party called Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). Raj Thackeray, like his uncle, also tried to win support from the Marathi community by whipping up anti-immigrant sentiment in Maharashtra, for instance against Biharis and other north Indians. The BJP is closely related to the RSS and is part of the Sangh Parivar. In early years, the party originally derived its support from the urban upper castes such as Brahmins and non-Maharashtrians. However, in the 21st century, the party was able to penetrate the Maratha group by fielding Maratha candidates in elections. =Economy= Prior to Indian independence, manufacturing industry in what became Maharashtra was based mainly in the city of Mumbai. After the formation of Maharashtra, the state government established the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) in 1962 to spur growth in other areas of the state.MIDC in the decades since its formation has acted as the primary industrial infrastructure development agency of the government of Maharashtra. Since its inception, MIDC has established at least one industrial area in every district of the state.Anand, V., 2004. Multi-party accountability for environmentally sustainable industrial development: the challenge of active citizenship. PRIA Study Report, No. 4, March, 04. The areas with biggest industrial growth were the Pune metropolitan region and areas close to Mumbai such as Thane district and Raigad district. After the 1991 economic liberalization, Maharashtra began to attract foreign capital, particularly in the information technology and engineering industries. The late 1990s and first decade of the 21st century saw huge development in the Information Technology sector, and IT Parks were set up in Aundh, and Hinjewadi areas of Pune. Maharashtra has hundreds of private colleges and universities, including many religious and special-purpose institutions. Most of the private colleges were set up after the State Government of Vasantdada Patil liberalised the Education Sector in 1982. Politicians and leaders involved in the huge cooperative movement in Maharashtra were instrumental in setting up the private institutes Maharashtra was a pioneer in the development of Agricultural Cooperative Societies after independence. In fact, it was an integral part of the then Governing Congress party's vision of 'rural development with local initiative'. A 'special' status was accorded to the sugar cooperatives and the government assumed the role of a mentor by acting as a stakeholder, guarantor and regulator, Apart from sugar, Cooperatives played a crucial role in dairy, cotton, and fertiliser industries. Support by the state government led to more than 25,000 cooperatives being set up by 1990s in Maharashtra. Drought of 1972-73 In 1963, the government of Maharashtra asserted that the agricultural situation in the state was constantly being watched and relief measures were taken as soon as any scarcity was detected. On the basis of this, and asserting that the word famine had now become obsolete in this context, the government passed \\"The Maharashtra Deletion of the Term 'Famine' Act, 1963\\". They were unable to foresee the drought in 1972 when 25 million people needed help. The relief measures undertaken by the Government of Maharashtra included employment, programmes aimed at creating productive assets such as tree plantation, conservation of soil, excavation of canals, and building artificial lentic water bodies. The public distribution system distributed food through fair- price shops. No deaths from starvation were reported. Large scale employment to the deprived sections of Maharashtrian society which attracted considerable amounts of food to Maharashtra. The implementation of the Scarcity Manuals in the state prevented the mortality arising from severe food shortages. The relief works initiated by the government helped employ over 5 million people at the height of the drought in Maharashtra leading to effective famine prevention. The effectiveness of the Maharashtra was also attributable to the direct pressure on the government of Maharashtra by the public who perceived that employment via the relief works programme was their right. The public protested by marching, picketing, and even rioting.Nevertheless, the measures taken by the government were praised for being a model program for famine relief.  Farmers' suicides  Since 1990s, there has been a huge increase in number of suicides committed by Farmers in India with Maharashtra accounting for the largest percentage of cases. The main reason cited was their inability to repay loans mostly taken from banks and NBFCs. Other reasons included the difficulty of farming semi-arid regions, poor agricultural income, absence of alternative income opportunities, and the absence of suitable counselling services.Gru√®re, G. & Sengupta, D.

Groeningemuseum, Bruges, 1439 Portrait of Margaret van Eyck (or Margaret, the Artist's Wife) is a 1439 oil on wood painting by the Early Netherlandish master Jan van Eyck. It is one of the two latestThe other is the Virgin and Child at the Fountain in Antwerp. of his surviving paintings, and one of the earliest European artworks to depict a painter's spouse. Completed when she was around 34, it was hung until the early 18th century in the Bruges chapel of the Guild of painters. The work is thought to be a pendant or diptych panel for either a now lost self-portrait known from records until 1769, or of Jan van Eyck's likely self-portrait now in the National Gallery in London.Borchert, 36 The reason for its inception is unknown; but that it was created for private rather than public viewing can be inferred from the sitter's unidealised representation and her direct but plaintive gaze towards the viewer, which creates an intimate and informal atmosphere. The painting was probably created to mark an occasion; maybe to commemorate the couple's anniversary, or her birthday, or as a gift to her.Borchert, 149 Van Eyck died within two years of this work. He inscribed plates on the top and ends of the frame in Greek lettering with the words, My husband Johannes completed me in the year 1439 on 17 June, at the age of 33. As I can. \\"As I can\\" (ALS ICH KAN) was something of a personal motto and motif for van Eyck, as well as a pun on his surname. It can be found inscribed on several of his religious paintings, though on only two portraits.Chipps Smith, 99 Description Margaret is shown in three-quarter view, that is her body almost directly facing the viewer but not quite. She is set against a flat black and featureless background, wearing an elegant red woolen gown with grey fur lining (in the medieval period fur often represented female sexuality), probably from squirrel,\\"Margaret's red dress\\". National Gallery, London. Retrieved 4 Nov 2011. in the neck and cuffs. Her horned wimple is decorated with fine lace. Her left eye shows evidence of a squint, a feature unusually evident in northern Europeans of the era. The painter has taken a number of liberties with representation to accentuate the features of his wife. Her head is out of proportion to her body, and her forehead unusually and fashionably high, a device which allows the artist to concentrate on the facial features of his wife. In addition, the geometric pattern formed by her head-dress, arms and the V of her neck-line allows her face to dominate the image.Campbell, 32 The couple likely married around 1432‚Äì33, soon after his move to Bruges - she is unmentioned before he relocated while the first of their two children was born in 1434. Very little is known of Margaret, even her maiden name is lost - contemporary records refer to her mainly as Damoiselle Marguierite. She is thought to have been of aristocratic birth, though from the lower nobility, evidenced from her clothes in this portrait which are fashion but not of the sumptuousness worn by the bride in van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait. The fabrics and colours worn by people of the 15th century were informally regulated by their social position; for example black, an expensive dye, could only be worn by the upper reaches of society. As the widow of a renowned painter, Margaret was afforded a modest pension by the city of Bruges after Jan's death. It is recorded that at least some of this income was invested in lottery. Attribution Although the Early Netherlandish painters are highly regarded today, they were almost forgotten by the early 1800s. This work was not rediscovered until the late 18th century when it was found for sale in a Belgian fish market,Van Der Elst, 65 although accounts differ. As with most of the rediscovered works of its era, it underwent a number of attributions before a broad consensus on its origin was formed. The portrait is still in its original frameCampbell, 214 and is in very good condition with the colours and paint well preserved. It was cleaned and restored by the National Gallery, London in 1998. Many early collectors and later art historians speculated that it might have once formed half of a diptych. It was paired as a pendant for a time with a self-portrait by van Eyck when two of his works were acquired by the chapel of the Guild of Saint Luke before 1769. Some critics, when supporting the theory of a diptych, mention a now-lost male portrait known to be similar to his National Gallery, London Portrait of a Man.The National Gallery tentatively titles the male portrait as Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?)Harbison, 208 A third painting is suspected, but not known, to be a portrait of Margaret: the 1436 Lucca Madonna.Harbison, 97 However, art historian Max Friedl√¶nder warned against assumptions based on facial resemblance, believing that artists of the time may have projected the likeness of the women in their lives onto female subjects in their religious work.

It is consensus-based, is run by a steering committee, rather than having an individual as leader, and does not ascribe to an ideology.  History NSV was formed as an advocacy group in 2007, similar to a previous coalition called Neighbour 2 Neighbour. NSV brought together diverse neighbourhoods that span the political spectrum into a network to communicate with each other and to issue joint position statements or advocacy. The first NSV public representative and media contact was Mel Lehan from West Kitsilano. After the fall of 2008, Ned Jacobs of Riley Park/South Cambie (son of urbanist Jane Jacobs) assumed that role. NSV coordinated input from the large network of neighbourhoods that produced common position letters to Council, with some of the early letters having up to 39 versions before finalizing based on consensus. In the November 2008 Vancouver civic election the Non Partisan Association-dominated (NPA) council was defeated. Furor over and opposition to EcoDensity policies contributed to the political demise of NPA Mayor Sam Sullivan and his party. NSV created a candidate survey that lead to the network's endorsement of the Vision/COPE slate. Although Vision Vancouver were elected on a promise to reconsider EcoDensity, the new 2008 Vision Vancouver council continued to implement the NPA policies. Vision Vancouver's Greenest City Action Plan includes many actions proposed under EcoDensity policies. NSV continues to support and inform a network of neighbourhoods. The network helps the public engage City Hall and make informed decisions. NSV's main goals are neighbourhood-based real democracy (reform campaign finance, strengthen neighbourhood representation), sustainability (holistic balance between environmental, social and economic sustainability, plus issues of affordable housing, transportation systems, livability), and Vancouver-based solutions (accommodate growth in ways that suit the uniqueness of the city and the character of the neighbourhoods). 2011 civic election Disappointed with Vision Vancouver and NPA policy directions, and COPE entering into an alliance with Vision that restricted COPE to three council candidates, NSV evolved from an advocacy group to an electoral organization in 2011. The effects of developer contributions to election funding of the two main parties, Vision Vancouver and the NPA, continued to be a concern. NSV ran five candidates in the Vancouver 2011 municipal election and also endorsed six candidates from various parties to complete a slate for Mayor and Council. NSV ran a candidate for mayor (Randy Helten), and four city council candidates (Nicole Benson, Marie Kerchum, Terry Martin, and Elizabeth Murphy). The party also endorsed six additional candidates from outside the party for council: RJ Aquino (COPE), Adriane Carr (Green), Sandy Garossino (independent), Tim Louis (COPE), Bill McCreery (NPA), and Ellen Woodsworth (COPE). In the 2011 election Randy Helten came in third out of twelve candidates for mayor, behind Gregor Robertson (Vision Vancouver) and Suzanne Anton (NPA). The five-week low-budget campaign by the five NSV candidates resulted in 67,271 votes, with Elizabeth Murphy garnering 19,644 votes, compared to the top-ranking council candidate (Vision Vancouver's Raymond Louie, at 63,273 votes). Of the other candidates NSV endorsed, Adriane Carr (Green Party of Vancouver) was elected as councillor. A major issue for NSV during the election was campaign finance reform. NSV emphasized that regulators should never be funded by those they regulate. Thus, since municipal governments are the regulator of land use policy, civic council candidates should not be funded by developers. Yet the development industry is the largest source of funds for both the NPA and Vision Vancouver. According to Campaign Financing Disclosure Statements on the City of Vancouver website, Campaign spending in the 2011 civic election were as follows (total rounded with dollars per vote): * Vision Vancouver $2.237 million ($5.41/vote) * NPA $2.978 million ($7.03/vote) * COPE $361,000 ($2.74/vote) * NSV $40,000 ($0.64/vote) * Green $23,000 ($0.46/vote) See also *Consensus decision-making References Category:2007 establishments in British Columbia Category:Centrist parties in Canada Category:Municipal green political parties in Canada Category:Municipal political parties in Vancouver Category:Political parties established in 2007 ","title":"Neighbourhoods for a Sustainable Vancouver"},{"id":"33640618","text":"Events from the year 1991 in Scotland.

Although Sebastian the Ibis is the official mascot of most University of Miami sports, the Maniac is the only mascot which performs at Hurricane baseball games. Created in 1982 by visionary College Baseball Hall of Fame head coach Ron Fraser in 1982 and originally performed by John Routh, the Miami Maniac has been a constant at Mark Light Field ever since. Some believe that the mascot idea was modeled after the original Orofino High School Maniacs, from the small town of Orofino, Idaho. The Maniac mascot was used there many decades prior, and has been the target of much scrutiny due to the high school's proximity adjacent to an Idaho State mental hospital. More recently, the mascot received national attention after Idaho State officials proposed adding the Maniac mascot to an Idaho vehicle license plate. Although primarily associated with the Miami Hurricanes' baseball team, the Maniac has performed at other sporting events including minor league baseball games and the College World Series. In 1985, the Maniac was \\"married\\" in a wedding broadcast to a national television audience on ESPN. The maniac has an anthropomorphic body with and sports orange fur on most of his body with patches of green on his head and nose. He usually wears a University of Miami baseball jersey with the number 1/2 on it. History The history of the Miami Maniac starts out at the University of South Carolina. An undergraduate student named John Routh had helped create the South Carolina Gamecocks' mascot Cocky. Routh's performance as Cocky at Gamecock baseball games had made such a favorable impression that he was invited to the 1981 College World Series to perform as the Series' official mascot. One of the coaches at the World Series that year was University of Miami head coach Ron Fraser. Fraser was always looking for opportunities to promote Hurricane baseball and college baseball in general and decided to create a mascot specifically for Hurricane baseball. The following year, Fraser and a major University donor helped create the Miami Maniac. They decided to introduce the Maniac during the Miami-FSU series that year and invited Routh down from South Carolina to show students how to work a crowd. At the end of the season, which was the Hurricanes' first World Series Championship, Fraser offered Routh a permanent position as Assistant Director of Marketing which included performing as both the Miami Maniac and Sebastian the Ibis. Routh had just graduated from South Carolina and accepted the position. During his tenure at the University, Routh created many of the cheers now associated with University of Miami athletics- the \\"C-A-N-E-S... Canes!\\" cheer was originally one he developed in character as the Maniac which was eventually picked up on by fans at Miami Hurricane football games. Wedding In March 1985, the Miami Maniac was \\"married\\" to Mrs. Maniac, who was performed by Nancy Vasquez, in a ceremony during a game between the Hurricanes and the Maine Black Bears. The fourteen-minute ceremony was broadcast in its entirety live to a national audience on ESPN. and was conducted by longtime Miami Hurricane baseball and football announcer Jay Rokeach. Sebastian the Ibis, the mascot of other Miami Hurricane sporting events, was the Maniac's best man. Others in attendance included the Budweiser Bud Man, McDonald's Grimace, and McGruff the Crime Dog. Other events In addition to performing at Miami Hurricane baseball games and other university functions, the Maniac also performs at other sporting events and charity events. The Maniac has appeared at various minor league baseball games throughout Florida and has entertained in 49 states as well as Europe and Japan. From 1983 through 1991, the Maniac was the official mascot of the NCAA Division 1 College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska, although the character had to wear a neutral jersey during each series to avoid favoritism towards the 'Canes when they were a participant. Appearance The Miami Maniac is anthropomorphic with fur that is primarily orange with flashes of green, which are the Hurricanes' official colors. During most University of Miami games, the Maniac will wear a Hurricane baseball jersey, although he has been known to dress in other outfits for special occasions, such as during the 1988 Winter Olympics in which he \\"performed\\" a different winter sport each night.

The work sits within the center of a pool in Holcomb Gardens on the grounds of Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. The sculpture depicts the Greek goddess Persephone. In 1993 the sculpture was examined by the Save Outdoor Sculpture! program produced by the Smithsonian Institution. Description Persephone depicts the Greek goddess Persephone standing on a limestone base in the center of a concrete octagonal pool. The bronze female figure is draped from the waist down.

Death Guild opened on March 15, 1993, and is currently held every Monday at DNA Lounge in San Francisco. Death Guild has always been an 18-and- over dance club, a rarity in San Francisco where most dance clubs are 21+. Death Guild has also been the promoter of most of the gothic and industrial live shows in San Francisco since the mid-1990s. The Death Guild crew are also responsible for Death Guild Thunderdome, one of the most popular attractions at Burning Man since the mid-1990s.  History  The party was created by David King (DJ Decay) at the now-defunct venue The Pit (now AsiaSF). In June 1994, the club moved to DNA Lounge for one night, and then to the Trocadero Transfer, which remained its home for several years, with DJs Decay, Lucretia, Melting Girl, Joe Radio and Damon. The Trocadero began having licensing problems in 1997, eventually closing for good in early 1998. In March 1997, Death Guild moved to Big Heart City, and then to Manhattan Lounge in November 1998. It returned to Big Heart City in June 2003, and in October 2003 moved to Glas Kat, a new venue in the old Trocadero space. Death Guild finally returned to DNA Lounge in October 2008, immediately after DNA Lounge had succeeded in changing its liquor license from 21+ to one that allows 18+ and all-ages events.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Houston Astros in 2014 and 2015. After growing up in Long Beach, California, Singleton was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in 2009. He was one of several prospects traded to the Astros in exchange for Hunter Pence in 2011. He signed a $10 million contract with the Astros before making his major league debut in 2014, but he struggled, last playing for the Astros in 2015 before they relegated him to the minor leagues and releasing him in 2018. Early life Singleton played baseball at Millikan High School in Long Beach, California. He committed to play at California State University, Long Beach a few months before the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft. Career =Philadelphia Phillies= The Philadelphia Phillies selected Singleton in the eighth round of the 2009 MLB Draft. He had been projected for selection as high as the second round of the draft, but his senior year statistics caused him to fall a few rounds. Singleton reported to the Gulf Coast League Phillies, where he played 31 minor league games that year. He spent 2010 with the Class A Lakewood BlueClaws, where he hit for a .290 batting average, 14 home runs and 77 runs batted in (RBI). Prior to the 2011 season, Singleton was considered the Phillies' second best prospect by Baseball America. =Houston Astros= On July 29, 2011, the Phillies traded Singleton, Jarred Cosart, Josh Zeid, and Domingo Santana to the Houston Astros in exchange for Hunter Pence.

Singleton tested positive for marijuana in June 2012. He competed in the Arizona Fall League that offseason, and had a second positive test for marijuana in December. On January 9, 2013, Singleton was suspended for 50 games due to his second failed drug test. Singleton said that he had grown up around friends who used the drug and that he had been using it \\"on and off\\" since he was 14 years old. He spent a month in a rehabilitation center after the second failed test. Oklahoma City RedHawks in Following the 2013 season, the Astros added Singleton to their 40 man roster. On June 2, 2014, the Astros signed Singleton to a 5-year contract that guaranteed him $10 million, and could have been worth as much as $35 million. The extension was the first to be signed by a drafted player with no major league experience. Singleton was promoted from the Oklahoma City RedHawks of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) to make his major league debut on June 3. Singleton made his major league debut for the Astros on June 3, 2014 against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. In his first game, he went 1‚Äì3 with a home run, 2 RBI's, a walk, and two strikeouts.

The dam forms the El Capitan Reservoir and serves mainly to supply water to the city of San Diego as well as providing flood control. The dam is connected to the San Diego municipal water system via the El Capitan Pipeline, which extends approximately to the city. It is the second largest storage facility in San Diego's water supply system, after San Vicente Dam. History A dam was first proposed for the San Diego River after several years of drought in the early 1900s. The city of San Diego commissioned Engineer Hiram N. Savage to design the structure. Savage proposed the river be impounded at Mission Gorge, in what is now Mission Trails Regional Park. The bedrock canyon had ideal geology for a masonry dam, and the site was only from the city limits. However, the reservoir would have flooded a large area of the Mission Valley (now downtown Santee, which was productive agricultural land at the time. Its large surface area would also have been subject to evaporation losses. The City of San Diego favored a dam site at El Capitan, which was located more than further upstream. The chief benefit of the El Capitan site was that it would create a narrower, deeper reservoir with a more efficient ratio of water storage to evaporation. However, the site had a greater depth to bedrock and would require the construction of a more expensive embankment dam, as well as a longer aqueduct to transport water to the city. Savage refused to consider the El Capitan site and was fired by the city in 1923.http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20081101/news_1cz1history.html The reservoir, with the back side of dam seen in the distance Native Americans of the Capitan Grande Reservation, part of which would be flooded by the proposed reservoir, stiffly opposed the project. Some of the Indians insisted the city give them title to new lands before allowing them to move grave sites from the reservoir area. In 1919 Congress passed the El Capitan Act, which transferred the Indians' water rights and lands to the city of San Diego, in exchange for resettlement elsewhere and a payment of $361,420 by the city.https://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/v56-1/v56-1thorne.pdf The initial act covered only the relocation of people and livestock in the reservoir flood zone, but later was extended to much of the watershed of the San Diego River above El Capitan, in order to protect water quality. Local water districts, including the Cuyamaca Flume Company, also fought against the project, fearing that the dam would reduce the amount of San Diego River water available for their use. Litigation dragged on for years, to the point where \\"cash-strapped San Diego taxpayers had begun to consider other reservoir sites\\". Construction on the dam was financed by $4.5 million in revenue bonds issued in 1924, but even with voter approval, the project did not move forward until the 1930s, when San Diego finally won its case for the necessary water rights. In an unusual turn of events, the city approached Savage to design the El Capitan dam, but Savage refused, on the grounds that it was a poor site. In 1931, the decision of whether a dam should be built at El Capitan or Savage's preferred Mission Gorge was held to a public vote. The Mission Gorge site lost by a narrow margin. Savage eventually agreed to design the dam, the first of its kind he had built. Just six months after the dam's completion, the much maligned Savage died of heart failure. Construction on the dam began in December 1931 using the hydraulic fill method. The embankment was completed in 1934, at a final cost of $5.8 million. It was the second municipal dam to be constructed in the San Diego River basin, after the 1884 Cuyamaca Dam.http://www.calwater.ca.gov/Admin_Record/C-064580.pdf The El Capitan Pipeline, which connects the reservoir to the city, was completed in the same year. The reservoir did not fill to capacity until 1938, after storms soaked Southern California causing severe flooding.http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt8p3006bz;NAAN=13030&doc.view;=frames&chunk.id;=d0e464&toc.depth;=1&toc.id;=&brand;=calisphere Description El Capitan Reservoir El Capitan Dam is a rock-filled embankment dam with an impervious clay core. The dam is situated in a narrow granite gorge, just below the confluence of Conejos Creek with the San Diego River. The dam is high from the foundations and high from the riverbed, long at the crest, and wide at the crest. Altogether, the dam contains of material.http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/profile?s=ELC&type;=dam The spillway is a concrete overflow channel on the north side of the dam with no gates, and overflows once water levels exceed the conservation pool. The capacity of the spillway is . Normal water releases into the El Capitan Pipeline are made through a control tower with six valves, allowing water to be drawn from different elevations in order to compensate for temperature and turbidity changes. The pipeline has a capacity of 61 million gallons (1,727,000 m3) per day, or . At full capacity, El Capitan Reservoir is about long and has a water elevation of . The reservoir surface area is , and the capacity is . It is the biggest of San Diego's local surface water supply reservoirs (San Vicente Reservoir is larger, but is filled mainly with imported Colorado River water). El Capitan rarely fills because its capacity is so large relative to the average runoff from the watershed above it. The average storage levels range from a high of in April to a low of in November. Water levels are unpredictable, as severe floods and multi-year droughts are not uncommon to the region.http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi- progs/profile?s=ELC&type;=res The average annual rainfall at El Capitan Dam is ,http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/profile?s=ELC&type;=precip ranging from in the lowlands to in the highest mountains.http://www.sandiego.gov/water/operations/environment/pdf/chapter2.pdf The average annual inflow into the reservoir is . The reservoir is allowed to a maximum 2/3 of capacity throughout the winter and early spring to prevent uncontrolled spills. However, since the dam is situated so high in the watershed, it has a limited capacity to control localized flooding along the lower San Diego River.

Critics have praised Awkward Black Girl for its witty humor and unique, realistic portrayal of African-American women. New York Times critic Jon Caramica describes the show as ‚Äúfull of sharp, pointillist humor that‚Äôs extremely refreshing.‚Äù On her site beyondblackwhite.com, Christelyn Karazin blogs, ‚ÄúAren't you tired of seeing black women look like idiots on television? Here's a girl‚Äîwhom I suspect is a lot like the women who read this blog‚Äîquirky, funny, a little unsure of herself, rocks her hair natural and is beautifully brown skinned.‚Äù Erin Stegeman of The Tangled Web praises Awkward Black Girl for defying stereotypes of African American women and being ‚Äúan uber-relatable slice of life, narrated by J‚Äôs inner-ramblings that run through any awkward person‚Äôs mind.‚Äù In its honest portrayal of the African-American experience and its depiction of the main character, J, as a \\"cultural mulatto\\", Awkward Black Girl belongs to the \\"New Black Aesthetic\\", a term coined by African-American novelist Trey Ellis to describe an artistic movement that aims to create fuller meanings of black identity by exploring intra-racial diversity, reexamining stereotypes, and presenting blackness authentically.

His father was a judge, while his mother Eudoxie Kriganovsky, took care of the household. Gleb was encouraged in his art studies at an early age. He graduated in 1911 with highest honors from the Kazan Art School after four years of training under Nicolai Fechin (Russian: –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–π –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á –§–µ—à–∏–Ω; 1881‚Äì1955).Hailey 1936 Russia He completed his formal art studies at the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg (1911‚Äì1917) under Ilya Yefimovich Repin (Russian: –ò–ª—å—èÃÅ –ï—Ñ–∏ÃÅ–º–æ–≤–∏—á –†–µÃÅ–ø–∏–Ω, 1844‚Äì1930) and Konstantin Yegorovich Makovsky (Russian: –ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω –ï–≥–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –ú–∞–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π, 1839‚Äì1915). Known outside of the academy for the quality of his work, Ilyin received invitations to do portraits of the imperial family (portrait of Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich) and Saint Petersburg‚Äôs high society (portrait of Feodor Chaliapin). His work displayed at the Fall Exhibit of the Imperial Academy of Art in 1916 won a major prize. Gleb left Saint Petersburg in 1917 after the outbreak of the October Revolution and moved to Kazan for a short period until the Red Army captured the city.Hafen 1948 He escaped over the Ural Mountains to Omsk, along with other family members. On their way East, Ilyin met Natalie Melnikoff. After a short courtship they married in Chita, a city north of Mongolia. The artist supported himself by painting portraits of Japanese officers stationed in Chita. After receiving letters of introduction and recommendations to prominent figures in Tokyo, Ilyin joined other White Russian refugees on their way to Japan in 1918. Japan In Tokyo, the artist received commissions for portraits of government officials and members of the imperial court. After a series of successful and profitable exhibits, Ilyin moved to San Francisco with other family members in 1923. United States His first exhibit in 1924 gained him a reputation as one of the most popular portrait painters in California. His aristocratic background opened doors to American high society and the homes of wealthy families. The artist commanded the highest prices for his work, frequently asking twice the average annual salary in California in the 1920s, for his commissioned pieces. In 1928, The San Francisco Chronicle called him one of the city‚Äôs most skilled painters. In January 1930, the artist was invited to The White House to paint the portrait of Lou Henry Hoover, the wife of the U.S. president, her first portrait as the First Lady. The Berkeley Gazette of November 16, 1933, in its assessment of Gleb Ilyin' s exhibit held at the Mills College Art Gallery wrote: \\"Ilyin's fusion of the academic and the modern in his work is indicated by his emphasis on the beauty of line, and his feeling for form, as well as by his use of color. While some of his portraits are in the modern style, others resemble the old masters. He is said to have been unusually successful in catching the spirit and manner of such great classic painters as Lawrence, Van Dyck, and Velasquez‚Äù. In 1936, a Los Angeles Times journalist reviewing Ilyin's exhibit at the Stendhal Gallery described a most unusual incident when Ilyin walked into the Gallery and saw there his first art teacher from Kazan, Nicolai Fechin who had moved to Hollywood as one of the best established artists in the Western United States. Later life Gleb Ilyin shared his studio with his older brother Peter Ilyin at 2977 Clay Street in San Francisco‚Äôs Pacific Heights district. Both frequently displayed their works in the same galleries and museums. In the mid-1940s, he was briefly a resident of Colorado. The artist spent his later years in Northern California on the Russian River where he died in Sebastopol on October 14, 1968.

The cartoon is a parody of the movie Stanley and Livingstone starring Spencer Tracy and Cedric Hardwicke. The title parodies the 1930 documentary Africa Speaks!  Plot synopsis  The narrator introduces the audience to Africa. The journey begins in the heart of Darkest Africa. Porky Pig is leading a group of African people as they sing, carrying items. Then, during their song, they sing \\"We don't know where we're going, but we're going!\\". Meanwhile, a sign says, \\"Welcome to Africa Lions Club\\". Then, Porky and the Africans approach a sour-pussed caricature of Spencer Tracy named Stanley, a reference to his role in \\"Stanley and Livingstone\\". Stanley presumes that Porky is Dr. Livingstone, but Porky tells him his name. Stanley shrugs and lets Porky and the Africans continue marching. The narrator tells the audience that during their journey, they saw interesting specimen of wild life. An ostrich has put his head into a hole. Underground, the ostrich is actually sleeping on a pillow. Meanwhile, two lions are eating bones of their prey. The second lion gets a columba, and together, the two lions grab the ends of the bone. The lion says \\"Make a wish\\", and after breaking the bone, they continue eating. High in the tree tops, a mother monkey is taking her baby for a breath of fresh air. The mother is using her tail to swing her baby is if in a carriage. Meanwhile, emerging out of the grass comes a gorilla, and as it turns around, it reveals itself to be a caricature of Tony Galento with a beer, saying that he'll \\"moider da bum\\". A native is seen using a blowgun to \\"put meat on the table\\". Just then, it is revealed that the native is playing a carnival- related game to win a ham. The person in charge (with Mel Blanc's voice imitating Rochester from The Jack Benny Program) gives the native a ham to put meat on the table. Later, after nightfall, the narrator says that at night, the African jungle is filled with silence, but noises start being heard. A tired Porky pops his head out of his tent, and yells to the animals \\"QUIET!\\", and goes back to sleep. Meanwhile, Stanley is still looking for Dr. Livingstone. He looks in a mother kangaroo's pouch, only to be honked on the nose by her baby. The next day, the Africans and Porky resume their march. A tree has a poster that is a re-election poster for \\"King of the Jungle\\" (promising \\"Thirty Coconuts Every Thursday\\"- a reference to a popular \\"Thirty Dollars Every Thursday\\" pension plan of the day). Meanwhile, the explorers come upon a very unusual situation. A cat kicks an elephant out of her house, and until he can pay his rent, she'll be keeping his trunk. Then the elephant, now without his trunk, starts crying and says that his trunk has all his stuff in it. A vulture is looking for food. He sees three baby deer who wandered away from their mother. The vulture starts charging at them, and the deer run into a clump of grass. Just then, the grass lowers, as the deer use \\"Air Raid\\" on the vulture. They shoot down the vulture, and the deer laugh in a villainous manner. Back with Porky, a little African native is running, yelling \\"Two arms!\\", and random gibberish. He points to the village, as the narrator says that the boy says that the villagers have spotted a strange white man in the village. Porky then drags Stanley over to the village, as the narrator says that his journey is finally over. Stanley presumes that the white man is Dr. Livingstone. The white man reveals himself to be \\"Cake-Icer\\", as he is a music teacher (a reference to Kay Kyser, and his \\"Kollege of Musical Knowledge\\" radio program). He asks the students if he's right, and then a monkey comes out of Stanley's hat saying \\"Yeah!\\" many times. Cake-Icer wants everyone to dance, and music starts with an elephant using his trunk like a tuba. Everybody starts dancing, including two fat Africans. The narrator says that after a long day, they decide to return home. Then, Porky and the Africans start running, as the Africans are singing a different song this time. The narrator says his farewell to Africa, and then the actual continent (with a face) moves and waves goodbye. Edits Many clips of the short were removed on the 1968 colorized version on Nickelodeon in 1990 due to its racial stereotyped theme as the short reduced to 5 minutes. The short begins with the continents and immediately goes straight to the animal clips (which is its main focus) starting with the ostrich. After the gorilla clip, it immediately fades black to the nighttime clip. However, the \\"King of the jungle\\" poster is left attached. Scenes later after the baby deer clip, it fades black to Stanley presuming Dr. Livingstone, and then cuts to the clip where the \\"Cake-Icer\\" pointing to his introduction, and following by animals playing instruments along with a clip of the \\"Cake-Icer\\" and immediately goes back to the continents. However, the face and the tissue does not show on the actual continent. Instead it immediately zooms out the continent as the cartoon ends. Reception The cartoon was reviewed by Boxoffice on February 3, 1940, saying: \\"Play this one by all means. It is composed of the stuff that shakes the rafters and fairly blows the roof off when the laughter starts to whip around. Porky goes to Africa on a safari. What occurs when he does a little exploring was cooked up by the fertile brain that injected the right touches of unusual caricature and bang-up comedy to give 'em the shrieks. And there is an ending that will knock 'em right out of their seats.\\" Motion Picture Exhibitor agreed, on February 7: \\"One of the best of the Leon Schlesinger series... The belly laughs are many, and the gags good.\\" On February 20, Motion Picture Herald said: \\"This time porcine Porky is a leader of a safari into the darkest regions of the Black Continent. Particularly productive of funny bone tickling in the spoofing of the Stanley search for Dr. Livingstone. There are additional sights of the strange behavior of animals and natives. In fact, the whole fun and frivolity piece is good.\\"  Cast  *Mel Blanc as Porky Pig, Stanley, Africans, Lion, Cat, Elephant, Africa, Galento Gorilla, Deer, Carnival African, Kangaroo *Robert C.

Its studio and transmitter were located in Elm Grove. For the station's entire existence, WAWA was the sister station to WAWA-FM (later WLUM-FM). The station signed on the air in 1961, and signed off in 1988, when the owner returned the license to the FCC. Since the FCC no longer re-licenses daytime-only stations, the 1590 AM frequency allocation in the Milwaukee market is considered to be permanently deleted. History Originally airing an adult standards format, WAWA quickly found success playing rhythm and blues music, starting in 1963. The format was popular with Milwaukee's African-American community, and was a serious rival to WNOV during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. They also simulcast part-time with their FM sister station at 102.1 FM, later carrying the WLUM call letters, with their sister station. All-Pro Broadcasting purchased both stations in 1979. In 1988, they were able to buy a stronger station at 1290 AM. Since FCC rules at the time would not allow them to keep both AM stations, and because they were unable to sell WAWA, they signed 1590 AM off the air for good and returned the station's license to the FCC.

First constructed in 1910 by the Great Western Power Company as part of the Upper North Fork Feather River Project, the dam was originally planned to be built of masonry but was later changed to an earthfill design. The dam's primary purpose was to store water for the Western Canal Company, an irrigation district in the Central Valley and a subsidiary of Great Western. The dam provided flows for a hydroelectric plant about downstream at the Big Bend Powerhouse, today submerged by the reservoir behind Oroville Dam. Canyon Dam was modified in 1927 and 1962 to increase its usable storage.

Program background It was noticed in Ku-ring-gai that while bush regenerators intended to preserve habitat and wildlife, in practice some Bushcare Groups were responsible for the wholesale removal of weeds which often lessened the biodiversity value of the ecosystem that the volunteers were trying to protect. In New South Wales, where Ku-ring-gai is located, the state government has many regulations that effectively deny people the opportunity to have native animals for pets. On their web page they have detailed their objections.objections In an attempt to create positive relationships between people and wildlife, the program WildThings was created; however due to the restrictive legislative environment around mammals, the program has concentrated on invertebrates, fish and reptiles. Initiatives There are two main components to WildThings:main components * The placement of Trigona carbonaria hives. This program places native bee hives on residential properties, assisting with pollination while increasing awareness of this insect. As of 2011, over 200 hives have been distributed. * The conversion of unwanted swimming pools into ponds. Baby boomers, in particular, have pools that are no longer being used. Studies conducted by the University of Western Sydney, on a random selection of converted ponds, showed they promote invertebrate biodiversity and their water quality is suitable for recreational use. An added bonus is that a converted pool is essentially a rainwater tank without a lid, making large amounts of water available for a variety of activities around the home, saving potable water, electricity and eliminating the need for chemicals.

In the episode, Mark meets a pair of tree creatures who are expected to participate in a public mating ritual sanctioned by New York City as a festival. Meanwhile, Callie demands to have sex with Mark to ease the pain from her shedding, and Randall loses his penis after visiting a movie theater. Written by Daniel Powell and Greg White and directed by Aaron Augenblick and Lucy Snyder, \\"Treegasm\\" was inspired by funny-looking trees, such as trees that appear to have genitalia or are having sex. The episode also marked a milestone with the staff, as it was the first episode to feature creatures they came up with themselves, as opposed to common creatures such as werewolves or zombies. Stand-up comic and actor Kumail Nanjiani guest stars in the episode as the tree Neel. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was watched by 2.05 million viewers in its original airing, an increase in viewership compared to the previous episode, \\"Blob Gets Job\\". \\"Treegasm\\" and six other episodes from the season were released on DVD in the United States on October 5, 2010. Plot Tourists visit Central Park for 'Treegasm', a once-in-a-lifetime mating ritual between two tree creatures, or 'treatures'. The trees grow towards each other for decades before engaging in a ritual known as \\"screwing\\". Mark Lilly cannot understand why people care about two trees losing their virginity. Demon bureaucrat Twayne Boneraper has been appointed to be in charge of the ceremony, but gives the job to Mark and wizard Leonard Powers as he has to spend four days to get fitted for a triple- breasted suit. Meanwhile, demon Callie Maggotbone demands to have sex with Mark, and Leonard explains to him that a female demon's body is so toxic that she has to periodically shed it for a new one, and sex is the only thing that can ease her pain. Later in Central Park, Mark introduces himself to the tree creatures, Nicky and Neel, as their \\"screwing coordinator\\". Mark remarks that it is refreshing for two beings to be so committed to each other as opposed to just having sex with strangers. Neel begins to feel anxious about the ritual, as Mark's remarks about having sex with others sounds more exciting. Later, Neel breaks up with Nicky as Mark opened his eyes for other opportunities. Neel states that Nicky is predictable and that he wants someone crazy. Mark accepts Neel's change of heart, but Leonard explains to him that the tree creatures are forced to mate because their roots run so deep that they encompass Manhattan. If Neel does not ejaculate soon, his root could swell up and endanger the entire city. Twayne assigns Mark to fix the problem, and Mark enlists his zombie roommate Randall to talk about his unhealthy sex experiences to Neel. Randall's story makes Neel change his mind and go back to Nicky. Later, 'Treegasm' is about to commence, but Neel is nervous because of the pressure and the event's many spectators. His roots begin to swell and come up above ground and seize different buildings. The pressure causes his sexual organ to go flaccid, and Leonard quickly enchants him with a magical spell that acts like Viagra. Callie takes Mark with her into a portable toilet for the final sex before her shedding. Just as Neel is about to penetrate Nicky, Callie sheds and reveals herself in her new form while standing naked, mimicking The Birth of Venus. The pressure causes Neel to suffer from premature ejaculation and he ejaculates all over the park. Later, when the crowd has left, Leonard enchants Neel with a spell to make him less nervous and the ritual continues without spectators. Callie and Mark meet at a bar later for drinks, but when Mark invites her to sit with him, she teases him, saying she lost respect for him for allowing her to do some of the things she has done to him. Meanwhile, Randall loses his penis after having sex with a female he met at the movie theater. After he fails to find it, he tries to get used to life without having a penis, but considers killing himself. However, he receives a call from the police who informs him that they have found his penis, but tells him that it did not fall off, it ran away because it did not like the way Randall treated it. To make it come back, Randall has to follow a few conditions, such as accepting it as an equal, which Randall gladly approves of. Production \\"Treegasm\\" was co-written by Daniel Powell (pictured) alongside Greg White. \\"Treegasm\\" was written by Daniel Powell and Greg White and directed by Aaron Augenblick and Lucy Snyder. The story originated from when series developer and executive producer David M. Stern saw a tree in his backyard that looked like it had an \\"enormous set of testicles\\". Later, a writer's assistant for the series showed him a website with images of different trees that looked like they had genitalia or were having sex. The trees spurred an idea involving two trees that had been growing towards each other for 150 years and then one of them gets \\"cold feet\\" at the last minute. Creator Devin Clark said that he likes the episode because it focuses on creatures that the staff came up with themselves, rather than classic mythological creatures. Prior to the episode, the writers mainly used common beings, such as werewolves and zombies, so that viewers would get familiar with the series' world. Co-writer Powell researched \\"tree mythology\\", such as the evil trees from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, before writing the episode, but stated that he could not find much on the subject. According to Stern, it was \\"very hard\\" to express in script form how funny it was that the trees do not move at all. Since they do not move, their mouths were designed to look like nutcracker mouths. Stand-up comic and actor Kumail Nanjiani guest starred in the episode as the tree Neel. In addition to the regular cast, recurring guest voice actors Julie Klausner and Pete Holmes made minor appearances in the episode as an anchorwoman and Al Pacino, respectively. The music in \\"Treegasm\\" was composed by Andrew Landry and Bradford Reed. The score for the episode's cold open is one of Clark's favorites of the season, stating that he \\"love[s] the '80s stuff\\". Reception and release \\"Treegasm\\" originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 14, 2010. The episode was watched by 2.05 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. It also acquired a 1.1 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, a higher rating than the previous episode, \\"Blob Gets Job\\", which had a 0.7 rating. \\"Treegasm\\" was also an improvement in total viewership from \\"Blob Gets Job\\", which was viewed by 1.36 million. Overall, \\"Treegasm\\" was the third most watched episode of the series' first season. According to Stern, the response of \\"Treegasm\\" was more positive than previous episodes. However, it was met with a rather negative review from About.com critic Nancy Basile, who wrote \\"I'm enjoying some of Ugly Americans, though I think I could have done without the 'Treegasm' episode.\\" On October 5, 2010, the episode was released as part of the single-disc DVD set Ugly Americans: Season 1, Volume 1 along with the six other episodes. Crew members David M. Stern, Daniel Powell and Devin Clark participated in the episode's audio commentary. The set also includes bonus features, such as an art gallery, the original web episodes of 5-On and sneak peek clips and art from then-upcoming episodes.

Grossman received a bachelor of arts from the University of Virginia (1960), a B.Phil. from the University of Oxford (1962), and his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University (1965). Grossman collaborated with Barro to produce the influential article \\"A General Disequilibrium Model of Income,\\" which, for many years, held the distinction of being the most cited article ever published in the American Economic Review.Spolaore (2008). The article explored the idea that disequilibrium in one market can have spillover effects to another market, creating a distinction between notional demand and effective demand. Grossman and Barro expanded on their work and produced the classic textbook Money, Employment, and Inflation in 1976.Kolmar, 803. Following his work on disequilibrium, Grossman made several contributions to the study of economic policy and political economy.Spolaore (2008). His work transitioned as he investigated the institutional frictions behind Keynesian macroeconomic models.Kolmar, 803‚Äì804. Grossman's work in political economy included the study of conflict. In a 2003 paper he explored the use of expected future scarcity as an explanatory variable in current conflicts.Kolmar, 806‚Äì807. Grossman also investigated property rights. He analyzed property rights formation under \\"common pool\\" situations, where all resources are initially held in common, and \\"initial claims\\" cases, where individuals have an initial claim to resources before rights are established.Kolmar, 807‚Äì808. Grossman's work showed how property rights could emerge in a decentralized manner.Kolmar, 809. Grossman also studied the trade-offs between a decentralized property rights and a centralized authority. He found a centralized authority would emerge when creating defensive work were relatively expensive and appropriations (taxation) were relatively easy. Otherwise, a decentralized system would emerge.Kolmar, 808‚Äì809. Grossman died suddenly in 2004 while attending a conference in Marseilles, France.Spolaore (2008).

Baker et al.(2007) unraveled the complexities of the late Pleistocene to Holocene habitation of the Niah Cave. Flenley (1998) and Bird et al. (2005) suggested of a continuous savanna habitat with from the Asian mainland into Borneo and interrupted by a network of ancient Sunda River system. Dodson et al. (1995) postulated that the biogeographical history of Southeast Asia contributed to extensive admixture during Pleistocene low sea levels of genetic groups of an obligate freshwater fish (the river catfish, Hemibagrus nemurus) isolated during periods of high sea levels. During Pleistocene glacial maxima, the sea level was lower than at present and the islands of the Sunda shelf (Sumatra, Borneo and Java) and the Asian mainland were connected by lowlands traversed by rivers. Thus, the fish from Baram, Endau and Mekong rivers were genetically related. Piper et al. (2008) identified 27 mammal, 11 bird and eight reptile taxa recovered from the Terminal Pleistocene deposits at Niah Cave. Some of these animals are extinct and extent in distribution in Borneo.Gathorne-Hardy et al., 2002 Other biologists suggested Pleistocene refugia found in Borneo to explain for the gene flow and genetic divergent of certain species. Biodiversity factors in Borneo and extinction Borneo island, made up of three countries which are Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak), Brunei (Sultanate) and Indonesia (Kalimantan), is the third largest island in the world. Borneo island is a region that is rich in biodiversity. It comprises 15,000 plant species, more than 1,400 amphibians, birds, fish, mammals, reptiles and insects. One of the amazing plants that you can find in Borneo is Rafflesia, which is the largest flower in the world. First of all, Borneo covers an area of with different biomes. Biomes refer to the major ecological community, which predominant vegetation and characterized by adaptations of organisms to that particular environment. Borneo forests are some of the most biodiverse on the planet and with ideal climate to contain organisms. Some of the forests in Borneo are tropical rainforests, mangroves swamp forests, peat swamp forests, montane forests, heath forests and dipterocarp forests. These physically diverse habitat provide different conditions for different organisms to live. Therefore, the biodiversity is increasing as the organisms have found their own favorite habitat to live. For example, orange utan exist only on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra because orange utan is dependence on forests for fruits and shelters. Another factor contribute to the high level of biodiversity in Borneo is the evolution of species in Borneo. Evolution can be defined as all the changes that have occurred in living things since beginning of life. Evolution provide the better adaptation for the species. There is still many undiscovered species in Borneo. One of the recent new species discovered in Borneo is the lungless frog, which can fly. The high level of biodiversity will be formed if there is a small variation in environmental conditions and a moderate amount of disturbance. A stable condition is favored by species if compared to unstable condition. Species can develop and reproduce if the situation is favorable. No doubt, a disaster can totally cause extinction to an area, for example: flood in Thailand (2011). However, a small or moderate amount of disturbance may increase the biodiversity as well. This has happened when farmers burn a small area of forest for their plantation. Glacial phenomena on Mount Kinabalu as evidence of the snow fall and ice-capped mountains in the hot equatorial region [and ice sheet on lowland areas in the temperate regions described in many other papers]. The effects of LGM were for the Last Glacial Maximum, temperatures lower than at present are recorded. Globally, because of lowering of temperature caused climate change, ice/snow built up on mountains, there was a break in the hydrological cycle so that the water was not discharged back into the rivers and seas. Thus the sea level dropped to 120 m from the present. Vegetational belts and mammalian communities underwent major reorganisation. All shallow seabeds were exposed causing Peninsular Malaysia to be connected by land-bridges to Borneo, Sumatra, Java and Bali to become a big landmass changing the wind direction, sea current, and separating the population into several isolated forested refuges. It is unknown if the Bornean tiger became extinct in recent times or prehistoric times.2 References Bibliography *Glacial phenomena on Mount Kinabalu, Sabah.

Playing career A Ponsonby player in the Auckland Rugby League competition, Delgrosso was first selected for the New Zealand side in 1921. He made his Test debut against Great Britain in 1924 and went on to play in nine Test matches.DELGROSSO, Frank August - 1921, 1925-28 nzleague.co.nz This included captaining New Zealand in the second and third Test matches in 1924. He also played for the Auckland Provincial team in 1924 and scored a try in a 13-28 loss. He was part of the 1926-1927 tour of Great Britain. Delgrosso was also an Auckland representative and was part of the side that won the Northern Union Cup in 1919 as well as playing for both Auckland City and Auckland Province against touring sides. In 1925 Delgrosso was selected for the North Island team in an inter-island match as part of the lead up to selecting the New Zealand side. He scored a try in a 27-9 win. In October of that year he also played for the Auckland Provincial team against the touring Queensland side. He kicked a conversion and 3 penalties however Auckland was trounced by 54 points to 14 against an outstanding opponent. In the 1927 season he scored 43 points for Ponsonby which was the 4th highest in the competition however he did not play in any of the Auckland representative matches. He did however play against Auckland early in the season for the New Zealand Auckland representative team. Delgrosso captained Ponsonby in 1929 and 1930.Coffey, John and Bernie Wood Auckland, 100 years of rugby league, 1909-2009, 2009. . At the end of 1930 Delgrosso was sensationally suspended for three seasons by the Auckland Rugby League, which would have effectively ended his career.Suspended and Warned Off NZ Truth, Issue 1298, 30 October 1930, P. 17.

He began his playing career again at the beginning of the 1931 season and top scored through the first grade championship and Roope Rooster competitions with 70 points from 35 goals.. He again top scored in the competition in 1932 with 74 points. The 1933 season was to be his last. He played the first 3 matches of the season before being injured in a Round 3 match with Marist and leaving the field. He decided to retire at this point finishing his club career with a remarkable 181 appearances in a Ponsonby jersey, scoring 761 points, comfortably the most of any player in Auckland club history to this point.

Context Buenos Aires, a colony city of Spain in South America, ousted the Spanish viceroy in the 1810 May Revolution and began the Argentine War of Independence, sending armies to other areas still loyal to the Spanish monarchy. One of those areas was the Upper Peru (modern Bolivia), but Manuel Belgrano prevented the royalist armies from marching to Buenos Aires with his victories at Tucum√°n and Salta. However, he was defeated when he tried to counter-attack, at Vilcapugio and Ayohuma.Luna, pp. 43-111 Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear and other veterans of the Peninsular War reinforced the armies of Buenos Aires. They influenced the local politics, causing the Revolution of October 8, 1812. San Mart√≠n had a military victory at the Battle of San Lorenzo against a raid from Montevideo. When Belgrano was defeated, San Mart√≠n was appointed his successor as the commander of the Army of the North. Historian Bartolom√© Mitre considers it the result of a plot by Alvear, who sought to remove San Mart√≠n from the politics of Buenos Aires by sending him to a distant mission. Later historians as Norberto Galasso consider instead that, despite the dangers, heading that army was an honour, pointing that Alvear sought to do so at a later point. Juan Canter points as well that the mailings of the supreme director Gervasio Antonio de Posadas to San Mart√≠n were highly respectful.Galasso, p. 110 Meeting San Mart√≠n left Buenos Aires in December, 1813. He had order to relieve Belgrano and send him back to the city, to be judged for the defeats in the Upper Peru. They knew each other before the meeting by mailing each other, with the intermediation of the Spanish Jos√© Mil√° de la Roca. Both of them shared their rejection to absolutism and belonged to the faction of the late Mariano Moreno.Galasso, pp. 111-112 It is widely considered that they met at the Yatasto relay, to the point that the event is named after the place. Portraits and other art allusions use that name as well. However, historian Julio Arturo Benencia considers that the meeting could have taken place at the \\"Algarrobos\\" relay, two leagues to the west of Yatasto. The exact date in unclear as well, and could have been at either January 30 or January 17.Galasso, p. 112 Initially, San Mart√≠n resisted the instructions related to Belgrano: he considered that he was the best military leader in the army, and that his departure would have negative effects on the morale of the troops. Posadas insisted two months later, and Belgrano left the army.Galasso, pp. 113-114 As his health was delicate, he did not return to Buenos Aires, moving instead to Cordoba to await the news there.Luna, pp. 117-121 After leaving, Belgrano wrote again to San Mart√≠n, advising him to strictly abide to the local religious customs. Jos√© de San Mart√≠n was partially agnostic, and Belgrano feared that the royalists may use this as propaganda against him, as it was done before against Juan Jos√© Castelli during the ill-fated first Upper Peru campaign.Galasso, p. 114 Aftermath Manuel Belgrano finally stayed in Luj√°n to await the trial, and wrote his autobiography during that time. All charges against him were dismissed a short time later, as nobody formulated a definite accusation. Then, he was sent to a diplomatic mission to Europe.Luna, pp. 122-124 San Mart√≠n stayed only a couple of months in the Army of the North. He considered that guerrilla warfare was a better option to face the royalists, and entrusted Mart√≠n Miguel de G√ºemes to direct the operations in Salta, while the Army of the North stayed in Tucum√°n.Galasso, pp. 114-121 San Mart√≠n would move later to Mendoza, where he raised the Army of the Andes with Chilean expatriates. The successful crossing of the Andes allowed San Mart√≠n to avoid the harsh terrain of the Upper Peru and attack Lima by sea.Galasso, pp. 129-130 References Bibliography * * Category:Argentine War of Independence Category:Non-combat military operations involving Argentina Category:Manuel Belgrano Category:Jos√© de San Mart√≠n Category:1814 in Argentina Category:January 1814 events ","title":"Yatasto relay"},{"id":"33641824","text":"Harry Douglas \\"Doug\\" Anderson (28 October 1926 ‚Äì 15 October 2016) was a New Zealand rugby league footballer who represented New Zealand in the 1954 World Cup.

History California Zephyr at the depot on its last western run, 1970 The depot was constructed by the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad in 1910 at a cost of US$750,000. The depot was the main jewel of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, and was designed by Chicago architect Henry Schlacks, who was best known in Chicago for his design of churches, but had also designed the Denver and Rio Grande Depot in Grand Junction, Colorado, for the railroad. It was specifically intended to surpass the nearby Salt Lake City Union Pacific Depot, which had been built the previous year for US$300,000. Schlacks's relationship with D&RG; was fraught with antagonism, mainly over his pay, which led to delay in the depot's construction. One interesting, and ironic, point was that Schlacks's brother was D&RG;'s vice president. The depot was built with elements of Renaissance Revival and Beaux Arts. The high-arched windows at the center were originally installed with green glass to keep the waiting area cool. The depot included a barber shop, a restaurant, a men's smoking room and a women's lounge. There was also a telegraph office and a souvenir/snack bar. The depot opened Salt Lake City to a new influx of immigrants. The depot was also a central point in shipping soldiers off to war in both World War I and World War II. The rise of highway auto travel in the 1950s struck a blow to rail travel and service at the depot dwindled. The depot was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The State of Utah purchased the depot in 1977 for US$1 and the building is currently home to the Utah State Historical Society and its research center, the Utah Department of Heritage & Arts, as well as the Rio Gallery. Amtrak From 1986 to 1999, the depot served as Salt Lake City's Amtrak station, replacing the Union Pacific Depot. It was served by the California Zephyr, Desert Wind, and Pioneer trains, with the latter two having been discontinued in 1997. The California Zephyr runs once daily between Chicago and Emeryville, California. The former Desert Wind ran daily from Chicago to Los Angeles, and the former Pioneer ran daily Chicago to Seattle. By 1999, Amtrak had moved to the Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub, after which the tracks near the depot were permanently removed.

Sts. E. B.) was originally one of the lines of the Royal Saxon State Railways that was built in Vogtland, now in the German state of Saxony and the Czech Republic. The line began from the junction station of Herlasgr√ºn on the Saxon-Bavarian Railway and ran via Falkenstein, Oelsnitz and Bad Elster to Cheb (then a mainly German speaking city called Eger in the Kingdom of Bohemia, which formed part of the Austrian Empire). Only the Herlasgr√ºn‚ÄìFalkenstein and Oelsnitz‚ÄìCheb sections are still operating. History  During the construction of the Saxon-Bavarian Railway, a route running further south in Vogtland through Lengenfeld and Auerbach was discussed. In 1856 proposals were developed for a branch line of the Saxon-Bavarian Railway towards Bohemia. In November 1856, a railway committee of Oelsnitz proposed a railway link through the Elster valley from Gera via Plauen, Adorf, Elster and Asch to Eger. A committee established in Auerbach, however, later proposed the variation as built from Herlasgr√ºn. In the autumn of 1858 the engineering work began on a railway from Plauen, which were interrupted during the Franco-Austrian War of 1859. Only when it was known in Saxony that another project, the Hof‚ÄìEger line was being developed in Bavaria, did interest return to the project. Now, however, the link from Herlasgr√ºn via Auerbach and Falkenstein was favoured. On 21 June 1861, the Saxon parliament approved construction of the Voigtland State Railway via Auerbach. Shortly afterwards, surveying began on the new line. Major problems were experienced on the route through the Bohemian area, where the communities of Flei√üen and Wildstein opposed the construction of the line. The necessary land was so overpriced that the route eventually chosen ran south of the Kapellenberg (mountain) returning to Saxony for a while. Later the town of Eger withdrew its financial commitment for the construction of the line. To minimise the cost it was ultimately decided to build a common route with the Hof‚ÄìEger line in Bohemia. On 1 June 1863, construction began on the line with pre-construction work. On 25 November 1863, the foundation stone was laid for the Eger Viaduct. Finally, in June 1864 about 9,000 workers were employed on the project. For the construction and operation of the section of the railway located in the territory of the Austrian Empire between Voithersreuth (Vojtanov) and Eger and financed by the Royal Saxon Government, a treaty was signed between Austria and Saxony in Vienna on 30 November 1864 (which was ratified four weeks later), providing for a connecting with the Bohemian railway network. The treaty provided for the connection of the Voithersreuth‚ÄìCheb line with the Waldsassen-Eger line built by the Bavarian Eastern Railway Company. On 1 November 1865, the line opened at the same time as the Hof‚ÄìEger line. The cost of the construction of the Voigtland State Railway was later given as a total of 6.1 million Vereinsthalers.Rettig, p 57f Especially in Plauen and Oelsnitz there were demands for more from a direct line from Plauen, as had been agreed in 1856. The Plauen city council on several occasions made petitions to the Saxon government for the construction of this line. On 7 May 1868, the Plauen‚ÄìOelsnitz line was approved by the parliament of Saxony. On 1 November 1874 the line was opened.Rettig, p 59  Notes  References * Category:Railway lines in Saxony Category:Railway lines in the Czech Republic Category:Vogtland ","title":"Voigtland State Railway"},{"id":"33641902","text":"In statistics, an inverted bell curve is a term used loosely or metaphorically to refer to a bimodal distribution that falls to a trough between two peaks, rather than (as in a standard bell curve) rising to a single peak and then falling off on both sides.E.g., see .

The title means seasons, and three of the songs of the album are named after a season. It was released in 2000 by EMI, and was at the top of the Italian album chart for one week. Overview Stagioni (\\"seasons\\") was released on February 4, 2000, four years after Guccini's last studio album, D'amore di morte e di altre sciocchezze. It consists of nine songs, three of which were named after a season: \\"Autunno\\" (autumn), \\"Primavera '59\\" (spring '59) and Inverno '60 (winter '60). \\"Ho ancora la forza\\" was written and sang together with Luciano Ligabue, another singer-songwriter from Emilia-Romagna; it received the 2000 Targa Tenco best song award. The title track was about the death of Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara, a figure Guccini sang about also in his next album, Ritratti. Guccini said the first attempt at writing it was in 1968, but he stopped at half a verse; he was encouraged in finishing the song by the good reception those few lines received at one of his concerts. \\"Addio\\" was a bitter song, attacking the \\"horizon full of dwarfs and dancers\\"; it was seen by some as akin to \\"L'avvelenata\\", one of his most famous songs. In \\"Don Chisciotte\\" Guccini was the voice of Don Quixote, in a duet with Juan Carlos Biondini as Sancho Panza. The song \\"E un giorno...\\" was dedicated to his daughter, the second one after \\"Culodritto\\" (from his 1987 album Signora Bovary). Reception Stagioni received mixed reviews by critics. Mario Luzzatto Fegiz, in his review on the Corriere della Sera, said it was \\"Guccini DOC, with the final and melancholic tones of a testament\\", while an article on La Repubblica said \\"Guccini doesn't surrender, he still has the strength of becoming indignant\\". The website Ondarock.com gave Stagioni a 5.5 mark, saying there was more care in the formal feature but less spontaneity than in Guccini's former albums. The website rockol.it slated the album, saying it was \\"obvious, embarrassing, pathetic, redundant\\". The album was a commercial success, reaching the top spot in the Italian album chart in its release week, and remaining in the chart for 13 weeks.

Massachusetts Avenue ended a short distance after passing Sheridan Circle until a bridge over Rock Creek was completed in 1904. Much of Massachusetts Avenue NW passed through marshy areas that restricted development, and this included the area around Dupont Circle. After the American Civil War, several large mansions were built around Dupont Circle as much of the area was still forested and afforded privacy.Williams, p. 9.

Furthermore, on July 1, 1947, Congress enacted legislation (P.L. 100-637) donating federal land along the north side of E Street NW between 20th and 21st Streets for a new District of Columbia Chapter headquarters. The national organization had already committed $700,000 to build this structure. The Red Cross decided to sell the mansion instead. It opened the house to the public in April 1949 to build public interest in a forthcoming auction of the home's many furnishings.Hogarth, p. 79; Healy, p. 410. The auction raised little interest. The Red Cross put the building and its furnishings up for sale in November 1949 with a $700,000 asking price ($ in dollars). The property lingered on the market until the Washington Club, a private women's club, bought the Patterson Mansion on January 11, 1951.Andrews, Dorothea. \\"Patterson House, Chevy Chase Junior College Sales Revealed.\\" Washington Post. January 12, 1951. The purchase price was not immediately disclosed, but later was discovered to be just $450,000 ($ in dollars). After a title search was completed, the deed transferred on March 1, 1951. Included among the furnishings in the home were several Gobelins, Flemish, and French tapestries and a large amount of period furniture. After some renovations to bring the structure in line with current fire codes, the Washington Club occupied the building on November 8, 1951.\\"Washington Club in 5th 'Debut'.\\" Washington Post. November 4, 1951.\\"Washington Club Opens Home.\\" Washington Post. November 8, 1951. The club rented out the second and third floor bedrooms and their associated suites of rooms to club members. The third reception room, once Felicia Gizycka's bedroom and known as the Countess Room, was renamed the \\"Dorothy Betts Marvin Room\\" in honor of Washington Club president Dorothy Marvin, wife of George Washington University president Cloyd H. Marvin. In 1956, the Washington Club constructed a two-story addition on the east side of the Patterson Mansion. The windows on the first and second floor on the east side were walled up, and three new doors cut on the first floor to provide access to the addition. Two doors were cut on the second floor. A butler's pantry, kitchen prep area, toilet, elevator entrance hall, and banquet hall were built on the ground floor. Stairwells were added on the four corners of the addition. A reception room and small toilet were constructed on the south end of the second of the addition, while a large auditorium occupied the central section. A stage, dressing rooms, and storage area were built on the north end of the second floor. =2013 sale= Patterson Mansion being converted into apartments in 2016. The Washington Club put the Patterson Mansion up for sale in the summer of 2013 with a $26 million asking price. French Quarter Hospitality agreed to purchase the property on October 20, 2013, provided it won approval for renovation and expansion of the property from relevant local government authorities. French Quarter hired Studio 3877 Architects to design a six-story addition to wrap around the rear of the structure. The lower floors of this addition were taller than the upper floors, and it would be attached to the mansion itself.Sernovitz, Daniel J. \\"Micro Apartments Pitched for Patterson Mansion by Dupont Circle.\\" Washington Business Journal. February 11, 2014. Accessed 2014-02-11. Plans by the company called for the Patterson Mansion's first two floors to be turned into a bar, lounges, and a restaurant, and the two upper floors to become hotel rooms. The two-story addition, the company said, would be torn down.Sernovitz, Daniel J. \\"Patterson Mansion by Dupont Circle Eyed for Hotel.\\" Washington Business Journal. October 21, 2013. Accessed 2013-11-11. Historic preservationists applauded the move, which would have preserved the original floor plan and opened up much of the historic mansion to the public. The District of Columbia Historic Preservation Review Board ruled on November 9, 2013, that the original mansion was historic, but declined to give historic protection to the 1956 addition. This removed a major obstacle to the demolition of the 1956 addition.Sernovitz, Daniel J. \\"D.C. Preservation Board Sets Stage for Patterson Mansion Redevelopment.\\" Washington Business Journal. November 11, 2013. Accessed 2013-11-11. The sale to French Quarter fell through in early December 2013 after the Historic Preservation Review Board denied approval for the six-story addition, saying it would destroy the historic character of the mansion. The Dupont Current newspaper reported on December 11 that another buyer had emerged, but no details were provided (although the property was rumored to be turned into an embassy or luxury condominiums). In February 2014, real estate developer SB- Urban agreed to buy the Patterson Mansion if the city approved its plan to subdivide the structure into \\"micro-unit\\" apartments (units or smaller). The building's ballrooms and other spaces would become common areas. SB-Urban said it, too, wanted to tear down the non-historic addition. It proposed a seven- story new addition as well, but its addition would have uniform floors and be distant enough from the mansion that there would a \\"visual separation\\" from it. The Historic Preservation Review Board approved SB-Urban's design for an eight-story addition in late February 2014 after finding that revised designs provided enough visual distinction between the existing building and the to- be-constructed addition. SB-Urban obtained a $31 million investment from CBD LLC, a District-based real estate investment firm, in August 2015. The two companies, which formed a joint venture to renovate the mansion, said they planned 92 mini-apartments for the site, with shared living space, an on-site chef providing meals, meeting space, a private wine cellar, and a fully staffed private bar in the mansion's ballroom.

The first floor exterior wall consists of limestone quoins at the corner and stone coursing. A string course with Greek decorative carving is set between the first and second floors, and acts as the window sill for the second floor windows and as the balustrade for the entrance loggia. The second and third floor exterior walls have stone quoins as well. Between each window on the second floor is a panel inlaid with variegated marble and surrounded by egg-and-dart moldings. The base of the panel is decorated with scrollwork, and the top by a bas-relief urn. Five fruit-shaped clusters decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on this floor (the lowest cluster supported by a tiny putto), while above each window is a false pediment topped by an escutcheon flanked by drapery. Variegated marble panels are set between each window on the third floor as well, the bottom of each decorated with scrollwork and a small dramatic mask. The sill of each third floor window is of scrollwork, while the window is topped by scrollwork and a torch. Circular medallions with pendants decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on the third floor. A bas-relief putto stands atop each medallion and panel, supporting fruit swags. Between the third and fourth (or attic) floors is a molding decorated with repetitive small eggs which serves as the sill for the fourth floor windows. The truncated hipped roof slightly overhangs the walls. The cornice is decorated with dentils and acanthus carvings beneath the roofline. The roof, originally red tile, was changed at some point to asbestos roof shingles with copper flashing. There are seven chimneys on the roof, and about five skylights on the flat section.Jennings, Kohler, and Carson, p. 108. Accessed 2013-11-28. The entrance is reached by three limestone steps. The architrave of the entrance loggia is topped by a fruit-and-swag draped escutcheon. Smooth, variegated marble double-columns, topped by composite capitals, stand above the architrave.The National Register of Historic Places nomination form lists the capitals as Ionic, but a visual inspection clearly shows both scrollwork and acanthus leaves, which indicates a composite order.

The second-floor balcony is framed on either end by pilasters decorated with candelabra. Each wall is angled inward by two bays, with one of the bays behind the balustrade. It is reached via French doors which are framed by slit windows on either side. Pilasters decorated with candelabra are set between the four windows and the doors. A circular escutcheon framed with fruit-and-drapery swags tops each bay and the French doors, while fruit-and-drapery swags link the pilaters over the slit windows.Jennings, Kohler, and Carson, p. 107-108. Accessed 2013-11-28. The third floor balcony is reached through French doors (framed with slit windows) as well. It features a low balustrade of turned granite interrupted by pedestals, which are decorated with variegated marble panels. The placement of the pedestals mimics the pillars and pilasters below. The two bay windows on either side of the balcony feature the same torches, swag, putti, panels, and molding similar to the rest of the third floor. Above the French doors is a large oval estucheon with fruit-and-drapery swag which mimics the estucheon over the doors to the loggia. A standing putto over each slit window supports the swag. All exterior walls are faced with white marble over stone. All windows are double-hung. The first floor windows feature black wrought iron grillwork. The fourth floor windows have no decorative exterior elements. =The interior: First floor= Looking northwest at the second floor library (now a sitting room) of the Patterson Mansion in 1970. The interior is constructed of load-bearing brick walls. The lighting is electric, and the heating system is gravity-rise.Unlike a forced-air system, in a gravity-rise heating system there is no fan is pushing the air. The system relies on hot air rising of its own accord to push heat to the upper floors. The northwest wing was angled to align with Dupont Circle, while the rest of the house (south wing, center, northeast wing) was on a north‚Äìsouth axis perpendicular to P Street NW. The vestibule behind the loggia was on a northeast‚Äìsouthwest axis, and flanked on both sides by toilets‚Äîone of which was accessible by the billiard room to the northwest and the other by the reception hall to the southeast. The entrance hall was floored with polished terrazzo bordered by white marble. The ceiling was white plaster, and the walls were white plaster with a high wooden baseboard. The billiard room was access by a door in the west wall, and in the north-northwest corner was a door leading to a cloakroom. To the right of the cloakroom door is a fireplace framed by exquisite moldings and a mantelpiece in the 15th-century Italian style. In the south wall, a door gave entry to the reception hall. Two marble steps led to a small landing and then the main staircase in the east wall (northeast corner). Adjacent to the main staircase to the right (south) was the elevator, and then a small door and corridor giving onto the servants' section in the rear of the mansion's first floor. Northwest of the billiard room was an automobile garage, with the garage door giving onto Dupont Circle. Northeast of the garage, and connected to the garage and the cloakroom, was a bicycle storage room. In the rear of the ground floor was the servants' area. Clockwise from the north, this consisted of the laundry and storage closets, servants' entrance, kitchen, pantry, serving room, butler's room, and servants' hall. A set of winder stairs behind the elevator serves as the servants' stairs.Jennings, Kohler, and Carson, p. 109. Accessed 2013-11-28.

Accessed 2013-11-28. The billiard was similar to the reception hall, although it featured a dado rail off the floor. Its walls were wood paneling (into which built-in bookcases were added after 1951). It featured a chimney in the south wall. This fireplace was much plainer than those in the rest of the house, and its mantel consisted of a sand-cast concrete mantel in the Georgian style.Jennings, Kohler, and Carson, p. 110. Accessed 2013-11-28. The mainstaircase was flanked by smooth, variegated marble columns in antis. Ten marble steps lead up to a landing. In the east wall of the intermediate landing is a fountain. The stairs diverge at the intermediate landing, with nine more steps on the north and south leading to the second floor landing. The stringer, risers, and treads are all made of marble. The banister is of cast iron in a rinceau and cartouche pattern, with a handrail encased in red velvet. The staircase fountain is made of white marble with grey and tan veins. The semi-circular bowl is supported by an eagle with outspread wings. Water pours from the mouth of a faun, above which is perched a swan in bas-relief. Decorated pilasters on either side of the fountain support a plain frieze, above which is an inset fan capped by an acroterion.Jennings, Kohler, and Carson, p. 110-111.

A fireplace with marble hearth and mantel, surrounded by exquisite marble and plaster moldings, was in the northwest wall.Jennings, Kohler, and Carson, p. 112. Accessed 2013-11-28. In the foyer, to the right of the door leading to the library, was a set of plain marble stairs with an intermediate landing and single turn which lead to the third floor. Behind the steps was a conservatory with a bay window facing northwest. From the intermediate landing, a door in the northeast wall gave out onto an orchestra balcony overlooking the ballroom.Jennings, Kohler, and Carson, p. 113. Accessed 2013-11-28. The base of the balcony is decorated with corbels, plaster drapery, and guttae. The ballroom occupied the entire north wing. It was accessed via the foyer through glass doors. The ballroom ceiling was plaster. Its flooring was oak parquetry in a herringbone pattern with plaster walls, a wooden baseboard, and a dado rail at . Flanking the doors, chimney, and windows and in the corners of the room were marble pilasters on wooden pedestals. Accessed 2013-11-28. The west wall was bowed westward, to accommodate the orchestra balcony as it projected into the room. The room was lit by 10 brass wall sconces with three upward curving torch-arms. Hanging from the ceiling were three, 12-light crystal chandeliers with three hidden tiers. The fireplace in the east wall featured a cast iron firebox, framed by marble pilasters. It had a marble mantel, and a mirror overmantel in an 18th- century English style.Jennings, Kohler, and Carson, p. 112-113. Accessed 2013-11-28. Behind the main stairs was a shaft, allowing the skylight to shine down to the first floor, and another butler's pantry. A dining room occupied the south part of the second floor. Its flooring consisted of square flame maple wood parquetry, with a wooden baseboard, and a dado rail at . Its walls and ceiling were plaster, with a decorative molding around the ceiling. The doors were similar to those of the library, and in the east wall was a fireplace with iron firebox and marble mantel in the Georgian style. The room was lit by six mirror-backed cystal wall sconces with three crystal torch- arms. A single 12-light crystal chandelier with two hidden light tiers and an elaborate brass canopy hung from the ceiling.Jennings, Kohler, and Carson, p. 111-112. Accessed 2013-11-28. =The interior: Third and fourth floors= Bedroom suites occupied the second and third floors. Each suite consisted of a bedroom, dressing room, and bathroom. There were three suites on the third floor, and one on the fourth floor. =Changes to the original building= The building has undergone modest internal changes since its construction. Almost all previous owners have made changes. In 1927, the Washington Post reported that the house had 30 rooms and 10 bathrooms. This does not appear to have changed by the time of Cissy Patterson's death, as there were still 40 rooms in 1948. Although the northeast room on the first floor was originally a billiard room, by 1927 Cissy Patterson had changed it into a small library. Cissy Patterson's changes also include extending the wine cellar outward beneath the driveway by a distance of in 1917. In March 1935, she hired the Otis Elevator Company to install an elevator and had the electrical power switched to AC from DC. The Washington Club also made many changes to the house. Renovations included adding new doors, removing old doors to create portals, and new wiring, plumbing, plastering, and carpeting. In order to allow club members to use the upper bedrooms as private apartments, the staircase from the second floor foyer to the third floor was partitioned off. An exterior concrete stair leading from the former conservatory to the ground floor (for use as a fire escape) was also added. The garage was partitioned, an elevator added just inside the garage doors, and toilets added against the shared wall with the first floor billiard room (which now became the library). The first floor servants' hall was partitioned as well to create an office and corridor. The second floor library was turned into a drawing room and its plaster walls covered over with walnut paneling. Felicia Grizycka's bedroom suite on third floor was turned into reception/board room. Most significantly, the Washington Club closed off all the east wall windows on first and second floors. A two-story addition was constructed on the east side in 1956. New doors were cut through the walls on the first floor from the servants' hall and kitchen, and the east wall of the pantry removed to provide access to the addition. On the second floor, new doors were cut from the butler's pantry and south of the fireplace in the ballroom. Another door was cut in the north wall near the northeastern corner to provide access to a new exterior concrete fire escape stairs. A dining room and foyer were constructed on the first floor of the addition, and a meeting room and reception room on second floor. The Washington Club did not, however, alter the main marble staircase, its wrought iron balustrade with red velvet banister, or the fountain on intermediate landing between the first and second floors. The Patterson Mansion was renovated again in 1985. The renovation was overseen by Oerhlein & Associates Architects.Moeller and Feldblyum, p. 209.

Background In late July 1968 in developing their plans for the Phase III Offensive, the North Vietnamese politburo and People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) chief of staff, General VƒÉn Ti·∫øn D≈©ng decided that while the main area of operations would be T√¢y Ninh Province, the Central Highlands would be a secondary area of operations. The PAVN 1st Division was tasked with seizing the Duc Lap Camp and then moving northeast to threaten Bu√¥n Ma Thu·ªôt. The PAVN 24th Regiment would cut Highway 14 between Bu√¥n Ma Thu·ªôt and Pleiku. The 95C and 101D Regiments would make diversionary attacks on Allied bases across Kon Tum Province. Battle On the night of 23 August the 66th Regiment and the 20th Sapper Battalion gathered near Duc Lap Camp in preparation for their attack on the base while the 320th Regiment established a blocking position on Highway 14 northeast of Duc Lap to intercept allied ground units. After midnight on 24 August 2 squads from the 20th Sapper Battalion cut through the perimeter wire around the Duc Lap subsector headquarters, entered the compound and threw satchel charges at buildings and fighting positions while infantry provided covering fire. One of the satchel charges hit the advisory team headquarters, wounding 5 U.S. advisers inside. When the advisers emerged from the headquarters they were hit by heavy weapons fire which killed 1 adviser and forced the rest back into the building, they then radioed Duc Lap camp for assistance but were informed that it was also under attack. At Duc Lap Camp the PAVN had penetrated the northern perimeter wire and occupied part of a hill inside the camp. An AC-47 Spooky gunship soon arrived overhead and began firing on PAVN mortar and machine-gun positions. After a meeting at ARVN 23rd Division headquarters in Bu√¥n Ma Thu·ªôt, I Field Force, Vietnam commander General William R. Peers ordered the 4th Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment to be airlifted from Tuy H√≤a Base Camp to Bu√¥n Ma Thu·ªôt to join a newly created Task Force Spoiler to be commanded by Col. Herbert J. McChrystal. Task Force Spoiler would include McChrystal's 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, the 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, two troops from the 7th Squadron, 17th Cavalry and seven artillery batteries. 23rd Division commander, General An, ordered a battalion from the 47th Infantry Regiment to redeploy from Ph√∫ Y√™n Province to Bu√¥n Ma Thu·ªôt and 2 battalions from the 45th Regiment to proceed towards Duc Lap and also received permission from the II Corps commander to fly several MIKE Force companies into Duc Lap. On the morning of 24 August U.S. helicopters landed a MIKE Force company outside the Duc Lap camp and they proceeded to engage the PAVN forces on the north end of the camp suffering heavy losses. When helicopters landed on the camp airfield to evacuate casualties, PAVN machine guns on the hill shot down 4 UH-1s. Later that afternoon the ARVN 2nd Battalion, 45th Regiment was landed near the Duc Lap subsector headquarters with 2 UH-1s shot down. At dusk 2 MIKE Force companies were landed 3km south of Duc Lap Camp. On 25 August the PAVN renewed their attack against the subsector headquarters, but the remaining 61 troops defenders held out until rescued later that day by the ARVN 2nd Battalion, 45th Regiment which then forced the PAVN to retreat from the village. Meanwhile at Duc Lap Camp the PAVN had forced the defenders back into the southern end of the camp. Battery A, 4th Battalion, 42nd Artillery Regiment was airlifted into the landing zone 3km south of the camp and the 2 MIKE Force companies there then moved north and fought their way into Duc Lap Camp by 13:00. The MIKE Forces hit the PAVN flank as they were assaulting the southern end of the camp pushing them back to the northern hill. Following air and artillery strikes the original 2 companies plus a third which had been flown in from Pleiku then assaulted the hill. Three U.S. advisers and a number of the CIDG troops were killed in the assault, but by 19:00 they had cleared the PAVN from the camp. On 26 August the ARVN 2nd Battalion, 45th Regiment, continued to pursue the PAVN north in the hills north of the town and by 27 August the battle was over. Aftermath Allied casualties for the battle of Duc Lap were 114 killed (including 7 U.S. advisers) and 238 wounded. I Field Force estimated that over 700 PAVN had been killed, most from air and artillery strikes.

The issue referred to Keynes's statement in the Treatise that an entrepreneur who spent his profits on consumption goods would increase profits for another entrepreneur by the same amount and that these profits would percolate through the economy endlessly like the oil from the widow's cruse in I Kings 17:16. (The reverse case, where entrepreneurs save, is analogous to the Danaid's jar that never fills). The Circus challenged Keynes's implicit assumption that there was a fixed supply of consumption goods.Kahn, 107. The influence of the group on the General Theory has been debated. Joseph Schumpeter stated that Kahn's contribution was almost that of a co-author, but Kahn himself denied this.\\"Cambridge Circus.\\" On the other hand, Don Patinkin argued that most of Keynes's major breakthroughs came after the group disbanded in Spring 1931.\\"Cambridge Circus.\\" The group kept no records but several first hand accounts of the group's meetings have been published.

ITS was established to foster research, education, and training in the field of transportation. UC Irvine ITS is located on the fourth floor of the Anteater Instruction and Research Building at University of California, Irvine's main Campus, and also houses the UC Irvine Transportation Science graduate studies program. 4000 Anteater Instruction and Research Building thumb A fundamental goal of the Institute is the stimulation of interdisciplinary research on contemporary transportation issues. ITS research involves faculty and students from The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, the School of Social Sciences, the School of Social Ecology, the Paul Merage School of Business, the School of Law, and the Bren School of Information and Computer Science. The Institute also hosts visiting scholars from the U.S. and abroad to facilitate cooperative research and information exchange, and sponsors conferences and colloquia to disseminate research results. ITS is also part of the University of California Transportation Center (UCTC), one of ten federally designated centers for transportation research and education, and a member of the Council of University Transportation Centers (CUTC). Research at ITS covers a broad spectrum of transportation issues. Current funded research projects at Irvine focus upon: * Intelligent transportation systems, particularly advanced transportation management systems * Analysis and simulation of urban traffic networks * Transportation system operations and control * Artificial intelligence/expert systems in transportation * Travel demand forecasting and analysis of complex travel behavior * Transportation/land use interactions, particularly those which encourage alternative modes of travel * Planning and evaluation of advanced public transit systems * Transportation pricing and regulation * Energy and environmental issues, particularly demand for alternative fuels * Effect of land-use on transportation demand * Growth of automobile use in the U.S. and Western Europe Research on advanced transportation technologies, a focus at Irvine, is supported by a wide range of programs. These include: * Advanced Testbed Research Program, a state and federally supported effort headquartered at UCI. This program is developing and evaluating new technologies for traffic system monitoring and control. * Program for Improved Vehicle Demand Forecasting Models. Sponsored by the California Energy Commission, this program is investigating the state's potential market for clean fuel vehicles. * Partnership for Advanced Transit and Highways (PATH), a state-sponsored research program on intelligent transportation systems. Headquartered at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB), with participation from UCI, this program has an annual solicitation for research ideas in Intelligent Transportation Systems. * PATH Advanced Transportation Management Systems (ATMS) Center. Headquartered at UCI, this PATH center focuses on the research and development of ATMS technologies. * The ITS Advanced Transportation Management System (ATMS) Laboratories at Irvine provide facilities for teaching, research, and development of high-technology applications in transportation. The laboratories include workstations tied directly to a modern traffic management center and to the local California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) district's freeway traffic management center. The laboratories also contain a network of Unix-based workstations and personal computers, and a variety of software in transportation engineering and control. * A statewide video teleconferencing facility, video camera, recorders, monitors and accessories enable research in advanced traffic detection, monitoring and analysis. Additional features of the ATMS Laboratories include advanced traffic signal controllers and a variety of traffic data collection devices. These laboratories form the backbone of California's research initiative in ATMS and, together with the California ATMS Testbed established in Orange County as part of that initiative, provide unparalleled opportunity for the development and testing of applications of advanced technology in the management of transportation systems. The transportation research program at Irvine is also supported by computerized access to the ITS Transportation Library at UC Berkeley. In addition to the resources available from the ITS Berkeley Library, ITS at UCI subscribes to the major transportation research journals and offers a variety of computer- based information retrieval services. ITS is linked to the broader professional community through a series of research colloquia and specialty conferences. The latter programs attract an international audience. The Institute also houses the UC Irvine Transportation Science graduate program. The Institute maintains a regular publication series which documents research conducted within its programs. The Institute maintains the Frank Haight Memorial Library located in the Anteater Instructional Research Building on campus, named after Emeritus Professor Frank Haight, who founded three of the most influential journals in transportation research: Transportation Research Part A and B, and Accident Analysis and Prevention.http://www.julianhaight.com/fah/Frank_Haight.pdf  Timeline of Significant Research  The significance of research from an institution can be quantified using the h-index. The h-index value from Web of Science for UCI in transportation related journals as of July 2011 was 31, which means 31 publications had at least 31 citations or more. UCI ITS ranks 7th globally in transportation research, and 5th nationally, as of 2011.http://uctc.net/about/UCTCworkplan%202012-2013.pdf A select number of those publications are listed here in a timeline format. 1979 ‚Äì Charles Lave developed the first disaggregate automobile choice model, using multinomial logit 1985 ‚Äì Gordon Fielding, Timlynn Babistky, and Mary Brenner identified a set of performance measures to assess bus transit performance 1986 ‚Äì Will Recker and Michael McNally proposed the theoretical background for the first operational activity-based model, STARCHILD 1986 ‚Äì Will Recker and Michael McNally presented part II of their STARCHILD model 1987 ‚Äì Thomas Golob, Will Recker, and John Leonard studied truck-related accidents using log-linear models and found that durations of accidents were log-normally distributed 1992 ‚Äì Kenneth Small proposed a revenue distribution model to make congestion pricing practical and politically viable 1992 ‚Äì Genevieve Giuliano reviewed congestion pricing policies and suggested politically acceptable alternatives 1994 ‚Äì Charles Lave and Patrick Elias examined the 65 mph speed limit systematically at the statewide level and showed that the change from 55 mph reduced fatality rates 1995 ‚Äì Kelvin Cheu and Stephen Ritchie developed an incident detection algorithm based on inductive loop data and an artificial neural network method 1995 ‚Äì Kenneth Small measured the costs of air pollution in Los Angeles from motor vehicles 1995 ‚Äì Jayakrishnan, Wei Tsai, and Anthony Chen developed a dynamic traffic assignment model with network loading that made use of DYNASMART, the first mesoscopic traffic simulation model 1996 ‚Äì Michael Zhang, Stephen Ritchie, and Will Recker formulated the ramp metering control as a dynamic optimal control problem and presented solution methods and validation 1997 ‚Äì Thomas Golob and Michael McNally used a structural model to explain interactions between household members 1998 ‚Äì Randall Crane empirically tested the hypothesis that urban design can influence travel, showing that no such evidence could be found from local household travel survey and GIS data 1999 ‚Äì Carlos Sun, Stephen Ritchie, Kevin Tsai, and Jayakrishnan formulated the vehicle reidentification problem as a lexicographic optimization problem and demonstrated robust performance 2000 ‚Äì David Brownstone explored the advantages of merging stated preference and revealed preference data in an empirical study to evaluate alternative fuel vehicle market penetration 2000 ‚Äì Thomas Golob developed a model that jointly generates activity participation, travel time, and trip generation 2000 - Anthony Chen formulated the traffic equilibrium problem as an unconstrained optimization problem that is equivalent to the nonlinear complementarity problem. 2001 ‚Äì Kenneth Small measured values of time and reliability from 1998 data where commuters chose between a free and a variably tolled route 2001 ‚Äì Marlon Boarnet further showed that the influence of land use on travel behavior is high sensitive to the choice of behavioral and statistical assumptions 2001 ‚Äì Thomas Golob and Amelia Regan explored ways of applying information technology to personal travel and freight research 2003 ‚Äì Thomas Golob conducted a review of the literature on structural equation modelling for travel behavior research 2004 - Kenneth Small argued that second-best toll pricing requires explicit consideration of user heterogeneity. 2005 ‚Äì By merging RP and SP data, David Brownstone and Kenneth Small showed that value of time under revealed conditions are more than two times higher than from stated preferences, suggesting a perception bias in value of time  References  Category:Technological universities in the United States Category:University of California, Irvine Category:Transportation planning ","title":"UC Irvine Institute of Transportation Studies"},{"id":"33642248","text":"Deool (English: The Temple) is a 2011 Indian Marathi dark comedy directed by Umesh Vinayak Kulkarni and produced by Abhijeet Gholap.

For God‚Äôs sake, don‚Äôt miss it.\\" The movie won maximum number of awards (3) at 59th National Film Awards in 2011. ;National Film Awards * 2011: National Film Award for Best Feature Film ::Citation: For its witty, satirical and penetrative account of the politics involved in the commercialization of religion in India. Through a wonderfully authentic depiction of village life, mentality and gesture, Deool has a social, religious and commercial sweep, even as it individualizes each of its characters and endows them with a language and space of their own. The film ironically shows the wholehearted acceptance of commodified and clamorous religiosity in a land plagued by all the serious problems the country faces today, and it does so with laughter that is only slightly tinged with cynicism. * 2011: National Film Award for Best Actor - Girish Kulkarni ::Citation: For his role as Kesha, the good hearted village simpleton, who inadvertently sets tumultuous events in motion, is circumspect and tenderhearted. Shorn of histrionics, his performance depends largely on his face and eyes to convey the multitudinous emotions in his mind which he cannot utter. He is controlled yet ingenuous, moving towards the beginnings of an understanding of the world around him, a move that transforms itself unselfconsciously into a spiritual quest. * 2011: National Film Award for Best Screenplay (Best Dialogue) - Girish Kulkarni ::Citation: For its immensely varied and textured use of language that is both an authentic and an energetic reflection of the different sections of life shown in the film: the language of the village, of politicians, of the scholar and much else. His dialogues - robustly rustic yet influenced by urban vocabulary - is characteristic of the Indian scene today.

Biography Nasir al-Din Tusi was born in the city of Tus in medieval Khorasan (northeastern Iran) in the year 1201 and began his studies at an early age. In Hamadan and Tus he studied the Quran, hadith, Ja'fari jurisprudence, logic, philosophy, mathematics, medicine and astronomy.Dabashi, Hamid. \\"Khwajah Nasir al-Din Tusi: The philosopher/vizier and the intellectual climate of his times\\".

London: Routledge. 1996. p. 529 He was apparently born into a Shƒ´‚Äòah family and lost his father at a young age. Fulfilling the wish of his father, the young Muhammad took learning and scholarship very seriously and traveled far and wide to attend the lectures of renowned scholars and acquire the knowledge, an exercise highly encouraged in his Islamic faith. At a young age, he moved to Nishapur to study philosophy under Farid al-Din Damad and mathematics under Muhammad Hasib.Siddiqi, Bakhtyar Husain. \\"Nasir al-Din Tusi\\". A History of Islamic Philosophy. Vol 1. M. M. Sharif (ed.). Wiesbaden:: Otto Harrossowitz. 1963. p. 565 He met also Attar of Nishapur, the legendary Sufi master who was later killed by the Mongols, and he attended the lectures of Qutb al-Din al-Misri. In Mosul he studied mathematics and astronomy with Kamal al-Din Yunus (d. AH 639 / AD 1242), a pupil of Sharaf al-Dƒ´n al- ·π¨≈´sƒ´.Sharaf al-Din al-Muzaffar al-Tusi biography - MacTutor History of Mathematics Later on he corresponded with Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi, the son-in- law of Ibn Arabi, and it seems that mysticism, as propagated by Sufi masters of his time, was not appealing to his mind and once the occasion was suitable, he composed his own manual of philosophical Sufism in the form of a small booklet entitled Awsaf al-Ashraf \\"The Attributes of the Illustrious\\". As the armies of Genghis Khan swept his homeland, he was employed by the Nizari Ismaili state and made his most important contributions in science during this time when he was moving from one stronghold to another,Peter Willey, The Eagle's Nest: Ismaili Castles in Iran and Syria, (I.B. Tauris, 2005), 172. first in those of the Quhistan region under Muhtasham Nasir al-Din Abd al- Rahim ibn Abi Mansur (where he wrote the Nasirean Ethics). He was later sent to the major castles of Alamut and Maymun-Diz to continue his career under Nizari Imam Ala al-Din Muhammad. He was captured after the fall of Maymun-Diz to the Mongol forces under Hulagu Khan.Michael Axworthy, A History of Iran: Empire of the Mind, (Basic Books, 2008), 104.

Tusi convinced Hulegu Khan to construct an observatory for establishing accurate astronomical tables for better astrological predictions. Beginning in 1259, the Rasad Khaneh observatory was constructed in Azarbaijan, south of the river Aras, and to the west of Maragheh, the capital of the Ilkhanate Empire. Based on the observations in this for the time being most advanced observatory, Tusi made very accurate tables of planetary movements as depicted in his book Zij-i ilkhani (Ilkhanic Tables). This book contains astronomical tables for calculating the positions of the planets and the names of the stars. His model for the planetary system is believed to be the most advanced of his time, and was used extensively until the development of the heliocentric model in the time of Nicolaus Copernicus. Between Ptolemy and Copernicus, he is considered by many to be one of the most eminent astronomers of his time. His famous student Shams ad-Din Al-Bukhari was the teacher of Byzantine scholar Gregory Choniades, who had in turn trained astronomer Manuel Bryennios about 1300 in Constantinople. For his planetary models, he invented a geometrical technique called a Tusi- couple, which generates linear motion from the sum of two circular motions. He used this technique to replace Ptolemy's problematic equantCraig G. Fraser, 'The cosmos: a historical perspective', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006 p.39 for many planets, but was unable to find a solution to Mercury, which was solved later by Ibn al-Shatir as well as Ali Qushji.George Saliba, 'Al- Qushji's Reform of the Ptolemaic Model for Mercury', Arabic Sciences and Philosophy, v.3 1993, pp.161-203 The Tusi couple was later employed in Ibn al- Shatir's geocentric model and Nicolaus Copernicus' heliocentric Copernican model.George Saliba, 'Revisiting the Astronomical Contacts Between the World of Islam and Renaissance Europe: The Byzantine Connection', 'The occult sciences in Byzantium', 2006, p.368 He also calculated the value for the annual precession of the equinoxes and contributed to the construction and usage of some astronomical instruments including the astrolabe. ·π¨≈´sƒ´ criticized Ptolemy's use of observational evidence to show that the Earth was at rest, noting that such proofs were not decisive.

Tusi's criticisms of Ptolemy were similar to the arguments later used by Copernicus in 1543 to defend the Earth's rotation.F.

Sources in the History of Mathematics and Physical Sciences. New York: Springer-Verlag, 1993. pp. 129 Three centuries later the proof of the Milky Way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study the Milky Way and discovered that it is really composed of a huge number of faint stars. =Logic= Nasir al-Din Tusi was a supporter of Avicennian logic, and wrote the following commentary on Avicenna's theory of absolute propositions: =Mathematics= A stamp issued in the republic of Azerbaijan in 2009 honoring Tusi Al-Tusi was the first to write a work on trigonometry independently of astronomy. Al-Tusi, in his Treatise on the Quadrilateral, gave an extensive exposition of spherical trigonometry, distinct from astronomy.* Katz, Victor J. (1993). A History of Mathematics: An Introduction, p259. Addison Wesley. . It was in the works of Al-Tusi that trigonometry achieved the status of an independent branch of pure mathematics distinct from astronomy, to which it had been linked for so long. He was the first to list the six distinct cases of a right triangle in spherical trigonometry.http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Al- Tusi_Nasir.html,\\"One of al-Tusi's most important mathematical contributions was the creation of trigonometry as a mathematical discipline in its own right rather than as just a tool for astronomical applications. In Treatise on the quadrilateral al-Tusi gave the first extant exposition of the whole system of plane and spherical trigonometry. This work is really the first in history on trigonometry as an independent branch of pure mathematics and the first in which all six cases for a right-angled spherical triangle are set forth\\"/ This followed earlier work by Greek mathematicians such as Menelaus of Alexandria, who wrote a book on spherical trigonometry called Sphaerica, and the earlier Muslim mathematicians Ab≈´ al-WafƒÅ' al-B≈´zjƒÅnƒ´ and Al-Jayyani. In his On the Sector Figure, appears the famous law of sines for plane triangles. : \\\\frac{a}{\\\\sin A} = \\\\frac{b}{\\\\sin B} = \\\\frac{c}{\\\\sin C} He also stated the law of sines for spherical triangles,Also the 'sine law' (of geometry and trigonometry, applicable to spherical trigonometry) is attributed, among others, to Alkhujandi. (The three others are Abul Wafa Bozjani, Nasiruddin Tusi, and Abu Nasr Mansur). Razvi, Syed Abbas Hasan (1991) A history of science, technology, and culture in Central Asia, Volume 1 University of Peshawar, Peshawar, Pakistan, page 358, Bijli suggests that three mathematicians are in contention for the honor, Alkhujandi, Abdul-Wafa and Mansur, leaving out Nasiruddin Tusi. Bijli, Shah Muhammad and Delli, Idarah-i AdabiyƒÅt-i (2004) Early Muslims and their contribution to science: ninth to fourteenth century Idarah-i Adabiyat-i Delli, Delhi, India, page 44, discovered the law of tangents for spherical triangles, and provided proofs for these laws. =Biology= In his Akhlaq-i Nasiri, Tusi wrote about several biological topics. He defended a version of Aristotle's scala naturae, in which he placed man above animals, plants, minerals, and the elements. He described \\"grasses which grow without sowing or cultivation, by the mere mingling of elements,\\"Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) The Nasirean Ethics (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p. 44. as closest to minerals. Among plants, he considered the date-palm as the most highly developed, since \\"it only lacks one thing further to reach (the stage of) an animal: to tear itself loose from the soil and to move away in the quest for nourishment.\\" The lowest animals \\"are adjacent to the region of plants: such are those animals which propagate like grass, being incapable of mating [...], e.g. earthworms, and certain insects\\".Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) The Nasirean Ethics (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p. 45. The animals \\"which reach the stage of perfection [...] are distinguished by fully developed weapons\\", such as antlers, horns, teeth, and claws. Tusi described these organs as adaptations to each species's lifestyle, in a way anticipating natural theology. He continued: Thus, in this paragraph, Tusi described different types of learning, recognising observational learning as the most advanced form, and correctly attributing it to certain animals. Tusi seems to have perceived man as belonging to the animals, since he stated that \\"the Animal Soul [comprising the faculties of perception and movement ...] is restricted to individuals of the animal species\\", and that, by possessing a \\"Human Soul, [...] mankind is distinguished and particularized among other animals.\\"Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) The Nasirean Ethics (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p. 42 (emphasis added). Some scholars have interpreted Tusi's biological writings as suggesting that he adhered to some kind of evolutionary theory. However, Tusi did not state explicitly that he believed species to change over time. =Chemistry= Tusi contributed to the field of chemistry, stating an early law of conservation of mass. Influence and legacy A statue of Khaje Nasir in Mashhad A 60-km diameter lunar crater located on the southern hemisphere of the moon is named after him as \\"Nasireddin\\". A minor planet 10269 Tusi discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1979 is named after him. The K. N. Toosi University of Technology in Iran and Observatory of Shamakhy in the Republic of Azerbaijan are also named after him. In February 2013, Google celebrated his 812th birthday with a doodle, which was accessible in its websites with Arabic language calling him al-farsi (the Persian). His birthday is also celebrated as Engineer's Day in Iran.

It is played with a keyboard or by moving a ring along a wire, creating \\"wavering\\" sounds similar to a theremin. A player of the ondes martenot is called an ondist. The ondes Martenot was invented in 1928 by the French inventor Maurice Martenot. Martenot was inspired by the accidental overlaps of tones between military radio oscillators, and wanted to create an instrument with the expressiveness of the cello. The instrument is used in more than 100 classical compositions. The French composer Olivier Messiaen used it in pieces such as his 1949 symphony Turangal√Æla-Symphonie, and his sister-in-law Jeanne Loriod was a celebrated player of the instrument. It appears in numerous film and television soundtracks, particularly science fiction and horror films. Jonny Greenwood of the English rock band Radiohead is credited with bringing the ondes to a larger modern audience. It has also been used by pop acts such as Daft Punk, Gaudi and Damon Albarn.  History  The ondes Martenot (French for \\"Martenot waves\\") is one of the earliest electronic instruments, patented in the same year as another early electronic instrument, the theremin. It was invented in 1928 by French cellist Maurice Martenot. Martenot had been a radio operator during World War I, and developed the ondes Martenot in an attempt to replicate the accidental overlaps of tones between military radio oscillators. He hoped to bring musical expressivity associated with the cello to his new instrument.Jean Laurendeau: Maurice Martenot: Luthier de l'Electronique (Dervy Livres, 1996) He first demonstrated the ondes Martenot on April 20, 1928, performing Dimitrios Levidis‚Äôs Po√®me symphonique at the Paris Opera. Units were manufactured individually to order. Over the following years, Martenot produced several new models, introducing the ability to produce vibrato by moving the keys, a feature adapted in the 1970s by some Yamaha GX-1 synthesisers. According to The Guardian, the ondes Martenot visually resembles a cross between an organ and a theremin. Jean-Louis Martenot, Maurice Martenot's son, created new ondes Martenot models. In 2000, Jonny Greenwood of the English rock band Radiohead commissioned the synthesiser company Analogue Systems to develop a replica of the ondes Martenot, as he was nervous about damaging his instrument on tour. The replica, called the French Connection, imitates the ondes Martenot's control mechanism, but does not generate sound; instead, it may be used to control an external oscillator. Sounds and technique Au ruban playing techniqueThe ondes Martenot is unique among electronic musical instruments in its methods of control. The ondes Martenot can be played with a metal ring worn on the right index finger. Sliding the ring along a wire produces \\"theremin-like\\" tones, generated by oscillations in vacuum tubes, or transistors in the seventh model. The third model of the instrument, unveiled in 1929, had a non-functioning simulacrum of a keyboard below the wire to indicate pitch. This model also had a \\"black fingerguard\\" on a wire which could be used instead of the ring. It was held between the right thumb and index finger, which was played standing at a distance from the instrument. When played in this way, the drawer is removed from the instrument and placed on a bench next to the player. Maurice Martenot's pedagogical manual for the ondes Martenot, written in 1931, offers instruction on both methods of playing. Later versions added a real functioning keyboard; the keys produce vibrato when moved from side to side. This was introduced in the 1930s with the 84-key fourth version of the instrument. Subsequent versions had 72 keys. Combined with a switch that transposes the pitch by one octave, these instruments have a range from C1 to C8. A drawer allows manipulation of volume and timbre by the left hand. Volume is controlled with a touch-sensitive glass \\"lozenge\\", called the \\"gradation key\\"; the further the lozenge is depressed, the louder the volume. In his preface to Jeanne Loriod's Technique de l'Onde Electronique Type Martenot., Olivier Messiaen explains that the \\"gradation key, struck by one or several fingers of the left hand, gives at the same time the sound, its intensity, and the attack itself. The intensity ranges from an almost inaudible pianissimo to the most terrible and painful fortissimo, passing through all intermediate gradations. The conceivable attacks are more numerous than those of the piano, violin, flute, horn or organ ‚Äì they range from an absolute legato and glissando to the sounds of temple blocks and membranophones. Somewhere beyond the absolute legato exists an extraterrestrial, enchanted voice, and beneath the dry staccato attack may be found sound effects such as cracked bell, a crumbling pile of sand, or an aircraft motor.\\" Early models could produce only a few waveforms. Later models can simultaneously generate sine, peak-limited triangle, square, pulse, and full-wave rectified sine waves, in addition to pink noise, all controlled by switches in the drawer. The square wave and full-wave rectified sine wave can be further adjusted by sliders in the drawer. On the Seventh model, a dial at the top of the drawer adjusts the balance between white noise and the other waveforms. A second dial adjusts the balance between the three speakers. A switch chooses between the keyboard and ribbon. Further adjustments can be made using controls in the body of the instrument. These include several dials for tuning the pitch, a dial for adjusting the overall volume, a switch to transpose the pitch by one octave, and a switch to activate a filter. alt=The drawer of the Seventh model also includes six transposition buttons, which change the pitch by a specific interval. These are called -1/4 (lower by one quarter tone), +1/4 (raise by one quarter tone), +1/2 (raise by one semitone), +1 (raise by one whole tone), +3ce (raise by one major third), and +5te (raise by one major fifth. These can be combined to immediately raise the pitch by up to a minor ninth. Martenot produced four speakers, called diffuseurs, for the instrument. The M√©tallique features a gong instead of a speaker cone, producing a metallic timbre. It was used by the first ondes Martenot quartets in 1932. Another, the Palme speaker, has a resonance chamber laced with strings tuned to all 12 semitones of an octave; when a note is played in tune, it resonates a particular string, producing chiming tones. It was first presented alongside the sixth version of the ondes Martenot in 1950. According to the Guardian, the ondes Martenot \\"can be as soothing and moving as a string quartet, but nerve-jangling when gleefully abused\\". Greenwood described it as \\"a very accurate theremin that you have far more control of ... When it's played well, you can really emulate the voice.\\" The New York Times described its sound as a \\"haunting wail\\".  Use  =Classical music= The ondes Martenot is used in more than 100 classical compositions, most notably by the French composer Olivier Messiaen. Messiaen first used it in F√™te des Belles Eaux, for six ondes, and went on to use it in several more works, including Trois Petites Liturgies de la Pr√©sence Divine and Saint-Fran√ßois d'Assise. For his Turangal√Æla-Symphonie, Messiaen used to create \\"shimmering, swooping musical effects\\". Messiaen's widow, Yvonne Loriod-Messiaen, arranged and edited four unpublished Feuillets inedits for ondes Martenot and piano which were published in 2001.Bloch, p. 7. Other composers who used the instrument include Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud, Edgard Var√®se, Charles Koechlin, Florent Schmitt and Jacques Ibert. According to the New York Times, the ondes' most celebrated performer was the French musician Jeanne Loriod (1928‚Äì2001), who studied under Martenot at the Paris Conservatory. She performed internationally in more than 500 works, created 85 works for a sextet of ondes she formed in 1974, and wrote a three-volume book on the instrument, Technique de l'Onde Electronique Type Martenot. The English composer Hugh Davies estimated that more than 1,000 works had been composed for the ondes. Jeanne Loriod estimated that there were 15 concertos and 300 pieces of chamber music. Thomas Ad√®s's opera The Exterminating Angel features an ondes Martenot, which Ad√®s says \\"could be considered the voice of the exterminating angel\\". =Popular music= Jonny Greenwood playing a 1980s student-model ondes Martenot at the 2010 Glastonbury Festival One of the first integrations of the ondes Martenot into popular music was done in French chanson during the fifties and sixties. For example in some of Baudelaire's poems set to music by French singer L√©o Ferr√© in his albums Les Fleurs du mal (1957) and L√©o Ferr√© chante Baudelaire (1967), or in popular dramatic lovesong Jacques Brel's \\"Ne me quitte pas\\" (1959). During the seventies Beau Dommage and Harmonium, the two most popular musical groups of the Quebec musical scene, made extensive use of this instrument (introduced there by Marie Bernard) in each of their 1975 albums, respectively O√π est pass√©e la noce? and Si on avait besoin d'une cinqui√®me saison. Jonny Greenwood of the English rock band Radiohead is credited with bringing the ondes to a larger audience. He first used it on Radiohead's 2000 album Kid A, and it has appeared in many of their songs, including \\"The National Anthem\\", \\"How to Disappear Completely\\", and \\"Where I End and You Begin\\". Radiohead have performed versions of their songs \\"How to Disappear Completely\\" and \\"Weird Fishes / Arpeggi\\" using several ondes Martenots. On their 2001 album Amnesiac, they used the ondes martenot palm speaker to add a \\"halo of hazy reverberance\\" to Thom Yorke's vocals on the song \\"You and Whose Army?\\". Greenwood also composed a piece for two ondes Martenots, Smear. The ondes Martenot was used by Joe Jackson on his albums Tucker (1988), and Night Music (1994) and by Bryan Ferry on the 1999 album As Time Goes By. Ondist Thomas Bloch toured in Tom Waits and Robert Wilson's show The Black Rider (2004‚Äì06) and in Damon Albarn's opera \\"Monkey: Journey to the West\\" (2007‚Äì2013). Bloch performed ondes Martenot on the 2013 Daft Punk album Random Access Memories. The French composer Christine Ott released in 2020 Chim√®res (pour Ondes Martenot), an electronic avant-garde album entirely conceived using only the Ondes Martenot. =Film and television= The ondes Martenot has featured in many films, particularly science fiction and horror films. In 1936 Adolphe Borchard used it in Sacha Guitry's Le roman d'un tricheur, played by Martenot's sister, Ginette. It was used by composer Brian Easdale in the ballet music for The Red Shoes. French composer Maurice Jarre introduced the ondes Martenot to American cinema in his score for Lawrence of Arabia (1962). The English composer Richard Rodney Bennett used it for scores for films including Billion Dollar Brain (1967) and Secret Ceremony (1968).Ross Care and Lukas Kendall, \\"Billion Dollar Brain FSM Online Liner Notes Film Score Monthly (2008). Elmer Bernstein learned about the ondes Martenot through Bennet, and used it in scores for films including Heavy Metal,Interview with Dan Goldwasser, originally published on SoundtrackNet, July 2000 Ghostbusters,Interview with Randall D. Larson, originally published in CinemaScore #13/14, 1985 The Black Cauldron, and My Left Foot. Director Lucille Had≈æihaliloviƒá decided to use the instrument in her film Evolution (2015) as it \\"brings a certain melancholy, almost a human voice, and it instantly creates a particular atmosphere\\". Other film scores that use the ondes Martenot include A Passage to India, Amelie, Bodysong, There Will Be Blood (2007) and Hugo (2011).Howard Shore, Hugo ‚Äì Original Score, CD booklet, published by Paramount Pictures in the year 2011 The ondes Martenot is the subject of the 2013 Quebec documentary Wavemakers. It is used in a performance of Messiaen's Quartet for the End of Time in an episode from the third season of the Amazon series Mozart in the Jungle, where a musician plays the ondes Martenot to inmates on Rikers Island. The British composer Barry Gray studied the instrument with Martenot in Paris, and used it in his soundtracks for 1960s films including Dr Who and the Daleks, and Doppelg√§nger. The ondes martenot is sometimes reported as having been used in the original Star Trek theme; in fact, the part was performed by a singer.  Legacy  In 2001, the New York Times described the ondes, along with other early electronic instruments such as the theremin, teleharmonium, trautonium, and orgatron, as part of a \\"futuristic electric music movement that never went remotely as far as its pioneers dreamed ... proponents of the new wired music delighted in making previously unimaginable noises\\". The French classical musician Thomas Bloch said: \\"The ondes martenot is probably the most musical of all electric instruments ... Martenot was not only interested in sounds. He wanted to use electricity to increase and control the expression, the musicality. Everything is made by the musician in real time, including the control of the vibrato, the intensity, and the attack. It is an important step in our electronic instrument lineage.\\" A recording of the Ondomo, an instrument based on the ondes Martenot According to music journalist Alex Ross, fewer than 100 people have mastered the instrument. In 1997, Mark Singer wrote for The Wire that the ondes would likely remain obscure: The fact is that any instrument with no institutional grounding of second- and third-raters, no spectral army of amateurs, will wither and vanish: how can it not? Specialist virtuosos may arrive to tackle the one-off novelty ... but there's no meaningful level of entry at the ground floor, and, what's worse, no fallback possibility of rank careerism if things don't turn out. In 2009, the Guardian reported that the last ondes Martenot was manufactured in 1988, but that a new model was being manufactured. In 2011, Sound on Sound wrote that original ondes Martenot models were \\"all but impossible to obtain or afford, and unless you can stump up 12,000 Euros for one of Jean‚ÄëLoup Dierstein's new reproduction instruments, the dream of owning a real Ondes is likely to remain such\\". In 2012, the Canadian company Therevox began selling a synthesizer with an interface based on the ondes Martenot pitch ring and intensity key. In 2017, the Japanese company Asaden manufactured 100 Ondomo instruments, a portable version of the ondes Martenot. The ondes Martenot's electronics are fragile, and it includes a powder which transfers electric currents, which Martenot would mix in different quantities according to musicians' specifications; the precise proportions are unknown. Attempts to construct new ondes Martenot models using Martenot's original specifications have been mixed.

His main achievements were during the Second Punic War. He is best known for defeating Hannibal at the final Battle of Zama (near modern Zama, Tunisia) in 202 BC. The victory was one of the feats that earned him the agnomen Africanus. Scipio's conquest of Carthaginian Iberia culminated in the Battle of Ilipa (near Alcal√° del R√≠o, Spain) in 206 BC against Hannibal's brother Mago Barca. Although considered a hero by the Roman people, primarily for his victories against Carthage, Africanus had many opponents, especially Cato the Elder, who hated him deeply. In 187 BC, he was tried in a show trial alongside his brother for bribes they supposedly received from King Antiochos III during the Roman‚ÄìSeleucid War. Disillusioned by the ingratitude of his peers, Scipio left Rome and retired from public life at his villa in Liternum. Early years Publius Cornelius Scipio was born by Caesarean section into the Scipio branch of the gens Cornelia. His birth year is calculated from statements made by ancient historians (mainly Livy and Polybius) of how old he was when certain events in his life occurred and must have been 236/5 BC, usually stated as circa 236 BC. The Cornelii were one of six major patrician families, along with the gentes Manlia, Fabia, Aemilia, the Claudia, and Valeria, with a record of successful public service in the highest offices extending back at least to the early Roman Republic. Scipio's great-grandfather, Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus, and grandfather Lucius Cornelius Scipio, had both been consuls and censors. He was the eldest son of the consul Publius Cornelius Scipio by his wife Pomponia, daughter of plebeian consul Manius Pomponius Matho. Scipio was a member of the Salii, the college of priests of Mars.Livy, xxxvii. 33.Broughton, vol. I, p. 360. Early military service Scipio joined the Roman struggle against Carthage in the first year of the Second Punic War when his father was consul. During the Battle of Ticinus, he saved his father's life by \\"charging the encircling force alone with reckless daring.\\"Polybius, The Histories 10.3.5. He survived the disaster at the Battle of Cannae, where his would-be father-in-law, the consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus, was killed. After the battle, with the other consul surviving elsewhere, Scipio and Appius Claudius Pulcher, as military tribunes, took charge of some 10,360 survivors. On hearing that Lucius Caecilius Metellus and other young nobles were planning to go overseas to serve some king, Scipio stormed into the meeting, and at sword-point, forced all present to swear that they would not abandon Rome.Livy, History of Rome 22.53. Scipio offered himself as a candidate for aedilis curulis in 213 BC alongside his cousin Marcus Cornelius Cethegus.Livy 25.2.6. \\"The story that Scipio won election both for himself and his brother is intrinsically improbable, and despite the authority of Polybius (10.4‚Äì5), has been generally rejected.\\" See Broughton, vol. 1, p. 267. The Tribunate of the Plebs objected to his candidacy, saying that he could not be allowed to stand because he had not yet reached the legal age. Scipio, already known for his bravery and patriotism, was elected unanimously and the Tribunes abandoned their opposition. His cousin also won the election.Livy 25.2.6‚Äì7. Campaign in Hispania Nicholas Poussin's painting of the Continence of Scipio, depicting his return of a captured young woman to her fianc√©, having refused to accept her from his troops as a prize of war. A Carthaginian coin depicting Hasdrubal Barca (245‚Äì207 BC), one of Hannibal's younger brothers, wearing a diadem In 211 BC, both Scipio's father, Publius Scipio, and uncle, Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus, were killed at the Battle of the Upper Baetis in Spain against Hannibal's brother, Hasdrubal Barca. At the election of a new proconsul for the command of the new army which the Romans resolved to send to Hispania, Scipio was the only man brave enough to ask for this position, no other candidates wanting the responsibility, considering it a death sentence.Livy, Book XXVI, Chapter 18 \\"...declaring himself a candidate, took his station on an eminence from which he could be seen by all.\\" In spite of his youth (25 years), his noble demeanour and enthusiastic language had made so great an impression that he was unanimously elected. In the year of Scipio's arrival (211 BC),Livy 26, 19, 11 all of Hispania south of the Ebro river was under Carthaginian control. Hannibal's brothers Hasdrubal and Mago, and Hasdrubal Gisco were the generals of the Carthaginian forces in Hispania, and Rome was aided by the inability of these three figures to act in concert. The Carthaginians were also preoccupied with revolts in Africa. Scipio landed at the mouth of the Ebro and was able to surprise and capture Carthago Nova (New Carthage), the headquarters of the Carthaginian power in Hispania. He obtained a rich cache of war stores and supplies and an excellent harbour and base of operations. Scipio's humanitarian conduct toward prisoners and hostages in Hispania helped in portraying the Romans as liberators as opposed to conquerors. Livy tells the story of his troops capturing a beautiful woman, whom they offered to Scipio as a prize of war. Scipio was astonished by her beauty but discovered that the woman was betrothed to a Celtiberian chieftain named Allucius. He returned the woman to her fianc√©, along with the money that had been offered by her parents to ransom her. This humanitarian act encouraged local chieftains to both supply and reinforce Scipio's small army. The woman's fianc√©, who soon married her, responded by bringing over his tribe to support the Roman armies.Livy, Ab urbe condita libri xxvi. 50 In 209 BC, Scipio fought his first set piece battle, driving back Hasdrubal Barca from his position at Baecula on the upper Guadalquivir. Scipio feared that the armies of Mago and Gisco would enter the field and surround his small army. Scipio's objective was, therefore, to quickly eliminate one of the armies to give him the luxury of dealing with the other two piecemeal. The battle was decided by a determined Roman infantry charge up the centre of the Carthaginian position. Roman losses are uncertain but may have been considerable in light of an effort by the infantry to scale an elevation defended by Carthaginian light infantry. Scipio then orchestrated a frontal attack by the rest of his infantry to draw out the remainder of the Carthaginian forces. Hasdrubal had not noticed Scipio's hidden reserves of cavalry moving behind enemy lines, and a Roman cavalry charge created a double envelopment on either flank led by cavalry commander Gaius Laelius and Scipio himself. This broke the back of Hasdrubal's army and routed his forces‚Äîan impressive feat for the young Roman versus the veteran Carthaginian general. Despite a Roman victory, Scipio was unable to hinder the Carthaginian march to Italy. Much historical criticism has been levelled at his inability to effectively pursue Hasdrubal, who would eventually cross the Alps only to be defeated by Gaius Claudius Nero at the Battle of the Metaurus. One popular theory for Scipio's failure to pursue Hasdrubal is that Scipio merely wanted the glory of securing Hispania, and an extended mountain campaign would have endangered that. Others cite the Roman soldiers' appetite for plunder as preventing him from rallying in pursuit. The most probable explanation from a strategic standpoint is Scipio's unwillingness to risk being trapped between Hasdrubal's army on one side and one or both of Gisgo's and Mago's armies, both of superior numerical strength. Mere days after Hasdrubal's defeat, Mago and Gisgo were able to converge in front of the Roman positions, bringing into question what would have happened had Scipio pursued Hasdrubal. After winning over a number of Hispanian chiefs (namely Indibilis and Mandonius), Scipio achieved a decisive victory in 206 BC over the full Carthaginian levy at Ilipa (now the city of Alcal√° del R√≠o, near Hispalis, now called Seville), which resulted in the evacuation of Hispania by the Punic commanders. After his rapid success in conquering Hispania, and with the idea of striking a blow at Carthage in Africa, Scipio paid a short visit to the Numidian princes Syphax and Massinissa. Numidia was of vital importance to Carthage, supplying both mercenaries and allied forces. In addition to supplying the Numidian cavalry (on which see the Battle of Cannae), Numidia operated as a buffer for vulnerable Carthage. Scipio managed to receive support from both Syphax and Massinissa. Syphax later changed his mind, married the beautiful Carthaginian noblewoman Sophonisba, daughter of Hasdrubal the son of Gisco, and fought alongside his Carthaginian in-laws against Massinissa and Scipio in Africa. On his return to Hispania, Scipio had to quell a mutiny at Sucro which had broken out among his troops. Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal had meanwhile marched for Italy, and in 206 BC Scipio himself, having secured the Roman occupation of Hispania by the capture of Gades, gave up his command and returned to Rome. African campaign Carthaginian coin possibly depicting Hannibal as Hercules (i.e. Heracles) In 205 BC, Scipio was unanimously elected to consulship at the age of 31. Scipio intended to go to Africa, but due to the envy of others in the Senate, he was not given any additional troops beyond the Sicilian garrison. Despite this resistance, Scipio gathered resources from clients and supporters in Rome and among the Italian communities; this allowed him to muster a volunteer force of 30 warships and 7000 men.Livy, Ab urbe condita libri xxviii.45‚Äì46. The forces stationed in Sicily at this time included a variety of forces. The Romans had for a long time used service in Sicily as a punishment, with the result that the garrison in Sicily contained survivors from many of the greatest Roman military fiascos in the war, such as the Battle of Cannae. Having served with these men at Cannae, Scipio was well aware that their disgrace was through no fault of their own. In addition, the Sicilian garrison also contained many of the troops who had participated in the Sicilian campaigns of Marcus Claudius Marcellus. From these men, Scipio was able to muster a highly motivated and very experienced force for his African invasion.Livy, Ab urbe condita libri xxix.1, xxix.25. Scipio turned Sicily into a camp for training his army. Scipio realized that the Carthaginian forces‚Äîespecially the superior Numidian cavalry‚Äîwould prove decisive against the largely infantry forces of the Roman legions. In addition, a large portion of Rome's cavalry were allies of questionable loyalty, or noble equites exempting themselves from being lowly foot soldiers. One anecdote tells of how Scipio pressed into service several hundred Sicilian nobles to create a cavalry force. The Sicilians were quite opposed to this servitude to a foreign occupier (Sicily being under Roman control only since the First Punic War), and protested vigorously. Scipio assented to their exemption from service providing they pay for a horse, equipment, and a replacement rider for the Roman army. In this way, Scipio created a trained nucleus of cavalry for his African campaign. Tiepolo, Scipio Africanus is shown releasing the nephew of the Prince of Numidia after he was captured by Roman soldiers. The Walters Art Museum. The Roman Senate sent a commission of inquiry to Sicily and found Scipio at the head of a well-equipped and trained fleet and army. Scipio pressed the Senate for permission to cross into Africa. Some of the Roman Senate, championed by Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus Cunctator (\\"the Delayer\\"), opposed the mission. Fabius still feared Hannibal's power, and viewed any mission to Africa as dangerous and wasteful to the war effort.Plutarch, Fabius, 25, 26. Scipio was also harmed by some senators' disdain of his ideals, beliefs, and interests in unconventional areas such as Hellenophile tastes in art, luxuries, and philosophies. All Scipio could obtain was permission to cross over from Sicily to Africa if it appeared to be in the interests of Rome, but not financial or military support. With the permission from the commissioners, Scipio sailed in 204 BC and landed near Utica. Carthage, meanwhile, had secured the friendship of the Numidian Syphax, whose advance compelled Scipio to abandon the siege of Utica and dig in on the shore between there and Carthage. In 203 BC, he destroyed the combined armies of the Carthaginians and Numidians by approaching by stealth and setting fire to their camp, where the combined army became panicked and fled, when they were mostly killed by Scipio's army. Though not a \\"battle,\\" both Polybius and Livy estimate that the death toll in this single attack exceeded 40,000 Carthaginian and Numidian dead, and more captured. Historians are roughly equal in their praise and condemnation for this act. Polybius said, \\"of all the brilliant exploits performed by Scipio this seems to me the most brilliant and more adventurous.\\" On the other hand, one of Hannibal's principal biographers, Theodore Ayrault Dodge, goes so far as to suggest that this attack was out of cowardice and spares no more than a page upon the event in total, despite the fact that it secured the siege of Utica and effectively put Syphax out of the war. The irony of Dodge's accusations of Scipio's cowardice is that the attack showed traces of Hannibal's penchant for ambush. Scipio quickly dispatched his two lieutenants, Laelius and Masinissa, to pursue Syphax. They ultimately dethroned Syphax, and ensured Prince Masinissa's coronation as King of the Numidians. Carthage, and especially Hannibal himself, had long relied upon these superb natural horsemen, who would now fight for Rome against Carthage. =War with Hannibal, the Battle of Zama= Scipio's military campaign in Africa (204‚Äì203 BC) Now deserted by its allies and surrounded by a veteran and undefeated Roman army, Carthage began opening diplomatic channels for negotiation. At the same time, Hannibal Barca and his army were recalled to Carthage, and despite the moderate terms offered to Carthage by Scipio, Carthage suddenly suspended negotiations and again prepared for war. The army that Hannibal returned with is a subject of much debate. Advocates for Hannibal often claim that his army was mostly Italians pressed into service from southern Italy and that most of his elite veterans (and certainly cavalry) were spent. Scipio's advocates tend to be far more suspicious and believe the number of veteran forces to remain significant. Hannibal did have a trained pool of soldiers who had fought in Italy, as well as eighty war elephants. Hannibal could boast a strength of around forty thousand: 36,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry, compared to Scipio's 29,000 infantry and 6,100 cavalry.Lazenby, Hannibal's War, pp. 220‚Äì221 The two generals met on a plain between Carthage and Utica on October 19, 202 BC, at the final Battle of Zama. Despite mutual admiration, negotiations floundered due largely to Roman distrust of the Carthaginians as a result of the Carthaginian attack on Saguntum, the breach of protocols which ended the First Punic War (known as Punic Faith), and a perceived breach in contemporary military etiquette due to Hannibal's numerous ambushes. Hannibal arranged his infantry in three phalangial lines designed to overlap the Roman lines. His strategy, so oft reliant upon subtle stratagems, was simple: a massive forward attack by the war elephants would create gaps in the Roman lines, which would be exploited by the infantry, supported by the cavalry. Meeting of Hannibal and Scipio at Zama. Rather than arranging his forces in the traditional manipular lines, which put the hastati, principes, and triarii in succeeding lines parallel to the enemy's line, Scipio instead put the maniples in lines perpendicular to the enemy, a stratagem designed to counter the war elephants. When the Carthaginian elephants charged, they found well laid traps before the Roman position and were greeted by Roman trumpeters, which drove many back out of confusion and fear. In addition, many elephants were goaded harmlessly through the loose ranks by the velites and other skirmishers. Roman javelins were used to good effect, and the sharp traps caused further disorder among the elephants. Many of them were so distraught that they charged back into their own lines. The Roman infantry was greatly rattled by the elephants, but Massinissa's Numidian and Laelius' Roman cavalry began to drive the opposing cavalry off the field. Both cavalry commanders pursued their routing Carthaginian counterparts, leaving the Carthaginian and Roman infantries to engage one another. The resulting infantry clash was fierce and bloody, with neither side achieving local superiority. The Roman infantry had driven off the two front lines of the Carthaginian army, and in the respite took an opportunity to drink water. The Roman army was then drawn up in one long line (as opposed to the traditional three lines) in order to match the length of Hannibal's line. Scipio's army then marched towards Hannibal's veterans, who had not yet taken part in the battle. The final struggle was bitter and won only when the allied cavalry rallied and returned to the battle field. Charging the rear of Hannibal's army, they caused what many historians have called the \\"Roman Cannae\\". Many Roman aristocrats, especially Cato, expected Scipio to raze that city to the ground after his victory. However, Scipio dictated extremely moderate terms in contrast to an immoderate Roman Senate. While the security of Rome was guaranteed by demands such as the surrender of the fleet, and a lasting tribute was to be paid, the strictures were sufficiently light for Carthage to regain its full prosperity. With Scipio's consent, Hannibal was allowed to become the civic leader of Carthage, which the Cato family did not forget. =Return to Rome= Scipio was welcomed back to Rome in triumph with the agnomen of Africanus. He refused the many further honours which the people would have thrust upon him such as Consul for life and Dictator. In the year 199 BC, Scipio was elected Censor and for some years afterwards he lived quietly and took no part in politics. In 193 BC, Scipio was one of the commissioners sent to Africa to settle a dispute between Massinissa and the Carthaginians, which the commission did not achieve. This may have been because Hannibal, in the service of Antiochus III of Syria, might have come to Carthage to gather support for a new attack on Italy. In 190 BC, when the Romans declared war against Antiochus III, Publius offered to join his brother Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus if the Senate entrusted the chief command to him. The two brothers brought the war to a conclusion by a decisive victory at Magnesia in the same year. Retirement Bronze bust formerly attributed to Scipio Africanus, dated mid-first century BC Scipio's political enemies, led by Marcus Porcius Cato the Elder, gained ground. When the Scipiones returned to Rome, two tribunes prosecuted (187 BC) Lucius on the grounds of misappropriation of money received from Antiochus. As Lucius was in the act of producing his account-books, his brother wrested them from his hands, tore them in pieces, and flung them on the floor of the Senate house. Scipio then allegedly asked the courts why they were concerned about how 3,000 talents had been spent and apparently unconcerned about how 15,000 talents were entering the state coffers (the tribute that Antiochus was paying Rome after his defeat by Lucius). This high-handed act shamed the prosecution, and it appears that the case against Lucius was dismissed, though Lucius would again be prosecuted, and this time convicted, after the death of Scipio. Scipio himself was subsequently (185 BC) accused of having been bribed by Antiochus. By reminding the people that it was the anniversary of his victory at Zama, he caused an outburst of enthusiasm in his favour. The people crowded round him and followed him to the Capitol, where they offered thanks to the gods and begged them to give Rome more citizens like Scipio Africanus. Despite the popular support that Scipio commanded, there were renewed attempts to bring him to trial, but these appear to have been deflected by his future son- in-law, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, the Elder.Livy, History of Rome, XXXVIII, 53 It is supposedly in gratitude for this act that Scipio betrothed his youngest daughter Cornelia Africana Minor (then aged about 5) to Gracchus, several decades her senior (however, no contemporaneous references to this event exist; what is known is that Gracchus did marry Cornelia, aged about 18, in 172 BC). =Death= Scipio retired to his country seat at Liternum on the coast of Campania. He lived there for the rest of his life, revealing his great magnanimity by attempting to prevent the ruin of the exiled Hannibal by Rome. He died probably in 183 BC (the actual year and date of his death is unknown) aged about 53. His death is said to have taken place under suspicious circumstances, and it is possible that he either died of the lingering effects of the fever contracted while on campaign in 190 BC, or that he took his own life for causes unknown. He is said to have demanded that his body be buried away from his ungrateful city, and the Emperor Augustus is said to have visited his tomb in Liternum more than 150 years later. However, it is not certain that he was actually buried at Liternum, and no contemporary accounts of his death or funeral exist. It is said that he ordered an inscription on his tomb: Ingrata patria, ne ossa quidem habebis (\\"ungrateful fatherland, you will not even have my bones\\"). Coincidentally, his great rival Hannibal died in Bithynia in the same year or shortly thereafter, also an exile (albeit far from his native city and not by his own decision), pursued and harassed to the end by Romans such as Titus Quinctius Flamininus. Marriage and issue With his wife Aemilia Paulla (also called Aemilia Tertia), daughter of the consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus who fell at Cannae and sister of another consul Lucius Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus, he had a happy and fruitful marriage. Aemilia Paulla had unusual freedom and wealth for a patrician married woman, and she was an important role model for many younger Roman women, just as her youngest daughter Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi, would be an important role model for many Late Republican Roman noblewomen, including allegedly the mother of Julius Caesar. Scipio Africanus had two sons. The elder Publius Cornelius Scipio was appointed an augur in 180 BC;Livy, History of Rome 20.24. he never ran for office due to poor health.Cicero, Brutus, a History of Famous Orators 77. The younger Lucius Cornelius Scipio became praetor in 174 BC,Broughton, vol. 1, p. 404. and was expelled from the Senate by the censors.Livy, History of Rome 41.27. The elder son Publius adopted his first cousin, his uncle Lucius Aemilius Paullus' second son, who received the name Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus. Scipio and Aemilia Paulla also had two surviving daughters. The elder, Cornelia Africana Major, married her second cousin Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Corculum (son of the consul of 191 BC who was himself son of Scipio's elder paternal uncle Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus). This son-in-law was a distinguished Roman in his own right. He became consul (abdicating or resigning in 162 BC for religious reasons, then being re- elected in 155 BC), censor in 159 BC, Princeps Senatus, and died as Pontifex Maximus in 141 BC. Scipio Nasica rose to many of the dignities enjoyed by his late father-in-law, and was noted for his staunch (if ultimately futile) opposition to Cato the Censor over the fate of Carthage from about 157 to 149 BC. They had at least one surviving son (of whom more below). The younger daughter was more famous in history; Cornelia Africana Minor, the young wife of the elderly Tiberius Gracchus Major or Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, tribune of the plebs, praetor, then consul 177 (then censor and consul again), became the mother of 12 children, the only surviving sons being the famous Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Gracchus. All three surviving children of this union were ill-fated; the brothers Gracchi died relatively young, murdered or forced to commit suicide by more conservative relatives. The eldest child and only surviving daughter, Sempronia, was married to her mother's first cousin (and her own cousin by adoption) Scipio Aemilianus Africanus. The couple had no children, and Sempronia grew to hate her husband after he condoned the murder of her brother Tiberius in 132 BC. Scipio's mysterious death in 129 BC, at the age of 56, was blamed by some on his wife, and by others on his political rivals. Scipio's only descendants living through the late Republican period were the descendants of his two daughters, his sons having died without legitimate surviving issue. His younger daughter's last surviving child Sempronia, wife and then widow of Scipio Aemilianus, was alive as late as 102 BC. His other known grandson Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio was far more conservative than his Gracchi cousins. He and his descendants all became increasingly conservative, in stark contrast to the father and grandfathers. Scipio Africanus's eldest grandson Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio became consul in 138, murdered his own cousin Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus (163‚Äì132 BC) in 132. Scipio Nasica Serapio, although Pontifex Maximus was sent to Asia Minor by the Senate to escape the wrath of the Gracchi supporters, and died mysteriously there in Pergamum, and is believed to have been poisoned by an agent of the Gracchi. Serapio's son, the fourth Scipio Nasica, was even more conservative, and rose to be consul in 111 BC. This Scipio Nasica's sons became praetors only shortly before the Marsic or Social War (starting 91 BC). However, a grandson (adopted into the plebeian-noble Caecilii Metelli) became the Metellus Scipio who allied himself with Pompey the Great and Cato the Younger, and who opposed Julius Caesar. Metellus Scipio was the last Scipio to distinguish himself militarily or politically. None of Scipio's descendants, apart from Scipio Aemilianus‚Äîhis wife's nephew who became his adoptive grandson‚Äîcame close to matching his political career or his military successes.

The Tomb of the Scipios has been discovered and is open to the public, but it is not believed that Scipio Africanus was interred there. The possibility exists that he was returned to Rome and laid to rest there in a still undiscovered crypt. Livy says in his History of Rome that statues of Scipio Africanus, Lucius Scipio and the Roman poet Ennius (a friend of the family) were present at the Tomb of the Scipios when he visited it. However, Seneca (Epistle 86.1), having moved into the villa at Liternum that used to belong to Scipio Africanus, says that he has done \\"reverence to his [Africanus'] spirit and to an altar which I am inclined to think is the tomb of that great warrior\\". This suggests that it was known that Africanus was not buried inside Rome, and it is possible that his sarcophagus did indeed resemble an altar (although there is no direct evidence for this), given that that of the \\"founder\\" of the Scipiones, Scipio Barbatus, which can be found in pride of place in the family tomb, is altar-like in style. Lost sources Scipio is said to have written his memoirs in Greek, but those are lost (perhaps destroyed) along with the history written by his elder son and namesake (adoptive father of Scipio Aemilianus) and his Life by Plutarch. As a result, contemporary accounts of his life, particularly his childhood and youth, are virtually non-existent. Even Plutarch's account of Scipio's life, written much later, has been lost. What remains are accounts of his doings in Polybius, Livy's Histories (which say little about his private life), supplemented with the surviving histories of Appian and Cassius Dio, and the odd anecdote in Valerius Maximus. Of these, Polybius was the closest to Scipio Africanus in age and in connections, but his narrative may be biased by his friendship with Scipio's close relatives and that the primary source of his information about Africanus came from one of his best friends, Gaius Laelius. Roman opinions of Scipio Scipio was a man of great intellect and culture who could speak and read Greek, wrote his own memoirs in Greek and became also noted for his introduction of the clean shaven face fashion among the Romans according to the example of Alexander the Great. This man's fashion lasted until the time of emperor Hadrian and then was revived again by Constantine the Great. He also enjoyed the reputation of being a graceful orator, the secret of his sway being his deep self-confidence and radiant sense of fairness. To his political opponents, he was often harsh and arrogant, but towards others singularly gracious and sympathetic. His Graecophile lifestyle, and his unconventional way of wearing the Roman toga, raised much opposition among some Senators of Rome, led by Cato the Elder who felt that Greek influence was destroying Roman culture. Cato, as a loyalist of Fabius Maximus, had been sent out as quaestor to Scipio in Sicily circa 204 BC to investigate charges of military indiscipline, corruption, and other offence against Scipio; none of those charges was found true by the tribunes of the plebs accompanying Cato (it may or may not be significant that years later, as censor, Cato degraded Scipio's brother Scipio Asiaticus from the Senate. It is certainly true that some Romans of the day viewed Cato as a representative of the old Romans, and Scipio and his like as Graecophiles). He often visited the temple of Jupiter and made offerings there. There was a belief that he was a special favourite of heaven and actually communicated with the gods. It is quite possible that he himself honestly shared this belief. However, the strength of this belief is evident, even a generation later when his adopted grandson, Publius Aemilianus Scipio, was elected to the consulship from the office of tribune. His rise was spectacular and letters survive from soldiers under his command in Hispania show that they believed that he possessed the same abilities as his grandfather. The elder Scipio was a spiritual man as well as a soldier and statesman, and was a priest of Mars. The ability which he is supposed to have possessed is called by the old name, \\"second sight\\", and he is supposed to have had prescient dreams in which he saw the future. Livy describes this belief as it was perceived then, without offering his opinion as to its veracity. Polybius made a case that Scipio's successes resulted from good planning, rational thinking and intelligence, which he said was a higher sign of the gods' favour than prophetic dreams. Polybius suggested that people had only said that Scipio had supernatural powers because they had not appreciated the natural mental gifts which facilitated Scipio's achievements. The continence of Scipio Continence of Scipio, Nicolas-Guy Brenet The Roman historian Valerius Maximus, writing in the first century AD, alleged that Scipio Africanus had a weakness for beautiful women, and knowing this, some of his soldiers presented him with a beautiful young woman captured in New Carthage. The woman turned out to be the fianc√©e of an important Iberian chieftainAllucius (Livy, History of Rome XXVI.50), cf. Indibilis (Valerius Maximus, Memorable Deeds and Sayings 4.3.1) and Scipio chose to act as a general and not an ordinary soldier in restoring her, virtue and ransom intact, to her fianc√©.Livy, Roman History, XXVI, 50 (extract) This episode was frequently depicted by painters of the Renaissance and early modern era as the Continence of Scipio. According to Valerius Maximus, Scipio had a relationship from circa 191 BC with one of his own serving girls, which his wife magnanimously overlooked.Womanly virtue. 1st cent. A.D., Valerius Maximus, Memorable Deeds and Sayings 6.7.1‚Äì3. L Women's Life in Greece & Rome The affair, if it lasted from circa 191 BC to Scipio's death 183 BC, might have resulted in issue (not mentioned); what is mentioned is that the girl was freed by Aemilia Paulla after Scipio's death and married to one of his freedmen. This account is only found in Valerius Maximus (Memorable Deeds and Sayings 6.7.1‚Äì3. L) writing in the 1st century AD, some decades after Livy. Valerius Maximus is hostile to Scipio Africanus in other matters such as his frequent visits to the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, which Maximus saw as \\"fake religion.\\" Legacy =Military= Scipio is considered by many to be one of Rome's greatest generals; he never lost a battle. Skillful alike in strategy and in tactics, he had also the faculty of inspiring his soldiers with confidence. Livy reports that, as a Roman commissioner to Ephesus following the defeat of Antiochus III, on meeting the exiled Hannibal, Scipio took the opportunity to ask Hannibal's opinion of the \\"greatest commander,\\" to which Hannibal named Alexander the Great as the first and Pyrrhus as the second. Livy continues, \\"On Scipio's again asking him whom he regarded as the third, Hannibal, without any hesitation, replied, 'Myself.' Scipio smiled and asked, 'What would you say if you had vanquished me?' 'In that case,' replied Hannibal, 'I should say that I surpassed Alexander and Pyrrhus, and all other commanders in the world.' Scipio was delighted with the turn which the speaker had with true Carthaginian adroitness given to his answer, and the unexpected flattery it conveyed, because Hannibal had set him apart from the ordinary run of military captains as an incomparable commander.\\"Livy, 35.14 from mcadams.posc.mu.edu/ Plutarch also recounts this conversation in Life of Titus Flamininus, 21.3‚Äì4 Metellus Scipio, a descendant of Scipio, commanded legions against Julius Caesar in Africa until his defeat at the Battle of Thapsus in 49 BC. Popular superstition was that only a Scipio could win a battle in Africa, so Julius Caesar assigned a distant relative of Metellus to his staff in order to say that he too had a Scipio fighting for him. =Political= Scipio was the first Roman general to expand Roman territories outside Italy and islands around the Italian mainland. He conquered the Carthaginian territory of Iberia for Rome, although the two Iberian provinces were not fully pacified for a couple of centuries. His defeat of Hannibal at Zama paved the way for Carthage's eventual destruction in 146 BC. His interest in a Graecophile lifestyle had tremendous influence on the Roman elite; more than a century later, even the conservative Cato Uticensis (great-grandson of the elder Cato) espoused Greek philosophy. Scipio did not introduce Greek ideas or art to the Romans, but his ardent support for the Greek way of life coupled with his own charisma had its inevitable impact. Less beneficially, the Scipios may have led the way in the inevitable chasm that grew up between the Roman elite and the Roman masses, in terms of the way the elite was educated and lived and in the amount of wealth they possessed. Scipio supported land distribution for his veterans in a tradition harking back to the earliest days of the Republic, yet his actions were seen as somewhat radical by conservatives. In being a successful general who demanded lands for his soldiers, Scipio may have led the way for later generals such as Gaius Marius and Julius Caesar. Unlike Marius or Caesar, however, he did not seek to use his charisma and reputation to weaken the Republic. The true measure of Scipio's character in this regard can perhaps be seen by his behaviour shortly after returning in triumph from Africa to a grateful Rome. Scipio refused to accept demands for him to become perpetual consul and dictator. For his self- restraint in putting the good of the republic ahead of his own gain, Scipio was praised by Livy for showing uncommon greatness of mind‚Äîan example conspicuously not emulated by Marius, Sulla or Caesar. The relatives of Scipio continued to dominate the republic for a couple of generations. This domination came to an end in the tumults between the Gracchi brothers, who were his grandsons, and their other relatives in the period from 133 to 122 BC. The Gracchi brothers championed land redistribution in order to boost the ranks of potential Roman soldiers, as Roman soldiers needed to own land to be enfranchised for service in the legions and the number of Roman land owners was withering. They were lynched by their relatives who disapproved of their methods and perhaps had economic reasons to fear the land redistribution. After the fall of the Gracchi, the house of Caecilius became more prominent; however, the Scipiones maintained their aristocratic lustre, providing the consular general who unsuccessfully prevented Sulla's second march on Rome and Metellus Scipio whose daughter was the last wife of Pompey the Great, and who took over command in the civil war against Julius Caesar after the death of Pompey. The granddaughter of Gaius Gracchus, Fulvia, was also unusually prominent for a Roman woman in the affairs of the late republic, marrying Publius Clodius, Gaius Curio and Mark Antony in turn. At a later date, some Roman emperors claimed descent from Scipio Africanus. =Classical literature= Scipio appears or is mentioned in passing in Cicero's De Republica and De Amicitia, and in Silius Italicus' Punica (Cicero was mentored by prominent Romans whose ancestors had been associated with Scipio). As a Roman hero, Scipio appears in Book VI of the Aeneid where he is shown to Aeneas in a vision in the underworld. Scipio figures prominently in Livy's \\"Ab urbe condita libri\\" and is named as an example of a warrior at the end of Book III of Lucretius' De rerum natura. =Medieval literature= Scipio is mentioned four times in Dante's Divine Comedy: in \\"Inferno\\"‚ÄîCanto XXXI, in \\"Purgatorio\\"‚ÄîCanto XXIX, and in \\"Paradiso\\"‚ÄîCantos VI and XXVII. =Renaissance literature and art= Portrait of Scipio Africanus, marble, c. 1460-1465, by Mino da Fiesole (Philadelphia Museum of Art) Scipio is the hero of Petrarch's Latin epic Africa. 'The Continence [i.e. moderation] of Scipio' was a stock motif in exemplary literature and art, as was the 'Dream of Scipio', portraying his allegorical choice between Virtue and Luxury. The Continence of Scipio, depicting his clemency and sexual restraint after the fall of Carthago Nova, was an even more popular subject. Versions of the subject were painted by many artists from the Renaissance through to the 19th century, including Andrea Mantegna and Nicholas Poussin. Scipio is also mentioned in Machiavelli's work The Prince (Chapter XVII \\"Concerning Cruelty And Clemency, And Whether It Is Better To Be Loved Than Feared\\"). Milton mentions Scipio in Book 9 of Paradise Lost and in Book 3 of Paradise Regained. Raphael's painting Vision of a Knight is thought to be a depiction of Scipio. =Music= Publius Cornelius Scipio was the title character of a number of Italian operas composed during the baroque period of music, including settings by George Frideric Handel, Leonardo Vinci, and Carlo Francesco Pollarolo. The march from Handel's setting, entitled Scipione, remains the regimental slow march of the British Grenadier Guards. Scipio is also referenced in the Italian national anthem. =Film and television= Shortly before Italy's invasion of Ethiopia, Benito Mussolini commissioned an epic film depicting the exploits of Scipio. Scipione l'africano, written by Carmine Gallone, won the Mussolini Cup for the greatest Italian film at the 1937 Venice Film Festival. In 1971 Luigi Magni scripted and directed the movie Scipione, detto anche l'Africano (Scipio, aka \\"the African\\"), starring Marcello Mastroianni, Vittorio Gassman, Silvana Mangano and Woody Strode, in which the historical events are portrayed in a light and satirical mode, with some intentional references to the political events of the time in which the movie was made. In the 1983 BBC mini-series The Cleopatras, Scipio is portrayed by Geoffrey Whitehead. In the 2000 film Gladiator, the first battle in the Colosseum is meant to re-enact Scipio Africanus's battle of Zama against Hannibal's barbarian horde. In the film, Maximus ruins the re-enactment by leading the gladiators, who are meant to represent Hannibal's forces, to victory over Scipio's legionaries. In the 2006 television film Hannibal, he is portrayed by British actor Shaun Dingwall, notably at the battles of Cannae and Zama. =Video games= Scipio features as a playable character, represented by a cataphract, in the Battle of Zama in Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome. He also appears in the Haemimont Games video game Imperivm III: The Great Battles of Rome, Centurion: Defender of Rome, and in the Hannibal at the Gates campaign in Total War: Rome II.

He is best known for being the lead guitarist of the Swiss hard rock band, Krokus.  Career  In the early 1970s, Von Arb was playing in the band Montezuma when he was recruited by Chris von Rohr and Tommy Kiefer to join their band, Krokus. He joined the group in time for their second album, To You All as the rhythm guitarist. In the 1970s, Von Arb undertook the task of finding a powerful voice to front the band, encountering trouble until he discovered Maltese-born Marc Storace to lead his band's vocals for years to come. Although Von Arb and Storace have been apart for a few albums, they are still in Krokus to this day. At one point, Storace and Von Rohr quit the band, leaving Von Arb to create another band with ex-Krokus member Juerg Naegeli. They took pseudonyms which were Rob Weiss and Ben Branov (Branov is von Arb spelled backwards), and the two released a couple of albums that were big in Switzerland. In 1990, Von Arb assembled another line-up for Krokus, which would be shunned and uncared for. Around the same time, Von Arb became ill, leading to suspicion that he may have been diagnosed with lymphoma, but he is healthy now. 1994 rolled around, and Von Arb again tried to build Krokus. He was successful, with former vocalist Marc Storace rejoining the lineup. Failing to keep Storace in 1999 proved to be a downfall. Round 13 was released, but was less noticed. In 2004, Von Arb and Storace reunited once again and released live albums that proved to be an advantage of having Storace. In 2005, Von Arb temporarily left Krokus due to tendonitis in his wrist to be replaced by Mandy Meyer. However, by 2007, he had returned and was able to reunite the four principle members of the group's classic line-up (featuring himself, Storace, Von Rohr, and Freddy Steady). By 2008, the group's rhythm guitarist during much of the \\"classic lineup days,\\" Mark Kohler, had also rejoined the lineup, a landmark in the band's history, and the quintet played several live shows. In 2010, Krokus released the album Hoodoo. Von Arb and Krokus released Dirty Dynamite on March 5, 2013, with minor success in the US, but a major hit in Switzerland. It contains a cover of The Beatles' hit song \\"Help!\\".

Her 2001 single, \\"Today I Went Home to Mother\\" (), became a top charting song in Belarus and Russia. Her album Big Brother () topped charts not only in Belarus, but also throughout the Commonwealth of Independent States. Early life Kovalevskaya was born on May 6, 1983 in Smilavichy, Minsk. As a child, she would put on her mother's makeup and sing in front of the mirror while imitating singers Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. She briefly attended a school for gifted children where she sang in its choir and attended a technical school where she sang the song \\"Lost Dog\\". When she was eight, she started to win some music competitions and was recognized by a music teacher at her Smilavichy school. In one of the competitions, she became the regional representative for the Slavic Bazaar in Vitebsk. When she was 11, she received an offer to take a second year course in vocal at Glinka Music School, but she remained at Smilavichy to be with her mother. Career When Kovalevskaya was 15, she signed a contract with a music producer. In 2001, she released the single \\"Today I Went Home to Mother\\" (), and her first album You're an Adult. As part of their promotions outside of Belarus, she worked with Real Records to release her album in Russia. By then, she started using a color-based theme for her albums, and the name of her touring band was Kraski (). Her debut album was thus released as the Yellow album ‚Äì Big Brother (). In October 2001, Kovalevskaya and Paints went on tour, where they performed about 200 concerts at venues throughout Belarus. Her music was received well by the public. In 2002, she released her second single, \\"He doesn't know anything\\" (), which is about a bandit. She appeared on several television shows such as Big Laundry where she sang \\"He does not know anything.\\" After the tour concluded, she released her third single \\"I love you Joe\\". In January 2003, she released her fourth single, \\"My Mother\\" (), which is about a grown-up girl who wonder what's next. \\"My Mother\\" topped the singles charts. In 2003, Paints appears on some Russian television programs. Paints returned to the studio to record their second album, which uses the red color theme. The first single off of Red album, \\"I love you, Sergey\\"(), was about Kovalevskaya's interests in a young man of that name. It topped the singles chart. The album topped charts in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Poland, Germany, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. In May 2003, Kraski announced a tour to support the album. The shows were typically 90 minutes long and full of hits, dances, and costume changes. Kovalevskaya released her third Kraski album with an orange color theme. It contained the single \\"My Mother\\", and its title dance track \\"Orange Sun\\" (), which was released in November. The song reflected the changes in her life from a little girl to a young woman. Its corresponding video was presented as very bright and colorful. The band toured for the album in early 2004. In summer 2004, Kovalevskaya released her fourth Kraski album with a blue color theme. Its title track, \\"Spring\\" () topped the singles chart. Its second single \\"Big Brother-2\\" (), was a tender ballad, whose music video featured Kovalevskaya dressed as a bride. Her fifth album had a purple color theme. Its title track, \\"Those who love\\" (), was a duet with Russian pop singer Andrey Gubin. The album continued to show her mature side. Kraski expanded its 2005 tour to cities and countries they have not been to before. In 2005‚Äì2006 they traveled to England, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Hungary, Ireland and the United States. Kovalevskaya also lived in the United States for about a year, until she was pregnant with her second child. In the autumn of 2007, after a two-year hiatus, Oksana resumed her songwriting and started to produce her own album. In 2010, Kraski disbanded, as she decided to devote herself to new projects. She began touring as Oksana Kovalevskaya Kraski, where she sang music written by her producer, Alexei Voronov.

Like all hopping mice it has strong front teeth, a long tail, dark eyes, big ears, well-developed haunches and very long, narrow hind feet. It weighs between . (Compare with the common house mouse, at .) The coloration of the fawn hopping mouse varies from pale pinkish-fawn to grey on the upper parts, and white underneath. The tail is long, bicoloured (white underneath, darker below), and ends in a dark brush. The ears and round, dark eyes are particularly large, and the whiskers even more so: in a creature that is only long. The favoured habitat is the sparsely vegetated arid gibber plains and claypans of the Lake Eyre Basin, including parts of northern South Australia, far south-western Queensland and possibly the Northern Territory, though this last is uncertain. Records from the late 19th century show that its former range was more extensive including western New South Wales.Ellis, M. (1993). Extension to the known range of the Fawn Hopping-mouse Notomys cervinus in New South Wales. Australian Zoologist. 29:77-78. Breeding is thought to be opportunistic. In captivity, gestation is about 40 days and between one and five fully furred young are born. Fawn hopping mice live in small family groups of two to four individuals. During the day, they shelter in burrows which are simpler and shallower than those of the sand-dwelling dusky hopping mouse but nevertheless up to a metre deep with between one and three entrances. At night, they forage outwards for hundreds of metres, searching for seeds, and also taking green shoots and insects if the opportunity presents itself. As with other hopping mice, they do not need to drink, though they can metabolise highly saline water if it is available. The fawn hopping mouse is classified as vulnerable. The causes of its decline are unknown, but assumed to be habitat degradation, competition for food with introduced species, and predation by introduced cats and foxes.

It aired on November 7, 2011. Plot Barney has grown tired of his Ducky Tie and makes up a story in order to hide the fact that he has thrown it away, but he is foiled when Lily enters the bar holding the tie after having found it in the garbage. When entering MacLaren's bar, Kevin notices a sign at the entrance which read \\"Absolutely no boogie boarding\\", and asks about it. The group tells him what happened to them during Hurricane Irene. Ted had planned to have his friends ride out the hurricane in his house out of the city, but Barney convinced them to stay in his city apartment, saying that the storm was nothing to worry about. Marshall had no health insurance during this time because of his unemployment. He saw death everywhere and refused to go alone anywhere without Lily because he feared he could be attacked by a bear. Lily and Barney eventually got calls from their parents asking if they were all right, and Robin grew jealous because her father had not called her. When she denied that she felt neglected, Barney fake-called Robin as her dad to prove her jealousy. When the group did decide to evacuate to Ted's house, Ted told Barney that he could not come with them, as Ted found a girl in the hallway who he said could ride in Barney's place. This alteration caused altercations; everyone fought over who got to go or stay, especially as Lily complained that Marshall was not giving her enough alone time and that all she wanted to do is sit in the bath and read a book, until Ted finally decided to go by himself. Marshall turned on the TV just in time to call Ted back to hear Mayor Bloomberg's speech saying that the evacuation time had passed and that everyone must go inside and wait out the storm. Later that night, Marshall ran Lily a bath and told her to have a little alone time. Out of gratitude, Lily kissed him passionately and they ended up conceiving their baby boy in Barney's bathroom. Meanwhile, in the present, Barney offers to let Marshall deliver his final remaining slap in their Slap Bet in return for being allowed to take the Ducky Tie off. Marshall is torn between slapping Barney and forcing him to continue wearing the tie until Kevin points out that since Barney had not complained about the Ducky Tie in weeks, there must be an agenda to Barney's offer. Kevin hypothesizes that he has to impress someone and deduces that Barney is going to meet Nora's parents, which Barney reveals happens in two days. Lily and Marshall agree that Barney can take off the tie, but he must gain an extra three slaps to his already existing final slap. Barney agrees and Marshall delivers two of the slaps, with two still remaining. In the end, it is shown that the gang had gone out after the end of the hurricane and played around in the rain, which led to Marshall going boogie-boarding and eventually crashing through MacLaren's front window ‚Äì hence the sign against boogie-boarding. Robin and Barney decide to share a cab home and they reminisce about the moment after Marshall's accident when they had almost kissed but Robin's dad had called her. They make fun of what could have happened and end up kissing in the cab. Critical response The A.V. Club's Donna Bowman graded the episode an A‚àí, stating that it had several of the same elements that made the Ducky Tie a wonderful episode: \\"constantly interrupted storytelling, callbackariffic structuring, fleet pacing, machine- gun dialogue, and a dollop of sweetness at the end.\\" Angel Cohn of Television Without Pity gave the episode a B+.

In the episode, the Fringe team of the alternate timeline deal with the ramifications of Peter Bishop's return. The episode was co-written by J.R. Orci and Graham Roland, while Paul Holahan served as the director. It first aired on November 4, 2011 in the United States to an estimated 3.28 million viewers. Plot Olivia (Anna Torv) and the others of Fringe division attempt to determine the origin of Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), who purports to be Walter's (John Noble) son who had died as a young boy in the original timeline. Peter refuses to speak to anyone but Walter, yet Walter is very reluctant to accept Peter's story. Peter is held at Fringe headquarters in secure facilities. The Fringe division is brought to investigate the violent murders of a woman and her live-in boyfriend in her home. They find that she was earlier married to Dr. Malcolm Truss (Arye Gross), a former Massive Dynamic biochemical researcher, and believe her murder was an attempt to access his aborted research on cell cloning by one of the new shapeshifters, Nadine (Michelle Krusiec) (previously seen in \\"Neither Here Nor There\\"). While at Massive Dynamic, it is revealed that Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) raised Olivia and her sister Rachel after Olivia killed her stepfather and ran away from Walter's Cortexiphan trials; Walter resents Nina for both this and for her interference that led to young Peter's death. The Fringe team is unable to locate Truss before Nadine does, and begins a manhunt to track him down. Meanwhile, Nadine has tried to convince Truss that she is a patient in need of his cloning research, and coerces him to take her to a secret laboratory to synthesize the cure. It's revealed she has a daughter, Haley. As Fringe division attempts to work out Truss's location, Peter, from inside his cell, uses the intercom electronics to try to convince Olivia and the others that he knows about shapeshifter technology. Under guard, Peter is able to use one of the memory discs previously recovered by the Fringe team to identify a tracking signal, leading the team to Truss's laboratory. Truss has come to discover Nadine's truth after she temporarily loses control and takes the form of his deceased wife, but under threat of death, continues to synthesize the cure. Truss finishes the cure just as the FBI and Fringe agents surround the warehouse containing the lab. After being given the cure, Nadine attempts to fight off the agents, but appears to have dived into the water below. After recovering a body from the water, they realize that Nadine had taken the place of a fallen agent and had escaped their grasp. Nadine uses a Hermes 3000 typewriter stored in a locker at a Boston train station to type a report informing them of the success of Truss's cure; moments later, the typewriter, on its own, types out further instructions for her. Walter, after trying to resolve his issues with Peter, returns to Fringe headquarters to inform Peter that because he had two chances to save his son and let him down both times, he will not try to help again for fear of doing more harm. Meanwhile, Olivia experiences an unexplained time fluctuation. Production The episode was co-written by consulting producer J.R. Orci and co-producer Graham Roland, while Paul Holahan marked his second directing credit for the series (his first being the second season episode \\"Snakehead\\"). \\"Novation\\" marked the first episode of the season to feature Peter Bishop's (played by main cast member Joshua Jackson) return. The actor joked that the first three season episodes \\"gave me an extra month and half off. But I thought it was necessary. You need to give space to explore the effect Peter‚Äôs choice had. Otherwise, you make last season cliffhanger finale ‚Äì which I thought was big, ballsy thing to do ‚Äì not all that important.\\" Reception =Ratings= The Fringe episode was initially meant to air on October 28, 2011, but was delayed until November 4 due to Game 7 of the 2011 World Series. The Fox network produced a video using Fringe episode clips to mock the week delay. \\"Novation\\" had 3.28 million viewers, up a tenth with adults 18-49 to a 1.3 rating from the previous episode. Among the night's three science fiction genre shows, Fringe place second in the 18-49 demographic behind NBC's Grimm but ahead of The CW's Supernatural. =Reviews= Entertainment Weekly writer Jeff Jensen praised Noble and Jackson's performances, explaining \\"The reunion of the Bishop boys was a great, well acted scene. Walter, unable to even look at Peter; Peter, his face full of warmth and grace for his damaged father. Poignant. I am amazed by how this cast is always able to find the emotion in the material they‚Äôre given, no matter how gonzo-heady.\\" Jensen continued, \\"I also like how Peter represents us, the fan, in the show itself. He embodies our conflicted feelings about the new timeline; he keeps the memory of the old continuity alive.\\" The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded the episode with a B+; he wrote, \\"'Novation' isn‚Äôt exactly a powerhouse; it‚Äôs more explanatory and less sensational, designed to explore the immediate ramifications of Peter‚Äôs inconvenient reappearance, and to set up some of what‚Äôs to come... [The episode] is more sinew and bone than muscle... But it‚Äôs well-structured sinew and bone, I‚Äôd say.\\" IGN contributor Ramsey Isler rated \\"Novation\\" 8.0/10, explaining \\"With Joshua Jackson back in the forefront of Fringe, it feels like the show is finally whole again... suddenly the show once again has solid direction.\\" He continued, \\"'Novation' is a solid episode. It may not be the game-changing, mind-exploding episode many fans were hoping for but it's entertaining nonetheless, and it moves things forward nicely.\\" Jensen was also slightly critical of the episode, believing that the Nadine Park/Malcolm Truss relationship was not \\"all that compelling.\\" Murray agreed, writing that \\"The scenes between Malcolm and Nadine are much quieter and more complex than the typical Fringe freak interactions. (They‚Äôre also a little wooden, unfortunately, due to the performance of the actress playing Nadine.)\\" Isler was also critical of guest actress Michelle Krusiec's delivery; he noted the performance was \\"really bland in many spots and she never really achieve a convincing 'femme fatale' vibe.\\" Isler had other critiques of the episode, explaining \\"Some of the writing/direction is a little bit off too, and I saw the shapeshifter switcharoo coming a mile away. These aren't major flaws, but they do detract a tiny bit from the story.\\" References External links * \\"Novation\\" at Fox.com * * Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Fringe (season 4) episodes ","title":"Novation (Fringe)"},{"id":"33642782","text":"William V.

They agree to try to keep it a secret, but this will prove difficult as they are attending a cruise party with their significant others, Kevin and Nora. They realize that they cannot keep it a secret, and believing this is the way they are meant to reconcile, decide to tell Kevin and Nora they cheated on them. After several failed attempts on the boat, Barney and Robin agree to tell Nora and Kevin respectively after they return to shore. Meanwhile, Ted, Lily, and Marshall attend a concert, where Ted insists that he and Marshall consume some \\"sandwiches\\" (a euphemism that Future Ted uses to refer to marijuana) to enjoy the concert. Marshall reluctantly agrees, though he believes that he must become more responsible because he will be a father soon, while Ted fears that life is moving too quickly and they will not be able to enjoy all the things they wanted to in the past. While they are high, Ted and Marshall leave their seats to find some nachos for Lily. Walking around the entire arena twice, also inadvertently standing in line for the women's restroom many times, they become frustrated with one another and set off on their own. They are met by a mysterious guitarist, who guides them back together and presents them with nachos. Though disappointed that they have missed the concert, Ted and Marshall conclude that time will go on whether they are ready or not. When Lily finds them, she informs them that rather being gone for several hours, they were only gone for two minutes. As captured by a security camera, Ted and Marshall actually stayed in the same section of the arena, the guitarist was really a life-size cardboard cutout, and Ted actually pulled the nachos out of a trash can. They return to the concert, but decide to leave after ten minutes. Kevin winds up in the hospital after a drink is thrown in his face. Robin tries to use the scene to tell Kevin she wants to break up with him in order to return to Barney, but Kevin first tells Robin that he loves her and accepts anything that she may do wrong. Barney, though at first obstructed by the unexpected arrival of Nora's parents, tells Nora the truth and when he admits that it meant something to him, they break up. Barney waits at the bar for Robin, and when Ted, Marshall and Lily walk in, he informs them he broke up with Nora, and says the hard part is over. Robin arrives at the bar with Kevin, unable to bring herself to tell him. This leaves Barney heartbroken and he excuses himself, not wanting to stick around. Ted leaves the bar soon after, as he is still high. As Ted gets back to his apartment, he sees Barney picking up rose petals off Robin's bed and blowing out the flames of candles, implying he had a special night planned. Ted walks to his room without saying anything. Critical response Donna Bowman from The A.V. Club graded the episode a B+, stating that Barney trying to accept the reality that he still pines for Robin is one of the episode's defining moments, even if the price was losing Nora. IGN rated the episode with an 8/10. Pastes Adam Vitcavage gave the episode a 9.2 and praised the final moments of the episode, saying that Neil Patrick Harris' acting was taken to a higher level, and applauding the writers.

A condaghe (also spelled as condache or condake, ; also fundaghe), from the medieval Sardinian term (from ), was a kind of administrative document used in the Sardinian judicates between the 11th and 13th centuries. They are one of the earliest witnesses for the development of the Sardinian language and are an important source for historians of medieval Sardinia. The original condaghes (later italianized into condaghi) were collections of acts of donations to churches or monasteries. Later condaghes were kept by noble families for recording inheritances, purchases, donations (datura), transactions (tramutu) and litigation (kertu), principally when relating to the church. The chief object of such records was to provide precise dates in case of legal dispute. Physically, the first condaghes were scrolls: overlapping parchment manuscripts wound tightly around a kont√°kion. Over time they took on the familiar form of a codex (like modern books). They were produced in the scriptoria of monasteries and cathedrals, but the great majority have been lost.

The Yemeni revolution was a series of major protests, political tensions, and armed clashes taking place in Yemen, which began in January 2011 and were influenced by concurrent protests in the region. Hundreds of protesters, members of armed groups, army soldiers and security personnel were killed, and many more injured, in the largest protests to take place in the South Arabian country for decades. With President Ali Abdullah Saleh's sudden return to Yemen, clashes between government loyalists and defected security forces became increasingly frequent, while the Gulf Co- operation Council attempted to revive a peace agreement thought dead since May. During this phase in the uprising, violence continued between pro- and anti-Saleh factions, especially in the capital Sana'a and second city Ta'izz. Meanwhile, Saleh signed a GCC peace initiative endorsed by the United Nations Security Council on 23 November, agreeing to relinquish power by 23 December in favor of a transitional government headed by Abd al-Rab Mansour al-Hadi, the vice president, while remaining president until new elections in February 2012. Timeline =June‚ÄìSeptember= =23 September ‚Äì \\"Friday of the Million Man March\\"= Saleh reportedly returned to Yemen by plane, despite earlier reports that Saudi Arabia would prevent him from leaving the country. Almost a million came out in Sana'a for an anti-government rally, the largest such protest in Sana'a in the entire uprising. =24 September= Less than a day after Saleh's return to Yemen, pro-government forces reportedly attacked the protest camp in Change Square. At least one person was killed, a civilian torn apart by a mortar shell. Saleh also gave his first public address since his return, reaffirming his support for the GCC plan to transfer power without giving any specific timeline. =October= Territory and areas of influence for rebels (blue) and Islamists (red) in Yemen's uprising, as of 23 October 2011. 4 October Security forces shelled residential areas in Ta'izz, killing seven and leaving 22 injured. Two civilians were killed by shelling in Sana'a, in the crossfire between loyalist and dissident troops, and six more were injured in the fighting. Tens of thousands of protesters turned out to criticise Saleh and the United Nations for failing to negotiate an end to the crisis. The Yemeni opposition declared that due to the violence used against protesters, \\"The dialogue with the regime has stopped.\\" 7 October ‚Äì Friday of al-Hamdi Massive anti-government protests spread across Yemen on Friday as demonstrators called for the departure of the country's embattled president and his allies. Activists dubbed the day \\"the Friday of al-Hamdi,\\" a reference to Ibrahim al-Hamdi, a popular former president of North Yemen who was slain in 1977. North and South Yemen merged into the Republic of Yemen in 1990. The estimated number of protesters across the country totaled three million, with 800,000 alone in the capital of Sana'a, according to a count of numbers from eyewitnesses. That count could not be verified independently. People in the south as well as the north hailed al-Hamdi and called for President Ali Abdullah Saleh to leave government.http://ripley.za.net/news/'friday-of-al- hamdi'-protests-in-yemen/ 14 October ‚Äì Friday of Victory for Yemen and Syria Demonstrators on Friday called for the United Nations to intervene to put Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh on trial in the wake of a crackdown on anti-regime protests that has cost hundreds of lives. \\"We want the world to pass a resolution which defends the blood of the revolutionaries,\\" protesters chanted at a huge gathering near \\"Change Square\\" in central Sana'a that has become the epicenter of a campaign to oust Saleh. The demonstrators, who protest organizers said numbered in the hundreds of thousands, called for the veteran leader to go on trial. \\"There will be no immunity... Saleh and his cronies must face trial,\\" chanted the protesters, gathered after weekly Muslim prayers as on every Friday since the outbreak of their campaign in late January. 15 October Yemeni security forces opened fire on thousands of protesters in Sana'a as they marched toward the city centre from Change Square, killing at least 64 people and wounding several dozen. The same day, The Siege of Dammaj began. 21 October The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously, 15‚Äì0, for a resolution condemning the violence and calling on Saleh to transfer power immediately under the GCC plan, which would secure amnesty for him and his family. The amnesty provision was opposed by many Yemeni protesters, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Tawakul Karman. 22 October At least 10 people were killed in fighting between Yemeni government forces and opposition fighters in the capital Sana'a on Saturday, residents and witnesses said. The Yemeni government said it was ready to \\"deal positively\\" with a resolution approved by the U.N. Security Council on Friday that urged President Ali Abdullah Saleh to sign a deal requiring him to step down in exchange for immunity. 25 October Three civilian were reportedly killed, two by the use of live fire on a protest march and one by shelling, in Sana'a. The government reported three security personnel dead in Ta'izz, while the opposition claimed eight civilians in the second city were killed and 30 more wounded. Saleh's government and General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar signed a deal for a ceasefire after several days of fighting, but clashes continued and media reported the truce had failed. The Interior Ministry reported a fourth police officer died in Ta'izz by the end of the day. Meanwhile, Saleh claimed in talks with the United States' ambassador to Yemen that he was committed to the GCC deal and ready to relinquish power. In southern Yemen, an Antonov military cargo plane carrying 15 members of the Syrian and Yemeni armed services crashed near al-Anad Airbase in Lahij Governorate, killing three Syrians and one Yemeni on impact, AFP reported. 26 October Egyptian daily Akhbar El Yom reported that the previous day's crash was a deliberate act by the aircraft's Yemeni pilot to prevent Syrian Air Force personnel aboard from being delivered on loan from their home country in order to bomb protesters on behalf of the Yemeni government. According to the article, the pilot's co-workers confirmed the plan was premeditated and the Syrian on board were not technicians as previously claimed, but MiG pilots. Elsewhere in Yemen, overnight fighting in Sana'a and Ta'izz left 25 dead, including at least nine soldiers and at least seven tribal fighters in the capital alone. Several hundred Yemeni women organised a veil-burning in protest later in the day, blocking a main street in Sana'a and handing out leaflets asking for protection as the coverings burned. 30 October The General People's Congress announced that it would nominate Vice President Abd al-Rab Mansur al-Hadi to stand in proposed presidential elections once the GCC deal is signed. =November= 2 November Foreign Minister Abu Bakr al-Qerbi said the government and opposition were working toward a deal for implementing the GCC agreement, which a European Union envoy credited to United Nations Security Council Resolution 2014. The New York Times ran a feature story on Ta'izz alleging that regime insiders feared Yemen's second city could go the way of Libya's, where Benghazi became a secure headquarters for rebels to wage a successful civil war against Muammar Gaddafi and his supporters earlier in the year. Governor Hamoud al- Sofi, the highest-ranking official in Ta'izz Governorate, was quoted as describing the situation as \\"a war, from all senses of the meaning\\". Seven civilians were killed as the Yemen Army shelled residential neighbourhoods in retaliation for local fighters' takeover of a government building. Five soldiers were reported dead as well, apparently killed by armed anti- government tribesmen. 4 November Protesters held massive Friday demonstrations against Saleh in Ta'izz, as well as in 16 other governorates, with violence erupting once again in the city. 9 November Houthi rebels defeated pro-government Kashir and Aahm tribes and seized control of the Kuhlan Ash Sharaf District, advancing towards the port of Midi and the capital of Sana'a. 11 November ‚Äì Friday of No Amnesty for the Murderers At least 17 civilians have been killed and 32 injured from artillery shelling by Yemeni forces in the Yemeni city of Taiz, a day after a UN envoy began a new mission to push President Ali Abdullah Saleh to resign under a Gulf-backed peace plan. Tens of thousands launched protests against Saleh in Saleh, demanding Saleh to be put on trial for crimes against humanity. 13 November Yemeni army and tribal fighters killed 9 suspected Al-Qaeda militants in fighting in Zinjibar. 15 November President Ali Abdullah Saleh says he will resign within 90 days based on an agreement with Gulf Cooperation Council. 19 November ‚Äì Friday of the Female Martyrs of the Revolution Hundreds of thousands of people in Sana'a and throughout the country protested against Saleh, calling for Saleh to be tried for crimes against humanity. The protesters vowed punishment against Saleh's government for the killing of protesters, especially for the killing of women and children. 20 November At least 400 soldiers defected from Yemeni Army, some were apparently members of the Republican Guard. 22 November The United Nations envoy to Yemen said at a press conference in Sana'a, \\"All the parties have agreed to implement the Gulf Co-operation Council initiative.\\" 23 November Saleh arrived in Saudi Arabia to attend the GCC deal's signing, Yemeni state television reported. Saleh signed the agreement and gave a brief speech in which he referred to the uprising as a \\"coup\\" and described the assassination attempt that left him incapacitated for much of the summer as \\"a scandal\\". Ban Ki-moon, the secretary-general of the United Nations, said he had received word from Saleh that after the signing ceremony, the outgoing president planned to fly to New York City for medical treatment. 25 November To mark the Islamic New Year, Saleh sent a message to the Yemeni military and police justifying his signature of the GCC agreement, Yemeni state news reported. According to the report, Saleh said he wanted to avoid \\"destruction, bloodshed and the slide into chaos\\". 26 November Despite Ban's assurances Saleh would fly to the United States, the president instead returned to Yemen. Opposition leader Yassin Saeed Noman said that while he did not object to Saleh returning to the country, he did not believe Saleh's continued activity and prominence after signing an agreement that legally reduced him to a symbolic figurehead was appropriate. 28 November At least 25 people are killed in fighting between Sunni and Shia groups. =December= 3 December 7 people were killed in clashes in Ta'izz. 4 December A ceasefire agreement was reached in Ta'izz, but fighting continued despite the truce. 6 December A spokeswoman for UNICEF said 3 children were killed and 7 wounded in the latest outbreak of violence in Ta'izz. The UN said more than 20 people had been killed and at least 80 had been injured in Yemen so far during the month as a result of fighting. 7 December Mohammed Basindawa, Hadi's prime minister-designate, announced names for a national unity government to be composed of Saleh loyalists and opposition members in equal measure. Hadi issued a decree to establish the government in the afternoon. Meanwhile, sporadic fighting between troops loyal to Saleh and army defectors and militants opposed to his rule continued in Ta'izz and Sana'a. At least one opposition tribal fighter was killed and 12 injured 11 December Hundreds of thousands in Sana'a protest calling for the trial of Ali Abdullah Saleh. 12 December At least 15 Al Qaeda convicts escaped from a prison in Aden using a tunnel to go under the wall. 13 December Al Qaeda fighters fired on a Yemeni military vehicle killing 3 soldiers and wounding 11 others near the southern city of Zinjibar. Yemeni police arrested 6 Al Qaeda members while allegedly planning attacks on senior government officials. 16 December Hundreds of thousands of Yemenis demonstrated Friday across the country rejecting an amnesty given to President Ali Abdullah Saleh against prosecution in a deal that eases him out of office. \\"A trial is a must and amnesty is rejected,\\" chanted demonstrators in Sana'a's Sitin Street, close to Change Square‚Äîthe focal point of protests that broke out in January demanding Saleh's departure after 33 years in power. Similar demonstrations were staged in 18 cities and towns across Yemen in response to a call by the central organising committee of protests, as protesters insisted Saleh and his top lieutenants should face justice over the killing of demonstrators.http://english.ahram.org.eg/~/NewsContent/2/8/29509/World/Region/Yemenis- protest-against-amnesty-for-Saleh-.aspx 20 December Fighting between suspected Al-Qaeda militants and Yemeni troops in Yemen's restive Abyan province have killed 2 soldiers and 13 Islamists, military officials said on Tuesday. 21 December A Yemeni military official says a battle against al-Qaeda-linked fighters in the south has killed 10 of the militants and 5 Yemeni soldiers. The fighting took place overnight outside the city of Zinjibar, which remains under the partial control of Islamic militants who seized the city in May. 24 December A protest organiser said that Saleh loyalists, including elite troops, attacked a group of more than 100,000 demonstrators calling for the leader's trial as they entered Sana'a on their march north from Ta'izz, killing at least nine. United States Ambassador Gerald M. Feierstein defended the Yemeni government's reaction to the demonstration, saying the protest march was intended \\"to generate chaos and provoke a violent response by the security forces\\" and claiming the U.S. government would have acted similarly if thousands of people marched on the White House in Washington, D.C. 25 December As Vice President Abd al- Rab Mansur al-Hadi met with Ambassador Feierstein at his office, tens of thousands of Yemenis marched past chanting slogans demanding justice for protesters killed on the march from Ta'izz to Sana'a and denouncing Hadi as Saleh's puppet. On Facebook, Tawakul Karman, the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and leader of the opposition Al-Islah party, condemned Feierstein's statement the previous day and demanded the ambassador apologise. Several Houthi youth leaders demanded that Feierstein leave Yemen altogether over his remarks. 26 December The New York Times reported that the Obama administration in the U.S. had decided to admit Saleh to the country for medical treatment by the end of the week, to stay at least through elections in February 2012. Unnamed officials quoted in the Times' report said the administration had decided it was best to keep Saleh out of Yemen during the planned political transition, even if it came at the cost of the United States' image among Yemenis who might view the move as granting political asylum to the embattled president. 31 December The General People's Congress announced that Saleh had decided to remain in Yemen through the elections instead of leaving the country as previously planned. At least one party figure blamed the opposition for changing the situation, accusing anti- government activists of sowing disruption and provoking violence. Other officials, speaking anonymously, said the Republican Guard, under the leadership of Saleh's son Ahmed Ali Saleh, and Central Security, under the leadership of the Saleh's nephew Yahya Mohamed Abdullah Saleh, had launched a new crackdown against dissenters in their own ranks. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets to call for the president's trial and execution over his government's violent response to the protests, marching in Sana'a and other major Yemeni cities. =January‚ÄìFebruary 2012= References External links *Yemen's Uprising ongoing coverage at Al Jazeera English *Yemen unrest ‚Äì live coverage at The Guardian *Yemen Real Time Video Stream at Frequency *Crowd-sourcing resource for the Yemen uprising, at CrowdVoice.org *Yemen Peace Project *AEI's Critical Threats Project on Yemen Protests *Yemen at the International Crisis Group Revolution Category:Timelines of the Yemeni Revolution ","title":"Timeline of the Yemeni Revolution (23 September ‚Äì December 2011)"},{"id":"33642910","text":"Reuben May (June 23, 1815September 26, 1902) was a Union Army colonel from Kentucky in the American Civil War.

Erduran was born on November 4, 1932 in Larnaca, Cyprus and died on August 5, 2011 in Bristol, England. He represented the Turkish Cypriot community on the Fulbright Commission and worked closely with other international agencies including the British Council and the Goethe Institute. Early life The early influence on Erduran‚Äôs teaching philosophy was his father Hasan Nihat, a well-respected teacher and leader whose fellow villagers dedicated a street in his name in northern Cyprus 60 years after his death. An obituary of Hasan Nihat was written by Talat Yurdakul and published in the Halkƒ±n Sesi newspaper on 17 August 1948. Education Erduran was trained at Morphou Teachers' College, and subsequently taught in several village schools in Cyprus, including at Sinde and K√º√ß√ºk Kaymaklƒ±. He was one of the first Cypriot teachers to be granted a scholarship to study in the UK, where he completed a Diploma in Teaching English as a foreign language at the University of Wales, Cardiff in 1962. Teaching career Following his return to Cyprus, Erduran moved onto secondary school teaching at several schools including Nicosia Girls‚Äô School where he taught for almost 20 years. Apart from Primary and Secondary School Teaching, Erduran‚Äôs career included Director of In-Service Teacher Training and Instructor at Anadolu Open University campus in Northern Cyprus. He was a visiting teacher at George Mason University, USA and was one of the founding members of the Eastern Mediterranean University, the very first university of the Turkish Cypriot community. Following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, he helped establish a new secondary school in Lapithos and served as its first head-teacher. Throughout his career, Erduran made numerous visits to schools in the United Kingdom, USA and Turkey. Erduran was an effective teacher who made a significant impact not only on the practice and policy of education but also on the intellectual discourse on education in Cyprus. He was a proponent of interdisciplinary and holistic teaching. In 1954, he said: :\\"Teachers, above all, are responsible for raising the cultural capital of the societies that they live in. In order to nurture literate and constructive generations, teachers need awareness of not only their subject knowledge but also other subjects to broaden their vision. Academic knowledge is necessary but not sufficient as a strong cultural foundation of youngsters\\". Francis Bacon‚Äôs essay ‚ÄúOf Studies‚Äù best captured Erduran‚Äôs passion for pedagogy and English literature: ‚ÄúStudies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability‚Äù influenced his teaching philosophy in differentiating the purposes of education. He believed in everyone‚Äôs potential to learn, and took it upon himself as a teacher and an administrator to find creative ways of facilitating learning. He had a rare talent for transforming complex ideas into simple, striking and animated narrative. Literature and journalism Erduran was also a known figure in Turkish Cypriot literature and journalism. He contributed regularly to the Ideas and Arts Magazine ‚Äú√áardak‚Äù where he published short stories. His prose was existential in nature, and was influenced by international literature and philosophy including the work of Bertrand Russell, Albert Camus and Knut Hamsun. He published numerous articles in the Turkish Cypriot newspaper \\"Nacak.\\" His prose had an existential tone, questioning the absurdity of life and the alienation of humanity, often drawing on metaphors from the natural world to symbolise aspects of the human condition. In an interview he reported: :\\"I must have believed that everything in life, apart from the earth, is rotten, and everything is lacking of something. It must be so because the smell of soil has never been missing in my stories\\". The existential undertone of his writing was uniquely positioned in reference to education where he saw it as the responsibility of teachers and society at large to help the public understand and come to terms with humanity‚Äôs place in the world. Education in this sense was a vehicle to promote clarity of reason in understanding the existential condition of humanity. In his article ‚ÄúTo Make Live,‚Äù he took issue with ignorance particularly in reference to the role of reading in the Turkish Cypriot community describing it as a ‚Äúdeep wound of its cultural life‚Äù Nevertheless, he was hopeful that the contributions made within the community would yield to the advancement of the indigenous literature to the point of serious competition with the mainland Turkish literature. His stories were full of lyrical use of the Turkish language through simple yet deep and powerful metaphors. His inspiration for writing came to fruition when he would \\"lock (his) observations in (his) mind and wait for (his) characters to riot against them. Then and only then (he) would feel the necessity to weave the plot onto paper\\". Later life One of Erduran‚Äôs passions in life was swimming. During British colonial rule, he competed in the swimming championships involving Greek and Turkish Cypriots as well as the British expatriates, having won numerous competitions. Ayten Erduran, his wife of 50 years died in London in 2003. He is survived by his daughter Sibel Erduran, Professor of STEM Education at University of Limerick, Ireland; son Nihat Erol Erduran, Mental Health Manager at the National Health Service, London. His obituary has appeared in the Times Higher Education Magazine (25 August 2011), The Times (17 August 2011) and Cyprus Mail (14 August 2011).

It is an adaptable shrub, grown in many parts of Australia for its attractive foliage but is regarded as an environmental weed in parts of Victoria. Description Melaleuca decussata is a densely branched shrub growing to a height and width of . The leaves are arranged in alternating pairs at right angles to the ones above and below so that the leaves are in 4 rows along the stems (decussate). The leaves are long, wide, linear, narrow elliptic or narrow egg-shaped tapering to a point and concave in cross section. They also have prominent oil glands on their lower surface. The flowers are a shade of pink or purple but fade rapidly to white. They are arranged in spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and on the sides of the branches. The spikes are up to in diameter, long and have between 6 and 22 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower ages. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers with 12 to 26 stamens in each bundle. The flowering season is from August to May but flowers mostly appear from November to February in the species' native range. The fruit which follow are woody capsules, characteristically fused together at their bases and sunken in the stem. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca decussata was first formally described by Robert Brown in 1812 in the second edition of Hortus Kewensis from material collected from the southern coastal region of Australia. The specific epithet (decussata) refers to the decussate arrangement of the leaves. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca decussata occurs between coastal areas of South Australia (including the Eyre Peninsula) and the centre of eastern Victoria. M. decussata fruit sunken in stem Conservation status This species has been declared an environmental weed in the Geelong area, the catchments of the Broken and Goulburn rivers and in the Wimmera bioregion. It is a garden escape which becomes naturalised in grasslands and grassy woodland. It is believed to be a threat to several natural vegetation associations and forms dense stands in native pastures. It grows in low nutrient soils subject to inundation. Use in horticulture Melaleuca decussata is a hardy garden plant with attractive foliage. It will grow in most situations and has attractive mauve- coloured flowers, although they fade quickly to white. It is not advisable to plant this species within of a wastewater pipe because of its potential to cause damage.

Scotland, England, and Wales shared a monarch from 1601 but their economies were run separately until they were unified in the 1707 Act of Union.Clive Lee, Scotland and the United Kingdom: The Economy and the Union in the Twentieth Century(1996) Ireland was incorporated in the United Kingdom economy between 1800 and 1920; from 1921 the Irish Free State (the modern Republic of Ireland) became independent and set its own economic policy. Great Britain, and England in particular, became one of the most prosperous economic regions in Europe between 1600 and 1700, Industrialisation in the UK from the mid-eighteenth century resulted in economic developments described by many historians as the British industrial revolution. These developments resulted in Britain becoming one of the premier economies in Europe during the first half of the 19th century, the most prominent industrial power in the world economy, and a major political power. Its industrialists were major innovators in machinery such as steam engines (for pumps, factories, railway locomotives and steamships), textile equipment, and tool-making. Britons pioneered the railway system, and built many systems and manufactured most of the equipment other nations used. Its businessmen were leaders in international commerce and banking, trade and shipping. Its markets included both areas that were independent and those that were part of the expanding British Empire. After 1840, an economic policy of mercantilism was abandoned and replaced by free trade, with few tariffs, quotas or restrictions. The powerful Royal Navy protected British commercial interests, shipping and international trade, while the British legal system provided a system for resolving disputes relatively inexpensively, and the City of London functioned as the economic capital and focus of the world economy. Between 1870 and 1900, economic output per head of the United Kingdom rose by 50 percent (from about ¬£28 per capita to ¬£41 in 1900: an annual average increase in real incomes of 1% p.a.), growth which was associated with a significant rise in living standards.Charles H. Feinstein (1972) National Income, Expenditure and Output of the United Kingdom. 1855-1955. Studies in the National Income and Expenditure of the United Kingdom, 6. Cambridge University Press; Table 1: Factor incomes in the grow national product, 1855-1965; Table 55: Mid-year home population of Great Britain and Ireland, 1855-1965; Table 61: Price indices for main categories of goods and services Factor incomes in the grow national product, 1855-1965. pp.T.4-5, T.120-121, T.132. However, and despite this significant economic growth, some economic historians have suggested that Britain experienced a relative economic decline in the last third of the nineteenth century as industrial expansion occurred in the United States and Germany. In 1870, Britain's output per head was the second highest in the world, surpassed only by Australia. In 1914, British income per capita was the world's third highest, exceeded only by New Zealand and Australia; these three countries shared a common economic, social and cultural heritage. In 1950, British output per head was still 30 percent over that of the average of the six founder members of the EEC, but within 20 years it had been overtaken by the majority of western European economies. Lee, Clive. The British economy since 1700: a macroeconomic perspective (1986) The response of successive British governments to this problematic performance was to seek economic growth stimuli within what became the European Union; Britain entered the European Community in 1973. Thereafter the United Kingdom's relative economic performance improved substantially to the extent that, on the eve of the 2007 financial crisis, British income per capita exceeded, albeit marginally, that of France and Germany; furthermore, there was a significant reduction in the gap in income per capita terms between the UK and USA. 16th‚Äì17th centuries Ancient coat of arms of the Tudor family. During 16th and 17th century many fundamental economic changes occurred, these resulted in rising incomes and paved the way to the industrialisation. After 1600, the North Sea region took over the role of the leading economic centre of Europe from the Mediterranean, which prior to this date, particularly in northern Italy, had been the most highly developed part of Europe. Great Britain, together with the Low Countries, profited more in the long run from the expansion of trade in the Atlantic and Asia than the pioneers of this trade, Spain and Portugal, fundamentally because of the success of the mainly privately owned enterprises in these two Northern countries in contrast to the arguably less successful state-owned economic systems in Iberia. Following the Black Death in the mid 14th century, and the agricultural depression of the late 15th century, the population began to increase. The export of woollen products resulted in an economic upturn with products exported to mainland Europe. Henry VII negotiated the favourable Intercursus Magnus treaty in 1496.David M. Palliser, The Age of Elizabeth: England under the later Tudors, 1547-1603 p. 300. The high wages and abundance of available land seen in the late 15th century and early 16th century were temporary. When the population recovered, low wages and a land shortage returned. Historians in the early 20th century characterized the economic in terms of general decline, manorial reorganization, and agricultural contraction. Later historians dropped those themes and stressed the transitions between medieval forms and Tudor progress.Michael Postan, \\"Revisions in Economic History. IX.‚ÄîThe Fifteenth Century.\\" Economic History Review (1939) 9#2 : 160-167. in JSTOR John Leland left rich descriptions of the local economies he witnessed during his travels 1531 to 1560. He described markets, ports, industries, buildings and transport links. He showed some small towns were expanding, through new commercial and industrial opportunities, especially cloth manufacture. He found other towns in decline, and suggested that investment by entrepreneurs and benefactors had enabled some small towns to prosper.John S. Lee, \\"The functions and fortunes of English small towns at the close of the middle ages: evidence from John Leland's Itinerary.\\" Urban History 37#1 (2010): 3-25. Taxation was a negative factor in economic growth, since it was imposed, not on consumption, but on capital investments.Richard W. Hoyle, \\"Taxation and the mid-Tudor crisis.\\" Economic History Review 51#4 (1998): 649-975. in JSTOR According to Derek Hirst, outside of politics and religion, the 1640s and 1650s saw a revived economy characterized by growth in manufacturing, the elaboration of financial and credit instruments, and the commercialization Of communication. The gentry found time for leisure activities, such as horse racing and bowling. In the high culture important innovations included the development of a mass market for music, increased scientific research, and an expansion of publishing. All the trends were discussed in depth at the newly established coffee houses.Derek Hirst, \\"Locating the 1650s in England's seventeenth century\\" History (1996) 81#263 pp 359-83 online =Growth in money supply= Spanish and Portuguese colonies in the New World exported large quantities of silver and gold to Europe, some of which added to the English money supply. There were multiple results that all expanded the English economy, according to Dr. Nuno Palma of the University of Manchester. The key features of the growth pattern included specialisation and structural change, and increases in market participation. The new supply of specie (silver and gold) increased the money supply. Instead of promissory notes paid off by future promissory notes, business transactions were supported by specie. This reduced transaction costs, increased the coverage of the market, and opened incentives and opportunities to participate in cash transaction. Demand arose for luxury goods from Asia, such as silk and pepper, which created new markets. The increased supply of specie made tax collection easier, allowing the government to build up fiscal capacity and provide for public goods.N. Palma, \\"Money and modernization in early modern England\\" Financial History Review (2019), preprint EHES Working Paper No. 147, February 2019, online Various inflationary pressures existed; some were due to an influx of New World gold and a rising population. Inflation had a negative effect on the real wealth of most families.J. R. Wordie, \\"Deflationary factors in the Tudor price rise.\\" Past & Present 154 (1997): 32-70. It set the stage for social upheaval as the gap between the rich and poor widening. This was a period of significant change for the majority of the rural population, with manorial land owners introducing enclosure measures.Ian Dawson, The Tudor century (1993) p. 214 =Exports= Exports increased significantly, especially within the British empire. Mostly privately-owned companies traded with the colonies in the West Indies, Northern America and India. The Company of Merchant Adventurers of London brought together London's leading overseas merchants in a regulated company in the early 15th century, in the nature of a guild. Its members' main business was the export of cloth, especially white (undyed) woollen broadcloth. This enabled them to import a large range of foreign goods.Robert Brenner, Merchants and revolution: commercial change, political conflict, and London's overseas traders, 1550-1653 (Verso, 2003).E. Lipson, The Economic History of England (1956), 2:196-268. =Wool industry= Woollen cloth was the chief export and most important employer after agriculture. The golden era of the Wiltshire woollen industry was in the reign of Henry VIII. In the medieval period, raw wool had been exported, but now England had an industry, based on its 11 million sheep. London and towns purchased wool from dealers, and send it to rural households where family labour turned it into cloth. They washed the wool, carded it and spun it into thread, which was then turned into cloth on a loom. Export merchants, known as Merchant Adventurers, exported woollens into the Netherlands and Germany, as well as other lands. The arrival of Huguenots from France brought in new skills that expanded the industry.G.D. Ramsay, The English woollen industry, 1500-1750 (1982).E. Lipson, The Economic History of England: vol 2: The age of mercantilism (7th 1964) pp 10-92.Peter J. Bowden, Wool Trade in Tudor and Stuart England (1962) online. Government intervention proved a disaster in the early 17th century. A new company convinced Parliament to transfer to them the monopoly held by the old, well- established Company of Merchant Adventurers. Arguing that the export of unfinished cloth was much less profitable than the export of the finished product, the new company got Parliament to ban the export of unfinished cloth. There was massive dislocation marketplace, as large unsold quantities built up, prices fell, and unemployment rose. Worst of all, the Dutch retaliated and refused to import any finished cloth from England. Exports fell by a third. Quickly the ban was lifted, and the Merchant Adventurers got its monopoly back. However, the trade losses became permanent.C.G.A. Clay, Economic Expansion and Social Change: England 1500-1700: Volume 2, Industry, Trade and Government (1984) pp 119-20. =Diets= Diet depended largely upon social class. The rich ate meat‚Äîbeef, pork, venison and white bread; the poor ate coarse dark bread, with a little meat, notably at Christmas. Game poaching supplemented the diet of the rural poor. Everyone drank ale or cider as water was often too impure to drink. Fruits and vegetables were seldom eaten. Rich spices were used by the wealthy to offset the smells of stale salted meat. The potato had yet to become part of the diet. The rich enjoyed desserts such as pastries, tarts, cakes, and crystallized fruit, and syrup.Stephen Mennell, All manners of food: eating and taste in England and France from the Middle Ages to the present (University of Illinois Press, 1996). Among the rich private hospitality was an important item in their budget. Entertaining a royal party for a few weeks could be ruinous to a nobleman. Inns existed for travellers but restaurants were not known. Both the rich and the poor had diets with nutritional deficiency. The lack of vegetables and fruits in their diets caused a deficiency in vitamin C, sometimes resulting in scurvy. Trade and industry flourished in the 16th century, making England more prosperous and improving the standard of living of the upper and middle classes. However, the lower classes did not benefit much and did not always have enough food. As the English population was fed by its own agricultural produce, a series of bad harvests in the 1590s caused widespread distress.Andrew B. Appleby, Famine in Tudor and Stuart England (Stanford University Press, 1978). In the 17th century the food supply improved. England had no food crises from 1650 to 1725, a period when France was unusually vulnerable to famines. Historians point out that oat and barley prices in England did not always increase following a failure of the wheat crop, but did so in France.Andrew B. Appleby, \\"Grain prices and subsistence crises in England and France, 1590‚Äì1740.\\" Journal of Economic History 39#4 (1979): 865-887. in JSTOR =Poverty= A woodcut from circa 1536 depicting a vagrant being punished in the streets in Tudor England. About one-third of the population lived in poverty, with the wealthy expected to give alms to assist the impotent poor.John F. Pound, Poverty and vagrancy in Tudor England (Routledge, 2014). Tudor law was harsh on the able-bodied poor, those physically fit but unable to find work. Those who left their parishes in order to locate work were termed vagabonds and could be subjected to punishments, often suffering whipping and being put in the stocks. This treatment was inflicted to encourage them to return to their \\"mother parish.\\"Paul Slack, Poverty and policy in Tudor and Stuart England (1988). 18th century =The trading nation= The 18th century was prosperous as entrepreneurs extended the range of their business around the globe. By the 1720s Britain was one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and Daniel Defoe boasted: :we are the most \\"diligent nation in the world. Vast trade, rich manufactures, mighty wealth, universal correspondence, and happy success have been constant companions of England, and given us the title of an industrious people.\\"Julian Hoppit, A Land of Liberty?: England 1689‚Äì1727 (2000) p 344 While the other major powers were primarily motivated toward territorial gains, and protection of their dynasties (such as the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasties, and Prussia's House of Hohenzollern), Britain had a different set of primary interests. Its main diplomatic goal (besides protecting the homeland from invasion) was building a worldwide trading network for its merchants, manufacturers, shippers and financiers. This required a hegemonic Royal Navy so powerful that no rival could sweep its ships from the world's trading routes, or invade the British Isles. The London government enhanced the private sector by incorporating numerous privately financed London-based companies for establishing trading posts and opening import-export businesses across the world. Each was given a monopoly of trade to the specified geographical region. The first enterprise was the Muscovy Company set up in 1555 to trade with Russia. Other prominent enterprises included the East India Company, and the Hudson's Bay Company in Canada. The Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa had been set up in 1662 to trade in gold, ivory and slaves in Africa; it was reestablished as the Royal African Company in 1672 and focused on the slave trade. British involvement in the each of the four major wars, 1740 to 1783, paid off handsomely in terms of trade. Even the loss of the 13 colonies was made up by a very favourable trading relationship with the new United States of America. British gained dominance in the trade with India, and largely dominated the highly lucrative slave, sugar, and commercial trades originating in West Africa and the West Indies. Exports soared from ¬£6.5 million in 1700, to ¬£14.7 million in 1760 and ¬£43.2 million in 1800.E. Lipson, The Economic History of England (1931) p 188. Other powers set up similar monopolies on a much smaller scale; only the Netherlands emphasised trade as much as England.Eric J.

Lipson, The Economic History of England (1931) pp 184-370 gives capsule histories of 10 major trading companies: The Merchant Adventurers, the East India Company, the Eastland Company, the Russia Company, the Levant Company, the African Company, the Hudson's Bay Company, the French Company, the Spanish Company, and the South Sea Company. However, there was one major fiasco that caused heavy losses. The South Sea Bubble was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The South Sea Company was a private business corporation supposedly set up much like the other trading companies, with a focus on South America. Its actual purpose was to renegotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to ¬£31 million through market manipulation and speculation. It issued stock four times in 1720 that reached about 8,000 investors. Prices kept soaring every day, from ¬£130 a share to ¬£1,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining many speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places‚Äîeven to the king. His chief minister Robert Walpole managed to wind it down with minimal political and economic damage, although some losers fled to exile or committed suicide.Hoppit, A Land of Liberty?: England 1689‚Äì1727 (2000) pp 334‚Äì38Julian Hoppit, \\"The Myths of the South Sea Bubble,\\" Transactions of the Royal Historical Society (1962), 12#1 pp 141‚Äì165 = The Age of Mercantilism = The basis of the British Empire was founded in the age of mercantilism, an economic theory that stressed maximising the trade outside the empire, and trying to weaken rival empires. The 18th century British Empire was based upon the preceding English overseas possessions, which began to take shape in the late 16th and early 17th century, with the English settlement of islands of the West Indies such as Trinidad and Tobago, the Bahamas, the Leeward Islands, Barbados, Jamaica, and Bermuda, and of Virginia, one of the Thirteen Colonies which in 1776 became the United States, as well as of the Maritime provinces of what is now Canada. The sugar plantation islands of the Caribbean, where slavery became the basis of the economy, comprised England's most lucrative colonies. The American colonies also used slave labour in the farming of tobacco, indigo, and rice in the south. England, and later Great Britain's, American empire was slowly expanded by war and colonisation. Victory over the French during the Seven Years' War gave Great Britain control over what is now eastern Canada.A. H. John, ‚ÄúWar and the English Economy, 1700-1763.‚Äù Economic History Review 7#3 1955, pp. 329‚Äì344. online Mercantilism was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies. Mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants--and kept others out--by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximise exports from and minimise imports to the realm. The Navigation Acts of the late 17th century provided the legal foundation for Mercantilist policy. They required all trade to be carried in English ships, manned by English crews (this later encompassed all Britons after the Acts of Union 1707 united Scotland with England).Darwin, 2012 p.21-22 Colonists were required to send their produce and raw materials first of all to Britain, where the surplus was then sold-on by British merchants to other colonies in the British empire or bullion- earning external markets. The colonies were forbidden to trade directly with other nations or rival empires. The goal was to maintain the North American and Caribbean colonies as dependent agricultural economies geared towards producing raw materials for export to Britain. The growth of native industry was discouraged, in order to keep the colonies dependent on Britain for their finished goods.Darwin, 2012 p. 166 The government had to fight smuggling-- which became a favourite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch. The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy captured New Amsterdam (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.William R. Nester, The Great Frontier War: Britain, France, and the Imperial Struggle for North America, 1607-1755 (Praeger, 2000) p, 54. =Manufacturing= Besides woollens, cotton, silk and linen cloth manufacturing became important after 1600, as did coal and iron.Lipson, 2:10-183. Coalbrookdale by Night, 1801. Blast furnaces light the iron making town of Coalbrookdale. In 1709, Abraham Darby I established a coke-fired blast furnace to produce cast iron, replacing charcoal, although continuing to use blast furnaces. The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the factors leading to the Industrial Revolution. Toward the end of the 18th century, cast iron began to replace wrought iron for certain purposes, because it was cheaper. Carbon content in iron was not implicated as the reason for the differences in properties of wrought iron, cast iron, and steel until the 18th century.H. R. Schubert, History of the British Iron and Steel Industry ... to 1775 AD (Routledge, 1957) = The Industrial Revolution = In period loosely dated from the 1770s to the 1820s, Britain experienced an accelerated process of economic change that transformed a largely agrarian economy into the world's first industrial economy. This phenomenon is known as the \\"industrial revolution\\", since the changes were far-reaching and permanent throughout many areas of Britain, especially in the developing cities.E. Anthony Wrigley, \\"Reconsidering the Industrial Revolution: England and Wales.\\" Journal of Interdisciplinary History 49.01 (2018): 9-42. Economic, institutional, and social changes were fundamental to the emergence of the industrial revolution. Whereas absolutism remained the normal form of governance through most parts of Europe, in the UK a fundamental power balance was created after the revolutions of 1640 and 1688. The new institutional setup ensured property rights and political safety and thereby supported the emergence of an economically prosperous middle class. Another factor is the change in marriage patterns through this period. Marrying later allowed young people to acquire more education, thereby building up more human capital in the population. These changes enhanced the already relatively developed labour and financial markets, paving the way for the industrial revolution starting in the mid-18th century. Great Britain provided the legal and cultural foundations that enabled entrepreneurs to pioneer the industrial revolution.Julian Hoppit, \\"The Nation, the State, and the First Industrial Revolution,\\" Journal of British Studies (April 2011) 50#2 pp p307-331 Starting in the later part of the 18th century, there began a transition in parts of Great Britain's previously manual labour and draft-animal‚Äìbased economy towards machine-based manufacturing. It started with the mechanisation of the textile industries, the development of iron-making techniques and the increased use of refined coal. Trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of canals, improved roads and railways. Factories pulled thousands from low productivity work in agriculture to high productivity urban jobs.Redford, Arthur (1976), \\"Labour migration in England, 1800-1850\\", p. 6. Manchester University Press, Manchester. The introduction of steam power fuelled primarily by coal, wider utilisation of water wheels and powered machinery (mainly in textile manufacturing) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity. The development of all-metal machine tools in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries. The effects spread throughout Western Europe and North America during the 19th century, eventually affecting most of the world, a process that continues as industrialisation. According to Max Weber, the foundations of this process of change can be traced back to the Puritan Ethic of the Puritans of the 17th century.Hartmut Lehmann and Guenther Roth, eds. Weber's Protestant Ethic: Origins, Evidence, Contexts (1995) This produced modern personalities attuned to innovation and committed to a work ethic, inspiring landed and merchant elites alive to the benefits of modernization, and a system of agriculture able to produce increasingly cheap food supplies. To this must be added the influence of religious nonconformity, which increased literacy and inculcated a \\"Protestant work ethic\\" amongst skilled artisans.Margaret C. Jacob, and Matthew Kadane, \\"Missing, Now Found in the Eighteenth Century: Weber's Protestant Capitalist,\\" American Historical Review, (Feb 2003) 108#1 pp 20-49 in JSTOR A long run of good harvests, starting in the first half of the 18th century, resulted in an increase in disposable income and a consequent rising demand for manufactured goods, particularly textiles. The invention of the flying shuttle by John Kay enabled wider cloth to be woven faster, but also created a demand for yarn that could not be fulfilled. Thus, the major technological advances associated with the industrial revolution were concerned with spinning. James Hargreaves created the Spinning Jenny, a device that could perform the work of a number of spinning wheels. However, while this invention could be operated by hand, the water frame, invented by Richard Arkwright, could be powered by a water wheel. Indeed, Arkwright is credited with the widespread introduction of the factory system in Britain, and is the first example of the successful mill owner and industrialist in British history. The water frame was, however, soon supplanted by the spinning mule (a cross between a water frame and a jenny) invented by Samuel Crompton. Mules were later constructed in iron by Messrs. Horrocks of Stockport. As they were water powered, the first mills were constructed in rural locations by streams or rivers. Workers villages were created around them, such as New Lanark Mills in Scotland. These spinning mills resulted in the decline of the domestic system, in which spinning with old slow equipment was undertaken in rural cottages. The steam engine was invented and became a power supply that soon surpassed waterfalls and horsepower. The first practicable steam engine was invented by Thomas Newcomen, and was used for pumping water out of mines. A much more powerful steam engine was invented by James Watt; it had a reciprocating engine capable of powering machinery. The first steam-driven textile mills began to appear in the last quarter of the 18th century, and this transformed the industrial revolution into an urban phenomenon, greatly contributing to the appearance and rapid growth of industrial towns. The progress of the textile trade soon outstripped the original supplies of raw materials. By the turn of the 19th century, imported American cotton had replaced wool in the North West of England, though wool remained the chief textile in Yorkshire. Textiles have been identified as the catalyst in technological change in this period. The application of steam power stimulated the demand for coal; the demand for machinery and rails stimulated the iron industry; and the demand for transportation to move raw material in and finished products out stimulated the growth of the canal system, and (after 1830) the railway system. Such an unprecedented degree of economic growth was not sustained by domestic demand alone. The application of technology and the factory system created such levels of mass production and cost efficiency that enabled British manufacturers to export inexpensive cloth and other items worldwide. Walt Rostow has posited the 1790s as the \\"take-off\\" period for the industrial revolution. This means that a process previously responding to domestic and other external stimuli began to feed upon itself, and became an unstoppable and irreversible process of sustained industrial and technological expansion. In the late 18th century and early 19th century a series of technological advances led to the Industrial Revolution. Britain's position as the world's pre-eminent trader helped fund research and experimentation. The nation also had some of the world's greatest reserves of coal, the main fuel of the new revolution. It was also fuelled by a rejection of mercantilism in favour of the predominance of Adam Smith's capitalism. The fight against Mercantilism was led by a number of liberal thinkers, such as Richard Cobden, Joseph Hume, Francis Place and John Roebuck. Some have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas colonies or that profits from the British slave trade between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. It has been pointed out, however, that slave trade and the West Indian plantations provided less than 5% of the British national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution saw a rapid transformation in the British economy and society. Previously, large industries had to be near forests or rivers for power. The use of coal-fuelled engines allowed them to be placed in large urban centres. These new factories proved far more efficient at producing goods than the cottage industry of a previous era. These manufactured goods were sold around the world, and raw materials and luxury goods were imported to Britain. =Empire= During the Industrial Revolution the empire became less important and less well-regarded. The British defeat in the American War of Independence (1775‚Äì1783) deprived it of its largest and most developed colonies. This loss brought a realisation that colonies were not particularly economically beneficial to the home economy.Piers Brendon, The Decline and Fall of the British Empire, 1781-1997 (2010) It was realised that the costs of occupation of colonies often exceeded the financial return to the taxpayer. In other words, formal empire afforded no great economic benefit when trade would continue whether the overseas political entities were nominally sovereign or not. The American Revolution helped demonstrate this by showing that Britain could still control trade with the colonies without having to pay for their defence and governance. Capitalism encouraged the British to grant their colonies self-government, starting with Canada, which became unified and largely independent in 1867, and Australia, which followed suit in 1901.Peter Cain and Tony Hopkins. British Imperialism: 1688-2000 (2nd ed. 2001) =Napoleonic wars= Critical to British success in confronting Napoleon was its superior economic situation. It was able to mobilize the nation's industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating France. With a population of 16 million Britain was barely half the size of France with 30 million. In terms of soldiers, the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for a large proportion of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 in 1813.Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers ‚Äì economic change and military conflict from 1500 to 2000 (1989), pp. 128‚Äì9 Most important, the British national output remained strong. Textiles and iron grew sharply. Iron production expanded as demand for cannon and munitions was insatiable. Agricultural prices soared‚Äîit was a golden age for agriculture even as food shortages appeared here and there. There were riots in Cornwall, Devon, and Somerset during the food shortages of 1800-01. Mobs forced merchants to hand over their stocks, as the food was distributed to the hungry by popular committees. Wells concludes that the disturbances indicate deep social grievances that extended far beyond the immediate food shortages.Roger Wells, \\"The revolt of the south-west, 1800-1801: a study in English popular protest,\\" Social History (1977) #6 pp 713-744. Overall, however, crop production grew 50% between 1795 and 1815.Asa Briggs, The Making of Modern England 1783-1867: The Age of Improvement (1959) pp 162-4 The system of smuggling finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to ruin the British economy by cutting off markets. The well-organized business sector channelled products into what the military needed. Not only did British cloth provide for British uniforms, it clothed the allies as well and indeed the French soldiers too. Britain used its economic power to expand the Royal Navy, doubling the number of frigates and increasing the number of large ships of the line by 50%, while increasing the roster of sailors from 15,000 to 133,000 in eight years after the war began in 1793. France, meanwhile, saw its navy shrink by more than half.Briggs, The Making of Modern England 1783-1867: The Age of Improvement (1959) pp 143, 162 The national debt of the United Kingdom was at a record high percentage of the GDP as the Napoleonic wars ended, but was largely repaid by 1914. The British budget in 1814 reached ¬£66 million, including ¬£10 million for the Navy, ¬£40 million for the Army, ¬£10 million for the Allies, and ¬£38 million as interest on the national debt. The national debt soared to ¬£679 million, more than double the GDP. It was willingly supported by hundreds of thousands of investors and tax payers, despite the higher taxes on land and a new income tax.Richard Cooper, \\"William Pitt, Taxation, and the Needs of War,\\" Journal of British Studies (1982) 22#1 pp 94-103 in JSTOR. The whole cost of the war came to ¬£831 million. By contrast the French financial system was inadequate and Napoleon's forces had to rely in part on requisitions from conquered lands.√âlie Hal√©vy, A History of the English People in 1815 (1924) vol 2 p 205-6, 215-228Roger Knight, Britain Against Napoleon: The Organisation of Victory, 1793-1815 (2013)J. Steven Watson, The Reign of George III 1760-1815 (1960), 374-77, 406-7, 463-71, Long-term favourable impact O'Brien examines the long-term economic impact of the wars, 1793-1815, and finds them generally favourable, except for damage to the working class. The economy was not damaged by the diversion of manpower to the army and navy; in terms of destruction and enforced transfer of national wealth, Britain came out ahead. British control of the oceans proved optimal in creating a liberal free-trade global economy, and helped Britain gain the lion's share of the world's carrying trade and financial support services. The effects were positive for agriculture and most industries, apart from construction. The rate of capital formation was slowed somewhat and national income perhaps would have grown even faster without war. The most negative impact was a drop in living standards for the urban working classes.Patrick O'Brien, \\"The Impact of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, 1793-1815, on the Long-Run Growth of the British Economy,\\" Review: A Journal of the Fernand Braudel Center (1989) 12#3 pp 335-395. 19th century 19th century Britain was the world's richest and most advanced economy. Real GDP per person almost doubled in the 90 years between 1780 and 1870, when it reached $3263 per capita. This was one third greater than GDP per person in the United States, and 70% more than both France and Germany. The economy was the most industrialized in the world, with one-third of the population employed in manufacturing by 1870 (concurrently one-sixth of the workforce in the United States was employed in manufacturing). The level of quantifiable steam power (in both industry and railroad travel), was gauged at 7,600 hp in 1880, only excelled by the United States.Hobsbawm, 1975; 309 Urbanization was so intense that by 1901 80% of the British population lived in towns.Morgan 2008; 474 The number of towns with a population over 50,000 reached 32 between 1847‚Äì50, double that of Germany and almost five times that of the United States. By 1901 there were 74 British towns which met the 50,000 minimum threshold. =Free trade= Tariff Rates (France, UK, US) Free trade was intellectually established by 1780 and implemented in the 1840s, thanks to the unusually strong influence of political theorists such as Adam Smith. They convincingly argued that the old policy of mercantilism held back the British economy, which if unfettered was poised to dominate world trade. As predicted, British dominance of world trade was apparent by the 1850s.William D. Grampp, \\"How Britain turned to free trade.\\" Business History Review 61.1 (1987): 86-112 online. After 1840, Britain committed its economy to free trade, with few barriers or tariffs. This was most evident in the repeal in 1846 of the Corn Laws, which had imposed stiff tariffs on imported grain. The end of these laws opened the British market to unfettered competition, grain prices fell, and food became more plentiful. By re-introducing income taxes in 1842 at the rate of 7 pence on the pound for incomes over ¬£150, the government of Sir Robert Peel was able to compensate for loss of revenue and repeal import duties on over 700 items. From 1815 to 1870, Britain reaped the benefits of being the world's first modern, industrialised nation. It described itself as 'the workshop of the world', meaning that its finished goods were produced so efficiently and cheaply that they could often undersell comparable, locally manufactured goods in almost any other market.Harold Cox, ed., British industries under free trade (1903) pp 17-18. If political conditions in a particular overseas market were stable enough, Britain could dominate its economy through free trade alone without having to resort to formal rule or mercantilism. Britain was even supplying half the needs in manufactured goods of such nations as Germany, France, Belgium, and the United States. By 1820, 30% of Britain's exports went to its Empire, rising slowly to 35% by 1910.Andrew Porter, The Nineteenth Century The Oxford History of the British Empire Volume 3 (1999) p 35 Until the latter 19th century, India remained Britain's economic jewel in terms of both imports and exports. In 1867, when British exports to her Empire totaled ¬£50 million, ¬£21 million of that was earned from India's market alone. Second to India, but far behind, was Australia, whose imports from Britain totaled ¬£8 million, followed by Canada (¬£5.8 million), Hong Kong (¬£2.5 million), Singapore (¬£2 million), and New Zealand (¬£1.6 million). While these figures were undoubtedly significant, they represented just over a third of total British exports, the same proportion as over forty years before. Apart from coal, iron, tin and kaolin most raw materials had to be imported so that, in the 1830s, the main imports were (in order): raw cotton (from the American South), sugar (from the West Indies), wool, silk, tea (from China), timber (from Canada), wine, flax, hides and tallow.Porter, The Nineteenth Century The Oxford History of the British Empire Volume 3 (1999) p 33 By 1900, Britain's global share had soared to 22.8% of total imports. By 1922, its global share was 14.9% of total exports and 28.8% of manufactured exports.INTERNATIONAL TRADE STATISTICS 1900 ‚Äì 1960 (draft, unvalidated) United Nations, 1962 However, while in the 1890s Britain persisted in its free trade policy its major rivals, the U.S. and Germany, turned to high and moderately high tariffs respectively. American heavy industry grew faster than Britain and by the 1890s was competing with British machinery and other products in the world market.Marc-William Palen, \\"Protection, Federation and Union: The Global Impact of the McKinley Tariff upon the British Empire, 1890-94,\\" Journal of Imperial & Commonwealth History (2010) 38#3 pp 395-418, online Imperialism of Free Trade Historians agree that in the 1840s, Britain adopted a free-trade policy, meaning open markets and no tariffs throughout the empire. The debate among historians involves what the implications of free trade actually were. \\"The Imperialism of Free Trade\\" is a highly influential 1952 article by John Gallagher and Ronald Robinson.John Gallagher, and Ronald Robinson, \\"The Imperialism of Free Trade\\" Economic History Review 6#1 (1953), pp. 1‚Äì15Winks, Oxford History 5:40-42 They argued that the New Imperialism of the 1880s, especially the Scramble for Africa, was a continuation of a long-term policy in which informal empire, based on the principles of free trade, was favoured over formal imperial control. The article helped launch the Cambridge School of historiography. Gallagher and Robinson used the British experience to construct a framework for understanding European imperialism that swept away the all-or-nothing thinking of previous historians.R. E. Robinson and John Gallagher, Africa and the Victorians: The official mind of imperialism (1966). They found that European leaders rejected the notion that \\"imperialism\\" had to be based upon formal, legal control by one government over a colonial region. Much more important was informal influence in independent areas. According to Wm. Roger Louis, \\"In their view, historians have been mesmerized by formal empire and maps of the world with regions colored red. The bulk of British emigration, trade, and capital went to areas outside the formal British Empire. Key to their thinking is the idea of empire 'informally if possible and formally if necessary.'\\"Wm. Roger Louis, Imperialism (1976) p. 4. Oron Hale says that Gallagher and Robinson looked at the British involvement in Africa where they, \\"found few capitalists, less capital, and not much pressure from the alleged traditional promoters of colonial expansion. Cabinet decisions to annex or not to annex were made, usually on the basis of political or geopolitical considerations.\\"Oron J. Hale, The Great Illusion: 1900‚Äì1914 (1971) p. 6. Reviewing the debate from the end of the 20th century, historian Martin Lynn argues that Gallagher and Robinson exaggerated the impact. He says that Britain achieved its goal of increasing its economic interests in many areas, \\"but the broader goal of 'regenerating' societies and thereby creating regions tied as 'tributaries' to British economic interests was not attained.\\" The reasons were: The idea that free-trade imperial states use informal controls to secure their expanding economic influence has attracted Marxists trying to avoid the problems of earlier Marxist interpretations of capitalism. The approach is most often applied to American policies. =Agriculture= A free market for imported foodstuffs, the driving factor behind the 1846 repeal of the Corn Laws, reaped long-term benefits for British consumers as world agricultural production increased.Musson, 1959 p. 205 At first British agriculture, through its superior productivity, was able to weather and even thrive following the repeal of the Corn Laws, contrary to the dire warnings of the landowners who had warned of immediate agricultural ruin. By the 1870s, the global price of grain began to fall dramatically following the opening up of the Midwestern United States and interior of Canada to mechanized cultivation. Combined with lower global transportation costs, the average price of a quarter of grain fell from 56s in the years 1867‚Äì71, to 27s 3d per quarter in 1894‚Äì98.Carter & Mears 2011 p. 173 This lowered the cost of living and enabled Britain to meet the demands of a quickly growing population (grain imports tripled in volume between 1870 and 1914, while the population grew 43% between 1871 and 1901).Darwin, 2014 p.180 It also caused the Great Depression of British Agriculture in the countryside by the late 1870s, where a series of bad harvests combined with the far cheaper price of foreign grain induced a long decline for the British agricultural sector. Wheat-producing areas like East Anglia were especially hard hit, with overall wheat cultivation down from 13% of agricultural output in 1870, to 4% in 1900. Landowners argued for a re-introduction of the Corn Laws to protect domestic farming, but this was rebuffed by Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, who argued that returning to protectionism would endanger British manufacturing supremacy. In addition to the general slump in demand, greater mechanization in British agriculture, typified by the introduction of steam-powered threshing machines, mowers, and reapers, increased unemployment for rural workers. The result was an acceleration of migration from country to town, where jobs in factories, domestic service, and other occupations offered better wages and more opportunities.Morgan, 2008 p.479 The male workforce of the countryside decreased by 40% between 1861 and 1901, while agriculture as a percentage of the national wealth fell from 20.3% in 1851 to just 6.4% by 1901. The depression did not apply only to foodstuffs, but also to wool producers, a once vital sector undercut by a flood of cheap wool imports from Australia and New Zealand. Only select types of produce where freshness was imperative, like milk and meat, enjoyed strong domestic demand in the late 19th century. The declining profitability of agriculture in the latter decades of the 19th century left British landowners hard pressed to maintain their accustomed lifestyles. The connection between land ownership and wealth which had for centuries underpinned the British aristocracy began an inexorable decline. Rents fell some 26% between the mid-1870s and mid-1890s, just as the amount of land under cultivation fell some 19%. 88% of British millionaires between the years 1809‚Äì1879 were defined as landowners; the proportion fell to 33% in the years 1880‚Äì1914, as a new class of plutocrats emerged from industry and finance. =Recessions= The Peterloo Massacre of 1819 Britain's 19th century economic growth was beset by frequent and sometimes severe recessions. The Post-Napoleonic depression following the end of the Wars in 1815 was induced by several years of poor harvests, which were aggravated by the Corn Laws of 1815. This law set high tariffs on imported foodstuffs, keeping the cost of grain artificially high while wages were declining. As early as 1816, the high cost of grain caused famine and unrest in areas such as East Anglia and the North of England, where rioters seized grain stores and attacked the homes of suspected profiteers and merchants. The high food prices caused an overall slump in consumption and consequently in industrial production and employment. The discontent of the workers culminated in the disastrous confrontation with the authorities at the Peterloo Massacre of 1819, when British cavalry rode headfirst into a crowd of 60,000 to 80,000 protesters in Manchester, killing 5 and wounding as many as 700 people. The Pursuit of Power, Evans, p. 50 The recession of the \\"Hungry Forties\\" was similar in its nature to that of the 1820s. Like that of the years following 1815, the 1840s recession was caused by a series of bad harvests, this time from a blight affecting potatoes facilitated by unusually wet and cold conditions in Northern Europe. Ireland, where the population was heavily dependent on potatoes for subsistence, was the worst affected. On mainland Britain, regions of the Scottish Highlands and the Outer Hebrides were worst affected by the potato blight (some parts were depopulated by as much as 50%). The Corn Laws inhibited the ability of the British government to import food for the starving in Ireland and Scotland, which led the Tory Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel to defy the landed interests in Parliament and force the abolition of the Corn Laws in June 1846. The abolition was only accomplished in phases through 1849, by which time Ireland and the Highlands had lost much of their populations to famine or emigration. The repeal of the Laws, combined with the astronomic growth of the railways, served to lift Britain out of recession in the 1850s, providing the basis for steady growth in population and output over the next few decades.The Oxford Illustrated History of Britain, Morgan; p.459 =Railways= The British invented the modern railway system and exported it to the world. This emerged from Britain's elaborate system of canals and roadways, which both used horses to haul coal. Domestic consumption in household heaths remained an important market though coal also fired the new steam engines installed in textile factories. Britain furthermore had the engineers and entrepreneurs needed to create and finance a railway system. In 1815, George Stephenson invented the modern steam locomotive, launching a technological race: bigger, more powerful locomotives using higher and higher steam pressures. Stephenson's key innovation came when he integrated all the components of a railways system in 1825 by opening the Stockton and Darlington line. It demonstrated it was commercially feasible to have a system of usable length. London poured money into railway building‚Äîa veritable bubble, but one with permanent value. Thomas Brassey brought British railway engineering to the world, with construction crews that in the 1840s employed 75,000 men across Europe. Every nation copied the British model. Brassey expanded throughout the British Empire and Latin America. His companies invented and improved thousands of mechanical devices, and developed the science of civil engineering to build roadways, tunnels and bridges. The telegraph, although invented and developed separately, proved essential for the internal communications of the railways because it allowed slower trains to pull over as express trains raced through. Telegraphs made it possible to use a single track for two-way traffic, and to locate where repairs were needed. Britain had a superior financial system based in London that funded both the railways in Britain and also in many other parts of the world, including the United States, up until 1914. The boom years were 1836 and 1845‚Äì47, when Parliament authorized 8,000 miles of railways with a projected future total of ¬£200 million; that about equalled one year of Britain's GDP. Once a charter was obtained, there was little government regulation, as laissez faire and private ownership had become accepted practices. George Hudson Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806‚Äì1859) designed the first major railway, the Great Western, built originally in the 1830s to cover the 100 miles from London to Bristol. Even more important was the highly controversial George Hudson. He became Britain's \\"railway king\\" by merging numerous short lines.A. J. Arnold, and S. McCartney, George Hudson: The Rise and Fall of the Railway King (2004) Since there was no government agency supervising the railways, Hudson set up a system that all the lines adopted called the Railway Clearing House. It made interconnections easy for people and freight by standardizing routines for transferring freight and people between companies, and loaning out freight cars. By 1849 Hudson controlled nearly 30% of Britain's trackage. Hudson did away with accountants and manipulated funds‚Äîpaying large dividends out of capital because profits were quite low, but no one knew that until his system collapsed and the railway bubble of the late 1840s burst.Adrian Vaughan, Railwaymen, Politics and Money: The Great Age of Railways in Britain (1997) pp 102-12 Euston station in London, 1837. Note the open passenger carriages By 1850 Britain had a well integrated, well engineered system that provided fast, on-time, inexpensive movement of freight and people to every city and most rural districts. Freight rates had plunged to a penny a ton mile for coal. The system directly or indirectly employed tens of thousands of engineers, conductors, mechanics, repairmen, accountants, station agents and managers, bringing a new level of business sophistication that could be applied to many other industries, and helping many small and large businesses to expand their role in the industrial revolution. Thus railways had a tremendous impact on industrialization. By lowering transportation costs, they reduced costs for all industries moving supplies and finished goods, and they increased demand for the production of all the inputs needed for the railway system itself. The system kept growing; by 1880, there were 13,500 locomotives which each carried 97,800 passengers a year, or 31,500 tons of freight.Jack Simmons and Gordon Biddle, The Oxford Companion to British Railway History: From 1603 to the 1990s (1999) = Second Industrial Revolution = thumb thumb During the First Industrial Revolution, the industrialist replaced the merchant as the dominant figure in the capitalist system. In the later decades of the 19th century, when the ultimate control and direction of large industry came into the hands of financiers, industrial capitalism gave way to financial capitalism and the corporation. The establishment of behemoth industrial empires, whose assets were controlled and managed by men divorced from production, was a dominant feature of this third phase. By the middle of the 19th century, as the world's only fully industrialized nation, British output represented just under half the total of the world's industrial capacity. New products and services were also introduced which greatly increased international trade. Improvements in steam engine design and the wide availability of cheap iron (and after 1870 steel) meant that slow, sailing ships could be replaced with steamships, such as Brunel's SS Great Western. Electricity and chemical industries became important although Britain lagged behind the U.S. and Germany. Amalgamation of industrial cartels into larger corporations, mergers and alliances of separate firms, and technological advancement (particularly the increased use of electric power and internal combustion engines fuelled by gasoline) were mixed blessings for British business during the late Victorian era. The ensuing development of more intricate and efficient machines along with mass production techniques greatly expanded output and lowered production costs. As a result, production often exceeded domestic demand. Among the new conditions, more markedly evident in Britain, the forerunner of Europe's industrial states, were the long-term effects of the severe Long Depression of 1873-1896, which had followed fifteen years of great economic instability. Businesses in practically every industry suffered from lengthy periods of low -- and falling -- profit rates and price deflation after 1873. By the 1870s, financial houses in London had achieved an unprecedented level of control over industry. This contributed to increasing concerns among policy-makers over the protection of British investments overseas -- particularly those in the securities of foreign governments and in foreign-government-backed development activities, such as railways. Although it had been official British policy to support such investments, with the large expansion of these investments in the 1860s, and the economic and political instability of many areas of investment (such as Egypt), calls upon the government for methodical protection became increasingly pronounced in the years leading up to the Crystal Palace Speech. At the end of the Victorian era, the service sector (banking, insurance and shipping, for example) began to gain prominence at the expense of manufacturing. During the late 18th century the United Kingdom experienced stronger increases in the service sector than in the industrial sector; industry grew by only 2 percent, whereas the service sector employment increased by 9 percent. = Foreign trade = Canning Dock, Liverpool c. 1910, the \\"Second City\\" of the British Empire. Foreign trade tripled in volume between 1870 and 1914; most of the activity occurred with other industrialised countries. Britain ranked as the world's largest trading nation in 1860, but by 1913 it had lost ground to both the United States and Germany: British and German exports in the latter year each totalled $2.3 billion, and those of the United States exceeded $2.4 billion. Although her own exports were diminishing in comparison to her rivals, Britain remained the world's largest trading nation by a significant margin: in 1914 her import and export totals were larger by a third compared to Germany, and larger by 50 percent compared to the United States. Britain was a top importer of foodstuffs, raw materials, and finished goods, much of which were re-exported to Europe or the United States. In 1880 Britain purchased about half the world total in traded tea, coffee, and wheat, and just under half of the world's meat exports. In that same year, more than 50 percent of world shipping was British owned, while British shipyards were constructing about four fifths of the world's new vessels in the 1890s. Its extensive trading contacts, investments in agriculture, and merchant shipping fleet enabled it to trade in a great volume of commodities remotely - transactions were concluded with foreign clients from London or other British cities over distant commodities like coffee, tea, cotton, rubber, and sugar. Proportionally, even though trade volumes trebled between 1870 and 1914, the British share of the world market was actually shrinking. In 1880, 23 percent of world trade was British-owned - by 1910 it was 17 percent. As foreign trade increased, so in proportion did the amount of it going outside the Continent. In 1840, ¬£7.7 million of its export and ¬£9.2 million of its import trade was done outside Europe; in 1880 the figures were ¬£38.4 million and ¬£73 million. Europe's economic contacts with the wider world were multiplying, much as Britain's had been doing for years. In many cases, colonial control followed private investment, particularly in raw materials and agriculture.Jeffry A.

In this competitive milieu, British businessmen modernised their operations; for example, manufactures of boots and shoes faced increasing imports of American footwear and Americans entered the market for shoe-making machinery. British shoe- makers realised that to meet this competition it was necessary to re-examine their traditional methods of work, labour utilisation, and industrial relations; they also had to be more responsive to the demands of fashion.R. A.

The City of London strengthened its position as the world's financial capital, the export of capital was a major base of the British economy 1880 to 1913, the \\"golden era\\" of international finance.Albert H.

Although the British trade deficit widened (¬£27 million in 1851, by 1911 it was ¬£134 million), earnings from investment and financial services more than closed the gap and generated a substantial Balance of Payments surplus. Part of the reason for the initial boom in financial services was because manufacturing became less profitable beginning in the 1880s, due to the largely depressed world market of these years, combined with the expansion of manufacturing in the United States and Germany. With foreign competition in some manufacturing sectors fiercer than in mid-century, British industrialists and financiers more profitably invested increasing quantities of capital abroad. In 1911, income from overseas investments amounted to ¬£188 million; income from services like insurance, shipping, and banking totalled some ¬£152 million. It is indicative of the notable shift to financial services that between 1900 and 1913 total British investment abroad doubled, increasing from ¬£2 billion to ¬£4 billion.Charles Feinstein, \\"Britain's Overseas Investments in 1913,\\" Economic History Review (1990) 43#2 pp. 288-295 in JSTOR British overseas investment was especially impressive in the independent nations of Latin America, which were eager for infrastructure improvements, such as railways and ports, that were often built by British contracting firms, and telegraph and telephone systems. Contemporaneously, British merchants dominated international trade in Latin America.Irving Stone, \\"British Long- Term Investment in Latin America, 1865-1913,\\" Business History Review, (1968) 42#3 pp 311-39 in JSTOR Inevitably, not all these investments paid off; for example, many British investors suffered substantial losses after investing in railway companies in the United States that went bankrupt, while even some mining ventures in the Sudan also proved unprofitable.S. M. Mollan, \\"Business Failure, Capital Investment and Information: Mining Companies in the Anglo- Egyptian Sudan, 1900-13,\\" Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History, (2009) 37#2 pp 229-248 =Business practices= Big business grew much more slowly in Britain than in the United States, with the result that by the late 19th century the much larger American corporations were growing faster and could undersell the smaller competitors in Britain. A key was the vertical integration. In the United States, the typical firm expanded by reaching backward into the supply chain and forward into the distribution system. In the Ford Motor Company, raw iron and coal went in one end, and Model Ts were delivered by local dealers at the other end, British firms did not try to own the sources of raw materials, they bought on the market. Instead of setting up their own distribution system they worked with well-established wholesalers. The British businessmen were much more comfortable and a smaller niche, even though it made it much harder to lower costs and prices. Furthermore the Americans had a rapidly growing home market, and Investment Capital was much more readily available. British businessmen typically used their savings not to expand their business but to purchase highly prestigious country estates ‚Äì they looked to the landed country gentry for their role model Where the Americans look to the multi-millionaires. Crystal Palace hosted a world class industrial exhibition in 1851 in London. It was a marvelous display of the latest achievements in material progress, clearly demonstrating British superiority. The Americans were impressed, and repeatedly opened world‚Äìclass industrial exhibits. By contrast, the British never repeated their success. In 1886 British sociologist Herbert Spencer commented: \\"Absorbed by his activities, and spurred on by his unrestricted ambitions, the American is a less happy being than the inhabitant of a country where the possibilities of success are very much smaller.\\"Mansel G. Blackford, The rise of modern business in Great Britain, the United States, and Japan (U of North Carolina Press, 1998) pp 64-66,  Organization As industrialisation took effect in the late 18th and early 19th century, the United Kingdom possessed a strong national government that provided a standard currency, an efficient legal system, efficient taxation, and effective support for overseas enterprise both within the British Empire and in independent nations. Parliament repealed medieval laws that restricted business enterprise, such as specification of how many threads could be in a woollen cloth, or regulating interest rates. Taxation fell primarily on landed wealth, not accumulated capital nor income. In 1825 Parliament repealed the Bubble Act of 1720 and facilitated capital accumulation. After the General Enclosure Act of 1801, farming became more productive and feed the growing urban industrial workforce. J. A. Yelling, \\"Changes in Crop Production in East Worcestershire 1540-1867.\\" Agricultural History Review 21.1 (1973): 18-34 online. The Navigation Acts remained important into the 1820s, and enforced by the Royal Navy, facilitated international trade. The road system was developed through government- sponsored local turnpikes. However there were few examples of government- financed canals, and none of railroads, unlike early major transport projects in Japan, in Russia, or in the mid-nineteenth century USA.Mansel G. Blackford, The rise of modern business in Great Britain, the United States, and Japan (U of North Carolina Press, 1998) pp. 31‚Äì32. Evidence from Lever Brothers, Royal Dutch Shell, and Burroughs Wellcome indicates that after 1870 individual entrepreneurship by top leaders was critical in fostering the growth of direct foreign investment and the rise to prominence of multinational corporations. In 1929, the first modern multinational company emerged when a merger of Dutch Margarine Unie and British soapmaker Lever Brothers resulted in Unilever. With 250,000 people employed, and in terms of market value, Unilever was the largest industrial company in Europe. Brian Lewis \\"So Clean\\": Lord Leverhulme, Soap and Civilization; (Manchester UP, 2008). However after 1945 the importance of entrepreneurship declined in British business.Howard Archer, \\"The role of the entrepreneur in the emergence and development of UK multinational enterprises.\\" Journal of European Economic History 19.2 (1990): 293.  Accounting New business practices in the areas of management and accounting made possible the more efficient operation of large companies. For example, in steel, coal, and iron companies 19th-century accountants used sophisticated, fully integrated accounting systems to calculate output, yields, and costs to satisfy management information requirements.Trevor Boyns and John Richard Edwards, \\"The Construction of Cost Accounting Systems in Britain to 1900: The Case of the Coal, Iron, and Steel Industries,\\" Business History, (July 1997) 39#3 pp 1-29 South Durham Steel and Iron, was a large horizontally integrated company that operated mines, mills, and shipyards. Its management used traditional accounting methods with the goal of minimizing production costs, and thus raising its profitability. By contrast one of its competitors, Cargo Fleet Iron introduced mass production milling techniques through the construction of modern plants. Cargo Fleet set high production goals and developed an innovative but complicated accounting system to measure and report all costs throughout the production process. However, problems in obtaining coal supplies and the failure to meet the firm's production goals forced Cargo Fleet to drop its aggressive system and return to the sort of approach South Durham Steel was using.Gordon Boyce, \\"Corporate Strategy and Accounting Systems,\\" Business History, (1992) 34#1 pp 42-65 = Imperialism = After the loss of the American colonies in 1776, Britain built a \\"Second British Empire\\", based in colonies in India, Asia, Australia, Canada. The crown jewel was India, where in the 1750s a private British company, with its own army, the East India Company (or \\"John Company\\"), took control of parts of India. The 19th century saw Company rule extended across India after expelling the Dutch, French and Portuguese. By the 1830s the Company was a government and had given up most of its business in India, but it was still privately owned. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 the government closed down the Company and took control of British India and the Company's Presidency Armies.Lawrence James, Raj: The Making and Unmaking of British India (2000) Free trade (with no tariffs and few trade barriers) was introduced in the 1840s.

Numerous independent entrepreneurs expanded the Empire, such as Stamford Raffles of the East India Company who founded the port of Singapore in 1819. Businessmen eager to sell Indian opium in the vast China market led to the Opium War (1839‚Äì1842) and the establishment of British colonies at Hong Kong. One adventurer, James Brooke, set himself up as the Rajah of the Kingdom of Sarawak in North Borneo in 1842; his realm joined the Empire in 1888. Cecil Rhodes set up an economic empire of diamonds in South Africa that proved highly profitable. There were great riches in gold and diamonds but this venture led to expensive wars with the Dutch settlers known as Boers. The possessions of the East India Company in India, under the direct rule of the Crown from 1857 ‚Äîknown as British India‚Äî was the centrepiece of the Empire, and because of an efficient taxation system it paid its own administrative expenses as well as the cost of the large British Indian Army. In terms of trade, however, India turned only a small profit for British business.P. J. Cain and A. G. Hopkins, British Imperialism: 1688-2000 (2nd ed. 2002) ch 10 However, transfers to the British government was massive: in 1801 unrequited (unpaid, or paid from Indian-collected revenue) was about 30% of British domestic savings available for capital formation in Britain. There was pride and glory in the Empire, as talented young Britons vied for positions in the Indian Civil Service and for similar overseas career opportunities. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 was a vital economic and military link. To protect the canal, Britain expanded further, taking control of Egypt, the Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Cyprus, Palestine, Aden, and British Somaliland. None were especially profitable until the discovery of oil in the Middle East after 1920. Some military action was involved, and from time to time there was a risk of conflict with other imperial powers seeking the same territory, as in the Fashoda Incident of 1898. All the incidents were resolved peacefully. Cain and Hopkins argue that the phases of expansion abroad were closely linked with the development of the domestic economy. Therefore, the shifting balance of social and political forces under imperialism and the varying intensity of Britain's economic and political rivalry with other powers need to be understood with reference to domestic policies. Gentlemen capitalists, representing Britain's landed gentry and London's service sectors and financial institutions, largely shaped and controlled Britain's imperial enterprises in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Industrial leaders played a lesser role and found themselves dependent on the gentlemen capitalists.P. J. Cain and A. G. Hopkins, \\"Gentlemanly Capitalism and British Expansion Overseas I.

The bursting of a railroad speculation bubble in the United States, heavily financed via London, was a major factor in the initial shock. British foreign investment fell sharply, but it took some years for record high domestic investments to fall as well. The initial Depression lasted between 1873-1879, and was marked above all by price deflation, and therefore declining profitability for industrialists and financiers. Shrinking returns and a generally unfavorable economic climate meant that investment as a percentage of Britain's National wealth, both overseas and at home, fell from an average of 12.6% between 1870‚Äì74, to 9.7% between 1875‚Äì1896.Musson, 1959; p. 211 The sluggish world market, which was at its weakest in the 1880s, was keenly felt in the export-reliant economy of the UK. British quinquennial export averages did not return to their pre-1873 levels (¬£235 million between 1870‚Äì74) until 1895‚Äì99, slumping to ¬£192 million in 1879. The recovery, moreover, was weaker than the mid-century growth in exports, because British manufactures were struggling to compete with domestically-produced products in nations like Germany and the United States, where steep exclusionary tariffs had been enforced in response to the economic crisis.Musson, 1959; p. 214 Prices on commodities in Britain fell as much as 40% in the 1870s, with a downward pressure on wages which led to a general perception among the working classes of financial hardship and decline. To a great extent, Britain's economic difficulties were symptomatic of structural weaknesses that were beginning to manifest themselves by the 1870s.James, 1990; 202 Economists have explained the relative slowdown in growth during the latter 19th century in terms of the Neoclassical growth model, in which the momentum from decades of growth was reaching an inevitable slow down.Crafts, 1998; 193 Endogenous growth theory suggests that this slowdown was attributable to national institutions and conditions, such as entrepreneurship, natural resources, and outward investment, rather than subject to a naturally occurring external model.Crafts, 1998; 194 It is not surprising then, that countries with markedly larger natural resources, and larger populations to draw from, should have overtaken the UK in terms of production by the end of the nineteenth century. Britain depended on imports to supplement her deficiencies of some natural resources, but the high cost of shipping made this impracticable when competing against the resource-rich giant, the United States.Crafts, 1998; 202 The result was clearly measured: the UK averaged 1.8% annual growth between 1873 and 1913, while the United States and Germany averaged 4.8% and 3.9% per annum respectively.Musson, 1959; p. 208 Historians have criticized cultural and educational factors for contributing to a decline in the \\"entrepreneurial spirit\\" which had characterized the Industrial Revolution. The offspring of first and second-generation industrialists in the late 19th-century, raised in privilege and educated at aristocratically-dominated public schools, showed little interest in adopting their father's occupations because of the stigma attached to working in manufacturing or \\"trade\\".Morgan, 2009 p. 491 Moreover, the curricula of the public schools and universities was overwhelmingly centered on the study of Classics, which left students ill-prepared to innovate in the manufacturing world. Many turned away from industry and entered the more \\"gentlemanly\\" financial sector, the law courts, or the civil service of the Empire. However, the statistical evidence counters any of perception of economic stagnation in the latter 19th century: the employed labour force grew, unemployment in the years 1874‚Äì1890 only averaged 4.9%, and productivity continued to rise after the 1870s recession, albeit at a lower annual rate of 1%, compared to 2% in the years preceding the 1873 Panic. Moreover, because of the decline in prices overall, living standards improved markedly during the \\"Long Depression\\" decades. Real GDP per capita fluctuated by the year, but as a whole rose steadily from $3870 in 1873 to $5608 by 1900, exceeding all nations in terms of per capita wealth except Australia and the United States. The heavy investment levels of pre-1873 began to yield returns, so that British income from abroad surpassed outward investment and created a steady surplus to support the widening balance of trade.Musson, 1959; p. 215 The export of capital investment, even though it occupied a smaller percentage of the national wealth, recovered briskly beginning in 1879, reaching record highs in the following decade (¬£56.15 million between 1876‚Äì95, compared to ¬£33.74 between 1851‚Äì1874). The trend towards investing British capital abroad in the late 19th century (about 35% of British assets were held abroad by 1913) has been blamed for essentially starving native industry of investment which could have been used to maintain competitiveness and increase productivity.Carter & Mears, 2011 p.177 One of the causes for the 1873 panic was attributed to overproduction in industry. British industrialists believed they had produced more than could be sold on saturated domestic and overseas markets, so they began to lobby the British government and public opinion to expand the British Empire. According to this theory, Britain's trade deficit could be corrected, and excess production absorbed, by these new markets.Ewout Frankema, Jeffrey Williamson, and Pieter Woltjer, \\"An Economic Rationale for the West African Scramble? The Commercial Transition and the Commodity Price Boom of 1835‚Äì1885,\\" Journal of Economic History 78#1 (2018) , pp. 231‚Äì67. The result was the Scramble for Africa, the aggressive competition for territory between Britain and her European competitors which occurred in the 1880s. 1900‚Äì1945 By 1900, the United States and Germany had experienced industrialisation on a scale comparable to that achieved in the United Kingdom and were also developing large-scale manufacturing companies; Britain's comparative economic advantage had lessened. The City of London remained the financial and commercial capital of the world, until challenged by New York after 1918. =1900‚Äì1914= The Edwardian era (1901‚Äì1910) stands out as a period of peace and plenty. There were no severe depressions and prosperity was widespread. Britain's growth rate, manufacturing output, and GDP (but not GDP per capita) fell behind its rivals the United States, and Germany. Nevertheless, the nation still led the world in trade, finance and shipping, and had strong bases in manufacturing and mining.Jean-Pierre Dormois and Michael Dintenfass, eds., The British Industrial Decline (1999) Growth in the mining sector was strong and the coal industry played a significant role as the focus of the world's energy market; this prominence was to be challenged after the First World War by the growth of the oil industry and continuing development of the internal combustion engine. Although the relative contribution of the agricultural sector was becoming less important, productivity in the British agriculture sector was relatively high. By international standards, and across all sectors of the United Kingdom, the British services sectors exhibited high labour factor productivity and, especially, total factor productivity; as was to be even more the case one hundred years later, it was the services sectors that provided the British economy's relative advantage in 1900. It has been suggested that the industrial sector was slow to adjust to global changes, and that there was a striking preference for leisure over industrial entrepreneurship among the elite. In 1910, the British share of world industrial capacity stood at 15%, just behind Germany's 16%, and less than half of the United States' 35%. Despite signs of relative weakness in certain sectors of the UK economy, the major achievements of the Edwardian years should be underlined. The City was the financial centre of the world‚Äîfar more efficient and wide-ranging than New York, Paris or Berlin. British investment abroad doubled in the Edwardian years, from ¬£2 billion in 1900 to ¬£4 billion in 1913. Britain had built up a vast reserve of overseas credits in its formal Empire, as well as in its informal empire in Latin America and other nations. The British held huge financial holdings in the United States, especially in railways. These assets proved vital in paying for supplies in the first years of the World War. Social amenities, especially in urban centres, were accumulating ‚Äì prosperity was highly visible. Among the working class there was a growing demand for access to a greater say in government, but the level of industrial unrest on economic issues only became significant about 1908. In large part, it was the demands of the coal miners and railway workers, as articulated by their trade unions, that prompted a high level of strike activity in the years immediately before the First World War. Arthur J Taylor, \\"The Economy,\\" in Simon Nowell- Smith, ed., Edwardian England: 1901-1914 (1964) pp105-138 =Labour Movement= The rise of a powerful, concerted, and politically effective labour movement was one of the major socio-economic phenomena of the Edwardian years in the UK. Trade union membership more than doubled during this time, from 2 million people in 1901 to 4.1 million in 1913. The Labour Party for the first time gained an active foothold in Parliament with the election of 30 Labour MPs in the 1906 General Election, enabling greater advocacy for the interests of the working classes as a whole. Striking dock workers in Liverpool, gathered for a protest during the summer of 1911. Inflation and stagnating wages began in 1908, which precipitated greater discontent among the working classes, particularly as the prosperity enjoyed by the middle and upper classes was becoming ever more visible. In that year, strikes increased precipitously, mainly in the cotton and shipbuilding industries where job-cuts had occurred. In 1910, with unemployment reaching a record-low of 3 percent, unions were emboldened by their bargaining power to make demands for higher wages and job stability. Strikes erupted throughout the nation - in the coal mining country of Wales and northeast England, the latter also experiencing a sustained railway workers' strike. In 1911 the National Transport Workers' Federation organized the first nationwide railway workers' strike, along with a general dockworker's strike in ports throughout the country. In Liverpool, the summertime strikes of the dock and transport workers culminated in a series of conflicts with the authorities between 13 and 15 August, leading to the death of two men and over 350 injured. In 1912 the National coal strike and another wave of transportation strikes cost the British economy an estimated 40 million working days. The major demands of the labour movement during these years were wage-rises, a national minimum wage, and greater stability in employment. The Liberal government in London did make some concessions in response to the demands of organized labour, most notably with the Trade Boards Act 1909, which empowered boards to set minimum wage requirements for workers, oversee working conditions, and limit working hours. At first this applied to a very limited number of industries like lace-making and finishing, but in 1912 boards were created for the coal mining industry and within a few years all \\"sweated labour\\" occupations were overseen by such boards, guaranteeing minimum wages and safer work environments. The coal strike of 1912 was so disruptive that the British government guaranteed a minimum wage for miners with separate legislation, the Coal Mines (Minimum Wage) Act 1912. =Tariff Reform= A Tariff Reform poster from 1910, encouraging Protectionism over the Free Trade of the Victorian Era In Edwardian Britain, proposals for tariff reform which had begun in the 1890s became a mass political movement with high visibility. The Tariff Reform League, founded in 1903 and headed by Britain's most outspoken champion of protectionism, Joseph Chamberlain, pushed for the implementation of tariffs to protect British goods in domestic and Imperial markets. Tariff reformers like Chamberlain were worried by what was seen as a deluge of American and German products entering the domestic market; they argued that part of the reason for the success of the U.S. and German economies were the national tariffs each imposed to protect fledgling industries from foreign competition. Without tariffs, it was claimed, vulnerable young industries like electrical goods, automobiles, and chemicals would never gain traction in Britain. A major goal of the Tariff Reform League was the foundation of an Imperial Customs Union, which would create a closed trade bloc in the British Empire and, it was hoped, fully integrate the economies of Britain and her overseas possessions. Under such an arrangement, Britain would maintain a reciprocal relationship whereby she would purchase raw materials from her colonies, the profits of which would allow them to buy finished goods from Britain, enriching both sides. Although it was a highly publicized and well-funded campaign, Tariff Reform never gained traction with the public at large. The defeat of Chamberlain's Liberal Unionist Party in the 1906 General Election, which returned a huge majority for free-trade stalwarts in the Liberal and Labour parties, was a resounding blow to the movement's electoral hopes, although the campaign itself persisted through the rest of the Edwardian period. =First World War= English factory workers producing shells for the war effort during the First World War. The First World War saw a decline of economic production, with a major reallocation to munitions. It forced Britain to use up its financial reserves and borrow large sums from the U.S.Steven Lobell, \\"The Political Economy of War Mobilization: From Britain's Limited Liability to a Continental Commitment,\\" International Politics (2006) 43#3 pp 283-304 Because of its prime importance in international finance, the entry of the UK into the war in August 1914 threatened a possible worldwide liquidity crisis. In Britain itself, there were fears of a run on the banks, which prompted the Treasury to take inflationary measures and begin printing 5 million new banknotes a day. To assuage nervous markets, a one-month moratorium on payments was declared, while the Bank of England agreed to guarantee the City of London's bills of exchange and to act as underwriter for London's Clearing houses. Shipments of American raw materials and food allowed Britain to feed itself and its army while maintaining her productivity. The financing was generally successful,M. J. Daunton, \\"How to Pay for the War: State, Society and Taxation in Britain, 1917-24,\\" English Historical Review (1996) 111# 443 pp. 882-919 in JSTOR as the City's strong financial position minimized the damaging effects of inflation, as opposed to much worse conditions in Germany.T. Balderston, \\"War finance and inflation in Britain and Germany, 1914-1918,\\" Economic History Review (1989) 42#2 p p222-244. in JSTOR Overall consumer consumption declined 18% from 1914 to 1919.B.R. Mitchell, Abstract of British Historical Statistics (1962) p 371 To raise vital funds for the war effort, taxation also increased dramatically. Whereas before the war the majority of tax revenue was derived from indirect taxation, by 1920 60% of tax revenue was from income and \\"super tax\\" levies, like the one imposed on incomes over ¬£10,000. Income tax had stood at just 6% before the war and only applied to 1.13 million Britons, by 1920 there were 3 million income tax payers at a rate of 30%. Britain also exploited its imperial resources to raise capital: India's 1917 excess export earnings were appropriated through a gift of ¬£100 million to the British war effort. In 1918 another ¬£45 million was appropriated to support the war. Trade unions were encouraged as membership grew from 4.1 million in 1914 to 6.5 million in 1918, peaking at 8.3 million in 1920 before relapsing to 5.4 million in 1923.B. R. Mitchell, Abstract of British Historical Statistics (1962) p 68 In Scotland, the shipbuilding industry expanded by a third. Women were available and many entered munitions factories and took other home front jobs vacated by men.Gail Braybon, Women Workers in the First World War: The British Experience (1990) =Interwar stagnation= The human and material losses of the World War in Britain were enormous. They included 745,000 servicemen killed and 24,000 civilians, with 1.7 million wounded. The total of lost shipping came to 7.9 million tons (much of it replaced by new construction), and ¬£7,500 million in financial costs to the Empire. Germany owed billions in reparations, but Britain in turn owed the U.S. billions in loan repayments. In 1919‚Äì1920 there was a short-lived boom in the British economy, caused by a rush of investment pent-up during the war years and another rush of orders for new shipping to replace the millions of tons lost. However, with the end of war orders, a serious depression hit the economy by 1921-22. Exports fell to half of their 1913 levels, and unemployment peaked at 17%. Factors explaining the economic depression are on one hand the return to prewar gold standard at parity or upcoming structural problems to the northern industrial core of the UK. Another factor contributing to the relative decline of British industry during the 1920s was the loss of Britain's export markets, mostly in the Far East and Latin America. The diversion of shipping and production towards the war effort between 1914 and 1918 meant that regional producers like the United States in Latin America or Japan in the Far East usurped important markets for British goods. Britain never regained its pre-1914 export volumes, by 1929 exports were still only 80% of what they had been in 1913. Indeed, even if Britain was far better off compared to the badly battered Continent, economic stagnation lasted the whole decade.N. K. Buxton, \\"Economic growth in Scotland between the Wars: the role of production structure and rationalization\\", Economic History Review, (Nov 1980) 33#4 pp. 538-55. Overall growth averaged 1.8% per annum during the 1920s, slightly weaker but comparable to the United States. Slow growth was due in part to Britain's heavy dependence on exports, and world trade grew sluggishly through the 1920s. It was also overly dependent on so- called \\"staple\\" industries, those which had brought huge prosperity in the 19th century but by the 1920s were experiencing faltering demand and strong competition from abroad. In 1922, for example, the volume of cotton exports was only about half of what it had been in 1913, while coal exports were only one third of their 1913 levels. The most skilled craftsmen were especially hard hit, because there were few alternative uses for their specialised skills.A. J. Robertson, \\"Clydeside revisited: A reconsideration of the Clyde shipbuilding industry 1919-1938\\" in W. H. Chaloner and B. M. Ratcliffe, eds., Trade and Transport: Essays in Economic History in Honour of T. S. Willan (Manchester University Press, 1977), pp. 258-78. In depressed areas the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.R. J. Finlay, \\"National identity in crisis: politicians, intellectuals and the 'end of Scotland', 1920-1939,\\" History, June 1994, vol. 79, (256), pp. 242-59. =Productivity & Employment= In 1919, Britain reduced the working hours in major industries to a 48-hour week for industrial workers. Historians have debated whether this move depressed labour productivity and contributed to the slump. Scott and Spadavecchia argue that productivity was in some ways enhanced, especially through higher hourly productivity, and that Britain did not suffer in its exports because most other nations also reduced working hours. Looking at coal, cotton, and iron and steel, they find that Britain did not suffer any significant relative productivity loss in these industries.Peter Scott and Anna Spadavecchia, \\"Did the 48-hour week damage Britain's industrial competitiveness?,\\" Economic History Review, (Nov 2011) 64#4 pp 1266-1288 By 1924 workers had regained their productive output of 1913, this while working greatly reduced hours compared to the pre-war years. By 1938 British industrial productivity had increased by 75% compared to pre-1914 levels, even after the setbacks of reduced working hours and the effects of the Great Depression were taken into account. Monetary policy of postwar governments also contributed to high unemployment. By April 1925, years of stringent deflationary policies by the British Exchequer had accomplished the intended goal of returning the Pound Sterling to its pre-war exchange rate of $4.86. This high exchange rate made for cheap consumer prices and a high real wage for UK workers. However, interest rates were also high as a result, making the cost of doing business all the more expensive, while high labour costs were inevitably offset by employers with layoffs and reduced hiring. By 1921, more than 3 million Britons were unemployed as a result of the postwar economic downturn. While the economy was recovering by 1922‚Äì1923, the UK found itself struggling again by 1926, the general strike of that year doing it no favours. Growth for the remainder of the decade became erratic, with brief periods of stagnation constantly interrupting growth. Industrial relations briefly improved, but then came the Wall Street stock market crash in October 1929, which sparked the worldwide Great Depression (See the Great Depression in the United Kingdom). Unemployment had stood at less than 1.8 million at the end of 1930, but by the end of 1931 it had risen sharply to more than 2.6 million. By January 1933, more than 3 million Britons were unemployed, accounting for more than 20% of the workforce - with unemployment topping 50% in some parts of the country, particularly in South Wales and the north-east of England. The rest of the 1930s saw a moderate economic recovery stimulated by private housing. The rate of unemployment fell to 10% in 1938 - half of the level five years previously. =Steel= From 1800 to 1870, Britain produced more than half of the world's pig iron, and its ironmasters continued to develop new steel making processes. In 1880, Britain produced 1.3 million tons of steel, 3 million tons in 1893 and by 1914 output was 8 million tons. Germany caught up in 1893 and produced 14 million tons in 1914.B. R. Mitchell, European historical statistics, 1750-1970 (1975) pp 399-401 After 1900, as the U.S. became the world's leading steel producing economy, British metallurgists pioneered the commercial development of special steels. Academic experts, such as Professor Oliver Arnold led research into the development of phospho- magnetic steels and other specialised high-strength alloys, using the electric furnace and other innovations, as well as reducing smoke pollution. The industry trained a cadre of experts that made large firms scientifically progressive.Michael Sanderson, \\"The Professor as Industrial Consultant: Oliver Arnold and the British Steel Industry, 1900-14,\\" Economic History Review, (Nov 1978) 31#4 pp 585-600 The leaders of the world's leading iron and steel companies continued to look to the London-based Iron and Steel Institute for the dissemination of cutting-edge scientific and technical research. =Coal= Politics became a central issue for the coal miners who contributed significantly to the growth of the labour and co-operative movements in major industrial centres such as south Yorkshire (including Sheffield), the West Midlands (the Black Country), Bristol, the Valleys of South Wales (Merthyr Tydfil) and the Central Lowlands of Scotland (Paisley); while some rural coal- mining communities could be insular, they also provided the bedrock of the Britain's industrial regions by providing locally produced fuel. 1888 saw the formation of an over-arching national organisation for the hitherto regionally based miners' unions, and by 1908 The Miners' Federation of Great Britain had 600,000 members. Many of the policies associated with the Labour Party's 'old left' had roots in coal-mining areas; in particular, the nationalisation of the coal industry.Vic Allen, The militancy of British miners (1981). =General Strike of 1926= The Spring of 1926 saw the British government refuse to extend again the subsidy that had bought short-term peace for the coal industry. In April 1926 the owners locked out the miners when they rejected the coal mine owners' demands for longer hours and reduced pay. The backdrop to the dispute was a fall in the price of coal, an important element of the general deflationary tendency after the end of the First World War which was exacerbated by the adoption of fuel oil in place of coal.W.N. Medlicott, Contemporary England, 1914-1964 (2nd ed. 1967) pp 223-30 The general strike was led by the TUC in support of the coal miners, but it failed. It was a nine-day nationwide walkout of one million railwaymen, transport workers, printers, dockers, ironworkers and steelworkers supporting the 1.5 million coal miners who had been locked out. The government had continued existing subsidies for an additional nine-months subsidy in 1925 seeking to achieve short-term peace in the coal industry. The TUC hope was the government would intervene to reorganise and rationalise the industry, and raise the subsidy. The Conservative government had stockpiled supplies and essential services continued with middle class volunteers. All three major parties opposed the strike. The general strike itself was largely non-violent, but the miners' lockout continued and there was violence in Scotland. It was the only general strike in British history and TUC leaders such as Ernest Bevin considered it a mistake. Most historians treat it as a singular event with few long-term consequences, but Martin Pugh says it accelerated the movement of working-class voters to the Labour Party, which led to future gains.Alastair Reid, and Steven Tolliday, \\"The General Strike, 1926,\\" Historical Journal (1977) 20#4 pp. 1001-1012 in JSTORMartin Pugh, \\"The General Strike,\\" History Today (2006) 56#5 pp 40-47 The Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927 made general strikes illegal and ended the automatic payment of union members to the Labour Party. That act was largely repealed in 1946. Coal continued as industry in slow decline as the best seams were used up and it became more and more difficult to mine the residue. The Labour government in 1947 nationalised coal with the creation of National Coal Board, giving miners access to control of the mines via their control of the Labour party and the government.Ben Fine, The Coal Question: Political Economy and Industrial Change from the Nineteenth Century to the Present Day (1990). By then, however, the best seams had played out and coal mining was headed downward. Coal production was 50 million metric tons in 1850, 149 million in 1880, 269 million in 1910, 228 million in 1940, and 153 million in 1970. The peak year was 1913, with an output of 292 million tons. Mining employed 383,000 men in 1851, 604,000 in 1881, and 1,202,000 in 1911; on the eve of the First World War in the United Kingdom ten workers, one was a coal miner.B. R. Mitchell, European Historical Statistics (1975) pp 361-8, 163 =New Industries= While Britain remained overly dependent on 'staple' heavy industries, the First World War had the advantage of stimulating production in new industries where the UK had lagged behind before 1914. Several of the new industries, including motorcars, chemicals, and rayon, were early recipients of tariff protection in the 1920s, prior to the Import Duties Act 1932. The interwar years saw new technologies develop at a breakneck pace, creating lucrative new industries including automobile, airplane, and motorbike manufacture. Before the First World War, automobile manufacture in Britain had been a boutique industry limited to producing expensive luxury cars. The industry produced 34,000 vehicles for the year 1913; by 1937 over half a million were being produced. Most of these were affordable models like the Austin 7 (introduced 1921), the Morris Minor (1928), as well as Model A and Model Y cars produced by Ford of Britain. The adoption of streamlined automation processes and the strong competition between manufacturers was responsible for a 50% drop in motorcar prices between the mid 20s and mid 30s, making cars more affordable (over 1 million were owned by 1930). The chemicals industry, once dominated by Germany and the United States, also thrived in the UK during the interwar years. By 1939 it employed 100,000 people and produced fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and synthetic materials. Electrical engineering also mushroomed: the establishment of the Central Electricity Board in 1926 enabled a nationwide high-voltage electrical grid to be developed. By 1939 two thirds of homes had electricity supply, which in turn opened up a new consumer market for electrically powered appliances like vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, radios and stoves. Between 1923 and 1938, the most successful new industries were: automobile production, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, metal goods, and printing. These created a net total of 557,920 new jobs between 1923 and 1938, some 96% of all new industrial jobs created in the interwar period. These industries were overwhelmingly concentrated in the communities surrounding London and cities in the West Midlands, particularly Coventry and Birmingham, where there was an established workforce skilled in the production of high quality metal goods. =1920s \\"consumer boom\\"= In spite of the serious problems that plagued heavy industry, the 1920s marked an era of unprecedented growth for the British consumer industry, until then a minor player in the national economy. While not creating a fully-fledged \\"consumer culture\\" as in the United States during the same decade, it had an important effect over British society, primarily on the middle classes which gained access to commodities previously reserved for the upper crust, primarily automobiles, ownership rising tenfold during the interwar period (from around 500,000 in 1919 to approximately over 3 million in 1929 and 5 million in 1939). Sales of electric appliances boomed thanks to the rise of consumer-oriented credit and loans. Higher wages and shorter working hours also led to the rise of recreation: Gramophone records, radio (or \\"the wireless\\" as it was referred), magazines and cinema became part of everyday life much like sports, primarily football and cricket. Tourism grew rapidly in the interwar years because of the rapidly rising number of motorized middle- class and lower-middle-class holidaymakers, as well as an influx of American tourists. Seaside resorts like Blackpool, Brighton and Skegness were particularly popular. However, those tourist sites that catered to the very wealthy (which now began holidaying abroad) or were located in depressed areas, all experienced a decline in profits, especially during the Great Depression.Rex Pope, \\"A Consumer Service in Interwar Britain: The Hotel Trade, 1924-1938,\\" Business History Review, (Winter 2000) 74#4 pp 657-82 Electricity, gas, plumbing and telephone services became common as well during the decade, even in some working class households. However, those living in the most remote and poorest parts of Britain saw little change in their living standards, with many Britons still living in terraced homes with outdoor toilets as late as the 1960s. =1929‚Äì1939: the Great Depression= Unemployed people in front of a workhouse in London, 1930 While the Wall St Crash of 1929 had little direct impact on the British stock market, the collapse of the American economy which it had foretold and the associated contraction of world trade seriously affected Britain in the early 1930s. Whereas British politicians had championed the concept of the free market when it was ascendant in the world economy, it gradually withdrew to adopting Tariff Reform as a measure of protectionism. In 1933 Sterling left the Gold Standard. By the early 1930s, the depression again signalled the economic problems the British economy faced. Unemployment soared during this period; from just over 10% in 1929 to more than 20% (or more than 3 million of the workforce) by early 1933. However, it had fallen to 13.9% by the start of 1936. While heavy industry sank to new lows, the consumer industry recovered by 1934 and production increased by 32% between 1933 and 1937. A good indication of the strong consumer market was the growth of retailers during the 1930s. Marks & Spencer, for example, increased its turnover from ¬£2.5 million in 1929 to over ¬£25 million in 1939, necessitating the opening of dozens of new locations to serve the burgeoning demand in the suburbs. In 1929 Ramsay MacDonald formed his second minority Labour Party government. In political terms, the economic problems found expression in the rise of radical movements who promised solutions which conventional political parties appeared unable to provide. In Britain this was seen with the rise of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) and the Fascists under Oswald Mosley. However, their political strength was limited and unlike in the rest of Europe, the conventional political parties did not face a significant challenge. In 1931 the Labour Government resigned having failed to agree cuts in national expenditure, disagreeing over the extent of cuts in welfare payments, to be replaced by a McDonald-led National Government. The Conservatives, which provided the majority of its MPs, was returned to power in 1935. =Second World War= In the Second World War, 1939‚Äì45, Britain had a highly successful record of mobilising the home front for the war effort, in terms of mobilising the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximising output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people.Robin Havers, The Second World War: Europe, 1939-1943 (2002) Volume 4, p 75 Much of this success was due to the systematic planned mobilisation of women, as workers, soldiers, and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription.W.K. Hancock, W.K. and M. Gowing, British War Economy (1949) The women supported the war effort, and made the rationing of consumer goods a success. Smoke billowing from London's Surrey Docks, after a destructive night-time bombing raid by the Luftwaffe on 7 September 1940. Industrial production was reoriented toward munitions, and output soared. In steel, for example, the Materials Committee of the government tried to balance the needs of civilian departments and the war effort, but strategic considerations received precedence over any other need.Peter Howlett, \\"Resource allocation in wartime Britain: The case of steel, 1939-45,\\" Journal of Contemporary History, (July 1994) 29#3 pp 523-44 Highest priority went to aircraft production as the RAF was under continuous heavy German pressure. The government decided to concentrate on only five types of aircraft in order to optimize output. They received extraordinary priority. Covering the supply of materials and equipment and even made it possible to divert from other types the necessary parts, equipment, materials and manufacturing resources. Labour was moved from other aircraft work to factories engaged on the specified types. Cost was not an object. The delivery of new fighters rose from 256 in April to 467 in September 1940‚Äîmore than enough to cover the losses‚Äîand Fighter Command emerged triumphantly from the Battle of Britain in October with more aircraft than it had possessed at the beginning.Postan (1952), Chapter 4. Starting in 1941 the U.S. provided munitions through Lend lease that totalled $15.5 billion.Hancock, British War Economy online p 353 After war broke out between Britain and Germany in September 1939, Britain imposed exchange controls. The British Government used its gold reserves and dollar reserves to pay for munitions, oil, raw materials and machinery, mostly from the U.S. By the third quarter of 1940 the volume of British exports was down 37% compared to 1935. Although the British Government had committed itself to nearly $10,000 million of orders from America, Britain's gold and dollar reserves were near exhaustion. The Roosevelt Administration was committed to large-scale economic support of Britain and in early 1941 enacted Lend-Lease, whereby America would give Britain supplies totalling $31.4 billion which never had to be repaid.There were some exceptions and $650 million was repaid.

UK annual balance of trade in goods since 1870 (¬£m) Trade in goods and services balance (U.K.) UK Trade with China (1999-2009) Although Britain achieved ultimate victory in the war, the economic costs were enormous. Six years of prolonged warfare and heavy losses of merchant shipping meant that Britain had lost two-thirds of her pre-war export trade by 1945. The loss of her export markets also caused a serious shortage of US dollars, which were crucial to servicing Britain's war debt and maintaining imports from the United States. Most of Britain's gold and currency reserves were depleted and the Government had been forced to sell off the bulk of British overseas assets to fund the war effort. When Lend Lease was terminated by the United States in August 1945, Britain was unable to pay for the import of essential supplies from America. Although the US agreed to cancel $20 million in Lend Lease debt, the UK was forced to obtain a $3.75 billion loan from the United States at 2% interest in December 1945. The US/UK trade imbalance was perilously high, forcing the extension of rationing to lessen the imbalance and preserve precious US dollars for the servicing of loan repayments. Successive governments squandered billions of Marshall Plan Aid to support British world power pretensions, and so jeopardised the economic future of Britain. The Labour government chose not to use the $2.7 billion (Germany received $1.7b) in aid for industrial modernization like Germany had. Germany rebuilt factories like the Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg. Germany, France and Italy were fully re-engineered with all electric rail lines. In Britain, steam engines, mechanical semaphore signalling and old track would remain into the 1960s. In addition, the road and telecommunications network in Britain remained equally inadequate, ill-maintained and out-of-date. By 1950-1 the UK still spent 7.7% of GNP on defence while Germany and Japan spent nothing. In the 1945 general election, just after the end of the war in Europe, the Labour Party led by Clement Attlee was elected with a landslide majority (its first ever outright majority), introducing sweeping reforms of the British economy. Taxes were increased, industries were nationalised, and the welfare state with the National Health Service, pensions, and social security was expanded. Most rations were lifted by 1950, with a few of them remaining until 1954. The next 15 years saw some of the most rapid growth Britain had ever experienced, recovering from the devastation of the Second World War and then expanding rapidly past the previous size of the economy. The economy went from strength to strength particularly after the Conservatives returned to government in 1951, still led by wartime leader Sir Winston Churchill until he retired to make way for Anthony Eden just before his party's re-election in 1955. However, the Suez crisis of 1956 weakened the government's reputation and Britain's global standing, and prompted Eden to resign in early 1957 to be replaced by Harold Macmillan. By 1959, tax cuts had helped boost living standards and allow for a strong economy and low unemployment, with October 1959 seeing the Tories win their third consecutive general election with a greatly increased majority, which sparked public and media doubt regarding Labour's chances of future election success. Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell then drew a new economic plan for the party, heavily based on the success of the centralised industries of France and West Germany, by the 1960s the latter's economy surpassing the UK for the first time since 1915 as Europe's largest economy. Harold Wilson and Anthony Wedgwood Benn further developed the idea, becoming the backbone of the party's manifesto for the 1964 election. Britain's economy remained strong with low unemployment into the 1960s, but towards the end of the decade this growth began to slow and unemployment was rising again. Harold Wilson, the Labour leader who had ended 13 years of Conservative rule with a narrow victory in 1964 before increasing his majority in 1966, was surprisingly voted out of power in 1970. The new Conservative government was led by Edward Heath. During the 1970s Britain suffered a long running period of relative economic malaise, dogged by rising unemployment, frequent strikes and severe inflation, with neither the Conservative government of 1970-1974 (led by Edward Heath) nor the Labour government which succeeded it (led by Harold Wilson and from 1976 James Callaghan) being able to halt the country's economic decline. Inflation exceeded 20% twice during the 1970s and was rarely below 10%. Unemployment exceeded 1 million by 1972 and had risen even higher by the time the end of the decade was in sight, passing the 1.5 million mark in 1978. The winter of 1978/79 brought a series of public sector strikes known as the Winter of Discontent, leading to the collapse of Callaghan's Labour government in March 1979 (two years after it had lost the three-seat parliamentary majority won in October 1974). This led to the election of Margaret Thatcher, who had succeeded Edward Heath as Conservative leader in 1975. She cut back on the government's role in the economy and weakened the power of the trade unions. The final two decades of the 20th century saw an increase in service-providers and a drop in manufacturing and heavy industry, combined with privatisation of some sections of the economy. This change has led some to describe this as a 'Third Industrial Revolution', though this term is not widely used. =1945‚Äì1951: Age of Austerity= After the end of World War II, the British economy had again lost huge amounts of absolute wealth. Its economy was driven entirely for the needs of war and took some time to be reorganised for peaceful production. Britain's economic position was relatively strong compared to its devastated European neighbors - in 1947 British exports were equivalent in value to the combined exports of France, West Germany, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Anticipating the end of the conflict, the United States had negotiated throughout the war to liberalise post-war trade and the international flow of capital in order to break into markets which had previously been closed to it, including the British Empire's Pound Sterling bloc. This was to be realised through the Atlantic Charter of 1941, through the establishment of the Bretton Woods system in 1944, and through the new economic power that the US was able to exert due to the weakened British economy.

The winter of 1946‚Äì1947 proved to be very harsh, with curtailed production and shortages of coal, which again affected the economy so that by August 1947, when convertibility was due to begin, the economy was not as strong as it needed to be. When the Labour Government enacted convertibility, there was a run on Sterling, as pounds were traded for dollars. This damaged the British economy and within weeks convertibility was abandoned. By 1949, the British pound was seen to be over valued and had to be devalued. The US dollar had become the world's premier currency. The major economic priority of post-war Britain was to raise exports to fund the UK's dollar deficit. This required the extension of rationing, as British goods and produce were prioritized for export markets. Unlike Continental European countries, where rationing was abandoned within a few years of the wars' end, Britain actually tightened rationing restrictions and didn't fully abandon them until 1954. The U.S. began Marshall Plan grants (mostly grants with a few loans) that pumped $3.3 billion into the economy and encouraged businessmen to modernize their approach to management.Michael J. Hogan, The Marshall Plan: America, Britain and the Reconstruction of Western Europe, 1947-1952 (1989) Marshall Aid, however, failed to have the desired effect of modernizing industry and stimulating the economy, because 97% of the funds were used to service British debt repayments. This left the UK at a comparative disadvantage to rivals like France and West Germany, who were able to invest the money directly into industry and infrastructure, creating more competitive, efficient economies in the long-term. =Nationalisation= The Labour Governments of 1945‚Äì1951 enacted a political programme rooted in collectivism that included the nationalisation of industries and state direction of the economy. Both wars had demonstrated the possible benefits of greater state involvement. This underlined the future direction of the post-war economy, and was also supported in the main by the Conservatives. However, the initial hopes for nationalisation were not fulfilled and more nuanced understandings of economic management emerged, such as state direction, rather than state ownership. With the extensive nationalisation programme achieved, Keynesian management of the UK economy was adopted. With the postwar Labour Governments, the first comprehensive attempts at economic planning were made with initiatives intended to overhaul chronically depressed regions of the UK. The Distribution of Industry Act 1945 designated \\"development areas\\" in northeast England, Scotland, and Wales according to the findings of the Barlow Report of 1940, which had recommended a complete economic overhaul of the troubled areas it pinpointed. Between 1945 and 1950, the British government pumped some ¬£300 million into the building of 481 new factories in these regions, to be leased to private industry. In addition there were 505 privately owned factories built in the troubled regions on the active encouragement of the government in London. This activity created an estimated 200,000 new jobs. The policy of nationalising the coal mines had been accepted in principle by owners and miners alike before the elections of 1945. The owners were paid ¬£165,000,000. The government set up the National Coal Board to manage the coal mines; and it loaned it ¬£150,000,000 to modernise the system. The general condition of the coal industry had been unsatisfactory for many years, with poor productivity. In 1945, there were 28% more workers in the coal mines than in 1890, but the annual output was only 8% greater. Young people avoided the pits; between 1931 and 1945 the percentage of miners more than 40 years old rose from 35% to 43%, and 24,000 over 65 years old. The number of surface workers decreased between 1938 and 1945 by only 3,200, but in that same time the number of underground workers declined by 69,600, substantially altering the balance of labour in the mines. That accidents, breakdowns, and repairs in the mines were nearly twice as costly in terms of production in 1945 as they had been in 1939 was probably a by-product of the war. Output in 1946 averaged 3,300,000 tons weekly. By summer 1946 it was clear that the country was facing a coal shortage for the upcoming winter with stock piles of 5 million tons too low. Nationalisation exposed both a lack of preparation for public ownership and a failure to stabilize the industry in advance of the change. Also lacking were any significant incentives to maintain or increase coal production to meet demand.Mark Tookey, \\"Three's a Crowd? Government, Owners, and Workers During the Nationalization of the British Coalmining Industry 1945-47,\\" Twentieth Century British History (2001) 12#4 pp 486-510 =Prosperity of the 1950s= The 1950s and 1960s were prosperous times and saw continued modernisation of the economy.Lawrence Black and Hugh Pemberton, eds. An Affluent Society?: Britain's Post-war 'Golden Age' Revisited (Gower, 2004). online review Representative was the construction of the first motorways, for example. Britain maintained and increased its financial role in the world economy, and used the English language to promote its educational system to students from around the globe. Unemployment was relatively low during this period, and the standard of living continued to rise, with more new private and council housing developments and the number of slum properties diminishing. Churchill and the Conservatives were back in power following the 1951 elections, but they largely continued the welfare state policies as set out by the Labour Party in the late 1940s. Butlins holiday camp in Pwllheli, Wales in the 1950s. Holiday camps symbolized the newfound prosperity and leisure of postwar Britain During the \\"golden age\\" of the 1950s and 1960s, unemployment in Britain averaged only 2%. As prosperity returned, Britons became more family centred.David Kynaston, Family Britain, 1951‚Äì1957 (2009) Leisure activities became more accessible to more people after the war. Holiday camps, which had first opened in the 1930s, became popular holiday destinations in the 1950s ‚Äì and people increasingly had the money to pursue their personal hobbies. The BBC's early television service was given a major boost in 1952 with the coronation of Elizabeth II, attracting a worldwide audience of twenty million, plus tens of millions more by radio, proving an impetus for middle-class people to buy televisions. In 1950, just 1% owned television sets; by 1965 25% did. As austerity receded after 1950 and consumer demand kept growing, the Labour Party hurt itself by shunning consumerism as the antithesis of the socialism it demanded.Peter Gurney, \\"The Battle of the Consumer in Postwar Britain,\\" Journal of Modern History (2005) 77#4 pp. 956‚Äì987 in JSTOR Small neighbourhood shops were increasingly replaced by chain stores and shopping centres, with their wide variety of goods, smart advertising, and frequent sales. Cars were becoming a significant part of British life, with city-centre congestion and ribbon developments springing up along many of the major roads. These problems led to the idea of the green belt to protect the countryside, which was at risk from development of new housing units.Willem van Vliet, Housing Markets & Policies under Fiscal Austerity (1987) The post-World War II period witnessed a dramatic rise in the average standard of living, with a 40% rise in average real wages from 1950 to 1965.Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, ed. A companion to contemporary Britain, 1939‚Äì2000 Workers in traditionally poorly paid semi-skilled and unskilled occupations saw a particularly marked improvement in their wages and living standards. In terms of consumption, there was more equality, especially as the landed gentry was hard pressed to pay its taxes and had to reduce its level of consumption. As a result of wage rises, consumer spending also increased by about 20% during the same period, while economic growth remained at about 3%. In addition, the last food rations were ended in 1954 while hire-purchase controls were relaxed in the same year. As a result of these changes, large numbers of the working classes were able to participate in the consumer market for the first time. Entitlement to various fringe benefits was improved. In 1955, 96% of manual labourers were entitled to two weeks' holiday with pay, compared with 61% in 1951. By the end of the 1950s, Britain had become one of the world's most affluent countries, and by the early Sixties, most Britons enjoyed a level of prosperity that had previously been known only to a small minority of the population.C.P. Hill, British Economic and Social History 1700‚Äì1964 For the young and unattached there was, for the first time in decades, spare cash for leisure, clothes, and luxuries. In 1959, Queen magazine declared that \\"Britain has launched into an age of unparalleled lavish living.\\" Average wages were high while jobs were plentiful, and people saw their personal prosperity climb even higher. Prime Minister Harold Macmillan claimed that \\"the luxuries of the rich have become the necessities of the poor.\\" As summed up by R. J. Unstead, :\\"Opportunities in life, if not equal, were distributed much more fairly than ever before and the weekly wage-earner, in particular, had gained standards of living that would have been almost unbelievable in the thirties.\\"R.J. Unstead, A Century of Change: 1837‚ÄìToday (1963) p 224 As noted by historian Martin Pugh: :\\"Keynesian economic management enabled British workers to enjoy a golden age of full employment which, combined with a more relaxed attitude towards working mothers, led to the spread of the two-income family. Inflation was around 4 per cent, money wages rose from an average of ¬£8 a week in 1951 to ¬£15 a week by 1961, home-ownership spread from 35 per cent in 1939 to 47 per cent by 1966, and the relaxation of credit controls boosted the demand for consumer goods.\\"Martin Pugh, Speak for Britain! A New History of the Labour Party (2011), pp 115‚Äì16 The number one selection for the housewife was a washing machine. Ownership jumped from 18 percent in 1955 to 29 percent in 1958, and 60 percent in 1966.Dominic Sandbrook, Never had it so good: a history of Britain from Suez to the Beatles (2005) p 112. By 1963, 82% of all private households had a television, 72% a vacuum cleaner, and 30% a refrigerator. John Burnett notes that ownership had spread down the social scale so that the gap between consumption by professional and manual workers had considerably narrowed. The provision of household amenities steadily improved in the late decades of the century. From 1971 to 1983, households having the sole use of a fixed bath or shower rose from 88% to 97%, and those with an internal WC from 87% to 97%. In addition, the number of households with central heating almost doubled during that same period, from 34% to 64%. By 1983, 94% of all households had a refrigerator, 81% a colour television, 80% a washing machine, 57% a deep freezer, and 28% a tumble-drier.John Burnett, A Social History of Housing 1815‚Äì1985 (1990) p 302 =Relative Decline= From a European perspective, however, Britain was not keeping pace. Between 1950 and 1970, it was overtaken by most of the countries of the European Common Market in terms of the number of telephones, refrigerators, television sets, cars, and washing machines per 100 of the population.Brian Lapping, The Labour Government 1964‚Äì70 Education provision expanded, but not as fast as in neighbouring European countries. By the early 1980s, some 80% to 90% of school leavers in France and West Germany received vocational training, compared with only 40% in the United Kingdom. By the mid-1980s, over 80% of pupils in the United States and West Germany and over 90% in Japan continued in education until the age of eighteen, compared with barely 33% of British pupils.David McDowall, Britain in Close-Up In 1987, only 35% of 16- to 18-year-olds were in full-time education or training, compared with 80% in the United States, 77% in Japan, 69% in France, and 49% in the United Kingdom.Anthony Sampson, The Essential Anatomy of Britain: Democracy in Crisis (1993) p 64 Economic growth in Britain, though steady through the 1950s, was not nearly as fast as on the continent. The statistics should be interpreted with care: Britain was far ahead of some other European nations in terms of economic development and urbanisation. Countries like Italy, France and Spain, overwhelmingly agrarian in character at the end of the Second World War, were experiencing a process of rapid industrialisation and urbanisation that Britain had already passed through in the 19th century. This explanation is known as the \\"early start theory\\" among economists, and explains why European nations showed markedly stronger levels of absolute growth in industry compared to the UK, a country which was already transitioning into a post- industrial, service-based economy.Brian Harrison, Seeking a Role: The United Kingdom 1951 ‚Äì 1970 (2009) p 305 These countries had large surplus agricultural populations to draw into the cities to work in factories, while the UK as the most heavily urbanised nation in Europe had only a mere 5% of the population employed on the land by 1945 (dropping to 2.7% by 1977). As such, the traditional source of new labour for low-wage factory work, rural labourers, was virtually non-existent in Britain and this constrained growth potential. Immigration from the Commonwealth, and later from Europe, was one policy response to this officially perceived labour shortage. There was also a systemic malaise in British industry, which was famously inefficient and opposed to innovations. Tony Judt described the prevailing attitude of post- war industrialists: \\"British factory managers preferred to operate in a cycle of under-investment, limited research and development, low wages and a shrinking pool of clients, rather than risk a fresh start with new products in new markets.\\" The overriding emphasis placed on exports by the British government, in its effort to repair the nation's dollar deficit, made things worse, because it encouraged manufacturers to place all investment in expanding output, at the expense of updating machinery, introducing new technologies, improving production methods, etc. This policy was sustainable in the short-term, because in the late 1940s and early 50s world trade boomed and Britain, with its large and relatively undamaged industrial base, was in a uniquely advantageous position to satisfy demand. In 1950, 25% percent of world exports were British-made, and the total volume of British manufactured goods was double that of France and Germany combined. However, by the late 1950s, the economies of West Germany, France, Japan, and Italy, had recovered from wartime infrastructure damage, replacing destroyed stock with state-of- the-art machinery and applying modern production methods in a process called \\"rejuvenation by defeat\\". Continental governments actively encouraged recovery through direct investment/subsidies in targeted industries, in the case of Italy and France, or more widely through encouraging easy access to credit through national banks, a marked characteristic in France and West Germany. British industrialists saw no such intervention from their own government, which more or less left the private sector to itself. British goods were also more expensive abroad because of Sterling's overvaluation, but inferior in quality compared to the products flooding the world market from the United States, Germany and Italy. Rapid decolonization in the British Empire through the late 1950s and 1960s dealt a further blow to British industry. Britain had enjoyed a virtual monopoly of the consumer markets within the Empire, enforced by the closed Pound Sterling Bloc, but it could not compete once the territories gained independence and were free to negotiate their own trade agreements. Suez Crisis Although the '50s were overall a time of prosperity for Britain, the Suez Crisis of November 1956 precipitated a financial crisis and a speculative run on Sterling which underlined the fragility of post-war British finances. The tripartite invasion of the Suez Canal Zone by Britain, France and Israel in late October 1956, following Egypt's nationalisation in July of the Suez Canal Company (hitherto, a French company, albeit one with a majority share holding owned by the British government) was a disaster for British prestige and the economy. The United States and the United Nations came out firmly against the occupation, which caused a run on Sterling as foreign governments withdrew their holdings and converted them into either the US Dollar or gold. In the run up to the invasion ¬£214 million was withdrawn by nervous investors and foreign governments. Britain's decision to freeze Egypt's holdings in response to the nationalization inspired panic in other foreign governments who feared their assets might be frozen if they supported the Egyptian cause. With the invasion a further ¬£279 million was withdrawn, leaving a scarce ¬£1.965 billion left in Sterling reserves. The Bank of England sought to prevent devaluation by purchasing the pound on foreign exchange markets, using up its precious dollar reserves in the process. By November dollar reserves had fallen beneath the $2 billion floor which the UK had sought to maintain since the late 1940s. Since the Canal was closed to shipping, the UK was reliant on imports of American oil, and devaluing the pound would make oil more expensive and possibly trigger serious inflation. Within days of the invasion, the UK had declared a cease-fire and Prime Minister Eden was appealing to the IMF for a $560 million loan, which was only granted on the condition that the country vacate the Canal Zone. This was agreed to, and Britain received a combined $1.3 billion in loans through the IMF and the American Export-Import Bank. British withdrawal from the Canal Zone was completed by 22 December, and the Pound returned to its pre-crisis parity with the Dollar by January 1957, but not without very nearly losing its value as an international reserve currency. =1960‚Äì1979: the Sixties and Seventies= Deindustrialisation The United Kingdom has experienced considerable deindustrialisation, especially in both heavy industry (such as mining and steel) and light manufacturing. New jobs have appeared with either low wages, or with high skill requirements that the laid-off workers lack. Meanwhile, the political reverberations have been growing.Tim Strangleman, James Rhodes, and Sherry Linkon, \\"Introduction to crumbling cultures: Deindustrialization, class, and memory.\\" International Labor and Working-Class History 84 (2013): 7-22. onlineSteven High, \\"'The Wounds of Class': A Historiographical Reflection on the Study of Deindustrialization, 1973‚Äì2013.\\" History Compass 11.11 (2013): 994-1007 Jim Tomlinson agrees that deindustrialisation is a major phenomenon but denies that it represents a decline or failure. The UK's share of global manufacturing output had risen from 9.5% in 1830, to 22.9% in the 1870s. It fell to 13.6% by 1913, 10.7% by 1938, and 4.9% by 1973. Overseas competition, trade unionism, the welfare state, loss of the British Empire, and lack of innovation have all been put forward as explanations for the industrial decline. It reached crisis point in the 1970s, with a worldwide energy crisis, high inflation, and a dramatic influx of low-cost manufactured goods from Asia. Coal mining quickly collapsed and practically disappeared by the 21st century. Railways were decrepit, more textile mills closed than opened, steel employment fell sharply, and the car-making industry suffered. Popular responses varied a great deal;For a detailed field study by an anthropologist, see Tim Strangleman et al. found a range of responses from the affected workers: for example, some invoked a glorious industrial past to cope with their new-found personal economic insecurity, while others looked to the European Union for help. Pdf. It has been argued that these reverberations contributed towards the popular vote in favour of Brexit in 2016. Economists developed two alternative interpretations to explain de-industrialization in Britain. The first was developed by Oxford economists Robert Bacon and Walter Eltis. They argue that the public sector expansion deprived the private sector of sufficient labour and capital. In a word, the government ‚Äúcrowded out‚Äù the private sector. A variation of this theory emphasizes the increases in taxation cut the funds needed for wages and profits. Union demands for higher wage rates resulted in lower profitability in the private sector, and a fall in investment. However, many economists counter that public expenditures have lowered unemployment levels, not increased them. Christopher Pick, ed., What's What in the 1980s (1982), pp 86-87.Robert Bacon and Walter Eltis, Britain's Economic Problem: Too Few Producers (2nd ed. 1978) excerpt. Robert Bacon and Walter Eltis, Britain‚Äôs economic problem revisited (Springer, 1996, second edition). The second explanation is the New Cambridge model associated with Wynne Godley and Francis Cripps.Francis Cripps, and Wynne Godley, \\"A formal analysis of the Cambridge economic policy group model.\\" Economica (1976): 335-348 online. It stresses the long-term Decline and competitiveness of British industry. During the 1970s especially, the manufacturing sector steadily lost its share of both home and international markets. The historic substantial surplus of exports over Imports slipped into an even balance. That balance is maintained by North Sea oil primarily, and to a lesser extent from some efficiency improvement in agriculture and service sectors. The New Cambridge model posits several different causes for the decline in competitiveness. Down to the 1970's, the model stresses bad delivery times, poor design of products, and general low-quality. The implication is that although research levels are high in Britain, industry has been laggard in implementing innovation. The model after 1979 points to the appreciation of sterling against other currencies, so that British products are more expensive. In terms of policy, the New Cambridge model recommends general import controls, or else unemployment will continue to mount.Francis Cripps, and Wynne Godley, \\"Control of imports as a means to full employment and the expansion of world trade: the UK's case.\\" Cambridge Journal of Economics 2.3 (1978): 327-334. The model indicates that deindustrialisation is a serious problem which threatens the nation's ability to maintain balance of payments equilibrium in the long run. The situation after North Sea oil runs out appears troublesome. De-industrialisation imposes that serious social consequences. Workers skilled in the manufacturing sector are no longer needed, and are shuffled off to lower paying, less technologically valuable jobs. Computerisation and globalisation are compounding that problem. Pick, What's What in the 1980s (1982), pp 86-878. Deindustrialisation meant the closure of many enterprises in mining, heavy industry and manufacturing, with the resulting loss of high paid working-class jobs. A certain amount of turnover had always taken place, with older businesses shutting down and new ones opening up. However, the post-1973 scene was different, with a worldwide energy crisis, and an influx of low-cost manufactured goods from Asia. Coal mining slowly collapsed, and finally disappeared in the 21st century. The railways were decrepit, more textile mills closed than opened, steel employment fell sharply, and the automobile industry practically disappeared, apart from some luxury production. There was a range of popular response.For a detailed field study by an anthropologist, see By the 21st century, grievances accumulated enough to have a political impact. The political reverberations came to a head in the unexpected popular vote in favour of Brexit in 2016. Stagnation While industry performance had remained strong in nearly 20 years following the end of the war, and extensive house building and construction of new commercial developments and public buildings also kept unemployment low throughout this time. As negative factors coalesced during the 1960s, the slogan used by Prime Minister Harold Macmillan \\"(most of) our people have never had it so good\\" seemed increasingly hollow. The Conservative Government presided over a ‚Äòstop-go‚Äô economy as it tried to prevent inflation spiralling out of control without snuffing out economic growth. Growth continued to be disappointing, at about only half the rate Germany or France achieved in the same period. In comparing economic prosperity (using gross national product per person), there was a common perception of continued relative economic decline; Britain slipped from seventh place in the world ranks of income per capita in 1950, to 12th in 1965, and to 20th in 1975. Labour politician Richard Crossman, after visiting prosperous Canada, returned to England with a \\"sense of restriction, yes, even of decline, the old country always teetering on the edge of a crisis, trying to keep up appearances, with no confident vision of the future.\\" Economists provided four overlapping explanations. The \\"early start\\" theory said that Britain's rivals were doing so well relatively because they were still moving large numbers of farm workers into more lucrative employment, structural change achieved in the UK in the 19th century. A second theory emphasised the \\"rejuvenation by defeat,\\" whereby Germans and Japanese managers and politicians had been forced to reequip, rethink and restructure their economies. The third approach emphasised the drag of \\"Imperial distractions\\", whereby Britain's responsibilities to its extensive, though rapidly declining empire handicapped the domestic economy, especially through defence spending, and economic aid. Finally, the theory of \\"institutional failure\\" stressed the negative roles of discontinuity, unpredictability, and class envy. The last theory blamed public schools, and universities perpetuating an elitist anti- industrial attitude while trade unions were regarded as traditionalist and conservative.Harrison, Seeking a Role pp 305-6 An additional factor, perhaps a feature of the social traditionalism, was the alleged disappointing performance of British management. Labour responds The result was a major political crisis, and a Winter of Discontent in the winter of 1978‚Äì1979 in during which there were widespread strikes by public sector unions that seriously inconvenienced and angered the public.Alwyn W. Turner, Crisis? What Crisis? Britain in the 1970s (2008)Andy Beckett, When the Lights Went Out: Britain in the Seventies (2009) excerpt and text search. Historians Alan Sked and Chris Cook have summarised the general consensus of historians regarding Labour in power in the 1970s: :If Wilson's record as prime minister was soon felt to have been one of failure, that sense of failure was powerfully reinforced by Callaghan's term as premier. Labour, it seemed, was incapable of positive achievements. It was unable to control inflation, unable to control the unions, unable to solve the Irish problem, unable to solve the Rhodesian question, unable to secure its proposals for Welsh and Scottish devolution, unable to reach a popular modus vivendi with the Common Market, unable even to maintain itself in power until it could go to the country and the date of its own choosing. It was little wonder, therefore, that Mrs. Thatcher resoundingly defeated it in 1979.Alan Sked and Chris Cook, Post-War Britain: A Political History (4th ed. 1993) p 324. The Labour Party under Harold Wilson from 1964 to 1970 was unable to provide a solution either, and eventually was forced to devalue the pound again in 1967. Economist Nicholas Crafts attributes Britain's relatively low growth in this period to a combination of a lack of competition in some sectors of the economy, especially in the nationalised industries; poor industrial relations and insufficient vocational training. He writes that this was a period of government failure caused by poor understanding of economic theory, short-termism and a failure to confront interest groups. Both political parties had come to the conclusion that Britain needed to enter the European Economic Community (EEC) in order to revive its economy. This decision came after establishing a European Free Trade Association (EFTA) with other, non EEC countries since this provided little economic stimulus to Britain's economy. Levels of trade with the Commonwealth halved in the period 1945‚Äì1965 to around 25% while trade with the EEC had doubled during the same period. Charles de Gaulle vetoed a British attempt at membership in 1963 and again in 1967. The general election in June 1970 saw the Conservatives, now led by Edward Heath, achieve a surprise return to government after the opinion polls had suggested a third successive Labour victory. Unemployment was still low by this stage, standing at 3% nationally. It was Heath who took the country into the EEC, in 1973.http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/brave_new_world/heath.htm However, with the continuing relative decline of Britain's economy during the 1960s, management-labour relations deteriorated towards the end of the Wilson government and this worker discontent led to a dramatic breakdown of the industrial environment under the Conservative Government of Edward Heath (1970‚Äì1974). In the early 1970s, the British economy suffered even more as strike action by trade unions, especially successful action by the miners' union, plus the effects of the 1973 oil crisis, led to a three-day week in 1973-74. However, despite a brief period of calm negotiated by the recently re-elected Labour Government of 1974 known as the Social Contract, a breakdown with the unions occurred again in 1978, leading to the Winter of Discontent, and eventually leading to the end of the Labour Government, then being led by James Callaghan, who had succeeded Wilson in 1976. Unemployment had also risen during this difficult period for the British economy; unemployment reached 1.5 million in 1978 - nearly triple the figure of a decade earlier, with the national rate exceeding 5% for the first time in the postwar era. It had not fallen below 1 million since 1975, and has remained above this level ever since, rarely dropping below 1.5 million. Also in the 1970s, oil was found in the North Sea, off the coast of Scotland, although its contribution to the UK economy was minimised by the need to pay for rising national debt and for welfare payments to the growing number of unemployed people. =1979‚Äì1990: the Thatcher era= The election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979 marked the end of the post-war consensus and a new approach to economic policy, including privatisation and deregulation, reform of industrial relations, and tax changes. Competition policy was emphasised instead of industrial policy; consequent deindustrialisation and structural unemployment was more or less accepted. Thatcher's battles with the unions culminated in the Miners' Strike of 1984. The Government applied monetarist policies to reduce inflation, and reduced public spending. Deflationary measures were implemented against the backdrop of the recession of 1980/81. Inflation was at its worst at over 20% in 1980, but by 1982-83 it had subsided to less than 10% and continued to subside until stabilizing at around 4% in the autumn of 1987. With the recession of 1980/81, unemployment passed 2 million in the autumn of 1980, 2.5 million the following spring. By January 1982, unemployment had reached 3 million for the first time since the early 1930s, though this time the figure accounted for a lesser percentage of the workforce than the early 1930s figures, now standing at around 12.5% rather than in excess of 20%. In areas hit particularly hard by the loss of industry, unemployment was much higher; coming close to 20% in Northern Ireland and exceeding 15% in many parts of Wales, Scotland and northern England. The peak of unemployment actually came some two years after the recession ended and growth had been re-established, when in April 1984 unemployment stood at just under 3.3 million. The development of a new financial centre at Canary Wharf was initiated by the Thatcher government to revitalize London's disused docklands area According to Eric Hobsbawm, Thatcher oversaw an \\"industrial holocaust\\", which saw Britain's industrial capacity decrease by fully one quarter during the years 1980‚Äì84. Major state-controlled firms were privatised, including British Aerospace (1981), British Telecom (1984), British Leyland (1984), Rolls-Royce (1987), and British Steel Corporation (1988). The electricity, gas and English water industries were split up and sold off. Exchange controls, in operation since the war, were abolished in 1979. British net assets abroad rose approximately ninefold from ¬£12 billion at the end of 1979 to nearly ¬£110 billion at the end of 1986, a record post-war level and second only to Japan. Privatisation of nationalised industries increased share ownership in Britain: the proportion of the adult population owning shares went up from 7% in 1979 to 25% in 1989.Nigel Lawson, The View from No. 11: Memoirs of a Tory Radical (Bantam, 1992), p. 207. The Single European Act (SEA), signed by Margaret Thatcher, allowed for the free movement of goods within the European Union area. The ostensible benefit of this was to give the spur of competition to the British economy, and increase its ultimate efficiency. The Financial Services Act 1986 led to a deregulation later dubbed as Big Bang. The early 1980s recession saw unemployment rise above three million, but the subsequent recovery, which saw annual growth of over 4 percent in the late 1980s, led to contemporary claims of a British 'economic miracle'. There is significant controversy as to whether Thatcherism was the reason for the boom in Britain in the 1980s; North Sea oil has been identified as a contributing factor in the increases in economic growth in the mid and late 1980s. However, many of the economic policies put in place by the Thatcher governments have been kept since, and even the Labour Party which had once been so opposed to the policies had by the late 1990s, on its return to government after nearly 20 years in opposition, dropped all opposition to them. Indeed, the Labour Party of the 1980s had taken a shift to the left after the election of Michael Foot as leader in 1980, leading to a split in the party to form the centrist Social Democratic Party, which formed an alliance with the Liberals and contested two general elections, with disappointing results, before merging in 1988 to form the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives were re-elected in 1983 and again in 1987, with a majority of more than 100 seats both times. By the end of 1986, Britain was in the first stages of an economic boom, which saw unemployment fall below 3 million and reach a 10-year low of 1.6 million by December 1989. However, the rate of economic growth slowed down in 1989, with inflation approaching 10% and fears of an imminent recession being rife in the national media. Interest rates were increased by the government in an attempt to control inflation. =1990‚Äì1997: the Major years= In November 1990, Margaret Thatcher stood down from the office of Prime Minister after losing first the confidence and then the support in Parliament of the Conservative Party's MPs, which she needed in order to continue. John Major was elected her successor. The government's popularity was also falling following the introduction of poll tax earlier that year, while unemployment was also starting to increase again as another recession loomed. Opinion polls were suggesting that the next general election could be won by Labour, led by Neil Kinnock since the resignation of Michael Foot in 1983. Despite several major economies showing quarterly detraction during 1989, the British economy continued to grow well into 1990, with the first quarterly detraction taking place in the third quarter of the year, by which time unemployment was starting to creep upwards again after four years of falling. The beginning of another recession was confirmed in January 1991. Interest rates had been increased between 1988 and 1990 to control inflation, which topped 10% in 1990 but was below 3% by the end of 1992. Economic growth was not re-established until early 1993, but the Conservative government which had been in power continuously since 1979 managed to achieve re-election in April 1992, fending off a strong challenge from Neil Kinnock and Labour, although with a significantly reduced majority. The early 1990s recession was officially the longest in Britain since the Great Depression some 60 years earlier, though the fall in output was not as sharp as that of the downturn of the Great Depression or even that of the early 1980s recession. It had started during 1990 and the end of the recession was not officially declared until April 1993, by which time nearly 3 million people were unemployed. The British pound was tied to EU exchange rates, using the Deutsche Mark as a basis, as part of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM); however, this resulted in disaster for Britain. The restrictions imposed by the ERM put pressure on the pound, leading to a run on the currency. Black Wednesday in September 1992 ended British membership of the ERM. It also damaged the credibility of the Conservative's reputation for economic competence, and contributed to the end of the 18 years of consecutive Conservative government in 1997. The party had long been divided over European issues and many of these rifts within the party had still not been mended by 1997. Despite the downfall of the Conservative government, it had seen a strong economic recovery in which unemployment had fallen by more than 1 million since the end of 1992 to 1.7 million by the time of their election defeat just over four years later. Inflation also remained low, with the ERM exit in 1992 being followed by a gradual decrease in interest rates during the years that followed. =1997‚Äì2001: New Labour= From May 1997, Tony Blair's newly elected Labour government stuck with the Conservatives' spending plans. The Chancellor, Gordon Brown, gained a reputation by some as the \\"prudent Chancellor\\" and helped to inspire renewed confidence in Labour's ability to manage the economy following the economic failures of earlier Labour governments. One of the first acts that the new Labour government embarked on was to give the power to set interest rates to the Bank of England, effectively ending the use of interest rates as a political tool. Control of the banks was given to the Financial Services Agency. Labour also introduced the minimum wage to the United Kingdom, which has been raised every year since its introduction in April 1999. The Blair government also introduced a number of strategies to cut unemployment, including an expansion of the public sector. Unemployment was constantly below 1.5 million during the first half of the 2000s ‚Äì a level not seen since the late 1970s, although the government never succeeded in getting unemployment back into the six figure tallies which were seen for most of the 30 years after the end of World War II. 21st century In the Labour Party's second term in office, beginning in 2001, when it achieved another landslide victory, the party increased taxes and borrowing. The government wanted the money to increase spending on public services, notably the National Health Service, which they claimed was suffering from chronic under-funding. The economy shifted from manufacturing, which had been declining since the 1960s and grew on the back of the services and finance sectors, while the public sector continued to expand. The country was also at war with first Afghanistan, invading in 2001 and then Iraq, in 2003 - which proved controversial with the British public. Spending on both reached several billion pounds a year and the government's popularity began to slide, although it did manage to win a third general election under Blair in 2005 with a reduced majority. Blair stepped down two years later after a decade as prime minister to be succeeded by the former Chancellor Gordon Brown, the change of leader coming at a time when Labour was starting to lag behind the Conservatives (led by David Cameron) in the opinion polls. By this stage, unemployment had increased slightly to 1.6 million although the economy continued to grow, the UK was continuing to lose large numbers of manufacturing jobs due to companies encountering financial problems or switching production overseas to save labour costs. This was particularly evident in the car industry, with General Motors (Vauxhall) and Ford having significantly cut back on UK operations, while Peugeot (the French carmaker who had bought the former Rootes Group and Chrysler Europe operations in the late 1970s) had completely withdrawn from Britain. These closures resulted in thousands of job losses, although the biggest single blow to the car industry came in 2005 when MG Rover went into liquidation; more than 6,000 jobs were lost at the carmaker alone and some 20,000 more were lost in associated supply industries and dealerships, not to mention the business failures and job cuts which befell businesses that had relied largely on trade from the carmaker's employees. This was the largest collapse of any European carmaker in modern times. Growth rates were consistently between 1.6% and 3% from 2000 to early 2008. Inflation though relativity steady at around 2%, did rise in the approach to the financial crash. The Bank of England's control of interest rates was a major factor in the stability of the British economy over that period. The pound continued to fluctuate, however, reaching a low against the dollar in 2001 (to a rate of $1.37 per ¬£1), but rising again to a rate of approximately $2 per ¬£1 in 2007. Against the Euro, the pound was steady at a rate of approximately ‚Ç¨1.45 per ¬£1. Since then, the effects of the Credit crunch have led to a slowdown of the economy. At the start of November 2008, for example, the pound was worth around ‚Ç¨1.26; by the end of the year, it had almost approached parity, dropping at one point below ‚Ç¨1.02 and ending the year at ‚Ç¨1.04. =The 2008 recession and quantitative easing= The UK entered a recession in Q2 of 2008, according to the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) and exited it in Q4 of 2009. The revised ONS figures of November 2009 showed that the UK had suffered six consecutive quarters of contraction.UK economy shrinks less than thought, BBC News, 25 November 2009 On 23 January 2009, Government figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that the UK was officially in recession for the first time since 1991. It entered a recession in the final quarter of 2008, accompanied by rising unemployment which increased from 5.2% in May 2008 to 7.6% in May 2009. The unemployment rate among 18- to 24-year-olds has risen from 11.9% to 17.3%.No way to start out in life The Economist, 16 July 2009 Although initially Britain lagged behind other major economies including Germany, France, Japan, and the US which all returned to growth in the second quarter of 2009, the country eventually returned to growth in the last quarter of 2009. On 26 January 2010, it was confirmed that the UK had left its recession, the last major economy in the world to do so. In the 3 months to February 2010 the UK economy grew yet again by 0.4%. In Q2 of 2010 the economy grew by 1.2% the fastest rate of growth in 9 years. In Q3 of 2010 figures released showed the UK economy grew by 0.8%; this was the fastest Q3 growth in 10 years. On 5 March 2009, the Bank of England announced that they would pump ¬£200 billion of new capital into the British economy, through a process known as quantitative easing. This is the first time in the United Kingdom's history that this measure has been used, although the Bank's Governor Mervyn King suggested it was not an experiment. The process will see the BoE creating new money for itself, which it will then use to purchase assets such as government bonds, bank loans, or mortgages. Despite the misconception that quantitative easing involves printing money, the BoE are unlikely to do this and instead the money will be created electronically and thus not actually enter the cash circulation system. The initial amount to be created through this method will be ¬£75 billion, although former Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling had given permission for up to ¬£150 billion to be created if necessary. It is thought the process is likely to occur over a period of three months with results only likely in the long term. The BoE has stated that the decision has been taken to prevent the rate of inflation falling below the two percent target rate. Mervyn King, the Governor of the BoE, also suggested there were no other monetary options left as interest rates had already been cut to their lowest level ever of 0.5% and it was unlikely they would be cut further. As of the end of November 2009, the economy had shrunk by 4.9%, making the 2008‚Äì2009 recession the longest since records began. In December 2009, the Office for National Statistics revised figures for the third quarter of 2009 showed that the economy shrank by 0.2%, compared to a 0.6% fall the previous quarter.Office for National Statistics.

Retrieved on 31 October 2011. However, GDP growth slowed to a fall of 0.1% in the April‚ÄìJune (second) quarter of 2008 (revised down from zero). In September 2008, the OECD forecast contraction for at least two quarters for the UK economy, possibly severe, placing its predicted performance last in the G7 of leading economies. Six quarters later the UK economy was still contracting, placing a question mark over OECD forecasting methods. It has been argued that heavy government borrowing over the past cycle has led to a severe structural deficit, reminiscent of previous crises, which will inevitably exacerbate the situation and place the UK economy in an unfavourable position compared to its OECD partners as attempts are made to stimulate recovery, other OECD nations having allowed greater room for manoeuvre thanks to contrasting policies of relatively tighter fiscal control prior to the global downturn. In May 2009 the European Commission (EC) stated: \\"The UK economy is now clearly experiencing one of its worst recessions in recent history.\\" The EC expected GDP to decline 3.8pc in 2009 and projected that growth will remain negative for the first three quarters of 2009.

Many commentators in the UK were certain that the UK would leave recession officially in Q3, believing that all the signs showed that growth was extremely likely, although in fact government spending had been insufficient to rescue the economy from recession at that point. Figures in fact showed no growth in retail sales in September 2009, and a 2.5% decline in industrial output in August. The revised UK figures confirmed that the economy shrank in Q3 of 2009 by 0.2%, although government spending on cash for the car scrappage scheme helped. The car scrappage scheme enabled owners of cars at least 10 years old to buy a new car at a reduced price in return for having their old car scrapped, and proved very popular with motorists. Yet this temporary lapse was followed by a solid 0.4% growth in the Q4. UK manufacturers' body, the EEF, appealed for more cash from the government: \\"Without an extension of support for business investment in the pre-Budget statement next month, it will be difficult to see where the momentum for growth will come from.\\" The downturn in the economy during 2008 and 2009 saw the popularity of the Labour government slump, and opinion polls all showed the Conservatives in the lead during this time, although by early 2010 the gap between the parties was narrow enough to suggest that the imminent general election would result in a hung parliament - as happened in May 2010. The Conservatives had the largest number of seats in the election, 20 short of a majority, and formed a government in coalition with the Liberal Democrats. The new government was faced with having to make deep public spending cuts over the following years in order to tackle the high level of national debt which had mounted up during Labour's response to the recession, which meant that unemployment remained high and the economy struggled to re-establish growth, although a marked improvement finally occurred in 2013 when economic growth and falling unemployment were sustained. Moody's maintained the UK's AAA credit rating in September 2010, forecasting stable finances largely driven by governmental action. It also reported that while the economy is flexible to grow in the future household debt repayments, a poor export market and the economy's large exposure to the finance sector were factors likely to sap growth. Subsequent to that, the economy contracted in 5 of the next 7 quarters, thus ensuring zero net growth from the end of the recession at the end of 2009, through to the middle of 2012. In 2010, the economy picked up and growing steadily however in the summer the euro-zone crisis centred on Greece led to a second slow down in all European countries. The euro-zone entered a double dip recession that lasted from Q1 2011 until Q2 2013, and while the UK had no double dip recession it did however experience stagnant growth. While the first half of 2012 saw inflationary pressures subside and business confidence increase, a number of fundamental weaknesses remain, most notably a decline in the productivity of British business. From Q2 2013, the UK's economy continued to grow for five consecutive quarters, the longest since Q1 of 2008, showing growth beating most developed economies helped by the rebound in the housing market and strong growth in both manufacturing and services industries. The IMF increased UK growth forecasts for 2014 from 1.9% to 2.4% in January 2014. Subsequently, inflation dropped to a low of 1.6% in Q1 2014., unemployment dropped to 6.8% (the lowest level since 2009) with impressive growth in employment leading to an all-time high of 30.4 million. The UK government posted a ¬£107.6 billion national deficit for the fiscal year ending March 2014, meeting the target of ¬£107.7 billion set a month previously. This was especially impressive since many countries in the EU, more specifically in the Euro, were stagnating such as France and Italy. However, it has been argued that the economic recovery is not reaching the majority of the people in the country, with wage growth not keeping up with inflation, however in 2014 it improved with wage growth outpacing inflation for the first time after six years. Historiography of Business in the United Kingdom George Unwin Business History in Britain emerged in the 1950s following the publication of a series of influential company histories and the establishment of the journal Business Historysee Business History in 1958 at the University of Liverpool. The most influential of these early company histories was Charles Wilson (historian)‚Äôs History of Unilever, the first volume of which was published in 1954. Other examples include D.C.Coleman's work on Courtaulds and artificial fibres, B.W.E. Alford on Wills and the tobacco industry, and T.C. (Theo) Barker on Pilkington's and glass manufacture.John Wilson, and Steven Toms, J.S ‚ÄòFifty years of Business History‚Äô, Business History (2008) 50#2 pp.125-26.

These early studies were conducted primarily by economic historians interested in the role of leading firms in the development of the wider industry, and therefore went beyond mere corporate histories. Although some work examined the successful industries of the industrial revolution and the role of the key entrepreneurs, in the 1960s scholarly debate in British business history became increasingly focused on economic decline. For economic historians, the loss of British competitive advantage after 1870 could at least in part be explained by entrepreneurial failure, prompting further business history research into individual industry and corporate cases. However, by 1970 this interpretation of 'Entrepreneurial failure' had been challenged by Cliometricians, notably by Deidre (ne Donald) N. McCloskey, who quantitatively assessed the productivity path of the British economy in a more favourable light. More traditional analysis presented by Peter Payne in 'British Entrepreneurship in the Nineteenth Century' presented a similar, though more deliberately nuanced, refutation of the thesis of \\"Entrepreneurial Failure\\"Peter L. Payne, British entrepreneurship in the 19th century]. Macmillan, 1974. One debate concerns the performance of firms in the Lancashire cotton textile industry. Often seen as the \\"leading sector\\" that propelled \\"economic take-off\\" of industrialisation, by 1890 its firms appeared relatively slow to invest in and adopt recent technological developments and demonstrated low levels of relative labour productivity by 1900. William Lazonick for example argued that cotton textile entrepreneurs in Lancashire. like their American cotton-textile producing counterparts, failed to develop the larger integrated plants found in other sectors of the American economy; a general conclusion proposed by Chandler in a number of comparative case studies.Chandler, A., Scale and Scope: The Dynamics of Industrial Capitalism, Cambridge Mass.: Belknap Press (1990).William Mass, & William Lazonick, \\"The British Cotton Industry and International Competitive Advantage: the state of the debates,\\" Business History, (1990) 32#4 pp. 9-65..Paradoxically, J. & P. Coats, a Scottish cotton manufacturing firm head-quartered in Paisley, Renfrewshire, not only achieved the industry's highest levels of productivity, in the world, let alone the United Kingdom, but the company also owned, amongst its impressive portfolio of subsidiaries, what was probably the best performing cotton manufacturing firm in the United States of American. While Lancashire may have failed, J. & P. Coats, the world's largest manufacturing company by equity market value in 1900, did not. With the economic performance of British businessmen before 1914 now viewed in a better informed and more balanced way, the critics turned to sociology to emphasise their position in the class structure, especially their supposed subordinate relationship to the aristocracy, and their desire to use their wealth to purchase landed estates, and acquire hereditary titles.Howard L.

Other research centres followed, including Reading, reflecting an increasing involvement in the discipline by Business and Management School academics. The journal Business History, reflected the widening ambition of the discipline as editors, first, Geoffrey Jones (academic)(Harvard Business School), Charles Harvey (University of Newcastle Business School), and more latterly, John Wilson (University of Newcastle Business School) and Steven Toms (Leeds University Business School) promoted management strategy themes such as: networks, family capitalism, corporate governance, human resource management, marketing and brands, and multi-national organisations in their international as well as merely British context. These new themes have allowed business historians to challenge and adapt the earlier conclusions of Alfred Chandler, Jnr. and others about British businessmen and the performance of the British economy.Toms, Steven and Wilson, John F. \\"Scale, Scope and Accountability: Towards a New Paradigm of British Business History,\\" Business History (2003) 45#4 pp 1-23.

Winner of the 3rd Golden Rooster Awards for Best Director, Best Music and Best Supporting Actress in 1983, the film was selected as China's entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 56th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Plot In the late 1920s, a six-year-old girl named Lin Yingzi (Shen Jie) lives on a hutong in the south of Beijing with her family - her father, her mother and her nurse. Her first friend is a mad woman Xiuzhen who is always standing at the hutong entrance waiting for her missing daughter Little Guizi. Xiuzhen fell in love with a young man in college years ago. However, the young man was arrested before she gave birth to their daughter, who was later abandoned by her family. Yingzi shows great sympathy for Xiuzhen. It turns out that Yingzi's friend Niu happened to be the daughter of Xiuzhen. Xiu is so excited that she cannot wait to take her daughter to her mother. The two then run off in the pouring rain to see the father. But unfortunately, they both die after being hit by a train. Yingzi and her family then move to another hutong. She befriends a young man with thick lips who becomes a thief to support his little brother's schooling. Yingzi thinks the young man is kind but is unsure if he is a good guy. He is later arrested by the police, which made Yingzi quite sad. When Yingzi is nine, the husband of her nurse comes for his wife. According to him, his son has died and his daughter was sold away two years ago. Yingzi becomes very sad and cannot understand why her nurse goes out to earn money instead of taking care of her own kids at home. Finally, Yingzi's dad dies of tuberculosis. After his death, Yingzi leaves Beijing with her mother and baby brother and bid farewell to all the memories of her childhood. Reception The film is little watched and distributed in the West; however, Time Out magazine praised the film, calling it \\"impressionistic, anecdotal and resonant\\", the result being \\"an immensely accessible and often tender film, sometimes betrayed by its visual and stylistic ambition but nonetheless consistently evocative, and full of a diffuse, affecting melancholy.\\"Time Out review of My Memories of Old Beijing.

These include extended musical improvisation over rhythmic grooves and chord patterns, and long sets of music which often cross genre boundaries. The jam- band musical style spawned from the psychedelic rock movement of the 1960s. The Grateful Dead and The Allman Brothers Band became notable for their live improvisational jams and regular touring schedules, which continued into the 1990s. This influenced a new wave of jam bands in the late 1980s and early 1990s, who toured the United States with jam band-style concerts, such as Phish, Blues Traveler, Widespread Panic, Dave Matthews Band, The String Cheese Incident, and Col. Bruce Hampton and the Aquarium Rescue Unit. The jam-band movement gained mainstream exposure in the US in the early 1990s following the rise of Phish and the Dave Matthews Band as major touring acts and the dissolution of the Grateful Dead following Jerry Garcia's death in 1995. Jam- band artists often perform a wide variety of genres. While the Grateful Dead is categorized as psychedelic rock,The Grateful Dead Britannica Online, Retrieved 17 September 2007 by the 1990s the term \\"jam band\\" was applied to acts that incorporated genres such as blues, country music, contemporary folk music, funk, progressive rock, world music, jazz fusion, Southern rock, alternative rock, acid jazz, bluegrass, folk rock and electronic music into their sound. Although the term has been used to describe cross-genre and improvisational artists, it retains an affinity to the fan cultures of the Grateful Dead or Phish.Relix, all issues. The third generation of jam bands appeared in the late 1990s and early 2000s, many inspired by Phish and other acts of the second wave. These included Umphrey's McGee, Dispatch, Assembly of Dust, Gov't Mule, O.A.R., The Breakfast, The Derek Trucks Band, Agents of Good Roots, Benevento/Russo Duo, and My Morning Jacket. Additionally, groups such as The Disco Biscuits and Sound Tribe Sector 9 added electronic and techno elements into their performances, developing the livetronica subgenre. The early 2010s saw a fourth generation of jam bands, including Dopapod, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, Twiddle, Moon Taxi and Spafford. Members of the Grateful Dead have continued touring since 1995 in many different iterations, such as The Dead, Bob Weir & Ratdog, Phil Lesh and Friends, Donna Jean Godchaux Band, 7 Walkers, Furthur and Dead & Company. Members of other jam bands often perform together in various configurations and supergroups, such as Tedeschi Trucks Band, Oysterhead, and Dave Matthews & Friends. A feature of the jam- band scene is fan taping or digital recording of live concerts. While the mainstream music industry often views fan taping as \\"illegal bootlegging\\", jam bands often allow their fans to make tapes or recordings of their live shows. Fans trade recordings and collect recordings of different live shows, because improvisational jam bands play their songs differently at each performance. By the 2000s, as internet downloading of MP3 music files became common, downloading of jam-band songs became an extension of the cassette taping trend. Bands also distribute their shows online, sometimes within days or hours.  History  =Modern use and definition= Phish is an example of a jam band. In the 1980s, the Grateful Dead's fan base included a large core group that followed their tours from show to show. These fans (known as \\"Deadheads\\") developed a sense of community and loyalty. In the 1990s, the band Phish began to attract this fan base. The term \\"jam band\\" was first used regarding Grateful Dead and Phish culture in the 1990s. In 1998, Dean Budnick wrote the first book devoted to the subject, entitled Jam Bands.Budnick, Dean (1998). He founded Jambands.com later that year and is often credited with coining the term.Peter Conners JAMerica: The history of the jam band and festival scene, Da Capo 2013 p. 68,70 However, in his second book on the subject, 2004's Jambands: A Complete Guide to the Players, Music & Scene, he explains that he only popularized it.Jambands, Dean Budnick, Backbeat Books, 2003, p. 241, JAMerica, p.79. Rolling Stone magazine asserted in a 2004 biography that Phish \\"was the living, breathing, noodling definition of the term\\" jam band, in that it became a \\"cultural phenomenon, followed across the country from summer shed to summer shed by thousands of new-generation hippies and hacky-sack enthusiasts, and spawning a new wave of bands oriented around group improvisation and super-extended grooves.\\" Another term for \\"jam band music\\" used in the 1990s was \\"Bay Rock\\". It was coined by the founder of Relix magazine, Les Kippel, as a reference to the 1960s San Francisco Bay Area music scene, which included the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and Moby Grape, among many others. By the late 1990s, the types of jam bands had grown so that the term became quite broad, as exemplified by the definition written by Dean Budnick, which appeared in the program for the first annual Jammy Awards in 2000 (Budnick co-created the show with Wetlands PreserveAlex Bereson A Night Out With: Peter Shapiro; Death of a Deadhead Dive nytimes.com 5 August 2001, Retrieved 2 February 2009 owner Peter Shapiro). Although in 2007 the term may have been used to describe nearly any cross-genre band, festival band, or improvisational band, the term retains an affinity to Grateful Dead-like bands such as Phish. Andy Gadiel, the initial webmaster of Jambands.com, states in Budnick's 2004 edition of Jambands that the music \\"...had a link that would not only unite bands themselves but also a very large community around them.\\"Jambands, Dean Budnick, Backbeat Books, 2003, p. 243. Ambiguity Cream performing in 1968 By the late 1990s, the term jam band became applied retroactively in jam band circles for bands such as Cream,Cream 2005 Pat Buzby, JamBands.com, 13 November 2005, Retrieved 10 September 2007 who for decades were categorized as a \\"power-trio\\" and \\"psychedelic rock\\", and who when active were largely unrelated to the Grateful Dead, but whose live concerts usually featured several extended collective improvisations. In his October 2000 column on the subject for jambands.com, Dan Greenhaus attempted to explain the evolution of a jam band as such: > At this point, what you sing about, what instruments you play, how often you > tour and how old you are has become virtually irrelevant. At this point, one > thing is left and, ironically, after all these years, it‚Äôs the single most > important place one should focus on; the approach to the music.

Dave Schools of Widespread Panic said in an interview, \\"We want to shake free of that name, jam band. The jam band thing used to be the Grateful Dead bands. We shook free of that as hard as we could back in 1989. Then Blues Traveler came on the scene. All together, we created the H.O.R.D.E. tour, which focused a lot of attention on jam bands. Then someone coined the term jam bands. I'd rather just be called retro. When you pigeonhole something, you limit its ability to grow and change.\\"Bob Makin Widespread Panic: Against the Grain jambands.com October 1999 An example of a prior-era band that gained the label \\"jam band\\" through an active affiliation with the 1990s jam band culture is The Allman Brothers Band. However, Gregg Allman has been quoted as recently as 2003 by his fellow band member Butch Trucks in stating that rather than being a jam band, The Allman Brothers are \\"a band that jams\\".Jambands, Dean Budnick, Backbeat Books, 2003, p. XII Although Trucks suggests that this is only a difference of semantics, the term has a recent history for which it is used exclusively. An example of this discernment is the acceptance of Les Claypool as a jam band in the year 2000. Though known for his decade with Primus (a band that jams) and solo works, it was after he created the Fearless Flying Frog Brigade with members of Ratdog and released Live Frogs Set 1 that as Budnick wrote had \\"marked [Claypool's] entry into [the jamband] world.\\"Jambands, Dean Budnick, Backbeat Books, 2003, pp 248-9 Budnick has been both editor-in-chief of Jambands.com and executive editor of Relix magazine.Melinda Newman \\"Jam Bands Weather Economic Uncertainty With Ingenuity and Loyal Fans,\\" Washington Post 9 August 2009, Blake Gernstetter \\"Relix Remix: Music Mag Relaunches Under New Ownership\\" Mediabistro.com, 4 May 2009 =Mid-1960smid-1980s: the Grateful Dead & The Allman Brothers Band= Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia and Mickey Hart performing on 11 August 1987 at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre near Morrison, Colorado The band that set the template for future jam bands was the Grateful Dead, founded in 1965 by San Francisco-based guitarist Jerry Garcia. The Dead attracted an enormous cult following, mainly on the strength of their live performances and live albums (their studio albums were only modest successes and received little radio play). Drawing inspiration from the Paul Butterfield Blues Band's improvisational 1966 epic \\"East-West\\" and Eric Clapton's supergroup Cream, the band specialized, in improvisational jamming at concerts. They played long two-set shows, and gave their fans a different experience every night, with varying set lists, evolving songs, creative segues, and extended instrumentals. Some of their fans, known as \\"Deadheads\\", followed their tours from city to city, and a hippie subculture developed around the band, complete with psychedelic clothes, a black market in concert- related products, and drug paraphernalia. The band toured regularly for most of three decades. The eventual heirs to this \\"Shakedown Street\\" fan culture, Phish, formed in 1983 at the University of Vermont. They solidified their lineup in 1985 and began their career with a few Grateful Dead songs in their repertoire. The Allman Brothers Band were also considered a jam band, particularly during the Duane Allman era. Songs such as \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\" and \\"Whipping Post\\", which were 5‚Äì7 minutes long on their studio albums, became 20-minute jams at concerts. The Allmans performed a 34-minute jam with the Grateful Dead in 1970. Their 1972 album Eat A Peach included \\"Mountain Jam\\", a 34-minute instrumental that was recorded live. The 1971 live album At Fillmore East featured a 24-minute version of \\"Whipping Post\\", and a 20-minute version of Willie Cobbs' \\"You Don't Love Me\\". =Mid-1980s1990= The Grateful Dead in 1980. Left to right: Jerry Garcia, Bill Kreutzmann, Bob Weir, Mickey Hart, Phil Lesh. The Grateful Dead grew their fanbase to nearly unmanageable levels in the second half of the 1980s. The party atmosphere of Grateful Dead shows drew in a new generation of fans, especially after they released \\"Touch of Grey\\" which became a hit song on MTV in 1987. They eventually began playing football stadiums, where fans turned the parking lots into campgrounds. In the mid-1980s and early-1990s, the bands Phish, moe., Edie Brickell & New Bohemians, Blues Traveler, Ozric Tentacles, Widespread Panic, Dave Matthews Band, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, Spin Doctors, The String Cheese Incident, Col. Bruce Hampton and the Aquarium Rescue Unit, Medeski Martin & Wood, The Black Crowes, Leftover Salmon, The Samples, Galactic, …ôkoostik hookah, and Lettuce, began touring with jam band- style concerts. Their popularity increased in the early 1990s. Widespread Panic originated when Michael Houser and John Bell started playing together. In 1986, after Todd Nance and Dave Schools joined them, the band played their first show as \\"Widespread Panic\\". Blues Traveler and Spin Doctors - formed and fronted by school friends John Popper and Chris Barron, respectively - regularly performed at the jam band-friendly venue Wetlands Preserve in New York City. In some cases, their improvisations have taken a backseat to more polished material, which may be due to their crossover commercial successes, MTV videos, and mainstream radio airplay. Most notable in pre-jam band history was the obvious influence of the Grateful Dead. By the end of the decade, Phish had signed a recording contract with Elektra Records, and transformed from a New England/Northeast-based band into a national touring band (see: Colorado '88). While they may not have had Phish's commercial success, \\"With its fusion of southern rock, jazz, and blues, Widespread Panic has earned renown as one of America's best live bands. They have often appeared in Pollstar's \\"Concert Pulse\\" chart of the top fifty bands on the road, and they have performed more than 150 live dates a year.\\" =1990‚Äì1995= Widespread Panic playing at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in 2010 In the early 1990s, a new generation of bands was spurred by the Grateful Dead's touring and the increased exposure of The Black Crowes, Phish, Widespread Panic and Aquarium Rescue Unit. Phish was building a large fan base and innovating new concepts into their shows. At the same time, the Internet gained popularity and provided a medium for fans to discuss these bands and their performances as well as to view emerging concepts. Phish (along with the Grateful Dead, Bob Dylan, and The Beatles) was one of the first bands to have a Usenet newsgroup. To capitalize on this, they experimented with new theatrics at shows, such as the Big Ball Jam (1992‚Äì1994), the Secret Language (from 1992), and the Audience Chess match (1995 tour). A rapidly expanding concert-going market in the early 1990s saw Phish playing mid-sized amphitheaters in 1993 and 1994. The band also played at large venues such as Madison Square Garden. Many new bands were formed, which were the first to actually be called \\"jam bands\\", including ekoostik hookah, Dispatch, Gov't Mule, One-Eyed Jack, Leftover Salmon, Jambay, moe., Rusted Root and The String Cheese Incident. During the summer of 1995, shortly after the Deer Creek gate crash, Garcia died. The surviving members of the Grateful Dead formed The Other Ones (appearing as \\"The Dead\\" for some tours). During the same period, Phish rose to prominence, and bands such as String Cheese Incident and Blues Traveler became successful. Man Deadheads migrated to the Phish scene, which became the top touring jam band and became recognized as more mainstream. =1996‚Äì2008: rise of Phish and music festivals= Phish performing at American Airlines Arena in Miami, 2009. The jam-band scene gained more recognition during the late 1990s, with Phish being the most influential band of the genre as it drew large crowds to amphitheaters and arenas. Their first major music festival on 16 and 17 August 1996 drew 70,000 fans and was the largest concert of the year. Phish celebrated the new millennium with an enormous festival called \\"Big Cypress\\" in southern Florida, which concluded with an eight-hour set. The final shows before their 2004 breakup were at the Coventry Festival in Vermont. As of 2015, Phish has played a total of ten multi-day camping festivals. Other jam bands followed the success of these festivals, notably the Disco Biscuits, who held their first Camp Bisco in 1999, and moe., which began its annual moe.down festivals in 2000. A consequence of Phish's repopularization of large-scale festivals can be seen in the founding of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in 2002. This multi-band, multi-day festival which annually draws close to 100,000 music fans, started as a jam band-focused event. Over time, bands from many genres have performed at Bonnaroo, but the similarities to Phish's festivals are still apparent. These and other music festivals held across the US have become an important part of the music industry, opening a new revenue stream to help bands compensate for the deteriorating compact disc market. =2004‚Äìpresent= There was no clear jam-band successor after Phish's 2004 breakup. Newer bands such as STS9, Disco Biscuits, and Umphrey's McGee grew their fanbase. No upcoming jam band has yet to reach the attendance levels of Phish, who themselves had never attained the peak attendance of the Grateful Dead. The long-term fragmentation of the jam-band scene has been a continuing process. Phish held a reunion concert in March 2009 at Hampton Coliseum, and again became one of the top US concert draws. The band were one of the highest-grossing touring musical artists of both 2016 and 2017, and their 13-night \\"Baker's Dozen\\" run at Madison Square Garden in 2017 grossed $15 million. Widespread Panic became the top jam band (by attendance) after Phish broke up in 2004. moe. has maintained a tightly knit fanbase, supported by steady touring and frequent festival appearances. String Cheese Incident has mixed bluegrass and electronic sounds to build a devoted fanbase as well. SCI has significantly reduced their touring schedule in recent years, giving each of their shows a special reunion vibe. Many of today's jam bands have brought widely varied genres into the scene. A jam band festival may include bands with electronic, folk rock, blues rock, jazz fusion, psychedelic rock, southern rock, progressive rock, acid jazz, hip hop, hard rock, reggae, and bluegrass sounds. The electronic trend has been led by such bands as The Disco Biscuits, Sound Tribe Sector 9 (STS9), Lotus, EOTO, The New Deal, and Dopapod. Bands like moe., Umphrey's McGee, Lettuce, Assembly of Dust, The Heavy Pets and The Breakfast have carried on the classic rock sound mixed with exploratory jams. Members of the Grateful Dead have continued touring in many different configurations as The Dead, Bob Weir & Ratdog, Phil Lesh and Friends, 7 Walkers, and Furthur. The British Intelligent dance music (IDM) band Autechre became known as \\"the first digital jam band\\" after their 4-hour long 2016 album set elseq 1-5. Blending jam-band elements with those of electronica is known as \\"jamtronica\\" or \\"livetronica\\" (a portmanteau of the terms \\"live music\\" and \\"electronica\\").Sixty second lesson on LivetronicaEW.com Bands includes The Disco Biscuits, STS9 (Sound Tribe Sector 9),Three Must-See Acts This Week - 01/23/2019 - SF Weekly and The New Deal (although STS9 guitarist Hunter Brown has expressed basic reservations about the \\"livetronica\\" label, explaining that \\"it's a really vague term to describe a lot of bands\\", he did cite Tortoise as stylistic precursors). Entertainment Weekly also identified Prefuse 73, VHS or Beta, Lotus, Signal Path, MFA, and Midwest Product as notable livetronica groups. Jam scene The contemporary jam scene has grown to encompass bands from a great diversity of musical genres. A 2000-era genre of jam-band music uses live improvisation that mimics the sounds of DJs and electronica musicians and has been dubbed \\"trancefusion\\" (a fusion between trance music and rock and roll). Progressive bluegrass and progressive rock are also quite popular among fans of jam bands. In the early 2000s, the jam scene helped influence the touring patterns and approach of a new wave of indie bands like Vampire Weekend, MGMT, Interpol, and The National.Greenhaus, Mike https://jambands.com/mike-greenhaus-the-greenhaus- effect/2009/06/09/smells-like-hippie-spiritrelix-uncovers-indie-rocks-true- jamband-roots/ Jambands.com Hundreds of jam-based festivals and concerts are held throughout the US. The Bonnaroo Music Festival, held each June in Tennessee, continues to provide a highly visible forum for jam acts, although this festival has attracted many different genres during its decade-plus history. As with other music scenes, devout fans of jam bands are known to travel from festival to festival, often developing a family-like community. These committed fan groups are often referred to by the derogatory terms \\"wookies\\" or \\"wooks\\". Taping A forest of microphone stands at a taper section at Telluride Bluegrass Festival in June 2007. Jam bands often allow their fans to record their live shows, a practice which many other musical genres view as \\"illegal bootlegging\\". The Grateful Dead encouraged this practice, which helped to create a thriving scene around the collecting and trading of recordings of their live performances. Most of the live shows on the Grateful Dead's 30 years of touring were recorded, and the trade in recordings is believed to have built the band's fan base. Starting in 1984, the band recognized the fact that people were already \\"unofficially\\" taping their shows, so they started to sell taper tickets for a taper's section, segregating these people with their equipment into one area of the venue to keep them from interfering with other concertgoers. This type of encouragement has spread to nearly all of the jam bands. Some jam-band enthusiasts argue that if a band does not allow fans to tape their live shows, this band is not a jam band in the Grateful Dead tradition. Improvisational jam bands perform their songs differently at each performance and generally have no fixed setlist, in order to encourage fans to see them on multiple nights. Some fans collect versions of their favourite songs and actively debate which is the best version of any particular song, keeping lists of notable version. This may extend to the song's relative rarity in setlists of differing eras. Some bands will play on this anticipation by adding little \\"teases\\" into their sets. For example, playing a few bars of a famous cover song or hinting at a popular jam and then either never getting actually playing the song, or coming back to it after an extended jam. The use of segues to blend strings of songs is another mark of a jam band, and one which makes for sought-after tapes. =Music downloading= By the 2000s, as internet downloading of MP3 music files became common, the downloading of jam-band songs became an extension of the cassette taping trend. Archived jam-band downloads are available at various websites, the most prominent ones being etree and the Live Music Archive, which is part of the Internet Archive. Some jam bands distribute their latest shows online. Bands such as Phish, Widespread Panic, The String Cheese Incident, Gov't Mule, ekoostik hookah, Umphrey's McGee, Dopapod, Lotus, and The Disco Biscuits have offered digital downloads within days, or sometimes hours, of concerts. The Grateful Dead have begun to offer live releases from their archives for download. While there is some conflict between free and open trading and buying the same material packaged by the artists, a dynamic equilibrium has been reached where die-hards trade and others are happy to pay for the convenience. Some concert venues offer kiosks where fans may purchase a digital recording of the concert and download it to a USB flash drive or another portable digital storage device. Some bands offer concert recordings made available for purchase on compact disc or flash drive shortly after the show ends. Most major music festivals also offer digital live recordings at the event. Several vendors such as Instant Live by Live Nation and Aderra offer this remote recording service for instant delivery. Although these shows are freely traded in digital format, \\"official\\" versions are collected by fans for the graphics, liner notes, and packaging. Venues and festivals All Good Music Festival, July 2011 In the August 2006 issue of Guitar One on jam bands, the following places were referred to as the \\"best places to see jam music\\": Red Rocks Amphitheatre, Red Rocks Park, Denver, CO; The Gorge Amphitheatre, George, Washington; High Sierra Music Festival, Quincy, CA; Saratoga Performing Arts Center, Saratoga Springs, NY; The Greek Theater, Berkeley, CA; Bonnaroo Music Festival (Bonnaroo has become increasingly mainstream in recent years, and has seen a shift in fan base), Manchester, TN; The Warfield Theater, San Francisco, CA; Higher Ground, Burlington, Vermont, Nelson Ledges Quarry Park, Garrettsville, Ohio; and the Jam in the Dam in Amsterdam. One way to see many jam bands in one place is by going to a jam band-oriented music festival. Some popular festivals that include jam bands are: Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee; Gathering of the Vibes in Bridgeport, Connecticut; Rothbury Festival in Rothbury, Michigan (now known as Electric Forest Festival; High Sierra Music Festival in Quincy, California; All Good Music Festival; Mountain Jam (festival) in Hunter Mt, New York; Telluride Bluegrass Festival in Colorado; Lockn' Festival in Arrington, Virginia; The Werk Out Music Festival in Thornville, Ohio; and Summer Camp Music Festival in Chillicothe, Illinois. Business model and copyright law Law professor Mark Schultz found that jam bands had fundamentally different business models from the mainstream music industry. This could be seen in the perceptions of their fans: Jam-band fans view themselves and the band as part of a shared community, which the band management serves. In comparison, fans of mainstream music \\"often portray band management as part of a ruthless industry that ... mistreats fans and musicians alike\\". Professor Tom R. Tyler considered the main law-enforcement strategies for copyright protection, finding that deterrence and process-based strategies could both be effective, but that the latter was more efficient. Jam bands encourage fans to bring recording equipment to live performances and give away copies of what they record. This practice may increase the sizes of their audiences and the total revenue received from concerts and the sale of recorded music. The fans reciprocate the generosity of the jam bands by helping enforce the copyright rules that the bands write, consistent with Tyler's \\"process-based\\" law enforcement. Schultz said the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) seems to call most fans pirates intent on stealing their music. Thus, the mainstream music industry attempts to maximize their revenue through deterring illegal sharing of music. [For more on the approach of the mainstream music industry to copyrights, see Free Culture (book).] Schultz said that the key concept here is reciprocity: Fans treated with generosity and respect by jam bands tend to be more loyal even to the point of helping enforce the copyrights the jam bands claim. Fans similarly reciprocate the hostility they perceive in the anti-piracy lawsuits filed by the mainstream recording industry. It is unclear which business model is most remunerative for music industry managers, but Schultz insisted that jam bands tend to have more loyal fans, and the mainstream music industry might benefit from following this model and treating their fans with more respect.

There was small Christian community here around the year 1890. In the year 1898, Capt. Fallon, the then O.C. of the 3rd Infantry of the Nizam's army, permitted the construction of a chapel (vide Lt. No. A/17-7-/43F/182. of Lieut. Col. Of 3rd Bn., Hyerabad. Infantry, dt. 20 Sept. 1938) to serve the personnel in A.C. Guards. In the year 1903, ‚Äòthe 3rd Infantry returned from Sholapur and was quartered here permanently‚Äô (vide letter of Mr. Caesar, Retired Troop Officer, Aug. 1920) And the Catholic Christian community became bigger. Fr. Malberti, the then Parish Priest of St. Joseph's Cathedral, mooted the idea of building a chapel in the year 1902 itself to cater to the needs of the Catholic soldiers of A.C. Guards and the 3rd Bn. Of the Infantry and their families. The construction of the chapel was started in May 1903 and it was completed by the end of December of the same year. It was, however, consecrated by Bishop Vigano on 10 January 1904 to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of the declaration of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception. The Chapel was originally known as the ‚Äò Church of Our Lady of Divine Grace‚Äô. A sum of Rs. 1028 and 13 Annas was the contribution received from different people, (including Rs. 5/- from Bishop Vignao and Rs. 5/- from Fr. Vimara, who later succeeded Bishop Vigano as Bishop of Hyderabad), towards the construction of the Chapel, though the actual cost of the construction was Rs. 3,500.00, according to Fr. Passoni, the 1st Parish Priest of Our Lady of Health Church (Ref. His letter dt. 11 June 1938 to the executive engineer). The Vestry, attached to the Church, was built later by late Fr. Cantaluppi during Fr. Pagani's tenure as Parish Priest of St. Joseph cathedral. Mass was offered in this chapel only on Sundays. The Annual Feast of \\"Our Lady of Health has been celebrated from the year 1904 with ‚Äòmuch grandeur‚Äô. It was during that time ‚Äòdumb box‚Äô collection was introduced and the 1st collection was Rs.50.00. ‚ÄòFr. Malberti‚Äô, said Mr. Caesar, ‚Äò was quite surprised at such a collection as he did not know what a ‚Äòdumb box‚Äô was‚Äô. Fr. Pagani became the Parish Priest of St. Joseph's Cathedral after Fr. Malberti. In a letter written on 12-10-1938 to the Commanding Officer of the H.E,H the Nizam's A.B.G.S., Fr. Magri, the then Parish Priest of St. Joseph's Cathedral, said that Fr. Pagani started, in 1912 a school ‚Äòfor Christian education of children unable to attend a Catholic School‚Äô. It was run in the Chapel till 1938. We do not know what happened to that school, as there is no mention of it later. ‚ÄòIn 1936, Fr. Passoni, an Italian priest who had to come to Hyderabad from China as the climate did not suit him, was asked to be in charge of Saifabad. In 1938 a residential quarter was built for him and he came to stay at Saifabad and looked after the needs of the community. In 1939, Fr. Passoni was interned during the war out of Hyderabad. In 1944 he was released and he came back to Saifabad but due to certain difficulties with Hyderabad Army, he was transferred towards the end of 1947. Fr. Xavier Roch, who for some time the Vice Principal of All Saints High School and Asst. Parish Priest at St. Joseph‚Äôs Cathedral, was asked to take charge of Saifabad Parish as its second Parish Priest. He remained Parish Priest of this place for 27 years till his untimely death on 14 August 1974. There is a little with regard to when the ‚ÄòNew Parish of Our Lady of Health‚Äô was started and who was the 1st Parish Priest was. Fr. Xavier Roch, in History of Khairtabad Parish, Said that \\"Fr. Passoni was appointed Parish Priest in 1939 and the Parish returned to the custody of the Cathedral during internship during the world war. But there is an official letter of erection of the ‚Äò New Parish of Our Lady of Health‚Äô signed by the then bishop of Hyderabad Rt. Rev. Vismara, dated 24 September 1941. Quote the letter of Bishop Vismara: \\" The New Parish of Our Lady of Health, Saifabad which has been separated from the Cathedral Parish of St. Joseph, Hyderabad and erected a New and independent on the 24th Sept 1941 has the following boundaries : 1\\\\. The Railway Line from Itenagar to Shankarapalli forms the Northern boundary. 2\\\\. The line drawn straight from Shankarpalli to Osmansagar forms the Western boundary. 3\\\\. The River Musi from Osmansagar to Muslim Jung forms the Southern boundary. 4\\\\. On the Eastern side, the new parish is separated from the Cathedral Parish of Hyderabad by the following Roads : Begum Bazar Road - Shah Inayat Gunj Road - Dargha Road - Custom‚Äôs Office - Broadguage Railway. Station - Road Crossing the Public Garden from the Western Gate to the Main gate - Mint Road - Hussain Sagar\\". The area of the new Parish was vast indeed. The Parish of Our Lady of Health has been a parent to many parishes after 1972. (1) St. Theresa's, Sanathnagar (2) St. Ignatius, Gagllapuram (3) Immaculate Heart of Mary Church, Basuregadi (4) St. Agnes Church, Shapurnagar (5) Immaculate Conception Church, Kukatpally (6) St. Michael's Church, Salar Jung Colony (7) St. Don Bosco Church, Himayat Sagar and (8) St. Alphonsus Church, Banjara Hills were all once part of Our Lady of Health Parish. \\"Saifabad was not new to Fr. Xavier Roch nor the people here, as he had been coming regularly from St. Joseph‚Äôs Cathedral to visit and celebrate Mass on Sundays. He soon found them responding to his activities\\". A school and a dispensary were started for the poor of the parish. In 1948, the Rev. Sisters of Charity were invited to look after the school and the dispensary. They have now grown into big institutions: Holy Mary High School and Vijay Marie Hospital. In 1950, as the then existing church was found too small for the congregation, a grotto was built, after obtaining due permission, where Sunday and Feast Masses were offered. In 1951, Fr. Roch asked for and obtained allotment of two plots of land from Govt, 1 (in front of the present church) measuring 3413.33 Sq. yards (vide Chief Secretary's letter No. 177/GAD-G/202/51 dated 11 May 1951 and the other plot of land (where Vijay Marie Hospital now stands) measuring 2971.44 Sq. yards of Army Land, allotted to the Church authorities (Vide letter No. 2731/129-L-51A, dated 12 April 1952) as the Church activities, including school and the dispensary needed more space. In 1951, a hospital with 20 beds was built and was called ‚ÄòVijay Marie Hospital‚Äô. The Doctor in-charge was Dr. I. De‚ÄôSouza, later known as Dr. Mrs. Rebello. The hospital was handed over to the Sisters of Charity. Since then additions to the building have sprung up and now is a hospital of 200 beds. (Vide Fr. Roch's History of Khairtabad Parish). Holy Mary School was handed over and shifted to the present spacious premises after being under the ‚ÄòTrees‚Äô in the Church premises for some time. In 1954, foundation stone was laid by late His Exalted Highness, the Nizam of Hyderabad, Mir Osman Ali Khan Fateh Jung, to a novel Octagonal Church on 27 December 1954. It took five years to complete and it was inaugurated by the same Nizam and blessed by the then Archbishop of Hyderabad, Most Rev. Mark Gopu, in the presence of five other bishops, on 15 September 1959. Fund for the construction came from the poor and the savings of the feast. The total cost came to around Rs. 1,50,000.00. About the same time, Sanathnagar, the industrial area needed help too. The Catholic there were scattered in and near the industrial area. Mass for those who could attend was offered in one of Allwyn Officer's House. In the meantime, J.M.J Sisters from Guntur were looking for a place in the city for the extension of their medical services and 12 acres of land was bought by them and their provincial was good enough to give permission to build a Church in their land, close to the main road. In two years time it was completed and blessed on 5 February 1968 by Archbishop Most. Rev. Mark Gopu of Happy Memory. The total cost of the construction of the Church was about Rs. 1,75,000.00. In 1973, Sanathnagar became a Parish, separated from Our Lady of Health Church, Khairatabad. There was an old tiled roof chapel, at Bazarghat, which was built on a plot of land measuring 800 yards2 given by the H.E.H. Nizam's army to build a Church for the Catholic men and their families serving 2nd Infantry of Nizam's Army. This Church was marked in the Municipal Survey of 1913. We do not know who built it and when. Municipal Land Tax exemption was given in 1962. This old church was in a dilapidated condition. It had to be rebuilt. In 1971, rebuilding work was undertaken and on 13 June 1973, the Church was blessed and inaugurated by Archbishop S Arulappa. The cost of the chapel was about Rs. 25,000.00. About this time, there was need for a parish hall; a 1st floor building was erected at the cost of Rs. 45,000.00 The pilgrims shed costing Rs. 25,000.00 was also put up in the Church premises. All funds came from the Church collection. Fr. Roch, in his ‚Äò History of Khairtabad Parish‚Äô, says in the concluding paragraph \\"Now with an energetic and active young priest, Fr. Y M Joseph, this year 1974, a Vijay Marie School, in the parish hall, has been started with only one class, the 4th standard, about 50 students are attending. He is now hard at work organizing the youth movement in the parish\\". Fr. Roch was not only a builder of buildings, but a builder of people and communities. He was constantly on his feet visiting people. It was when he was returning after such a family visitation, that he met with an accident at about 9.30 P.M. on 12 August 1974. He died on 14 August at 2.30 P.M. in Osmania Hospital. Now to continue with the rest of the history of the parish : Holy Mary School entertained boys only up to Class III and they were asked to find admission elsewhere for further studies. Girls in the parish had better opportunities than boys. Most of the boys dropped out of the school as ‚Äòthey could not get admission in Catholic Schools in Gunfoundry area‚Äô. In 1974, the then Asst. Parish Priest Fr. Y. M. Joseph was asked by the parents of four students to approach the Catholic schools in Gunfoundry for admission of their children who completed class III in Holy Mary. As admission was refused to them on various grounds, he asked the Parish Priest, Fr. Roch permission to start a school in the parish, Fr. Roch, encouraged him to start ‚ÄòVijay Marie School‚Äô as it was called and commenced on 13 June 1974 with 53 students in class IV. Later it was renamed Fr. Roch Memorial School during the meeting called to condole the death of Fr. Roch. Khairtabad Church has been since 1904, a Sacred Shrine of Our Lady of Health. The number of people visiting this Shrine increased. Attempts were made to build a parish hall and to create facilities to receive the pilgrims. One serious attempt was made in 1980, when Fr. Benny was Parish Priest. Foundation for the parish hall was laid by the then Archbishop Most. Rev. S Arullapa. But it just remained a dream. The construction project did not take off. In 1997, the Parish Pastoral Council members reminded the new Parish Priest Fr. Y M Joseph about the construction of a parish hall and the pilgrim center. The then Archbishop promised to support the project with financial help of 40% of the total cost. Though the financial help was not given, the construction was undertaken with the savings of the Shrine, the generous contribution of the people and a loan from HASSS, which will be paid back in due course of time. The construction of the ‚ÄòParish Pilgrim Center‚Äô was completed at the cost of Rs. 56,00,000.00. The history of Khairtabad Parish is entwined with the faithful life history of Fr. Roch, as a person and as priest. He will always remain in the minds of the people of Khairtabad even though many have not seen him but have only heard of him.

The building is owned by the federal government. Originally the press had their offices inside the Centre Block of the Parliament buildings. By the mid-1960s these areas had become overcrowded, and the large number of journalists based in desks lined against the walls of hallways were deemed a fire hazard. Thus the press were moved to their new home across the street. The Italian Renaissance building, originally named the Norlite Building, had been constructed in 1917-1919 and originally held several government agencies. Offices in the building are provided to journalists at cost by the federal government, with some other facilities remaining in the Centre Block. The building is home to a wide array of news agencies, both national and foreign, and all forms of media. The building is often described as \\"dingy\\" and the offices are very small, and many larger organizations thus choose to base their reporters elsewhere. In 2004, the CBC moved its parliamentary bureau from the building to the new CBC Ottawa Broadcast Centre. The National Press Club is situated on the second floor. From 2008 to 2010, the Global Television Network had the studio of its weeknight Global National newscast in a purpose- built green screen studio in the building. The only national newscast to be anchored in the nation's capital, the program was normally anchored by Kevin Newman who presented to cameras remotely controlled by producers in the network's Vancouver control centre.

The story follows a man who grows up in Oslo after World War II, with his mother, grandmother, great grandmother and half brother. The novel was published in Norwegian by Cappelen in 2001, and in English for the first time in 2003. It received the Brage Prize and the Nordic Council Literature Prize. A television series based on the novel was broadcast on NRK in 2013. Plot Vera Jebsen is raped in Fagerborg in Oslo, on liberation day 8 May 1945. She does not say a word during the entire pregnancy, not until she gives birth in a taxi. She names the child Fred. Arnold Nilsen from R√∏st in Lofoten, a circus artist and salesman, known as \\"The Wheel\\" after rolling spectacularly down a slope as a child, is allowed to move in with Jebsen's family, thanks to his self-confidence and his yellow Buick. Other than Vera and Fred, the family consists of Vera's mother, Boletta, and grandmother, known as The Old One; all in all four generations. Soon Vera has another child, whom they name Barnum Nilsen, after the master scam artist P. T. Barnum. Barnum is sharp but very short and therefore lacks confidence. He is impressed by Fred's rebellious attitude. He attends a dance class where he meets Peder and Vivian. After being sent out from the first lesson, the three meet and hang out every time their parents think they are dancing. The three become close friends and stay by themselves for the most time. Vivian becomes a kind of girlfriend for both of the boys. Fred and Barnum share the same bedroom. They often have confidential talks at night. Fred tries to influence Barnum to become tougher and go his own way. He hates Arnold, the stepfather, and tells Barnum that he rather would have been Barnum's father. Once, The Old One received a letter from Wilhelm, her fianc√©, who disappeared while hunting in the Arctic Ocean and Greenland. The letter means a lot for everybody in the family. Barnum often reads it to Fred, who is dyslexic. Fred begins to show more respect for Barnum and his ability to write down his dreams, and gives him a typewriter as a birthday gift. Fred's recognition means a lot to Barnum. Fred attempts at a career as a boxer. Barnum adopts a motto from his father: \\"The important is not what you see, but what you think you see\\". Barnum wins a writing competition in school which stimulates his desire to write. After coming in contact with the production of the film Hunger, based on Knut Hamsun's novel with the same title, Barnum decides to become a scriptwriter for film. Peder becomes his agent after returning from the United States. As a consequence of his grandmother's drinking habits, he develops an uncritical attitude to alcohol, which eventually leads to alcoholism. Publication The novel was published in Norway on 4 September 2001 through Cappelen. In August 2002 it had sold 226,000 copies in Norway. It was translated to English by Kenneth Steven. Arcadia Books published it in the United Kingdom in 2003, and Arcade Publishing in the United States in 2004. Reception =Critical response= √òystein Rottem of Dagbladet made comparisons between the novel and the works of Knut Hamsun, G√∂ran Tunstr√∂m and John Irving, but also called it \\"a true Saabye novel. Here he offers himself at full, puts his whole previous authorship at stake, in a single gigantic bet where he has raised the pot with everything from shelved five-√∏re coins to newly printed 1000-kroner bills, everyday memory glimpses and brightly polished metaphors.\\" He wrote that while there might be some longueurs which could have been trimmed, it is nothing that prevents the work from \\"pulling up, high up\\", and \\"give the readers a wealth of sparkling moments\\". Paul Binding of The Guardian described The Half Brother as a \\"phenomenally successful novel\\". Regarding the structure, he wrote that the author uses time and peripheral characters to \\"creatively disturb any conventional narrative forward motion\\", and that \\"Mystery is of the book's very essence, for all the clarity, the realism of the presentation.\\" Binding wrote: \\"The Half Brother - translated into compulsively readable prose by writer Kenneth Steven - is no mere interesting example of contemporary Scandinavian writing; it's a deeply felt, intricately worked and intellectually searching work of absolutely international importance.\\" Gerard Woodward wrote in The Daily Telegraph: \\"The Half Brother is the kind of big, ambitious, panoramic novel of the sort we tend to think only Americans write these days. It is part Bildungsroman ‚Äî depicting the coming of age of a writer ‚Äî part a Ulysses for Oslo, whose snowy parks and shadowy churches are vividly rendered.\\" Woodward also wrote: \\"The pace slackens at times, particularly towards the end but, for the most part, the language has enough energy and inventiveness to carry us along. A big, rewarding read.\\" =Accolades= The novel received the Brage Prize for Fiction for Adults. It won the Norwegian Booksellers' Prize for best book of the year; Saabye Christensen thereby became the first author to receive this prize twice, as he also had won in 1990 for the novel Bly. The Half Brother received the Nordic Council Literature Prize in 2002. The Adjudicating Committee described the winner as a \\"richly nuanced novel\\", with a story that has \\"a keynote of distance, loss and grief but has a redeeming feature of humour, friendship and black hope.\\" Adaptation Formal talks about an adaptation for Norwegian television started in 2002, and the project was approved in 2010. Produced for NRK by the production company Monster, the series consists of eight 50-minute episodes directed by Per-Olav S√∏rensen, and starring Frank Kjos√•s, Nicolai Cleve Broch, and Agnes Kittelsen. It premiered in January 2013. The series has been sold to 13 countries, including MHz Networks in the US.

The Tudors of Penmynydd () were a noble and aristocratic family, connected with the village of Penmynydd in Anglesey, North Wales, who were very influential in Welsh (and later English) politics. From this family arose Owen Tudor and thereby the Tudor dynasty, that ruled England from 1485 to 1603.Lowe, Walter Bezzant (1912). The Heart of Northern Wales. Llanfairfechan. p354. The Tudor dynasty came to an end in the 17th century. Origin and early generations The family descended from one of the sons of Ednyfed Fychan (died in 1246), the Welsh warrior who became seneschal to the Kingdom of Gwynedd in north Wales, serving Llywelyn the Great and later his son Dafydd ap Llywelyn. He claimed descent from Marchudd ap Cynan, Lord of Rhos and 'protector' of Rhodri the Great, king of Gwynedd, a founder of one of the so-called Fifteen Tribes of Wales. From Ednyfed's many sons would come a 'ministerial aristocracy' in northern Wales. He left the manors of Trecastell, Penmynydd and Erddreiniogin, Anglesey to those of his sons born to his second marriage to Gwenllian, daughter of king Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth, and among these sons was Goronwy (died 1268), founder of the line of the Tudors of Penmynyth. Goronwy served as seneschal of the last Gwynedd king, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. One of his sons, Tudur Hen (died 1311) would eventually submit to Edward I of England, and founded a Carmelite House of the White Friars in Bangor. In the next generation, Goronwy ap Tudur Hen (died 1331), likewise a patron of White Friars, was the father of Hywel ap Goronwy, Archdeacon of Anglesey, and of Sir Tudur ap Goronwy (died about 1367). They held Trecastell, along with a share of Penmynydd and Erddreiniog in Anglesey, plus lands in Cardiganshire. Owain Glynd≈µr era Tomb effigy of Goronwy ap Tudur, d. 1382, at St Gredifael, Penmynydd The sons of Sir Tudur, Goronwy ap Tudur, who was Forester of Snowdon and Constable of Beaumaris Castle, and his younger brothers Rhys ap Tudur and Gwilym ap Tudur, were among the personal retinue of Richard II of England. However, following that king's overthrow, Rhys, Gwilym and another brother, Maredudd ap Tudur, gave their allegiance to the rebel Owain Glynd≈µr, a nephew of one of their father's wives and descendant of the earlier native Welsh princes. Rhys was executed in 1412 at Chester, and following Glynd≈µr's demise much of the family's lands were taken by the English crown. The majority were then regranted to another branch of Ednyfed Fychan's lineage, the Griffiths of Penrhyn, whose head, Gwilym ap Griffith, had married Goronwy's daughter, Morfydd. Tudor dynasty The stained glass window at Penmynydd. The family is best known due to the descendants of a younger son. Owain Tudur (anglicised to Owen Tudor), the son of rebel Maredudd ap Tudor, would become a courtier, and secretly married Catherine of Valois, widowed Queen Consort of the Lancastrian King Henry V. Owen Tudor and Catherine of Valois had two sons, Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond (d. 1456), and Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford and Earl of Pembroke (d. 1495). Edmund Tudor was betrothed and married to Margaret Beaufort (1443‚Äì1509) daughter of John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset, a scion of the House of Lancaster. Edmund and Margaret had a sole son, Henry Tudor, born 28 January 1457 at Pembroke Castle in Wales. He was born posthumously, Edmund Tudor having died 1 or 3 November 1456. Henry Tudor grew up in south Wales and, following the downfall of the Lancastrian cause, in exile in Brittany. Henry's mother Margaret forged an alliance of dispossessed Lancastrians and discontented Yorkists, most notably Elizabeth Woodville, widow of King Edward IV, in support of her son, who landed in South Wales, gathered further troops through Wales and the Midlands and ultimately defeated Richard III at Battle of Bosworth on 22 August 1485, Henry proclaiming himself Henry VII, King of England, on the battlefield. After the battle, Henry VII married Elizabeth of York, the daughter of King Edward IV, granddaughter of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and the eldest surviving heir of the House of York and sister of the Princes in the Tower, Edward V and Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York. Henry and Elizabeth would have a long and happy marriage, having two sons who survived infancy, Arthur, Prince of Wales, who died in 1502 at the age of fifteen, and Henry, perhaps the most famed of Tudor monarchs. Henry VII and Elizabeth also had daughters, Margaret, queen consort of Scotland, and Mary, wife of Louis XII of France. Queen Elizabeth of York died in 1503 after giving birth to their last child Katherine, who did not survive. Henry VII died in 1509; his son Henry took the throne as King Henry VIII. Henry VIII eventually married his brother Arthur's widow Catherine of Aragon; they had only one surviving child, the future Mary I. After nearly twenty five years of marriage, Henry, with much trouble and causing much unrest, had his marriage to Catherine annulled, claiming the marriage as unlawful due to her being the widow of his brother, and splitting with the Roman Catholic Church in the process. This action brought about the birth of the English Reformation, and the eventual beginning of the Church of England. Henry then married his pregnant mistress Anne Boleyn on 28 May 1533. Anne gave birth to a daughter, the future Elizabeth I the following 7 September. On 19 May 1536, Henry had Anne executed for treason and adultery. Henry then married Jane Seymour on 30 May 1536, and she gave birth to a son, Edward, on 12 October 1537, but Jane died of a postpartum infection on 24 October. Henry VIII married three subsequent women: Anne of Cleves in January 1540, a marriage which was annulled soon after, Catherine Howard in July 1540, who would be executed for adultery, then Katherine Parr in July 1543. She would survive Henry and go on to raise Elizabeth before her death in 1548. After Henry VIII's death, his son assumed the throne as Edward VI, with his uncle Edward Seymour as Lord Protector. Edward died on 6 July 1553. Before his death, he had specified his succession, naming as his heir the teenage Lady Jane Grey. A granddaughter of Henry VIII's sister Mary, she had recently wed the son of Edward's chief minister, John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland. She was thus given precedence over Edward's half-sisters, Mary and Elizabeth, both declared illegitimate by their father's Second Act of Succession but readmitted to the succession by his will, which also bypassed the descendants of Henry's older sister, Margaret, in favor of those of her younger sister, Jane's grandmother Mary. Jane was proclaimed queen immediately following Edward's death, but Northumberland could not maintain her position against a groundswell of support for the dead king's half-sister as rightful heir, and Mary I was in turn proclaimed queen nine days later. She would be remembered as Bloody Mary for her ruthless persecution of Protestants during her reign. Mary married her cousin Philip II of Spain, but she died without issue in November 1558. The throne then went to Elizabeth I, Henry's daughter by Anne Boleyn, who would reign for forty five years. Elizabeth never married and had no issue, so the Tudor dynasty died with her in 1603. In total, five Tudor monarchs ruled England for 118 years, but issues around the Royal succession (including marriage, divorce, and the succession rights of women) became major political themes during the Tudor era. Elizabeth would be succeeded by her cousin, James VI of Scotland, who was doubly great-grandson of the excluded sister of Henry VIII, Margaret. Through him, the later English monarchs would carry Tudor blood. Second line Following Glynd≈µr's rebellion, the family's few remaining Penmynydd lands continued to be held by a line descended from the senior brother, Goronwy ap Tudur, who died 23 March 1382 leaving a minor son, Tudur, and a daughter Morfydd, wife of Gwilym ap Griffith of Penrhyn. Gwilym acted as guardian for his young brother-in-law, and following the latter's death, the lands passed into his own hands. After Morfydd's death, Gwilym had remarried to an English wife and would adjust the inheritance to pass most of his family properties to her sons. However, he also had a son by Morfydd, Tudur ap Gwilym, whose descendants would hold Penmynydd and retain a special status as recognized kin of the Tudor monarchs. His son, Owain, would take the surname Tudor. He had three sons, William, John and Richard Owen ap Tudor Fychan, the last eventually being the heir to the family in Penmynydd; he later appears as Richard Owen Theodor (or Theodore). He was followed at Penmynydd by a son and grandson both named Richard, one of whom would serve as Sheriff of Anglesey in 1565 and 1573. The third Richard was succeeded by his brother David Owen Theodor (died 1624), whose own son Richard served as Sheriff of Anglesey in 1623. He was father of another Richard Owen Theodor, the fifth, born 27 May 1611, who became Sheriff in 1657 and died in 1665. His son, the last Richard Owen Theodor (1645-1669), died without issue. His immediate heiress was his daughter Margaret Owen Theodor, wife of Coningsby Williams of Glan-y-gor, and after her childless death Penmynydd passed through her aunt, Mary Owen Theodor, wife of Rowland Bulkeley of Porthamel, to their son Francis, whose dissolute ways forced him to sell the inheritance to a Bulkeley cousin.

There is no definitive list. The historical period during which they flourished is referred to by scholars as the Patristic Era ending approximately around AD 700 (Byzantine Iconoclasm began in AD 726,Iconoclastic Controversy John of Damascus died in AD 749Saint John of Damascus). In the past, the Church Fathers were regarded as authoritative, and more restrictive definitions were used which sought to limit the list to authors treated as such. However, the definition has widened as scholars of patristics, the study of the Church Fathers, have expanded their scope. Great Fathers In the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church traditions there are four Fathers each who are called the \\"Great Church Fathers\\": =Western Church= * Ambrose (A.D. 340‚Äì397) * Jerome (347‚Äì420) * Augustine of Hippo (354‚Äì430) * Pope Gregory I (540‚Äì604) =Eastern Church= * Basil of Caesarea ( ‚Äì 379) * Athanasius of Alexandria ( ‚Äì 373) * Gregory of Nazianzus (329 ‚Äì ) * John Chrysostom (347‚Äì407) In the Catholic Church, they are also collectively called the \\"Eight Doctors of the Church\\", and in the Eastern Orthodox Church, three of them (Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus and John Chrysostom) are honored as the \\"Three Holy Hierarchs\\". Apostolic Fathers The Apostolic Fathers were Christian theologians who lived in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, who are believed to have personally known some of the Twelve Apostles, or to have been significantly influenced by them. Their writings, though popular in Early Christianity, were ultimately not included in the canon of the New Testament once it reached its final form. Many of the writings derive from the same time period and geographical location as other works of early Christian literature that did come to be part of the New Testament, and some of the writings found among the Apostolic Fathers' seem to have been just as highly regarded as some of the writings that became the New Testament. The first three, Clement, Ignatius and Polycarp, are considered the chief ones. =Clement of Rome= The First Epistle of Clement (), is the earliest extant epistle from a Church Father. In the epistle, Clement calls on the Christians of Corinth to maintain harmony and order. Copied and widely read in the Early Church,Elliott, John. 1 Peter. Doubleday, Toronto, 2000. Page 138. First Clement had been considered by some as part of the New Testament canon, e.g., listed as canonical in Canon 85 of the Canons of the Apostles, among other early canons of the New Testament, showing that it had canonical rank in at least some regions of early Christendom. As late as the 14th century Ibn Khaldun mentions it as part of the New Testament.. =Ignatius of Antioch= Ignatius of Antioch (also known as Theophorus) ( ‚Äì )See \\"Ignatius\\" in The Westminster Dictionary of Church History, ed. Jerald Brauer (Philadelphia:Westminster, 1971) and also David Hugh Farmer, \\"Ignatius of Antioch\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of the Saints (New York:Oxford University Press, 1987). was the third bishop of Antioch and a student of the Apostle John. En route to his martyrdom in Rome, Ignatius wrote a series of letters which have been preserved. Important topics addressed in these letters include ecclesiology, the sacraments, the role of bishops, and the Incarnation of Christ.EPISTLE OF IGNATIUS TO THE MAGNESIANS, chapter IX He is the second after Clement to mention Paul's epistles. =Polycarp of Smyrna= Polycarp of Smyrna ( ‚Äì ) was a Christian bishop of Smyrna (now ƒ∞zmir in Turkey). It is recorded that he had been a disciple of \\"John\\". The options/possibilities for this John are John, the son of Zebedee, traditionally viewed as the author of the Gospel of John, or John the Presbyter. Traditional advocates follow Eusebius of Caesarea in insisting that the apostolic connection of Polycarp was with John the Evangelist and that he was the author of the Gospel of John, and thus the Apostle John. Polycarp tried and failed to persuade Pope Anicetus to have the West celebrate Passover on the 14th of Nisan, as in the Eastern calendar. Around A.D. 155, the Smyrnans of his town demanded Polycarp's execution as a Christian, and he died a martyr. The story of his martyrdom describes how the fire built around him would not burn him, and that when he was stabbed to death, so much blood issued from his body that it quenched the flames around him. Polycarp is recognized as a saint in both the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. =Papias of Hierapolis= Very little is known of Papias apart from what can be inferred from his own writings. He is described as \\"an ancient man who was a hearer of John and a companion of Polycarp\\" by Polycarp's disciple Irenaeus (). Eusebius adds that Papias was Bishop of Hierapolis around the time of Ignatius of Antioch. In this office, Papias was presumably succeeded by Abercius of Hierapolis. The name Papias was very common in the region, suggesting that he was probably a native of the area. The work of Papias is dated by most modern scholars to about A.D. 95‚Äì120. Despite indications that the work of Papias was still extant in the Late Middle Ages, the full text is now lost. Extracts, however, appear in a number of other writings, some of which cite a book number. Greek Fathers Those who wrote in Greek are called the Greek (Church) Fathers. In addition to the Apostolic Fathers, famous Greek Fathers include: Justin Martyr, Irenaeus of Lyons, Clement of Alexandria, Athanasius of Alexandria, John Chrysostom, Cyril of Alexandria, the Cappadocian Fathers (Basil of Caesarea, Gregory Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa), Peter of Sebaste, Maximus the Confessor, and John of Damascus. =Justin Martyr= Justin Martyr was an early Christian apologist, and is regarded as the foremost interpreter of the theory of the Logos in the 2nd century.Rokeah (2002) Justin Martyr and the Jews p.22. He was martyred, alongside some of his students, and is considered a saint by the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Oriental Orthodox Churches. =Irenaeus of Lyons= Irenaeus was bishop of Lugdunum in Gaul, which is now Lyon(s), France. His writings were formative in the early development of Christian theology, and he is recognized as a saint by both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church. He was a notable early Christian apologist. He was also a disciple of Polycarp. His best-known book, Against Heresies (c.180) enumerated heresies and attacked them. Irenaeus wrote that the only way for Christians to retain unity was to humbly accept one doctrinal authority‚Äîepiscopal councils. Irenaeus proposed that the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John all be accepted as canonical. =Clement of Alexandria= Clement of Alexandria was the first member of the church of Alexandria to be more than a name, and one of its most distinguished teachers. He united Greek philosophical traditions with Christian doctrine and valued gnosis that with communion for all people could be held by common Christians. He developed a Christian Platonism. Like Origen, he arose from Catechetical School of Alexandria and was well versed in pagan literature. =Origen of Alexandria= Origen, or Origen Adamantius ( ‚Äì ) was a scholar and theologian. According to tradition, he was an Egyptian who taught in Alexandria, reviving the Catechetical School where Clement had taught. The patriarch of Alexandria at first supported Origen but later expelled him for being ordained without the patriarch's permission. He relocated to Caesarea Maritima and died thereAbout Caesarea after being tortured during a persecution. He was later anathematised and some of his writings condemned as heretical. Using his knowledge of Hebrew, he produced a corrected Septuagint. He wrote commentaries on all the books of the Bible. In Peri Archon (First Principles), he articulated the first philosophical exposition of Christian doctrine. He interpreted scripture allegorically and showed himself to be a stoic, a Neo-Pythagorean, and a Platonist. Like Plotinus, he wrote that the soul passes through successive stages before incarnation as a human and after death, eventually reaching God. He imagined even demons being reunited with God. For Origen, God was not Yahweh but the First Principle, and Christ, the Logos, was subordinate to him. His views of a hierarchical structure in the Trinity, the temporality of matter, \\"the fabulous preexistence of souls\\", and \\"the monstrous restoration which follows from it\\" were declared anathema in the 6th century.The Anathemas Against Origen, by the Fifth Ecumenical Council (Schaff, Philip, \\"The Seven Ecumenical Councils\\", Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Series 2, Vol. 14. Edinburgh: T&T; Clark)The Anathematisms of the Emperor Justinian Against Origen (Schaff, op. cit.) Prior to this, he was not considered heretical. =Athanasius of Alexandria= St. Athanasius, depicted with a gospel book, an iconographic symbol used mostly for priests and bishops as preachers of the gospel. Athanasius of Alexandria ( ‚Äì 373) was a theologian, Pope of Alexandria, and a noted Egyptian leader of the 4th century. He is remembered for his role in the conflict with Arianism and for his affirmation of the Trinity. At the First Council of Nicaea (325), Athanasius argued against the Arian doctrine that Christ is of a distinct substance from the Father. =Cappadocian Fathers= The Cappadocian Fathers are Basil the Great (330‚Äì379), who was bishop of Caesarea; Basil's younger brother Gregory of Nyssa ( ‚Äì 395), who was bishop of Nyssa; and a close friend, Gregory of Nazianzus (329‚Äì389), who became Patriarch of Constantinople. The Cappadocians promoted early Christian theology and are highly respected in both Western and Eastern churches as saints. They were a 4th-century monastic family, led by Macrina the Younger (324‚Äì379) to provide a central place for her brothers to study and meditate, and also to provide a peaceful shelter for their mother. Abbess Macrina fostered the education and development of her three brothers Basil the Great, Gregory of Nyssa and Peter of Sebaste ( ‚Äì 391) who became bishop of Sebaste. These scholars set out to demonstrate that Christians could hold their own in conversations with learned Greek-speaking intellectuals. They argued that Christian faith, while it was against many of the ideas of Plato and Aristotle (and other Greek philosophers), was an almost scientific and distinctive movement with the healing of the soul of man and his union with God at its center. They made major contributions to the definition of the Trinity finalized at the First Council of Constantinople in 381 and the final version of the Nicene Creed. Subsequent to the First Council of Nicea, Arianism did not simply disappear. The semi-Arians taught that the Son is of like substance with the Father (homoiousios), as against the outright Arians who taught that the Son was unlike the Father (heterousian). So the Son was held to be like the Father but not of the same essence as the Father. The Cappadocians worked to bring these semi-Arians back to the Orthodox cause. In their writings they made extensive use of the formula \\"three substances (hypostases) in one essence (homoousia)\\", and thus explicitly acknowledged a distinction between the Father and the Son (a distinction that Nicea had been accused of blurring) but at the same time insisting on their essential unity. =John Chrysostom= John Chrysostom ( ‚Äì ), archbishop of Constantinople, is known for his eloquence in preaching and public speaking; his denunciation of abuse of authority by both ecclesiastical and political leaders, recorded sermons and writings making him the most prolific of the eastern fathers, and his ascetic sensibilities. After his death (or according to some sources, during his life) he was given the Greek epithet chrysostomos, meaning \\"golden mouthed\\", rendered in English as Chrysostom.Pope Vigilius, Constitution of Pope Vigilius, 553 Chrysostom is known within Christianity chiefly as a preacher and theologian, particularly in the Eastern Orthodox Church; he is the patron saint of orators in the Roman Catholic Church. Chrysostom is also noted for eight of his sermons that played a considerable part in the history of Christian antisemitism, diatribes against Judaizers composed while a presbyter in Antioch, which were extensively exploited and misused by the Nazis in their ideological campaign against the Jews.Walter Laqueur, The Changing Face of Antisemitism: From Ancient Times To The Present Day, (Oxford University Press: 2006), p.48. . 48 Patristic scholars such as Robert L Wilken point out that applying modern understandings of antisemitism back to Chrysostom is anachronistic due to his use of the Psogos. The Psogos, along with the encomium, were both rhetorical techniques used in the ancient world in a polemical context. With the encomium \\"one passes over a man's faults in order to praise him, and in a psogos, one passed over his virtues to defame him. Such principles are explicit in the handbooks of the rhetors, but an interesting passage from the church historian Socrates, writing in the mid-fifth century, shows that the rules for invective were simply taken for granted by men and women of the late Roman world\\"John Chrysostom and the Jews: Rhetoric and Reality in the Late 4th Century, by Robert L. Wilken (University of California Press: Berkeley, 1983), p. 112. Chrysostom's sermons along with Basil the Great's have greatly influenced the Christian Church's understanding of economic and distributive justice for the poor, being cited extensively by the Catechism of the Catholic Churchhttps://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a7.htm as well as Pope Francis in his own sermons critiquing modern-day forms of capitalismhttps://catholicexchange.com/st-john-chrysostom-pope-francis- commonhttps://sojo.net/articles/what-st-john-chrysostom-can-teach-us-about- social-justice =Cyril of Alexandria= Cyril of Alexandria ( ‚Äì 444) was the Bishop of Alexandria when the city was at its height of influence and power within the Roman Empire. Cyril wrote extensively and was a leading protagonist in the Christological controversies of the late 4th and early 5th centuries. He was a central figure in the First Council of Ephesus in 431, which led to the deposition of Nestorius as Archbishop of Constantinople. Cyril's reputation within the Christian world has resulted in his titles \\"Pillar of Faith\\" and \\"Seal of all the Fathers\\". =Maximus the Confessor= Maximus the Confessor (also known as Maximus the Theologian and Maximus of Constantinople) ( ‚Äì 662) was a Christian monk, theologian, and scholar. In his early life, he was a civil servant and an aide to the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius. However, he gave up this life in the political sphere to enter into the monastic life. After moving to Carthage, Maximus studied several Neo-Platonist writers and became a prominent author. When one of his friends began espousing the Christological position known as Monothelitism, Maximus was drawn into the controversy, in which he supported the Chalcedonian position that Jesus had both a human and a divine will. Maximus is venerated in both Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity. His Christological positions eventually resulted in his torture and exile, soon after which he died. However, his theology was vindicated by the Third Council of Constantinople, and he was venerated as a saint soon after his death. His feast day is celebrated twice during the year: on 21 January and on 13 August. His title of Confessor means that he suffered for the faith, but not to the point of death, and thus is distinguished from a martyr. His Life of the Virgin is thought to be the earliest complete biography of Mary, the mother of Jesus. =John of Damascus= John of Damascus ( ‚Äì 749) was a Syrian Christian monk and priest. Born and raised in Damascus, he died at his monastery, Mar Saba, near Jerusalem. A polymath whose fields of interest and contribution included law, theology, philosophy, and music, before being ordained, he served as a chief administrator to the Muslim caliph of Damascus, wrote works expounding the Christian faith, and composed hymns which are still in use in Eastern Christian monasteries. The Catholic Church regards him as a Doctor of the Church, often referred to as the Doctor of the Assumption because of his writings on the Assumption of Mary. Latin Fathers Those fathers who wrote in Latin are called the Latin (Church) Fathers. =Tertullian= Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus ( ‚Äì ), who was converted to Christianity before 197, was a prolific writer of apologetic, theological, controversial and ascetic works. He was born in Carthage, the son of a Roman centurion. Tertullian denounced Christian doctrines he considered heretical, but later in life adopted Montanism, regarded as heretical by the mainstream Church, which prevented his canonization. He wrote three books in Greek and was the first great writer of Latin Christianity, thus sometimes known as the \\"Father of the Latin Church\\".Vincent of Lerins in 434 AD, Commonitorium, 17, describes Tertullian as 'first of us among the Latins' (Quasten IV, p.549) He was evidently a lawyer in Rome. He is said to have introduced the Latin term trinitas with regard to the Divine (Trinity) to the Christian vocabularyA History of Christian Thought, Paul Tillich, Touchstone Books, 1972. (p. 43) (but Theophilus of Antioch already wrote of \\"the Trinity, of God, and His Word, and His wisdom\\", which is similar but not identical to the Trinitarian wording),To Autolycus, Book 2, chapter XV and also probably the formula \\"three Persons, one Substance\\" as the Latin \\"tres Personae, una Substantia\\" (itself from the Koine Greek \\"œÑœÅŒµ·øñœÇ ·ΩëœÄŒøœÉœÑŒ¨œÉŒµŒπœÇ, ·ΩÅŒºŒøŒøœçœÉŒπŒøœÇ; treis Hypostases, Homoousios\\"), and also the terms vetus testamentum (Old Testament) and novum testamentum (New Testament). In his Apologeticus, he was the first Latin author who qualified Christianity as the vera religio, and systematically relegated the classical Roman Empire religion and other accepted cults to the position of mere \\"superstitions\\". Later in life, Tertullian joined the Montanists, a heretical sect that appealed to his rigorism. He used the early church's symbol for fish‚Äîthe Greek word for \\"fish\\" being ŒôŒßŒòŒ•Œ£ which is an acronym for ŒôŒ∑œÉŒø·ø¶œÇ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑœåœÇ, ŒòŒµŒø·ø¶ Œ•·º±œåœÇ, Œ£œâœÑŒÆœÅ (Jesus Christ, God's Son, Saviour)‚Äîto explain the meaning of baptism since fish are born in water. He wrote that human beings are like little fish. =Cyprian of Carthage= Cyprian ( ‚Äì 258) was bishop of Carthage and an important early Christian writer. He was born in North Africa, probably at the beginning of the 3rd century, perhaps at Carthage, where he received an excellent classical (pagan) education. After converting to Christianity, he became a bishop and eventually died a martyr at Carthage. He emphasized the necessity of the unity of Christians with their bishops, and also the authority of the Roman See, which he claimed was the source of \\"priestly unity\\"'. =Hilary of Poitiers= Hilary of Poitiers ( ‚Äì ) was Bishop of Poitiers and is a Doctor of the Church. He was sometimes referred to as the \\"Hammer of the Arians\\" () and the \\"Athanasius of the West\\"/ His name comes from the Latin word for happy or cheerful. His optional memorial in the Roman Catholic calendar of saints is 13 January. In the past, when this date was occupied by the Octave Day of the Epiphany, his feast day was moved to 14 January. =Ambrose of Milan= AmbroseKnown in Latin and Low Franconian as Ambrosius, in Italian as Ambrogio and in Lombard as Ambroeus. was an archbishop of Milan who became one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the 4th century. He was a governor before becoming bishop. He is counted as one of the four original doctors of the Church. He offered a new perspective on the theory of atonement. =Pope Damasus I= Pope Damasus I (305‚Äì384) was active in defending the Catholic Church against the threat of schisms. In two Roman synods (368 and 369) he condemned the heresies of Apollinarianism and Macedonianism, and sent legates (papal representatives) to the First Council of Constantinople that was convoked in 381 to address these heresies. He also wrote in defense of the Roman See's authority, and inaugurated use of Latin in the Mass, instead of the Koine Greek that was still being used throughout the Church in the west in the liturgy. = Jerome of Stridonium = Print of Jerome in his study. Preserved in the Ghent University Library. Jerome ( ‚Äì 420) is best known as the translator of the Bible from Greek and Hebrew into Latin. He also was a Christian apologist. Jerome's edition of the Bible, the Vulgate, is still an important text of Catholicism. He is recognised by the Roman Catholic Church as a Doctor of the Church. =Augustine of Hippo= Augustine (354‚Äì430), Bishop of Hippo, was a philosopher and theologian. Augustine, a Latin Father and Doctor of the Church, is one of the most important figures in the development of Western Christianity. In his early life, Augustine read widely in Greco-Roman rhetoric and philosophy, including the works of Platonists such as Plotinus.Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article Platonism He framed the concepts of original sin and just war as they are understood in the West. When Rome fell and the faith of many Christians was shaken, Augustine wrote The City of God, in which he defended Christianity from pagan critics and developed the concept of the Church as a spiritual City of God, distinct from the material City of Man. Augustine's work defined the start of the medieval worldview, an outlook that would later be firmly established by Pope Gregory the Great. Augustine was born in present-day Algeria to a Christian mother, Monica of Hippo. He was educated in North Africa and resisted his mother's pleas to become Christian. He took a concubine and became a Manichean. He later converted to Christianity, became a bishop, and opposed heresies, such as Pelagianism. His many works‚Äîincluding The Confessions, which is often called the first Western autobiography‚Äîhave been read continuously since his lifetime. The Roman Catholic religious order, the Order of Saint Augustine, adopted his name and way of life. Augustine is also the patron saint of many institutions and a number have been named after him. =Pope Gregory the Great= Gregory I the Great ( ‚Äì 604) was pope from 3 September 590 until his death. He is also known as Gregorius Dialogus (Gregory the Dialogist) in Eastern Orthodoxy because of the Dialogues he wrote. He was the first of the popes from a monastic background. Gregory is a Doctor of the Church and one of the four great Latin Fathers of the Church (the others being Ambrose, Augustine, and Jerome). Of all popes, Gregory I had the most influence on the early medieval church.Pope St. Gregory I at about.com =Isidore of Seville= Isidore of Seville ( ‚Äì 636) was Archbishop of Seville for more than three decades and is considered, as the historian Montalembert put it in an oft- quoted phrase, \\"le dernier savant du monde ancien\\" (\\"the last scholar of the ancient world\\"). Indeed, all the later medieval history-writing of Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula, comprising modern Spain and Portugal) was based on his histories. At a time of disintegration of classical culture and aristocratic violence and illiteracy, he was involved in the conversion of the royal Visigothic Arians to Catholicism, both assisting his brother Leander of Seville and continuing after his brother's death. He was influential in the inner circle of Sisebut, Visigothic king of Hispania. Like Leander, he played a prominent role in the Councils of Toledo and Seville. The Visigothic legislation which resulted from these councils is regarded by modern historians as exercising an important influence on the beginnings of representative government. Syriac Fathers A few Church Fathers wrote in Syriac; many of their works were also widely translated into Latin and Greek. =Aphrahat= Aphrahat (c. 270‚Äìc. 345) was a Syriac-Christian author of the 3rd century from the Adiabene region of Northern Mesopotamia, which was within the Persian Empire, who composed a series of twenty-three expositions or homilies on points of Christian doctrine and practice. He was born in Persia around 270, but all his known works, the Demonstrations, come from later on in his life. He was an ascetic and celibate, and was almost definitely a son of the covenant (an early Syriac form of communal monasticism). He may have been a bishop, and later Syriac tradition places him at the head of Mar Matti monastery near Mosul, in what is now northern Iraq. He was a near contemporary to the slightly younger Ephrem the Syrian, but the latter lived within the sphere of the Roman Empire. Called the Persian Sage (, ·∏•akk√Æm√¢ pÃÑƒÅrsƒÅyƒÅ), Aphrahat witnesses to the concerns of the early church beyond the eastern boundaries of the Roman Empire. =Ephrem the Syrian= Ephrem the Syrian (ca. 306 ‚Äì 373) was a Syriac deacon and a prolific Syriac-language hymnographer and theologian of the 4th century from the region of Syria. His works are hailed by Christians throughout the world, and many denominations venerate him as a saint. He has been declared a Doctor of the Church in Roman Catholicism. He is especially beloved in the Syriac Orthodox Church. Ephrem wrote a wide variety of hymns, poems, and sermons in verse, as well as prose biblical exegesis. These were works of practical theology for the edification of the church in troubled times. So popular were his works, that, for centuries after his death, Christian authors wrote hundreds of pseudepigraphal works in his name. He has been called the most significant of all of the fathers of the Syriac- speaking church tradition.Parry (1999), p. 180 =Isaac of Antioch= Isaac of Antioch (451‚Äì452), one of the stars of Syriac literature, is the reputed author of a large number of metrical homilies (The fullest list, by Gustav Bickell, contains 191 which are extant in MSS), many of which are distinguished by an originality and acumen rare among Syriac writers. =Isaac of Nineveh= Isaac of Nineveh was a 7th-century Syriac bishop and theologian best remembered for his written work. He is also regarded as a saint in the Church of the East, the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church and among the Oriental Orthodox Churches, making him the last saint chronologically to be recognised by every apostolic Church. His feast day falls on January 28 and in the Syriac Orthodox calendar on March 14. Isaac is remembered for his spiritual homilies on the inner life, which have a human breadth and theological depth that transcends the Nestorian Christianity of the Church to which he belonged. They survive in Syriac manuscripts and in Greek and Arabic translations. Desert Fathers The Desert Fathers were early monastics living in the Egyptian desert; although they did not write as much, their influence was also great. Among them are Paul of Thebes, Anthony the Great and Pachomius. Many of their, usually short, sayings are collected in the Apophthegmata Patrum (\\"Sayings of the Desert Fathers\\"). Modern positions In the Catholic Church, Bernard of Clairvaux is considered to be the last of the Fathers. The Eastern Orthodox Church does not consider the age of Church Fathers to be over and includes later influential writers up to the present day. The Orthodox view is that men do not have to agree on every detail, much less be infallible, to be considered Church Fathers. Rather, Orthodox doctrine is determined by the consensus of the Holy Fathers‚Äîthose points on which they do agree. This consensus guides the church in questions of dogma, the correct interpretation of scripture, and to distinguish the authentic sacred tradition of the Church from false teachings. The original Lutheran Augsburg Confession of 1530, for example, and the later Formula of Concord of 1576‚Äì1584, each begin with the mention of the doctrine professed by the Fathers of the First Council of Nicaea. Though much Protestant religious thought is based on sola scriptura (the principle that the Bible itself is the ultimate authority in doctrinal matters), the first Protestant reformers, like the Catholic and Orthodox churches, used the theological interpretations of scripture set forth by the early Church Fathers. John Calvin's French Confession of Faith of 1559 states, \\"And we confess that which has been established by the ancient councils, and we detest all sects and heresies which were rejected by the holy doctors, such as St. Hilary, St. Athanasius, St. Ambrose and St. Cyril.\\"Henry Beveridge, trans. Calvin's Tracts (Calvin Translation Socieity, Edinburgh. 1849) The Scots Confession of 1560 deals with general councils in its 20th chapter. The Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England, both the original of 1562-1571 and the American version of 1801, explicitly accept the Nicene Creed in Article VII. Even when a particular Protestant confessional formula does not mention the Nicene Council or its creed, its doctrine is nonetheless always asserted, as, for example, in the Presbyterian Westminster Confession of 1647. Many Protestant seminaries provide courses on patristics as part of their curriculum, and many historic Protestant churches emphasize the importance of tradition and of the fathers in scriptural interpretation. Such an emphasis is even more pronounced in certain streams of Protestant thought, such as Paleo-Orthodoxy. Patristics The study of the Church Fathers is known as patristics. Works of fathers in early Christianity, prior to Nicene Christianity, were translated into English in a 19th-century collection Ante- Nicene Fathers. Those of the First Council of Nicaea and continuing through the Second Council of Nicea (787) are collected in Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers.

The British victory helped to ensure their naval supremacy throughout the Napoleonic Wars. He was also a Freemason in the La Bonne Foi lodge at Montauban. Jean Marc Van Hille (ed.), Dictionnaire des marins francs-ma√ßons, Gens de mer et professions connexes, Le Phare de Misaine, Nantes 2008 Life =Pre-Revolution= Brueys was born to an aristocratic family in Rue Boucairie, Uz√®s, Gard, southern France in a house which now bears a plaque with his name. Joining the navy at 13, he was a volunteer on the ship-of-the-line Protecteur in 1766, he served in several campaigns in the Levant. Becoming a Garde de la marine in 1768, he fought in the Tunis expedition on the frigate Atalante and the Saint Domingue campaign on the ship-of-the-line Actionnaire, though he was forced to leave the latter due to sickness and return to France, where he served at shore establishments, mostly on France's Mediterranean coast. He rose to enseigne de vaisseau in 1777 and lieutenant de vaisseau in April 1780, before serving on the ship-of- the-line Terrible then the Z√©l√© in Guichen's squadron. He fought in three battles against Admiral Rodney in April and May 1780, then in the battle against Hood's fleet before Fort-de-France in April 1781. He was present at all the battles involving Grasse's squadron, including the Chesapeake (September 1781) and the capture of Saint Kitts in February 1782. He then moved to the frigate Vestale, by chance he was not present at the battle of Les Saintes. He was made a chevalier de Saint-Louis at the end of the war. On the peace he was put in command of the aviso Chien de Chasse, with which he spent four years in the Antilles and off the American coast. In 1787 he moved to command another aviso, the Coureur, which cruised along the coasts of Latin America. He then returned to France to command the fluyt Barbeau before taking one year's leave (1788‚Äì89). In 1790 he commanded the corvette Poulette. He sailed her from Toulon to Algiers with M. Valli√®re, France's consul general in Algeria. She also carried dispatches for the naval station and French consuls in the Levant. =1792‚Äì1798= He saw aristocratic family and friends killed during the Reign of Terror but managed to avoid such a fate himself. He did not emigrate and even found himself promoted to capitaine de vaisseau on 1 January 1792, before being put in command of the ship-of-the-line Le Lys at Toulon (renamed le Tricolore on the fall of the monarchy). He fought in the campaigns undertaken by Admiral Truguet's fleet - the bombardment of Oneglia, the Naples operation led by Latouche-Tr√©ville, and finally the attack on Cagliari on Sardinia. In the Toulon affair the town authorities arrested him. A decree of the National Convention in September 1793 stripped him of his rank as a noble. Truguet's ministry in 1795 restored his rank and he received promotion to contre-amiral the following year. He commanded French naval forces in the Adriatic from 1796 to 1798, flying his flag in the ship-of-the- line Guillaume Tell. He transported troops to the Ionian Islands and supported Bonaparte's campaign in Italy by blockading the coasts but keeping supply lines open to Bonaparte's troops. =Egypt= Bonaparte noted Brueys's conduct in Italy and made him commander-in-chief of the fleet that would transport his army for the Egyptian campaign, with the rank of vice-admiral and flying his flag on the Orient. The fleet set sail from Toulon on 19 May 1798. He succeeded in evading British attempts to prevent the French fleet reaching Egypt, reaching Malta and then (on 1 July 1798) Alexandria without incident. As soon as the land troops were disembarked, he was reputedly ordered by Bonaparte to either anchor in the port of Alexandria or return quickly to France, Malta or Corfu. Citing concern that the Alexandria harbor was too shallow and difficult to enter for his large warships, and unwilling to leave Egypt until the situation of the French army was secured, he instead opted to anchor in Aboukir Bay to await the British. Knowing the poor quality of his ships and crews, he preferred to guard a defensive position than take the offensive and refused to weigh anchor when Horatio Nelson attacked his fleet on the evening of 1 August 1798. In the ensuing Battle of the Nile, the Orient fought , causing her major damage but receiving little support, especially from the rearguard under Denis Decr√®s and Villeneuve. Already wounded twice during the day, and almost cut in half by a cannon shot, Brueys died at his command post around 9 PM. According to a British account, after a round shot had taken off both his legs, he had himself strapped to an armchair on deck so that he could continue to direct the fight. His ship exploded one hour later after a fire on board reached the gunpowder stores. The resulting blast was seen from miles away and may have killed as many as 800 of the ship's crew. Brueys was criticised in France for remaining at anchor right up until the moment of the attack, but Bonaparte replied to such criticism by saying \\"If, in this disastrous event, he made mistakes, he expiated them by his glorious end\\". His name appears on the southern pillar (23rd column) of the Arc de triomphe in Paris.

As an amateur geologist and mineralogist the mineral Fergusonite was named after him. Biography Robert Ferguson was the eldest son of Jane Crauford, daughter of Ronald Craufurd of Restalrig, (sister to Margaret, countess of Dumfries) and William Ferguson of Raith, Fife. General Sir Ronald Craufurd Ferguson was his brother. He was educated at the High School in Edinburgh, 1777‚Äì1780. He was also privately tutored by John Playfair. He then studied law at the University of Edinburgh. He qualified as an advocate in 1791. Robert Ferguson was elected to the Whig parliament of 1806 for Fifeshire, but was not afterwards elected until the time of the Reform Bill, upon which he represented the Kirkcaldy district of Burghs from 1831 to 1835, and in the latter year was returned for Haddingtonshire, defeating Mr Hope, the Tory candidate, by 268 to 231 votes. At the general election of 1837 he was in turn defeated by Lord Ramsay, who polled 299 votes to 205. He then returned to the representation of the Kirkcaldy division of Burghs. He was a cordial supporter of the measures of the Whig government, and opposed to the ballot. Due to his amateur interests in mineralogy, in 1805 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. In 1806 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was Lord Lieutenant of Fife from 1837. He died at a house in Portman Square in London on 3 December 1840. A memorial exists to him in Abbotshall Church in Fife. Family Ferguson infamously had an affair with Mary Nisbet, Countess of Elgin, only daughter of William Hamilton Nisbet, esq. of Dirleton, near Haddington. She was the wife of Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin, with whom she had one son, later Lord Bruce (1800‚Äì1840) and three daughters. The Earl sued Ferguson in both England and Scotland and won ¬£10,000 (the current, 2016, equivalent of around ¬£5 million). Following the Countess's inevitable divorce, Ferguson then married her on 20 April 1808. The couple had no children together. His nephew Robert Munro Ferguson (1802-1868) inherited his estates on his death.

This film marks the Kannada debut of Sameera Reddy, an established Bollywood, Tollywood and Kollywood actress. The film is directed by Ayyappa P. Sharma. Arjun Janya is the music director of the film. Shankare Gowda has produced the venture under Shankar Productions banner. It is also dubbed in Hindi as Ek Tha Nayak. The film is a remake of Telugu film Lakshyam which starred Gopichand, Jagapathi Babu and Anushka Shetty.Chiranjeevi Sarja-Sudeep's flick titled Varadhanayaka - Oneindia Entertainment Plot The film starts with a flashback in Bangalore. ACP Varadhanayaka (Sudeep) is a sincere police officer happily married and lives with his parents, wife (Sameera Reddy) and younger brother Hari (Chiranjeevi Sarja). Hari is a college student and he falls in love with his classmate Sirisha (Nikeesha Patel). Enter Section Shankar (P. Ravi Shankar) the villain who is notorious for settlements and land deals. Sirisha comes across ACP Varadhanayaka when she is on a field trip from her college with her friends. She gets friendly with his daughter Pinky who tells her that she would get her introduced to her uncle Hari and they would make a good pair. It turns out that Hari studies in Sirisha‚Äôs college and soon after they accidentally even come to know each other and get close. ACP Varadhanayaka investigates the case of a dreaded criminal Shankar whom no one has been able to touch. He is even involved with a land deal involving crores of money which is completely illegal and others including the D.I.G is involved. When the chairman of the bank who has lent money for the deal demand the money back as the deal hasn‚Äôt worked, Shankar eliminates him. The people who are customers of the bank take to the streets and try to damage the bank. ACP Varadhanayaka arrives there, arrests the manager and takes him away. Somehow Shankar comes to know where the manager has been taken. He arrives there with his men and the D.I.G nearly kill ACP Varadhanayaka. Shankar asks his men to dump the body. On the way, somehow Hari gets involved and ultimately rescues his brother from a burning bus and the elder brother dies in the younger brother‚Äôs arms. The entire media and the people think that ACP Varadhanayaka has swindled off all the money as they have been made to believe that by the D.I.G. Hari decides to take revenge on the people who killed his brother. Firstly he kills Siddharth(J.Karthik) (his friend and Shankar‚Äôs henchman). Then he kills the D.I.G (he had been taken to jail and he had escaped). Shankar also kidnaps the entire family of Hari. Hari goes to an old temple where he kills Shankar, he spills the beans that Varadhanayaka is dead and rescues his family under the supervision of the new D.I.G who supports him wholeheartedly.

O'Neill in his 1976 book The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space. O'Neill proposed the colonization of space for the 21st century, using materials extracted from the Moon and later from asteroids. An O'Neill cylinder would consist of two counter-rotating cylinders. The cylinders would rotate in opposite directions in order to cancel out any gyroscopic effects that would otherwise make it difficult to keep them aimed toward the Sun. Each would be in diameter and long, connected at each end by a rod via a bearing system. They would rotate so as to provide artificial gravity via centrifugal force on their inner surfaces. Interior view, showing alternating land and window stripes  Background  Artist's impression of the interior of an O'Neill cylinder, showing the curvature of the inner surface While teaching undergraduate physics at Princeton University, O'Neill set his students the task of designing large structures in outer space, with the intent of showing that living in space could be desirable. Several of the designs were able to provide volumes large enough to be suitable for human habitation. This cooperative result inspired the idea of the cylinder and was first published by O'Neill in a September 1974 article of Physics Today. O'Neill's project was not the first example of this concept. In 1954, the German scientist Hermann Oberth described the use of gigantic habitable cylinders for space travel in his book Menschen im Weltraum‚ÄîNeue Projekte f√ºr Raketen- und Raumfahrt (People in Space‚ÄîNew Projects for Rockets and Space Travel). In 1970, science-fiction author Larry Niven proposed a similar, but larger scale, concept in his novel Ringworld. Shortly before O'Neill proposed his cylinder, Arthur C. Clarke used such a cylinder (albeit of extraterrestrial construction) in his novel, Rendezvous with Rama.. = Islands= O'Neill created three reference designs, nicknamed \\"islands\\": Island One is a rotating sphere measuring in circumference ( in diameter), with people living on the equatorial region (see Bernal sphere). A later NASA/Ames study at Stanford University developed an alternative version of Island One: the Stanford torus, a toroidal shape in diameter. Island Two is spherical in design, in diameter. The Island Three design, better known as the O'Neill cylinder, consists of two counter-rotating cylinders. They are in diameter and are capable of being scaled up to long. Each cylinder has six equal-area stripes that run the length of the cylinder; three are transparent windows, three are habitable \\"land\\" surfaces. Furthermore, an outer agricultural ring, in diameter, rotates at a different speed to support farming. The habitat's industrial manufacturing block is located in the middle, to allow for minimized gravity for some manufacturing processes. To save the immense cost of rocketing the materials from Earth, these habitats would be built with materials launched into space from the Moon with a magnetic mass driver. Design =Artificial gravity= A NASA lunar base concept with a mass driver (the long structure that extends toward the horizon that is a part of the plan to build O'Neill Cylinders) The cylinders rotate to provide artificial gravity on their inner surface. At the radius described by O'Neill, the habitats would have to rotate about twenty-eight times an hour to simulate a standard Earth gravity; an angular velocity of 2.8 degrees per second. Research on human factors in rotating reference framesProceedings of the Symposium on the Role of the Vestibular Organs in Manned Spaceflight, NASA SP-77, 1965. See in particular: Thompson, Allen B.:Physiological Design Criteria for Artificial Gravity Environments in Manned Space SystemsProceedings of the Fifth Symposium on the Role of Vestibular Organs in Space Exploration, Pensacola, Florida, August 19‚Äì21, 1970, NASA SP-314, 1973 indicate that, at such low rotation speeds, few people would experience motion sickness due to coriolis forces acting on the inner ear. People would, however, be able to detect spinward and antispinward directions by turning their heads, and any dropped items would appear to be deflected by a few centimetres. The central axis of the habitat would be a zero-gravity region, and it was envisaged that recreational facilities could be located there. =Atmosphere and radiation= The habitat was planned to have oxygen at partial pressures roughly similar to terrestrial air, 20% of the Earth's sea-level air pressure. Nitrogen would also be included to add a further 30% of the Earth's pressure. This half-pressure atmosphere would save gas and reduce the needed strength and thickness of the habitat walls.Space Settlements: A Design Study (1977) . NASA SP-413. NSS.org. Retrieved September 12, 2012. Artist's depiction of the interior of an O'Neill cylinder, illuminated by reflected sunlight At this scale, the air within the cylinder and the shell of the cylinder provide adequate shielding against cosmic rays. The internal volume of an O'Neill cylinder is great enough to support its own small weather systems, which may be manipulated by altering the internal atmospheric composition or the amount of reflected sunlight. =Sunlight= Large mirrors are hinged at the back of each stripe of window. The unhinged edge of the windows points toward the Sun. The purpose of the mirrors is to reflect sunlight into the cylinders through the windows. Night is simulated by opening the mirrors, letting the window view empty space; this also permits heat to radiate to space. During the day, the reflected Sun appears to move as the mirrors move, creating a natural progression of Sun angles. Although not visible to the naked eye, the Sun's image might be observed to rotate due to the cylinder's rotation. Light reflected by mirrors is polarized, which might confuse pollinating bees. To permit light to enter the habitat, large windows run the length of the cylinder. These would not be single panes, but would be made up of many small sections, to prevent catastrophic damage, and so the aluminum or steel window frames can take most of the stresses of the air pressure of the habitat. Occasionally a meteorite might break one of these panes. This would cause some loss of the atmosphere, but calculations showed that this would not be an emergency, due to the very large volume of the habitat. =Attitude control= The habitat and its mirrors must be perpetually aimed at the Sun to collect solar energy and light the habitat's interior. O'Neill and his students carefully worked out a method of continuously turning the colony 360 degrees per orbit without using rockets (which would shed reaction mass). First, the pair of habitats can be rolled by operating the cylinders as momentum wheels. If one habitat's rotation is slightly off, the two cylinders will rotate about each other. Once the plane formed by the two axes of rotation is perpendicular in the roll axis to the orbit, then the pair of cylinders can be yawed to aim at the Sun by exerting a force between the two sunward bearings. Pushing the cylinders away from each other will cause both cylinders to gyroscopically precess, and the system will yaw in one direction, while pushing them towards each other will cause yaw in the other direction. The counter-rotating habitats have no net gyroscopic effect, and so this slight precession can continue throughout the habitat's orbit, keeping it aimed at the Sun. This is a novel application of control moment gyroscopes. Design update and derivatives  In 2014, a new construction method was suggested that involved inflating a bag and taping it with a spool (constructed from asteroidal materials) like the construction of a composite overwrapped pressure vessel. In 1990 and 2007, a smaller design derivative known as Kalpana One was presented, which addresses the wobbling effect of a rotating cylinder by increasing the diameter and shortening the length. The logistical challenges of radiation shielding are dealt with by constructing the station in low Earth orbit and removing the windows. Proposal At a Blue Origin event in Washington on May 9, 2019 Jeff Bezos proposed building O'Neill colonies rather than colonizing other planets.

He was an unaligned Member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for one term in 1858‚Äì1859 and a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly in 1861‚Äì1867 and again in 1870‚Äì1873. Early life Cribb was born in Poole, Dorset, England into a rigidly Nonconformist family. He was educated at his mother's Dame school. Cribb's father, John Galpin Cribb, was a mariner and ship owner, operating to Newfoundland and the Mediterranean; young Benjamin and his brother Robert sometimes accompanied their father. However, this ended when their father was killed in action during the Napoleonic Wars. Following his father's death, Cribb's mother Mary Cribb (n√©e Dirham) apprenticed Benjamin and his brother Robert to two merchants. By 1832 Benjamin and his brother Robert had established baking and retail businesses in London. Influenced by John Dunmore Lang's description of the opportunities available in Australia, they migrated to Moreton Bay on the Chaseley arriving in May 1849. Benjamin Cribb was married twice, in 1839 to Elizabeth Bridson (1810‚Äî1852) and in 1853 to Clarissa Kendal Foote (1825‚Äî1899). Two of his sons Thomas, and James, also served in the Queensland Parliament. His brother Robert Cribb also served in both the New South Wales and Queensland Parliaments. Business After arriving in the Moreton Bay colony, Benjamin Cribb established a retail business in Ipswich. In about 1852, he employed John Clarke Foote as a store manager. In 1853, Benjamin Cribb married Clarissa Foote, the sister of John Clarke Foote. In 1854, Benjamin Cribb and John Clarke Foote went into partnership as Cribb & Foote, creating the major department store that stood on the corner of Bell and Brisbane Streets. During the American Civil War he encouraged the growth and export of Australian cotton. Parliament On 1 February 1858, Cribb was elected to represent Stanley Boroughs in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly at the 1858 election. He was a strong supporter of the separation of the colony of Queensland and opposed the use of convicts, coolies or Kanaks as cheap labour. He was defeated at the 1859 election on 11 April 1859. After the separation of Queensland, he was elected to its Legislative Assembly. On 3 April 1861, George Thorn (senior), member for West Moreton, resigned. Benjamin Cribb won the resulting by-election on 26 April 1861. He held the seat until 2 July 1867. He was elected in the seat of Ipswich on 12 August 1870 and held it until 14 November 1873. He did not hold ministerial of parliamentary office. Later life Benjamin Cribb died on 11 March 1874 at his home Gooloowan in Denmark Hill, Ipswich. He was attending divine service at his local Congregational Church when he collapsed. Relatives and friends carried him home on a stretcher where he died a few moments later. His death was attributed to apoplexy of the brain. His funeral was held on 13 March 1874 where a funeral procession, one-and-a-half miles long, travelled from his home to the Ipswich General Cemetery. Present were relatives, employees, politicians and many others. Many businesses were closed for the day. Legacy His home Gooloowan is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.

Troy Caldwell 2016 White Wolf Mountain is a 460-acre private ski area located in the Lake Tahoe area, California. The ski area is discussed relating to the owner of Squaw Valley Ski Resort and Alpine Meadows (ski resort) interest in using White Wolf Mountain's interconnected property to create a mega resort.

Full mountain 2017 White Wolf Mountain is located between Squaw Valley, Placer County, California and Alpine Meadows, California.Troy Caldwell's dream of an Alpine-to-Squaw route lives on at his White Wolf Mountain, March 09, 2008, San Francisco Chronicle.\\"At Lake Tahoe's North Shore, Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows come together\\" September 28, 2011By Christopher Reynolds  Los Angeles Times staff writer The property runs from the parking lot at Alpine Meadows to Squaw Valley, and includes KT-22, which Squaw Valley leases from White Wolf Mountain.  Current Use  Currently the land is used as a private ski area with 1123 vertical feet, and ski areas are accessed via Snowcat. A chairlift is also currently being installed, and its installation is the subject of litigation with Squaw Valley Ski Resort.  History  In 1970 Troy Caldwell started working selling lift tickets at Alpine Meadows. He was an avid freestyle skier and later joined the US Freestyle team. He met his wife Susan who also worked at Alpine Meadows. Caldwell had studied architecture in college and also built houses in the summer months, building one to live in and another as a rental unit. Caldwell and his wife dreamed of opening a mounting ski lodge, and the land that he was interested in he found out was owned by Southern Pacific Railroad. Caldwell visited Brandon Mark of Southern Pacific in San Francisco who and Mark told him that SP was in the process of spinning of its land portfolio to Catellus Development Corporation, and was keen to sell the land for cash if possible. During the land negotiation SP called Squaw Valley to ask if they were still interested to buy the land, and the Squaw Valley employee said to S&P; (by mistake) that they were not interested in buying it (despite Alexander Cushing's many attempts to buy it over the years). He initially planned to ask Southern Pacific to sell him 5 acres, but the railroad refused and offered the entire 460 acre parcel. Troy Caldwell purchased the 460-acre section of property in 1989 from Southern Pacific Railroad for $450,000. According to Troy Caldwell: \\"The section of land that I own borders Alpine Meadows and butts right up to their parking lot...and rolls over onto KT-22. It is my mountain. I own about 70 acres of Squaw. I bought it from Southern Pacific Land Co. in 1989.\\" After buying the land the Caldwell's built a road in to the land and lived on it. Cushing of Squaw Valley was unhappy that Caldwell had bought the land and eventually sued Caldwell in 1996 for breach of contract (as Caldwell was now leaseholder of land leased to Squaw Valley). Caldwell and Cushing later agreed to trade 70 acres of land for ski lift equipment, and Caldwell later filed suit against Cushing for breach of contract, as Caldwell argued that Cushing had failed to delivery the ski lift towers as promised. Caldwell after beginning construction of his first chairlift was sued by the Bear Creek homeowners association. Caldwell eventually settled the suit and stopped construction of his ski lifts in 2007, and agreed that the land would only be utilized as a private ski area with up to 25 guests on the mountain at any given time. As of 2014 Andy Wirth of KSL Capital Partners and Troy Caldwell have been working on using the land to interconnect Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows.A WHITE WOLF‚ÄôS TALE Caldwell stated in 2019 he has spent $1.4 million dollars \\"on paperwork\\" and lives a modest life driving a 1987 Toyota pickup. In 2019 Caldwell received a response from Placer County regarding his plans to build 38 single- family homes, 14 guest units, housing for employees, a lodge, and only two ski lifts. Note that as of 2019 Alterra Mountain Company (the owner of Squaw and Alpine) still has plans to cross the property with a base to base gondola to connect Squaw and Alpine.  Early Development Plans  It is the stated goal of Troy Caldwell to use the land to interconnect Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows ski areas. There is also significant community interest in connecting the two resorts.Troy Caldwell Talks Squaw-Alpine Merger.Moonshine Ink, September 28, 2011Squaw Valley Purchases Alpine Meadows  Sierra Journal, Saturday, November 5th, 2011 In September 2011, Alpine Meadows and Squaw Valley Ski Resort merged ownership. The two resorts will retain their distinct identities but unite under common management dominated by Squaw‚Äôs Valley‚Äôs parent company, KSL Capital Partners. Alpine Meadow's parent, JMA Ventures, will own a smaller part. The new umbrella entity over both resorts will be known as Squaw Valley Ski Holdings LLC. It has been discussed in the media that the new company Squaw Valley Ski Holdings LLC, will seek to eventually combine the two resorts into one large resort through an agreement with a ski resort located on the mountain connecting Alpine Meadows and Squaw Valley, called White Wolf Mountain.\\"State of the Lake Tahoe ski industry: ‚ÄòThis is our time'\\", By Jason Shueh and Matthew Renda, North Lake Tahoe Bonanza, Thursday, Nov 03 This proposed combination is supported by White Wolf Mountain owner Troy Caldwell. If connected via White Wolf, the combined ski area would be the second largest resort in North America, only slightly smaller than Whistler Blackcomb. Caldwell's 2011 proposed vision\\"Squaw & Alpine WILL Connect  Exclusive Interview with White Wolf‚Äôs Troy Caldwell\\", By Miles Clark, UnofficialSquaw, December 13, 2011 for White Wolf Mountain includes: * A small high-end ski resort * Gondola & 3 ski lifts * Mid mountain hotel * Small village complete with ice skating rink In 2015 Squaw Valley Ski Holdings LLC announced a proposal to build a gondola through the property to connect the resorts. Litigation Troy Caldwell is currently in litigation with Squaw Valley over his installation of chairlift towers that would interconnect the two resorts. There have been many rounds of litigation, with the California Supreme Court ruling in 2000 that Caldwell was allowed to open his proposed chairlift, subject to limitations. There is some indication that Squaw Valley's new ownership, KSL Partners, are seeking to work with Caldwell, and put aside their differences. In December 2011 KSL paid for Caldwell to study ski resort development in the American West. He visited Jackson, Vail, Aspen, Snowmass, Buttermilk, Aspen Highlands, Beaver Creek, Steamboat, Grand Targhee, & Big Sky. KSL footed the bill for that on-site research and Caldwell said of the trip, ‚Äú(KSL) treated us like kings and queens.‚Äù White Wolf Subdivision In 2019 White Wolf Subdivision was proposed to Placer County planning department, and proposed 38 single family homes, 2 ski lifts and other amenities.
