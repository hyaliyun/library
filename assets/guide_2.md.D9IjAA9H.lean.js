The Galapagos archipelago lies in the southeast trade wind zone, so that climate and weather are dominated by the moisture-bearing trade winds and the topography of the islands. In general, the windward sides of the islands have a much higher precipitation than the leeward sides. \\"Phytogeography and Ecology of Scalesia (Compositae) Endemic to the Galapagos Islands\\" - Syuzo Itow Scalesia pedunculata is regarded as vulnerable because of human encroachment, invasive introduced plant species such as Cedrela odorata and Psidium guajava, and grazing by introduced goats. Fires and cutting for fuel are also contributory problems, though the tree's wood is soft, with a large, pithy centre. Charles Darwin first collected specimens of this species from Santiago Island ('James Island') in October 1835 on the voyage of the Beagle, and it was later named by his friend Joseph Dalton Hooker, who described it as 'frutescens' (becoming a shrub) as he thought that Darwin had made a mistake in calling it a tree, since members of the Daisy family rarely attain such a size.http://www.botanicus.org/page/1339257 The genus Scalesia comprises 9 species, with another 5 still unassessed and all endemic to the Galapagos Islands, three of which attain tree size viz. Scalesia pedunculata, S. cordata and S. microcephala, all three forming dense forests.\\"Rapid, recent and irreversible habitat loss: Scalesia forest on the Galapagos Islands\\" - Andre Mauchamp, Rachel Atkinson The name Scalesia resulted from a blunder by Arnott who named it in honour of \\"W. Scales Esq., Cawdor Castle, Elginshire\\" but discovered after publication in 1836 that the name should have read 'Stables', after Scottish botanist William Alexander Stables (1810-21 June 1890), who contributed to botanical literature and was the factor or property manager of John Campbell, 2nd Earl Cawdor. The biology of this species has not been well studied. Trees take some 15 years to mature, and stands of woodland usually show a dearth of younger trees growing under the canopy. Entire woodlands collapse when stressed by drought or excessive rain. Shortly after this collapse seedlings start germinating once more, suggesting that the species goes through a natural cycle of build-up and collapse.Daisy tree Retrieved 12 April 2017. The first documented collapse of Scalesia forest occurred between 1935 and 1940, with the cause still not being clear. Next was the collapse in 1982-83, coinciding with an El Ni√±o event, which brought heavy rain for many weeks, causing roots to rot and strong winds later flattened the entire forest. On Santa Cruz Scalesia pedunculata grows best at an altitude between 400 ‚Äì 700 m, a zone which is almost always shrouded in fog, with rain being uncommon. The perennial mists provide moisture to flourishing communities of epiphytes growing on the trunks and branches, with the drops eventually trickling down to ground level and the soil below.

The bill contains provisions promoting civil and political rights and Constitutional guarantees for Philippine internet users, such as freedom of expression, as well as provisions on information and communications technology (ICT) policy, ICT4D, internet governance, e-governance, cybersecurity, cyberwarfare, cyberterrorism, and cybercrime. The Magna Carta for Philippine Internet Freedom was proposed as an alternative to the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 whose enactment was met with mixed reactions.Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012#Reactions Proponents of the bill claim that the #MCPIF is the first crowdsourced bill in the Philippines.  Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012  = Definition, summary, and history = The Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (officially filed as Republic Act 10175) is an ICT law that provides legal definitions, provisions, and penalties for offenses ranging from confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems such as illegal interference, to content-related acts such as child pornography. President Benigno Aquino III signed the law and was enacted on September 12, 2012. Online debates and campaigns against the law influx, even making it to social media. The hashtag #NoToCyberCrimeLaw started to trend as common internet users became vocal of their opposition and apprehensions towards the law. Early in October 2012, several Philippine government websites such as the Official Gazette, the Senate, and even Senator Tito Sotto's website were targeted by members of the Anonymous hacktivist group from various regions of the world as the Cybercrime Prevention Act took effect. The group launched the operation #OpPhilippines where there was distributed denial of service (DDOS) on these sites, making them inaccessible. A YouTube clip was also released by Anonymous, airing its vocal statement of being against the anti-cybercrime law that ends the freedom of expression of Filipinos. A total of 15 petitions has been filed against the Cybercrime Law at the Supreme Court. On October 9, 2012, the high tribunal of the Supreme Court has issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) on the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012. The TRO initially suspended the entire law for a period of 120 days, but the Court later decided to extend the TRO indefinitely while the justices were working the case. On May 24, 2013, The Department of Justice announced that the contentious online libel provisions of the law were being pushed to be dropped alongside other pending revisions as it awaited the Supreme Court's ruling on its legality. = Precedents to the anti-cybercrime law =  Electronic Commerce Act of 2000  Prior to this law, the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000 (RA 8792) was enacted to acknowledge that aside from the Article II, Section 24 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution providing that, \\"The State recognizes the vital role of communication and information in nation-building,\\" information and communications technology was emphasized as an up-to-date addition in the Section 2 of the act which declares,\\"The State recognizes the vital role of information and communications technology (ICT) in nation-building; the need to create an information-friendly environment which supports and ensures the availability, diversity and affordability of ICT products and services...\\" There were 4 punishable acts in the law: hacking, introducing viruses to destroy data, pirating intellectual data, and violating The Consumer Act of the Philippines (RA 7394) through electronic messages.  Consumer Act of the Philippines  The law was designed to prevent businesses from engaging in fraudulent or specified 'unfair' practices where they gain unwarranted advantage over competitors through the means of deceptive advertising, selling counterfeit products, and the like. The Consumer Act also provided a set of regulated standards for production, distribution, trade, and promotion applicable to traditional media, which can be accessible online.  Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2000  The Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 (RA 9775) was also a relevant precedent to the law as it was integrated in it to provide a more outlined definition of actions that will be punishable by law. Section 52 of the MCPIF places limits on certain types of speech ‚Äúinimical to the public interest‚Äù where child pornography is filed under. RA 9775 contains provisions protecting the right to privacy of the child through non-disclosure of his/her identity as well as duties and responsibilities of individuals and groups. Those applicable under the MCPIF state that internet service providers (ISP) are responsible for notifying the Philippine National Police (PNP) or the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) of any form of activities related or containing child pornography, preserve the evidence for investigation and prosecution purposes, furnish particulars of users who have accesses or attempted to access the content, and ensure access of said content is blocked or filtered. Internet content hosts are also given similar duties. = Limitations, criticisms, and need for a magna carta = The Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 was condemned as a threat to freedom of expression on the internet, the media, and online privacy by common netizens and hacktivist groups such as Anonymous. It has also been compared to the Marcos Martial Law era by human rights groups, media freedom advocates, and internet users.. Kabataan Representative Raymond Palatino branded the legislation as ‚Äòe-Martial Law‚Äô as it can lead to censorship and harassment of the media. Prior to its enactment, 15 Supreme Court appeal petitions were lodged against the Law. Critics such as student protesters associated the law to the anti-piracy law of the United States that had recently failed the previous year. The failed laws includes the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP Act (PIPA) that aims to give the US government and copyright holders the access to ‚Äòrogue‚Äô websites. Similarly, many Filipino netizens from university students to journalists protested against the law on social media by changing their profile images into a black picture on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms. These critics do agree that the law would empower the government to suppress cybercrime offenders such as hackers, data thieves, and cybersex offenders. The law was also further criticized of imposing limitations on freedom of expression and freedom of the press, directly violating Article III, Section 4 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, through the inclusion of online libel as a crime in the passed law. This includes any person who criticizes other persons such as politicians, actors and actresses, and other people online in the forms of posting in social media site such as Facebook or blogs, and the like. The law also included a provision giving the act of online libel a punishment of one degree higher than libel in any other traditional media, making imprisonment for offenders to 12 years compared to the 6 years for libel in traditional media platforms. Online news organization are also susceptible.  Background  = Miriam Defensor-Santiago = Miriam Defensor-Santiago served as senator of the Philippines from 1995 to 2016. She was serving her third term when she filed a bill to repose the Cybercrime Prevention Act on November 12, 2012. It was dubbed as ‚ÄúAnti-Cybercrime Law version 2.0.‚Äù Santiago in 2012. Santiago argued that the Cybercrime Law was unconstitutional due to its vagueness that could be abused to harm netizens. She further claimed that the law violates the right to privacy and protection against illegal searches. To resolve this, Santiago envisioned a new bill, the Magna Carta for Philippine Internet Freedom, to define and penalize cybercrime through backing from crowdsourcing of netizens. She claims the MCPIF will protect the rights and freedom of expression of the netizens since the proposed bill does not give the government too much power unlike the Cybercrime Prevention Act. Furthermore, it ensures that the government maintains development accordingly to information technology's advancement. With the MCPIF, Santiago became the first senator who has passed a law that was ‚Äúcrowdsourced‚Äù through discussion in social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and e-mail. = Process = In response to the signing into law by President Benigno S. Aquino III of Republic Act No. 10175, a group of Filipino lawyers, bloggers, technology experts, and human rights advocates called Democracy.Net.PH spearheaded a crowdsourcing initiative towards the drafting of a law intended to replace it. The proposed Magna Carta for Philippine Internet Freedom was then filed as Senate Bill No. 3327 by Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago on November 12, 2012. The bill remained pending in committee until the 15th Congress adjourned on June 6, 2013. In the 16th Congress, Senator Santiago re-filed the Magna Carta for Philippine Internet Freedom in the Senate as Senate Bill No. 53 on July 1, 2013. On July 4, 2013, Representative Kimi Cojuangco of the 5th District of Pangasinan filed a counterpart bill in the House of Representatives as House Bill No. 1086. The bill has passed first reading in both chambers of the Philippine legislature. On July 24, 2013, Senator Paolo Benigno \\"Bam\\" Aquino IV filed a version of the #MCPIF, \\"enhanced with a 'Free WiFi' provision\\" as Senate Bill No. 1091. In the Philippine Congress, the crowdsourced bill the first reading in both chambers. MCPIF is based on 4 main points: rights, governance, development, and security. In March 2014, Pierre Tito Galla headed the Senate opening statement and supported its structure, which gave specific details on internet censorship, data discrimination, data privacy, data security, information security, net neutrality, and freedom of information, e-governance, and due process on punishments. The bill has a total of 10 parts and 85 sections, thereby emulating a bill of rights for the Filipino internet users. The MCPIF calls to repeal the Cybercrime Prevention Act and create an Office of Cybercrime within the Department of Justice to enforce this law. = Contentions and support from external parties = Journalists see the MCPIF as a mirror to the Magna Carta for Journalists Bill (HB 2550), which is condemned by media groups such as the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP). HB 2550 is unable to protect the lives, welfare, and safety of journalists due to the limitations in its provisions. It is also used as a tool to over-regulate the media. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) was also against the MCPIF, saying that it is far less useful than the pending Freedom of Information bill (FOI). According to the organization, \\"If politicians in the Philippines truly want to emulate the Magna Carta then they should focus more on the public‚Äôs right to know by passing the long-delayed Freedom of Information Bill and other measures that allow media keep their communities informed\\". Other online groups such as Democracy.Net.PH has actively voiced out the need for MCPIF's approval as it claims that it believes that MCDPIF is the cornerstone towards \\"progressive legislation on Philippine cyberspace and the information and communications technology (ICT) sector\\" as it urges more legislators to continue in pushing the bill. The ProPinoy Project also voices out that the MCPIF is an avenue to exercise democracy as it takes account for the people's rights and wants. There have also been notable individuals who have posted online and created a stir what netizens would think and feel on certain issues. For this M.R.J. Marisigan's blog, the author commends MCPIF but notes holes such as the covering of cyberbullying is not afforded to those beyond elementary as they do not fall under the Anti-Child Bullying Law, \\"Thus the MCPIF in decriminalizing libel would strip protection and deterrence against such kinds of occurrences.\\" = Gaps addressed by the MCPIF = The late Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago, the proposer of the MCPIF, pointed out the gaps the new bill addresses in juxtaposition with the Cybercime Prevention Act as it upholds the freedom of expression of Filipino netizens and protects them justly in a press release. Santiago further states the limitations of RA 10175 as it \\"violates the right to privacy and the Constitutional guarantee against illegal search and seizure through allowing the warrant-less real-time collection of traffic data. In contrast, the MCPIF ensures due process by providing strict guidelines for any collection of any data, including the securing of warrants, obligating notification, and limiting seizure to data and excluding physical property.\\" Santiago and other supporters claim that there is a dangerous 'takedown' clause of RA 10175 where the government has the authority to have a website or network blocked or restricted without due process of law which is absent in the MCPIF. \\"My bill specifically provides for court proceedings in cases where websites or networks are to be taken down, and prohibits censorship of content without a court order,\\" said Santiago. The MCPIF also prohibits double jeopardy where RA 10175 otherwise allows it through prosecution of offenses committed against its provisions and prosecution of offenses committed against the Revised Penal Code and special laws, even though the offenses are from a single act. The efforts of the government to decriminalize libel is aided with libel now considered as a civil liability rather than a criminal act bearing a penalty one degree higher than that of the Revised Penal Code. The MCPIF clarifies not just cybercrime law itself, but also its enforcement through the proposed Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT). The DICT is prepared alongside law enforcement agencies, and the military with provisions for handling cybercrimes such as amendments to the AFP Modernization Act that ensure ample weapons and defenses against cyberattacks by terrorists, violent non-state actors, and rogue or enemy nation-states and mandates on the Philippine National Police and the National Bureau of Investigation to combat cyberterrorism. Santiago also stated that the bill generally enables the Philippines to develop nationally alongside the realities and advances in ICT by harnessing its potential through ensuring government agencies and its laws move accordingly to the growth.  Provisions = Part 1 ‚ÄúGeneral Provisions‚Äù = Contains the policy framework of the Magna Carta for Philippine Internet Freedom Section 1 contains the formal name of the Magna Carta. Section 2 shows that the content of the Magna Carta still falls under the Philippine Constitution and briefly discusses the purposes that the state expects information and communications technology in the Philippines will serve. These include: government transparency and public participation in government activities; information propagation for the improvement of life; and the creation of art and development of culture. It also touches on the internet's capability to affect international relations and the State's recognition of its role to make sure internet use still complies with these relations. = Part 2 ‚ÄúDefinition of Terms‚Äù = Contains one section stating that, when possible, definitions of terms used in the bill shall be adopted from those established by the International Telecommunications Union, the Internet Engineering Task Force, the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, and other relevant worldwide organizations. It then goes on to list more than 63 terms relevant to the Magna Carta. = Part 3 ‚ÄúInternet Rights and Freedoms‚Äù = Codifies a Bill of Rights for Filipino internet users. This also discusses the securities afforded to them under State jurisdiction. Sections 4 to 7 talk about individual rights regarding the internet and electronic devices. Sections 4 and 5 discuss the rights to freedom of speech and usage, and universal access to the internet. They also discuss bans on internet censorship and data discrimination. Section 6 talks about the right to control access to devices under one's ownership, while Section 7 looks into freedom of creativity on the Internet. Sections 8 to 13 discuss security. Sections 8 and 9 promote data privacy, data security, and information security mostly for individual use, while 10 to 12 discuss security in terms of a more public realm, touching on intellectual property and net neutrality. Section 13 highlights the use of the Internet in government transparency and freedom of information. Due process clauses are included in these provisions. = Part 4 ‚ÄúThe Department of Information and Communications Technology‚Äù = Establishes an executive department for purposes of Philippine information and communications technology policy, ICT4D, internet governance, and e-governance. This part also discusses other offices that assist this department with its responsibilities. Sections 14 to 19 focus on the department itself, discussing its objectives, powers, composition, the responsibility of its head and the department's capability of putting up regional offices. Section 20 seeks to ensure that the department keeps its performance in check by submitting a periodic performance review. Sections 21 to 27 introduce other organizations that aid the department in carrying out its duty which include: the Council of Chief Information Officers; the National Telecommunication Commission; the National Data Privacy Commission; the ICT Legal Affairs Office; the Telecommunications Office; the National Information and Communications Technology Institute; and the Official Gazette. Section 28 seeks to assure that the reorganization of the government to accommodate these groups is under Constitution. Sections 29 to 32 detail the manner of organization of the personnel under the department. = Part 5 ‚ÄúRegulations for the Promotion of Internet Rights and Freedoms‚Äù = Reiterates the compliance of the Philippines to treaties and international conventions to which it is a signatory, defines duties of state agencies and instrumentalities, provides amendments of existing telecommunications, intellectual property, data privacy, and e-commerce laws, and provides explicitly for the repeal of the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012. Section 33 declares the Magna Carta's compliance with international treaties and conventions. Section 34 declares the state as the primary duty-bearer with regard to Philippine Internet regulation, and lists the duties regarding this in Section 35. These duties include: cybercrime law enforcement; cyberdefense and national cybersecurity; the development of skills, resources and technology for ICT technology; education related to ICT; and intellectual property rights in cyberspace. Sections Section 36 to 42 discuss the changes made to the Constitution to accommodate the Magna Carta. These include amendments to: the Public Telecommunications Policy Act of the Philippines; the Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines; the E-Commerce Act; and the Data Privacy Act Section: The final section calls for the repeal of the Cybercrime Prevention Act. = Part 6 ‚ÄúCybercrimes and Other Prohibited Acts‚Äù = = Part 7 ‚ÄúNational Cybersecurity, Cyberdefense, Counter-Cyberterrorism, and Counter-Cyberespionage‚Äù = = Part 8 ‚ÄúPenalties‚Äù = Parts 6, 7, and 8 define Philippine cybercrimes and penalties, competent law enforcement agencies, special cybercrime courts and their jurisdictions, and cybersecurity and counter-cyberterrorism policy. Child pornography, child abuse, hate speech, cyberespionage, cyberterrorism, terrorism financing, trafficking in persons, child prostitution, phishing, cybersquatting, and intellectual property infringement are among the crimes defined. Crimes committed against critical infrastructure are provided a higher class of penalties. Double jeopardy is forbidden explicitly in Section 64 of the Magna Carta for Philippine Internet Freedom. = Part 9 ‚ÄúImplementing Rules and Regulations‚Äù = = Part 10 ‚ÄúFinal Provisions‚Äù = Detail the implementation of the Magna Carta for Philippine Internet Freedom and provide the final provisions for putting it into effect. Part 9 itself focuses on the implementation. This covers implementation of the Magna Carta for cybercrime law enforcement, ICT education, ICT research and development, and rules and regulations for periodically reviewing the implementation. Part 10 details the concrete instructions to the government for starting the implementation of the Magna Carta, such as appointing a head and preparing initial funding. This part also includes clauses for the Magna Carta's separability from the rest of the Constitution, the repealing of unmentioned laws inconsistent to it and the start of its effectivity.  Implications and application  = On crowdsourcing = As one of the first crowdsourced bills in the country following the Crowdsourcing Act of 2012, the Magna Carta for Philippine Internet Freedom has been perceived as a success by various civil states in terms of participative democracy, as mentioned in the 2013 Internet Governance Forum in Bali, an annual forum dedicated to delegates from participating United Nations countries that serves as an avenue to discuss the current state, effects, and legal practices of new media. In addition, the European Citizen Action Service (ECAS)‚Äôs 2016 report mentions the MCPIF as one of its models towards the creation of a crowdsourcing policy framework in the EU, along with other crowdsourcing initiatives of other countries. In one of the case studies performed by the organization, it listed down some of the implications that the crafting of the MCPIF has cultivated. According to the organization‚Äôs report, it has ‚Äúenhanced the citizens‚Äô participation in policy- making, engaged youth, ensured a learning process, ensured innovative ideas for policy-making based on the wisdom of the crowd. increased political trust, and kept the citizens‚Äô faith in the crowdsourcing method to enhance democracy\\". However, no concrete statistical evidence supports that the bill increased representativeness in the national level. = On libel = With its implementation, Miriam Defensor-Santiago considers RA 3327 as an initial step to decriminalize certain forms of libel. As a response to a number of suggested amendments to the former Cybercrime Prevention Act which seeks to pin down criminal activities on the internet, the bill was crafted to protect online users' freedom of expression contrary to RA 10175 which, according to legislators and non-government organizations, restraints online rights and sends a \\"chilling effect\\" to consumers of new media. While the bill does not exempt libelous statements made online from criminal liabilities, it exempts public airing of grievances from being held liable. Statements of dissatisfaction directed to public officials, consumer products, and online remarks meant for private and peer reviews are not subject to criminal liabilities, as well as statements of protests that concern public interest. Under the proposed bill, satire will be protected, and truth will be considered as a defense against libel. = A better future for internet in the Philippines = Given its wide acknowledgment from various organizations, legislators, and states, the hopes and expectations for the MCPIF are high. As of 2013, 37% of the population gains daily online access. As this number continues to grow, repercussions resulting from various online behaviors will continue to increase as well, and Philippine legislators will have to boost policies and laws to address the effects of the internet to the population. With the MCPIF and its four pillars namely rights, governance, development, and security at hand, the Philippines can expect a more stable future in terms of the consumption of new media. With its implementation, online consumers can expect a guarantee in both their online and offline rights. The MCPIF also promises a more open governance especially in ICT-related policies, a more sustained development towards ICT as a vessel towards a more progressive economy, and lastly, a more solidified security system that protects its citizens from outside threats on the internet.

The islands are not to be confused with Hyskeir in the Inner Hebrides, or Haskeir which is also off North Uist and visible from the group. Geology and geography Shivinish, the middle of the three main Monach Islands The main islands of (once home to a nunnery), and Shivinish () are all linked at low tide. It has been claimed that it was at one time possible to walk all the way to Baleshare, and on to North Uist, five miles away at low tide. In the 17th century, a large tidal wave is said to have washed this route away. The islands of the group tend to be low-lying and sandy, subject to intense coastal erosion. Not unlike the Isles of Scilly it is possible that , Shivinish and formed a single body of land within historic times, and that their land area has greatly decreased due to overgrazing, sea inundation, and wind erosion. Smaller islands in the group include Deasker (), Shillay () and (or Stockay). History The two lighthouses on Shillay. The old lighthouse was closed in 1942; the newer light was installed in 1997. The new light was deactivated in 2008, and the old lighthouse re-activated. , the most easterly of the three main Monach Islands including and the ruined village The islands have been uninhabited since 1942, but were populated by up to 100 people for centuries (possibly for a millennium or more) prior to 1810. They were originally abandoned due to overgrazing, but were resettled by 1841 in the wake of the Highland Clearances. The 19th century census records for the islands show a fluctuating population, from 39 people in 1841 up to 140 people at their peak population in 1891. Shillay is the location of Monach Lighthouse, built by David and Thomas Stevenson in 1864. The lighthouse was closed in 1942 but, following the sinking of the oil tanker MV Braer in 1993, a new and much smaller lighthouse was built in 1997. This had a range of ; when a range of was deemed necessary, the new lighthouse was shut down in 2008 and the old lighthouse recommissioned with a new optic. Like all British lighthouses it is now unmanned and fully automated. In 2007 renovations of the old schoolhouse were completed, enabling visitors to stay on the island, and learn about its history and wildlife. The old Heisgeir mailboat has also been restored at the Grimsay boatshed. The 28-foot motorised open wooden boat was built circa 1932 for the last family to leave the Monach Islands, and had lain unused at Lochmaddy before being rescued by the local history society. =Lady Grange= Jacobite sympathiser James Erskine, Lord Grange (1679‚Äì1784), had his wife Rachel kidnapped and abandoned on the Monach Isles between 1732 and 1734. At the time the islands were owned by Sir Alexander MacDonald of Sleat and she was housed with his tacksman (leaseholder), another Alexander MacDonald and his wife. When Lady Grange complained about her condition, she was told by her host that he had no orders to provide her either with clothes, or food other than the normal fare he and his wife were used to. She lived in isolation, not even being told the name of the island where she was living, and it took her some time to find out who her landlord was. She was there until June 1734 when John and Norman MacLeod from North Uist arrived to move her on. They told her they were taking her to Orkney,Macauley (2009) pp. 84‚Äì86Haswell-Smith (2004) pp. 254‚Äì56 but she was taken to Hirta where she lived from 1734-42 before being taken to Skye where she died after a failed rescue attempt. Wildlife and conservation A deserted cottage on the Monach Isles The islands are of special interest for undisturbed machair and their grey seal population. About 10,000 seals come ashore each autumn to have their pups and mate, making it one of the largest such colonies in the world. There are also a large number of nesting seabirds and a rich flora. Grey herons nest in some of the abandoned buildings.Murray, W.H. (1966) The Hebrides. London. Heinemann. Page 205. There are no trees on the islands. The islands are designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA), a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies as the islands (via the SSSI designation) as meeting the criteria for a Category IV protected area. The SAC designation extends to cover the seas surrounding the group, and in 2014 a larger area of the sea surrounding the islands (in total ) was declared a Nature Conservation Marine Protected Area (NCMPA). The designation is in place to protect the feeding grounds of the islands' seabirds, as well as the marine geomorphology of the seabed. The Monach Islands were also formerly designated as a national nature reserve, however this designation was withdrawn in May 2018.

Mansfield gained the Royal Charter of a market town in 1227. The town lies in the Maun Valley, north of Nottingham, and is near Sutton-in-Ashfield. Most of the 106,556 population live within the town proper (including Mansfield Woodhouse), with Market Warsop as a secondary centre. It is the only local authority in Nottinghamshire directly to elect its mayor. History Settlement dates to the Roman period. Major Hayman Rooke in 1787 discovered a villa between Mansfield Woodhouse and Pleasley; a cache of denarii was found near King's Mill in 1849. Early English royalty stayed there; Mercian Kings used it as a base to hunt in Sherwood Forest. The Domesday Book (1086) recorded the settlement as Mammesfeld and market-petition documents of 1227 spelt it Maunnesfeld. King Richard II signed a warrant in November 1377 to grant tenants the right to hold a four-day fair each year; the spelling had changed to Mannesfeld. There are remains of the 12th-Century King John's Palace in Clipstone, between Mansfield and Edwinstowe, and it was an area of retreat for royal families and dignitaries through to the 15th Century. Access to the town was by road from the city of Nottingham, on the way to Sheffield. In the town centre, a commemorative plaque marks the point thought once to be the centre of Sherwood Forest. A tree was planted nearby but has since been felled and replaced by a sculpture. Travellers in the 16th and 17th centuries had several inns and stable yards dating from the medieval period to stop at: the Harte; the Swan, with 1490 dating stone; the Talbot; the White Bear; the Ram, with timber from before 1500; and the White Lion.. Several timber-framed cruck buildings were demolished in 1929; and in 1973 a local historical society documented another during demolition dated to 1400 or earlier. Other Tudor houses in Stockwell Gate, Bridge St, and Lime Tree Place were also demolished to make way for development before they could be viewed for listing. Most remaining buildings are from the 17th century. =Markets= Mansfield's Buttercross Market Monument on West Gate Mansfield is a market town with a 700-year-old market tradition; a Royal Charter was issued in 1227. The present market square was created after demolition under the Improvement Act of 1823. In the centre is the Bentinck Memorial, built in 1849, which commemorates Lord George Bentinck (1802‚Äì1848), son of the William Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland, a local landowner. A nearby area called Buttercross Market in West Gate, the site of an old cattle market, has a centrepiece of local stone dating from the 16th century. Mansfield District Council closed this section in 2015. Adjacent is Mansfield Library, officially opened by the Queen in 1977 and refurbished in 2012. The old Carnegie Library, founded in 1905 in Leeming Street, was used from 1976 as an arts and performance centre. Geography and climate Mansfield has a temperate oceanic climate (K√∂ppen: Cfb), with a narrow temperature range, an even spread of rainfall, low levels of sunshine and often breezy conditions throughout the year. The closest weather-station records for Mansfield come from Warsop in Meden Vale, seven miles to the north. The absolute maximum temperature record for the area stands at , recorded in August 1990. In a typical year the warmest day should reach and 12.72 days should reach or higher. The absolute minimum temperature record for the area is , recorded in January 1987. There is air frost on an average of 59 nights a year. Rainfall averages 634 mm a year, with 113 days reporting in excess of 1 mm of rain (observation period 1971‚Äì2000). Economy =Town centre= Old Town Hall and Old Court building at the head of the Market Place built from local stone Mansfield has a market square surrounded by commercial premises. It also has a museum; the Palace Theatre; and many restaurants, fast-food outlets, pubs, bars, and night clubs. In 2012‚Äì2013 , the district council installed a crowd-funded, town-centre Wi-Fi installation, completed June 2013. It has a network of AP nodes, requires registration for free use, and dedicated optional BID local information Apps for Android and iOS are available. The intention was to encourage shoppers and visitors to stay longer, offer internet access for small businesses, and help traders take cashless payments. =Retail= Among Mansfield's retail outlets is an indoor shopping centre, called the Four Seasons, with over 50 units occupied by national chains and phone shops, and two department stores. Other stores and a coffee chain have been in West Gate since 2011, along with existing similar caf√©s. Rosemary Centre is a pedestrianised area off the town centre with a covered parade. There are also three outdoor retail parks, two with adjacent branded fast-food outlets.underpasses connecting to the pedestrianised town centre =Civic Centre= The headquarters of Mansfield District Council occupied part of a former recreation ground at Chesterfield Road South from late 1986; it was opened in 1987 by Princess Anne. Catering facilities are run by outside contractors. From 2012, surplus office space was rented to outside concerns. Working with Ashfield District Council to cut costs, the legal services of both authorities were combined in existing ADC offices at Kirkby in Ashfield. Their joint regeneration service began earlier. The council decided in 2014 to close the Civic Centre counter-payments facility. Job Centre Plus, an agency within the Department for Work and Pensions, moved in 2018 from two town-centre venues to the re-modelled Civic Centre interior ground floor. The vacated offices were intended for redevelopment as housing and retail. Mansfield Community Partnership, also at the Civic Centre, is a centralised hub for council, police, and other bodies, in a dedicated town- centre unit. =Former Employment and industry= Wolverhampton & Dudley Breweries in October 1999 aquired Mansfield Brewery, once the United Kingdom's largest independent brewery, for ¬£253 million. Production of the Mansfield range of ales moved out and the site was later sold to Pubmaster Ltd; the site is yet to be redeveloped. In the 1980s, Mansfield Bitter was advertised with a photograph of then US President Ronald Reagan and the tagline: \\"He might be president of the most powerful nation on earth... but he's never had a pint of Mansfield.\\" \\"Not much matches Mansfield\\" was also used and became the title for a play set in the town written for the Mansfield Arts Festival. The remaining part of the old Brewery offices, now housing a learning centre 155px 155px Mansfield's old-established soft drink manufacturer, R. L. Jones, with brand names Sunecta and Mandora, was bought by Mansfield Brewery in 1977. A move to a modern factory in Bellamy Road in 1975 released land projected for a high-density housing development known as Layton Burroughs. Mansfield Brewery sold the business in 1988 for ¬£21.5 million to the Scottish drinks company A. G. Barr plc, producer of Irn-Bru, Tizer, and Mandora. At the time the firm employed 400 people. Production ceased there in January 2011 when A. G. Barr closed the factory and production to other sites. Despite demolition of the brewery production buildings in 2008, five years later, the site remained unsold. The older ornate offices now house a learning centre. headstocks stated to be the highest in Europe and surrounding cleared pit-head site Many areas near the town and in surrounding countryside still show signs of coal mining, the main industry for most of the 20th century. A violent episode in the UK miners' strike (1984‚Äì1985) occurred in Mansfield on May Day 1984. Most the area's miners had voted against a strike, but the local union initially maintained that the strike was official to show solidarity with strikers in other areas. When the coal board granted an extra day of leave after the bank holiday, a group of working miners confronted union officials and violence broke out with striking miners. Mansfield later hosted a breakaway union, the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, which recruited many who had opposed the 1984‚Äì1985 strike. The head stocks close to the village of Clipstone are an important local landmark and community groups are trying to preserve them as a reminder of the area's mining history. As demand for coal fell, Mansfield's pits wound down and miners had to find other work. Mining subsidence causes problems for properties around Mansfield. A few streets in and around the town form long rows of terraced houses reminiscent of the affordable housing provided for mine workers in the prime of the industry. Many were demolished in 2012 in Pleasley Hill, Market Warsop and elsewhere. The Coal Authority is based in the town. =Regeneration= In 2019 the UK government set up the Towns Fund, which aimed to regenerate areas in need of regeneration. Mansfield was one of these places with the aim of receiving 25 million for its regeneration and development. This is to part with The Mansfield Townscape Heritage Project, which provided grants by the National Lottery to renovate parts of the town centre.{{Cite Web Regeneration money is a further boost for Mansfield https://www.mansfield.gov.uk/news/article/57/regeneration-money-is-a-further- boost-for-mansfield created 6th September 2019 and retrieved on 01/09/2020 MARR road known as Sherwood Way looking east towards Derby Road and Rainworth beyond, with Cauldwell Dam and Woods to the left Several urban regeneration projects planned for Mansfield involved large-scale demolition, but the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 and subsequent central-government funding cuts and escalating austerity measures deferred them. Mansfield District Council promoted two new developments: Arrival Square, opened 2008, an office block occupied by the Probation Service by the rail station; and Queen's Place‚Äîcompleted and opened by the mayor, Tony Egginton, in late 2013‚Äîwhich cost the council ¬£2.4 million. It offered two new ground-floor retail units and six offices in Queen Street between the new transport interchange and the market square. Reconstruction of nearby King's Mill Hospital in Sutton in Ashfield was completed in 2009. It is near the Mansfield and Ashfield Regeneration Route, which opened in 2004 as a bypass designed to reduce through traffic and improve access by connecting the A617 at Pleasley to the A617 at Rainworth. In 2009 Mansfield made a bid for city status, appending redevelopment plans for retail, residential and leisure facilities with road improvements gradually being made; still pending as of August 2020. King's Mill Hospital in 2013, showing the main entrance beyond the paving, outpatient clinics to the left, the women and children's centre to the right, and wards in the towers behind Transport =Railway history= Mansfield railway station is on the Robin Hood Line, a link connecting with Nottingham and Worksop. From 1964 until the line reopened in 1995, Mansfield was by some definitions the largest town in Britain without a railway station, remarkable after the town had pioneered the railway in the East Midlands. From 1973 to 1995 the nearby station at Alfreton was named \\"Alfreton and Mansfield Parkway\\" to encourage use as a railhead for Mansfield. A Sunday rail service was restored to Mansfield in December 2008. The town was originally the terminus of the Mansfield and Pinxton Railway, a horse-drawn plateway built in 1819 and one of the first acquisitions of the newly formed Midland Railway. The Midland used the final section to extend its new Leen Valley line to the present station in 1849. The Midland Railway extended its Rolleston Junction‚ÄìSouthwell branch to Mansfield in 1871; continued the line north to Worksop in 1875; opened a link from Mansfield Woodhouse to Westhouses and Blackwell in 1886; and completed another link from Pleasley through Bolsover to Barrow Hill in 1890. The locally promoted Mansfield Railway between Kirkby South Junction and Clipstone Junctions‚Äîopened in stages between 1913 and 1916 for goods trains and in 1917 for Nottingham‚ÄìOllerton passenger trains, calling at a second Mansfield passenger station‚Äîbroke the Midland Railway monopoly. Though nominally independent, the Mansfield Railway connected at both ends with the Great Central Railway, which worked the trains. Mansfield had two railway stations: Mansfield Town,the former Midland station on Station Road; and Mansfield Central, the former Mansfield Railway station in Great Central Road, near Ratcliffe Gate. Central station lost its scheduled passenger services at the beginning of 1956 and Town station closed to passengers in 1964, leaving Mansfield without passenger trains until the Robin Hood line restored them in 1995. Mansfield & District Light Railways ran a tram service between 1905 and 1932. =Today= Buses Buses in Mansfield are mainly operated by Stagecoach, with Trent Barton and National Express also working the area. The council granted planning permission for a new bus station on the former Station Road car park, expected to cost ¬£7 million, in 2006. The old bus station, built in 1977, handled around 1,500 buses and 16,000 passenger arrivals a day; but had an outdated design and appearance, and poor outdoor waiting facilities. There were good pedestrian links to the pedestrianised town-centre shopping streets; however, the railway station was several hundred yards away. The new bus station addressed the problem but proved unpopular with shopkeepers near the old facility, with several claiming marked reductions in trade. The new bus station and transport interchange opened on 31 March 2013 in a location on a former car park close to the railway station. It is part of a regeneration scheme known as \\"Gateway To Mansfield\\", which aims to give visitors a clean and tidy first impression, including buildings with a themed use of local sandstone. The scheme also aims to improve facilities for locals, boost visitors to the town and help step up the local economy. The new bus station increased passenger safety and provides a more welcoming scene for arriving visitors. Improvements have included an enclosed waiting area, automatic doors for fume reduction and safety, a tourist information centre, electronic bus and rail departure information, toilets, and baby-changing facilities. A tower with lift and stairs to an elevated walkway connects it to the railway station.

Relegated to the Conference National after 77 years in the Football League at the end of the 2007‚Äì2008 season, Mansfield Town returned to the Football League after winning the 2012‚Äì2013 Conference National title. Non-League club AFC Mansfield plays in the Forest Town area of Mansfield. Mansfield Rugby Club is a rugby union club based at Eakring Road and currently plays in Midlands 1 East, a sixth-tier league in the English rugby union system. It won the Notts Cup for five years in succession and for a record 18 times. Mansfield Giants is Mansfield's Premier Basketball Club, and has a three-star Accreditation and Club Mark from the English Sports Council. The team plays in the England Basketball (EB2). The annual half marathon held for more than 30 years was cancelled after 2011 due to escalating costs, after changes to Health and Safety legislation meant professional services were needed to address road- closure measures, instead of volunteers. Mansfield local business networking group 2020 had hoped to restore a race by September 2014, but this event, reduced in length to 10 kilometres, was postponed, initially until spring 2015, and took place in August. Angling is well supported in the Mansfield district, where ponds remain from the former textile milling industry. Tennis is catered for by Mansfield Lawn Tennis Club located at the same site since 1883, with two grass courts and four asphalt courts, three of them floodlit. Further hard-surface courts are found in the district at six Mansfield District Council park locations. Mansfield is home to Mansfield Roller Derby, Mansfield's premier Flat Track Roller Derby league. One issue for local residents is Mansfield's lack of a central Leisure Centre. Mansfield District Council decided it would rubber stamp the sale of the existing Leisure Centre and extensive public car park to Tesco, which opened a large Tesco Extra store in 2007. The Council asserted that this would be replaced by a brand new Leisure Centre, but nothing has been built or is planned. It received over ¬£5m from Tesco for the Leisure Centre site, but decided to spend this on refurbishing Sherwood Baths instead. Mansfield has two indoor swimming centres and a third, smaller pool attached to a school, which has been under threat of closure since 2011. These facilities give Mansfield the largest square meterage of indoor water-sports facilities per capita of any town in the United Kingdom with less than 100,000 inhabitants. Mansfield is one of three outlets for the Nottinghamshire County Council Swim Squad, which competes as Nova Centurion. The Sherwood Swimming Baths adjacent to the former Sherwood Colliery was refurbished and opened in January 2010 as the Rebecca Adlington Swimming Centre. The 25-metre pool was widened at the expense of losing tiered public seating and has a new, small, endless stroke-improvement training pool with variable-resistance water flow. The complex reduces its carbon footprint by using a ground-source heat pump backed by a biomass boiler burning wood pellets prepared from waste by a local wood yard. At the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, a Mansfield contestant, Rebecca Adlington, won two gold medals, for 400 and 800-metre freestyle swimming. After her record-breaking success, Adlington was welcomed home to Mansfield by thousands lining the streets to applaud as she passed in an open top bus. This culminated in an appearance at the old Town Hall in the Market Square. Her success boosted swimming interest in the area, leading to expansion of swimming classes to encourage young people to begin swimming. At the 2012 Olympic Games in and around London, Adlington won two Bronze medals again for 400 and 800 metres, the best performance of a generally disappointing Team GB swimming squad. She retired from competitive swimming in February 2012. Water Meadows swimming complex opened during the Christmas holidays of 1990 in Bath Street, on the site of the former Mansfield Baths and defunct cattle market. It has a gym and a soft-play area for children with an adjoining caf√©, as well as one 25-metre competition pool, two other pools, and a small teaching pool. The leisure lagoon pool has an artificial wave machine operating periodically, and also a slide and a shallow area like a beach. The complex is popular with family groups, and many surrounding schools make use of its facilities. Parks Titchfield Park and River Maun looking towards Nottingham Road with Water Meadows pool to rear of camera position Titchfield Park On the same site as the Water Meadows swimming complex, offers large grassy areas on both sides of the river Maun, crossed by two footbridges. It has a bowls green, hard tennis courts, a basketball court, a children's play area, and many flowerbeds. Fisher Lane Park Nearby stretches from the top of Littleworth through to Rock Hill. It is popular with dog walkers, kite flyers and skaters, as Mansfield District Council installed a concrete skate plaza, causing some local controversy.Carr Bank Park with Mansfield Manor Hotel, originally an industrialist's residence However, the skate plaza has proved popular with local young people. Some rides and stalls for local children are set up in the park in the summer. Carr Bank Park Also close to the town, has a rocky grotto, a bandstand and summer flower beds. It has a war memorial built of local sandstone, dedicated to soldiers killed in action since the end of the Second World War, to complement the original setting unveiled after the First War in 1921. Cemeteries and crematorium The main cemetery and crematorium occupy a 10-acre site accessed from Derby Road, on the southern edge of town near to the boundary with Ashfield. They share a car park. In late 2015, Mansfield District Council recognised the need for additional spaces and planning consent was obtained. The older part of the cemetery, fronting Nottingham Road and Forest Hill (the old Derby Road) has on-street parking. Site access on foot can be hard due to the steep slope. The cemetery was opened in 1857 due to insufficient church graveyard space, the mid-to-late Victorian population growth and several then-new churches built with little or no dedicated graveyard areas. A 10-acre extension was made in 1898. The adjacent Mansfield and District Crematorium, with two chapels seating 35 and up to 80, was set up in 1960. and is a responsibility shared between Mansfield District Council, Ashfield District Council and Newark and Sherwood District Council. There are other cemeteries on the A60 at Mansfield Woodhouse and at Warsop, and off the A617 at Pleasley Hill. Entertainment The Palace Theatre in Leeming St is the town's prime entertainment venue. Built as a cinema in 1910 and originally known as the Palace Electric Theatre, it was adapted as a theatre with a proscenium arch, presenting live shows. It was known as the Civic Hall and Civic Theatre before the current name was revived in 1995. With a seating capacity of 534, the theatre is a mid-scale touring venue. It presents a programme of professional and amateur productions and a yearly pantomime. Mansfield Museum, beside the Palace Theatre in Leeming Street, opened in 1904. and has been based on its present site since 1938. With free entry, it won the Guardian Family-friendly Museum of the Year Award in 2011. Mansfield was home to Venue 44, a nightclub that gave birth to the superclub Renaissance which was operated there in 1992‚Äì1994 by Geoff Oakes and launched the DJ's Sasha, John Digweed, Nigel Dawson and Ian Ossia to global fame. The building was demolished in 2010. The Old Library near the town centre houses a recording studio, meeting room and 100-seat Studio Theatre. Mansfield also has a large multiplex cinema on a new retail and entertainment park outside of the town centre. The previous ABC town-centre cinema was used as a snooker centre until closure in 2012, but late in 2013 it was converted into a church. Mansfield Superbowl, a 28-lane alley with hospitality, opened in 1991. Facing closure in 2014, it was sold and refurbished in 2015. The Intake, a live-music venue in Kirkland Avenue, closed in 2016. The Town Mill, a former waterside mill on the banks of the Maun at the edge of the town centre, was turned into a pub and live music venue in 2002, but closed in 2010, citing the smoking ban, rising beer prices and recession among its reasons for failure. =Sherwood Forest= A few miles outside Mansfield lies Sherwood Forest. Mansfield had an oak tree and a plaque in West Gate to mark what was the centre of Sherwood Forest. Now the tree has been felled and a giant metallic feather has replaced it as a marker. Some residents of the town feel this is an eyesore, and the feather sculpture has been plagued by health and safety problems. =Summer in the Streets= Every year between June and August, Mansfield District Council hosts a Summer in the Streets festival. This consists of various public events held all across the town over many days, such as children's entertainment, fairground rides in the market square, and hands-on workshops for things like crafts and circus skills. The festival highlight is a final event in Titchfield Park called Party in the Park. Its range of entertainment includes live music acts by local bands, performances from local dance groups, and activities such as face painting. For 2012 and 2013, this culminating event was cancelled for austerity reasons. On 21 August 2010 the various summer entertainment arranged by Mansfield District Council included the Irish boy band Westlife in a live concert at Field Mill stadium, home to the town's football team, the Stags. This was the first big-name act to visit the town. Media The local newspapers are the Chad (formerly Chronicle Advertiser) and Mansfield and Ashfield News Journal, a community newspaper. Mansfield's radio station, Mansfield 103.2, broadcasts from Fishpond Hill in Skegby Lane, from a transmitter that also broadcasts Mansfield versions of Nottingham stations Radio Nottingham and Capital FM, on 95.5 and 96.5 FM respectively. DAB broadcasts from Fishpond Hill began on 21 July 2006 with the NOW Nottingham multiplex. Subsequently the Digital One and BBC National muxes were added (during 2006 and 2007). Television reception in Mansfield is often poor due to its location between regions. Historically, Mansfield has been part of the BBC North and Yorkshire Television regions. Between 1965 and 1974, some homes in Mansfield even received Anglia Television. Since the 1995 arrival of Diamond Cable (latterly ntl, then finally Virgin Media), BBC East Midlands and ITV Central East has been provided, and since regionalisation of SKY digital, many residents now receive BBC East Midlands and ITV Central, which are the default channels for this area and appear on channels 101 and 103. Mansfield receives its television signals from various transmitters: Waltham from East Midlands, Emley Moor from South and West Yorkshire, and Belmont from East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. This meant that the celebrations for Rebecca Adlington's success at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, though covered officially by East Midlands Today, could be shown on both East Midlands Today and Look North, so that all the Mansfield area could watch. Politics Mansfield has a directly elected mayor, as one of only 16 places with one in the United Kingdom. Tony Egginton was Mayor of Mansfield from October 2002 until retirement in May 2015, being replaced at scheduled elections by a fellow candidate for the Mansfield Independent Forum political party, Kate Allsop. Much was said of the first Executive Mayor, but during his time in office, Mansfield struggled with local land development and many projects across the region faltered. The Mayor (in office 2002‚Äì2015) was criticised by some councillors and residents for placing too much focus on self-publicity, as opposed to publicity for the town. The issue was raised again after his prominent role in Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington's homecoming ceremony, after her Gold Medal successes at the 2008 Beijing Olympic games. In April 2017, Sophie Whitby was elected to the Mansfield district as a Member of Youth Parliament, on a manifesto that included promoting equality for the LGBT community. Benjamin Bradley has been the constituency (Conservative) Member of Parliament since May 2017, succeeding Sir Alan Meale (Labour), who served the town for 30 years. From 2010 the Parliamentary Constituency boundaries were realigned to include areas to the north of Mansfield around Warsop, previously part of the Bassetlaw constituency. In the news In June 2014, husband and wife Christopher and Susan Edwards were jailed for murdering the woman's parents, William and Patricia Wycherley, whose bodies lay undiscovered in their back garden for 15 years. The couple had stolen thousands of pounds, siphoned off the Wycherleys' pensions and sold their house, amounting to nearly ¬£300,000. The bodies were found after the Edwards gave themselves up, having spent a year in France knowing the DWP intended to interview the murdered Mr Wycherley, who would have been approaching his 100th birthday. Susan Edwards, a former librarian, had written Christmas cards and letters to relatives telling them her parents were travelling in Ireland \\"because of the good air\\" and told neighbours they were in Blackpool or Morecambe. The Edwards were sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 25 years for the murders, concurrent with 9-year sentences for disposing of the bodies and theft. On 30 May 2015, 13-year-old Amber Peat went missing from home after returning from a family holiday. On 2 June her body was found in an area off Westfield Lane, Mansfield, less than a mile from her home. The cause of her death was hanging. An inquest was held at Nottingham Council House in February 2019, with the assistant-Coroner recording a narrative verdict.

The first brig- sloop to be built for the Navy, she was ordered from a commercial builder during the early years of the American War of Independence, and went on to support operations in the English Channel and the Caribbean. Laid up for a time after the end of the American War of Independence, she returned to service shortly before the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. She had an active career in both the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, capturing numerous French privateers and during the Gunboat War participated in a noteworthy single-ship action. The navy withdrew her from service at the beginning of 1811, at which time she was broken up. Construction and commissioning James Mentone, a notable builder of fast vessels at Limehouse, built Childers, one of only two vessels he built for the navy. Although the design was nominally attributed to the Surveyor of the Navy, Sir John Williams, it was approved beforehand on 16 July 1778 as \\"adopted from a current merchant ship design\\" and was probably prepared by Mentone before Williams adapted it to meet Admiralty needs. The lines and hull form were those normally found in cutters rather than in the conventional ship-rigged sloops with three masts then prevalent in British naval service. She was initially described as simply a \\"brig\\", but was re-registered and established as a sloop on 6 August 1779. Launched in September 1778, she was commissioned in October under Commander William Peacock. After the Admiral Rodney's victory at the battle of Cape St. Vincent, Childers, under the command of Captain M'Bride, brought back the dispatches to Britain. However, although she left ten days before , which was carrying the duplicates, Hyaena arrived two days earlier.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.456. French Revolutionary War Commander Robert Barlow recommissioned Childers in January 1791. At this time she was employed in the suppression of smuggling.Marshall (1833), Vol. 4, Part 1, p.270. In 1793 Childers was involved in what became known as the Childers Incident at the start of the French Revolutionary Wars. Childers was the first British warship to be involved in hostilities with the Revolutionary French regime. On 2 January 1793, she was sailing the roadstead of Brest when the forts there fired on her, though only one shot struck her. The 48-pound shot hit a gun and split into three parts, but did not cause any casualties.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 2, p.417.Clarke and McArthur (1840 & 2010), fn. p.178. France did not declare war on Britain until 1 February. Childers captured the French privateer Patriote off the Graveline on 15 February. One month later, on 14 March she destroyed the French privateer Triton. In June 1793 Commander Joshua Mullock took command of Childers. Commander Robert Warburton replaced Mullock in March 1794. In March 1795 the newly promoted Commander Richard Dacres assumed command of Childers. , , , Childers, and the gun-brigs and shared in the proceeds of the capture on 6 July of the Latitia. In August Dacres and Childers sailed \\"with the squadron which was sent to convoy the transports to Quiberon Bay\\".Naval Chronicle, Vol. 26, p.362. On 8 September 1795 Childers rejoined Admiral Sir William Sidney Smith in Diamond off the Rock Douvre, about eight leagues S by SW from Saint Martin's Point, Guernsey.Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, p.31. On his way, Dacres captured the French Coast guard cutter Vigilant (or Vigilante), of six guns, in the Bay of Saint Brieux. This was on 3 September. The day before, Diamond had destroyed the French corvette Assemblee Nationale, and as part of Smith's squadron, Childers shared in the head money for the corvette. Dacres was promoted to post captain and command of on 31 October. In December Command Stephen Poyntz assumed command of Childers. On 10 April 1796 Diamond, , Childers, Camilla, and Syren captured Smuka Piga. Nineteen days later, , Diamond, , Syren, Magicienne, and Camilla, were together when Acquilon captured Mary. Childers shared in the prize money by agreement with Acquilon. On 16 September Childers captured the French privateer Bon Esperence, off Cape Barfleur. Bon Esperence, of two swivel guns and 23 men, was three days out of Cherbourg and had captured the sloop Mary Ann, of Queenborough, sailing from Plymouth to London and Woolwich with naval stores and ordnance. Shortly thereafter, Childers was able to recapture the Mary Ann. Poyntz sent both Bon Esperence and Mary Ann into Portsmouth under escort by the cutter . Towards the end of the month, on the 28th, Childers captured the ship Anna Louisa. and drove a French navy corvette ashore near Barfleur on 13 November. However the British were not able to get close enough to assure her destruction. Then the next morning, Melampus and Childers chased the corvette Etna as she departed Le Havre. Melampus came within range around 15:30. Etna resisted for two hours before striking her colours as Childers joined the battle. Etna was armed with eighteen 12-pounder guns and had a crew of 137 men under the command of Citizen Joseph La Coudrais. The prisoners stated that both corvettes were carrying military and naval stores and that the corvette that had run ashore was the Etonnant.As no French naval vessel of the time bore the name, the ship is question is probably Etnas sister-ship, √âtonnante, of eighteen 18-pounder guns. Both were new ships on their first cruise. The Royal Navy took Etna into service as the 20-gun post ship HMS Cormorant. In February 1797 the government made an advance prize money payment of ¬£8000 to the officers and crews of Melampus and Childers. Commander James O'Brien (or O'Bryen) was appointed captain of Childers on 5 December, and took command in January 1797. On 11 May Childers, in company with , , and the hired armed lugger Duke of York, captured the Nouvelle Eug√©nie. She was a razee privateer of 16 guns and carried a crew of 120 men. She was four days out of Nantes on a 30-day cruise, but had taken no prizes. , , , Melpomene, and Childers shared in the proceeds of the capture on 10 September 1797 of the Tordenskiold. Childers brought into Portsmouth on 28 October the French privateer schooner Furet, pierced for 14 guns but carrying only four 4-pounders, and having a crew of 50 men. Childers had been in company with the frigate when they captured the remarkably fast sailing Furet four days earlier as she was sailing between √éle de Batz and Alreverak her way back to Tregnier. The privateer had been out three weeks and had made only one capture before herself falling prey to the British. Then on 11 January 1798, Childers was in company with Indefatigable and when they captured the French privateer schooner Vengeur, of 12 guns and 72 men. She was quite new and only eight days out of Ostend without having made any captures. Sir Edward Pellew, of Indefatigable, sent her into Falmouth. Between 15 October 1797 and 27 May 1798, Childers captured another privateer, a merchant vessel, and recaptured two merchant vessels as well. The privateer was the Tartare, and the merchant vessel was the Twee Gysberts. The recaptured ships were the Racehorse and the Helen. 200pxthumb Boats from Melpomene and Childers cutting out Aventurier; National Maritime Museum On 4 August Aventurier was under the command of Lieutenant Ren√©-Guillaume Raffi (or Raffy) and anchored in the port of Corr√©jou or Corigiou. Here the boats of and Childers cut her out. British casualties were one man killed, one missing and four wounded. The French casualties were 16 wounded, several mortally. The attack took place at night and in bad weather. To get Aventurier out of the port took two hours because of the weather conditions and took place under fire from the forts that protected the port. All-in-all, the operation was a daring and arduous one. The subsequent court martial of Lieutenant Raffi, who had been wounded at the start of the attack on his vessel, acquitted him for the loss.Troude (1867), Vol. 3, p.140. She was brought into British service as HMS Aventurier. In March 1799 Commander James Coutts Crawford assumed command of Childers. On 4 May Childers and the frigate arrived at the Bay of Cadiz and notified Vice- Admiral Lord Kieth, commander of the British fleet there, that the French fleet had sailed from Brest and that the Spanish fleet had sailed from Ferrol. The next day the French fleet arrived off Cadiz and Kieth sailed to meet them. However no engagement developed and Kieth sailed into Gibraltar on 9 May. In the meantime, Childers had arrived at Gibraltar on the 4th. Lord St Vincent gathered his forces with a view to pursuing the French, who had traversed the Straits of Gibraltar on the 5th. Childers returned to Plymouth. On 8 October she escorted the \\" East India store ship\\" from Plymouth to The Downs.Naval Chronicle Vol 2, p.444. came into Falmouth on 25 March 1800. She had struck a rock in the Penmarks and had taken on a great deal of water. On her way to port she had encountered Childers, which assisted Agamemnon and accompanied her into port.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p.322. The Lady Nelson came into Plymouth the next day with a cargo of fruit. A French privateer had captured her, but Childers had recaptured her.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p.326. On 26 April, Diamond and Childers captured the French brig St Charles. Five days later, Childers and were in sight when the gun-vessel recaptured the brig Adventure, of London, while . That same day they also recaptured the Amy. On 24 October, Childers captured the Spanish privateer lugger Diligent√©. Diligent√© was armed with two 4-pounder guns and four swivel guns, and had a crew of 30 men. She was three days out of Vigo and had taken no prizes. Childers came into Portsmouth in February 1801. She had left Lisbon three weeks earlier, escorting 12 merchant vessels and transports. As she went into Portsmouth the convoy sailed on to the Downs.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.183. Seven plus months later, on 11 September, Childers captured the French brig Sally. Childers shared the proceeds with and . Crawford received promotion to post-captain on 29 April 1802. Commander John Delafons replaced Crawford briefly as he took command in July, and she was paid off in November. When Earl St Vincent and the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty in the Commissioners' yacht visited Plymouth on an inspection tour on 27 August, and Childers fired a salute. The two vessels then moved to Cawsand Bay to remain there for the duration of the visit. They were still there on 5 September.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 8, pp.257-259. Napoleonic Wars Commander Sir William Bolton commissioned Childers in August 1803 for the Mediterranean. On 4 September Childers came into Plymouth from the Hamoaze where she had been refitting.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 10, p.258. Then on 7 September Childers sailed from Plymouth to join a convoy that was assembling at Portsmouth for the Mediterranean.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 10, p.259. , , and Childers shared in the proceeds of the capture on 14 January 1804 of the St. Gieuseppe e L'Allanza. On 24 August and Childers captured the Venscab. In August 1805, Commander John Lake took command of Childers. In an enclosure to a letter dated 7 October 1805, Admiral Lord Nelson wrote, \\"Jalouse, Childers, and Merlin being unfit for the service of this Country, are ordered home with the first Convoy to be repaired\\".Nicholas (1846), Vol. 7, p.85. Still, on 24 December, while serving in the squadron under Vice-Admiral Lord Collingwood, she detained the Ragusan ship Terpsichore, of 280 tons (bm), which was carrying a cargo of sugar, coffee, and the like from Isle de France (Mauritius), to Leghorn.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 15, p.246. Lake's replacement in March 1806 was Commander Thomas Innes. Innes and Childers captured the Danish vessels Johanna Seegmond and Else Christiana on 26 October 1807. On 8 April 1805, during his captivity in France, William Henry Dillon had been promoted to commander, and on obtaining his release in September 1807 he took the command of Childers in early 1808.Marshall (1827), Supplement, Part 1, p.303. In January Childers lay in Leith roads, waiting to escort vessels trading with Gothenburg. The local merchants, however, rejected her protection, put off by her small size and weak armament, which they felt would not enable her to protect them from the privateers in the North Sea. Childers therefore sailed for the Baltic alone, to do what she could to annoy the enemies. In her, late in the afternoon of 14 March 1808, Dillon was sailing towards the south-west the coast of Norway when he sighted a sail. He set out in pursuit and chased the vessel into the small port of Midbe (possibly Midtre Kalvekilen). The local inhabitants sent out boats to retrieve the quarry's cargo, but these dispersed when Childerss boats arrived to cut her out. The party from Childers retrieved the galiot together with her cargo of oil and fish, and despite small arms fire from the shore and rocks heaved down on them from a precipice above where her crew had abandoned the galiot. As the cutting out party returned with the galiot, Dillon observed a large brig sailing out from Hitteroe (probably Flekkefjord), towards Childers, with the apparent intent of recapturing the prize.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 19, pp.282-4. An engagement of some three hours duration developed as the Danish brig hugged the coast. The vessels exchanged broadsides and at one point the Danish brig caught fire forward. Dillon eventually was able to lure the brig out to about three miles off shore. At about 11pm Childers was able to fire a broadside at close range, after which the Dane broke off the engagement and headed back towards Norway. The brig's cannon fire had holed Childers and she had five feet of water in her hold. The crew manned the pumps but Dillon was afraid that she might sink and was not in a position to pursue. He therefore returned to Leith, together with the galiot. (She was probably the Christina.) The Danish vessel was the brig Lougen, of eighteen 18-pounder guns and two 6-pounder stern chasers. Childers, by contrast, had sixteen 12-pounder carronades and two 6-pounder bow chasers. Her crew numbered only about 65 men and boys (including some nine or so on the prize), well short of her establishment of 84; Lougen had a crew of 160.William James, Naval History of Great Britain Vol V, pp.27-30. Childers lost two men killed and nine wounded, among them Dillon, who was severely wounded in both legs. Dillon received promotion to post captain, with date 21 March 1808, and the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund presented him a sword valued at one hundred guineas in acknowledgement of his gallant conduct.Marshall (1827), Supplement, Part 1, p.307. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Childers 14 March 1808\\" to the four surviving claimants from the action. Commander Joseph Packwood replaced the wounded Dillon on Childers, which remained based on the Leith station.Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, pp.314-5. On the morning of 19 October, Childers was 15 leagues off Kinnaird Head when she sighted two sails. She gave chase and after about an hour and a half recaptured the sloop Lord Nelson, in ballast, which a privateer, the second sail that had been sighted, had captured a little earlier that morning. Packwood then set out after the privateer, which she captured in about another hour and a half. The privateer was the Danish sloop Frernskernstern. Frernskernstern was armed with four 4-pounder guns and two swivels, and had a crew of 22 men. She had left her home port of Stavanger on the 15th and had been off the Scottish coast for two days but the Lord Nelson was her only capture. On 7 November , in company with Childers, captured Danish schooner No. 32. Then on 16 August 1809 she was in company with at the capture of the Danish vessel Transport No 52. Childers recaptured the Anna on 8 April 1809. Eleven days later, Childers and captured the Danish galliot Emannuel. On 5 July Childers captured the Hoop and the Nordscandia. Towards the end of the month, on 30 July, Childers captured the Danish galliot Amelia. Nine days later, on 8 August, Childers, captured the Danish privateer Den For Agetede Hensight. Then, Childers captured the Flundrun and Aurora on 10 and 11 November. The next day Childers was in sight when (or Ned Elven) captured the Susanna Catharina. Childers also shared by agreement in Nid Elvens capture of the Wohlfarth, and Hans Barend on 19 November. During 1809, Commander Francis Nott commanded Childers temporarily. Egeria, Capt Lewis Hole, with the Aalborg, Danish Cutter, a prize, in Tow, HM Brig Childers shewing her Nos March 2, 1809 One 1 April 1810, Childers captured the Prussian galliot Anna Maria. She then captured the fishing doggers Zeemeuw, Mercure, Johanna, Christine, and Pappenburg on 15 July. Lastly, Childers captured the Neptunus on 31 October. Between December 1810 and January 1811, the officers and crew of Childers presented the master, George Wilson, an inscribed sword. Wilson had jumped into the sea at the risk of his own life to rescue a seaman who had fallen from the fore-yard-arm and was sinking.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 25, p.69. Fate Childers was finally paid off from service in January 1811 and broken up in the following month. Packwood was promoted to post captain on 14 February 1811.

History and culture Shia Islam has a long pedigree in Egypt. The Shia Fatimids came to power in 969 AD in Egypt; they established a new capital called Cairo as the seat of the Fatimid dynasty. Fatimids ruled Egypt for 200 years (969 -1171) and shaped its identity. They also established the famous al-Azhar University in 970 AD in Cairo as a university, founded in order to spread knowledge throughout the world; the university exists to this day and is one of the oldest universities in the world. Al-Azhar was originally a Shia university. However, it is generally accepted that before, during and after the Fatimid rule in Egypt, the people of Egypt were and continued to remain predominantly Sunni, with Ismailism being followed by the ruling classes, rather than the general populace. Even today, Egypt remains a country with strong Shia ties. Egyptian Sunnis especially followers of Sufi denominations visit revered Shia shrines and mosques dedicated to Hussein, Hasan, Zainab, Ali, and other Shia Imams, and unwittingly incorporate Shia practices into their traditions and funerary rites. The number of Shia in Egypt is growing, and there have been several cases of Sunnis converting to Shiism. Following are few Egyptian Shia organizations: * 'Congregation of Ahl Al-Bayt' ('the family of Prophet Mohamed') headed by Mohamed El-Derini. * 'Shia Current in Egypt' headed by Mohamed Ghoneim Population estimates While Shia activists claim the number exceeds one million, the Salafists say there are only a few thousand. According to The Economist, estimates range from 50,000 to one million. Minority Rights Group International estimates Egyptian Shia population to range from 800,000 to two million out of Egypt‚Äôs total population of about 90 million.https://minorityrights.org/minorities/shia-of-egypt/ Persecution According to Brian Whitaker, in Egypt, the small Shia population is harassed by the authorities and treated with suspicion, being arrested - ostensibly for security reasons - but then being subjected to torrents of abuse by state security officers for their religious beliefs. For decades, international organisations ‚Äì including the UN, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International ‚Äì have documented instances in which Egyptian Shias have been targeted for their religious beliefs. A December 2012 report by UN refugee agency UNHCR highlighted the fact that Shias still cannot openly practice their religious rituals in Egypt. Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui told the UNHCR that many groups were being prosecuted for alleged 'blasphemy.' US Commission on International Religious Freedom continues to label Egypt as a \\"country of particular concern\\" in terms of systematic violations of religious freedom. In December 2011, Egyptian security forces prevented hundreds of Shias from observing Ashura religious celebrations in Cairo's El-Hussein Mosque, a Shia holy site. Police forcibly removed the Shia worshippers from the mosque after Salafi groups accused them of performing barbaric rituals. In May 2012, Al-Azhar Grand Imam Ahmed El-Tayeb chaired a meeting with Islamist forces ‚Äì including scholars, Muslim Brotherhood members and Salafists ‚Äì at which they declared their total rejection of \\"attempts to spread Shiism in Egypt.\\" On 23 June 2013, after months of wahhabi propaganda in the area, several hundred misguided Sunni Muslims attacked and surrounded the house of Shia cleric Hasan Shahhata (an ex-Sunni) in the village of Abu Mussalam in Giza Province. The mob killed the cleric and three of his followers and dragged their bodies on the streets. The police did nothing to stop the attack. Amnesty's Deputy Director of Middle East Programs Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui said on 25 June 2013, \\"The Egyptian authorities must immediately order an independent and impartial investigation into the killing of the four men, and send a clear message that carrying out attacks and inciting violence against Shiite Muslims will not be tolerated.\\" As of 2017, the NGOs still report that violence and propaganda against the Shia minority continues. Shia Muslims are frequently denied services in addition to being called derogatory names. Anti-Shia sentiment is spread through education at all levels. Clerics educated at Al-Azhar University publicly promote sectarian beliefs by calling Shia Muslims infidels and encourage isolation and marginalization of Shia Muslims in Egypt.Shia Rights Watch: Egypt: For the people or against the people?

He wrote books on alchemy and on Hermeticism. In addition to other works on alchemy, Fictuld published Der L√§ngst gew√ºnschte und versprochene chymisch- philosophische Probier-Stein, auf welchem sowohl der wahrhafften hermetischen Adeptorum als der verf√ºhrischen und betriegerischen Sophisten Schrifften sind probirt und nach deren Werth dargestellt worden, beschrieben in zweyen Classen (1753), an annotated bibliography of alchemical writings. In the second edition Fictuld distinguishes between those he considers true adepts and sophists or charlatans. He criticized the works of alchemists such as DJW (Dorothea Juliana Wallich) with \\"great severity\\", castigating them as fit only for burning. Hermann Fictuld was one of the leaders of the Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross, whose origins he traced to the Order of the Golden Fleece. The Golden and Rosy Cross was first written about by Samuel Richter ('Sincerus Rinatus') in Breslau in 1710. Fictuld led an extensive reform in the organization in the 1760s and 1770s. Fictuld's Aureum Vellus oder Goldenes Vliess (1749) may have offered a common foundation which appealed to a variety of existing Hermetic groups. Fictuld corresponded with theosopher Friedrich Christoph Oetinger. In his recreation of the Order, Fictuld sought a return to \\"old ways and ceremonies\\" representing the \\"veneration of God and the welfare of humankind.\\" The Aureum Vellus was widely read and may have led to the Order's integration into the Society of Freemasons. Substitution cipher, from page 380 of Azoth et Ignis by Hermann Fictuld Some believe that Hermann Fictuld's real identity was Baron Johann Friedrich von Meinstorff, based on a substitution cipher at the end of one of his books, p. 380 of Azoth et Ignis, Das ist, das wahre Elementarische Wasser und Feuer Oder Mercurius Philosophorum, Als das einige nothwendige der Fundamental-Uranf√§nge und Principiorum des Steins der Weisen, 1749.

Only one was completed. thumb Design and development Sch√ºtte-Lanz were best known for their airships, but they also designed and built aeroplanes though none went into production. The Idflieg G designation letter applied to twin engine aircraft, though this machine, Sch√ºtte-Lanz's first twin, originally fell into the early K class reserved for heavy military aeroplanes. The German engineer Wilhelm Hillmann designed the G.I around 1914 in Mannheim-Rheinau. It crashed on the landing field of the Luftschiffbau Sch√ºtte-Lanz by sticking into a rabbit hole during the landing. thumb The G.I was a two bay triplane, the bays separated by parallel pairs of interplane struts. The wings were unswept and had constant chord and blunt tips. The upper span was significantly greater than that of the lower wing, so its tips were supported by extra, outward leaning parallel pairs of struts; there was little stagger. Only the upper wing carried ailerons, which had trailing edges projecting behind that of the wing. The ailerons were operated by wires from the ends of long levers, each projecting above and below the wing. The Mercedes D.III six cylinder inline engines were mounted on the lower wing's upper surface in the inner bay and largely uncowled. These drove pusher configuration propellers beyond the trailing edge via long shafts. The fuselage of the G.I had a five sided cross- section, with a flat top, converging sides and a shallow V-shaped underside. There was an open gunner's position in the blunt extreme nose, which was rounded in plan. The upper wing, well above the open pilot's cockpit, had a narrow central slot in it to improve his upwards vision. The tailplane was extremely broad chord, reaching forward almost to mid-fuselage, but there was no fixed fin, only a small, comma shaped, balanced rudder. It had a conventional, fixed undercarriage with double mainwheels on a single axle, mounted on multiple V-struts and with a braced tailskid.

(aka Carmen I) was a live theatrical, edutainment program including a planetarium film, that is now licensed to planetariums across the US, Canada, and Japan. Started in 1999, the show featured the effects work of Adrian Ropp, produced by Dr. William A. Gutsch and composed by Mark Mercury. The program was \\"modeled quite closely after the very successful television [TV] programs, Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? and Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego?. There was a conscious decision to design it as a \\"fast paced 'quiz show in outer space' but fashioned to foster and hone listening and math skills rather than requiring the audience to quickly recall pre-learned trivia\\". The program also encouraged audience participation, by answering questions to score points. Where in the Universe is Carmen Sandiego? - II (aka Carmen II) was later created, and included \\"over 30 minutes of original 3-D character and astronomical special effects animation\\". Both shows were written, produced, and directed by the author under license from Broderbund Software, Inc. Both programs utilize a model which \\"interfac[ed] a live teacher / presenter and the audience with famous characters recognized by children in a highly interactive setting. The Carmen products' goal was to \\"create even higher end products by utilizing large amounts of 3-D color computer animation yet, at the same time, make the shows affordable to as many planetariums as possible\\".http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.ips- planetarium.org/resource/resmgr/pdf-conf/2002_proc_Wichita-LoRes.pdf#page=93 These films also featured Lynne Thigpen as \\"The Chief\\" and Rita Moreno as Carmen Sandiego, reprising their roles from the TV shows and videos games of recent years. They marked Thigpen's final appearance of the franchise before her death of a cerebral hemorrhage on March 12, 2003. The Carmen Sandiego website notes that though \\"timelines are unclear\\", the fact that they were both produced prior to Thigpen's death provides a clue. The site estimates Carmen i being released in 2001, and Carmen II being released in 2003. However, Carmen I premiered at the Omniplex in 1998., and Reservoir says the show premiered on February 13, 1998. IPS 2000 Conference suggests Carmen II was in production as of 2000. The shows are still going as of 2013. The 55 minute show is recommended for grades 2-4. The show is hosted by an actor, and accompanied by music and graphics of the PBS gameshows World and Time. Where in the Universe Is Carmen Sandiego? Poster for Where in the Universe Is Carmen Sandiego? The show was written and produced by Dr. Bill Gutsch, producer of the Sesame Street show \\"Wonderful Sky\\". Proceedings of the International Planetarium Society Conference explained the Carmen I's production: \\"To amass the necessary funding to create the program, a consortium of eight planetariums in the US and Canada was assembled by the author with each institution contributing $7200 to the production budget for the first Carmen show. Animation was provided by a variety of sources including Broderbund Software, Inc., Sky-Skan, Inc., and Evan & Sutherland. Video of talent in costume and make up was recorded on a large Ultimat sound stage in New Jersey with backgrounds and special effects added in post production. Five-part harmonies by Rockapella...were recorded at a sound studio in New York, mixed down from 14 tracks on ADAT to stereo on DAT and lip synced on the sound stage. Final video and audio elements were created and assembled on D1 and Betacam SP and converted, after final mix, to a pair of laser discs. To help create and preserve visual realism, panorama and all-sky environments for the show were created by Brian Sullivan as 3-D models which were then lit and photographed by individual planetariums to achieve best fit for their particular projection systems. The end result was a program which utilized highly recognized, franchised characters linked to television, computer games, and other merchandise, on-camera talent who had Tony, Oscar, Emmy, and Grammy Awards to their credit, and featured state-of-the-art 3-D color computer animation for a fraction of the cost to each institution that the show cost to produce as a whole\\". Michael Clark established the Clark Foundation, whose first donation - an $8,000 gift - was given to the planetarium in 1997 to help produce 'Where in the Universe is Carmen Sandiego.http://www.sepadomes.org/journal/SS23_3.pdf Carmen I has been shown in over two dozen planetariums in the US, Canada, and Japan, has beaten attendance records for IMAX movies in the same location, increased overall annual attendance in individual planetariums by as much as 97%, and been over 800% more successful than all competing educational planetarium programs in the same theaters. The show has been highly praised by both teachers and students. A color show poster and a Teacher's Guide pack with pre- and post visit activities were also produced to complement the show. ArtsPartners describes the show thus: Features a tour of our solar system in a story based on a popular television series. Carmen Sandiego has stolen the rings of Saturn, and it is the mission of the audience, each an Official Gumshoe of the Acme Detective Agency, to track Carmen down as she eludes her pursuers. The Planetarium's Head Gumshoe uses video effects, computer animations, NASA footage, and All Sky ship interiors to encourage class participation in the search to bring Carmen to justice. (55 mm.)\\".http://www.artspartners.net/files/resourcesmodule/@random419cfd28bc9db/ArtsPartners_EdGuide.pdf The show is for grades 2-6. Children under 3 and museum members were admitted free. A live actor plays the role of Wanda Ketchum (i.e. 'wander catch em'). Where in the Universe is Carmen Sandiego? - II Poster for Where in the Universe Is Carmen Sandiego? - II The financial success of Carmen I allowed a sequel, Carmen II, to be produced. While Carmen I covered only the Solar System, Carmen II explored: stars, multiple stars, star clusters, stellar evolution, supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, and the size/structure of the Milky Way Galaxy. The show had higher production values than the original, with the team using \\"all the same production and education devices that made ‚ÄúCarmen I‚Äù such a success while, at the same time, increasing both the amount and quality of the computer animation employed\\". Many affiliated institutions contributed both funding and animation, giving the show extra talent such as that by animators: Salt Lake's Aaron McEuen, Houston's Tony Butterfield, Dickson's Weiherng Lee and Kevin Scott, and Vancouver's Erik Koelemeyer. The character and black hole animation was produced by a team of California animators.

Again, a poster and an extensive Teacher's Guide were provided with the show. The second show was highly successful program which \\"cost each consortium participant, and subsequent purchaser, only $6200\\", in a situation where the animation alone would have cost over $200,000. ‚ÄúCarmen I‚Äù and ‚ÄúCarmen II‚Äù demonstrated that \\"very successful production and fiscal models have been developed for the creation of high end educational planetarium programming\\".

Gumshoes use their knowledge of the stars, nebulae, and other galactic objects to track Carmen down and bring her once again to justice!\\" Reception The shows on the whole have received positive reviews. Tourist Cliff Calderwood said the show \\"turned out to be a fun, enjoyable, and interactive way of discovering all kinds of interesting facts about our solar system. And the announcers and hosts of the Planetarium really get into the spirit of the quest. You don‚Äôt just get a bunch of awesome facts thrown at you\\". Matt Alspaugh, show operator for the planetarium shows at Unitarian Universalism gave a uniquely< mixed review, saying: \\"I‚Äôve tried to recall what it was about this show that caused me to hate it so much. It was this kind of low-brow, cartoonish, punny, show wedged in between the hard science stuff I loved. The kids love it though, and I was turning into a curmudgeon...I suspect that if I were to go back to that show now, I‚Äôd judge it less and enjoy it more.\\" Marcos Stafne noted \\"Carmen was one of the hardest theatre experiences I‚Äôve ever performed because of the difficulty of capturing anyone's attention when a giant Saturn was flying over my head.\\" References External links *New Licenses for \\"Where in the Universe is Carmen Sandiego?\\" Archived *Where in the Universe is Carmen Sandiego 1 at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum *Where in the Universe is Carmen Sandiego II at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum *\\"Where Is Carmen Now?\\" *EXPO2012: Yeosu, Korea *\\"Space Thief\\" in The Register-Guard *\\"3 Utah planetariums educate 150,000 visitors each year\\" in the Deseret News * *Beyond the Stars High Technology Hurtles Through Space at Gates Planetarium in the Rocky Mountain News * *\\"On the Towns; Going Out\\" in The New York Times Category:Carmen Sandiego ","title":"Where in the Universe Is Carmen Sandiego?"},{"id":"40101812","text":"Podmalinsko Monastery () or Tu≈°inski Monastery is a Serbian Orthodox monastery near ≈†avnik in modern-day Montenegro (then Kingdom of Serbia).  Etymology  The name of the monastery is derived from the name of the village Malinsko on the hill Kravica, on the other side of the river Bukovica. It means beneath () Malinsko. The monastery was also referred to as Tu≈°inski Monastery after the nearby village Tu≈°ina.  Location and buildings  The monastery is situated in the valley of river Bukovica, next to its right bank, between the villages of Malinsko and Tu≈°ina in the region traditionally belonging to Drobnjaci and to Uskoci. The church of the monastery is dedicated to St. Michael. St. Michael was slava of Nemanjiƒá family. North of the church there are ruins of the various buildings that once belonged to this monastery and small graveyard with the grave of Mirko Aleksiƒá, a notable voivode of Malinsko who cut off the head of Smail-aga ƒåengiƒá, killed by unknown Montenegrin fighter in 1840 on Mletiƒçak plateau near the monastery.  History  It is believed to be built by Stephen Uro≈° I of Serbia around 1252. According to the legend, he built this monastery right after Stefan Vukanoviƒá Nemanjiƒá built Moraƒça Monastery. People were lined along route between the stone mine in Tu≈°ina village and the construction site of Moraƒça Monastery. When building of the Moraƒça Monastery was completed the stones that remained in the hands of the lined people were returned to place near the mine and used to build Podmalinsko Monastery. The monastery was destroyed and rebuilt many times in its history. The monastery was gathering place of the members of Drobnjaci tribe who traditionally held meetings there, last time in 1840 to decide to inform Njego≈° about their intention to kill Smail-aga ƒåengiƒá. After this event Ottomans plundered Drobnjaci and destroyed the monastery.

Life Redhead was born and brought up in Barbuda, to a mother who was a freed slave from Barbuda and a father who was an Antiguan plantation owner and manager. He was subsequently taken to England, and raised at Little Eaton, in Derbyshire. In Paris in 1792 he witnessed Louis XVI's appearance before the convention, and was close to the Sheares brothers, and others of the so-called \\"British Club\\". He fell out with the British radicals over revolutionary politics, getting into disputes with John Oswald. He baulked at a clause in a proposed and defeated resolution of 11 January 1793 encouraging an English insurgency;John Goldworth Alger, The British Colony in Paris, 1792-93, The English Historical Review Vol. 13, No. 52 (Oct., 1898), pp. 672-694, at pp. 675‚Äì6. Published by: Oxford University Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/547882 and as a result was denounced by the economic writer Robert Rayment. Redhead was then the target of an arrest warrant made out by Jacques-Louis David, and left France.William Hauptman, \\"The Blood-Stained Brush\\": David and the British circa 1802, The British Art Journal Vol. 10, No. 3 (Winter/Spring 2009/10), pp. 78-97, at p. 82. Published by: The British Art Journal. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/41615112 From this time Redhead added Yorke to his name. On his return to England Yorke joined a radical society at Derby, which sent him in 1793 to Sheffield to assist another such society. On 7 April 1794 he addressed a large outdoor meeting at Sheffield, convened to petition for a pardon to Scottish radicals convicted in political trials and to promote the abolitionist cause. He was arrested for the expression of revolutionary sentiments, and at the York spring assize of 1795 true bills were found against him for conspiracy, sedition, and libel. On 23 July 1795 Yorke was tried at York before Sir Giles Rooke for conspiracy, in the absence of his co- defendants, including Joseph Gales, who had absconded. Yorke, advocated parliamentary reform, but declared himself opposed to violence and anarchy. On 27 November 1795 he was sentenced by the King's Bench to two years' imprisonment in Dorchester Castle, fined, and required to give sureties of good behaviour for seven years. Yorke was released in March 1798. His writings from then on showed support for the war policy of the Pitt administration, and he wrote on 3 August 1798 a private letter to William Wickham condemning the views of the Sheares brothers. He was a student of the Inner Temple from 1801, and revisited France in 1802. In 1806 he was near having a duel with Sir Francis Burdett, both parties being bound over to keep the peace. Yorke suffered periods of serious illness, and died at Chelsea on 28 January 1813. Works In 1792, under his original name Redhead, he published a pamphlet against the abolition of slavery, but his opinions changed soon afterwards. In a Letter to the Reformers (Dorchester, 1798), written in prison, Yorke justified the war with France. He wrote letters for twelve months in The Star under the signature of Alfred or Galgacus (these were reprinted in a short volume), and was part proprietor of the True Briton. In 1801, and again in 1811, Yorke issued synopses of lectures in London on political and historical subjects. After a bout of illness, he was asked by Richard Valpy to undertake an expansion of John Campbell's Lives of British Admirals, but left the work incomplete. Yorke also published: * a letter to John Frost (1750‚Äì1842), entitled These are the Times that try Men's Souls, 1793; * a report on his trial, 1795; * Thoughts on Civil Government, 1800; * Annals of Political Economy, 1803; * Letters from France, 1804; * Mr Redhead Yorke's Political Review, 1805‚Äì11.

It is located in D√ºlmen in western M√ºnsterland. It is at the crossing of the Wanne- Eickel‚ÄìHamburg and the Dortmund‚ÄìEnschede railways. History The Cologne- Minden Railway Company (, CME) received a concession on 28 May 1866 to build a railway from Wanne to Osnabr√ºck. This would be part of the inter-regional Hamburg‚ÄìVenlo railway, which in turn would be part of an international Paris‚ÄìHamburg railway. On 1 January 1870, the CME started passenger operations on the first section between Wanne station (now Wanne-Eickel Central Station (Hauptbahnhof)) on its trunk line and M√ºnster station (now M√ºnster (Westfalen) Hauptbahnhof) and it opened the first D√ºlmen station at the same time. Germany and the Netherlands agreed on 13 November 1874 to establish a direct rail link between Enschede and Dortmund. The Dortmund-Gronau-Enschede Railway Company (Dortmund-Gronau-Enscheder Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, DGE) was established for this purpose and the first section was opened to L√ºnen station (now L√ºnen Nord) already on 25 November 1874. D√ºlmen DGE station was opened half a kilometre northwest of the Cologne-Minden station on 15 June 1875 and a grade- separated crossing was created during the building of the next section of the DGE to D√ºlmen. On 1 August 1875, the line was extended to the Coesfeld (Westf) station. After the nationalisation of the (nominally) private railway companies and their absorption by the Prussian state railways, D√ºlmen DGE station was renamed D√ºlmen Ost (east) station, although it was just west of the Cologne-Minden station. With the construction of a curve north of the station between the two previously independent lines connecting the lines towards Coesfeld and M√ºnster, the station became a junction station in practice. In the 1950s, passengers operations were moved from D√ºlmen Ost station to a high-level platform built at D√ºlmen station, so that D√ºlmen station was now a ‚Äútower‚Äù station (Turmbahnhof, that is a station with superimposed platforms on two levels).(special edition: 1311‚Äì2011, 700 years of the town of D√ºlmen) The connecting curve was closed and dismantled in the 1990s. East of the station there was formerly a connecting curve connecting the lines towards M√ºnster and L√ºnen. This was destroyed in the Second World War and was never rebuilt; the rest of the track is still used as a siding. Neither connecting curves were used for passenger services. The station building that was opened on 20 May 1964 is located on the corner of the intersection that is north of the Wanne-Eickel‚ÄìHamburg line and west of the Dortmund‚ÄìEnschede line. The station building built by the Cologne-Minden Railway Company was demolished in 1977.

Description  Close-up of the head Apoderus coryli can reach a length of .D. V. Alford Pests of Fruit Crops: A Color Handbook These primitive weevils have a red shiny bell-shaped pronotum, a shiny black or dark brown head with protruding eyes, a distinct neck and short and rounded elytra. Their straight antennae are inserted near the base of the rostrum. The prothorax is much narrower than the base of the elytra on the abdomen. The scutellum is broad, triangular to trapezoidal and without stripes. The legs are red at the base, black towards the end.Attelabidae Leaf- Roller Weevils Larvae can reach approximately a body length of . They are bright orange with a brown head. Also pupae are orange and reach a length of about . This species is rather similar to the oak roller weevil (Attelabus nitens) and Apoderus erythropterus, that shows a black pronotum. All three species produce leaf wraps into which the eggs are laid. Biology Adults can be found between May and September. They feed on leaves of the host plant, the hazel (Corylus avellana), hence the Latin name coryli of the species, meaning hazelnut. Only in exceptional cases other deciduous trees, such as alder (Alnus species), birch (Betula species), common hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), common beech (Fagus sylvatica) and hop-hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia) are used as host plants. Behavior After mating in May‚ÄìJune the females cut slits into leaves and rolls up these leaves into cigar-shaped cylinders or ‚Äòcradles‚Äô. Then they lay 5 to 6 yellowish eggs inside them, through a hole made with the rostrum. The time of oviposition may take several weeks. Several cylinders per day are produced. The developing larvae will feed and pupate in these the leaf wraps. The new adult beetles will emerge in the summer (at the end of June or early of August). There are two generations per year (bivoltine species). The larvae of the second generation overwinter in said cylinders and pupate in the spring.

C·ªëc C·ªëc is available for the Windows, Windows Phone and macOS operating systems and supports both English and Vietnamese. C·ªëc C·ªëc also has a search engine called C·ªëc C·ªëc Search Engine Overview C·ªëc C·ªëc is among the five most popular browsers in Vietnam, according to data from StatCounter. A majority of the features found in C·ªëc C·ªëc, as well as its quality and stability, are similar to Google Chrome's. Significantly, C·ªëc C·ªëc also contains functionality that is useful to Vietnamese users: automatic typing aid, faster downloads, ability to bypass DNS blocking and to download audio and video from popular sites, and integrated English-Vietnamese dictionary and spell-checking. Another included feature, less common in popular browsers, is the support for the BitTorrent protocol via the download user interface. According to Vn Review, a software technical review website, these tailored features add more value that put C·ªëc C·ªëc on the map and differentiate C·ªëc C·ªëc from other Chromium-based browsers. History The first version of the browser was presented under the brandname C·ªù R√¥m+ on 4 December 2012 (C·ªù R√¥m is basically the Vietnamese pronunciation of Chrome). At that time, the interface of C·ªëc C·ªëc was similar to that of Google Chrome, but the browser had already integrated two features: the ability to download files to multiple streams and storage of media contentƒê√°nh gi√° C·ªù R√¥m+ tr√¨nh duy·ªát web \\"Made in Vi·ªát Nam\\" The browser was officially submitted five months later 14 May 2013. with two new features introduced: automatic typing aid and bypassing DNS blocking. To date, the developer group has published 6 additional features. Two months after official release, the number of C·ªëc C·ªëc users in Vietnam surpassed Opera and later outperformed Safari and Internet Explorer. On 2 April 2014, C·ªù R√¥m+ was officially re- branded as the C·ªëc C·ªëc browser, with a new browser icon design released, to unify the company's brands under that name: C·ªëc C·ªëc Search Engine, C·ªëc C·ªëc browser and Nh√† Nh√† mobile app. In October 2017, C·ªëc C·ªëc has reached to the new record of number of users with more than 22 million people and ranked as the second popular browser in Vietnam after Google Chrome . Features * C·ªëc C·ªëc has a mechanism to perform reverse domain name resolution, allowing the bypassing of blocked websites (including Facebook) on DNS. This feature debuted on 14 May 2013, in the first official release of the browser * C·ªëc C·ªëc is equipped with a system that automatically analyzes to add lingual tone to Vietnamese text. It allows the user to enter Vietnamese text without need of applications like Unikey and Vietkey. When users type any text without tone, C·ªëc C·ªëc will suggest the most likely variants of tone arrangements, once processed on the C·ªëc C·ªëc server. Developers say that the addition of text tone suggestions increases typing speed by up to 50% among regular users (those who cannot fluently type with 10 fingers) and 20% among advanced users. * To further support the Vietnamese language, C·ªëc C·ªëc automatically detects spelling mistakes, underlining and suggesting corrections with 94% accuracy. According to some experiments, C·ªëc C·ªëc outperforms Google Chrome's spell- checker in 97 cases out of 100. The developer group estimates that this feature saves users up to 4‚Äì10 days per year to type and review documents. * C·ªëc C·ªëc incorporates an English-Vietnamese dictionary, assisting English learners or international newspaper subscribers from elementary to the advanced level. When users double click into any English word, a small box will appear on site, showing meaning and pronunciation of the word. * C·ªëc C·ªëc is able to find media content (audio, video) on most streaming websites and save it to the computer for viewing or listening offline, by one click on an icon on toolbar. Except for several premium websites, all popular streaming websites, for example, YouTube and Dailymotion, are downloadable on the browser.Tr√¨nh duy·ªát C·ªù R√¥m+: L∆∞·ªõt Facebook vi vu, t·ª± th√™m d·∫•u ti·∫øng vi·ªát * Files are downloaded in multiple streams, which under certain conditions can accelerate download speeds by up to eight times, depending on the bandwidth of the Internet connections and the speed at which the server sends files. At present, an option to increase or decrease the downloading speed is not provided. * Unlike Google Chrome and most other browsers based on Chromium, which removes and cancels all pending downloads when the browser is closed, C·ªëc C·ªëc is able to save and resume partial downloads (assuming that the server hosting the file supports this feature). Market share According to data published by comScore in September 2014 and StatCounter in November 2014, use of C·ªëc C·ªëc surpassed Firefox and with a share of 18.25% became the second most used browser in Vietnam after Google Chrome (also based on Chromium), at 49.59% (combined at 67.84%). Previously, according to data published by StatCounter in February 2014, C·ªëc C·ªëc had overtaken Internet Explorer and Firefox to become one of the top browsers in Vietnam\\" User feedback and issues * DNS bypassing feature gets huge traction from the community. Users feedback on this feature as the most practical one regarding unstable access to Facebook in Vietnam, since it is much faster and more convenient than conventional addition of software like Hotspot Shield or Ultrasurf, which usually brings some side effects like Internet connection slowdown or third party advertising. * Tone-addition system for Vietnamese text shares the database of C·ªëc C·ªëc Search Engine, another of product of the company C·ªëc C·ªëc, which is known as the largest database of websites in Vietnamese.

Plot Ashok (Saif Ali Khan) and Kumar (Riteish Deshmukh) are best friends, whereas Shanaya (Tamannaah Bhatia) and Mishti (Bipasha Basu) are their love interests. Ashok's father is a multi millionaire but has been in a coma for the last six years, while his wicked maternal uncle, Kunwar Amarnath Singh a.k.a. Mamaji (Ram Kapoor) teams up with an evil doctor, Dr. Khan (Nawab Shah) to get rid of Ashok and take over all his property. During a board meeting Mamaji mixes a medicine in Ashok and Kumar's drink and they both start behaving like dogs. They are taken to a mental asylum for treatment by Dr. Shivani (Esha Gupta), who soon realises the truth and promises to discharge them. But fate takes a twist as two lookalikes of Ashok and Kumar being treated in the same hospital's 'B' ward, who work for Bijlani (Chunkey Pandey), a cocaine smuggler, are accidentally released instead of the true ones. Shanaya and Mishti take them to Ashok's mansion where Singh understands the whole mix-up and plans to use the duplicate Ashok to become the owner of the whole business empire. Now the true Ashok and Kumar also come to know of Mamaji's evil plan but are stuck in the asylum. They are offered help by one of the ward boys, Cyrus (Darshan Jariwala), who takes them to a secret ward 'C' to meet 'Johnny' who is a look alike of Mamaji but has a dangerous habit of attacking people who sneeze in front of him. Ashok and Kumar plan revenge against Singh with the help of Johnny but get caught by the warden Y. M. Raj (Satish Shah) before they can escape from the asylum. Y. M. Raj prepares to punish them but accidentally sneezes in front of them. Angered by this, Johnny beats him black and blue, thus helping the three escape. On the day of the board meeting, the true Ashok and Kumar get ready to expose Mamaji, when Dr. Khan triggers the fire alarm. All the three mental patients escape the building. Now desperate, Ashok and Kumar bump into a dance bar owner Balbir, the triplicate of Mamaji while Mamaji also arranges another set of Ashok and Kumar with the help of plastic surgery from Dr. Khan's two assistants who assume their identities. He takes the triplicate Ashok and Kumar to the House of Commons where the fake Ashok is to hand over all the business to him in the presence of Prince Charles but the real Ashok and Kumar arrive along with Balabir. To add to the confusion the three mental patients also storm in to help the real Ashok and Kumar creating panic among the eyewitnesses on seeing so many lookalikes together. The film closes with Ashok's father coming out of his coma and recognizing the true Ashok and getting Mamaji arrested for his deeds.

It's disturbing to see such an atrocious, regressive, misogynistic, sexist, homophobic cinematic product force-fed to paying audiences. I can understand that a comedy need not be 'safe', but what goes on in Humshakals is simply too horrifying to bear.\\" Sweta Kaushal of Hindustan Times rated the film 0.5 out of 5 and stated \\"With no story or comedy on offer, even Riteish and Ram are unable to save the day for Sajid Khan.\\" Mohar Basu of Koimoi gave it 0/5 stars and said the film was \\"[l]oaded with indecipherable dim wit\\" and \\"an odd mishmash of pathos and drudgery.\\" Writing in Emirates 24/7, Sneha May Francis claimed that it succeeded Khan's previous endeavor, Himmatwala, in becoming the worst Bollywood film ever. Critic Sonia Chopra of Sify.com wrote \\"there are bad movies, and then there's Humshakals. The worst film of 2014 so far, in my book\\".

Taurani under Tips Industries Limited. Based on an original story by K. Subash, the film stars Akshay Kumar and Junior - The Wonder Dog, along with Tamannaah, Mithun Chakraborty, Johnny Lever, Prakash Raj and Sonu Sood. The Film was released on 8 August 2014.  Plot  The film starts with Akhil Lokhande (Akshay Kumar) getting paid for doing an ad, where he gets into a fight, as he wasn't paid the full amount of money that they had promised. This continues with a few other assignments, where Akhil constantly gets underpaid, resulting in a fight, ends the fight when he gets a phone call, and says he has to go somewhere. He then arrives on a shoot where Sakshi (Tamannaah Bhatia) is shooting for her television series. After her shoot lets out, they go for a walk around the park, observing other couples. At the end of their walk, Akhil proposes Saakshi. Akhil and Saakshi go to her father's (Mithun Chakraborty) house, where they are told that until Akhil becomes rich, he can't marry Saakshi. Akhil goes to his film-obsessed friend, Jugnu's (Krushna Abhishek) shop. He tells him that he is going to visit his father at the hospital because he has chest pain. However, his father Mr. Lokhande (Darshan Jariwala), is actually acting and is dancing around with the nurse, only staying in the hospital because it has service like a 5-star hotel. Akhil arrives just in time to hear and see this, and goes to beat up Mr. Lokhande when he reveals that Akhil is adopted and his real father wasn't ready for a child so his mother left, but was killed in a train crash. Luckily Akhil survived, and when the railway officers were giving one lakh rupees for the families who's even one member dies, he adopted Akhil to claim the compensation. Akhil, in a fit of rage, beats him up. He goes back to his house, and opens the chest that he never had before, which contains love letters from his real father, to his mother, and a locket with his father and mother's pictures. He discovers that his father is Pannalal Johri (Dalip Tahil) who is a billionaire in Bangkok. Right as he finds this, on the television comes news that Pannalal Johri is dead and his 30 billion's($480,000,000 in 2014) will go to anyone who can prove that they are related to Pannalal Johri. He then meets Johri's lawyer Habibullah (Johnny Lever). After arriving at the Johri mansion, his father's house at Bangkok, Akhil discovers that a dog named 'Entertainment' is the owner of Johri's property, and is actually Johri's pet dog. He relays this to Jugnu, and they try to kill Entertainment, by having Akhil become Entertainment's caretaker, but fail. Saakshi and her father surprise Akhil at the mansion, and discover that Entertainment is the heir, causing the father to declare that Saakshi will never marry Akhil. At this time 2 brothers, Karan Johri (Prakash Raj) and Arjun Johri (Sonu Sood), the 2nd cousins of Johri, escape jail. Karan and Arjun want to kill Akhil, because they figure that the dog will die in a couple of years anyway, and thus while Akhil is attempting to kill Entertainment, they do the same to Akhil by drowning him under a thinly iced lake. Karan and Arjun hit the ground at the same time as Akhil causing him to nearly fall in, but Entertainment saves the former, and falls into the lake instead. After a lot of efforts, Akhil fails to save Entertainment but suddenly he comes out of the water and they develop feelings for each other. Akhil realizes his mistake and learns that Entertainment is a good hearted dog so he becomes his friend and leaves the mansion. Karan and Arjun, citing their legal connections very well, inappropriately acquire the property from Entertainment. Akhil learns this news and returns. He vows that he'll get the property back for Entertainment. Akhil's strategy is to divide the two brothers and conquer. He manages to get a job as a servant at the mansion, now owned by Karan and Arjun. Akhil attempts to split the two brothers, first by introducing Saakshi who seduces the two brothers separately. However, the scheme fails as background music reunites the two brothers. Akhil again attempts trying to split the two brothers, this time by introducing a false impression of a ghost of Entertainment the dog. The two brothers quarrel and accuse each other of illegally disguising as Entertainment and having tricked the other. Akhil's friends tape this conversation in a CD slyly, however, the CD drops accidentally and Karan and Arjun realize that all this was planned by Akhil. Entertainment runs with the CD. Karan, Arjun and their gang chase the dog, Akhil, and his friends. Akhil manages to beat them all. Later, Karan shoots Akhil, but Entertainment takes the bullet by jumping in front of Akhil. Akhil gets angry and beats up Karan black and blue. Entertainment is taken to the hospital but is unable to come back to life. Akhil, in a fit of anger, punches him but at this process he had saved him. Karan and Arjun come to apologize to Entertainment, who forgives them. Saakshi's father gets Akhil and Saakshi married while Entertainment also marries a female dog in the same ceremony. This film ends when it shows that Akhil Johri and Saakshi Johri live a life with Entertainment and his wife (the female dog) with both of them having Kids and finally at the end it shows the social message Love your pets and they will entertain you all your life.

In February 2013, Taurani confirmed that the film will feature Kumar in the lead role. Bhatia's involvement with the project was confirmed the following month. In April, Taurani confirmed that Sonu Sood and Prakash Raj will be playing the antagonists and that Johnny Lever was also part of the project. Sood had earlier acted alongside Kumar in the comedy drama Singh Is Kinng. The film was tentatively titled Entertainment. In an interview, Sajid-Farhad said that Kumar had motivated them to start their directing career. They said that they had prepared the script for their directorial venture a long time ago. Shooting started on 3 June 2013 in Mumbai where the mahurat shot was filmed. Television actor Hiten Tejwani also did a special appearance as a TV presenter. An audition was conducted in Bangkok for the role of the dog‚ÄìEntertainment. A Golden Retriever named Wonder Dog was chosen from a total of 50 dogs to play the role. In June 2013, the producers, directors and Kumar discussed about shooting locations. Kumar expresses his wish to shoot the film in Bangkok, where he had worked as a waiter and trained in martial arts. The finalised locations included Baanpradhana Bungalow in Ongkuruk, Asiatique Mall, Ancient City, Bangkok University and Ongkuruk Railway Station. The film was scheduled to premiere on 28 March 2014. On 1 July, shooting started in Bangkok for a three months long schedule where 80% of the film was shot, remaining 10% of the film was shot in Mumbai with one song in Goa during late 2013. Shooting was wrapped up in April 2014. A few songs and an item number were shot in Mumbai. The Censor Board of Film Certification in India had objected to Abdullah, the name of Johnny Lever's character in the film. The board's objection was based on the fact that the name of the character is sacred and it was mispronounced by several other characters throughout the film and this would have hurt the religious sentiments of people. The board had asked Sajid Farhad to change the character's name. They complied with the board's instructions and changed the name to Habibullah. The changes were made just a week before the release of the film. The board had also objected to use of the word HIV during a joke in the film and subsequently it was muted. Another of board's objection was the use of trident by Kumar's character in the film. The shot was removed. All the costumes used in the filming were donated to the youth organization in Defense of Animals. It auctioned the clothes and the money collected in this way was used for the benefit of stray animals. Kumar also bought one clothing item. The lead actress Tammanah Bhatia stated that she would donate all the costumes used by her in her future film projects to such initiatives. Earlier titled It's Entertainment, the teaser trailer of the movie unveiled on 14 May whilst the theatrical trailer was released on 19 May. Politician and animal rights activist Maneka Gandhi was the chief guest at the trailer launch ceremony. The producers initially wanted the film to be titled Entertainment but Amole Gupte had already registered for his upcoming film but in July 2014 Gupte donated it to the Sajid-Farhad as a friendly gesture. Kumar decided that the credit for the dog Junior should appear before his. Some fraudsters released a poster of the film and invited people to attend the music launch at Birla Matoshree. Producer Taurani warned people about the fraud posters. The film's satellite right were sold to Zee TV; though the producers did not disclose the amount, media speculated that the deal was worth .  Soundtrack  The soundtrack is composed by Sachin‚ÄìJigar, with their new A&R; platform White Noise Productions, including only the duo at that point, composing the background score. This marked the first time the duo worked with Kumar. The song \\"Teri Mahima Aprampar\\" was taken from the Telugu film D for Dopidi. Kumar also sang one of the tracks of the film. The YouTube link of the making of the song was uploaded on Twitter. The party single \\"Johnny Johnny\\" was released first. Based on a nursery rhyme, the song featured Kumar lip-synching to a female voice. The directors said about the song \\"...in a small subtle way, we are showing our support for women empowerment\\". Sunitra Pacheco of The Indian Express said that it had \\"all the ingredients to become a new party anthem\\". In a review for Rediff.com Joginder Tuteja said that the film's music \\"is entertaining, providing good fun at a frantic pace.\\" He called \\"Veerey Di Wedding\\" \\"an infectious number\\" and praised Mika's voice. About the song \\"Johnny Johnny\\", he said \\"it has addictive beats that get you hooked at the first listening\\" and praised the lyrics and singers. He added that the song \\"will be played for many months, till the next New Year party at least.\\"  Critical reception  Meena Iyer of The Times of India praised the film's humour, Kumar's performance and his chemistry with Junior, especially in comic scenes. She stated that though the dog was not a good actor yet \\"his eyes can melt your heart.\\" She said that the directors could have kept the film \\"tight\\". Mihir Fadnavis of Firstpost called it a \\"sheer genius\\" and said that it was Kumar's funniest film since Hera Pheri. He wrote that the film satirised all of the Sajid-Farhad films and took \\"potshots at everything that is wrong with desi cinema and television.\\" He also appreciated the scene transitions and called it \\"technically great.\\" Hindustan Times Sweta Kaushal criticised the screenplay, Kumar and Prakash Raj's acting. She said that Bhatia \\"[did not] have much to do\\" and Chakraborty did not have much screenspace. However, she praised Abhishek's comedy and said that it was the \\"[only] bright spark in the film.\\" She concluded her review by saying that the film was neither a \\"great piece of art\\" nor entertaining. Prior to the film's release, Hindustan Times published an article titled Four reasons why you shouldn't waste your time on Entertainment and criticed the film's story, songs and dialogues.

Life Little is known about Shufi's before his election as Head of the Organization Bureau of the party's Regional Command in March 1963. He came from al-Suwayda, a Druze city. In al-Suwayda Shufi worked as a school teacher. From the dissolution of the Syrian Regional Branch by Aflaq and al-Bitar in 1958 to its resurrection in 1962, Shufi was able to keep the Suwayda Ba'ath branch alive with vigor. He became known as a somewhat local firebrand. As a thinker he was inspired leftist Ba'athists Ali Salih al-Sadi and Yasin al-Hafiz. At the time of his appointment to the post of Head of the Organization Bureau, Shufi was 36 years of age. He was appointed to head the Organization Bureau because Michel Aflaq and Salah al-Din al-Bitar, the party's leaders, believed him to be one of their loyal followers. On his and Nureddin al-Atassi appointment to the National Council for the Revolutionary Command, Sami al-Jundi wrote derogatorily \\"... and so two reverent disciples join the Council ... ready to please the master [Aflaq] and please his will\\". However, Shufi was devoid of any reverence to the party's leaders and would become the leader of the party's Marxist faction. On the Regional Command, in which he was elected to in March 1963, Shufi and his followers became allied to the Military Committee faction, a faction staunchly opposed to Aflaq's and al-Bitar's leadership. The 1st Regional Congress (held in September 1963) elected Shufi as Regional Secretary of the Syrian Regional Branch and its Regional Command. The Military Committee submitted a report to the 2nd Regional Congress in which it accused Shufi of the electoral irregularities and the factionalism which took place during 1st Regional Congress because of his position as Organization Bureau head. At the 6th National Congress Shufi, alongside al-Sadi from Iraq, dominated procedures. Aflaq was barely able to hold on to his position as Secretary General, while al-Bitar was not reelected to the National Command. When the Iraqi Ba'athists were ousted from power in 1963, the party's Marxist faction were blamed for the disaster. Shufi and his supporters were expelled from the Ba'ath Party by the Extraordinary Regional and National Congresses (held in February 1964). Shufi would not play an important role in national politics again until after the Corrective Movement in which Hafez al-Assad came to power. He served for a short while as Syria's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, resigning from his post on 27 December 1979. Three years later, in New York City, United States in 1982, Shufi announced the establishment of a government-in-exile, called the National Alliance for the Liberation of Syria (NALS). NALS had 20 members, which included the Muslim Brootherhood. The organization opposed what it considered the anti-democratic government in Syria.

In 1824, Bruce fought in the First Anglo-Burmese War, during which he was posted to Sadiya and made commandant of a division of gunboats. In 1835, Bruce was charged by the British East India Company to start tea plantations, and in 1836 resigned his commission with the gunboat flotilla when he was appointed as the superintendent of the Assam tea plantations. At first, the East India Company tried to plant Chinese tea in Assam, but the Chinese plants cross- pollinated with the indigenous tea plants and the experiment was considered a disaster. In Sadiya, Bruce, acting on his own initiative, planted a nursery that consisted just of indigenous plants. In 1836, he sent a sample of the manufactured tea to the tea committee in Delhi.

The proposed height is . It was originally proposed in 2010 and was slated to begin construction in 2015. Planning permission for the tower was granted in late 2015. Construction was scheduled to begin in the third quarter of 2016, assuming a loan of approximately $1.5 billion could be successfully secured. China State Construction Engineering has been appointed to construct the tower. The tower is expected to be completed by 2022. The skyscraper is a part of a 45-hectare redevelopment project (Sudirman Central Business District) SCBD, near the Semanggi Interchange, and is just south of the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium. It is within the Golden Triangle of Jakarta in Jakarta, where the majority of major development areas are located. When completed, the structure will include 6 basement floors used for parking space, while the podium will feature retail, convention and entertainment venues, with the rest of the skyscraper used as office and residential space. Engineering and design Due to the presence of unstable alluvial deposits within the Jakarta Basin and the seismic prone area from where the skyscraper will be built, the design must comply with seismic criteria using a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) defined by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER), Tall Buildings Provisions and the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). In addition, wind tunnel tests must be conducted under city regulations due to the height of the building exceeding 50 stories and . Aerodynamic testing was performed by applying a scaled wind velocity on a 1:500 scale model of the skyscraper equivalent to applying an average hourly wind velocity of 40 m/s on the actual design. On 13 July 2017, acting governor of Jakarta Djarot Syaiful Hidayat attended a regional meeting with the developers, discussing about the UDGL (Urban Design Guide Line) and finally reached an agreement to integrate the tower with the ongoing developments of the Jakarta MRT. Djarot later sent a letter to Indonesian President Joko Widodo, requesting him to make the tower to become a national icon. =Foundation= To accommodate the basement floor levels, had to be excavated and dewatered prior to construction. Drilled shaft bore piles measuring in diameter and in length with a spacing of were suspended within a to thick mat foundation system designed to resist wind and seismic loads. This technique also redistributes axial loads on top of the harder and denser sediment underlying the alluvium. Surrounding the basement wall is a thick slurry wall designed to withstand and retain both groundwater and soil pressures. =Structure= To withstand lateral loads, a \\"core-outrigger-mega-frame\\" system consisting of two major components will be used. The primary system will feature a composite concrete core connected to 8 surrounding super columns all suspended within a network of steel outrigger trusses that spans 2 stories. A mega frame consisting of a network of 9 belt trusses interlocking the super columns together will make up the secondary system that surrounds the primary structure. The super columns will eventually thin and slope towards the apex to match the profile of the architectural tip. The square concrete core that houses the elevator shafts and stairwells will thin to near the top from a ground thickness of to accommodate additional space. The floors residing between the primary and secondary systems will feature a hybrid design consisting of concrete slabs on top of a metal deck to reduce construction time and reduce additional loads.

Background Vines grew up in Wichita, Kansas, having interests in performing arts, speaking and writing. While in high school, he created a popular fan website dedicated to the Harry Potter film series. The website, Veritaserum.com, drew more than 50,000 hits per day, and became a source of employment for him as he maintained the site and sold space within it to advertisers. Growing up, he attended an evangelical Presbyterian church with his family. Upon graduation from high school, he was accepted into Harvard, where he studied for two years during 2008-2010, focusing on philosophy. He then quit Harvard in order to pursue a full-time study of the Bible's statements on homosexuality in response to widespread belief that homosexual expression is disapproved by God - a belief held at the time by his own parents and their family church. He was unable to convince the leadership of his family church of his opinion that they misunderstood what the Bible states about homosexuality, and this led to both himself and other family members leaving that church. LGBT Advocacy In March 2012, Vines delivered a speech in front of a congregation at College Hill United Methodist Church, detailing his belief that \\"the Bible never directly addresses and certainly does not condemn, loving, committed same-sex relationships\\". The presentation was recorded on video and uploaded to YouTube, where it went viral through its sharing on social networks. The clip included a detailed treatment of the Bible verses that are generally translated to refer to homosexuality, and in it Vines says that once original languages and context are taken into consideration, some Bible references are more ambiguous than many people realize. Some scholars pointed out that the material of the video was largely not new, but the format made the formerly 'fringe' material more accessible to the general public. In the first six months since it was uploaded, the video of the speech had been seen more than 980,000 times on YouTube. Writing for the conservative magazine First Things, doctoral student Joshua Gonnerman called Vines' hermeneutical approach deeply flawed. Robert Gagnon said that he and other scholars had previously refuted the arguments that Vines raised. Vines founded The Reformation Project, a non-profit organization for seeking greater inclusion of LGBT lay members and clergy in mainstream Christian churches. Vines is the author of the book God and the Gay Christian (2014 Convergent Books), in which he provided a backdrop to his speech and responds to the main themes of the controversy.

Biography He had an excellent reputation as a physician and obstetrician and as a scholar because he was editor of the first Roman edition of Dante's Divine Comedy. He was among the first in Rome to accept ideas of French Revolution and one of the few who worked for it. He was in contact with de Bassville whose doctor he was. In May 1794, he was arrested on charges of relationships with France and plotting against Pius VI. Released from Castel Sant'Angelo on medical parole, he was in house arrest. Three years later (August 1797), he was arrested again for plotting to murder the Pope then released again as the result of French help following the treaty of Tolentino. He was now regarded as one of the pro-French party leader and he developed relationships with the new French Ambassador Eug√®ne Bonaparte. From September 1797 to March 1798, after a brief stop in Milan where he saw Ugo Foscolo, he met Napoleon Bonaparte first in Rastadt, then in Paris to advocate for the Rome release. Following the fall of Rome when Berthier French troops invaded on 10 February 1798, Angelucci returned to Rome and was called up as a Prefect, and shortly after, Consul of the Roman Republic (20 March 1798). As soon as he came to power, he was far from meeting the patriotic and democratic expectations of his fellows, concerned primarily with his family economical position while avoiding French occupants offence. Following numerous misappropriations, he was forced to resign but remained a prominent politician. In September 1799, at the fall of Roman Republic, he followed the French and took refuge in France, in Marseille and Paris. After Marengo, he went back in Italia but not in Roma. He stopped in Milan where he became Italian Division Surgeon and Major Surgeon of \\"Veliti della Guardia\\". In 1809, when the French army occupied Rome, he went back home but he was kept out into the margins of public life by the Imperial administration. He was a member of the Roman Republic National Institute (Istituto nazionale della Repubblica romana). He died on 1811.

There are differences but many things are similar.Caucasian Review of International Affairs (2006) Thieves of the Law and the Rule of Law in Georgia p.52 History =Soviet period= Georgia is a small Eurasian state with a population of about four million, of whom two thirds are Georgians, and the national minorities are mainly Russian , Armenian, and Azeri . The geographical position of the country is due to the strategically advantageous junction of important communications from Europe to Asia. According to foreign researchers, the Georgian criminal traditions were formed long before the October Revolution . It is thanks to cooperation with the Georgian crime that the young and energetic Joseph Stalin so successfully engaged in robbing banks, extorting money and expropriating property from wealthy citizens. In addition to the profit, the revolutionary criminal environment in Georgia contributed to the intimidation of competitors and the holding of high-profile terrorist acts. The rudiments of this system can be seen a century later, as they still permeate the country. The October Revolution transformed the Georgian underworld just as much as it changed other parts of society. Stalin's ascension to power was accompanied by the corresponding upward movement of representatives of Georgian society. Due to this, the degree of representation of Georgians in the Soviet hierarchy of power was disproportionately high. Interestingly, a similar process was observed in the Soviet criminal underground, where up to a third of strategically important positions were taken by immigrants from Georgia, while the share of the Georgian ethnic group in the general population of the USSR did not exceed 2%. This trend has often attracted the attention of international scientists. They often pointed out that in Soviet times the Georgian SSR had a very high standard of living due to its developed shadow economy , and the Georgian ‚Äú thieves in law ‚Äù held key positions in the criminal communities of the entire Soviet Union . Natives of Georgia were engaged in underground production and unrecorded trade throughout the USSR, often siphoning significant resources from the legal economy. Georgian farmers earned on the supply of scarce fruits to large Soviet cities a lot of money, and their income could be ten times higher than the average Soviet worker‚Äôs earnings. The clan system of the underworld of Soviet Georgia was formed in the 1970s as an association of professional criminals, tsekhoviki and corrupt officials. In those days, when the whole country was huddled in modest small-sized apartments, Georgian officials allowed themselves to build huge apartments for personal use. It is believed that such a lifestyle is associated with an innate culture of ignoring all sorts of rules, which is not so easy to eradicate. As a result, in the 1980s, the allied government had to recognize the existence of organized crime in the country, which served the requests of the ruling elite in exchange for its protection. Obtaining sovereignty in Georgia is often viewed as a departure of the country from the Soviet methods of economic and political administration, but this view does not reflect reality. At that time, no deep reform of the legislation in Georgia and in other post-Soviet countries was carried out and there was not even an intention to modernize the legal system. At the dawn of independence of the country, a number of local wars and military conflicts, the course of which largely depended on which side they took a well-organized Georgian criminal groups. After these events, a number of double flowers strategically important areas blossomed previously unknown to local residents of the phenomenon, such as trafficking in humans, weapons and drugs. The standard of living in the country has declined much more than in other CIS republics, the system of government has practically ceased to function, and many sectors of the economy (especially the energy sector) were rapidly criminalized. Suddenly it turned out that corruption and organized crime pose a threat to the country no less than Chechen terrorists, who feel at ease in the Pankisi Gorge. =Independent Georgia= During the period leading up to Georgian independence in 1991, as tension grew between Georgians and ethnic Abkhaz several nationalist militias were formed, the two most prominent being the National Guard of Georgia led by ex-convict Tengiz Kitovani and the Mkhedrioni led by former thief-in-law Jaba Ioseliani. Due to an absence of any other means of funding, the militias engaged in protection rackets and smuggling and the weak Georgian government had no choice but to embrace them.Zurcher, Christoph; The Post-Soviet Wars: Rebellion, Ethnic Conflict, and Nationhood in the Caucasus; NYU Press, 2007 The paramilitaries were first deployed against the separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, but attempts by President Zviad Gamsakhurdia to rein them in resulted in a violent coup where he was replaced by Eduard Shevardnadze, who had the backing of the militias, which continued to operate with impunity. The Mkhedrioni took advantage of their position of power to take over the gasoline business.RAYMOND BONNER Georgian Fighter Wields Guns, Money and Charm The New York Times. November 16, 1993 Shevardnadze finally got the excuse he needed to disband the militias in 1995 after an assassination attempt. Ioseliani was imprisoned, although released in 2000 as part of a general amnesty, dying three years later. But other, less idealistic thieves-in-law still continued to dominate day-to-day life in Georgia. =Rose Revolution= In November 2003 a popular uprising known as the Rose Revolution toppled the Shevardnadze's government and put Mikheil Saakashvili 's regime in power. Saakashvili soon implemented a series of reforms aimed at tackling crime and corruption, firing and imprisoning a number of officials as well as making membership of the thieves-in-law a crime in 2005. In response to this as well as harsher prison regimes, several prison riots broke out before being heavy-handedly put down. In order to avoid prosecution, Georgian gangsters fled the country, typically to Russia, Israel and Western Europe. =In Russia= Georgian organized crime has been present in Russia since the Soviet era. During the 1990s, as rival criminal gangs, corrupt law enforcement and oligarchs fought one another for supremacy over the lucrative protection rackets of the emerging private business sector in the chaotic transition to capitalism, the Georgian mafia made its presence known in Moscow. One of the most famous bosses of this period was Otari Kvantrishvili, a former sportsman turned racketeer after a conviction for rape. He would often act as a go-between for various underworld factions and something of a public face for the mafia. Prior to his assassination in 1993, Kvantrishvili spoke of his ambitions to start his own political party. His funeral was attended by many celebrities and politicians, including the singer Joseph Kobzon. In more recent years, the Georgian underworld in Russia, Georgia and elsewhere has been characterised by a violent feud between the Kutaisi and Tbilisi clans, led by Tariel Oniani and Aslan Usoyan, respectively. The conflict claimed the life of notorious Russian thief-in-law Vyacheslav Ivankov, who was assassinated while attempting to mediate in 2009, while Usoyan was himself killed by a sniper in January 2013. =In Israel= In popular culture * In the 1988 film Red Heat, Arnold Schwarzenegger portrays a Moscow cop sent to Chicago to bring back a Georgian drug lord. * The video game Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony features fictional crime boss Marki Ashvili. * The video game Deus Ex: Mankind Divided features the fictional Georgian Dvali crime family. * In Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season 1 episode The Hub (1x07), the main antagonist of this episode, Marta (played by Alison Whyte) is a mob boss in the region near the Caucasus Mountains with enough level of influence to help people to cross the South Ossetian borders.

It was completed in the second half of the 17th century. Major repairs were carried out in 1746 but further work proved necessary in 1825. Before the Danish Reformation, the church had a series of chapels and altars, each connected with the craftsmen's guilds in the town. Much of the documentation was destroyed when the L√ºbeckers plundered Nakskov in 1510.Kirsten Weber-Andersen, Otto Norn, Aage Roussell, Gertrud K√∏bke Knudsen, \\"Nakskov Kirke\\", Danmarks kirker: Maribo amt, Volume 8, 1951, Nationalmuseet, pages 89-126. Retrieved 14 July 2013. Architecture Built of light red brick, the original chancel and nave were in the Romanesque style. Parts of these remain in the Gothic additions from the first half of the 15th century. Major extensions were added to both east and west, resulting in aisles on either side of the nave which virtually encapsulated the older construction. A large tower was also built at the west end of the former nave at the beginning of the 15th century. In the mid-17th century, after a period of some 200 years without further construction work, Gothic additions were completed. The Romanesque chancel was demolished while rectangular arches were added in the former walls. The spire which was repeatedly damaged by lightning was finally redesigned by H.C. Glahn in 1906. Interior Pulpit by J√∏rgen Ringnis (1630) The carved altarpiece in the auricular style from 1656 is the work of Anders Mortensen from Odense. The central painting of the Last Supper (which contains an image of Nakskov Church in the background) is topped by depictions of the Crucifixion and Christ's removal from the cross. There are also figures of the Evangelists and the Apostles, Christ Resurrected and also of Moses and Aaron.\\"Altertavle\\", Sankt Nikolai Kirke Nakskov. Retrieved 29 July 2013.

Launched on July 7, 2013 by anonymous hacker and peercoin founder Sunny King, Primecoin was the first cryptocurrency to have a proof-of-work system with a practical use. Earlier cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, were mined using algorithms that solved arbitrary mathematical problems, the results of which had no value or use outside of mining the cryptocurrency itself. Primecoin's algorithm, however, computed chains of prime numbers (Cunningham and bi-twin chains), the results of which were published on its blockchain's public ledger, available for use by scientists, mathematicians, and anyone else. Use of a proof-of-work system to calculate chains of prime numbers was an innovation that produced useful results while also meeting the criteria for a proof-of-work system: it involved a calculation that was difficult to perform but easy to verify, and the difficulty was adjustable. Shortly after its launch, some trade journals reported that the rush of over 18,000 new users seeking to mine Primecoin overwhelmed providers of dedicated servers. Unlike Bitcoin, Primecoin targets a block generation period of one minute rather than every ten minutes, changes difficulty every block rather than every 2016 blocks, and has a dynamic block reward that is a function of the difficulty. Primecoin transactions are confirmed approximately 8‚Äì10 times as fast as Bitcoin transactions.

Today, its international training and consulting activities continue with Public Administration International Ltd.http://www.public-admin.co.uk/ and 'RIPA International Ltd. Founding and early years Founded as the Institute of Public Administration, its mandate was to improve public administration through training, research and the enhancement of professional practice. It was established in 1922 through the Society of Civil Servants with Viscount HaldaneNottage, Raymond & Freida Stack (1972) \\"The Royal Institute of Public Administration, 1922-1939\\" Public Administration, vol. 50, no. 3. as the first President. British statesman Sir William Beveridge envisioned it as a place where: \\"Civil Servants may meet regularly to make a national pool of their ideas, to work out techniques of administration, by discussion and papers and so on; to educate themselves and incidentally the public as to what the Civil Service is and does.\\" Membership was open to individual public servants and regional groups were developed at home and overseas. In 1923, the Institute founded the academic journal Public Administration ‚Äì the first of its kind. Devised to be \\"a medium both for instruction and enlightenment\\", it remains a top-ranked publication in its field.Harzing Journal Quality List by title (50th edition, 5 July 2013) Toward the end of the 1920s, the Institute engaged in discussions with academia to deepen its connection with higher learning, and in 1929 the Diploma of Public Administration was established as a joint venture with the University of London. Establishment of Regional Groups Australian Regional Groups of the Institute were progressively established from 1927. The South Australian Regional Group was formed on 28 October 1927 at The Grosvenor Hotel in Adelaide. A Victorian Regional Group formed in 1929, New South Wales in 1935 and Australian Capital Territory in 1943. A Queensland Regional Group was formed in 1951, closed in 2012, and re-launched in 2017. A Papua and New Guinea Regional Groups was formed in 1952 and closed in 1968. Regional Groups began in Tasmania in 1953 and Western Australia in 1954. The last Regional Group formed in the Northern Territory in 1954 and closed in 1968). A plebiscite of members of the Australian Regional Groups was held in 1977 to get their views on the possibility of revising constitutional arrangements with the Royal Institute of Public Administration. A clear majority of members voted in favour of a proposal to form an autonomous Australian Institute of Public Administration. On 1 January 1980 ties between the former Australian Regional Groups were cut with the Royal Institute of Public Administration and the Australian Institute of Public Administration came into being (a precursor to the current Institute of Public Administration Australia). Acquiring Royal Charter The Institute developed considerably under the directorship of Raymond Nottage from 1949. Trust status was achieved in 1950, and corporate membership was introduced, attracting many local authorities and other organisations, thus increasing the resources available through subscriptions. The Royal Charter was awarded in 1954. Organisation Development In 1953, the Institute began providing short-term management courses for public sector managers and officials. This was done in order to directly integrate the latest best practice and management tools into public administration by filling the gap between on-the-job training and Diplomas of Public Administration.Nottage, Raymond (1972) \\"The Royal Institute of Public Administration, 1939-1972\\" Public Administration, vol. 50, no. 4. An Operational Research Unit for Local Government was established in 1966, based at Reading, followed by a similar service for the National Health Service. Following a 1972 review, UK Training Services and Membership Services were separated from overseas training and development. The Overseas Services Unit (OSU) later known as the International Division, was formed and expanded to undertake major international training and civil service development projects, many under Overseas Development Administration funding. At its peak the Institute employed over 100 staff. International activities International interest in its work had increased continuously since 1961, when RIPA had started its capacity building work with officials from developing countries. By the 1980s, the Institute's international training activities were widely known and appreciated.Shelley, Ivor & Donald McGregor (1994) \\"Correspondence\\" Public Administration, vol. 72, no. 2. Major training and consulting contracts were implemented across Africa and Asia. The reasons for OSU's success were many and included its range of intellectual connections with public administration issues across the globe. For instance in 1963, Deputy Director John Sargent became a member of the Governing Board of the Institute of Administration in Ife, Nigeria. In 1972 Public Administration, RIPA's journal, had more than 10,000 subscribers in over 95 different countries. OSU's consulting staff provided specialist expertise in public sector organisation and methods, human resource development and related fields. In the 1970s the Overseas Development Administration established the academic Journal of Administration Overseas subsequently renamed Public Administration and Development which was taken over by RIPA. The journal, which is now published by Wiley, reports, reviews and assesses the practice of public administration in less industrialised economies and remains highly ranked today. Closure In 1992, against a difficult economic background including public expenditure cuts, RIPA experienced severe financial difficulties, and negotiations were initiated to dispose of the International Division as a viable commercial enterprise. Two new companies were formed by the International Division's staff. Public Administration International Ltd (PAI) which was incorporated on 14 February 1992,http://www.public-admin.co.uk/wp- content/uploads/2014/02/PAIincorporationcertificate.pdf continues to operate as an independent company providing international consulting services and study programmes. The International Division was acquired by Capita Group plc. The Institute itself was wound up.

It is a story of life in a country town in Victoria, Australia in the 1890s. Lindsay portrays real characters struggling with the social restrictions of the day. Snobbery and wowserism are dominant themes. In 1930 it became the first Australian novel to be banned in Australia. The novel was adapted for television in 1972. Plot The central character is Robert Piper, a nineteen-year-old man engaging in love affairs with the publican's daughter and the parson's daughter next door. In an attempt to prevent him falling into immorality and dragging the family along with him, Piper's mother arranges for him to be tutored by Mr Bandparts, a recovering alcoholic school teacher. The arrangement soon backfires and Mr Bandparts is soon drinking beer with his young pupil and chasing the corpulent barmaid at the Royal Hotel. The reader is introduced to the rest of the Piper family: Mr Piper, a draper who continuously measures objects to calm his mind; his eldest son Henry who has high hopes of taking over the business one day; the awful oldest daughter Hetty and her domineering ways in the drawing room, and her attempts to control the family morals and standing; Ethel the quiet younger daughter who uses her shyness to cover her various seductions of young men around town; and Grandpa Piper, who made the family fortunes only to be treated with contempt by the rest of the family in his dotage (his small acts of revenge make some of the most comic moments of the book). Banning The book was banned in Australia for 28 years after it was first published in 1930. Proposed film The novel was optioned for the movies in the 1930s for ¬£1,000 but no movie was made.

Biography Abram Gibs was born in Kherson, the seventh child of a poor Jewish timber factory worker. Expelled from a local gymnasium due to his family's inability to pay for the course, he started to earn his living by giving lessons of grammar and arithmetic. Parents were dreaming of him becoming a doctor, but at the age of 15 Abram Gibs joined first a radical youth circle, then the Kherson Bolshevik party organization. In 1906 he was arrested and deported to the Arkhangelsk area. Having escaped from the settlement, he arrived at Saint Petersburg, then, as part of a Bolshevik envoy group, travelled to Sevastopol and took part in the operation the end result of which was the destroying of documents of the battleship Potyomkin mutineers' trial. Arrested for agitation among Russian Black Sea Fleet sailors, Gibs was sentenced to three years in jail.In the post-Soviet times certain aspects of Adamov's biography, not corroborated by documental evidence, were put to doubt. In 1911, using the pen name Grigory Adamov, Gibs started contributing to the Kherson-based Yug (South) newspaper, of which he soon became the editor. After the 1917 Revolution Adamov joined the Narkomprod (where he became friends with future academician Otto Schmidt), then Goslitizdat publishing house, all the while writing for different journals, including Nashi Dostizhenyia (Our Achievements), edited by Mikhail Koltsov. As a correspondent for Za Industrializatsiyu (For Industrialization) newspaper Adamov travelled all over the country. It was during these voyages that he developed strong interest in science and new technology. =Literary career= In 1930 Adamov became a professional writer. His first short stories, belonging to the so-called genre and dealing with Solar energy and Earth power employment, artificial climate change, etc., were published by Znanie-Sila (Knowledge is Power) magazine. In 1937 Conquerors of the Underground came out. This finely written novel rich with technical trivia and with a spy thriller element to it became popular with the young, technically minded Soviet readership. Even more successful was Adamov's second novel, The Mystery of the Two Oceans (1939), a technothriller telling the story of the Soviet wonder-submarine Pioneer, succeeding in its round-the-world mission despite imperialists' agents' attempts at thwarting it. While working upon it, Adamov became an expert in oceanography, having studied hundreds of scientific books and documents. While writing his third novel, The Ousting of the Ruler, he made a journey to the Russian Far North, so as to investigate his own idea of the possibility of warming the Arctic Circle area up (by artificially heating the Gulf Stream) and thus benefitting the Soviet economy. The novel was published posthumously, in 1946. Grigory Adamov died on 14 June 1945, in Moscow.

Consisting of an arrangement of links and discs‚Äîthree discs rotating in unison, interconnected in series by three or more links between each pair of disks‚Äîa Schmidt coupling can adapt to very wide variations in radial displacement while running under load. Couplings can be made to allow radial displacement greater than twice the radius of the disks.  History  In 1960, NASA commissioned Richard Schmidt of Madison, Alabama, to develop a propulsion system for rockets in zero-gravity environments. One of the solutions suggested was a system of rotating discs with mass points positioned along their circumferences. To power these discs, Schmidt used rotating slider cranks similar to those used to transfer power to the wheels of a steam locomotive. Similar disc-and-link arrangement had been known to German engineers for some time, but engineers could not make the theory work in practice because they erroneously assumed the center disc would require its own bearing. Schmidt found that the center disc could in fact assume its own center of rotation. Schmidt further refined the design, creating a coupling system that guarantees a completely true angle of rotation at all times. Additionally, Schmidt‚Äôs design eliminates the generation of net external forces, as its pushing and pulling forces alternate and overlap in a sinusoidal pattern. In May 1963, Schmidt applied for a patent for his ‚Äúcoupling for precise angular transmission of rotational motion‚Äù at the Munich, Germany, patent office. The company SCHMIDT-KUPPLUNG GmbH was established in 1965 by Richard Schmidt and Walter Haarmann to sell the soon- to-be-patented Schmidt coupling. The patent for the Schmidt coupling, as it came to be known, was granted in February 1967. Schmidt couplings entered the United States coupling market place in 1984 when Zero-Max, Inc. acquired Schmidt Couplings, Inc. SCHMIDT-KUPPLUNG GmbH has entered the Indian market through their channel partner M/s. RSV Industries Private Limited located in Mumbai,India.http://www.schmidt-kupplung.com/en/company/international- partners.html  Operation  In operation, all three discs of a Schmidt coupling rotate with equal velocity. The bearing-mounted connections of links to discs are spaced 120¬∞ apart on same-diameter pitch circles. The distance between the shafts can be varied steplessly between the minimum value and a maximum of twice the length of the links. While the coupling is undulating, there is no phase shift between shafts. The constant-velocity relationship between input and output shafts joined by a Schmidt coupling is unaffected by changes in radial displacement. This relationship is similarly unaffected by initial radial reaction forces which could otherwise imbalance the system. Schmidt couplings maintain constant velocity between the input and output shafts while the shafts undergo radial shifts in their relative positions. If a Schmidt coupling is operating at high speed the shafts must never become close to co-linear, when co-linear the lateral position of the middle disk is no longer fixed and it is free to oscillate around the shafts, causing extreme vibration in some situations.  Schmidt coupling types  Schmidt couplings have been refined to come in several coupling designs, including the following: * Schmidt Offset Couplings: Schmidt couplings which transmit constant angular velocity and torque in a wide range of parallel shaft misalignment. * Semi flex Couplings: Semiflex coupling is a torsionally stiff and restoring-force-free precision coupling. In addition to the compensation of axial and angular displacements, it provides high radial displacement capacity together with compact designhttp://www.schmidt- kupplung.com/en/products/semiflex.html * Schmidt Inline Couplings: Schmidt couplings which accommodate small parallel shaft misalignment at constant angular velocity. * Control flex Couplings:Control flex is a precision coupling designed to meet the mechanical and metrological requirements of encoders. Through its unique function element, the compact shaft encoder coupling combines extremely low restoring force and low stress on the encoder bearings with constant angle-synchronous transmission of the rotary movementhttp://www.schmidt-kupplung.com/en/products/controlflex.html * Schmidt 5-D Couplings: Schmidt couplings which provide parallel shaft misalignment and a ¬±5¬∞ angular misalignment with moderate axial shaft displacement capabilities.

The Tanzania Airports Authority will compensate villagers affected by this project to the tune of TZS 12 billion (US$7 million). As of August 2013, funding has not yet been secured thus delaying the project by 4‚Äì5 years.

The canal itself was opened on 30 July 1939. The exposition was situated on 70 hectares land and 30 hectares water on both riverbanks between the Albert Canal and the Atlas Bridge. On the site were exhibition halls, restaurants, attractions and a Meuse village with replicas of building from the Meuse valley. A part of the site was on land reclaimed from an inavigatable part of the Meuse.L'Illustration, 24 juin 1939, p.301. An aerial cableway provided a panoramic view over the site. The exposition was scheduled to November 1939, but on 31 August explosives under the Val Benoit Bridge and the Ougr√©e Bridge detonated by lightning, resulting in 20 fatalities and 24 injured. The explosives were placed by the Belgian Army wanting the bridges destroyed in case of war. When the real war started the day after it was decided to close the exposition immediately.

He has participated in a number of cases that have received national attention; these include the Terri Schiavo case, a civil suit against Nick Hogan, and the Stephen Coffeen case in which he successfully argued what has been dubbed the \\"Red Bull defense\\". He is senior partner in the Law Firm of Tragos and Sartes, PA.  Notable Cases  *Terri Schiavo: The Terri Schiavo case, 1990 to 2005, revolved around a dispute over prolonged life support. Michael Schiavo, the husband of Teresa Marie \\"Terri\\" Schiavo, wanted to terminate life support for her after doctors diagnosed her as being in a persistent vegetative state. Terri's parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, argued that she was still conscious. On March 29, 2004 the Schindlers were accused of abusing their daughter. George Felos, attorney for Michael Schiavo, alleged that puncture wounds and scratches were found on Terri's arm after a visit by her parents, who were banned from visiting her. George Tragos defended the Schindlers in a hearing to have their visitation rights restored. Police found the charges against the parents to be unsubstantiated. *Nick Hogan: Hogan, the son of semi-retired professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, was the driver in a car accident in which he crashed into a tree as result of drunk driving and racing, on August 26, 2007. John Graziano, a passenger in the car, received serious brain injuries and is expected to require 24-hour-a- day care for the rest of his life. Tragos represented the family of Graziano in a civil lawsuit that resulted in a non-disclosed settlement to be used for providing Graziano with medical care. *Kayode Sotonwa: Sotonwa, a doctor referred to low-income patients by the Pinellas County Health and Human Services Department, was accused of sexually assaulting one patient, improperly touching the breast of a second and striking a third too hard on the knee with a reflex mallet. George Tragos defended Sotonwa, who was acquitted of all charges. *Stephen Coffeen (The \\"Red Bull Defense\\"): In 2009, Stephen Coffeen smothered his 83-year-old father with a pillow. Five psychiatrists testified that Stephen Coffeen had become temporarily psychotic after not sleeping and drinking the caffeinated energy drink Red Bull. Coffeen was acquitted by reason of insanity in July 2011. *Arunya Rouch: Arunya Rouch was an employee at a Publix supermarket. On March 30, 2010, Rouch was fired for threatening her co-worker, Greg Janowski. She returned hours later, killed Janowski, and went inside to kill her managers. She was stopped in a police shoot-out. George Tragos represented her in a plea of insanity, stating that she \\"wanted to die. She wanted to commit suicide by cop\\". Rouch was found guilty of premeditated murder and given life imprisonment.

It was built for Sir Lionel Phillips, one of the influential Randlords that dominated the early history of the city. Today it is one of the Parktown mansions that are preserved as part of the city's heritage. History In 1896 Sir Lionel Phillips was banished from South Africa after the Jameson Raid. He narrowly escaped the death sentence and was fined ¬£25,000 and exiled.Maryna Fraser, ‚ÄòPhillips, Sir Lionel, first baronet (1855‚Äì1936)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006 accessed 29 July 2013 He and his wife returned and took up residence in this house known as Villa Arcadia. The first building here was a Swiss Chalet that had been imported as a prefabricated house in 1897 for Carl Rolfe, a German businessman. In 1909 Herbert Baker and Francis Edward Masey were employed to design a new house at 22 Oxford Road. This was one of the last houses designed by the partnership as it was dissolved the following year with Masey leaving for Rhodesia to escape Baker's dominance. Blue plaque today The current Villa Arcadia was completed with considerable input and design changes from Florence Philips. A music room was added to the house by Baker, separated from the house by a landscaped cloistered courtyard. The house features a long veranda on the ground floor fronted by eleven arches with extensive views of the M1 motorway and overlooking what was once the Sachsenwald. Today the view is the Saxonwold and Forest Town suburbs and the Johannesburg Zoo. The property was sold and a Jewish orphanage was established in the house in 1923. General Jan Smuts opened the Orphanage which ran in the Villa until 2002 with its highest number of orphans in 1939 at over 400. Today The House itself now houses a modern art collection, a number of boardrooms and entertainment facilities.

Family life Francis Stewart Montague-Bates was born on 8 February 1876, the only son of Henry Montague Bates and Mary Montague-Bates, her second husband, whom she married in 1872, following the death of her first husband from Cholera, Colonel Andrew Gammell of the 12th Lancers, in 1869. The family lived in London and also had property in Manaccan, Cornwall. Captain Montague Bates was married in Canada in 1910 to Gladys Thomas of Plymouth. They had one son, Patrick Montague Bates born in 1914, who, after education at Wellington College on a scholarship, joined Imperial Airways. He was a member of the RAFVR, called up in late 1939, trained as a pilot officer in 1940 and was shot down by a Messerschmidt 109 and killed in action in early 1941 piloting a Blenheim IV, whilst returning from a mission bombing a viaduct during the invasion of Crete by German Forces Who was Who. Francis Stewart Montague Bates was educated at Appuldurcombe College on the Isle of Wight.Obituary, The Times (London), 24 June 1954. Military career =Second Boer War= When the Second Boer War broke out in October 1899, Montague-Bates was in Rangoon, Burma. He volunteered for service in South Africa, and was accepted on 12 February 1900 and served for a few months (135 days) as a corporal in B SectionThe History of Lumsdens Horse in Lumsden's Horse, a mounted infantry unit raised by Colonel Lumsden and supported by Sir Giles Playfair. The Unit was mainly composed of volunteers from regiments of the Indian Volunteer Force. On 4 August 1900 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion East Surrey Regiment, which was serving elsewhere in the South African theatre, and for a while he commanded a section of a composite mounted infantry company formed from 2nd East Surreys and 1st Battalion Durham Light Infantry.Quarterly Army List.Amery, Appendix to Chapters I-XIV, pp. 503‚Äì14. He was promoted to lieutenant on 21 May 1902, shortly before the end of the war. After the Boer War, Montague-Bates was seconded for four years to the South African Constabulary organised by Major-General Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scout Movement. (In 1913 Montague-Bates published a book on infantry scouting.) He was promoted to Captain in 1909 and again seconded, from 1910 to 1912, to the Canadian Forces. When World War I broke out in August 1914, Montague-Bates was serving as Adjutant of the 6th Battalion East Surreys, a Territorial Force unit based at Kingston upon Thames. =Western Front= In November 1914 he was sent to the Western Front with a draft of reinforcements to join the 2nd Bn Queen's (Royal West Surrey) Regiment, which had suffered badly in the 1st Battle of Ypres. As the senior officer present he took command of the battalion, becoming a Temporary Major in December.Atkinson, p. 508. Holding the line in the Ypres Salient, 2nd Queens' were actively engaged in trench raids during this period. A major attack was ordered for the afternoon of 18 December, when the 7th Division attacked Well Farm near La Boutillerie. The attack was led by 2nd Bn Royal Warwickshire Regiment, with two companies of 2nd Queen's in support. The preliminary bombardment had done little damage to the German defences, and the Warwicks were halted in the wire just short of the enemy trench. Going forward, the Queen's could do no more than reach the wire and reinforce the Warwicks in the dusk. Realising that the attack had failed, Montague-Bates decided not to renew it, but issued orders for the survivors to get back as best they could. Casualties were heavy in the barely reformed battalions, but senior commanders testified to the gallantry and devotion they had shown in attempting an impossible task.Atkinson, pp. 120‚Äì3. When a more senior officer of the Queen's arrived at the end of the year, Montague-Bates reverted to his previous rank of captain and became adjutant of the battalion until after the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March 1915, when he was posted to fill the same appointment with the Warwicks. In the summer of 1915 he returned to 1st Battalion of his own regiment, which was serving in 5th Division, succeeding to command of the battalion (with promotion to major and temporary lieutenant-colonel) in August, when the commanding officer was invalided home. =Salonika= At the end of 1915, Montague-Bates was sent to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force and then to the Salonika Front, where in January 1916 he took command of 12th Bn Cheshire Regiment, a 'Kitchener Army' battalion serving in 66th Brigade of 22nd Division.Becke, Part 3a, pp. 111‚Äì7. At first the British Salonika Army was restricted to digging into its bridgehead around the port (nicknamed 'The Birdcage'), but in April, 66th Bde led the way inland towards the Bulgarian frontier.Wakefield & Moody, pp. 41, 48. On 27 August 1916 Montague-Bates was promoted to Temporary Brigadier-General to take temporary command of 77th Brigade in the neighbouring 26th Division,Becke, Part 3a, pp. 143‚Äì9. then moved on 25 September to 83rd Brigade in 28th Division.Becke, Part 1, pp. 105‚Äì16. Finally, on 15 November 1916, he returned to 22nd Division to assume command of 66th Brigade, which position he held until the demobilisation of the division in Turkey in March 1919. He was in charge of the brigade during the heavy fighting of the Battles of Doiran of 1917 and 1918.Wakefield & Moody, pp. 80, 203‚Äì11. In September 1919 he once more took over 83rd Brigade in 28th Division, which was then forming part of the British Army of Occupation in Turkey. =Turkey= Following the Occupation of Constantinople, 83rd Bde was garrisoning the Dardanelles forts, but in November 1919 it was moved to the Izmit area to guard the Anatolian Railway. In March 1920 it moved back to Constantinople, but a new independent brigade (242nd Brigade) was formed at Izmit under Montague-Bates. This consisted of British and Indian infantry battalions, with supporting troops.General Sir George Milne's Despatch 11 August 1920, London Gazette, 7 January 1921. During August Montague-Bates authorised a sortie over the River Sarkaria to protect his perimeter against attacks by Nationalist Turks. He was reprimanded by Major- General Edmund Ironside who had just taken over command of the Izmit area. One of Montague-Bates' staff reported that the two generals 'had heated words' and 'When Brigadier Bates came out of the meeting he was white with rage, said good-bye, and having collected his belongings left with hardly a word'. Montague-Bates returned to Constantinople and was sent home. The staff officer wrongly believed that Montague-Bates had resigned his commission, and wrote that 'Monty' was 'a great loss to the army, for though not liked by many, was a first-class soldier'. =Ireland= On return to the United Kingdom Montague-Bates had to relinquish his temporary rank of Brigadier-General and reverted to the Brevet lieutenant-colonelcy he had been awarded in June 1916.London Gazette 29 October 1920. He rejoined the 2nd Bn East Surreys and in June 1921 he became Officer Commanding Troops at Dublin Castle during the peak of the violence during the Anglo-Irish War. =Regimental service= In August 1922 Montague-Bates returned from Northern Ireland to the 1st Bn East Surreys stationed in Egypt. He commanded the battalion from December 1923 to December 1927, in Hong Kong and India. During this period, Montague-Bates was promoted to Brevet-Colonel, and in March 1928 after his term of regimental command expired, he was appointed Brigade Commander of 141st (5th London) Brigade of the Territorial Army, based at the Duke of York's Headquarters in Chelsea. He retired from the army in 1932, but served again in Cornwall, commanding the Home Guard unit for the Helford Estuary with its headquarters in Gweek. Home Guard during the World War II invasion scare of 1940‚Äì41. Frank Montague-Bates died on 21 June 1954 at his home at Manaccan. His funeral was held on 30 June at Kensal Green Cemetery.The Times (London), 1 July 1954.

Racing History =Australian GT= The No.8 Ferrari 458 Italia GT3 Maranello Motorsport has supported various customers in the Australian GT Championship. In 2007 the team upgraded to the latest F430GT3 and despite it not arriving until mid-season, went on to a string of podium finishes and fastest laps before winning the 2007 Australian GT Championship and the 2007 Sandown GT Classic with Allan Simonsen and Tim Leahey driving. This was repeated in 2008 when Allan Simonsen and Nick O'Halloran won the GT Classic again. After campaigning a number of 430GT3's through 2009/10, 2011 saw the arrival of the new F458GT3 late in the year but just in time for the 2011 Bathurst Sprint. Its debut at this event sent shock waves through Australian motorsport when a new lap record of 2.04.95 was set by SImonsen early on the last morning of the event. This was nearly two whole seconds faster than Greg Murphy's \\"Lap of the Gods\\" from 2006 and sent the time keepers into such disbelief that they initially deleted the lap, believing it was a timing error. The time was later reinstated after the teams data showed the same time. One of their long-term drivers, Peter Edwards, went through the Maranello driver training system and started racing a Ferrari 360 Challenge, before graduating to a 430 GT3. Cameron McConville and Nick O‚ÄôHalloran competed in Maranello‚Äôs black Ferrari, supported by Apex Tubulars, while the team‚Äôs second red car was driven by two-time Bathurst 1000 winner John Bowe and Edwards in 2012.http://www.speedcafe.com/2012/05/01/mcconville-scores- ferrari-drive-with-maranello-motorsport/ =Bathurst 12 Hour= Maranello Motorsport won the 2014 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour at the Mount Panorama Circuit on 9 February. Bowe and Edwards were joined in the team's winning Ferrari 458 GT3 by V8 Supercars driver Craig Lowndes and former Formula One driver Mika Salo. In a Ferrari 488 GT3, the team repeated their triumph in 2017, with Lowndes being joined by Toni Vilander and Jamie Whincup.

He is associated with Israel's New Historians, a group challenging many of the country's traditional narratives. Biography Segev was born in Jerusalem. His parents, Ricarda (n√©e Meltzer) and Heinz Schwerin were artists who had met at the Bauhaus art school and fled Nazi Germany in 1935 due to their Communist orientation (Heinz was also Jewish). His mother was a photographer; his father, an architect and toy manufacturer, was killed on guard duty in Jerusalem in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. Segev's first language was German; his mother never learned Hebrew beyond a basic level. He earned a BA in history and political science from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a PhD in history from Boston University in the 1970s.Conversation with Tom Segev, p. 1 of 7 His sister is the German politician Jutta Oesterle-Schwerin. Journalism career Segev worked during the 1970s as a correspondent for Maariv in Bonn.I didn't have the guts, Haaretz, April 28, 2009 He was a visiting professor at Rutgers University (2001‚Äì2002),Salon.com Books  Beyond tribalism the University of California at Berkeley (2007)Conversation with Tom Segev (2007), cover page and Northeastern University, where he taught a course on Holocaust denial. He writes a weekly column for the newspaper Haaretz. His books have appeared in fourteen languages. In The Seventh Million: The Israelis and the Holocaust (1993), Segev explores the decisive impact of the Holocaust on the identity, ideology and politics of Israel. Although controversial, it was praised by Elie Wiesel in the Los Angeles Times Book Review. In One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs Under the British Mandate, a New York Times Editor's Choice Best Book (2000) and a recipient of a National Jewish Book Award in the Israel category, Segev describes the era of the British Mandate in Palestine (1917‚Äì1948). Segev's history of the social and political background of the Six-Day War, 1967: Israel, the War, and the Year That Transformed the Middle East (2006) states that there was no existential threat to Israel from a military point of view. Segev also doubts that the Arab neighbours would have really attacked Israel. Still, large segments of the Israeli population had a real fear that the Egyptians and Syrians would eliminate them. That would have increased the pressure for the Israeli government in such a way that it opted for a pre-emptive attack. The attack by the Jordanian army to West Jerusalem would have provided a welcoming reason to invade East Jerusalem, according to Segev. Even though the occupation of East Jerusalem was not politically planned, the author considers that it was always desired. In February 2018, Segev published a biography of David Ben-Gurion.

Brunei has an embassy in Makati, Metro Manila while the Philippines has an embassy in Bandar Seri Begawan. History Bruneians in the Philippines, c. 1590 via Boxer Codex Prior to Spanish and British colonization, the Sultanate of Brunei and the Kingdom of Maynila and Sultanate of Sulu as well as other sultanates in the Philippines have extensive trading and political relations. The Sultanate of Sulu was once a satellite state of Brunei, later becoming independent after the Sultan of Sulu helped the Sultan of Brunei destroy a growing civil war movement and a rebellion in Brunei. Half of Sabah was given as a gift to Sulu by Brunei after the aid given to them. The island group of Palawan was also formerly part of the Empire of Brunei, but was also given to Sulu by Brunei. Muslim populations in southern Palawan are the descendants of the people of the Sultanate of Sulu who once controlled the island group. Brunei once subjugated the Kingdom of Maynila, turning it into the first and only Islamic state in the history of Luzon island. Later, the Spanish Empire subjugated the Philippines, and Brunei's influence to Manila disintegrated. Sulu, being waned by Spain, continued to have good relations with Brunei, until British troops subjugated Brunei and turned it into a colony.The Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mosque in the Philippines was funded by Brunei. Upon Brunei's independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984, the Philippines established full diplomatic relations with Brunei. The Philippines' Consulate-General in Bandar Seri Begawan, set up on 10 August 1983 to accommodate the needs of Overseas Filipino Workers in the sultanate, was upgraded into embassy status. Likewise, Brunei's Consulate-General in Makati, founded in November 1983, was also upgraded to embassy status. Brunei has supported various developments in the Philippines, including the building of the biggest mosque in the country located in Cotabato City. State visits Philippine President Benigno Aquino III, made a state visit to Brunei on 1‚Äì2 June 2011 and visited the country again on 23 September 2012 to attend the royal wedding of Princess Hajah Hafizah Sururul Bolkiah. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei made a state visit on 15‚Äì16 April 2013 to the Philippines to discuss Brunei's chairmanship in the ASEAN summit. The sultan thanked President Aquino for the Philippines' support for his country's ASEAN chairmanship. The South China Sea dispute was also on agenda. The Philippines urged Brunei as chair, to prioritise on the conclusion of a code of conduct regarding the issue. Brunei expressed support for the creation of a binding conduct among claimants in the regional dispute and has vowed to pursue the said conduct. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte had his first ever state visit in Brunei before going to the ASEAN General Assembly in Laos on September 2016. The visit shall symbolize the strong ties between the two allied nations. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei returned to the Philippines on 26‚Äì29 April 2017 for a state visit and to attend the 30th ASEAN Summit, which the Philippines chaired.

It has generated a heated controversy.http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/1/75.full The book was in the best-seller list in Israel for nineteen weeks. An English translation of the book was published by Verso Books in October 2009.The Invention of the Jewish People , English Edition (Verso Books, 2009) The book has also been translated into German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, French and Russian, and as of late 2009 further translations were underway. The Invention of the Jewish People has now been translated into more languages than any other Israeli history book.  Book summary  Sand began his work by looking for research studies about forcible exile of Jews from the area now bordered by modern Israel, and its surrounding regions. He was astonished that he could find no such literature, he says, given that the expulsion of Jews from the region is viewed as a constitutive event in Jewish history. The conclusion he came to from his subsequent investigation is that the expulsion simply did not happen, that no one exiled the Jewish people from the region, and that the Jewish diaspora is essentially a modern invention. He accounts for the appearance of millions of Jews around the Mediterranean and elsewhere as something that came about primarily through the religious conversion of local people, saying that Judaism, contrary to popular opinion, was very much a \\"converting religion\\" in former times. He holds that mass conversions were first brought about by the Hasmoneans under the influence of Hellenism, and continued until Christianity rose to dominance in the fourth century CE. =Jewish origins= Sand argues that it is likely that the ancestry of most contemporary Jews stems mainly from outside the Land of Israel and that a \\"nation-race\\" of Jews with a common origin never existed, and that just as most Christians and Muslims are the progeny of converted people, not of the first Christians and Muslims, Jews are also descended from converts. According to Sand, Judaism was originally, like its two cousins, a proselytising religion, and mass conversions to Judaism occurred among the Khazars in the Caucasus, Berber tribes in North Africa, and in the Himyarite Kingdom of the Arabian Peninsula. According to Sand, the original Jews living in Israel, contrary to popular belief, were not exiled by the Romans following the Bar Kokhba revolt. The Romans permitted most Jews to remain in the country. Rather, the story of the exile was a myth promoted by early Christians to recruit Jews to the new faith. They portrayed that event as a divine punishment imposed on the Jews for having rejected the Christian gospel. Sand writes that \\"Christians wanted later generations of Jews to believe that their ancestors had been exiled as a punishment from God.\\" Following the Arab conquest of Palestine in the 7th century, many local Jews converted to Islam and were assimilated among the Arab conquerors. Sand concludes that these converts are the ancestors of the contemporary Palestinians. =Jewish peoplehood= Sand's explanation of the birth of the \\"myth\\" of a Jewish people as a group with a common, ethnic origin has been summarized as follows: \\"[a]t a certain stage in the 19th century intellectuals of Jewish origin in Germany, influenced by the folk character of German nationalism, took upon themselves the task of inventing a people \\"retrospectively,\\" out of a thirst to create a modern Jewish people. From historian Heinrich Graetz on, Jewish historians began to draw the history of Judaism as the history of a nation that had been a kingdom, became a wandering people and ultimately turned around and went back to its birthplace.\\" In this, Sand writes, they were similar to other nationalist movements in Europe at the time that sought the reassurance of a Golden Age in their past to prove they have existed as a separate people since the beginnings of history. Jewish people found theirs in what he calls \\"the mythical Kingdom of David\\". Before this invention, he says, Jews thought of themselves as Jews because they shared a common religion, not a common ethnic background. =Return from exile, Zionism= Sand believes that the idea of Jews being obliged to return from exile to the Promised Land was alien to Judaism before the birth of Zionism, and that the holy places were seen as places to long for, not to be lived in. On the contrary, for 2,000 years Jews stayed away from Jerusalem because their religion forbade them from returning until the Messiah came. According to Sand, the ancestry of Central and Eastern European Jews stems heavily from medi√¶val Turkic Khazars who were converted to Judaism, a theory which was popularized in a book written by Arthur Koestler in 1976. =Overall intent of the book= Sand explained during a newspaper interview his reasons for writing the book: \\"I wrote the book for a double purpose. First, as an Israeli, to democratise the state; to make it a real republic. Second, I wrote the book against Jewish essentialism.\\"Shlomo Sand: an enemy of the Jewish people? \\" Retrieved 2011-01-18. Sand explained in the same interview that what he means by 'Jewish essentialism' is, in the words of the interviewer, \\"the tendency in modern Judaism to make shared ethnicity the basis for faith.\\" \\"That is dangerous and it nourishes antisemitism. I am trying to normalise the Jewish presence in history and contemporary life,\\" Sand said. Reception Sand's book has provoked a range of responses from different points of view. =As a work of history= Writing in The Financial Times, British historian Tony Judt commented, \\"Shlomo Sand has written a remarkable book. In cool, scholarly prose he has, quite simply, normalized Jewish history.\\" He states that he is untroubled by the book's historical perspective, and that \\"Sand ‚Äì for example in his emphasis upon the conversions and ethnic mixing that characterise the Jews in earlier times ‚Äì is telling us nothing we do not already know.\\" Israel must unpick its ethnic myth Tony Judt, The Financial Times, December 7, 2009 British historian Eric Hobsbawm selected Sand's book as one of his \\"Books of the Year\\" for 2009: \\"Shlomo Sand's The Invention of the Jewish People (Verso) is both a welcome and, in the case of Israel, much needed exercise in the dismantling of nationalist historical myth and a plea for an Israel that belongs equally to all its inhabitants.\\" In contrast, a commentary published in Haaretz, Israel Bartal, dean of the humanities faculty of the Hebrew University, writes that Sand's claims about Zionist and contemporary Israeli historiography are baseless, calling the work \\"bizarre and incoherent,\\" and that Sand's \\"‚Ä¶treatment of Jewish sources is embarrassing and humiliating.\\" According to Bartal, \\"No historian of the Jewish national movement has ever really believed that the origins of the Jews are ethnically and biologically 'pure'.\\" Bartal writes that Sand applies academically marginal positions to the entire body of Jewish historiography and, in doing so, \\"denies the existence of the central positions in Jewish historical scholarship.\\" Sand, for example, does not mention the fact that, from 2000 onwards, a team of scholars from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem labored on the production of a three-volume study on the history of the Jews of Russia. He adds that \\"the kind of political intervention Sand is talking about, namely, a deliberate program designed to make Israelis forget the true biological origins of the Jews of Poland and Russia or a directive for the promotion of the story of the Jews' exile from their homeland is pure fantasy.\\" In a review, Washington Post journalist David Finkel writes that the book's chapter on 'Mythistory' is \\"where Sand fully hits his stride. It is not so much Jewish history but rather historiography that's decisive ...\\" Finkel writes that Bartal \\"disputes little of Sands‚Äô history but focuses on his historiography,\\" and suggests, \\"doesn‚Äôt all this precisely prove Sand‚Äôs point? The professional intellectuals ... have no need for crude myths. Yet this does not prevent every Israeli government, right, center or 'left', through which many of these same intellectuals may rotate as ministers, advisors or spokespersons, from justifying land grabs, settlements and demolition of Palestinian homes all over 'Greater Jerusalem' under the banner of 'the eternal capital of the Jewish people.'\\"Myths of the Exile and Return: The History of History, David Finkel, May‚ÄìJune 2010. Another critic of the book has called it, in part, a recycled version of The Thirteenth Tribe, another book with a controversial thesis on the genesis of the Jewish people published in 1976 by Arthur Koestler. \\"'The Thirteenth Tribe' was received coolly by critics, and Mr. Sand's repackaging of its central argument has not fared much better,\\" commented Evan R. Goldstein. There is not enough known about the 13th century demography of Eastern European Jews to credibly make as bold a claim as Sand's. Historian Anita Shapira criticizes Sand for regularly \\"grab(bing) at the most unorthodox theory\\" in a field and then stretching it \\"to the outer limits of logic and beyond\\" during Sand's survey of three thousand years of history. Shapira says that the Sand's political program makes the book an attempt to \\"drag history into a topical argument, and with the help of misrepresentations and half-truths to adapt it to the needs of a political discussion.\\" Carlo Strenger writes that Sand's book is \\"not a pure work of history\\" and argues that, \\"in fact, it has a clearly stated political agenda. ... It might come as a surprise to some who have not read the book that Sand's goal is to preserve Israel as a democracy with a Jewish character based on a Jewish majority.\\" According to historian Shaul Stampfer, \\"even though it's a wonderful story\\", the mass conversion of Khazars to Judaism never took place. According to Daniel Lazare the Invention of Jewish people is \\"messy polemic ‚Äì helter-skelter, tendentious and ill-informed\\". According to Lazare, Sand \\"rightly insists on the relevance of the ancient past to contemporary politics, but his distortions are an obstacle to a full understanding of the modern Israeli-Palestinian predicament.\\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n12/daniel- lazare/a-diverse-collection-of-peoples Professor Michael Berkowitz from University College London wrote \\"With a little critical distance, it is possible to criticize this book as a far cry from a ‚Äòreal‚Äô work of scholarship. It is flimsy, haphazardly built, slap-dash. There is no foundation in archival research, and Sand does not seem to have fully read (or understood) many of the secondary works on which his thesis relies. He apparently has never heard of Aviel Roshwald and George Mosse, who are among the first names that should spring to mind in any consideration of Jews and nationalism... Perhaps the fundamental problem with this book, which also applies to the above-mentioned works of Goldhagen, Piterberg, and Mayer, is that the thesis runs way ahead of the supposedly dispassionate investigation (despite Sand's protest to the contrary), and therefore the book assumes the character more of a legal brief than a scholarly monograph\\". Berkowitz criticized it as \\"a far cry from a ‚Äòreal‚Äô work of scholarship\\" and \\"plodding and dull.\\" =As an argument about Jewish identity= Writing in The New Republic, Hillel Halkin calls assertions made in the book \\"the exact opposite of the truth\\" and goes on to say that \\"Believing Jews throughout the ages have never doubted for a moment that they belonged to an am yisra'el, a people of Israel‚Äînor, in modern times, have non-believing Jews with strong Jewish identities. It is precisely this that constitutes such an identity. Far from inventing Jewish peoplehood, Zionism was a modern re-conceptualization of it that was based on its long-standing prior existence.\\"Indecent Proposal, Hillel Halkin, Jan. 9, 2010, The New Republic, [The Invention of the Jewish People. Halkin describes the book as \\"so intellectually shoddy that once, not very long ago, it would have been flunked as an undergraduate thesis by any self- respecting professor of history.\\" In contrast, Israeli historian Tom Segev writes that Sand's book \\"is intended to promote the idea that Israel should be a 'state of all its citizens' ‚Äì Jews, Arabs and others ‚Äì in contrast to its declared identity as a 'Jewish and democratic' state.\\" Segev adds that the book includes \\"numerous facts and insights that many Israelis will be astonished to read for the first time\\". British historian Simon Schama, reviewing the book in the Financial Times, argues that Sand misunderstands Jews in the diaspora, specifically, that he thinks that \\"the Khazars, the central Asian kingdom which, around the 10th century, converted to Judaism have been excised from the master narrative because of the embarrassing implication that present day Jews might be descended from Turkic converts.\\" Schama states that, on the contrary, when he was a child, \\"the Khazars were known by every Jewish girl and boy in my neck of Golders Greenery and further flung parts of the diaspora, and celebrated rather than evaded.\\" Schama adds that \\"Sand's sense of grievance against the myths on which the exclusively Jewish right to full Israeli immigration is grounded is one that many who want to see a more liberal and secular Israel wholeheartedly share. But his book prosecutes these aims through a sensationalist assertion that somehow, the truth about Jewish culture and history, especially the 'exile which never happened,' has been suppressed in the interests of racially pure demands of Zionist orthodoxy. This, to put it mildly, is a stretch.\\" Sand responded to Schama's critique on his website by summarising the methodology Schama had used: \\"One of the most effective techniques adopted to ridicule or marginalize one‚Äôs ideological opponents is to create a caricatured and extreme version of their thesis. Some Zionist historians have become past masters with such methods and Simon Schama seems to want to emulate them in his review of my book.\\" British historian Max Hastings, in his review for the Sunday Times, writes that the book \\"represents, at the very least, a formidable polemic against claims that Israel has a moral right to define itself as an explicitly and exclusively Jewish society, in which non-Jews, such as Palestino-Israelis, are culturally and politically marginalised.\\" He adds that Sand \\"rightly deplores the eagerness of fanatics to insist upon the historical truth of events convenient to modern politics, in defiance of evidence or probability... Yet Sand, whose title is foolishly provocative, displays a lack of compassion for the Jewish predicament.\\" Hastings continues, stating that \\"It is possible to accept his view that there is no common genetic link either between the world's Jews or to the ancient tribes of Israel, while also trusting the evidence of one's own senses that there are remarkable common Jewish characteristics ‚Äî indeed, a Jewish genius ‚Äî that cannot be explained merely by religion.\\" Hastings states that \\"Sand produces some formidable arguments about what Jews may not be, but he fails to explain what it is they are.\\" Hastings concludes that Sand's book \\"serves notice on Zionist traditionalists: if an Israeli historian can display such plausible doubts about important aspects of the Israeli legend, any Arabs hostile to the state of Israel can exploit a fertile field indeed.\\" Steven Weitzman, himself the author of a recent analysis of the topic which dismisses many of the key traditional accounts of Jewish origins, critiques Sand's idea of a deliberate 'invention' of Jewish identity, while arguing that Sand's method has similarities to mainstream scholarship. For Weitzman, Sand has just replaced one origin theory with another, whereas, for Weitzman, the question of Jewish origins is to an extent indeterminate (‚Äòunresolvable‚Äô).Steven Weitzman The Origin of the Jews: The Quest for Roots in a Rootless Age., Princeton University Press, 2017 pp.206-207,320 In a follow-up exchange with Shmuel Rosner he adds that his criticism of Sand applies equally to versions of the origin stories produced by the right. Making a comparison already voiced elsewhere,'Un livre vide sur \\"l'histoire du peuple palestinien\\", meilleure vente sur Amazon,' i24news 24 June 2017 he compares Sand's book to Assaf Voll's A History of the Palestinian People, 122 blank pages, stating Sand's argument is the reverse of Voll's, with the former attempting to disprove Jewish origins, and the latter, doing the same for Palestinians, each undermining an adversary's national claim.Shmuel Roser, Steven Weitzman, 'The Origins of the Jews exchange, part 2: On the gaps between the Jewish public and the scholars,', The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, 5 July 2017 =As an argument about the position of \\"Jewish history\\" in Israeli universities= According to Ilani, most of Sand's book deals with the question of where the Jews come from, rather than questions of modern Jewish nationalism and the modern invention ‚Äî according to Sand ‚Äî of the Jewish people.\\" Therefore, some historians of Judaism have stated that Sand is dealing with subjects about which he has no understanding, and that he bases his book on work that he is incapable of reading in the original languages. Sand admits that he is \\"a historian of France and Europe, and not of the ancient period‚Ä¶\\" and that he has \\"been criticized in Israel for writing about Jewish history when European history is my specialty. But a book like this needed a historian who is familiar with the standard concepts of historical inquiry used by academia in the rest of the world.\\" This cannot be found in university history departments in Israel, because of their isolated nature. This isolation, Sand states, dates to a decision in the 1930s to separate history into two disciplines: general history and Jewish history. Jewish history was assumed to need its own field of study because Jewish experience was considered unique. \\"There is no Jewish department of politics or sociology at the universities. Only history is taught this way, and it has allowed specialists in Jewish history to live in a very insular and conservative world where they are not touched by modern developments in historical research.\\" =Genetic evidence= Sand's book has occasionally been mentioned in the press in the context of studies in Jewish population genetics. This has been the case in June 2010, as the popular press reported on two studies in this field, (Atzmon et al., American Journal of Human Genetics and Beha et al., Nature). Thus, Newsweek mentions Sand's book as having \\"revived\\" debate on the Khazar hypothesis. and the New York Times said the studies \\"refute the suggestion made last year by the historian Shlomo Sand in his book The Invention of the Jewish People that Jews have no common origin but are a miscellany of people in Europe and Central Asia who converted to Judaism at various times.\\" Michael Balter, reviewing the study in the journal Science, says the following: Geneticist Harry Ostrer presented findings that were generally viewed as disproving Sand's notion that the Jewish people is an ex- post invention. Ostrer said, \\"I would hope that these observations would put the idea that Jewishness is just a cultural construct to rest.\\" Balter's article further cites Noah Rosenberg of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, as saying that although the study \\"does not appear to support\\" the Khazar hypothesis, it \\"doesn't entirely eliminate it either.\\" Shlomo Sand has contested the claim that his book has been contradicted by recent genetic research published in Nature journal and the American Journal of Human Genetics. In a new afterword for the paperback edition of The Invention of the Jewish People, Sand writes: Another study on European Jewish population genetics was published in 2012 (Elhaik et al.). According to his study's conclusions, European Jews derive from Caucasus and Mesopotamian populations, findings which have been disputed by Ostrer and others. On the publication of Elhaik's study, Haaretz reported comments by Sand, who took Elhaik's paper as a vindication of his ideas and seized the opportunity to criticize again \\"geneticists looking for Jewish genes\\", expressing the suspicion that the findings of prior geneticists may have been \\"adapted\\" for political reasons.\\"Some people, historians and even scientists, turn a blind eye to the truth. Once to say Jews were a race was anti-Semitic, now to say they're not a race is anti-Semitic. It's crazy how history plays with us.\\" Shlomo Sand cited Danielle Venton, 'Highlight: Out of Khazaria‚ÄîEvidence for ‚ÄúJewish Genome‚Äù Lacking,' in Genome Biology and Evolution, Vol.5, Issue 1, 2013 pp.75-6. As in historical research so in genetics, he argues: \\"It is very easy to showcase certain findings while marginalizing others and to present your study as scholarly research.\\"Ofer Aderet, 'The Jewish people's ultimate treasure hunt,' at Haaretz, 28 December 2012. Some geneticists conducting studies in Jewish genetics have challenged Elhaik's methods. Michael Hammer, a geneticist at the University of Arizona, called one of Elhaik's underlying assumptions \\"unrealistic\\", reasoning that Armenians have Middle Eastern roots, which, he says, is why they appeared to be genetically related to Ashkenazi Jews in Elhaik's study. He described Elhaik and other proponents of the Khazarian hypothesis as \\"outlier folks ... who have a minority view that's not supported scientifically.\\"Rita Rubin, 'Jews a Race' Genetic Theory Comes Under Fierce Attack by DNA Expert,'. The Forward, 7 May 2013. Marcus Feldman, a geneticist at Stanford University and director of its Morrison Institute for Population and Resource Studies, agrees: \\"If you take all of the careful genetic population analysis that has been done over the last 15 years, ... there's no doubt about the common Middle Eastern origin\\" of the Jewish people. Feldman added that Elhaik \\"appears to be applying the statistics in a way that gives him different results from what everybody else has obtained from essentially similar data.‚Äù Dan Graur, professor of molecular evolution at the University of Houston and Elihak's doctoral supervisor, called Elhaik's conclusion that Ashkenazi Jews originated in the Caucasus region and not the Middle East \\"a very honest estimate\\" and said Elhaik \\"writes more provocatively than may be needed, but it's his style.\\" = Prizes = In France, it received the \\"Prix Aujourd'hui\\", a journalists' award given to a non-fiction political or historical work.

He was also one of the members of his inner circle. Early life & family Haydar was born in 1932 in the village of Hallet Ara, Jableh District, which was then part of the Alawite State set up by the French administration in Syria. It is not quite clear which Alawite tribe Haydar belongs to, and different sources either cite him as being a member of the Khayatin tribe, which is traditionally allied with the Kalbiyya tribe; to which the Assad family belongs. or possibly to the Haddadin tribe, to which Salah Jadid belonged. He was a childhood friend of Hafez al-Assad. Two of his five children married outside the Alawite faith, with his son marrying a Sunni and his daughter marrying a Shiite. Career Haydar joined the Ba'ath Party of Michel Aflaq as a schoolboy and was commissioned as an infantry officer in the Syrian Army in 1952, after studying at the Homs Military Academy. The Ba'ath Party came to power in Syria following the 1963 Syrian coup d'√©tat. Haydar went on to become the Commander of Syria's Special Forces in 1968 after training at the Soviet airborne forces' academy. Haydar remained close to his childhood friend Hafez al-Assad, and supported him in the 1970 Syrian Corrective Revolution, which brought Hafez to power. Haydar provided military support for Hafez during the coup, helping to oust Salah Jadid and President Nureddin al-Atassi. Haydar remained as Commander of the Special Forces under Hafez, and emerged as a key figure in Hafez's inner circle, and was one of Hafez's most loyal officers. Haydar's high status and membership of a different Alawite tribe helped Hafez consolidate his hold over the Alawite community, which he also maintained through marriage and the appointment of other tribal representatives to high office. Haydar's Special Forces expanded in size to 25,000 men, and formed a key part of the Syrian government's security apparatus. The Special Forces were trained in airborne operations, and were rivaled on power only by the Defense Companies controlled by Hafez's brother, Rifaat. As such, the 14th Division became a strong counter-weight to the Defense Companies, as both these formations were largely airborne divisions. However, the Special Forces lacked the heavy armour and artillery capabilities which Rifaat's forces had. Instead, its specialization was in anti-Tank operations and sniper warfare. Haidar pioneered in very aggressive tactics and training, and the Syrian special forces' snipers and their sniper doctrine and tactics acquired a fearsome reputation which persists to this day. Under Haydar, the Special Forces units were deployed to Lebanon as part of the Syrian intervention in the Lebanese Civil War. During the war they engaged with PLO units under the command of Yasser Arafat. Haydar left his command in 1988 following an aneurysm, although later returned to his post in the early 1990s. He totally rejected any form of peace with Israel at the Madrid Conference of 1991. Haydar was deployed to Lebanon in 1982 following the Israeli offensive, with his Special Forces engaging the IDF. The Special Forces played a key role during the war, and were mainly stationed in Bhamdun and Tripoli. They also remained a key component of the Syrian governments defenses against internal and external threats, with units stationed on Mount Qasioun overlooking Damascus, and in the port city of Tartus. =1984 coup attempt= Hafez al-Assad fell ill in November 1983, and Rifaat al-Assad began planning a coup to seize the Presidency. Haydar was close to Rifaat, however he fiercely refused when Rifaat asked him to support him in the coup. Haydar reportedly said: Haydar's staunch refusal to partake in any coup reinforced his loyalty in Hafez's eyes. Haydar later confronted Rifaat in March 1984, when Rifaat attempted his coup. The Defense Companies under Rifaat's command began setting up checkpoints and roadblocks in Damascus, began to forcibly occupy State buildings, Police Stations, began to disarm the Police, and even tried to infiltrate his forces into the Defence Ministry HQ. Haydar deployed his Special Forces against the Defense Companies of Rifaat on the streets of Damascus, using his Anti-Tank platoons to directly challenge Rifaat's T-72 Tank units which were threatening government buildings. Haydar also ordered his sniper platoons which were deployed by parachute or from helicopters, to take up key positions near the residences of known Defense Company commanders in order to psychologically terrorize them. Sniper units also tactically besieged the Mezzeh Airbase and some other vital Defense Company bases and installations. Potential civil war was only averted through the action of Hafez, who intervened and placated Rifaat by making him Vice President, before sending him off into exile. Arrest and retirement Haidar, a Major General, was formally removed from his position as Commander of Syria's Special Forces and then imprisoned on 3 August 1994. Syrian sources talking to the al-Hayat newspaper claimed that Haydar had been imprisoned for failing to follow military orders, although others claimed the arrest followed criticism from Haidar of Hafez al-Assad for recalling Bashar al-Assad to Syria from London, where he was studying, in order to groom him for command following the death of his brother, Basil al-Assad. Haydar seemingly objected to the idea of Hafez's plans to keep succession to the Syrian Presidency within the Assad family. It was also suggested his removal was tied to his previous strong opposition to the peace talks then taking place between Syrian and Israeli envoys in Washington. His arrest and imprisonment happened during a restructuring of the Syrian Army designed to remove influential Alawite military leaders and in turn pave the way for the succession of the Presidency from Hafez al-Assad. It was also suggested that Haydar's arrest was accompanied by the arrest of a number of top ranking Alawite officials who either supported Haydar or shared his criticism of Hafez' plans for the Presidency. He was replaced with Maj. Gen. Ali Habib, a member of the Alawite Matawirah clan from Safita. Habib had previously commanded the Seventh Mechanized Division and had led Syrian forces in the 1991 Gulf War. A Jordanian analyst quoted by The Christian Science Monitor suggested Habib was chosen due to having shown himself willing to follow Hafez's orders in the Gulf War, as it showed commitment to Hafez's command over long standing Ba'athist ideological positions against what it saw as Western Imperialism. Despite his arrest, Haydar was never brought to trial or publicly humiliated, but was instead well treated in his brief captivity before being released and retired. He remained an important figure in the Syrian Ba'ath Party and the Syrian Army until Hafez's death in 2000.

The SDSS map helps the investigation of the mysterious \\"dark matter\\" and \\"dark energy\\" that make up 96 percent of the universe‚Äîand allow scientists to retrace the history of the universe over the last 11 billion years. Blanton has also helped to develop a new prism spectroscopy technique to obtain large numbers of redshifts of very distant galaxies to determine how galaxies have changed over the past eight billion years. The work was completed as part of the multi-institutional PRIMUS project. Blanton directs Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV, which will create a comprehensive spectroscopic map of the Milky Way, provide spatially resolved spectroscopy for 10,000 nearby galaxies, and create the largest volume map of the distant universe ever made.  Honors  Asteroid 140980 Blanton, discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at Apache Point Observatory in 2001, was named in his honor. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 6 April 2012 ().

His work provides provide empirical support for the idea that different temporal phases of memory consolidation can be best identified not by their different temporal domains, but by their molecular signatures.  Education  Carew obtained his Ph.D. from the University of California, Riverside in 1970.  Career  He then joined the laboratory of Eric Kandel as a postdoctoral fellow at the New York University School of Medicine. In 1974, he moved with the group to Columbia University‚Äôs College of Physicians and Surgeons, where he became a faculty member in the Department of Psychiatry. In 1983, he moved to Yale University as the John M. Musser Professor of Psychology and Professor of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. He served as Chair of the Department of Psychology for six years. In 2000, Carew became the Bren Professor and Chair of the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at the University of California, Irvine. In 2011 he became the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science and a member of the Center for Neural Science at New York University.  Research  Early in his career, in collaboration with Eric Kandel and colleagues, Carew provided the first evidence in Aplysia californica‚Äîthe California sea slug‚Äîfor both long-term memory and associative learning in this model system.Carew, T.J., Pinsker, H., and Kandel, E.R.

(1983) Differential classical conditioning of a defensive withdrawal reflex in Aplysia. Science 219, 397-400 Carew subsequently developed four lines of research that provide mechanistic insights into learning and memory. First, he was able to dissociate several different types of memory on both behavioral and synaptic levels, showing, for example, in contrast to a prevailing theoretical view, that it is possible to induce both intermediate-term and long-term synaptic changes underlying memory in the absence of short-term changes.Emptage, N.J. and Carew, T.J. (1993) Long-term synaptic facilitation in the absence of short-term facilitation in Aplysia sensory neurons. Science, 262, 253-256. Second, he developed experimental methods which permit independent analysis of somatic and synaptic compartments of identified neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) that are involved in memory formation showing, for instance, that local protein synthesis at the synapse is essential for the induction of intermediate-term memory.Sherff, Carolyn M. and Carew, T.

PNAS 101:7463-7468. Third, he has identified three mechanistically distinct phases of synaptic facilitation in the CNS, each of which predicted the existence and molecular features of distinct temporal phases of behavioral memory.Sutton, M.A. and Carew, T.J. (2000) Parallel molecular pathways mediate the expression of distinct forms of intermediate- term facilitation at tail sensory-motor synapses in Aplysia.Neuron, 26: 219-232.Sutton, M.A., Masters, S.E., Bagnall, M.W. and Carew, T.J. (2001) Molecular mechanisms underlying a unique intermediate phase of memory in Aplysia. Neuron, 31 (1): 143-154. Finally, in more recent work, he has identified the contribution of a number of specific molecular cascades, as well as their interactions, in the induction and consolidation of different forms of memory.Purcell AL, Sharma SK, Bagnall MW, Sutton MA, Carew TJ.

It was founded in 1725 in what is now known as Norwell, an area that was then part of Scituate). It is one of the oldest parishes in the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts. History The first meeting of the parish took place on July 28, 1725 at the North Meeting House in Scituate after a group of townspeople invited the Rev. Dr. Timothy Cutler of Christ Church, Boston, to lead a service and preach. Between 1727 and 1731 regular meetings of the parish took place in a private house in Scituate, led by the resident minister of Christ Church, Quincy, the Rev. Ebenezer Miller. On October 11, 1731, Miller led a service to open the first church building in front of a congregation of 150. That wooden building, located about from the present location, would serve as the parish's home until they moved to Hanover, which they did in 1811 after outgrowing the old church. Several notable figures, such as John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster, Robert Rantoul, and Horace Mann, were at \\"a large all-day gathering in the cause of education\\" in September 1838. The first resident minister for the parish, the Rev. Addington Davenport, was appointed in 1733. Addington remained only until 1737, but upon leaving for his next appointment made a gift of of land \\"with dwelling house, barn, and other buildings thereon.\\" Proceeds from this gift would help fund the purchase of land and building of a rectory in 1849. On December 24, 1986, the church was destroyed by an electrical fire, but later rebuilt. On November 6, 2011, the parish celebrated its bicentennial by displaying rare sermons and other artifacts, as well as a piano and organ concert and old church history stories.. Today, the church sits on Church Street in the Four Corners village of Hanover, a scenic village that was the starting point of Hanover itself.

The business saw early success due to the popularity of the Blue Box recycling system across Canada and the United States. Since then they have expanded to produce a wide range of recycling and waste containers in a variety of materials, from metal to plastic the latter products which mostly include high percentages of recycled content.  History  Waste Watcher Recycling Station, manufactured by Busch Systems. Busch Systems was founded as Busch Coskery of Canada Inc., by Craig Busch and his partner Stephen Coskery in 1985. Initially producing materials handling containers, Busch and Coskery quickly saw an opportunity for growth in producing recycling bins. Their big break came when the City of Hamilton accepted their tender to supply the city with blue box recycling bins going off of only drawings of the container. The company secured a $100,000 bank loan to buy a steel injection mold needed to make the recycling bins. After buying-out Coskery fairly early on, the company was renamed Busch Systems (Busch Systems International Inc.) and the 1990s continued on to be a period of remarkable growth and change including adding a manufacturing division to produce some of the most popular containers. In 2006, the company expanded to a new location on Saunders Road in Barrie, Ontario only to move again to its present location in 2012 on Rawson Road marking yet another period of remarkable growth and expansion of which continues today.

The projection room, on the first room, enables visiters to watch documentaries (films, reportage, etc.). The Ch√¢teau is the starting point for guided visits to the forest. Different events (storytelling, lectures, craft fairs, book signings etc.) are organised there on specific dates: the Pentec√¥te du Roi Arthur, the Rencontres de l'imaginaire de Broc√©liande and the Semaine du Dragon, among others. The Ch√¢teau is itself associated with a legend of the faery Viviane which is often told to interested visiters. =Petite Maison des L√©gendes= La Petite Maison des L√©gendes at Concoret in 2013.

As the name suggests, it coincides with the date of Pentecost. It is a celebration of spring and the adventures and encounters which it brings, but most importantly (according to Ouest-France) it is an evocation of King Arthur's coronation day (as described by Robert de Boron in the 13th century) and his commitment to the Church.

Gregory came to Morgan State after being out of football in 2012. He was the offensive coordinator at the University of South Alabama from 2009 to 2011 and has previously been a head coach at Missouri Southern State University from 1998 to 1999. Jerry Holmes joined as the defensive coordinator. Holmes previously served as head coach at Hampton University in 2008 and has coached as defensive coordinator for the Cleveland Browns (1999‚Äì2000), Washington Redskins (2001), San Diego Chargers (2002‚Äì2003), and Hampton (2004‚Äì2007). The Bears entered the 2013 season having been picked to finish ninth in the 2013 season. Morgan State hoped to prove those predictions wrong with their 3-second All-MEAC Pre-season members. They finished the season 5‚Äì7, 5‚Äì3 in MEAC play to finish in a tie for third place. At the end of the season, Hill- Eley was fired.

In 2014 Fast Company named it one of the most innovative companies in the world. History The company was founded by Paul Sellew in 2008. It initially received venture funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Waste Management, Inc., and later from True North Venture Partners, Industry Ventures, Generation Investment Management, DAG Ventures and others. As of February 2014, the company operated 40 facilities in North America including bioenergy facilities, yard waste drop-off and soil- and-mulch pick-up depots for landscapers, contractors and homeowners, and bagging facilities. In 2014 Kathleen Ligocki took the position of CEO of the company.Regan, Keith. \\"WomenUp: Kathleen Ligocki of Harvest Power Inc.\\" Boston Business Journal, 11 April 2014. Web. 21 April 2014 Its revenue in 2013 was, according to Ligocki, $130 million. In 2015, the company was ranked by Waste360 as the 29th largest waste and recycling firm based on 2014 revenues. Approach Harvest Power's services are cited as a model for a circular economy of converting food waste into energy and nutrient-rich soil products. Food waste specifically has been identified by cities and businesses as an untapped resource that ‚Äì if diverted from landfills ‚Äì can be used for clean energy and soil revitalization. As examples, New York City's strategy to build more digesters has been called the \\"brown energy movement\\", the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER) set the goal to divert 450,000 tons of food waste a year from landfills and incinerators, and California and other states are co-digesting food waste at sewage treatment plants. Facilities In 2013, Harvest Power began operations of three anaerobic digesters in North America. First, in Reedy Creek Improvement District of Orlando, Florida, food waste from Walt Disney World was an early input. As of September 2015, the facility was accepting 100 tons of food waste daily. The biogas produced by the facility fuels a 7-megawatt combined heat and power plant helping reduce waste going to landfills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Second, in British Columbia, the company opened the largest commercial scale high-solids anaerobic digester in North America that processes food scraps mixed with yard trimmings from the lower mainland. The facility recycles food waste that the regional government Metro Vancouver ultimately banned from landfills in January 2015. Third, in London, Ontario, the company opened a food waste digester to serve food waste processors, supermarkets, restaurants, and other commercial generators. In addition to bioenergy facilities, the company sells soils, mulches, and fertilizers ‚Äì more than 40 million bags at retail outlets such as Lowe's, The Home Depot, Walmart and independent garden centers, and thousands of cubic yards in bulk at landscape depots and via delivery ‚Äì each year.

It was designed by Carl LaVitch of Pennsauken, N.J. History Outside of Our Lady of Good Counsel Church, Moorestown, NJ The parish grew out of a mission on the farm of a Catholic family which had settled in Fellowship, NJ in 1832; they established a mission chapel named ‚ÄúThe Chapel of Our Lady and St. Patrick‚Äù at which Mass would sometimes be celebrated by priests traveling from the parish of Immaculate Conception in Camden, about ten miles to the southwest. At that time, the parish was in the Philadelphia Diocese and, as the Catholic population of the area grew, Bishop John Neumann of the Philadelphia Diocese in 1852 ordered that Mass be celebrated at the chapel monthly. After a fire destroyed the chapel in 1866, a straw purchase (used because of the antipathy towards Catholics in the town at the time) gained the congregation the land for a new church on the main street of Moorestown and the building, a brick church, opened in 1867. By 1879, the Bishop of Newark Michael Corrigan changed the status of the church from \\"mission church\\" to a parish‚Äîmeaning it would be served by a resident priest. The current church, built of Stockton stone, was erected after the original structure was damaged in a wind storm in the early 1890s and was completed sixteen months after the cornerstone was laid on July 14, 1895.http://www.olgcnj.org/parish/about/the- need-to-worship-publicly-with-others/parish-history/ School In 1927, the parish grade school opened with four classrooms for eight grades, staffed by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Chestnut Hill, who remained at the school until 1986.

By bundling general liability insurance and property insurance into a single policy, BOPs typically offer a reduced premium, often making them a more cost-effective option than separately purchased policies. Specific coverage included in a business owner's policy varies among insurance providers, but most policies require that businesses meet eligibility criteria to qualify.  Standard Coverage  A typical business owner's policy includes property and liability insurance. The property insurance portion of a BOP is available most often as named-peril coverage, which provides compensation only for damage caused by events specifically listed in the policy (typically fire, explosion, wind damage, vandalism, smoke damage, etc.). Some BOPs offer open- peril or ‚Äúall-risk‚Äù coverage; this option is available from the ‚Äúspecial‚Äù BOP form rather than the ‚Äústandard.‚Äù Types of property covered by a BOP usually include: *Buildings: Owned or rented business premises, additions and additions in progress, outdoor fixtures. *Personal business property: Any items owned by the business or business owner or owned by a third party but kept temporarily in the care, custody or control of the business or business owner. To be covered by a BOP, business property must be stored or kept in specified proximity of business premises (e.g., within 100 feet of the premises). In addition, many business owner's policies include business interruption insurance as part of their property coverage. Business interruption insurance provides up to 12 months‚Äô income for covered businesses when they are forced to shut down operations because of a covered property event. The liability portion of a business owner's policy offers coverage for third parties who suffer bodily injury, property damage, advertising injury or personal injury on a covered business's premises or caused by the business's owner or employees. This coverage typically takes the form of compensation for legal fees related to third-party lawsuits over such incidents (including lawyers‚Äô fees, settlements and court costs). In addition, BOP liability coverage may include compensation for medical expenses that result from an injury to a third party on a covered business's premises for up to one year after the incident occurs. In addition to standard coverages, most insurance providers offer optional additions or endorsements on business owner's policies that business owners can use to tailor a policy to their specific needs.  Exclusions & Optional Coverages  Business owner's policies do not include the following types of insurance: *Liquor liability insurance for businesses that sell or manufacture alcohol. *Professional liability insurance *Workers‚Äô compensation *Health insurance *Disability insurance *Auto insurance Many insurance companies offer businesses the option to customize a BOP based on specific coverage needs. Optional property endorsements that can be added to a BOP include coverage for certain crimes, spoilage of merchandise, computer equipment, mechanical breakdown, forgery and fidelity bond, but the coverage limits for these inclusions are typically low.  Eligibility  Business owner's policies are not available to every business. Eligibility requirements vary among insurance providers, but typically include limitations to: *Class of business (eligible classes include small restaurants, retail stores, apartments, office- or service-based businesses, wholesale distributors and contractors). *Location of the majority of business operations (most BOPs require businesses to complete primarily on-premises business). *Size (area) of a business's primary location. *Revenue.

The system was first noted within the monsoon trough on March 11, 1997, as a weak shallow depression within the vicinity of Rotuma. Over the next two days, the depression remained near Rotuma with no preferred movement, as it started to develop further within favorable conditions for further development. The system was subsequently named Hina on March 15, after it had started to move eastwards and had passed to the southeast of Niulakita, Tuvalu. During that day the system moved south-eastwards and impacted Wallis and Futuna, before it passed over Tonga's southern islands of Tongatapu and 'Eua during March 16. After impacting Tonga the system moved rapidly towards the south-southeast and weakened below tropical cyclone intensity, before it was last noted on March 21 about to the south of the Pitcairn Islands. During the systems post analysis it was determined that the warning centers had underestimated Hina's intensity as it passed over Tonga, after damage had been greater than expected in the island nation. Within Tuvalu it was difficult to assess damage done by Hina alone, after Cyclone Gavin impacted the area a week earlier. Storm surge and strong winds from both cyclones caused a severe amount of coastal erosion on all of the country‚Äôs nine atolls, with about 6.7% of land washed into the sea. Hina caused no significant damage on Walls Island, while it caused some damage to crops and destroyed parts of the road on Futuna Island. As Hina affected Tonga, there were no casualties reported as the system affected the island nation, however, Vaiola Hospital reported that they had treated a number of patients for injuries that were caused during the systems aftermath. One indirect death was also reported, after a person suffering a heart attack while evacuating from his home. The cyclone left extensive damage to utilities and agriculture on Tongatapu, where trees were uprooted and more than of fruit and food crops were destroyed, mostly to banana and coconut trees. After the cyclone the Tongan Government requested and received emergency aid, from the governments of several countries including France, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and the United Kingdom. This was after the government had provided T$5 million (US$3.97 million), or about 5% of its national budget to facilitate the immediate start of emergency relief and repairs to essential services. Meteorological history During March 11, 1997, a shallow tropical depression developed within the monsoon trough near the Fijian Dependency: Rotuma. Over the next two days the depression remained near Rotuma with no preferred movement, as it started to develop further in an area of minimal vertical wind shear and good upper air divergence. During March 13, as the system moved northwards, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) subsequently initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 33P. During that day after having moved to the north, Hina curved to the east and later south-eastwards, before it passed about to the southeast of Niulakita the southernmost island of Tuvalu during March 14. Early on March 15, after the system had passed near Niulakita, the depression developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and was named Hina by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS). After being named the system accelerated towards the south-southeast and an area of increasing vertical wind shear, as it passed near the west coast of Futuna Island. The system also crossed the 180th meridian during that day, which prompted the JTWC to pass the responsibility for warning the United States Government to the Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center (NPMOC). Early on March 16, as Hina passed over the southern islands of Tonga, the FMS reported that based on satellite imagery and guidance from other meteorological centers, the system had 10-minute sustained wind speeds of . Hina subsequently passed over the islands of Tongatapu and  ªEua in southern Tonga at around 08:30 UTC and took less than 2 hours to inflict considerable damage on the islands. The system subsequently emerged back into the South Pacific Ocean, with the FMS estimating that the system had storm force winds of about . Later that day the NPMOC estimated that Hina had peak 1-minute sustained windspeeds of as it rapidly moved below 25¬∞S and out of the FMS's area of responsibility. Over the next few days the system continued to move towards the south-southeast and gradually weakened, before the NPMOC issued its final advisory during March 18, as the system was undergoing a transition to become an extratropical cyclone. The system weakened below tropical cyclone intensity during the next day, before it was last noted by MetService on March 21, while it was located about to the south of the Pitcairn Islands. After an analysis of the observed data and the damage in Tonga, the FMS estimated that Hina's landfall intensity was underestimated. The observed wind data suggested that the system had storm force sustained winds, but had peak gusts comparable to hurricane force. Furthermore, the lowest pressure values also indicated that the winds had to be stronger than estimated, for it to fit known wind- pressure relationships. It was subsequently deduced by the FMS that Hina was a minimal category 3 severe tropical cyclone, with peak 10-minute sustained wind speeds of when it crossed the Tonga island of Tongatapu at around 08:30 UTC (21:30 UTC+13). The NPMOC also revised their estimate of Hina's peak 1-minute sustained wind speeds from to during post analysis, which made the system equivalent to a category one hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Preparations and impact Cyclone Hina caused over worth of damage and was indirectly responsible for one death as it affected Tuvalu, Wallis and Futuna and Tonga. The system's worst impact was reported on the Tongatapu and 'Eua, which are the southernmost islands of the Kingdom of Tonga. Due to the impact of this storm, the name Hina was retired from the tropical cyclone naming lists. =Tuvalu= On March 12, the FMS issued gale warnings for the southern islands of Tuvalu and a tropical cyclone alert for the rest of the archipelago. The gale warning was subsequently extended out to cover the whole of the archipelago during the next day, after marginal squally gale-force winds were observed to the north of the monsoon trough in association with the system. Over the next two days the warning was kept in force while Tuvalu experienced strong to gale-force winds because of a convergence zone located over the islands and Hina which passed about to the southeast of Niulakita, Tuvalu. Cyclone Hina was the second of three tropical cyclones to affect Tuvalu during the 1996-97 cyclone season, after Cyclone Gavin had severely damaged the islands a weak earlier and Cyclone Keli affected the islands during June 1997. Cyclone Gavin and Hina's waves, storm surge and strong winds both caused a severe amount of coastal erosion on all of the country‚Äôs nine atolls with about 6.7% of the land washed into the sea. Both cyclones caused severe coastal erosion and destruction to food crops, mostly to the southern islands of Niulakita and Nukulaelae, while damage in northern and central islands was confined mostly to houses. A damage assessment team noted that it was difficult to assess damage done by Hina alone and estimated the total damage from both cyclones at (). It was later estimated after Cyclone Keli had affected the islands between June 12‚Äì16, 1996, that the three cyclones had been responsible for about of land disappearing into the sea. Rehabilitation costs from all three cyclones, amounted to (). =Wallis and Futuna= As the system developed into a tropical cyclone during March 14, gale warnings were issued for the French territory of Wallis and Futuna. The system at this time was located about to the northwest of Futuna Island and subsequently accelerated, towards the south-southeast and passed near the island during the next day. Cyclone Hina was the second of four tropical cyclones to affect Wallis and Futuna in a ten-month period, after Cyclone Gavin had severely damaged food crops ten days earlier and Cyclones Keli and Ron affected the islands during June 1997 and January 1998. During March 15 as Hina affected the islands, winds of and were recorded at Hihifo on Wallis and Maopoopo on Futuna respectively. Rainfall totals of and were also recorded at Maopoopo and in Point Vele respectively. Hina caused no significant damage on Walls Island, while it caused some damage to the remaining crops and destroyed parts of the road on Futuna Island. =Tonga= Hina was the first of three tropical cyclones to affect Tonga during a ten-month period, with Cyclones Keli and Ron affecting the island nation during June 1997 and January 1998. Late on March 15, ahead of the system affecting Tonga, gale warnings were issued for the Southern Tongan island groups of Ha ªapai, Tongatapu and Vava ªu. During the next day, Hina took less than two hours to inflict considerable damage on the Tongan islands and became the worst tropical cyclone to affect Tonga since Cyclone Isaac during 1982. The two worst-affected Tongan islands were Tongatapu and 'Eua after major damages were reported on both islands. As the system impacted Tonga, the FMS received several reports of one or more tornadoes occurring in Tonga; however, during a post-disaster survey no evidence was found to prove or disprove this claim. It was noted that several of the badly damaged houses had little or no cyclone protection while over 600 people were left homeless. Damages were greater than had been expected, with an estimated damage total of about Tongan Pa'anga () reported. A post disaster survey attributed the greater damages to higher than expected wind gusts caused by either a low level squall or a jet streak. There were no casualties reported as the system affected the island nation, however, Vaiola Hospital reported that they had treated a number of patients for injuries that were caused during the system's aftermath. One indirect death was also reported, after a sea captain suffered a heart attack while evacuating from his home. Within the islands severe damage to power lines and telecommunication systems was reported. Alt URL The system affected the islands after the lowest tide for the day, as a result sea damage was minimal, though some evidence of salt damage to taro plantations was observed. On the main island of Tongatapu, extensive damages to utilities, vegetation and agriculture in places, with more than of fruit and food crops including banana trees and coconut palms destroyed. Some of the coconut palms were snapped, which suggested that wind gusts of between had been experienced on the island. Within Nuku ªalofa the capital city of Tonga, there was not a lot of structural damage reported; however, the villages to the east of the capital were severely affected. The roof and grand stand of Teufaiva Stadium was blown off, while the Parliament house, government buildings and schools were severely damaged. The MV Lofa was driven by fierce winds onto Mounu Reef in Nuku'alofa Harbour. The Electric and Water boards sustained over in damage to its infrastructure, with power lines brought down throughout Tongatapu which caused a complete blackout during March 16. Some of the uprooted trees knocked down power lines, sometimes causing a domino effect of bringing down additional power poles. As a result of the electric problems, there was a lack of electrical power to power pumps, with the water supply becoming intermittent. On 'Eua Island, Hina was estimated to have caused greater damage then Cyclone Isaac had done fifteen years previously, after the island was completely devastated by the system. The Tongan Government estimated that damage to the wharfs on Lifuka and Foa islands would cost over to repair, while the land bridge between the two islands was closed after Hina's winds and waves swept boulders on to the bridge. During the system's aftermath, insurance companies flew in people to assess the damage, while agricultural authorities on Tongatapu and 'Eua advised landowners to plant fast maturing produce such as sweet potatoes. The Tongan Government provided () or about 5% of its national budget to facilitate the immediate start of emergency relief and repairs to essential services. Tents were supplied by the National Disaster Committee and Ministry of Works to act as temporary shelters for those who were homeless after the system. By March 19, the Tonga Electric Power Board had restored electricity to several consumers including major government buildings and the Nuku'alofa Business District. However, several consumers were expected to be without electric until at least June 1997. On March 25, the Acting Prime Minister of Tonga convened a meeting of donors, where an official request for international assistance was presented. Alt URL At the meeting donors were requested to review existing of proposed bilateral programs, to see if they can be adjusted or brought forward to cater for the repairs or rebuilding of schools and other government buildings. The New Zealand Government deployed to Tonga, four electricity line mechanics, a fully equipped truck, along with various supplies including tarpaulins, blankets and electric. New Zealand also offered grants off up to to replace village water tanks, and towards the clean-up costs. The Government of the United Kingdom granted (, ) for ten emergency generators, while the Chinese Government pledged (). The French government provided a cargo plane, to conduct a damage survey of the affected areas and for tents, tarpaulins and blankets and two diesel generators. The Japanese Government provided tents, plastic sheets and other emergency aid materials to the value of . Australia provided for temporary roof repairs and equipment to restore electricity supplies in both Tongatapu and 'Eua. Grants between and were pledged by Germany, Norway and the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs respectively. By early September 1997, the reconstruction of primary school buildings damaged by the cyclone had been completed after the Tongan Government funded the project. New accommodation for primary school teachers in the Ha'apai islands and the Niuas was also completed after the Australian and New Zealand Governments funded the projects. MMI insurance provided the Tonga Amateur Sports Association with to cover damages to the Teufaiva Grand Stand.

It is part of the Hand in Hand network, whose shared vision is to fight poverty through job and business creation. Hand in Hand was founded by Percy Barnevik and Dr Kalpana Sankar. Hand in Hand‚Äôs mission is to work for the economic and social empowerment of the poorest and most marginalized people by supporting the development of businesses and jobs. Since 2003, the Hand in Hand network has helped start and sustain 1.6 million businesses and generated 2.3 million jobs. The goal is to create 10 million jobs. Hand in Hand works in the same field as BRAC, Opportunity International, CARE, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Aga Khan Foundation.  History  The story of Hand in Hand begin in the late 1980s with two Swedish teachers - Olle and Gunnel Blomqvist - visiting the district of Kancheepuram. Children traditionally constituted a cheap source of labour for the weaving industry in Kancheepuram, and parents who did not have permanent jobs would send their children to master weavers. Bringing such children out of labour was Hand in Hand's initial focus. At the end of 1990 the Blomqvists came in contact with Percy Barnevik, who became a sponsor to the organization. Barnevik was interested in the teachers' work in India. Hand in Hand India was founded in 2003 by Barnevik and Dr Kalpana Sankar in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The Hand in Hand network has operated programs in 10 countries across Asia (Afghanistan, India, Cambodia and Myanmar) and East Africa (Kenya and Rwanda). Hand in Hand receives funding from a number of different sources including individuals, corporations, bi-lateral and multi-lateral institutions and trusts and foundations. Recent supporters include the FMO, Sida, Johnson & Johnson Corporate Citizenship Trust, Nationale Postcode Loterij and Voxtra (philanthropic foundation based in Oslo, Norway). Hand in Hand Afghanistan also received a US $1.16 million (‚Ç¨840 K) grant from the European Union. In 2007, Hand in Hand Afghanistan was set up with Seema Ghani as chair. On 19 February 2014, Ghani gave an interview with the BBC about the economic challenges facing Afghanistan and how job creation will help solve many of the challenges. She also gave an interview to Forbes magazine regarding the positive effect of micro-businesses on Afghanistan. Since 2011, Hand in Hand has organised an annual Social Enterprise Program (SEP). The course showcases the role of social entrepreneurs in reducing poverty. As of 2013, Hand in Hand International's board of trustees included Percy Barnevik (Honorary Chair), Bruce Grant (Chair), Dr Madhvi Chanrai, Paola Uggla, Dr Rita Rakus MBBS and Lars G Josefsson. In 2013, Hand in Hand launched the Enterprise Incubation Fund (EIF), through which philanthropists can provide loans to micro- entrepreneurs in Kenya.  Hand in Hand network  The organizations within the Hand in Hand group actively support each other, although they are independent and each organization has its own governance and management structure as well as strategic plan. Each organization is represented by its CEO on the Hand in Hand Global Council. The Global Council coordinates policy and activities across the Hand in Hand network. Today, the Hand in Hand network extends to: *Hand in Hand India *Hand in Hand Eastern Africa *Hand in Hand Afghanistan *Hand in Hand International *Hand in Hand Sweden The network has support and fundraising offices in London, Stockholm and Boston.  Job creation model  The Hand in Hand network uses a comprehensive business creation model, initially developed by Hand in Hand India, to fight poverty. There are four interlinked elements that deliver the Hand in Hand approach: * Social mobilization: Hand in Hand helps organize people, mostly women, into Self-Help Groups (SHGs), who meet weekly with their trainers to discuss social issues and activities. Together, they begin to save money, learn financial discipline and build up group savings funds for which they are jointly responsible. * Business training: Once a group has demonstrated stability and financial responsibility, Hand in Hand provides business training in how to start, grow and sustain a small enterprise and become an entrepreneur. * Credit access: Most groups hold joint savings in local savings accounts and learn how to manage these. Should financial resources be required beyond group members‚Äô own savings, members are trained in credit management and offered small loans, either directly or through partners active in their area. * Market linkage support: Hand in Hand provides support in improving productivity and competitiveness, including advice on better packaging, pricing and branding; cheaper sourcing of supplies; quality control; reliable delivery; and more effective identification of and negotiation with buyers.  Results  Globally, in the past 10 years, Hand in Hand has generated more than 1.6 million businesses and 2.3 million jobs. An independent report published in 2012 confirmed that 97.4% of the jobs are sustainable. To date, Hand in Hand Afghanistan has enabled 36,000 people to join groups as a first step to working their way out of poverty, and generated more than 11,000 jobs in rural, remote parts of the country. Hand in Hand Eastern Africa has generated 270,000 jobs, and Hand in Hand India has generated 1.92 million jobs. In most countries in which the network operates, Hand in Hand has achieved sizeable reach with its Self-Help Groups in comparison to other established NGOs.

Construction and dimensions Originally named Viper built for the Irish Channel service between Scotland and Ireland, she was a steel; triple-screw turbine driven vessel. Viper was built at Govan by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, launched 10 March 1906. The vessel's dimensions were a length of 315'; beam 39'6\\"; and depth 16'6\\". Vipers engines developed 6,500 i.h.p. which gave her a service speed of 21 knots. She had accommodation for 1,700 passengers and a crew of 61. Viper was purchased by the Steam Packet on 22 March 1920 and renamed Snaefell. The consideration was ¬£160,000. Service life Under her original owners, G. and J.

War service =First World War= Under her original owners, the vessel saw service in the First World War as a troopship. Little is known of her Great War service, but it is fair to assume she was used mainly for trooping duties between the Kent ports, Southampton and the main French port serving the British Expeditionary Force at Le Havre. =Second World War= At the outbreak of war, the Steam Packet operated a fleet comprising 16 ships. The Rushen Castle and Snaefell were kept to maintain the Isle of Man's vital link with the mainland, Snaefell primarily as a relief vessel. For a while the joined them, and the , and stayed on to handle freight.

During his professional boxing career he worked as a painter and decorator. Boxing career =Amateur= =Professional= Early career Jimmy Cable began his professional career on 18 November 1980, when he outpointed Mick Miller over six rounds at the York Hall, Bethnal Green. He won his next thirteen contests, including a win over Gary Cooper, before being knocked out in two rounds by the Jamaican- born, Cardiff-based veteran Horace McKenzie at the Royal Albert Hall on 17 March 1982. He recovered to win his next four contests before being narrowly outpointed by the former British light-middleweight champion Jimmy Batten at the Albert Hall in February 1983. He then won his next six contests including a points victory over Nick Wilshire in May 1983 when he had recovered from two knockdowns to win on points. British and European championships Cable won the vacant British Light-Middleweight title in February 1984 by outpointing Nick Wilshire over twelve rounds by 118 points to 117 at the Royal Albert Hall. The Glasgow Herald's correspondent described it as a victory for the \\"rapier\\" over the \\"bludgeon\\". A month after winning the British title at the Albert Hall, Cable was matched against the American Buster Drayton at the same venue. Drayton, who had been acting as a sparring partner to Marvin Hagler knocked Cable down in 45 seconds of the first round and ended the fight with a \\"sweeping\\" left hook 40 seconds later to inflict the third defeat of Cable's career. Drayton later won the IBF championship at the same weight. In May Cable travelled to Toulouse in France to challenge for the EBU light middleweight title against Said \\"Freddy\\" Skouma. Cable won the title by knocking out his French opponent in the eleventh round. Cable reign as European champion lasted just over four months: on 28 September he was outpointed over twelve rounds by Georg Steinherr in Munich. Cable successfully defended his remaining championship belt in February 1985 at the Alexandra Palace, outpointing Gary Cooper, a Hampshire boxer who went on to win the same title in 1988. Three months later, Cable defended his British title against the former champion Prince Rodney at Hastings Pier Ballroom. Cable lost his title and was knocked out in less than two minutes of the first round. Later career After the loss of his titles, Cable continued to box under a British Boxing Board of Control license until 1988, recording three wins, two draws and four defeats. Unlicensed boxing After his retirement from professional boxing, Cable had some success as an unlicensed boxer. He claimed to have earned more money winning an unlicensed bout in Streatham in 1993 than he had done in winning the British championship against Wilshire.

A nephrologist who takes care of patients with cancer is called an Onconephrologist. This branch of nephrology encompasses both the hematologic and oncology based cancers and their treatment related complications that deal with the kidney. Unlike general nephrology, there are several aspects of onconephrology that are unique. Kidney failure from break down of cancer cells, usually after chemotherapy, is unique to onconephrology. The Syndrome of Inappropriate Anti Diuretic Hormone (SIADH) that causes low serum sodium concentration and first described in lung cancer patients is common in cancer patients. Kidney diseases that are unique to bone marrow transplant (aka Stem Cell Transplant or SCT) are frequently seen in cancer patients. Fluid, electrolytes and acid base disturbances are much more common and often severe in cancer patients, especially in those who receive chemotherapy. Several chemotherapeutic agents ‚Äì for example cisplatin ‚Äì are associated with acute and chronic kidney injuries. Newer agents such as anti Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (anti VEGF) are also associated with similar injuries, as well as proteinuria, hypertension and thrombotic microangiopathy. The most common form of kidney disease in cancer patients is acute kidney injury (AKI) which can usually be due to volume depletion from vomiting and diarrhea that occur following chemotherapy or occasionally due to kidney toxicities of chemotherapeutic agents. Less frequently AKI can occur due to obstruction to urine flow from tumor or lymph node enlargement. Also, cancer cells by infiltrating the kidney or myeloma proteins by precipitating with in the tubules of the kidney can cause kidney injury. Cancer management has become comprehensive and multidisciplinary, and often an onconephrologist is included in major centers to address and advice on kidney problems in cancer patients. Topics that are usually of interest to onco-nephrologists are: 1\\\\. Electrolyte disorders of malignancy 2\\\\. Secondary Glomerular diseases of malignancy 3\\\\.

The following operations are considered as part of the strategic operation: :Kingisepp-Luga Defensive 10 July ‚Äì 23 September 1941 :Soltsy-Dno Offensive 14‚Äì22 July 1941 :Tallinn Defensive 5‚Äì 28 August 1941 :Staraya-Russa Offensive 8‚Äì23 August 1941 :Demyansk Defensive 6‚Äì26 September 1941  Positions of the German forces at the start of the operation  After the start of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941, the German Army Group North, consisting of the 18th, the 4th Panzer Group and 16th Armies, had made a spectacular advance through the Baltics states. In two and a half weeks, Lithuania and Latvia had been overrun and on 9 July, the 4th Panzer Group had already reached Pskov in Russia and the southern shore of Lake Peipus, with a bulge to the north-east towards Slavkovich. On the left flank of the bulge was the XXXXI Motorized Corps and on the right the LVI Motorized Corps. The German 18th Army had advanced along the coast and pursued the Soviet 8th Army from its position on the border. The Soviet 8th Army was able to break contact and establish new defensive lines farther to the rear of the pre-war borders. On 10 July the German 18th Army, helped by the local Forest Brothers, had entered Southern Estonia and was positioned with its left flank occupying positions north of the city of P√§rnu, along the P√§rnu River through the V√µhma District and then south-east to Tartu and Lake Peipus. The 16th Army was at that time on the southern flank of the Army Group around the Velikaya River and west of Novorzhev. The Infantry of the 16th Army was lacking behind the 4th Panzergroup because of the difference in speed, but also because it was asked to support Army Group Center on its right flank.Operation Barbarossa June-July 1941 Area covered during the operation =Territory= The campaign was conducted in the area to the northwest of the Kalinin Region to the Baltic Sea. In the north the land line of operations was limited to the shores of the Gulf of Finland, north of the Gulf Soviet troops were engaged in the Arctic-Karelia Strategic Defensive and the defense of the Hanko Peninsula. In the east the German troops reached the southern shore of Lake Ladoga, south along the Kirisha River to Kirishi, then south along the Volkhov River to Veliky Novgorod, including the city, then along the western side of Lake Ilmen to Staraya Russa, from there to the north end of Lake Vella and from the western boundary of the lake to the north shore of Lake Seliger to the region west of Peno. South of the border demarcation operated the forces of German Army Group Center. The width of the fighting front was roughly 450 kilometers and advanced a total of 270‚Äì300 kilometers due to Soviet withdrawals. Background and operational plans of the forces involved =German plans= On 10 July, it was decided that Panzer Group 4 was to launch a two-pronged attack, without waiting for the slower infantry to arrive. The XXXXI Panzer Corps of Georg-Hans Reinhardt was to attack towards the city of Luga, while LVI Panzer Corps of Erich von Manstein was to advance toward Lake Ilmen in a flanking movement. =Soviet plans= Civilians working on the Luga defensive line in the summer of 1941. On 4 July, General Georgy Zhukov, chief of the General Staff, gave the Military Council of the Northern Front instructions to defend Leningrad. The guideline envisaged the construction of a defensive line between Narva, Luga and Staraja Russa and expanding it to a depth of 10 to 15 km. From the end of June, three divisions of national people's militia were recruited in Leningrad and used to occupy the Luga line. On 6 July, General Konstantin Piadyshev was appointed commander of the new line of defense along the Luga River, and the Northern Front Military Council decided to strengthen the Luga section by transferring the 237th Rifle Division from Petrozavodsk and the 21st and 24th Tank Division of the 10th Mechanized Corps from Karelia. Stawka Guideline No. 260 of 7 July ordered that the commander of the Northern front immediately transferred the 70th and 177th Rifle Division to the commander of the Northwestern Front. When the German breakthrough began to emerge south of Lake Peipus, the troops of the new line of defense were combined on 6 July to form the Luga Operational Group under General Konstantin Piadyshev's command. The Leningrad Infantry School (2000 men), the Kingisepp Militia and the Leningrad Gun and MG Infantry School (1900 men) soon concentrated in the area east of the city of Narva. A separate mountain rifle brigade (5800 men), which was recruited in Leningrad, was designed to secure the Luga line. The defined line of defense extended almost 250 kilometers in length from the Gulf of Finland along the rivers Luga, Mshaga, Luga Shelon to Lake Ilmen. The Luga Operational Group consisted of 4 rifle divisions: 70th, 111th, 177th and 191st rifle division as well as the 1st, 2nd and 3rd division of the national militia and the 41st Rifle Corps with the 90th, 235th and 118th rifle divisions. Order of battle The German ground forces were supported by Luftflotte 1 which was reinforces by the 8th Fliegercorps as the operation progressed. Course of the operation German advance 10-14 July 1941 and the Soviet Luga Line = Offensive of the XXXXI Panzer Corps (10-14 July) = On 10 July 1941, the advanced units of German Army Group North, breaking the line of the Velikaya River, continued their attack on Leningrad. The XXXXI Panzer Corps, under command of Georg-Hans Reinhardt and consisting of two panzer, motorized and infantry divisions and supported by aviation, pushed the 118th Rifle Division back to Gdov, and the 90th and 111th Rifle Divisions to Luga. On July 12, German troops clashed with cover units of the Luga defensive line in the Plyussa River area and were stopped during stubborn fighting. Unable to bypass the defending troops from the flanks because of the swampy terrain, Reinhardt left the 269th Infantry Division at Luga, and diverted the main forces of the XXXXI Panzer Corps towards the north-west and by 14 July captured two bridgeheads on the right bank on the Luga River near the villages of Ivanovskoye and Bol'shoy Sabsk in the area of Kingisepp. The German troops were stopped at these positions by the forces of the Luga Operational Group and were only able to continue the offensive a month later. Meanwhile, a large gap was formed between the two Corps of the 4th Panzer Group, which was now divided into two parts heading in different directions. Furthermore, the swampy-wooded area of the Leningrad region seriously impeded the independent actions of the tank units. = Offensive of the LVI Panzer Corps (10-14 July) = On 10 July, the 3rd Motorized Division of the LVI Panzer Corps occupied the city of Porkhov and continued the offensive in the direction of Dno. The 182nd Soviet Rifle Division fought against the advance, successfully repulsed two attacks, and inflicted about 400 soldiers and officers killed on the German 3rd Motorized Division. In addition, Soviet gunners destroyed or damaged 20 enemy tanks. Despite this, by nightfall, the Germans were able to advance east of Porkhov for another three kilometers. On 12 July, the SS Totenkopf Division was left behind in the Porkhov area, and the 3rd motorized division was directed along a side road to the north. The 8th Panzer Division launched an attack on Shimsk, moving along the highway along the left bank of the Shelon River in the direction of Novgorod. The remnants of the 3rd Tank Division of the 1st Mechanized Corps were trying to hold back the German offensive, retreating from line to line. On 14 July, German units occupied Soltsy and reached the line of the Mshaga River. Despite the fact that German air reconnaissance reported a great concentration of Soviet troops and fresh approaches from the north, the immediate task of the 8th Panzer Division was to capture the bridge over Mshaga in an intact state. By 14 July, the right flank of the LVI Corps, which was not covered by anything, turned out to be 70 km long, and the uncovered left flank, some 40 km. The command of the Corps believed that its safety was ensured by its speed. = Soviet counter-attack : Battle of Soltsy (14-22 July) = The Soviet command decided to take advantage of the fact that the LVI Panzer Corps was left without cover. The commander of the Northwestern Front, Major General Pyotr Sobennikov, on 13 July 1941, issued Order No. 012 to the troops of the 11th Army under command of Lieutenant General Vasili Morozov, reinforced by formations of the Northern Front (21st Tank, 70th and 237th Rifle divisions), to carry out a counter-attack and restore the situation in the Soltsy area. After approvals, on the evening of 13 July, the commander of the 11th and 27th Armies was sent directive No. 010 on the beginning of the counterstrike. The development of the counterstrike plan took place under the leadership of the Chief of Staff of the North-Western Front Nikolai Vatutin. It was based on the information printed on a secret map that fell into the hands of the Soviet command. It marked the position of all six divisions of Hoepner's Panzer Group. After checking the intelligence data, the headquarters of the North-Western Front developed a counter-offensive plan. By order of the headquarters of the North-Western Front, the commander of the Soviet 11th Army created two groups of forces for counterattack - the northern and southern. They were to cut off the German group that had broken through to the Mshaga River. From the northern grouping, two divisions (the 21st Tank and 237th Rifle divisions) advanced from the Gorodishche and Utorgosh line in the southwestern direction, on Baranovo and Sitnya, and the 70th Rifle division advanced in the southern direction, towards Soltsy. The 1st Separate Mountain Rifle Brigade (1GSSR) attacked Soltsy from the east. The divisions of the southern group (the 183rd rifle from the 27th army) were to advance in the northern direction, to Sitnya, and there to join up with the units of the northern group. On 14 July 1941, with the support of 235 aircraft, the Soviet 11th Army went on the offensive. The sudden counterattack of Soviet troops came as a complete surprise to the German command. The bulk of the German 8th Panzer Division was surrounded. At the same time, the German 3rd Motorized Infantry Division was in a difficult position. On 16 July, the Soviet 70th Rifle Division under the command of Major General Andrey Fedyunin occupied Soltsy. On the same day, the commander of the Northwestern Front ordered the front armies to complete the defeat of the enemy in the Soltsy area and, firmly holding the line occupied by the center and left flank of the 27th Army, the rest of the forces went on the offensive. However, Manstein ordered the correct counter-action: he withdrew his troops some 40 km and prepared for all-out defence. Most of the LVI Panzer Corps managed to break out of the encirclement and on 16 July, the SS Totenkopf Division was transferred to the LVI Panzer Corps, which restored the situation on the Shelon River. The Soviets launched wave after wave of attacks on the German positions, but were thrown back with heavy losses. The fierce Soviet counterattack had as effect that on 19 July the entire German Army Group \\"North\\" suspended the offensive towards Leningrad. The 8th Panzer Division, which had suffered serious losses, was withdrawn to the rear. On 16 July, the 1st Army Corps had been transferred to the 4th Panzer Group and on 18 July it took Dno from the 22nd Rifle Corps. Soltsy was retaken on 22 July but an attack of the German 21st Infantry Division on Shimsk was repulsed. Only on 27 July did the situation along the entire front between Narva and Lake Ilmen stabilize, and was Army Group North able to think again about continuing the offensive against Leningrad. = Renewed German offensive : Battle of Luga-Kingisepp (8 August - 23 August) = German renewed advance The German command had decided to wait for the arrival of the bulk of the 18th Army from Northern Estonia and the 16th Army from Eastern Latvia, to launch a new offensive. On 8 August the LVI Panzer Corps attacked in the area of Luga but failed to advance against strong Soviet defensive positions. At the same time, the XXXXI Panzer Corps attacked in the Kingisepp area and was more successful. The 8th Panzer Division was added to the Corps and after defeating the 1st Soviet Tank Division at Moloskovitchi, the divisions of the XXXXI Panzer corps reached the road from Kingisepp to Gatchina on 16 August. The next day, the German 1st Infantry Division conquered Kingisepp, while the 291st Infantry Division occupied Narva from the west and the 58th Infantry Division from the south. Meanwhile, German tanks began to bypass the city of Luga on country and forest roads and reached the river Luga in the area 20‚Äì25 km southeast of Kingisepp. Under the threat of being cut off from Leningrad, the German XXXVIII Corps forced the 8th Soviet Army to withdraw onto the Koporskoye plateau on 18 August. Further to the east, the German 16th Army had launched its attack towards Novgorod on 10 August. Preceded by intense aerial attacks by the VIII Air Corps under General Von Richthofen, the German 1st Army Corps (General of the Infantry Kuno-Hans von Both) attacked Novgorod directly with the 11th and 21st Infantry Divisions. The defensive positions of the Soviet troops could be breached. On 14 August 14, the 21st Infantry Division advanced on the Novgorod-Luga highway, and the 11th Infantry Division approached the line from the same direction. This threatened the rear connecting lines of the Soviet troops on the Luga line. The German attack on 15 August initially failed but the Soviet resistance was broken by attacks by dive bombers, which set Novgorod on fire in many places. In the evening the 21st Infantry Division was able to penetrate the city, at the same time as the 424th Regiment of the 126th Infantry Division. On the morning of 16 August, Novgorod was in German hands and the remaining regiments of the 21st Infantry Division launched an attack on Chudovo. The Soviets 48th Army launched a counterattack to retake Novgorod and the battle for the eastern part of Novgorod lasted until 19 August. Strong air support ultimately ensured the Germans' success in the battles for Novgorod. During the Battle of Novgorod, the left wing of the German I Corps advanced to Chudovo. The 11th Infantry Division now secured the right flank of the corps on the Volkhov section and the 21st Infantry Division conquered Chudovo on 20 August and interrupted the railway line there. The next day, several Soviet counter-attacks on units of the 1st Army Corps were repelled. The targets of the 16th Army had been reached. The attack by the German XXVIII Corps of the 16th Army finally unlocked the left flank of General Astanin's Luga group. The SS Police Division had also been moved 74 kilometers north to the east bank of Luga and stormed on the city of Luga from the southeast on August 24. On 22 August, General Astanin had received the order to pull back his units behind the railroad to Gatchina (Krasnogvardeysk), but it was too late. The Soviet 70th, 90th, 111th, 177th and 235th Rifle Division, the 1st and 3rd Militia Division, the 24th Armored Division were trapped in the \\"Luga Pocket\\". The encirclement was completed in the north by XXXXI Panzer, in the south by the L Army Corps and in the east by XXVIII Army Corps. The struggle in the Luga Pocket continued until mid-September 1941, and some units were able to break out eastwards.Warfare History Network : Panzergroup 4, the march to Leningrad = The Soviet Staraya Russa Counter-offensive (12-25 August) = Meanwhile on the southern wing the Soviets were planning their own offensive in what became known as the Staraya Russa Offensive Operation. The plan was for the newly formed Soviet 48th Army to attack from the Novgorod region along the northwest side of Lake Ilmen, while the newly formed 34th Army, supported by 11th and 27th Armies, would attack south of Lake Ilmen. The Soviets engaged 8 rifle divisions, a cavalry corps and a tank division for the offensive, with the objective of recapturing Staraya Russa and Dno, and destroying the 16th Army‚Äôs X Infantry Corps. The offensive started on 12th August and immediately threatened to overwhelm and trap the X Infantry Corps against Lake Ilmen. The commander-in-chief of the German Army Group North, von Leeb, was forced to transfer the 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf to the area of the Soviet offensive, it was soon followed by the 3rd Motorized Division and Erich von Manstein's LVI Panzer Corps, which was already heavily engaged at Luga. The 8th Air Corps of von Richthofen was also involved in repelling the Soviet counterattack. On 19th August, the LVI Panzer Corps‚Äô attack caught the 34th Army by surprise in the flank. The 34th Army was badly damaged and attempted to withdraw. By 22nd August, the LVI Panzer Corps reached the Lovat River having captured 12,000 men from the retreating 34th Army. As a result of the unsuccessful offensive, the commander of the North-Western Front, Major General Pyotr Sobennikov, was removed from office and sentenced to 5 years in prison, later replaced by a demotion. The commander of the 34th Army, Major General Kuzma Kachanov, was arrested on 12 September, trialed for cowardice and executed on 29 September.Operation Barbarossa August-September 1941 On 28 August, Tallinn fell after a siege of 3 weeks and the Soviet Baltic Fleet evacuated the city. The Germans had conquered Estonia and a large strip of Western Russia up to southern shores of the Gulf of Finland, although some strong-points of Soviet defence held out. = Encirclement of Leningrad (25 August - 21 September) = Final advance on Leningrad For the final attack on the city, the German XXXIX Panzer Corps was relocated from Army Group Centre to Army Group North. It was ordered to cut off the city from the rest of the Soviet Union, bypassing the city to the east. The I Army Corps was to advance north along the left bank of the Volkhov river towards Kirishi, covering the right flank of the XXXIX Panzer Army. With the deepening crisis the Stavka assigned the newly mobilised 4th, 52nd and 54th Armies along and east of the Volkhov River. The Stavka also approved the formation of two new Armies: the 42nd and 55th, which would defend Leningrad itself. The main German thrust on Leningrad was to be executed by the XXXXI Panzer Corps, in cooperation with the XXXVIII Army Corps on its left flank. In the south, between Gatchina and Mga, the L and XXVIII Army corps were to attack the southern belt around Leningrad. On 25 and 26 August the two Panzer corps attacked. The XXXIX Panzer Corps captured Lyuban the same day and advanced towards the Neva River. On 1 September, the XXXIX Panzer Corps captured Mga and cut the last rail link to Leningrad. On 8 September, the 20th Motorized Division captured Shlisselburg on the shores of Lake Ladoga, closing the last land route out of Leningrad. In the meantime, the XXXXI Panzer Division, supported by von Chappuis‚Äôs infantry, cut through the Soviet lines and advanced almost 10 kilometers and put further pressure on the shrinking line around Leningrad and the Oranienbaum region. Also in the South, Soviet defensive positions began to crumble : Krasnoye Selo was lost on 12 September and Krasnogvardeysk (Gatchina) on 13 September. The remains of General Baranov's armored division continued to withdraw, occupying new positions on the Pulkovo Heights, the last line of defense on the southwestern approach of Leningrad. In mid September 1941, two events had a serious impact on the course of events around Leningrad. On 14 September, Georgi Zhukov arrived in Leningrad to replace Marshal Voroshilov and ordered immediate counter-measures to push back the German troops. Around the same time, Adolf Hitler had changed his mind on Leningrad. He decided that Army Group North should not occupy the city, but surround it and starve it into submission. He also ordered the furious von Leeb to hand over all his armoured units and Panzer Group 4 to Army Group Centre for the coming attack on Moscow, except the 39th Panzer Corps. From 14 to 21 September the 18th Army continued to push the Soviet perimeter inwards, finally isolating the Soviet 8th Army in the Oranienbaum Pocket against the Gulf of Finland. On 17 September, Tsarskoye Selo in the town of Pushkin, was occupied by the German troops. During this period, the 41st and 56th Panzer Corps and the HQ of 4th Panzer Group were pulled back form the frontline to participate in the Battle of Moscow, and the German advance came to a halt. Results of the operations At great costs, the Soviets had held the Luga Line for 45 days : from 10 July until 24 August, when German troops took Luga. Until 10 July, the average daily advance of the Germans was about 26 kilometers per day; then it fell to 5 kilometers a day and in August to 2.2 kilometers a day. Stopping and delaying the German advance enabled the Soviet leadership to take important measures regarding the defense of Leningrad, including the formation and training of new military units. Furthermore, between 29 June and 27 August 1941, 488,703 civilians were evacuated from Leningrad. The retreating Soviet forces (and civilians alike) were cut off the Soviet mainland in Leningrad, isolated from the bulk of Soviet-controlled territory by the Finns and Lake Ladoga. Despite many costly attempts, the Soviets did not lift the siege completely until January 1944. Subsequent operations continued on the outskirts of Leningrad, including the 1st and Second Sinyavino Offensives from 10 September ‚Äì 28 October 1941 and the Tikhvin Defensive from 16 October ‚Äì 18 November 1941.

History  In 1940, after the Red Army accepted for service the 61-K 37 mm anti-aircraft gun, the VVS leadership decided to equip some fighters and a part of the upcoming production series of the Ilyushin Il-2 ground attack aircraft with a 37 mm autocannon capable of firing the same shell. Shpitalniy designed a gun that was gas operated and magazine fed, which however used a less powerful cartridge than the 61-K gun. By early 1941, a prototype Sh-37 was flight tested on a LaGG-3 fighter. As installed in the LaGG-3, the gun together with its magazine weighed 208.4 kg. In this test it achieved a rate of fire of 184 rounds per minute. At the end of June 1941, it was decided that within 45 days 40 more Sh-37 were to be produced for military trials. These were manufactured as planned by factory 74. In 1942, the same factory produced a further 196 Sh-37 guns. The first LaGG-3 aircraft equipped with the Sh-37 gun were delivered to the 42nd IAP in the beginning of 1942. In August 1942, a small series of 22 Yak-7-37, equipped with the same gun, passed military trials with the same 42nd IAP, led by Boris Shinkarenko. The Sh-37 was powerful enough to down an enemy fighter with a single hit. Its shell could punch a hole with an area of over . The MPSh-37 was supplied with 20 rounds of ammunition in this aircraft. The Yak-7-37 was additionally armed with two UBS 12.7 mm machine guns, with 450 rounds total ammunition. The weight of fire of the Yak-7-37 was 4.15 kg/s (9.15 lb/s). The length of the Sh-37 gun necessitated moving the cockpit some 40 cm rearwards, and the weight of the Yak-7-37 increased by some 200 kg compared to its proximate predecessor, the Yak-7B. By mid-1941 an Il-2 exemplar was experimentally fitted with a pair of Sh-37 cannons in underwing pods. By September 15, this aircraft had passed ground and air firing test at the factory, and was presented for state trials, which were conducted between September 23 and October 12, 1941. Each Sh-37 gun on this Il-2 was provisioned with 40 rounds of ammunition. The large ammunition magazine did not fit in the wings, and mandated a conformal gun pod mount of a rather bulky design. As fitted to the wing of the Il-2, the weight of the Sh-37 with the assembly and magazine was 302.5 kg. The rate of fire measured in this latter installation was 169 rpm; muzzle velocity was 894 m/s. The underwing position of the 37mm gun pods in the Il-2 had the unpleasant effect that when the guns were fired in a dive, their recoil caused the aircraft to pitch down even further, thus reducing salvo accuracy. The flight characteristics of the Il-2 armed with the Sh-37 guns were substantially worse than for the regular versions fitted with 20 or 23 mm guns. It was slower and more difficult to handle. Its top airspeed was only at sea level and at . Its rate of climb also deteriorated and the length of its take-off run had increased. Nevertheless, between December 1942 and January 1943, a limited production run of nine Il-2s armed with Sh-37 guns was delivered to the 688th Attack Air Regiment (ShAP) of the 228th Attack Air Division (16th Air Army) for military trials. These aircraft took part in the combat around Stalingrad that winter. The Sh-37 gun proved somewhat effective against the German tanks of the day. It could pierce the armor of light tanks without problem and at favorable angles it was effective against German medium tanks as well. However, effective use of the gun required a high degree of skill from the pilots. Besides the diving issue, poor firing synchronization between the guns (as installed in these aircraft) caused them to also veer laterally off-course when the Sh-37 guns were fired. Consequently, bursts of only two or three rounds were practical. To compound the problems, the Sh-37 guns were also rather unreliable, with frequent jamming occurring. Even though the Sh-37s were installed in pairs, this actually decreased the overall reliability of the aircraft as a weapon system, because the jamming of a single gun meant that the Il-2 could not fire safely any longer, due to the strong, asymmetric recoil from a single gun having a very strong destabilizing effect on the aircraft. After these experiences, the Il-2 with Sh-37 guns was not ordered in mass production.

A park-to-reverse situation involves a driver who believes that they have shifted into \\"park\\" and believing so, proceeds to exit the vehicle. There can then be a delay in vehicle movement sufficient for the driver to either fully or partially exit the vehicle before the vehicle moves. Typically, the vehicle will move backwards. However, when on certain vehicles the shift selector can be placed between the detented park and reverse gear positions; i.e. in false park the transmission is in hydraulic neutral, without the parking pawl engaged. As such the vehicle can also roll either forward or back in neutral. While less common, transmissions with the defect, can also be shifted to between \\"neutral\\" and \\"drive\\", and then self shift into \\"drive\\" or roll (called a \\"neutral to drive\\" accident). Park-to-Reverse issues are nearly always caused by several possible design flaws in a vehicle's transmission which makes it possible for a driver to unknowingly place the vehicle's shift selector into a position in between the \\"park\\" and \\"reverse\\" gear positions. Yet rather than being in \\"park', this area is a transitional zone between gears, which is sometimes called \\"false park\\".U.S. Department of Transportation - National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ODI Resume (Aug 26, 2004)  http://www- odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/ACM5654686/INCR- EA04025-23767P.pdfU.S. Department of Transportation - National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Final Report VRTC-DCD5083 Unintended Powered Roll-away in Reverse After Parking - Dodge Ram Pickup Track When a vehicle's transmission is in false park, it may appear to the driver that the vehicle is fully locked in \\"park\\".

Because of the possible safety issue of this, and because driving a vehicle not fully in a gear over a long period of time could damage the transmission, automakers developed what is called the \\"detent system.\\" The system of detents was often used in conjunction with the \\"push button\\" shifters used on many automatics in the 1950s. Typical detent systems use either a detent spring and ball or a cantilever spring and this spring moves up and down over a series of teethed gears (called a \\"rooster comb\\" for how it looks, or an \\"inner manuel lever\\") turning the rooster comb to fine center the transmission in the intended gear position at the bottom of each gear. However, if the spring is too weak to always move the rooster comb to the bottom of the trough between the teeth, the vehicle can be left between gears. On certain U.S. car manufacturers' vehicles, the problem is made worse as there is a flat spot between \\"Park\\" and \\"Reverse\\" detents where the ball can rest, also resulting in a \\"false park\\".

Giles Rooke, by John Hoppner Life The third son of Giles Rooke, a merchant of London and director of the East India Company, by Frances, daughter of Leonard Cropp (1710-1785) of Southampton, he was born on 3 June 1743. He was educated at Harrow School and matriculated at St John's College, Oxford on 26 November 1759, graduating B.A. in 1763. He proceeded M.A. in 1766, and in the same year was elected to a fellowship at Merton College, which he held until 1785. Rooke was also called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1766, and went the western circuit. In 1781 he was called to the degree of serjeant-at-law, and in April 1793 was made king's serjeant. At the next Exeter assizes he prosecuted to conviction William Winterbotham, a dissenting minister at Plymouth, for preaching sermons of a revolutionary tendency; and on 13 November of the same year was appointed to the puisne judgeship of the Court of Common Pleas, left vacant by the death of John Wilson. At the same time he was knighted. Rooke presided at the trial at the York Lent assizes in 1795 of Henry Redhead Yorke for conspiracy against the government.

On March 20, 1241, units of the Mongol Army reached the Oder near Raciborz, and began to cross the river. Duke Mieszko II the Fat, aware of this, decided to attack the invaders while they were busy trying to get across the Oder. With an unknown number of knights, he attacked the Mongols, killed probably 400 Asiatic warriors, and defeated them. After the battle, Mieszko's army headed towards Legnica, where Christian forces under Duke Henry II the Pious concentrated to engage the Mongols in the Battle of Legnica.  Sources  * Piastowie.

Coaching career =Baseball= Affleck began his coaching career as the head coach of Harpur College's baseball program. (Harpur became part of the State University of New York system at the start of the 1965‚Äì1966 academic year, and was renamed State University of New York at Binghamton, as a result.) Affleck coached the school's baseball program for nine seasons (1964‚Äì1972) and had an overall record of 46-56-1.

Plot summary In mid-July, a sportfisherman tourist off the Florida Keys reels in a severed human arm. The Monroe County Sheriff Sonny Summers, who is hyper-sensitive to any publicity threat to the Keys' tourist trade, asks a former detective named Andrew Yancy to transport the arm to Miami immediately and ensure that any investigation is handled by the Dade County authorities. In Miami, Yancy meets Dr. Rosa Campesino, the Assistant Dade County coroner. As he predicted, she tells him there is not enough evidence to connect the severed arm with any unsolved crimes in Dade County. Yancy's colleague Rogelio Burton advises him to drop the arm on the roadside on his way home, but Yancy rebelliously decides to keep it preserved in his home's freezer. Yancy is currently on suspension, having assaulted the husband of his lover, Bonnie Witt, and is forced to work as a Health Inspector for the department of Hotels and Restaurants. During their last night together, before she and her husband move to Sarasota, Bonnie confesses that her real name is Plover Chase, and she is a fugitive from Oklahoma, a former high school teacher indicted for extorting sex from one of her underage students in exchange for giving him good grades in her AP English class. A woman, Eve Stripling, returns from a vacation in Europe and reports her husband, Nicholas \\"Nick\\" Stripling, missing. A DNA test quickly matches the severed arm with Nick, who Eve says likely died in a boating accident. A funeral is held for him and his arm is buried. However, Yancy becomes suspicious at Eve's lack of grief, and more suspicious when Caitlin, Nick's daughter and Eve's step-daughter, angrily insists that Eve killed her father for his money. Seeking redemption with the police force, Yancy investigates further. He was at the same restaurant and bar as the mate from the fishing boat that found the arm, Charles Phinney, when he is shot to death. His distraught girlfriend Madeline admits to Yancy that a woman matching Eve's description gave him the severed arm and paid him to hook it on the tourist's fishing line. Investigating Stripling's medical supply company leads Yancy to a corrupt former surgeon named Gomez O'Peele who admits that Stripling was defrauding Medicare out of millions of dollars. Inside the Striplings' Florida vacation home, Yancy finds a hatchet and traces of blood, as well as bone splinters in the drain. He suspects that Eve killed her husband in the town house, then arranged for the arm to be found so he could be declared legally dead. However, Yancy's boss, the Sheriff, has no interest in pursuing the case any further, and Caitlin is delighted to abandon her suspicions as soon as Eve offers her half of Nick's life insurance. Both of them tell Yancy to abandon his investigation, but he refuses. A short time later, he is ambushed in his backyard, beaten, and nearly drowned by a masked man fitting the description of the mate's killer. Additionally, he notices that the man is wearing an expensive Tourbillon watch that matches the one that was absent but left a print on the arm. Rosa Campesino has been assisting Yancy with his investigation, and the two of them grow closer and eventually develop a sexual relationship. She agrees to accompany him on an undercover trip to the island of Andros, where Eve and a mysterious male companion are developing a vacation resort. On Andros, Yancy finds an unexpected ally in Neville Stafford, a Bahamian fisherman whose property was sold against his wishes to the new resort development, after which he returned to his longtime family beachfront home one day to find it demolished. Neville was so desperate to stop the development that he asked a local witch, the \\"Dragon Queen,\\" to put a voodoo curse on the developer, Christopher Grunion. Neville even parts with his only companion, a capuchin monkey named Driggs, who is traded to the Dragon Queen. Christopher is believed to be the mysterious boyfriend of Eve Stripling, whom Yancy has tracked via his seaplane registry as well as a record of the last phone call made by Gomez O‚Äô Peele before his death, provided by Rosa Campesino. Both provide the name Christopher Grunion. Rosa volunteers to visit the Grunions alone, posing as a wealthy American interested in buying one of the future resort homes. While waiting, Yancy converses with Neville, who mentions that he stole some personal items from Grunion's garbage to give to the Dragon Queen, including fishing shirt sleeves that had been neatly cut off. Suddenly understanding, Yancy rushes to the Grunion house, but is held at gunpoint by Christopher Grunion, who is revealed to be Nick Stripling, alive and missing his left arm. Like many Medicare fraudsters facing indictment, Nick decided he had to fake his own death to escape prosecution. Unlike others, he decided to \\"foolproof\\" the deception by leaving behind actual human remains, instead of simply disappearing. Stripling had his arm amputated by Gomez O‚ÄôPeele, and then had Eve plant it in Florida, before declaring him legally dead. Yancy delays his death by capturing Eve's little dog Tillie, knowing that Eve would be very distressed and would beg her husband not to shoot. Once Stripling lost his patience, he was about shoot Yancy but is ambushed by Neville, who stabs him in the spine with the broken shaft of a fishing rod Yancy brought with him. Fleeing the estate, Yancy and Neville run to the Dragon Queen's hut, where Stripling's hired thug named Egg took Rosa. They rescue her and Driggs, and Yancy threatens Stripling's own pilot into flying him and Rosa back to Miami. Nick, rendered almost paraplegic by the injury to his spine, lays all the blame on Eve for stopping him from shooting, who retaliates by murdering him and dumping his body at sea at night, to be devoured by sharks. All that remains is his right arm, which gets buried with his left. Attempting to speed away from the scene, Eve herself is killed when her boat crashes on a nearby reef. Returning home, Yancy's life is complicated by the reappearance of Bonnie Witt/Plover Chase, who left her husband and traveled back to Oklahoma to \\"re-connect\\" with her teenage lover, Cody Parish, now a lazy 30-year-old man. It took only a few days for Bonnie to grow tired of his lack of ambition, and pine for Yancy again. Having heard that Yancy already found another girlfriend, she decided to show her devotion to Yancy by burning down a spec home next to Yancy's that was hindering his view of the sunset. The Florida authorities offer to extradite her to Oklahoma, but she insists on staying in Florida to fight the arson charges. Yancy is secretly delighted that the spec home is gone, but he has no further interest in Bonnie. The OSBI agent sent to arrest Bonnie predicts that, before long, she will realize this and accept the extradition deal. The Monroe County Sheriff reluctantly gives Yancy credit for solving the severed arm case, but tells him that, because of the publicity surrounding Bonnie, it will be at least another year or two before it will be safe to reinstate Yancy as a detective. Yancy is disappointed, but happy to be in a steady relationship with Rosa. Back on Andros, Neville reclaims his home after the Striplings' resort project collapses.

He was the 1st Adigar (Maha Adikaram) from 1811 to 1814 under the reign King Sri Vikrama Rajasinha. Following the brutal execution of his entire family by the King, he aided the British in launching an invasion of the Kandy Kingdom and was instrumental in the Kandyan Convention that followed which led to the annexed the Kandy Kingdom to the British Empire. Early life He was born to a Radala family of courtiers who hailed from the village of Ehelepola, nine miles from Matale and was educated by the Yatawatte Maha Thera (Chief Priest Yatawatte) before joining the Royal court as part of the Royal household. Royal service Seal of Maha Nilame His first appointment was to the post of Paniwidakara Nilame by the King later he was appointed 2nd Adigar in 1808 succeeding Megastenne on his death. Ehelepola was appointed as Dissava of Sabaragamuva which was held by Megastenne. Sath Korale, which was also held by Megastenne was divided between Molligoda and Ehelepola which was unprecedented and caused much unrest amongst the populaces and resulted in riots in 1811 which had to be put down by Pilimatalawwe Nilame the 1st Adigar and Ehelepola's uncle. It also led to much animosity between Molligoda and Ehelepola. In 1811, Pilimatalawwe was beheaded after he was convicted of high treason for attempting to remove the King and replace him with the young Prince Kannasamy. Ehelepola was thereafter appointed as Maha Adigaram in 1811. The King became increasingly suspicious of the Radala families and his courtiers. His suppression of his repressive enemies was brutal and soon the King became unpopular among his chiefs and people. Rebellion Ehelepola Nilame's Monument in Mauritius. Soon the King fell out of favor with the Ehelepola and when a revolt broke out in Sabaragamuva, Ehelepola was sent to suppress it. When Ehelepola failed to return on the Kings summons, he sent Molligoda to capture and return with Ehelepola. Following an engagement with Molligoda's men, Ehelepola fled to the protection of the British forces in the coastal areas of the island. In the meantime Molligoda returned to Kandy with forty-seven chiefs of Sabaragamuwa as prisoners, they were executed in a day followed by the brutal execution of Ehelepola's family. On orders of the King Ehelepola's young sons aged 10 and 8 were executed along with his brother Ehelepola Disswa. Legend has it that when Ehelepola's eldest son ran to his mother at the sight of the executioner, his younger son Maduma Bandara stepped forward bravely and asked to be executed first. His infant son was placed in a rice pounder and pounded to death and the Ehelepola's wife Ehelepola Kumarihamy, their daughters and his sister-in- law were drowned in the Kandy Lake. Following these executions, the King lost support of the people and riots began to break out and the King fled to Hanguranketha. Under the advice of Ehelepola, who had found out about the fate of his family, the British invaded the Kandy Kingdom in January 1815 unopposed and entered the city of Kandy. The Kandyan Convention was signed on March 2 recognising the British Monarchy. The King of Kandy, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha was shortly captured and exiled to India. Later life and death Ehelepola became part of the British administration of Kandy but soon came under suspicion with Great Rebellion of 1817‚Äì18 he was arrested by the British and exiled to Mauritius along with several Kandian Chiefs. He died there in 1829. In popular culture The film Ahelepola Kumarihami directed by Sugath Samarakoon in 2014 reveals the slaughter of Ehelepola Nilame's entire family by the king.

Background The Kingdom of Kent. With the advent of the Anglo-Saxon period in the fifth century CE, the area that became Kent underwent a radical transformation on a political, social, and physical level. In the preceding era of Roman Britain, the area had been administered as the civitas of Cantiaci, a part of the Roman Empire, but following the collapse of Roman rule in 410 CE, many signs of Romano- British society began to disappear, replaced by those of the ascendant Anglo- Saxon culture. Later Anglo-Saxon accounts attribute this change to the widescale invasion of Germanic language tribes from northern Europe, namely the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. Archaeological and toponymic evidence shows that there was a great deal of syncretism, with Anglo-Saxon culture interacting and mixing with the Romano-British culture. The Old English term Kent first appears in the Anglo-Saxon period, and was based on the earlier Celtic-language name Cantii. Initially applied only to the area east of the River Medway, by the end of the sixth century it also referred to areas to the west of it. The Kingdom of Kent was the first recorded Anglo-Saxon kingdom to appear in the historical record, and by the end of sixth century, it had become a significant political power, exercising hegemony over large parts of southern and eastern Britain. At the time, Kent had strong trade links with Francia, while the Kentish royal family married members of Francia's Merovingian dynasty, who were already Christian. Kentish King √Üthelberht was the overlord of various neighbouring kingdoms when he converted to Christianity in the early seventh century as a result of Augustine of Canterbury and the Gregorian mission, who had been sent by Pope Gregory to replace England's pagan beliefs with Christianity. It was in this context that the Polhill cemetery was in use. Kent has a wealth of Early Medieval funerary archaeology. The earliest excavation of Anglo-Saxon Kentish graves was in the 17th century, when antiquarians took an increasing interest in the material remains of the period. In the ensuing centuries, antiquarian interest gave way to more methodical archaeological investigation, and prominent archaeologists like Bryan Faussett, James Douglas, Cecil Brent, George Payne, and Charles Roach Smith \\"dominated\\" archaeological research in Kent. Archaeological investigation The existence of Sarre was not noted by any of the early antiquarians who studied the Anglo-Saxon cemeteries of Kent. Sarre cemetery was discovered in 1843, and re-examined in 1860, when a number of artefacts were discovered during construction work at Sarre windmill, subsequently being purchased by the British Museum. It was excavated in 1863 by the Kent Archaeological Society, in a project directed by John Brent, who published his findings in the Archaeologia Cantiana journal. Aided by two workmen, he used a metal probe to determine the locations of the graves. After this excavation, which was believed to have been total, the cemetery was relegated to \\"the history of archaeology\\", being considered ‚Äúarguably the richest Anglo-Saxon burial ground yet discovered‚Äù. It was not scheduled as an Ancient Monument. In 1982, an excavation of the supposed site of St. Giles took place under the directorship of D.R.J. Perkins, revealing Anglo-Saxon graves around 50 metres away from Brent's excavated area. This led Perkins to review the original cemetery plan, and undertake aerial photography of the site; this suggested that there were various features that Brent had not revealed, and that the cemetery was larger than previously believed. It was decided that further excavation of the site was necessary, with the cooperation of the landowners, Church Commissioners, as well as the local farmer, Michael Baxter. In May 1991, Southern Water commenced a sewage construction near the site, and funded a rescue excavation of the area from the Trust for Thanet Archaeology.

The Olympic Bell was commissioned and cast for the 2012 London Olympic Games, and is the largest harmonically-tuned bell in the world. Cast in bronze bell metal, it is high with a diameter of , and weighs . The bell is now displayed in the Olympic Park. Making the bell In September 2011 the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, a few miles from the Olympic Stadium, was commissioned to make the bell. The Foundry completed its design, profile, lettering and tuning. However, it was no longer able to cast such a large bell (its furnace capacity is , as the large Victorian era bells had gone out of fashion), and so subcontracted casting to Royal Eijsbouts of the Netherlands. There was some controversy over using a non-British firm, as Taylor‚Äôs Bell Foundry in Loughborough had also tendered to cast the bell. The hammer mechanism and hanging framework were made by other firms and twenty companies in three countries were eventually involved with its production. The bell was installed and tested in the stadium at midnight on 1 June 2012. It was designed to be as large as possible but needed to fit through the athletes‚Äô tunnel; when it arrived there were only a few inches to spare. The bell is the second heaviest in Europe, after St Petersglocke in Cologne Cathedral and the largest harmonically tuned bell in the world. Its main note (in campanology, its 'hum tone') is a B note, and so it has the lowest tone in the world. The bell is inscribed with \\"London 2012\\" and a line from Caliban's speech in The Tempest: \\"Be not afeard, the isle is full of noises\\", which featured in the Olympics opening ceremony spoken by Kenneth Branagh. The other side bears the legend \\"Whitechapel\\" and the Foundry's coat of arms. Ringing the bell The bell in its current location, in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Bradley Wiggins, who had won the Tour de France five days earlier, opened the ceremony by 'ringing' the bell. This was symbolic as the hammer was actually moved mechanically: one journalist noted \\"He may be a superhuman athlete but even Bradley Wiggins isn‚Äôt capable of setting the Olympic Bell‚Äôs monumental half-ton clapper in motion by hand!\\" The bell was also rung later in the ceremony, including just before Paul McCartney's performance of \\"Hey Jude\\". Sir Paul blamed his faltering start on the unexpected loud sound of the bell, as he had forgotten it was going to be rung. The bell also featured in music within the ceremony, such as in \\"And I Will Kiss\\". The bell was recorded at night, in the rain during rehearsals; sound engineers had to ask for work to stop for half an hour to successfully record it. The bell hung in the Olympic Stadium for the opening ceremony. It was then moved to make way for the Olympic cauldron, and stored in the Olympic Park. The Olympic Park re-opened in July 2013, and in May 2016 the bell was returned and reinstalled on a supporting structure just outside the Olympic Stadium. The Olympic opening ceremony programme pledged that after 200 years the bell would return to the Whitechapel Bell Foundry for retuning,Olympic opening ceremony programme, page 13 but the foundry closed in 2017. The bell is not currently rung due to concerns that doing so would disturb nearby residents, making it possibly the largest ornamental bell in the world.

Founded in Melbourne, Australia in 2003, the World Literacy Foundation operates on the principle that education is a basic human right. It aims to eradicate global illiteracy through the promotion of literacy and the provision of educational resources. The World Literacy foundation works to get communities involved and raise awareness of the importance of literacy. It is reported that 1 out of every 10, or 750 million people globally are illiterate. Background Since its establishment in 2003, the World Literacy Foundation has grown to align with the needs of an evolving education sector. The World Literacy Foundation has worked towards forging partnerships with other leading educational and related not-for-profit organisations, and has built long-lasting relationships within communities around the world. The World Literacy Foundation significantly dedicates its time and resources to conducting research, and uses resulting information to help advocate in local communities as well as on a global scale. It mobilise communities through passionate volunteers, and seeks to give individuals a voice so that they can also act as advocates for literacy within their own communities. The World Literacy Foundation believes that raising community awareness is vital to the improvement of literacy standards. The World Literacy Foundation annually monitors a range of indicators in the education area and prepares a report on economic and social cost of illiteracy. In 2012, the WLF compiled a report which focuses on the economic and social cost of illiteracy in the United Kingdom. The research was devoted to economic and social cost of illiteracy in the country. It stated that one in five of the UK population is functionally illiterate and this rate costs the national economy 81 billion pounds a year in lost earnings and high welfare spending. The World Literacy Foundation convened the World Literacy Summit at Oxford University (UK) in April 2012 to stimulate co-operation in the global literacy sector in order to support 796 million illiterate people in developed and developing worlds. The list of invited delegates included about 300 leaders in the fields of government, development, literacy and academic sectors. The Oxford Declaration became the resulting document of this event; it was designed to combine efforts of government, business, non- governmental organizations and educational institutions to promote literacy worldwide.  International community projects  The World Literacy Foundation's projects are aimed at raising global literacy rates and teaching educational standards. The World Literacy Foundation volunteers and partner communities have worked in Azerbaijan, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Colombia, Mozambique, Uganda, and other developing countries to provide access to quality education and learning resources to disadvantaged communities. With bases on five of the seven continents, the World Literacy Foundation tailors each operation to the country's specific literacy needs. In the African sect based in Uganda, where many people live in poverty and have no electricity the World Literacy Foundation has donated solar powered tablets. Paired with the Sun Books initiative the World Literacy Foundation is not just donating recourses but also training to teachers at the primary school level. Where the foundation was started in Australia, the goal is geared towards closing the gap of literacy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children. For indigenous people illiteracy rates are a more prominent problem. To improve skills such as reading and number skills, the World Literacy Foundation has developed a program called the Indigenous Learning App. This app contains multilingual e-books and multiple literacy games in not just English but also the local dialect in Australia. In the African sect with headquarters in Uganda, where many people live in poverty and have no electricity the World Literacy Foundation has donated solar powered tablets. Paired with the Sun Books initiative the World Literacy Foundation is not just donating recourses but also training to teachers at the primary school level on how to use these resources effectively. The solar powered tablets come preloaded with digital learning content and multilingual e-books. In Uganda only roughly 27% of people have access to electricity and the cost of one book can be a whole month's salary. These Sun Books are useful in the sense that they do not need to be electrically charged and are universal tools, coming loaded with multiple uses. Several years ago, the World Literacy Foundation founded their South America sect in Manizales, Colombia. Latin America is in dire need of educational reform, over 35 million people over the age of 15 are illiterate. Here it is only expected that children attend school for 6 years compared to the traditional 12 most other countries require. To help improve these statistics the World Literacy Foundation runs two classes a week for over 60 children and other community members. During beneficial classes the World Literacy Foundation supports learners of all ages with tutoring and reading services. In the United Kingdom illiteracy costs the UK‚Äôs economy roughly $50 billion USD a year. It is here the World Literacy Foundation has run 26 fundraising projects, book distribution drives and provides numerous services. To help combat illiteracy the World literacy Foundation provides services such as parent mentoring, tutoring services, delivering literacy recourses, and distributes multilingual children/baby books. In the UK the World Literacy Foundation also has made a pack to new mothers to whom English would not be their first language to improve literacy and help them improve their standard of life. Even in the United States of America there is a literacy crisis. This gap can be measured by 30 million words, and this stretches from learners who live in poverty to those who are afforded the best education money can buy. Although it is not just the socioeconomics that divide America's literate, literacy rates also greatly range between racial groups. To support American learners the World Literacy Foundation has encouraged 150 schools to participate in International literacy Day. In February 2019 a project called Michigan Reads debuted; this is an initiative to provide tutoring and literacy resources to children from all backgrounds in Michigan. In America there are also over 60 Youth Ambassadors who promote literacy in their schools and communities. = Global projects = The World Literacy Foundation hosts several global projects a year. The most popular being the International Day of Literacy. The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has declared International Literacy Day September 8 and is annually celebrated by 4,000 schools. Each school participates by hosting events and fundraising to spread literacy awareness, and the belief that literacy is a basic human right. By encouraging schools to participate the World Literacy Foundation aims to spread awareness and understanding about the importance of literacy. By providing literacy skills through the promotion of International Literacy Day, the World Literacy Foundation hopes to also inspire learners to shoot for the stars and be the best them they can be. The Youth Ambassador project is run globally starting from the beginning of the application process in February the project runs through November when applicants are certified. The World Literacy Foundation enlists people aged 12‚Äì24 to raise awareness for literacy in their communities. Recently as 2018 the foundation has enlisted ambassadors from 35 separate countries ranking more than 300 strong. Youth Ambassadors work collectively as a group of motivated individuals who aim to eradicate illiteracy. Every two years the World Literacy Foundation hosts an event called the World Literacy Summit. Held in Oxford, UK this is a three-day long event in which numerous minds gather to discuss all matters surrounding global illiteracy. This event brings together literacy and educational leaders, specialists from governments, and inter-government bodies, for profit sectors, academic scholars and researchers. The goal is to build a global community of continuous collaboration on ideas and awareness for literacy. The fourth World Literacy Summit was scheduled for 5 April 2020.  Efforts to end world illiteracy  In 1965, UNESCO declared September 8 International Literacy Day. On the same date in 2016 the World Literacy Foundation launched ‚ÄúThe Sky‚Äôs The Limit‚Äù campaign. The purpose of this campaign is to hopefully eliminate the digital divide that separate communities in which electricity is not available. Another important project in Australia is ‚ÄúReading Out of Poverty‚Äù, where the World Literacy Foundation distribute children's books, literacy resources and tutoring to enhance literacy skills and reading levels of children from low income backgrounds. Although the World Literacy Foundation brings together many initiatives, projects and resources it is the communities who make the whole idea work. Between the corporation and openness of the participating communities and people like the Youth Ambassadors who donate their time, they are the ones who help this foundation function. Without volunteers and open minds nothing would change. But this change is essential, it will eventually allow for a greater level of understanding between all people.  Effects of illiteracy  According to studies by the World Literacy Foundation \\"illiterate parents tend to have lower expectations and aspirations regarding education for themselves and their children‚Äù. Poor families often place work before education and the children of the parents who have failed to complete primary education tend to do the same. The cost of illiteracy to the global economy is est. at USD $1.19 trillion. Illiteracy does not only impact us as a society economically. It also impacts the group of people who cannot advocate for themselves because they do not possess literacy skills to do so. In countries like Latin America where work is valued over school many children only receive half the education they are entitled to. Other reports published by the World Literacy Foundation also found those who cannot read earn lower salaries and illiterate parents' children are more likely to grow up unable to read and be trapped in a cycle.  Mission, vision, and goals  The mission of the World Literacy foundation is to ensure every individual has the opportunity to acquire literacy and reading skills. Regardless of geographic location, financial situation or social status, the World Literacy Foundation believes access to education is a basic human right. Free and appropriate access to education allows young individuals to eventually reach their full potential whether that be in the school or work setting. The vision from the World Literacy Foundation for the world, is a world in which everyone can read and write. A world in which all students have access to a free quality education that they can use to empower themselves. \\"Goals:To raise global literacy standards, to provide free access to quality education materials, to innovate solutions that target wide-scale illiteracyand to encourage lifelong learning.\\" The Purpose of the World Literacy foundation is to create a greater understanding and awareness of literacy in the community. The plan is to do this through the use of social media, conferences, training, research and collaborative partnerships internationally.

On recovery he returned to athletics and, despite a further stroke which left him in a wheelchair, he found an aptitude for the shot put. Jones was not selected for the Great Britain team at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London as it was believed the pressure on a then 14-year-old, would have been too great. In 2013, at the Fazza International Athletics, Jones set records in both the discus and shot put. He then joined the Great Britain team at the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships, representing his country in the F34 shot put. Jones was one of the early competitors in his event and on his fifth throw he recorded a world record distance of 13 meters and 38 centimeters. None of his rivals could match his distance, making Jones the new world champion at the age of 15. After a sporting injury to his throwing arm, Jones turned to rowing in 2015. Enrolled to Hartpury College for Sport and Exercise Sciences studies he focuses on training for international competitions while aiming for university and a job within the sport science industry.

It was established in February 1984 by Israeli activists from the Revolutionary Communist League (previously Matzpen-Jerusalem) and Palestinian leftwing activists from the West Bank. Funding Diakonia, using money from the Swedish government (1.5 million Swedish kronor in 2007‚Äì2009); ICCO (more than 500,000NIS in 2008); Christian Aid, with money from the Irish government (329,000 NIS in 2006); NGO PTM ‚Äì Mundubat (Spain), (1 million NIS in 2006); and Sodepau (support from the Catalan government 200,000 NIS in 2006). History Although officially founded in 1984, the AIC had already begun a year before in the form of discussions and as a partnership between Palestinian and Israeli activists. When established, it was one of Israel's very first Non Governmental Organizations and one of the first organizations to define itself as an explicitly joint Palestinian and Israeli organization, a very radical idea at the time (and, perhaps, still today). From its very beginning, the AIC was active in the Israeli and Palestinian peace movements and was very much involved in campaigns such as the (successful) one to stop the torture of the Palestinian prisoner Adnan Anans. In 1985, roughly a year after its founding, the AIC was even involved in secret negotiations between the Israeli government, the organization of Ahmad Jibril (PFLP-GC) and the Red Cross concerning the exchange of captives between Jibril's organization and Israel. The subsequent landmark trial of Warschawski ended with his acquittal on 30 out of the 31 clauses stated in the indictment. However, he was found guilty of the last clause: \\"Turning a blind eye\\" on the printing of an \\"Instruction Manual\\" ‚Äì a pamphlet which contained testimonies on GSS interrogations, the torture used during them and advice on how to overcome them. Warschawski was sentenced to eight months in prison with twelve months of a suspended sentence, while the AIC itself was heavily fined. In January 1999, three principal activists from the AIC, Elias Jeraysi, Inbal Perlson and Yohanan Lorwin, were killed in a flash flood in the Judean desert. The AIC is active within the Israeli and Palestinian peace camps. It has supported and become involved in campaigns and movements, and the global movement against neoliberal globalization.

The Packers remained after that league evolved into the Midwest League in 1955. The Packers played in the Midwest League from 1956‚Äì1968, before returning to play from 1974‚Äì1976. The Packers won Midwest League Championships in both 1955 and 1962. In 1962, the Keokuk Dodgers franchise was moved by the Midwest League from Keokuk, Iowa to Dubuque on August 2, 1962 to finish the season as the Midwest Dodgers. The team was an affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers. This move briefly gave Dubuque two teams. After the season, the Midwest Dodgers franchise moved and became the Wisconsin Rapids Twins. This franchise evolved into today's Fort Wayne TinCaps of the Midwest League. After the Packers folded, following the 1968 season, Dubuque was without a team until the Midwest League Quincy Gems franchise moved to Dubuque in 1974. The Packers played in the Midwest League from 1974‚Äì1976. The Danville Dodgers and Dubuque Packers franchises both folded from the Midwest League after the 1976 season. Ballpark From 1915 to 1976, Dubuque teams played at Memorial Stadium / John Petrakis Park. Built in 1914, Memorial Stadium was renamed after the president and GM of the franchise in 1967. Its dimensions were (LF-CF-RF): 340-400-340. The park was prone to flooding. The stadium was located at the 4th Street Extension, before East Dubuque Bridge in Dubuque, Iowa.Pitch in Time: The Story of the Dubuque Packers.

MaddAddam concludes the dystopian trilogy that began with Oryx and Crake (2003) and continued with The Year of the Flood (2009). While the plots of these previous novels ran along a parallel timeline, MaddAddam is the continuation of both books. MaddAddam is written from the perspective of Zeb and Toby, who were both introduced in The Year of the Flood. Plot The novel continues the story of some of the same characters in the wake of the same biological catastrophe depicted in Atwood's earlier novels in the trilogy. The narrative starts with Ren and Toby (protagonists in The Year of the Flood) rescuing another survivor (Amanda Payne) from two criminals, who had been previously emotionally hardened by a colosseum-style game called Painball. Ren and Toby meet up with Jimmy, the protagonist from Oryx and Crake. These characters reunite with other survivors, develop a camp and start to rebuild civilization with the Crakers, all while the vengeful criminals (Painballers) stalk them. Similarly to the previous two books, the narrative switches periodically into the past. After Zeb and Toby become lovers, he tells her about his previous career. Zeb and Adam One (from The Year of the Flood) grew up as half-brothers. Their father, a preacher (\\"The Rev\\"), advocated a corporate-friendly message that espoused petroleum and shunned environmentalism. Disgusted by his father‚Äôs ethics and hypocrisy, Zeb hacks into his father's accounts and empties them. Knowing their father's political influence, Zeb and Adam leave home, take on different identities and separate in order to avoid detection. Ultimately, Zeb and Adam re-unite and work together in building God's Gardeners, the central organization in The Year of the Flood. Critical reception Andrew Sean Greer said in The New York Times, \\"Atwood has brought the previous two books together in a fitting and joyous conclusion that's an epic not only of an imagined future but of our own past\\".Final Showdown NYTimes James Kidd of The Independent said, \\"Atwood's body of work will last precisely because she has told us about ourselves.

It is best known as the childhood home of George Berkeley, the Irish philosopher for whom Berkeley, California and the Trinity College Dublin Berkeley Library is named. The property is currently privately owned and the castle in urgent need of restoration. Located south of Thomastown, the site has held a medieval church, the castle, and other buildings. The castle and church property are situated low along the sharp curve of the River Nore. The church was originally adjoined to the castle but the properties were eventually separated by 21 ft. Dysart Castle was small and considered \\"rudely built,\\" divided by a stone arch, with an access path in the second storey leading into the church. Dysart's lands and structures were granted to the Priory of Kells by founder Geoffrey fitz Robert in 1193. The charter suggests that it was known as Dysart of St. Mo-Colm-√≥g, or Colman, meaning St. Colman was the patron of the place. The church and castle and surrounding property belonged to the Priory of Kells, until suppression in 1540. Accounts conflict over whether Berkeley was born at Dysart Castle in 1684; he was, however, raised on the grounds of Dysart, his family home which stood beside Dysart Castle. In the 2000s, with a summary report released in 2009, archaeologist Ben Murtaugh conducted an excavation of the area with the support of fund from the Royal Irish Academy. Ruins of three stone buildings remain above ground on the property and are situated next to or close to each other; four periods of activity were identified with the site. The first period related to the Early Medieval monastic site and church, associated with St. Colman. This included a primary stone church and graveyard, a round house, two cross slabs and Romanesque architectural fragments. In the second period, the site was an out farm or grange of the Augustinian Priory of Kells (c. 1200‚Äì1540). This included an extension to the church, the construction of a tower house and the later phases of the graveyard. The third period involved the post-medieval redevelopment of the site, following the abandonment of the graveyard for burials and the church for worship. The church appeared to have been converted into an outhouse or barn. Furthermore, a long dwelling house was constructed to the south of the tower house. In this third period, the place was the childhood home of philosopher George Berkeley (1685‚Äì1753).Murtaugh, Ben. Summary of 2009 RIA funded project regarding Dysart, Co. Kilkenny. pp. 1‚Äì3.

In April 2003, The Irish Times published an urgent appeal for assistance for restoration of Dysart Castle and cited the risk of \\"imminent collapse\\" following the emergence of new cracks in the walls of the castle; previously conservation work had been conducted with the aid of Kilkenny County Council acting for the Department of the Environment and private efforts.

He was unusual as a labor leader in that he did not believe in compulsory union membership and was comfortable with \\"labor capitalism\\". He supported a radical plan in which workers in an industry would take one-third of the profits, the other thirds going to capital and the public. By the end of his tenure the Brotherhood controlled investments worth over $100 million. Early years Warren Stanford Stone was born on 1 February 1860 on a farm near Ainsworth, Washington County, Iowa. He attended Western College, Iowa. When Stone completed his academic education in May 1879, he considered studying to become a surgeon, while his father wanted him to become a lawyer. Instead of taking either course, he started work on a railway. He obtained a job as a locomotive fireman with the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad in 1879, based in Eldon, Iowa. He was promoted to engineman five years later. He spent a further nineteen years in this position. In 1884 he married Carrie E. Newell. They had no children. Labor leader In August 1903 Stone was elected grand chief engineer of the International Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers to succeed Peter M. Arthur, who had died unexpectedly. Stone was a Republican but had progressive views. Several U.S. presidents offered him political appointments, but he refused them. Stone believed that if a worker \\"wants to join a union, all right, but it is contrary to the principles of free government and the Constitution of the United States . . . to make him join.\\" He had no problem with \\"labor capitalism\\", where union members would invest their savings to achieve the maximum return, even if that meant investing in non-union enterprises. Stone was proposed as a challenger to Samuel Gompers, President of the American Federation of Labor at that organization's Chicago conference in January 1920. Gompers believed the federation should take a non-socialist approach in representing wage-earners, campaigning for better wages, better hours, better working conditions and the unfettered right to strike. Stone supported the radical Glenn E. Plumb plan for tripartite control of the railway industry by labor, capital and the public, and supported similar plans for other industries. Stone appeared on the cover of Time magazine on 10 March 1924. Stone was one of the main supporters of the Progressive Party that backed Senator Robert M. La Follette, Sr. as candidate for President of the United States in 1924. In June 1924 the triennial convention of the Brotherhood created the office of President and elected Stone to this position. He was succeeded as grand chief engineer by L. G. Gritting. Financier Time Cover, 10 Mar 1924 Stone was a financier as well as a labor leader. Under his leadership the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers engaged in a wide range of financial activities in banks, trust companies and other business ventures. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers' Cooperative Bank was formed in Cleveland, Ohio in November 1920, and took over $1 million in deposits in the first two months. Based on this success, the Brotherhood opened a number of banks in different cities. To manage its investments the Brotherhood established the Brotherhood Holding Company in 1922 and the Brotherhood Investment Company in 1923. It was on Stone‚Äôs initiative that the 22-story Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers' Bank building was erected, completed just before his death. The building was owned by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and leased to the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers Co-Operatlve National Bank. Stone and other members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers became owners of the Coal River Collieries, and Stone became chairman of the board of directors of the mine. A dispute arose with John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America. Lewis claimed that Stone was closing mines and throwing miners out of work rather than pay the union scale. Stone refuted this, saying the unions had not renewed their agreement, but the mines were being worked on a cooperative plan. He said \\"We feel sure there are no better-satisfied men employed anywhere than in the Coal River Collieries.\\" Death and legacy Warren Stanford Stone died on 12 June 1925 of Bright's disease in a hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. At the time of his death, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers had majority interests in enterprises with assets of approximately $150,000,000. Throughout his tenure as head of the railway engineers, they had never had to call a strike. Stone was succeeded as president by William B. Prenter. Alvanley Johnston became grand chief engineer.

Hartford Foundation (JAHF or the Hartford Foundation) is a private United States-based philanthropy whose current mission is to improve the health of older Americans. For many years it made grants for research and education in geriatric medicine and other areas of health care, but has recently moved into aging-focused care delivery projects of a more applied nature.  History  Based in New York City, it was founded in 1929 by John Augustine Hartford and later joined by his brother George Ludlum Hartford, the family owners of the A&P; grocery chain. The foundation's mission from the beginning has been \\"to do the greatest good for the greatest number.\\"Jacobson, J. S. (1984). The Greatest Good: A History of the John A. Hartford Foundation. The foundation. The foundation's grants in the mid-20th century were predominantly for basic and clinical medical research; it was at one time the largest funder in this area. In the 1970s, the foundation moved towards a wider range of projects \\"that will have high impact.\\"  Activities  = Aging and health = From about 1980 to 2012, the foundation focused its efforts on building training capacity and conducting research at schools of medicine, nursing, and social work.Regenstreif, Donna I., Christopher A. Langston, and Corinne H. Rieder. \\"Decades of focus: Grant making at the John A. Hartford Foundation.\\" Health Affairs 23.2 (2004): 258-264. Its current programs aim at a more direct impact on the health of older adults. In 2008, the foundation led a consortium of grantmakers to fund a study from the Institute of Medicine to look at the \\"crisis\\" of an ill-prepared workforce and outdated models of caring for older adults. \\"Institute of Medicine . 2008. Retooling for an aging America: Building the health care workforce. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. = Medicine = One of the largest and most important programs in the foundation's recent history has been to help build academic capacity in geriatric medicine through the Centers of Excellence in Geriatric Medicine. These Centers are located at academic medicical centers around the country and were known as high throughput producers of academic geriatricians as well as the generators of basic, clinical, and population level medical knowledge about older adults.Reuben, David B., et al. \\"Building academic geriatric capacity: an evaluation of the John A. Hartford Foundation Centers of Excellence initiative.\\" Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 52.8 (2004):1384-1390 Another important initiative has been building bridges from geriatric medicine out to the subspecialities of internal medicine and surgical and related specialties.Hazzard, W.R., Woolard, N., & Regenstreif, D.I. \\"Integrating geriatrics into the subspecialties of internal medicine: The Hartford Foundation/American Geriatrics Society/Wake Forest University Bowman N. Gray School of Medicine Initiative.\\" Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 45.5 (1997): 638-640. The foundation has supported training and development programs for medical students, fellows, junior faculty, and senior thought leaders. = Nursing programs = The foundation's strategy to improve nursing care for older adults was also largely based on creating Centers of Excellence, and has been credited with providing extraordinary leadership in directing attention to the special nursing needs of older adults.Regenstreif, D. I., Brittis, S., Fagin, C. M., & Rieder, C. H. (2003). Strategies to advance geriatric nursing: The John A. Hartford Foundation initiatives. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, 51(10), 1479-1483.Huba, G. J., Fagin, C. M., Franklin, P. D., & Regenstreif, D. I. (2006). Outcomes and lessons learned from the John A.

B., Watman, R., Escobedo, M., & Beilenson, J. (2011). Clustering excellence to exert transformative change: The Hartford Geriatric Nursing Initiative (HGNI). Nursing Outlook, 59(4), 189-195. = Social work = Initially the foundation focused on enhancing the capability of schools of social work to train aging-competent social workers.It has increasingly focused on providing training and practice opportunities in real-world settings.Robbins, L. A., & Rieder, C. H. (2003). The John A. Hartford Foundation Geriatric Social Initiative. Journal of Gerontological Social Work, 39(1-2), 71-89. = Integrating and improving services = The foundation has long had an interest in helping to improve the delivery of health care in the U.S. In the 1970s, under the direction of CEO Bob Higgins, the foundation played a key role as a convenor of stakeholders to discuss cost containment in healthcare. \\"We would go into a community and get key people together. In Des Moines we got together the Des Moines Register, a union, and some local businesspeople and we conducted a study about what was going on in healthcare. In Utah it was the Mormon Church [sic], a key senator, and the governor who all came together. We would go into these communities and bring all these people together and get them to look at the healthcare situation. Only foundation money could bring these people together. Inevitably, these activities led to an initiative of some kind and, often, the creation of an HMO.\\" = Special grants = The foundation has made rare special grants, including grants in response to the 911 terrorist events, and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The grants have often focused on better disaster preparation and relief policies for institutionalized older adults.Hyer K, Brown LM, Polivka-West L, Berman A. Helping nursing homes prepare for disasters. Health Affairs (Millwood). 2010;29(10):1961-5. doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0665 = Grantee communication = Beginning in 2006, the foundation has made efforts to communicate with its grantees and other stakeholders, sponsoring grantee perception surveys by the Center for Effective Philanthropy and released in part to the public. (A 2010 Grantee Perception Report is not currently publicly available.) It has circulated an e-newsletter to its stakeholder community since at least 2004, and has launched an online blog, Health AGEnda.  Governance  The foundation, like most large U.S. charitable foundations, has no set closure date. Although not directly related by mission or program activities, in 1983 the Hartford Family Foundation was established in the State of New Jersey to preserve \\"the memory of the late George Huntington Hartford and the company he founded in 1859.\\" = Investments = The foundation solicits no new donations, and invests the assets that it has not yet distributed to maximize the return on investment. Unsolicited donations or estate gifts are deposited into the foundation's core accounts, while larger donations are earmarked and targeted for projects mutually agreeable to the foundation and the donor(s). = Awards and honors = The foundation's grantees are often recognized with prestigious awards and honors‚Äîincluding multiple MacArthur Fellow (\\"genius\\") grants The foundation itself has won recognition; for example, in 2011 the foundation received the Community College of Philadelphia's Foundation Keystone Award for its work on the needs of older adults in community college nursing programs. = Criticism = The foundation's genesis as an offspring of the A&P; supermarket fortune, and its consequent stockholding ties with the A&P; during the chain's marketplace decline in the 1960s and '70s, proved almost disastrous to the solvency of the foundation. At several points grantmaking was placed on hiatus. In 1969 the foundation attracted attention of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee during hearings about the tax treatment of foundations with substantial financial links to corporations. Huntington Hartford, John and George Hartford's nephew and never a part of the foundation's governance structure, was highly critical of this lingering financial relationship.Hartford, H. (1967) Why the A&P; doesn't care. October, Show magazine A period of A&P; stock divestiture ensued and the foundation returned to financial stability by the late 1970s.

Due to multiple fires, the structure has been both a live performance venue and a movie theater. Since 2002, the theatre has hosted regular performances of a variety of shows, primarily music revues.  History  The Savannah Theatre opened its doors at 5:30pm on December 4, 1818 with a performance of \\"The Soldier's Daughter\\". The original structure was designed by British architect William Jay, whose other notable works include the Telfair Mansion and the Owens-Thomas House, both located in Savannah. During the 1850s and 1860s, it was sometimes known as the Athenaeum. On March 21, 1861, Alexander H. Stephens delivered the Cornerstone Speech at the theatre. The image here is the 1906 remodel which resulted in a new brick facade, with cast terra cotta panels. Many of the windows were filled in The original structure suffered severe damage due to a hurricane that hit Savannah on August 31, 1898, tearing sections of the roof off the building and flooding the auditorium.The Morning Herald, September 1, 1898, \\"Havoc In Savannah\\", Baltimore Additionally, the Theatre has undergone two notable structural overhauls as the result of fires in 1906Boston Evening Transcript, September 22, 1906, \\"Savannah Theatre Burns\\" and 1948.St. Petersburg Times, January 13, 1948, \\"Fire Damages Famed Theatre In Savannah\\" Following the 1948 fire, the building was transformed to its current Art Deco style.  Notable players  The College Widow featuring Ty Cobb from The Savannah Press, 1911 Over the past two centuries, the Savannah Theatre has showcased an array of talented performers, including Fanny Davenport, E. H. Sothern, Julia Marlowe, Otis Skinner, Oscar Wilde Sarah Bernhardt, W. C. Fields, Tyrone Power, and Lillian Russell. Edwin Booth played several engagements at the Theatre in February 1876, with Shakespearean roles including Hamlet, Iago, and King Lear.Arthur W. Bloom, Edwin Booth: A Biography and Performance History, McFarland, 2013, Page XVIII, It is unknown as to whether or not Edwin's younger brother John Wilkes Booth ever performed at the Savannah Theatre. In 1851, the New York Dramatic Company leased the Theatre briefly. Among the players was Joseph Jefferson, whose most well-known role was that of Washington Irving's \\"Rip Van Winkle\\". However the company's stand failed to succeed, as their \\"lineup of standard hits failed to tempt Savannah audiences.\\" One of the more memorable performances in the Theatre's history came in November 1911, when baseball great Ty Cobb appeared in The College Widow.The Savannah Press, November 11, 1911, Advertisement  The theatre today  Savannah Theatre in 2017 Beginning in 2002 with the music revue \\"Lost in the \`50s\\", the Theatre has housed live performances of several productions.

The work is located near the north fork of Paint Creek. It was described, in 1848, as \\"one of the largest and most interesting in the Scioto valley.\\" History and location The site is located on the north fork of Paint Creek. In the mid-19th century, it was located on the property of W.C. Clark, hence the other name - \\"Clark's Work\\". The site dates back to the late Prehistoric period. Excavation history =Visit to the site by Squier and Davis in mid-19th century= The site was visited by Ephraim George Squier and Edwin Hamilton Davis in the mid 19th-century. They wrote about the site in their 1848 book, Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley. Squier and Davis believed that the site was used as a fortification. Within the main work are multiple smaller works, which they believed were of religious significance. It was described as being shaped like a parallelogram at 2800 feet by 1800 feet, with \\"corners somewhat rounded.\\" The creekside section of the work has a four feet tall wall, which runs alongside the bank. An exterior ditch traces the wall, which raises in height to six feet by 35 feet at the base. The ditch that follows matches the dimensions. During their visit, they noted that where the ravine had deepened over time, the ditch had washed away. The site encloses 111 acres of land. Inside of the work are two smaller works: a perfect circle at 350 feet in diameter and a semi-circle that is 2,000 feet in circumference. The semi- circle has seven mounds within it. Three are connected to each other, totaling 30 feet high, 500 feet long, and 180 feet wide. To the right of the work is a smaller work covering 16 acres. It's a square shape, totaling 850 feet in size. Each side has an entrance in the center of it. Each entrance is 30 feet wide. Each gate has a small mound that accompanies it, and there are two other entrances on two outer corners, without mound accompaniment. There is no ditch around the smaller square work. Additional mounds are located throughout the area. One area of the main fortification was broken down, creating a gully which flowed with water from a nearby spring. Based on their excavations, the stated that \\"nearly all mounds examined were places of sacrifice, containing altars,\\". They also confirmed that the site was also used as a fort. Squier and Davis stated that the amount of labor required to build the works was \\"immense,\\" and that the embankments total three miles in length with approximately three million cubic feet of soil being used to build it. =20th-century= A 1981 paper, Faunal Remains from the Howard Baum Site, Ross County, Ohio, discusses the finding of 1,522 animal remains discovered in the groundmass at the site.

Coruzzi (born June 28, 1954) is an American molecular biologist specializing in plant systems biology and evolutionary genomics.  Education and career  As Carroll & Milton Petrie Professor of Biology at New York University‚Äôs Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, Coruzzi studies gene regulatory networks controlling nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and root nutrient foraging in the model plant Arabidopsis. She also examines phylogenomic approaches across higher plant species to identify genes associated with the evolution of key plant traits such as seeds. This research resides in Pasteur's quadrant as a scientific investigation that is ultimately meant to be beneficial to society.Stokes, D. E. Pasteur's Quadrant ‚Äì Basic Science and Technological Innovation. Brookings Institution Press, 1997.

It was released on 7 October 2013 in the UK, with a US release the following day. The record stalled at #26 on the UK Albums Chart, marking a significant decline in popularity for the band whose first two albums went Top 5, and dropped out of the Top 100 altogether after just one week. Chart performance The album peaked at number 26 in their native UK album chart, significantly lower than their previous two albums, which had both peaked in the Top 5, it was a minor number 53 in Japan, and peaked at number 106 in the US compared with number 80 with previous album Here We Stand.

Heather Phares in Allmusic wrote: \\"While a few songs wander too close to lunkheaded bar rock, We Need Medicine reveals a surprising amount of vitality and growth for a band that spent nearly half a decade apart. Not only is it a welcome return, it‚Äôs one of The Fratellis‚Äô most consistently engaging albums.\\" In his review for PopMatters, Charles Pitter said: \\"The music is thorough, raucously ragged, and the lyrics forceful‚Ä¶ The Fratellis are quirky, and you almost have to accept that not everything will work to get to the moments of genius.\\" Mojo, in a mildly positive review, described the record as 'simple and uncomplicated' but 'fundamentally predictable'. John D. Luerssen of Rolling Stone lauded the album's first two singles, \\"Seven Nights, Seven Days\\" and \\"This Old Ghost Town\\". Conversely, the record was battered by Alan Ashton- Smith in musicOMH, who wrote: \\"The Fratellis certainly sound like a more mature band now: the problem is that rather than sounding like a group who have grown to maturity, they sound like the kind of mature band that have reformed to plod their way around the stadium and festival circuit once they‚Äôve reached the wrong side of middle age‚Ä¶ if this is a band that needs medicine then what they ought to be prescribed is medicine for the soul.\\" Paul Faller, in a scathing review for Drowned in Sound, suggested that the band retire after completing any associated live shows. He opined: \\"You can look at this album in two ways‚Äîit‚Äôs completely inessential at best, or a cynical cash- grab at worst. It‚Äôll be enough to keep The Fratellis ticking over with tours and festival appearances for at least a little while, but We Need Medicine is no Panacea‚Äîand once it has run its course, it seems like it‚Äôd be more humane for the members of The Fratellis to just let the band die in peace.\\" The Soul Crush EP After their tour in support of We Need Medicine the band released a free EP via their website called The Soul Crush EP which consisted of three new songs. The EP has never been commercially released and is no longer available to download via the band's website. References External links *Need Medicine at Metacritic *We Need Medicine at AnyDecentMusic?

It ended in the victory of the Mongol forces, who captured the city and burned it, massacring the residents. During the Mongol invasion of Poland, southeastern Polish city of Sandomierz was regarded by the invaders as a strategically important location, which had to be captured. Sandomierz lies near the confluence of the Vistula and the San rivers, near the 13th-century border between the Kingdom of Poland and Mongol-controlled Red Ruthenia. The invaders captured Sandomierz on 13 February 1241, after crossing the frozen Vistula. According to Jan D≈Çugosz, forces of the khan besieged both the city, and the castle. After breaking defences, they murdered the Abbot of Koprzywnica, and all monks from Koprzywnica's Abbey, who had fled to the city. A great number of residents of the area was massacred, and the invaders saved only young men, whom they enslaved. During the siege, the Mongols used specially designed engines, especially stone throwing machines, which threw rocks weighing over 100 kilograms. The city was captured after four days, and after the sack, Mongol forces headed westwards, to Wi≈õlica and Skalbmierz. On the day of the capture of Sandomierz, the Battle of Tursko took place. In 1259‚Äì1260, the Mongols sieged and captured Sandomierz again, razing the city and massacring its residents.

We know more about him than we do about any of his colleagues, and from the surviving information we can form some idea of the lifestyle of an Irish judge in his time. He sat in turn in each of the Irish Courts of common law, and uniquely, he is known to have appeared in Court as an advocate even after he became a judge. Early career Grantchester, present day - view of the River Cam He was a native of Grantchester in Cambridgeshire: his surname is an early form of the town's name (which appears as Grauntsethe in Domesday Book). He seems to have been in practice as a lawyer by 1300 and in 1302 was nominated by the Bishop of ElyThe Bishop was either Ralph Walpole, who died in March 1302, or his successor Robert Orford. to be his attorney.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol. 1 p.68 He came to Dublin in about 1308. He married Alice de Morton, daughter and co-heiress of Geoffrey de Morton, who was Lord Mayor of Dublin and one of the city's wealthiest shipowners and his wife Maud de Bree: they had no children.Ball p.27 He acquired a house abutting the city wall, close to old Dublin Bridge, now Father Mathew Bridge; he later completed two small towers, one at each end of the bridge, and began the building of a chapel there. He also owned property in Castle Street in Dublin city centre, and at Oxmantown to the north of Dublin city. His property by the bridge included the Dublin \\"fish-house\\", for the upkeep of which he was responsible. He was given a licence to pierce the city wall, in order to provide his house with sufficient light. He continued to practice law, and was acting as legal adviser to the owner of Rathfarnham Castle in 1320. In 1326 he was made second Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) and in the following year he was transferred to the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland).Ball p.28 Judge and advocate? His career suffered a serious reverse due to a curious episode in 1329 when the former Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, Walter de Islip, was engaged in litigation with one William de London.Ball p.29 Grauntsete appeared as advocate for de London: his conduct in appearing as an advocate after his appointment to the Bench is unique in the history of the common law.Cohen, Herman History of the English Bar to 1450 1929 Sweet and Maxwell, 2005 reprint p.272 He then proceeded to offend the judges by reading out letters of excommunication from the Papal Court. He was charged with attempting to subvert the Royal authority in favour of that of the Pope, deprived of office, imprisoned and fined.Ball pp.28-9 King Edward III however soon granted him a royal pardon and he was restored to office. Later career Edward III clearly thought well of him, and invited him to England twice to discuss Irish affairs. In 1331 he was transferred to the Court of King's Bench (Ireland). About that time he became custodian of Leixlip Castle, with the right of possession of the manor and its fishery. Technically for a serving judge to acquire property was an offence, for which transgression John obtained another royal pardon.Ball p.29 He was a noted benefactor of the Priory of Holy Trinity, now Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin. After his wife's death in about 1335 the Prior of Holy Trinity ordained that two canons of the Priory would pray for his health, and one after his death would pray for the souls of himself and his wife.Ball p.30 Grauntsete obtained a licence to erect a chapel in St. Michan's Church, and also to build St. Mary's Chapel on Dublin Bridge itself.National Archives SC 8/264/12164 He was also a benefactor of the Order of the Hospitallers at Kilmainham Priory, and it was at Kilmainham that he spent his later years.

The type species Mandagomphodon hirschsoni was named by Crompton in 1972 as a species referable to Scalenodon. Later studies, including a 2003 phylogenetic analysis of traversodontid relationships, did not find the species of Scalenodon from the Manda Formation to form a single clade, meaning that many were not referable to the genus. The study suggested that S. hirschsoni had more in common with other traversodontids like Luangwa. S. attridgei was viewed as a possible synonym of S. charigi, which was also found to be only distantly related to S. angustifrons. Therefore, a new generic name Mandagomphodon was erected for S. hirschsoni by James A. Hopson in 2013.

The ' (English: Welsh National College), known in both Welsh and English simply as Coleg', was established in 2011 by the Welsh Government to work with universities in Wales in order to develop Welsh-language courses and resources for students; it also provides and advances Welsh medium courses, scholarship and research in Welsh universities. Although headquartered in Carmarthen, the Coleg does not have its own campus, but works through a number of branches across universities in Wales. It is a recognised charity. The aim of the branches is to support the Coleg's work and act as a point of contact for students. The Chief Executive is Dr Ioan Matthews and the chair is Andrew Green. All universities in Wales teach courses in Welsh; Aberystwyth, Cardiff, Bangor and Swansea universities have had chairs in Welsh since their establishment, and all their schools of Welsh are successful centres for the study of the Welsh language and its literature, offering a BA in Welsh as well as post-graduate courses. Following a commitment made in the One Wales coalition government between Labour and Plaid Cymru, the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol was established. Since 2011, the Coleg has funded 115 lecturers who teach through the medium of Welsh in subjects ranging from Law, Modern Languages, Social Sciences and also other sciences such as Biosciences. There is also a Welsh-medium academic journal called Gwerddon which is a platform for academic research in Welsh and is published quarterly. The choice of Welsh-medium courses has grown significantly over recent years, There are currently (July 2013) over 500 different degrees available to Welsh-medium students, along with 150 undergraduate scholarships which are awarded to students each year. This is the first time any organisation has planned Welsh- medium provision nationally for students. By working with all universities in Wales, the Coleg aims to strengthen existing courses and develop new degrees in new locations and disciplines across the country. In April 2014, Coleg announced that it had appointed Marc Haynes as its Wikipedian in Residence. Gwerddon Gwerddon is an academic e-journal which publishes scholarly research in the Arts, the Humanities and the Sciences twice a year and which conforms to the guidelines of the 2014 Research Excellence Framework. The journal tries to stimulate and encourage first-class academic discussion across as wide a range of subjects as possible through the medium of Welsh and thereby to create a store of material for the use of research students and academics. The first edition was published in April 2007, and it has been an extremely important development in terms of ensuring that more and more Welsh medium academic research material is now published. Professor Ioan Williams is the editor of Gwerddon. Y Porth The Porth learning platform allows universities to share Welsh-medium resources across Wales. Students are able to access a number of new resources, including: * Open content resources which include a series of subject dictionaries for students * Courses and modules which are relevant to specific degrees from Education to Biological Sciences * A web gallery which contains relevant websites of interest to students who are studying subjects through the medium of Welsh * Videos which provide information about specific areas. iTunes U This is a special site for Welsh-medium students which offers courses and resources which can be downloaded to iPads, PCs and Mac computers through iTunes. Scholarships Each year, the Coleg awards around 150 scholarships to undergraduate students who will be following degree courses in universities across Wales of which there are two types of scholarship ‚Äì Lead Scholarships and Incentive Scholarships. The Lead Scholarships are for students who are studying at least two thirds of their degree course through the medium of Welsh. These are worth ¬£3,000 over three years (¬£1,000 a year). Nearly 300 different degree courses now contain enough Welsh-medium provision to be eligible for the Lead Scholarships. Incentive Scholarships are available to students who intend to study a particular degree course in one of the ten following academic areas: Geography, Biology and Environmental Science, Business and Management, Social Work, Sports Sciences and Studies, Law, Health Sciences, Modern Languages, Mathematics, Physics, Psychology and Chemistry. These scholarships offer ¬£500 a year (or ¬£1,500 over three years) for studying at least a third of the degree course through the medium of Welsh.

Principal requirements * Public water systems (PWS) must conduct source water monitoring for cryptosporidium * Filtration systems for PWS with the highest levels of cryptosporidium * All unfiltered systems must inactivate cryptosporidium using disinfection technologies such as ozone, ultraviolet light, or chlorine dioxide. Controversy The LT2 rule was criticized for mandating costly public works projects (such as coverage of open-air reservoirs) that may be unnecessary and/or unlikely to address the kind of problem that was responsible for the Milwaukee incident. William R. MacKenzie, M.D., a Centers for Disease Control epidemiologist who served as the Epidemic Intelligence Officer on the Milwaukee case, stated, \\"Standards for water treatment facilities were about to be implemented throughout the nation; but even those would not have stopped the Milwaukee outbreak.\\" Review of regulatory requirements In response to criticism that the rule unfairly burdens public water systems that are not exposed to municipal sewage, EPA conducted three public meetings in 2011 and 2012 about the LT2 rule, and invited the public to submit information and data to support future regulatory decisions. In a 2017 Federal Register notice, EPA stated that it \\"did not identify new information related to potentially revising\\" the regulatory requirements for cryptosporidium and other listed pathogens, and requested additional public comments.EPA (2017-01-11). \\"National Primary Drinking Water Regulations; Announcement of the Results of EPA's Review of Existing Drinking Water Standards and Request for Public Comment and/or Information on Related Issues.\\" References Category:2006 in the environment Category:Water supply and sanitation in the United States Category:Drinking water regulation ","title":"Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule"},{"id":"40105191","text":"Title-page of the Aeneid of Vergil, translated into French by Louis des Masures, published by Jean de Tournes in 1552 Jean de Tournes (1504 ‚Äì 1564) was a French printer, book publisher and bookseller, and the founder of a long-lasting family printing business.

It casts the player as a security professional, whose goal is to infiltrate the mansion headquarters of a safe manufacturer and break into 35 of its unusual models. Each safe is guarded by a different type of puzzle, including sliding tiles, anagram codes and translations from braille. The player's progression is nonlinear: the mansion can be explored, and its safes unlocked, in multiple orders. However, the game must be completed within a 12-hour time limit. Safecracker was conceived in 1994 as the debut title by Daydream, one of Sweden's first major computer game developers. After signing with Warner Interactive Entertainment (WIE) in 1995, Daydream began to develop the game with Macromedia Director and QuickTime VR. Expensive Silicon Graphics machines were purchased with Warner's funding to create the visuals; musicians Rob 'n' Raz were hired to compose the soundtrack. However, corporate upheaval at WIE led to costly delays. GT Interactive ultimately bought the publisher in 1996 and purposely slow-walked Safecrackers release and promotion. Having anticipated problems with GT, Daydream went public: its hit IPO drew enough capital for the team to repurchase Safecrackers rights in 1997 and sign new distributors worldwide. While Safecrackers troubled release hurt its retail performance, long-tail sales at a budget price eventually carried it to 650,000 units sold. Reviewers broadly panned the game's limited core premise, although certain writers considered it a strength and recommended the title to fans of puzzle games. Critical reception of the puzzles and visuals ranged from positive to strongly negative. Following the launch of Safecracker, Daydream became a foundational company in the Swedish game industry. Nevertheless, problems caused by its early public launch led to the developer's bankruptcy in 2003. Kheops Studio and The Adventure Company later released a spiritual successor to Safecracker under the name Safecracker: The Ultimate Puzzle Adventure (2006).  Gameplay and plot  heads-up display (HUD) interface surrounds the play window; the inventory appears at the bottom. Safecracker is a puzzle adventure game that takes place from a first-person view in a pre-rendered visual environment. The player uses a point-and-click interface to traverse the game world and interact with objects. In a manner that has been compared to Zork Nemesis, the player's movement is restricted to jumps between panoramic static screens. The camera view can rotate 360¬∞ on each screen. In Safecracker, the player assumes the role of a professional in the security systems business, who seeks a job with the fictional Crabb & Sons Company. The firm is a manufacturer of safes with unusual designs. As an audition, the player character is contracted by Crabb & Sons' owner to infiltrate his mansion headquarters and crack the safes within, with the ultimate goal of breaking into the new \\"F-9-12\\" design. The game begins outside Crabb & Sons' building, after which the player sneaks in and begins to explore. Safecracker features nonlinear progression: the mansion's rooms can be navigated, and their safes tackled, in multiple orders. However, the game must be beaten under a 12-hour time limit. The mansion contains over 50 rooms and 35 safes, which are guarded by puzzles in a range of styles. Among these are mathematics puzzles, anagram codes, conversions of temperature units, translations from braille, musical problems and sliding puzzles. Unlocking a safe provides the player with clues and keys, which open up new areas and allow other puzzles to be solved. At the same time, certain clues are hidden around the mansion in books and other objects that the player may investigate. Clue items are stored in the inventory on the heads-up display (HUD) interface, which also features a meter that tracks the number of puzzles solved.  Development  =Origins= Mastermind was an early influence on Safecracker. Safecracker was conceived in 1994 by acquaintances J√∂rgen Isaksson and Nigel Papworth of Ume√•, Sweden. Papworth's interest in making games was first sparked when Isaksson showed him Myst: its simple HyperCard engine suggested to Papworth that game programming could be easy. Isaksson himself had previously experimented with the medium to entertain his younger sister, yielding a computer conversion of the board game Mastermind. Papworth seized on this idea and reworked Isaksson's Mastermind board into a safe puzzle. After a short time, the pair had devised five more safes in this style, and the thought arose for an entire game about cracking safes in a single building. This concepting stage began in summer 1994. Isaksson and Papworth soon pitched the Safecracker idea to Erik Phersson and Jan Phersson- Broburg, the heads of a local computer services company, Sombrero, that Isaksson had co-founded. The more recent hire Leif Holm was present as well. At a meeting in fall 1994, roughly one month after Isaksson had shown Myst to Papworth, the five men resolved to create Safecracker together. The Phersson brothers had already been anxious to expand into new fields. Phersson-Broburg immediately arranged an interview with Sanji Tandan, the head of Warner Music Sweden, based on the logic that the publisher had a worldwide foothold in the CD business. The first contact with Warner occurred in October 1994. However, the Safecracker team initially lacked any materials to sell Tandan on the game. Papworth, a professional illustrator, wrote that he hurriedly \\"made 2 pretty crude visuals with colored felt tips on an A1 sketch pad that showed a start sequence and some examples of different safe puzzles\\". Phersson-Broburg composed a financial roadmap for the project, while Isaksson cooperated with Papworth to construct the game's plot. The team used StrataVision 3D to create a test of Safecrackers pre-rendered graphics. Tandan enjoyed their presentation and the meeting was a success. Based on this event, the five team members founded Daydream Software in November 1994. Nevertheless, Daydream's handshake deal with the publisher fell through. Tandan reported back that the rest of Warner Music Sweden was uninterested in pursuing computer games. Shortly thereafter, the Safecracker plan was revived during the 1994 Christmas party at Daydream's new office space. The team was called by the London-based Warner Interactive Entertainment, whose executive Laurence Scotford expressed interest in the game and soon flew to Ume√• to learn more. The team then traveled to the publisher's London headquarters and pitched Safecracker directly. A writer for the city of Ume√• later remarked that it was \\"a tricky display with cumbersome computers\\", but the parties reached a tentative agreement to partner on the game. Afterward, the contract was carefully tweaked at Daydream's offices. The developer signed with Warner to develop Safecracker in March 1995, as part of a three-year, multi-title deal set to run until March 1998. Funding was provided via an advance against royalties of 2.5 million kr; Daydream was set to earn 50 kr per unit sold, while Warner retained all revenues for the first 50,000 sales of the game. In retrospect, Papworth felt that Daydream was \\"lucky\\" to have joined the game industry when it did, as many of \\"the big record companies\\" were entering the computer game business with low standards as to the content they financed. =Production= Daydream Software began development of Safecracker by creating thorough blueprints of the mansion and its rooms on paper. Objects inside the building were similarly drawn on paper ahead of the modeling stage. Nigel Papworth wrote that he \\"raided the local bookshops and bought up all the books [he] could find on antique furniture and Victoriana\\" for inspiration. The plan was to build the game's visual assets on Macintosh computers with Strata StudioPro after the concepting phase. However, Daydream soon deduced that the agreed- upon budget and deadline for Safecracker were unworkable with the developer's existing personnel and technology, according to Papworth. Hoping to speed up production, J√∂rgen Isaksson suggested that the team develop Safecrackers graphics on expensive Silicon Graphics workstations instead. Daydream felt that these machines and their software \\"offered an unbeatable combination of speed, quality in modeling and rendering\\". The company persuaded Warner Interactive Entertainment to pay $50,000 for three workstations and a server, which made Daydream one of Sweden's top three buyers of Silicon Graphics computers. As a result, the graphics-production setup for Safecracker consisted of SGI Indy machines, for modeling the visuals, and a single SGI Challenge server. All of them were used for rendering. For Safecrackers design, the team adopted a nonlinear approach because they were \\"allergic\\" to linear gameplay, Papworth later said. While researching adventure games in preparation, Papworth catalogued his dislikes with the genre and shaped Safecracker accordingly. This resulted in a scheme to make the basement and first floor fully traversable from the start, and the second floor unlockable after a relatively short time. In this way, Papworth noted, \\"Only the end task would be dependent on most of the clues having been already solved\\", which prevented Safecracker from becoming a series of roadblocks. Nonlinearity proved to be a challenge for both the designers and programmers. In an attempt to prevent the open structure from confusing players, the team included \\"exact instructions and advice\\" in the starting sequence, Papworth explained. Papworth used each room's theme to determine the design of its puzzles: for example, the music room contains a jukebox-inspired safe. He recalled creating roughly \\"80% of the safe designs in the first 3‚Äì4 weeks\\" of production; the rest were handled by other team members at later times. stitching together 12 still images of each room in QuickTime VR. Safecracker was developed primarily on Macintosh hardware with Macromedia Director and QuickTime VR. The latter software, which displays virtual-reality panoramas, had not yet been used for many games. It was one of the selling points in the Warner Interactive deal: Papworth remarked that the team hoped to \\"be the first developer to use [3D rotating panoramas] in a full sized game.\\" Daydream worked initially with a beta edition, as QuickTime VR was not launched until July 1995. To create Safecrackers visuals, Daydream used its Silicon Graphics computers to build wire-frame 3D models with programs from Alias Wavefront, including PowerAnimator. Each modeler consulted a collective to-do list, from which he would \\"pick an object ... and write his name beside it\\", according to Papworth. This list cited the relevant reference pages in Papworth's books. Texture maps were drawn on Macintosh computers with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Once a textured environment was lit, the team inserted a camera to render 12 images in a 360¬∞ radius, and the results were image-stitched into a rotatable panorama with QuickTime VR. During production, Daydream legally had zero employees, and instead hired Sombrero staff and outside freelancers on a contractual basis. Team members assumed multiple roles. Leif Holm and the new hire Fredrik Jonsson modeled environments and furniture; Holm simultaneously managed aspects of Unix programming. Papworth, alongside his other jobs, textured environments and arranged objects inside them. Isaksson modeled and coded, but also compiled the team's visual assets into QuickTime VR and Macromedia Director, in which they were made playable and interactive. Sound effects, handled with Digital Audio Tapes and Macromedia's SoundEdit, were overseen by Erik Phersson. Papworth recalled that Daydream \\"purchased about 100 sound effect CDs\\" to assist him. Hoping to increase the soundtrack's quality by hiring professionals, Daydream contracted Swedish artists Rob 'n' Raz to create a unique musical theme for every room in Safecracker. This deal caused issues with STIM and the Nordisk Copyright Bureau regarding Rob 'n' Raz's rates, as there were no guidelines for computer software scores. Near the end of development, Daydream similarly contracted the firm Datadesign & Multimedia AB for coding assistance. =Delays and public offering= As Safecrackers production progressed, instability at Warner Interactive Entertainment became a major concern for Daydream Software. These issues resulted in costly delays. The team finished \\"a basic build of Safecracker in less than a year\\", according to Nigel Papworth, and the game was nearing completion by the first part of 1996. However, around that time, Warner informed Daydream that it wanted the game localized in eight languages, even though the original contract had only accounted for English. This pushed the completion date back four months: the game's pre-rendered visuals contained writing in English and had to be deconstructed and re-rendered in other languages. Laurence Scotford was moved off Safecracker thanks to corporate restructuring; meanwhile, Warner Interactive Entertainment's sister branch Time Warner Interactive was sold to WMS Gaming in April 1996. Warner demonstrated Safecrackers progress at the spring European Computer Trade Show (ECTS) that month, by which time it was on track for July. Inscape, a Warner affiliate that served as the game's North American distributor, subsequently showed Safecracker at the 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). In July 1996, Time Warner signaled plans to exit the game industry entirely, after its moves earlier in the year. Daydream learned that Warner Interactive Entertainment was being sold to GT Interactive around the time that the localizations for Safecracker were almost finished. By September 1996, talks of the buyout effort had become public at the fall ECTS. A writer for the city of Ume√• noted that Daydream had \\"an uneasy feeling\\" about the deal, partly because GT Interactive was known for shooter games antithetical to Safecrackers nonviolent ethos. In addition, Papworth recalled his negative impression of a leading GT executive, whom he later dubbed \\"the most arrogant and unpleasant individual whom we had stumbled across in [the] industry\\". Before Warner's sale was completed, Daydream began to explore alternative business strategies to offer the team greater flexibility. The developer sought to increase its economic and decision-making independence compared to traditional publishing arrangements, and, for future projects, to select publishers nearer to the end of development. In particular, Jan Phersson- Broberg wrote that Daydream wanted to secure partners that were \\"strong at the time of launch.\\" Daydream Software was among Sweden's earliest major computer game companies, and was the only game developer in Ume√• (pictured) by 1996. Daydream struggled to find investors in Sweden. The country's game industry was small: Daydream itself was \\"one of Sweden's first international developers\\", according to a writer for the city of Ume√•. It was the only development house in the city. Attempts to obtain money from banks were unsuccessful, as they were indifferent to Safecracker and did not see computer games as valuable in comparison to staple industries like lumber. Phersson- Broberg noted that Swedish venture capitalists were similarly uninterested in his business, thanks to the long-term returns on investment that Daydream promised. This problem ultimately led Daydream to attempt an initial public offering (IPO), after the brokerage firm Matteus Corporate Finance approached the developer and assessed its worth as 40 million kr. Phersson-Broberg called the plan dangerous and \\"probably the last thing you choose as a young company\\". However, he argued that self-financing Daydream's future games with money from Swedish shareholders would provide more stability, adaptability and room for growth. In November 1996, Daydream bought Sombrero to incorporate the team into a single business. GT Interactive announced its purchase of Warner Interactive Entertainment on November 25, and Daydream released its IPO prospectus to potential investors on the 26th. According to the plan, the company was not expected to reach profitability for more than three years. Safecracker had been in development for roughly one-and-a-half years by that time, and was set to launch around the turn of 1997. Papworth's work on the game concluded in November, and he started to explore possibilities for Daydream's next title. A large amount of media attention began to surround Daydream's IPO. The team hosted regular meetings with Swedish and international investors at Stockholm's Sturehof restaurant, where they demonstrated Safecracker on large displays. In early December 1996, during the run-up to the public offering, Safecracker won the \\"Best Entertainment Title\\" and \\"Overall People's Choice\\" prizes at the Macromedia European Users Conference. Later that month, Daydream sold 2.6 million shares‚Äîroughly 45.5% of the company‚Äîto Matteus Corporate Finance at 7.65 kr each. This raised 20 million kr. Matteus's role as the subscriber was to sell these shares to the wider public, with a starting price of 8.35 kr per share. Daydream opened on the Stockholm Stock Exchange's Stockholm B√∂rsinformation (SBI) list on January 16, 1997. Its launch was an immediate hit: the company's share price ended the first day at 29 kr. Stocks quickly rose to 48 kr, and ultimately stabilized around 58 kr. Buyers included Berth Milton and Bj√∂rn Nordstrand. The Wall Street Journal reported that Daydream became \\"the darling of the country's stock market\\"; its IPO achieved a 25-time oversubscription, Matteus's biggest success by that date. Soon after the launch, P√•l Leveraas of Norway's Digi.no wrote, \\"With nothing but a new, self-developed computer game in the portfolio, the five [founders] have already become multi-millionaires.\\" A writer for the city of Ume√• similarly noted that \\"Daydream didn't even have a game on the market, let alone any revenue.\\" Meanwhile, Safecracker began to encounter problems with GT Interactive. Daydream told investors that the new publisher was set to honor Warner's agreements on the project, and that the team viewed the situation as \\"very positive\\". However, GT Interactive delayed Safecracker past its due date of January 1997 to redesign its physical packaging‚Äîinitially to late March and finally to May. Release and distribution Safecracker was first released in Sweden in the middle of May 1997. Later that month and in early June, it received follow-up launches in 14 other territories across Europe and South America. Despite significant pre-release coverage, Safecrackers many delays meant that the \\"momentum for the game ... could not be exploited\\", according to the academic researchers Ola Henfridsson, Helena Holmstr√∂m and Ole Hanseth. It accrued sales of 18,000 units in its first two weeks. Jan Phersson-Broberg later told investors that GT Interactive failed to support Safecracker at retail. He reported that the publisher \\"did not advertise, [and] did not place interviews, reviews\\" or other press relations material for the game, and that he received silence when Daydream Software sought an explanation. Behind the scenes, according to the Wall Street Journal, the project had \\"ended up on the 'let-die' pile\\" at GT Interactive. Global sales of Safecracker reached 22,000 units by the start of autumn, before its launch in the Australian and North American markets. It remained unreleased in the latter region by late 1997. Nigel Papworth noted that North America was \\"seen as the paramount market to crack\\" for international developers; its buying power was equivalent to the rest of the world's combined. Reacting to these delays, Daydream publicly reported trouble with GT Interactive Europe in late 1997, and questioned the publisher's competence with and interest in Safecracker. Next Generation quoted the team's statement that it was \\"increasingly frustrated over the lack of marketing and the stalling of a North American release\\". In September 1997, Daydream initiated a plan to repurchase all rights to Safecracker, a move enabled by the developer's independent financing from shareholders. The buyout was executed on November 27. It cost roughly 1.4 million kr, compared to the 2.2 million kr that Daydream owed its publisher for the Warner Interactive advance. The money spent to purchase Safecracker counted toward repayment of the advance, which had been set to bankrupt Daydream. In place of the GT Interactive contract, Daydream hired the talent agency Octagon Entertainment, a firm also involved with Fable and Starship Titanic. Octagon's job was to sign local distribution partners in Asia, Europe, Australia and North America for Safecracker. Phersson-Broberg told investors that partnering with regional companies, each of which understood its respective market, enabled the developer to \\"spread [its] eggs in more baskets\\". This strategy was intended to raise Safecrackers chances of becoming a hit. Daydream offloaded marketing and unit production to each distributor, which Phersson-Broberg said would allow the company to \\"focus solely on developing more good computer games.\\" The developer forecast that the repayment of its advance, combined with its full ownership of the game, would hasten Safecrackers breaking even. As part of the buyback deal with GT Interactive, Daydream recalled around 7,500 unsold copies of the game's original release to storage. The developer proceeded to resell these to new distributors at prices ranging from 80 to 180 kr. Safecrackers Macintosh version launched in Sweden in December 1997. DreamCatcher Interactive brought Safecracker to large North American retailers such as Best Buy. By March 1998, Safecrackers display at the Milia festival in Cannes had secured it new distribution agreements in nine countries, including Germany, France, Australia and‚Äîwith publisher PXL Computers‚ÄîCanada and the United States. Daydream signed with Ahead Multimedia in June 1998 to re-release the game in Sweden, attracted by the publisher's penetration of unusual storefronts such as post offices and gas stations. In markets where GT Interactive had previously launched Safecracker, the game was sold at a lower price. Phersson- Broberg promised investors greater earnings from North America, as it was a new market for the game. Safecracker had reappeared in certain countries by the end of May 1998; revenue on each unit ranged between 30 and 130 kr at the time. Despite PXL Computers' release of the game, Papworth reported in 1999 that Safecracker had underperformed in North America. He felt that its tumultuous history had prevented it from receiving \\"the crack it deserve[d] at the American Market\\". Safecrackers global sales totaled 65,000 units by January 1999, for revenues of 3.2 million kr. This performance amounted to a lifetime loss of 500,000 kr. Sales had risen to roughly 70,000 units the following month, at which point the game's development costs were fully capitalized. Although Safecracker had become a budget game by that time, Daydream told investors that its revenues remained \\"at the same level as when the product was launched and sold as a full-cost product.\\" Conversely, the company reported later in 1999 the game's lower price point had decreased its earnings. Safecracker sold roughly 200,000 units by May 30 and 235,000 by September 30. By April 2000, European and Asian markets alone had accounted for 250,000 sales. In spring 2000, Safecracker received a second launch in North America through DreamCatcher Interactive, the distributor for Daydream's Traitors Gate in the region. This deal offered Safecracker access to mainstream retailers such as Best Buy, Babbage's and CompUSA, at around 1,600 locations throughout the territory. It became successful for DreamCatcher. The game's worldwide sales reached approximately 275,000 copies by the end of May 2000 and 300,000 copies by mid-2001. In the 2010s, a writer for the city of Ume√• retrospectively judged Safecracker a success. The author remarked that the game ultimately \\"sold 650,000 copies, not least via the department store chain Walmart\\", where it was stocked as a budget title. Reception In October 1997, Safecracker won the \\"People's Choice\\" prize among entertainment products at the Macromedia International User Conference (UCON). This followed the game's wins, before its launch, at the Macromedia European User Awards. Reviewing the game's PXL Computers edition, Joseph Novicki of PC Gamer US and Joel Strauch of PC Games offered conflicting opinions. Novicki praised the \\"clarity of purpose\\" in Safecrackers narrow focus on puzzle-solving, compared to Myst-inspired titles that combine puzzles with plot. By contrast, Strauch considered the game's limited story and premise to be major flaws. The lack of interaction beyond safecracking was likewise cited as a positive and a negative, respectively, by the two writers. While Novicki summarized Safecracker as \\"good puzzle game for gamers of all skill levels\\", despite problems with its inventory system, Strauch called the puzzles a mixed bag and ultimately panned the game. The reviewer for PC PowerPlay, David Wildgoose, continued Strauch's complaints about the \\"stifling and pointless basic premise\\" in Safecracker. Charlie Brooker of PC Zone concurred: he dismissed the title as a dull, limited experience, and \\"the sort of thing that [only] impresses computer game virgins and Macintosh owners\\". He also echoed Strauch's criticism of the QuickTime VR implementation, which both writers found unimpressive as a computer game engine. Brooker's only praise went to the soundtrack, which he considered \\"alright\\". Wildgoose joined Brooker in calling Safecrackers visuals technically impressive but nevertheless drab and boring, and took a harder line than Strauch against the \\"witless, haphazard\\" puzzles. Writing for IGN, Scott Steinberg was more positive on the puzzles, of which he noted that \\"a rather large quantity ... are nothing short of ingenious\\". He also offered light praise to the visuals, in contrast to Brooker and Wildgoose. Despite these concessions, Steinberg ultimately declared Safecracker prohibitively difficult and confusing, and he sharply criticized its \\"techno crud\\" score. The adventure game websites Just Adventure and Adventure Gamers were more approving of Safecracker. Ray Ivey of the latter publication called the puzzle design \\"simply a delight\\", and felt that the game was addictive. Just Adventure's Randy Sluganski similarly lauded the puzzles. Although he found them extremely difficult, he wrote that \\"you actually feel a sense of accomplishment and pride\\" after solving them. Sluganski also enjoyed the \\"top-notch\\" visuals. While he and Ivey both declared Safecrackers plot an afterthought, neither writer felt that its simplicity detracted from the game. Both compared the proceedings to Jewels of the Oracle, which Sluganski believed would limit its appeal, but he nonetheless strongly recommended Safecracker to puzzle devotees. Ivey offered a more general recommendation: to him, Safecracker was a \\"breezy good time, not to be missed.\\" Legacy With Safecracker as its first release, Daydream Software became an important force in Swedish games. A writer for the city of Ume√• later remarked that Daydream \\"laid the foundation for the lucrative gaming industry in northern Sweden\\", which later included Coldwood Interactive and Nifflas Games in Ume√• itself. The team followed Safecracker with Traitors Gate (1999) and the online game Clusterball (2000). However, Daydream was hounded by problems related to its public launch. The Ume√•n writer noted that shareholders did not understand the game industry or \\"the time it takes to develop a large, extensive computer game\\", and that they demanded faster returns than the prospectus had promised. The Wall Street Journal reported that stocks had crashed at Daydream by early 1998. In retrospect, Nigel Papworth called the company's hit IPO \\"bad for us [in the end]. Here we were, blue-eyed, no proper management, no board.\\" Jan Phersson-Broberg likewise believed that the IPO was premature. After a series of financial and management problems related to its public status, the developer was shuttered in 2003. In April 2006, plans for another Safecracker installment were revealed by publisher DreamCatcher Interactive. It was developed by Kheops Studio, previously known for Return to Mysterious Island. At the time of the announcement, Adventure Gamers reported that the game was to be a spiritual sequel rather than a direct follow-up, and that it would feature 35 safe puzzles. According to Kheops' Beno√Æt Hozjan, DreamCatcher first contacted his team about developing a new Safecracker in early 2006, thanks to the original's status as a hit for the publisher. Kheops responded with a pitch for the game and suggested a story based on locating a will. Hozjan noted that the team had difficulty with the title's \\"fully puzzle-oriented\\" design, as its earlier projects had emphasized plot. The resultant game, entitled Safecracker: The Ultimate Puzzle Adventure, follows a safecracking professional who seeks the lost will of Duncan W. Adams, a wealthy collector of safes with unusual designs. After going gold in July 2006, the title reached store shelves in August. A port for the Wii was released in December 2008.

He was one of the leading European two-year- olds of 2004, when he was unbeaten in three races including the Middle Park Stakes. He failed to win in 2005 but returned as a four-year-old to win the Queen Anne Stakes. Since his retirement he has had some success as a sire of winners in Australia. Background Ad Valorem is a bay horse standing 15.3 hands high with a white blaze and four white socks bred in Kentucky by Calumet Farm. His sire Danzig, who ran only three times before his career was ended by injury, was a highly successful stallion who sired the winners of more than fifty Grade I/Group One races. His offspring include the champions Chief's Crown, Dayjur and Lure as well as the important stallion Danehill. In August 2003, the colt was sent to the Fasig-Tipton sales at Saratoga, where he was bought for $450,000 by Thomas Magnier, acting on behalf of the Coolmore organisation. The colt raced in the colours of Susan Magnier and was trained by Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Racing career =2004: two-year-old season= Ad Valorem did not appear on the racecourse until 5 September 2004, when he contested a six furlong maiden race at the Curragh. Ridden by Jamie Spencer, he started the 6/4 favourite and won impressively by three and half lengths from Lightwood Lady. Two weeks later Ad Valorem was moved up in class for the Listed Blenheim Stakes over the same course and distance. Starting joint-favourite at odds of 9/4 he took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by length from Indesatchel. Two weeks after his win in the Blenheim Stakes, the colt was sent to England for the Group One Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse where he was made the 9/2 second favourite in a field of nine colts. Spencer tracked the leaders before sending Ad Valorem into the lead a furlong from the finish. He won by three quarters of a length from Rebuttal, with the favourite Iceman two and ahalf lengths further back in third. Commenting on Ad Valorem's success, O'Brien said: \\"He's a lovely horse. He won his maiden very smoothly then he won a stakes very easily next time ‚Äì that's why we came here. He was always finding enough today and seemed well on top at the line but he's got a lot of natural speed.\\" In the official International Classification, Ad Valorem was given a rating of 121 pounds, equal with Dubawi and one pound below the top-rated Shamardal. =2005: three- year-old season= Ad Valorem did not race in the spring of 2005 missing an intended run in the Irish 2,000 Guineas. O'Brien explained that he wanted to give the colt more time after his three races in quick succession as a two- year-old. He did not appear until June, when he contested the St James's Palace Stakes, run that year at York Racecourse. Ridden by Mick Kinane he finished second, three lengths behind the winner Shamardal and one and three quarter lengths ahead of his stable companion Oratorio. In July he was made the 6/4 favourite for the Prix Jean Prat at Chantilly Racecourse, but finished fifth of the eight runners behind Turtle Bowl. In the Group One Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse, Ad Valorem was tested against older horses for the first time and led for most of the way before finishing third behind Proclamation and Soviet Song. In the autumn of 2005, Ad Valorem was sent to compete in the United States, but had little success. He finished sixth in the Shadwell Turf Mile Stakes at Keeneland on 8 October and ninth in the Breeders' Cup Mile at Belmont Park three weeks later. =2006: four-year-old season= Ad Valorem returned for a third season, beginning at the Curragh in April when he finished a distant sixth in the Gladness Stakes. Following this race a half share in the colt was sold to the New South Wales-based Woodlands Stud, and he raced from then on as the property of a partnership between Susan Magnier and Bob Ingham. The colt had gone twenty months without a win when he was sent to Royal Ascot for the Group One Queen Anne Stakes over one mile. Ridden by Kieren Fallon, he was the 13/2 fourth choice in the betting behind Peeress, Proclamation and Court Masterpiece. The colt appeared to be struggling at half way but rallied strongly when Fallon switched him to the right in the final quarter mile. He took the lead inside the final furlong and won by one and a half lengths from Court Masterpiece. The racecourse stewards called an enquiry into the race, as the winner appeared to have caused interference to both Court Masterpiece and Peeress but although Fallon was given a four-day suspension, the result was allowed to stand. His final European race was the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville Racecourse in August. O'Brien expressed his doubts about running the colt on soft ground and his concerns appeared justified as Ad Valorem finished fifth of the ten runners behind Librettist. As in the previous season, Ad Valorem was sent to race in North America in the Autumn. He produced his best effort in the Woodbine Mile, in which he carried top weight of 124 pounds into third place behind Becrux. On his final appearance, he finished thirteenth of the fourteen runners in the Breeders' Cup Mile. Assessment As noted above, Ad Valorem was rated the joint second-best two-year-old in Europe in 2004. In the 2005 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, Ad Valorem was given a rating of 116, making him the 89th best racehorse in the world. In the following year his mark improved to 117, making him the 72nd best racehorse in the world, twelve pounds below the top rated Invasor. Stud record Ad Valorem was retired from racing to become a shuttle stallion, standing at Coolmore's Irish base before spending the southern hemisphere breeding season at the Woodlands Stud. In 2008 he became partly owned by the Darley Stud, which purchased Woodlands. His biggest success has been in Australia where his winners have included the Group race winners Uate (Skyline Stakes), Free Wheeling (Champagne Classic), Detours (How Now Stakes), Meliora (Angus Armanasco Stakes) and Pied a Terre (Autumn Stakes).

He grew up in rural Connecticut and lives in Brooklyn, New York. Biography After growing up in rural Connecticut, an environment that greatly influences his work, Timo Andres attended Yale University for both his undergraduate and graduate education, studying with Martin Bresnick, Ingram Marshall, Aaron Jay Kernis, Christopher Theofanidis, John Halle, Matthew Suttor, Kathryn Alexander, Michael Klingbeil, and Orianna Webb. He is also a graduate of Juilliard's pre- college program. Andres first rose to prominence at the age of 24 when his piece Nightjar was commissioned and performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and John Adams. Since then, he has been commissioned by Wigmore Hall, Carnegie Hall, the Concertgebouw Amsterdam, San Francisco Performances, the Gilmore Foundation and the Library of Congress. Andres has performed solo recitals at (Le) Poisson Rouge, Wigmore Hall and Lincoln Center, and alongside artists such as Gabriel Kahane, Philip Glass, and David Kaplan. Works Andres's work has received broad critical acclaim and is particularly noted for its seamless blend of traditional and contemporary idioms. Alex Ross of The New Yorker has called Andres \\"quietly awesome\\" and his music \\"the kind of sprawling, brazen work that a young composer should write.\\" Andres draws from a wide array of influences, including bands such as Sigur R√≥s, Boards of Canada, Brian Eno and Radiohead, as well as classical music by Brahms, Schumann, Mozart, and Charles Ives.

Egerton married British-born Isabelle Geraldine Davenport, June 20, 1904 in Cambridge, England. They had two children, Robert Egerton Swartwout (1905-1951) and Charlotte Elizabeth (1908-1908). Robert Egerton Swartwout, better known as R.E. Swartwout, was an author and the first American to cox the Cambridge University rowing team to victory over Oxford University, in 1930. Training and career Egerton Swartwout, 1922 Egerton Swartwout graduated from Yale University in 1891 with a B.A. degree. He had no formal training in architecture, but spent two summers during college working in small architecture offices. After graduating from Yale he presented a letter of introduction to Stanford White of McKim, Mead and White. White took him into the firm as an unpaid student, and after a few months he was hired as a draftsman.Swartwout, Egerton. An Architectural Decade. Swartwout spent ten years at the firm and rose through the ranks of draftsmen. He worked primarily for Charles McKim, assisting in the design of several of McKim's major buildings, including the Low Memorial Library at Columbia University. The four internal staircases at the corners of the rotunda leading to four exits were Swartwout's contribution. Swartwout wrote in his memoir that he later regretted the idea, because when he used the library he could never manage to find the same stairs going down that he had used to come up, and when he was in a hurry to catch a train he often found himself leaving by the wrong exit in the rear of the building. Swartwout produced drawings for the University Club, another of McKim's important commissions, and borrowed some of its details for his design of the Missouri State Capitol. He worked with socialite Theodate Pope Riddle on the design of Hill-Stead, now the Hill-Stead Museum, for her parents. When he left McKim, Mead and White, Swartwout had charge of thirteen building projects. In 1900 he teamed with co-worker and fellow Yale graduate, Evarts Tracy, to form Tracy and Swartwout. The new firm designed many significant buildings, including the Missouri State Capitol. After Tracy's death in 1922, Swartwout continued in solo practice. During his career, Swartwout developed guidelines for judging architectural competitions for the American Institute of Architects, making it possible for young architects to succeed. One of the first architects to incorporate acoustics in his designs, Wallace Clement Sabine, served as consultant on many of Swartwout's buildings. Swartwout sat on the American Battle Monuments Commission and served as vice chairman of the American Academy of the Fine Arts. Tracy and Swartwout were awarded The Medal of Honor by the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 1920 for distinguished achievements in architecture as exemplified by the Missouri State Capitol and Denver Post Office. Egerton served 3 terms as president of the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. He was made an honorary member of the Societe Nationale Des Beaux Arts in 1915.Bulletin of Yale University Obituary Record of Graduates of Yale University Deceased During the Year I942-I943 Series 4 0 I January I944 Number I Swartwout was a member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1931 to 1936; the American Academy of Arts and Letters; and the National Academy of Design.Thomas Luebke, ed. \\"\\"Civic Art: A Centennial History of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts\\"\\" (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, 2013): Appendix B.

The Nation is a signatory to Treaty 6, and their traditional language is Plains Cree. Saddle Lake's governing structure is unusual in that it has two separate councils and chiefs governing their two reserves - Saddle Lake Cree Nation (proper) and the Whitefish Lake First Nation (often called \\"Whitefish (Goodfish) Lake First Nation\\" to distinguish it from a similarly named group in Manitoba). For the purposes of the Indian Act however, Saddle Lake and Whitefish have one, shared, band government and the two reserves are considered to be one Nation. In June 2013, the Nation reported a population of 9,934 people, of which 6,148 people lived on their own Reserve. Their reported population size makes Saddle Lake the second most populous First Nation in Alberta (after the Kainai Nation also known as the Blood people).2008 Official Population List, Alberta Municipal Affairs, Municipal Services Branch Of these 2,378 were members of the Whitefish Lake First Nation, with 1,778 of those living on-reserve, and remainder are members of the Saddle Lake Cree Nation proper. History In 1876, the Amiskwacƒ´wiyiniwak, who were a loose confederation of Cree and Assiniboine band societies (part of the wider Iron Confederation), entered into a treaty relationship with Canada through Treaty 6. Chief Onchaminahos (\\"Little Hunter\\"), representing the Saddle Lake Band of Cree, and Chief Pak√¢n (\\"Nut\\"), representing Whitefish Lake Band of Cree together represented the people of the Saddle Lake Cree Nation at the negotiations and signing at Fort Pitt (now in Saskatchewan). Chief Pakan, along with Big Bear argued for one large reserve of for all the Plains and Woods Cree in the West, so they could hunt and farm together. When the government did not agree to this, Pakan's and Big Bear's bands refused to settle on reserves until better term were offered; Pakan went to Regina with the M√©tis translator Peter Erasmus in 1884 to discuss the matter with the Indian commissioner.Devine, p. 148 In 1902, four historical Cree bands were amalgamated as the Saddle Lake Cree Nation. The four Cree Bands were: * Onchaminahos' Band, led by Chief Onchaminahos (\\"Little Hunter\\"; also known as Thomas Hunter); * Seenum's Band, led by Chief Pak√¢n (\\"Nut\\", also known as James Seenum); * Blue Quill's Band, led by Chief Blue Quill; and * Wasatnow's Band, led by Chief Muskegwatic (\\"Bear Ears\\"). However, the amalgamation process wasn't fully completed until 1953 when the treaty pay lists of the Little Hunter's, James Seenum's and Blue Quill's Bands were merged. Reserves There are three reserves under the governance of the Saddle Lake Cree Nation, one of which is shared with five other bands: * Blue Quills, formerly known as the \\"Blue Quill Indian Reserve 127\\", shared with five other bands (see article) * Saddle Lake 125, containing the community of Saddle Lake, Alberta * Whitefish Lake 128; the reserve is also known as \\"Whitefish Lake Indian Reserve 128\\" or as \\"Goodfish Lake Indian Reserve 128\\", and occasionally as \\"Whitefish (Goodfish) Lake Indian Reserve 128\\" Originally, Chief Muskegwatic had also reserved Washatanow (or Hollow Hill Creek) Indian Reserve 126 along the north bank of the North Saskatchewan River. However, this Reserve was surrendered in 1896 in exchange for an equal area of land adjoining Saddle Lake Indian Reserve 125, known today as the \\"Cache Lake Addition\\" of the Saddle Lake Indian Reserve 125. Blue Quill Indian Reserve 127 was originally reserved for the use by the Blue Quill's Band, but in 1896, a boarding school (Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, commonly called the \\"Saddle Lake Boarding School\\") was relocated from Lac la Biche, Alberta, to the Blue Quill Indian Reserve, and the Band relocated to the Saddle Lake Indian Reserve. In 1931, Blue Quill Indian Reserve 127 became a shared Reserve when the boarding school relocated to St. Paul, Alberta. Saddle Lake Indian Reserve 125 is bordered by Smoky Lake County, the County of St. Paul No. 19, and County of Two Hills No. 21. Governance Saddle Lake Cree Nation elect their officials through a Custom Electoral System. Additionally, this Cree Nation maintains two groups of elected officials: =Saddle Lake Cree Nation= Saddle Lake Cree Nation on the Saddle Lake Indian Reserve have elected Chief Eric Shirt, and Councillors John Large, Eddy Makokis, Leonard Jackson, Glen Jason Whiskeyjack, James Steinhauer, Pamela Quinn, Cherrilene Steinhauer, Darcy McGilvery. =Whitefish Lake First Nation= Saddle Lake Cree Nation on the White Fish Lake Indian Reserve, governing the Reserve as the Whitefish Lake First Nation, also have elected officials.

Aguillard's recent tenure was shaken by a series of controversies that led to the call of a student strike against his administration. On March 27, 2014, it was reported that the LC trustees had asked Aguillard to resign but he did not do so. On April 15, 2014, the trustees voted to name Aguillard as president emeritus beginning August 1, with Argile Smith, the associate dean of Christian ministry of the Caskey School of Divinity, tapped as the interim president, also effective on August 1 as well. Aguillard remained president until May 31, 2014 at which time Smith served for two months as the \\"president pro tempore\\" and then the interim president. Aguillard assisted Smith in the transition of administration and beginning in 2015 resumed his former tenured professorship in the LC Graduate Teacher Education program. Background Aguillard was born in Basile, a small town near Crowley on the border of Acadia and Evangeline parishes in South Louisiana, the son of Harry Aguillard (1918-1969) and the former Helyn Greene, both graduates of Louisiana College. He confessed his faith in Jesus Christ at a young age in his local Baptist church. After graduation in 1974 from Basile High School, an entity of the Evangeline Parish School Board, Aguillard entered Louisiana College, where he completed in three years his Bachelor of Arts in the fields of English and communications. There, he met his future wife, the former Judy Collins. The couple has three daughters, Jill, Julie, and Jodi, all LC graduates. Aguillard earned Master of Education degrees in two fields: (1) Guidance/ Counseling and (2) Administration/Supervision from McNeese State University in Lake Charles, Louisiana. In 1989, he received a Doctor of Education degree in Educational Leadership from Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Aguillard is a former president of the organization, Deans of the Colleges of Education in Louisiana. In 2004, then Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco appointed Aguillard to the Blue Ribbon Commission on Education as the representative for higher education. In 2000, Aguillard joined the faculty as chairman of the LC education department. In 2004, he was named \\"Outstanding Teacher of the Year\\" at LC. Prior to 2000, he had been employed in DeRidder in southwestern Louisiana by the Beauregard Parish School Board, his last position there from 1999 to 2000 having been as the school superintendent. As he became superintendent, Aguillard attended a prayer rally called to seek spiritual help for Beauregard Parish schools. The gathering was hosted by then State Senator B. G. Dyess of Alexandria, a since deceased Baptist clergyman of many decades and an alumnus of Louisiana College. Aguillard is a member of the rural Philadelphia Baptist Church in Deville in eastern Rapides Parish. Several of his fellow church members called for a \\"prayer walk\\" for Louisiana College on March 29, 2014, amid the buildup of opposition to President Aguillard's tenure. Presidential record Aguillard was elected president by the LC board of trustees, effective January 19, 2005, to succeed Rory Lee, who became executive director of Baptist Children's Village, a statewide ministry based in Ridgeland, Mississippi, that provides group homes for children and spiritual counseling for families. Aguillard had apparently not been the first choice of the trustees. Malcolm Beryl Yarnell, III (born 1962), a native of upstate New York and a scholar on the English Reformation who teaches at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, was first considered, but he bowed out citing \\"governance issues\\" at LC. Aguillard was not formally inaugurated as president until March 2006. In the fall 2006, former U.S. President George Herbert Walker Bush accepted Aguillard's invitation to come to the campus to speak during the LC centennial ceremonies. In 2012, the Louisiana Baptist Convention granted approval to Louisiana College to seek $12 million in donations from member churches within the state as part of the institution's $50 million capital improvements program. The $12 million will be earmarked for improvements in student housing. Cottingham Hall, built in 1941, is marked for full renovation, roof, plumbing, heating, air-conditioning, and ventilation.\\"Capital Campaign Q&A; with Dr. Aguillard\\", Columns: the Magazine for Louisiana College Alumni and Friends (Winter 2013), pp. 10-11 Failed Promises of Law, Medical, and Film Schools Under Aguillard, LC attempted to build a law school to be named for the Texas state legislator and judge, Paul Pressler, which was to be located in a former federal building in Shreveport in northwestern Louisiana.\\"Judge Paul Pressler School of Law\\", Columns: The Magazine for Louisiana College Alumni and Friends, Winter 2010, p. 16 Due to what many community leaders describe as 'failed promises', and 'false information' by Aguillard, the law school never materialized. Aguillard also guaranteed the future establishment of a medical school, and film school. Neither of which came to fruition. LC ended its fiscal year July 31, 2012, with a deficit of $1.3 million; the institution spent $30.5 million during that time but collected only $29.2 million in revenues. Controversies involving Aguillard =Presidential politics and Obamacare= In February 2012, Louisiana College filed suit against the U.S. government to contest the federal directive that even religious institutions must include in their insurance coverage for employees the costs of contraceptives, sterilization, and drugs which induce abortions. The next month, Aguillard hosted a campaign event on the LC campus for former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich, who was then seeking the Republican presidential nomination subsequently won by Mitt Romney of Massachusetts. During the rally, Aguillard claimed that he would \\"consider shutting down\\" Louisiana College if the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is implemented. The measure was signed into law by President Barack H. Obama on March 23, 2010, but did not immediately take effect. Aguillard continues to argue for repeal. Aguillard, himself a Republican, did not endorse Gingrich as his choice for the presidential nomination; a few days later he performed the same introductory honors for then U.S. Representative Ron Paul of Texas. Another Republican contender, former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, spoke to LC students prior to the Louisiana primary election on the topic of \\"freedom, faith, and family.\\" =Accreditation under challenge= In December 2013, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools reaffirmed LC accreditation after two years of warning status. Sanctions were removed, and no further monitoring is required. A follow-up report is due c. 2017. In January 2014, Tommy French, the founding former pastor of Jefferson Baptist Church in Baton Rouge, was elected chairman of the LC board of trustees. French said that he intends to monitor the accreditation issue to \\"strengthen the college and every department. ... We're staying on top of our accreditation. These new matters require constant attention.\\" In March 2014, less than three months after the reaffirmation of LC's accreditation, SACS senior vice president and chief of staff Michael Johnson confirmed that the agency will \\"investigate\\" LC after college officials were accused of having submitted documents that contain forged signatures and other inconsistencies in its official reports. =Calvinism on campus= Aguillard has been engaged in conflicts with various faculty members and administrators, at least three of whom were non-renewed in 2013 over what he calls the spread on the campus of Calvinism and its doctrine of unconditional election: \\"For Calvinism to advance, I had to be stopped. [The Calvinists] were the attackers ...\\" Prior to the time of conflict, Aguillard in 2011 had a heart attack, open-heart surgery, and successful rehabilitation. =Cason Foundation dispute= Another dispute centers on funding of the Caskey School of Divinity. The Cason Foundation, which had donated $5 million to LC to fund the school, announced that it will no longer financially support the college because of \\"actions of President Aguillard which we believe to be unethical and potentially illegal.\\" Edgar D. Cason and his wife, Flora Jean Caskey Cason, of Coushatta in Red River Parish, who established the foundation, informed LC trustees by letter on April 15, 2013, that the foundation was terminating its ties to LC. A probe conducted by a law firm in New Orleans claims that Aguillard had improperly diverted nearly $60,000 in divinity school donations to LC projects in Tanzania, Africa. A committee of five LC board members, however, defended Aguillard and maintain that he did not act improperly regarding the funds. Cason, a wealthy timber operator, farmer, and cattleman, has supported conservative Republican candidates, including Santorum for President, and issues, such as the Louisiana Values Political Action Committee. Cason questioned why the LC trustees did not permit him to address the board at its March meeting. In a private executive session of the trustees on March 18 and 19, 2013, two motions regarding Aguillard were defeated. One called for his outright removal; another proposed administrative leave. Aguillard submitted a statement to the Alexandria Daily Town Talk in which he declared the executive session to have been \\"productive. I am looking forward to leading Louisiana College into the best days God has prepared for us.\\" It was subsequently revealed that the special committee of the trustees had voted four-to-three to clear Aguillard of wrongdoing regarding the diverted Cason funds. One of the dissenting votes was cast by Tony Perkins, a Republican former member of the Louisiana House of Representatives and the president of the Family Research Council. Perkins subsequently in an email to the Reverend Kris Chenier, the pastor of the Trinity Heights Baptist Church in Shreveport and the chairman of the special LC panel, questioned why the committee had implied that the decision to clear Aguillard had been unanimous, rather than by the margin of a single vote. In March 2014, The Alexandria Daily Town Talk reported that a taped recording from late May or early June 2012, released by former LC vice president Charles L. \\"Chuck\\" Quarles, indicates that Aguillard spoke personally with the Casons about the diversion of funds to the Tanzania project. On May 21, 2013, however, Aguillard told The Town Talk that he had not spoken to the Casons but had received confirmation from Quarles that the couple had agreed that some of the funds could be used for the Tanzania project. The Casons said that they will make no further comments about the dispute. =Trustees reaffirm Aguillard, 2013= On April 30, 2013, the trustees in a special meeting called regarding the future of President Aguillard voted to retain him as president and laid spiritual hands over him. At first it was not disclosed how many of the thirty-four trustees were present for the special meeting or the breakdown of the vote, but the majority declared the matter closed for further consideration.\\"Louisiana College Board votes to retain Aguillard as president\\", Alexandria Daily Town Talk, May 1, 2013 Subsequently, it was reported that board split sixteen-to- thirteen in Aguillard's favor, with five trustees absent or not voting. On May 1, 2013, Aguillard announced that a Baptist couple had anonymously donated $10 million to LC as a means of showing support for his leadership. It is the largest single donation ever to the institution. =Timothy Johnson and Charles Quarles disputes= In July 2013, Timothy \\"Tim\\" Johnson, the outgoing LC vice president, dispatched a letter to the trustees in which he contends that Aguillard's anti-Calvinist stance is designed to \\"detract attention from the real problems\\" at the institution. According to Johnson, Aguillard developed \\"the political football of Calvinism. ... No concern for truth and integrity. In the process, good men and their families have been damaged while pastors and people all around our state know that Calvinism was not the issue.\\" Johnson spent six years as executive vice president under Aguillard and was the chairman of the trustees in January 2005, when Aguillard was selected as president in a decision opposed by many LC faculty members. Johnson filed a whistleblower complaint with the trustees against Aguillard on February 5, 2013. He was notified on May 17 that his contract, which expired July 31, would not be renewed. Johnson said that he knew that he could lose his position when he filed the complaint but had thought the trustees would, in his words, \\"do the right thing\\". After leaving LC, Johnson has been a part- time pastor. On March 11, March 2014, Johnson filed a lawsuit in the Ninth Judicial District Court in Alexandria against LC and Aguillard for wrongful termination based on the whistleblower complaint. Johnson, who was paid $146,000 annually in salary and benefits, is seeking damages, court costs, and \\"general and equitable relief.\\" Johnson in the suit lists Aguillard as his \\"joint employer\\", because, based on a released recording, Aguillard told an employee, who recorded the conversation: \\"I am the employer, and I sign your contract. You don't work for the college. The college ... is a place of work. The employer is me, and the employee is you.\\" According to another part of the recording, Aguillard demands that all employees be fully loyal to him as the president of the institution because he \\"knows things nobody else knows\\" and is the \\"biblical authority\\" on the campus. Aguillard said loyalty to him is more essential than competency in a job description. Chuck Quarles, the former LC vice president who had also been the dean of the LC Caskey School of Divinity, had filed a whistleblower complaint against Aguillard on December 11, 2012, two months before Johnson's challenge. Quarles resigned at the end of the school year in 2013 and accepted a position as a professor of New Testament and biblical theology at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, North Carolina. Argile Smith, the executive vice president, the vice president of Integration of Faith and Learning, and Aguillard's eventual interim successor as the LC president, said, \\"The faculty, staff, and students, have been so supportive through this journey. Our President has shown us how to work through a crisis with the kind of integrity that comes from a resilient relationship with Christ. Now that the crisis is behind us, Louisiana College can get back to fulfilling our mission, 'to change the World for Christ!'\\". \\"Louisiana College is focused on moving past the Calvinism coup and strategically addressing her mission, of bringing every lost soul to Christ as we strive to fulfill our Mission\\", said Aguillard. Dr. Tommy French, chairman of the LC trustees, said, \\"The board is thrilled at the SACS Reaffirmation in December, 2013 and looks forward to the bright future as our President leads Louisiana College to fulfill her mission.\\" =Sex scandal cover-up and forgery= On February 26, 2014, two documents were leaked online disclosing an alleged blackmail attempt by Aguillard's former assistant, Joseph Cole. The first document, released minutes from an executive committee meeting of the LC Board of Trustees, contends that Cole threatened to leak \\"office secrets\\" to The Alexandria Daily Town Talk or Save Our Louisiana College unless the college paid him $25,000 cash plus overtime pay and benefits. Cole claimed that Aguillard forged signatures on official SACS documents, abused pain medications, and had knowledge of an incident in a hotel room involving Cole, pornography, and two LC male college freshmen prior to his hiring of Cole as his executive assistant. The second document contained the college's agreement to pay Cole the $25,000; in exchange, Cole was to sign a non-disclosure agreement with the college. The document contains a letter from the Armour Law Firm, which then represented LC. This document confirms Cole's claims that Aguillard had forged multiple signatures on official SACS documents and had hindered an internal investigation into the matter. When Aguillard, who had previously recused himself from the matter, insisted that Armour immediately surrender all of the information pertaining to the Joseph Cole dispute, the law firm decided not to renew its contract with Louisiana College and wrote: =Student strike against Aguillard= A student strike against Aguillard, called \\"Prayers for Progress\\", took place at 8 a.m. Monday, March 24, 2014 at LC's Guinn Auditorium. An anonymous student spokesman said, \\"Our terms are resignation of the president or dismissal by the board.\\" According to a flier the dissidents vow to \\"shut down the school by not attending classes until we are heard, and we make steps in the right direction.\\" Aguillard at a forum on March 20 described LC as \\"an open book regarding our future and our strength and reminding one another it's not about us, it's all about Jesus.\\" A reporter for the Alexandria Daily Town Talk attended the forum for forty-five minutes before being asked to leave. Aguillard claimed that the newspaper \\"printed false information\\" in recent articles about the status of the college and its evaluation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Many blamed the low student turnout for the strike on fear of retaliation from the administration. LC had warned students in a notice that a strike would constitute a possible violation of college policies that could result in severe sanctions, such as suspension, denial of a degree, or expulsion, all on the first violation of the code. Media representatives were asked to leave the campus at the time of the gathering. The story made state and national headlines with several media organizations saying that the administration had violated the students' First Amendment rights. =Forced Resignation= Three days after the student strike, it was disclosed that Aguillard had lost the support of the majority of the trustees. The Town Talk reported that opposition to Aguillard had mushroomed after David Hankins, the executive director of the Louisiana Baptist Convention, reportedly dropped his support after learning that Aguillard had been recorded as having said that Hankins might be the individual promoting Calvinism on the LC campus and could \\"get caught in his own lies\\". After the comments about Hankins became public, Aguillard wrote the Baptist executive director a letter expressing his \\"remorse\\" over having made such remarks: \\"I pray that you will forgive me, and we can continue to work closely together for Christ.\\" Ten LC trustees who had formerly opposed Aguillard released a public letter on March 28, 2014 critical of Aguillard's leadership: \\"It has been about the abuse of power and authoritarian control. We are concerned with truth and transparency and we believe the [Louisiana Baptist] Convention should be concerned about the same. ... we encourage the entire board to be unified in charting a new direction for the college.\\" The ten dissidents, including Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, said that they would have called for Aguillard's termination in 2013 had not convention executive director David Hankins exerted \\"undue influence\\" in defense of Aguillard. Several trustees indicated that Aguillard, not Hankins, is the focus of their concern. Departure as president On April 15, Dr. Aguillard chose to step down. The board voted to name Argile Smith as the interim president, and to seek a new leader for the campus. Aguillard will hold the title president emeritus effective August 1, 2014. He begins a one- year paid sabbatical on June 1 at his full $202,007 base salary. If he decides to return to LC as a tenured professor in 2015‚Äì2016, he will receive 50 percent of his current base pay, or $101,003.50. For each subsequent year as an LC senior professor, beginning with the 2016‚Äì2017 academic year, he will receive 30 percent of his current base salary, or $60,602.10. Three weeks after Aguillard vacated the LC presidency, the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in its annual meeting in San Antonio, Texas, again placed Louisiana College on probation because of issues related to trustee board governance, institutional integrity, personnel policies, and audit findings regarding student financial aid and other financial control matters. Interim president Argile Smith said that the decision by SACS is \\"disappointing\\" but \\"represents an opportunity for Louisiana College to address the issues in preparation for the arrival of a new president. Fortunately, the issues don't bring into question in any way the excellent classroom work being done by our professors and students. The issues have to do with administrative areas.\\"John Willie, \\"Louisiana College Placed on Probation by SACSCOC; Maintains Full Accreditation\\", Louisiana College press release, June 19, 2014 President-Emeritus & Eventual Termination In what most alumni, students, and community leaders found odd, Aguillard was named president emeritus at a service on August 28, 2014. Leon M. Hyatt, Jr., a former LC trustee and friend of Aguillard's, told the audience: \\"I want to say probably Dr. Aguillard is the most criticized president the college has ever had. Why? Because, like Jesus, he told it like it is.\\" Hyatt attributed much of the criticism of Aguillard to the former president's defense of biblical principles rejected in the secular world. Hyatt noted Aguillard's belief in the inerrancy of Scripture, an issue which went to court regarding a dispute with several former LC professors. The particular matter ultimately ended in Aguillard's favor in a decision by the Louisiana Supreme Court. Hyatt did not mention the controversies of 2013 and 2014 that led to Aguillard's departure from the helm of LC. Though Aguillard remained president-emeritus and a faculty member after he was forced to resign the LC presidency, he was finally terminated from both positions in the spring of 2016 following an evaluation. In September 2016, Aguillard filed suit in the 9th Judicial District Court in Alexandria to seek damages for \\"civil conspiracy\\" involving breach of contract, assault and battery, and emotional distress. The defendants include Louisiana College, Aguillard's permanent presidential successor Rick Brewer, private investigator Don Benton Connor, Sr., and the insurance underwriting firm RSUI Indemnity Company. An out-of- court settlement was believed to have been pending in December 2016. Then in late May 2017, Louisiana College filed a civil suit seeking unspecified damages for defamation against former President Aguillard, who it alleges \\"engaged in a regular and pervasive campaign to undercut\\" the institution including \\"ghostwriting faculty member grievances\\" against the administration. The suit cites an \\"anonymous package\\" reportedly circulated by Aguillard of \\"derogatory statements\\" about the college. Individual plaintiffs include LC president Rick Brewer and Cheryl Clark, whom Aguillard accused of having illegally changed the final grades of more than \\"a dozen nursing students.\\" References Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:People from Basile, Louisiana Category:People from Beauregard Parish, Louisiana Category:People from Pineville, Louisiana Category:Educators from Louisiana Category:American school superintendents Category:Presidents of Louisiana College Category:Louisiana College alumni Category:McNeese State University alumni Category:Nova Southeastern University alumni Category:Baptists from Louisiana Category:Louisiana Republicans ","title":"Joe W.

The long route includes these same stages but continues towards Puerto Maldonado after reaching Urcos. It passes through Ccatcca, Ocongate and Marcapata.  Short Route  = Society of Jesus Church - Cusco = Society of Jesus Church The construction of the church began in 1576 at the initiative of the jesuits on the top of the Amarucancha, the Palace of the Inca Huayna Capac. The church is considered to be one of the most beautiful representations of the colonial baroque art in America. Its spectacular fa√ßade, the highest of the Cusquenian churches, is entirely made of stones. Inside, one can see an altar covered with gold leaves built over an underground chapel. The church has a significant collection of sculptures and paintings such as ‚Äúthe wedding of Ignatius of Loyola‚Äôs nephew‚Äù. = Saint Peter the Apostle Church - Andahuaylillas = Saint Peter the Apostle Church Saint Peter the Apostle Church of Andahuaylillas is nicknamed the Sistine Chapel of the Andes because of the magnificent frescos adorning its walls. Andahuaylillas is a small town located 45 km away from Cusco. The church, probably built on an ancient Inca site at the end of the 16th century, is covered with murals. One of them is signed by the Limenian painter Luis de Ria√±o in 1626. = Saint John the Baptist Church - Huaro = Fresco - Saint John The Baptist of Huaro Chapel Canincunca of Urcos The small town of Huaro is located 4 km south of Andahuaylillas. Its white church dedicated to John the Baptist was built at the end of the 17th century. Its structure, made up of a single nave, is of classic style. Its fa√ßade is enlivened by indigenous decorations and flanked by a bell gable. Inside, the Renaissance altar is among the oldest of Peru. However, the magnificent pair of frescos made by Tadeo Escalante, situated on both sides of the entrance gate, is undoubtedly the most fascinating artwork in the church. = Canincunca Chapel - Urcos = The Canincunca chapel dedicated to the Virgin of Candelaria was probably built at the beginning of the 17th century for the purpose of evangelizing the indigenous populations. It stands above Urcos¬¥ lake on a significant pre- Hispanic site. The cemetery that sits on the hill behind the chapel holds remains that date back to the Incan Empire. The inside of the chapel contains an Andean Baroque iconography such as representations of viscachas and a representation of the Virgin of Candelaria.  Long Route  = Saint John the Baptist Church - Ccatcca = The small town of Ccatcca boasts of a splendid baroque church dedicated to Saint John the Baptist. = Saint Paul Church - Ocongate = The church shows aspects of churrigueresque baroque as well as neoclassicism. It contains several paintings of the famous Cusquenian painter Diego Quispe Tito. = Saint Francis of Assisi Church - Marcapata = The little town of Marcapata situated in a beautiful place between the Andes and the Amazonian forest is renowned for its thermal springs (the hottest in Peru). Its church, dedicated to Saint Francis of Assisi, is made entirely of adobe adorned with a thatch roof. A small garden hidden behind a wall of bricks decorates the outside of the church.

The building was built for the United States Department of the Army in 1915‚Äì16, and is currently being used as the premises for the local museum in Deming. The armory was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1978 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History The building, designed by architect Henry C. Trost, was originally constructed as a National Guard armory. The building was the first armory to be built after New Mexico became a state in 1912. It was constructed to train soldiers to guard the border with Mexico during the ongoing Mexican Revolution. The armory served the New Mexico National Guard for 60 years. The building housed a chapter of the USO during World War II, in support of the men training at Deming Army Airfield. During the years that the building served as a military facility, it was also used as a community center for hosting dances, basketball games and other local events. Two events in 1976 contributed towards the launch of a campaign to acquire the Deming Armory as new premises for the town's museum. First, the National Guard vacated the building and moved to a new facility on the south side of Deming. Second, a local businessman, Hubert Ruebush, offered to donate his mother's old electric washing machine, the first such washer in Deming, to the museum. When Ruebush learned that the museum could not accommodate the washer in its cramped facilities, he donated $6000 to acquire the armory on the condition that his donation be matched through local fundraising. Ruebush's condition was quickly satisfied, and a delegation from Deming subsequently negotiated a selling price of $11,500 for the building with the State Armory Board in Santa Fe. Architecture The Deming Armory is an imposing red-brick building, two stories in height and resting on a raised basement. It comprises three bays along the front elevation, with a depth of nine bays, and pilasters divide the side elevations. The facade is characterized by decorative brickwork, concrete detailing, and a large central arch leading to double-leaf doors. The walls of the building are thick. Deming Luna Mimbres Museum The Deming Luna Mimbres Museum, also known as the Deming Luna County Museum, is operated by the Luna County Historical Society. The museum's exhibits focus on the everyday lives and history of area residents. Collections include Mimbres pottery, dolls and toys, glass, china, crystal, teapots, silver, copper and Depression glass, and saddles and ranching equipment. Other exhibits include period rooms, furniture, paintings, tools, clothes, Native American artifacts, gems and geodes, weapons, war memorabilia, vehicles and farm equipment.

It was developed by Big Ant Studios and published by Tru Blu Entertainment. The game was originally released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in various countries that compete in cricket in April 2014; it was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 11 February 2015. Its sequel Don Bradman Cricket 17 was released on 16 December 2016. Features The game features a number of different game modes, including a career mode, custom matches and online games. The career mode involves a user creating a player who starts off at 16 years old and plays for a career of up to 20 years. There is also a Cricket Academy program in which a user can create and edit teams, players and competitions. This was released as a stand-alone game before the console release date. The game contains the original cricket stats of every player and they can be modified too. Each cricketer face is created in a realistic way to experience a new feel. Big Ant Studios updated the academy and brought the 'Practice Nets' feature into it in the weeks prior to the launch of the full game. The gameplay features were announced as having \\"Unique Batting and Bowling Controls\\" with a full 360 shot delivery with no shot markers. The gameplay also involves a \\"Fully featured Fielding System\\" which allows \\"full control of the field\\". The Ball Physics in the game has been labelled as having \\"realistic edges and ball movement off players\\". Appeal and Electric Reviews have also been included into the game, which enables a user to challenge the umpire for a decision in which is questionable. There are Practice nets and Match practice which are new features to the game and are supposed to help a new 'cricketing gamer' to play the game. Users can also save games online and offline. The commentary team consists of Matthew Hill and David Basheer.http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2015774-don-bradman- cricket-14-release-date-features-and-game-preview There are 11 unlicensed grounds within the game, with 2 licensed. The game includes 79 teams within the game, most of which are unlicensed. There are international and domestic teams (current generation) historical teams and future generation teams. There are 17 international teams, 6 Australian domestic teams, 18 English domestic, along with \\"All time best\\" teams and \\"historical\\" teams.http://www.planetcricket.net/forums/ Development According to Ross Symons, CEO of Big Ant Studios, development of the game was hindered by the parallel development of Ashes Cricket 2013, an officially licensed rival cricket game. Symons claims that the developers of Ashes Cricket 2013 applied pressure via the Australian Cricket Board to warn various partners off his game, while the eventual poor reception to Ashes Cricket 2013 forced him to delay Don Bradman Cricket 14 as not to be caught up in the controversy.BIG ANT, BARE BUMS, AND DON BADMAN The game was built using a Big Ant Studios- built game engine written in Assembly language and C++. Soundtrack Reception Don Bradman Cricket 14 has received positive reviews from critics. Tristan Ogilvie of IGN rated the console version 6.8/10, praising the \\"comprehensive control setup\\" and \\"License-dodging player creation\\", but also criticized the high amount of bugs, lack of field radars and unrealistic super-fielders. However, the PC version was rated 8/10 by IGN, who later believed that the fixes made it in the interim turned it into \\"easily the finest and fully-featured cricket game ever made\\". Dene Benham of NZGamer gave the game 7.9/10, praising the batting and bowling aspects, but criticized the clunky menus and twitchy animations. Critical Hit awarded it 8.7 citing it as \\"the best cricket game of last generation\\".https://www.criticalhit.net/review/don-bradman- cricket-14-reviewed-again/ Sequel Big Ant Studios have announced on the planetcricket forum that they are currently working on a sequel titled \\" Don Bradman Cricket 17\\".

Trinidad and Tobago saw four major waves of migration from Portugal. The historical background to the first wave, which began in 1846, was an earlier influx of Azorean workers to British Guiana in 1834 following the British abolition of slavery the previous year, along with Scottish Presbyterian evangelism in Madeira in the early 1840s. Seeking to resolve labor shortages in Trinidad, the British government signed a treaty with Portugal covering contract labour migration from Madeira to Trinidad, following which the first group of 219 Madeiran contract workers arrived in May 1846, and then 773 more in the remainder of the year. Further migration, beginning in the 1870s, was spurred by a phylloxera infestation in Madeira. As a result, the Madeiran community of Trinidad grew to roughly two thousand by the end of the nineteenth century. The migrants comprised both Protestants and Catholics, though many of the Protestants later moved to the United States or Brazil. In the 1930s and again after World War II, there were two further influxes of Portuguese migrants. Migrants formed two major ethnic associations, the Portuguese Club and the Portuguese Association. Portuguese migrants in those years occupied an intermediate social position: physically they resembled the largely-upper-class migrants from other European countries, but in terms of socioeconomic class they were closer to African descendants and Indian migrants. As Miguel Vale de Almeida described it, \\"[n]either whites nor Blacks considered the Portuguese to be sociologically white\\". After 1960, exact statistics on the Portuguese community became unavailable because the census ceased to distinguish Portuguese as a separate group; they were thenceforth counted in the categories \\"Europeans\\", \\"Mixed\\", or \\"Others\\".

The goal of Nilsimsa is to generate a hash digest of an email message such that the digests of two similar messages are similar to each other. In comparison with cryptographic hash functions such as SHA-1 or MD5, making a small modification to a document does not substantially change the resulting hash of the document. The paper suggests that the Nilsimsa satisfies three requirements: # The digest identifying each message should not vary significantly (sic) for changes that can be produced automatically. # The encoding must be robust against intentional attacks. # The encoding should support an extremely low risk of false positives. Subsequent testing on a range of file types identified the Nilsimsa hash as having a significantly higher false positive rate when compared to other similarity digest schemes such as TLSH, Ssdeep and Sdhash. Nilsimsa similarity matching was taken in consideration by Jesse Kornblum when developing the fuzzy hashing in 2006, that used the algorithms of spamsum by Andrew Tridgell (2002).

Unlike the rest of the founders of Los Zetas, however, he did not serve in the Mexican Armed Forces before joining the drug trade. Criminal career Rogelio Gonz√°lez Piza√±a was born in Mexico on 1 March 1974. In the late 1990s, the Gulf Cartel leader Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, fearing his rivals, decided to form an elite armed squadron to protect him. The group, which became known as Los Zetas, was mostly composed of former members of the Mexican Armed Forces. Some of the members, including their founder Arturo Guzm√°n Decena (alias \\"Z1\\"), deserted from the Mexican Special Forces Grupo Aerom√≥vil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFE) to work for the drug lord. Gonz√°lez Piza√±a was the second-in-command of Los Zetas, just behind Guzm√°n Decena. The third-in-command was Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano (alias \\"Z3\\"). Los Zetas, under the command of the three men, led covert operations in northern Mexico to decimate rival drug cartel members and to consolidate the Gulf Cartel as the leading criminal organization on the Gulf of Mexico. Kingpin Act sanction On 24 March 2010, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Gonz√°lez Piza√±a under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with fifty-three other international criminals and ten foreign entities. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S. Arrest and sentence He was arrested by federal agents and members of the now-extinct Polic√≠a Federal Preventiva (PFP) in Matamoros, Tamaulipas on 29 October 2004. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison on 21 January 2014. Release On 30 August 2014, Gonz√°lez Piza√±a was released from prison. This occurred because a court in Guadalajara, Jalisco decided to change his original 16-year sentence given by a court in Toluca, State of Mexico with a new one. The new sentence was of 6 years and 3 days in prison (prison time he had already served since his arrest). Despite his release, the DEA still maintains an open investigation on Gonz√°lez Piza√±a for his involvement in drug trafficking and for threatening two U.S. federal agents in Matamoros in 1999.  Death  On 6 December 2015, Gonz√°lez Piza√±a was killed along with his family in Matamoros by suspected members of the Gulf Cartel.

It is no longer maintained. During its lifespan, this Linux distribution received some media exposure and was reviewed by Jon \\"maddog\\" Hall's blog at Linux Magazine and the Asturian newspaper La Nueva Espa√±a. Asturix used a triskelion logo, which is also used by an unrelated Linux distribution, Trisquel.  History  Asturix 1 RC 2 Asturix 2 Business Asturix 3 Asturix 3 showing the netbook launcher In 2008, Asturix was launched as AsturLinux. This name conflicted with an association of Linux users (the Asociaci√≥n de Usuarios de Linux de Asturias), so the project was renamed Astur GNU/Linux and later Asturix to avoid confusion. By early 2009, Asturix SO started to be developed. Until the third edition of Asturix, there were three versions: Business, Desktop and Lite. On 25 February, Asturix 1 Desktop was released, and one month later, the Business version followed. Asturix was officially presented to the mass media in October, in the Press Club Center of Oviedo. In November there was an Asturix Installation Party in the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party‚Äôs local building, the People‚Äôs House. That party was covered by a reporter from La Nueva Espa√±a. Asturix 1 was very similar to Ubuntu, and, consequently, it was criticized for being an ‚Äúunnecessary fork‚Äù. Asturix 2 was released in early 2010. The launch was covered by the regional public television, RTPA and La Nueva Espa√±a. A national radio broadcaster, Onda Cero,http://www.asturix.org/public/grabaciones/ondacero_asturias_20100216.mp3 and a regional branch of Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola, covered the story too.http://www.asturix.org/public/videos/medios/20100301_c24h.avi In April, DistroWatch included Asturix in its list of distributions and reviewed it. In April 2010, Asturix was a finalist for the Campus Party Europa Innovation Prize, an event which was covered by the regional branch of Cadena Ser.http://www.asturix.org/public/grabaciones/radio_asturias_20100418.mp3 Asturix 2 attracted attention from the Spanish Linux specialty media, including Linux +, Revista Linux and Todo Linux. At the same time there were groups of reviewers that claimed Asturix was only a \\"remastersys copy\\" of Ubuntu, and that it didn't justify media coverage. The third edition of Asturix was released in December 2010. There were only two versions instead of three: the main version (named SO) and the lightweight version (called Lite). The main improvements were the addition of face recognition to log in, the use of web apps (using Asturix Bridge) and Asturix's own apps, and some SO modifications. DistroWatch wrote a brief review about it. At this time, Asturix was presented in Madrid and Langreo (Asturias). In 2011, Asturix set up an official voluntary association, which was unveiled later and covered by La Nueva Espa√±a. In July, Asturix took part in the Campus Party Spain. Jon \\"maddog\\" Hall was interested in the project and a month later he wrote about it in his monthly column of Linux Magazine. He gave Asturix the last ten minutes of his lecture, in which Luis Iv√°n Cuende Garc√≠a (Asturix creator) presented Asturix On, a web-based desktop environment. Luis Iv√°n Cuende won the Hack Now contest (in the under-18 category), an award for the best app or \\"hack\\" sponsored by HackFwd, for the development of Asturix On, a desktop environment based on web technologies, which was implemented in Asturix 4. 20 minutos, a Spanish free newspaper, interviewed Iv√°n Cuende about this prize some days later and RTPA did the same. In November 2011, Asturix organized its first event, Youth and Free Culture with Open Source Software, sponsored by CENATIC (a governmental organization) which was covered by La Nueva Espa√±a and announced at the page of Creative Commons Spain. In January 2012, the final version of Asturix was released. It featured Asturix On and retained Asturix's own apps as found in the previous edition. Due to the addition of Asturix On, DistroWatch undertook another review and the editor, Jesse Smith, described it as a \\"mixed bag\\". It was reviewed by some blogs, including one English- speaking, Hectic Geek, though most were Spanish blogs, like Genbeta. Asturix was also featured on Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola twice in this period. Since then, no further development was made.

It follows an expedition team that becomes the target of a murderous humanoid octopus. The film received negative reviews from critics upon its release but has since developed a cult following. On Thursday April 18, 2019, the film was shown theatrically in the United States as part of the Rifftrax Live comedy series and then shown in an encore presentation on Wednesday, April 24, 2019. Plot A scientific expedition to a remote Mexican fishing community, led by Dr. Rick Torres (Kerwin Mathews) and Susan Lowry (Pier Angeli), discovers unhealthy amounts of radiation in the local waters. They find a small mutant octopus that can crawl on land, and Torres travels back to the States to present his findings, hoping to be granted more funding. Reception from the scientific establishment is lukewarm, so Torres makes a deal with Johnny Caruso, a circus owner who is interested in the bizarre mutation as a carny act. After their departure, a humanoid octopus, Octaman, attacks the camp and slaughters the remaining crew. The scientists return to the camp in an RV a few days later and find it abandoned. Davido, a young Indian man from the nearby village, says that a local legend about a creature said to be half man and half sea serpent is true, and offers to take the scientists to the lake where it is purported to live. Meanwhile, Octaman kills some villagers. The next day, the scientists find another small mutant octopus, and Octaman has gone to the camp and killed a crew member and escaped. Johnny, witness to the attack, decides to capture the monster for his circus. Octaman returns to the RV, but Lowry honks the horn to signal for help. The other scientists arrive and the monster flees. They go searching for it on the lake, and it pulls down another crew member out of their boat. When it reappears at the RV and captures Lowry, they blind it with their flashlights to stop it in its tracks, then light a ring of gasoline around it. The fire consumes enough oxygen that the monster suffocates and falls unconscious, and Lowry gets rescued. They finish the capture by tranquilizing it and trapping it under a net. In the morning, however, a thunderstorm brings rain which revives the Octaman and allows it to escape. It moves to seize Lowry, but she manages to communicate with it and send it away. Davido tracks Octaman into a cave. The others consider abandoning the pursuit, but Davido goads them on. Octaman chases them into the back of the cave, gaining enough time to block the cave mouth and seal them in. However, Davido manages to find another way out. They return to the RV, but find Octaman waiting for them inside. In order to spare her colleagues, Lowry communicates that she accepts to be captured. Now determined to kill the beast, the remaining expedition members arm themselves and pursue the pair, only for Lowry herself to shoot the creature at close range with a concealed handgun, allowing her to escape its clutches. The expedition members fire more shots at the creature, which retreats into the lake and sinks below the surface. Cast * Pier Angeli as Susan Lowry * Kerwin Mathews as Dr. Rick Torres * Jeff Morrow as Dr. John Willard * David Essex as the Indian * Read Morgan as the Octaman Release =Home media= Octaman was released on XXX X, 19XX on the VHS format by the European Video Corporation. A 40th anniversary widescreen DVD edition was released in 2012 by Bay View Entertainment. Reception Fred Beldin from AllMovie gave the film a negative review, writing, \\"Though the silly rubber suit affords the viewer a fair amount of yuks, Octaman is a cheap, sluggish vehicle that gets tiresome long before the monster finally gives up and dies, and bad day-for-night shooting renders many sequences murky and hard to decipher\\". On his website Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings, Dave Sindelar called the film \\"dull and repetitive\\", and complained that the film was too dark, making it difficult to see any of the action. Sindelar also criticized the film's lack of pacing, uninteresting characters, and design of the title monster. Dread Central gave the film a positive review, writing, \\"Octaman I recommend strictly for fans of old school monster movies and cult cinema, as well as bad movie aficionados, and even then there‚Äôs a part of me that suggests you be prepared to fast forward when things get bogged down with dry, talky dialogue and a needlessly long cave searching scene that only results in the characters ending up pretty much back where they started\\".

These are some of the ruins of the Hohokam structures which were unearthed and which are situated in the Pueblo Grande Museum & Archaeological Park. =The Joint Head Dam and canals= When the pioneers of European descent settled in Phoenix, the area was mainly desert. Settlers such as Jack Swilling were inspired by the ancient canals of the Hohokam. The pioneers soon began to dig ditches to carry water from the Salt River which would irrigate their farms. Eventually, canal building companies, such as the Arizona Canal Company, which was formed in December 1882, were organized and built the current canals in the area. The Joint Head Dam was built in 1884, where Jack Swilling dug his ditch, known as the \\"Swillings Ditch\\", and where the Salt River are located. The dam served the Grand Canal (built 1878) and eventually the Old Crosscut Canal (built 1888).

He also works as a newspaper columnist at El Peri√≥dico de Catalunya.  Biography  Espinosa was born in Barcelona, Spain, on 5 November 1973. At the age of 14, he was diagnosed with cancer and spent the next ten years in and out of hospitals. He lost a leg, a lung and part of his liver. Espinosa's memoir The Yellow World is an account of his battle with cancer.Hogan, Michael. \\"The Yellow World by Albert Espinosa ‚Äì review\\", The Observer, London, 28 October 2012. Retrieved on 25 October 2012. At the age of 24, he left hospital to train as an industrial engineer at Technical School of Industrial Engineering in Barcelona (ETSEIB), part of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. It was at this time that he began to write screenplays and act in television series for Televisi√≥ de Catalunya. The author of several screenplays and novels, he has also written and acted in plays and television series. He is also director, writer and stage actor in his theater company Pelones and a columnist for El Peri√≥dico de Catalunya. His work has been described as combining the fantastic, tenderness and humour. Espinosa's experiences of growing up in hospital have marked his creative work; \\"I always say that I have to live my life as well as those of my friends who did not beat cancer. I'm living 4.7 lives\\".  Career  = Beginnings = Espinosa began writing in his college years, at first by writing the plays the group performed, many of them Shakespearean-inspired (including texts and transcriptions of the actors' improvisations), others focusing on autobiographical themes (such as his play 'Los Pelones', premiered at the Riereta Teatre in Barcelona in July 1995, which was the seed of what years later would become his first movie script 'Planta 4¬™') as well as other works set in a university context, such as 'Un novato en la ETSEIB' After completing his studies, he formed with classmates and theater group ETSEIB the theater company \\"The Pelones\\" (referring endearing to the eponymous piece cited above, this group of pediatric cancer patients, all bald by the effects of chemotherapy, which was part Espinosa himself in his years of hospital stay), which even today is still active. = First jobs in television = Unlike the other members of \\"The Pelones,\\" Espinosa never worked as an engineer. After finishing his studies, his first paid screenplay (1998) was for a video that won the European Prize for Information Technology. He recovered fully from his illness (at twenty-four), thanks to the previous experience of writing short plays and scripts that he had acquired during his college years. He began working as a writer for television programs and contests, mostly for the Catalan producers, Gestmusic, an activity which he combined with his role as a playwright and as an actor in the theater company \\"The Pelones\\". Espinosa himself confessed that what he most liked was acting, but that he was only offered jobs as a television scriptwriter. That's why when he started working in television (his first program was the children's program Club Super3 for Catalan television), he set himself the challenge of changing jobs every six months to avoid burnout in a fast moving world. Then came a time that the author himself admits, he had doubts about whether to return to his other vocation (Engineering), his doubts were dispelled after working in Xat TV (1999‚Äì2000), one of the youth magazine 2 emitted in Catalonia definitely anchored him to the world of the screenwriter.

In this work, marked autobiographical, the author recounts with tenderness and humor, in a tone away from the drama and tragedy, the everyday experience in a hospital of a group of children suffering from cancer. The film premiered at festivals, was nominated for the prize for best film at the XVIII edition of the Goya Awards from the Academy of Arts and Cinematographic Sciences of Spain. Later, still trying to break into the world of film, television continued, with works like the script for the TV series Abuela de verano (Summer Spanish Grandmother) (2005), based on the novel Diario de una abuela de verano (Diary of a summer grandmother) writer Rosa Regas and starring Rosa Maria Sarda, in which he intervened in a supporting role (it was his first job as an actor and screenwriter simultaneous).

The game is a remake of the original 1990 Sega Genesis/Sega Mega Drive video game of the same name, which was the first title in the Illusion series of Mickey Mouse video games. The game was released on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows in September 2013, and later for iOS, Windows Phone, Android, and OS X. Gameplay Following the same style of gameplay as the original Mega Drive/Genesis title. Presented in high-definition 3D graphics, the game is largely played as a side-scrolling platformer like its predecessor, although some sections allow Mickey Mouse to move in multiple directions, such as puzzle segments. Mickey's main offensive ability is his bounce attack, which he can use to bounce on enemies and reach higher areas. He can also collect projectiles which he can throw at long distance enemies. Levels are re- envisioned versions of the original game's levels now separated into three acts, featuring new layouts, puzzles and enemies, as well as enhanced boss fights. The castle itself, which was merely a transition in the original game, can now be fully explored, with new areas opened up by collecting numerous gems littered around each level. Throughout the game, players can find playing cards and chilli peppers that can be used to unlock various outfits for Mickey. Plot As in the 1990 original, the game casts players in the role of Mickey Mouse who must fight his way through the Castle of Illusion to rescue Minnie Mouse from an evil witch Mizrabel who wants to steal her beauty. Obstacles include enchanted forests, rebellious toys and mazes of living books.Disney LOL Development and release The Castle of Illusion remake was teased by Sega in April 2013 and was announced later that month. The game was developed by Sega Studios Australia, their last game before the studio was shut down, under the supervision of the original game's director, Emiko Yamamoto. The game features a remastered soundtrack arranged by Grant Kirkhope, as well as an option to listen to the original soundtrack composed by Shigenori Kamiya. The game also features full voice acting for Mickey, as well as narration by Richard McGonagle. From September 2016 until March 2017, the game was delisted from the Steam, Xbox Live, and PlayStation Network stores. Players who pre-ordered the game on PlayStation Network were able to download the original Genesis game, as well as a theme and custom avatars. Reception Castle of Illusion received generally positive reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. IGN gave the game a score of 6.7, praising its presentation while critiquing its slippery controls and a short length. Joystiq gave the game 4/5 stars, calling it \\"both a great remake and a showcase for the key elements that make a great platformer\\". GameSpot gave the game a score of 7.0, praising its fun platforming while lamenting unskippable cutscenes. Official Xbox Magazine gave the game a score of 8.0, calling it \\"a fun update to yesteryear‚Äôs classic, but also a solid platformer in its own right\\". GamesRadar gave the game 3.5/5 stars, praising its presentation while noting some issues with controls on account of input lag for some televisions.

A major patron of poetry as well as a poet and commentator, his accession to the English throne in 1603 had profound effects on the patronage of Scottish literature and the Scots language Literature in early modern Scotland is literature written in Scotland or by Scottish writers between the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century and the beginnings of the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution in mid-eighteenth century. By the beginning of this era Gaelic had been in geographical decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language, confined to the Highlands and Islands, but the tradition of Classic Gaelic Poetry survived. Middle Scots became the language of both the nobility and the majority population. The establishment of a printing press in 1507 made it easier to disseminate Scottish literature and was probably aimed at bolstering Scottish national identity. James IV's creation of a Renaissance court included the patronage of poets, or makars, who were mainly clerics. These included Gavin Douglas, whose Eneados (1513) was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an Anglian language. James V was also a major patron of poets. George Buchanan founded a tradition of neo-Latin poetry. In the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots and the minority of her son James VI, cultural pursuits were limited by the lack of a royal court and by political turmoil. The Kirk discouraged poetry that was not devotional in nature but secular poetry survived. In the 1580s and 1590s James VI promoted literature in Scots. He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish court poets and musicians, later called the Castalian Band. David Lyndsay's The Thrie Estaitis (1540) is the only complete play to survive from before the Reformation. Buchanan was major influence on Continental theatre, but his impact in Scotland was limited by his choice of Latin as a medium. There were isolated Scottish plays, but the system of professional companies of players and theatres that developed in England in this period was absent in Scotland. The accession of James VI to the English throne in 1603 meant a loss of the court as a centre of patronage and he increasingly favoured the language of southern England. A number of Scottish poets accompanied the king to London, where they began to anglicise their written language. As the tradition of classical Gaelic poetry declined, a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge, often undertaken by women. The tradition of neo-Latin poetry reached its fruition with the publication of the anthology of the Deliciae Poetarum Scotorum (1637). This period was marked by the work of the first named female Scottish poets, such as Elizabeth Melville, whose Ane Godlie Dream (1603) was the first book published by a woman in Scotland. This was the period when the ballad emerged as a significant written form in Scotland. From the seventeenth century they were used as a literary form by aristocratic authors. After the Union in 1707, the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education. Allan Ramsay led a \\"vernacular revival\\" that laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature. He also led the trend for pastoral poetry and his pastoral opera The Gentle Shepherd was one of the most influential works of the era. Ramsay was part of a community of poets working in Scots and English. Tobias Smollett was a poet, essayist, satirist and playwright, but is best known for his picaresque novels, for which he is often seen as Scotland's first novelist. The early eighteenth century was also a period of innovation in Gaelic vernacular poetry that mixed traditional forms with influences from the Lowlands. Drama was pursued by Scottish playwrights in London. In Scotland drama was supplied by visiting English players and actors, but there were clashes with the Kirk. Ramsay was instrumental in establishing a small theatre in Edinburgh, but it closed soon after the passing of the 1737 Licensing Act. A new theatre was opened at Cannongate in 1747 and operated without a licence into the 1760s. Sixteenth century =Background= Andrew Myllar from The Porteous of Nobleness By the early modern era Gaelic had been in geographical decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language, confined to the Highlands and Islands.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 60‚Äì1. The tradition of classic Gaelic poetry survived longer in Scotland than in Ireland, with the last fully competent member of the MacMhuirich dynasty, who were hereditary poets to the Lords of the Isles and then the Donalds of Clanranald, still working in the early eighteenth century. Nevertheless, interest in the sponsorship of panegyric Gaelic poetry was declining among the clan leaders.J. MacDonald, \\"Gaelic literature\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 255‚Äì7. Gaelic was gradually being overtaken by Middle Scots, which became the language of both the nobility and the majority population. Middle Scots was derived substantially from Old English, with Gaelic and French influences. It was usually called Inglyshe and was very close to the language spoken in northern England, but by the sixteenth century it had established orthographic and literary norms largely independent of those developing in England.J. Corbett, D. McClure and J. Stuart-Smith, \\"A Brief History of Scots\\" in J. Corbett, D. McClure and J. Stuart-Smith, eds, The Edinburgh Companion to Scots (Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press, 2003), , p. 9ff. From the mid sixteenth century, written Scots was increasingly influenced by the developing Standard English of Southern England due to developments in royal and political interactions with England.Corbett, McClure and Stuart-Smith, \\"A Brief History of Scots\\", p. 10ff. With the increasing influence and availability of books printed in England, most writing in Scotland came to be done in the English fashion.Corbett, McClure and Stuart-Smith, \\"A Brief History of Scots\\", p. 11. The establishment of a printing press under royal patent in 1507 would begin to make it easier to disseminate Scottish literature and was probably aimed at bolstering Scottish national identity.P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), , pp. 26‚Äì9. The first Scottish press was established in Southgait in Edinburgh by the merchant Walter Chepman (c. 1473‚Äìc. 1528) and the bookseller Andrew Myllar (fl. 1505‚Äì08). Although the first press was relatively short lived, beside law codes and religious works, the press also produced editions of the work of Scottish makars before its demise, probably about 1510. The next recorded press was that of Thomas Davidson (f. 1532‚Äì42), the first in a long line of \\"king's printers\\", who also produced editions of works of the makars.A. MacQuarrie, \\"Printing and publishing\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 491‚Äì3. =Makars= James IV's (r. 1488‚Äì1513) creation of a Renaissance court included the patronage of poets. These court poets, or makars, who were mainly clerics included Robert Henryson (c. 1450-c. 1505), who re-worked Medieval and Classical sources, such as Chaucer and Aesop in works such as his Testament of Cresseid and The Morall Fabillis. William Dunbar (1460‚Äì1513) produced satires, lyrics, invectives and dream visions that established the vernacular as a flexible medium for poetry of any kind. Gavin Douglas (1475‚Äì1522), who became Bishop of Dunkeld, injected humanist concerns and classical sources into his poetry.T. van Heijnsbergen, \\"Culture: 9 Renaissance and Reformation: poetry to 1603\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 129‚Äì30. The landmark work in the reign of James IV was Douglas's version of Virgil's Aeneid, the Eneados. It was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an Anglian language, finished in 1513, but overshadowed by the disaster at Flodden that brought the reign to an end.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625, pp. 60‚Äì7. The seal of Gavin Douglas as Bishop of Dunkeld As a patron of poets and authors James V (r. 1513‚Äì42) supported William Stewart and John Bellenden, who translated the Latin History of Scotland compiled in 1527 by Hector Boece, into verse and prose. David Lyndsay (c. 1486‚Äì1555), diplomat and the head of the Lyon Court, was a prolific poet. He wrote elegiac narratives, romances and satires. George Buchanan (1506‚Äì82) had a major influence as a Latin poet, founding a tradition of neo-Latin poetry that would continue in to the seventeenth century.R. Mason, \\"Culture: 4 Renaissance and Reformation (1460‚Äì1660): general\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 120‚Äì3. Contributors to this tradition included royal secretary John Maitland (1537‚Äì95), reformer Andrew Melville (1545‚Äì1622), John Johnston (1570?‚Äì1611) and David Hume of Godscroft (1558‚Äì1629).\\"Bridging the Continental divide: neo-Latin and its cultural role in Jacobean Scotland, as seen in the Delitiae Poetarum Scotorum (1637)\\", University of Glasgow, retrieved 23 July 2013. From the 1550s, in the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots (r. 1542‚Äì67) and the minority of her son James VI (r. 1567‚Äì1625), cultural pursuits were limited by the lack of a royal court and by political turmoil. The Kirk, heavily influenced by Calvinism, also discouraged poetry that was not devotional in nature. Nevertheless, poets from this period included Richard Maitland of Lethington (1496‚Äì1586), who produced meditative and satirical verses in the style of Dunbar; John Rolland (fl. 1530‚Äì75), who wrote allegorical satires in the tradition of Douglas and courtier and minister Alexander Hume (c. 1556‚Äì1609), whose corpus of work includes nature poetry and epistolary verse. Alexander Scott's (?1520‚Äì82/3) use of short verse designed to be sung to music, opened the way for the Castalian poets of James VI's adult reign. Unlike many of his predecessors, James VI actively despised Gaelic culture.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625, p. 40. However, in the 1580s and 1590s he strongly promoted the literature of the country of his birth in Scots. His treatise, Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody, published in 1584 when he was aged 18, was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue, to which he applied Renaissance principles.R. D. S. Jack, \\"Poetry under King James VI\\", in C. Cairns, ed., The History of Scottish Literature (Aberdeen University Press, 1988), vol. 1, , pp. 126‚Äì7. He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish Jacobean court poets and musicians, later called the Castalian Band, which included William Fowler (c. 1560‚Äì1612), John Stewart of Baldynneis (c. 1545‚Äìc. 1605), and Alexander Montgomerie (c. 1550‚Äì98).R. D. S. Jack, Alexander Montgomerie (Edinburgh: Scottish Academic Press, 1985), , pp. 1‚Äì2. They translated key Renaissance texts and produced poems using French forms, including sonnets and short sonnets, for narrative, nature description, satire and meditations on love. Later poets that followed in this vein included William Alexander (c. 1567‚Äì1640), Alexander Craig (c. 1567‚Äì1627) and Robert Ayton (1570‚Äì1627). By the late 1590s the king's championing of his native Scottish tradition was to some extent diffused by the prospect of inheriting of the English throne.Jack, \\"Poetry under King James VI\\", p. 137. =Dramatists= George Buchanan, playwright, poet and political theorist, by Arnold Bronckorst Lyndsay produced an interlude at Linlithgow Palace for the king and queen thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540, which satirised the corruption of church and state, and which is the only complete play to survive from before the Reformation.I. Brown, T. Owen Clancy, M. Pittock, S. Manning, eds, The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: From Columba to the Union, until 1707 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , pp. 256‚Äì7. Buchanan was major influence on Continental theatre with plays such as Jepheths and Baptistes, which influenced Pierre Corneille and Jean Racine and through them the neo-classical tradition in French drama, but his impact in Scotland was limited by his choice of Latin as a medium.I. Brown, \\"Introduction: a lively tradition and collective amnesia\\", in I. Brown, ed., The Edinburgh Companion to Scottish Drama (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2011), , pp. 1‚Äì3. The anonymous The Maner of the Cyring of ane Play (before 1568) and Philotus (published in London in 1603), are isolated examples of surviving plays. The latter is a vernacular Scots comedy of errors, probably designed for court performance for Mary, Queen of Scots or James VI.S. Carpenter, \\"Scottish drama until 1650\\", in I. Brown, ed., The Edinburgh Companion to Scottish Drama (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2011), , p. 15. The same system of professional companies of players and theatres that developed in England in this period was absent in Scotland, but James VI signalled his interest in drama by arranging for a company of English players to erect a playhouse and perform in 1599.S. Carpenter, \\"Scottish drama until 1650\\", in I. Brown, ed., The Edinburgh Companion to Scottish Drama (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2011), , p. 21. Seventeenth century =Poetry= Having extolled the virtues of Scots \\"poesie\\", after his accession to the English throne, James VI increasingly favoured the language of southern England. In 1611 the Kirk adopted the English Authorised King James Version of the Bible. In 1617 interpreters were declared no longer necessary in the port of London because Scots and Englishmen were now \\"not so far different bot ane understandeth ane uther\\". Jenny Wormald described James as creating a \\"three-tier system, with Gaelic at the bottom and English at the top\\".Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625, pp. 192‚Äì3. The loss of the court as a centre of patronage in 1603 was a major blow to Scottish literature. A number of Scottish poets, including William Alexander, John Murray and Robert Aytoun, accompanied the king to London, where they continued to write,K. M. Brown, \\"Scottish identity\\", in B. Bradshaw and P. Roberts, eds, British Consciousness and Identity: The Making of Britain, 1533‚Äì1707 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), , pp. 253‚Äì3. but they soon began to anglicise their written language.M. Spiller, \\"Poetry after the Union 1603‚Äì1660\\" in C. Cairns, ed., The History of Scottish Literature (Aberdeen University Press, 1988), vol. 1, , pp. 141‚Äì52. James's characteristic role as active literary participant and patron in the English court made him a defining figure for English Renaissance poetry and drama, which would reach a pinnacle of achievement in his reign,N. Rhodes, \\"Wrapped in the Strong Arm of the Union: Shakespeare and King James\\" in W. Maley and A. Murphy, eds, Shakespeare and Scotland (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2004), , pp. 38‚Äì9. but his patronage for the high style in his own Scottish tradition largely became sidelined.Jack, \\"Poetry under King James VI\\", pp. 137‚Äì8. The only significant court poet to continue to work in Scotland after the king's departure was William Drummond of Hawthornden (1585‚Äì1649). William Alexander, statesman and author As the tradition of classical Gaelic poetry declined, a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge. While Classical poetry used a language largely fixed in the twelfth century, the vernacular continued to develop. In contrast to the Classical tradition, which used syllabic metre, vernacular poets tended to use stressed metre. However, they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex metaphors and role, as the verse was still often panegyric. A number of these vernacular poets were women,K. Chedgzoy, Women's Writing in the British Atlantic World (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), , p. 105. such as Mary MacLeod of Harris (c. 1615‚Äì1707). The tradition of neo-Latin poetry reached its fruition with the publication of the anthology of the Deliciae Poetarum Scotorum (1637), published in Amsterdam by Arthur Johnston (c.1579‚Äì1641) and Sir John Scott of Scotstarvet (1585‚Äì1670) and containing work by the major Scottish practitioners since Buchanan. This period was marked by the work of the first named female Scottish poets.T. van Heijnsbergen, \\"Culture: 7 Renaissance and Reformation (1460‚Äì1660): literature\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 127‚Äì8. Elizabeth Melville's (f. 1585‚Äì1630) Ane Godlie Dream (1603) was a popular religious allegory and the first book published by a woman in Scotland.I. Mortimer, The Time Traveller's Guide to Elizabethan England (Random House, 2012), , p. 70. Anna Hume, daughter of David Hume of Godscroft, adapted Petrarch's Triumphs as Triumphs of Love: Chastitie: Death (1644). This was the period when the ballad emerged as a significant written form in Scotland. Some ballads may date back to the late medieval era and deal with events and people that can be traced back as far as the thirteenth century, including \\"Sir Patrick Spens\\" and \\"Thomas the Rhymer\\", but which are not known to have existed until the eighteenth century.E. Lyle, Scottish Ballads (Edinburgh: Canongate Books, 2001), , pp. 9‚Äì10. They were probably composed and transmitted orally and only began to be written down and printed, often as broadsides and as part of chapbooks, later being recorded and noted in books by collectors including Robert Burns and Walter Scott.R.

From the seventeenth century they were used as a literary form by aristocratic authors including Robert Sempill (c. 1595-c. 1665), Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw (1627‚Äì1727) and Lady Grizel Baillie (1645‚Äì1746).Crawford, Scotland's Books, pp. 224, 248 and 257. =Theatre= The first page of The Assembly by Archibald Pitcairne from the 1766 edition The loss of a royal court also meant there was no force to counter the Kirk's dislike of theatre, which struggled to survive in Scotland. However, it was not entirely extinguished. The Kirk used theatre for its own purposes in schools and was slow to suppress popular folk dramas. Surviving plays for the period include William Alexander's Monarchicke Tragedies, written just before his departure with the king for England in 1603. They were closet dramas, designed to be read rather than performed, and already indicate Alexander's preference for southern English over the Scots language. There were some attempts to revive Scottish drama. In 1663 Edinburgh lawyer William Clerke wrote Marciano or the Discovery, a play about the restoration of a legitimate dynasty in Florence after many years of civil war. It was performed at the Tennis-Court Theatre at Holyrood Palace before the parliamentary high commissioner John Leslie, Earl of Rothes.C. Jackson, Restoration Scotland, 1660‚Äì1690: Royalist Politics, Religion and Ideas (Boydell Press, 2003), , p. 17. Thomas Sydsurf's Tarugo's Wiles or the Coffee House, was first performed in London in 1667 and then in Edinburgh the year after and drew on Spanish comedy.T. Tobin, ed., The Assembly (Purdue University Press, 1972), , p. 5. A relative of Sydsurf, physician Archibald Pitcairne (1652‚Äì1713) wrote The Assembly or Scotch Reformation (1692), a ribald satire on the morals of the Presbyterian Kirk, circulating in manuscript, but not published until 1722, helping to secure the association between Jacobitism and professional drama that discouraged the creation of professional theatre.I. Brown, \\"Public and private performance: 1650‚Äì1800\\", in I. Brown, ed., The Edinburgh Companion to Scottish Drama (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2011), , pp. 28‚Äì30. Early eighteenth century =Vernacular revival= After the Union in 1707 and the shift of political power to England, the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education.C. Jones, A Language Suppressed: The Pronunciation of the Scots Language in the 18th Century (Edinburgh: John Donald, 1976, 1993), , p. vii. Nevertheless, Scots remained the vernacular of many rural communities and the growing number of urban working-class Scots.Corbett, McClure and Stuart-Smith, \\"A Brief History of Scots\\", p. 14. Literature developed a distinct national identity and began to enjoy an international reputation. Allan Ramsay (1686‚Äì1758) was considered the most important literary figure of the era, often described as leading a \\"vernacular revival\\". He laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, publishing The Ever Green (1724), a collection that included many major poetic works of the Stewart period.R. M. Hogg, The Cambridge History of the English Language (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), , p. 39. He led the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the Habbie stanza, which would be later be used by Robert Burns as a poetic form.J. Buchan, Crowded with Genius: Edinburgh's Moment of the Mind (London: Harper Collins, 2003), , p. 311. His Tea-Table Miscellany (1724‚Äì37) contained poems old Scots folk material, his own poems in the folk style and \\"gentilizings\\" of Scots poems in the English neo-classical style.D. Dachies, \\"Poetry in Scots: Brus to Burns\\" in C. R. Woodring and J. S. Shapiro, eds, The Columbia History of British Poetry (Columbia University Press, 1994), , p. 100. His pastoral opera The Gentle Shepherd was one of the most influential works of the era. He would also play a leading role in supporting drama in Scotland and the attempt to found a permanent theatre in the capital.B. Bell, \\"The national drama, Joanna Baille and the national theatre\\", in I. Brown, The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: Enlightenment, Britain and Empire, 1707‚Äì1918 (Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 288. =Verse and prose= Ramsay was part of a community of poets working in Scots and English. These included William Hamilton of Gilbertfield (c. 1665‚Äì1751), Robert Crawford (1695‚Äì1733), Alexander Ross (1699‚Äì1784), the Jacobite William Hamilton of Bangour (1704‚Äì54), socialite Alison Rutherford Cockburn (1712‚Äì94), and poet and playwright James Thompson's (1700‚Äì48), most famous for the nature poetry of his Seasons.C. Maclachlan, Before Burns (Canongate Books, 2010), , pp. ix‚Äìxviii. Tobias Smollett (1721‚Äì71) was a poet, essayist, satirist and playwright, but is best known for his picaresque novels, such as The Adventures of Roderick Random (1748) and The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle (1751) for which he is often seen as Scotland's first novelist.J. C. Beasley, Tobias Smollett: Novelist (University of Georgia Press, 1998), , p. 1. His work would be a major influence on later novelists such as Thackeray and Dickens.Crawford, Scotland's Books, p. 313. Alan Ramsay, the most influential literary figure in early eighteenth-century Scotland The early eighteenth century was also a period of innovation in Gaelic vernacular poetry. Major figures included Rob Donn Mackay (1714‚Äì78) and Donnchadh B√†n Mac an t-Saoir (Duncan Ban MacIntyre) (1724‚Äì1812). The most significant figure in the tradition was Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (Alasdair MacDonald) (c. 1698‚Äì1770). His interest in traditional forms can be seen in his most significant poem Clanranald's Gallery. He also mixed these traditions with influences from the Lowlands, including Thompson's Seasons, which helped inspire a new form of nature poetry in Gaelic, which was not focused on their relations to human concerns. =Drama= Drama was pursued by Scottish playwrights in London such as Catherine Trotter (1679‚Äì1749), born in London to Scottish parents and later moving to Aberdeen. Her plays and included the verse-tragedy Fatal Friendship (1698), the comedy Love at a Loss (1700) and the history The Revolution in Sweden (1706). David Crawford's (1665‚Äì1726) plays included the Restoration comedies Courtship A-la-Mode (1700) and Love at First Sight (1704). These developed the character of the stage Scot, often a clown, but cunning and loyal. Newburgh Hamilton (1691‚Äì1761), born in Ireland of Scottish descent, produced the comedies The Petticoat-Ploter (1712) and The Doating Lovers or The Libertine (1715). He later wrote the libretto for Handel's Samson (1743), closely based on John Milton's Samson Agonistes. James Thompson's plays often dealt with the contest between public duty and private feelings, included Sophonisba (1730), Agamemnon (1738) and Tancrid and Sigismuda (1745), the last of which was an international success. David Mallet's (c. 1705‚Äì65) Eurydice (1731) was accused of being a coded Jacobite play and his later work indicates opposition to the Walpole administration. The opera Masque of Alfred (1740) was a collaboration between Thompson, Mallet and composer Thomas Arne, with Thompson supplying the lyrics for his most famous work, the patriotic song Rule, Britannia!I. Brown, \\"Public and private performance: 1650‚Äì1800\\", in I. Brown, ed., The Edinburgh Companion to Scottish Drama (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2011), , pp. 30‚Äì1. In Scotland a troop of English players came to Edinburgh in 1715 where they performed Macbeth and a series of Restoration comedies, but they soon left, perhaps because of objections from local kirk presbyteries. By 1725 English actor Anthony Aston, a friend of Ramsay, was performing in Edinburgh, but seems to have fallen foul of the Scottish Master of the Revels, who licensed plays, companies and playhouses, and soon left. In 1727 the Kirk attacked theatres as immoral in the Admonition and Exhortation. The Edinburgh Company of Players were able to perform in Dundee, Montrose, Aberdeen and regular performances at the Taylor's Hall in Edinburgh under the protection of a Royal Patent. Ramsay was instrumental in establishing them in a small theatre in Carruber's Close in Edinburgh,G. Garlick, \\"Theatre outside London, 1660‚Äì1775\\", in J. Milling, P. Thomson and J. Donohue, eds, The Cambridge History of British Theatre, Volume 2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), , pp. 170‚Äì1. but the passing of the 1737 Licensing Act made their activities illegal and the theatre soon closed. A new theatre was opened at Cannongate in 1747 and operated without a licence into the 1760s. References =Notes= =Bibliography= * Bawcutt, P. J., and Williams, J.

Biography  G√ºzin Akdemir, born in 1957, is a Turkish artist living in Adana, Turkey. She has been painting professionally for over fifteen years and is also a keen sculptor. She is a member of the Society of Painters in Istanbul and in Adana; two of the prominent painters' associations in Turkey. G√ºzin Akdemir predominantly concentrates on 'still lifes' and 'portraits of women', using oil on canvas or plywood. Women have always been her main inspiration and their calm, stagnant emotions hold sway over her work. Her work therefore harbors the complexity of their emotions, through their anxious, timid expressions and meditative, tranquil gazes. Expressions of women in the artist's portraits convey a variety of emotion, and onlookers could find deep glances, fractured smiles along with maturity. Some indignant or tearful, some hesitant and some reminding us of our own anxieties and questions. This recurring theme is a loving expression of women's inner worlds that reflect their passions, and perhaps also a resentful gaze. The onlooker witnesses their inner loneliness, surrounded by longing and societal pressures. The portraits convey hope but also reticence. Yet still, they carry a light air that surrounds us with a smile. The profile of this theme is predominantly well-groomed and educated, modern, middle class and individualistic. Often naive, but full of vibrant emotion. She continues to work in her studios in Adana and Istanbul.

It follows the pattern set by his previous successful painting, Belshazzar's Feast, being another depiction of a dramatic scene from history on a grand scale. The work was lost from sight in the Tate Gallery storerooms soon after it was damaged by the 1928 Thames flood but rediscovered there in 1973 and restored in 2011. The painting Unusually, Martin was commissioned to paint the subject by Richard Greville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, who paid 800 guineas. The painting is a monumental canvas by which depicts a view from Stabiae across the Bay of Naples towards the doomed cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum during the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79. The background is dominated by the apocalyptic scene of the erupting volcano Vesuvius, which casts a red light over the rest of the painting. Some buildings excavated at Pompeii, including the Temple of Jupiter and the amphitheatre, are visible in the middle distance. In the foreground are tiny figures of the citizens of Pompeii and Herculaneum fleeing, including the dying Pliny the Elder. Martin relied on the recently published Pompeiana (1819) by William Gell and John Peter Gandy for background information on the Roman town, and on Edwin Atherstone's 1821 epic poem The Last Days of Herculaneum, published with Pliny the Younger's letters to Tacitus on the eruption. Reception The purchasers of Martin's earlier paintings sent the paintings on tour in England as an advertisement for prints, to great commercial success, and Martin was determined to realise some value from his later paintings. The work was completed in 1822 and exhibited by Martin at the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly in 1822 to great public acclaim but mixed critical reviews (the hall had hosted the London exhibition of G√©ricault's The Raft of the Medusa in 1820). Martin sold a pamphlet explaining the composition. An article in the Morning Chronicle described Martin's painting as \\"the most extraordinary production of the pencil that has ever appeared in this or any other country\\". The exhibition received 50,000 visitors from March to July 1822. Martin subsequently painted a smaller version, by , which was sold to Sir John Leicester (later Baron de Tabley) in 1826, and which is now in the Tabley House Collection of the University of Manchester. Provenance The painting was added to the collection of the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos at Stowe House until at least 1838 and it was inherited by the 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos in 1839. It may have been displayed at Buckingham House in London before the 2nd Duke was declared bankrupt in 1847. Martin's painting was auctioned at Christie's in 1848 and bought by art dealer Charles Buttery for only ¬£100, and he sold it to the National Gallery in 1869 for ¬£200. It was sent on long-term loan to the Manchester City Art Gallery until 1918, when it was transferred to the Tate Gallery. By then, Martin was out of fashion, and the painting was consigned to a basement, where it was severely damaged by the 1928 Thames flood. Considered beyond repair, it was left rolled up and forgotten until it was rediscovered in 1973 by Christopher Johnstone, a Research Assistant at the gallery, when he was researching his book John Martin (1974). Johnstone found the damaged work rolled up inside the canvas of Paul Delaroche's painting The Execution of Lady Jane Grey, which had also been forgotten and lost. Restoration Martin's painting was cleaned and restored in 2010-2011 by Sarah Maisey, Clothworkers Fellow, and included in a major retrospective exhibition of Martin's work at the Tate Gallery in 2011‚Äì12. The original paintwork was in good condition, but a large area depicting the volcano and the cities - about a fifth of the whole - was missing. Maisey replaced the missing section, by drawing on photographs, Martin's smaller painting of the same subject, and an outline etching of the original, See also *The Last Day of Pompeii, 1833 painting by Karl Briullov References and sources ;References ;Sources * The Last Days of Pompeii: Decadence, Apocalypse, Resurrection, Victoria C.

Established in 1824, the school added the word Royal in 1836 and in 1872 it was taken over by Owens College, which later became a part of the University of Manchester.  Early years  Joseph Jordan (1787‚Äì1873) Medical training in 18th-century England, and especially outside London, usually involved an apprenticeship to unlicensed apothecaries. Study materials were few and learning was ad hoc, based on the cases being treated. As the century came to a close, there were attempts to introduce public lectures by members of what was then known as the Public Infirmary of Manchester ‚Äî notably Charles White and Thomas Henry ‚Äî but a formalised and structured course of study offered by a medical school did not exist until 1814. In that year, Joseph Jordan resigned from a doctor's practice to concentrate on providing lectures and demonstrations in anatomy from a house in Bridge Street. Jordan had been combining practice work with lectures since around 1812; his new venture had moved to larger premises on Bridge Street in 1816 and in the following year his school became the first provincial institution to be recognised by the London Society of Apothecaries as a teaching establishment for those seeking its licentiate. The standards at this time had been regulated by the Apothecaries Act of 1815 but a tightening of the requirements in 1817 caused the school to be de-listed. Recognition returned in 1821, when the Royal College of Surgeons of England also accepted the school as a suitable provider of education for its MRCS diploma. Jordan occasionally got into trouble both with the law and the general public due to his use of body- snatchers and even the direct involvement of himself and students in the surreptitious acquirement of suitable corpses for study. A map of Manchester city centre in 1894 The new school had challenged the medical establishment. Jordan's aim was to reduce the burden of costs that were placed on students who otherwise would have to go to London if they wanted to obtain a diploma from the Royal College of Surgeons or a licence from the Society of Apothecaries. As a side-effect of this, he thought that student morals would not be subjected to the licentiousness that he perceived to be present in London and that a provincial education would increase the number of doctors practising outside the capital. He arranged that his curriculum would comply with the requirements of the London institutions and thus it comprised a seven-month course of 140 lectures as well as lessons and demonstrations in dissection. He offered a formal, structured programme of study of a type unavailable outside the capital and the few universities that then existed, and he offered an alternative to the more commonly adopted process of medical learning that involved a long apprenticeship.  Competition  Thomas Turner (1793‚Äì1873) Although Jordan's School of Anatomy may have broadened the scope of its courses since foundation, it was not as comprehensive in coverage as that opened by Thomas Turner on Pine Street in 1824. Turner's Pine Street medical school was based in a former warehouse close to the Manchester Infirmary. It offered all of the courses demanded for the LSA and MRCS qualifications, rather than a subset of them, and it was based on his experiences in delivering occasional lectures at the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society (ML&PS;) since 1822 as he sought to promote his theories of medical education. Turner was able to call upon the support of previously cultivated contacts, including John Dalton and other members of the ML&PS;, and these people in turn attracted other luminaries. He is credited with \\"creating the first more or less complete provincial medical school in England\\" and his success was noted by others. Schools that emulated his were soon opened in others towns and cities, such as Sheffield (1827), Birmingham and Bristol (1828), Leeds (1830) and Liverpool (1834). In 1826 Jordan responded to Turner's challenge, which was creating intense competition both for students and staff, by moving his medical school to purpose-built premises in Mount Street. He now had facilities that were superior in size and equipment to those of Turner, and that included private dissecting rooms for use by qualified doctors. However, the attempt to recover lost ground was unsuccessful, in part because Jordan was not an easy person to work with and perhaps also because of objections to the introduction of his young nephew, Edward Stephens, as an instructor. In 1828, his staff deserted him to establish their own school on Marsden Street. Thereafter, the combined efforts of Jordan and Stephens could not match the range of courses offered by the Pine Street school, which had both more and better-quality staff. Jordan was now torn between his school business and his desire to be elected to an honorary surgeon's position at the Manchester Infirmary. He failed in an election of 1828 and again in 1833, although Turner had been successful in 1830. Among those opposing him were his former staff. Competition for the posts was tough and required influence with, and influencing of, both existing staff and people who subscribed the funds that financed the infirmary's work. Jordan determined to spend a lot of money in the next elections and to have the public support of Turner and his contacts. Jordan was successful in this effort, which arose upon the death of another surgeon in 1835, but it cost him, among other things, his Mount Street school. The school was closed and its students and library were transferred to Pine Street in 1834 as the price for Turner's future support.  Rationalisation  The Marsden Street school ‚Äî which involved some notable names such as George Freckleton, Thomas Fawdington, J. Boutflower and John Roberton ‚Äî had been innovative in providing the first medical jurisprudence courses in Manchester. An 1836 proposal for a joint venture with Pine Street came to nothing because of clashes of egos regarding who would hold what roles. The school closed in 1839 and passed its library on to Turner's establishment. That school had been renamed as the Manchester Royal School of Medicine and Surgery in 1836 but was commonly referred to as Pine Street School. It remained the only medical school in the city until George Southam opened one on Chatham Street in 1850. Southam's school proved to be stiffer competition than its predecessors. In 1856, both schools heeded a suggestion made by James Kay, the doctor and educationist, to approach Owens College with a view to a merger. E. M. Brockbank, a medical historian, says that \\"[Their] propositions apparently rather amazed the College people as being too one-sided \\\\- the schools giving too little and asking too much ... There were in the proposals, [the College] said, a request for space, for power of administration, and for a large portion of the income of the College.\\" Thus the idea was abandoned and, later in the same year, the two medical schools amalgamated. The teaching then took place at Chatham Street until 1861 while improvements were made to the Pine Street premises. Those improvements included construction of a more imposing frontage on the Faulkner Street elevation; when the Chatham Street premises were sold and teaching transferred back to Pine Street, the school address was advertised as \\"Faulkner Street behind the Infirmary\\" and it became colloquially known as the Faulkner Street school from then onwards. The courses offered during the 1860s and 1870s included physiology, descriptive and practical anatomy, chemistry, principles and practices of medicine and of surgery, pathology, forensic medicine and midwifery. Leo Grindon provided a course in botany and the Manchester Royal Infirmary was responsible for the teaching of clinical medicine and surgery. Discussions with Owens College re-opened some years later. The Faulkner Street premises were unable to cater for the demands of what had become the largest provincial medical school in the country. The College had continued to grow as the trustees of the estate of John Owens used the near-¬£100,000 legacy that had been obtained mostly by fortuitously selling his shares in railway companies around the time that \\"Railway Mania\\" was at its peak. The College had been based in Quay Street, Manchester, since 1851 but by the 1870s it was constructing larger premises at Oxford Road and as yet had no medical teaching facilities. Although there were concerns whether the new facilities could accommodate the medical schools also, these were alleviated by a timely donation from Hannah Brackenbury, a philanthropist who was also supporting causes such as the Ancoats Hospital. Turner was no longer active as a teacher but his long-cherished idea that his school should be a part of a larger institution of general learning came to fruition when it was taken over in 1872 to become the College's faculty of medicine. The Faulkner Street premises continued to be used until the new buildings became available in October 1873, shortly before Turner's death. Owens College, and its bought- in medical school, eventually became the Victoria University of Manchester.

Plot The book is set in a fictional mining town in Scotland in the early part of the 20th century, and it relates the struggles of a miner called Tam Docherty and his family. It opens with a prologue set in 1903 in which Tam's family and home are introduced and his wife Jenny gives birth to the youngest of her four children, Conn. Book One opens a few years later and provides a fuller introduction to the family. We learn that Tam is a lapsed Catholic while Jenny is a Protestant; we meet the eldest son Mick, the middle son Angus, the daughter Kathleen and her future husband Jack, as well as Jenny's father Mairtin and Tam's father, Old Conn, a devout Catholic. Tam has a hostile encounter with the Catholic priest Father Rankin. Kathleen marries Jack. Conn goes to school, where he is punished for fighting and using vernacular Scots. Conn knows of his father's respect for education, but \\"...against that went Conn's sense of the irrelevance of school, its denial of the worth of his father and his family[...].\\" This section of the novel ends with Conn entering puberty as he explores the countryside around Graithnock in the spring of 1914. In Book Two the outbreak of war has a very direct impact on the Docherty family when Mick announces that he plans to join the army with his friend Danny Hawkins. This is against the wishes of Mick's girlfriend May as well as those of both Jenny and Tam, who cites Labour campaigner Keir Hardie's opinion that it is \\"a capitalist war\\". Mick ignores their protestations and enlists with Danny, who is later killed in action on the western front. Mick survives but is badly wounded and loses the sight of one eye and his right arm. Meanwhile Conn scares his parents when he falls through the glass roof of the local mill. Kathleen has had a baby, Alec, and Tam tries unsuccessfully to impress on Conn the desirability of staying on at school instead of going down the mine, which is what Conn wants - although in fact Tam knows that the family cannot afford to do without Conn's earnings. At Christmas, Conn receives as presents from the rest of the family the clothing and equipment he will need as a miner: some time after this, Conn starts work at the pit alongside Angus and their father. Tam visits Mick in a military hospital and, on his return, with difficulty informs Jenny and the rest of the family of Mick's injuries. What has happened to Mick has a profound effect on Tam, who loses \\"the purpose of his own life\\" and starts drinking more heavily. Mick returns home and feels distant from his family; eventually he gets a job as a watchman at the mill. The war ends, and Mick shows no sign of elation but speaks cryptically of another, ongoing war. Book Two finishes with New Year 1920 being celebrated in the Docherty household with family and friends while Conn secretly has a sexual encounter with the much older Jessie Langley. As Book Three opens, Angus accosts Jack as he leaves work and accuses him of violently abusing Kathleen. Jack tells him it is none of his business and Angus punches him. Later, Angus informs Tam that he plans to move to a different pit and operate a squad of miners on a contract to the mine-owners. Tam sees this as exploitation, but Mick asks why Angus shouldn't take the opportunity to make more money and a heated quarrel ensues between Tam and Mick. Angus and Conn have been visiting dance halls and one night a visitor comes to the Docherty home, the father of Sarah Davidson,a girl who Angus has made pregnant. Tam assures the man that Angus will marry his daughter but Angus shocks Tam by saying he does not intend to. Conn and Mick have to hold Tam back from battering Angus. Tam tells Angus he can marry the girl or move out. Angus decides to move out and moves into a local doss-house. There has been a lock-out at the mine for eleven weeks and the miners are now going back to work for the same wages as before. Angus's wedding takes place, but he is marrying Annie, not Sarah. Tam refuses to attend the wedding. One evening some time later Tam returns home drunk and is baited by Mick to the point where Tam violently turns the table over, shocking everyone. Shortly after this a rock- fall in the mine traps Tam under a heap of fallen rock and kills him. His lifeless body is brought to the surface by his comrades. Typically Tam saves the life of another of the miners while losing his own. Jenny is distraught. Knowing Tam's rejection of religion, Mick and Conn decide against a religious funeral service and Jenny agrees, despite the horror of Tam's Catholic relatives. Conn tells Angus he wants to fight him because of what Angus had done to their father; Angus reluctantly agrees and the pair meet early on a Sunday morning for an intense but inconclusive physical battle that leaves them both exhausted. Mick tells Conn he has joined the Communist Party and tells him no ruling class ever gave its power away; Conn says he has no desire to 'smash' people, he just wants them to see how good people like Tam were. In the last chapter, a group of Tam's friends reminisce about what a good man he was.

The Karma Go hotspot is an open network that allows customers to share their connection with people around them. Each time someone joins, the owner of the Karma Go receives free data. Karma sells hardware and data to customers, which can be purchased through a monthly subscription or by pay as you go. There are no contracts. Karma Go runs off Sprint's 4G LTE Network  Services  In December 2012, Karma began providing free and paid wireless Internet services in the United States through wholesale Internet carrier Clearwire. Subscribers connect to Karma's services with a $149 mobile broadband modem. Karma provides 100 MB to new guest users for free while selling data at the rate of $14 per non-expiring gigabyte, and reward users who bring in more users by wirelessly advertising the service. When purchasing a Karma device, the first 100 MB of data is included for free. Karma offered an unlimited plan for $50 a month called \\"Neverstop\\" however, the company could not support this service and it ended after just 3 months of service. Karma now offers a service called \\"Pulse\\" which is similar to other hotspot companies. Users can get 5GB for $40, 10GB for $75 and 20GB for $140. Otherwise, users can buy 1GB at a time as needed, for $15 per 1GB.https://yourkarma.com/pricing  Controversy  Karma became a center of controversy in January 2016 over changing their Neverstop plan and cutting customers data multiple times. Some customers accused the company of using bait and switch tactics. New Customers were offered a refund for their devices, based on Karma's standard 45-day return policy. However, customers who purchased Karma \\"Go\\" hotspots with Neverstop, outside of that standard return period, were explicitly told \\"no refunds\\". Many customers also report not receiving refunds even within the standard return period. Karma offered a program called \\"Neverstop\\" where users got unlimited data at up to 5 Mbit/s for $50 a month. After 2 months, Karma blamed customers for \\"misuse\\" of the unlimited data service and began throttling users speeds from 5 Mbit/s to 1 Mbit/s. After over a week of throttled speeds, Karma changed the \\"Neverstop\\" program from unlimited to 15 GB for the same $50 price. Karmas website stated that they would give users 30 days notice if any changes occur. However, users were given no warning for the sudden change from unlimited 5 Mbit/s to throttled 1.5 Mbit/s then to a data cap of 15 GB. After just one month, the \\"Neverstop\\" service changed again and this time Karma decided to use a new program called \\"Pulse\\". Neverstop ended and Pulse became the new service for Karma users.  Network  Karma's first generation ran on Sprint's WiMax network which shut down in November 2015. Their second generation, Karma Go, runs on Sprint's 4G LTE network. Karma encountered some issues adapting to Sprints LTE network. However, after a long waiting period, they were able to fully convert over to the Sprint network. As of 2016, Karma has had to change a lot of their services due to high data usage from customers. Karma buys mass bulk data from Sprint and thus, can't support unlimited plans at this time. Karma has updated its services to stay on the Sprint network. Karma and Sprint still maintain a relationship as of 2016.

He directs one of the leading research efforts in ion traps and quantum optics. Monroe is the Bice Zorn Professor and a Distinguished Professor of Physics at the University of Maryland and Fellow of the Joint Quantum Institute. Beginning in January 2021, he will be a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Physics at Duke University.  Career  After receiving his undergraduate degree from MIT in 1987, Monroe joined Carl Wieman's research group at the University of Colorado in the early days of laser cooling and trapping of atoms. With Wieman and postdoctoral researcher Eric Cornell, Monroe contributed to the path for cooling a gas of atoms to the Bose-Einstein condensation phase transition. He obtained his PhD under Wieman in 1992 (Wieman and Cornell succeeded in the quest in 1995, and were awarded the Nobel Prize for this work in 2001). From 1992-2000, Monroe worked in the Ion Storage Group of David Wineland at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, CO, where he was awarded a National Research Council postdoctoral fellowship from 1992-1994, and held a staff position in the same group from 1994-2000. With Wineland, Monroe led the research team that demonstrated the first quantum logic gate in 1995 and for the first time entangled multiple qubits, and exploited the use of trapped atomic ions for applications in quantum control and the new field of quantum information science (Wineland received the Nobel Prize in 2012 based on this work). In 2000, Monroe initiated a research group at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where he showed how qubit memories could be linked to single photons for quantum networking. There he also demonstrated the first ion trap integrated on a semiconductor chip. With Wineland, Monroe proposed a scalable quantum computer architecture based on shuttling atomic ions through complex ion trap chips. In 2006, Monroe became Director of the FOCUS Center at the University of Michigan, a NSF Physics Frontier Center in the area of ultrafast optical science. In 2007, Monroe became the Bice Zorn Professor of Physics at the University of Maryland and a Fellow of the Joint Quantum Institute between the University of Maryland and NIST. There, Monroe's group produced quantum entanglement between two widely separated atoms, and were the first to teleport quantum information between matter separated over distance. They exploited this resource for a number of quantum communication protocols and for a new hybrid memory/photon quantum computer architecture. In recent years, his group pioneered the use of individual atoms as a quantum simulator, or a special purpose quantum computer that can probe complex many-body quantum phenomena such as frustration and magnetic ordering. His laboratory controls and manipulates the largest collection of individual interacting qubits. In 2015, Monroe co-founded the startup IonQ, Inc., and serves as Chief Scientist. From Aug 2018 to May 2019 he served as CEO. IonQ manufactures full stack quantum computers based on trapped atomic ion technology. In 2016 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences..

Facts Solicitor Louis Donald Diprose (the plaintiff/respondent) was infatuated with Carol Mary Louth (the defendant/appellant), whom he had met in Launceston, Tasmania in 1981. He showered her with gifts and, at one time, proposed to her; she, however, refused. Subsequently in 1985 the defendant informed the plaintiff that she was depressed and was going to be evicted and, if this happened, she would commit suicide (this was largely untrue). In response, the plaintiff agreed to buy her a house and, at her insistence, put it in her name. In 1988 when their relationship deteriorated, the plaintiff asked the defendant to transfer the house into his name. She refused and he brought proceedings seeking to recover the house. At the trial in the Supreme Court of South Australia, the court of first instance, the plaintiff won, with King CJ holding that for the defendant to retain the house and land would be unconscionable and thus the plaintiff was beneficially entitled to the land.Diprose v Louth (No.1) (1990) 54 SASR 438, Supreme Court (SA). The defendant subsequently appealed to the Full Court of South Australia again, however, the defendant lost on appeal, with Jacobs and Legoe J forming the majority and Matheson J dissenting.Diprose v. Louth (No.2) (1990) 54 SASR 450, Supreme Court (Full Court) (SA). The defendant then filed special leave for an appeal to the High Court of Australia, which was granted.

The variability in the star was discovered by Williamina Fleming in 1895 and published in the Third Catalogue of Variable Stars. The photographic magnitude range was given as 7.7 - 8.8, but the variability was described as \\"somewhat doubtful\\". It was later given the designation HV 52 in the Harvard Catalogue of Variable Stars. The General Catalogue of Variable Stars lists it as a possible semiregular variable star with a period of 180 days and a photographic magnitude range of 8.9 - 10.0. A study of Hipparcos satellite photometry found a small amplitude range of 0.2 magnitudes at a visual magnitude of 8.53. The distance of the star is poorly known. The revised Hipparcos annual parallax of 3.50 mas gives a distance of 900 light years. A study taking into account the variability of the star found a parallax of 5.57 mas, corresponding to a distance of 585 light years. It is an asymptotic giant branch star 330 times as luminous as the sun. Its spectral type varies between M4 and M7 as it pulsates. The star has been observed to produce 22 GHz water maser emission, although later searches did not find any maser emission.

Digital scholarship can encompass both scholarly communication using digital media and research on digital media. An important aspect of digital scholarship is the effort to establish digital media and social media as credible, professional and legitimate means of research and communication. Digital scholarship has a close association with digital humanities, often serving as the umbrella term for discipline-agnostic digital research methods. Digital scholarship may also include born-digital means of scholarly communication that are more traditional, like online journals and databases, e-mail correspondence and the digital or digitized collections of research and academic libraries. Since digital scholarship is often concerned with the production and distribution of digital media, discussions about copyright, fair use and digital rights management (DRM) frequently accompany academic analysis of the topic. Combined with open access, digital scholarship is offered as a more affordable and open model for scholarly communication. History Outlook According to Ernest L. Boyer in Scholarship Reconsidered, discovery, integration, application, and teaching are the four main aspects of scholarship.Pearce, Nick; Scanlon, Eileen; Weller, Martin; Ashleigh, Melanie. \\"Digital Scholarship Considered\\". In Education, p. 35. The growth of digital media means that the main areas of scholarship can each benefit from expansions in their own way thanks to the infinite sharability of digital content. In education, the main areas of relevance are science, technology, engineering and math. It is said that students learn best in a classroom when they are actively engaged. The emergence of digital scholarship and digital media allows for another means for students to become engaged. Key areas of academia that digital media is used on are to illustrate concepts, model displays and reinforce 21st century skills.Teachers' domain: digital media (including video!) resources for the STEM classroom and collection. 2010. Knowledgeable Quest, 39 (2). Critics cite concerns about the legitimacy, accessibility and verifiability of digital scholarship and the erosion of authors' rights as reasons to be concerned about digital scholarship. As scholarly communication evolves, controversy over the definition and value of the term \\"digital scholarship\\" is likely to continue. Digital scholarship must take all of cultural, economic, personal, and institutional responsibilities to take its position as academic scholarship and to realize the core purpose of higher education with the possibilities of our time. Intellectual property Concerns with how to regulate digital scholarship have arisen across universities across the world. The explosion in availability and creation of scholarly works has led many universities to adjust their policies on how they will manage scholarship in the future. These universities feel pressured to take action because digital technologies have led to the easy reproduction and commodification of these creations. Many universities are unclear how to address the copyrighting of online classes and media presentations. Current law does not cover these specific areas of media produced in the academic world. In the past any printed work done by professors was considered their intellectual property, but now the question stands as to who owns these different forms of multimedia. One of the main concerns of faculty is that universities will soon take ownership of this digital media. Universities have taken a growing interest in creations that have revenue-generating potential, like online classes or lecture slides, while also showing concern for products that may be used by comparable institutions, potentially reducing their competitive advantage. In order to stay on top of others academically, universities have sought to keep the intellectual property created within the university away from others schools. Not only are universities using digital scholarship to make money and stay ahead, but they also have interests in protecting their brand. While universities attempt to protect digital scholarship, it is in many professors best interests for their creations to be seen by the world as to grow their brand and acclaim as a professor. Laws that may apply to digital scholarship are largely outdated but professors would like to use the argument of faculty ownership of traditional works as historical practice and practice compatible with mission of higher education as a public good. Professors argue that it took time and serious effort to make the presentations, slides, media. To date professors have been rarely questioned whether they have the right to bring their course outlines, lecture outlines, and lecture notes with them if they decide to leave the university where they created them. Change over the ability of professors to bring digital scholarship with them is expected as universities have begun to take notice and assert copyrights. Professors will argue that since they are the creators and authors of the product they are the owners according to law. As of now most copyright laws in America indicate that the author or creator holds the copyright, but the same cannot be said for digital scholarship. The law explicitly states that if the work is within the scope of his or her employment then the work is the property of the employer. Since the employer here would be the university, professors are technically creating work for hire. While faculty of universities appear to not be credited for their work, the primary reason for a university to take ownership of a faculty's work is that the member created the work using university funds mostly. Solutions to the lack of clear laws regarding ownership of digital scholarship are not currently being created but many universities have created written contracts with professors over who owns future work or what they can do with previous work. For example, in the U.S. Supreme Court case Stanford v. Roche, the court decided that Roche, a former Stanford researcher, was a co-owner with Stanford of patents for testing kits to detect HIV. While this case does not deal with digital scholarship directly, it deals with the ownership of intellectual property of university employees when they leave. This case will set a precedent for future decisions with online classes, lecture notes, and outlines. NEA Policy The National Education Association (NEA), the largest professional educational association in the United States, updated its policy on digital learning in 2013. The policy stresses that students need to develop \\"advanced critical thinking and information literacy skills and master new digital tools,\\" as well as \\"the initiative to become self-directed learners while adapting to the ever- changing digital information landscape.\\" The NEA also believes that digital learning creates an environment in which learning can be more individualized to meet the needs of each student. The NEA mandates that all public schools must do their best to acquire necessary modern technologies and constantly revise teaching plans to incorporate technology where viable to best prepare students for the 21st century. The NEA's digital learning policy also states that technology must be used in an adaptive manner as to not become a distraction and to remain a tool, as well as that technology should not become a replacement for instructors, merely a supplement.

Maryland, United States. The park opened in about 1908 and was originally called Holyrood Park. In 1910 it was renamed Venable Park, after the recently-deceased president of the city park board, Richard M. Venable. The Baltimore Sun for April 14, 1922, indicates the park boundaries as Ellerslie Avenue to the west and Gorsuch Street to the south, cut in half by 33rd Street. A new stadium was to be built on the north side of 33rd. In 1922 the city built Venable Stadium on the site of the former park.Baltimore Municipal Journal, March, 1922 It gradually became known as Baltimore Municipal Stadium, or more commonly Municipal Stadium. Between 1949 and 1950 the stadium was disassembled/razed and replaced simultaneously on the same structural footprint by Baltimore's better known Memorial Stadium. Games continued to be regularly played in the venue during this period and aerial photos from the era reveal one venue gradually disappearing while another rises. After Memorial Stadium was razed in 2002, an apartment complex and playing field were built on the site. Some maps began to, after roughly an 80+ year absence, label a small grassy area adjacent to the apartments as Venable Park. The south portion of the park became the site for Eastern High School, which eventually was converted into a facility for Johns Hopkins University. The novel Venable Park was released in 2010 and was re-released in April 2015 by Loyola University Maryland's Apprentice House. The novel is set in 1924 in two primary locales, Venable Stadium and the former company steel town of Sparrows Point, Maryland.

He drafted the legislation that created the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), was one of the lead U.S. negotiators of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), served as Dean of the law school at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and spent the last two decades of his career at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University.  Early life and family  Bunn was born on May 26, 1925, in St. Paul, Minnesota, to Charles Bunn (lawyer and professor) and Harriet Foster Bunn (an author, noted particularly for children‚Äôs books such as Circus Boy). He grew up primarily in St. Paul and Madison, Wisconsin. Bunn studied electrical engineering in the Navy during World War II at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After the war, he studied physics, but after reading the Acheson-Lillienthal plan for nuclear disarmament and hearing some of the debate over civilian control of the atom, he concluded that global treaties would be needed to control nuclear weapons, and that lawyers would be needed to negotiate these treaties. \\"As a result,\\" he told an interviewer, \\"I went to law school to try and save the world from The Bomb.\\" He graduated from Columbia Law School in 1950. Bunn married the former Fralia Hancock (known as Bonnie, and later Li) in 1949. The couple had three children, Jessie, Peter, and Matthew. They divorced in 1972. In 1974, Bunn married Anne Coolidge (n√©e Anne Crosby). The two were married until 1994. Both of Bunn‚Äôs wives pre- deceased him.  Government and private practice career  After law school, Bunn worked for the then-new Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). While there, he drafted the order that desegregated all of the AEC facilities. He then went into private practice, with the firm now known as Arnold and Porter. While there, among other activities he defended several people accused of communist leanings in the McCarthy era and played a major role in the case that led to the desegregation of the restaurants in Washington, D.C. Active in Democratic Party politics, he was a delegate for Adlai Stevenson at the 1960 Democratic convention. During the 1960 presidential campaign, John F. Kennedy promised to create a new agency focused on arms control. On taking office, Kennedy appointed John McCloy, a key figure of the Republican establishment, to lead the effort. McCloy and his deputy, Adrian S. Fisher (known as \\"Butch\\"), hired Bunn to be the lawyer for the effort. Bunn drafted the legislation that created the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) and became ACDA‚Äôs first General Counsel (1961-1969). Bunn played important roles in the negotiation of the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 and especially of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968. Roland Timerbaev, one of Bunn‚Äôs Soviet counterparts in the NPT negotiation, reported that \\"our respective governments chose us to be the day-to-day negotiators of the NPT.\\" In particular, when there was a deadlock on verification provisions for the treaty ‚Äì which was on the verge of leading to a treaty with no verification provisions ‚Äì Bunn, Timerbaev, Vladimir Shustov, and Culver Gleysteen went on a hike in the mountains near Geneva and worked out a compromise (though negotiators on each side had been instructed not to change their positions). After some further negotiation, that compromise became the verification article of the NPT.Bunn described this episode in George Bunn, Arms Control by Committee: Managing Negotiations With the Russians (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1992). See also Timerbaev‚Äôs account in Timerbaev, \\"In Memoriam: George Bunn.\\" After the NPT was completed, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Bunn Ambassador to the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Conference (now known the Geneva Conference on Disarmament), where he served for the remainder of 1968. When Richard Nixon took office as President in January 1969, Bunn left the government and took a job as a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison law school.  Academic and non-government organization career  Bunn served as a professor at the UW-Madison law school from 1969-1983, and as Dean from 1972-1974. As Dean, he helped raise funds to substantially increase the size of the school, and established its first clinical program, in which students could learn to practice law by helping Madison residents too poor to afford lawyers with their legal issues. He worked with others to establish the first interdisciplinary program in energy and environment at the UW-Madison, now known as the Nelson Institute, after Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson. Late in life, Bunn provided a major gift that established the Bunn Distinguished Graduate Fellowship at the institute. With the advent of the nuclear freeze movement in the 1980s, Bunn returned to arms control. From 1983-1986, he was a professor of international law at the Naval War College, and then from 1986 until close to the end of his life he was a consulting professor at Stanford‚Äôs Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC). Bunn served on the Board of Directors of the Arms Control Association and was one of the founders of what eventually became known as the Lawyers Alliance for World Security (LAWS).Bunn's activities in this organization are described in John H. Downs, Negotiating with the Russians on Nuclear Arms Control: Lawyers Making a Difference (Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1997). In 2009, he received a lifetime achievement award for his work on nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation from the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute for International Studies.See \\"CNS 20th Anniversary Celebration: The Power and Promise of Nonproliferation Educationand Training .\\" Bunn was the author, co-author, or co-editor of three books: Arms Control by Committee: Managing Negotiations with the Russians (Stanford University Press, 1992) provides an analysis of how Presidents sought to develop approaches to arms control negotiations that would be acceptable with foreign adversaries, allies, contending agencies within their administration, and the U.S. Senate. U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy: Confronting Today‚Äôs Threats (Brookings Institution Press, 2006, co-edited with Christopher Chyba) provided an overview of debates over what policies the United States should follow with respect to nuclear deterrence, arms control, and the spread of nuclear weapons. Legislative and Administrative Processes (Foundation Press, 1976, co- authored with Hans A. Linde) was a casebook for teaching law students how the processes of developing and implementing legislation worked.

Plot  A young workman from Tuttlingen (then part of the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg) visited the cosmopolitan city of Amsterdam for the first time in his life and was impressed by a particularly stately home and a large ship laden with precious commodities. He innocently asked people about the owners of the house and the boat and both times the answer was \\"Kannitverstan\\", which means \\"I can not understand you\\". The simple-minded workman, however, believed that it was the name of a man called \\"Kannitverstan\\", and was impressed by the supposed Mr. Kannitverstan's wealth, and at the same time felt victimized in the face of his own poverty. Later in the day, he observed a funeral procession and asked one of the mourners who the deceased was. When he received the answer \\"Kannitverstan\\" he mourned for the late Mr. Kannitverstan, but at the same time felt very light-hearted, because he realized that death knows no social differences and everything in life is fleeting. Thus, the workman suffered his own poverty much better.  Origins  Kannitverstan is based on a true story. In 1757, the 17-year-old Count Adam Philippe de Custine traveled to Amsterdam and admired a beautiful country house and a great lady. He heard that the winner of the Dutch lottery was announced and observed a funeral procession. Curious, he asked for the names of these people and always got the answer, \\"Ik kan niet verstaan\\". The young Count believed then that there existed a \\"Mr. Kannitverstan\\". Some time later he saw the lady again, and he offered his condolences for the death of her husband, Mr. Kannitverstan. This led to great laughter but eventually the misunderstanding was clarified. This hilarious episode appeared in written form for the first time in 1782 in the essay collection Les num√©ros by Charles Peyssonel and was reprinted in 1783 in German in Luzernischen Wochenblatt.  Reception  In the literature, Kannitverstan is regarded as a narrative whose key message is clear to all readers: Every man should be content with what he has and what he is, because in the end death overcomes everyone, whether rich or poor. However, the belief that this was the guiding principle is not shared unanimously by everyone. The jocular nature of the story is often pointed out and readers are asked to not take the story and its message too seriously. Even during Hebel's lifetime, some of his stories from Rheinl√§ndischer Hausfreund were included in German textbooks. Kannitverstan still widely appears in textbooks today because of its easily accessible core message and its humorous style which is appropriate for school curricula.

An EDUindex Gap Analysis provides missing, relevant curriculum relative to employment opportunity within a representative area. Representative areas may include geographic regions, states, cities, school districts or specific schools. Analysis is regularly conducted using zip code sets. In 1918, John Franklin Bobbitt said that curriculum, as an idea, has its roots in the Latin word for horse race-course, explaining the curriculum as the course of deeds and experiences through which children become the adults they should be, for success in adult society. EDUindex, Inc. developed the EDUindex to identify and promote relevance in education. The EDUindex is a correlation of curricular subjects taught in a particular school to skills as suggested by a pre-defined or custom selected target marketplace. Published class offerings represent the skills taught. The Classification of Secondary School Courses (CSSC) provides a general inventory of courses taught nationwide in the secondary school level (grades 9 through 12). Further detail is provided by High School Transcript Studies provided by the National Center for Education Statistics. Public, Charter, and Private School listings are accessed per geographical area to create a comprehensive data set of all schools and businesses within the analytical focus. Curriculum per School, District, etc. is published individually and is publicly available. Standard databases like the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) provide defined business focus. Business focus can be further refined into specific occupations and skill sets using Standard Occupational Classification System (SOC). Together these datasets provide information representing the skills offered and the occupational opportunities available within the designated target area. The EDUindex, as a value, is expressed as a number from 0 to 1.0 with 1.0 representing a perfect match of curricular offering to target need. The value is determined using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (sometimes referred to as the PMCC, and typically denoted by r) as a measure of the correlation (linear dependence) between two variables X and Y, giving a value between +1 and ‚àí1 inclusive. It is widely used in the sciences as a measure of the strength of linear dependence between two variables. It was developed by Karl Pearson from a similar but slightly different idea introduced by Francis Galton in the 1880s. The general correlation coefficient is sometimes called \\"Pearson's r.\\" The EDUindex calculates Pearson‚Äôs r for educational relevance by comparing the content of course offerings with the need for related skill sets within the same banded geographic area. Correlative results are weighted based on data volume for Scalar, comparative and presentation purposes.

In an ideal transaction, libraries provide the patron with access to search engines, academic databases and/or library catalogs from which the patron can request items. When certain thresholds are reached for an item (e.g., number of pages read or number of requests), the library purchases the item and delivers instant access to patrons. The library may acquire the resource permanently, or acquire a license to use the resource only at certain times or in certain ways. Since content purchased is in digital format, \\"PDA emphasizes collecting for and at the moment of need\\" instead of collecting with a long-term focus. PDA is frequently associated with e-book collections, although print and hybrid PDA options also exist. There are several benefits to focusing this practice on the use of digital content: delivery is instantaneous; e-books require no physical space, which requires specific costs to maintain; libraries can afford patron access when they might not be able to afford to buy materials, increasing the collection's ability; and purchases are guaranteed usage, which is an important consideration when purchasing materials. Interfaces Libraries typically index ebooks that are available for purchase in their catalogs or discovery layers. Libraries may limit their indexing to items with certain pricing, available licensing options, topics, publishers, and/or to items that the library does not already make available in a different format. Some libraries choose a PDA interface in which patrons are unaware that they are causing an ebook to be purchased, to avoid purchases that are not be immediately needed and to encourage patrons who would not otherwise initiate a purchase. The University of Iowa reported that this type of system, when unmediated by library collection development staff, can lead to a very high level of purchases.

Early life Lo was born in 1933 in Hong Kong. During the Qing dynasty in Guangdong, Foshan, members of the Lo (Lu) family were government officials, as were many of their ancestors in many generations. Thus, the Lo family lived in the housing provided to government officials which were guarded by the Qing Green Standard Army. The lobby of this Lo family residence has pair of royal plaques bestowed by Emperor of the Qing dynasty. During the two major wars in China (the First and Second Sino-Japanese Wars), everything was destroyed. Owing to this, Lo family members temporarily stayed with the younger brother of Yip Man, Yip Ten, in his large mansion in Mulberry Garden. After the war, the Lo family moved back to Hong Kong.  Study under Yip Man in Hong Kong  After Ip Man moved back to Hong Kong in 1949, he taught Wing Chun in the office of the Kowloon Hotel Union. It was at that time that Lo Man Kam started to learn from his uncle Yip Man. When Lo first started to learn Wing Chun in Hong Kong, there were only 5-7 students of Yip Man, including senior disciple Leung Sheung, Lok Yiu, Chu Shong-tin, Chan Kau, and little brother Yip (who was 13 years old at the time).  Life and career in Taiwan  Lo was encouraged by Yip Man to teach in Taiwan before he moved to Taiwan in the 1960s. When Lo first moved to Taiwan, he underwent special military academy training. After graduation, Lo was appointed to work at the Ministry of National Defense in Taiwan. In 1975, he retired as a Major and opened his Wing Chun Kung Fu school in Neihu, Taipei, Taiwan. Immediately after opening the school, he had students named Daniel Duby (from Reunion) and James (from Madagascar). These students were the first foreign disciples to participate in the \\"Bai Si Lai\\" (Ceremony to honor the Sifu and to be accepted as an official disciple) in the Taiwanese wushu community. In 1990, due to a speech given by Lo, the Taiwan Special Police Force First Corps leader Dr. Lu, who recognized the value of Lo's talent, appointed him to be a Taiwan Special Police Force instructor. In 1992, when the Republic of China-Taiwan started its first SWAT team, Lo was appointed to be the first SWAT team head instructor. In 1993, Dr. Lu from the Special Police Force got promoted to the principal of the Taiwan Police College. Lo then joined him at the Police College and continued teach and train future police officers and training instructors. Lo also helped the Police College by authoring the text book ‚ÄúPolice Kung Fu‚Äù, which focuses on hand-to-hand combat techniques. This book has been translated to English and sold in the US and later translated to Russian as well. At this time, director of Taiwan National Security Bureau had appointed Lo to teach Taiwan CIA hand- to-hand combat training, and also to write Bureau of Investigation teaching materials. Lo worked as training instructor for the Taiwan National Security Bureau 10 years. Lo also helped the Taiwan Judicial Yuan (Department) by authoring material for the Judicial police hand book and other training material, as well as serving as Taiwan Judicial Yuan training instructor. Lo's position at the Police College, beginning with the term of Principle Dr. Lu, and continuing through the term of 5 other principals, lasted 18 years. Every now and then, he is invited back to give special training lessons.  Students and Legacy  Lo with his first foreign students, in 1975 In terms of family legacy of Wing Chun Kung Fu, Lo's son Gorden Lu, has been teaching Wing Chun in Virginia Beach in the United States for more than 10 years. Students of Lo Man Kam from many parts of the world such as Europe, New Zealand, Australia, the US and many other countries have come all the way to Taiwan to enter the door of the Lo Man Kam Wing Chun Kung Fu family. Many of Lo's students have themselves become Sifu, and are teaching the 3rd generation of students in the Lo Man Kam lineage. The Lo Man Kam Wing Chun Kung Fu Federation has students and schools in more than 40 countries, in Europe, North and South America, Asia, Africa and Australia. Also Lo Man Kam lead the Federation in Taiwan and created many Associations in other countries. The European countries and their Associations found the European Association as their common leadership. Lo Man kams son Gorden Lu is the president and Los long time student Marc Debus is vicepresident of that organisation.

Survey history =Squier and Davis: 1845= The site was surveyed in 1845 by Ephraim George Squier and Edwin Hamilton Davis. They reported about their survey in their 1848 publication, Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley. They describe the site as consisting of a \\"wall and an outer ditch, which constitute three sides of a parallelogram. The fourth side is protected by a natural bank or bluff, 70 feet high, and so steep as to admit of no ascent, except at one point where it has been gullied by the flow of water.\\" A survey map of the site in 1846, by Squier and Davis and featured in Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley They surveyed the three walls as measuring at six feet high with 40 foot bases. The ditches were noted as being five feet by 40 feet wide. The eastern wall was reported as having a ditch that traveled for two-thirds of its length. This ditch was measured at ranging from eight to ten feet deep. The eastern wall itself was 1,400 feet long. The other built walls, the northern and southern walls, were both the same size, measuring in at 1,050 feet in length. They were placed on right angles. The south ended at the hill and the north stopped 25 feet from the southern wall. Squier and Davis believed that a fourth wall may have been built, only to have been destroyed by the natural elements. Two entrances were noted, one on the north side and the other on the south side, each placed in the center of each side. They describe a four foot tall \\"elevated square\\" as \\"covering the northern gateway and two hundred feet interior to it.\\" The square is noted as being 250 feet by 150 feet wide. They compare the square to the pyramids located at the Marietta Earthworks. Squier and Davis described parallel walls, 300 feet away from the main site. The walls were measured at 870 feet in length and 70 feet apart from each other. The two walls merge and lack ditches. The two men noted that the walls were partially destroyed by the Chillicothe Turnpike that passed through the site. The undisturbed parts of the walls, which were in forested areas of the site, were two to three feet high. They surveyed, a third of a mile south of the main work, a truncated pyramid along with a small circle. The pyramid is measured at 120 feet square at the base and nine feet tall. The pyramid's location matches the cardinal directions. They excavated the pyramid, and no remains were found. The circle is measured at 250 feet in diameter with a gateway on the south side of it. The gateway is 30 feet wide. There is a ditch inside the circle and an embankment, which almost matches the height of the circle wall on the side without the gateway. Squier and Davis note that they have seen this type of build in other works, but do not name which sites. This type of partially open circle would be described, by contemporary archaeologists as being a \\"C-form\\" earthwork. They compliment the location of the pyramid and circle as having a \\"fine view\\" of the river and being \\"well chosen,\\" by the builders. They believed that the land that the square and circle works were built on was intentionally smoothed out by the builders. They did note that they discovered \\"inconsiderable remains, consisting of small, low terraces, and little mounds and circles.\\" No additional major mounds were discovered on the site. Upon completion of their survey, Squier and Davis could not easily determine the use of the earthworks. They believed that the main works appeared to be fortifications. However, the large gateways on the site were \\"hardly consistent with the hypothesis of military origin.\\" The men reported that there must have been some type of significance in the placement of walls, suggesting that the space was used for \\"celebration of certain games\\" or religious ceremony. =A casual analysis: Ohio Historical Society, 1902= The Ohio Historical Society reported its findings on excavations at the site in the 1902 book, Arch√¶ological History of Ohio: The Mound Builders and Later Indians by Gerard Fowke. Fowke notes that when the site was built, the river most likely flowed high enough to be at the edge of the earthworks. He noted young white oak being found at the site and that, as of the time of publishing, no other excavations had taken place since Squier and Davis visited the site in 1845. Based on casual observation, Fowke noted that the \\"south wall had been worn away,\\" but it is unknown what happened. He suggested that perhaps the river washed away the loose soil and gravel that the wall was built upon, causing it to fall apart. He also noted that the river was \\"much further away,\\" than at the time Squier and Davis had visited. He theorizes that a ditch near \\"Prairie Run\\" may have been one source for the soil used to build the works. He cites cultivation as the source of the walls being destroyed in most areas, showing a considerable change from the time that Squier and Davis had been there in 1845. He also states that the pyramid that Squier and Davis describe was described incorrectly by them. Fowke states that the grounds were not purposefully smoothed out by the builders, and that the ground is naturally like that and that the ground is no more special than the ground that surrounds it without works built upon it.

This bacterium is Gram-negative, microaerophilic, urease-positive, and spiral-shaped. Its type strain is CS1T (= ATCC 49179T). It can be pathogenic. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is by far the best known Helicobacter species primarily because humans infected with it may develop gastrointestinal tract diseases such as stomach inflammation, stomach ulcers, doudenal ulcers, stomach cancers of the non-lymphoma type, and various subtypes of extranodal marginal zone lymphomass, e.g. those of the stomach, small intestines, large intestines, and rectumn. H. pylori is also associated with the development of bile duct cancer and has been associated with a wide range of other diseases although its role in the development of many of these other diseases requires further study. Humans infected with H. felis may also develop some of the same gastrointestinal diseases viz., stomach inflammation, stomach ulcers, duodenum ulcers, stomach cancers that are not lymphomas, and extrnodal marginal B cell lymphomas of the stomach. Other non-H. pylori Helicobacter species that are known to be associated with these gastrointestinal diseases are Helicobacter bizzozeronii, Helicobacter salomonis, Helicobacter suis, and Helicobacter heilmannii s.s. Because of their disease associations, these four Helicobacter species plus H. felis are often group together and termed Helicobacter heilmannii sensu lato. H. felis bacteria are detected in the stomachs of their natural hosts viz.,cats, dogs, rabbits, and cheetahs. Reports suggest that individuals, including children, are infected with this bacterium by having close contact with one of these infected animals: H. heilmanni s.l.-associated diseases, including those associated with H. felis, appear to be zoonotic diseases, i.e. infectious diseases that are caused or promoted by a pathogen(s) that spreads from animals to humans. It is important to diagnose H. felis as well as other Helicobacter heilmannii sensu lato infections in patients with the cited upper gastrointestinal tract diseases, including in particular extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of the stomach, because some of them have been successfully treated and cured using antibiotic-based drug regimens (e.g.amoxicillin, clarithromycin, plus a proton pump inhibitor or metronidazole, clarithromycin, plus a proton pump inhibitor) directed against the instigating bacterium.

Discovery  Thermotoga neapolitana was discovered in 1985 in Lucrino, Italy in a hotspring environment by Shimshon Belkin, Carl. O Wirsen, and Holger W. Jannasch of the University of California, Berkeley.  Habitat and Environmental Conditions  Thermotoga neapolitana is considered thermophilic with a livable temperature range of 50‚Äì95 ¬∞C. The optimum temperature was found to be 77 ¬∞C, making it nearly hyperthermophilic. There is also evidence that it could be found in saline environments, due to its ability to thrive in moderately halophilic environments.  Physical properties  Thermotoga neapolitana is a rod-shaped, Gram-negative bacterium. It is distinguishable by a thick periplasmic cell wall. Generally, they are found to be 0.2‚Äì5 Œºm, but they may reach sizes of up to 100 Œºm. It is non- sporulating - this along with its rod-shape and Gram-negative features are characteristic of the Order Thermotogales. Thermophilic Adaptations Using a guar-gum based medium, Œ≤-mannanase, Œ≤-mannosidase, Œ±-galactosidase have been purified. These galactomannans are associated with allowing an organism to endure harsh environments (through stabilization of the membrane), such as high temperatures. These enzymes help provide simple saccharides to the organism. Polymers similar to those degraded by T. neopolitana are often used as storage polymers by plants. This may show that as the geothermal environments in which this organism is found have changed and biodiversified, so might the metabolism of this hyperthermophile.  Growth and Metabolic Activity  Thermotoga neapolitana is strictly heterotrophic for its metabolic needs. It can also facultatively reduce elemental sulfur to hydrogen sulfide. In growth experiments, it was found to multiply rapidly with glucose and yeast abstract. After 24 hours of growth, the longest rods divide into two rods, most likely in response to decreases levels of glucose availability. Glucose, sucrose, lactose, and starch nutrients all support growth when used as a sole source of energy. Low level of growth occurred with exposure to only peptone or tryptone. Thermotoga neapolitana is unable to metabolize acetate, lactate, formate, pyruvate, propionate, mannitol, ethanol, methanol, glycerol, glutamate, or glycine. Chloramphenicol, vancomycin, streptomycin were all found to completely inhibit growth, though it was resistant to rifampin. Growth can be found within a 0.25-6% NaCl range exclusively, with no survival outside of this limit. It was originally thought to be strictly anaerobic, but can also survive under micro-aerophilic environments.  Sulfur Usage  Thermotoga neapolitana can facultatively reduce elemental sulfur to hydrogen sulfide. This allows for heightened reproductive rates of the organism - up to four-fold with elemental sulfur availability. This process requires the availability of a utilizable carbon source. Sulfuric acid and thiosulfate cannot be used for reduction. The presence of sulfide acts to inhibit growth of the organism. In a concentration of 10 mM, sulfide will inhibit growth by up to 95%.  Hydrogen Production  Thermotoga neapolitana shows promise as a useful bacterium due to its hydrogen production. It is capable of producing upwards of 25‚Äì30% oxygen in the space it occupies when tested. The other notable gas it produces is carbon dioxide at a level of 12‚Äì15% of the total headspace. Despite different levels of hydrogen production under varying conditions, the hydrogen gas to carbon dioxide ratio is approximately 2:1. The hydrogen produced is considered extremely clean with a carbon monoxide level in the headspace of less than 50 parts per million. This may be promising from a bioengineering standpoint as hydrogen gas is commonly sought after as a possible alternative to fossil fuel burning for energy consumption. Though originally thought to be strictly anaerobic, Thermotoga neapolitana is more efficient in its catabolic pathways, especially its hydrogen production, when there are low levels of oxygen available (slightly above 10% total composition) in comparison to anoxic environments.  Genomic properties  Thermotoga neapolitana shows a DNA base composition of 41.3% Guanine + Cytosine(and therefore 58.7% Adenine + Thymine). Using DNA-DNA hybridization, T. neapolitana was found to have a 74% homology with Thermotoga thermarum. T. neapolitana is also closely related to Thermotoga maritima, which was also discovered in geothermal environment. The ino1 gene is present in T. neapolitana. Most eukaryotes possess this gene, and it sometimes expressed to produce the rare osmolyte di-miyo-inositol 1,1' phosphate (DIP). This is linked to hyperthermilic tendencies because it protects the organism from high temperatures and salinities. The osmolyte may link T. neapolitana as well as other members of Thermotoga to Archaeans and Aquificales, the only other groups in which it is found.

He finished in sixth place for five at-large seats in the general election held on March 3, 1964. Early life Jack is descended within the United States from an Irishman, Patrick Jack, who operated a tavern in Charlotte, North Carolina, prior to the American Revolution. Jack's father, George Whitfield Jack, Sr., a native of Natchitoches, Louisiana and a graduate of Tulane University Law School, was an educator-turned-lawyer who served in Shreveport from 1917 until his death in 1924 as a judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. He was appointed to the bench by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson.  Career  Following his father's steps, he also received a law degree from Tulane University Law School after completing his undergraduate at Centenary College of Louisiana.  Career  Wellborn Jack practiced law with his brother, George Whitfield Jack, Jr., who served as a colonel under General Matthew B. Ridgeway in World War II. He later founded the law firm, Jack & Jack, with his son, Wellborn Jack, Jr. (born 1936). Jack, Jr., a specialist in employment and labor law, recalls that his father had little interest in genealogy and said, \\"What matters most is not what you sprang from but what you sprang at.\\" Political career = State Representative = Just weeks after taking his oath of office as a state representative, Jack, along with the former mayor of Minden, J. Frank Colbert, ran unsuccessfully for Louisiana's 4th congressional district seat in the United States House of Representatives. He was eliminated from the runoff election, with victory claimed by the three-term incumbent Overton Brooks, also of Shreveport.\\"Kennon Will Met Judge Drew in Runoff; Overton Brooks Leads Race\\", Minden Herald, September 13, 1940, p. 1 Like virtually all of the Shreveport-area politicians during the 1950s, Jack was known for his fervent support of racial segregation. In 1956, he opposed a bill which would have exempted the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans from the state ban on \\"interracial activities\\". He supported a bill to require the labeling of blood by race of the donor. The raising of the Confederate flag at the Caddo Parish Courthouse embodied the sentiments of white segregationists of Jack's era. In 1962, Jack joined his House colleague, Representative Parey Branton of Shongaloo in Webster Parish, in calling for a change in the method by which Louisiana allocates its electoral votes. The two urged adoption of the framework used by Maine and Nebraska under which one elector is allotted for each congressional district to the winner by plurality in that district, and two at-large electoral votes are assigned to the top vote-getter statewide, plurality or majority. The plan was not adopted. It could have enabled Louisiana to choose split electors, as Alabama did in 1960 and New Jersey in 1860.\\"Branton Predicts Finances, Integration Will Top Legislative Session\\", Minden Press, May 14, 1962, p. 1\\"Rep. Branton Has the Answer\\", Minden Herald, editorial, February 1, 1962, p. 2 Jack's House tenure extended from the administrations of Governors Sam Houston Jones to the second term of Jimmie Davis. During his long career in the House, Jack served alongside numerous colleagues who reached the highest point in state politics, including Taddy Aycock, Bill Dodd, C. H. \\"Sammy\\" Downs, John McKeithen, Louis J. Michot, deLesseps Story Morrison, Sr., Dave L. Pearce, and William M. Rainach, along with his Caddo colleagues Algie D. Brown, Frank Fulco, and James C. Gardner. Jack lost his House seat after twenty-four years because two Republicans, Morley A. Hudson and Taylor W. O'Hearn, led the field of legislative candidates in 1964. Hudson and O'Hearn, the first two Republicans to serve in the Louisiana legislature since Reconstruction, benefited from Shreveport Republican Charlton Lyons, who carried the GOP gubernatorial banner in a ground-breaking but unsuccessful race against the Democrat John McKeithen of rural Caldwell Parish south of Monroe. In addition to Jack, the other Democrat eliminated in the 1964 election was Jasper K. Smith, a lawyer from Vivian in northern Caddo Parish. Days after U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Jack wrote a letter to the former Shreveport Journal reaffirming his own belief in segregation: \\"The white man and the Negro man are happy with their lot here in this area ...\\"Shreveport Journal, Letter to the Editor, July 8, 1964 = Later Public Office = In 1966, two years after his legislative service lapsed, Jack ran unsuccessfully for the Louisiana Public Service Commission, a utility regulatory agency, in an attempt to win the seat held by the appointed John S. Hunt, II, of Monroe, a nephew of Governors Huey Pierce Long, Sr., and Earl Kemp Long. In that campaign Jack declared himself as one opposed to all kinds of \\"federal encroachment.\\" He was joined in the race against Hunt by two of his former legislative colleagues, Parey Branton and John Sidney Garrett of Haynesville. Though Branton finished in sixth place in the contest, he led by a plurality in his own Webster Parish.Minden Press- Herald, August 15, 1966, p. 1 Hunt and Garrett, the two leading candidates, met in a runoff election on September 24.

The film was released on May 28, 2013 and stars Alix Elizabeth Gitter as a young woman that must uncover the true murderer of a heinous crime before she becomes a victim herself. It is very loosely based upon a true story Donowho read about two murdered twins. Plot The movie starts with a young girl running through a dark wood from a shadowy figure. The scene becomes bleak as a severed hand is seen next to the girl's dead body as her body is dragged away. On the hand is a silver ring. Jordan (Alix Elizabeth Gitter) is a teenager that has been orphaned after her father dies of Leukemia. Her mother died from drowning when Jordan was five years old. She's sent to live with an aunt (Tara Westwood), who is the identical twin of her mother, and uncle (Steve Bacic). They live in the town of Silver Falls, where she learns of ghost stories after seeing a burning mannequin at a park where teens go to party. When police come to raid the party, Jordan wanders the surrounding forest and discovers the ring, which she places on her forefinger without even thinking. When she returns home, she tries to remove the ring, but it won't come off. The ring, it turns out, attracts the ghost of the girl who had mysteriously been murdered twenty years before. No one, however, knows of the murder. The ghost does mischievous acts around the house, such as moving pictures, opening doors, and stealing small items from Jordan's aunt and uncle. These actions cause concern in her household, causing them to make an appointment for Jordan with the local psychologist, who is not fond of Jordan, as he believes she is a negative influence on his geek son.

Sequel  In June 2019 a sequel to the 2013 film entitled A Haunting at Silver Falls: The Return was released to DVD, On Demand, and digital. Several actors returned to reprise their roles from the first film such as Jade and Nikita Ramsey, however Alix Elizabeth Gitter did not return to the film and the role of Jordan was played by Laura Flannery. The film's story features Jordan returning to Silver Spring to deal with the ghost of her aunt Anne, who has combined forces with a convict in order to seek revenge.

Sergey Izgiyayev was the only one of the parent's three sons to live to adulthood. His brother Hizgie, when he was a child, accidentally fell into a flamed tandoor oven, and burned to death. His other brother Gadmil died of typhoid fever in his early teens. His sisters Sariah, Mazaltu, Tirso and Shushen survived to adulthood.Poet‚Äôs family Sergey Izgiyayev with wife Sarah 1968-69 Sergey Izgiyayev started writing poems as a child. In 1939, the regional newspaper Red Star (in the language of the Mountain Jews) published a large collection of his poems. Later that year he married Sarah Shamailov (1923-1978). Her contemporaries, men and women alike, thought that she was a beautiful woman. Sergey Izgiyayev dedicated to her many lyric poems.

It closed in 1989. History The Allen Theater opened in August 1914 as the \\"Nedsen Theater\\", owned and operated by R. E. Bowen and H. E. Kelser. It was initially opened with a seating capacity of 416 seats. In June, 1915, it was taken over by James K. Bowen who owned the Pergola Theater at Ninth and Hamilton Street. Bowen expanded the theater to 700 seats and added a second projector. Bowen also added evening showings of films shown during the day at the Pergola.Cinema Treasures, Allen Theater It was renovated in 1934, adding sound capability.Hellerich, Mahlon H, and Pennsylvania) Lehigh County Historical Society Allentown. Allentown, 1762-1987 : a 225-year history. Allentown, Pennsylvania: Lehigh County Historical Society, 1987Microfilm reels, Allentown Public Library of \\"The Morning Call\\" Newspsper On 12 October 1934, the local Morning Call newspaper ran an article saying the renovated theatre, renamed the \\"New Allen Theater\\" would open the next day. Its new owners were Robert L. Plarr, owner of Dorney Park amusement park, and John T. Dodd, who had been the park's general manager to that point for eight years. The first feature film shown in the newly renovated theater was Baby Take a Bow with child star Shirley Temple, James Dunn and Claire Trevor. In 1938, air conditioning was added. Throughout its existence, the Allen was a local, second-run theater which, unlike its contemporaries in downtown Allentown, played popular films in a residential neighborhood after they ended their first run at the larger theaters in the entertainment district. Prices were considerably less: during the Depression of the 1930s, admission was 20 cents for adults and 10 cents for children. The Allen was one of three \\"neighborhood\\" second-run theaters in the residential district of Allentown in the 1930s, the others being the Franklin Theater (1913) at 429 W. Tilghman Street and the Towne Theater (1935) at 343 N. Sixth Street; all were within a mile or two of each other. The Allen had a number of owners over the decades, and was moderately successful even during the age of television in the 1950s and 1960s. Primarily because of its low prices, it had a reputation as a place to go to see movies a little later but at a cheaper admission. As late as the 1980s, a film could be seen at the Allen for $1 admission. \\"Wait until it comes to the Allen,\\" was its slogan. Rising film rental costs and other overhead expenses, however, could not be ignored, and as time passed the Allen did not draw the crowds it once did. The Allen Theater was built at a time when Allentown was a pedestrian city. Built in a neighborhood of row homes, there was little or no place for people to park their cars nearby, and in the age of mall multi-cinemas in the suburbs, the charm of a small-single screen theater showing second-run films built in a neighborhood that was in decline, and the 1987 death of the theater's last owner, George Restum, led to its closure in November 1989. The building stood vacant for just over a decade, with its fate tied up in a property dispute. It was demolished in 2000. Today, the land is used as an asphalt parking lot.

A member of the Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party,Rabinovich, 1972, p. 235. he was instrumental in the 1966 Syrian coup d'√©tat that toppled the government of Amin al-Hafiz, also a Ba'athist. That same year he launched an insurrection from his home region of Jabal al-Druze against his colleagues who formed the new government but sidelined him from any major position.Moubayed, p. 53. He fled Syria amid a warrant for his arrest, but returned in 1967 and was subsequently jailed and executed.Moubayed, p. 54. Early life Hatum was born in the village of Dhibin near the town of Salkhad in the Jabal al-Druze region of Syria, during French Mandatory rule. His family were followers of the Druze religion. Historian Hanna Batatu describes Hatum's family as part of the \\"middle landed class,\\" while historian Patrick Seale describes them \\"poor.\\"Seale, p. 109. His father had been a director of the census in the area.Batatu, pp. 148-149. Military and political career =Early career and 1963 coup= Hatum began his military career in the Homs Military Academy, where he also joined the Ba'ath Party, an Arab nationalist movement, headed by Michel Aflaq. After graduating he became an officer in the Syrian Army,Moubayed, p. 52. with the rank of captain.Seale, pp. 76-77.Rabinovich, 1972, pp. 44-45. In 1958 Syria and Egypt merged under the leadership of Gamal Abdel Nasser to form the United Arab Republic. In September 1961 the union was ended after a coup by secessionist officers in Syria. Arab nationalist officers sought to topple the secessionist government of Nazim al-Qudsi and formed an alliance within the military to launch a coup in 1963. Hatum was one of the few Ba'athist officers among the Arab nationalists in the army during this period, although the Ba'athists were the most organized force unofficially headed by a secretive grouping known as the Military Committee and officially, if only nominally, organized by the political party under Alfaq. Participants in the 1963 coup celebrating its success. From left to right: Hatum, Muhammad Umran and Salah Jadid On 7‚Äì8 March 1963 Ziad al-Hariri, an independent unionist officer, headed the coup by leading the takeover of Damascus, capturing several strategic points in the city. Meanwhile, Hatum led the unionists' capture of the city's radio station. It then broadcast that the National Council for the Revolutionary Command had replaced the secessionist government and that it was reinstating several discharged Ba'athist officers into the army, including all of those on the Military Committee, which at that time was made of Muhammad Umran, Salah Jadid, Hafez al-Assad, Abd al-Karim al- Jundi and Ahmad al-Mir. Following the coup's success, Hatum was appointed to the Military Committee, which was expanded to include more members. He was subsequently promoted to the rank of major.Rabinovich, 1972, p. 151. In addition to the commando unit he headed prior to the coup, Hatum was also made the commander of the army garrisons posted near the strategic radio and television stations. Hatum was elected as a member of the Regional Command of the Syrian Regional Branch on 1 August 1965, serving one term that lasted until 19 December of that year.Batatu, pp. 338-339. That year, he also served on the military tribunal to try Israeli spy Eli Cohen. =1966 coup and aftermath= The Military Committee increasingly challenged the authority of President Amin al-Hafiz and Prime Minister Salah al-Din al-Bitar, both staunch allies of Aflaq. In February 1966, the regionalist faction of the Committee launched a coup to topple the government. Jadid assigned Hatum to command a special force and arrest Hafiz from his home in Damascus. Hafiz resisted and a firefight between him and Hatum's men ensued. Hatum ordered tank fire against his home and armed clashes raged throughout the city, ending in the deaths of some 50 people. Hafiz was wounded and his daughter lost an eye during the battle, before Hafiz surrendered himself. Hatum felt he was not properly rewarded for his role in the 1966 coup, having been kept from any position in the Ba'ath Party's Regional Command or the Syrian government. Instead he kept his post in the Committee and command over Damascus' radio station. The leaders of the coup, Jadid and Hafez al-Assad, viewed Hatum as reckless and deplored the severe use of force he deployed and the consequent mass casualties when he arrested Hafiz. Hatum decided to oust Jadid and Assad by establishing contact with officers and party figures who had been loyal to Bitar and Hafiz, namely former secretary-general of the party's National Command Munif al-Razzaz and former deputy chief of staff Fahd al- Sha'ir.Moubayed, 2006, p. 53. A coup was planned for 1 July, but delayed until 3 September, upon Hatum's insistence. In the meantime, in August, one of Hatum's co-conspirators, colonel Talal Abu Asali, publicly cursed Jadid and promised to avenge Hafiz during a drinking session with other officers. As a result, he was arrested the following day by Chief of Staff Ahmed Suwaydani, who assigned Hatum (who was far from suspicion at that point) to head the investigation against Asali. During the interrogation, Hatum reportedly whispered to Asali \\"I will kill anyone who talks\\". Jadid became suspicious of Hatum for unclear reasons, stripped him of his investigative role and assigned Syrian intelligence head, Abd al-Karim al-Jundi, to head the interrogation. After Jundi allegedly tortured Asali, the latter confessed that Sha'ir and Razzaz were planning a coup against the new government, but did not mention Hatum. Jundi subsequently led a crackdown against officers belonging to the Druze community, like Sha'ir and Hatum, arresting over 200 military personnel. Asali was released. Tensions in the predominantly Druze region of Jabal al- Arab, prompted Jadid and President Nureddin al-Atassi to visit the regional capital of al-Suwayda to alleviate the situation. After hearing of their visit, an incensed Hatum had Asali surround al-Suwayda with tanks, while Hatum entered the city's party headquarters where Jadid and Atassi were meeting local officials. He threatened to kill them, but after pressure from local elders, he reneged and had them detained instead. Defense Minister Assad, who was in Damascus, ordered Hatum to release Jadid and Atassi, which Hatum rejected. Assad subsequently ordered the aerial and ground bombardment of Suwayda, until he put an end to Hatum's mutiny. Downfall and death Hatum and Asali fled south to Jordan, where King Hussein gave them asylum. Afterward, four hundred of Hatum's loyalists in the officers corps were dismissed, reassigned or arrested, in an unprecedented purge in Syrian military history, while in March 1967, Mustafa Tlass headed a military court that tried Hatum in absentia. Hatum was sentenced to death.Moubayed, 2006, p. 54. Sectarianism increasingly played a role in the rivalry and confrontation between the two camps, with the Druze and to an extent the Sunni Muslim officers set against the Alawite officers like Jadid and Assad, who were largely in control of the country's military and internal security networks at that time.Moosa, p. 306. Hatum stated in a press conference in Jordan, that sectarianism was taking hold in the Syrian Army, with the purges undertaken by Assad and Jadid resulting in the entrenchment of Alawite power in the country, with Alawite officers taking up key positions in the state. He further asserted that Alawites outnumbered non-Alawites in the officer corps five to one and the government was leading Syria under the slogan of \\"One Nusayri state with an eternal message.\\" This was a mock reference to the Ba'athist motto \\"One Arab nation with an eternal message\\", replacing \\"Arab\\" with \\"Nusayri\\", which is a derogatory name for Alawite.Moosa, pp. 306-307. Following Syria's defeat in the 1967 Six-Day War with Israel, Hatum announced that he would return to Syria to fight the Israelis. He felt Jadid would not pursue the death warrant against him with his government now weakened by the defeat. After he reentered the country, he took up protection by the popular Syrian nationalist Druze leader Sultan al-Atrash in Jabal al-Arab. However, he was arrested by the authorities to Atrash's protestations and brought to court, where Tlass confirmed the death sentence and Hatum was executed by firing squad on 26 June. Tlass later took personal responsibility for his execution, stating Hatum \\"lost the correct path by conspiring with Jordan\\".

Background Yarri came from Brungle in the Gundagai Police District, His nativel name of Coonong Denamundinna indicates he was of the Rainbow serpent pastoral property near Tumblong, Adelong N.S.W. which was also associated with the Coonong region downstream of Wagga Wagga in New South Wales. Yarri worked at Nangus station as a shepherd. The aboriginals of the area were numerous: according to an 1851 estimate, which classified them generically as belonging to the Tumut tribe, they consisted of 35 groups. Life Yarri is said to have previously saved the life of John Hargreaves at the time of the 1844 flooding in the area. His act earned him the friendship of the family and he lived on their property at Tarrabandra until his death. A number of stories circulate suggesting that Yarri is the same as the native of that name mentioned as being responsible for the death of John Baxter at Caiguna in Western Australia during the expedition made by Edward John Eyre in 1841. This identification wouls place Yarri a long way from his traditional lands. The association of the two goes back to newspaper reports at the time. In the same year as the flood, the Brungle aboriginal community is said to have blamed him for the death of a part Aboriginal woman, Sally McLeod, much closer to his home area, near Gundagai in 1852. Warrants were made for his arrest. Yarri's wife was known by the name of Black Sally, and that Sally is said to have died on walkabout in March 1873. 24-25 June 1852 The Murrumbidgee, whose name is said to derive from an Wiradjuri word morunbeedja, warning of 'big water', had inundated the area on several occasions in the past, in 1844, and August 1851. Old Aboriginals had cautioned people building in the district of its dangers, recounting that in earlier times, water had risen so high that it covered the tops of large gum trees. In the flood at Gundagai, New South Wales on 25 June 1852, 48 houses in North Gundagai were washed away and the overflow killed a large number of local white people, with estimates varying from 81 to almost 100, out of the town's population of 397, of whom 49 were rescued by aboriginals. The event itself became one of the largest natural disasters in Australia's history. Local Aboriginal men, Yarri and Jacky Jacky between them were credited with having saved approximately 28 people, though contemporary reports assert that Jackey was responsible for some 20 of these. The difference between the two may stem from the fact that Jackey had the use of a boat, capable of holding 8 people, whereas Yarri's rescue efforts were conducted with a frail native bark canoe that could only carry two. Others were rescued by Long Jimmy and Tommy Davis. Recognition Though poems and stories were published at the time celebrating the heroic efforts of the aborigines in rescuing whites, public recognition in terms of a material reward was slow in coming. It was only in 1875, by which time Jackey had died, that it was announced that the native rescuers were entitled to collect sixpence from settlers. Yarri, Jacky Jacky and Tommy Davis were honoured with bronze breastplates for their efforts, and were allowed to demand sixpences from all Gundagai residents, although Yarri was maltreated on at least one occasion after the flood. Long Jimmy died not long after his rescues, possibly from the effects of being exposed to the freezing cold and wet conditions. The rescue effort and reward to Tommy Davis are recorded in an old Gundagai Independent newspaper. Memorial to Yarri in the Gundagai cemetery A nulla- nulla and shield believed to belong to Yarri, was presented to the Gundagai Historical Society by John Hargreaves' grandson Dallas. Yarri suffered from an aneurism, but refused to be transported to Sydney for treatment, and crept out of the hospital in April to return to his dwelling, preferring to die in the area he belonged to at Gundagai. He subsequently died on 24 July 1880 and is buried in the Catholic Section of the North Gundagai General Cemetery. Memorials There are several tributes to Yarri in the Gundagai area including a town memorial, sundial, marble plaque and black marble headstone. A mural painted around the walls of the lounge bar in the Criterion Hotel in Gundagai depicts the scene. Yarri Park, a recreation area below the main street in Gundagai, commemorates his feat, and a sundial was erected in his honour by descendants of Fred Horsley, one of the people he saved. In 2017 a Gundagai community committee, including members of the Wiradjuri community and descendants of those saved by Yarri and Jacky Jacky, erected a bronze sculpture in Sheridan Street, Gundagai entitled \\"The Great Rescue of 1852\\" in honour of the Wiradjuri heroes.

Fort Alert was constructed at Trader's Hill in 1812. After the War of 1812 ended, the fort was unmanned, but became active again from 1817 to 1819 during a time of heightened alarm mostly due to Creeks, but also due to the takeover of Fernandina by various rebel factions. In 1854, Charlton County was created out of Camden County. Trader's Hill was selected as the first county seat. During the Civil War, Trader's Hill became a refugee site for local people, including residents of St. Marys, seeking to get away from the coast. After the construction of the Savannah, Florida & Western Railway, the center of commerce in the area shifted from the river to the railway. In 1901, the county seat was moved to Folkston.

Their aim was to blow up railway tunnels that would cut the line of communication to German forces in central Italy. The first mission, Ginny I, occurred on February 27/28, 1944, when fifteen U.S. soldiers attempted to land west of the small town of Framura. However, the OSS team had to abort after they landed on the wrong spot and could not find the tunnel. The second attempt, Ginny II, occurred a month later on March 22 when the same team attempted to land on the same spot. However, they landed again in the wrong place and were captured two days later by the German Army. Although the OSS members were properly uniformed, they were summarily executed on March 26 under Hitler's Commando Order of 1942 at the command of German General Anton Dostler. After the war, Dostler was tried by a military tribunal for the deaths of fifteen Americans, sentenced to death, and executed by a firing squad. Background The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was formed in June 1942 by General William J. Donovan to collect and analyze strategic information required by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and to conduct special operations not assigned to other agencies. In the early days of the OSS, it initially lacked experience, resources, and the respect of skeptical staff officers in the theater. However, the OSS proved its value by establishing contacts with Allied sympathizers and gathered intelligence vital to the invasion prior to Operation Torch and organized warrior tribesmen into a guerrilla force to guard against a possible Axis thrust through Spanish Morocco into the Allied rear with bilingual U.S. officers during the North African Campaign. The OSS then established the Operational Group (OG) to recruit second generation American soldiers with language facility who, if organized in small groups and trained with commando capabilities, could be parachuted into enemy occupied territory to harass the enemy and to encourage and support local resistance organizations. During the landings on the Italian mainland at Salerno in September 1943, an OSS detachment provided Lieutenant Colonel William O. Darby's Rangers with critical intelligence during their defense of the Sorrento Peninsula. Three weeks after the Italian government surrendered to the Allies on September 8, Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ) issued a key directive, \\"OSS/SOE Activities in Italy,\\" that the OG's mandate was: to undertake the commando-type actions‚Äîfor which Donovan had been pinning. In this document, the OSS and SOE were given four tasks: * Instigation of the Italian population to carry out acts of resistance to German forces. * Direct attack on communications and transport in that area of Italy now held by the enemy. Old raiding parties will make the attacks and remain to instruct and incite the local population to further and similar efforts. * Destruction of enemy aircraft on the ground. * Destruction of enemy supply drops. One of the OSS' most important tasks was to cut vital German supply lines that reinforced the Gustav and later the Gothic Line. After the USAAF bombing raids on mountainous terrain roads along the Italian coast during Operation Strangle failed in damaging the German supply lines, the OSS discussed the use of sabotage teams. On January 9, 1944, the OSS proposed the destruction of tunnels between Levanto and Bonassola, a segment in the Genoa- La Spezia rail line. The longest of these were the \\"La Francesca\\", 510 meters in length, at the northwestern end of the target sector; at the southeastern end, beginning 600 meters west of Levanto station, were two short tunnels, one 105 and the other 75 meters in length, separated by 25 meters of open track. The rocky walls of the tunnels were thought to consist chiefly of the serpentine type, making them less vulnerable to demolition. A captured Italian officer who had recently traveled over the line reported that there were few guards along the coast between Genoa and La Spezia. This gave the OSS an advantage and it was reported that \\"[t]he tunnels are all single track: interruption of traffic would thus require blowing fewer tunnel entrances and permit achievement of greater results with the same weight of explosive.\\" This meant that fewer teams and fewer explosives would have been required to sabotage and interrupt the rail traffic. The mission was given the code name Ginny. Commandos The OSS recruited Italian-American soldiers into the Operational Group (OG) for the Ginny mission because some of them could speak Italian and their knowledge of the country's language in which they were expected to operate was deemed very helpful to communicate with the local population. In Ginny 1 the working party was headed by First Lt. Vincent Russo and members of his team were T/5 Salvatore Di Sclafani; T/5 John J. Leone; T/5 Angelo Sirico; T/5 John Lepore; T/5 Vittorio Amoruso; T/5 Thomas Savino; and T/5 Joseph Noia. The security team, headed by First Lt. Paul J. Traficante, consisted of T/Sgt. Livio Vieceli; Sgt. Carmine Armando; Sgt. Dominick Mauro; T/5 Joseph Libardi; and T/5 Rosario Squatrito. In Ginny II, most members from the previous mission were the same except four members‚ÄîSgt. Carmine Armando, T/5 John Lepore, T/5 Vittorio Amoruso, and T/5 Thomas Savino‚Äîwere replaced by T/5 Joseph M. Farrell, T/5 Liberty J. Tremonte, T/5 Santoro Calcara, and Sgt Alfred L. De Flumeri for this mission. Ginny I The first mission of Ginny I occurred on February 27/28, 1944. A fifteen-man OSS Operational Group (OG) was put aboard two U.S. Navy PT boats and the boats were to depart from a harbor in Bastia at 1800 hrs for the mission. However, the departure was delayed by 45 minutes after the lead boat with the working party on board had to be replaced due to a faulty radar. At 1845 hrs, the two boats finally departed from the harbor and sailed northward across the Ligurian Sea toward Stazione de Framura but were further delayed several times to avoid suspicious enemy radar sightings: neither enemy vessels nor aircraft were spotted visually. The boats arrived at the disembarkation point at 0125 hrs and the sabotage team began using rubber boats and paddled northeastward. Both the working and security parties landed at what they thought was the right spot and were properly dressed in U.S. Army uniforms and had no civilian clothes with them. However, Russo noticed that something was wrong. He heard the train northeast of him and realized he and his team had landed south of the objective instead. At 0245 hrs, he reported that it would take him and his team at least an hour and a half to reach its target‚Äî0415 hrs at least‚Äîand requested permission to stay and be picked up the following night. The senior officer afloat rejected this suggestion because according to the plan, the team had to complete the sabotage mission and rendezvous back to the PT boats by 0330 hrs‚Äî0400 hrs at the latest‚Äîin order to distance themselves from the Ligurian coast and to avoid German patrol before sunrise. Fearing that the team would not complete the mission on time, the senior officer ordered the team to return to the PT boats. The OSS team went back to the PT boats by 0315 hrs and returned to Bastia harbor at 0730 hrs. Ginny II For Ginny II, the mission objective and planning remain unchanged from the previous mission. Four OSS members who previously took part in Ginny I were replaced by others (see above) for Ginny II and T/5 Joseph Noia was placed in the security party instead. First Lt. Russo still commanded the shore party and First Lt. Paul J. Traficante for the security party. A contingency plan was developed i.e. if the team were unable to complete the mission in time, they would return to the shore to be picked up by PT boats. If the PT boats were gone, the team would find a safehouse, hide out there and wait for the PT boats to pick them up the next night. On March 22, the OSS Operational Group (OG) team boarded the two U.S. Navy PT boats and the boats left Bastia harbor at 1800 hrs. The boats arrived at the disembarkation point in 2245 hrs, 300 yards southwest of the pinpoint, and the OSS team departed northward in three rubber boats at 2255 hrs (2245 hrs according to the one of the PT's boat report) to west of Stazione di Framura and landed what they believe was the exact spot. Like Ginny I, the OSS members were properly dressed in U.S. Army uniforms and had no civilian clothes in them. Calcura, Tremonte, and Farrell wore paratrooper boots with the others wearing regulation G.I. shoes with canvas leggings. They also wore knit stocking caps and had their jackets inside-out. They wore no distinctive markings that indicated the branch of OSS so the only insignia the OSS men had were U.S. Army ranks patched on either their sleeves of shirts or their field jackets. The men all were armed with Colt.45 automatic pistols and Fairbairn‚ÄìSykes fighting knives with six of the team carrying 9-mm Marlin submachine guns. At approximately 2345 hrs, a convoy of German torpedo boats was sighted returning from a mine-laying mission. One U.S. PT boat took diversionary action and got into a firefight, while the other idled along the coast on one engine and tried to keep in contact with the shore party. The radiomen on the U.S. boats kept trying to reach the shore party, but all was silent. At 0200 hrs, the two U.S. PT boats rendezvoused five miles out to sea because their radar indicated numerous targets along the shore, and they had to lie quietly until 0300 hrs. At that time, the U.S. boats moved in close to the rocky cliffs in an attempt to raise the mission party on the radio. One U.S. PT boat reported its main steering mechanism had malfunctioned, and it was 0400 hrs before it was repaired. No transmissions were heard from the mission party, and the two U.S. boats returned to base. =Hiding= Russo realized that he and his team were again in the wrong spot. He discovered that they had landed near the village of Carpineggio, about halfway between Bonassola and Stazione di Framura. The group had landed two miles from its intended initial point and about one mile from the target. Unable to contact the U.S. PT boats which had returned to base, Russo and his men then went to the contingency plan. They were to hide during the day, establish contact with their PT boats the following night, and then accomplish the mission. The team would not blow the tunnel until contact had been made. They hid their rubber boats and explosives and demolition equipment under the trees as best they could and began moving up slope. They eventually found an empty barn on the edge of the locality of Carpeneggio and settled in. On the morning of March 23, two team members, 1st Lt. Russo and Sgt. Mauro, went out to get food and information at the nearest farm. An Italian farmer named Franco Lagaxo saw Russo and Mauro approaching his cottage who identified themselves as U.S. soldiers and was asked if he could buy food for them. He agreed to do so and later in the day guided them on reconnaissance which succeeded in locating access to the Genoa-La Spezia rail tunnel. On the evening of March 23, the U.S. PT boats were launched to accomplish the pickup per the contingency plan in order to make prearranged radio contact with the OSS team. However, they again ran into trouble as one had a mechanical breakdown on the trip from Corsica and had to return to base. The second spotted a radar trace which indicated enemy activity approaching the coast, and was also forced to turn back. As a result, the OSS team was forced into another day of hiding. =Capture= An Italian fisherman noticed the rubber boats pulled up along the shore, and mentioned them to authorities at nearby Bonassola. Two Fascist Italian militiamen went with the fisherman to investigate and found the boats and explosive material. They alerted the local German command, formed a search party, and started sweeping the area. Lagaxo then discovered that the Italians and Germans had found the rubber boats and rushed in to warn the Americans. His warning came too late. All fifteen U.S. soldiers who were staying in the barn were captured after minor clashes with Italian Fascist and German soldiers. The captured OSS members were taken to the German headquarters of the 135th Fortress Brigade in La Spezia for interrogation. One of the U.S. officers revealed to the Germans that it was a commando raid to blow up tunnels critical to German supply routes. =Execution= On the next morning of March 25, the information about the capture of U.S. soldiers and the purpose of the mission was then sent to General of the Infantry Anton Dostler at the 75th German Army Corps headquarters. Dostler at first informed his superior, Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, commanding general of all German forces in Italy, about the captured U.S. commandos and what to do with them. According to Dostler's adjutant officer, Kesselring responded by ordering the execution and Dostler signed an order that all fifteen American prisoners of war were to be executed the next morning. The order was the implementation of the 1942 Commando Order issued by Hitler which stipulated the execution without trial of all captured Allied commandos, even those in proper uniforms, behind German lines. Alexander zu Dohna-Schlobitten, an aide to General Dostler, and unaware of the secret order, refused to sign the execution order because he knew that executing properly uniformed combatants was a direct violation of the Geneva Convention (1929). He was later dismissed from the Wehrmacht for insubordination. German officers at the 135th Fortress Brigade contacted Dostler in an attempt to achieve a stay of execution. However, General Dostler rejected their request and ordered the execution of American prisoners to be carried out the next morning. Two last attempts were made by officers at the 135th to stop the execution, including some by telephone, but these efforts were unsuccessful. On the morning of March 26, fifteen U.S. soldiers‚Äîstill in U.S. Army uniforms‚Äîwere marched and lined up by the German Army in Punta Bianca, above the sea on the rocky tip of Ameglia's peninsula. All were executed on the spot and buried in a mass grave that was then camouflaged.Raiber, Anatomy of Perjury, pp. 133‚Äì136. None of the executed U.S. soldiers were given a previous trial. Aftermath After Nazi Germany signed its instrument of surrender that effectively ended the war in Europe on May 8, 1945, Kesselring surrendered to the Americans at Saalfeld and was placed in confinement. On October 6, 1945, he was interviewed in connection with the deaths of fifteen Americans. He stated that he did not recall receiving any information regarding the fifteen OSS members. He contended that he received many reports and that he was frequently away from his headquarters in Rome. Kesselring was also questioned about Hitler's Commando Order which was clearly unlawful. He replied that the order was not binding on him and that it could be interpreted in many different ways. Due to falsification and destruction of his records to hide this affair, he was not prosecuted for this crime. General Dostler was captured by U.S. forces on May 8, 1945, and brought to trial before an American military tribunal at the seat of the Supreme Allied Commander, the Royal Palace in Caserta on October 8, 1945. In the first Allied war trial, Dostler was accused of carrying out an illegal order. In his defense, he maintained that he had revoked his first order to shoot the men but he had eventually re-issued it on higher order and that the execution of the OSS team was a lawful reprisal. Dostler also bluntly lied that the captured OSS men were dressed in civilian clothes. Then, when questioned why they were found in U.S. uniforms, he said that they wore no distinctive markings that distinguished themselves as Americans and therefore received no protection under the rules of war (which was rebuffed since the dead OSS men had insignia of their U.S. Army ranks). Dostler's plea of Superior Orders failed because, by ordering the execution he had acted on his own outside the Fuhrer's order. The military commission also rejected his plea, declaring that Dostler's execution of U.S. soldiers was in violation of Article 2 of the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, which prohibited acts of reprisals against prisoners of war. The commission stated that \\"[n]o soldier, and still less a Commanding General, can be heard to say that he considered the summary shooting of prisoners of war legitimate even as a reprisal.\\" Four days later, the trial unanimously found General Dostler guilty of war crimes, rejecting his defense of Superior orders. He was sentenced to death and executed by a firing squad on December 1, 1945, in Aversa, about 5 kilometres north of Naples. The Dostler case became a precedent for the principle, used in the Nuremberg Trials of German generals, officials, and Nazi leaders beginning in November 1945, that using Superior orders as a defense does not relieve officers from responsibility of carrying out illegal orders and their liability to be punished in court. This principle was codified in Principle IV of the Nuremberg Principles, and similar principles were found in sections of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Memorial There is a memorial for the 15 executed American soldiers in Piazza della Liberta, Ameglia. To commemorate the 60th anniversary of the mission in 2004, the American OSS Society and the Comune of Ameglia placed a commemorative plaque at Punta Bianca and erected a formal monument at Bocca di Magra. The mission represented a tragic waste of heroic and talented military personnel who must have known from the start that their chances of success and survival were perilously slim.

The earthworks are associated with the Hopewell tradition. The site has been described as \\"unusual\\" by contemporary archaeologists. Excavations in the early 19th-century state that the site was not for fortification, but was used for religious purposes, including for burials. The group of mounds and enclosures is located alongside Paint Creek. Today, most of the mounds and earthworks have been destroyed due to cultivation. Aerial photography has displayed cropmarks of the works. It has been noted that corn plants grow differently in the spots where the earthworks once stood. Survey history =Squier and Davis: 1845= The site was surveyed by Ephraim George Squier and Edwin Hamilton Davis in October, 1845. They would report on their visit in their 1848 publication, Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley. They report the site consisting of \\"four circles, three crescents, two square works, and four mounds.\\" A circle enclosure on the eastern side of the site is described as being the primary earthwork at the site. Totaling 240 feet in diameter with square yet \\"much curved\\" three foot high walls. This enclosure is surrounded by a square ditch totaling 160 feet wide. A gateway on the southside of the square serves as the entrance. The gateway is 25 feet wide. Squier and Davis describe a small mound, 130 feet southwest of the large enclosure. The small mound, at three feet high and 30 feet in diameter, is encircled by a ditch and a wall. A gateway is located on the northside of the wall. A crescent shape is described as \\"almost touching\\" the circle that surrounds the mound. It's 132 feet in diameter. Another crescent is 66 feet away past the first crescent. Upon survey, the describe it as \\"terminating in a mound of sacrifice\\". That mound is described as being seven feet high and 45 feet wide at its base. They describe this mound as commanding the \\"entire base of works.\\" Their excavation of the mound determined that it was made of clay. A shaft was dug from the middle of the mound. A layer of, what Squier and Davis describe as wood coals, were found three feet below the surface of the mound. The coals were three to four inches in thickness. These coals were also found outside the mound, mixed with clay and broken about a foot away. They figured that this mean that the mound had been disturbed at some point. Back inside the mound, they discovered a human skeleton in the layer of wood coal. They noted that it was \\"much decayed\\" and that the skull and jaw were crushed. Underneath the skeleton was soil and as they proceeded towards the center of the mound the soil mixed with more coals. They found three more human skeletons seven feet beneath the surface of the mound. The skeletons were described as being in good condition. The skeletons were placed side by side, pointing west. They were covered with a mix of soil and clay. They reported that this covering was signature of a type of altar often found in religious purpose mounds. They noticed that the mound had been opened after its creation, and \\"its structure broken up.\\" Squier and Davis believed that the three skeletons found were of Native peoples who utilized the earthworks as a burial site after the original builders had left the area. They believed this based on the quality of the skeletons preservation and the \\"shallow graves\\" that \\"modern Indians bury,\\" their dead. Relics were also found in the mound. After this discovery, Squier and Davis noted that they believed the site was of religious use, not for fortification. \\"They may have answered a double purpose, and may have been used for the celebration of games,\\".

Like the similar R v Ireland (1970) 126 CLR 321, Bunning v Cross, the ruling of the High Court of Australia has been formulated as an exclusionary rule, namely the onus is on the accused to prove the misconduct and justify exclusion, and is known as the Bunning discretion (cf. Ireland discretion).Frank Bates. (1994.) \\"Improperly Obtained Evidence and Public Policy: An Australian Perspective\\", The International and Comparative Law Quarterly, 43(2):379-91. Facts Mr. Bunning was charged under s. 63 (1) of the Road Traffic Act, 1974 with having driven a car \\"whilst under the influence of alcohol to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of it\\". Burton SM dismissed the charge, holding that the evidence of the result of a breathalyzer test was inadmissible because the police officer's requirement that the applicant undergo the test was unlawful. The respondent (i.e., Cross, the prosecutor) sought and obtained an order to review from the Supreme Court of Western Australia under the Justices Act 1902 (WA), as amended. The relevant provisions (ss. 197, 198, 205, 206, 206A and 206F) are set out in the judgment of the Chief Justice. Jones J heard the return to the order and decided that the evidence was admissible but that, in the circumstances, the magistrate was entitled in his discretion to admit or to reject it. Jones J declined to direct that the evidence should be admitted, but expressed the view that, if he were to decide the question for himself, he would admit it. He then made an order directing the magistrate to rehear the case and to determine it \\"in accordance with this judgment and according to law\\". This can only mean (and s. 206F makes this clear) that the magistrate was bound to follow Jones J's directions. Burton SM reheard the case, treated the evidence of the breathalyzer test as admissible, and, in his discretion, rejected the evidence. He then dismissed the charge for the second time. The respondent sought and obtained another order to review on the ground that the magistrate had not properly exercised his discretion. The Full Court (Lavan and Brinsden JJ, Burt CJ dissenting) held that the discretion was not properly exercised. Burt CJ held that the magistrate took into account all relevant matters. Lavan J took the view that Mr. Burton had not taken into account all relevant considerations and directed that he should reconsider the exercise of discretion. Brinsden J considered that the magistrate was bound to admit the evidence and thought the result should be a conviction. None of the justices of the Full Court was willing to exercise the discretion to admit or exclude the evidence, and none was willing that the Full Court should convict (although urged to do so by the respondent). They also refrained from directing the magistrate to convict. Judgment =Majority opinion= Barwick CJ authored a concurring opinion, and Stephen and Aickin JJ co- authored a concurring opinion. The majority ruled for the applicant, the prosecutor, and ordered the case to be remitted to the magistrate, who was directed to convict the respondent and impose upon the respondent an appropriate penalty. =Dissenting opinion= Jacobs and Murphy JJ both authored individual dissenting opinions.

Her cover design of Frankie Goes To Hollywood's 1983 single \\"Relax\\" has been described as \\"one of the most famous record sleeves of all time\\". While much of her career since then has focused on illustrating the covers and interiors of popular books, Gilbert has also designed series of stamps produced by the Royal Mail depicting Christmas themes and Arthurian mythology. She illustrated several of the books in the Ologies series, among other children's books. Career Gilbert was born in Wallsend and lived in her grandparents' house with her parents. She attended Holy Cross School there as well as Ocean Road School in South Shields, eventually finishing at Morpeth Grammar School for Girls. Her grandmother was an artist, and Gilbert's parents encouraged her talent for art: \\"I've always drawn since a baby. The seed was planted early when my mother brought me books back from jumble sales.\\" Gilbert spent a brief amount of time at an art college in Liverpool studying graphic design before \\"stumbling\\" upon her career as a professional artist. She explained, \\"I managed to get an agent who got me a job for the Sunday Telegraph drawing six famous people as the historical characters they most wanted to be. Then I cut my teeth on women's magazines.\\" She lived for a time with Holly Johnson and Paul Rutherford (both later members of Frankie Goes To Hollywood). They asked her to create a piece of art for them, but not having enough time, Gilbert gave them an existing \\"fetish-themed\\" piece she had drawn for Playboy and Men Only. The cover was featured on their 1983 single \\"Relax\\" and quickly attracted comment, though she claimed not to have made any money from it. According to the Evening Chronicle, her design became \\"one of the most famous record sleeves of all time\\" and led to Gilbert becoming the recipient of \\"global attention.\\" In 1985, the Royal Mail issued four stamps that were designed by Gilbert. They featured scenes from Arthurian mythology, and were meant to celebrate the quincentenary of the publication of Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. Gilbert has also created special sets of Christmas stamps for the Royal Mail. According to Gilbert in a 2005 interview, the company had paid her at least ¬£100,000 in the past to design five sets of special stamps. Her 1994 series depicted young children dressed up as various Nativity characters including the Three Wise Men and the Virgin Mary. One of her collections, \\"The Nativity at Christmas\\", won the award for the world's most beautiful stamp in 1984. =Book illustrations= In the 1970s, Gilbert provided front cover illustrations for the Penguin Books edition of the works of D. H. Lawrence.https://whistlesinthewind.wordpress.com/tag/yvonne-gilbert/ In 2004, The Journal reported that Gilbert \\"has progressed to become one of the best selling British illustrators in the USA, well known for the fairytale quality of her work seen mostly in children's books.\\" Gilbert compiled 16 traditional lullabies into her 1991 book, Baby's Book of Lullabies & Cradle Songs, which she illustrated using watercolours. The selections included songs in English, French, and Norwegian, among other languages. She illustrated Rebecca Hickox's children's book, Per and the Dala Horse in 1997, and M.C. Helldorfer's Night of the White Stag in 1999. Gilbert has provided artwork for many other children's books, including A Visit from St. Nicholas, and Vivien French's A Christmas Star Called Hannah, both published in 2000. She illustrated Billy Joel's first children's book, \\"Goodbye My Angel\\", in 2004, which he based on a song he wrote for his daughter. Publishers Weekly opined that Gilbert's \\"idealized images of the long-lashed heroine and luminous landscapes echo the unabashedly sentimental strains of Joel's song.\\" Gilbert and several other artists illustrated some of the popular Ologies series: Wizardology: The Book of the Secrets of Merlin (2005), Pirateology: A Pirate Hunter's Companion (2006), and Spyology: The Complete Book of Spycraft (2008). Gilbert's initial colour-pencilled drawings for Wizardology, featuring \\"Merlin in his book- filled study, and a young magician in training,\\" were lost by the Royal Mail in 2005 when she tried to mail them to publisher Templar. The Mail tried to compensate her just for the price of the paper and ink, to her anger, as she believed the works were \\"worth about pounds 2,500. Not to mention its future value if the book is a success.\\" The incident led her to demand the company solidify its policy on determining the value of works of art. She has also provided the illustrations for the Brothers Grimm work The Frog Prince, retold by Kathy-Jo Wargin in 2007. The Columbia Daily Tribune called her contributions \\"breathtaking,\\" and the Cape Cod Times praised her artwork, declaring in a review that \\"the absolute beauty of this book is in the illustrations by Anne Yvonne Gilbert. Highly detailed and in softly lush colors, Gilbert‚Äôs color-pencil drawings are almost worthy of framing, and their detail will appeal to the littlest princess as well as fairy tale lovers ages 3 and up.\\" Gilbert has provided the cover art for many of Jennifer Roberson's novels, including Lady of the Forest (1992) and its sequel Lady of Sherwood (1999), Lady of the Glen (1996), Highwaymen: Robbers and Rogues (1997), and the 2001 republications of her Chronicles of the Cheysuli fantasy series: Shapechanger's Song, Legacy of the Wolf, Children of the Lion, and The Lion Throne. Gilbert designed the art in The Wild Swans in 2005, featured in a republication of Hans Christian Andersen's story. In 2006, she redesigned the cover of George RR Martin's 1980 novel The Ice Dragon. Martin called the edition \\"lavishly illustrated,\\" and noted her reputation for being an \\"acclaimed British fantasy artist\\". In 2010, she provided the illustrations seen in an abridged, young adult version of Bram Stoker's Dracula, as told by author Nicky Raven. Gilbert produced the \\"traditional fairy tale type\\" illustrations for Jodi Picoult's first young adult novel Between the Lines, published in 2012. Style \\"Fashion Drawing\\", one of Gilbert's works drawn by coloured pencils Gilbert's art has been called \\"fantastically elaborate\\". She draws many of her works with coloured pencils, despite calling them \\"such an unreliable medium,\\" in part because she dislikes the mess associated with using paint, ink, or clay. According to Gilbert, her process \\"probably takes as long to prepare an illustration‚Äîsketching roughs, e-mailing them to clients, finding models, props and reference, taking the pictures‚Äîas it does to do the finished piece, and it takes me roughly one week to complete a moderately detailed illustration.\\" She often asks family members and friends to be photographed in certain clothing to aid her in conceptualizing a piece of art. She prefers drawing people to inanimate objects, explaining that if she hadn't become \\"an illustrator, I'd be a forensic psychologist because people and how they work intrigue me.\\" Gilbert remarked of her career that in addition to children's books, she has \\"also gone to the other end of the scale and produced illustrations for Playboy. I go from drawing people in rubber outfits and corsets to pretty fairies!\\" Personal life In 2006, she sold her house near Castle Leazes in Newcastle upon Tyne to move to Toronto with her son and second husband. That same year, Gilbert displayed a large portion of her collection at the Newcastle Arts Centre. She has taught dress design at the Birmingham College of Art, and rescues bull terriers in her free time.

Written and directed by Peter Gould, it aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on September 22, 2013. Plot Ed Galbraith, the \\"disappearer\\", brings Saul Goodman to the basement of his vacuum repair shop. Saul sees Walt, who has also paid for a new identity and relocation. Walt asks Saul to put him in contact with hitmen so he can kill Jack and Jack's gang and recover his other barrels of money, but Saul refuses. Saul tells Walt that if he turns himself in, Skyler might still keep their house instead of losing it to the authorities. Walt thinks of giving up only when his entire wealth is recovered and given to his family, so he refuses. He attempts to coerce Saul into coming with him, but is subdued by a coughing fit. No longer intimidated, Saul bids Walt farewell and leaves for his new life in Nebraska. Jack's gang raids Marie Schrader's house and finds Jesse's confession tape. The gang wants to kill Jesse for being an informant, but Todd wants him to cook more high-quality meth in order to impress Lydia, with whom Todd is now infatuated. Knowing Skyler once met Lydia at the car wash, Todd and some gang members break into the Whites' house and threaten Skyler to keep quiet about Lydia's involvement, and a shaken Skyler complies. Lydia is not convinced Skyler will stay silent, and wants to end their meth operation, but reconsiders after Todd reveals that quality and yield are up because the meth composition is now at 92% purity because of Jesse's work. At Jack's hideout, Jesse uses a paper clip to unlock his chains and tries to run, but is captured. The gang punishes him by taking him to Andrea's house and forcing him to watch as Todd kills her. They threaten to kill Brock if Jesse disobeys again. Ed takes Walt to his new home, a secluded cabin in the woods of northern New Hampshire. Ed tells Walt that he should remain confined to the cabin and the two acres around it or risk being captured. Walt is frequently tempted to leave, but does not. A few months later, a disheveled Walt has a full beard and head of hair. Ed arrives on his monthly visit to drop off food and supplies, including an assortment of eyeglasses and a chemotherapy dose. He tells Walt that Skyler has returned to using her maiden name, that she works as a part-time taxi dispatcher to earn money, and that she and Walt Jr. have left their home for a small apartment. There is a nationwide manhunt for Walt, and his abandoned house is now something of a tourist attraction. A lonely Walt pays Ed $10,000 to stay for an extra hour and play cards with him. Later, Walt stuffs $100,000 into a cardboard box and leaves the cabin. He walks the eight miles into town, stops at the local bar and pays the barmaid to call Walt Jr.'s school pretending to be Marie. Walt Jr. is pulled from class to answer the call, and Walt tries reconciling with him. He tells Walt Jr. that he is going to send money to Walt Jr.'s friend Louis, who should give it to Walt Jr., who should give it to Skyler. Walt Jr. becomes enraged that Walt would attempt to give him drug money, especially after Hank's death. He angrily tells his father to hurry up and die, then hangs up. A dejected Walt intends to surrender and calls the DEA to identify himself, leaving the phone hanging so they can trace his location. Before police arrive, he sees Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz being interviewed by Charlie Rose on TV about their $28 million contribution for drug abuse rehabilitation efforts in the American Southwest. Walt is angered when Elliot and Gretchen openly dismiss his contribution to Gray Matter Technologies to preserve their own ego, and decides to flee. Production Bob Odenkirk made his final (pre-Better Call Saul) appearance as Saul Goodman in this episode. On September 18, 2013, it was announced that both \\"Granite State\\" and \\"Felina\\" would run for 75 minutes including 22 minutes of commercials. The episode title refers to the nickname of New Hampshire, which is where Walt is relocated upon being given a new identity. Parts of the phone call of Walter and Walter Jr. needed to be reshot, because during the transport a Boeing 737 rolled over the film.Breaking Bad Insider Podcast for Episode 515 \\"Granite State\\" 1:17 h This episode marks the final appearance of Bob Odenkirk as a series regular, as his character, Saul Goodman, fled to Nebraska.

Written by Peter Gould and directed by Bryan Cranston, it aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on August 11, 2013 as the mid-season premiere. The episode received high critical acclaim, with critics praising the flashforward scene in the beginning, the ending scene and the performances from Bryan Cranston and Dean Norris. For his performance in the episode, Norris was called \\"Performer of the Week\\" by TVLine.  Plot  In a flashforward, a 52-year-old Walter White arrives at his abandoned and fenced- off house, following the events of \\"Live Free or Die\\". Walt enters and sees \\"HEISENBERG\\" spray-painted on the living room wall. Observing the house's dilapidated state, which includes a group of teenagers using his emptied pool to skateboard, he retrieves the hidden vial of ricin from his bedroom. As he leaves, he greets his former neighbor, Carol, who is shocked by his presence. In the present, Hank Schrader reels from finding Gale Boetticher's handwritten dedication found in Walt's copy of Leaves of Grass, finally realizing that Walt, his brother-in-law, was Heisenberg all along. After excusing himself and his wife Marie from the party at Walt's house, Hank swerves his car off the road on the way home while suffering a panic attack, crashing in a yard. Hank feigns an illness to work from home and takes the opportunity to review case files on Heisenberg and Gus Fring. Hank links people, events, and circumstances, as well as matching the handwriting in the Leaves of Grass dedication with that of the bullet points from Gale's lab notebook, to confirm that Walt is Heisenberg. Walt, who has left the meth business, discusses ways to launder his drug money faster with Skyler, with expansion of their car wash business as an aim. Lydia shows up at the car wash looking distressed and pleads for Walt to return, as the quality of the meth since his retirement has fallen below acceptable standards, jeopardizing their deal. However, Walt dismisses her, and Skyler firmly warns her never to come back. It is later revealed that Walt's cancer has returned, but he keeps this from his family and undergoes chemotherapy again. Meanwhile, Jesse Pinkman feels guilty over his role in Walt's meth business, and is particularly distraught over the deaths of Drew Sharp and (he assumes) Mike Ehrmantraut. He gives all the money he received from Walt to Saul Goodman and asks him to deliver it to Mike's granddaughter and Drew's family. Saul refuses, advising it would raise suspicions, and reports this to Walt. Walt visits Jesse to return his money and lies to him, telling him that Mike is probably still alive somewhere and does not need help taking care of his granddaughter. Jesse is still distressed and later gives a $10,000 bundle to a homeless man. He then drives through a neighborhood, throwing more bundles of cash onto front lawns. In his bathroom, Walt finds his copy of Leaves of Grass missing. Alarmed at the coincidental timing of Hank's apparent illness, his suspicions are deepened when he discovers a GPS tracker on his car. He shows up at Hank's garage and eventually asks him about the tracker; an enraged Hank punches Walt and accuses him of being Heisenberg, which Walt neither confirms nor denies. Walt tells Hank that he would have difficulty proving he is Heisenberg, and even if he did his cancer will probably kill him before he can be jailed. Hank demands Walt leave his children in Hank's care before he will consider Walt's argument, but is refused. Hank utters that he does not know him anymore, to which Walt replies, \\"If that's true, if you don't know who I am, then maybe your best course would be to tread lightly.\\"  Production  = Dedication = The episode is dedicated to Kevin Cordasco, a sixteen-year-old fan of Breaking Bad who had met several members of the series' cast and crew; Cordasco died earlier in 2013 from neuroblastoma. This was the fourth dedication over the course of the series. = Title reference = The term \\"blood money\\" has two meanings; it means money obtained at the cost of another's life, as well as money paid to the family of a person who has been killed, usually by the killer or the killer's clan. = References to other media = In the opening flashforward scene, Walt is seen by his former neighbor Carol, who drops a bag of oranges (which spill and roll across the ground) in fear. Some critics interpret this as a reference to The Godfather, in which oranges represent death. For example, in one scene of The Godfather, after Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is shot, he drops a bag of oranges, which subsequently roll across the ground. = References to past episodes = \\"Blood Money\\" contains several other continuity references to past episodes. Hank's montage, in which he investigates the revelation that Walt is Heisenberg, sees him looking through old case files and pictures. These reference Gus Fring, Gale Boetticher and his notebook (\\"Bullet Points\\"), Dennis Markowski, Jesse's car in Seasons 1 and 2, the bullet-ridden car from his shoot-out with Tuco Salamanca (\\"Grilled\\"), Hector Salamanca, Mike Ehrmantraut, Duane Chow (\\"Full Measure\\"/\\"Madrigal\\"), Ron Forenall, Tyrus Kitt, Gonzo and No-Doze's corpses (\\"Grilled\\"), the gas mask Walt took from the school he worked at, Walt and Jesse stealing a barrel of methylamine (\\"A No- Rough-Stuff-Type Deal\\"), the burned lab (\\"Live Free or Die\\"), and finally, the Heisenberg drawing (\\"No M√°s\\"). When Hank confronts Walt about his identity, he mentions Walt's purposefully crashing the car on their way to Fring's laundromat (\\"Crawl Space\\"), killing the imprisoned members of Fring's drug empire (\\"Gliding Over All\\"), calling him about Marie to distract him from Jesse and the RV (\\"Sunset\\"), and bombing a nursing home (\\"Face Off\\"). Walt also acts like Gus in some scenes. His conversation with Lydia at the car wash references Walt and Gus' earlier conversations at Los Pollos Hermanos, with Walt's role being reversed. In another scene, Walt goes to the bathroom to vomit, turning the sink on to mask the noise and laying a towel down on the floor to kneel on, just as Gus had done in \\"Salud\\". Hank's neighbor's son's remote-controlled car (\\"Seven Thirty-Seven\\") also makes an appearance. The GPS tracker Hank places under Walt's car is the same one he planted on Gus' car in the fourth season. When Jesse opens a pack of cigarettes in front of Huell, Huell seems to remember the ricin-filled cigarette he stole from Jesse in \\"End Times\\".  Reception  = Ratings = The episode originally aired on August 11, 2013, in the United States and Canada on AMC. It aired the next day in the United Kingdom on the web streaming service Netflix. According to the Nielsen ratings system, \\"Blood Money\\" was watched in the United States by an estimated 5.92 million viewers, the most in series history at the time. = Reviews = The episode received widespread critical acclaim, with extensive praise for the performances of Dean Norris and Bryan Cranston. For his performance, Norris was named \\"Performer of the Week\\" by TVLine.\\" Seth Amitin of IGN called the episode a satisfying preparation and set-up for the endgame of the series. Amitin also praised the confrontation at the end between Walt and Hank and the tense dialogue that fueled it. \\"Blood Money was an amalgamation of a bunch of little things to love.\\" Mark Berman of The Washington Post said the episode paid off plot points set up in previous episodes while simultaneously laying groundwork for future episodes. Berman was also surprised at how much ground was covered in Hank's plotline in just one episode. David Berry of National Post called Walt and Hank's showdown abrupt, menacing and cathartic without relieving any of the tension of the storyline. He also praised the acting. After reading other critics' reviews, Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy wrote that \\"['Blood Money'] exceeded the hype and reached new heights.\\" In 2019, The Ringer ranked \\"Blood Money\\" as the 21st best out of the 62 total Breaking Bad episodes.

Written by Thomas Schnauz and directed by Michelle MacLaren, it aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on August 18, 2013.  Plot  Late at night, an elderly man, collecting the money which Jesse has thrown away, discovers him parked in a playground and absentmindedly spinning on a roundabout. Meanwhile, after his confrontation with Hank, Walt frantically tries calling Skyler, but cannot get through as Hank has already reached her. Walt rushes to the car wash, but Skyler has already left to meet Hank at a diner. Hank, believing Skyler to be a victim, unwittingly reveals that Walt's cancer has returned and unsuccessfully tries enlisting her help in building a case against him. Sensing that Hank has his own aims to control the case and have Walt swiftly brought to justice, Skyler panics and leaves. Walt goes to Saul's office, angered that Skyler went to Hank before him. When Saul asks whether Walt has considered having Hank killed, Walt sternly admonishes him, reminding him that Hank is family. Rushing to hide the money he has amassed, Walt has Kuby and Huell deliver it to him in container drums. He then drives to the Tohajiilee Indian Reservation and spends the whole day burying it. Meanwhile, Marie has learned about Walt's criminality and visits Skyler. After learning that Skyler knew about Walt‚Äôs activities prior to Hank being shot, Marie slaps her, despite a tearful Skyler's attempts to apologize. Marie attempts to leave with Skyler‚Äôs daughter Holly in a heated confrontation. Hank enters the house and tells Marie to give Holly back. In the car, Marie tells Hank that he \\"has to get\\" Walt. Walt encodes the GPS coordinates of the buried drums with a lottery ticket, which he posts on the refrigerator door upon his late return home. Unresponsive to Skyler's questioning, an exhausted Walt collapses. When he awakens, Walt offers to surrender himself on the condition that the money be kept for their children. Instead, Skyler tells Walt that they should simply keep quiet since Hank has no real evidence. Elsewhere, Lydia confronts Declan, now in charge of cooking and supplying meth, at his desert lab. She is critical of the poor standards and working conditions, but Declan rejects her suggestion to hire Todd, Walt's former prot√©g√©. At Lydia's behest, Todd and his uncle Jack arrive and massacre Declan and his men in a one-sided shootout before taking over the operation. Believing his career with the DEA will end if he reveals his unsubstantiated suspicion that Heisenberg is actually his brother-in-law, Hank needs evidence to apprehend Walt. Marie insists on putting the whole DEA on the case, but expresses concern over how they might respond when learning that Hank did not share his revelation with them immediately. Hank returns to work, where Agent Steven Gomez reveals that Jesse is currently detained and under questioning. Hank, realizing Jesse's connection to Walt, asks for time with Jesse alone before entering the interrogation room.  Production  Walt's burial scene is on Navajo land, the same spot where Walt and Jesse did their first batch in the RV. The GPS coordinates displayed on Walt's device and on the lottery ticket are in fact the coordinates of the Albuquerque Studios location where Breaking Bad is filmed. = Dedication = The episode is dedicated to Thomas Schnauz, Sr., father of the writer of this episode.  Music  The song played over Walt's digging is Chancha V√≠a Circuito's remix of Argentine Jos√© Larralde's \\"Quimey Neuqu√©n\\".  Reception  = Viewership = The episode was watched by 4.77 million people on its original broadcast, down from the series-high 5.92 million of the previous episode. = Reviews = The episode received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics.

Written by Gennifer Hutchison and directed by Michael Slovis, it aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on August 25, 2013.  Plot  At a diner, Todd recalls how he helped steal methylamine from the train to his uncle Jack and one of his men, Kenny, neglecting to mention the boy he murdered. Agreeing to let Todd cook meth on his own, Jack and Kenny drive back into New Mexico. Meanwhile, Hank tells Jesse that he knows Walt is Heisenberg. Jesse refuses to cooperate, and is released after Saul shows up. Later, Walt Jr. informs his father that Marie has asked him to help repair her computer and invited him to stay for dinner. Walt manipulates his son into staying home by confessing that his cancer has returned. Walt and Skyler invite Hank and Marie to a restaurant. The Whites try to convince the Schraders to keep their children out of the situation, but the Schraders refuse to comply; Marie even callously says that Walt should kill himself to end it all. As the Whites leave, Walt gives his in-laws a DVD of his \\"confession.\\" Playing it at home, Hank and Marie discover it is really a form of blackmail accusing Hank of being the mastermind of the Heisenberg empire and forcing Walt to cook meth for him. A stunned Hank then learns that his surgery and physical therapy were paid at Walt's expense from Marie's unwitting receipt of his drug money, which Skyler had claimed were \\"gambling winnings.\\" This lends credence to Walt's story and torpedoes Hank's credibility. Walt meets with Jesse in the desert and tells him that Saul can contact someone that specializes in creating new identities. He advises Jesse to start over and have a better life. Jesse reacts angrily, asking Walt to stop trying to manipulate him, and saying \\"you're acting like me leaving town is all about me and turning over a new leaf, but it's really about you ... you need me gone ... just say so ... just ask me for a favor.\\" In response, Walt simply embraces Jesse, who cries in his arms. Jesse then agrees to leave, but while packing to do so, Saul scolds him for possessing marijuana for the journey. While Saul makes arrangements for Jesse's departure from Albuquerque, he has Huell take Jesse's marijuana without his knowledge. While Jesse is waiting for the van that will relocate him, he notices the pot is gone, and suddenly realizes that Huell must have pick-pocketed it as well as the ricin cigarette that he previously believed Gus used to poison Brock. Jesse returns to Saul's office and physically attacks him, holding him at gunpoint and demanding to know about his role in Brock's poisoning. Saul admits to his involvement in the plot, but insists he had no idea what Walt's intentions were. As Jesse leaves, Saul calls Walt, who returns in a hurry to the car wash to retrieve a hidden revolver from a vending machine. An enraged Jesse breaks down the door to Walt's house and begins to pour gasoline on the floor.  Production  Millard Drexler, former chairman and CEO of J.Crew Group, had a cameo appearance in this episode as a customer at the Whites' car wash to whom Skyler gives incorrect change. He stated that his scene, in which he says eight or nine words, took nine takes to film.  Reception  = Viewership = The episode was viewed by 4.85 million people on its original broadcast, which was an increase from the 4.77 million of the previous episode. = Reviews = The episode received strongly positive reviews, with Walter's monologue particularly praised.

Written by George Mastras and directed by Michelle MacLaren, it aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on September 8, 2013. The episode was widely acclaimed by television critics.  Plot  Lydia participates in watching a methamphetamine cook performed by Todd. The purity of Todd's product has now improved to 76%, but Lydia notes it lacks the trademark blue coloring, which her foreign buyers demand. Before leaving, she orders Todd to improve his cook. Todd then receives a call from Walt asking his uncle to put a hit on Jesse. Meanwhile, Jesse tells Hank and Gomez about his plan to get Walt, by using Walt's money. At Jesse's lead, Hank visits Huell at a DEA safe house and manipulates him into cooperating by having him believe that Walt has put hits on him, Kuby, and Saul. Hank shows Huell a staged photo of Jesse shot in the head as proof. Huell confesses that he stored Walt's money in barrels, and Kuby gave him a rental van and a shovel, but he does not know where the money is hidden. Hank advises Huell not to answer any calls or leave the house. Walt meets with Todd's uncle Jack and Kenny to discuss the hit on Jesse. Walt is still hesitant because of his past with Jesse and wishes the job to be quick and painless. Jack tells Walt that he will do it only if Walt teaches Todd to cook his signature blue meth, which Walt reluctantly agrees to do. Walt attempts to lure Jesse out into the open by visiting Andrea, telling her that Jesse is using drugs again and Walt hasn't heard from him in a while. Andrea calls Jesse and leaves a voicemail about her and Walt's concern, but Hank intercepts the voicemail and does not tell Jesse. Hank then checks out the van rental company but finds they were forced to remove their GPS trackers six months ago thanks to an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit. Meanwhile, Saul, wearing a bulletproof vest, approaches Walt at the car wash and tells him Huell is missing. Jesse sends Walt a photo of what appears to be his money barrels, and tells Walt the van had a GPS unit and he has found the money. Panicking, Walt frantically rushes to the location, Jesse threatening to burn it all if their call is disrupted for any reason. During the heated phone conversation, Walt apologizes for poisoning Brock but states that he ensured Brock's survival and all the murders he has committed were also committed to protect Jesse. As Walt approaches the desert location where his money was buried, the phone conversation cuts off. Upon arrival, he finds no one there. He then sees another car approaching carrying Jesse and hides, believing Jesse is going to kill him. He calls Jack and gives the gang the GPS coordinates where he buried the money, but then calls it off when he sees that Hank and Gomez are with Jesse. Cornered, Walt gives himself up to Hank, who handcuffs him and reads him his Miranda rights. Walt ignores the request to acknowledge he understands the rights, however, and instead glares at Jesse and calls him a coward. Jesse then spits in Walt's face and a scuffle ensues until Gomez and Hank break them up. Walt is put in the backseat of Gomez's SUV while Jesse is escorted to Walt's car. Hank then calls Marie to inform her that he has caught Walt. However, Jack and his men approach from the desert, having ignored Walt's cancellation, and confront Hank and Gomez. A panicked Walt attempts to defuse the situation to no avail. Jack signals his man Kenny to open fire, beginning a gunfight while Jesse and Walt take cover in their cars to avoid the fusillade of bullets.  Production  = Title reference = The episode is named after the Tohajiilee Navajo Indian Reservation, where Walt and Jesse did their first meth cook, Walt's money is buried, and the gunfight takes place at the end of the episode.

Written by Moira Walley-Beckett and directed by Rian Johnson, it aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on September 15, 2013. The title is a reference to the Percy Bysshe Shelley poem \\"Ozymandias\\", drawing on the poem's theme of collapse following greatness; in a teaser trailer for the show's final eight episodes, the entire poem is recited by lead actor Bryan Cranston. \\"Ozymandias\\" has been acclaimed since its initial airing as one of the finest episodes of Breaking Bad, and many critics regard it as one of the greatest episodes of dramatic television ever produced. At the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards in August 2014, Walley-Beckett won the Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series Emmy for her screenplay, and Bryan Cranston and Anna Gunn won Lead Actor and Supporting Actress Emmys, respectively, for their performances in the episode. This episode marks the final appearance of Dean Norris (Hank Schrader) and Steven Michael Quezada (Steven Gomez), though Hank's voice is heard in the following episode, \\"Granite State\\", and in a flashback in the series finale, \\"Felina\\" (along with Gomez, played by Quezada himself).  Plot  In a flashback set during the \\"Pilot\\", Walt and Jesse are cooking meth for the first time at the Tohajiilee Indian Reservation. Walt calls a pregnant Skyler and makes up an excuse for why he'll be late coming home. Skyler suggests the name Holly for their baby, which Walt finds agreeable. After Walt hangs up, he, Jesse, and the RV fade from view. At present in Tohajiilee, in the aftermath of the shootout, Hank is immobile because of a bullet in his leg, Gomez has been killed, and Jack's gang is left unscathed. Jack orders a search for Jesse and prepares to kill Hank. Walt begs Jack to spare his brother-in-law, offering Jack his entire $80 million fortune, which is buried nearby; he then asks Hank to swear that he will drop the investigation. Hank refuses and chides Walter for not realizing Jack is going to kill him anyway. Jack shoots Hank in the head, and Walt collapses to the ground in despair. Jack's team uses Walt's coordinates to locate and unearth the seven buried barrels of money, loading six into their trucks but leaving one for Walt on Jack's orders after being persuaded by Todd, who sympathizes with and admires Walt. They bury Hank and Gomez in the hole left by unearthing the barrels. Walt spots Jesse's hiding place and betrays him to Jack, reminding Jack that Jack never carried out the hit on Jesse that Walt paid for. Jack's men prepare to kill Jesse, but Todd suggests that they first interrogate him to find out what information he supplied to the DEA. Before Jack's gang takes Jesse away, Walt spitefully reveals to Jesse that he was there when Jane died, and decided not to save her life. At Jack's headquarters, a beaten and frightened Jesse is detained in a cell. Todd escorts him in shackles to a meth lab, where he is chained to a pulley in the ceiling. Jesse notices a surveillance photograph of Andrea and Brock as Todd instructs him to begin cooking. Due to a bullet having punctured his fuel tank, Walt runs out of gas while driving home. Abandoning his car, Walt rolls the money barrel through the desert until he arrives at a house and buys the owner's truck. At the car wash, Marie informs Skyler that Hank has arrested Walt. With Walt now apparently caught, Marie offers to support her sister and their family, but demands that Skyler give up all copies of the false confession video implicating Hank and tell Walt Jr. the truth. Walt Jr. at first refuses to believe that his father is a criminal; he then tells Skyler that if it is true, she is just as bad for going along with it. Reaching home, Walt hurriedly begins packing. Skyler and Walt Jr. soon arrive, and he orders them to do the same. Walt promises to explain everything later, but Skyler assumes that he has killed Hank when Walt will not answer as to Hank's whereabouts. Skyler grabs a kitchen knife and slashes his hand. Walt jumps on top of Skyler in an attempt to wrestle the knife away, but Walt Jr. pulls him off, calls the police, and reports Walt as the attacker in an effort to get Walt arrested. Walt leaves with Holly and a horrified Skyler runs after him, but Walt drives away with her. While in a restroom, Holly utters her first word, \\"mama,\\" several times. The police soon arrive at the White household, as does Marie. They tap the Whites' home phone and try tracing it when Walt calls. After Skyler tells him she is alone, Walt berates her, accuses her of never supporting his criminal activities and says that he did all the work alone when he built up his drug fortune. Skyler is at first confused by his words and tone, but soon realizes Walt knows the phone is tapped and is trying to clear her of involvement in his crimes. When Skyler inquires about Hank's whereabouts, Walt suppresses his weeping and announces that she will never see Hank again. Marie, realizing Hank is dead, breaks down in tears. When Skyler pleads with him to come home with Holly, Walt tells her that he still has things left to do. He destroys his phone and leaves Holly at a nearby fire station with their home address written on a note. The next morning, Walt sits on the side of the highway where Jesse previously waited for Saul's new-identity contact. A red van pulls up and Walt packs in his bags and his single barrel of money, then rides off to his new identity.  Production  Dean Norris made his final on-screen appearance as Hank Schrader in \\"Ozymandias\\" The episode was written by Moira Walley-Beckett and directed by Rian Johnson. Walley-Beckett requested to work with Johnson because of their positive experiences together working on the third-season episode \\"Fly.\\" It aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on September 15, 2013. The song used in the episode is \\"Take My True Love by the Hand\\" by The Limeliters, which is a version of a folk song called \\"Times Are Gettin' Hard, Boys\\". The episode title refers to the poem \\"Ozymandias\\" by Percy Bysshe Shelley, which recounts the crumbling legacy of a once-proud king. Over the course of the episode, most of the main characters fall to their knees out of grief, in keeping with the poem. At the end of the fifth episode of Talking Bad, Vince Gilligan emphasized the line: \\"Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\\" in reference to Walt and his fallen empire. Bryan Cranston recites the entire poem in a 2013 trailer for the series. This episode marks the final appearance of Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) and Gomez (Steven Michael Quezada). On Talking Bad, Norris said that Hank's death was shot in just one take. Hank was originally supposed to die at the end of the previous episode, but it was moved to \\"Ozymandias\\" for better pacing. To preserve the drama of the scene in which Hank is killed, the show's producers secured special permission from the Hollywood guilds to delay showing the credits (which would normally appear immediately after the main title sequence) until 19 minutes into the episode. The opening flashback scene was the last scene to be shot for the entire series. The crew waited to film the episode to allow for Cranston's and Paul's hair to grow in so they would look like they did before Walt began shaving his head and Jesse began wearing his short. Although it was filmed months after the rest of the episode, Johnson was able to return to direct the scene. When Walt holds Holly in a changing room, after taking her from his home, she looks at him and says, \\"Mama\\" several times. Producer Moira Walley-Beckett, who wrote the episode, said during an interview with NBC News that it was unscripted, but when it happened Cranston went along with it. The production team decided it was a moment of \\"movie magic\\".  Reception  = Critical reception = \\"Ozymandias\\" received universal critical acclaim and was described by several publications as the series' best episode, as well as one of the greatest episodes of television ever produced. Critics praised every aspect including the acting by the cast (particularly Bryan Cranston, Anna Gunn, Aaron Paul, Dean Norris, and Betsy Brandt), directing by Rian Johnson, and writing by Moira Walley-Beckett. By the end of 2013, TIME placed the episode number 1 on their list of \\"Top 10 TV Episodes of 2013.\\" Tom Mendelsohn of The Independent speculated that the episode may be the best ever written for television, stating that \\"the show's writers are positively Shakespearian in the thorough way they set about bestowing calamity on their characters. [...] After a slow start to the second part of this fifth and final season, in which the moving parts of this catastrophe engine were painstakingly set into place, the master plan was finally made appallingly clear\\". Seth Amitin of IGN gave the episode a full 10 out of 10 score and called it the \\"most gut- wrenching, twisted, horrific, and well-planned\\" episode of the series thus far and described it as \\"a capitalization on all of the built-up pieces that add up to a puzzle.\\" Amitin additionally lauded the episode's directing and acting, stating that he could \\"taste\\" the episode's \\"cruelty and bitter tears\\". In Amitin's later review of Season 5B as a whole, he referred to the episode as \\"maybe the best episode of TV [he's] ever seen.\\" James Poniewozik of Time magazine noted the significance of both phone conversations between Walt and Skyler, marking the beginning and the end of his journey, respectively. Kevin Yeoman of Screenrant saw the final phone conversation as an act designed to clear Skyler's name and kill off Walt's current identity, with the new one being Mr. Lambert (as seen in the flashforwards in \\"Live Free or Die\\" and \\"Blood Money\\"). Yeoman also noted that the fact that most of the harsh violent scenarios occurred off-screen did not deduct from the cinematic intensity. Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post stated that the episode was indescribable and \\"the hardest episode of TV [she] ever watched\\", describing it as \\"mind-bendingly, soul-churningly devastating\\" and \\"sickening\\". Tim Surette of TV.com called the episode \\"terrific and awful to watch; a powerful piece of television that transcended fiction\\". He also compared the sight of Walt rolling the money barrel in the desert to a dung beetle. Nick Harley of Den of Geek stated that the episode was \\"the single greatest hour of television\\" he had ever seen. On the Breaking Bad Insider podcast, Vince Gilligan revealed that he considers the episode to be the best of the series. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter agreed with Gilligan, and noted that several events that the show had been building up to in past episodes finally came to fruition. On his blog, George R. R. Martin, the creator of the book series A Song of Ice and Fire (which was adapted to the critically acclaimed TV series Game of Thrones), called both the series and the episode \\"amazing\\" and noted that \\"Walter White is a bigger monster than anyone in Westeros\\", adding further \\"I need to do something about that\\". Drusilla Moorhouse, an online contributor to The Today Shows website, remarked how \\"nothing could compare to Walt's cruelty\\" when he revealed to Jesse the truth about his involvement in Jane's death, and described the episode as the destruction of Walt's family; however, she also noted Walt's selflessness when he \\"rewrote the history of [Skyler's] complicity\\" by making the phone call, and when he placed Holly in a fire truck to be safely returned home. TVLine named the two infant actresses Elanor Anne Wenrich and Moira Bryg MacDonald, who both performed the role of Holly White in tandem, the \\"Performer of the Week\\" for their performance in this episode. In 2016, Alan Sepinwall stated, \\"If you were to ask me what is the best hour of dramatic television ever, I would say Breaking Bads 'Ozymandias' and not think twice about it.\\" Mendelsohn has discussed the esteem in which fans also hold the episode by noting that it had received a perfect 10 score from over 12,000 reviewers on IMDb within less than three days, and it still remained on 10. It has remained a 10/10 after 120,850 votes as of October 2020. For its 65th anniversary, TV Guide picked \\"Ozymandias\\" as the best television episode of the 21st century. In 2019 The Ringer ranked \\"Ozymandias\\" as the best episode out of the 62 total Breaking Bad episodes, noting it contains the \\"moment when Walt‚Äôs monstrous selfishness finally shatters his family unit for good\\" and declaring it as \\"indisputably\\" the peak of Breaking Bad. = Ratings = The episode was watched by 6.37 million viewers on its original broadcast, which increased in over a million viewers from the previous episode. = Accolades = Moira Walley-Beckett received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for writing this episode. Bryan Cranston and Anna Gunn both submitted this episode for consideration after being nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, with each winning their categories, as well.

It is the sixteenth episode of season five and the 62nd overall episode of the series. Written and directed by series creator Vince Gilligan, it aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on September 29, 2013. It was followed by a sequel film, El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, which was made available on Netflix on October 11, 2019. The plot involves Walt evading a nationwide manhunt for him in order to return to New Mexico and deliver the remaining profits from his illegal methamphetamine empire to his family. He also takes revenge on the Aryan Brotherhood gang who double-crossed him, killed his brother-in-law Hank, took Jesse captive and presented a threat to his family. Knowing the cancer will soon kill him, Walt revisits his former acquaintances to settle his affairs and prepare himself for the conflict and his death. Upon airing, \\"Felina\\" was met with widespread acclaim from critics. Several critics have called it one of the greatest series finales of all time.  Plot  After leaving the bar, Walt departs New Hampshire in a stolen car. He returns to New Mexico and tracks down Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz at their new house in Tesuque. Walt claims to have hired hitmen, and Badger Mayhew and Skinny Pete use laser pointers to spoof weapon laser sights aimed at them. Walt uses this threat to coerce them to take his remaining $9.72 million and establish a trust fund in their name for Walt Jr., telling them it will \\"make things right\\" for minimizing Walt's involvement in Gray Matter during their television interview. After paying Badger and Pete, he learns from them that blue meth is still being distributed, and deduces that Jesse is likely still alive. On his 52nd birthday, Walt purchases an M60 machine gun and retrieves the ricin from his abandoned house. He connects the machine gun to a pivoting turret inside the trunk of the car he is now driving, which is rigged to the remote unlock button of the car he stole in New Hampshire. He interrupts Todd and Lydia's regular meeting at a coffee shop and offers what he claims is a new formula for methylamine-free meth. Todd turns him down, but Lydia feigns interest to lure Walt into meeting with Jack, knowing he will kill Walt. Skyler receives a phone call from Marie, who warns her that Walt has been seen in Albuquerque. Walt, who is already with Skyler, leaves her the lottery ticket on which he had encoded the location of the money. Following the shootout in the desert, the coordinates now reveal Hank and Steve's hidden grave, and Walt advises Skyler to use the location as leverage in negotiating a favorable plea bargain. Walt admits to Skyler that contrary to his previous claims that he only wanted to make money to support his family after his death, his life as a drug kingpin was for himself. Skyler allows Walt to see Holly while she sleeps. After leaving, Walt watches from afar as Walt Jr. arrives home from school. Walt drives to Jack's hideout and parks alongside the building. He meets inside with Jack and his men, but Jack refuses Walt's meth formula offer and orders him killed. Walt diverts Jack's attention by accusing him of going back on his promise to kill Jesse and instead partnering with him to continue the meth business. Jack responds by ordering that Jesse be brought from the Quonset hut where he is cooking meth so Jack can prove Jesse is a captive, not a partner. Upon seeing Jesse, Walt tackles him out of the line of fire and uses the remote unlock button to fire the machine gun through the building's walls; everyone but Jack, Todd, Jesse, and Walt are killed. Jesse strangles and kills Todd with the chain attached to his handcuffs, and then frees himself with Todd's keys. A wounded Jack attempts to bargain for his life with the location of the money he stole from Walt, but Walt kills him mid-sentence. Walt gives the gun to Jesse and asks Jesse to kill him. Noticing Walt is wounded from the machine gun's fire, Jesse refuses and tells Walt that if he wants to die he can do it himself. As Jesse and Walt leave Jack's hideout, Walt answers Todd's phone and speaks with an obviously ill Lydia. He informs her that Jack and his gang are all dead and that she will soon be dead too because he planted ricin in her stevia during the meeting at the coffee shop. Jesse and Walt exchange a farewell glance before Jesse flees in Todd's El Camino. Walt enters the lab and smiles nostalgically as he admires the equipment, before he falls to the floor and dies. Police rush in as he lies motionless, a slight smile of satisfaction on his face.  Production  Series creator Vince Gilligan wrote and directed \\"Felina\\" Production on \\"Felina\\" and the Breaking Bad series concluded on April 2, 2013, according to Cranston. On September 18, 2013, it was announced that both \\"Granite State\\" and \\"Felina\\" would run 75 minutes, including commercials. The actual runtime of the episodes is 55 minutes. The episode was written and directed by series creator Vince Gilligan. = Title reference and music = The episode title, \\"Felina\\", is inspired by the character Feleena from the song \\"El Paso\\" by Marty Robbins, which plays a major role during the episode. The story of \\"El Paso\\" closely mirrors Walter White's character arc in the final season of Breaking Bad. Walt, who has become a notorious criminal, flees from Albuquerque, living as a fugitive. Despite this being a successful outcome in the context of the story, he finds himself increasingly isolated and dissatisfied. Because his desire for emotional closure outweighs his fear of capture and death, he is eventually driven to return to the scene of his crimes, where he finds the closure he seeks but ultimately meets his end. \\"El Paso\\" is on a Marty Robbins cassette in Walt's car, and is played during the episode. Additionally, Walt sings the song to himself while building his machine gun turret. The writers changed the subject's name from Feleena to Felina so that, when used as the title, it could serve as an anagram of Finale. There are also a number of fan theories regarding the significance of the music: the word Felina can be broken up into three different symbols of chemical elements found in the periodic table: iron (Fe), lithium (Li), and sodium (Na). The title was interpreted by some as \\"blood, meth and tears\\" because iron is a predominant element in blood, lithium is sometimes used in methamphetamine production, and sodium is a component of tears. According to Eric Brown of International Business Times: > \\"In its pure form ... methamphetamine is composed solely of carbon (C), > hydrogen (H) and nitrogen (N), no lithium involved. However, there are > multiple ways to synthesize meth from other ingredients, and several involve > lithium. The Birch reduction, also called the \\"Nazi method,\\" mixes lithium > and ammonia to create a reaction. Another, called the \\"Shake 'n' Bake\\" > method, involved throwing lithium and several other ingredients into a > single pot to create the drug. Both methods are extremely dangerous, as > lithium is a highly volatile element. Unfortunately, there's a big hole in > this theory: Walt never uses a lithium-based synthesis in the show. ... Walt > uses two methods throughout the show: first the Nagai method involving red > phosphorus and later a methylamine P2P reaction resulting in the famous blue > meth. Neither one uses lithium at any point, shooting a big hole in this > theory.\\" Badfinger's \\"Baby Blue\\" is played during the final scene. According to series creator Vince Gilligan, this is reference to the high-quality blue meth Walt had produced over the previous seasons and his life as a drug kingpin which the main character at last recognizes he had enjoyed. According to Rolling Stone, the music supervisors on the show disagreed with Gilligan's choice for the final song; however, music supervisor Thomas Golubiƒá stated that \\"journalists sometimes try to create drama where there isn't any\\" and that his quotes were \\"mis-represented\\". \\"Baby Blue\\" became an obvious choice as the editing came closer to completion with Golubiƒá describing the process of finalizing the song: = El Camino = After the conclusion of the series, Gilligan had considered Jesse's fate, stating that rather than getting caught by police, he had envisioned that Jesse would end up in Alaska to start his life anew. He had mulled this idea over for some years, and as the tenth anniversary of Breaking Bad neared, became interested in producing a work to follow Jesse's fate after this episode. This ultimately resulted in the film El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, which first aired on Netflix on October 11, 2019 and had limited theatric runs that weekend. El Camino, named for the car Jesse escapes in, takes place immediately after the events of \\"Felina\\", and was considered by Gilligan to be a coda to the overall series to close out Jesse's story. Paul returned to star as Jesse, and the film includes brief appearances by Cranston, Plemons, Fraser, Jones, and Baker, among others.  Reception  = Ratings = \\"Felina\\" had the highest ratings of any episode of Breaking Bad: 10.28 million in the United States, including 5.3 million adults aged 18‚Äì49. The episode generated millions of online comments and Nielsen Holdings rankings established that it was the most-discussed episode on Twitter for that week. The popularity of the episode resulted in a 2,981 percent increase of sales of the Badfinger song \\"Baby Blue\\", which features prominently in the ending sequence, as well as a 9,000 percent increase in streaming over Spotify. = Critical reception = Upon airing, the episode received nearly universal critical acclaim. In her review of \\"Felina\\", Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A rating, writing that \\"Walt's purpose is fulfilled, and he just stops\\". Seth Amitin at IGN also praised the episode, calling it \\"fully satisfying\\" and awarding it a score of 9.8 out of 10. Katey Rich agreed with these sentiments, calling the episode \\"a deeply satisfying and surprisingly emotional finale\\". However, Emily Nussbaum, writing in the New Yorker, criticized the episode, claiming it so neatly wrapped up the series in Walt's favor that it seemed more like \\"the dying fantasy on the part of Walter White, not something that was actually happening\\". In 2019 The Ringer ranked \\"Felina\\" as the 19th best out of the 62 total Breaking Bad episodes. = In popular culture = The MythBusters tested the machine-gun turret and proved that it was possible in real life.

It built and runs the Taipei Cultural Mosque. History Chinese Muslim Youth League was established with the name Chinese Muslim Youth Cultural Improvement Association in early 1930s in Mukden during the Second Sino-Japanese War to unite Muslim young men for the war against Imperial Japanese Army and Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. During the late 1940s of Chinese Civil War, many members of Chinese Muslim Youth Cultural Improvement Association migrated to Kwangtung Province. In July 1949 at Canton, the association reorganized themselves with other interested Muslim groups and forming the Chinese Muslim Youth Anti-Communist and Nation-Building League. Later in that year the league left Kwangtung and moved to Taiwan. In 1957, the league adopted its present name, the Chinese Muslim Youth League. Activities The league requires formal registration of its membership. In mid-1969, it recorded 560 members, including 55 Taiwanese converts. Most of the members live in and around Taipei, and some are scattered around Taiwan. Religious identification of Chinese Muslim Youth League is often denied by the Chinese Muslim Association members who call them heretical. In the view of Muslims who live in the non-Islamic areas but intend to keep the Muslim faith, the Chinese Muslim Youth League makes too many compromises with the infidels. This principal reason is the reason for their isolation from the Islamic world. Although the organization never actively sponsor any Islamic missionary work, they still host some conversions, mostly for marriage reason. In general, the league feels that they have more appeal to younger and more progressive groups. It conducts regular classes for younger people and stresses instruction in Islamic law and theology rather than in Arabic language and ceremonial concerns.

Focusing mainly on issues related to the Middle East and the United Nations, she is a strong critic of Israel and the United States and a leading advocate of Palestinian rights. She directs the New Internationalism Project at the Institute for Policy Studies. Career Bennis is a political activist who has been active in the Middle East since the 1970s and who covered the United Nations in the 1980s. In 1987, she witnessed the First Intifada and began to take a serious interest in pro- Palestinian advocacy. She made three additional trips to the Middle East in 1988 and 1989, and her experiences during this period led to a book, From Stones to Statehood: The Palestinian Uprising (1990), in which she describes the first two years of the Intifada and makes the case for a Palestinian homeland. In 1999, Bennis accompanied a group of congressional aides to Iraq, examining the impact of U.S.-led economic sanctions on humanitarian conditions there. Bennis is a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) in Washington, D.C., and of its offshoot, the Transnational Institute in Amsterdam. At IPS, Bennis directs the New Internationalism Project, which ‚Äúworks primarily on Middle East and United Nations issues,‚Äù focusing on ‚Äúthe U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Israeli occupation of Palestine.‚Äù The project makes use of ‚Äúeducation and activism‚Äù in an effort to change American policy and also seeks to ‚Äúdemocratize and empower‚Äù the UN and free it of ‚ÄúU.S. domination.‚Äù She is also a founding member of the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, which was established in 2002 during the Second Intifada, and currently serves on its steering committee. She is a leader of United for Peace & Justice and co-chairs the UN's International Coordinating Network on Palestine. The IPS describes her as having worked with the UN ‚Äúon several issues related to Palestine and the Middle East‚Äù and as advising ‚Äúseveral top UN officials on Middle East and UN democratization issues.‚Äù The IPS adds that she ‚Äúhas played an active role in the growing global peace movement‚Äù since 2002. Views Bennis has suggested that a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would begin with ‚Äúthe creation of a truly independent, sovereign, and democratic State of Palestine to be constructed on the 22 percent of historic Palestine that Israel occupied in 1967: the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem.‚Äù Under this arrangement, ‚ÄúIsrael and Palestine, as equals, would jointly exchange full diplomatic relations‚Äù and ‚ÄúIsraeli settlers would be given the option of moving to new homes inside Israel, or remaining in their homes as citizens of Palestine.‚Äù In addition, ‚ÄúJerusalem would be an open city, with two separate capitals within it: the capital of Israel in West Jerusalem, and the capital of Palestine in East Jerusalem.‚Äù She also advocates for Palestinians' right of return to Israel. Although she formerly supported a two-state solution as the ultimate means of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Bennis has joined leaders of the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement leadership in advocating the ultimate creation of a single bi-national state. In her primer, Understanding the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict: A Primer, Bennis champions the one-state solution, arguing that ‚Äúcreating a Palestinian state on only part of historic Palestine represents an historic injustice.‚Äù She further claims that ‚ÄúPalestine has the potential to reach as high a technological and scientific level‚Äù as Israel, ‚Äúlargely through the intellectual capital of its young and highly educated population.‚Äù Bennis is a staunch opponent of what she regards as American imperialism and believes that actions should be taken to counter American and Western global hegemony. In the 1990s, she opposed US-led sanctions against Iraq and the US war on Iraq. In the early 2000s, she came out strongly against the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, and has supported anti-American movements in those countries. Deploring what she sees as the excessive influence of the US at the UN, she has argued that the international organization ‚Äúdesperately needs reform,‚Äù and she blames the failure to implement reform on the ‚Äúanachronistic‚Äù determination of US and other Security Council permanent members ‚Äúto orchestrate the post-war world.‚Äù According to the Anti-Defamation League, Bennis ‚Äúhas repeatedly accused the 'Israel lobby' of pushing for a war against Iran‚Äù and ‚Äúis often critical of Israel, including referring to Israel as an 'apartheid' and 'pariah' state.‚Äù The ADL noted that in her 2008 primer, Iran in the Crosshairs: How to Prevent Washington‚Äôs Next War, Bennis ‚Äúdefends Iran and challenges White House concerns that Iran intends to build nuclear weapons, going so far as to argue that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad‚Äôs calls to 'wipe Israel off the map' were misinterpreted and that really, 'the threat is the other way around' because Israel is pushing for a war against Iran.‚Äù The ADL also noted her conviction that the US position on Iran was shaped by ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äôs powerful lobbies.‚Äù Bennis celebrated a Washington, D.C., march called ‚ÄúOne Nation Working Together,‚Äù held in 2010 and sponsored by a coalition of organizations including the NAACP, the SEIU, the AFL-CIO, the National Council of La Raza, the Center for Community Change, and the US Students Association. The ‚Äúuniting issue‚Äù was jobs, with placards reading ‚ÄúJobs Not War‚Äù indicating ‚Äúthe connection between our out of control military budget...and the jobs crisis.‚Äù Bennis opposed Western intervention in Libya in a March 2011 article for Al-Jazeera, questioning its credibility and saying that it threatened ‚Äúthe Arab Spring.‚Äù Bennis argued in Al-Jazeera in August 2011 that if rebel leaders in Libya wished to be successful, they would have to stop being dependent on the US and NATO. She made similar arguments about Syria in 2012, saying that it was important ‚Äúto make sure the U.S. is kept out of Syria militarily‚Äù because US military involvement could only ‚Äúlead to greater civilian casualties.‚Äù She described ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's August 2011 trial as ‚Äúthe iconic emblem of the Arab Spring: a repressive US-backed dictator, suddenly brought down by popular mobilization and displayed behind bars in the defendants' cage of a Cairo courtroom.‚Äù Bennis argued in a September 2011 article for Al-Jazeera that the world was not changed by the September 11 attacks but by ‚Äúthe events of September 12, when the George W. Bush administration made the decision to take the world to war,‚Äù a decision whose consequences, in her view, continue ‚Äúto threaten the world's security and shred US democracy.‚Äù Noting the simultaneous exchange and release by Hamas of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit and by Israel of 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, Bennis argued in an October 2011 article for Al-Jazeera that the disparity in numbers reflected the ‚Äúcontrol Israel wields over the occupied Palestinian population‚Äù: while Hamas ‚Äúcontrol[s] the life of exactly one Israeli, a captured soldier,‚Äù Israel ‚Äúdirectly maintains power over the lives of thousands of Palestinian prisoners.‚Äù To Bennis, Israel's holding of Palestinian prisoners is not about addressing genuine security threats but about \\"demoralis[ing]\\" Palestinians and \\"undermin[ing] the family unity that provides the crucial basis for Palestinians' sumud, or steadfastness, in resisting occupation.\\" In a January 2013 article for Al-Jazeera, Bennis described as ‚Äúunsurprising‚Äù Israel's imprisonment of Richard Falk, UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in December 2008, given that ‚ÄúIsrael has for years responded with outrage to human rights criticism and, with US backing, has increasingly directly repudiated UN authority and legitimacy.‚Äù Describing Falk as ‚Äúscrupulously fair,‚Äù Bennis chastised Human Rights Watch for criticizing him and thus lending credibility to ‚Äúthe litany of false attacks‚Äù against him. In another January 2013 article, Bennis described Falk as one of ‚Äúthe most important international defenders of human rights in the occupied territories,‚Äù and characterized criticism of him by Israel, the US, and Human Rights Watch as the results of ‚Äúsmear campaigns launched by UN Watch, a right-wing outfit in Geneva known for its anti-UN, anti-Palestinian, pro-Israel and anti-human rights agenda.‚Äù When Bennis was placed on the shortlist to replace Falk, UN Watch opposed her candidacy and was in part responsible for her not being appointed. One of Bennis' colleagues Fiona Dove stated in respects to the withdrawn candidacy that \\"Phyllis Bennis was subject to scurrilous attacks by the Israeli press\\". UN Watch responded that \\"if quoting terror apologists‚Äô own words constitute ‚Äúscurrilous attacks,‚Äù we plead guilty\\" to having done so. Bennis argued in January 2013 that the US could save money by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy, ending subsidies on fossil fuels, and cutting military spending. She cited US National Intelligence Estimates and reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency to argue in February 2013 that concerns about Iran's nuclear capability are outrageously exaggerated and that if ‚Äúthe threat of war still looms‚Äù it is not because of actual threat assessments, but because of ‚Äúbelligerent‚Äù politicians. ‚ÄúEven a theoretical future nuclear-armed Iran,‚Äù she argued, ‚Äúwould not be a threat to the existence of Israel‚Äù but only ‚Äúto Israel's longstanding nuclear monopoly in the Middle East.‚Äù This, she maintained, ‚Äúis the real threat motivating Israel's attack-Iran-now campaign.‚Äù Bennis mocked U.S. President Barack Obama in March 2013 for giving a speech on the West Bank that was full of ‚Äúsoaring language in which he urged justice, reminding the world that the occupation can't remain,‚Äù even as he refused ‚Äúto acknowledge any of the immediate realities on the ground ‚Äî the Wall, the checkpoints, the occupation soldiers preventing Palestinians from moving within their own land.‚Äù She also criticized Obama's support for a two-state solution, arguing that it ‚Äúhas been rendered essentially impossible by unchecked settlement expansion.‚Äù Bennis signed a 2013 statement calling the US war in Iraq \\"illegal and illegitimate\\" and \\"based on lies\\", and stating that bringing \\"democracy and freedom to Iraq... was never on the US agenda.\\" Bennis praised \\"Iraqi civil society\\" in April 2013, saying that it \\"has been in motion in extraordinary, impressive ways.\\" Not only is it ‚Äúnon-violent,‚Äù she said, but it has also \\"challeng[ed] the existence of a sectarian government system that was put in place by the United States at the very beginning of its occupation.\\" Bennis reacted to the appointment of John Kerry as Secretary of State by lamenting in April 2013 that \\"There is no indication Israel is any more willing than it ever was to stop violating international law and UN resolutions. There is no evidence that any of the 600,000 or so illegal settlers who are violating international law every morning just by getting out of bed, are at all worried about losing either their illegally built homes or their military protection and privileges guaranteed by the Israeli state. There is no sign the siege of Gaza is being canceled. And most important, there is no hint that the US is prepared to bring any pressure to bear on Israel to end any of those violations.\\" Writings Bennis is the author of nine books and the co-editor of two. *From Stones to Statehood: The Palestinian Uprising (1990); *Calling the Shots: How Washington Dominates Today's UN (2000); *Before & After: US Foreign Policy and the September 11th Crisis (2003) [US Policy and the War on Terrorism, 2nd ed.]; *Challenging Empire: How People, Governments, and the UN Defy US Power (2006); *Understanding the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict: A Primer (2009); *Ending the Iraq War: A Primer (2009); *Understanding the US-Iran Crisis: A Primer (2009); *Ending the US War in Afghanistan: A Primer (2010); *Understanding ISIS and the New Global War on Terror: A Primer (2015) She is also co-editor of Beyond the Storm: A Gulf Crisis Reader (1991) and Altered States: A Reader in the New World Order (1993).

It is located approximately north of the city of Chillicothe, Ohio on the left bank of the Scioto River. The site should not be confused with the earthworks in Hamilton County on the Great Miami River near Dunlap's Station, the former site of a pioneer fort. Survey history Ephraim George Squier and Edwin Hamilton Davis visited the site in 1846. They shared the analysis of their survey in their 1848 publication, Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley. In their survey of the site, they reported that one work is shaped as a rhomboid. Off of the rhomboid work was an avenue. One side of the avenue headed southwest 1,130 feet. The other side was shorter and ended at a small circle. The west side of the work was a plain elevated a number of feet above the rhomboid itself. An extension of the work was 80 feet wide and 280 in length. The plain overlooked another, larger earthwork, with a large gateway providing access. Towards the end of the avenue stopped 60 feet short of another gateway. The gateway was 120 feet wide. The end of the avenue had a small mound. An additional mound was just south of the main work. That mound was surrounded by a ditch and a low embankment. Another half a mile away was a group of mounds close to the avenue on the lower level. One mound was truncated at 15 feet high and 100 feet in diameter. At the truncated top, it was 50 feet in diameter. Squier and Davis noted that the lower level may have suffered from flooding on occasion. In their 1848 report, they share that the truncated mound was a respite from a flood for a family, their horses, cattle and belongings during a flood of 1832. That mound was excavated and human skeletons were found two to five feet deep into the mound. Squier and Davis believed that the skeletons those of \\"modern Indians.\\" Sherds and shells were discovered within and around the mound. Pottery was also discovered during modern cultivation. Squier and Davis hypothesized that the pottery was made by \\"modern\\" Native peoples.

He went on to form the post-hardcore band War Generation, and, at the time of his death, he was the lead vocalist known as \\"Johnny Scars\\" for the band Lucky Scars. Biography Bunch was born Jonathan James Esbern Bunch in Harbor City, California, and came up in the hardcore punk rock scene in the South Bay of Los Angeles. He and Chris Evenson founded the hardcore punk band Reason to Believe (1986‚Äì1990). The band released The Next Door and When Reason Sleeps Demons Dance on the hardcore and punk label Nemesis Records. Bunch and his Reason to Believe bandmates evolved to form the post-hardcore band Sense Field (1990‚Äì2004), an emo band. The band signed to Revelation Records and later to Warner Bros. Records. Sense Field released five albums and six EPs in the United States. Under the Canadian independent label Nettwerk, the band saw its greatest mainstream success with the single \\"Save Yourself\\" from the 2001 album Tonight and Forever. The song also appeared on the soundtrack for the science fiction series Roswell. During that period, Sense Field also appeared on The Tonight Show and The Late Late Show. Bunch and Evenson were featured in a pictorial spread for Rolling Stone. The group disbanded in early 2004. Later in 2004 Bunch joined the Florida-based post-hardcore band Further Seems Forever and recorded one album with them entitled Hide Nothing. He sang with that outfit until 2006. That same year, Bunch and his Further Seems Forever bandmate, Derick Cordoba, toured Europe under the banner Fields Forever, playing acoustic versions of Sense Field and Further Seems Forever songs. In late 2012 Bunch reunited with his Sense Field bandmates for two Revelation Records 25 Year Anniversary shows on June 7, 2012, at The Glass House in Pomona, California, and on January 6, 2013 in Chicago. Bunch was fronting the post-hardcore band War Generation, which he formed with Brad Lehmann (Maylene and the Sons of Disaster). War Generation is currently signed to Rise Records. Their album, Start Somewhere, Never Surrender, was released September 3, 2013. War Generation supported the album with a U.S. tour with The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus in the fall of 2013. Bunch died on January 31, 2016 in Irvine, California, at the age of 45. His cause of death was ruled a suicidal overdose.

It is a subsidiary of French-based, international Transdev. It was formed in 2013 by grouping the operations of Veolia Transport AustraliaAbout Veolia Transport (May 2007), Veolia Transport Australia, Retrieved 9 January 2016 and former Transdev together, as a result of the global rebranding from Veolia Transdev to Transdev. As of September 2019, Transdev Australasia employed more than 5,800 people and operated 2,100 vehicles and vessels, delivering more than 150 million customer journeys each year across Australia and New Zealand. Current operations =New South Wales= A Transdev NSW Volvo B7RLE Sydney Light Rail Urbos 3 at a station on the Dulwich Hill Line Transdev NSW Transdev NSW is a bus company operating services in the southern and western suburbs of Sydney, including those previously by Transdev Shorelink Buses. The origins of the company that is now Transdev NSW can be traced back to February 1935 when GH Ramsay commenced a bus service between Sutherland station and Woronora River. After series of purchases and changes of name, the company was purchased by Connex in 1999 and rebranded Transdev NSW in 2013. Since 2005, the company's services have formed part of Sydney Bus Regions 10 and 13,Region 10 Transport NSWRegion 13 Transport NSW with the company also taking responsibility for Region 12 from Transdev Shorelink Buses in 2013.

Transdev Sydney operates light rail services in Sydney on behalf of Transport for NSW.Maintenance Contract Transport for NSW The light rail network includes the Dulwich Hill Line and from 2019, the CBD and South East Light Rail. Formerly known as Veolia Transport Sydney, it also operated the Sydney Monorail until June 2013. The operation of the light rail and monorail in August 1998 was Veolia Transport's first venture into Australia, and was still known as CGEA Transport back then.Stock Exchange Announcement Australian Infrastructure Fund 11 August 1998 CGEA Transport formed a joint venture (51%) with Sydney Light Rail Company (SLRC), which were the owners of the Sydney Light Rail, called CGEA Transport Sydney. The joint venture was formed to purchase TNT Transit Systems, the owner of the monorail and operator of the light rail. This resulted in CGEA Transport owning the monorail as well as operating the light rail. CGEA Transport, already renamed to Connex in 1999, sold its share of the monorail to the SLRC in early 2001. The SLRC and CGEA Transport Sydney (without the Connex share) later combined to form Metro Transport Sydney. Metro Transport Sydney continued to contract the operation services to the Connex, whose subsidiary was known as Veolia Transport Sydney since 2005. After the Metro Transport Sydney's purchase by the Government of New South Wales on 23 March 2012, the operation contract with Veolia Transport Sydney was maintained. The monorail was decommissioned on 30 June 2013.Monorail Removal Project Transport for NSW A new contract, beginning in mid 2015, covering operation of the Inner West and CBD and South East Light Rail lines was signed with the ALTRAC Light Rail consortium in December 2014.

He built the Giardini Botanici Hanbury, or Hanbury botanical gardens, at Mortola, between Ventimiglia and Menton, on the coast of Italy near to the border with France. Early life Thomas Hanbury was born on 21 June 1832 at Bedford Road, Clapham, Surrey. He was the fourth child and third son of a pharmaceutical chemist, Daniel Bell Hanbury (1794‚Äì1882), and his wife Rachel, n√©e Christy, (c. 1802‚Äì1876). His eldest brother was the botanist and pharmacognosist Daniel Hanbury (1825‚Äì1875). The Hanburys were Quakers, and members of the family had been members of the Society of Friends since its beginnings in the seventeenth century. His great- aunt was the philanthropist and centenarian Elizabeth Hanbury. Thomas Hanbury was sent to predominantly Quaker schools, first in Croydon, and then in Epping. He remained a Friend all his life. China From 1849 Hanbury worked for the tea brokers William James Thompson & Sons in Mincing Lane, London. In 1853 he travelled to Shanghai, which had opened to foreign commerce in 1843. With three partners and with the financial backing of his uncle, he started Hanbury & Co., merchants in silk and tea. The partnership dissolved in 1857, and Hanbury and Frederick Bower entered into a new one, Bower, Hanbury & Co., which diversified into currency trading and cotton broking. Hanbury became extremely wealthy, and was the largest holder of property in Shanghai. Hanbury arrived in China at a time of widespread civil unrest. In 1854 there were five separate rebellions within the country: the Nien Rebellion, the Red Turban Rebellion (1854‚Äì1856), the Miao Rebellion, the Small Knife Society and the vast Taiping Rebellion (1850‚Äì64), which has been described as the \\"most gigantic man-made disaster\\" of the nineteenth century. The Taiping rebels had taken Shanghai in 1851, but lost it to Qing dynasty forces in January 1853. The Small Knife Society occupied old Shanghai and many surrounding villages from 1854 to February 1855. The European residents of Shanghai lived in self- governing settlements or concessions outside the city walls, in physical and social isolation from the local population. Hanbury took the unusual step of learning Mandarin Chinese. He travelled within the country, and was soon trusted and respected by local people. When he finally left Shanghai in 1871, his Chinese acquaintances and friends brought him so many parting gifts that he begged them to stop. Hanbury was a member of the Anglo-American Municipal Council of Shanghai, and helped set up a hospital and plant gardens in the concession. He was a director of the first railway line to be built in China, the short-lived Woosung Railway. The first telegraph message from Shanghai to Hong Kong was sent from his office. La Mortola Hanbury visited Europe between 1866 and 1869, and in 1867 travelled on the C√¥te d'Azur. He saw and purchased the abandoned villa of the Orengo di Roccasterone family at Mortola, where he planned to make a botanical garden with the help of his brother Daniel. Hanbury married Katharine Aldham Pease (1842‚Äì1920) of Westbury-on- Trym, now a suburb of Bristol, in 1868. They travelled to China in 1869, where Hanbury wound up his business, and returned to live at La Mortola in 1871. The Orengo villa was restored, and Daniel had already begun planting the gardens, which eventually extended over 18 of the 45 hectares of the estate, and came to be known as the Giardini Botanici Hanbury. The couple had four children: Cecil, Horace, Daniel and Hilda. =The Giardini Botanici Hanbury= In December 1868 Hanbury employed as head gardener the botanist and garden designer Ludwig Winter, then 22 years old, who remained at La Mortola until 20 June 1875. From 1873 Hanbury also employed a curator of the gardens. The first of these was Gustave Rutschi, from 1873 to 1876. He was followed by Gustav Cronemeyer, compiler of the first published catalogue of 1889, curator from 1883 to 1892. When Cronemeyer died in 1892, Kurt Dinter took over and remained until his departure for German South-West Africa in 1897. From then until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Alwin Berger was curator. The gardens received many visitors. Among these was Queen Victoria, in 1882; others included her son Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught with his wife Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia; his brother Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany; his sister Princess Beatrice; Princess Eugenie; King Albert of Saxony and Queen Carola; Prince Ernest of Saxe-Coburg; the then Prince of Naples; and Kuo Sung Tao, the first Qing dynasty minister to be accredited in Europe.

History In the middle of the 19th century, the town of Bocholt (including the cotton industry) developed plans to connect to the new railway network. In 1856, the Holland Line was opened by the Cologne-Minden Railway Company (C√∂ln-Mindener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, CME), but ran from Wesel along the Rhine via Emmerich to Arnhem, missing Bocholt. Several initiatives launched by businessmen from Cologne and M√ºnster were not able raise the necessary capital to build a line to Bocholt. On 26 May 1875, the CME finally received a concession for the construction of a branch line from Wesel to Bocholt, which was opened for passenger traffic on 1 July 1878. Two years later on 25 August 1880, the Dutch Westphalian Railway Company (Niederl√§ndisch-Westf√§lische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) opened the Winterswijk‚ÄìBocholt railway, turning the terminal station into a through station. In 1901, after the nationalisation of most of Prussia‚Äôs private railway companies, the opening of the Empel-Rees‚ÄìM√ºnster railway by the Prussian state railways from Empel-Rees to Bocholt on 1 August 1901 and its continuation to Borken on 1 August 1902 made Bocholt into a junction station. Since the end of the 20th century, with the closure of the two newest lines, Bocholt station has become a terminus again. Operations The line is served by Regional-Express service RE 19a (Der Bocholter). In Wesel it connects with Regional-Express services RE 5 (Rhein-Express, towards Oberhausen, D√ºsseldorf and on to Koblenz), RE 19 (Rhein-IJssel-Express, towards Oberhausen and D√ºsseldorf) and RE 49 (Wupper-Lippe-Express, towards Oberhausen, Essen and Wuppertal. RB 32 is operated by Abellio Rail NRW hourly on weekdays and every two hours on Saturday afternoons and on Sundays. It is operated with Alstom Coradia LINT diesel multiple units, which can only run at 80 km/h on this track, despite their maximum speed of 120 km/h. The siding of the precast concrete plant of Max B√∂gl in Hamminkeln is served as necessary to supply materials for construction projects, mostly tunnels, by trains operated by Bocholter Eisenbahngesellschaft mbH on behalf of DB Schenker. A signalman is stationed at the precast concrete plant for this traffic. The route is now part of DB‚Äôs M√ºnster-Ostwestfalen (M√ºnster-East Westphalia) regional network (MOW), which has its headquarters in M√ºnster. In the local press of 16 May and 20 May 2011 it was revealed that the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (Rhine-Ruhr Transport Association, VRR) was undertaking a feasibility study that would examine the electrification of the Bocholt railway. After the upgrade, if necessary, the operations of Regionalbahn service RB 32 would be abandoned and Regionalbahn service RB 33 (Rhein-Niers-Bahn) would be extended to Bocholt. This would provide a through-service from Bocholt to the Ruhr region. The feasibility study was completed in January 2012. In a press release of 22 March 2013 announcing the award of the operations of the Lower Rhine network to Abellio Rail GmbH from 2016, the VRR announced that the feasibility study on the electrification of the railway to Bocholt was much more positive than expected. The electrification with a design speed of 80 km/h would cost 'only' ‚Ç¨12 million; with a design speed of 100 km/h it would cost ‚Ç¨15 million, which is far below the initial estimates of ‚Ç¨20 million. Electrification of the Bocholt Railway would allow it to be integrated into the Lower Rhine network. The VRR undertook further planning with the aim of completing the electrification in December 2016. The electrification has been delayed until the end of 2022. The line has been served by Alstom Coradia LINT diesel railcars since the takeover of operation by Abellio Rail NRW in December 2016 and this will continue until 2022. It is planned to use Stadler Flirt railcars after the completion of the electrification. From then on, there will be direct connections from Bocholt to D√ºsseldorf. This is to be achieved by integration into the Linie RE 19 line, with sets planned to be coupled or uncoupled in Wesel. In June 2018, it was announced that the implementation of the infrastructure measures was threatened by a further delay, as the municipality of Hamminkeln was not prepared to pay its share to improve the safety of three private level crossings. This is necessary to be able to increase the speed from 80 km/h to 100 km/h. Hamminkeln was seeking to have the financing clarified legally, while the VRR stated that the new timetable concept could not then be implemented at the timetable change in December 2019. In March 2019, it became known that the implementation of the electrification of the line was delayed indefinitely and could not be implemented at the timetable change in December 2019. This was due to delays in the planning approval procedure and coordination problems with the overhead line masts that are being used in conjunction with the upgrade of the Oberhausen‚ÄìEmmerich line. Since Abellio Rail NRW took over operations in December 2016, the route has been operated with Alstom Coradia LINT DMUs. This was expected to continue until 2019 when electrification of the line was scheduled to be completed and the operation of Stadler Flirt EMUs was planned. Electrification has since been deferred. These will run directly from Bocholt to D√ºsseldorf. This will be realised by the inclusion of the line into the route of the Rhein-IJssel-Express (RE 19), which will involve portion working, with sets being split or joined in Wesel.

The main reason for creating Mailbird came from their frustration with other current email clients like Postbox and Thunderbird, which were too slow and had a cluttered non-intuitive user interface in their view. Bodekaer and Olsen wanted to innovate the email experience, and create a better email software program which would address these challenges in other email clients. After receiving very positive feedback and pre-beta signups, they decided to found the company under the name of Mailbird and assemble a team in February & March 2012.

Written in 1977, the play is loosely based on Hamlet by William Shakespeare. The play originated in relation to a translation of Shakespeare's Hamlet that M√ºller undertook. Some critics claim the play problematizes the role of intellectuals during the East German Communism era; others argue that the play should be understood in relation to wider post- modern concepts. Characteristic of the play is that it is not centred on a conventional plot, but partially connects through sequences of monologues, where the protagonist leaves his role and reflects on being an actor. Overview The play is constituted of scenes. The whole text is roughly nine pages long. The script itself is extremely dense and open to interpretation; recurring themes include feminism and the ecology movement. The play remains M√ºller's most-often performed and (arguably) his best-known today; M√ºller himself directed a seven-and-a-half-hour performance of Hamlet (in which Die Hamletmaschine was the play-within-a-play) in Berlin in 1990. Performance history Hamletmachine had its world premiere in 1979 at Th√©√¢tre G√©rard Philipe in Saint-Denis, France. The U.S. premiere of the play was performed in March 1984 by Freies Theater M√ºnchen at the University of South Florida. This was followed in December of the same year by a production at the Theater for the New City in New York and in May 1986 by a production at New York University, which was directed by Robert Wilson. The British premiere was on March 7, 1985 at the Gate Theatre in London, in a double bill with Heiner M√ºller's Mauser, both directed by Paul Brightwell, who had previously directed a student production of M√ºller's Cement at the University of Essex. The production of Hamletmachine was described as \\"a stage teeming with images\\" and \\"an electrifying message from East Germany\\" by Nicholas De Jongh in the Guardian. In 1992, the play was presented by the University of California, Irvine, directed by Keith Fowler, as a bloody fantasy set in a \\"Frankenstein laboratory,\\" in which industrial meat hooks served to \\"float\\" Ophelia. In 2002, the Los Angeles Times published a 35-year retrospective of cutting edge art \\"on the wilder side,\\" and UC Irvine's Hamletmachine was one of five \\"bloodiest\\" events listed.Friedman, Dan, ed., Mueller in America,, \\"Who is He Supposed to Be?\\", pub. Castillo Cultural Center, 2003. In 1992 Josef Szeiler and Aziza Haas elaborated the Hamletmachine in Tokyo in parallel to a production of Hamlet by the Tokyo Engeki Ensemble, known for its traditional Brecht adaptations, which was confronted with the open and experimental approach Szeiler and Haas had first developed as members of TheaterAngelusNovus. The project resulted in a new translation of Hamletmachine into Japanese and 15 experimental performances ranging from 45 minutes to 12 hours. It was documented in the book HamletMaschine.Tokyo.Material.Aziza Hass (ed.): HamletMachine.Tokyo.Material. Eine Theaterarbeit von Josef Szeiler und Aziza Haas in Japan. Berlin 1996. In 2007 it was performed in the Samuel Beckett Theatre in Dublin, Ireland, directed by Paul Carton. In 2010, Wang Chong directed the first production of Hamletmachine in China. References to the Chinese and North Korean political situations caused controversy. However, the show toured Beijing and Hangzhou without getting banned. The show was performed by four Chinese opera actors and one child. Critics called it \\"deconstructed Chinese opera\\" and \\"the most exciting work at the Beijing International Fringe Festival\\". In 2016 Vitalyi Goltsov directed the first production of Hamletmachine in Ukraine. It was in Chernihiv Teatre of puppets. Adaptations Hamletmachine has had various adaptations in other media: * Hamletmachine, a radio drama, including music by Einst√ºrzende Neubauten, which was released as a compact disc in 1991. Blixa Bargeld played the part of Prince Hamlet and Gudrun Gut played Ophelia. * Die Hamletmaschine-Oratorio, an oratorio by composer Georges Aperghis * Die Hamletmaschine, a 1987 opera by Wolfgang Rihm * Szenische Kammermusik nach Heiner M√ºllers ‚ÄúHamletmaschine‚Äù, a 1991 classical piece for five instruments by Ruth Zechlin * Hamletmachine: A Non-Long Movie, a 2010 short film by Barcelona filmmaker Agustin Calderon. In 2016, the film was released on the website Vimeo. Derivative works In 2011, Puerto Rican-American author Giannina Braschi published the novel United States of Banana, a critique of corporate America, basing the work on Hamletmachine. In 2013, Citi Garage Theatre in Santa Monica, CA premiered Opheliamachine, a postmodernist drama by the Polish-born American playwright and dramaturg, Magda Romanska. Opheliamachine was a response to Heiner Mueller's Hamletmachine. The production received critical acclaim from many LA-based media.

Life She was the third of four daughters born to Polish nobles, Count Stanis≈Çaw Korwin Krasi≈Ñski (1717‚Äì1762), and his wife, Aniela n√©e Humiƒôcka. Franciszka was born on the family's Maleszowa estate. The Krasi≈Ñskis attended the royal court in Warsaw, where she would eventually meet her future husband, Charles of Saxony, Duke of Courland. Franciszka and Charles reportedly fell mutually in love when she was just 15. In 1757, they asked her family to support their plan to marry. Her father and her uncle by marriage, Prince Antoni Lubomirski, both supported their wish, especially as Charles was in line to become Duke of Courland, which happened in 1758. Her paternal aunt, Princess Zofia Lubomirska, on the other hand, took a sober attitude and commented that her brother and husband \\"... are convinced that his daughter will one day rule... I cannot agree with what he writes\\", as she did not believe in Charles's honest intentions. Besides, in her view his family would not allow such a marriage and he would have to abandon her niece. =Morganatic marriage= On 25 March 1760 Franciszka Krasi≈Ñska finally married Prince Charles of Saxony. Although she was of noble birth, she did not belong to a reigning or immediate dynasty, so she and Charles married in secret. As a result, she was not entitled to share his dynastic title. [accessed = 2018.11.23] Her aunt Zofia now won over, demanded together with August Czartoryski, that Charles openly recognize Franciszka as his legal wife. After the death of Franciszka's compliant father in 1762, aunt Zofia's husband, Prince Antoni Lubomirski, became legal guardian of her \\"officially unmarried\\" niece and her three sisters. Zofia Lubomirska was then in a position to have more influence over Charles in the matter. In January 1764, during the Interregnum, Charles did officially recognize the marriage, and Zofia Lubomirska tried to negotiate with him to have him announce his candidacy for the Polish throne, which would have given Franciszka the chance to become queen. In the event he declined. As the young couple lived separate lives, Franciszka Krasi≈Ñska, now Wettin, often stayed with her aunt and uncle. She visited Warsaw with her aunt during the Radom Confederation and accompanied her on a trip to Zofia's estate in Opole, where Franciszka was reunited with Charles in 1775. Later that year, in response to Charles's own persistence and that of other supporters at the Saxon royal court, the marriage was finally recognized, though only as a morganatic marriage - an alien concept in the Republic of Two Nations where all nobles counted as members of a single class. However Franciszka's hereditary title of princess was arranged and granted by Emperor Joseph II and not by the Prussian court. Franciszka and her daughter moved to Saxony to live with Charles in his castle. She was accorded an annuity by the Polish Sejm.Anna Wildacka. A Polish Great-Grandmother of an Italian Dynasty.

In 1997 and 1998, it was used in the SR2 and the CN category of the International Sports Racing Series. Two cars are known to have been built. History =National events= In 1991, Centenari entered Federico D'Amore and a M1 in several Italian Prototype Championship events. The best result of the season was a third-placed finish at Enna-Pergusa. For 1992, D'Amore left the team, and Stefano Speranza was entered at Monza, but failed to finish. Arturo Merzario was then entered in two races, with his best finish being eighth at Vallelunga. The car was not used again in 1993, but Merzario used the car from 1994 until 1997 in the series. He took the car's first ever victory at Vallelunga in 1995, and he would take four more Italian Prototype Championship victories in the car. The team started their 1998 season at the 1000 km Monza, which was part of the GT Italian Challenge and the Challenge Endurance Italia, with Merzario, Giovanni Li Calzi, Robin Donovan and Fulvio Ballabio driving the M1. Although the car was qualified in twelfth, it did not have a successful race, as it was retired after 73 laps. =International Sports Racing Series= In 1997, Centenari entered the new International Sports Racing Series (ISRS), with the M1. The M1 featured an Alfa Romeo-sourced 3-litre V6 engine, and was classified as a SR2 car. The team made its debut in the season opener at Donington Park, with Merzario and Giovanni Li Calzi hired as drivers, and won their class at the first attempt; as the only other SR2 class entry, a Didier Bonnet Racing- entered Debora LMP297-BMW, retired from the event. Although they retired from the following round at Zolder, having entered under the \\"Symbol Team\\" banner, they took an overall win at Brno (competing in the CN class as no other SR1 or SR2 entries were present) for the only time in the team's history. The entry for the final race at Jarama was made under the Centenari name once more, and the team took the SR2 class victory, and finished second overall. For 1998, a new car, the Centenari Mac3, was developed, and the team expanded to a two-car effort, with the M1 being retained. In the ISRS season opener at Paul Ricard, the M1 finished fourth, being classified in the CN category; both the M1 and the Mac3 were the only cars in that category to finish the race. This was followed by a tenth overall finish (third in the CN class) for the M1 at Brno. For Misano, Centenari entered three cars; two M1s, and a Mac3; however, both M1s retired. At Donington Park, only one of the M1s was classified as finishing, in last place overall, as the other M1 did not start the race. Anderstorp once more saw only one M1 finish, in last place overall, as the other M1's differential failed after a single lap. At the N√ºrburgring, once again a single M1 finished, in thirteenth overall; however, this meant that the car was the last finisher in the CN class. At the penultimate round at Le Mans, one of the M1's engines expired before it completed a lap, and the other experienced an engine failure after 30 laps. A single M1 was the only Centenari entry in the season finale at Kyalami; however, it retired with clutch issues after 32 laps. Centenari were classified joint-second in the CN Team's Championship, and eleventh overall, at the end of the season. That proved to be the car's last race.
