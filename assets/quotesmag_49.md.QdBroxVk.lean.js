History  In August 2006, Stanford University in Silicon Valley, announced that a protein folding client would be available to run on the PS3. On December 19, 2007, Sony updated the Folding@home client to version 1.3. The update allowed users to run music stored on their hard drives while contributing to Folding@home and automatically shut down their console after existing simulation work was done. The software update also added the Generalized Born implicit solvent model, which broadened the PS3 client's computing capabilities. On September 18, 2008 the PS3 version of the Folding@home client became Life With PlayStation. The application became available for the PS3 in March 2007 and became a channel on Life with PlayStation when it was released. This update also provided more advanced simulation of protein folding and a new ranking system. Following the release of system software version 4.30, the Folding@home PS3 client and all other services under Life with PlayStation were discontinued on November 6, 2012.

It also serves as the administrative center of Danilovsky Selsoviet, one of the ten selsoviets into which the district is administratively divided. Municipally, it is incorporated as Konoshskoye Urban Settlement. Population: Name The name of the settlement is derived from the name of the Konosha River. The name of the river contains two element: -sha, which means \\"water\\" in the relevant Finnic languages, and -kon, which unclear etymology. If it is considered to be a Slavic word, it may mean either \\"beginning\\" or \\"border\\". History The settlement was founded in 1896 in connection with the construction of the Yaroslavl‚ÄìVologda‚ÄìArkhangelsk railway line. It was granted urban-type settlement status in 1931. Konosha became the district center on July 15, 1929, when Konoshsky District was established as part of Nyandoma Okrug of Northern Krai In 1931, Konoshsky District was abolished, but on March 21-22, 1935, it was restored. From 1937, Konosha belongs to Arkhangelsk Oblast. Economy =Industry= In 2009, the most important industry in Konoshsky District was timber industry (52.7% of GDP), followed by the energy development (40.8%) and by the food industry (6.4%). =Transportation= There are paved roads in the district, connecting Konosha with Velsk in the east and Nyandoma in the north. The road to Vozhega in the south has an unpaved stretch. Konosha is a major railway hub. It is located on the railway line between Moscow and Arkhangelsk (built in the south-north direction), and in Konosha, the line to Kotlas which eventually continues to Vorkuta branches off to the east. The line from Moscow to Arkhangelsk uses the alternating current, whereas the stretch to Vorkuta does not have electrification, therefore all trains from Moscow in the direction of Vorkuta have to change the locomotive and stop in Konosha for about twenty minutes. Culture and recreation Konosha hosts the Konoshsky District Museum, which opened in 2003. In 1964-1965, the future literature Nobel Prize winner Joseph Brodsky was exiled to the village of Norinskaya (which is now a part of Konoshskoye Urban Settlement) after being charged with social parasitism and convicted to eighteen months of hard labor. In 1965, the sentence was commuted. In the exile, Brodsky chopped wood and also studied Russian and American literature.

Sir Paul Henry Dukes (10 February 1889 - 27 August 1967) was a British MI6 officer and author. Early life and family Paul Henry Dukes was born the third of five children on 10 February 1889 in Bridgwater, Somerset, England. He was the son of the Congregationalist clergyman, Rev. Edwin Joshua Dukes (1847-1930), of Kingsland, London, and his wife, the former Edith Mary Pope (1863-1898), of Sandford, Devon. Edith was an academically gifted woman, the daughter of a schoolteacher, who obtained her Bachelor of Arts degree by correspondence course at the age of 20. In 1884, she married Edwin, who had returned from missionary work in China. She died from a disease of the thyroid gland, and in 1907, Edwin remarried to a 40-year-old widow named Harriet Rouse. Paul's siblings included the playwright Ashley Dukes (1885-1959) and the renowned physician Cuthbert Dukes (1890-1977). He had an elder sister, Irene Catherine Dukes (1887-1950), who led a life plagued by illness, and yet another, younger brother, Marcus Braden Dukes (1893-1936), who died in Kuala Lumpur while working as a government official. Paul was the great-uncle of poet Aidan Andrew Dun, the grandson of Paul's brother Ashley. Paul was educated at Caterham School before going on to pursue a career in music at the Petrograd Conservatoire in Russia. Career As a young man he took a position as a language teacher in Riga, Latvia. He later moved to St. Petersburg, having been recruited personally by Mansfield Smith-Cumming, the first \\"C\\" of MI6 (SIS), to act as a secret agent in Imperial Russia, relying on his fluency in the Russian language. At the time, he was employed at the Petrograd Conservatoire as a concert pianist and deputy conductor to Albert Coates. In his new capacity as sole British agent in Russia, he set up elaborate plans to help prominent White Russians escape from Soviet prisons and smuggled hundreds of them into Finland. Known as the \\"Man of a Hundred Faces,\\" Dukes continued his use of disguises, which aided him in assuming a number of identities and gained him access to numerous Bolshevik organizations. He successfully infiltrated the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Comintern, and the political police, or CHEKA. Dukes also learned of the inner workings of the Politburo, and passed the information to British intelligence. He returned to Britain a distinguished hero, and in 1920 was knighted by King George V, who called Dukes the \\"greatest of all soldiers.\\" To this day, Dukes is the only person knighted based entirely on his exploits in espionage. He briefly returned to service in 1939, helping to locate a prominent Czech businessman who disappeared after the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia. He was also a leading figure in introducing yoga to the Western World. =Writing= His book Red Dusk and the Morrow chronicles the rise and fall of Bolshevism and he toured the world extensively giving lectures pertaining to this subject. Dukes' other books are listed below. Personal life In 1922, Dukes was first married to Margaret Stuyvesant Rutherfurd (1891‚Äì1976), former wife of Ogden Livingston Mills, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. Margaret was the daughter of Anne Harriman, the second wife of William Kissam Vanderbilt, and her second husband, Lewis Morris Rutherfurd, Jr., son of the astronomer Lewis Morris Rutherfurd.. Margaret was the daughter of Anne Harriman, the second wife of William Kissam Vanderbilt, and her second husband, Lewis Morris Rutherfurd, son of the astronomer Lewis Morris Rutherfurd. After divorcing Dukes, Margaret Rutherfurd successively married Charles Michel Joachim Napol√©on, Prince Murat, and Frederick Leybourne Sprague They divorced in 1929, and Dukes later married Diana Fitzgerald in 1959. He died on 27 August 1967 in Cape Town, South Africa, aged 78.

The ignition component can range from 0 when conditions are cool and damp, to 100 on days when the weather is dry and windy. Theoretically, on a day when the ignition component registers a 60 approximately 60% of all fire brands that come into contact with wildland fuels will require suppression action. Ignition normally takes place in the dead component of the fine fuels. Three distinct steps must be considered in this ignition process. They are: *A firebrand must come into contact with the dead fuel. *The fuel particle must be dry. *The temperature of the fuel particle must be raised to the kindling point which is about 380 degrees Celsius. Living material in the fine fuel complex reduces the efficiency of ignition. Therefore, an adjustment to the ignition component is made based on the percentage of live fuel (herbaceous vegetation) in the fine fuel complex. The moisture content of the dead component of the fine fuel (1-hr. timelag fuel moisture) is determined by the state of the weather (sunny or cloudy), air temperature, and relative humidity at the time of the 2 p.m. fire weather observation. The condition of the herbaceous (live) vegetation and the 1-hr. timelag fuel moisture are then integrated in the calculation the fine fuel moisture (FFM) which expresses the effective moisture content of the fine fuels. The closer the initial temperature of the fuel is to the ignition temperature, the more likely a fire will result when a firebrand in introduced into the fine fuel complex, since not a much energy is required to raise the fuel particle to its ignition temperature.

The Great South American Chaco is a plain and its formation, millions of years ago, is very closely related to the formation of the Andes and the erosive process afterwards. Originally the Chaco was a basin, which within time, was filled with sediments of aerial origin (through wind action) and of pluvial origin (through rivers taking and depositing sediments in the Chaco).

The River Timan√© is located in the zone and it\`is considered a special river because it does not end up in any water course or lagoon. The Cerro Cabrera is in the border with Bolivia. The vegetation there is mainly a dense savanna and open forests. There are a lot of white quebracho, samu√π and palo santo trees. Animals include wild felines, armadillos, giant anteater, and tapir. =Chovoreca Natural Monument= Choroveca National Monument was created in 1998 with an area of 100.953 ha. Its vegetation is different from the rest of the Chaco and it can be said to be unique in the country. It has a reddish sand soil, which is characteristic of the Oriental Region, and very shallow. Its beauty is unique and difficult to value, for its bushes as well as for the high forest where you can find the endangered trebol (Amburana cearensis). Animals include yurum√≠ u oso hormiguero, el Kaguar√©, and other species of felines and armadillos. =Defensores del Chaco National Park= Defensores del Chaco National Park is the largest protected area in Paraguay. It has an area of 720.000 ha. It was created with the decree number 16.806 on August 6, 1975. The park covers a vast plain, and the vegetation includes white quebracho, palo santo, samu√π, low forests, thorn bushes, and various species of cactus. It is an excellent area for large mammals such as the cats jaguar, puma, tirika (Geoffroy's cat), and jaguarundi, various species of armadillos, Ka‚Äôi mirikina (monkey), ka‚Äôi pyhare (Azara's night monkey), tagua (Chacoan peccary), and mborev√≠ (South American tapir). The park includes Cerro Le√≥n, a unique geological formation in the Chaco. It covers around 40 km of diameter and it is made of a succession of hills. The way to get there is through a 177 km road from Mcal Estigarribia to Gral P Colman, and from there a road to Lagerenza (north) and to Cerro Leon and Madrejon =M√©danos del Chaco National Park= M√©danos del Chaco National Park has an area of 514,233 ha. It was originally included in the Paraguayan Wildlands Project (Global Environment Facility of the UN). Of special interest in this national park are the \\"m√©danos\\" or dunes with their unique vegetation and guanacos. Park rangers have their base of operations in the nearby Teniente Agripino Enciso National Park. =R√≠o Negro National Park= Created in 1998 with an original area of 30,000 ha, was enlarged in 2004 to 123,789 ha. It protects typical ecosystems of the Pantanal and Humid Chaco. There are a lot of areas that are regularly flooded and Karanda\`y palm trees. It was declared Ramsar Site in 1995 by the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, because it was considered a habitat of migratory birds as well as other wetland species, both animal and plant. Animals include jaguar, wild parrots, deer from the Pantanal, lobope and yacares. It does not have a plan yet, nor a tourism structure. The way to get there is through the Lagerenza-Bahia Negra road, or through Defensores del Chaco National Park. =Teniente Agripino Enciso National Park= Teniente Agripino Enciso National Park was created in 1980 with 40.000 ha. Its size and shape is practically rectangular, and it makes it easier to protect from the biological diversity. It has typical landscapes of the Dry Chaco. Due to the lack of water, its vegetation is characterized by dense and almost impenetrable thorn forest. Its typical trees are white quebracho, palo santo, and samu‚Äôu. There is a great quantity of wild mammals such as felines (yaguarte and others), the three peccaries (the tagua is the symbol of the area). The park also has trenches and ways from the Chaco War, which can be visited with the park guards who are specially trained to attend tourists. =Tinfunqu√© National Park= It was created in 1996 as national park of 280.00ha. Today it is recommended a change of category to reservation of handle resources, because all of its territory is in private hands and the category of national park only can be used in wild areas which are protected and are public. The Tinfunque was declared Site Ramsar and therefore is on the list of the Wet areas of international importance. It occupies a sector which remains flooded in times of high waters of the Pilcomayo River and it has large natural plantation of grass. There are many shrubs adapted to the floods, and animals such as the √±andy, wild ducks, storks, chaja, aguara guazu, giant anteater, carpincho, and yacares. Its conservation depends only on the wildlife and cattle, and they can be together in the same space. It is very common to see the √±andy and the carpinchos sharing the water with cattle. The way to get there is through the Transchaco road, 180 km, then Pozo Colorado, a detour to the west, to Fort√≠n General Diaz.

Born in Blackrock, County Cork, Coughlan first played competitive hurling in his youthSchool. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-seven when he first linked up with the Cork senior team. He made his senior debut during the 1925 championship. Coughlan later became a regular member of the starting fifteen, and won two All-Ireland medals, two Munster medals and two National Hurling League medals. At club level Coughlan was a seven-time championship medallist with Blackrock. His father, Pat, his uncles, Tom, Denis and Dan, and his brother, Eudie, all enjoyed All-Ireland success with Cork. Throughout his career Coughlan made 15 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1931 championship. Playing career =Club= In 1920 Coughlan was a key member of the Blackrock senior hurling team. He won his first championship medal that year following a huge 14-4 to 2-0 trouncing of Fairhill. Four years later \\"the Rockies\\" were back in the senior decider. Coughlan won his second championship medal that year following a 3-5 to 1-2 defeat of Redmonds. Blackrock retained the title in 1925, with Coughlan collecting a third championship medal following a 6-4 to 2-3 defeat of St. Finbarr's. Three-in-a-row proved beyond Blackrock, however, in 1927 they were back in a fourth successive decider. A 5-5 to 2-1 defeat of Redmonds gave Coughlan a fourth championship medal. After a one-year hiatus \\"the Rockies\\" were back in the county decider once again in 1929. A 5-6 to 2-2 defeat of St. Finbarr's gave Coughlan a fifth championship medal. It was the beginning of a great era of success for the club as further final victories over Glen Rovers in 1930 and √âire √ìg in 1931 brought Coughlan's championship medal tally to seven. =Inter-county= Coughlan made his senior championship debut for Cork on 19 May 1925 in a 4-9 to 1-3 Munster quarter-final defeat of Limerick. He was dropped from the starting for the semi-final, a game Cork narrowly lost to Tipperary. During the 1925-26 league, the inaugural running of the competition, Coughlan was a regular starter for Cork and collected a first National Hurling League medal following a 3-7 to 1-5 defeat of Dublin in the decider. He later won his first Munster medal following a three-game saga with Tipperary, culminating in a 3-6 to 2-4 victory for Cork. On 24 October 1926 Coughlan lined out in his first All-Ireland decider, as Cork faced Kilkenny for the first time since 1912. At a snow-covered Croke Park, the first half was even enough with Cork holding an interval lead of one point, however, Kilkenny slumped in the second half, going down to a 4-6 to 2-0 defeat. It was Coughlan's first All-Ireland medal. After being dropped from the Cork team for the next three seasons, Coughlan returned as sub goalkeeper in 1930. Cork exited the championship at the first hurdle that year, however, he finished the year by winning a second league medal following a 3-5 to 3-0 defeat of Dublin the decider. Coughlan was back as first-choice goalkeeper for the 1931 championship campaign. He won a second Munster medal that year following a 5-4 to 1-2 defeat of Waterford. 6 September 1931 saw Kilkenny face Cork in the All-Ireland final for the first time in five years. The first half was closely contested, with a goal from Mick \\"Gah\\" Ahern helping Cork to a half-time lead of 1-3 to 0-2. Cork stretched the advantage to six points in the second half, but Kilkenny came storming back with a goal and then four points on the trot to take the lead by one point. In the dying moments Cork captain Eudie Coughlan got possession and made his way towards the goal. As he did so he slipped and fell but struck the sliotar while he was down on his knees, and it went over the bar for the equalising point. A 1-6 apiece draw was the result. 11 October 1931 was the date of the replay and proved to be just as exciting a contest as the first game. Kilkenny's Lory Meagher was playing the best hurling of his career at this time and scored a magnificent point from 90 yards out the field. In spite of this great effort a winner couldn‚Äôt be found and both sides finished level again at 2-5 apiece. After this game officials pressed for extra time, however, Eudie Coughlan rejected this. It was also suggested at a meeting of Central Council that both teams be declared joint champions and that half an All-Ireland medal by given to each player. This motion was later defeated. As the All-Ireland saga went to a third meeting on 1 November 1931, Kilkenny's captain Meagher was ruled out of the game because of broken ribs sustained in the first replay. Such was the esteem in which he was held the game was virtually conceded to Cork since the star player couldn't play. In spite of fielding a younger team, Kilkenny were defeated by Cork on a score line of 5-8 to 3-4. It was Coughlan fourth and final All-Ireland medal. Death On 18 August 1965, Couglan died from a pulmonary embolism aged 67 at the Mercy Hospital in Cork.

History Harold Furry discovered the game on campgrounds in the early 1990s and believes it probably originated in such locations. Others speculate that the bola is a stand-in for a live snake, which cowboys in the western United States or caballeros in Mexico used to throw at fences or branches for points. A \\"ball and ladder game\\" was patented in 2002 by Pennsylvanian Robert G. Reid,Patent Assignment #6308956, United States Patent and Trademark Office. Retrieved on 2009-05-30. a postman who had played the game with his family for decades before deciding to file for patent in November, 1999. Reid sold his patent to Ladder Golf LLC, recorded in the patent office in March 2005, and the company began manufacturing the game commercially. The company sponsored a tournament in San Diego in April, 2005, featuring 32 teams. Rules The items needed to play are two ladders and a set of three bolas per team. =Scoring= People playing ladder toss Each ladder has three rungs, each rung scoring a different point value. One common method of scoring is to have the rungs be one, two and three points. In one variety the top is worth 1, middle is 2, and bottom is 3.\\"LSU Faithful Add Flavor To College World Series\\" , WOWT-TV, Omaha Points are tallied at the end of each round, after all teams have thrown their bolas. The bolas suspended on the ladder score the points for that rung, often with the goal of getting at least 21 points to win. Another variety of scoring would be 1pt for the bottom rung, 2pts for the middle, 3pts for the top, and a bola on each of the rungs scores an automatic 10pts. This makes the game move faster, but is just as hard. If the ball bounces off the ground and lands on a bar it does not count as a point. There are a few optional ways to earn or lose points: *A \\"tight dangle bonus\\" is when the balls can no longer be wrapped around the horizontal rods. This is worth an additional point to each tight dangle. *A \\"springboard bonus\\" occurs when the balls launch back in the direction they were thrown. A springboard bonus is worth one additional point. *Points are cancelled where the bolas of the opponent land on the same rung. For example, if Player A throws onto the middle rung he or she scores 2 points, but when the opponent lands on that same rung, the scores cancel, netting to 0. Points only cancel on the same rung. Player A could have two bolas wrapped on the top rung (1pt) and Player B one bola wrapped on the middle rung (2pts), assuming no other bolas stuck, the net score would be 2 - 2 for that round of play. This optional play makes the game more competitive and the game may last longer. Construction The balls on the bolas are often golf balls, but may be any uniform weight. They are sometimes plastic balls, tennis balls, rubber balls or a monkey's fist knot. Teams are distinguished by having their own color. For example, Team One may have three bolas with blue string, Team Two may have red string and Team Three may have purple string. Also, the teams may have different colors of balls. Ladder toss may be played with two people (one person per team) or up to six people (three teams of two people). The rungs may be plastic pipe, wood or other materials. Construction of the game is relatively easy and can be put together with the following: *16‚Äô - ¬æ‚Äù PVC pipe *2 - ¬æ‚Äù PVC Elbow joints *6 ‚Äì ¬æ‚Äù PVC ‚ÄúT‚Äù joints *12‚Äô ‚Äì 3/8‚Äù Nylon rope *12 ‚Äì balls (six each of two different colors.) *4 - ¬æ‚Äù PVC end caps (optional) Ladder toss with white PVC pipes at a University of Texas tailgate Irrigation (white) PVC pipe is commonly used but electrical (grey) PVC pipe may be preferable, at increased cost, as it contains UV inhibitors to prevent the PVC from getting brittle from sunlight exposure. Alternatively, painting (white) PVC pipe would also protect them from UV; be sure to use a paint intended for plastics and sanding with 220 grit will help with adhesion. The game is often played while tailgating at sporting events. There may be various rule sets used. Etymology Being a relatively new and grassroots game, it goes by many names. Some of these names are \\"L√§derb√∂len\\" (English: \\"Ladder Ball\\"), \\"Lasso Golf\\", \\"North Dakota Golf\\", \\"Norwegian Golf\\", \\"Dangle Ball\\", \\"Balls on Bars\\", \\"Hillbilly Golf\\", ‚ÄúTesticle Toss‚Äù, \\"Balls-a-Danglin\\" and many others.

Davis played in MLB for the Texas Rangers from 2008 until being traded to the Baltimore Orioles in 2011. He bats left-handed and throws right-handed. While primarily a first baseman throughout his career, Davis has also been a designated hitter, third baseman, and outfielder. Davis attended Navarro Junior College and was selected by the Rangers in the fifth round of the 2006 MLB draft. He ascended quickly through the Rangers' minor league system, getting named their Minor League Player of the Year in 2007. He was called up in the middle of 2008 and had a strong start to his major league career. He was the Rangers' starting first baseman for 92 games in 2009 and hit 21 home runs, but a low batting average and his tendency to strike out left the Rangers dissatisfied with him. Because of this, the Rangers sent Davis back and forth between the minors and the majors over the next two years and left him off their playoff roster in 2010. On July 30, 2011, they traded him to the Orioles. Davis appeared in 31 games for the Orioles in 2011. In the lineup full-time in 2012, he hit 33 home runs while batting .270 and helping the Orioles reach the playoffs for the first time since 1997. In 2013, his 53 home runs led all MLB players and set a new Orioles single-season franchise record. Davis also had 138 runs batted in (RBIs), was selected to the All-Star Game, and finished third in American League Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) voting. From 2015 through 2018, Davis led all major league players in strikeouts-per-at-bat. In 2018, he set the MLB record for the lowest batting average ever for a qualified player when he batted .168. In 2019, he set the MLB record for the most consecutive at bats by a position player without a hit, going 0-for-54. High school and college Davis was born in Longview, Texas. He has an older sister, Jennifer. While he was in high school, his parents divorced. Davis attended Longview High School, playing shortstop on the school's varsity baseball team and pitching as well before graduating in 2004. He was originally chosen by the New York Yankees as the third-to-last pick of the 2004 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft (1,496th overall in the 50th round).Newberg, Jamey. The Newberg Report: 2010 Bound Edition. Dallas, Texas: Brown Books Publishing Group, 2010. However, he did not sign and opted to attend Navarro Junior College in Texas instead, beginning in 2005. At Navarro, he was used as a third baseman and first baseman. He was once again drafted, by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, in the 2005 MLB draft, however he did not sign. He was named a pre- season JUCO All-American by Baseball America in 2006, earning Region XIV East Zone Most Valuable Player honors. That year with Navarro, he hit 17 home runs, one of which hit a retail building 100 feet away from the 380 sign on the outfield fence. Davis was then drafted again, this time by the Texas Rangers in the fifth round of the 2006 MLB draft. Professional career =Minor league career= Davis began his minor league career in 2006 with the Spokane Indians of the Single-A short season Northwest League, splitting time between the outfield and first base. In 69 games, he batted .277 with 70 hits, 18 doubles, 15 home runs, 42 runs batted in (RBI), and 65 strikeouts (eighth). Early in his minor league career, Davis struggled with his weight. At one point, he weighed 265 pounds, but he later learned to eat healthier and lost weight. In 2007, Davis began the season with the Bakersfield Blaze of the Single-A advanced California League. He tied a California League record by posting a 35-game hitting streak and was selected to the Single-A advanced All-Star Game. On July 30, he was promoted to the Frisco RoughRiders of the Double-A Texas League, where he spent the rest of the season. Despite his call-up, he tied for fourth in the California League with 24 home runs and ranked fourth in the league with a .573 slugging percentage, leading Bakersfield in home runs, RBI, and doubles. With Frisco, he had 11 home runs and 25 RBI in the month of August and was named the Rangers' Minor League Player of the Month. In 129 games combined, used exclusively as a third baseman, Davis batted .297 with 36 home runs and 118 RBI in 2007. After the season, he was named the Rangers' Tom Grieve Minor League Player of the Year. Entering 2008, Baseball America ranked Davis the number two prospect in the Rangers' organization, behind Elvis Andrus. Davis began the season playing first base for Frisco. He batted .333 with 62 hits, 13 home runs, and 42 RBI in 46 games before earning a promotion to the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks of the Pacific Coast League. In 31 games with Oklahoma, he hit .333 with 37 hits, 10 home runs, and 31 RBI. He was named to the All-Star Futures Game but was unable to play in it because he was promoted to the major leagues by the Texas Rangers. Later, during his breakout 2013 season, Davis referred to his time with Round Rock in 2008: \\"I know nobody really cares about Triple-A, but I put up these numbers up in Triple-A. That was kind of the question, 'Was he going to be able to do it at the big league level?' The thing about it was, I just couldn't do it consistently. I couldn't put the bat on the ball. I was striking out an astronomical amount, and this year it's just been consistency day in and day out.\\" =Texas Rangers= 2008 On June 26, 2008, the Rangers called up Davis from Oklahoma, and that day he made his major league debut in a 7-2 loss to the Houston Astros, getting a hit in his first Major League at bat, against √ìscar Villarreal. Davis started his first Major League game at first base on June 27, 2008, and hit his first Major League home run during the game, against Clay Condrey in an 8-7 win over the Philadelphia Phillies. He also homered the next day, becoming the first Texas Ranger to homer in both of his first two Major League starts. He took over from Frank Catalanotto at first base. By virtue of his hot start with the Rangers, and his considerable power as a batter, Davis was dubbed \\"Crush Davis\\" by local media and fans (a play on \\"Crash Davis\\" from the movie Bull Durham). From July 22 through July 26, he had four straight multi-hit games. Davis played well enough that, upon Hank Blalock's return from the disabled list (DL) on August 22, he was moved to third base so he could remain in the lineup. He had four hits on September 26 in a 12-1 victory over the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. In 80 games (295 at bats), Davis batted .285 with 84 hits, 23 doubles, 17 home runs, and 55 RBI. He struck out 88 times, which was 30% of his at bats. Defensively, he was much better at first base than third, with a .997 fielding percentage at first as opposed to a .962 percentage at third and a higher range factor as well. 2009 Texas Rangers in 2009 Davis slumped a bit in 2009 spring training but still began 2009 as the Rangers' first baseman. Rangers manager Ron Washington said, \\"I'm not worried about Chris. Chris works hard. He had a little spell where he was trying to get himself together. He's going to have bad times, but what he did tonight is what he's capable of and he'll do that enough to make him love you.\\" On May 14, with the Rangers trailing 2-1 in the ninth inning against the Seattle Mariners, he homered against Brandon Morrow to give the Rangers a 3-2 victory. After a 1-for-29 slump, Davis hit two home runs on May 26 in a 7-3 victory over the New York Yankees. He had four hits on June 25, the fourth a 12th-inning two-run home run against Esmerling V√°squez in a 9-8 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. On July 5, Davis was sent back down to make room for Josh Hamilton who was coming off the disabled list. Although he had 15 home runs in 258 at bats, he was leading the American League with 114 strikeouts and had, on June 21, become the quickest player in Major League history to reach 100 strikeouts, requiring only 219 at bats. His batting average was at .202. While talking about the Rangers' handling of another player, Julio Borbon, in 2010, Washington mentioned the decision to send Davis down in 2009: \\"We gave Chris a good amount of time last year. With young players, they can look bad for 100 at bats and then turn it around the next 100 and look exactly like you want them to.\\" With the RedHawks, Davis played 44 games, batting .327 with six home runs, 12 doubles, and 30 RBI. Davis was recalled on August 25 after Andruw Jones went on the DL and Blalock struggled. On September 8, in the second game of a doubleheader, he had three hits and four RBI, including a three-run home run against Jos√© Veras in a 10-5 victory over the Cleveland Indians. When Davis returned to the majors, his numbers improved dramatically, as he hit .318 in September and October, with five home runs and 21 RBIs in the two- month span. In 113 games (391 at bats), Davis batted .238 with 93 hits, 15 doubles, 21 home runs, and 59 RBI. However, he ranked seventh in the AL with 150 strikeouts. He did do well defensively; Washington said, when Blalock replaced him at first following his demotion, \\"We can't expect Hank Blalock to be Chris Davis [defensively], but Hank is a professional. I think he can play first base.\\" 2010 Oklahoma City RedHawks in 2010 Davis was once again optioned to Triple-A after starting 2010 batting .188 in 15 games (48 at bats). He was recalled on July 9 to play first base for the Rangers. A roster spot, as well as a position in the Rangers starting lineup, became available when Justin Smoak was involved in a trade with the Seattle Mariners for Cliff Lee. On July 29, he was sent back to the RedHawks to make room for Mitch Moreland. In 103 games (398 at bats) with the RedHawks, he had 130 hits, 31 doubles, 14 home runs, and 80 RBI. He finished second in the league in hitting (.327, behind John Lindsey's .353) and fifth in strikeouts (105). He was recalled for the final time on September 11 but this time was used as a backup corner infielder and pinch-hitter, as Moreland was playing first base. In 45 games (120 at bats) with Texas, Davis hit .192 with 23 hits, one home run, and four RBI. He was left off the postseason roster as the Rangers entered the World Series for the first time ever but ended up losing in five games to the San Francisco Giants. Attempting to aid Davis's offense, the Rangers tried to get Davis to widen his batting stance. However, playing in the Dominican Winter League over the offseason, Davis \\"felt like I fouled a lot of pitches off that I should have driven.\\" He stood more upright and kept his feet closer together and, in 2013, said that this was a defining moment in his career. 2011 In 2011, Davis began the season in the minors but was called up from Triple-A to play for the Rangers on April 11 when Hamilton suffered a fracture of the humerus bone in his shoulder. However, it was with reluctance that the Rangers recalled Davis; general manager Jon Daniels said, \\"We talked about another center fielder or a third catcher and think we will address that at some point. But whoever we called up wasn't going to get regular playing time, so we felt Chris was the most deserving.\\" Used in a part-time role, Davis remained with the club until Hamilton came off the DL on May 23. He was also called up for a game on June 8 when Ian Kinsler was placed on paternity leave. His 2011 totals with the Rangers were a .250 batting average with 19 hits, three home runs, and six RBI in 28 games (76 at bats). Davis fared better with the Rangers' Triple-A affiliate, which had become the Round Rock Express in 2011. He had five-RBI games twice and in June batted .361 with 10 home runs and 28 RBI. Despite playing only 48 games with Round Rock in 2011, Davis finished seventh in the Pacific Coast League with 24 home runs. =Baltimore Orioles= 2011 On July 30, 2011, Davis was traded with pitcher Tommy Hunter to the Baltimore Orioles for reliever Koji Uehara. Davis became expendable because the Rangers felt Moreland was a better option at first base; Rangers general manager Jon Daniels said the day of the trade that he knew there was a possibility Davis could turn into a high-impact offensive player and \\"If he does, we'll live with it.\\" Opinions differ as to Davis's inability to hold a consistent starting role with the Rangers; while one popular theory is that it was because of his many strikeouts and low batting average, Orioles manager Buck Showalter believes it was due to the presence of Moreland and Adri√°n Beltr√© in Texas. Davis said, \\"I'm glad to get the opportunity to come here\\", citing his desire to play every day. In his second game as an Oriole, on August 2, Davis homered for his first Oriole hit against Everett Teaford in an 8-2 victory over the Kansas City Royals. He received everyday playing time but went on the DL on August 14 with a right shoulder strain, an injury which was initially feared to be season-ending but wound up keeping him out only until September 6. In an 11-inning 5-4 victory over the Yankees on September 7, he struck out five times, the first Oriole to strike out that many times since Phil Bradley did so exactly 22 years before. He had three-hit games on September 8 and 19. On September 14, he had a season-high three RBI with a three-run home run against Wade Davis in a 6-2 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays. Davis played 31 games for the Orioles, batting .276/.310/.398 with 34 hits, two home runs, 13 RBIs, and 39 strikeouts in 123 at bats. In a combined 59 games with Texas and Baltimore, he batted .266 with 53 hits, 12 doubles, five home runs, 19 RBI, and 63 strikeouts. 2012 Davis swings during a 2012 game vs. the Washington Nationals Davis received everyday playing time in 2012, starting at first base, at designated hitter, and in the outfield throughout the season. On May 6, in a 17-inning, 9-6 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, Davis went hitless in eight at bats, but ended up being the winning pitcher. His feat was the first of its kind since Rube Waddell achieved it on July 4, 1905. Davis was the designated hitter until he was pressed into service as a relief pitcher in the 16th inning after Showalter had depleted the Orioles' bullpen. He struck out two batters and did not allow a run in his two innings of mound work. He was the first position player in the American League (AL) to be the winning pitcher in a game since Rocky Colavito on August 25, 1968, and the first to pitch for the Orioles since Manny Alexander on April 19, 1996. He and losing pitcher Darnell McDonald were the first position players on opposing teams in the same contest to each work in relief since Ty Cobb and George Sisler on October 4, 1925, and the first where both earned pitching decisions since Sam Mertes and Jesse Burkett on September 28, 1902. Davis described his outing: > \\"After the first inning, I was just trying to get it over the plate, and I > was like, 'This is a lot harder than it looks.' I told myself to start using > my legs so I didn't blow my arm out or anything like that. But in all > seriousness, to get a win like that here, to end a road trip like this, it's > huge. Neither team wanted to lose today, especially when it goes to extra > innings. I mean, they would have pulled people out of the stands to finish > that game. It's just a huge win for us.\\" On July 31, Davis hit his first career grand slam, off Yankees pitcher Iv√°n Nova in an 11-5 win after the Orioles had faced a five-run deficit. On August 24, Davis had his first career three-homer game in a 6-4 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. His second home run was his 22nd of the season, setting a new career high, and it marked the first three-homer game by an Oriole since Nick Markakis had one in 2006. After Markakis suffered a season-ending injury on September 8, Davis moved to right field for the remainder of the season and the playoffs. Due to a late-season stretch in which he homered six times in the final six games, he finished the regular season with 33 home runs, more than any other Oriole. In 139 games (515 at bats), he batted .270/.326/.501 with 139 hits, 20 doubles, and 85 RBI. His 33 home runs also tied Robinson Can√≥ for eighth in the AL while his 169 strikeouts tied B. J. Upton for fourth. The Orioles reached the playoffs for the first time since 1997, claiming one of the AL Wild Card spots and defeating the Rangers in the 2012 AL Wild Card Game. In Game 2 of the 2012 AL Division Series (ALDS) against the Yankees, Davis had a two-run single against Andy Pettitte in the Orioles' 3-2 victory. Those were his only RBI of the series; he had four hits in 20 at bats as the Yankees defeated the Orioles in five games. 2013 The Orioles decided to put Davis at first base full-time in 2013 and worked on his defense in spring training; later, Oriole coaches and teammates believed this helped Davis succeed at the plate as well. He set a personal home run goal before the season but refused to share it. On April 5, Davis set a new Major League record with 16 RBI in the first four games of a season. He also became the fourth MLB player in history to hit a home run in the first four games of the season (Nelson Cruz, Mark McGwire, Willie Mays), including a grand slam against Tyler Robertson in the fourth game, a 9-5 victory over the Minnesota Twins. On June 16, he hit the 100th home run of his career, off Red Sox pitcher Jon Lester in a 6-3 victory. On July 11, he hit his 34th home run of the season, eclipsing his previous season high in a 3-1 victory over the Rangers. He earned his 87th and 88th RBIs of the season with a two-run home run against Mark Buehrle on July 12, setting a new Orioles record for most RBIs before the All-Star break; the previous record was 86 by Boog Powell. He ultimately ended up with 93 RBIs before the All-Star break. On July 14, he hit his 37th home run of the season against Josh Johnson in a 7-4 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays, tying Reggie Jackson for the second most home runs before the All-Star break by any MLB player and the most by an American League player. The home run was also his 500th career hit. Davis received a tweet on June 30 from Michael Tran in Michigan asking him if he had ever used steroids. He responded \\"No\\", that same day. Davis said later in an interview, \\"I have not ever taken any PEDs. I'm not sure fans realize, we have the strictest drug testing in all of sports, even more than the Olympics. If anybody was going to try to cheat in our game, they couldn't. It's impossible to try to beat the system. Anyway, I've never taken PEDs, no. I wouldn't. Half the stuff on the list I can't even pronounce.\\" Later, Davis would say that he believed Roger Maris's 61 home run season was the true single-season home run record, due to the steroid scandal surrounding Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, and Mark McGwire. On July 6, Davis was elected to start the 2013 All-Star Game, his first ever appearance. He was the leading vote-getter with 8,272,243 votes. Davis was also chosen to participate in the Home Run Derby for the first time, by American League captain Robinson Can√≥. Davis advanced to the second round and hit a total of 12 home runs. However, a blister broke on his hand, leaving him unable to hit enough homers to advance to the third and final round. At the All-Star Game the next night, July 16, 2013, Davis went 1-3, with a fly out, a single and a strikeout. Davis's single against Patrick Corbin advanced Miguel Cabrera to third, where he would score the game's first run on Jos√© Bautista's sacrifice fly. Davis's 50th home run of the season, which he hit on September 13, tied him with Brady Anderson for the Orioles record of most home runs in a single season. He also became only the third player in MLB history, after Babe Ruth (New York Yankees, 1921) and Albert Belle (Cleveland Indians, 1995), to hit 50 home runs and 40 doubles in a single season. He hit his 51st home run on September 17, setting a new Orioles single season record. This was also his 92nd extra-base hit of the season, again tying Anderson for a franchise record. He later surpassed that by hitting his first triple of the season against Alex Cobb on September 21 in a 5-1 loss to Tampa Bay. Davis broke another Orioles record on September 27 with his 28th home run of the season hit at his home park of Camden Yards, surpassing Frank Robinson's record of 27 home runs hit at Memorial Stadium in 1966. In 2013, Davis led all MLB batters in home runs (53), runs batted in (138), extra-base hits (96), and total bases (370). His 53 home runs, 96 extra-base hits, and 199 strikeouts all set new Orioles single-season records. In addition to these statistics, which were all career highs, he also set new career highs in games played (160), hits (167), doubles (42), runs scored (103), walks (72), stolen bases (4), batting average (.286), on-base percentage (.370), slugging percentage (.634), and OPS (1.004). In AL Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) voting, Davis finished third behind Cabrera and Mike Trout, as the Orioles failed to return to the playoffs. Davis's breakout year led to compliments from his peers. Teammate Adam Jones summarized his style: \\"Most of his home runs are just line drives that get out. Obviously he hits some moonshots too.\\" Cliff Lee, Davis's teammate in Texas in 2010, said, \\"Watching his highlights, you can totally tell that he's relaxed and just letting it happen. He's not putting anything extra into it. It's just nice and easy, and it's impressive to watch. ... He and Miguel Cabrera are the two best power hitters in the game, in my opinion.\\" 2014 Davis missed 12 games from April 26, 2014, to May 11, 2014, with a left oblique strain. He hit three home runs and had five RBI on May 20 in a 9-2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. On June 17, facing √ârik B√©dard with the bases loaded, Davis hit a ball to left field that hit off the left field foul pole at Tropicana Field. Initially ruled a double, the umpires changed it to a grand slam after a review. The Orioles went on to defeat the Rays 7-5. After a 4-for-36 slump, Davis was benched on June 23, but he had a pinch-hit walk off three-run home run against Ronald Belisario, giving the Orioles a 6-4 victory over the Chicago White Sox. It was the Orioles' first game-ending pinch hit home run since Larry Sheets had one on August 24, 1988. Davis struggled in the first half of 2014, hitting 15 home runs but batting around .200. The slump continued, as he batted .202 in July and saw himself dropped to seventh in the batting order in August. Showalter said, \\"It's hard to follow that pace. He spoiled us at a very high level. He wants to get back to it.\\" Despite his slump, the Orioles through August 23 had built a seven-game lead in the AL East. On September 12, Davis was suspended for 25 games for testing positive for amphetamine. Davis claimed he tested positive due to the use of Adderall, for which he previously had a \\"therapeutic use exemption\\", although he did not have that exemption for the 2014 season. Davis' suspension covered the final 17 games of the 2014 regular season and the seven games the Orioles played in the 2014 postseason. For the 2014 season, he batted .196 (the lowest batting average among all qualified MLB batters)/.300/.404 with 26 home runs and 173 strikeouts (3rd in the AL) in 450 at bats. 2015 Davis received a therapeutic use exemption for Vyvanse, a stimulant drug, prior to the 2015 season. He served the final game of his suspension on Opening Day. On July 28 against the Atlanta Braves, Davis hit two home runs and drove in 5 runs. It was his tenth career multi-home run game and third of the 2015 season. On July 30, in a game against the Detroit Tigers, Davis hit his 25th home run of the year, which happened to be his 83rd career home run at Oriole Park, which gave him sole possession of 6th place on the stadium's all-time home run list. On August 5, Davis hit his sixth career grand slam and second of the season in the tenth inning in a game against the Oakland Athletics, which helped lift Baltimore to a 7-3 victory. Ten days later, Davis hit a walk-off solo home run against the A's in Baltimore. It was his second home run of the night and number 34 on the year. On September 3, Davis hit a walk off solo home run to help the O's end a six-game losing skid. It was his 38th of the year. It was also his 152nd with the Orioles, giving him sole possession of 11th place on the franchise's all-time list. The home run also happened to be his 90th career home run at OPACY, giving him sole possession of fourth on the stadium's all-time list. On September 4, Davis became the first Orioles player to have back-to-back multi-home run games since 2009. In addition, he became the first Orioles player ever with multiple 40-home-run seasons (hit 53 in 2013). That game, against Toronto, became his sixth multi- homer game of the year and the 13th of his career. Davis led the majors in home runs with 47. This made Davis the only Orioles hitter to ever have two seasons with 40+ homers (53 in 2013 and 47 in 2015). He struck out a major- league-leading 31.0% of the time, batted .262/.361/.562. He led the league in strikeouts (with 208) and at bats per home run (12.2), was 2nd in the AL in RBIs (117), was 4th in the AL in slugging percentage (.562), walks (84), and total bases (322), and 7th in the AL in runs (100). 2016 On January 21, 2016, Davis signed a 7-year, $161 million contract to stay with the Orioles, the richest contract in Orioles history. Coincidentally, 161 was the number of home runs Davis hit with the Orioles before signing the contract. Davis hit his first home run of the season in the Orioles' second game on April 6 against the Minnesota Twins. Davis would go 20-for-85 (.235), hitting seven home runs, while driving in 17 in the month of April. On May 11, Davis hit back-to-back home runs with teammate Mark Trumbo. It was the third consecutive game the Orioles had accomplished the feat, setting an Orioles franchise record. Davis also collected four hits in the game, raising his season average to .242. Davis would end up hitting just .210 in the month of May, but had a .313 on-base percentage for the month. He hit three home runs and drove in 11. On June 3, in a game against the Yankees, Davis homered to the flagcourt in OPACY, giving him his 214th career home run, 172 as an Oriole, and milestone number 100 at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. He moved into third place on the all-time Orioles list for most career home runs hit at OPACY. During the week of June 12, Davis hit a home run in five consecutive games while batting .368, earning him AL Player of the Week honors. On July 10, Davis passed Ken Singleton for 8th place on the Orioles all-time home run list with 183. Davis hit his 30th home run of the season on August 23 in an 8-1 victory over the Washington Nationals. It was his fourth 30-home run season since joining the Orioles (2012, 2013, and 2015). On September 6, Davis homered in an 11-2 win against the Rays, giving him 334 career extra-base hits as an Oriole, tying him for 14th on the all-time list with B. J. Surhoff. He also joined Boog Powell and Rafael Palmeiro as the only three Orioles to hit 35 or more homers in a season three or more times. In 159 games of 2016, Davis finished the year with a .221/.332/.459 batting line. He hit 38 home runs (8th in the American League), 84 RBIs, 88 walks (4th in the AL), and struck out an MLB-leading 219 times and a major-league-leading 32.9% of the time. Davis at first base in 2017 2017 During the second game of the season, Davis hit his 200th career home run in an Orioles uniform, making him the eighth Oriole in franchise history to do so. On May 16, in a game against the Tigers, Davis went 3 for 5 with three runs scored, four RBIs, two walks, a double and two home runs, including the game-winning home run in the 13th inning of the 13-11 victory. Davis became just the 2nd player in MLB history to hit two home runs in the 12th inning or later of a game, joining Matt Adams of the Cardinals. Davis also became the first Orioles player with multiple extra- inning home runs during a single game since Mike Young on May 28, 1987.

United States, 554 U.S. 237 (2008), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a federal appeals court may not sua sponte increase a defendant's sentence unless the government first files a notice of appeal..  Background  Greenlaw had been charged in federal district court in Minnesota with eight counts related to his participation in gang-related sales of crack cocaine in a neighborhood on the south side of Minneapolis. Two of these crimes were for violating 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 924(c),. which provides for a mandatory consecutive sentence for those who use firearms during or in relation to a drug crime. The mandatory consecutive sentence amounts to 25 years if the defendant suffers a second or subsequent conviction under ¬ß 924(c). The district court made an error at sentencing when it overlooked the holding in Deal v. United States,. that the 25-year mandatory consecutive sentence is triggered even if the defendant's two ¬ß 924(c) convictions come from the same criminal case. The district court computed Greenlaw's sentence at 262 months, then added 120 months for the two separate \\"first-time\\" ¬ß 924(c) convictions. Greenlaw appealed his sentence, but the Government did not. Greenlaw argued that his sentence was unreasonably long; the Government pointed out the district court's computation error only to indicate that his sentence was unreasonably short. The Eighth Circuit rejected all of Greenlaw's arguments in favor of a reduced sentence. Relying on the \\"plain error\\" rule of Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(c),See also . the Eighth Circuit ordered the district court to impose the 25-year mandatory consecutive sentence for a second ¬ß 924(c) conviction. Greenlaw asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case.  Opinion of the Court  \\"In our adversary system, in both civil and criminal cases, in the first instance and on appeal, we follow the principle of party presentation. That is, we rely on the parties to frame the issues for decision and assign to the courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters the parties present.\\" As relevant to this case, the rules of appellate procedure required the government to notify the district court and Greenlaw that it was seeking an increase in Greenlaw's sentence by filing its own notice of appeal. Without such a notice of appeal, the rule has historically been that an appellate court may not alter the judgment of the lower court to benefit a nonappealing party. Furthermore, in criminal cases, the Government may not appeal without first consulting and obtaining the personal approval of the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, or a deputy solicitor general. These two rules \\"should garner the Judiciary's full respect.\\" The Eighth Circuit, nevertheless, predicated increasing Greenlaw's sentence by 15 years on its reading of the plain-error rule of Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b). \\"A plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered [on appeal] even though it was not brought to the [lower] court's attention.\\" When Congress enacted the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, however, there was no intent to supplant the cross-appeal requirement. Ordinarily, the plain- error rule inures to the benefit of defendants; appellate courts will correct so-called \\"plain\\" errors only when ignoring them would work to the detriment of the defendant (who usually has a different lawyer on appeal). In the absence of a cross-appeal, the plain-error rule does not allow appellate judges to interfere with the assessment of high-level executive-branch officials who may have decided that appealing a sentence in a particular criminal case was not a wise expenditure of resources. Furthermore, nothing in the text of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 3742. overrides the cross-appeal rule. Indeed, ¬ß 3742 was enacted in 1984 with full knowledge of the cross-appeal rule, which had been a firmly entrenched rule of appellate procedure. Reading ¬ß 3742 to allow appellate courts to sua sponte increase criminal sentences without an appeal from the government would \\"give with one hand what it takes away with the other.\\" Executive-branch officials would be vested with the discretion to seek an increased sentence, but their decision not to do so could be overridden by judicial officers; Congress, in enacting ¬ß 3742, would not have intended such an inconsistent result. Finally, the Court has long held that the deadlines for filing a notice of appeal are firm, and that the purpose of having such firm deadlines is to preserve an opposing party's interest in notice and finality. If an appellate court could increase a sentence sua sponte without the Government's filing a notice of appeal, nothing would prevent the Government from routinely asking appellate courts to exercise that power for the first time in its responsive brief in the court of appeals. This, in turn, would deprive criminal defendants of the opportunity to argue against increasing their sentences, because other rules of appellate practice forbid parties who file appeals from raising new arguments for the first time in responding to arguments made by the prevailing party in the lower court. Indeed, Greenlaw might have chosen not to appeal at all if he knew that to do so risked a sua sponte increase in his sentence, even if that increase was the result of an effort to correct a legal error made by the district court. Justice Stephen Breyer emphasized that he concurred in the judgment solely because he believed the cross-appeal rule to be a \\"rule of practice\\" for the courts of appeals rather than a jurisdictional limitation. = Dissenting opinion = Justice Samuel Alito started with the premise that the cross- appeal rule was merely a \\"rule of appellate practice\\" that \\"rest[s] on premises about the efficient use of judicial resources and the proper role of the tribunal in an adversary system.\\" Because those rules are judge-made rules, they can be altered by judges sua sponte.

Over the course of its 83 years the reformatory maintained a commitment to the concept of rehabilitating felons and misdemeanants for positive and productive re-entry into society. Adaptations were made and experiments conducted as inmate populations and changing conditions required. The facility was closed in 2013 as the State of Illinois sought to balance its budget. At that time it was the only maximum security prison for adult females in the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC), inclusive of women on death row until the death penalty was abolished in Illinois in 2011.https://www.npr.org/2011/03/09/134394946/illinois- abolishes-death-penalty The name \\"Oakdale Reformatory for Women\\" fell out of common usage in the early 1970s when the IDOC's co-ed experiment began.

In this plan, women would be transferred to the Geneva Youth Center, which would be converted to serve adult females.Arlington Heights Herald (Arlington Heights, Illinois) ¬∑ Thu, Mar 3, 1977 ¬∑ Page 13 Rowe stated that converting DCC to an all-male prison would also reduce incidents of inmate romances, which, though prohibited, had resulted in two pregnancies.The Pantagraph (Bloomington, Illinois) ¬∑ Wed, Sep 7, 1977 ¬∑ Page 3 The population of women needing incarceration was swelling, however, which made the rearrangement of prison populations impractical.

At the heart of the program was improving the self-esteem and problem-solving skills of inmates and training in restraint from use of drugs.

The plan would also reduce the population at older institutions by 3,854 beds, 26 of which would come from DCC. At that time the DCC was the most crowded penal institution in the state, averaging 560 inmates each day, higher than the ideal capacity of 470 and design for 345. The prison was already contracting with county jails to house inmates and was considering the possibility of establishing work-release schools in the community. The plan for work-release facilities was stymied, however, by communities that wanted the prison, but not the prisoner.Pantagraph (Bloomington, Illinois) ¬∑ Sat, Apr 12, 1986 ¬∑ FIRST EDITION ¬∑ Page 4 The following year the IDOC announced a plan to transfer 75 women to the Logan Correctional Center in Lincoln, IL, where they would share public space with male inmates already there. By February 1987 the first women had moved, and after a period of incremental integration, men and women shared mealtimes, as well as recreation, education, and library privileges. The women resided in a separate unit, which was at a minimal cost adapted to women's needs. To be eligible for the co-ed prison, the inmate had to be classified as medium security, have less than seven years left in her sentence, and have demonstrated the ability to adjust to new situations. Forty women volunteered to move, but it was expected that other inmates would eventually be moved involuntarily. The IDOC stated that it would likely be a temporary solution to the overcrowding problem that would continue plague Illinois prisons.The Pantagraph (Bloomington, Illinois) ¬∑ Tue, Feb 3, 1987 ¬∑ Page 6 = Staff hardships = By 1988 DCC had an inmate population of 668 and a staff of 184.The Pantagraph (Bloomington, Illinois) ¬∑ Sun, Aug 21, 1988 ¬∑ Page 2 Morale among employees was low because they were required to work 16 hours a day in mandatory overtime.

The rebellion of the four ignited the fury of others in segregation, resulting in extensive damage to the cells. A tactical unit had to be summoned.

Physical violence between inmates and on guards was more and more commonplace, prompting prison guards to attend a rally at the Capitol in Springfield in May 1994 to request funding to hire additional guards to address the growing violence.

The John Howard Association and Lutheran Social Services reported that 4% of all inmates in Illinois had either the disease or its precursor HIV and that \\"in-jail transmission of AIDS was tantamount to handing 'unadjudicated death sentences to some prisoners.'\\" They recommended the distribution of condoms or reducing the two-to-a-cell arrangement to single cell.

The truth-in-sentencing law toughened sentencing, requiring those convicted of murder to serve 100% of their sentences and those convicted of sexual assault and other violent crimes to serve 85% of their sentences.

Illinois, they noted, was the only state to double-cell inmates in maximum security. They cited increases in assaults on staff, inmate health problems (including a new form of tuberculosis and AIDS), and higher recidivism rates because inmates were not equipped through education and vocational programming to reenter society.The Pantagraph (Bloomington, Illinois) ¬∑ Sun, Jun 1, 1997 ¬∑ Pages 5 and 6 = Inmate advocacy = In 1994 legislators introduced a bill to allow children age 5 and under to live with their sole-custody inmate-mothers in special prison units, the purpose of which was to save a child in its formative of years from being shuffled between foster homes and consequently to reduce the children's potential for committing future crimes. State Representative Dan Rutherford led the offense against the bill, saying that the state should not play \\"'nannies and nursemaids' to the offspring of women convicted of serious, sometimes violent crimes\\". Children's physical and psychological health could be at risk, he said, and money could be better spent in improving the foster care system.The Pantagraph (Bloomington, Illinois) ¬∑ Sat, Mar 26, 1994 ¬∑ [Second Edition] ¬∑ Page 8 Nonetheless, Legal Aid to Incarcerated Mothers continued to urge state corrections officials to provide a place were non-violent inmates could live with younger children.Chicago Tribune (Chicago, Illinois) ¬∑ Sun, Jan 28, 1996 ¬∑ Main Edition ¬∑ Page 53 In 1996 the IDOC was court-ordered to improve educational and vocational opportunities for women.

As many as a dozen staff members, including lieutenants or captains, were allegedly involved. The alleged sex acts were described as \\"consensual\\" and were possible because inmates residing in the \\"honors dorms\\" where the encounters had occurred had less supervision and were given more independence by obeying rules.The Dispatch (Moline, Illinois) ¬∑ Sun, Mar 24, 1996 ¬∑ Page 37 By May three additional guards were on administrative leave, yet another had resigned, and three were disciplined for failure to report the activity.

The lack of sound-proofing and the tendency of women to be more vocal than men in relationships made sleep difficult and contributed to stress. Inadequate facilities for counseling in the cell house meant that many of the women's emotional and psychological needs went unmet. Their histories of sex abuse made privacy issues more urgent. Women tended to have more health issues than men because of sexually transmitted diseases, poor nutrition, and drug abuse.

Rutherford blamed the prison for not asking for more employees or filling vacant positions. The union stated that high absenteeism accounted for some of the overtime, as did the discipline for refusing a shift, which was to take a day without pay.The Pantagraph (Bloomington, Illinois) ¬∑ Wed, Aug 16, 2000 ¬∑ Page 3 Some guards, anticipating overtime, would schedule themselves for an additional 2‚Äì3 overtime shifts per week to have predictable time off, but even this strategy failed from time to time.The Pantagraph (Bloomington, Illinois) ¬∑ Sat, Aug 26, 2000 ¬∑ Page 1 A temporary solution was to transfer guards from Pontiac, effectively shifting the overtime issues to that prison, but retirements and resignations at DCC would soon make the arrangement a break-even. In 2000 there were just 8 nurses on staff and two more were expected to leave at the end of the year. These nurses were expected to treat over 1,000 inmates at DCC.

They refer to themselves as S·∏µwxÃ±w√∫7mesh (). They are a part of the Coast Salish cultural group. Their culture and social life is based on the abundant natural resource of the Pacific Northwest coast, rich in cedar trees, salmon, and other resources. They have complex kinship ties that connect their social life and cultural events to different families and neighboring nations.  Historical and cultural context  An important distinction is to be made about S·∏µwxw√∫7mesh culture. With the history of colonization and assimilation strategies. S·∏µwxw√∫7mesh culture has been drastically changed from their pre- European contact. Despite these attempts, their culture remains intact and thriving. Some cultural practices and customs are not done in the same fashion, but still occur. These could be things like the construction of cedar bark clothing; modern clothes are worn just like the rest of Canadian society, but the art of cedar bark weaving is still passed on and cedar bark clothing is still made. It is important to understand that though the practices of the S·∏µwxw√∫7mesh have changed, many still continue, some the same as before, and some only slightly changed.  Architecture and dwellings  S·∏µwxÃ±w√∫7mesh longhouses once located in 1886 at Coal Harbour.There architecture in traditional homes is similar to Coast Salish style dwellings called a \\"longhouse.\\" The housing structures are made from cedar planks, posts, and ties. Historically extended families would live in a longhouse, with different branches of the kinship living in different quarters of the house. Larger houses would have been built to accommodate and host large amounts of guests in ceremonies, festivals, or potlatching. Typical sizes would be around 30 feet wide, 40 feet long and from 19‚Äì13 feet high. The house posts on one side would stand slightly taller than the other, giving the roof a small pitch or shed look. Within the house, these house posts would be carved into figures of ancestors depicting legendary events or other family history such as family rights in fishing, hunting, or gathering. Beams crossed the house posts, where wood planks would sit to create the roof. Within the house, wooden platforms formed along the walls holding families living and sleeping quarters. With this architectural style, houses could be built onto each other end to end extending the length of the longhouse. This gave rise to the term ‚Äò‚Äôlonghouse‚Äô‚Äô.Stewart, Hilary. ‚Äò‚ÄôCedar‚Äô‚Äô, Douglas & McIntyre Ltd & University of Washington Press, 1984. p65 . Different types of homes once existed in a typical village, depending on size. Some villages houses a few or handful of houses, where others operated with dozens of houses, all homes to many different families. The larger longhouses were used for large potlatches or gatherings, and other longhouses were used exclusively for spiritual ceremonialism. These are Potlatch Houses or tl'e7en _k_ √°·∫Étxw.Kolstee, Anton. The Eagle School student dictionary of Squamish language. Carson Graham Secondary School, October 1993. p98. In the old village of XÃ±w√°√ΩxÃ±way, a large longhouse was measured at 200 feet long by 60 feet wide where 11 families lived in the house, numbering around 100 people.Barman, Jean (2007) [2005]. Stanley Park's Secret: The Forgotten Families of Whoi Whoi, Kanaka Ranch and Brockton Point. Madeira Park, BC: Harbour Publishing. p. 46. . In 1875, over a thousand people were invited by Supple Jack to be a part of a large potlatch.Barman, Jean (2007) [2005]. Stanley Park's Secret: The Forgotten Families of Whoi Whoi, Kanaka Ranch and Brockton Point. Madeira Park, BC: Harbour Publishing. p. 43. . Another large longhouse was at Chi'ch'elxwikw', measuring 50 feet by 20 feet. These dwelling, holding spiritual and cultural significance are still used for traditional gatherings and ceremonies. The architectural style has also been incorporated into modern buildings in the communities.  Ceremonies and events  In S·∏µwxÃ±w√∫7mesh culture, ceremonies, events and festivals were the highly of community life. Ranging from community gathers in feasts, to spiritual endeavours in ceremony, these events were a big part of the culture. The most studied and practiced event was the potlatch. A S·∏µw _x_ w√∫7mesh potlatch differed quite differently from the Northern tribes and their festivities. In a S·∏µw _x_ w√∫7mesh potlatch, a large feast is held and the community, nation, or neighboring nations are invited to partake. Highly wealthy families and individuals host these potlatch for different events taking place, and to distribute the resources and wealth accumulated. A potlatch would usually occur around events such as birth, coming of age, naming ceremony, marriage, or memorial event for the deceased. It is in the winter months that most potlatching take places, where historically summer was used for traveling and harvesting. = Potlatch = At a potlatch, in Squamish language a tl'e7en _k_ , the host would invite guests to feast in foods prepared and harvested. Blankets would be bought or made, then distributed to guests. At the events, the host would hire a speaker to speak for the family in the proceedings. For special potlatches, a special platform would be constructed, around 10 or 15 feet high, 5 feet wide, where the host and his speaker would pile a number of blankets, either bought or made by the host's own family, and distribute the blankets to the guests. The speaker would call out names of guests, usually highly respected or high ranking, taking a blanket and throwing it out for that guest. Typically a crowd would amass below, ready for the falling blankets, waiting for it to fall. While the blanket came down, the other guests would have knives and spears ready to tear apart the blanket. Thus, the blanket would be torn and split up into multiple pieces. After attending a few potlatches, the guests would procure enough wool to construct their own blanket. \\"Hundred Dollar Charlie,\\" maternal grandfather to Andy Paull, reportedly gave the last potlatch on Burrard Inlet before the practice was banned by the Canadian government in 1885. In other ceremonies, a young woman, sometimes the daughter of a highly respected man, would be placed on top of a mound of blankets. This mound would match her height. Sitting on top of the blankets, a ceremony would take place around here, while she sat on top of and her family nearby. During some ceremonies, people situated around the house would take wooden batons and beat on plank drums situated through the house. When a young girl would stand up, she would dance around the house with a shawl on, and everyone else would beat and sing. When she was done, one man would take down, from duck, swan, or eagle, and sprinkle it over her. For large festivities, a bigger house then the normal dwelling would be built. These are potlatch houses or tl'e7en _k_ √°·∫Étxw. One longhouse was measured at 200 feet long by 60 feet wide. These houses could hold over a thousand guests, invited from far along the coast. The house would be decorated with down, sprinkled throughout the floor of the house. The longhouse in Xwemelch'stn is one of these types of houses. One potlatch was recorded at _X_ w√°√Ω _x_ way in 1875. In the longhouse, a large cedar slab dwelling, a large ceremony with guests of people from nearby nations, Vancouver Island, and the Interior British Columbia. This potlatch was hosted by August Jack's father, named Supple Jack. = Puberty and rites of passage = The stage of life that brought much change was filled with much attention and celebration. Young men and women may follow some of the same customs, but differ on certain specifics. The difference in their training had to do with what positions they would be taking in the community, the fact that different families had different protocols, or other factors.Hill-Tout, Charles. The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet. Talon Books, December 1978. p37. At the sign of reaching this point in a young girl's life, she would inform her mother, and she would inform the father. The father would call together the family and relatives. They would then discuss what arrangements and course they would follow. Different families had different teachings or traditions, and as such, each girl may have had different customs. In one example of the tradition, the family would take two strands of mountain goat wool, and tie them to each side of the girl's forehead. The community would see this signifier of her new womanhood, announcing to her people that she is of age. For four days, she would fast with no food and limited or no water. During this time, she would refrain from bathing and being near fires. It was believed if she was to go near the fire, her skin would become red. The women of her family, like her mother, grandmother or other women, would pull out the irregular hairs from the edges of her eyebrows to make them fine and beautiful. The edges were rubbed with the girl's saliva and a plant mixture to stop hairs from growing again. After the four days, the same woman would bathe and scrub her. The purpose of these traditions were to make her \\"bright and smart\\". Following the bathing, she would be given food and could then sit near the fire. When applicable, a family member would drape a blanket over the woman's shoulders. After the meal, she would be painted with red ochre. She would travel to the forest and pull down cedar and spruce tree branches, rubbing the ends of these over her face and body. This would to make her beautiful and charming in the eyes of men. She would give offerings of fern roots to those cedar trees. After all these things were conducted, she would be given an ancestral name, and the naming ceremony or potlatch would occur. = Naming = Naming customs are ancestral or hereditary naming. Within the traditional customs, when a child is born the elders of the child's family or community would choose a name.Hill-Tout, Charles. The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet. Talon Books, December 1978. p42 This is called a ninamin or nicknam used to name children. Years later while going through puberty or \\"coming-of-age\\" rituals, the person would receive a name from a deceased ancestor. These ancestral names can then be traced back many generations. The names are thus considered \\"property\\", in belonging to a family. These ancestral names are called \\"kweshamin\\". The family would host a potlatch and bestow the new ancestral name on the person. Within present practices, ancestral names are still passed on, but mostly when a family makes the preparations to host a potlatch and not just when a child begins puberty. Every name has a suffix ending, denoting masculine or feminine names, and sometimes having actual translations to their meaning. One example is the -lanexw ending. This is found in names like \\"Kiyapalanexw\\" which when Anglicized became \\"Capilano\\", \\"Xatsalanxw\\" which when Anglicized became \\"Kitsilano\\", and many other names. = Marriage = After a young boy or girl went through the proper \\"coming-of-age\\" rituals, or had reached puberty, they were ready to become adults. For young people around this age, marriage would be a priority.Hill-Tout, Charles. The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet. Talon Books, December 1978. p40. A young man would search out a prospective bride from another village or sometimes a neighboring nation. He would travel to the house of the prospective bride, sit outside the doorway with a blanket wrapped around him, and wait. He would wait here, not eating any foods or drinking any liquids during this time, usually lasting up to 4 days. While this occurred, the girl's family would take no notice of him. If acceptable to the parents, the mother of the prospective wife would approach a neighbor to inform the young man that the girl's parents are willing to accept him as their son-in-law. Neither the girl's family nor the young suitor would have any communication with each other. The neighbor would prepare and give a meal to the fasting man. He would then return home to his village and family to inform them of his acceptance. He would return days later with family and friends in canoes. If of lower ranking, he would return with one canoe load of blankets, but if of higher ranking, he would come with many canoe loads of gifts, blankets, and animal skins. All of these gifts would be distributed to the bride's family. Sometimes, the young man was not accepted by the young woman's family. A family council would be held to discuss the issue, and the young man might be rejected. A neighbor would be called upon to be an intermediary and inform him he is not invited into the house and to return home.Hill-Tout, Charles. The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet. Talon Books, December 1978. p41. During the night, the father-in- law would entertain the groom's family, and offer accommodation to them, with the host family sleeping on one side of the longhouse, and the groom's family living on the other. In the proceeding morning, both families would walk down to the beach front where the groom's canoe is moored. Here the bride's family placed blankets in the canoe. If the bride was of high rank or nobility, blankets would be lined up on the ground from the house to the canoe for the bride to walk on, while two older women led her down. The bride would be dressed in beautiful regalia in colours and ornaments. Over her head another blanket was placed, somewhat like a veil. Behind her would be carried personal belongings, such as things like mats, baskets, blankets, wooden platters, and spoons. The older women then placed the bride on the bow of the canoe, and for their services the groom thanked them with gifts or blankets. The bride's family and friends then returned to their home, while the young groom and his family returned to his village with the bride. If the family were not of nobility, most of these customs would not occur. After some days, the bride and groom would return to the woman's village with the father-of-the-bride hosting a feast for his guests. After this feast, the married couple and family returned to their home. Many days later, the bride's family traveled to the groom's village. They would bring gifts and blankets equal the number given to them. They distributed this all to the groom's friends and family, and celebrated with a large potlatch. During the potlatch, the bride would be placed on top of many blankets piled high, and would sit there during the ceremonies and speeches. Gifts would be given away, and the family and village would celebrate. After all these, the marriage ceremonies would end and the man and woman were regarded as husband and wife.  Games and sports  S·∏µwxw√∫7mesh daily life included an array of games and sports. One of the most well known games played was the bone game or slahal. This was played with two opposing teams. There were two sets of \\"bones\\", and two sets of sticks, numbering from 7-11 for each team. When a game was in play, one team had two sets of \\"bones\\". When your team was guessing, your objective was to get the right bone, the one without the stripe. When you had the bones, your objective was to make sure the other team guessed wrong on the bones set. When the other team guessed wrong, you gained a point. When a team had the two sets of bones, two individuals hid the bones and swapped them around from hand to hand. Eventually the bones were brought forward, but were concealed as to show the other team which one had a stripe on it. The game was usually accompanied by drumming and singing, used to boost the morale of the team. The side that had the bone sings, while the other tried to guess. Musical accompaniment was also sometimes used to taunt the other team. Gambling could be done by players, or spectators of a match. Placing bets on teams, or individual matches within the game between one guess and the other teams bone hiders. Other games included some played by children, and some played specifically by the warriors to prepare and train themselves. Some sports are similar to modern-day lacrosse, rugby, and soccer. The S·∏µwxw√∫7mesh game called , similar to lacrosse, was played in villages. A smooth oval stone weighing about three pounds, would be used by teams of two, around six on each team. There were no sticks or nets on open spaces. The goal posts were six feet apart on each side of an open space. In the last few decades, canoe racing has become popular among Coast Salish peoples. It's done with specifically designed war canoes or racing canoes. They are based on the more traditional canoe styles, but have quite a modern design. The canoe is usually a foot or two above water level, with enough width for one man. Different races include single, double, or 11-man races. The races are held in the summertime.  Language  The Squamish language, or S·∏µw _x_ w√∫7mesh language, is the ancestral language of the S·∏µwxÃ±w√∫7mesh people. It is considered an important part of cultural revitalization. Although nearing language extinction, it's still used in ceremonies, events, and basic conversation among some. With the language dead (no children are learning it as a first language and all language speakers are over the age of 65), much work is being done to preserve and revitalize it. The language is part the Coast Salish linguistic group, and is most closely related to Sh√°sh√≠sh√°lh (Sechelt), and S·∏µ'emin'em (Halkomelem) and Xwsa7km (Lh√©chalosem). Many anthropologists and linguists have worked with S·∏µw _x_ w√∫7mesh people and their language, including Franz Boas, Charles Hill-Tout, Homer Barnett, and Aert J. Kuipers. Since the late 1800s the language has had a history. Before contact, it was the prominent language of all the villages, along with the Chinook Jargon. Most children would learn Chinook as a first language because it was so basic, then S·∏µwxw√∫7mesh language as they became older. After the spread of diseases causing massive population drops and colonizations of their territory, Chinook became a minority language in their lands. When the Canadian government enforced assimilationist policies regarding their culture and language, a residential school was set up in the village of Eslha7an with children coming from many Skwxwu7mesh villages, plus some church officials sending children to another school in Sechelt. The school, a home for many children 10 months out of the year, were forbade to speak their language. Any children speaking the language were punished and beaten. This cause a deep resentment about speaking the language, and so the next generation grew up without any knowledge of their native tongue. Over the years, English became the prominent language. Then during the 1960s, a great deal of documentation and work helped in its revitalization. The BC Language Project with Randy Bouchard and Dorothy Kennedy undertook more documentation and were the main collaborators on this project. They devised the present writing system that is used for the S·∏µw _x_ w√∫7mesh language. Eventually a local elementary school and high school included language classes, as opposed to the normal French language option. Xwemelch'stn Estimxwataxw School, meaning Xwmelch'stn Littleones School, with grades Kindergarten to 3, was built to assist in language immersion, with plans to expand it into a full immersion school.Lancaster, Deanna. The North Shore News, Squamish build new school Front page.  Art  = Visual = Visuals include, Totem poles, Canoes, blankets, and baskets. = Weaving = Baskets, hats, as well as raincoats made from the inside bark of Cedar trees  Transportation  Being a coastal people, the S·∏µw _x_ w√∫7mesh historically travelled either by foot or by canoe. Different styles of canoe existed for different types of water. Seagoing canoes, typically larger, were used on the open ocean. Smaller inlet-style canoes were used in calmer waters and shorter travel to nearby villages or neighboring people. Cargo canoes were also made for trading large amounts of goods. The main way or transportation was through canoe pulling. Intricate paths and trails were developed to trade with interior nations more inland. Footnotes  Bibliography  * Barman, Jean (2007) [2005].

Caterpillar tracks are also used on the stairs. Laws = United Kingdom = The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 says that every person is to have a safe entrance into and exit from a building. Another law regarding chairs is the RRFSO. Created in 2005, this regulation states that fire officers are not required to enter buildings. Failure to follow the above laws can result in serious issues. If a person was to perish in the building due to a lack of adequate evacuation equipment, the owners or operators of the building could be charged with corporate manslaughter.

The involvement of more than one extremity is even more uncommon. There is a slight predilection for the lower limb affection namely the foot. The overgrown region consists predominantly of adipose tissue. Yet, other tissue components that represent the mesenchyme may be involved. Clinical presentation Macrodystrophia lipomatosa can manifest in functional incapacitation and esthetic problems. It is usually noticed by parents at birth or shortly after. It may be subject to an increase in size especially around puberty. The diagnosis is largely built upon establishing a comprehensive correlation between history and clinical examination on the one hand and characteristic imaging features on the other hand namely plain radiographs, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging examination. Imaging findings Plain radiographs may show bone overgrowth and deformity together with osteoarthritis changes in advanced cases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to delineate the extent of abnormal fatty tissue in various sequences. It may also be used as a tool for the differential diagnosis of ML. Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis of macrodystrophia lipomatosa includes a wide array of disorders which result in various degrees and patterns of limb overgrowth especially those occurring in childhood and adolescence. * Fibrolipomatous hamartoma * Proteus syndrome * Neurofibromatosis type 1. * Klippel Trenaunay syndrome. * Parkes Weber syndrome * Hemangiomas. Management No medical therapy exists for such a disorder. Treatment depends upon the patient's symptomatology. Gait and functional problems may be addressed by foot wear adjustments. Esthetic complaints may be addressed through plastic surgery procedures such as debulking surgery. If a significant deformity is present a corrective osteotomy can be performed in conjugation.

Al Jazeera career  Saeed manages Al Jazeera's global communications, and his tenure has seen the network's strongest period of worldwide publicity. He was responsible for promoting the network's coverage of the Arab uprisings which won global plaudits, and culminated in awards including Royal Television Society News Channel of the Year and a Peabody. That year, Al Jazeera English also won a DuPont, a George Polk, and a Four Freedoms Award. He coordinated the noted #freeajstaff press freedom campaign after Al Jazeera journalists were jailed in Egypt, a campaign which won an award in issues management. He has organised brand campaigns around the world - including in the United States, Australia, India, MENA and sub-Saharan Africa \\\\- and is a speaker at international PR conferences.

In March 2008, he called for legislation to be enacted against forced marriages,.Call for forced marriage debate, BBC News, 24 March 2008 The Scottish Government announced a consultation on the issue a few months later, and law was passed in 2011. In 2009, Saeed organised the responseCampaigners stage antiracism demo in Edinburgh, BBC News, 20 February 2010 to the far-right Scottish Defence League holding protests in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Along with lawyer Aamer Anwar, he brought together a broad coalition called Scotland United to stage a celebration of multiculturalism including the STUC, Church of Scotland, Equality and Human Rights Commission, all the major political parties and many others. He also organised a response to the attack by two Muslims youths on an Edinburgh synagogue by offering to protect the building.Edinburgh imams condemn synagogue attack, SIF blog, 20 March 2009 Osama had a role in the Stop the War Coalition, speaking at the anti-war demonstration on the eve of the Iraq war on 15 February 2003 which drew 1 million marchers.

Years before the Arab uprisings, Saeed was a proponent of democracy and freedoms in the Muslim world. He wrote a 2005 article in The Guardian suggesting that the restoration of a caliphate could be based on democracy and human rights in response to comments by prime minister Tony Blair saying that it was the preserve of Al Qaeda. In 2009, Saeed said that Islamism was ‚Äúirrelevant‚Äù, and that laws and public policy have to be made by leaders accountable to the people they govern. Saeed founded the Scottish-Islamic Foundation which was launched with cross- parliamentary backing in June 2008. The leaders of the SNP, Liberal Democrat and Conservative parties gave their support. Saeed's time at the Scottish- Islamic Foundation was dogged by allegations of cronyism after the organisation was awarded hundreds of thousands of pounds of grants by the SNP Government, the party for whom he was a parliamentary candidate. The funding was investigated by Audit Scotland who concluded that the appropriate procedures were followed in allocating the grant. The grant was provided to organise an Islamic cultural festival and a trade expo to attract investment from the Muslim world. Saeed suggested that Scotland hold a 'Tartan Week' in the Middle East to increase trade and investment.Muslim Scots launch 'Tartan Week' in the Middle East, Sunday Herald, 12 July 2009 After delays in delivery, the SIF returned much of the funding, but organised Salaam Scotland, Scotland's first national festival of Muslim cultures.

It is the main headquarters of Wakefield Metropolitan District Council. It is a Grade I listed building. History The Council Chamber, Wakefield Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, there was a need to find a permanent meeting place for the West Riding of Yorkshire County Council. Its first meeting was held in February 1889 in Wakefield Town Hall, at the invitation of the Borough Council.The West Riding County Council 1889‚Äì1974 For a permanent home the choice was between Leeds and Wakefield; much debate and correspondence resulted, in 1892, in the choice of Wakefield. The site chosen for the new County Hall was that of Rishworth House on Bond Street, a gentleman's house of 1812 bought by the West Riding Quarter Sessions in 1878. The County Council had received Rishworth House at its creation and used it for committee rooms, offices and a residence for the Deputy Clerk. In commissioning a new home, the County Council held an open architectural competition, instructing competitors to prefer \\"the style of architecture will be left to the competitors but the Queen Anne or Renaissance School of Architecture appears suited to an old town like Wakefield\\".County Council Records, 11 January 1893; Papers Building of County Hall The winning design was by James S Gibson, who proposed a Gothic design. The Council Chamber was placed on an upper storey and in the centre of the building, so as to minimize noise from the street. The interior decoration was largely designed by Henry Charles Fehr. On the main staircase an owl and some scales represent meditation and justice, against which recline the two winged figures of debate and dictation. The seal of the West Riding County Council hangs on each side. A second panel represents the main industries of the West Riding, surrounding the White Rose of York, all entwined by a serpent symbolising wisdom, crowned with a spray of oak for independence; beneath sprays of the honesty plant and the flax interwoven with each other represent honesty and industry. Two further panels show peace (a winged figure resting on an olive tree with ingrafted roses and sheltering a wren, doves in the tree and broken swords below) and plenty (a winged figure seated on a golden throne with arms outstretched over divers fruit and grain). Elsewhere are figures of art and science, the book of history, a winged flame representing inspiration and the lamp of knowledge; globes representing the domains of art and science appear below. The contract for the building of the hall, with Messrs. Armitage and Hodgson of Leeds contained a fair wages clause and a ban on subcontracting to employees in sweated trades. County Hall was built in the four years from 1894 and opened by the Marquess of Ripon on 22 February 1898. New wings were added to the original building between 1912 and 1915 by George Crook of Wakefield, but in a style which matched Gibson's original design. In 1913 a delegation from a joint committee of Middlesex County Council and the Middlesex Quarter Sessions visited Wakefield and commissioned a copy of the Council Chamber for their proposed Middlesex Guildhall.Middlesex County Council Committee Minutes, 1913 In 1974 the new West Yorkshire County Council inherited the building and used it as its headquarters until it was also abolished in 1986. The City of Wakefield Metropolitan District Council acquired the building in December 1987 and implemented a major refurbishment at a cost of over ¬£3 million. The Leader of the Council, Councillor John Pearman, unveiled a plaque to mark the acquisition of the building and its refurbishment in February 1991.

He promised Harris that he would be guaranteed employment with the company if Harris learned to read and write. Harris studied under a tutor and later continued to work for the company after Crockett died, as John Ringley and Jim Crockett, Jr. both upheld Crockett, Sr.'s promise. After Harris retired as both a manager and wrestler in 1979, he continued to work an office job for the company. He also served as groundskeeper at Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Park and worked at the Crockett family's convenience store. In 1988, Crockett, Jr. sold his wrestling organization to Ted Turner, who renamed it World Championship Wrestling. Harris continued to work for the company until he retired in 1990. Personal life George Harris was born in Dyersburg, Tennessee, a town on the Mississippi River. During his career, Harris was an alcoholic; he attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and quit drinking. After retiring from wrestling, he lived with his wife Edna in Stuarts Draft, Virginia.In 2002, he suffered a heart attack and died on November 29.

Together with another of the men there, Robert Poley, he had played a part in the discovery of the Babington plot against the life of the Queen in 1586, and at the time of Marlowe's death was engaged in a money-lending swindle with the third of them, Marlowe's reported killer Ingram Frizer. Early life Skeres was born the second son of a merchant tailor, Nicholas Skeres senior, in March 1563, probably in the family's parish of All-Hallows-the-Less, near London Bridge. His father died when he was only three years old, however, leaving each of his two sons and his widow a third of his estate. In fact this included land in Yorkshire, the Skeres or Skyeres family having once lived at Skyeres Hall near Wentworth. Despite his father's occupation, neither he nor his brother went to the Merchant Taylors' School, although according to the School's register, their cousin Ralph Skeres junior did attend in 1564. On the other hand, he does seem to have been a law student at Furnival's Inn, one of the Inns of Chancery, which would imply a reasonable level of education, and the relationships he apparently established with several well-known writers including Marlowe, would suggest it too. On 7 July 1585, writing to Lord Burghley, William Fleetwood mentioned a \\"Nicholas Skeeres\\" among a number of \\"maisterles men & cut-purses, whose practice is to robbe Gentlemen's chambers and Artificers' shoppes in and about London\\". However, as Charles Nicholl argues, it seems unlikely that such a man would be employed in important government business as this Nicholas Skeres appears to have been a year later. Confidence trickster In April 1593, Skeres was called before the Court of Star Chamber as a witness in the case of Smith vs Wolfall, in which the skinner Wolfall was accused of obtaining money under false pretences. Skeres had lured Smith into Wolfall's clutches, a role he admitted to having undertaken many times before over the past ten or twelve years. Wolfall's victims apparently included Matthew Royden, George Chapman and Thomas Lodge. In fact Skeres's association with loan sharks seems to have even gone back to his early teens, although he claimed that he had only ever done this under duress. A month after this appearance, however, he was engaged in exactly the same activity on behalf of Ingram Frizer, and his gulling of a young man called Drew Woodleff. and Government agent It has been suggested that a man called \\"Skeggs\\", known to have been in the company of Sir Francis Walsingham's young relative Thomas Walsingham in France in 1581, was this Nicholas Skeres. Whether this is true or not, there is little doubt that he was involved in Sir Francis's disclosure of the 1586 Babington plot with Thomas Walsingham and Robert Poley. Here is how Charles Nicholl describes it. \\"(T)wo of Babington's 'crew' ... had been seen there: 'Dunn' and 'Skyeres'. Dunn is Henry Dunne, who was among those executed the following month. 'Skyeres'‚Äîa spelling he uses in his signature‚Äîis almost certainly Nicholas Skeres. It looks like he was there as a government plant. He was recognized by (Sir Francis) Walsingham's watchers, and was named without further comment in (the) report. His name does not figure among those later arrested. He quietly drops from the story, almost certainly because he was Walsingham's man all along.\\" In 1589 Skeres was also paid on a warrant signed by Sir Francis Walsingham for the carrying of confidential letters between the Earl of Essex (in Exeter) and the court. Witness of Christopher Marlowe's death In 1925, Leslie Hotson discovered details of the inquest on the death of the famous poet/dramatist, Christopher Marlowe, in the house of Eleanor Bull in Deptford, at which Nicholas Skeres was one of the three \\"gentlemen\\" also present. The report itself tells us that one of them, Ingram Frizer, having been attacked by Marlowe from behind because of a dispute over payment of the bill (the \\"reckoning\\"), killed him in self-defence by stabbing him over the right eye. Skeres and the other man, government agent Robert Poley‚Äîwith whom Skeres had worked on exposing the Babington plot‚Äîtestified that they were sitting on either side of Frizer in such a manner that he \\"in no wise could take flight\\" when Marlowe attacked him. Although some biographers still accept the story told at the inquest as a true account,For example and the majority nowadays find it hard to believe, and suggest that it was a deliberate murder, even though there is little agreement as to just who was behind it or their motive for such a course of action.See, for example, , , , , , , and ‚Äîall of whom offer different explanations. The Marlovian theory even argues that the most logical reason for those people to have been there at that time was to fake Marlowe's death, allowing him to escape almost certain trial and execution for his seditious atheism. Skeres and the Earl of Essex It is not clear exactly who it was that Skeres was serving when carrying the messages between Essex and the court in 1589, but there is no doubt that he became a servant of the former when he went to France with Essex as a member of his expeditionary force to Normandy in 1591/2. During his appearance in 1593 before the Star Chamber‚Äîof which Essex was a new member‚Äîhe was still referring to the Earl as his \\"lord and master\\". In an undated letter from Skeres to Essex's right-hand man Gelly Meyrick,Found by Paul Hammer in the Devereux papers at Longleat, he indicates that he is for some reason no longer in the Earl's good books, and seeks Meyrick's help in returning to the Earl's service. He insists that he intends to amend his previous ways (which seems to refer to his touting for loan sharks) which suggests a date after 1593 and before 1596 (because the \\"Mr. Meyrick\\" to whom he wrote became \\"Sir Gelly\\" Meyrick in 1596). In this case, the letter seems to have worked, since (as Hotson puts it) \\"'Nicholas Kyrse, alias Skeers, servant to the Earl of Essex' was arrested on 13 March 1594/5 by Sir Richard Martin, Alderman, \\"in a very dangerous company\\" at the house of one Williamson.\\" Nicholl puts this in context, however. \\"It is decided 'to discharge all the persons committed that gave us good account of their dealings'. Skeres was among those released\\" and \\"Skeres's presence in (Williamson's) house suggests his use of 'brokery' as a cover for political surveillance. Nicholas Williamson had been 'apprehended for treason' a few days earlier.\\" That Skeres continued to serve the Earl of Essex seems fairly likely, as the last time we hear of him is on 31 July 1601, after the failure of the Essex Rebellion, when Skeres was arrested along with other Essex supporters. The Privy Council issued warrants to the Keeper of the prison at Newgate for \\"the removal of Nicholas Skiers and --- Farmer, prisoners in his custodie, unto Bridewell\\". As was so often the case with Bridewell prison's political prisoners, nothing is heard of him after that date.

Malawi has several tourist attraction sites including its most exquisite freshwater Lake Malawi, several national parks, game reserves, and the scenic Mulanje Mountain. The tourism industry in Malawi has significantly grown since the mid-1970s, and the Malawian government is attempting to expand it further. The tourism industry was, however, significantly affected in the 1980s by an economic recession in South Africa‚Äîwhere most Malawian tourists come from. The sector was also greatly affected by the destabilisation of Zimbabwe but it has seen double-digit growth in recent years. Tourism contributed 4,5% to the national GDP in 2014 and provided 3,8% of all jobs.name=World Travel & Tourism Council>  Main tourist attraction sites  Main tourist attractions centres in Malawi are Lake Malawi, mountains such as Zomba Plateau and Mulanje Mountain, not forgetting the country's national parks. The tourist industry promotes Malawi's national parks including Nyika National Park, Kasungu National Park, and Liwonde National Park. Of all the national parks in the Warm Heart of Africa, Lake Malawi National Park is a UNESCO heritage site as it has unique species. Other than the beautiful lake and national parks, tourist have a lot of other beautiful sites to visit while in Malawi such as the rock paintings at Chongoni.  Lake Malawi  Covering almost a fifth of the country, Lake Malawi is the most defining feature in the Warm Heart of Africa. Lake Malawi spans from the Northern region of the country through the Southern region with its northern part being the deepest. It is the world's eighth largest freshwater lake and Africa's third largest lake. Sometimes known as the Lake of Stars, Lake Malawi is the country's largest contributor to its tourism industry due to its unmatched splendor and diversity of species that are found nowhere else in the world. The lake has crystal clear waters, and a vast majority of cichlids which add an exquisite scenery under the waters of this beautiful lake. The lake has a lot to offer from snorkeling to diving and many other water sports including kayaking and horse riding.  Beaches  Along the shores of Lake Malawi are many beautiful beaches where tourists can visit and have some fun. Some of the most notable beaches on the shores of Lake Malawi include Kande Beach and Chintheche Inn in Nkhata Bay.

Life and career Gibson was born in Arbroath the son of William Gibson and Elizabeth Sivewright and the brother of Robert Gibson, civil engineer and architect, practising in Dundee. He was articled to Ireland & Maclaren, Dundee, from 1877 to 1881, and was thereafter a draughtsman with Pearce Brothers, engineers, and then with Alexander Hutcheson. He subsequently moved to London and worked for William Wallace, Harry Wilkinson Moore, and finally Thomas Edward Collcutt. At some point he travelled in France and Italy before commencing practice and passing the qualifying exam, both in 1889. He was admitted an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects, his proposers being the Dundee architect John Murray Robertson, Collcutt and James Brooks. In that year, he set up in independent practice. In 1890, he entered into partnership with Samuel Bridgman Russell, also from William Wallace's office. Born in 1864, Russell had been articled to Henry Hewitt Bridgman 1881‚Äì84 and had studied at the Royal Academy Schools from 1882, thereafter becoming a draughtsman in the office of Thomas Chatfield Clarke. The partnership of Gibson and Russell was dissolved in 1899, Russell entering into partnership with Edwin Cooper a few years later and eventually becoming Chief Architect to the Ministry of Health. Thereafter Gibson practised in partnership with William Wallace until 1909, when he took into partnership his two senior assistants, Frank Peyton Skipwith and Walter Symington Athol Gordon. Born in 1881, Skipwith was educated at Cheam School and Neuenheim College, Heidelberg, and articled to Gibson in 1903, remaining as an assistant and studying at the Architectural Association. He did not however take the qualifying exam and was admitted LRIBA on 20 March 1911. Gordon, born in 1879, had been articled to Robert Rowand Anderson 1895‚Äì1901 and had studied under Frank Worthington Simon at the Edinburgh School of Applied Art before joining Gibson. Like Skipwith, Gibson did not take the qualifying exam, being elected LRIBA on 27 February 1911. Skipwith enlisted in the armed forces in the First World War and was killed in action in France in September 1915. The practice continued thereafter as Gibson & Gordon. Gibson died on 27 March 1951 at the age of eighty nine. Buildings Gibson was one of his period's \\"competition men\\" who \\"made his career by winning competitions\\".Sir John Summerson, The Turn of the Century: Architecture in Britain around 1900 He had a remarkable record of success in competitions, beginning with the London County Council hostel in Drury Lane, London in 1891, the West Riding County Hall in Wakefield, completed in 1898, and possibly his greatest achievement, the Middlesex Guildhall, 1913. Gibson's style was generally Gothic in conception. Where he worked with Henry Charles Fehr, as at the West Riding County Hall and the Middlesex Guildhall, the result of Gibson's architecture and Fehr's exuberant internal design was a remarkable combination of Gothic and art nouveau, in both of which styles Fehr excelled.

In the early years of the school, the first two floors of the building were dedicated to the elementary school and the third floor was occupied by Sequoia High School. This was the only school on the Peninsula between San Francisco and Santa Clara at the time of its opening. By 1927, the Redwood City Grammar School was demolished and replaced by the Fox Theatre. One of the earliest graduating students in the RCSD school district was Roy Cloud, he graduated from Sequoia High School in 1898. Cloud became a teacher at Redwood City Grammar School, while working on his degree from Stanford University. A school building nearby on Broadway Street near Middlefield Road existed from 1904 until 1928 and occupied an elementary school named Central School.

He was vice president of the Los Angeles Hibernian Bank, treasurer of the Los Angeles Symphony Association, and president of the Automobile Association of Southern California. He owned the Santa Maria Valley Railroad, established Rosemary Farm, and developed the Santa Maria Ice and Cold Storage Plant. Biography Captain G. Allan Hancock was born in San Francisco, California, on July 26, 1875. He was the son of Major Henry Hancock and Ida Haraszthy Hancock (Ida Hancock Ross). His maternal grandfather was Count Agoston Haraszthy, the \\"Father of California Viticulture\\". Hancock received his early education in the primary schools and at Brewer's Military Academy in San Mateo, California, which he attended during 1888 and 1889. In 1890, he enrolled as a student at the Belmont School in Belmont, California. Hancock was eight years old when his father died in 1884. He continued in the management and operation of La Brea ranch until he was 25. Hancock married Genevieve Deane Mullen (Feb. 12, 1879‚ÄìNov. 28, 1936\\"Genevieve Deane Mullen\\", genealogy.com; accessed 2013.04.08.) in Los Angeles on November 27, 1901.

It was at this period that the early discoveries of petroleum were being made in California. Rancho La Brea was one of the localities in which petroleum was found. In 1900, Ida Hancock granted a 20-year lease to the Salt Lake Oil Company for of Rancho La Brea. Hancock abandoned his agricultural pursuits and turned his attention to petroleum production. In 1907, after spending three years studying the industry, he urged his mother to allow him enough capital to sink a well on a portion of the property that had not already been leased to oil operators. With the assistance of William Orcutt, Hancock drilled 71 wells near the family's ranch house. Every well-produced oil and the Rancho La Brea Oil Company was born. The family's finances improved greatly with the beginning of oil pumping. The wells produced millions of barrels annually, resulting in the family becoming very wealthy. With that wealth, Hancock was able to pursue myriad interests and thus began a life of philanthropy. Hancock died on May 31, 1965, of a heart attack in Santa Maria, California. His bequests continued his long-time support of numerous causes. Civic life and legacy Hancock from the 1950 USC yearbook Hancock was also interested in music and played the cello in the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra.

It has been significant since colonial times, as it was located beside the Royal Way, a road which leads to the city of Villeta. Today, it is experiencing great industrial growth. History Some historians claim that the town was begun by Dr Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia (1814‚Äì1840), who established a fortress to defend the Paraguayan territory. Others say the town began around 1679. In 1782 the Franciscan Missionaries founded an Indian town in the area with donations of the neighbors of Asuncion. San Antonio may have been founded in 1890 by the German citizen Gustavo Conrado Gotees (born Conrad G√∂tz in Schnabelwald, Germany). San Antonio was important in the Paraguayan War (1864‚Äì1870). Brazilian troops arrived in its ports, en route to the historical battle of Ytororo in December 1868. After the war San Antonio was empty. In 1903 the Paraguayan citizen Agustin Qui√±√≥nez moved there, and promoted the city; this was a second foundation of the town. A few families of French, Italian, German and Spanish origins came to settle. Location San Antonio is located on the Paraguay River, latitude 25 38 and longitude 57 63 in the south center 25 km from the capital, Asuncion. In the north it is bordered by the districts of √ëemby and Villa Elisa, in the south with Ypane, in the east with √ëemby and in the west with the Paraguay River. There are 17 neighborhoods: San Francisco, Mbocayaty, Pueblo, San Blas, Ma. Auxiliadora, Naranjaty, Antigua Imagen, San Jorge, Acosta √ëu, Achucarro, Cerrito, San Agust√≠n, Amanecer, Las Garzas, La Merced, Cerrito, and Achucarro.

Politics Statue honoring Don Benigno Arrua. On March 16, 1981, San Antonio was ascended to the category of city. Its first mayor was Francisco Bogado Caballero. On April 21, 1903, the Senate and the Congress issued a law declaring the community a District. Flora In the city there are a great variety of trees such as the tajy or lapacho, tr√©bol, pine, eucalyptus, cedar laurel and palm. The most important forest reservation is the Parque Ytoror√≥. Population More than 50% of the population is between 15 and 45 years of age. Education and health care The city has both private and public schools. There are 11 national schools amount and 10 private ones dedicated to elementary teaching. There are three national high schools and two private ones.

Between 35 and 40 patients are seen per week and the emergency service is available 24 hours. The Instituto de Previci√≥n Social I.P.S has a peripheral presence in the city. Industries There are many industries in this young city. Business include tanning and alcohol production. Some communication companies are located in this city, offering both cellular and radial communication. =International Products Corporation= The first industry that was established in the city was the International Products Corporation (IPC) slaughterhouse, which was the primary employer in San Antonio and other towns in the area. Founded May 30, 1917, it was a slaughterhouse for cattle, pigs and goats, with facilities to prepare and refrigerate with modern equipment. In the first year the company exported 73,443 boxes of refrigerated meat. Two refrigerated ships were bought, the Paraguay and the Ytororo. A siren sounded daily at 2 AM for about 20 minutes so that the workers get ready to begin the work day at 3 AM. The company had a villa for 1,400 employees, with a communal kitchen and laundry.

The main job of most cleaners is to clean floors. Reasons for cleaning floors  The principal reasons for floor cleaning are: * To prevent injuries due to tripping or slipping. Injuries due to slips and trips on level floors are a major cause of accidental injury or death. Bad practice in floor cleaning is itself a major cause of accidents.http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web/slips02.pdf HSE information sheet: Slips and trips: The importance of floor cleaning * To beautify the floor. * To remove stains, dirt, litter and obstructions. * To remove grit and sand which scratch and wear down the surface. * To remove allergens, in particular dust. * To prevent wear to the surface (e.g. by using a floor wax or protective sealant). * To make the environment sanitary (e.g. in kitchens). * To maintain an optimum traction (e.g. for dance floors). Methods of floor cleaning The treatment needed for different types of floors is very different. Slipping is a common safety hazard for cleaning methods that involve water or other liquids, especially if the floor is left wet.http://www.hse.gov.uk/slips/kitchens/floorcleaning.pdf HSE: Stop slips in kitchens Sawdust is used on some floors to absorb any liquids that fall rather than trying to prevent them being spilt. The sawdust is swept up and replaced each day. This was common in the past in pubs and is still used in some butchers and fishmongers. It used to be common to use tea leaves to collect dirt from carpets and remove odours. There are also a wide variety of floor cleaning machines available today such as floor buffers, automatic floor scrubbers and sweepers, and carpet extractors that can deep clean almost any type of hard floor or carpeted flooring surface in much less time than it would take using a traditional cleaning method. =Wood flooring= Different types of wood flooring may require completely different care depending on whether they are waxed, oiled or have a polyurethane coating. It is important to determine the type of finish of a wood floor and always treat it in the proper manner, for instance it is difficult to clear wood floor wax from a floor coated with polyurethane. Simple cleaning instructions: # Clear the floor of any furniture that is easy to move. # Sweep or vacuum all loose dirt and debris. # Mop the floor, going along with the grain. For a polyurethane coated floor, dampen a mop with water and a few drops of dishwashing liquid. Be sure to ring out the mop thoroughly before using it on the floor. Run the mop back and forth, going with the grain of the wood in smooth strokes. Do not use water for lacquered or shellacked floors, as it can stain the wood and cause buckling. # Buff the floor with a soft cloth to remove any soapy residue. Cloth diapers work well for buffing since they are very soft and absorbent. =Tile and stone= Tile and stone flooring is common in kitchens, stairs, and bathrooms. Its cleaning process can be divided into three steps: # Dirt or dust should first be removed with a vacuum cleaner or a broom. # Have a floor cleaning solution or spray bottle for the appropriate floor. If you are cleaning stone floors (marble, granite, travertine, etc.), make sure the cleaning agent states that it is for stones. An acidic tile cleaning solution can be used on ceramic and porcelain floors # After spraying the tile or stone floors in a small area, use a mop to clean and scrub floors. Then wipe it with dry cloth. =Vinyl composition tile= Vinyl composition tile or VCT is a common commercial floor type. Cleaning this type of floor is done with either a mop and bucket or with a floor scrubber. VCT requires a polymer coating or floor finish to protect it. This needs to be kept clean with dust mopping and wet cleaning (i.e. wet mopping or floor scrubber). Reducing the need for cleaning A well-maintained entrance matting can dramatically reduce the need for cleaning. For public and office buildings, about 80 to 90% of the dirt is tracked in from outside. Installing a total of 15 feet of matting consisting of both indoor and outdoor sections will remove about 80% of this.http://www.carpet-rug.org/pdf_word_docs/040504_CM_Guidelines.pdf The Carpet and rug Institute: Carpet Maintenance Guidelines Thus, about two-thirds of the dirt can be removed at the entrance.

Valentine, children Elsie Wood Valentine, and Paul McLane Valentine. Window shows need of repair and updating due to seismic activity and age. John Joseph Valentine Sr. (November 12, 1840 ‚Äì December 21, 1901) was an American expressman. He was the first president of Wells Fargo & Company who had not been a banker and served from 1892 until his death in 1901. Early life He was born in 1840 at Bowling Green, Kentucky, the son of William Crenshaw Valentine and Eliza (Cunningham) Valentine. His Valentine ancestors from Eccles, Lancaster, England, had settled in Virginia in the 17th century. After attending the common schools, Valentine began his business career in 1854 working for Younglove Brothers, druggists and agents for Carter, Thomas & Company's express line in Bowling Green. Later he worked for O'Bannon, Kean & Company and then for the Adams Express Company until 1861. Joins Wells Fargo In the spring of 1861 Valentine went to California, where he was joint agent for Wells Fargo & Company, the Pioneer Stage Company and the California State Telegraph Company at Strawberry Valley, California. Soon after, he was transferred to Virginia City, Nevada, as agent for Wells Fargo, the Pioneer Stage Line and John Butterfield's Overland Mail Company. Valentine was named superintendent of express for Wells Fargo's Pacific Division in November 1866. On an inspection trip in a snowbound region in 1867, his horse threw him and he fell head first over a embankment. He was very successful at negotiating contracts with competing express companies that enabled the company to expand its services across a wide area, even though they jealously served by a variety of railroads. In 1888, as general superintendent he successfully linked up a through express line from the Atlantic Ocean in New York City to the Pacific at San Francisco. Valentine was appointed general superintendent at Wells Fargo's corporate headquarters in New York City in 1869. The headquarters was moved to San Francisco in 1870, whereupon he maintained his residence in Oakland until his death. He was a member of Advent Episcopal Church and vice president of YMCA of Oakland. He was appointed general superintendent of Wells Fargo's express department on February 8, 1872. Upon the resignation of Charles F. Crocker in August 1882, Valentine was elected vice president and a director of Wells Fargo. He was also general manager of the company from the beginning of 1884. His annually published summary of the American production of gold and silver was comprehensive in its research and recognized as authoritative on the subject. Opposed to the free coinage of silver as likely to cause a glut in the domestic market and depreciate its value, in 1891 Valentine's contributions to the press on the subject were notable for close reasoning, careful research, and a formidable array of statistics in support of his conclusions. Valentine was critical of the relaxed banking practices uncovered during audits of Wells Fargo's branches in 1891. When Lloyd Tevis was ousted as president of Wells Fargo on August 11, 1892, Valentine was elected his successor. Although Valentine was a prime expressman, in the opinion of a later Wells Fargo Bank president, Frederick L. Lipman, he was the company's first president who was not a banker. Valentine wrote a number of pamphlets on financial subjects, notably, one titled Money that advocated a parity of value to be maintained between gold and silver. He was a member and Vestryman of Advent Episcopal Church of Oakland since at least 1885 (in the late 1920s the church's name was changed to St. James the Apostle Episcopal Church]), and Vice President of the San Francisco YMCA. After a new church built at 1540 12th Avenue in Oakland Valentine \\"challenged members parishioners to eliminate the debt. He offered to match the donations of others up to half the debt total. By that program his desire was achieve; the debt was wiped out.\\" He was married to Mary George and they were the parents of John J. Valentine Jr., born in 1881. At the time of his death, Valentine was married to Alice B. M. Valentine, and they had seven children, four from John's first marriage. Valentine died on December 21, 1901 in Oakland, California. At Valentine's funeral on December 23, 1901, Advent Episcopal Church \\"was filled to overflowing and a choir of nearly 50 took part...outside, the funeral procession included a large Wells Fargo express wagon draped with flowers. California Bishop Nichols spoke of Valentine as the 'honored and honest head' of a large corporation who was 'Christian in conviction, in conduct' and who had a 'warm heart for his fellow man.' Though this was the era of \\"robber barons,\\" it was his delight to say that the profits were distributed to '20,000 persons scattered all over the country, and that many were widows and orphans. Valentine frequently became aware of local disasters at points throughout the nation where Wells Fargo maintained offices. So he often began campaigns for relief funds for the needy throughout the nation. John J. Valentine was reputed to be a compassionate gentleman, so honored at his funeral.\\" Advent Episcopal Church became St. James the Apostle Episcopal Church, which is still located at the 12th Avenue address. The church contains a phenomenal glass window commemorating his wife Mary F. Valentine and two of their children who died at 2 1/2 years old and 10 months old. Legacy Dudley Evans was elected to succeed him as president of Wells Fargo on January 2, 1902.

It is a historical villa, dating from the second half of the sixteenth century. History The first mention of the villa dates back to 1593, as belonging to the Buonvisi family. It was bought later by Nicola Santini, into whose family it passed. Santini rebuilt the south facade in the Baroque style at the end of the seventeenth century, probably in imitation of the architecture of Versailles where he was ambassador to the Republic of Lucca. The rebuilding involved the addition of two wings to the villa, and the modification of the front by the addition of a massive scale range leading to a serliana, duplicated on the upper floor with two balconies, decorated with statues. He also laid out new gardens. At the front, parterres were arranged around two pools. At the rear, a fountain was built as the focus of the garden, and another sunken 'garden of Flora' was laid out to the east. In 1816 Victoria Santini married into the eponymous Torrigiani family, who uprooted the existing garden to make an 'English style' park. Only the garden of Flora survived. Now the villa is owned by Fabio Colonna di Stigliano. Architecture The villa stands out from other villas in Lucca and in Tuscany by the multicoloured facade of the main building obtained using different materials: stone grey and tuff alternating yellow pillars and arches, marble statues of white, ochre plaster at the bottom with the upper part in white. Even the use of parapets on the windows or openings are original elements, which are found also at the nearby Villa Mansi. The person responsible for this decoration was the Bolognese architect Alfonso Torregiani. The facade at the back is of late Renaissance style, characterized by a large portico of the Tuscan order. Inside there is an elliptical staircase, decorated with stucco and other ornamentation. There is a private theatre. The park The secret garden and stairway concealing the nymphaeum The surviving layout of the garden dates back to the Santini family in 1650. The main axis of the villa is highlighted by a row of magnificent cypress trees, approximately 700 metres, which complement the facade of the villa. At the end of the avenue, near a majestic gate that enters the house, there is a small village, once intended for the servants. There is a small garden, enclosed by a network and used as an aviary, a fish farm with jets of water, and the secret garden of Flora with an Italian nymphaeum. The heart of the park is the Nymphaeum of Winds, named for the statues personifying the winds, where the paths converge. There are a number of giochi d'acqua by means of which the marquis would bemuse unwary guests, chasing them into the garden from the upper terrace. Once there, they would try to shelter in the Temple of Flora, only to find themselves soaked by water pouring from the domed ceiling. In Florence the house at the Garden Torrigiani is sometimes referred to as Villa Torrigiani. At Scandicci (Florence) there is another Villa Torrigiani in Renaissance style, home today to a winery.

In general parallel thinking is a further development of the well known lateral thinking processes, focusing even more on explorations‚Äîlooking for what can be rather than for what is. Definition Parallel thinking is defined as a thinking process where focus is split in specific directions. When done in a group it effectively avoids the consequences of the adversarial approach (as used in courts). In adversarial debate, the objective is to prove or disprove statements put forward by the parties (normally two). This is also known as the dialectic approach. In Parallel Thinking, practitioners put forward as many statements as possible in several (preferably more than two) parallel tracks. This leads to exploration of a subject where all participants can contribute, in parallel, with knowledge, facts, feelings, etc. Crucial to the method is that the process is done in a disciplined manner, and that all participants play along and contribute in parallel. Thus each participant must stick to the specific track.

In gratitude for this success, he built at Megara a temple of Artemis Agrotera and Apollo Agraeus. He also restored the walls of Megara, which had been destroyed by the Cretans.Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 1.41.5 In this work he was said to have been assisted by Apollo, and the stone upon which the god used to place his lyre while he was at work, was even in late times believed to produce a sound similar to that of a lyre when struck.Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 1.42.1Ovid, Metamorphoses 8.15Hesiod, Theogony 751 Echepolis, one of the sons of Alcathous, was killed during the Calydonian hunt in Aetolia, and when his brother Callipolis hastened to carry the sad tidings to his father, he found him engaged in offering a sacrifice to Apollo, and thinking it unfit to offer sacrifices at such a moment, he snatched away the wood from the altar. Alcathous imagining this to be an act of deliberate sacrilege, killed his son on the spot with a piece of wood. The acropolis of Megara was called by a name derived from that of Alcathous.Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 1.42.7 Alcathous was grandfather of the hero Ajax, via his daughter Periboea, who married Telamon, and of Iolaus, nephew and charioteer of Heracles, by his other daughter Automedusa.

The regiment is under the operational command of the Director Special Forces and includes signal squadrons from both the Royal Corps of Signals and the Royal Navy. History The regiment traces its lineage to 18 Signal Regiment formed in 1959 in Singapore as part of the Far East Land Forces (FARELF) which was disbanded on 1 December 1971. The 18 (UKSF) Signal Regiment was secretly established in April 2005 at the same time as the Special Reconnaissance Regiment (SRR). The establishment of the SRR was announced by the Secretary of State for Defence in the House of Commons. The regiment was formed around the existing communication capabilities of the Special Air Service (SAS) and Special Boat Service (SBS), namely 264 (SAS) Signal Squadron based at Stirling Lines, Herefordshire, SBS Signal Squadron based at RM Poole, Dorset and 63 (SAS) Signal Squadron (V) of the Territorial Army (now known as Army Reserve). 264 (SAS) Signal Squadron was formed in July 1966 to support 22 SAS and traces its lineage to a signal troop formed in 1951 for the Malayan Scouts. 63 (SAS) Signal Squadron (V) was formed on 1 April 1967 to support 21 SAS and 23 SAS from elements of 41 Signal Regiment, 63 Signal Regiment, 327 Signal Squadron and 115 Field Squadron Royal Engineers. The regiment also incorporated 267 (SRR) Signal Squadron to support the SRR and a new squadron 268 (UKSF) Signal Squadron. 267 Signal Squadron had been formed on 18 December 1987. 268 (UKSF) Signal Squadron incorporated the strategic communications element from 264 (SAS) Signal Squadron which provided long range strategic communications. The regimental emblem is a Xiphos sword with the number 18 in Roman numerals and three signal flashes representing the three supported regiments: SAS, SBS and SRR. The regiment served in Afghanistan and Iraq with several operators killed on special forces operations. 63 (SAS) Signal Squadron (R) was re-designated as 63 (UKSF) Signal Squadron circa 2014. Role The regiment is tasked to deliver the \\"military CIS capability to enable UK Special Forces operations worldwide in support of Government, Foreign, Security and Defence Policy\\" with operators providing close support to the SAS, the SBS and the SRR. Selection and training Regular members of all three services of the Armed Forces and members from the Army Reserve are eligible to apply to join the regiment. An applicant is required to successfully pass a 5 day Briefing Course and then successfully complete a 25 week UK Special Forces Communicators Course (UKSFCC) to become a Special Forces Communicator (SFC). Prior to attempting the UKSFCC, applicants have the option of attending a 3 week SFC Preparation Course. The Special Forces Communicators Course consists of six phases: technical trade assessment, general support communications, physical aptitude, close support communications, conduct after capture, military training and special forces parachute training. Applicants for reserve service in 63 (UKSF) Signal Squadron have to successfully pass an Assessment Course conducted over three weekends and then complete a two week Royal Signals Communications Training course to be eligible to be accepted as Fit for Appointment to the squadron.

Low, Marston, Co. 1897, page 58 Biography John Penington was the second cousin of Sir Isaac Penington or Pennington, and the son of Robert Penington of Henham in Essex, described as a tanner. He is said to have been baptised at Henham on 30 January 1568; but the circumstances of his later career, and the fact that he is unmentioned during the war with Spain or for twelve years after its close, suggest that he was born at a later date. It is possible that he and his half-brother, also John, born in 1584, have been confused together. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography speculates that on balance his date of birth was 1584. =Captaincy= His name first appears as captain of his own ship, the Star, and vice-admiral under Sir Walter Raleigh in the voyage to the Orinoco in 1617. He remained with Raleigh at the mouth of the river; but putting into Kinsale, on the way home, the ship was seized by order of the Lord Deputy of Ireland, and in London he himself was thrown into prison. In a petition to the council he stated that he had lost ¬£2,000, his whole property, in the voyage; now his ship was taken from him; not having been at St. Thomas's, he could give no information as to what had been done. He gave evidence, however, that Raleigh had 'proposed the taking of the Mexico fleet if the mine failed'. Raleigh, writing from Saint Kitts on 21 March 1617‚Äì18, described him as 'one of the sufficientest gentlemen for the sea that England hath'. His imprisonment does not seem to have been long, and during the latter months of 1618 and through 1619 he was applying to the East India Company for employment, with a recommendation from the Duke of Buckingham. His applications were unsuccessful, and in 1620 he was in the service of the crown as captain of the Zouch Ph≈ìnix, in the expedition against Algiers under Sir Robert Mansell. =Command of the Victory= In December 1621 he was appointed to command the Victory, in which, in the following May, he carried Count Gondomar to Spain. In 1625 he was in command of the Vanguard, which, with seven hired merchant ships, the king and Buckingham had agreed to place at the disposal of the King of France for eighteen months, 'against whomsoever except the King of Great Britain.' Buckingham had probably persuaded himself that this meant against the Genoese or Spaniards, and was sorely mortified when he found that the king of France meant to use them against the rebellious Huguenots of Rochelle. The ships were ready on 11 April; but when the owners and captains understood that they were to be called on to serve against the French Protestants, they showed very clearly that they would not do so, and Sir Ferdinando Gorges, the vice-admiral of the fleet, absented himself till compelled to appear by threats of imprisonment. On 8 May Penington, as admiral of the fleet, was ordered to cross the Channel and deliver the ships; but with his orders he received an explanatory letter, directing him not to meddle with the civil war in France, or to take part in any attack on the Protestants. But at Dieppe he was plainly told by the French that he was to be employed against Rochelle: the two orders were directly contrary, and he was probably glad to escape from the embarrassment by positively refusing to take on board the ships a large number of French soldiers, which would have been equivalent to giving up the command of the squadron. While the French were arguing the point with him, or writing to England to get Penington's orders altered, Penington discovered that he could not keep the ships lying there in an open roadstead, and returned to Portsmouth. After a delay of more than two months, during which he received many perplexing and contradictory instructions, affairs took a more peaceful appearance as far as the Huguenots were concerned, and on 28 July he received a formal order to deliver up the Vanguard and the other ships to the French, and at the same time a private note of the king's certain knowledge that peace was made with the Huguenots, and that war would be declared against Spain. On 3 August he arrived at Dieppe; on the 5th he handed over the Vanguard to the French, and the other ships‚Äî-except that of Gorges‚Äî-a day or two later; but the men refused to serve, and were sent home. On the impeachment of Buckingham, in the following year, it was stated that Penington, by firing on these other ships, had compelled them to surrender; but of this there is no contemporary evidence, and the fact is improbable. =Admiral= His was appointed Rear-Admiral of the Narrow Seas from 1623 to 1626. On 3 December 1626 Penington, was next appointed Commander-in-Chief, the Downs, and was ordered to seize French ships. The determination of Richelieu to make France a maritime power was held to be an insult to the supremacy of England; and on the 24th Penington was directed to go to Le Havre, where eight ships which the French king had lately bought from the Dutch were lying. These he was, if possible, to provoke into firing at him, but in any case to pick a quarrel with them, and so to take, sink, or burn them. Penington put to sea prepared to obey, but, after looking into Havre and finding no ships there, he returned to Falmouth, and wrote to Buckingham complaining that he had been sent out at the bad time of the year, with only three weeks' provisions on board, his ships in bad order, badly supplied and badly manned, 'so that if we come to any service, it is almost impossible we can come off with honour or safety.' In the following spring he put to sea under more favourable circumstances, and captured and sent in some twenty French ships at one time, and swept the sea from Calais to Bordeaux. The prizes were sold, the sailors and soldiers, who had been on the verge of mutiny, were paid, and France, it was said, would provide the means for her own ruin. In 1631 Penington, with his flag in the Convertine, was appointed Admiral of the Narrow Seas for second time.' He was employed on the same service through the summer of 1633 and of 1634, with his flag in the Unicorn, on board which ship he was knighted by the king on 14 April. In 1635, in the Swiftsure, he was rear admiral of the fleet under the Earl of Lindsey, Sir William Monson being the vice-admiral; and on Lindsey and Monson leaving the fleet in October, Penington remained in command of the winter guard. =Downfall= In the following years he was still on the same service, and in September 1639 was lying in the Downs with a strong squadron, when the Spanish fleet for Dunkirk, with a large body of troops on board, was driven in by the Dutch fleet under the command of Tromp, which also came in and anchored in the Downs. Penington insisted that the two enemies should respect the neutrality of the roadstead; but he had a very insufficient force, and the orders he received from the king were confused and contradictory. Oquendo, the Spanish admiral, and Tromp had both, in fact, appealed to King Charles, who, hardly pressed for money by reason of the Scottish war, hoped to make some advantage out of one or the other, but was unable to decide which would pay the better; and before he could make up his mind, Tromp, probably on a hint from Richelieu, took the matter into his own hands, and on 11 October, having been joined by large reinforcements from Holland, attacked the Spanish fleet, drove many of their ships on shore, pursued those that fled, and captured or sank the greater part. Penington, meantime, was powerless; he had no instructions to take part with either, and was disinclined to risk the total loss of his fleet by defending the Spaniards. It may, indeed, be doubted if his fleet would have obeyed him had he attempted to do so, for the popular opinion was that the Spanish fleet was there on the invitation of Charles, and that the troops it carried were to be landed to help in crushing English liberties. For the deliverance from this fancied danger the nation was grateful to the Dutch; but that Penington had had no hand in it, and had appeared rather as a supporter of the Spaniards, was probably remembered against him when, in July 1642, the parliament, after vainly protesting against the king's appointment of Penington as Lord High Admiral, ordered the Earl of Warwick to take command of the fleet and not to allow Penington on board. The hesitation in the fleet when Warwick assumed the command was largely nominal (resistance being confined to five captains, of whom three promptly submittedMay and Maseres, History of the Parliament of England (1812), at page 137), and, with Penington's rejection, the navy declared itself on the side of the parliament. That the popular feeling mistrusted Penington was evident. Clarendon says that 'he was a very honest gentleman, and of unshaken faithfulness and integrity to the king;' and though the lords 'pretended that they had many things to object against him, the greatest was that he had conveyed the Lord Digby over sea, though they well knew that for that he had the king's warrant'. But in fact the objection was that throughout his whole career he had shown himself to the people as preferring the will of the king to the welfare of the nation or even his own honour. Older sources claim that Penington played a negligible role in the Civil War, a titular Lord High Admiral of England without any fleet to command. In fact, Penington soon took command of a revived Royalist navy as Admiral of the Fleet. After the capture of Bristol in July 1643, eighteen Royal Navy ships joined the king's cause, supported by hired merchant ships, privateers, and troop-transports. Admiral Sir John Penington remained in active command of King Charles's navy until at least May 1645.Lynch, John (2009) Bristol and the Civil War: For King and Parliament. The History Press. =Death= One Royalist chronicler says that Penington died in Bristol in September 1646, long after its fall to the Parliament forces. Some modern sources, however, say he died at the family seat of Muncaster in North-East England. What is clear that his will was proved 28 May 1648. Penington was unmarried, and left legacies to various relatives; among others, his 'Great Heart diamond ring' to his cousin William Pennington of Muncaster, who became ancestor of the barons of Muncaster.

Based on Gardner's play of the same name, the film focuses on Nat Moyer, a cantankerous left-wing Jew, and Midge Carter, an African-American man, who spend their days sitting on a bench, trying to mask the realities of aging, mainly through the tall tales that Nat spins. The film touches on several issues, including society's treatment of the aged, the difficulties dealing with adult children who think they know what's best for their parents, and the dangers that lurk in urban areas. Its title comes from an old vaudeville joke, a variation of which evolved into dialogue between the two protagonists. Plot In the park every morning, elderly, half-blind Midge Carter tries to read his newspaper, but is distracted daily by Nat Moyer, an opinionated old man who reminisces about long-ago union, socialist/communist activities and the love of his life. Midge is superintendent of a residential building and has been trying to steer clear of a tenant, Pete Danforth, whose committee is pushing for Midge's retirement. Nat insists that Midge stand up for his rights, going so far as to pass himself off as Midge's attorney. Nat's married daughter, Clara, is concerned about his welfare, particularly given how vulnerable a senior citizen can be in the park. She has good reason to worry because Nat encounters the Cowboy, a drug dealer who is owed money by a young woman named Laurie, and by J.C., a mugger who turns violent when Nat unwisely decides to fight back.

Reception Roger Ebert, who gave the film 2 and a half stars out of 4, felt that the film diverged too far from the play, writing that \\"if they'd stayed on the bench and just talked --talked for two solid hours--it might have been more successful. Instead, writer-director Herb Gardner loses faith in his original impulse and adds plot --way too much plot--to force the movie into more conventional channels.\\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/im-not-rappaport-1997 USA Today critic Andy Seiler wrote that \\"director Herb Gardner is a little too fond of writer Herb Gardner's script, which just keeps going and going and going -- until even two old pros such as Walter and Ossie have worn out their welcome.\\" The film has a 38% score on Rotten Tomatoes.

Plot  The concept of Ice from the Sun creates a third presence that disrupts the balance between Heaven and Hell. The Presence is a supernatural entity that rules a separate dimension surrounded by ice, where he brings imprisoned humans for eternal torture. The Presence had once been a human, but now commands omnipotent powers. A young woman who is in the midst of committing suicide is recruited by a coalition of angels and devils to infiltrate The Presence‚Äôs ice world as one of his prisoners for torture. Her goal is to get The Presence to recall his blocked memory of his human origins, which would allow his icy domain to melt and enable the angels and demons to destroy their common enemy.  Production and reception  Ice from the Sun was produced in the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area with a cast of local actors. Stanze used 193 rolls of Super 8 film (a total of 9,650 feet) to shoot the film. The film was released on DVD in 1999 by SRS Cinema, and it received strong reviews in the horror film media. Mac McIntire, writing for DVD Verdict, stated the film was ‚Äúrecommended for die hard horror fans looking for something way off the beaten path.‚Äù In 2001, the film received a theatrical release, where it was met with mixed reviews. Maitland McDonagh, writing for TV Guide Online, praised the film for being ‚Äúoften imaginative and surprisingly accomplished within the limits of its ultra-low budget.‚Äù However, Stephen Holden of The New York Times complained ‚Äúit is the kind of film that only a certain breed of cinematic cultist could tolerate.‚Äù Also, Michael Atkinson, writing in The Village Voice, stated the film was ‚Äúa furiously pointless punk-gore loogie that resets the bar on how wretched an amateur indulgence can be and still garner public screen time merely on the impression of being ‚Äòtransgressive.‚Äô‚Äù  References   External links  * *Ice from the Sun at Rotten Tomatoes *Wicked Pixel Cinema's Official Website Category:1999 horror films Category:1999 films ","title":"Ice from the Sun"},{"id":"18152201","text":"√âric Srecki (born 2 July 1964 in B√©thune, Pas-de-Calais) is a French fencer and Olympic and World champion in the √©p√©e competition.

Griggs previously served two terms in the Massachusetts House of Representatives'Acts and Resolves Passed By The General Court of Massachusetts,' Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts: 1857,pg. 805 before moving to Champaign County, Illinois in 1859. He also enlisted and served as a sutler in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Griggs was extremely influential in the decision to locate the Illinois Industrial University, which would later become the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. He started with $40,000 appropriated by the Supervisors of Champaign and Urbana Townships and traveled throughout Illinois meeting with elected officials. In a period of five weeks, he had met with 40 Members of the Illinois House, 15 of which pledged their support. Griggs then met with the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and the Chairmen of the state Democratic and Republican parties. For a period of 3 months after the General Assembly went into session in 1867 Griggs maintained a reception room and suite of parlors and bedrooms at the Leland Hotel in Springfield, where legislators and their constituents were entertained with drinks, light refreshments, or dinners of oyster or quail. Legislators were also supplied with cigars and theater tickets. Griggs further arranged for a special train to take legislators to Champaign-Urbana late in the session. He then ran for Speaker; and after a two-day period of repeated voting, he agreed to drop out of the race in exchange for the Chairmanship of the Committee on Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, the committee that would hear all bills regarding the location of the university, and the right to choose the committee's members. Griggs called the committee to order several times, while privately telling the members not to attend; and when asked why legislation regarding the location of the university was not being heard in the committee, Griggs replied that he had called the committee to order but had been unable to achieve a quorum. Legislation eventually reached the House floor naming Champaign as the site of the new university. Separate motions were made to amend the bill, the first substituting Jacksonville, the second Normal, and the third Lincoln. (Illinois State Normal University, which was nationally admired and would later become Illinois State University, had already been established in Normal 10 years prior‚Äîin 1857.) All three motions to amend failed, the measure was approved by the House and Senate; and Governor Richard James Oglesby signed the bill into law three days later. See also *Clark R.

Some of them, the major tributaries of Paraguay and Parana, enabled navigation on a small scale, and smaller boats with limited use in times of drought due to decreasing flow of water flows.  Tributaries of the Paraguay and Parana rivers  = Paraguay river tributaries = Ribera del Rio Paraguay Among the subsidiaries of the left bank of the Paraguay River are:  The Jejui River  The Jejui River covers an area of approximately 350 km. It receives water from rivers Jejui-mi and the Jejui Guaz√∫, in addition to substantial influx of the Aguaray River. Near its emerging flow together the Curuguaty River and the stream Itanar√°. Historically it had strategic importance for Portuguese colonists, who continuously attempted to control this communication channel providing access to the Paraguay River, which was a fast way to reach the gold mines of Cuyab√°. The whole area surrounding the river was committed to defending the sovereignty of Paraguay in the delicate dispute with Portugal for the possession of the region that produced mate herb in Igatim√≠. The town of Curuguaty is accessed by the Jejui River, when the water level allowed it. The overland journey from Asunci√≥n consumed much time because of the distance and natural difficulties of crossing jungles and rivers. This town, like others in remote parts of the country, suffered from a sharp isolation. For that reason Curuguaty was chosen by the dictator Jos√© Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia as a place of imprisonment of the Uruguayan leader General Jose Gervasio Artigas when he applied for asylum in Paraguay.  Navigation  The river maintained in the past a greater flow by the regularity of rain and humidity sustained by its extensive forests. Until the middle of twentieth century it was common to observe in its lower reaches, the transit of boats transporting hardwoods and mate. In the boom of the mate herb production there was a constant movement of small-size boats coming up ports of Itaba and Ysa√∫. The first was a major point of embarkation of mate, belonging to the powerful Paraguayan Industrial Company, established shortly after the Paraguayan War. The river's opening, close to 24 degrees south latitude, was an active meeting place for traders engaged in the provision of goods for crews of boats and residents of neighboring villages. There workers spent their meager assets after they had worked for long months. There were piles of firewood in the canyons of the river‚Äîbasic material for the operation of boilers and steam plants‚Äîand thousands of rolls of hardwood accumulated waiting to be shipped to ports below. The loss of coastal mountains filled up the river's banks with wastes and this decreased the depth of its waters. Later, the construction of overland routes produced, moreover, the abandonment of this route as a means of communication.  The Manduvir√° River  A similar phenomenon occurred with the Manduvir√° River of 212 km long. arises in the Cordillera de los Altos and moves from east to west. For many years this was the alternative to reach isolated villages like Arroyos y Esteros. At the port of this population came small motor boats engaged in trade of national fruits and passengers transport. The Manduvir√° ends in the Paraguay River, a short distance from Asunci√≥n, destiny of passengers and pedestrians who accompanied their loads of fruit, tobacco and alcohol.  Tebicuary River  The Tebicuary River drains at 23¬∫30' south latitude. Long ago, such rivers served as communication between the area of √ëeembuc√∫ and the inland territories inside the old Jesuit missions. Through this river, smaller vessels entered to transport goods from Argentina, especially from Corrientes. They reached the passage of Santa Maria, current Villa Florida, where strong commercial firms were established. These firms engaged in distributing their merchandise to a variety of peoples. On their return, these boats carried cotton and firewood to the city of Pilar. The first study of its geography was done by the Spanish naturalist F√©lix de Azara, who wrote a booklet on the details of the expedition conducted by his aides. The water channel suffered the same deterioration, as a result of the misuse of their sources and adjacent wetlands. = The principal Paran√° River tributary =  The Monday River  Among the tributaries of the Paran√° River, the Monday River is significant, with an area of 170 km. This river rises in the mountains of Caaguaz√∫ and poured water on the right bank of Paran√° River, a short distance from the mouth of the River Iguazu. There are recent references that flatboats and tugboats transported mate and wood in the short journey between the Caaguaz√∫ jungle factories. These were close to the famous Saltos del Monday, that ended in the Paran√° River, where cargo was transferred to larger capacity ships.

This is often accomplished by the use of a special safety cap. It is required by regulation for prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, Nicotine Containing Electronic Cigarette devices or Refill containers that can contain Nicotine EUTPD 36.7 pesticides, and household chemicals. In some jurisdictions, unit packaging such as blister packs is also regulated for child safety. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has stated in a press release that \\"There is no such thing as child-proof packaging. So you shouldn't think of packaging as your primary line of defense. Rather, you should think of packaging, even child-resistant packaging, as your last line of defense.\\" Background The child-resistant locking closure for containers was invented in 1967 by Dr. Henri Breault. A history of accidents involving children opening household packaging and ingesting the contents led the United States Congress to pass the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970, authored by U.S. Senator Frank E. Moss of Utah. This gave the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission the authority to regulate this area. Additions throughout the decades have increased the initial coverage to include other hazardous items, including chemicals regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency. Accidental child poisonings continue. Coordination exists for improving international standards on requirements and protocols. Difficulty opening Child-resistant packaging can be a problem for some aged individuals or people with disabilities. Regulations require designs to be tested to verify that most adults can access the package. Some jurisdictions allow pharmacists to provide medications in non-CR packages when there are no children in the same house. Requirements The regulations are based on protocols of performance tests of packages with actual children, to determine if the packages can be opened. More recently, additional package testing is used to determine if aged individuals or people with disabilities have the ability to open the same packages. Often the CR requirements are met by package closures which require two dissimilar motions for opening. Hundreds of package designs are available for packagers to consider.

Hooper, 1773. p. 24 Early 1630s Weston decided to copy the canal and lock system then prevalent in The Netherlands to make the River Wey navigable between Weybridge and Guildford. He was appointed one of the Royal Commissioners to oversee the work in 1635. During the English Civil War (1642‚Äì1651), his property was sequestrated and he took himself into exile. In 1644 he visited Ghent, Bruges and Antwerp and took the opportunity to study agricultural methods in use there. By 1649 he was back in England and instigated a bill in parliament to authorise the construction of the navigation which became an Act of Parliament in 1651. Weston immediately set to work on construction, although he died before the scheme reached completion. One of his first agricultural schemes was to increase the hay yield, by introducing a new strain of hay and by irrigation schemes. He also introduced from Flanders a crop rotation scheme based on clover, flax and turnips. In 1645 he had written an account of Flemish husbandry which formed the basis of the \\"Discours\\" which was published in various versions in 1651 and 1652. Weston died aged 61 and was buried at Trinity Chapel Guildford. He married Grace Harper of Cheshunt and by her had seven sons and two daughters.  Work  = Canal building = Sir Richard Weston was the first to introduce, at any rate into the Surrey district, the system, long prevalent in Holland, of rendering rivers and canals navigable by means of locks. He attempted by this means to make the River Wey navigable from Guildford to its junction with the Thames at Weybridge. In 1635 he was appointed one of the royal commissioners for the prosecution of the work. It was perhaps the expenditure necessitated by his canal scheme which forced him in 1641 to sell Temple Court Farm at Merrow, with the mansion at West Clandon, to Sir Richard Onslow, M.P. for Surrey in the Long parliament. River Wey Navigation of 1653. In 1649 Weston entered into an agreement with Major James Pitson, commissioner for Surrey under the parliament, that the latter should solicit the discharge of his sequestration and forward his schemes for rendering the Wey navigable. Accordingly, a petition was presented in the name of Pitson and the corporation of Guildford. A bill authorising the works was brought into the House of Commons on 26 Dec. 1650, and passed as an act on 26 June 1651. The capital was 6,000l., of which Sir Richard was to find half, undertaking at the same time to complete the canal within six months. Sir Richard set to work at once with great energy, employing two hundred men at a time, and using timber of his own to the value of 2,000l. Materials and timber were also taken, by permission of the parliament, from the king's estates of Oatlands and Richmond. Weston died within less than a year of the passing of the act, but he had so far expedited the work that ten out of the fourteen miles were completed, though at an expenditure much exceeding the original estimate. The work was carried on after his death by his son and Major Pitson, and the canal was opened in November 1653. The completed canal had ten locks, four weirs, and twelve bridges; but, though it produced a large revenue, it involved the family in litigation, which, when finally settled in 1671, had more than swallowed up all the profits. At the Restoration an impudent attempt was made by a certain John Radcliffe to get into his own hands the management of the canal. A committee of the House of Commons which sat to investigate his claims came to the conclusion that \\"Sir Richard Weston was the designer of the navigation, and they were satisfied that Mr. [John] Weston's estate was left to him encumbered by reason of his father undertaking the navigation.\\" = Agricultural improvements = Even more important than Sir Richard Weston's canal schemes were his agricultural improvements. He tells us himself that \\"at the time he went out of England\\" he had had \\"thirtie years\\" experience in husbandrie\\" and had \\"improved his land as much as any man in this kingdom hath done.\\" It was probably Sir Richard Weston who about this time introduced into Surrey \\"the grass called Nonesuch,\\" and we know that, following on the track of Rowland Vaughan, he raised rich crops of hay from irrigated meadowsManning and Bray, History of Surrey. Sir Richard's irrigated meadows are referred to by a contemporary writer: :Because hay is dear in those parts this year, near three pound a load, Sir Richard Weston told me he sold at near that rate one hundred and fifty loads of his extraordinary hay which his meadows watered with his new river did yield.Adolphus Speed, Adam out of Eden, 1659. Speed also refers to another improvement of Sir Richard's, the most characteristic of all: his introduction of a new system of crop rotation founded on the cultivation of clover, flax, and turnips. This Sir Richard brought from Flanders, where he had noticed its practice during his exile. A full account of the Flemish husbandry, written about 1645, he had addressed to his sons from abroad. This seems to have been circulated in manuscript, but there is no evidence that it was ever printed until 1650, when an imperfect copy was published by Samuel Hartlib, with a dedication to the council of state, and with the date 1605 (evidently a mistake for 1650, and so corrected in manuscript in many copies). Hartlib did not at this time know who the author was. Subsequently, on 2 May 1651, and again on 10 Oct. of the same year, Hartlib wrote to Sir Richard, whom he had been \\"credibly informed\\" was the author of the \\"Discours,\\" asking him for some further information on the subject of clover cultivation, and requesting him to ‚Äòmake compleat and sufficiently enlarged‚Äô for the benefit of all \\"his former treatise.\\" As Sir Richard took no notice, Hartlib republished the pamphlet in 1652 from a more correct copy, adding transcripts of his two letters to Sir Richard. Hartlib's \\"Legacy of Husbandry\\" (a collection of anonymous notes on agricultural matters written by Robert Child, Cressy Dymock, and others, which Hartlib edited and published at the same time as he pirated Sir Richard's work) has sometimes been erroneously attributed to Sir Richard Weston. This error would not need comment were it not for the fact that in 1742 one T. Harris published a very incorrect copy of this \\"Legacy,\\" which he attributed to Sir Richard Weston, and then proceeded to support this assertion by foisting Sir Richard's name into the text. = Discourse on the Husbandry of Brabant and Flanders, 1645 = In Weston‚Äôs Discourse on the Husbandry of Brabant and Flanders, published by Hartlib in 1645, we may mark the dawn of the vast improvements which have since been effected in Britain. Weston had the merit of being the first who introduced the great clover, as it was then called, into England agriculture, about 1645, and probably turnips also.A. Constable (1823) Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: Or, A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Miscellaneous Literature, Enlarged and Improved Lemma \\"Agriculture, history\\", p. 297 His directions for the cultivation of clover are better than was to be expected. It thrives best, he says, when you sow it on the worst and barrenest ground, such as our worst heath ground is in England. The ground is to be pared and burnt, and unslacked lime must be added to the ashes. It is next to be well ploughed and harrowed; and about ten pounds of clover seed must be sown on an acre in April or the end of March. If you intended to preserve seed, then the second crop must be let stand till it come to a full and dead ripeness, and you shall have at the least five bushels per acre. Being once sown, it will last five years; and then being ploughed, it will yield, three or four years together, rich crops of wheat, and after that a crop of oats, with which clover seed is to be sown again. It is in itself an excellent manure, Weston adds; and so it should be, to enable land to bear this treatment. In less than ten years after its introduction, that is, before 1655, the culture of clover, exactly according to the present method, seems to have been well known in England, and it had also made its way to Ireland.

Plot  Don Geiss, the chairman of General Electric (GE), challenges Jack and his rivals to come up with an idea to make money \\"from this environmentalism trend.\\" This leads to him casting an actor called Jared to play Greenzo, NBC's environmental mascot. Initially, Greenzo is a success, making a well received appearance on The Today Show with Meredith Vieira. Eventually, he becomes more and more self-absorbed and starts insulting the TGS staff and criticizing the staff's environmentally unfriendly habits. This is until he conducts a second interview, when he begins ranting negatively about \\"big companies and their two-faced, fat cat executives,\\" referring to GE and Jack. Angered, Jack fires Jared and tries tricking Al Gore into replacing him to no avail. Also, a drunken Greenzo shows up and tries to continue only to mess things up even more. When a large globe ignites, Liz says \\"The Earth is broken. We need another.\\" Meanwhile, Kenneth is planning a party. Knowing this, Liz recounts past parties of Kenneth's to Tracy, telling him that she was the only other person who attended those parties. Feeling pity for Kenneth, Tracy tells the biggest gossips on TGS with Tracy Jordan, Grizz and Dot Com (Grizz Chapman and Kevin Brown), that T.I. will be attending. They persuade other people to attend by telling various other lies. The resulting party is so outrageous that Kenneth decides never to throw a party again.

The series follows the adventures of four young men (The Monkees) trying to make a name for themselves as a rock 'n roll band. The show introduced a number of innovative new-wave film techniques to series television and won two Emmy Awards in 1967, including Outstanding Comedy Series. The program ended in 1968 at the finish of its second season and has received a long afterlife through Saturday morning repeats (CBS and ABC) and syndication, as well as overseas broadcasts. It later enjoyed a 1980s revival, after MTV aired reruns of the program in 1986. It has aired on Sunday afternoons on MeTV since February 24, 2019, three days after the death of Peter Tork. Overview The series centered on the adventures of the Monkees, a struggling rock band from Los Angeles, California consisting of Micky, Davy, Michael, and Peter. The comic elements of the storyline were provided by the strange and often surreal encounters that the band would have while searching for their big break. Production =Conception and casting= In the early 1960s, aspiring filmmakers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider had formed Raybert Productions and were trying to get a foot in the door in Hollywood. They were inspired by the Beatles' film A Hard Day's Night and decided to develop a television series about a fictional rock and roll group.Lefcowitz (1985), pp.6‚Äì7 Raybert sold the series idea to Screen Gems in April, 1965,Sandoval (2005), p.23 and Paul Mazursky and Larry Tucker completed a pilot script by August entitled \\"The Monkeys\\".Sandoval (2005), p.25 Rafelson has said that he had the idea for a TV series about a music group as early as 1960, but had a hard time interesting anyone in it until 1965, by which time rock and roll music was firmly entrenched in pop culture. Trade publications Daily Variety and The Hollywood Reporter ran an ad on September 8, 1965 seeking \\"Folk & Roll Musicians-Singers for acting roles in new TV series.\\" As many as 400 hopefuls showed up to be considered as one of \\"4 insane boys.\\"Sandoval (2005), p.26 Fourteen actors from the audition pool were brought back for screen tests,Documents reproduced in booklet of VHS box set, Rhino Records, 1995 and Raybert chose their final four after audience research. Micky Dolenz, son of screen actor George Dolenz, had prior screen experience under the name \\"Mickey Braddock\\" as the 10-year- old star of the Circus Boy series in the 1950s. He was actively auditioning for pilots at the time and was told about the Raybert project by his agent. Englishman Davy Jones was a former jockey who had achieved some initial success on the musical stage, appearing with the cast of Oliver! on The Ed Sullivan Show the night of the Beatles' live American debut. He was appearing in Columbia Pictures productions and recording for the Colpix record label and had been identified in advance as a potential star for the series. Texan Michael Nesmith's mother Bette Nesmith Graham had invented a correction fluid and founded the company that became Liquid Paper. He had served a brief stint in the U.S. Air Force and had also recorded for Colpix under the name \\"Michael Blessing.\\" He was the only one of The Monkees who had come for the audition based on seeing the trade magazine ad. He showed up to the audition with his laundry and impressed Rafelson and Schneider with his laid-back style and droll sense of humor. He also wore a woollen hat to keep his hair out of his eyes when he rode his motorcycle,Baker (1986), p.10 leading to early promotional materials which nicknamed him \\"Wool Hat.\\" The hat remained part of Nesmith's wardrobe, but the name was dropped after the pilot. Peter Tork was recommended to Rafelson and Schneider by friend Stephen Stills at his audition. Tork was a skilled multi-instrumentalist who had performed at various Greenwich Village folk clubs before moving west, where he worked as a busboy. =Development= The Monkees in the Spring of 1966, shortly after production for the first season had begun Rafelson and Schneider wanted the style of the series to reflect avant garde film techniques‚Äîsuch as improvisation, quick cuts, jump cuts, breaking the fourth wall, and free- flowing, loose narratives‚Äîthen being pioneered by European film directors. Each episode would contain at least one musical \\"romp\\" which might have nothing to do with the storyline. In retrospect, these vignettes now look very much like music videos: short, self-contained films of songs whose style echoed the Beatles' recent ventures into promotional films for their singles. Rafelson and Schneider also believed strongly in the program's ability to appeal to young people, intentionally framing the kids as heroes and the adults as heavies.Lefcowitz (1985), p.3 Rafelson and Schneider hired novice director James Frawley to teach the four actors improvisational comedy. Each of the four was given a different personality to portray: Dolenz the funny one, Nesmith the smart and serious one, Tork the naive one, and Jones the cute one. Their characters were loosely based on their real selves, with the exception of Tork, who was actually a quiet intellectual. The character types also had much in common with the respective personalities of the Beatles, with Dolenz representing the madcap attitude of John Lennon, Nesmith affecting the deadpan seriousness of George Harrison, Tork depicting the odd-man-out quality of Ringo Starr, and Jones conveying the pin-up appeal of Paul McCartney. A pilot episode was shot in San Diego and Los Angeles on a shoestring budget‚Äîin many scenes the Monkees wore their own clothes. Initial audience tests (which were just then being pioneered) produced very low responses. Rafelson then re- edited the pilot and included some of the screen tests, to better introduce the band members to viewers. (Dolenz was credited in this pilot as \\"Micky Braddock.\\") The re-cut pilot tested so well that NBC placed an order for two seasons of episodes. (The edited pilot was broadcast November 14, 1966, as the tenth episode of the first season, with Dolenz credited under his real last name, as for all other episodes.) =Filming= The Monkees debuted September 12, 1966, on the NBC television network. The series was sponsored on alternate weeks by Kellogg's Cereals and Yardley of London. The series was filmed by Screen Gems, and many of the same sets and props from The Three Stooges short films made by the studio were used on The Monkees: A pair of pajamas with a bunny design on the front that had been worn by Curly Howard in shorts such as Cactus Makes Perfect and In the Sweet Pie and Pie were the same ones worn by Peter Tork in various episodes such as \\"A Coffin Too Frequent\\" and \\"Monkee See, Monkee Die\\".The Three Stooges Journal, Fall 1987; published by the Three Stooges Fan Club To reduce noise on the set during filming, any of the four Monkees who was not needed in front of the cameras was locked into a converted meat locker.https://www.womansworld.com/posts/the-monkees-behind-the- scenes-169766 In DVD commentary, Tork noted that this had the added benefit of concealing any marijuana use that might be going on, although he admitted that he was the sole \\"serious 'head'\\" of the four of them. (In the 1980s, Tork gave up alcohol and marijuana use and had volunteered time to help people recovering from alcoholism.) In a studio outtake included in the 1990s re- release of Headquarters, Nesmith quips, before launching into \\"Nine Times Blue\\": \\"Only difference between me and Peter is I'm just stone legal.\\"http://www.angelfire.com/ne/bootsiepages/mikequotes.html Due to the loosely scripted nature of the series, some episodes would come in too short for air. The producers decided to fill time with various \\"extras\\", including the Monkees' original screen tests and candid interviews with the group (conducted by Rafelson off-camera); these interviews usually lasted one minute, hence the frequent joke, \\"We're a minute short as usual,\\" though the episode \\"Find the Monkees\\" featured a three-minute epilogue interview (in which the Monkees gave their opinions on the then-recently occurred Sunset Strip curfew riots). Although the early episodes contained a laugh track, which was standard practice at the time, the show eventually did not add one, and most of the episodes from Season 2 had no canned laughter. NBC later cited that as one of the reasons for the waning popularity and eventual cancellation of the series.Iverson, Paul: \\"The Advent of the Laugh Track\\" Hofstra University archives; February 1994. =Music= The theme song to The Monkees, \\"(Theme from) The Monkees\\" (released as the single in some countries in 1967), is one of the group's most well known songs. The line \\"We're the young generation, and we've got somethin' to say\\" reflected the new youth counterculture and their desire to give their own opinions on world events and choosing how to live their own lives instead of abiding by the traditions and beliefs of their elders. For the second season, the show used a version of the song \\"For Pete's Sake\\" as the closing theme, which appeared on the Monkees' Headquarters album. The Monkees' \\"pad\\" The Monkees resided in a two-story beach house. The address varied in different episodes. * 1334 Beechwood in ‚ÄúYour Friendly Neighborhood Kidnappers‚Äù * 1424 ???, Malibu, California, in ‚ÄúToo Many Girls‚Äù * 1438 North Beechwood according to Davy in ‚ÄúThe Case of the Missing Monkee‚Äù * 1334 North Beechwood Drive, Hollywood, California, according to the telegram in Head The address 1334 North Beechwood Drive, Hollywood, California, was frequently given in 16 magazine as an address to contact Screen Gems and/or The Monkees. The front of the first floor was a combination of the living room, dining room and kitchen. In the back, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, was an alcove formed by massive floor-to-ceiling bay windows, where the Monkees kept their instruments and rehearsed songs. The walls were covered with various kitschy signs and posters, such as the \\"MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL\\" sign near the kitchen, the \\"SCRUB UP\\" sign above the kitchen sink, and the \\"IN CASE OF FIRE, RUN\\" sign with an arrow pointing to an old- fashioned fire extinguisher near the front door. There were also two doors in the kitchen area; one led to a bathroom, the other to Davy and Peter's bedroom. The second floor (via spiral staircase near the front door) only consisted of Micky and Mike's bedroom. By the second season, the upstairs bedroom was occupied by all four Monkees. Also \\"residing\\" with the Monkees was Mr. Schneider, a mannequin who dispensed philosophical advice with the pull of his cord. Mr. Schneider was named after the show's co-producer Bert Schneider and was mostly voiced by main director James Frawley. During Season One, the boys also had to contend with their bad-tempered landlord Mr. Babbit, who was always yelling at them about various infractions that he thought they were responsible for or threatening to throw them out for not paying the rent. Monkeemobile The Monkeemobile. The Monkeemobile was a modified Pontiac GTO designed and built by designer Dean Jeffries. The car featured a tilted forward split two-piece windshield, a touring car T-bucket-type convertible top, modified rear quarter panels and front fenders, exaggerated tail lamps, set of four bucket seats with an extra third row bench where the rear deck should have been, and a parachute. The front grille sported the GTO emblem.St. Antoine, Arthur. - \\"Interview: Dean Jeffries, Hollywood legend\\". - Motor Trend MagazineKeefe, Don. - \\"The History of the MonkeeMobile\\" . - Pontiac Enthusiast Magazine. - (c/o monkees.net) - 1997 Awards and nominations The Monkees won two Emmy Awards in 1967: Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy (James Frawley, for the episode \\"Royal Flush\\"). Frawley was nominated for the same award the following season (for the episode \\"The Devil and Peter Tork\\"). Its win for Comedy Series was considered somewhat of an upset, as it bested long-time favorites The Andy Griffith Show, Bewitched, Get Smart, and Hogan's Heroes. Decline and cancellation For its first season (1966-1967), the series fared well in the television ratings bolstered by several hit records by the band. The Monkees became a huge pop culture sensation. However, the public did not realize the show and the band were just a regularly produced television series and the Monkees characters did not write or perform their own studio music except to provide the vocals. The only exception were their live performances. When the truth became known, there was considerable backlash from many fans and music critics. Liner notes for a 2006 re-release of More of the Monkees also noted that the album sales had consistently outperformed the TV show's Nielsen ratings; more were listening to the Monkees than watching The Monkees on TV. The west coast American recording industry had many session musicians under contract performing for many musical acts, such as the Wrecking Crew that recorded for the Monkees and many other music groups of this era so this was nothing new. However, NBC responded to the criticism, and internal tensions, by retooling the show in its second season with the Monkees now writing and performing much of their own music that was much less pop-oriented. Moreover, Don Kirshner, the producer for the Monkees for their first season and responsible for their first smash hits, was terminated by Colgems Records, resulting in a much less bubblegum rock sound for the band. In addition, the first season's clean cut looks were replaced by more hippy looking attire. By 1967, both NBC and the band felt the series had run its course, as even with the changes, the formulaic premises of each episode were beginning to repeat themselves. The series was cancelled in 1968, with the band afforded the right to write their own series finale. The series finale, Dolenz's original story \\"The Frodis Caper,\\" was written as a satire of the industry and a parting shot thereto: an evil eye resembling the CBS logo is hypnotizing television viewers everywhere, and the Monkees trace it to an alien plant being manipulated by a villain seeking world domination. When the plant emits smoke, it pacifies the villain, the meaning of which Dolenz stated he would leave to the imagination of the viewer. Tim Buckley, as a special guest, closes out the series with his \\"Song to the Siren.\\" Had the series been renewed for a third season, the Monkees had planned on abandoning the sitcom format and retooling the series. Ideas that had been bandied about included a music-centered live show, a variety show or a sketch comedy series. In 1968, The Monkees starred in their own motion picture titled Head. Elements of the series were included in the film. The film did poorly at the box office and criticism was mostly mixed. Syndication The Monkees enjoyed a resurgence on Saturday morning/afternoon television on CBS from September 1969 to September 1972 (sponsored by General Foods' Kool-Aid), and on ABC from September 1972 to August 1973. To coincide with the releases of The Monkees Present and Changes albums during this time period, many episodes replaced the older songs with tracks from these recent releases.monkeestv.tripod.com (This strategy was also employed during the summer of 1967, when many of the first-season episodes had their songs from the first two albums replaced with songs from the then-current single and from the third album Headquarters.) The 58 episodes were then sold to local markets for syndication in September 1975, where they typically appeared on independent television stations on weekday afternoons (the opening title sequence seen in the syndication package, for all 58 episodes, is from the second season of the original run). A second, massive resurgence occurred when a Monkees marathon aired on February 23, 1986 on MTV. Within months, the 58 episodes were airing regularly throughout the United States on local stations (in edited form), Nickelodeon/MTV (uncut), as well as Canada on MuchMusic. Dolenz, Tork and Jones, already reunited for a \\"20th Anniversary Tour\\", went from playing small clubs to stadiums as the series caught on, and the tour drew critical praise. The popularity led Columbia Pictures to create a \\"reboot\\" version of the franchise in 1987, New Monkees, but it flopped and was cancelled after a half season. The series has aired edited versions on Antenna TV, a digital subchannel network that broadcasts classic programming from the 1950s-1990s era. IFC also picked up the series for reruns in spring 2015. FETV, a cable and satellite network, began airing the series in December 2017. In 2018, Canadian superstation CHCH began carrying the series; the station is viewable over-the-air in portions of the United States. As of March 3, 2019, restored episodes of The Monkees will air on MeTV on Sundays at 5 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. after following an overwhelming response to Peter Tork's death after MeTV aired two episodes on February 24, as a tribute to the late Monkee. Rhino Records now serves as the underlying rights holder for this series, as they acquired the Monkees' music catalog, TV series and official logo from Raybert and Columbia Pictures in 1994. Sony Pictures Television, which has owned Columbia Pictures since 1989, remains the television distributor for syndication. Legacy The TV show Miami 7, the debut of the British 1990s pop band S Club 7, had a very similar premise. It was the second time that a manufactured band had their own TV show on American television. Likewise, the Nickelodeon sitcom Big Time Rush followed the same basic format and premise, and producers of that show acknowledged The Monkees as their primary inspiration.Martin, Denise. \\"Child's Play.\\" Los Angeles Times. November 22, 2009. Dolenz said in a 2007 interview on the Roe Conn radio program that, while inspiration did come from the Beatles, the band's image was not meant to be a rip-off of them. He said that the Beatles were always depicted as superstars with legions of fans, whereas the Monkees were always depicted as unsigned and struggling to make a buck. This is reflected numerous times throughout the series, such as in the pilot where Mike Nesmith is seen throwing darts at a Beatles poster, and in the episode \\"Find the Monkees (The Audition)\\" where the Monkees struggle to see a famous television producer who is looking for a rock act for use in commercial advertisements; in the episode \\"I Was a 99-Pound Weakling\\", Micky is tricked into signing onto a bogus weight-training program, but objects by noting, \\"Where am I gonna get that kind of money? I'm an unemployed drummer.\\" Also in a screen test, a Monkee asks what the Beatles have that they don't have. They sing \\"Thirteen million dollars!\\" When commenting on the death of Davy Jones on February 29, 2012, Time magazine contributor James Poniewozik praised the show: \\"Even if the show never meant to be more than entertainment and a hit-single generator, we shouldn‚Äôt sell The Monkees short. It was far better TV than it had to be; during an era of formulaic domestic sitcoms and wacky comedies, it was a stylistically ambitious show, with a distinctive visual style, absurdist sense of humor and unusual story structure. Whatever Jones and The Monkees were meant to be, they became creative artists in their own right, and Jones‚Äô chipper Brit-pop presence was a big reason they were able to produce work that was commercial, wholesome and yet impressively weird.\\" Home media Six two- episode VHS volumes of the television series were distributed by Musicvision/RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video between July 15, 1986 and June 25, 1987, taking advantage of the group's twentieth anniversary. On October 17, 1995, with the Monkees' 30th anniversary looming, Rhino Home Video issued the complete series as a deluxe VHS boxed set, containing all 58 episodes, plus the pilot and the 1969 special, 33‚Öì Revolutions Per Monkee, in a total of 21 videotapes, along with a specially created full-color photo book that tells the history of the series, information of each episode and a variety of photographs from the series. First-run issues of the set also included a limited-edition wristwatch. A few months before, on May 22, Columbia House started releasing a Collector's Edition series also collecting all 58 Monkees episodes and the 1969 special; the one exception being the unaired 1965 Monkees pilot, which was available only on Rhino's Video Box Set. Rhino later released individual two-episode VHS volumes of the TV series between March 26, 1996 and April 11, 2000; it would be the last time The Monkees television show would be distributed on videocassette. In May and November 2003, Rhino Entertainment Company (under its Rhino Retrovision classic TV entertainment brand) released the first two seasons of the original television series on DVD. Seasons 1 and 2 were each released separately, six DVDs for Season 1 and five DVDs for Season 2. Both seasons were re-released by Eagle Rock Entertainment on Sept. 27, 2011. In honor of The Monkees' 50th anniversary, Rhino released the complete series on Blu-ray on July 8, 2016, after a two- week delay.New (and 'Final'!)

Born in Fairfield, Alabama, and raised in Pittsburg, California, Malmberg batted and threw right-handed, stood (185 cm) tall and weighed 170 pounds (77 kg) during his active career. Malmberg spent only three seasons at the Major League level during a 29-year career in professional baseball. Originally a member of the Cleveland Indians farm system, he reached Triple-A with the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League in 1951, and spent the 11 of the next 12 years at the top level of the minors, toiling also for the Indianapolis Indians, Charleston Senators and Minneapolis Millers of the American Association, and the PCL's San Francisco Seals and Seattle Rainiers. The exception was the 1955 season, when Malmberg, turning age 30, spent a full season for the Detroit Tigers, appearing in 67 games, and compiling a batting average of .216 with five doubles, two triples, no home runs and 19 runs batted in. Malmberg played in the Boston Red Sox farm system in 1957‚Äì58, and rejoined it when the Red Sox took over as the Seattle Rainiers' parent club in 1961. Malmberg served as a playing coach for Rainiers manager Johnny Pesky, who was promoted to pilot of the Red Sox following the season. Malmberg followed Pesky to Boston as his first-base coach for the 1963 and 1964 seasons. After Pesky's firing at the end of 1964, Malmberg embarked on an 11-year minor league managerial career in the Baltimore Orioles, Kansas City Royals and Oakland Athletics organizations. He managed teams in the Class A California League, Florida State League and Carolina League, the Double-A Eastern League and Southern League, and the Triple-A American Association. He won two league championships (in 1965 and 1971) and retired after the 1975 campaign with a career managerial mark of 744 wins and 783 defeats (.487). When the Seattle Mariners were formed as an American League expansion team set to begin play in , Malmberg was appointed the club's first third-base coach on the staff of manager Darrell Johnson. But Malmberg was suffering from terminal pancreatic cancer and he died in San Francisco at age 51, five months before the Mariners played their first official game.Gorman, Lou, High and Inside: My Life in the Front Offices of Baseball.

Works of Jeremy Bentham, p. 192; excerpt, \\"... it is not a mere ipse dixit that will warrant us to give credit for utility to institutions, in which not the least trace of utility is discernible.\\" =Legal usage= In modern legal and administrative decisions, the term ipse dixit has generally been used as a criticism of arguments based solely upon the authority of an individual or organization. For example, in National Tire Dealers & Retreaders Association, Inc. v. Brinegar, 491 F.2d 31, 40 (D.C. Cir. 1974), Circuit Judge Wilkey considered that the Secretary of Transportation's \\"statement of the reasons for his conclusion that the requirements are practicable is not so inherently plausible that the court can accept it on the agency's mere ipse dixit\\". In 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized the problem of \\"opinion evidence which is connected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of an expert\\".Filan, citing General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 137; 118 S.Ct. 512; 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997). Likewise, the Texas Supreme Court has held \\"a claim will not stand or fall on the mere ipse dixit of a credentialed witness\\".\\"Burrow v. Arce,\\" 997 S.W.2d 229, 235 (Tex. 1999). In 1858, Abraham Lincoln said in his speech at Freeport, Illinois, at the second joint debate with Douglas: > I pass one or two points I have because my time will very soon expire, but I > must be allowed to say that Judge Douglas recurs again, as he did upon one > or two other occasions, to the enormity of Lincoln,‚Äîan insignificant > individual like Lincoln,‚Äî upon his ipse dixit charging a conspiracy upon a > large number of members of Congress, the Supreme Court, and two Presidents, > to nationalize slavery. I want to say that, in the first place, I have made > no charge of any sort upon my ipse dixit. I have only arrayed the evidence > tending to prove it, and presented it to the understanding of others, saying > what I think it proves, but giving you the means of judging whether it > proves it or not. This is precisely what I have done. I have not placed it > upon my ipse dixit at all.From The complete works of Abraham Lincoln, Vol. > III, pp. 290-291.

Eug√®ne Olivier was a Doctor of Science and Associate Professor of Anatomy. His father was also a physician. It was in his first year of non-resident medical studentship at the H√¥pital Saint-Louis (1901) that Eug√®ne Olivier started to acquire a grounding in surgery and anesthesia, under the supervision of professor Louis Ombr√©danne. He later on became deputy director of the Paris Faculty of Medicine surgical clinic (in 1912). In 1913, his thesis on the Topographical anatomy and surgery of the thymus was rewarded with the Godart Prize by the Paris Faculty of Medicine and the National Academy of Medicine. During World War I, he worked in a rehabilitation center and was appointed Chevalier de la L√©gion d'Honneur (Knight of the Legion of Honour) for military merits in 1919. He became a Doctor of Science and Associate Professor at the Faculty of Medicine (in anatomy) in 1923, after defending a thesis on The relationships between the thymus' morphology and its arterial vascularization. Head of the Paris Faculty anatomical works in 1939, he taught as a Professor of Anatomy from 1946 to 1952, thus taking over the post from Professor Henri Rouvi√®re. He was promoted Officier de la L√©gion d'Honneur (Officier of the Legion of Honour) by the Ministry of National Education (France) in 1939. He served as a medical expert for legal purposes and was a member of the Paris Society of Legal Medicine. He published significant works in the medical branch, such as his Treatise on human osteology, Anatomy of the head and neck, Anatomy of the abdomen and Anatomy of the thorax. These influential anatomical works granted him a free membership to the National Surgery Academy in 1953. He was the father of Gilbert Olivier, third president of the F√©d√©ration Sportive de France and director of the ESSEC Business School.

(Guest Eds.) (2009). \\"Special Issue: Foundations and Frontiers of Visual Analytics\\". in: Information Visualization, Volume 8, Number 4, Winter 2009 Page(s): 239-314. As a research agenda, visual analytics brings together several scientific and technical communities from computer science, information visualization, cognitive and perceptual sciences, interactive design, graphic design, and social sciences. Visual analytics integrates new computational and theory-based tools with innovative interactive techniques and visual representations to enable human- information discourse. The design of the tools and techniques is based on cognitive, design, and perceptual principles. This science of analytical reasoning provides the reasoning framework upon which one can build both strategic and tactical visual analytics technologies for threat analysis, prevention, and response. Analytical reasoning is central to the analyst‚Äôs task of applying human judgments to reach conclusions from a combination of evidence and assumptions. Visual analytics has some overlapping goals and techniques with information visualization and scientific visualization. There is currently no clear consensus on the boundaries between these fields, but broadly speaking the three areas can be distinguished as follows: * Scientific visualization deals with data that has a natural geometric structure (e.g., MRI data, wind flows). * Information visualization handles abstract data structures such as trees or graphs. * Visual analytics is especially concerned with coupling interactive visual representations with underlying analytical processes (e.g., statistical procedures, data mining techniques) such that high-level, complex activities can be effectively performed (e.g., sense making, reasoning, decision making). Visual analytics seeks to marry techniques from information visualization with techniques from computational transformation and analysis of data. Information visualization forms part of the direct interface between user and machine, amplifying human cognitive capabilities in six basic ways:Stuart Card, J.D. Mackinlay, and Ben Shneiderman (1999). \\"Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think\\". Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, San Francisco. # by increasing cognitive resources, such as by using a visual resource to expand human working memory, # by reducing search, such as by representing a large amount of data in a small space, # by enhancing the recognition of patterns, such as when information is organized in space by its time relationships, # by supporting the easy perceptual inference of relationships that are otherwise more difficult to induce, # by perceptual monitoring of a large number of potential events, and # by providing a manipulable medium that, unlike static diagrams, enables the exploration of a space of parameter values These capabilities of information visualization, combined with computational data analysis, can be applied to analytic reasoning to support the sense-making process.  Topics  = Scope = Visual analytics is a multidisciplinary field that includes the following focus areas: * Analytical reasoning techniques that enable users to obtain deep insights that directly support assessment, planning, and decision making * Data representations and transformations that convert all types of conflicting and dynamic data in ways that support visualization and analysis * Techniques to support production, presentation, and dissemination of the results of an analysis to communicate information in the appropriate context to a variety of audiences. * Visual representations and interaction techniquesA.

IEEE Computer Society Press. that take advantage of the human eye‚Äôs broad bandwidth pathway into the mind to allow users to see, explore, and understand large amounts of information at once. = Analytical reasoning techniques = Analytical reasoning techniques are the method by which users obtain deep insights that directly support situation assessment, planning, and decision making. Visual analytics must facilitate high-quality human judgment with a limited investment of the analysts‚Äô time. Visual analytics tools must enable diverse analytical tasks such as: * Understanding past and present situations quickly, as well as the trends and events that have produced current conditions * Identifying possible alternative futures and their warning signs * Monitoring current events for emergence of warning signs as well as unexpected events * Determining indicators of the intent of an action or an individual * Supporting the decision maker in times of crisis. These tasks will be conducted through a combination of individual and collaborative analysis, often under extreme time pressure. Visual analytics must enable hypothesis-based and scenario-based analytical techniques, providing support for the analyst to reason based on the available evidence. = Data representations = Data representations are structured forms suitable for computer-based transformations. These structures must exist in the original data or be derivable from the data themselves. They must retain the information and knowledge content and the related context within the original data to the greatest degree possible. The structures of underlying data representations are generally neither accessible nor intuitive to the user of the visual analytics tool. They are frequently more complex in nature than the original data and are not necessarily smaller in size than the original data. The structures of the data representations may contain hundreds or thousands of dimensions and be unintelligible to a person, but they must be transformable into lower-dimensional representations for visualization and analysis. = Theories of visualization = Theories of visualization include: * Jacques Bertin's Semiology of Graphics (1967) * Nelson Goodman's Languages of Art (1977) * Jock D. Mackinlay's Automated design of optimal visualization (APT) (1986) * Leland Wilkinson's Grammar of Graphics (1998) = Visual representations = Visual representations translate data into a visible form that highlights important features, including commonalities and anomalies. These visual representations make it easy for users to perceive salient aspects of their data quickly. Augmenting the cognitive reasoning process with perceptual reasoning through visual representations permits the analytical reasoning process to become faster and more focused.  Process  The input for the data sets used in the visual analytics process are heterogeneous data sources (i.e., the internet, newspapers, books, scientific experiments, expert systems). From these rich sources, the data sets S = S1, ..., Sm are chosen, whereas each Si , i ‚àà (1, ..., m) consists of attributes Ai1, ..., Aik. The goal or output of the process is insight I. Insight is either directly obtained from the set of created visualizations V or through confirmation of hypotheses H as the results of automated analysis methods. This formalization of the visual analytics process is illustrated in the following figure. Arrows represent the transitions from one set to another one. More formally the visual analytics process is a transformation F: S ‚Üí I, whereas F is a concatenation of functions f ‚àà {DW, VX, HY, UZ} defined as follows: DW describes the basic data pre-processing functionality with DW : S ‚Üí S and W ‚àà {T, C, SL, I} including data transformation functions DT, data cleaning functions DC, data selection functions DSL and data integration functions DI that are needed to make analysis functions applicable to the data set. VW, W ‚àà {S, H} symbolizes the visualization functions, which are either functions visualizing data VS : S ‚Üí V or functions visualizing hypotheses VH : H ‚Üí V. HY, Y ‚àà {S, V} represents the hypotheses generation process. We distinguish between functions that generate hypotheses from data HS : S ‚Üí H and functions that generate hypotheses from visualizations HV : V ‚Üí H. Moreover, user interactions UZ, Z ‚àà {V, H, CV, CH} are an integral part of the visual analytics process. User interactions can either effect only visualizations UV : V ‚Üí V (i.e., selecting or zooming), or can effect only hypotheses UH : H ‚Üí H by generating a new hypotheses from given ones. Furthermore, insight can be concluded from visualizations UCV : V ‚Üí I or from hypotheses UCH : H ‚Üí I. The typical data pre-processing applying data cleaning, data integration and data transformation functions is defined as DP = DT(DI(DC(S1, ..., Sn))). After the pre-processing step either automated analysis methods HS = {fs1, ..., fsq} (i.e., statistics, data mining, etc.) or visualization methods VS : S ‚Üí V, VS = {fv1, ..., fvs} are applied to the data, in order to reveal patterns as shown in the figure above.Daniel A. Keim, Florian Mansmann, J√∂rn Schneidewind, Jim Thomas, and Hartmut Ziegler (2008). \\"Visual Analytics: Scope and Challenges\\" In general the following paradigm is used to process the data: Analyse First ‚Äì Show the Important ‚Äì Zoom, Filter and Analyse Further ‚Äì Details on DemandKeim D.

Territory  The Croissant‚Äôs territory is shaped like a tapered crescent, joining the Tardoire valley in Charente to the west, to Monts de la Madeleine in Allier to the east. The crescent is very narrow between its westernmost point and Le Dorat (between 10 and 15 km wide), and widens towards the east: between 30 km (at Gu√©ret) and 45 km (at Culan). Principal communes in the zone: o Charente : Saint-Claud, Champagne-Mouton o Vienne : Pressac, Availles-Limouzine o Haute- Vienne : Bussi√®re-Poitevine, Le Dorat, Magnac-Laval, Saint-Sulpice-les- Feuilles o Indre : Saint-Beno√Æt-du-Sault, Lourdoueix-Saint-Michel, √âguzon- Chant√¥me o Creuse : La Souterraine, Crozant, Gu√©ret, Dun-le-Palestel, Genouillac, Bonnat, Boussac o Cher : Culan, Vesdun, Pr√©veranges, Saint-Priest- la-Marche o Puy-de-D√¥me : Saint-√âloy-les-Mines o Allier : Montlu√ßon, N√©ris- les-Bains, Commentry, Chantelle, Montmarault, Vichy, Saint-Germain-des-Foss√©s, Cusset, Le Mayet-de-Montagne, Audes The main Langue d‚Äôoc cities in the Croissant are Gu√©ret, Montlu√ßon et Vichy.(oc) Domergue Sumien, ¬´ ¬ª, Jornalet, Toulouse, Barcelone, Associacion entara Difusion d'Occit√†nia en Catalonha (AD√íC), 2014 (ISSN 2385-4510, lire en ligne [archive])  Classification  The majority of linguists specializing in the Croissant dialects confirm it is a predominantly Occtian-speaking zone. (Tourtoulon & Bringuier, Dahmen, Escoffier, Chambon & Olivier, Quint). Only Jules Ronjat expresses a more cautious opinion, refusing to explicitly say if the Croissant comes under Langue d‚ÄôOc or Langue d‚ÄôO√Øl (French). Following Ronjat‚Äôs hesitation, some books by Occitan scholars (Pierre Bec, Robert Lafont) have been reluctant to present the Croissant as a completely Langue d‚Äôoc-speaking zone. However, cultural studies conducted in the Croissant from the 1970‚Äôs (Quint, Merle) prove that linguistic and cultural awareness of Langue d‚Äôoc is widespread there. Since the 1970‚Äôs, edited maps include nearly all of the Croissant in the Langue d‚Äôoc-speaking region. Guylaine Brun-Trigaud even includes the Langue d‚Äôo√Øl dialects with Occitan features.Guylaine Brun-Trigaud, ¬´ ¬ª, Langue fran√ßaise, vol. 93, no 1, 1992, p. 23-52 (lire en ligne [archive], consult√© le 6 d√©cembre 2016). Likewise, the writer, Valery Larbaud (1881-1957), who originated from Vichy, in the Croissant zone, expressed his support for the idea of a union of Langue d‚Äôoc-speaking regions in his work Jaune bleu blanc (Yellow blue white) (1927).  Historical, territorial and linguistic evolution  The influence of French in the Croissant zone goes back a long way. Due to the presence of French-speaking nobility and administrators, from the second half of the 13th century administrative and legal documents were written in French and not in the local dialects, as well as in Marche County (Limousin-speaking territory) and in Bourbonnais (Auvergnat-speaking territory). In Bourbonnais, the earliest known documents written in the local vernacular are deeds in French with some Occitan forms inserted from 1245. Therefore, the Croissant has been a Langue d‚Äôoc-Langue d‚Äôo√Øl diglossia since that time, long before French spread through the rest of the Langue d‚Äôoc linguistic area. The border between Langue d‚Äôoc and Langue d‚Äôo√Øl was once located further to the north and has moved backwards over the centuries. The French dialects situated at the north of the Croissant (the southern part of Berry and the northern part of Bourbonnais) still contain traces of the Langue d‚Äôoc substrate.(oc) Domergue Sumien, ¬´ ¬ª, Jornalet, 12 mai 2014 (ISSN 2385-4510, lire en ligne [archive]) The spread of French (Langue d‚Äôo√Øl) towards the Croissant has been a long and progressive process, in contrast to the quite rapid d√©soccitanisation of Poitou, Saintonge and Angoumois which took place between the 12th and 15th centuries, due principally to the ravages of the Hundred Years War causing the area to be consecutively repopulated. In the Croissant dialects, the spread of Gallicisms has increased, weakening the local Occitan variants. During the last few centuries, it seems that this progression had been more rapid in Marche County (Limousin-speaking territory) than in Bourbonnais (Auvergnat-speaking territory). But since the 20th century, in all cases, the spread of French has resulted in a diglossia, and linguistic substitutions similar to those across all of the Langue d‚Äôoc- speaking regions. That puts into perspective the \\"gallicised\\" aspects of the Croissant dialects today, since nearly all Occitan dialects are undergoing a process of gallicization.  Dialectological subdivisions  There is no clear dialectological subdivision in the Croissant region, and the general impression is that it is largely fragmented. There is no clear border between the Auvergnat dialect region and the Limousin dialect region, given that the \\"border\\" between these two dialects is a vast transitional zone spanning the entire eastern part of the Limousin region (well beyond the Croissant). In any case, from a cultural, and possibly dialectological point of view, the west of the Croissant as far as Montlu√ßon belongs to Limousin or La Marche (Marchois is spoken there). The eastern part of the Croissant from Montmarault, where the Averno-Bourbonnais dialect is found, is linked to Auvergnat. Within the Auvergnat area, there is a distinct zone influenced by Francoproven√ßal in the south-east of Bourbonnais (the south-eastern part of Allier), towards the Bourbonnais Mountains. There, since ancient times, the intervocalic d is dropped, in particular in -aa endings (for -ada), as is also the case in Vivaro-Alpin (where the loss of the d can also be explained by its proximity to Francoproven√ßal).  Croissant dialect traits  Whilst the Croissant dialects are quite heterogenous (according to Ronjat), the following characteristics are commonly found: * According to accounts from Croissant dialect speakers, intercomprehension is a little difficult, but often possible with other dialects located to the south. It is much more difficult with the dialects located to the north. * The final vowels -a and -e are often completely silent in the Croissant, whereas they are very clearly pronounced in the other Occitan dialects. On the other hand, it is possible to hear -as [a(:)] and -es [ej/ij] endings which can potentially bring out the tonic accent. Despite this phenomenon, there are still traces of a mobile tonic accent which can fall either on the second-last syllable of a word (a paroxytone) or on the last syllable (an oxytone), in contrast to modern French, where the tonic accent is always on the last syllable. * Expressive uses, despite the invasion of French forms, (for example √©tait starting to take the place of √®ra), retain a large number of authentic Occitan traits and considerable lexical and idiomatic creativity (Escoffier).

Biography Matt is one of England‚Äôs rising match stars. A regular feature in the international set up, the three times U18 world champion is the only person to have won the junior world title three times. Matt began fishing at the age of just three years old, when he used to go and visit his grandparents who owned a caravan at Torksey in Lincolnshire. With the Fossdyke just a short walk from the site, it didn‚Äôt take Matt long to persuade his dad to let him give fishing a try. With most of his early years spent fishing venues around this area such as the Fossdyke, the Till and the Trent, it is not uprising that Matt has developed such an affinity to natural venues. It was at a commercial that he was given his big break into team fishing however, when he met Glyn Williams at an open day at Shireoaks when he was eight years old. The Worksop coach took Matt under his wing, signing him up for the Worksop cadet team. He fished his first national with the cadets aged 10 on the Bargate drain near Boston, helping the team to gold, and taking the individual bronze medal for himself. Aged 12, he made it into cadet team yet again for the national on the River Nene in Peterborough, where he took both individual and team gold, cementing his place as one of the best up and coming anglers in the country. The year after, the team struggled in the national, but in 2005, when Matt was 14, they bounced back yet again, taking team gold at Droitwich complex Woodlands View. This was also the year that Matt was first selected to represent his country in Serbia. The England teams did brilliantly this year, with both the juniors and intermediates taking team gold, with Matt taking the individual gold, and the intermediates also returning with an individual silver medal. Following on from his success the year before, Matt was selected to captain the junior squad in 2006. The team took a bronze medal, with Matt finishing a respectable thirteenth individually on the Bridgewater canal In 2007, Matt went on to secure his much documented second world title, taking the individual gold medal in the Czech republic. Other than his major success on the international stage, this year also saw Matt sign for Triana North. In 2009, Matt finished second in the prestigious Angling Times Maver Pairs Final with Tom Scholey, and was snapped up by top northern match fishing team, Ultimate Barnsley Blacks, where he now fishes alongside some of the country's best anglers, including five times World Champion, Alan Scotthorne, In 2010, Godfrey won the Individual Silver medal in his first ever U22 World Championship, at the age of just 18. He has since completed a Geography degree at Sheffield University, and now works as Editorial Assistant on Pole Fishing Magazine, at David Hall Publishing. Notable recent achievements include a 3rd-place finish in the 2013 Bait Tech Festival at White Acres, and victory in the Parkdean Pairs Festival with Tom Scholey.

Name  \\"Sherith Israel\\" is a rendition of the Hebrew ◊©◊ê◊®◊ô◊™ ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú, which means \\"Remnant of Israel.\\" In some early synagogue documents, the name was spelled \\"Shearith Israel,\\" which reflects the presence of the aleph (◊ê) in ◊©◊ê◊®◊ô◊™ (\\"Sherith\\").  History  Sherith Israel has its beginnings in 1887, when it was a Hungarian congregation organized by the Hungarian Benevolent Society of Nashville.\\"History of Nashville Congregations.\\" The Goldring/Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life. In 1904, another congregation called Adath Israel declared itself as a Conservative congregation, making the Hungarian synagogue the only Orthodox congregation in Nashville. Wedge issues like mixed-gender seating encouraged many from Adath Israel to join the Hungarian congregation. The following year, it adopted the name \\"Sherith Israel.\\" Soon afterwards, the congregation purchased a building on Fifth Avenue for use as a synagogue. Since it was next to the Ryman Auditorium, home to the Grand Ole Opry, there was some humorous confusion as country music fans walked in by mistake, and began listening to the Hebrew prayer service instead.

He and his wife, Rebbetzin Risya Posner, served as the spiritual leaders of the synagogue for many years. A small sample of Rabbi Posner's sermons appear in his book Reflections on the Sedra. He is a well-known Chasidic authority world-wide, and has authored, edited, and translated many works, including Think Jewish (author), the Tanya (translator, two parts of five), and the Hebrew-English Nusach HaAri Siddur published by Kehot (editor). Before his retirement from Sherith Israel, he gave classes about the Tanya, the weekly Torah portion, the Talmud, and how the modern world is placed in the realm of Jewish tradition. Cantor George Lieberman, an active leader and teacher of the congregation today, joined the synagogue in March 1996. Trained at the Yeshiva University Cantorial School, Cantor Lieberman continues to serve as the congregation's baal korei, or Torah scroll reader, and to lead Sabbath and Holiday services for the congregation. He also teaches Hebrew, prepares children for bar mitzvah and bat mitzvah, and gives adult-level classes about the weekly portion in the Torah. In addition, he has taught classes about the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (a famous code of Jewish law) and Midrash (a collection of traditional allegories that frequently flesh out details in the Torah), and many other topics. Saul Strosberg was appointed rabbi of Congregation Sherith Israel in 2005. He is a graduate of Yeshiva University and has ordination from Yeshivat Chovevei Torah. Under his leadership, Sherith Israel's membership has grown from 140 families to over 200.  Akiva School  Congregation Sherith Israel is also the original site of the Akiva Jewish Day School, which Rabbi Zalman I. Posner founded in 1954.

Large, back-lit sculptures depicting the Two Tablets of the Covenant flank the ark in the front of the sanctuary. There are two sections for women that flank the recessed area for men in the center of the room. In addition, a women's balcony in the rear overlooks the room. Mechitzas about five feet tall separate the male and female sections of the room. The small sanctuary doubles as a classroom, and holds many tables for this purpose. It also contains part of the synagogue's library, its walls covered in bookshelves. There is an ark in this room, and a large reading table from which to read the Torah scrolls.

Derain also designed the d√©cor and costumes for the ballet.C. W. Beaumont, \\"La Boutique Fantasque\\", in Complete Book of Ballets (New York, 1938; reprint, London, 1951). The 14-page discussion of La Boutique Fantasque gives much information on the first performance, the original setting, and an extended description of the story line. Ottorino Respighi wrote the music based on piano pieces by Gioachino Rossini. Its world premiere was at the Alhambra Theatre in London on 5 June 1919, performed by Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes.Horst Koegler, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Ballet, 2nd ed. (Oxford and New York, 1987). Massine described how, in Rome for a ballet season, Respighi brought the score of Rossini's P√©ch√©s de vieillesse to Diaghilev. The impresario played them to Massine and Respighi. Toulouse- Lautrec was an influence on the period setting and style of La Boutique fantasque, and Massine envisaged the principal character \\"quite Lautrec- like\\".Drummond, John. Interviews with Massine in: Speaking of Diaghilev. Faber and Faber, London, 1997. Diaghilev arranged for Massine to meet Derain in Paris, and they worked out the scenario with the artist's marionette theatre at his home on the rue Bonaparte. The date of the action was moved from 1832 to the 1860s.Buckle R. Diaghilev. London, Weidenfeld and Nicolson Ltd, 1979, p353. The story of the ballet has similarities to Die Puppenfee (\\"The Fairy Doll\\") of Josef Bayer, an old German ballet that had been performed by Jose Mendez in Moscow in 1897 and by Serge and Nicholas Legat in Saint Petersburg in 1903. Others note the similarities to Hans Christian Andersen's The Steadfast Tin Soldier.Grace Robert, The Borzoi Book of Ballets (New York, 1946), pp. 66ff. Massine's scenario centers on the love story between two can- can dancer dolls in a toyshop,boutiquefantasque incorporating elements of comedy, national folk dance and mime, as well as classical choreography. Story The ballet is set in France in 1860. A world-famous toymaker has created exquisite dancing dolls in his magic toyshop. The automata perform various dance routines for the prospective customers. At first the toys entertain two English ladies and an American family. Some dolls perform a tarantella for the guests, followed by other dolls dressed as playing cards who dance a mazurka. Then two dolls come in and perform another routine involving a snob and a melon vendor. New customers arrive, a Russian family, and everyone welcomes them. Five Cossack dolls enter and perform a traditional dance, followed by an animal act featuring two dancing poodles. Then the shop- keeper introduces his most sophisticated dancing dolls, a pair of can-can dancers, a flashly-dressed man and girl, come in and perform their routine. Their dance is so enchanting that the American family decides to buy the male doll while the Russian family buys the female dancing doll. The deals are made and paid for, the dolls are placed in separate boxes and collection is arranged for the next day. Darkness descends, but during the night, the dolls magically come to life and start dancing. They are upset that the two can-can dancers who are lovers are going to be separated, and a plot is hatched to hide them before the customers return in the morning. When the shop opens the next day and the customers come in to pick up their dolls, they discover that the can-can dancers are no longer there. The customers, not knowing about the secret life of the dolls, blame the shop owner and attack him and his assistant. In the ensuing fracas, the dolls come to the shopkeeper's rescue with the Cossack dolls attacking the customers with their bayonets. Driven out of the shop, the customers watch incredulously through the window as the happy dolls and the shopkeeper dance merrily inside with the re-united can-can dancers.Beaumont (1938) Original cast Among the large cast in the original production were: * Enrico Cecchetti as Shopkeeper * Alexander Gavrilov as Shop Assistant, described by Buckle as \\"characters of Dickensian eccentricity\\" * Serge Grigoriev as Russian Merchant * Lydia Sokolova and Leon Woizikowski as Tarantella Dancers *Lubov Tchernicheva as Queen of Clubs * Vera Nemchinova as Queen of Hearts * Stanislas Idzikowski as The Snob ‚Äì \\"a caricature of an English dandy\\" * Nicolas Zverev as Cossack Chief * Vera Clark and Nicholas Kremnev as Dancing Poodles * Lydia Lopokova and L√©onide Massine as Can-can Dancers ‚Äì who imitated the \\"contortions of Lautrec's Valentin le d√©soss√©\\"Buckle R.

Paris saw La Boutique fantasque for the first time on Christmas Eve 1919. Despite Massine's dismissal from the Ballets Russes in early January 1921, the ballet was revived in the following May at the Prince's Theatre in London and at the Ga√Æt√©-Lyrique in Paris in 1925 and on tour in Europe in the following years, and was on the bill of the final performance of Diaghilev's company in Vichy on 4 August 1929; the impresario died two weeks later in Venice.Buckle R. Diaghilev. London, Weidenfeld and Nicolson Ltd, 1979, p535. The enormous success of Colonel de Basil's Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in Europe and America prompted J.C. Williamson Management to arrange the company's first tour to Australia and New Zealand. Thus, La Boutique fantasque was the first ballet by L√©onide Massine to be performed in Australia. It had its Australian premiere at the Theatre Royal, Adelaide, during the opening night of the Ballets Russe de Monte Carlo tour on 13 October 1936.Vicente Garc√≠a-M√°rquez, The Ballets Russes: Colonel de Basil's Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo, 1932-1952 (New York 1990), p. 155. Valentina Blinova and Leon Woizikowski were particularly celebrated as the can-can dancers.http://www.australianballet.com.au/about_us/history When Massine left the company of Colonel de Basil in 1937, La Boutique fantasque was among the works involved in a copyright dispute. Following a legal ruling in 1937, de Basil was no longer allowed to perform pre-1932 works by Massine. The performance rights then reverted to the choreographer.australiadancing through the Internet Archive Massine subsequently mounted the work for the re-formed Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo some time in 1939, where it formed a triptych of high-spirited ballets with his Ga√Æt√© Parisienne and Le Beau Danube. The ballerina roles in all three ballets became indelibly associated with the elegant and witty interpretations of Alexandra Danilova.Jack Anderson, The One and Only: The Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo (New York, 1981), p. 204. Massine mounted La Boutique fantasque for Ballet Theatre, later known as American Ballet Theatre, in 1942 and its American premiere took place at the Central High School Auditorium in Omaha, Nebraska, on 4 January 1943. Among the cast were Simon Semenoff (Shopkeeper), Nicolas Orloff (Shop Assistant), Muriel Bentley (English Old Maid), Antony Tudor (American Patron), Jerome Robbins (American Boy), Nora Kaye and Yurek Lazowsky (Tarantella Dancers), John Taras (Melon Hawker), Andr√© Eglevsky (Cossack Chief), Karen Conrad and John Kriza (Dancing Poodles), and Irina Baronova and L√©onide Massine (Can-can Dancers).http://www.abt.org/education/archive/ballets/fantastic_toyshop.html The Royal Ballet in London mounted the work in 1947 as part of the renewal of its repertoire for Covent Garden; Massine was in charge of the production and danced his original role. In 1948, Danilova appeared alongside him.Alexander Bland, The Royal Ballet: The First Fifty Years (London: Threshold Books,1981), p90. The Royal Ballet touring company revived the piece in Stratford in 1968 and it remained in their repertory for several years after, and Massine returned to coach the company for the 1978 run.Alexander Bland, The Royal Ballet: The First Fifty Years (London: Threshold Books,1981), p230, 244. Score Buckle notes that as the ballet took shape it became clear that each musical number was \\"perfect of its kind\\" and that there was ample variety of tunes and related dances.Buckle R. Diaghilev. London, Weidenfeld and Nicolson Ltd, 1979, p354. The Rossini piano works used include Gherkins, Radishes, Butterflies, Themes in Variation, Almonds, Petit Caprice (Style Offenbach), Tarantelle pur Sang, Castor Oil, Abortive polka, and La Danza.Williamson, Michael E. La boutique fantasque. In: Decca Book of Ballet, ed Drew. Frederick Muller Ltd, London, 1958.

Access date 27 August 2012. He worked with William Cobbett on the radical newspaper Political Register, and spent time in prison as a consequence of his writing, publishing and campaigning activities. He has been credited with formulating and popularising the idea of a general strike for the purpose of political reform.Carpenter, Niles. William Benbow and the Origin of the General Strike. The Quarterly Journal of Economics , Vol. 35, No. 3 (May, 1921), pp. 491-499.

By 1808 he was preaching Nonconformist sermons in the Newton area of Manchester, and evidence suggests he may have been a Quaker. He appears as \\"William Benbow, of Manchester, shoemaker\\" in a list of the leading reformers of Lancashire in 1816. When interviewed in Chester gaol in 1841, where he was serving a sentence for sedition, he described himself as a married shoemaker with three sons, and gave his religion as Baptist. Publishing and political activism Benbow attended political meetings in London during 1816 as a delegate of one of the Lancashire Hampden Clubs, and became interested in Spenceanism. He was closely involved with planning the attempted Blanketeers protest march by Lancashire weavers in March 1817 and was one of a number of radicals arrested in the wake of this event and the subsequent severe crackdown by the authorities, amidst rumours that mass uprisings were being plotted in industrial centres like Manchester. His protest petition to Parliament in 1818, presented along with a number of others, describes how he was apprehended in Dublin on 16 May 1817, spent eight months on remand in London, then was released without trial, lacking the resources to travel home to Manchester. He established himself as a political radical in London, where he was an associate of William Cobbett and passed his time \\"agitating the labouring classes at their trades meetings and club-houses\\" according to the memoirs of the Manchester radical Samuel Bamford, who also spent several months in the Coldbath Fields Prison in London and petitioned Parliament unsuccessfully for redress. To support himself and his radical activities, Benbow worked as a printer, publisher and bookseller, and also as a coffee house proprietor. In addition to political texts, he also produced pirated editions of other works, and pornography ‚Äì around 1818 he employed the young William Dugdale who went on to become one of London's most notorious publishers of obscene and pornographic material. He was closely linked to the writer and publisher George Cannon, printing and marketing a number of his works and translations, and it has been suggested that some of the writings published under Benbow's name may have been written by Cannon. When William Cobbett fled to America in 1817 to avoid arrest, his radical newspaper, the Political Register, continued to be published in London by Benbow until his return in 1820.Newspapers (2003) www.georgianindex.net. Accessed 27 August 2012. In 1822 Benbow published an edition of Lord Byron's Don Juan, and also an edition of William Lawrence's controversial The Natural History of Man (1819), which had lost its copyright protection when deemed blasphemous by the Lord Chancellor. A heated exchange with the then Poet Laureate Robert Southey, who objected to Benbow's unauthorised reprinting of parts of his early poem Wat Tyler, prompted a response in the form of a pamphlet entitled A Scourge for the Laureate in which Benbow drew a pointed contrast between the radical sentiments of the early poem and Southey's later role within the establishment. Benbow printed his pirate edition of Southey's work under the imprint of his bookshop and publishing house, the Byron's Head, in Castle Street, Leicester Square. Among other works under this imprint was a pirated edition of Posthumous Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley, which had been issued by Shelley's widow Mary in 1824 and swiftly withdrawn. In 1832 he published Crimes of Clergy, a collection of his own articles highly critical of Church of England ministers. The articles had previously been published individually, and one, dated May 1821, gives its place of composition as King's Bench Prison. In early July 1821 Benbow's MP, John Cam Hobhouse, had raised the case of Benbow's imprisonment in Parliament, requesting the Attorney General to investigate the matter. The Grand National Holiday On 28 January 1832 Benbow published a pamphlet entitled Grand National Holiday and Congress of the Productive Classes. He had joined the National Union of the Working Classes in 1831, and his coffee house and beer shop at 8 Theobalds Road, otherwise known as the Institution of the Working Classes, became the focus for the Union's activities. Benbow was a regular, high-profile speaker at its gatherings at Blackfriars Rotunda, where he advocated direct and even violent action for political reform, and in particular his idea for a \\"national holiday\\" and \\"national convention\\". By this he meant an extended period of general strike by the working classes, which would be a sacred or holy action (hence \\"holy-day\\"), during which time local committees would keep the peace and elect delegates to a national convention or congress, which would agree the future direction of the nation. In his pamphlet Benbow drew parallels between his plan and the ancient Jewish Jubilee year, which embraced concepts like forgiveness of debt and redistribution of land. The striking workers were to support themselves with savings and confiscated parish funds, and by demanding contributions from rich people. Benbow briefly edited published a newspaper, the Tribune of the People, whose subject-matter was the topics to be included in the congress, but it was discontinued after just three issues. In April 1832 he was arrested again, along with James Watson and William Lovett, for his involvement in planning a Chartist parade and \\"general feast\\" He was tried and acquitted the following month. Benbow's popularity waned for a time after the passage of the Reform Bill, but his idea of a Grand National Holiday or \\"sacred month\\" was adopted by the Chartist Congress of 1839, Benbow having spent time in Manchester during 1838‚Äì9 promoting the cause and his pamphlet. The month was scheduled to begin on 12 August, but on 4 August Benbow was arrested for seditious libel along with George Julian Harney, for campaigning to persuade workers to participate. The Chartists called off the strike. Benbow spent eight months on remand. At his trial, in Chester in April 1840, he spoke for over ten hours in his own defence, but was convicted and sentenced to sixteen months imprisonment. William Benbow, his wife and son George emigrated to Australia around 1853.

He was also known as \\"Pacha\\" and \\"Matou\\".  Early life  Imbert was born in Toulouse, the son of an aviation worker with a passion for opera. Imbert was sentenced to five years in prison in 1947 for an assault on his mother-in-law's lover in a Montpellier bar, but served less than two due to good conduct.Nouvel Obs On his time in prison, he later declared: > The first true damned stupidity of my life, I had hit my mother-in-law's > lover a little too hard. I got five years! The prison, this is the place > where I met the biggest number of tossers. A pack of pathetic ones, of > losers. But I was put in a cell with a true tough guy. I said, \\"This is it, > my path.\\" The \\"tough guy\\" was Gustave M√©la, nicknamed \\"Gu le Terrible\\", another criminal that would become notorious in the 1960s. Whilst in prison Imbert decided on the nickname Jacky Le Mat, meaning \\"Jacky the bottom\\" or \\"Jacky the Madman\\" in the slang of the time. In 1948 Imbert enrolled in the French Army and spent four years in the 15e R√©giment de Tirailleurs S√©n√©galais in Oran, French Algeria. He was discharged for having a \\"character incompatible with military regulations\\".  Years with les Trois Canards  At the start of the 1950s Imbert joined the Bande des Trois Canards, the \\"Three Ducks Gang\\", so-named after the cabaret club which was their den. The gang specialised in burglaries, hold-ups and racketeering, and was said to have built a cellar in their club in which people who resisted paying protection money would be tortured. It was while he was in this gang, mainly composed of Marseille Italians, that Imbert met another future gang leader, Tany Zampa, with whom he would forge a close friendship. Other members were Marius Bertella, G√©g√®ne le Manchot (G√©g√®ne the one-armed) and Ga√©tan Albor√©o. It was with them that the young Imbert learned the ropes of the trade, becoming a central element of the team, thanks to his self-control and his determination. Imbert's legitimate work during this period was as a stunt driver, also taking part in races on Marseille's Old Harbour.Article de La Provence : Guet-apens pour Jacky \\"Le Mat\\" He became known as a womaniser, with two marriages and six mistresses. In 1961 he was convicted of pimping in a case involving Raymond Infantes, the kingpin of Oran's brothels, and condemned to six months in prison. Infantes had played on his connections to escape a prison sentence while implicating Imbert, who would never forgive him. Imbert exacted his revenge on Infantes: under cover of the night, he piloted a small Cessna airplane across the Mediterranean to Algeria, kidnapped Infantes and brought him back to Marseille, where he tortured him and demanded a large sum of money as ransom. Fearing for his life Infantes paid up, and the money permitted Imbert to set up his own gang. Imbert hired twenty men without Zampa's knowledge and, while appearing to remain under Zampa's control, he began to run his own separate organisation. On 14 April 1963 Imbert shot a Corsican Parisian boss, Jean- Baptiste Andr√©ani with a shotgun, twice at point-blank range. Andr√©ani survived. The motive of the shooting is not clear: It might be that Andr√©ani refused to pay the Franc protection money demanded by the \\"Three Ducks\\", or it may have been a contract taken out by Andr√©ani's rival, Marcel Francisci. The \\"Bande des Trois Canards\\" disbanded around 1965. Mob boss Antoine Gu√©rini was assassinated in a drive-by on 23 June 1967. Imbert is suspected of shooting him on Zampa's orders, as Zampa was still Imbert's boss. The murder was supported by the Milieu gang, who wanted revenge for the killing of Robert Bl√©mant by the Gu√©rini clan. In 1968 Imbert was put on the Police organised crime file with the number 909/68. He also became a trotting driver with his friend Alain Delon in 1968, and in 1973 he became the French champion.  Attempted murder by Zampa Gang  On 1 February 1977 Imbert survived a murder attempt by Tony Zampa's crew.. He was shot many times and doctors removed twenty-two projectiles, including seven bullets, from his body. His right arm remained paralysed as a result of the attack; though the French newspaper Le Monde wrote, \\"Small matter, he learned to shoot with the left\\". Imbert's revenge came when eleven of Zampa's associates were gunned down for the failed murder attempt. Imbert was later arrested as he allegedly prepared for another killing. No charges were brought against him, and he was released after six months. When he came out a truce had been declared. After this period, Imbert seemed to lead a quiet life between the Caribbean, Italy and France. In the 1980s he was also the public relations man for the discoth√®que \\"Bus Palladium\\" in Paris, which was owned by his friend Richard Erman, a Russian-born businessman. He was a close friend of Francis \\"The Belgian\\" Vanverberghe, another mob boss whose early drug trafficking was described in the movie The French Connection. Vanverberghe was shot dead in a betting club near the Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, in September 2000.  Trials  Police were investigating a criminal operation run by the Russian Mafia who were planning to build a clandestine cigarette factory in a warehouse in a suburb of Marseille. As a part of that investigation police taped a phone conversation between Imbert and Erman. Imbert said: \\"Look, all these ups and downs, they are beginning to cause me problems, you get it?\\". Police were convinced this was evidence he was part of the operation run by the Russian mafia and in October 2003 he was arrested in a police raid on his home. The trial started in November 2004. The state prosecutor asked for a five-year prison term for Imbert, the highest term asked for during the case. Prosecutor Marc Gouton said: \\"Everyone here has testified that without Imbert's authorisation nothing could be done. He has a very strong character. He is not a man who takes orders. He gives orders and others carry them out\\"; however, prosecution witnesses later retracted their initial testimony. The only remaining evidence linking Imbert to the Mafia project was the telephone call with Erman, which, as his lawyer pointed out in court, is open to interpretation: \\"The case against him is so hollow, so inexistent, so empty, that I am reduced to answering a charge based on the intonation of a voice\\". The court in Marseille sentenced him to four years in prison for masterminding the operation. It seemed Imbert's long run of luck had run out. However, he appealed and on 8 April 2005, at 75 years old, Imbert was cleared of taking part in the scam to manufacture contraband cigarettes. The appeal court found that the telephone tap evidence against him was unconvincing. The link between the Russian Mafia and Imbert was Richard Erman. On 16 June 2006 Imbert was sentenced to four years for extorting money from Paris businessmen in the early 1990s. Imbert's counsel appealed the verdict,, but on 2 January 2008 Imbert was sentenced to two years.  In popular culture  22 Bullets, a French film released in 2010, was based on Imbert, who was portrayed by actor Jean Reno.

It stars Luke Wilson, Giovanni Ribisi, Gabriel Macht and James Caan. The movie is based on the experiences of Christopher Mallick, who was previously associated with the Internet billing companies Paycom and ePassporte. Christopher Mallick has been accused of stealing millions of dollars from his customers at ePassporte to fund the creation of the film. Plot In 2004 Houston, Jack Harris drives with several million dollars in a duffel bag to deliver to Russian mobsters, worried about the safety of his wife Diana and their children. In 1997 Los Angeles, Jack has a reputation for solving problems, and helps a sick friend co-manage a newly set up nightclub. Wayne Beering and Buck Dolby are best friends, renting a small dingy flat together, though often hot-headedly at each other's throats. The slacker drug- addicted friends are discussing pornography one evening and Wayne asks why it is still not possible to buy porn on the Internet instead of relying on adult DVDs that have already been watched multiple times. As they discuss the logistics of such a possibility, Buck creates a program to allow online credit card transactions to charge people for looking at porn on their website. They quickly earn thousands of dollars in a matter of days and are soon inundated with new subscribers. Needing more porn material to satisfy the demand, they approach Nikita Sokoloff, a rather crazed Russian mob boss who owns a local strip club; who agrees to 25% of their business in return for letting them photograph and film his strippers in action. Buck and Wayne's website is successful and they celebrate their newfound riches by partying in Las Vegas while neglecting to make the promised payments to Sokoloff. Jack has made the L.A. nightclub a success and attracts the attention of Jerry Haggerty, a crooked lawyer hired by Wayne and Buck to sort out their problem with Sokoloff, who's aggressively on their backs after his cut. Jack meets the two friends and soon becomes a partner in the business; but, not wanting to be a pornographer, Jack recommends they rather become more like 'middle men' and instead take a cut of the credit card money transfers, which would allow them even larger profits. Jack pays off Haggerty $200,000, knowing Haggerty is under federal indictment and therefore a threat to the business. Sokoloff's mobster nephew comes to collect his $400,000, but when he threatens Jack's son, one of Jack's body guards punches his head so hard that he falls over dead. A now panicked Jack and his partners dump the body in the ocean and fabricate a story that Sokoloff's nephew pilfered the money and ran. Sokoloff is highly skeptical, but agrees to let it pass in return for a further increase to 50% of the partnership. Jack expands the business by focusing on the online credit card billing services, soon needing their very own building to house it all. They create a billing company called \\"24/7 billing.com\\", becoming the titular \\"Middle Men\\" for other Internet-based porn providers. The billing business is making hundreds of millions of dollars within a year, so much so that they struggle to keep track of all the cash. Jack becomes addicted to the money, sex and power of his new lifestyle and consequently spends little time with his Houston family. He eventually starts a relationship with an irresistible young entrepreneur porn star, Audrey Dawns. Haggerty, bitter that Jack cut him out of what has become a multi-million- dollar partnership, schemes to bleed them of more cash or take over the company. He manipulates the foolish Wayne and Buck to work with Denny Z, providing billing services for Denny's dodgy websites which include child pornography. Audrey's live stream porn site grabs the attention of a particular young terrorist who's soon obsessed. In no time many of his terror- cell mates have been linked over to Audrey's charms. The site becomes watched by an international web of masturbating terrorists, which the US government uses to accurately track, then arrest or kill said terrorists. The FBI asks for Jack and Audrey's help to expand their terrorist hunt, but a paranoid Wayne and Buck fear that Jack is meeting with the FBI to turn them in for the murder of Sokoloff's nephew and the alleged underage porn. In a panic, the two confide in Haggerty and also disclose the truth about Sokoloff's nephew, which Haggerty uses to incite Sokoloff to make a vengeful move on Jack. When Jack finds out that his partners are helping facilitate Denny Z's child porn, he confronts Denny at a house party. When Denny retaliates, Jack disarms then shoots Denny in the foot with the guy's own gun. On his way out, Jack sees Audrey having sex with two clients of hers at the party, and realizes how much he misses his own family. He decides to break up with her as a result. An FBI agent, appreciative of the critical help Jack has given the government, warns him that 24/7billing.com is about to be indicted for supporting child porn. Jack's life is further complicated when Sokoloff's men mistakenly kidnap his maid's son, who they erroneously believe is Jack's son. Nevertheless, Jack gathers up several million dollars and goes to meet Sokoloff to attempt save the kid, as seen at the start of the film. Jack is told that the boy will be released only if he signs a contract giving his partnership share to Wayne, Buck, Sokoloff, and Haggerty. Jack signs the agreement, realising this is just the lucky break he needed to exit the situation, so asks to backdate the contract six months, claiming he wants to avoid all the unnecessary taxes. Just as Haggerty is boasting his triumph over Jack, Sokoloff surprises him with a bullet in his back, deeming him too untrustworthy for partnership. He lets Jack go however, in recognition of all the money he has made him; \\"Sometimes business is more important than family\\". Jack and the maid's son return home safe and sound. Jack's FBI contact charges Wayne and Buck with providing billing services for child porn. Jack avoids being charged due to having sold the company before the crimes were committed. Sokoloff flees the country and returns to Russia to luxuriate in all his ill-gotten gains. Diane reluctantly, yet clearly pleased with the outcome, welcomes Jack back to the family home and marriage. A pre-title postscript denotes that they in fact remain happily married to this very day, even adding a further 2 kids to the mix. Buck and Wayne endured a mere 18-month stint out of a possible 5-year sentence, before being paroled. Cast Release Middle Men was released on August 6, 2010.

Because the urban arts are characterized by existing in the public space, they are often viewed as vandalism and destruction of private property. Although urban art started at the neighborhood level, where many people of different cultures live together, it is an international art form with an unlimited number of uses nowadays. Many urban artists travel from city to city and have social contacts all over the world. The notion of 'Urban Art' developed from street art which is primarily concerned with graffiti culture. Urban art represents a broader cross-section of artists that, in addition to covering traditional street artists working in formal gallery spaces, also cover artists using more traditional media but with a subject matter that deals with contemporary urban culture and political issues. In Paris, Le Mur is a public museum of urban art.  In the mainstream  Though starting as an underground movement, urban artists like Banksy and Adam Neate have now gained mainstream status and have, in turn, propelled the urban art scene into popular culture. Perceptions have started to change as urban movements such as graffiti slowly gain acceptance from the public. A confirmation of street art's new mainstream status can be, in part, confirmed by an invitation from the Tate calling upon artists to create outdoor pieces on the Thames side of the gallery in the summer of 2008. The band Gorillaz uses an urban art style to promote their band. The band members are animated in a graffiti style.

With Arkansas being relatively sparsely populated, this arrangement worked well until 1997, when the phone numbers in area code 501 were in danger of being used up. Area code 870 was created in April 1997 to serve the most rural parts of the state (originally specifically not Little Rock metro, Fort Smith or Northwest Arkansas).

Biography Kumo came into existence in 1994 when composer, producer, engineer and arranger Jono Podmore began work at Watershed Studios, London and with Plink Plonk records, founding two sister labels to Plink Plonk: Autoi and Psychomat. He began to play the theremin, developing new techniques for live performance of electronic music. After a string of singles, remixes, live dates and international DJ commitments as Kumo, March 1997 saw the release of his first album Kaminari to significant critical acclaim. 1997 was also the year that Kumo moved temporarily to France to work with Irmin Schmidt (of Can) on his opera Gormenghast, which premiered in 1998 and was re-staged in 2004. A selection from the opera was released on Spoon/Mute records in 2000. October 2000 saw the release of the second Kumo album 1+1=1 on Spoon Records. In 2001, after extensive touring including the Sonar festival, the London Jazz Festival and the Can Solo Projects tour, the first Irmin Schmidt and Kumo album Masters of Confusion was released worldwide. Later the same year they created the sound installation Flies, Guys and Choirs for the Barbican Centre as part of the Elektronik festival. The installation is now available as a sonic experience for public spaces. The duo continue to perform and give workshops together across Europe and work on film and TV music together including award-winning German TV series and dramas. The 4-track EP Kumo and Friends was released on Electric Tones Records in early 2003 and a successful collaboration with B. J. Cole was released on the album Trouble in Paradise. After further live appearances together, work began on a second Irmin Schmidt and Kumo album and the duo also made remixes (including P.I.L); performed live, held workshops in Germany and Portugal; and produced the album dot i/o for Mito Ichikawa.

Early life Potapy Emelianov was born into a family of Priestless Old Believers who were later received into the Old Ritualists by the Russian Orthodox Bishop of Ufa, Anthony (Khrapovitsky). He was tonsured and subsequently ordained as a hieromonk of the Russian Orthodox Church. When Anthony was named Metropolitan of Kiev, he brought the young hieromonk with him and assigned him to the Old Ritualist parish at Nizhnaya Bogdanovka, near Lugansk. Conversion to Catholicism By 1918, Emelianov had become convinced that true Orthodoxy could not be had except through Communion with the Holy See. After learning that Metropolitan Andrei Sheptytsky had formed an Exarchate for Russian Rite Catholics, Emelianov travelled to St. Petersburg to meet with the Exarch, Leonid Feodorov. After questioning him closely, Feodorov received Emelianov and his entire parish into the Russian Catholic Church. Persecution Emelianov and his parishioners underwent severe harassment and violent persecution from both the Red Guards and the White Army during the Russian Civil War. On January 27, 1927 he was arrested and on September 12, 1927 was sentenced to 10 years in prison and was sent to Solovki prison camp. Emelianov was sent to Solovki prison camp with a special purpose, where he was held with other Catholic priests and participated in religious services. In 1929, along with other Catholic priests, he was transferred to a prison camp on Anzer Island, where he was involved in secret worship. In 1932 he took place in the case of the Catholic clergy, signed on Solovki prison camp. During the interrogation, said: \\"The time I spent in the camp, did not shake my religious beliefs here, I became even more resistant to further Catholic me nothing can shake.\\" As a result, the authorities have decided to subject it to special punishment contain the islands separately from other priests until the end of isolation. In November 1933 he was transferred to the station Belbaltlag Nadvoytsy, and then kept at the station Bear Mountain Kirov railway. Death On August 4, 1936 Emelianov was released from the camp (probably because of a serious illness) and sent into exile. He died on August 14, 1936 at the Podvoytsy station in Karelia. Emilianov died while building the White Sea Canal. Legacy and Beatification Emelianov is greatly venerated among Russian Catholics. His cause for possible beatification opened in 2003 where he received the title of a Servant of God.

Their boatbuilding firm in Stockton, California operated from 1902 to 1987. Over the years the company became famous for its elegantly designed pleasure craft, including sailboats, speedboats, cruisers and private yachts. Stephens Bros. also built many vessels for the U.S. military, especially during World War II. The company's first vessel was the sloop Dorothy, in 1902.  History  =1902-1924= Fred F. Lambourn, commercial runabout, 1911 The Dorothy displayed the brother‚Äôs craftsmanship, and a local businessman took notice and gave the brothers $1,000 in credit along with construction plans for a motor launch. By 1903 they completed the Gee Whiz, making it their first commissioned boat. Later that same year, the brothers built an even larger motor launch, the Queen. By now, their popularity and demand had outgrown their backyard construction site. The brothers relocated their business to a partially submerged barge in the Stockton channel, giving them room to expand. From this new location, they were able to work year round and tackle projects of greater magnitude. One of their biggest challenges was learning to install the innovative gasoline engine into their boats. Luckily, Stockton‚Äôs Samson Iron Works, which manufactured these gasoline engines, was nearby and engineers from the company were available to answer questions and assist with installations. During this time, Stockton was still predominantly a farming community. A sleek, quick craft was needed to transport commission merchants out to secure contracts with the farmers of the Delta islands west of Stockton. Such high demand for a speedy vessel gave rise to a new Stephens Bros. design, sometimes referred to as ‚Äúspud-boats‚Äù, since potatoes were a Stockton agricultural staple. The most famous of these speedboats was the Fred F. Lambourn. Completed in 1912, this boat earned Stephens Brothers a praiseworthy reputation with its record-breaking speed. =1925-1941= Paraja Stephens Bros., 44 foot cutter, late 1930s As the city of Stockton grew, the use for boats as a means of transportation throughout the Delta gave way to the increasingly popular automobile. Needing to adapt, Stephens Bros. moved into the new field of pleasure craft as Americans became increasingly interested in boats for leisure activities. To keep up with their east coast competitors, Stephens Bros. introduced the runabout. Each of these was a work of art, hand-crafted out of teak, mahogany and white oak. In total, 38 of these boats were made between the years of 1925 and 1929. The company was economically successful even during the Great Depression. East coast buyers were taking an interest in Stephens Bros'. new gasoline powered semi-stock cruisers that were smaller and more affordable than the previously built steam yachts. In 1933, Thod Stephens died unexpectedly, leaving full management of the company to Roy. Despite this setback, the company went on to build a number of luxury and racing sailboats including the Pajara, and a small fleet of auxiliary sloops known as Farallone Clippers. In May 1938 the schooner JADA was built for Delbert Axelson. By the spring of 1941, production of all pleasure craft was halted as the company began a major contract with the U.S. military. =1942-1945= 104-foot Air Rescue Boat, 1943 Even before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Stephens Bros. was building vessels for the U.S. government. The Navy‚Äôs Bureau of Ships and the U.S Coast Guard contracted the company to build wooden minesweepers that were used to remove magnetic mines or to protect slower ships from submarine torpedo attacks. At , these were the largest vessels the company had ever built. The company‚Äôs main contribution to the war effort was the Air-Sea Rescue Boat. Two types of these vessels were built, a and a . With 12-cylinder engines, they were designed to race out to crash sites and rescue wounded men, and hence were also known as ‚Äúcrash boats.‚Äù By the end of the war in 1945, the company was able to stop production on military vessels and open its doors for more peaceful pursuits. =1946-1966= Westlake, raised-deck motor yacht, 1952 After successful managing the company following his brother‚Äôs death, Roy Stephens decided to retire at the end of World War II. He turned the company over to his nephews, Theo, Barre and Dick Stephens. Stephens Bros. continued making semi-stock cruisers with their generic outside hulls and custom designed interiors. In the wake of the postwar economic boom, orders for more custom yachts increased. One of their more spectacular specimens was the Westlake. Built in 1952, this motor yacht was outfitted with a television in her main cabin. By the end of the Korean War and the beginning of Cold War hostilities in 1953, Stephens Bros. again contracted with the military. The company built more minesweepers and rescue boats for the Air Force. However, only a quarter of the company‚Äôs production was set aside for military work. Work continued on private vessels such as the famed 'Farallon Clipper' yachts, of which only 19 were built. By this time, Stephens Brothers had made such a name for themselves through build quality and level of craftsmanship that these yachts were reserved for wealthy clientele. In 1960, the brothers sold the company to the Wrather Corporation, headed by entertainment industry mogul and Stephens Bros. boat collector, Jack Wrather, and the company name was changed to Stephens Marine, Inc. However, this short-lived transaction proved to be a poor financial investment so the brothers bought the company back just three years later. Through the mid-1960s, the company continued to gain popularity, with more orders flowing in from the east coast. The most impressive of these was an yacht, Miss Budweiser, which was completed in 1962 for Anheuser-Busch in New York. =1967-1987= Sea Stag II, , 1946 Restored by Mayea Boat & Aeroplane WorksLate into the 1960s, the boat building market underwent a transformation. New materials like aluminum and fiberglass were proving to be more durable and affordable. The demand shifted from wood to these materials; Stephens Bros. launched its last wooden boat in 1974. From then, the company focused solely on yachts and sailing vessels, producing nothing less than in length. These large yachts were very expensive to build and, because of their size and intricacy, the company could not complete more than two a year. With rising expenses and a slowing market, Stephens Bros. was no longer financially viable, and closed down in the spring of 1987.  Stephens Bros. boats today  Today, Stephens Bros. boats are highly prized as collectors‚Äô items. Stephens Bros. boat owners meet every year at the Stephens Rendezvous, organized by the Northern California Fleet of the Classic Yacht Association, to show off these beautiful vessels. A collection of Stephens Bros. documents, photographs and original drawings are available to the public in the archives of The Haggin Museum in the brothers‚Äô hometown of Stockton, California. The museum displays a fully restored 1927 26-foot runabout to commemorate the company and its legacy. Vessels built * USS MSC-257  References  Stephens Bros. Boat Builders & Designers by Barry J.

The town is a part of the Bethlehem Governorate in the central West Bank. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), al-Ubeidiya had a population of over 14,967 in 2019.2017 PCBS Census Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. History and archaeology Al-Ubeidiya is named after Saint Theodosius (\\"Ibn Ubeid\\" in Arabic), who built and was buried in a monastery west of the town, known as the Monastery of St. Theodosius. It was originally constructed in the 5th-century CE and Theodosius was buried there in 529. The current structure was built by the Crusaders in the 12th-century. It is located on a hilltop and is under the administration of the Greek Orthodox Church. The Mar Saba Monastery‚Äîwhich was built by Saint Sabbas in 484 CE‚Äîis located further east of the town center, but within its municipal jurisdiction. An Ancient Roman pool is situated in the center of al-Ubeidiya and was used in the Roman era of rule in Palestine to collect water.Al ‚ÄòUbeidiya Town Profile.

According to Dauphin, most of current the Monastery dates from the 19th century, but incorporates Byzantine remains.Dauphin, 1998, p. 913 =Ottoman era= The area, like the rest of Palestine, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517. In 1596 Al-Ubeidiya appeared in Ottoman tax registers, called Dayr Bani 'Ubayd, being in the nahiya of Al-Quds in the liwa of Al-Quds. It had a population of 42 households and 6 bachelors, all Muslim.

According to local tradition, the modern town of al-Ubeidiya was founded when members of the Shammar tribe from the Arabian Peninsula settled there, and it was not named after St. Theodosius, but after tribal leader, al-Ubeidi Faris. Around 1740 Richard Pococke noted \\"We soon came to a ruin called Der Benalbede, which from the name seems to have been an old convent.\\"Pococke, 1745, vol 2, p. 34, cited in Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 2, p. 159 In 1838, Edward Robinson noted Deir ibn Obeid, not far from Mar Saba, on his travels in the region.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 2, p. 159Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 123 He also met some of the fellahin from the village by the Dead Sea, where they collected salt for cooking.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 2, p. 210 In 1863, the French explorer Victor Gu√©rin visited the place, which he called Deir Dosi, and described the remains of the monastery.Gu√©rin, 1869 pp. 88 -92 In 1883, the PEF's \\"Survey of Western Palestine\\" described there Kh.

He has released five albums. Biography Born Conrad Lambert in Dorset, England, he grew up in West Bretton & Huddersfield, Yorkshire and moved to London in 1992. Merz had two minor hits in 1999 in the UK Singles Chart with Many Weathers Apart and Lovely Daughter. Later that same year, his eponymous debut album was released on Epic Records. The album combined elements of electronica with strains of folk and drew critical acclaim. However, the commercial success which had been predicted by many in the music industry and press failed to materialise, and Merz withdrew from his recording contract with Epic's parent company, Sony BMG, in 2000. His second album, Loveheart, surfaced five years later on the independent Gr√∂nland label. It also won plaudits, was well received in the music press and re-established Merz as a singular British musician. Subsequently Merz toured UK & Europe extensively, played at festivals as diverse as UK's Green Man Festival, Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland and SXSW in USA. More acclaim followed in the US, where the track Dangerous Heady Love Scheme was iTunes Single of the Week, and Postcard From A Dark Star, Toy, Credo and Serene were all Today's Top Tune for LA radio station KCRW. The third Merz album Moi et Mon Camion (2008) was written on the move, as Merz was relocating from Bristol to the English coast to the rural city of Bath then subsequently to Bern the capital city of Switzerland. The album features two collaborations with Paul Hartnoll of Orbital. This album was recorded at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios just outside Bath, and Rockfield Studios in Wales. Featuring a few notable musicians: Charlie Jones, some time bass player with Robert Plant & Jimmy Page and Goldfrapp, Clive Deamer, drummer for Portishead and Radiohead. The Earlies on backing vocals. This 3rd album also gained Merz much critical acclaim and saw Merz undertake his first pan-USA tour. In 2012 Merz recorded his fourth album No Compass Will Find Home collaborating with Matthew Herbert on the production and mix. It was released in UK January 2013 by Accidental Records. Again the UK press praised the album, The Sunday Times making it Album of the Week calling it a 'must buy' record. The Xynthia EP was released around the same time containing additional songs and a haunting Dimlite remix of The Hunting Owl. On 27 September 2013 Merz, along with musicians Shahzad Ismaily and Julian Sartorius, performed a show in London consisting of only one song: Many Weathers Apart. Variations and extemporizations on elements of the original song and its ten different remixes were incorporated into a forty-five minute set. It marked 15 years since the original release of the song. In November 2013 a Drum and Vocal Renditions version of Merz's album No Compass WIll Find Home was released by drummer/sound artist Julian Sartorius. Only the vocals from the original album were used to re-create the songs in drum and percussion arrangements. This record was released by Merz and Sartorius' respective labels Accidental Records and Everest Records. The album was toured as Merz feat. Sartorius Drum Ensemble with a line-up of four drummers (directed by Sartorius) and Merz on vocals. January 2015 Merz announced the release of his new album with a first song, Suite Mercy made available on Pledgemusic,.Merz on Pledgemusic In November 2015 Accidental Records released the fifth Merz album Thinking Like A Mountain, mixed by Matthew Herbert and featuring collaborations with musicians Shahzad Ismaily, Julian Sartorius, Dimlite, Gyda Valtysdottir and Ewan Pearson. Mojo Magazine called it ‚ÄúMerz‚Äôs brave new beginning‚Äù. The Ransom Note wrote ‚ÄúMerz has now reached a stage where he is a master of his art‚Äù In June 2018 Merz created a performance titled A Monastic Gig (the title an homage to the Alice Coltrane album A Monastic Trio) and invited the American musician Laraaji and American visual artist Jed Ochmanek to join in the collaboration. The event was held at Dampfzentrale Bern, transforming the ex-power station venue into a monastic vault. The singular concert engineered an atmosphere similar to recitals in churches: calm, sublimity, respect, humility; free of old-world religiousness and iconography. The audience were requested to enter the hall in silence, listen and observe in silence and leave the hall in silence. Merz has also co-written, appeared as a vocalist and musician with Victoria Williams, Fred Frith, Arto Lindsay, Orbital (band), Guy Called Gerald, Tom Middleton, Maxim (The Prodigy), Leftfield, Lemn Sissay, Leo Abrahams, Dive Index, Dan Le Sac, Dorit Chrysler, Tythe, Anne Marie Almedal, Manuel Troller, Kutti MC, has created remixes for Matthew Herbert, Dan Le Sac, Hayley Ross, produced the debut album of the band Jon Hood, and has lectured a songwriting masterclass at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.

It was formed in 1814 and dissolved in 1868. The Hamburg citizen militia should not be confused with the Hanseatic Legion (). During their time of coexistence, the militia restricted itself to ejecting the French garrisons of Hamburg and the other Hanseatic League cities, whereas the Legion also participated in the rest of the campaign under Russian overall command.  History  Since the late 12th century, Hamburg had military sovereignty ()‚Äîthe right and the duty to defend itself‚Äî and used this for the first time in 1394 to conquer the fortress of Ritzeb√ºttel‚Äîsince 1926 part of Cuxhaven. During the decades before the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648), Hamburg had 50 to 100 men under arms. The ' or ' (lit. citizen watch) was established around the beginning of the Thirty Years' War, and around 7,000 men (in 1617) were organized 19 companies, since 1619 in 4 battalions. The duties of the citizen watch included the defense of the city, to extinguish fires and general policing tasks. The men were conscripted, with exceptions only for holders of special offices or other privileged persons. During the 17th century the citizen watch was so undisciplined, that its tasks were to watch the fortification at night and to build fortifications only. From 1810 to 1814 Hamburg was annexed by Napoleon. During the occupation, the department formed the 127th Infantry Regiment, which was annihilated in the War of the Sixth Coalition (1812‚Äì14). The city was besieged for over a year by Allied forces (mostly Russian, Swedish and German). Russian forces under General Bennigsen finally freed the city in 1814. From 1814 to 1866 Hamburg was a sovereign country (like United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Kingdom of France or Prussia) and member of the German Confederation. The citizen watch and the citizen militia coexisted until Hamburg lost its military sovereignty in 1867, and the Infantry Regiment No. 76 of the Prussian army's 17th Division was garrisoned in Hamburg. On 15 January 1815 the first parade of the militia was held in Hamburg, with 2000 men. This date is considered as the anniversary of the militia and was celebrated every year with a feast of the officers corps or a parade. In 1815 the militia consisted of 4000 men infantry, 300 riflemen, 300 men artillery, and 100 cavalry, serving in the 6 city battalions, the 7th battalion in St Georg, and the 10th battalion in Ritzeb√ºttel. In 1837 the 8th battalion St. Pauli was established.Kopal (1911), p. 289‚Äì241  Organization  alt=A drawing of two soldiers in blue uniforms on horseback. A commission‚Äîconsisting of the oldest mayor of Hamburg, 2 senators, the city commander, the head of the militia, and 6 citizens‚Äîwas the oversight authority and link between the government and the militia. Without an order of the commission, the militia could not be alarmed or commanded for any duty. The commission decided in case of suspensions for conscripted citizens, on the budget of the militia,Fahl (1987), p. 36 and elected the majors and captains for the militia. Lieutenants and first lieutenants were selected by another commission. The commission had not the authority for general amendments of the regulations, this was a task of the Senate of Hamburg.Fahl (1987), p. 37 4 majors and their 4 adjutants supported the head of the militia (an ' and since 1840 an ') as the general staff. The battalions were headed by a major, and a captain was commander of a company.Fahl (1987), p. 35 In 1814, 10 infantry battalions were planned, a battalion of 4 companies of riflemen, a corps of 2 artillery companies, and a cavalry corps with 2 squadrons. Of the 10 infantry battalions, 6 should be established in the city of Hamburg, the 7th battalion was of St. Georg, Barmbek, Hamm, and Horn. The 8th battalions should be established in Billwerder, Ochsenwerder, and Finkenwerder, the 9th in St. Pauli, and the 10th in Ritzeb√ºttel (now Cuxhaven). The 6 city battalions, the 7th and the 10th battalion, and cavalry, artillery, and riflemen were established first. The 8th battalion was never fully established.Fahl (1987), p. 34  Social structure  The Hamburg Citizen Militia was not garrisoned and conscripted‚Äîevery citizen and inhabitants of the city and theirs sons were bound to serve‚Äînevertheless the conscription could be eluded with financing a substitute. Several occupational groups were excluded from the militia, among others priests, public teachers, physicians, bailiffs, members of the night watch and the police. Members of the Senate were also free of the service in the militia.Fahl (1987), p. 33 Because of the election of the officers by commissions close to the militia, the selection of the officer corps was separated from external influences. The duty regulations of 1814 emphasized, that the soldiers were citizens, and at the beginning patriotism and enthusiasm filled the ranks of the militia, although the level of the officers corps sunk in the 1830s. Older officers resigned and new officers were either inexperienced, young or with low education, who often could not write.Fahl (1987), pp. 45‚Äì46  See also  * Hanseatic Legion  References  = General =   Further reading  * Ulrich Bauche, Abschied vom B√ºrgermilit√§r, Beilage zur Hamburgensien-Mappe Hamburger Leben, zehnter Teil, Hamburg 1976 * L.

Life He was born at Forest House, Essex, the second son of Samuel Bosanquet and Eleanor Hunter. He was educated at Newcome's School and then in Switzerland.Oliver Bradbury and Nicholas Penny, The Picture Collecting of Lord Northwick: Part I, The Burlington Magazine Vol. 144, No. 1193 (Aug. 2002), pp. 485‚Äì496, at p. 486. Published by: The Burlington Magazine Publications Ltd. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/889635 He married Charlotte Anne Holford on 1 June 1796 and fathered seven children, three of whom survived him. He served as sub-governor of the South Sea Company from 1808‚Äì38, and governor from 1838‚Äì50. From 1823‚Äì36 he was chairman of the exchequer bill office. He served as Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant for the county of Northumberland, and was High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1828. In 1819 he was lieutenant-colonel of light horse volunteers, later rising to colonel. He maintained a London residence at the Firs, Hampstead, and spent his later years at his estate of Rock Hall near Alnwick in Northumberland. He died there on 20 June 1850, and is buried in its church. Economic works Between 1806 and 1807 Bosanquet produced three short works on commercial themes: #Letter on the Proposition submitted to the Government for taking the Duty on Muscavado Sugar ad valorem (1806?). #A Letter to W. Manning, Esq., M.P., on the Depreciation of the West India Property (1807?). In this work Bosanquet blamed the depreciation on ill-considered taxes and other restrictions placed on the colony. He proposed that British breweries should use colonial sugar and that the British navy should use colonial rum. #Thoughts on the Value to Great Britain of Commerce in general, and of the Colonial Trade in particular (1807?), in which he pointed out the benefits yielded by the West India trade. In 1810 Bosanquet published his most important work, Practical Observations on the Report of the Bullion-Committee. In it he criticised the Report as being ‚Äúaltogether at variance with (the opinions) of the persons selected for examination,‚Äù of relying on propositions that ‚Äúare not generally true, and do not therefore form a solid foundation for the abstract reasoning of the Report,‚Äù and of relying upon facts that ‚Äúare erroneously stated; and, when corrected, lead to opposite conclusions.‚Äù Inflationary pressure in early 1809 had prompted David Ricardo to write three letters to the Morning Chronicle, the first of which appeared on 29 August (Ricardo's first published work on economics). The public attention aroused by these letters and subsequent pamphlets led Parliament to appoint a select Committee to ‚ÄúInquire into the cause of the high price of bullion, and to take into consideration the state of the circulating medium, and of the exchanges between Great Britain and foreign parts.‚Äù The Committee, along with Ricardo, took the ‚ÄòBullionist‚Äô position. It stated that inflation had resulted from over-issue of currency, primarily by the Bank of England but also by country banks; and that as a means of preventing over-issue, the Bank of England should resume convertibility of the pound into gold. Bosanquet held to the ‚ÄòAnti-Bullionist‚Äô (or ‚Äòreal bills‚Äô) position, which was that over-issue would be avoided if banks issued paper money only in exchange for ‚Äúsolid paper, given, as far as we can judge, for real transactions.‚Äù Any over-issue of paper money, in the words of the Bank directors, ‚Äúwould revert to us by a diminished application for discounts and advances on government securities.‚Äù This latter principle became known as the ‚ÄòLaw of the Reflux‚Äô. David Ricardo had likened the issues of the Bank of England to a gold mine, insofar as an increased issue of paper money would have the same effect on prices as increased production of gold. Bosanquet countered that the Bank of England issued paper money only on loan, and that since loans must ultimately be repaid, the newly issued paper money would not cause inflation. Newly mined gold, in contrast, did not have to be repaid, and therefore would cause inflation. On these grounds Bosanquet denied the analogy between gold and paper money. Ricardo's Reply to Mr. Bosanquet (1811) has been described by McCulloch (1845) as ‚Äúperhaps the best controversial essay that has ever appeared on any disputed question of Political Economy.‚Äù In response to Bosanquet's statement that the supply of currency was adequately limited by the Bank's policy of making loans only for ‚Äòsolid paper‚Äô, Ricardo answered that as long as the Bank is willing to lend, borrowers will always exist, so that there is no practical limit to the over- issue of money, unless the Bank either maintains convertibility, or otherwise acts to maintain the quantity of money within reasonable bounds. Ricardo argued that the simple fact of the pound's depreciation was proof of its over- issue‚Äîa circular argument that nevertheless carried the day. Bosanquet never published a reply to Ricardo, and he has consequently been much abused by historians of economic thought. J.K. Horsefield (1941) wrote of ‚Äúthe lamentable decline from the counsels of Samuel Bosanquet in 1783 to the apologia of Charles Bosanquet in 1810,‚Äù while R.S. Sayers (1952) observed that ‚Äúpoor Bosanquet is left cutting a very sorry figure.‚Äù Ricardo's victory over Bosanquet was in fact far from complete. His arguments concerning money issued on loan were resurrected intact during the Currency School/Banking School debates of the 1840s. The issue has remained unsettled ever since, and featured prominently in the Monetarist/Keynesian debates of the 1960s and 1970s. Beginning in the 1980s, the real-bills viewpoint has seen a small revival of interest (e.g., Sargent (1982), Sproul (1998)). It appears that Bosanquet's writings, like the man himself, are entitled to more respect than they have received. Bibliography *A Letter to W. Manning, Esq.

Kristj√°n started kart racing at 14, the age when Icelandic law allows young drivers to start racing and training in karts. He is the first ever driver to emerge from Icelandic motorsport (karting) into full international formula racing series. Kristj√°n's first full single seater racing season was with Carlin Motorsport in the 2008 British Formula Three season. Kristj√°n Einar is currently racing in the 2009 European F3 Open season, with Team West- Tec.  Karting career  Einar karting. Kristj√°n Einar was born in Gar√∞ab√¶r. He started racing Karts at 14, the age when Icelandic law allows young drivers to start racing and training in karts. As the only teenager competing, Kristj√°n finished up 8th in his debut season of 2003, starting his racing career rolling his gokart(Video) . The following year Kristjan was back racing, this time finishing the 2004 season in 4th place, the following season finishing second and the highlight being the 2006 season, winning the Icelandic National karting championship, and still holding that title to date.  Toyota Racing Series  Einar competing in the Toyota Racing Series To kick off his single-seater racing career, Kristj√°n Einar took advantage of southern hemisphere racing. During the winter break in the UK, and went to New Zealand to compete his first international races, finishing three rounds in the Toyota Racing Series; adding to his experience and getting quicker every lap, Einar earned the necessary racing experience he needed to start his season in the 2008 British Formula Three season. Einar teamed up with Matt Halliday at Triple X Motorsport.  2008 British Formula Three season  Einar competing during the 2008 British Formula Three season at Spa-Francorchamps. Kristj√°n Einar's first full racing season was the 2008 British Formula Three season with Carlin Motorsport. Kristj√°n's entry caught attention; a driver coming from a country with no racetrack and going almost directly from karting into the most successful British Formula Three team ever. Kristj√°n raced in the national class, and scored his first podium at the third round of the season, at Monza. Kristj√°n missed the last three races of the season, and finish seventh in the national class. Kristj√°n Einar was part of a very strong Carlin lineup, this helped him improve at a very fast pace, Kristj√°n's teammate in the national class was Andrew Meyrick and Carlin's championship lineup was Jaime Alguersuari, Brendon Hartley, Oliver Turvey and Sam Abay.  2009 European F3 Open season  For 2009, Kristj√°n inked a last minute deal with British racing team West-Tec, to race in the 2009 European F3 Open Championship, teaming up with team mates Christian Ebbesvik and Callum MacLeod. Kristj√°n races in a Dallara 306 chassis, allowing him to compete for both overall honors, and the Copa cup. Kristj√°n scored his first podium of the season at Donington Park.  Testing  Einar at an Atlantic Championship test. Kristj√°n Einar started his career testing Formula BMW with Carlin Motorsport for the second half of the 2007 season, aiming at entering the 2008 Formula BMW UK championship. When the FBMW UK changed into Formula BMW Europe Kristj√°n was offered to test more powerful cars with Carlin Motorsport and 7 months to the day he first drove a single seater, he was on the grid of the British Formula 3. After a full year of successful racing in Britain, Kristj√°n started looking elsewhere, and headed off to the USA, to test for the famous Newman Wachs Racing for the Atlantic Championship. After a good outing at Sebring International Raceway Kristj√°n was about to sign up for the 2009 Atlantic Championship season when sponsorship fell through. Kristj√°n Einar has always had a passion for sportscars, and in 2009 he was offered to try out the new Formula Le Mans Cup prototype at the Paul Ricard Circuit in France.

Life Clement spent his early career as a stock jobber and merchant. He served in Vienna as secretary to the Earl of Peterborough on his embassy to the Emperor from 1711‚Äì12, later acting as Peterborough‚Äôs charg√© d'affaires in Vienna from April 1711 until late 1714. What little is known of Clement‚Äôs life comes from the British Library‚Äôs collection of a series of letters saved by Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford. From the letters we learn that in 1712 Clement was almost 60 years old, that he had a son Daniel in London who attended Oxford University, and that he was married to Mary Hollister. Mary‚Äôs niece was Hannah Callowhill, who became William Penn‚Äôs second wife in 1696. Through Penn, Clement achieved some influence with Harley. Views on economics Clement‚Äôs writings concerned exchange and specialization, paper money, inflation, the money multiplier, scarcity of coins, and international trade. In A Discourse of the General Notions of Money, Trade, and Exchanges (1695), Clement explained the advantages of trade and specialization, and the importance of metallic money in facilitating trade. He advocated restricting imports as a means of preventing the export of bullion, and favored recoinage of worn British coins, while opposing devaluation of the coins. In A Dialogue Between a Countrey Gentleman and a Merchant Concerning the Falling of Guinea‚Äôs (1696), Clement argued against raising the value of Guineas, on the grounds that this would under-value silver and create arbitrage opportunities for currency traders, to the detriment of the nation. In Remarks Upon a late Ingenious Pamphlet (1718), Clement claimed that an unprecedented scarcity of silver had been caused by excessive British imports from India, a problem that would not be remedied \\"whilst people have the Vanity to give more for a tawdry Callicoe, than for a good silk of our own making.\\" The true remedy, he claimed, was for consumers to restrain their consumption of Indian goods. He also argued against \\"the absurd Opinion, that the Raising our Coin would advance its Value, and prevent its being carried out of the Nation\\". Clement‚Äôs most influential work was Faults on Both Sides (1710). This was a wide-ranging pamphlet that briefly discussed paper money and the influence of credit on trade. The pamphlet (widely attributed to Harley) produced several replies, which Clement answered in A Vindication of the Faults on Both Sides (1710). In it he dismissed what modern economists call the money multiplier, on the grounds that all bank-issued money is backed, either by the \\"valuable and sufficient security\\" offered as collateral by the borrower, or by the \\"proper stock\\" of the banker himself. Thus a banker need only take care to issue money to borrowers who offer sufficiently valuable collateral, and the value of the bank‚Äôs money will be preserved regardless of the quantity issued. This idea is the basis for what later became known as the real bills doctrine, and Clement was one of the earliest defenders of that doctrine. As recently as 1945 Clement‚Äôs exposition of real bills principles was attacked by Lloyd Mints, who incorrectly attributed Clement‚Äôs writings to \\"Richard\\" Harley. It is noteworthy that Clement‚Äôs exposition of the real bills doctrine required only that money be issued in exchange for sufficiently valuable collateral, and not necessarily to finance \\"productive\\" activity. Thus he avoided the errors of later writers, including Adam Smith, who thought that a policy of only issuing money for \\"real bills\\" would prevent inflation by making the quantity of money move in step with real output.

She is the second title Miss Trinidad & Tobago in the franchise's 44-year history to be of Chinese descent. When asked, \\"Is your Asian heritage an issue since you represent a country with an overwhelming African and Indian heritage?\\" Ayoung-Chee replied, \\"Trinidad & Tobago is unique in its ethnic make-up because it is a country with people of all races. I am of mixed origin, mainly Chinese, Indian and Caucasian, and although my particular mixture is a minority, I represent the unusual combination of ethnicities that defines us as a people.\\" Following her success as Miss Trinidad & Tobago, Ayoung-Chee went on to host a number of Caribbean television and web-based shows, including her own fashion show, Make It Yours. Ayoung-Chee had been involved in philanthropy since 2003, when she became a member of the TallMan Foundation. The foundation was established by her family for the empowerment of young people in underprivileged areas. Following her Miss Trinidad & Tobago title, she became more involved in charitable work. In 2008 the United Nations Association of Trinidad & Tobago (UNATT) asked Ayoung-Chee and Gabrielle Walcott to be spokeswomen and champions for the group. They both served during their reigns as Miss T&T;, and continue as members of UNATT, the NGO arm of the United Nations which aims to advocate for the United Nations and the Millennium Development Goals. Fashion designer During the Miss Universe pageant, Ayoung-Chee brought her design training and experience to her own wardrobe, most of which she designed and styled, and she decided to become a fashion designer as a result. She auditioned for and was accepted as a contestant on Season 9 of the American television show Project Runway in 2011. Ayoung-Chee had experience creating designs, but her tailoring had been done by others. Despite learning to sew only four months before auditioning for the program, she placed in the top three of most of the challenges, and eventually won the competition on October 27, 2011. Ayoung-Chee earned $100,000 from L'Oreal Paris to begin her own women's line, Pilar‚Äînamed after her deceased brother. She also was featured in a fashion spread in Marie Claire and received a $50,000 technology suite by HP and Intel with which to design and sell merchandise, as well as a partnership with Piperlime.com. She was also voted the fan favorite in a Twitter contest, for which she received another $10,000. Ayoung-Chee continued to design for Pilar and also founded a lingerie line, Anya de Rouge. In 2014 she appeared on reality show Under the Gunn, working with Tim Gunn to mentor other designers. She has hosted events and produced fashion for Trinidad's carnival, and has founded online store cANYAval, where she works with other designers creating clothing inspired by Trinidad's carnival. The store focuses on Monday Wear, or elaborate bathing suits worn on the day before carnival Tuesday. She is also a travel ambassador for Trinidad and Tobago. In 2019, Ayoung-Chee competed in Season 7 of Project Runway All Stars, that featured a cast of previous winners. She placed 10th overall.  Personal life  Ayoung-Chee met her longtime boyfriend Wyatt Gallery in 2006 at Trinidad carnival. Following the theft and release of their private sex tape in 2009, they ceased to appear in public together for some time, but continued dating. The two became engaged in 2015. The couple married in January 2018, and their son Ka√Øri Pilar Gallery was born on July 3, 2018.

The film, directed by Vincent McEveety, is based on The Golden Evenings of Summer, a 1971 novel written by Will Stanton. Plot Charley Appleby is a hardware store owner whose frugality and commitment to his job have enabled his family to avoid poverty during the Great Depression and Prohibition. However, his relationship with his children and wife Nettie (Cloris Leachman) is strained. They especially want to go to see the Chicago World's Fair. His growing sons Willie and Rupert (Vincent Van Patten and Scott Kolden) manage to find work in a junkyard owned by a man named Felix with ties to bootleggers, and his teenage daughter Leonora (Kathleen Cody) decides to elope with a young man named Ray (Kurt Russell), who seems untrustworthy. Charley is visited by a shabby-looking angel (Harry Morgan) who appears visible only to him. The angel tells Charley that his time will soon be up, and the shopkeeper decides to become religious, patch relations with his family, sell his business, and do the best he can to be a good father and husband before he dies. Charley's angel appears intermittently throughout the film, occasionally helping Charley, and occasionally causing mischief. The angel reveals his name as Roy Zerney. Charley is initially unsuccessful at effecting change. His gestures are incomprehensible to his wife and children, who see his sudden change of behavior as bizarre, particularly his decision to sell the store. Charley appears ostensibly insane whenever he speaks to, or looks for, the lingering angel who is visible only to him. When Charley tries to take money from his account in the bank, he learns from the banker Ernie (Edward Andrews) that the bank will be closing for a while and may be in danger of foreclosure. He must loan money to son-in-law Ray, and to his friend Pete (George Lindsey). Business tightens, and Charley is running out of time and money. However, Charley becomes an unlikely hero. His boys begin using a rickety Model T, unknowingly delivering illegal booze by Felix's request, and they are kidnapped and forced to drive away when the Chicago gangsters responsible for the operation are trying to flee the city. Charley personally chases them in the abandoned gangsters' car, dodging gunfire, and the police catch him presuming he is the criminal. While in prison, Roy tells Charley that today will probably be his last day on Earth. However, Charley's thoughts are still of his boys. When he returns home in the evening, Leonora and Ray return for an untimely visit just as the gangsters occupy his house and intend to take Charley's wife as another hostage. Charley defies them and defends his wife and kids with his own life. The fight ends when Charley and Ray, with the assistance of a timely appearance by Pete, succeed in defeating the gangsters and delivering them to the police. In the course of the fight, Charley was shot at point-blank range but miraculously receives no wound. For capturing the criminals, Charley receives a $5000 reward posted by Chicago's police department. Ernie appears as a representative of the town to honor Charley as a town hero and present him with a hotel reservation and tickets to the World's Fair. He also informs them that the bank examiner has approved the bank's credibility and that it will be reopening tomorrow. Pete has also returned to repay his debt. Charley, satisfied with the turn of events in his final day, says goodbye to his family and expects that he will still die, but Roy appears and reveals that the eleventh-hour decision in Heaven was to let Charley live. Roy physically intervened and pulled the bullet from the air, thus nullifying the prophecy and clarifying to Charley that he will live on, with an enriched outlook. Cast Reception Actress Cloris Leachman was nominated for a Golden Globe in the category of Best Actress in Musical/Comedy.

In other words, it extends the notion of a discrete game, where the players choose from a finite set of pure strategies. The continuous game concepts allows games to include more general sets of pure strategies, which may be uncountably infinite. In general, a game with uncountably infinite strategy sets will not necessarily have a Nash equilibrium solution. If, however, the strategy sets are required to be compact and the utility functions continuous, then a Nash equilibrium will be guaranteed; this is by Glicksberg's generalization of the Kakutani fixed point theorem. The class of continuous games is for this reason usually defined and studied as a subset of the larger class of infinite games (i.e. games with infinite strategy sets) in which the strategy sets are compact and the utility functions continuous. Formal definition Define the n-player continuous game G = (P, \\\\mathbf{C}, \\\\mathbf{U}) where ::P = {1, 2, 3,\\\\ldots, n} is the set of n\\\\, players, :: \\\\mathbf{C}= (C_1, C_2, \\\\ldots, C_n) where each C_i\\\\, is a compact set, in a metric space, corresponding to the i\\\\, th player's set of pure strategies, :: \\\\mathbf{U}= (u_1, u_2, \\\\ldots, u_n) where u_i:\\\\mathbf{C}\\\\to \\\\R is the utility function of player i\\\\, : We define \\\\Delta_i\\\\, to be the set of Borel probability measures on C_i\\\\, , giving us the mixed strategy space of player i. : Define the strategy profile \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} = (\\\\sigma_1, \\\\sigma_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\sigma_n) where \\\\sigma_i \\\\in \\\\Delta_i\\\\, Let \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}_{-i} be a strategy profile of all players except for player i. As with discrete games, we can define a best response correspondence for player i\\\\, , b_i\\\\ . b_i\\\\, is a relation from the set of all probability distributions over opponent player profiles to a set of player i's strategies, such that each element of :b_i(\\\\sigma_{-i})\\\\, is a best response to \\\\sigma_{-i}. Define :\\\\mathbf{b}(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}) = b_1(\\\\sigma_{-1}) \\\\times b_2(\\\\sigma_{-2}) \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times b_n(\\\\sigma_{-n}). A strategy profile \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}* is a Nash equilibrium if and only if \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}* \\\\in \\\\mathbf{b}(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}*) The existence of a Nash equilibrium for any continuous game with continuous utility functions can be proven using Irving Glicksberg's generalization of the Kakutani fixed point theorem.I.L. Glicksberg. A further generalization of the Kakutani fixed point theorem, with application to Nash equilibrium points. Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, 3(1):170‚Äì174, February 1952. In general, there may not be a solution if we allow strategy spaces, C_i\\\\, 's which are not compact, or if we allow non-continuous utility functions. =Separable games= A separable game is a continuous game where, for any i, the utility function u_i:\\\\mathbf{C}\\\\to \\\\R can be expressed in the sum-of-products form: : u_i(\\\\mathbf{s}) = \\\\sum_{k_1=1}^{m_1} \\\\ldots \\\\sum_{k_n=1}^{m_n} a_{i\\\\, ,\\\\, k_1\\\\ldots k_n} f_1(s_1)\\\\ldots f_n(s_n), where \\\\mathbf{s} \\\\in \\\\mathbf{C}, s_i \\\\in C_i, a_{i\\\\, ,\\\\, k_1\\\\ldots k_n} \\\\in \\\\R, and the functions f_{i\\\\, ,\\\\, k}:C_i \\\\to \\\\R are continuous. A polynomial game is a separable game where each C_i\\\\, is a compact interval on \\\\R\\\\, and each utility function can be written as a multivariate polynomial. In general, mixed Nash equilibria of separable games are easier to compute than non-separable games as implied by the following theorem: :For any separable game there exists at least one Nash equilibrium where player i mixes at most m_i+1\\\\, pure strategies.N. Stein, A. Ozdaglar and P.A. Parrilo. \\"Separable and Low-Rank Continuous Games\\". International Journal of Game Theory, 37(4):475‚Äì504, December 2008. https://arxiv.org/abs/0707.3462 Whereas an equilibrium strategy for a non- separable game may require an uncountably infinite support, a separable game is guaranteed to have at least one Nash equilibrium with finitely supported mixed strategies. Examples =Separable games= A polynomial game Consider a zero-sum 2-player game between players X and Y, with C_X = C_Y = \\\\left [0,1 \\\\right ] . Denote elements of C_X\\\\, and C_Y\\\\, as x\\\\, and y\\\\, respectively. Define the utility functions H(x,y) = u_x(x,y) = -u_y(x,y)\\\\, where :H(x,y)=(x-y)^2\\\\, . The pure strategy best response relations are: :b_X(y) = \\\\begin{cases} 1, & \\\\mbox{if }y \\\\in \\\\left [0,1/2 \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\text{ or }1, & \\\\mbox{if }y = 1/2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & \\\\mbox{if } y \\\\in \\\\left (1/2,1 \\\\right ] \\\\end{cases} :b_Y(x) = x\\\\, b_X(y)\\\\, and b_Y(x)\\\\, do not intersect, so there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium. However, there should be a mixed strategy equilibrium. To find it, express the expected value, v = \\\\mathbb{E} [H(x,y)] as a linear combination of the first and second moments of the probability distributions of X and Y: : v = \\\\mu_{X2} - 2\\\\mu_{X1} \\\\mu_{Y1} + \\\\mu_{Y2}\\\\, (where \\\\mu_{XN} = \\\\mathbb{E} [x^N] and similarly for Y). The constraints on \\\\mu_{X1}\\\\, and \\\\mu_{X2} (with similar constraints for y,) are given by Hausdorff as: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mu_{X1} \\\\ge \\\\mu_{X2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mu_{X1}^2 \\\\le \\\\mu_{X2} \\\\end{align} \\\\qquad \\\\begin{align} \\\\mu_{Y1} \\\\ge \\\\mu_{Y2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mu_{Y1}^2 \\\\le \\\\mu_{Y2} \\\\end{align} Each pair of constraints defines a compact convex subset in the plane. Since v\\\\, is linear, any extrema with respect to a player's first two moments will lie on the boundary of this subset. Player i's equilibrium strategy will lie on : \\\\mu_{i1} = \\\\mu_{i2} \\\\text{ or } \\\\mu_{i1}^2 = \\\\mu_{i2} Note that the first equation only permits mixtures of 0 and 1 whereas the second equation only permits pure strategies. Moreover, if the best response at a certain point to player i lies on \\\\mu_{i1} = \\\\mu_{i2}\\\\, , it will lie on the whole line, so that both 0 and 1 are a best response. b_Y(\\\\mu_{X1},\\\\mu_{X2})\\\\, simply gives the pure strategy y = \\\\mu_{X1}\\\\, , so b_Y\\\\, will never give both 0 and 1. However b_x\\\\, gives both 0 and 1 when y = 1/2. A Nash equilibrium exists when: : (\\\\mu_{X1}*, \\\\mu_{X2}*, \\\\mu_{Y1}*, \\\\mu_{Y2}*) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/4)\\\\, This determines one unique equilibrium where Player X plays a random mixture of 0 for 1/2 of the time and 1 the other 1/2 of the time.

Life Simon studied under Jacques Maritain at the Institut Catholique de Paris.There are three readily available sources for biographical information on Simon. The first is the biography at the Center for Ethics and Culture of the University of Notre Dame. The second is a biographical address given by Anthony O. Simon at the 2004 conference of Thomas International The third is in French, see : http://transatlantica.revues.org/6842. He taught at the Institut Catholique de Lille from 1930 to 1938. In 1938, he came to the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, as a visiting professor. He was unable to return to France because of World War II, and after the war he remained as a professor at Notre Dame until 1948. He then joined the Committee on Social Thought, at the University of Chicago. He remained at the University of Chicago until retiring in 1958 due to illness. He died of cancer in South Bend, Indiana on May 11, 1961.McMorrow, G. J. \\"Yves Rene Marie Simon.\\" New Catholic Encyclopedia, Gale, 2003. Biography in Context. Accessed 29 Sept. 2017.

Simon left many materials unfinished at his death, and many of his publications have only appeared after his death. His son, Anthony O. Simon, has taken on the role of director of the Yves R. Simon Institute, which contributes to the effort to publish such materials. Simon's papers are at the University of Notre Dame. Scholarship Simon trained to work in the realm of Thomism or scholastic philosophy. (But he was perhaps more open-minded than some neo-scholastics: according to John Dawson's biography of G√∂del, Simon attended Kurt G√∂del's logic lectures at Notre Dame in the late 1930s.) Thus, in 1955, he was one of several contributors to the translating of John of St. Thomas into English.The Material Logic of John of St. Thomas: Basic Treatises, trans. Yves R. Simon, John J. Glanville and G. Donald Hollenhorst (University of Chicago Press 1955). However, he is better known for his work in moral and political philosophy. There, he defended the traditional Thomistic account of moral action and the virtues. He was an ardent defender of the proposition that this traditional account was compatible with liberal democracy in the West, arguing that French Catholics had erred in holding that the Catholic faith supported their adherence to monarchy, √† la Action Fran√ßaise.

It is located in the Mount Waddington Regional District. The closest major community to Haddington Island is Port McNeill. Geology Haddington Island is a member in the chain of eroded volcanoes that run from Brooks Peninsula northeastward across Vancouver Island to Port McNeill, called the Alert Bay Volcanic Belt. The existence of felsite and andesite at Haddington Island suggests it might have formed 3.7 million years ago as the Juan de Fuca and Explorer Plate to its west subducted under the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone. As the ocean crust of the Juan de Fuca and the Explorer Plate melts, it creates magma that penetrates the crust, causing periodic eruptions of the volcanoes. The western end of the Alert Bay Volcanic Belt is now approximately northeast of the Nootka Fault, which separates the Explorer and Juan de Fuca plates. However, at the time of its formation Haddington Island may have been coincident with the subducted plate boundary. Also, the timing of volcanism corresponds to shifts of plate motion and changes in the locus of volcanism along the Pemberton and Garibaldi volcanic fronts. This brief interval of plate motion adjustment approximately 3.5 million years ago may have triggered the generation of basaltic magma along the descending plate edge. Although commonly referred to as andesite, by chemical composition the Haddington Island volcanic rocks are in fact dacite. The rock has a very fine grained to aphanitic texture, and has a light blue- grey to a warm brown-grey range in colour. The groundmass comprises 80-85% plagioclase feldspar, with lesser quartz, biotite and magnetite. Small, 1‚Äì2 mm plagioclase phenocrysts are distributed through the rock mass, and form approximately 1% of its volume.  Quarrying  The grey to bluff andesite on Haddington Island is considered by many to be British Columbia's finest building stone because it is easily profiled and carved. Some of British Columbia's landmark buildings were faced with Haddington Island andesite, including the Hotel Vancouver and the British Columbia Parliament Buildings.Natural Landscape Stones - Bedrock Granite Sales, Andesite, Basalt, Rhyolite, Sandstone - Vancouver, BC, Canada Further information on the historic use of andesite on buildings in Vancouver can be found in the article Andesite in Vancouver Matters, BlueImprint Books, 2008 by Rob Brownie and Annabel Vaughan. The Haddington Island Quarry initially operated between 1896 and 1966. It was reopened in 2004 by Haddington Island Stoneworks of Vancouver, BC.  History  The island was named after Thomas Haddington. A provincial ferry, the Queen of Prince Rupert, ran up on the rocks here in 1967.

At times, through a historical perspective, the film brings to light the elements and trends that may have been responsible for the origins of ghostriding. The documentary also explores the demographic that most appeals to this art form and the lifestyles of those that regularly participate in it. In its most basic definition, ghostriding the whip involves a car in motion with no one operating it. The closest thing that can come to describing ghostriding the whip is perhaps the Chinese fire drill that was popular back in the 1950s. However, unlike the Chinese fire drill the car remains in motion with no urgency to get back into it. In fact, the driver and passengers will walk next to the car as it casually rolls down the street, with thumping music playing at extreme volumes as the riders participate in free-form dance in close proximity to the car. Often the occupants of the vehicle will climb on the hood and roof, expressing themselves in dance high atop the automobile. It appears that ghostriding is greatly influenced by the Hyphy (pronounced Hi-Fee) movement, also originating from the San Francisco bay area by former rap great Mac Dre. Hyphy, meaning \\"rambunctious,\\" is yet another movement that has helped define hip-hop in the bay area. Hyphy music is known for its gritty and pounding rhythms. Mac Dre is somewhat of a central character to the film, as he is considered to many as the forefather of a great many trends that had come out of the bay area during his rap reign. Things like Thizz, Hyphy, Ghostriding the Whip are all attributed to the rap star that was murdered in 2004 after performing a show in Kansas City, Missouri.

It passes through Skull Valley, and was added to the state highway system in 1998 to prevent the Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians from using their reservation to store nuclear waste. Route description SR-196 begins at the junction with SR-199 near the control gate at Dugway Proving Grounds. The route travels north through the Skull Valley Indian Reservation and past the ghost town of Iosepa; also, mostly the east side of Skull Valley, at the west foothills of the Stansbury Mountains. The route ends at the junction with I-80 at the Rowley Junction interchange. History Skull Valley Road, then an unimproved dirt trail, was part of the Lincoln Highway from its creation in 1913 until about 1920, when an improved gravel road over Johnson Pass (present SR-199) was built with the help of a donation from Carl G.

This Konik shows the dark face mask and frosted mane common to primitive horses. Primitive markings are a group of hair coat markings and qualities seen in several equine species, including horses, donkeys, and asses. In horses, they are associated with primitive breeds, though not limited to such breeds. The markings are particularly associated with the dun coat color family. All dun and non-dun 1 horses possess at least the dorsal stripe, but the presence of the other primitive markings varies. Other common markings may include horizontal striping on the legs, transverse striping across the shoulders, and lighter guard hairs along the edges of a dark mane and tail. Origin A cave painting of a wild horse, Lascaux The dun coat and attendant primitive or \\"dun factor\\" markings reflect the wild type coat and are observed in all equine species. Cave paintings depict horses as being dun and with the primitive markings. The Przewalski's horse, once considered to be the last remaining true wild horse, is also dun-colored with primitive markings, though its domesticated ancestors the Botai horses are found to also have carried Leopard https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/horse-origin-mysterious-domestic- dna-analysis-przewalskis-botai-domesticated-a8224121.html. So, too, are horse breeds such as the Konik and the Heck horse, \\"bred back\\" to resemble the now- extinct tarpan, many of which are grullo or mouse dun in color. While no dun horse is without a dorsal stripe, primitive markings also sometimes occur on horses of other colors, particularly those with sooty characteristics and newborn foals. Primitive markings in horses are an example of atavism: preservation of or reversion to ancestral type. While primitive markings are closely linked with the dun coat colors, the variations of expression and presence in non-dun horses suggest that the markings themselves may be governed by a separate genetic mechanism. Dorsal stripe Of equids other than horses, all except the mountain zebra show a distinct dorsal stripe. Among domesticated donkeys, most have a black dorsal stripe, though it can be difficult to see on melanistic individuals. In the African wild ass, the dorsal stripe is thin but distinct and black. In Przewalski's horse, the dorsal stripe is usually dark brown, while it is black in the bred-back tarpan. In the plains zebra, the dorsal stripe is narrow and edged by white, while in Grevy's zebra, it is quite bold. The dorsal stripes of the onager and kiang are dark brown and especially vivid. The dorsal stripe reflects the original coat color of the horse. Those on bay duns may be black or reddish, while those on red duns are distinctly red. Dorsal stripes on dun horses with the cream gene seem unaffected by cream: smoky black-duns (\\"smoky grullas\\"), buckskin-duns (\\"dunskins\\"), and palomino-duns (\\"dunalinos\\") have black, brown, or red dorsal stripes, as well. So-called \\"countershading dorsals\\", which are dorsal stripes occurring on non-dun horses, are a darker shade of the horse's coat color. Countershading dorsal stripes may be seasonal, waning, or disappearing altogether during a particular time of year. Leg bars and markings Leg bars and \\"zippers\\": This horse's legs have been shaved. Also called zebra bars, tiger stripes, or garters, leg bars are the most common accessory to the dorsal stripe. Leg bars are most commonly seen on or above the knees and hocks, and reflect the underlying coat color. Leg bars on bay duns are black within the points, and reddish above them. Leg bars are prominent on Grevy's zebras and mountain zebras, and African wild asses also have well-defined black leg bars below the forearm and gaskin on a white or pale background. However, as in horses, expression of leg bars seems to vary widely among donkeys, plains zebras, and Przewalski's horses, while they appear very seldom or not at all in onagers and kiangs. Leg markings may also take the form of blotches, patches, marbling, mottling, or spotting. Shoulder stripe Transverse shoulder stripes are common on asses. The shoulder stripe is a transverse or \\"vertical\\" marking that usually crosses the withers and extends down the shoulders. Donkeys are known for their distinct shoulder stripe, which, when combined with the dorsal stripe, is sometimes called a \\"cross\\". It is more marked in breeds closest to the wild African ancestors of the domestic donkey.Roger Blench (2013). Wild asses and donkeys in Africa: interdisciplinary evidence for their biogeography, history and current use. Paper presented at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, 9 May 2012 (revised version, 2013). Accessed July 2014. Indistinct or poorly defined markings in these regions are often called neck or shoulder smudges, patches, or shadows. Especially large markings are called neck or shoulder capes. The kiang exhibits some shoulder smudging. Other markings Dorsal stripe and pale guard hairs on the dock of a domestic horse Less common primitive markings include vertically oriented markings which may be arranged as bars, fine striping, or smudges. Such markings include: * Dorsal barbs are suggestions of vertical striping on either side of the dorsal stripe. They may be so closely placed that they resemble secondary dorsal stripes. Dorsal barbs are also called fishboning. * Rib marks are extended, perhaps interrupted dorsal barbs. They are usually fine, faint stripes and may be responsible for some horses classified as brindle. * A ventral stripe runs along the midline of the underbelly of the horse. They are usually wide and are uncommon. * Zippers are lines of paler hairs running vertically along the back of the animal's leg, usually from the hoof to the knee. Because they consist of paler hairs and are found where horses often have feathering, zippers are considered by some to be guard hairs. * Bider markings are only known in Przewalski's horses and native Mongolian horses from nearby. The bider is mostly symmetrical and found near the front of each shoulder, near the chest. The size of the bider ranges from a small dark spot to a large, webbed cape of darker skin and hair. =Head markings= Many primitive markings may occur on the animal's head. * Cobwebbing, also called spiderwebbing, consists of fine, radial stripes on the forehead. Among other equids, cobwebbing is most apparent in zebras. * Face masks are areas of darker hair on the lower half of the face. These are very common. * Ear marks are dark markings on the ears, whether the marking involves only the rim, half the back of the ear, or distinct barring or striping on the back of the ear. These are seen almost universally throughout Equus. * Ear tips are tiny white or paler tips on the ear. * Eye spots are found around the eyes. They are quite rare, but may be across the eye, over it, or under it. Guard hairs The long-roached manes of Fjords clearly show the light, outside primitive guard hairs. The dorsal stripe runs through the mane and tail of a dun horse, so the center of the mane and tail are darker. The outer edges may be significantly lighter, even close to white. These paler hairs are seen at the base of the tail and on the edges of the mane. The presence of guard hairs may also be called \\"frosting\\". Such characteristics are very visible among the Fjord horses, which have their sandwich-patterned manes shaved short and upright. The presence of paler guard hairs on the mane and tail is seen throughout Equus. Primitive markings in non-dun horses Less distinct primitive markings can also occur on non-dun horses, even in breeds which are not known to have any dun individuals. The most common primitive marking found is a dorsal stripe. Most non-dun horses do not have darker primitive markings, but some do. This is because there are two types of non-dun, called non-dun1 and non-dun2. Non-dun 1 removes the diluting effect of dun, but keeps the primitive markings, while non-dun 2 removes both the diluting effect and the primitive markings. The non-dun1 allele is over 40,000 years old, while non-dun2 is relatively recent, and is thought to have first appeared within the past several thousand years. Dorsal stripes and other primitive markings on non-dun horses are commonly called countershading dorsals. Countershaded animals - be they horses or birds - appear two- dimensional and are much more difficult to see. Primitive markings on non-duns can be seasonal, visible only when the horse is shedding its coat. Such primitive markings also seem to be heritable, as horses with prominent countershading dorsals often produce offspring with the same. =Primitive markings in foals= Many foals, particularly if they are buckskin, smoky black, or black, are born with primitive markings such as dorsal stripes and leg bars that disappear after the foal coat sheds. Such horses are sometimes mistakenly registered as dun. This error seems particularly common in foals that turn gray.

History  The Ixworth was created in 1932 by Reginald Appleyard, who also created the Silver Appleyard Duck, at his poultry farm in the village of Ixworth in Suffolk. It was bred from white Sussex, white Minorca, white Orpington, Jubilee, Indian Game and white Indian Game chickens, with the intention of creating a dual purpose breed, a fast-growing high-quality meat bird with reasonable egg-laying ability. An Ixworth bantam was created in 1938; Appleyard thought it better than the standard-sized bird. In the 1970s the Ixworth almost disappeared; it has since gradually recovered. It is a rare breed: in 2007 it was listed by the FAO as \\"endangered-maintained\\". In 2008 it was listed as \\"Category 2: endangered\\" by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, and in 2014 was on the Trust's list of native poultry breeds at risk.  Characteristics  The plumage of the Ixworth is pure white. The comb is of pea type; it and the face, earlobes and wattles are brilliant red. The eyes are bright orange or red. The beak, shanks, feet, skin and flesh are all white.

One is owned by the Staten Island Railway (SIR) of New York City, and the other is managed by Conrail Shared Assets Operations along the Northeast Corridor (NEC) right of way.  Staten Island Railway  The Staten Island Railway operates a 19-track freight yard. It lies west of the Chemical Coast in Elizabeth and east of the combined NEC and North Jersey Coast Lines in Linden. The SIR line's grade separated flyover of the NEC is located just north of the Linden station. It is also situated between U.S. Route 1/9 and Interstate 95, just south of Interstate 278 and north of ConocoPhillips' Linden Terminal facility which is part of its Bayway Refinery complex. ExpressRail traffic from Howland Hook Marine Terminal and the containers from the Staten Island Transfer Station at the site of the former Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island may pass through Linden Yard. Chemical traffic from the Chemical Coast line may also use Linden Yard before heading west to either the Raritan Valley Line or the Conrail Lehigh Line. The SIR Line from Cranford to Staten Island over the Arthur Kill Bridge was originally constructed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad from 1889 to 1890.  Northeast Corridor  The Conrail Linden Yard is a 16-track freight yard located between West Linden Avenue and the Northeast Corridor Line.

Guy √âder de Beaumanoir de la Haye (1573 - September 1602), also known by his nicknames La Fontenelle or Ar Bleiz (the \\"Wolf\\" in Breton), was a French nobleman, seigneur de Le Vieux-Bourg, de Saint-Gildas et du Leslay, and a warlord active in Brittany in the late 16th century. Life Born into an old family of Brittany in 1573 in the parish of Bothoa (today called Saint- Nicolas-du-P√©lem), his family lived in Beaumanoir Manor at Leslay near Quintin (C√¥tes-d'Armor). Followed by a group of young nobles, he took advantage of the weakening of the royal authority during the War of the Holy League, which initially seemed to embrace the Catholic party in going to find the Duke of Maine, Lieutenant General of France in Orl√©ans. Returning to his native area, he ravaged the Tr√©gor and Cornouaille regions and entered into legend by his cruelty. Commanding a band of 400 riders, he engaged in murders, rapes, massacres and looting. After ransacking the towns of Penmarc'h and Pont-Croix he is reported to have collected an enormous booty that was piled on the island of Tristan at Douarnenez in which he made his main quarters. He forced the nearby inhabitants into demolishing their own houses to build up the fortifications to his lair. Besieged by thousands of enraged peasants, he is reported to have killed 1,500 of them in a single day. Regardless, in 1598 he was included in the treaty that Duke Merc≈ìur made with Henri IV and won the king's pardon for his crimes. However, he was accused of having participated in the conspiracy of the Duke of Biron for the benefit of Spaniards, and the Parliament of Paris condemned him to the agony of the breaking wheel for high treason. He was broken on the wheel alive at Paris at the Place de Gr√®ve in September 1602. In 1845 Th√©odore Hersart de la Villemarqu√© published a Breton song entitled Fontanella which tells the story of the abduction of Marie Le Chevoir of Coad√©lan, daughter of a marquis and wealthy heiress who was aged only 8 or 9 years that he would look for in the region of Brest. It is true that he took her from M√©zarnou Manor in Ploun√©venter in 1595 and married her and that she later claimed herself as his widow at the time of his trial and execution.Kort, Fons de, Mesarnou en Ploun√©venter, Brest: la Soci√©t√© Finist√©rienne d'Histoire et d'Arch√©ologie, 1988, pp 20-21 References Category:1573 births Category:1602 deaths Category:People from C√¥tes-d'Armor Category:French people of the French Wars of Religion Category:People executed by breaking wheel Category:Executed people from Brittany Category:People executed for treason against France Category:17th-century executions by France ","title":"Guy √âder de La Fontenelle"},{"id":"18154638","text":"Sandra Buckler is a former director of communications for the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada under Conservative Party of Canada Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

Web2py allows web developers to program dynamic web content using Python. Web2py is designed to help reduce tedious web development tasks, such as developing web forms from scratch, although a web developer may build a form from scratch if required.Web2py (2013), What is web2py?, web2py.com, retrieved 11 October 2013, Web2py was originally designed as a teaching tool with emphasis on ease of use and deployment. Therefore, it does not have any project-level configuration files. The design of web2py was inspired by the Ruby on Rails and Django frameworks. Like these frameworks, web2py focuses on rapid development, favors convention over configuration approach and follows a model‚Äìview‚Äìcontroller (MVC) architectural pattern. Overview Web2py is a full-stack framework in that it has built-in components for all major functions, including: * HTTP requests, HTTP responses, cookies, sessions; * multiple protocolsWeb2py speaks multiple protocols since v1.63 HTML/XML, REST, ATOM and RSS, RTF and CSV, JSON, JSON- RPC and XML-RPC, AMF-RPC (Flash/Flex), and SOAP;Using SOAP with web2py * CRUD API; * multiple authentication mechanisms and role-based access control; * database abstraction layer (DAL) that dynamically generates SQL and runs on multiple compatible database backends; * RAM, disk, and memcached-based caching for scalability; * internationalization support; * jQuery for Ajax and UI effects; * automatic logging of errors with context. Web2py encourages sound software engineering practices such as * the model‚Äìview‚Äìcontroller (MVC) pattern; * self-submissionWriting Smart Web-based Forms of web forms; * server-side sessions; * safe handling of uploaded files. Web2py uses the WSGI protocol, the Python-oriented protocol for communication between web server and web applications. It also provides handlers for CGI and the FastCGI protocols, and it includes the multi-threaded, SSL-enabled RocketRocket Web Server wsgiserver. Distinctive features = Web-based integrated development environment (IDE) = All development, debugging, testing, maintenance and remote database administration can (optionally) be performed without third party tools, via a web interface, itself a web2py application. Internationalization (adding languages and writing translations) can also be performed from this IDE. Each application has an automatically generated database administrative interface, similar to Django. The web IDE also includes web-based testing. Applications can also be created from the command line or developed with other IDEs.Web2py online IDE with It's All Text! Firefox addon and Ulipad (open source Python IDE) Further debugging options:How to debug Web2py applications? * Wing IDE allows graphical debugging of web2py applicationsWing IDE supports debugging for web2py as you interact with it from your web browser, you can inspect and modify variables, make function calls etc. * Eclipse/PyDev ‚Äî Eclipse with the Aptana PyDev plugin ‚Äî supports web2py as well.Eclipse/PyDev supports debugging for web2pyUsing web2py on Eclipse * The extensible pdb debugger is a module of Python's standard library. * With the platform-independent open-source Winpdb debugger, one can perform remote debuggingWith Winpdb one can do remote debugging over TCP/IP over TCP/IP, through encrypted connection.Encrypted communication in Winpdb The Hello World program with web2py in its simplest form (simple web pageSimplest web page with web2py: \\"Hello World\\" example with no template) looks like: def hello(): return 'Hello World' Web2py includes pure Python-based template language, with no indentation requirements and a server-side Document Object Model (DOM). The template system works without web2py.How to use web2py templates without web2py Joomla 1.x templates can be converted to web2py layouts.Using Joomla templates with web2py Web2py also includes two markup libraries: the markdown2 text-to-HTML filter, which converts Markdown markup to HTML on the fly; and markmin which is inspired by markdown but supports tables, html5 video/audio and oembed protocol. A controller without a view automatically uses a generic view that render the variables returned by the controller, enabling the development of an application's business logic before writing HTML. The \\"Hello World\\" example using a default template: def hello(): return dict(greeting='Hello World') The dict() output of an action is automatically rendered in HTML if the page is request with a .html extension, in JSON if the page is requested with a .json extension, in XML if requested with .xml. It supports other protocols including jsonp, rss, ics, google maps, etc. and is extensible. Here is a more complex code example which defines a table, and exposes a grid to logged in users: db.define_table('thing',Field('name',notnull=True)) @auth.requires_login() def hello(): return dict(grid = SQLFORM.grid(db.thing)) =Ticketing system= Each web2py application comes with a ticketing system: * If an error occurs, it is logged and a ticket is issued to the user. That allows error tracking. * Errors and source code are accessible only to the administrator, who can search and retrieve errors by date or client-IP. No error can result in code being exposed to the users. =Portable cron= Cron is a mechanism for creating and running recurrent tasks in background. It looks for an application-specific crontab file which is in standard crontab format. Three modes of operation are available: * Soft cron: cron routines are checked after web page content has been served, does not guarantee execution precision. For unprivileged Apache CGI/WSGI installs. * Hard cron: a cron thread gets started on web2py startup. For Windows and Rocket/standalone web2py installs. * System cron: cron functions get force-called from the command line, usually from the system crontab. For Unix/Linux systems and places where the cron triggers need to be executed even if web2py is not running at the moment; also good for CGI/WSGI installs if you have access to the system crontab. =Scheduler= Since version 2.3 the use of cron is discouraged since web2py comes with a master/worker scheduler. Jobs can be defined in models and are scheduled by creating an entry in the database. Users can start work processes who pickup and execute tasks in background. The schedule is better than cron because it allows to specify more parameters (start time, stop time, number of repetitions, number of trials in case of error) and do a better job at running within constant resource utilization. =Bytecode distribution= Web2py can compile web applications for distribution in bytecode compiled form, without source code. Unlike frameworks that use specialized template languages for their views, Web2py can also compile the view code into bytecode, since it is pure Python code. =Global Environment= Web2py is unique in the world of Python web frameworks because models and controllers are executed, not imported. They are not modules. They are executed in a single global environment which is initialized at each http request. This design decision has pros and cons. The major pros is the ease of development, specifically for rapid prototyping. Another pro is that all the objects defined within this environment are cleanly reset at each http request and never shares across requests. This means the developer does not need to worry about changing the state of an object (for example the readable attribute of a database field) or worry about a change leaking to other concurrent requests or other applications. A third advantage is that web2py allows the coexistence of multiple applications under the same instance without conflicts even if they use different versions of the same modules or different modules with the same name. The main disadvantage of the global environment is that model files and controller files are not modules and the order of execution matters (although it can be specified using conditional models). Naming conflict is more likely to occur than in normal Python modules. Some standard Python development tools may not understand objects defined in models and controllers. Moreover, developers must be aware that code in models is executed at every request and this may cause a performance penalty. Nothing in web2py prevents developers from using and importing normal Python modules (model-less approach) and for this purpose web2py provides a thread local object (current) to facilitate access to objects associated to the current request. Yet, in this case, the developer has to be aware of the same pitfalls that other frameworks incur into: changing the state of an object defined in a module may affect other concurrent requests. Another con is that, because models and controllers are not class-based, efficient code reuse becomes more difficult, particularly as the inability to inherit from a parent controller (e.g. the ApplicationController in Ruby on Rails) means that common controller functionality must be referenced repeatedly across all controller files. Supported environments = Operating systems, Python versions & implementations, virtual machines, hardware = web2py runs on Windows, Windows CE phones, Mac, Unix/Linux, Google App Engine, Amazon EC2, and almost any web hosting via Python 2.7/3.5/3.6/pypy.http://web2py.com/init/default/what The current binary version of web2py (for Windows or Mac) includes Python 2.7, but the source version can be run on 2.7 and 3.5+. Support for Python 2.6 has been dropped on 2017. web2py since v1.64.0 runs unmodified on Java with Jython 2.5, without any known limitation.Web2py runs fully on Java and J2EE using Jython web2py code can run with IronPython on .NET.Web2py runs with IronPython on .NET, with limitations Limitations: * no csv module (so no database I/O); * no third party database drivers (not even SQLite, so no databases at all); * no built- in web server (unless you cripple it by removing signals and logging). The web2py binary willMySQL with web2py Windows binary on a USB thumb-drive run from a USB drive or a portable hard drive without dependencies, like Portable Python. =Web servers= Web2py can service requests via HTTP and HTTPS with its built-in Rocket server,How to run the built-in SSL server with Apache,Web2py with Apache and mod_ssl Lighttpd,Web2py with Lighttpd and FastCGI Cherokee,Web2py with Cherokee Hiawatha, Nginx and almost any other web server through CGI, FastCGI, WSGI, mod_proxy,Apache Module mod_proxyWeb2py with mod_proxyWeb2py with mod_proxy and mod_proxy_html and/or mod_python. =IDEs and debuggers= While a number of web2py developers use text editors such as Vim, Emacs or TextMate Web2py also has a built-in web-based IDE. Others prefer more specialized tools providing debugging, refactoring, etc. *Aptana Studio with integrated PyDev *Eclipse with PyDev *Eric with built-in debugger.Eric IDE Project *Wing IDEUsing Wing IDE with web2py *Microsoft Visual Studio with Python Tools for Visual Studio * Pycharm3 has Web2py framework support Database handling The database abstraction layer (DAL) of web2py dynamically and transparently generates SQL queries and runs on multiple compatible database backend without the need for database-specific SQL commands (though SQL commands can be issued explicitly). SQLite is included in Python and is the default web2py database. A connection string change allows connection to Firebird, IBM DB2, Informix, Ingres, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Google App Engine (GAE) with some caveats. Specialities: * Multiple database connections. * Automatic table creates and alters. * Automatic transactions. * Distributed transactions: ** Since web2py v1.17 with PostgreSQL v8.2 and later,Distributed transactions with PostgreSQLDistributed transactions with PostgreSQL ‚Äî further details because it provides API for two-phase commits. ** Since web2py v1.70.1 with Firebird and MySQL (experimental). * GAE is not a relational store, but web2py emulates certain operations. The DAL is fast, at least comparable with SQLAlchemy and Storm.ORM Benchmark Web2py implements a DAL, not an ORM. An ORM maps database tables into classes representing logical abstractions from the database layer (e.g., a User class or a PurchaseOrder class), and maps records into instances of those classes. The DAL instead maps database tables and records into instances of classes representing sets and records instead of higher-level abstractions. It has very similar syntax to an ORM but it is faster, and can map almost any SQL expressions into DAL expressions. The DAL can be used independently of the rest of web2py.How to use web2py DAL without web2py Here are some examples of DAL syntax: db = DAL('postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db', pool_size=10) db.define_table('person',Field('name'),Field('image','upload')) db.person.insert(name='Martin', image=open('filename.png')) rows = db((db.person.name'Martin')db.person.name.contains('T')).select(orderby=db.person.name.lower()) The latest version of the DAL has support for 2D GIS functions with Spatialite and PostGIS. The current API are experimental because of a possible move to 3D APIs. =Automatic database migrations= web2py supports database migrations‚Äîchange the definition of a table and web2py ALTERs the table accordingly. Migrations are automatic, but can be disabled for any table, and migration is typically disabled when an application is ready for live distribution. Migrations and migration attempts are logged, documenting the changes. Limitations: * SQLite cannot alter table and change a column type, but rather simply stores new values according to the new type. * GAE has no concept of alter-table, so migrations are limited.

Irwin started his career as a defender, and played in the back pocket when Essendon won the 1923 premiership. In 1924, he moved from the backline to the forward pocket, kicking 10 goals against St Kilda, at Windy Hill, on 14 June 1924. He finished 1924 with 28 goals and in 1925 and 1926 kicked 27 and 30 goals, respectively.

Come 2 My House was Khan's first full-length album since 1992's The Woman I Am, due to the Warner Bros. Records label postponing and eventually cancelling the release of her tenth album Dare You to Love Me (1995).  Overview  The album included two single releases; \\"Spoon\\" and \\"Don't Talk 2 Strangers\\" - neither of which charted. The album however made a brief appearance on Billboard's R&B; Albums chart, peaking at #49. After first covering Prince's 1979 ballad \\"I Feel for You\\" on her 1984 album of the same name and turning it into a sample-heavy hip-hop anthem and a million-selling hit single, then recording his \\"Sticky Wicked\\" (produced by Prince himself) and \\"Eternity\\" on her 1988 album CK, followed by the recording of the track \\"Pain\\" with Prince for the Dare You to Love Me album in 1995 and earlier in 1998 appearing with both Prince and legendary bassist and composer Larry Graham (Sly & The Family Stone, Graham Central Station) to promote each of their CD's on the independent NPG label, Khan and Prince finally teamed up for their first full-length project together; Come 2 My House. While Prince co-produced all tracks but one and also helped write ten of the songs, even two of them solo, the set was very much a team effort. As Khan pointed out in the liner notes, Come 2 My House was a different album for her because it was the first time that she was not only the producer but had also composed or co-written the majority of the songs on one of her albums. During most of her career she had with a few exceptions on select albums recorded either songs written especially for her or cover versions. On Come 2 My House no less than ten out of thirteen tracks were new compositions penned by herself, either with Prince or Larry Graham, other longtime collaborators like vocalists Mark Stevens and Sandra St. Victor, Robert D. Palmer, Howard McCrary or The New Power Generation member Kirk Johnson. Two of the songs were however cover versions; Prince's \\"Don't Talk 2 Strangers\\" from 1996's Girl 6 soundtrack and Graham Central Station's classic hit \\"Hair\\" from their eponymous 1974 album. Among the musicians contributing were several members of The New Power Generation, such as vocalist Marva King, keyboardist Kirk Johnson, bassist Rhonda Smith, drummer/percussionist Michael Bland, the horn section Hornheadz (previously known as the NPG Hornz) as well as Prince's former wife Mayte Garcia. Rapper Queen Latifah made a special guest appearance on \\"Pop My Clutch\\".  Critical reception  Despite receiving glowing reviews and wide variety - the album's funk, smooth ballads, gospel, hip-hop and bass-heavy beats were combined with Khan's lyrics, which were both seductive,(title track), spiritual, political (\\"Democrazy\\"), autobiographical (\\"This Crazy Life Of Mine\\"), provocative and humorous (I'll never open my legs again/to a man who's insecure, from \\"Never B Another Fool\\") - the Come 2 My House project was met with general indifference by musical audiences and is often regarded as Khan's second lost album. As of 2005 it has sold 76,000 copies in United States according to Nielsen SoundScan.  Track listing  # \\"Come 2 My House\\" (Khan, Prince, Howard McCrary, Robert D.

Samtgemeinden are local government associations of municipalities, equivalent to the √Ñmter in Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg- Vorpommern, and Brandenburg, and the Verbandsgemeinden in Rhineland- Palatinate.  Function  A Samtgemeinde is a government body composed of a collective association of gemeinden (municipalities), the lowest level of official territorial division in Germany. Samtgemeinden were introduced in Lower Saxony on 4 March 1955 upon the adoption of the Lower Saxony Municipal Code (Nieders√§chsische Gemeindeordnung), which was based on British administrative structures at the time. According to ¬ß71 paragraph 1 Lower Saxony law on local government, a Samtgemeinde should have at least 7,000 inhabitants. Approximately 80% of the municipalities in Lower Saxony have united to Samtgemeinden. The Samtgemeinde executes many local government administrative duties for its member municipalities, including land use planning, wastewater disposal, social security, organisation of cemeteries and fire stations, sponsorship of elementary schools, the construction of local connecting roads, equipment and entertainment of libraries, sports sites and other public utilities. Samtgemeinden can take over other tasks of the member municipalities, for instance, tourism.  Etymology  The term Samtgemeinde (plural: Samtgemeinden) is a neologism consisting of the German adjectives gesamt (whole, entire, all, complete, total, aggregate, collective, overall, general, joint, united) or zusammen (together, jointly) and the noun Gemeinde (municipality). Samtgemeinde can be translated into English as \\"joint municipal association\\" or \\"collective municipal association\\" but one-to-one translation is hardly possible. The term Sammtgemeinden (at that time written with double m) was originally used for low-level administrative units in Prussia during a short-lived reform that saw the reorganization of parishes between 1850 and 1853.  Organs  Samtgemeinden have three organs: * The Samtgemeinde mayor (), elected directly every five years. * The Samtgemeinde council, () elected every five years. * The Samtgemeinde committee (). The Samtgemeinde committee consists of the Samtgemeinde mayor (the chairman of the committee), and according to size of the council from four to ten assistants and the council can decide a rise by two (¬ß56 paragraph 2 local government law). These positions are distributed among the factions and groups in the council according to the largest remainder method.

He served as President of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences between 1798 and 1803. Nicolay was the son of a Strasbourg archivist. He graduated from the University of Strasbourg with a degree in law. Like his father, he served as a librarian to a string of rich nobles. Prince Dmitry Gallitsyn employed Nicolay as his secretary in Vienna and Paris where he came to know Voltaire, Diderot, d'Alembert and other luminaries of the Enlightenment. In 1769 Nicolay was invited to the Russian Empire to be a teacher of logic for future Emperor Paul I of Russia. In 1782 (on the same day as Goethe) Nicolay was ennobled and granted the title of baron by Joseph II. When Paul became emperor, he appointed Nicolay to run the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences (15 April 1798 - 2 June 1803). Nicolay's private library, collections (cameos, letters and other documents) and pictures are now in the possession of the Finnish National Library in Helsinki. This library is a very rare example of the Russian libraries from the age of Enlightenment.The history of the Monrepos Park In 1803 Baron von Nicolay settled into retirement at his estate Monrepos north of Vyborg.

The highway connects Hurricane to the twin cities of Hildale and Colorado City, Arizona. The highway connects to US-89A through Arizona State Route 389. The route was added to the state highway system in 1914, and has had several designations. Route description The route begins at the Arizona border in Hildale (whose Arizona counterpart is Colorado City). These two towns are largely known for the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (or the FLDS), a Mormon fundamentalist sect that broke away the mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (or the LDS). The highway proceeds northwest past Hildale (where the street is known as State Street) for nearly 15 miles before beginning a 5-mile (8 km) descent into Hurricane. A runaway truck ramp is located along this descent. The route enters Hurricane on 100 South and proceeds to turn north on Main Street. The route proceeds for a block before terminating at SR-9 (State Street). The northernmost of the route is included in the National Highway System. History Looking southbound on SR-59 towards Hildale The road from SR-15 (now SR-9 and SR-17) at La Verkin Junction south to Hurricane was added to the state highway system in 1912, and in 1914 it was extended southeast via Big Plain Junction to Arizona.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated September 2007, accessed May 2008Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated November 2007, accessed May 2008 In the 1920s, the entire route was numbered State Route 16.State Road Commission, Utah State Trunk Lines, 1923 A connection from SR-15 (now SR-9) in Rockville south to SR-16 at Big Plain Junction became a state highway in 1925. In 1927, SR-16 was moved to the Rockville-Arizona route, and the roadway between La Verkin and Big Plain Junctions became part of the new SR-17, which also went southwest from Hurricane to SR-1 (US-91, now I-15). The Hurricane- Big Plain Junction branch was split from SR-17 in 1931, becoming a new State Route 59. The entirety of SR-16 was deleted in 1935, permanently removing the Rockville-Big Plain Junction road from the state highway system; the highway beyond Big Plain Junction to Arizona was also removed, but was re-added in 1941 as part of SR-59, forming the present extent of that route. SR-59 was almost completed relocated in 1962, including a new crossing of the state line; it had ended at the west end of Uzona Avenue, which extends west along the border from Colorado City/Hildale, but now crosses within the city limits. The connecting State Route 389 in Arizona was not added to that state's state highway system until 1959.Arizona Highway Data: Search Right-of-Way Resolutions, accessed June 2008 Major intersections References External links 059 059 ","title":"Utah State Route 59"},{"id":"18155242","title":"1930 VFL Grand Final"},{"id":"18155246","text":"Kayon is a village in the Zimtenga Department of Bam Province in northern- central Burkina Faso.

This portion of the highway is full of unsafe and eroded ditches (the depth of which is very difficult to judge from beyond 3 ft). If driving through NH28 in a light- vehicle, it is advisable to cross this patch of highway before dark and avoid it during heavy rains. The situation of this part is generally attributed to lower topography, heavy rains and indifferent attitude of corrupt representatives. Accidents It is one of busiest national highway in country and also facing various frequent life losing accidents on it. The main cause behind accidents are unexpected broken road-divider by local population for their ease to cross road. Recently an accident blocking the highway for around 5 hours (which led to around 35 kilometer-long close traffic on NH), took place by students of Sri Ramswaroop Memorial College of Engineering and Management Lucknow because of frequent deaths of students and staff of the college.

History Bukkulla was the name of the property of George Wyndham (1801‚Äì1870) and means 'place of leopard tree' or a ‚Äòhigh black stump‚Äô.Keith R. Binney, Horsemen of the First Frontier (1788-1900) and the Serpents Legacy, Volcanic Productions, Sydney, 2005, xxxii + 542 pages; Wyndham was the first official licensee when he held the Macintyre River property in 1839. The 1841 census recorded Bukkulla as having 3 free males, 1 convict there. Wyndham started a vineyard there along with a Thoroughbred horse stud which bred some good horses. The Bukkulla stud also produced some good stockhorses and horses for the Indian trade, too. In 1850 there were 300 horses, 2,000 cattle and 7,000 sheep on Bukkulla. The property was later subdivided by Wyndham Brothers into Karoola, Redbank, Arthur's Seat, Dinton Vale and Westholme, etc. Bukkulla Post Office opened on 1 April 1876 and closed in 1980. The district's primary industries are sheep and beef cattle breeding. The village now has a sports ground, a public telephone, several homes and a communications tower. Macintyre Station is nearby.

Pangare is less obvious on a short-haired coat Pangar√© is a coat trait found in some horses that features pale hair around the eyes and muzzle and underside of the body. These pale areas can extend up to the flanks, throat and chest, behind the elbows, in front of the stifle, and up the buttock. Animals with the pangar√© trait are sometimes called \\"mealy\\" or \\"light-pointed\\". The color of these lighter areas depends on the underlying color and ranges from off-white to light tan. This type of coloration is most often found in primitive breeds like the Fjord horse, Exmoor Pony, American Belgian Draft, and Haflinger. Wild equids like the Przewalski's Horse, Onager, African Wild Ass, Kiang as well as the domestic Donkey exhibit pangar√© as a rule. Pangar√© is thought to be a type of protective countershading. Light muzzle and underparts are classic Pangare traits Horse foals are often born with \\"foal pangar√©\\" or light points, especially over black haired areas, which they lose when they shed their foal coats. Dr. Phillip Sponenberg suggested that the seal brown coat color was caused by the action of pangar√© on a black coat.Sponenberg 2003. pg. 29. \\"Some horses referred to as brown are essentially black but have the mealy effect superimposed. Such horses are called seal brown. Seal browns and very darkly countershaded browns can look almost identical and illustrate that occasionally it is difficult to assess a horse's genotype accurately by visual inspection of phenotype alone.\\" However, seal brown horses have since tested negative for the recessive black agouti genotype. Chestnut horses with pangar√© are sometimes called \\"Belgian sorrels\\". In donkeys, no light points (loss of pangare) is caused by a recessive missense mutation at agouti. The light points (pangare) color is similar to the light bellied agouti color in mice, while the no light points color is similar to recessive black in mammals. In light bellied agouti mice, the agouti mRNA starts with a different noncoding exon depending on whether it is made in the dorsal or ventral region. This leads to a lighter belly color in mice and probably other mammals as well.

Historical background In the United States the development of industry during 19th and early 20th century resulted in the construction of thousands of mills or factory buildings typically of brick or stone masonry construction across the nation, with a high concentration in the Northeast. By 1920, there were hundreds of mill towns across the region built for the production of textiles and other goods, such as shoes, machinery and other items. However, the Northern textile industry would suffer greatly beginning in the early 1920s, with the failure of many of these companies, and the rise in competition from Southern mills. Other industries would follow, especially during the later part of the 20th century, when globalization changed the economy, and entire industries began to move overseas to developing nations. Through the 20th century, many mills carried on in a variety of industrial purposes, other than original intended use. Many were used for storage, or other small enterprises. Still, many more remained mostly vacant and underutilized through the middle part of the 20th century, and even today. Many vacant mill buildings have become a target for vandalism, arson and contribute to urban blight in many communities. A similar scenario has also played out in Great Britain and elsewhere in Europe during this same timeframe. Historic awareness movement Beginning in the 1960s, there was a large public outcry throughout the United States for an increase in historic preservation, to stop the loss of historic structures that began during the 1950s with urban renewal projects in big cities and small towns across the nation. A similar movement occurred in Great Britain decades earlier. One result of this outcry was the establishment of the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, by the Federal Government. Since this time, more than one-million listings have been added to the National Register, on many types of structures and places across the country. While not a certain guarantee that a structure will never be demolished, the National Register provides owners with a tool to seek national and state tax credits, grants and other assistance that may enable the rehabilitation of the building. Since the 1960s communities across the country have established Historic Districts and special by-laws in an attempt to preserve and prevent the destruction of properties deemed important to the context of history. Mill to museum conversion Slater Mill, Pawtucket The first successful textile mill in the United States was Slater Mill, established by Samuel Slater in Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1793. With its significant historic value, the drive to restore Slater Mill into a public museum began during the mid-20th century. In 1971, the Brandywine River Museum of Art opened in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania in a converted Civil War-era grist mill. The mill (and an additional 8 1/2 acres) was purchased at auction by the newly formed Brandywine Conservancy. Renovations began in 1970 and the museum opened in 1971. The renovation was done by James R. Grieves Associates, Inc. of Baltimore. Grieves was the only professional consulted who wanted to keep the 19th structure intact. Other architects recommended tearing it down and starting over. The museum exhibits Wyeth and American art, with galleries devoted to the works of N.C., Andrew, and Jamie Wyeth. In 1976, Lowell Heritage State Park was established in Lowell, Massachusetts. In 1978, the United States Congress established Lowell National Historical Park and the Lowell Historic Preservation Commission. The legislation to create the park was sponsored by United States Senator and Lowell native Paul Tsongas. The restoration gathered momentum in the 1980s, including the renovation of the canals and former mill facilities into museums, as well as the construction of a waterfront walkway. During the 1980s, with the example of Lowell's National Historic Park coming into fruition, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts established a series of Heritage State Parks throughout the state to celebrate and preserve the state's valuable historic (mostly industrial) history. Lawrence Heritage State Park, which occupies a former mill boardinghouse in the city's industrial canal district, is an excellent example. In 1999, the former Arnold Print Works mills in North Adams, Massachusetts was converted into the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MassMOCA). Not all historic mills can be successfully transformed into museums however, only with the few, most significantly historic ones has this been possible. Mill to residential conversion Since most mills were initially zoned as \\"industrial\\" with the emergence of zoning ordinances during the mid- and late 20th century, an early obstacle of many planners and developers in transforming these vacant or underutilized mill spaces into residences was to convince local officials that the usefulness of the mills for continuing industry was limited. Business practices were changing, and the old mill buildings were no longer efficient or practical for industry. Even today, most jurisdictions require some sort of special permit or zoning change in order for the conversions to take place. One of the earliest known conversions of a historic textile mill into residential apartments is the Valley Falls Company south mill located in Central Falls, Rhode Island. This project was completed in 1979, and now includes 133 units of elderly housing.Bruner/Cott & Associates Portfolio Border City Mill Apartments, Fall River Other mill conversion projects during the 1980s include the Border City Mill Apartments in Fall River, Massachusetts, situated in a historic 1870s brick cotton mill. The huge Massachusetts Mills in Lowell, Massachusetts were converted into a 445-unit apartment complex beginning in 1990, while the nearby Market Mills Apartments have 230 units. In recent years, with Massachusetts historic tax credit program, the Boott Mills and Lawrence Mills have been converted into residences also, as part of Lowell's continued revitalization of its historic waterfront area. Mill conversions have also occurred in other parts of the United States, such as the Cotton Mill Condos in New Orleans, completed in 1997. In recent years, there has been a trend toward the loft style apartment or condominium unit, with high ceilings, exposed bricks, tall windows, wood floors, and exposed beams or structural elements. One of the most ambitious mill conversion projects in recent years is the transformation of the huge Wood Mill in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Built in 1906, it was the largest textile mill in the world at the time. The project is known as Monarch on the Merrimack. Mill to mixed-use conversion Concurrent with the move to restore former industrial mills into residences, has been the conversion of certain sites into a mix of retail shops, offices and restaurants and other non-industrial uses. During the 1980s, many of the historic cotton mills in Fall River, Massachusetts were converted into factory outlet stores, although with minimal physical alteration other than some partitions and carpeting. The factory outlet stores in Fall River were highly successful for many years, but have in recent years declined, a victim of newer \\"premium outlet\\" malls opening up in nearby suburban areas such as Wrentham, Massachusetts, and others. One excellent example of a mill to mixed-use conversion in New England is the Clocktower Place, located in the small town of Maynard, Massachusetts. The huge mill complex was originally the Assabet Manufacturing Company, which grew during the 19th century to be one of the largest textile companies in the state, specializing in woolen goods. It was later acquired by the American Woolen Company, and later, by Digital Equipment Corporation, until it finally vacated the location in 2001. Since then, the entire complex has been transformed into an office park. It is now home to many companies in differing markets. Its most famous tenant is perhaps Monster.com. The largest mill to mixed-use conversion in New England however, can be found at Manchester, New Hampshire, with the successful renovation and conversion of the Amoskeag Millyard, once the largest single textile company in the world. The Amoskeag Millyard is the centerpiece of Manchester's waterfront, and includes offices, restaurants, a museum, residences and a university.Brady Sullivan Properties Historic tax credits Royal Mills, West Warwick, Rhode Island, an example of a recent mill conversion enabled by the use of historic tax credits Often, parking, utilities and other infrastructure need to be upgraded as part of the mill conversion process. Many of the old industrial sites contain levels of contamination, which can be very costly for the developers to mitigate. In recent years, many states have enacted Historic Tax Credit programs in an attempt to enable the rehabilitation of older structures deemed to be \\"historically significant\\". Typically, the major criteria for this determination is a listing with the National Register of Historic Places, usually followed by a review by state and local agencies. The development companies typically utilize the tax credits to offset the usually expensive process of renovation and site cleanup. An example of a Mill conversion utilized by the use of a state historic tax program is the Royal Mills in West Warwick, Rhode Island, redeveloped by SBER a Baltimore-based company with a long history of historic preservation projects. This mill had sat vacant for many years, and was in serious threat of being demolished. The site has since successfully been converted into residential apartments, situated on the Pawtuxet River with a walking trail and bike path nearby. While recently suspended due to the State's budget crisis, Rhode Island's Historic Tax Credit Program was deemed as one of the most successful in the nation, enabling hundreds of historic structures across the state to be preserved over the past several years since it was enacted. The benefits historic tax credit programs to state budgets have been often controversial, but there are many indirect economic benefits to local communities.Rhode Island's Historic Tax Credit Program The property tax value of a restored mill it typically about ten times greater than the existing underutilized mill building, and there is also the added benefit of many construction jobs and other services during the renovation process. The intangible value of having a historic factory building preserved for future generations to enjoy, as well as the benefits to the community are often harder to calculate. The restored mill buildings often become the focal point of the community.

Although a member of the royal family and apart from being a prominent real estate developer in the UAE, being the owner of Al Hekma Tower in Dubai, Issa bin Zayed holds no official or political position within the government of the United Arab Emirates. In April 2009 Issa bin Zayed was subject to a controversy in which a video tape of torture smuggled out of the United Arab Emirates to the United States by two Palestinian brothers, who were his business associates, showed Issa mercilessly torturing a man with whips, electric cattle prods, and wooden planks with protruding nails and running him over repeatedly with an SUV. Issa bin Zayed was initially put under arrest with the UAE government stating that matters were resolved \\"privately\\". One of the Palestinian brothers, Nabulsi, claimed Issa bin Zayed breached his contract and subjected him to torture, emotional distress, and malicious prosecution and demanded $80 million in repatriation. Emirati court found Issa not guilty on the principle of diminished responsibility and instead condemned and sentenced the two brothers for using the video as blackmail and extortion. The court was accused, by international human rights observers, of having failed to deliver justice. Early life Sheikh Issa is the son of Zayed bin Sultan. His mother is Sheikha Amna bint Salah Al Badi. He has one full-brother, late Sheikh Nasser. The present UAE ruler, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and the Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, are the half brothers of Sheikh Issa. Torture incident Issa is the subject of an assault, libel, and slander lawsuit brought on by businessman Bassam Nabulsi of Houston, Texas, a former long-term adviser to the Al Nahyan family, filed on 16 August 2006 in District Court for the Southern District of Texas Houston Division for Assault, Libel, and Slander. Nabulsi said that he safeguarded Issa's most important documents, including financial records, investment documents and videotapes, which showed Issa torturing a man with a cattle prod and a spiked plank. Nabulsi, who had \\"smuggled\\" the tape out of the UAE, was also suing Issa, saying he was tortured by UAE police, after he refused to hand over videos to Issa after a disagreement.ABC News Exclusive: Torture Tape Implicates UAE Royal Sheikh ABC News 22 April 2009 Nabulsi also said his brother recorded the tapes as demanded by Issa, who, Nabulsi says, liked to watch them later. The lawsuit was dismissed on 12 June 2009 by district judge Sim Lake for \\"lack of personal jurisdiction and proper service of process.\\"Nabulsi v. Nahyan 9 October 2007Nabulsi v. Nahyan 19 July 2007 In April 2009, an abridged version of the tape was posted by ABC News. In the video, taken at some time in 2005, Issa is shown beating another man, an Afghan grain merchant called Mohammed Shah Poor, with a wooden plank with protruding nails, firing an automatic weapon into the sand around him and forcing a cattle prod into his anus before turning it on. Prior to the abuse, the video allegedly shows a man in Abu Dhabi police uniform (but without his equipment belt) tying the victim's arms and legs; at a later point, Issa urges the cameraman to move in closer with the words, \\"Get closer. Get closer. Get closer. Let his suffering show.\\" The victim also appeared to have been run over by a Mercedes SUV, had lighter fluid poured on his genitals and set alight, and had salt poured on his wounds. At the end of the video, two other police officers can be seen posing alongside a fully marked ministry departmental vehicle. It is not known if the vehicle registration on the departmental vehicle and the SUV were ever cross-checked to authenticate the involvement of the Sheikh and the government.\\"Lawsuit: Houston businessman, others tortured by Arab sheik.\\" (Archive) KHOU-TV. Tuesday 17 June 2008. Retrieved 9 September 2013. Lawyers stated the abuse began because Issa felt he had been overcharged in a grain deal. \\"Ultimately this video, or certainly large portions of it, will be played in court,\\" said Anthony G. Buzbee, who represents Nabulsi in his lawsuit.Torture lawsuit embarrasses UAE The lawsuit, filed pursuant to the Torture Victims Protection Act, also lists Sheikhs Nasser bin Zayed Al Nahyan (since deceased), and Saif, as well as the Royal Family of bin Zayed Nahyan Partnership as defendants. In a statement to ABC News, the UAE Ministry of the Interior said, it had reviewed the tape and acknowledged the involvement of Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan, brother of the country's crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed; the Minister of the Interior is also a sibling of Issa. The Ministry said, \\"The incidents depicted in the video tapes were not part of a pattern of behavior,\\" the Interior Ministry's statement declared. The government statement said its review found \\"all rules, policies and procedures were followed correctly by the Police Department.\\" Responding to the government statement, Sarah Leah Whitson of Human Rights Watch stated \\"If this is their complete reply, then sadly it's a scam and it's a sham. [...] It is the state that is torturing them, if the government does not investigate and prosecute these officers, and those commanding those officers.\\" In response to the video's emergence, US congressman Jim McGovern called for a freeze on government aid to the UAE, and requested that Issa be refused US visas; in a letter to the secretary of state of the United States, Hillary Clinton, he said: \\"I cannot describe the horror and revulsion I felt when witnessing what is on this video ... I could not watch it without constantly flinching.\\" Nabulsi has also alleged that he brought the existence of the torture tape, along with the involvement and collusion of UAE police, to the attention of a US official assigned to train UAE police, with little effect. McGovern has also called for an investigation into these allegations, in order to discover when US officials knew about the tape, if they took any action and, in the event that they didn't, why not. \\"It shocks the conscience,\\" he said. The controversy over the torture tape has delayed recertification of a US‚ÄìUAE nuclear power cooperation agreement.\\"Torture tape delays U.S.-UAE nuclear deal, say U.S. officials\\" Elise Labott, CNN, 29 April 2009 =Abu Dhabi probe into allegations= Abu Dhabi reported on 29 April 2009 it would probe these allegations. Without acknowledging Issa by name, the statement said \\"the events depicted on the video appear to represent a violation of human rights\\". The incident occurred in 2004. It appeared the initial tape could be the beginning of the problem and it was reported on Sunday 3 May that the lawyer for Nabulsi, Issa's former partner, claimed to have \\"more than two hours of video footage showing Issa's involvement in the torture of more than 25 people.\\" According to the newspaper, police are believed to be seen participating in the attacks and some of the victims are thought to be Sudanese immigrants. =Trial and verdict= On 14 December 2009 Issa appeared in court and declared he was innocent. The trial ended on 10 January 2010, when Issa was cleared of the torture and rape of Mohammed Shah Poor. Though according to his lawyer, the court accepted that Issa had been a victim of a conspiracy, the judge in fact did not give a reason, as to why Issa was exonerated of responsibility for the abuse.Sheik Acquitted in Abu Dhabi Torture Case The New York Times 11 January 2010 The brothers Ghassan and Bassam Nabulsi were both sentenced in absentia to five years for \\"drugging, recording and publishing a video and blackmail\\".\\"Abu Dhabi Royal Acquitted in Torture Trial\\"\\"Sheik Acquitted in Abu Dhabi Torture Case\\" Nabulsi, speaking from Texas, told the Observer of his shock. \\"I am feeling nauseous. It is really sarcastic. These people, the more they lie, the bigger the hole they are digging for themselves\\" and called the verdict an insult to justice. Human Rights Watch, an international rights watchdog group, criticised the United Arab Emirate's trial and called on the government to establish an independent body to investigate allegations of abuse by security personnel and other persons of authority. The US state department has expressed concern over the verdict and said all members of Emirati society \\"must stand equal before the law\\" and called for a careful review of the decision to ensure that the demands of justice are fully met in this case.

Federal Election Commission, 554 U.S. 724 (2008), is a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that Sections 319(a) and (b) of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (popularly known as the McCain- Feingold Act) unconstitutionally infringed on a candidate's First Amendment rights. Background Section 319(b) of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) of 2002 contained the so-called \\"Millionaire's Amendment,\\" which required a candidate for federal office in the United States to file a \\"declaration of intent\\" regarding how much of the candidate's personal funds he or she intended to spend in the upcoming election. This provision was triggered only if the candidate's \\"opposition personal funds amount\\" (OPFA)‚Äîthe amount of personal funds available to them for expenditure in the race‚Äîexceeded $350,000. Additional disclosures were required to be made to the opposition candidate, any involved national political parties, and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) if these personal expenditures exceeded additional, enumerated benchmarks in the legislation. Once the OPFA was triggered, the wealthy candidate would still be subject to the contribution limitations imposed by the BCRA and other federal and state laws. However, Section 319(a) provided that the contribution caps for the non-self-financing opposition candidate were now tripled, and the non-self-financing candidate could receive coordinated contributions and expenditures from his or her national political party without any limitation. Plaintiff Jack Davis brought suit against the Federal Election Commission, alleging that the BCRA disclosure and limitation restrictions on wealthy candidates violated his First Amendment rights. A three-judge panel of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia found that the court had jurisdiction over the case, but upheld the BCRA against Davis' challenge. Davis appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. =Jack Davis= John \\"Jack\\" Davis is an American businessman and founder of the I Squared R Element CompanyI Squared R Element which produces and sells heating elements. He has run four times for the Congressional seat representing New York's 26th congressional district, in 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2011; all bids have been unsuccessful. In the first three of those elections, Davis, a former Republican, ran as a Democrat. For the 2004 and 2006 candidacies, he was the Democratic nominee and faced no primary challengers in his unsuccessful bids against incumbent Republican Tom Reynolds; in the 2008 race, he finished in third place in a three-way Democratic primary to Alice Kryzan. In the 2011 election, Davis, who has since changed his registration back to Republican, ran on the \\"Tea Party\\" line, a line created by Buffalo area Libertarian Party activist James Ostrowski primarily to run candidates against endorsed Republicans. (Davis sought the endorsements of the Republican and Conservative parties in the 2011 election, but did not receive either one.) Davis filed his lawsuit against the Federal Election Commission between his 2006 and 2008 runs for office. Decision Associate Justice Samuel Alito wrote the majority opinion for the court, in which Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas joined. =Majority ruling= Alito reviewed the law in question and major facts of the case in Section I of his ruling. In Section II, Alito next dealt with the Court's jurisdiction, which had to be established for a ruling to occur. The Court would have jurisdiction only if the appellant could show a personal interest in the controversy, and if an actual controversy existed (and was not moot). All parties agreed that Davis had standing, but the FEC had argued that since Davis' opponent had not yet filed any documents there was no controversy. The majority held that standing applied only to the party raising the issue, not to all parties in the case. Additionally, the FEC argued that the issue was moot, as the election was long over. Again, the majority disagreed, holding that the case represented a \\"disputes capable of repetition, yet evading review.\\"Davis v. Federal Election Commission, 554 U. S. __, 9. Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer concurred with the majority in part and dissented in part concerning Section III of the majority ruling (see below). In Section III of his ruling, Alito concluded that Section 319(a) and 319(b) of the BCRA failed to pass constitutional muster. Campaign finance limitations not only must equally apply to all candidates, Alito argued from precedent, but they must be narrowly drawn to advance important governmental interests (such as avoiding corruption in the political process). But Section 319(a) not only did not provide a level playing field, it fundamentally restricted the right of a self-financing candidate to spend his or her own money in a preferred way. No important governmental interest was advanced, Alito held, because (as the Court had held in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 in 1976) a reliance on personal expenditures fundamentally reduces the likelihood of corruption. The FEC had argued that a level playing field was an important governmental interest. But Alito held that this was not an important governmental interest, and in fact the Court had said as much in Buckley v. Valeo three decades earlier. Indeed, the BCRA raises the ominous spectre of the public determining how valuable a wealthy person's speech is, something (Alito said) the Constitution does not permit. The government had argued that the low limits on federal campaign contributions were actually ameliorated when OPFA was triggered, advancing another important government interest. But Alito disagreed, arguing that if the limits are onerous then Congress should simply raise them to advance that important interest. In Section IV of his decision, Alito declared Section 319(b) unconstitutional as well, tied as it was to Section 319(a). =Stevens' dissent= Justice John Paul Stevens dissented from Section III of the majority opinion. He was joined by Justices Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer. Stevens joined Section II of the majority opinion, agreeing that Davis had standing and that the controversy was not moot. The district court, Stevens said, had found no restriction on the self-financing candidate's ability to spend as much or as little money as he or she pleased. Thus, he concluded, there was no First Amendment infringement whatsoever. Because Section 319(a) and 319(b) merely diminished the unequal footing of candidates for federal office, Stevens also found no infringement of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution either. Stevens broke with Buckley v. Valeo, arguing that Justice Byron White's dissent in Buckley was correct. White had argued that restrictions on political speech should not be seen as restrictions per se, but rather as reasonable regulations akin to \\"time, manner, and place\\" regulations long accepted by the Court. Such regulations are judged by the \\"legitimate and sufficiently substantial\\" test rather than the stricter \\"important governmental interest\\" test. He found the reporting regulations imposed on wealthy candidates a reasonable limitation which would survive constitutional scrutiny. Even if one accepted the Buckley Court's reasoning, Stevens said, the two goals of reducing the influence of wealth as a criterion for office and reducing the impression that public office is available only to the highest bidder are important governmental interests which meet the majority's test. Davis had not shown that Section 319(a) harms his ability to spend, Stevens said. Amplification of the opponent's voice does not mean a diminution of the self-financing candidate's voice. The Buckley Court had not concluded that reducing corruption and the appearance of corruption were the only important governmental interests to be served (as the majority had concluded), but were one of many such interests which might justify an infringement on First Amendment rights. Stevens cited several precedents where the Supreme Court had upheld restrictions on wealthy individuals in order to improve the political process. Stevens also criticized the majority for not addressing Davis' equal protection claim. Citing Buckley v. Valeo and the more recent McConnell v. Federal Election Commission, 540 U.S. 93 (2003), Stevens said that the Court had condoned legislative solutions which treat candidates differently, and the BCRA did just that. =Ginsburg's dissent= Justice Ginsburg filed a short opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. Justice Breyer joined her opinion. Ginsburg joined Section II of the majority opinion, agreeing that Davis had standing and that the controversy was not moot. However, Ginsburg joined Section II of Justice Stevens' dissent, and agreed that Section 319(a) and Section 319(b) of the BCRA passed constitutional muster. Ginsburg did not join that part of Stevens' dissent where he argued that Buckley v. Valeo was wrongly decided. The FEC had not asked the Court to overturn Buckley, and no briefs on that matter had been offered. Since Ginsburg felt that Section 319(a) and Section 319(b) of the BCRA were constitutionally acceptable, she refused to go further (as Stevens had) and overrule Buckley.

She is a flagship of both the state of Wisconsin and of the United Nations Environment Programme.UNEP Denis Sullivan entry History The construction of the Denis Sullivan was first proposed in 1991 by a group of Milwaukee residents and volunteers from other states. Their plan was to build a tall ship which would serve as a platform for educating people about the Great Lakes. Community involvement was welcome in the project, and almost a thousand peopleDiscovery World's Denis Sullivan homepage donated almost a million volunteer hours toward the Denis Sullivan construction. Through the efforts of both professional shipwrights and volunteers, the Denis Sullivan was partially completed and launched in June 2000. She departed Milwaukee for her first sail to the Caribbean in November 2000. Design The Denis Sullivan is not a replica of a specific vessel. Rather, her design is inspired by that of the Great Lakes cargo schooners of the 19th century. Like many of those schooners, she carries a raffee, a square-rigged fore topsail which is triangular in shape. In designing the Denis Sullivan, architects Timothy Graul Marine Services looked to several nineteenth century Great Lakes schooners for inspiration, including the Rouse Simmons, Clipper City, and Alvin Clark. Above the waterline, the Sullivan closely resembles these earlier vessels. Her shape is that of an efficient cargo carrier, and her rigging and deck arrangement are likewise authentic. She differs from her predecessors, however, below the waterline. Traditionally, Great Lakes cargo schooners were built with a fairly flat bottom to minimize draft and permit sailing in shallow waters. They carried a centerboard to compensate for this when sailing to windward. The Denis Sullivan strayed from this tradition to meet both modern Coast Guard safety requirements and the practical considerations of a passenger vessel. She has a relatively deep hull and weighted keel, which provide greater stability to the vessel and allow for of head clearance in the below decks accommodations. An additional concession to safety regulations was the division of the traditional cargo hold into watertight bulkheads.

The power station is situated in S√∏r-Varanger near the village of Skogfoss on the river Paatsjoki (Pasvikelva). The power station, which is owned by Pasvik Kraft, a subsidiary of Varanger Kraft, makes use of a 20-metre fall in the river. Although the power station is located on a river, Lake Inari in Finland is regulated as storage for all of the power stations in the drainage basin. The river is dammed at the power station, which also has a small reservoir in Langvannet. Following the damming, the water level rose to a level of 9 metres and many cabins had to be vacated. A Sami grave site also had to be moved following the regulation. Parts of the dam pass over the Russian border. There are roads to the road network of both countries, but the border crossing is not open to public. There is only one road on the Norwegian side from the Pasvik valley to the outside world, meaning visitors have to drive the same way back. There are wishes from local people to build a road to Finland, so that tourists can pass through the valley. Such plans have been rejected due to cost reasons. It would be possible to use the road over the Skogfoss station or the one over the Hevoskoski/Hestefoss station upstream and the existing Russian road to the Finnish border.

For her debut book published in 2005 and again two years later, she won the annual Kate Greenaway Medal recognising the year's best- illustrated British children's book. Life Emily Gravett was born in Brighton, England, the second daughter of a printmaker and an art teacher. After her parents split, she lived with her mother the teacher, but she and her father would \\"go out drawing\\" in museums. She left school at 16 with GCSE qualification only in Art (grade A) and travelled Great Britain for eight years, living in \\"a variety of vehicles\\" and meeting her partner Mik. By 1997, they had settled in Wales and had a daughter, Oleander (Olly). Gravett \\"realised that I wanted a career, and drawing was my only skill\\", so she began an art course. The family returned to Brighton in 2001, where persistence rather than qualifications got her an interview for the illustration degree course at the local university. She matriculated that September and graduated three years later. As of June 2008, she lives in Brighton with Mik and Olly. She works in an attic studio \\"with views of the South Downs\\". Career During her second year as a student, Gravett entered one of her school projects for the MacMillan Prize for Children's Illustration, a competitive annual award to art students established in 1985. She earned a \\"Highly Commended\\" then and won the prize in her final year, when she entered two books that the judges ranked first and second. That ensured a contract publication of Wolves by Macmillan Children's Books (now the children's books imprint of Pan MacMillan). The editorial director later said, \\"It was quite obvious who the winner was going to be. Emily entered Wolves in a beautiful dummy format, and really we had to do very little work on it before it was published. She's a bookbinder as well as an artist; a real creator of books.\\" Two years after graduation she won the Kate Greenaway Medal from the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals, recognising Wolves as the previous year's (2005) best-illustrated new children's book published in the United Kingdom. By that time, rights had been sold in five other countries. Next year (officially dated 2007) she made the Greenaway shortlist for Orange Pear Apple Bear. The year after that she won a second Medal (no one has won three) for her fourth book, Little Mouse's Big Book of Fears, and made the shortlist as well for fifth book, Monkey and Me. WorldCat reports that Orange Pear Apple Bear is her work most widely held in participating libraries. According to one library summary, it \\"[e]xplores concepts of color, shape, and food using only five simple words, as a bear juggles and plays.\\" For 2008 Gravett was official illustrator for World Book Day (United Kingdom) ‚Äî an honor with duties such as specially commissioned illustrations and recorded demonstration of characters from her books. The current Children's Laureate (2011‚Äì2013) Julia Donaldson wrote and Gravett illustrated Cave baby, a 32-page picture book featuring a prehistoric baby's tour atop a woolly mammoth, published by Macmillan in 2010. It has been published in Welsh-language and Chinese editions but not in the United States. \\"Formats and Editions of Cave baby\\". WorldCat. Retrieved 2012-08-31. With that one exception as of September 2012, Gravett has been the writer and illustrator of all her published work: thirteen picture books including four board books, all published by MacMillan. Style Gravett completed Wolves in six weeks as an illustration course project and added only the back endpaper spread during the editorial process. Some projects take longer but she wrote and sketched Orange Pear Apple Bear in merely 11 hours, waking one Mother's Day with the four words in her head and staying in bed for \\"the whole book in one go\\". Gravett's books are interactive. She encouraged the pet dog to chew the dummy for Wolves \\"to simulate the impact of the wolf's teeth\\". That didn't work so she chewed it herself. She wanted Little Mouse's Big Book of Fears to look genuinely chewed, so she painted yoghurt on plain white paper and laid it in the cage of the two pet rats. They nibbled it and peed on it, which she scanned to produce background for drawing. The front cover illustration shows the title Little Mouse's ~~Emily Gravett's~~ Big Book of Fears, a mouse looking through a hole it has chewed, and damage along the book edges. Little Mouse is also a movable book, with \\"lift flaps and a fold-out map\\" (quoting a review).

Family background Katakazi is a Russian aristocratic family of Phanariotes, of Greek descent. Anton Katakazi, the patriarch of the family emigrated with his sons to Russia in 1807. The Katakazis were big landowners in the eastern part of the principality of Moldova, which was transferred to Russia the Treaty of Bucharest (1812). The family is mentioned in the catalogue of aristocratic families from the Bessarabia Governorate. Anton Katakazi's two sons got involved in Russian politics. The older son, Konstantin Antonovich Katakazi (1775‚Äì1826) was governor of Bessarabia from 1818 to 1825. Married to a princess Ypsilantis, Konstantin actively supported the Greek secret society Filiki Eteria and the military action of Alexander Ypsilantis in Moldavia and Wallachia. The younger son, Gavriil Antonovich Katakazi, became a Russian diplomat. His main assignment was legate of the Russian Empire to king Otto of Greece. Eventually Gavriil was named senator of the Russian Empire. Beginning of diplomatic activity Konstantin Gavrilovich Catacazy intended to follow his father's career and entered the staff of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At the beginning of 1865 Konstantin Catacazy wrote a memorandum to Prince Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov state chancellor of the Russian Empire in which he outlined a plan for a Russian mediation in the American Civil War. In his memorandum Catacazy argued that both North and South regarded Russia as a special friend. This assumption was not necessarily correct as the Russian fleet had shown its support for the Union, to prevent the British intervention on the part of the Confederation. In its conclusion, the memorandum indicated that it was Russia's interest to see the Union restored as a balance the United Kingdom. Gorchakov's comment was favorable but he took no decision on the matter and sent a copy of the memorandum to Eduard Andreevich Stoeckl, minister plenipotentiary of the Russian Empire in Washington, leaving it wholly to Stoeckl's judgment and discretion to act upon the plan.Russian Archives. Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Stoeckl, Minister Plenipotentiary of Russia to the United States, Feb. 6, 1865. A mediation a month before the fall of Richmond was however not an option. After having negotiated the Alaska purchase Stoeckl resigned for health reasons in 1869.

Though Tsar Alexander II of Russia had some reservations regarding this nomination, he finally gave in to the chancellor's suggestion.

You have constantly to remember that the American people are our best friend\\" –ü—Ä–µ–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–∞—è –≥–ª—É–ø–æ—Å—Ç—å - –ù–∞—à–µ –í—Ä–µ–º—è, Nr. 88, June 19‚Äì25, 2008 Mission to the United States Konstantin Catacazy arrived in Washington in late 1869. His diplomatic background was, however, mainly linked to the diplomatic relations of Russia with the Balkan States, where Russian envoys were frequently involved in intrigues in order to influence the internal policies of countries in which they were accredited. Catacazy tried to use the same diplomacy in the United States. He resisted a personal claim of an American citizen against Russia trying to force through various methods to withdraw his claim. During the negotiations which were in progress through the British and American Joint High Commission for the settlement of the Alabama claims, Catacazy made free use of the newspapers in an attempt to prejudice and defeat the negotiations. He also attempted to influence the decision of various members of Congress. Secretary of State Hamilton Fish warned him repeatedly that his conduct was not acceptable, but he continued his actions. Catacazy became personally abusive of the President and members of his Cabinet and denied any guilt when confronted with his acts.John W. Foster A Century of American Diplomacy s:A Century of American Diplomacy/Chapter XI Diplomatic tensions between Russia and the United States. Finally the situation seemed completely out of control and President Ulysses S. Grant instructed Secretary of State Fish to request the Government of Russia to recall minister Catacazy. The letter to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated: \\"On his arrival at Washington, Catacazy gave the promise of being a useful and very acceptable Minister, and made a very agreeable impression. Soon however he began to make himself very officious, interfering in questions not appropriately connected with his Legation and in those pending before Congress, importuning Senators and Representatives and resorting to personal interviews and solicitations unusual on the part of representatives of other powers accredited to this government, distasteful and annoying to the legislators thus indecorously approached and tending to embarrass the free course of legislation on the subjects with respect to which his interference was obtruded. He did not hesitate to use the newspapers of the country to influence public opinion on questions pending before the Government and indulged in much license in his denunciation of measures and individuals. In his conversation he was even more severe and unrestrained and employed abusive and vituperative language toward very many persons, including several in public positions and enjoying the respect and confidence of the community. The impropriety of a foreign Minister thus attempting to influence and to misdirect the public opinion of the country must be admitted as sufficient ground for his ceasing to be a proper agent between the Government which he represents and that to which he is accredited\\"Correspondence of the State Department with Mr. Curtin The New York Times, December 7, 1871 This letter was conveyed to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Jeremiah Curtin minister plenipotentiary of the United States to Russia on June 16. 1871. The timing was extremely sensitive as a high profile visit of Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich, the tsar's second son had been scheduled for the fall, and the presence of a Russian minister plenipotentiary during the visit was absolutely necessary. However, under the pretext that Chancellor Gorchakoff, the only person who could take a decision on the matter, was in Germany, the Russian Government delayed action. On August 18 the United States reiterated the request, insisting that the issue be solved before the visit of Grand Duke Alexei. The Russian Government finally responded, requesting that minister Catacazy be tolerated until after the presentation of the Grand Duke to the President, after which his assignment would be immediately terminated. This response was a diplomatic blunder. As, according to protocol, the Russian minister plenipotentiary was supposed to introduce the Grand Duke, it forced President Grant to receive him, though he had been officially declared \\"persona non grata\\". While the visit of the Grand Duke in America was generally considered a success, his reception at the White House in Washington was extremely short. His meeting with President Grant, which Konstantin Catacazy attended, lasted only 15 minutes, during which the Grand Duke addressed himself especially to Mrs. Grant. The entire visit in Washington only one day. No formal entertainment was given in Washington to the Grand Duke, though for all other visits of members of royal families to the White House, formal dinners had been organized. Such dinners had taken place when President John Tyler received Fran√ßois d'Orl√©ans, prince de Joinville, when Abraham Lincoln received Prince Napol√©on Joseph Bonaparte and even when Ulysses Grant received Kamehameha V, king of the Sandwich Islands.White House - Royal and Titled Guests, 1908 President Grant's displeasure with the delay in Catacazy's recall was evident and, under the circumstances, sitting at the same dinner table with Catacazy was unacceptable. Therefore, the reception of the Grand Duke at the White House was rather a blow for the Russian diplomacy even though at that time the US did not matter in world politics. There had been expectations that a treaty between the United States and Russia would be signed during the meeting. As the terms of such an agreement would have had to be negotiated by the State Department with the Russian minister before the meeting, no such agreement was signed.The Grand Duke pays his respects to the President - The New York Times, November 24, 1871 On November 26, 1871, Catacazy informed the State Department that General Alexander Gorloff, the military attach√©, would take charge of the Russian Imperial Legation in WashingtonMinister Catacazy and His Relations with the Government The New York Times November 27, 1871 President Grant's comments The diplomatic tension generated by Catacazy's attitude had been so intense, that President Grant considered it necessary to inform Congress about the conflict in a special message.Ulysses S. Grant - Third Annual Message to the Senate and House of Representatives December 4, 1871 (online text) The contents were repeated in the President's Third State of the Union Address \\"The intimate friendly relations which have so long existed between the United States and Russia continue undisturbed. The visit of the third son of the Emperor is a proof that there is no desire on the part of his Government to diminish the cordiality of those relations. The hospitable reception which has been given to the Grand Duke is a proof that on our side we share the wishes of that Government. The inexcusable course of the Russian minister at Washington rendered it necessary to ask his recall and to decline to longer receive that functionary as a diplomatic representative. It was impossible, with self-respect or with a just regard to the dignity of the country, to permit Mr. Catacazy to continue to hold intercourse with this Government after his personal abuse of Government officials, and during his persistent interferences, through various means, with the relations between the United States and other powers. In accordance with my wishes, this Government has been relieved of further intercourse with Mr. Catacazy, and the management of the affairs of the imperial legation has passed into the hands of a gentleman entirely unobjectionable.\\"Ulysses S. Grant's Third State of the Union Address s:Ulysses S. Grant's Third State of the Union Address Konstantin Catacazy left the United States, but that did not finish his intrigues. In 1872 he published a book in Paris about his conflict with the Government of the United States. Entitled A Diplomatic Incident, it was conceived as a letter addressed to Chief Justice Salmon Portland Chase. The Supreme Court did not respond. For the United States the conflict had ended once Catacazy had been recalled.M. de Catacazy - Un incident diplomatique. Lettre au chief Justice Salmon Portland Chase. Paris, Amyot 1872..

In 1869, he returned to Florida as the Northern District's register in bankruptcy. When Hart became governor in 1872, he needed someone he could trust to fill his position on the bench. He appointed Fraser to the Court January 16, 1873. After Hart died in March 1874, Fraser resigned from the court that May, expressing dissatisfaction with his salary and with Southern society. He had served 16 months on the court, having written opinions in seven minor cases. He returned to his law practice in Pennsylvania. He died of pneumonia on November 10, 1879.

It was originally built to house fire crews assigned to patrol the surrounding National Forest. In the 1990s, the United States Forest Service began renting the Imnaha Guard Station to recreational visitors. The Imnaha Guard Station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  In the 1920s and 1930s, Forest Service employees often traveled many miles from local ranger stations to forest work sites. Since the forest road networks were not well developed, getting to a job site meant a long trek, carrying all the equipment need to perform the field work. This made it impractical for employees to make daily round-trips. To facilitate work at remote sites, the Forest Service built guard stations at strategic locations throughout the forest to house fire patrols and project crews.Jacoby, Jayson, \\"Rustic Forest Service cabins available for rent\\", Baker City Herald, Baker City, Oregon, 27 April 2006. After World War II, the Forest Service greatly expanded its road network, allowing employees to get to most National Forest areas within a few hours. As a result, guard stations lost their utility. The Forest Service found new uses for some stations, but most were demolished or abandoned. In the 1990s, historic preservation groups with the support of Forest Service employees began pressing National Forest managers to preserve the remaining structures. To finance the preservation effort, the Forest Service started renting guard stations and unused fire lookouts to the public. The Imnaha Guard Station is located in the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest between Butte Falls, Oregon and the unincorporated town of Prospect, Oregon. It was built near Imnaha Springs by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1939. The guard station was originally used as a barracks for Forest Service fire fighters that patrolled the surrounding forest during summer fire season. The Forest Service used the cabin to house fire crews through the 1970s.\\"Imnaha Guard Station\\", Archiplanet, http://www.archiplanet.org, 5 December 2006.\\"Imnaha Guard Station - Oregon\\", United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Portland, Oregon, 27 November 2007.\\"Cabins and Lookouts\\", Rogue River National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Medford, Oregon, 28 July 2004. From 1970 through 1985, John (Bob) Poet and his family lived in the guard station during the summer. Poet later wrote a book about his experience at the Imnaha Guard Station.Poet, John R., Years at Imnaha Guard Station, Xlibris Corporation,, Bloomington, Indiana, 19 May 2005. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Forest Service volunteer campground hosts stayed in the cabin during the summer. In the mid-1990s, the Forest Service began renting the cabin to recreational visitors. The Imnaha Guard Station has been used every summer since it was built, a relatively rare distinction for a Forest Service guard station. Because of its rustic architecture and the cabin's unique historic value as an early Forest Service guard station, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. and ' (excerpt from larger \\"\\" thematic resources nomination)  Structure  The Imnaha Guard Station is located in a remote area of the Butte Falls Ranger District on the western slope of the Cascade Mountains, at about elevation. It is a rustic cabin surrounded by old-growth forest of mainly Douglas-fir, white fir, and incense cedar along with some ponderosa pine, sugar pine, and western white pine. The forest around the guard station is relatively undisturbed. As a result, most of the mature trees in the area are three to four feet in diameter. Front entrance to Imnaha Guard Station cabinThe cabin has a wood-frame structure and a concrete foundation. The exterior is covered with weatherboard and shingles. It is stained dark brown so it blends into the surrounding forest landscape. Compared to other Forest Service guard stations the Imnaha cabin is extremely well equipped. The cabin has three rooms plus an indoor bathroom. There is a pine-paneled living room with a large lava-rock fireplace. The living room is furnished with a hide-a- bed couch, a reclining chair, and a coffee table. The Forest Service provides firewood which is stored in the guard station's garage to keep it dry. The kitchen has a stove, refrigerator, and lighted work area plus a table and chairs. Potable water for drinking and cooking is available from the kitchen tap. The bedroom has a built-in closet, a full-size bed, and two small dressers. The bathroom has hot water, a flush toilet, and a shower. All the cabin's appliances and utilities run on propane.Woodward, Steve, \\"Forest Service towers offer chance to rough it\\", The Seattle Time, Seattle Washington, 18 March 2004.

A picnic table in the backyard allows visitor to dine outside under the trees. No tents are permitted inside the fenced area. However, visitors that need to accommodate more than six people can set up camping tents in the adjacent Imnaha Campground. There is a garage, a barn, and a horse corral on the guard station grounds. The garage is used to store wood for cabin guests. The barn and corral are still used by the Forest Service, and are off-limits to the public.Imnaha Guard Station Cabin Rental Agreement, Butte Falls Ranger District, Rogue River National Forest, Butte Falls, Oregon, 28 July 2004.  Recreation  Imnaha Springs near the guard station cabinImnaha Springs is a fifteen-minute hike from the cabin's front door. The spring covers a relatively wide area, forming numerous rivulets that flow along a scenic path through yellow monkeyflower and moss before joining together to create Imnaha Creek. Another attraction just a short walk from the cabin is \\"The Big Tree,\\" a particularly large Douglas-fir. The Big Tree is located a few hundred feet down a trail from Imnaha Campground. The tree is at least 300 years old, and its wet, lush environment has encouraged growth. While many trees in the area are over four feet in diameter, The Big Tree is a neighborhood giant. Birdwatchers will find varied thrushes and hermit thrushes in the dense timber around the guard station. Nuthatches, chickadees, and Steller's jays are common. There are also pileated woodpeckers in the surrounding forest, but they can be hard to spot. In the summer, visitor can hike near-by trails. The Sky Lakes Wilderness trail system is particularly popular. The Sky Lake trail network includes a section of the Pacific Crest Trail that follows the crest of the Cascade Mountains. There are several trailheads leading into the Sky Lakes Wilderness within a few miles from the Imnaha Guard Station.\\"Recreation - Sky Lakes Wilderness\\", Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest, United States Forest Service, Medford, Oregon, 20 May 2008.  Access  Site of Imnaha Guard StationThe Imnaha Guard Station is available for public reservations from mid-May to mid-October at a rate of $40 per night. The rental fee is used to preserve and maintain the guard station. The maximum capacity of the cabin is six people; however, the recommended occupancy is four. Guest must reserve the cabin for at least one night. The maximum stay is seven consecutive nights. Visitors must bring their own sleeping bags or bedding, cooking utensils, dishes, garbage bags, toiletries, towels, and first aid kit. Imnaha Guard Station is located north of Butte Falls and south of the unincorporated town of Prospect, just off Forest Service Road 37 (also known as the Parker Meadows Road). Turn off the road at the Imnaha Campground entrance. The Imnaha Guard Station cabin is located at the far end of the campground. In the winter, the road to the guard station is closed to vehicles traffic due to the areas heavy snowfall.

A prime example of Medieval Egyptian architecture, it was built in 1744 by a pioneer Egyptian architect, Katkhuda of Egypt (Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda). Names  Sabil and Drinking-Trough of 'Abd al Rahman Katkhuda * Sabil-Kuttab of 'Abd ar-Rahman Katkhuda * Sabil- Kuttab of Abd al-Rahman Kethuda. Introduction Sabil-Kuttab of Katkhuda is an important monument in Cairo, located on Al-Muizz Lideenillah Street. Sabils and kuttabs were almost everywhere in old Islamic Cairo during Mamluk and Ottoman times. Sabils are facilities providing free, fresh water for thirsty people who are passing by. Kuttabs are primitive kinds of elementary schools that teach children to read and write. The architecture of this time was so delicate that even simple facilities like sabils were designed to be pieces of art. Description The upper kuttab room The Sabil-Kuttab was built to achieve the maximum available visibility in Al-Muizz Lideenillah Street. This was achieved through building it with three free-standing sides. The building consists of two main parts. The southern part is two stories high and contains the sabil and the kuttab from which it derives its name. The northern part is not registered and is being used now as living apartments. The Sabil-Kuttab was built using the Medieval Egyptian style which continued to overwhelm all the styles of such buildings even after the Ottoman conquest in 1517. The building is open on three sides and consists of grey and white stones inlaid with marble reliefs. There are also, tiles with embedded pillars at its corners. The entrance of the Sabil has artistic writings which are verses from the Quran about \\"Ahl Al-Kahf\\". This is commonly seen in Katkhuda's buildings. The inside of the sabil room The kuttab is located on the second floor and is composed of five marbled columns holding the painted roof. The windows are wooden and have beautiful artistic design. This type of window is called \\"mashrabeyya\\", which is characteristic of almost all buildings of Islamic Cairo. The door and the cupboards are wooden and are carved and painted. The structure sits on a triangular site formed by the splitting of Al-Muizz Lideenillah Street into two branches. It serves as a visual focus for the termination of this major spine, especially to those approaching it from the monuments of the Qalawunids in the Bayn al-Qasrayn area. The three sides of the building (northern, southern and western) are symmetrical, accurately identical, and all equal in length. Each contains all the interface to hold half the circular based on two columns of marble. In the middle of the half- circular structure is a big opening that contains the cups for people to drink. The opening is covered by a uniquely designed copper mesh with holes allowing the passage of the cups in between the holes. The entrance The entrance of the Sabil leads to a small corridor with three doors. The first door, on the right leads to the water storing tank; the second door, on the left leads to a room with openings from which the people can drink (the sabil); the third door, opposite to the entrance, leads to the stairs of the kuttab. The horizontal dimensions of the sabil room are 4.0 x 3.5 meters. The kuttab room is present in the second floor and it has the same dimensions as the sabil room with three windows each called mashrabeyya. Architecture * Medieval Egyptian architecture: Egyptian architecture which has produced many wonders of the Islamic architecture. The builder \\\\- Abd al Rahman Katkhuda The Sabil-Kuttab of 'Abd al Rahman Katkhuda of 1744 was named for its patron, a Mamluk amir (prince) and leader of the Egyptian Janissaries. He died in 1776. He did much work in Cairo including developments to Al-Azhar University and mosque. He also rebuilt the dome of the Qala'un Mosque after an earthquake in Egypt. Terminology * Sabil: An Arabic word for the place or the building which offers free fresh drinking water to passers-by or whoever asks for it. * Kuttab: Is a place which provides elementary education for children. It was very common in old Islamic Egypt. Kuttabs are still available as an activity of some mosques to teach the children the Quran.

In his capacity as professor of anthropology at the University of Leningrad and as a representative of the Russian Geographical Society‚Äôs Ethnographic Division, Zolotarev led numerous anthropological expeditions, and would later report the findings in published research papers and at scientific conferences. Following the Russian Revolution, the Soviet government called on Zolotarev and other anthropologists to determine how the isolated ethnic populations of the northern Russian regions were able to adapt to the new Communist society. During the 1920s, Zolotarev studied the Karelian population who lived at the Russian-Finnish border region. In measuring the physical characteristics and social customs of this population, Zolotarev‚Äôs findings were used by the Soviet government to determine that the Karelians could be claimed as Russians rather than as Finns.Roschier, T.Y. -- Anthropologische Untersuchungen an Bewohnern der Landschaft Karjala (Helsinki, 1931) In 1930, Zolotarev led an expedition to study the Sami, Karelians and Russians of the Lake Imandra region. Zolotarev‚Äôs studies determined that tribal tradition continued to dominate in these regions, and that the populations did not comprehend the Soviet notion of ‚Äúsocialist construction.‚Äù Later in 1930, Zolotarev left the Soviet Union and attended an ethnographic conference at the Sorbonne. Upon his return from Paris, he was arrested by the Soviet police. In 1931, Zolotarev and other ethnographers were denounced by the Communist Party for not including a ‚Äúclass-based approach‚Äù in their research. Zolotarev was released in 1933, but was rearrested in 1935 and sent to the prison camp at Mariinsk, where he died. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Zolotarev‚Äôs reputation in Russian anthropological studies was restored. In 2008, the Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences announced it was inaugurating the research program ‚ÄúTracing the D. A.

Guerrero et al. (1992) defined ethnovideography as: ...a research procedure developed at the UPLB Institute of Development Communication, which makes use of small-format video-generated non- alphanumeric data for social analysis. This procedure entails video documentation of five types of subjects: people, places, processes, events and social problems...Guerrero, S.H. 1992. Inception Report for Improving the Implementation of Environmental impact Assessment. Asian Development Bank Credited for coining the term ethnovideography as well as its development as a methodology, Alexander Flor considers it more than a research procedure but a knowledge management system and a form of development intervention as well. Flor was a professor of development communication at the University of the Philippines Los Banos who underwent a Fulbright-PAEF post-doctoral tour in the US in 1989. The tour included a summer at the USC Center for Visual Anthropology, wherein exposure to the use of video in urban anthropology contributed to his early constructs on ethnovideography. Other influences include Professor Alain Martenot who mentored Flor on Direct Cinema technique under a French Foreign Ministry grant. His early work on ethnovideography was sponsored by the Users' Perspectives with Agricultural and Rural Development (UPWARD) facility of the Lima-based International Potato Center.

It is a themed boutique festival which grew from a birthday barbecue into an annual public event. History The festival began as a birthday barbecue for founder Alex Trenchard in 2001. It became a live music event in 2004, with a single stage on the same site with a one-day line-up. In 2005, a second stage was built in an adjacent field; after the final act, organiser Trenchard announced to visitors \\"Don't go to bed!\\". Performers dressed as fairies, who were hidden in the crowd, threw off their cloaks and led the festival-goers to a surprise all-night party. The festival expanded to two days in 2006 with a full-size main stage. 2007 saw a Rio Carnival theme and the blossoming of another festival tradition, fancy dress on Saturday. Headliners were The Rumble Strips, New Young Pony Club, Noisettes and Mr Hudson & The Library. Friendly Fires also played the main stage on Saturday afternoon. In 2008 the festival expanded to three full days, with the Super Furry Animals closing the main stage. Other acts included Florence & The Machine The Maccabees, Glasvegas, Late Of The Pier, and Dan Le Sac Vs Scroobius Pip. The theme was Japanese culture, with outfits varying from Harajuku girls to Wasabi peas. Japanese acts included Melt Banana, Acid Mother's Temple and Cosmic Inferno, while activities included calligraphy demonstrations, tea tastings and binocular football. There was even an underwater disco, which won Standon Calling the Innovation Award at 2008's UK Festival Awards. In 2009 the theme was \\"Space\\", commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landings. The festival site was duly decorated with props including a Tardis from cult BBC sci-fi serial Doctor Who and the DeLorean time machine from the Back to the Future film trilogy. There were several space-related events, including two evening presentations by space expert Jerry Stone of Spaceflight UK. 2010 saw Standon Calling grow, both in terms of space and ticket sales. Themed around \\"Murder On The Standon Express\\", a miniature town with boutique stores, food stands and a fancy dress shop was built on the site. The festival spread from Standon Lordship onto neighbouring fields with additional car parking and camping. Coach travel provided from local train stations. The pre-festival marketing included a series of \\"Road to Standon Calling\\" gigs in London and a competition for smaller upcoming bands to play the main stage on the Sunday night. 2011's theme was 'Gods and Monsters' with Lamb and Battles headlining. 2012's theme 'Journey to the end of the earth' saw headliners Fat Freddies Drop, Beardy Man and Death in Vegas. 2013's theme of 'Running away from the circus' included bands Bastille, Digitalism, The Joy Formidable, De La Soul and Band of Skulls. 2014 had a \\"Lost in Latin America\\" theme with headliners Frank Turner, Maximo Park and Public Enemy. Clean Bandit, Charli XCX, Ella Eyre and Young Fathers were other notable names on the lineup. = Standon Calling 2015 = Celebrating its 10th birthday, Standon Calling was bigger and better than ever before, increasing its capacity to 10,000. The theme was \\"A town of two faces\\", encouraging cowboy/girl costumes by day and by night the festival took a futuristic turn seeing a variety of disco themed costumes. Disco tribute band Uncle Funk & The Boogie Wonderband opened the main stage. Headlining the festival were Little Dragon, The Dandy Warhols and Basement Jaxx with other acts such as Ella Eyre, Slaves and Kwabs filling the bill. =Standon Calling 2020= In common with all UK festivals, Standon Calling 2020 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with tickets being refunded or rolled over to the following year.[https://www.bishopsstortfordindependent.co.uk/news/fears- of-financial-crisis-as-coronavirus-cancels-standon-calling-2020-9109002/ 'Heartbreaking' decision to cancel Standon Calling 2020 music festival because of coronavirus - Bishops Stortford Independent =Conviction= In February 2011 founder Alex Trenchard received a 30 month sentence for defrauding his employer Tesco of ¬£355,000, which he used to fund the event using his company credit card.

He is a former professor at Yale University and had worked for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Education Standish gained his Ph.D degree at Yale University with a thesis, produced in 1968, called \\"Numerical Studies of the Gravitational Problem of N Bodies\\" and his early work at Yale University Observatory concerned celestial mechanics and mathematical astronomy. He joined the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the 1970s and continued his work there until his retirement in about 2006. Work Standish worked on the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris. Early versions refined the accuracy of these fundamental astronomical data-sets by including many recent and accurate observational data, new types of data, using improved data processing methods, including refined equations of motion which more accurately described the actual physics of the solar system.Standish, E. M., Jr.; Keesey, M. S. W.; and Newhall, X. X. (Feb 1976), JPL Development Ephemeris number 96 With the inclusion of the lunar work of J. G. Williams and others, improved solar, planetary and lunar ephemerides were developed (in Dev. Eph. 102) far enough to have a significant historical as well as current coverage.Newhall, X. X., Standish, E. M., & Williams, J. G (1983), DE 102 ‚Äì A numerically integrated ephemeris of the moon and planets spanning forty-four centuries Astronomy and Astrophysics (ISSN 0004-6361), vol. 125, no. 1, Aug. 1983, pp. 150‚Äì167. (The long ephemeris DE102 has since been superseded by DE406, which is a long (6000-year) version of the current standard DE405.) Later versions of the Development Ephemerides include Development Ephemeris DE200, which was officially used in the Astronomical Almanac (and in derived form, also in the Nautical Almanac) as the basis for the ephemerides of sun, moon and planets from 1984 through 2002; and DE405, which has been the basis of the corresponding ephemerides in the Astronomical Almanac and Nautical Almanac from and including 2003, to the present date.For example E M Standish (1997) Jet Propulsion Laboratory Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides, (including DE200, DE405 and DE406) published on CD-ROM and other (e.g. online) formats.(History of USNO Almanac Publications) Later examples of the Development Ephemerides supported the navigation of specific NASA planetary space missions with precise results. Standish's work towards the development of the ephemerides took him also into the field of the history of astronomy, including study of the recently noted occurrence of Neptune in the notes of Galileo, identifying an additional manuscript observation of Neptune by Galileo (who had regarded it as a background star while studying the satellites of Jupiter), and analyzing its significance for the modern-day ephemerides.Standish, E. M. & Nobili, A. M. (1997), Galileo's observations of Neptune, Baltic Astronomy, vol. 6, pp. 97‚Äì104. Standish has collaborated with Dr. Elena V. Pitjeva and Dr. Agnes Fienga on the topic of a better determination of the Astronomical Unit and of the masses of the asteroids. Standish has also dealt with the Pioneer Anomaly issue by modeling it in a modified version of the usual ephemerides and fitting such a new dynamical theory of planetary motions to the usual, well-established observational data set. Awards In 2008, Standish received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal; in 2015, he was given Wesleyan University's Distinguished Alumnus Award.

The Republic of the Congo has an embassy in Moscow. Russia has an embassy in Brazzaville. Political Cooperation Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries (16 March 1964), the initial goal was to provide a solid legal basis for bilateral cooperation. In that time, over 80 agreements and protocols were agreed upon, including a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, an agreement on cultural and scientific cooperation, on air, on economic and technical cooperation, trade, and the establishment of a mixed bilateral commission on economic, scientific and technological cooperation and trade. During the presidency of pro-Western president Pascal Lissouba (1992‚Äì1997), the volume of bilateral relations began to decline significantly. In 1997, Denis Sassou-Nguesso returned to the post of head of state and called for the resumption of multi-faceted cooperation with Russia in all fields. In March 2000, inter-ministerial consultations resumed which were then held in September 2001 in Moscow, where, a protocol on consultations between the foreign ministries was signed. The next round of Russian-Congolese ministerial consultations on bilateral relations took place in August 2010 in Brazzaville. During Adada's talks with Sergey Lavrov, they discussed the state and prospects of bilateral relations, the issue of conflicts on the African continent, among other things. In 2004, a delegation of Brazzaville friendship with Africa Federation Council of Russia, headed by S. V. Anohinym was held. The delegation was received by the President of the Senate of the Congo A. E. Numazalaem. During the negotiations, the possibility of expanding parliamentary exchanges and enhance ties between the Federation was discussed. Meetings with other government officials and business leaders of the Congo were also held. A visit to the Republic of Congo by a Russian parliamentary delegation was led by Deputy Chairman of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation M. V. Gerasimovoy. In 2005 was an inter- ministerial consultations on cooperation in the UN Security Council. In 2006, Denis Sassou-Nguesso as Chairman of the African Union took part in the format of an extended dialogue summit of the \\"Group of Eight\\" in St. Petersburg. Economic Relations Trade and economic cooperation rather actively developed until 1992 two meetings of the Joint Intergovernmental Commission. On account of our loans provided technical assistance in the construction in Congo a number of important industrial and social facilities. At no cost to build a scientific Brazzaville Veterinary Laboratory, the National Printing House, a maternity home. After the start of the internal armed conflict in 1997, bilateral trade relations were suspended. In June of the same year, the representation of Aeroflot in Brazzaville was closed. Certain positive steps outlined in the last period in the field of oil production. Mutual interest in cooperation in the joint exploration and development of oil fields in Congo was demonstrated in June 2006, during a visit to the country head of the Russian oil company \\"Lukoil Overseas Holding\\" A.

Another promising Russian project in Congo are plans for the construction in the city of Pointe-Noire plant for production of primary aluminum (project worked JSC \\"Russian Aluminum\\"). However, the implementation of these plans with investments in the $ 2 billion is only possible in case of a relatively cheap source of electricity. In 2006, in Brazzaville, a delegation of IFC \\"Metropol\\". This association is interested in projects in the field of gold and base metals, as well as considering the issue of the opening of the bank in Congo. In May 2010, in Brazzaville, a bilateral business forum with the participation of Russian economic operators and local business organizations, in which discussed ways to enhance cooperation in areas such as energy, transport, mining and finance. As a result of the joint forum signed a cooperation agreement between the chambers of commerce of the two countries, aimed at creating favorable conditions for the development of trade and economic relations between Russia and the Republic of Congo. The question of opening a branch of KAMAZ, representative of St.Petersburg telecommunications company \\"General Satellite\\", started to register the company, \\"Fair Pay\\" (EFT instant payments).

The Dominican Republic signed a treaty with Japan in 1956 to accept migrants for agricultural labour, one of the earliest in a series of treaties signed by Japan's newly established emigration bureau. From the Japanese government's perspective, the goal of the emigration policy was to improve Japan's international reputation by having Japanese people contribute to the development of foreign countries. Latin America was the only potential outlet for emigration; the United States' Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907 and Immigration Act of 1924 and Australia's White Australia policy eliminated the option of settlement in those two countries, while anti-Japanese sentiment in Asia due to Japan's wartime atrocities meant that none of those countries would accept Japanese migrants either. Rafael Trujillo, dictator of the Dominican Republic since 1930, for his part sought to use European and later Japanese migrants as a demographic buffer against black Haitian squatters, by settling them along the country's western border with Haiti. The Japanese migrants came to the Dominican Republic with the intention of permanent settlement in the country. They had been promised furnished houses, land ready for planting, and credit until the first harvest. More than 200 families totaling 1,319 people braved the month-long ocean voyage and arrived from 1956 to 1959. However, the May 1961 assassination of Rafael Trujillo and a subsequent civil war, plunged the country into chaos and political violence, leaving many of the governmental promises of assistance and protection broken. The migrants entirely abandoned five of their eight settlements. Beginning in 1961, 70 families fled to other Latin American countries which had agreed with the Japanese government to resettle them, including Brazil, Argentina, and Bolivia, while 111 other families returned to Japan. Japanese settlement in the Dominican Republic never grew to a very large scale; protests over the extreme hardships and broken government promises faced by the initial group of migrants set the stage for the end of state-supported labour emigration in Japan. By 1962, just 276 Japanese remained in the country. Of the forty-seven families which settled in Constanza and the nearby valley, just seven remained. However, they clung tenuously to their land, improving irrigation facilities and introducing the Japanese bokashi composting technique. By the 1990s, Constanza had become a major area of agricultural production, growing over 90% of the country's vegetables. Monument dedicated to Japanese Immigration in Santo Domingo (Paseo Bellini) There is monument dedicated to the Japanese immigration in the Paseo Presidente Bellini. It is a statue of a man, a woman holding a baby on her back and a child looking at the front. You can find a stone with the names of Japanese immigrants. Political implications The failure of migration to the Dominican Republic marked an important turning point in Japanese emigration policy. Along with rising wages in Japan due to labour shortages, the widespread reporting of the tragedy faced by emigrants to the Dominican Republic dampened popular and official enthusiasm for emigration; the total number of emigrants from Japan fell by nearly two-thirds from 1961 to 1962, and in 1968, Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs finally abolished its Central-South America Emigration Bureau. Backlash would continue for decades; in 2000, more than 170 of the migrants sued the Japanese government, charging that it lied to them about conditions in the Dominican Republic in order to trick them into leaving Japan. The Japanese government settled the lawsuit in July 2006, paying US$17,000 to each plaintiff as well as US$10,000 to non-plaintiff migrants; then-Prime Minister of Japan Junichiro Koizumi made a formal statement apologising for the \\"immense suffering due to the government's response at the time\\". According to Japanese diplomat Teruyuki Ishikawa, the presence of the remaining Japanese immigrants and their descendants is the major reason why the Dominican Republic is the biggest recipient of official development aid from Japan. Language and culture Some of the initial Japanese migrants to the Dominican Republic still speak little Spanish.: \\"But some of Constanza's inhabitants don't speak Spanish. You're more likely to hear Japanese in a suburb called Colonia Japonesa.\\" Their spoken Japanese is also full of archaisms, such as the Sino-Japanese-derived instead of the modern loanword for \\"camera\\".

The show aired in the 1970s and '80s, when there was only one television station in Israel, TV was still black and white, and there were only a few hours of television a day.

Nira Rabinovitch, now involved in new age ideas in Israel, co-starred with Kishkashta in many of the show's episodes, and sang the song Ma Pit'om with Kishkashta in the opening act. In Israel, the cactus is a symbol of Israeli- born Jews, called sabras (\\"prickly pear\\"), as opposed to those who immigrated later, even though the cactus itself is not a native plant. Kishkashta embodied the image of Israeli sabra identity, a character \\"rough from the outside but soft and sweet from the inside.\\" He had a deep, melancholic voice and possessed an independent spirit exuding the dugri (straight) sabra character for which Israelis are known.

He supported 2011 toll hikes based on PANYNJ capital improvement plan but acknowledged the process to enact them as \\"terrible\\" and commissioners' non-attendance at public hearings \\"an insult to the public.\\" He stated intentions to improve the agency response to sunshine laws and whistleblower laws.

Works ranges from $2,000 to a $1 million Renoir; as well as historic artists, it also represents contemporary artists, such as Southfield resident Marcus Glenn and Israeli sculptor, Yaacov Agam, who makes optical and kinetic art. The gallery is open to the public and provides a service for educational visits. In addition to its main gallery and art conservation facility in Southfield, Michigan, Park West operates a framing and distribution center in Miami Lakes, Florida, and maintains a catalog and Internet sales business. The distribution center receives 4,000 to 6,000 works of art a week to process and frame, and maintains a stock of 6 to 7 million feet of picture framing to meet demands. The company also funds the not-for-profit Park West Foundation, which provides philanthropic support to various groups. Since 1993, Park West Gallery has been conducting fine art auctions aboard cruise ships, and is the largest business in this field, selling nearly 300,000 artworks a year with a revenue in excess of $300 million. It currently operates on the cruise lines: Carnival, Celebrity Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean International, Princess Cruises, and MSC. Park West states that it is \\"the world's largest art dealer\\" based on its volume of sales. The auctions, like shows, gambling and shopping, are a popular aspect of entertainment during the cruise, and provide concessionary income for the cruise operator.* However, the company's sales tactics have led to several lawsuits and media investigations.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-12-14/ever-bought- artwork-on-a-cruise-prepare-to-be-seasick Morris Shapiro is the gallery director and has been part of the company for 25 years. He said the gallery has created a \\"new paradigm in how art is presented to the public\\". Park West Gallery does not reveal financial reports, as it is privately owned. Scaglione stated the 2007 revenue was $300‚Äì$400 million. Half of its revenue comes from 85 auctioneers on cruise-ships, and the rest of the revenue is from promotions in hotels and sales in its gallery.  Philanthropy  Park West Gallery established its Park West Foundation in 2006, a non-profit that assists young men and women who are exiting the foster care system. As of 2013, the foundation has assisted more than 350 individuals with housing, transportation, jobs and clothing. It also provides tuition assistance for post-secondary education through partnerships with universities. Events the foundation is involved with include Jump Shot Your Future, which assists 14 to 25-year-old youth learn how to pursue post-secondary education; as well as KidSpeak, an annual event where foster youth can speak directly to county and state lawmakers about their experiences. The gallery also donates artwork to support fundraising efforts for non-profits, including the American Cancer Society. Artists that Park West Gallery represent contribute as well, such as Autumn de Forest, the gallery‚Äôs youngest artist, honoring the rebuilding effort following Hurricane Sandy as well as contributing to ‚ÄúThis Bar Saves Lives;‚Äù Romero Britto supports Best Buddies International; and Peter Max for his efforts with organizations such as the Humane Society and cancer research. In the News In September 2008, the gallery instituted a policy where any item bought from them could be returned for a refund (less the buyer's premium) or exchanged for another artwork within specified timeframes. That policy was expanded in 2019 with the debut of the company's new 50/50/50 Satisfaction Guarantee, which gives customers 50 days to return any art with no fees or 50 weeks to exchange it. In 2016, it was announced that a \\"small piece\\" of a 2011 lawsuit against Park West could be reinstated in court after the Michigan Supreme Court dismissed the entire case. However, in 2018, Park West founder Albert Scaglione stated that all lawsuits against the company had been dismissed, claiming that, in every case, the judges found that \\"these claims did not have any merit.\\" In 2016, Albert Scaglione and artist Tim Yanke were involved in a serious crash in Scaglione's Tesla Model X. Scaglione claimed that the car was in Tesla's Autopilot feature when it crashed. A Tesla spokesperson contested this claim, saying that there was \\"no reason to believe\\" Autopilot was engaged at the time. In March 2018, Park West Museum opened in Southfield, Michigan, a free-to-the-public museum with galleries devoted to Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and other iconic artists. In September 2018, Park West released a study titled \\"Are Millennials Interested in Art?,\\" citing research that claims that \\"four out of five Millennials said that art was important to them, the highest percentage of any age group.\\"  References   External links  * Park West website * Park West Gallery Foundation Category:American art dealers Category:Contemporary art galleries in the United States Category:1969 establishments in Michigan Category:Art galleries in Michigan Category:Privately held companies based in Michigan Category:Art galleries established in 1969 ","title":"Park West Gallery"},{"id":"18156174","text":"The Last of the Secret Agents? is a 1966 American film that spoofs the spy film genre, starring the then-popular comedy team of Allen & Rossi. Plot Two Americans in Paris (Allen & Rossi) are reluctantly recruited by the Good Guys Institute (GGI) led by J. Frederick Duval (John Williams) to thwart the plans of the evil crime and espionage organisation THEM led by Zoltan Schubach (Theo Marcuse). THEM has plans to steal priceless international art treasures, most notably the Venus de Milo. In addition to the then popular spy film genre, the film spoofs many other items of the day such as cigarette commercials.

Paramount ordered the producer to have Sinatra sing in the film with Hazlewood quickly composing a title song for her reminiscent of John Barry's Thunderball. The resulting song, \\"The Last of the Secret Agents\\", did not appear on the Pete King soundtrack album. At the end of Nancy Sinatra's performance of the title song, she suffers a comic \\"wardrobe malfunction\\" leaving her only clad in bra, panties, stocking and heels. Neal Hefti wrote the song You Are for Steve Rossi, which does appear on the soundtrack, as does the song \\"Don Jose, Ole\\" written by Tolkin and Abbott. Sinatra's title song was reused as an end title song in Bill Murray's The Man Who Knew Too Little. Production Allen & Rossi were a popular comedy team in their nightclub and television appearances, notably on The Ed Sullivan Show. Paramount Pictures had highly successful comedy teams of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in the 1940s and Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis in the 1950s and no doubt wished to recreate their success with the duo's screen debut in the film. (This proved not to be the case, and no sequels were produced for the film, although the duo did appear in the 1974 film Allen and Rossi Meet Dracula and Frankenstein.Allen and Rossi Meet Dracula and Frankenstein, IMDb) Mel Tolkin had written for Your Show of Shows and had many other comedy credits, whilst Norman Abbott, the nephew of Bud Abbott, had the experience of directing many successful American television comedy shows. Steve Rossi wanted to incorporate material from their comedy routine into the film but his ideas were refused.

Construction The Rocket Ball, patented in 1848 by Walter Hunt, consisted of a lead bullet with a deep hollow in the rear, running a majority of the length of the cartridge. The hollow, like that of the Minie ball, served to seal the bullet into the bore, but Rocket Ball put the cavity to further use. By packing the deep cavity with powder, and sealing it with a cap with a small hole in the rear for ignition, the Rocket Ball replaced the earlier paper cartridge with a durable package capable of being fed from a magazine. The cap was blown out of the bore upon firing. The Rocket Ball was used in magazine fed lever action guns, allowing the first easily manufactured repeating single chamber firearms. Use While the Rocket Ball provided the means of making practical repeating firearms, it was not an ideal solution. The limited volume in the base of the bullet severely limited the amount of powder that could be used, and thus limited the potential velocity and range of the cartridge. With muzzle energy of only about 56 foot-pounds (76 joules), the Rocket Ball was less powerful than even the most feeble of modern \\"pocket pistol\\" cartridges, such as .25 ACP. Despite these limitations, the Rocket Ball was used in a number of attempts at making a commercially successful firearm, culminating in the Volcanic Repeating Arms Company. The Volcanic cartridge went one step further, adding a primer to the cap of the Rocket Ball, making the ammunition completely self-contained. The Jennings rifle, top, shows the hammer and nipple needed for the Rocket Ball's external percussion cap.

Career =College= Plaisted committed to Brigham Young University after earning Texas 5A First Team All-State honors at Clark High School in San Antonio, Texas. He played sparingly in five games during the 2004-05 season before receiving a medical redshirt. He made a strong impression in his first full year playing for the Cougars, leading the team in scoring and rebounding, and earning the Mountain West Conference Freshman of the Year award. He was also named national freshman of the week on three occasions by various media outlets. Plaisted had six double-doubles throughout the year, including 22 points and 16 rebounds in a come-from-behind overtime victory at home against TCU. A notoriously bad free throw shooter, Plaisted went 8-8 from the line in that game against TCU, hitting several key free throws late in the game to secure the win. Later that year, this time playing on the road against TCU, he totaled 17 points and 18 rebounds - the most rebounds by a BYU player in a single game since 1991. Plaisted's statistics declined somewhat during his sophomore year as teammate Keena Young emerged as BYU's go-to guy, ultimately winning the conference player of the year award. Despite this, Plaisted scored a career-high 27 points in a game twice that season, including a standout performance against Wyoming in the MWC tournament in which he shot 10-13 from the floor and added 10 rebounds. The following year, with Young graduated from the program, Plaisted resumed as BYU's best post player, and responded by averaging 15.6 points and 7.7 rebounds per game.ESPN - Trent Plaisted Stats, News, Photos - Brigham Young Cougars He received national attention early in the year for his play in the Las Vegas Invitational Tournament, posting 21 points and 12 rebounds in an upset victory over #6 Louisville, and then tallying 24 points and 17 rebounds the following night against #1 North Carolina. He finished the year with eight double-doubles, including 18 points and 18 rebounds against Pepperdine, matching his career high for rebounds. BYU finished the season 14-2 in MWC play, clinching their second consecutive conference championship. Plaisted earned numerous awards for his play, including First Team All-MWC, NABC All- District 13, and USBWA All-District VIII. =Professional= Plaisted entered the NBA Draft in 2008, forgoing his senior season at BYU. He was an intriguing prospect, with good size (6'11\\" and 245 pounds) and terrific athleticism for a big man, including a 41-inch vertical leap and a 4.6-second time in the 40-yard dash.

It is located in a small town of Banki of Cuttack district in Odisha. The presiding deity is an eight-armed goddess Chamunda, locally known as Maa Charchika Devi. She is seated on a prostrate human body and wearing a garland of human skulls. She displays khadga, shula, katari and varadamudra in her four right hands whereas the four left hands represent severed head, blood-cup, ‚Äò‚Äôdamru‚Äô‚Äô and leaving a finger of the remaining hand soaked in blood. This temple is situated on top of a small hillock Ruchika Parvata on the banks of the Renuka river in the small town of Banki in Cuttack district of Odisha. History Charchika devi, the eight armed goddess The present temple was reconstructed in the 19th century. But the remarkable point is the enshrining deity Maa Charchika on iconographical point of view can be assigned to the 9th ‚Äì 10th centuries A.D. i.e. Bhaumakara rule in Odisha. It is believed that the Charchika idol was created by Parashurama. The temple has a pidha vimana, jagamohana and a wooden mandapa known as \\"sunyavahini mandapa\\" of impoverished Kalingan order. Stone is used for the construction of the temple and the entire surface is thickly lime plastered and white washed. The ceiling of the mandapa is made of wood whereas the pillars are in stone. The ceiling of the mandapa is profusely carved and painted. The wooden ceiling of the mandpa is relieved with episodes from Bhagavata Purana with intervening decoration of animals and birds like - elephant, duck, parrot, peacock, etc.; floral motifs, lotus medallions, scroll and jali works, animal hunting, horse rider, gaja- vidalas, makaramukha, mithuna and maithuna images. Besides, the parsvadevata niches enshrine four-armed Chamunda, four-armed Mahisasuramardini Durga and an eight-armed Chamunda on the north, west and southern side respectively.Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts The Renuka River was recreated by the flood of 1982. It is believed that one devotee who worshiped Maa Charchika, after pleasing her, took away all ornaments of Maa Charchika and build a house where this river is currently flowing. As Maa Charchika was furious with this, she created this River Renuka to punish him and to destroy his home. This temple is situated in the heart of Banki. The temple is most frequently visited at the time of Durga Puja, a Hindu festival in the month of October, when thousands of devotees come to be blessed. Kumar Purnima, a Hindu festival celebrated 5 days after Dusshera, is very famous here. One more Temple of Maa Charchika is at Mathura, near the Yamuna river.

Background  The original suit was decided by the Court of Claims in favor of petitioner, Seminole Nation, in the amount of $1,317,087.27. The Supreme Court reversed this decision for want of jurisdiction. The jurisdictional barrier was then removed by statute, and Seminole Nation of Oklahoma filed a second amended petition in the Court of Claims, reasserting the six claims previously denied by the Supreme Court. The Court of Claims denied three claims entirely, allowed one in full and two in part. Seminole Nation was awarded $18,388.30. However, the United States was entitled to gratuity offsets in the amount of $705,337.33, and as such, the second amended petition was dismissed. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on a petition challenging the lower court's decision on each of the five claims disallowed in whole or in part. The Court also agreed to review the items which the Court of Claims included in the list of gratuity offsets.  Opinion of the Court  = Holding = The Court found three of the Seminole Nation's five claims for reimbursement from the United States government to be without merit. The remaining two claims were remanded to the lower Court of Claims to determine whether the government breached its fiduciary duty to the Seminoles by making payments to tribal leaders with knowledge of the potential for mismanagement of funds. = Relevance = This case is often cited \\"as authority for the application of fiduciary principles to the government in the administration of Indian affairs.\\"David H. Getches, Charles F. Wilkinson & Robert A. Williams, Jr., Cases and Materials on Federal Indian Law, 342 (5th ed., West 2005). = Case summary = The Seminole Nation's claims for reimbursement related to language contained in the Treaties of 1856 and 1866 and to various agreements and acts of Congress. The Nation's claims were divided into five separate items. The Court dismissed the first claim for reimbursement, finding the Treaty of March 21, 1866 released the government of its obligation to pay the outstanding balance owed under the Treaty of August 7, 1856. The third claim for reimbursement was disallowed upon the finding that the annual interest from the trust fund established under the Treaty of 1866 was, in fact, directed to its designated purpose (support of local schools). The fourth claim is also in reference to the Treaty of 1866, which provided additionally that the Government construct, \\"at an expense not exceeding ten thousand ($10,000) dollars, suitable agency buildings' on the Seminole reservation.\\" The Court of Claims found that $10,000 was expended to fulfill this treaty obligation in 1872, and an agency building was erected on the reservation in 1873. Seminole Nation did not claim that the building was unsuitable and, furthermore, the treaty required the Government to erect a suitable building not in excess of $10,000. The Government's obligation was fulfilled and the fourth claim was disallowed. With regard to the second and fifth claims, the cause was remanded to the lower court for further material findings of fact. The second claim concerned language from Article VIII of the Treaty of 1856 which provided that the government would establish a $500,000 trust fund with the annual interest to be distributed equally among the individual members of the Seminole Tribe. During the years 1870-1874 the government made payments totaling $66,422.64. A portion of this amount was paid to the tribal treasurer and the remainder was paid to the designated creditors of the tribe. This arrangement for distribution was requested by the Seminole General Council. The Seminole Nation argued that the Treaty was violated since annuity payments were made to the General Council when the Treaty stipulated that \\"payments were to be made per capita for the benefit of each individual Indian.\\" The Court found merit to this claim and cited \\"a well established principle of equity that a third party who pays money to a fiduciary for the benefit of the beneficiary, with knowledge that the fiduciary intends to misappropriate the money or otherwise be false to his trust, is a participant in the breach of trust and liable therefore to the beneficiary.\\" The Commissioner of Indian Affairs received reports as early as 1870 discussing the unjust distribution of funds, \\"recommend[ing] that the provisions of the treaty be rigidly enforced[.]\\" The Court went on to describe Government's responsibility to the Indian tribes as a \\"moral obligation[] of the highest responsibility and trust.\\" It is with this standard that the Court remanded the case to the Court of Claims for further review. The fifth claim for reimbursement was in regard to payments made \\"during the fiscal years 1899 to 1907,\\" which totaled $864,702.58. These payments were made to the Seminole tribal treasurer. Though the Court found the government did not act improperly by making payment to the treasurer (as the provision did not stipulate per capita distribution), the Court stated it could still be found liable if it violated its fiduciary duty in the manner discussed above. It was documented that the Commission of the Five Civilized Tribes notified Congress and the Secretary of the Interior of the rampant corruption throughout tribal governments before the payments were made to the Seminole treasurer. More pointedly, the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs were informed in January 1898 of \\"complaints of misgovernment, venality, and fraudulent conduct on the part of Seminole leaders[.]\\" The Court remanded the two claims to the lower Court of Claims for further findings of fact, to determine whether the government breached its fiduciary duty. The Court provided instruction that if government officials made payments to tribal leaders with knowledge of their corruption and potential mismanagement, the government would be found liable and responsible for reimbursing the Seminole Nation. Lastly, the Court ruled that in reviewing the gratuitous offsets, the Court of Claims must designate the precise expenditures to be offset against the Government's liability so as to avoid a double credit. This portion was also remanded to the lower court for further review.

Though Sears still operates a retail store on the ground floor, the rest of the enormous complex has remained vacant. The complex has been the subject of several renovation proposals since the mid-1990s. Construction and architecture Side view In December 1926, Sears, Roebuck & Company of Chicago announced that it would build a nine-story, height-limit building on East Ninth Street (later renamed Olympic Boulevard) at Soto Street to be the mail-order distribution center for the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast states, to be constructed by Scofield Engineering Company. Architectural work was handled by George Nimmens Company. The building was erected in six months, using materials that were all made in Los Angeles County, with the exception of the steel window sashes. To accomplish the feat, the contractor had six steam shovels and a large labor force working night and day shifts. It was reported that rock and sand for the cement work were being delivered to the site at the rate of twenty carloads daily. When the building was completed in late June 1927, the Los Angeles Times reported that: > \\"All records for the erection of a huge structure were believed to have been > broken when last week the Scofield Engineering Construction Company turned > over the new $5,000,000 department store and mail-order house at Ninth > street and Boyle avenue to Sears, Roebuck & Co., having completed this > height-limit project in 146 working days, or 171 days of elapsed time.\\" The building had nine stories and a basement, with a total floor area of approximately . The building was one of nine Sears mail-order distribution centers built between 1910 and 1929. Operation The sprawling distribution center was a marvel of technology when it opened; employees filled orders by roller-skating around the facility, picking up items and dropping them onto corkscrew slides for distribution by truck or rail. The building was one of the largest in Los Angeles, and it attracted more than 100,000 visitors in its first month of operation, not including shoppers at the ground-floor retail store. Over the years, the building's Art Deco tower and \\"Sears\\" sign became a \\"beacon for Eastsiders returning home on area freeways,\\" and has been described by the Los Angeles Conservancy as \\"one of the dominant visual icons of the Eastside\\" of Los Angeles.ULI Los Angeles report, p. 1 Closure The distribution center was closed in January 1992, eliminating jobs for 585 full- time workers and 775 part-timers. The facility's general manager said at the time that the Boyle Heights center was the most expensive that Sears operated, partly because the facilities were \\"outdated.\\" Vacancy  In 2004, developer MJW Investments announced it had acquired the building and would make it the centerpiece of a proposed $350 million, retail and residential redevelopment project. MJW planned to convert the Sears building into 480 condominiums, 180 apartments, and of stores and restaurants. The planned redevelopment was met with resistance in the Boyle Heights community. Many feared the development could spawn a gentrification of the area, squeezing out low-income housing. Others complained that the proposal for 150 affordable housing units was not enough and not the right kind. Others expressed concern that the large retail development would damage small businesses with roots in the community. In May 2006, MJW announced that, despite having paid $40 million for the building and investing another $10 million in the project, it would put the building up for sale. Boyle Heights native and boxer Oscar De La Hoya, who said he used to shop as a child at the Boyle Heights Sears store with his mother, tried to revive the redevelopment effort. De la Hoya, with investment from other developers, made bids to acquire the property in 2007 and again in 2008, but no deal was consummated.Daniel Miller, \\"East L.A.'s Golden Boy Lands Big One,\\" Los Angeles Business Journal, August 6, 2007Los Angeles Business Journal, cited in Dakota Smith, \\"De La Hoya Pulls Out Of Boyle Heights Sears Deal,\\" Curbed L.A., January 7, 2008 Weinstein sold the property in 2013 to Izek Shomof, who announced plans \\"to bring it back to life, perhaps with housing, offices and stores.\\" Historic designation The building was designated a Historic-Cultural Monument (HCM #788) by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission in August 2004, and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in April 2006.

Since it is the only Catholic church currently in service within the city of Hangzhou itself, it is also known simply as TiƒÅnzh«î T√°ng (Â§©‰∏ªÂ†Ç) or \\"the Catholic church\\". History =Beginnings= Li Zhizao (Êùé‰πãËóª) was a Ming Dynasty official-scholar and Catholic from Hangzhou working in Beijing, who had been converted and baptized by Matteo Ricci. In 1611, when he received news of his father's death, he hurried back to Hangzhou and on the way brought with him two Jesuit priests from Nanjing, Lazaro Cattaneo and Nicolas Trigault. They took care of Li Zhizao's father's funeral and on May the 8th at the Li family's residence held the first Mass ever in Hangzhou. One of the new converts in Hangzhou was a wealthy Imperial Inspector named Yang Tingyun (Êù®Âª∑Á≠†). He and his entire family were originally Buddhist, but upon his conversion he went so far as to turn his home's Buddhist altar into a chapel. Together, Li Zhizao, Yang Tingyun and Xu Guangqi (of Shanghai) are known as the \\"Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism\\" (‰∏âÂ§ßÊü±Áü≥). Later in 1616, during a period of persecution against Christians in Nanjing, many refugees fled to Hangzhou where they were at first housed in the homes of Li Zhizao and Yang Tingyun. It was soon realized that a better solution would be required, and in 1627 Yang Tingyun bought a piece of land near Wulin Gate (Ê≠¶ÊûóÈó®) on Guan Road (ËßÇÂ∑∑) and had Hangzhou's first church built there, slightly west of where today's church lies. It was soon followed the next year by another church constructed near Qiantang Gate (Èí±Â°òÈó®, once one of the 10 gates in the old city walls of Hangzhou, located at the intersection of today's Hubin ÊπñÊª® and Qingchun Â∫ÜÊò• roads).

Its original Romanesque form was designed with three naves, and two rows of columns separating them. The two side altars venerated statues of St. Peter and St. Paul while the central altar was for the worship of Christ. At the time of its completion it had been lavishly decorated and was said by many to be the most beautiful church in China. Of note were also the large frescoes painted all over the church, that as the Jesuit Charles Le Gobien notes in his \\"Histoire de l'√©dit de l'empereur de la Chine\\", were based on standard Western imagery (the conversion of St. Paul, the conversion of the emperor Constantine, etc.), but were painted by Chinese artists in the Chinese brush style. In 1691, during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing Dynasty, the governor of Zhejiang, ZhƒÅng P√©ngh√© (Âº†ÈπèÁøÆ) banned Catholicism, took control of the cathedral and ordered all books contained within to be burned. The following year, under pressure from the Italian Jesuit Prosper Intorcetta, the emperor lifted the ban and ordered the Hangzhou cathedral to be fully restored. Nevertheless, the church was severely damaged later that same year in a fire and remained unrepaired for many years until 1699, when the Kangxi Emperor himself, who was on a tour of southern China, passed by the church. He ordered one of his ministers to go in and inspect the place, after which he decided to grant the church 200 silver taels to complete the repairs. He also had the two characters \\"ÊïïÂª∫\\" (ch√¨ji√†n, \\"built by order of the emperor\\") inscribed upon the church gate. In 1730, the Yongzheng Emperor again forbade the practice of Catholicism, and the church edifice was subsequently converted into a Taoist temple by the name of TiƒÅnh√≤u G≈çng (Â§©ÂêéÂÆ´, Temple of the Celestial Empress), but only after the emperor had chiseled his father Kangxi's \\"ÊïïÂª∫\\" inscription off the gateway. Later, in 1848, it came into the possession of a group of English, Dutch, and French Lazarists, whereupon it resumed operations as a Catholic church. During the Cultural Revolution the cathedral was put to other uses for a period of about 12 years. The main church hall was divided into 10 or more smaller cells for imprisoning criminals. The other church buildings were also divided up as residences. Finally in 1982 the cathedral reopened, and on December 12 of that year, Mass was once again celebrated. By 1986 the all the families that had moved in during the Cultural Revolution were relocated off of the property. The cathedral is now protected as a Municipal Historic Site. Mass Chinese masses are held every Sunday morning. 6:30am, 8:30am, 10:30am and 7:00pm. A large congregation attend and can overflow into the car park for the 8:30am service. There is an English mass held on Saturday evenings at 6:30pm. The church has two choirs which practice regularly, and also holds Bible studies and classes for catechumens. Gateway preceding the tomb of Martino Martini Tomb of Martino Martini Hangzhou is also home to the gravesite of Martino Martini. After the cathedral had just barely been completed, the renowned cartographer, historian, and missionary died suddenly of cholera in June 1661, and was buried in the Dafangjing Jesuit Cemetery (Â§ßÊñπ‰∫ïÂç´Âå°ÂõΩÁ≠âÂÖ¨Â¢ì) on the north side of Beigao Feng (ÂåóÈ´òÂ≥∞). His remains were found to be undecayed as late as 20 years after his death, as attested by both Belgian Jesuit Philippe Couplet and Prosper Intorcetta, and they therefore became the object of great veneration. During the Cultural Revolution the site was completely destroyed, but was fully restored in 1985, although by that time it was no longer known which bones exactly had belonged to Martino Martini. The cemetery is now protected as a Provincial Historic Site. The rectangular memorial crypt faces west and is preceded by a Chinese style \\"spirit way\\" (Á•ûÈÅì) walkway and \\"pailou\\" (ÁâåÊ•º) gateway on which is inscribed in Chinese the line from the Apostles' Creed, \\"I believe in the resurrection of the body\\" (Êàë‰ø°ËÇâË∫´‰πãÂ§çÊ¥ª). It is located right next to the Xihu Beer Factory (Ë•øÊπñÂï§ÈÖíÂéÇ) on Xixi Road (Ë•øÊ∫™Ë∑Ø) and can be entered by request. Statue of Sr. Hacard near the chapel of her Sisters of Charity Hospital Stained-glass from the hospital chapel. The Latin inscription is a reference to Luke 4 and reads: EVANGELIZARE PAUPERIBUS MISIT ME, meaning \\"He sent me to preach the Gospel to the poor\\". Sisters of Charity Hospital In the 1920s Hangzhou was also the object of some French missionary activity when a nun named Sister Hacard from the Sisters of Charity began to build a hospital compound on Hangzhou's Daomao Road (ÂàÄËåÖÂ∑∑). It was founded in 1922 and gradually added to until 1928. The site also included a Gothic-style chapel which, with the one exception of a Marian statue it once contained, survived the Cultural Revolution remarkably intact, stained-glass windows and all. Sr. Hacard's hospital is now part of the Hangzhou City Red Cross Hospital that can be found enclosed by Daomao Road, Fengqi Road (Âá§Ëµ∑Ë∑Ø), and East Huancheng Road (ÁéØÂüé‰∏úË∑Ø). While the hospital buildings are still in use as such, the chapel has not been used for religious purposes since before the Cultural Revolution and instead is now used by the hospital as a hall for giving presentations. A statue of Sr. Hacard has since been erected in the middle of a nearby garden and the chapel, being the only Gothic structure in all of Hangzhou, is today protected as a Provincial Historic Site. Convent of the Sacred Heart The Catholic Church in Hangzhou also includes a nuns' convent dedicated to the Sacred Heart located in an old historic building on the slopes of Mt.

From the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Army dedicated some line regiments as specific light infantry troops, were trained under the Shorncliffe System devised by Sir John Moore and Sir Kenneth MacKenzie Douglas. The light infantry had the nickname \\"light bobs\\" first used during the American Wars of Independence, and commonly applied to the Light Division during the Napoleonic wars.Gavin K. Watt,Rebellion in the Mohawk Valley: The St. Leger Expedition of 1777crossing by David Hackett FischerWellington's Infantry by Bryan Fosten Origins of British light infantry Until the beginning of the 19th century, the British Army relied on irregulars and mercenaries to provide most of its light infantry.Chappell, p. 6 The light infantry performed with merit during the Seven Years' War (or the French and Indian War), particularly the battle of the Quebec when they scaled cliffs and engaged French forces on the Plains of Abraham above. In the Seven Years' War and the American wars, the need for more skirmishers, scouts resulted in a temporary secondment of regular line companies.Chappell, pp. 6‚Äì7 These were frequently denigrated by regular army officers, and the specially trained companies were disbanded when the need for them decreased.Chappell, p. 7 It was Lord George Howe who is credited with beginning to truly promote a dedicated light infantry training regiment, based on the battle tactics of the American Woodland Nations, during the Ticonderoga Campaign of 1758. From 1770 regular regiments were required to include a company of light infantry in their establishment, but the training of such light troops was inconsistent, and frequently inadequate.Chappell, pp 6,9 Beginning a restructure of the British Army in the late 18th century, the Duke of York recognised a need for dedicated light troops.Chappell, pp. 8, 10 Certainly, the lack of such troops presented a further concern for the British Army, newly faced with a war against Napoleon and his experienced light infantry, the chasseurs.Chappell, p. 8 During the early years of the war against Revolutionary France, the British Army was bolstered by light infantry mercenaries from Germany and the Low Countries, including the nominally British 60th Foot. \\"It was finally decided in December 1797 to raise a fifth battalion for the 60th Royal Americans from the foreign, predominantly German, rifle corps still serving with British forces as a J√§ger battalion. Here it must be stressed that, of course, Riflemen differed from the generality of light infantry in that they had a specialist role as sharpshooters.... Consequently, on 30 December 1797, 17 officers and 300 rank and file of the chasseur companies of Hompesch's Light Infantry under their existing Lieutenant-Colonel, Baron Francis de Rottenberg, were so constituted.\\"Elliott-Wright, p. 40 The British light infantry companies proved inadequate against the experienced French during the Flanders campaign, and in the Netherlands in 1799, and infantry reform became urgent.Chappell, pp. 9‚Äì10 \\"So useful had the fifth battalion proved, that in 1799 a rifle company was attached to each of the red-coated battalions of the 60th: the first, second, third, fourth. At the same time, a further two battalions of Germans were raised to serve as Riflemen and dressed in green, becoming the sixth and seventh battalions of the 60th.... [B]y late 1799 the British Army, albeit in its 'foreign' regiment, the 60th, already had in excess of three battalions of Riflemen and the Duke of York needed little additional evidence that a specialist 'British' rifle corps was now long overdue.\\"Elliott-Wright, pp. 46-47 Shorncliffe System Map of Shorncliffe Camp - 1801. In 1801, the \\"Experimental Corps of Riflemen\\" was raised (later designated the 95th Rifles), and a decision was made to train some line regiments in light infantry techniques, so they might operate as both light and line infantry. Sir John Moore, a proponent of the light infantry model, offered his own regiment of line infantry, the 52nd Foot, for this training, at Shorncliffe Camp.Chappell, p. 11 Thus, in 1803, the 52nd became the first regular British Army regiment to be designated \\"Light Infantry\\".Wickes, p. 78 They were followed shortly afterwards by the 43rd Foot; several other line regiments were designated \\"light infantry\\" in 1808.Chappell, p. 17 Much of the training was undertaken by Lieutenant-Colonel Kenneth MacKenzie, who devised many of the tactics of light infantry training.Chappell, p. 12 Moore wrote of his regiment in his diary that \\"it is evident that not only the officers, but that each individual soldier, knows perfectly what he has to do; the discipline is carried on without severity, the officers are attached to the men and the men to the officers.\\"quoted in Glover, p. 74 This had much to do with the method of training; unlike other regiments, officers drilled with the men and were expected to be familiar with drill routines, including weapons training.Chappell, p. 13 The ranks also received additional training, and were encouraged to develop initiative and self-direction; while skirmishing in the field they would need to react without direct orders. =Fighting techniques= While most regiments fought in tight formation, allowing easy administration of orders; with light infantry working in small groups, in advance of the main line, complicated bugle calls were developed to pass orders.Chappell, p. 15 Because of the use of the bugle, rather than the standard line infantry drum, the bugle horn had been the badge of light infantry regiments since 1770, adapted from the Hanoverian J√§ger regiments, and became standard for the newly formed Light Infantry regiments, since it represented the bugle calls used for skirmishing orders.British Army: History of the Bugle Horn While skirmishing, light infantry fought in pairs, so that one soldier could cover the other while loading. Line regiments fired in volleys, but skirmishers fired at will, taking careful aim at targets.Chappell, pp. 14‚Äì15 While consideration was given to equipping light infantry with rifles, due to their improved accuracy, expected difficulty and expense in obtaining sufficient rifled weapons resulted in the standard infantry musket being issued to most troops. The accuracy of the musket decreased at long range and, since the French chasseurs and voltigeurs also used muskets, it is likely that skirmishers' firefights took place at ranges of only 50 yards (or less). 10 yards provided the accuracy of point-blank range.Chappell, pp 15‚Äì16 Although the French infantry (and, earlier, the Americans) frequently used pellet-shot together with standard ball in their muskets, the British light infantry used only ball ammunition.Chappell, p. 14 Light infantry were equipped more lightly than regular line regiments, and marched at 140 paces per minute. Tasks of the light infantry included advance and rear guard action, flanking protection for armies and forward skirmishing. They were also called upon to form regular line formations during battles, or as part of fortification storming parties. During the Peninsular War, they were regarded as the army's elite corps.Haythornthwaite (1987), p. 7 Napoleonic wars The light infantry regiments were a significant force during the Napoleonic wars, when the Light Division was party to most of the battles and sieges of the Peninsular War. Regular light infantry formations, besides the light company attached to each regular battalion, during this period included: *43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry) *51st (2nd Yorkshire West Riding) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry) *52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry) *60th (Royal American) Regiment of Foot - 5th & 6th battalions uniformed & equipped as Rifles; 7th battalion uniformed as Rifles, but armed with muskets. *68th (Durham) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry) *71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry) *85th Regiment of Foot (Bucks Volunteers) (Light Infantry) *90th Regiment of Foot (Perthshire Volunteers) (Light Infantry) *95th Regiment of Foot (Rifles) Decline of the light infantry regiments By the late 19th century, with the universal adoption of the rifle and the abandonment of traditional formation fighting due to advancements in weaponry, the distinction between line and light infantry had effectively vanished in the British army. A number of regiments were titled as light infantry in the 1881 Cardwell Reforms, but this was effectively a ceremonial distinction only; they did not have any specialised operational roles. By 1914 the differences between light infantry and line infantry regiments were for the former restricted to details such as titles, a rapid march of 140 steps per minute, buglers instead of drummers, a parade drill which involved carrying rifles parallel to the ground (\\"at the trail\\") and dark green home service cloth helmets instead of dark blue. Light infantry badges always incorporated bugle horns as a central feature. Two \\"light divisions\\", composed of battalions from light infantry regiments, fought in the First World War - the 14th (Light) Division and the 20th (Light) Division, both of the New Army - but were employed purely as conventional divisions. By contrast, the continental armies, including the French, Italians, Austro-Hungarians, and Germans, all maintained distinct mountain or alpine units, which remained true light infantry. German mountain battalions, Gebirsj√§ger, were one of the primary sources for their innovative Sturmtruppen assault battalions, which used classic light infantry tactics to penetrate British, French, and most spectacularly, Italian infantry lines. Modern light infantry units By the Second World War, however, new tactics were beginning to be developed for the employment of a more modern form of light infantry. The growing mechanisation of the infantry meant that a distinction was created between normal battalions, which were carried in lorries and often possessed heavy weaponry, and those battalions which did not use them due to terrain or supply conditions. At the same time, the war saw the appearance of new parachute infantry, mountain infantry and special forces units, all lightly equipped and often non-motorised. In some cases, new infantry regiments were formed to take on these roles - the Parachute Regiment and the Special Air Service Regiment both serve as specialist light infantry to this day. In other cases, however, existing infantry battalions were designated for the new roles. This was done without any distinction as to their ceremonial status, and the battalions came from both light infantry and line regiments. A further development was the creation of mechanised infantry units intended to form part of armoured divisions or brigades, and equipped with tracked Universal Carriers, or later with Lend-Lease half tracks. Battalions of the Rifle Brigade and King's Royal Rifle Corps were designated for this role. (Battalions of the 4th Bombay Grenadiers performed a similar role in armoured formations of the British Indian Army). Following the end of the Second World War, the mechanisation of the army continued apace; by the 1970s, it was considered that the standard infantry battalion was one equipped with armoured personnel carriers. A number of battalions remained equipped as \\"light role\\" units; they carried less heavy weaponry than the other battalions, and were expected to travel on foot or by truck. Having no heavy vehicles, they were highly mobile, and they could be transported in aircraft or helicopters without significantly limiting their combat potential. It was planned that these units would be used as a reserve, because of their high strategic mobility, or employed for home defence or contingency operations. Because of their organisation, they were better suited for operations outside of a confrontation with the Warsaw Pact, or in more varied terrain than that found in Western Europe. Perhaps the most notable use of British light infantry was in the Falklands War, where the expeditionary force was made from three Royal Marine commando units, two battalions of the Parachute Regiment, two light role battalions of Guards infantry, and a light role battalion of 7th Gurkha Rifles. Fate of the light infantry regiments Between 2004 and 2007, a number of amalgamations took place in the British Army, following an earlier series that dated back to 1958. The aim of this most recent round was to produce a more flexible fighting force to combat the threats of today, much removed from those of the Cold War; which ended in the early 1990s. Most of the regiments in existence prior to 1958 have now been disbanded (such as the Cameronians) or have been restructured into numbered battalions of larger regiments. This process has affected all of the historic light infantry regiments (see below). The reorganised infantry branch incorporates different battalions with the specialised roles of infantry; light, Air assault (or Airborne), armoured, mechanised and commando support, within a reduced number of large regiments such as The Rifles. *British Light Infantry Regiments **Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry **Durham Light Infantry **Highland Light Infantry **King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry **King's Shropshire Light Infantry **Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry **Somerset Light Infantry **The Light Infantry **Devonshire and Dorset Light Infantry **Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Light Infantry *British Rifle Regiments **King's Royal Rifle Corps **Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) **Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) **Royal Irish Rifles/Royal Ulster Rifles **Royal Green Jackets **The Rifles (only regiment of those listed above now having a separate existence) See also * History of the British Army Notes References *Chappell, Mike; (2004) Wellington's Peninsula Regiments (2): The Light Infantry, Oxford: Osprey Publishing, * Elliot-Wright, Phillip; (2000) Rifleman, Elite Soldiers of the Wars against Napoleon, London:News Publishing, Ltd., *Glover, Michael; (1974) The Peninsular War 1807‚Äì1814: A Concise Military History, UK: David & Charles, * Haythornthwaite, Philip J.

Construction Designed as a cruising cutter for Bering Sea service, Manning was built by Atlantic Works, East Boston, Massachusetts, for the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service. She was accepted by Captain R.M Clark for the Revenue Cutter Service on 11 August 1897. She commissioned on 8 January 1898 and was assigned cruising grounds along the New England coast. Her lines were those of ancestral clipper cutters, but with a plumb bow instead of the more graceful clipper stem. She was powered by a 2,181 horsepower triple expansion steam engine and utilized a coal fired high pressure boiler which allowed a top speed of 17 knots.Evans, pp 158‚Äì159Larzelere, p 33 The hull was of composite construction with frames placed at two foot intervals with 3/8 inch steel plate and sheathed from her bottom to two feet above the waterline with five inch thick Oregon fir planks. Below the waterline Manning was sheathed in copper and had eleven watertight bulkheads. The composite design was thought at the time better to weather the ice conditions of the Bering Sea.King, p 80 As tensions mounted before the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War was declared, she carried a single bow torpedo tube.Johnson, pp 11‚Äì12 Manning and the cutters built during the same time, USRC Gresham, USRC McCulloch, USRC Algonquin, and were the last cruising cutters rigged for sail and carried the first electric generators installed on cutters. As a group, they were suitable for scouting, for rendering assistance, and for cruising at moderately long range. So successful was the design that these cutters furnished the general pattern for cutter construction for the ensuing 20 years. History =Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War= Manning served during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War with the U.S. Navy during the period 24 March 1898 to 17 August 1898, while based out of Norfolk, Virginia, as a coastal patrol vessel. This period included a four-month war deployment, from May 1898 through August 1898, on blockade and escort duty off Cuba.Larzelere, p 34 On 12 May 1898, she joined the armed yacht and the unarmored cruiser USS Dolphin first in landing, then in providing naval gunfire support for the evacuation of a force of U.S. Army soldiers at Caba√±as, Cuba. =Bering Sea Patrol= After the cessation of hostilities with Spain, Manning returned to the operational control of the Revenue Cutter Service. Her patrol duties took her along both the East Coast from Boston to Key West and included a patrol to Cuba and Puerto Rico. On 2 January 1900 Manning was ordered report to San Francisco by way of the Straits of Magellan for duties with the Bering Sea Patrol. During the years of 1900 through 1916 she patrolled the Bering Sea enforcing sealing treaties to prevent pelagic sealing and performing search and rescue duties, missing only the years 1904, 1906 and 1908.Record of Movements, p 361 On her first Bering Sea cruise in 1900, Manning conducted hydrographic surveys as well as sealing patrols. She also rescued the passengers of the stranded barkentine Leslie D, which was wrecked on Nunivak Island.Strobridge and Noble, p 124 On 6 September 1903, Manning delivered 38 passengers and eight crew members of the schooner Abbie M. Deering ‚Äì which was wrecked on Baby Island in northwestern Akutan Pass on 4 September 1903 ‚Äì safely to Unalaska.Strobridge and Noble, p 126 Later the same day, the crew was called upon by Captain Michael Healy of the USRC Thetis to assist in fighting a fire on the American ship St. Francis on the opposite side of the wharf from Thetis.Strobridge and Noble, p 127 In 1904 she performed patrol duties along the West Coast. During the 1905 Bering Sea cruise, the crew of Manning distributed boxes of clothing to natives of Attu and Atka that were provided by the Women's National Relief Association and during a second trip delivered more boxes of clothes donated by a Seattle, Washington hardware store to a warehouse at Dutch Harbor so that other cutters on the patrol could deliver them to other settlements.Strobridge and Noble, p 106 On 13 December 1905 Manning was assigned patrol duties in Hawaii where she remained until 8 May 1907 when she departed for the Bering Sea. Patrol work was cut short during the 1907 season when Manning struck an uncharted rock in Prince William Sound 15 August. Temporary repairs were made and she made for Bremerton Navy Yard for drydocking and permanent repairs in September. During 1908 Manning patrolled the Pacific Coast and assisted in several search and rescue cases.Record of Movements, p 362 Typical of a patrol season in the Bering Sea, in 1910 Manning had sailed nearly and boarded 14 Japanese sealers that had entered the three mile limit. After the 1911 North Pacific Sealing convention went into effect, the patrol area was extended to waters north of the thirtieth parallel and the seal population doubled by 1912.King, pp 52‚Äì53 In June 1912, Manning served as a temporary place of refuge for Alaskan islanders during the eruption of Novarupta. Manning had been docked in the Kodiak harbor when the eruption occurred and would be used to harbor refugees from Kodiak Island, Woody Island, and Saint Paul Island. In October 1912, Manning received orders to report to Mare Island Naval Shipyard for drydock repairs which were completed in March 1913. During a trial run with new boilers on 20 May the engines seized up and she received a tow from . After a successful trial on 24 May 1913 she sailed for Alaska.Record of Movements, pp 362‚Äì363 When the Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Lifesaving Service combined in 1915 to form the new United States Coast Guard, Manning became part of the new service and was thereafter known as USCGC Manning.\\"U.S. Coast Guard General Order No.1\\", Historic Documents & Publications, U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office =World War I= Manning received orders to report to the Coast Guard Depot at Curtis Bay, Maryland 26 January 1917 and departed soon thereafter arriving at the depot 7 March.

The six cutters were outfitted with 3-inch guns and depth charge racks and were assigned duty as convoy escorts based at Gibraltar. Manning sailed for Europe on 29 August 1917 with an increased wartime complement of eight officers, four warrant officers, and 96 enlisted sailors. The six cutters of the squadron immediately assumed wartime duties escorting convoys between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom, and conducting antisubmarine patrols in the Mediterranean Sea.Johnson, p 46 These duties continued until 28 August 1919 when the cutters were turned back to the Coast Guard by executive order.Record of Movements, p 364 =Post-War service= After World War I, the Coast Guard returned to the control of the Department of the Treasury, and in the spring of 1919 the International Ice Patrol, which had been suspended during World War I, was resumed. The annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury for 1921 noted that in the winter of 1920‚Äì21 winter patrols had been reestablished with eight vessels, one of which was Manning. On 18 September 1926 a hurricane hit south Florida and Manning was one of nine cutters sent by Commandant Frederick C. Billard to assist with maintaining order, improvising hospitals, searching for those still missing, and assisting local authorities.Johnson, p 99 Much of Mannings duty during her final years was out of Norfolk, where she decommissioned on 22 May 1930. On 6 December 1930 she was sold for $2200.02 to Charles L. Jording of Baltimore, Maryland.

According to most, such as the archives at VMI, his name was William Dickinson Washington; other sources, however, such as the Morris Museum of Art, give his name as William De Hartburn Washington. Virgil E. McMahan, in The Artists of Washington, D.C., 1796‚Äì1996, provides a name of William Dickerson Washington. (October 7, 1833 ‚Äì December 1, 1870) was an American painter and teacher of art. He is most famous for his painting The Burial of Latan√©, which became a symbol of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy in the years following the American Civil War, and for the work he did in establishing the fine arts program of the Virginia Military Institute. Biography =Early years= Long thought to have been born in Clarke County, Virginia, Washington was in reality born in Snickersville in neighboring Loudoun County, the child of John Perrin Washington and Hannah Fairfax Whiting, and was a descendant of Warner Washington, a first cousin of George Washington; his place of birth has been proven by census records of the era. The boy was born with a congenital deformity of his left foot, and walked with a limp his whole life despite attempts to repair it; he also suffered greatly from numerous childhood ailments. John Washington secured a job with the United States Post Office in Washington, D.C., and his family moved to that town in 1834. The younger Washington began his own career at the Patent Office, working there for some years as a draughtsman. He studied painting with Emmanuel Leutze during his time in Washington, working with the elder painter between 1851 and 1852. He also pursued further study in D√ºsseldorf, also with Leutze; his recommendation to travel there was supported by both of Virginia's senators, James Murray Mason and Robert Mercer Taliaferro Hunter, who urged Secretary of State Edward Everett to appoint him a dispatch bearer in Europe to provide him with funds for the journey. The Secretary agreed, and Washington began his duties at Calais upon landing there on May 16, 1853. He continued to Germany and began studies under Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow. Eastman Johnson was in his second year at the Academy in D√ºsseldorf when Washington arrived, and it has been speculated on the basis of style that the two may have worked together in some capacity, possibly going on trips along with Leutze, who traveled frequently. In any event, Washington's style is closer to Johnson's than to that of his teacher, although the exact nature of their relationship remains unclear. While in Germany Washington began his career as a history painter with pieces such as Entrance to a Castle, The Student, and Commencement of the Huguenot War; this last he sent home for exhibition, prompting a favorable notice in the Daily National Intelligencer. The painting was also shown in Philadelphia, where it met with less glowing reviews. =In Washington= Returning to the District in 1854, Washington remained there until 1861. He had some success as a painter of portraits and history paintings, and exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the National Academy of Design. While working at the Patent Office, in 1855, he drew an unauthorized copy of Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware in colored crayon on the wall of a basement room in the building. The office messenger saw it and was preparing to whitewash over it when one of Washington's superiors, William Langdon, praised it; soon the Commissioner of the Patent Office took note, and brought President Franklin Pierce and his Secretary of the Interior, Robert McClelland, to view the picture. So impressed were they that the president returned on the following day, bringing with him his wife and another lady. What became of the picture is unknown, although it was recorded as having been still in place as late as October 1856. Upon his return to the District, Washington became deeply involved in the local artistic community; he entered work in the first exhibition of the Washington Art Association, and later served as its director and vice president. He also became acquainted with William Wilson Corcoran, who would later appoint him a member of the Council of the National Gallery and School of Art. His studio was located at 486 12th St., NW, above that of Charles Bird King. At this time he began work on a series of paintings depicting the military career of Francis Marion; conflicting reports exist as to their size, quantity and location, though at least one sketch survives. Washington would remain in the District of Columbia until 1861. =American Civil War and aftermath= With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Washington traveled to Richmond, Virginia, and offered his services to Robert E. Lee; he was rejected due to the deformity of his foot, although he was briefly appointed to the Virginia State Engineers Office. There he drew a number of redoubts and fortifications, drawings from which he would later produce paintings. Washington served as a staff officer for brief stretches during the war, under the command of John B. Floyd; while on duty he completed a number of sketches of mountain and battle scenes, some of which he would later translate into finished canvases. Ill health kept him in Richmond for the duration of the war, however, and it was during this time that he created two of his most important paintings, The Burial of Latan√© and Jackson Entering the City of Winchester, Virginia.Jackson Entering the City of Winchester, Virginia at the Valentine The former, depicting an incident in the war, was based on a popular poem by John Reuben Thompson, which Washington may have heard read by its writer at an informal gathering of the Mosaic Club, where he was living at the time. The painter also worked at a studio on East Leigh Street. During his time in the Confederate capital Washington was described as \\"reticent\\" and \\"of nervous temperament\\", yet he still was part of the \\"best Richmond Society\\". At the end of the war Washington fled to England, working there between 1865 and 1866; returning to the United States, he settled in New York City, operating a studio there from 1866 until 1869 and submitting a number of works to the National Academy of Design, including The Reverend Dr. Morgan Administering the Sacrament of Baptism in Grace Church. At some point during this time he also worked in West Virginia. In July 1869, Washington was offered a teaching post at the Virginia Military Institute, where he would remain, with one interruption, until his death some eighteen months later. =Virginia Military Institute= Posthumous portrait of J.E.B. Stuart painted by Washington During his short time in Lexington, Washington managed to achieve a great deal. He was commissioned by the Institute's Superintendent, Francis H. Smith, to paint posthumous portraits of alumni and faculty who had died in battle during the Civil War. Among the subjects he so commemorated were: *George S. Patton, Sr. *Waller T. Patton *Robert E. Rodes *Stonewall Jackson *J.E.B. Stuart *Joseph W. Latimer *Samuel Garland He also contributed a portrait of the then-still- living Robert E. Lee to the gallery. The artist had not known any of these men personally, and thus had to rely on photographs and descriptions from their colleagues to complete their likenesses. Many of Washington's portraits are still on display in Preston Library on the VMI campus. Also in the Institute's collections are a number of landscapes and genre paintings he completed after poems by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Washington was also active in promoting the Institute's cultural life; he founded an art gallery on campus, for which he secured funding from William Wilson Corcoran, and taught fine arts to those students who desired such instruction. Among his pupils was Richard Norris Brooke. Smith had hoped to make Washington a full-time member of the Institute's faculty as chairman of the Division of Fine Arts, but the position was not forthcoming due to a lack of funds; the artist was not named to the post until June 1869. Full funding had still not been received a year later, and Washington left Lexington for the District of Columbia, in search of portrait commissions. Soon he traveled to Hot Springs, Virginia; his health was deteriorating, and he wished to seek a cure in the waters there. Washington returned to Lexington in October 1870 in the hopes that his position might be resolved, but he died suddenly on December 1 of that year. He was the first member of the Institute's faculty to die in office, and was greatly mourned across the campus. Washington was interred in the Stonewall Jackson Memorial Cemetery in Lexington; classes at the Institute were suspended as a mark of honor until after his burial, and a battalion of cadets escorted the coffin to the grave during the funeral. Work Most of Washington's surviving paintings are held at the Virginia Military Institute, but a few have made their way into various museum collections, including those of the Morris Museum of Art and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts; in addition, a portrait of John Marshall, which he painted for the Fauquier County Courthouse in Warrenton, Virginia, is still hanging there today. Prints of The Burial of Latan√© were also popular, and some may still be found in various collections. Jackson Entering the City of Winchester, Virginia is currently owned by the Valentine Museum in Richmond.

The two countries are close allies and fellow NATO and G7 members. History The earliest contact between Germany and Canada occurred in New France, the area of North America colonized by France in the 17th century. A number of ethnic Germans migrated to the colony during French colonial possession between 1663 and 1763, and mixed in with the French population. The first major German migration to Canada, however, was after the English conquests of Nova Scotia. A significant number of Germans served in the British invading force and subsequently elected to settle in the new lands. The colony's population was mainly French-speaking Roman Catholic Acadians. Since most British settlers preferred to settle in the warmer Southern Colonies, the British administration faced a daunting demographic problem. An aggressive plan to recruit foreign protestants began to balance the population statistics. Most of the attracted settlers came from German duchies and principalities on the Upper Rhine in the present-day Rhineland-Palatinate Bundesland. The Duchy of W√ºrttemberg was the major source of these immigrants. Because of this migration, many Nova Scotian towns on the South Shore such as Lunenburg, Kingsburg and Waterloo bear distinctly German names. Many of the names of islands, beaches and points are also German and there are many Lutheran churches. There was an even larger ethnic German migration to Canada after the American Revolution, where ethnic Germans made up a large proportion of the United Empire Loyalists who fled to Canada. These loyalists and many German mercenaries hired by Britain fought to defend British North America. Some of these mercenaries decided to settle in Canada once their terms expired, and several of the Brunswick regiment settled in Quebec, southwest of Montreal and south of Quebec City. The largest group fleeing the United States were the Mennonites who were subjected to discrimination in the United States for their pacifist beliefs. They moved to what is today southwest Ontario, settling around Berlin, Ontario (now known as Kitchener). This large group also attracted new migrants from Germany drawing some 50,000 of them to the region over subsequent decades. Beginning in 1896, western Canada drew further large numbers of German immigrants, mostly from Eastern Europe. Once again Mennonites were especially prominent, having been persecuted by the Tsarist regime in Russia. Used to the harsh conditions of farming in Russia, many of these settlers were among the most successful in adapting to the Canadian prairies.

Relations between Germany and Canada arguably hit a low point while fighting in the First World War, and then an even lower point with Canada's declaration of war against Nazi Germany in the Second World War. The declaration of war came a week after the British declaration, and was independent of the British declaration. Canadian forces played a major role in the invasion of the continent, with special responsibility in 1944-45 for the liberation of the Netherlands. Although asked by Britain to provide transport planes and air crews for the Berlin Blockade of 1948, Canada refused. However, under the enthusiastic leadership of Liberal Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent it did join NATO in 1949, despite opposition from some intellectuals, the far left, and many French Canadians.James Eayrs, In Defence of Canada: volume 4: Growing Up Allied (1980) pp 38-60 Canada established diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic on 1st August 1975.

Career Ginsbourg got into his career in the 1930s as a stringer (journalism) for Washington Post in the Shanghai. He returned to the U.S. shortly after World War II broke out in Europe, changing his name to Gayn to prevent Japanese reprisals against his brother Sam, who remained in Japanese- occupied Shanghai. Gayn also went on to write for Collier's and was arrested in the FBI raid on the offices of the Institute for Pacific Relations' Amerasia office in June 1945. At the time of his arrest, he was reporting not only for Colliers but also the Chicago Sun as well as TIME Magazine.

Ludmerer (born in Long Beach, California, 1947) is a professor of history and of biostatics at Washington University in St. Louis. Ludmerer began as an instructor of internal medicine to the chief resident at Barnes- Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine, from 1976-79. In 1979, he became both a professor of medicine in the medical school, and a professor of history in the Arts & Sciences department. He is the author of three books in print, including two influential and award-winning books on the history of medical education in the United States. Early life and education Ludmerer grew up in Long Beach, California,Ludmerer finds key lessons in medicine's past. where his father was an ophthalmologist.\\"Physician Flexes\\", Long Beach Press-Telegram, December 3, 2003. Interested in medicine from an early age, he received a bachelor's degree in history and science from Harvard University in 1968. He received a master's degree in history of medicine from The Johns Hopkins University in 1971, followed by an M.D. in 1973. His first book was a study of eugenics, published while he completed his junior rotation in pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University. Upon his graduation, Ludmerer became an instructor at Washington University. Career While he was initially concerned that his practice would preclude him from continuing research in history, he decided to continue working in that field, later explaining that \\"it occurred to me that if physicians can leave the bedside to study molecular genetics, why couldn't they leave the bedside to study the origins of the profession and the historical roots of problems facing medicine?\\" =Scholarship= Ludmerer has published four books and in excess of thirty peer reviewed scholarly articles on the history of medicine. Ludmerer's first book, Genetics and American Society: A Historical Appraisal, was published by The Johns Hopkins University Press in 1972. He observed in that work that \\"[p]erhaps no science in modern times has had so great a social impact and has been so enmeshed in diverse social issues as genetics\\",Kenneth M. Ludmerer, Genetics and American Society: A Historical Appraisal (1972), p. 1. noting that \\"[a]s soon as the science of genetics began, many individuals started speaking of its social import and potential applicability to social problems\\".Kenneth M. Ludmerer, Genetics and American Society: A Historical Appraisal (1972), p. 7. He criticized eugenics, characterizing it as a form of racism founded on a poor understanding of genetics.Kenneth M. Ludmerer, Genetics and American Society: A Historical Appraisal (1972), p. 22-30. He faulted scientists for failing to correct public misperceptions even when these were acted on politically, as through immigration restrictions directed at ethnic groups characterized as being inferior.Kenneth M. Ludmerer, Genetics and American Society: A Historical Appraisal (1972), p. 101-04. His second book, Learning to Heal: The Development of American Medical Education, was also published by The Johns Hopkins University Press, in 1996. The work focuses primarily on the extensive changes which occurred in the period from the 1820s to the 1920s. However, it does go back to earliest instances of formal medical education in the pre-Revolutionary War American colonies of the 1760s, and it briefly addresses various trends in medical education up to and including the time in which Ludmerer was writing. He describes how this period saw the transition from unregulated institutions granting degrees to untested, sometimes illiterate students after less than a year of study, to the modern conception of medical schools, heavily regulated and having extensive entrance requirements, and organized curricula requiring four years of study. Ludmerer particularly identifies the American Civil War as a transformative event, as the poor training of medical personnel in that era lead to many more deaths from disease than occurred in battle. Ludmerer criticizes the view that the Flexner Report spurred the advancement of medical education, crediting the report for spurring the closure of substandard medical schools, but noting that most of the innovations recommended by Abraham Flexner had already been initiated by the better schools by the time the report was written. Ludmerer's third book, Time to Heal: American Medical Education from the Turn of the Century to the Era of Managed Care, was published by Oxford University Press in 1999. It is essentially a sequel to Learning to Heal, using the same narrative style to address in detail the developments in medical education over the twentieth century, and particularly from the 1920s through the 1990s. Let Me Heal: The Opportunity to Preserve Excellence in American Medicine came out in 2014. It chronicles how changes in insurance payments and requirements drove changes in hospital-based medical practice, which in turn influenced residency training. Among other topics, Ludmerer addresses the controversial duty-hours regulations. =Recognition= Ludmerer has won a number of awards for his scholarly contributions. He received the Nicholas E. Davies Memorial Award from the American College of Physicians in 1997, the Distinguished Alumnus Award of Johns Hopkins University in 2000 and the Daniel Tosteson Award for Leadership and Medical Education from Harvard Medical School in 2001. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in the spring of 2002,Ludmerer wins award for study of medicine's history and, although Ludmerer himself minimized the importance of the Flexner Report, he was selected by the Association of American Medical Colleges to receive the \\"Abraham Flexner Award\\" for distinguished service to medical education in 2003. =Tobacco company testimony= In 2000, Ludmerer came under some criticism when it was learned that he received over half a million dollars over a fifteen-year period to testify as an expert witness on medical history on behalf of tobacco companies. Ludmerer testified that, in his opinion, the companies could not have known of certain harmful effects of tobacco before the 1950s, although critics contend that earlier studies did suggest those effects.Should Historians Be Working for the Tobacco Industry?, The American Prospect, 2000.

The theme for the show \\"So Much to Say\\" was written by songwriter Matthew Puckett. The series won a Peabody Award in 2009.68th Annual Peabody Awards, May 2009. Created as a real-life adjunct to the ABC medical drama Grey's Anatomy, it follows the professional lives of hospital caregivers and their patients. The show is a follow-up to the ABC documentary series Hopkins 24/7, from 2000. Boston Med, which aired on ABC in June‚ÄìAugust 2010, was produced by the same team behind Hopkins. Controversy The fourth episode of the series featured a young boy with a serious, irreversible heart condition. His heart was barely functioning at a level high enough to keep him alive, and he went into cardiac arrest during a heart biopsy. During a discussion among the boy's doctors about the course of treatment, Dr. James Fackler, a pediatric critical care specialist, was shown saying, \\"It's my opinion that we should just let the child die.\\" This comment incited controversy among viewers, who considered it insensitive. In a video on ABC's Hopkins website, Dr. Fackler elaborated on what he meant, explaining that if the boy required a heart transplant, mechanical life support (ECMO) would not keep him alive long enough for a new heart to become available. The series failed to show the importance of hospital positions other than the main physician. Nurses felt their jobs were undermined because of how doctors were portrayed as lone heroes. Nurses, social workers and clergy were some of the many people who contributed to the doctor's success.

Attracting the participation of a number of New York's most influential business leaders, such as John Jacob Astor, Peter Cooper, and J. Pierpont Morgan, its members were instrumental in the realization of several key initiatives in the region ‚Äì including the Erie Canal, the Atlantic cable, and the New York City Transit Authority. The Chamber of Commerce survives today as the Partnership for New York City, which was formed from the 2002 merger of the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the New York City Partnership. History =Founding, 1769‚Äì1774= On April 5, 1768, a group of twenty New York merchants met at Bolton and Sigel's Tavern, in the building leased from Samuel Fraunces that we now know as Fraunces Tavern, to form a mercantile union. Organized under the name the New York Chamber of Commerce, the society was designed to protect and promote the business interests of merchants in New York City. Following its relocation to the Royal ExchangeLocated on Lower Broad Street. in 1770, the Chamber petitioned Lt. Governor Colden and was granted a royal charter from King George III incorporating it as ‚Äúthe Corporation of the Chamber of Commerce in the City of New York in America.‚ÄùJoseph Bucklin Bishop, A Chronicle of One Hundred and Fifty Years: The Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York, 1768-1918. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1918; p. 12. =Revolutionary War, 1775‚Äì1783= At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, the membership was divided into loyalist and patriot factions. Patriot members, including John Cruger, the first President of the Chamber, and William Malcolm left New York City after the British invasion of 1776 while their loyalist counterparts continued to hold meetings and transact business in the City.Bishop, A Chronicle of One Hundred and Fifty Years, pp. 28‚Äì33. =Reincorporation, 1784‚Äì1806= After the British evacuation in 1783, the Chamber's returning patriot members quickly established control over the Chamber and relocated to the Merchants‚Äô Coffee House.Located on Wall and Water Streets In 1784, the Chamber was issued a new charter reincorporating it as ‚Äúthe Corporation of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York,‚ÄùBishop, A Chronicle of One Hundred and Fifty Years, p. 40. and over the next few years the Chamber put numerous bills before Congress concerning mercantile issues and the fortification of the New York Harbor. It is during this period that the first mention of the Erie Canal is found.Bishop, A Chronicle of One Hundred and Fifty Years, p. 42. Reference to the Erie Canal can be found in the New York Chamber of Commerce Collection, Meeting Minutes, 1786. In 1793, the Chamber again relocated; this time to the Tontine Association across the street from the Merchants‚Äô Coffee House. The Chamber was an advocate of the Jay Treaty in 1795 and encouraged other mercantile bodies throughout the country to support it as well.Bishop, A Chronicle of One Hundred and Fifty Years, p. 47. After the turn of the century member participation dropped steadily and by 1806 meetings were suspended due to lack of attendance.Bishop, A Chronicle of One Hundred and Fifty Years, p. 51. =Renewal, fire and growth, 1817‚Äì1860= In 1817, the President, Cornelius Ray, called for resumption of Chamber business. New officers were elected and the membership base was increased by 36 during the first meeting. Over the following years interest in the proposed Erie Canal increased and in response to concerns, the Chamber published an informational pamphlet on the Erie Canal's merits.Bishop, A Chronicle of One Hundred and Fifty Years, p. 59. From 1827 to 1835 the Chamber was housed in the Merchants Exchange Building,Located on Wall Street. one of the buildings destroyed by the Great Fire of New York, on December 16, 1835. During the fire the Chamber's portraits of Alexander Hamilton and Cadwallader Colden were covered with canvas and stored in an attic on Wall Street, where they remained until they were discovered by Prosper Wetmore, Secretary of the Chamber, in 1843.Bishop, A Chronicle of One Hundred and Fifty Years, pp. 15‚Äì16. The remaining portraits, books and the Chamber‚Äôs seal were saved from the fire.Bishop, A Chronicle of One Hundred and Fifty Years, p. 60. There is no record of the original charter‚Äôs fate and it is believed that the charter perished in the fire. The destruction of the Merchants Exchange Building forced the Chamber to relocate once more, this time to the Merchants Bank. Throughout this period the Chamber was consumed by administrative concerns and the elected officers authorized the hire of an official clerk and librarian to assist the elected Secretary in overseeing the day-to-day functions of the Chamber. The Chamber‚Äôs membership reached two hundred and five in 1849,Bishop, A Chronicle of One Hundred and Fifty Years, p. 64. and the Chamber became increasingly involved in trade and commerce concerns at the national and international levels, including completion of the first Atlantic cable. In 1858, the Chamber released its first annual report which outlined the condition of mercantile affairs and important changes in business markets connected to the general trade of the country.Bishop, A Chronicle of One Hundred and Fifty Years, pp. 68‚Äì69. By this time the Chamber had outgrown its current location and decided that the Underwriters‚Äô building Located on William and Cedar Streets. would provide more space for the growing library and membership.Bishop, A Chronicle of One Hundred and Fifty Years, p. 67. =Civil War, 1861‚Äì1865= Throughout the Civil War, the Chamber gathered funds and wrote to the President, Congress, the New York State Legislature and the New York City Council regarding the defenses of the New York Harbor. Eventually, the State Legislature allocated one million dollars to the project and after inspection the Chamber deemed these defenses acceptable.Bishop, A Chronicle of One Hundred and Fifty Years, p. 85. The Chamber also commemorated significant events and in 1861 issued medals to the defenders of Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens for their bravery during April and May of that year. Over the course of 1862 and 1863, the Chamber condemned the acts of the CSS Alabama and the CSS Florida, sloops-of-war known for capturing and burning Union merchant and naval ships. The Chamber estimated the losses suffered from the CSS Alabama at twelve million dollarsIn 1872, the Geneva Tribunal awarded the United States $15.5 million for claims against the CSS Alabama.

It was in existence from 1933 to 1945. History The Nazi Gau (plural Gaue) system was originally established in a party conference on 22 May 1926, in order to improve administration of the party structure. From 1933 onwards, after the Nazi seizure of power, the Gaue increasingly replaced the German states as administrative subdivisions in Germany. At the head of each Gau stood a Gauleiter, a position which became increasingly more powerful, especially after the outbreak of the Second World War. Local Gauleiters were in charge of propaganda and surveillance and, from September 1944 onwards, the Volkssturm and the defence of the Gau. The Gau Bayerische Ostmark was formed in 1933, when Hans Schemm, the gauleiter of Oberfranken, united the three Gaue of Oberpfalz, Niederbayern and Oberfranken into one in an internal power struggle. The term Bayerische Ostmark was coined after the First World War for the region to refer to the fact that the area now bordered the new Czechoslovakia, a country perceived as hostile to Germany. The term Mark () was historically used in Imperial Germany for border regions to hostile neighbors.Bayerische Ostmark, 1933-45 Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, accessed: 27 June 2008 It was the only one of the Bavarian Gaue to incorporate more than one Regierungsbezirk, covering three of them. Hans Schemm led the Gau until his death in a plane accident in 1935; his successor, Fritz W√§chtler, could not muster the same popularity with the population of the region. After the occupation of Czechoslovakia, parts of this country were incorporated in the Gau. The districts (German: Kreis) of Bergreichenstein, Markt Eisenstein and Prachatitz were added to the Gau.Deutsche Verwaltungsgeschichte: Landkreis Prachatitz accessed: 10 November 2008 From 1938, the Gau was also home to the Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp and its many subcamps. Because the Gau Bayerische Ostmark was not a border region any more, it was renamed Gau Bayreuth in June 1942. W√§chtler was shot on orders of Hitler, having left his capital Bayreuth in April 1945. He was replaced by Ludwig Ruckdeschel, whose reign until the surrender of Nazi Germany was very brief.Bayerische Ostmark, 1933-45 Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, accessed: 27 June 2008 Gauleiter The Gauleiter of Gau Bayreuth: * Hans Schemm - 19 January 1933 to 5 March 1935 * Fritz W√§chtler - 5 December 1935 to 19 April 1945 * Ludwig Ruckdeschel - 19 April 1945 to 8 May 1945 Ludwig Ruckdeschel was the deputy Gauleiter from 1 February 1933 to June 1941. In this position, he led the Gau in an acting position from Hans Schemm's death to the appointment of Fritz W√§chtler in 1935. After W√§chtler's execution for defeatism by an SS squad in 1945, he became Gauleiter himself.

The North German Plain largely corresponds to the dark green surfaces north of the tan-coloured low mountain ranges. Morning fog in East Frisia. The North German Plain or Northern Lowland () is one of the major geographical regions of Germany. It is the German part of the North European Plain. It is bounded by the coasts of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea to the north and Germany's Central Uplands (die Mittelgebirge) to the south. Poland and the Netherlands bound it to east and west. From the near- east to the near-west, the southern limit is specifically the Lower Saxon Hills: the ridge of the Teutoburg Forest, the Wiehen Hills, the Weser Hills, the Lower Saxon B√∂rd; and the Harz (mountains/hill range). Thin escarpments of these, short of the far west mark the point where the west of the plain becomes the much smaller Westphalian Lowland. The Westphalian Lowland mirrors in size and elevation the Cologne Bight immediately south-west. Elements of the Rhenish Massif mark the latter's southern and eastern limits: the Eifel (shared with Belgium), Bergisches Land and the Sauerland. In the east, the plain stretches out broader east-west but not as far south as the southern half of the Cologne Bight. It abuts the Central Saxon/Thuringian hill country, particularly the Kyffh√§user, west, and the foothills of the Ore Mountains, south. Landscape, soils and their formation It is known that the North German Plain was formed during the Pleistocene era as a result of the various glacial advances of terrestrial Scandinavian ice sheets as well as by periglacial geomorphologic processes. The terrain may be considered as part of the Old or Young Drift (Alt- or Jungmor√§ne), depending on whether or not it was formed by the ice sheets of the last glacial period, the Weichselian Ice Age. The surface relief varies from level to undulating. The lowest points are low moorlands and old marshland on the edge of the ridge of dry land in the west of Schleswig-Holstein (the Wilster Marsh is 3.5 metres below sea level) and in the north west of Lower Saxony (Freepsum, 2.3 metres below sea level). The highest points may be referred to as Vistula and Hall glaciation terminal moraines (depending on the ice age which formed them) ‚Äì e.g. on the Fl√§ming Heath (200 metres above sea level) and the Helpt Hills (179 metres). Following the ice ages, rain-fed, raised bogs originated in western and northern Lower Saxony during warm periods of high precipitation (such as the Atlantic warm period). These bogs were formerly widespread but much of this terrain has now been drained or otherwise superseded. The coastal areas consist of Holocene lake and river marshes and lagoons connected to Pleistocene Old and Young Drift terrain in various stages of formation and weathering. After or during the retreat of the glaciers, wind-borne sand often formed dunes, which were later fixed by vegetation. Human intervention caused the emergence of open heath such as the L√ºneburg Heath, and measures such as deforestation and the so-called Plaggenhieb (removal of the topsoil for use as fertiliser elsewhere) caused a wide impoverishment of the soil (Podsol). The most fertile soils are the young marshes (Auen-Vegen) and the B√∂rde areas (Hildesheim B√∂rde, Magdeburg B√∂rde, with their fertile, loess soils). High level bog peat can be found in the poorest soils, e.g. in the Teufelsmoor. In the loess areas of the lowland are found the oldest settlement locations in Germany (Linear Pottery culture). The north eastern part of the plain (Young Drift) is geomorphologically distinct and contains a multitude of lakes (e.g. the Mueritz lake in the Mecklenburg Lake Plateau) which are vestiges of the last ice age. The retreating glaciers left this landscape behind around 16,000 to 13,000 years ago. In comparison, the dry plains of northwestern Germany (Lower Saxony, western Schleswig-Holstein and the Bochum area of North Rhine Westphalia) are more heavily weathered and levelled (Old Drift) as the last large scale glaciations here occurred at least 130,000 years ago. The region is drained by rivers that flow northwards into the North Sea or the Baltic. The Rhine, Ems, Weser, Elbe and Havel are the most important rivers which drain the North German Lowlands into the North Sea and created woods in their flood plains and folds, e.g. the Spreewald (\\"Spree Forest\\"). Only a small area of the North German Plain falls within the catchment area of the Oder and Nei√üe rivers which drain into the Baltic. Climate and vegetation The North Sea coast and the adjacent coastal areas of the facing East and North Frisian Islands are characterised by a maritime climate. South of the coast, a broad band of maritime and sub-maritime climate stretches from the east coast of Schleswig-Holstein to the western edges of the Central Uplands. To the south east and east, the climate becomes increasingly subcontinental: characterised by temperature differences between summer and winter which progressively increase away from the tempering effect of the ocean. Locally, a drier continental climate can be found in the rain shadow of the Harz and some smaller areas of upland like the Drawehn and the Fl√§ming. Special microclimates occur in bogs and heathlands and, for example, in the Altes Land near Hamburg, which is characterised by relatively mild temperatures year round due to the proximity of the North Sea and lower Elbe river, providing excellent conditions for fruit production. Azonal vegetation complexes of moors, riparian forests, fens and water bodies originally stretched along the rivers Ems, Weser, Elbe, Havel and Spree. Distinctive salt marshes, tideflats and tidal reed beds in the estuaries existed permanently in the tidal zone of the North Sea coast. The natural vegetation of the North German Plain is thought to have been forest formed mainly by the dominant species European Beech (Fagetalia).

NATO military strategists identified the North German plain as an area which might be used as one of two major invasion routes into Western Europe by Warsaw Pact forces, led by the Soviet Third Shock Army, should war break out between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The plain's geography, which makes it suitable for the deployment of armoured and mechanized manoeuvre, led to it being identified as a major invasion route into West Germany. The defence of the Plain was the responsibility of NATO's Northern Army Group and Second Allied Tactical Air Force, made up of German, Dutch, Belgian, British and U.S. forces including 1st British Corps.

Among Carr's other compositions were \\"Lonely Ballerina\\" (1954) for the Mantovani Orchestra, and two instrumental pieces which were hits for The Shadows: \\"Man of Mystery\\" (UK #5 hit in December 1960) and \\"Kon- Tiki\\" (UK #1 hit in October 1961). His \\"Man of Mystery\\" was the theme music for the early 1960s film series \\"Edgar Wallace Mysteries\\" based on the prodigious output of the writer Edgar Wallace known as the \\"man of mystery\\". In recent years this instrumental rock tune has featured in the repertoire of the British alternative rock band Muse. With Ben Nisbet, Carr co-wrote the theme song to the popular 1960s children's TV series \\"The White Horses\\". The song was released as the single \\"White Horses\\" sung by \\"Jacky\\" (Jackie Lee) which became a UK #10 hit in April 1968. In 2003 it was named in The Penguin Television Companion as the greatest theme song in television history. Carr and Nisbet collaborated again for another song for Jacky, \\"Off and Running\\". Among many other songs, Carr also wrote/co-wrote: * \\"Ol' Faithful\\" (1934) (with Kennedy) * \\"Dinner for One, Please James\\" (1935) * \\"The General's Fast Asleep\\" (1935) (with Kennedy) * \\"Getting Around and About\\" (1935) (with Lewis Ilda) * \\"Old Timer\\" (1935) (with Lewis Ilda) * \\"Girl with the Dreamy Eyes\\" (1935) (with Eddie Pola) * \\"Orchids to My Lady\\" (1935) * \\"Misty Islands of the Highlands\\" (1935) (with Kennedy) * \\"The Wheel of the Wagon Is Broken\\" (1935) (with Elton Box & Desmond Cox) * \\"Did Your Mother Come from Ireland\\" (1936) (with Kennedy) * \\"The Sunset Trail\\" (1936) (with Kennedy) * \\"Why Did She Fall for the Leader of the Band?\\" (1936) (with Kennedy) * \\"Cowboy\\" (1937) * \\"Home Town\\" (1937) (with Kennedy) * \\"The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot\\" (1937) (with Tommie Connor & Jimmy Leach) * \\"Cinderella, Stay in My Arms\\" (1938) * \\"South of the Border\\" (1939) (with Kennedy) * \\"On the Outside Looking in\\" (1939) * \\"Somewhere in France with You\\" (1939) * \\"(We're Gonna Hang out the) Washing on the Siegfried Line\\" (1939) (with Kennedy) * \\"A Handsome Territorial\\" (1939) (with Kennedy) * \\"The First Lullaby\\" (1941) (with Popplewell) * \\"A Pair Of Silver Wings\\" (1941) (with Eric Maschwitz) * \\"I Love To Sing\\" (1943) (with Paul Misrake & Tommie Connor) * \\"When You Talk About Old Ireland\\" (1951) (with Tommie Connor) Carr also composed \\"Ole Faithful\\", which became the Hull Rugby League Football Club's supporter's anthem.

Before that, from 1929 to 1933, it was the regional subdivision of the Nazi Party in that area. History The Nazi Gau (plural Gaue) system was originally established in a party conference on 22 May 1926, in order to improve administration of the party structure. From 1933 onward, after the Nazi seizure of power, the Gaue increasingly replaced the German states as administrative subdivisions in Germany. At the head of each Gau stood a Gauleiter, a position which became increasingly more powerful, especially after the outbreak of the Second World War, with little interference from above. Local Gauleiters often held government positions as well as party ones and were in charge of, among other things, propaganda and surveillance and, from September 1944 onward, the Volkssturm and the defense of the Gau. The position of Gauleiter in Main Franconia was held by Otto Hellmuth for the duration of the existence of the Gau, with Ludwig P√∂sl (1931‚Äì37) and Wilhelm K√ºhnreich (1937‚Äì45) as his deputies.

Practical atheism does not reject or accept claims about God. Practical atheism has been mistaken with apatheism and pragmatic atheism. Apatheism sees the god question as irrelevant while practical atheism does not. Since practical atheism doesn't address the god claim one can be both a theist and a practical atheist. Forms Philosopher Zofia Zdybicka lists four forms of practical atheism. *Where one is not guided by religious principles *Where one has a lack of interest in matters related to a god or gods *Ignorance of the concept of a god *Where one excludes a god or gods from intellectual pursuits and practical action at the individual or social level History Historically, practical atheism was considered by some people to be associated with moral failure, willful ignorance, and impiety. Those considered practical atheists were said to behave as though God, ethics, and social responsibility did not exist. According to the French Catholic philosopher √âtienne Borne, \\"Practical atheism is not the denial of the existence of God, but complete godlessness of action; it is a moral evil, implying not the denial of the absolute validity of the moral law but simply rebellion against that law.\\" In response to Voltaire, French philosopher Denis Diderot wrote: \\"It is very important not to mistake hemlock for parsley; but not at all so to believe or not in God.\\" References Category:Philosophy of religion ","title":"Practical atheism"},{"id":"18157639","text":"\\"Whisper You Love Me Boy\\" is a song written and composed by Holland‚ÄìDozier‚ÄìHolland and recorded by at least three Motown female acts: early Motown star Mary Wells, popular Motown singing group The Supremes and blue-eyed soul Motown label mate Chris Clark in 1964, 1965 and 1967 respectively.

Soft sleeper is the main class on most Z-series express trains, and are grouped in several carriages as part of slower trains. They are more expensive than hard sleepers but are generally more comfortable as there is more room to move around and the bunks tend to be, albeit not always, softer in firmness. In many soft sleeper compartments, there is entertainment available through headphones connected to an LCD screen, although this is by no means universal. Soft Sleepers have usually 4 bunks, sometimes 6. The bunks come with a lower sheet, 2 pillows and a covered duvet. The compartment has a door that is lockable although the carriage attendant has a key to open it. A large thermos of hot water, slippers and a rubbish bin are provided. Tickets are priced slightly cheaper for the upper berths than the more desired lower berths. Due to the compartmental nature of the soft sleeper, it is sometimes appropriate for passengers to reserve tickets in batches of four to share a single compartment, though this may not always work, especially on certain routes during peak season.

Song information The song was originally recorded by Barrett Strong, who scored Motown's first national hit with 1959's \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\", and his version was released as the B-side to his sixth and final Motown single, \\"Misery\\", in June, 1961. The song itself has the narrator pleading to her lover not to repeat her mistakes after she was caught cheating on him. She basically warns the man that if he were ever to 'turn her away', she would tell him that 'two wrongs don't make a right' to prove a point. She begs him to take her back and promises that she'll never make the same mistake again. Charts Released when Wells was one of Motown Records' most popular recording artists, the track got the record some additional radio play on top of that of its A-side. The song eventually peaked at number 100 on the Billboard Hot 100. It featured a rougher Wells vocal prominent in her album tracks and earlier hit releases.

Accessed 2012-3-15. An eccentric figure, she was noted for her love of jewelry, her many failed business ventures, and her criminal record that extended in New Orleans as far back as 1880. Lulu White circa 1900 White's exact date of birth is unknown. She was born on a farm near Selma, Alabama, but claimed to be an immigrant from the West Indies.Rose, \\"Storyville, New Orleans\\" University of Alabama Press, pg. 40 Publicity from about 1906 claimed that she was 31 years old; however, she may have actually been somewhat older. She was of mixed race and enjoyed, for a time, an affluence rare for Creoles of color. In 1906, she ran into financial difficulties leaving her destitute, and moved to California. She commuted back and forth between California and Louisiana several times over the course of her career and kept a high profile until the demise of Storyville.

Otherwise, little information about her post-Storyville life is known.Madden, Annette; 'In Her Footsteps: 101 Remarkable Black Women from the Queen of Sheba to Queen Latifah'; Conari; pg 230 Mahogany Hall High end brothels along Basin Street in the early 1900s; Mahogany Hall is at far right. Until forcible closure in 1917, White ran a sumptuous 'Octoroon Parlour' known as Mahogany Hall, located at 235 Basin Street.. The four-story house reportedly cost $40,000 to build (about $1 million in 2008 dollars). In 1929, the structure sold for $11,000. According to publicity of the time, Mahogany Hall housed 40 women. The official brochure for the house also stated that it had five parlors (one of which was a 'Mirrored Parlor') and fifteen bedrooms, each with its own adjoining bathroom. Famous Storyville photographer E. J. Bellocq's surviving photographs of the house attest to its abundance of elegant furnishings, huge chandeliers and potted ferns. The building housed several expensive oil paintings, Tiffany stained glass windows and other works of art. Other pamphlets featured photographs and biographies of each of the 'Octoroon' girls. They also contained a supposed picture of Miss White, but it was actually another picture of Victoria Hall, one of the Octoroons. Aside from Miss Hall, other known residents of Mahogany Hall included Emma Sears (The Colored Carmencita), Clara Miller, Estelle Russell, Sadie Reed and Sadie Levy. Kid Ross, Tony Jackson, and Jelly Roll Morton were among the pianists who performed for the clients in Mahogany Hall. Mahogany Hall served as a House for the Unemployed in the mid-1940s but was demolished in 1949. The building was one of the last serving brothel structures in the area to be demolished. \\"Basin Super Market\\" in 2013; housed in what had been the ground floor of Lulu White's Saloon. In addition to Mahogany Hall, White operated an adjacent drinking establishment at 1200 Bienville Street on the corner of Basin, called \\"Lulu White's Saloon\\". The Saloon opened in 1912 and, with the onset of Prohibition, changed to a soft drink bar. Throughout the twenties, White was brought in on charges of violating the Volstead Act. In 1929, she sold the Bienville property to New Orleans businessman Leon Heymann. White's Saloon building on Bienville Street was one of the handful of Storyville buildings to survive past the 1940s, but was extensively damaged during Hurricane Betsy in 1965, losing its second story; the ground floor remains in modified condition as a 1 story building. Historical significance Lulu White and her business neighbors in Storyville were subject to one of New Orleans' first legal test cases in making a vice district ordinance, for mandatory residential segregation based on gender rather than race. The city rules required any woman who engaged in prostitution to live within specified boundaries, and in the separate but equal era of Plessy v. Ferguson, the courts upheld the city's right to maintain those boundaries.Long, Alecia P., Poverty Is the New Prostitution: Race, Poverty, and Public Housing in Post-Katrina New Orleans , Journal of American History, 94 (Dec. 2007), 795‚Äì803.

He was the first person to successfully attempt a forward somersault on a tightrope and became one of the most celebrated and highly paid circus performers of his time. He was known as \\"The Wizard of the Wire\\" or \\"The Toreador of the Wire\\". Early life He was born Cornelius Sullivan in Lismore, New South Wales, the son of an Irish man and a woman of indigenous descent whose father was an Afro-Caribbean man from St Thomas in the Danish West Indies. Colleano was the third of 10 children. His father (reportedly a freed convict) made a precarious living from sideshow \\"take-on-all-comers\\" boxing and gambling. Around 1907, when Colleano was seven years old, the family settled in Lightning Ridge, New South Wales, then a newly established opal mining field and a fertile ground for the father's talents. Here Colleano received a rudimentary education and learned circus skills from the sideshows present in the town. Career By 1910 those of the family of sufficient age had formed a small circus troupe, calling themselves the \\"Collinos\\" (apparently as an Italian-sounding name befitting the \\"sable\\" complexion of the children, in order to cover the \\"native blood\\" in their veins). They traveled through New South Wales and supplemented their income by working for the major traveling circuses of the time. By 1918 the now \\"Colleano's All-Star Circus\\" (with more of Con's siblings) was sufficiently established to travel through Queensland on their own hired train. The children became known as \\"The Royal Hawaiian Troupe\\" (again to cover for their dark complexions). In 1919 Con managed to achieve the foot-to-foot forward somersault he had been attempting for some time and which was destined to secure his subsequent career. In 1922 he was engaged by the popular Tivoli circuit, the major outlet for vaudeville in Australia, on a salary of ¬£60 a week. His siblings also appeared at The Tiv' as \\"Eight Akbar Arabs\\". Fame Having learnt dance moves from his fianc√©e, soubrette Winnie Trevail (Winifred Constance Stanley Trevail) which he translated to the wire, Con was ready to move overseas to further his career. At his first performances in South Africa he was billed as Australian, but in April 1924 he adopted the Spanish toreador persona he was to employ for the greatest part of his subsequent career. In September 1924 he appeared at the New York Hippodrome Theatre and was soon noticed and engaged by Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, the largest in the country. His act now involved well-executed bullfighting movements in the ring, Spanish dance moves on the wire, and in conclusion, the dangerous forward somersault. Thenceforth, through the 1930s until the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Con was the principal star of Ringling Bros. with a salary of US$1000 per week. At this time the Big Tent could seat up to 16,000 people. In the winter he performed on the vaudeville circuit in Europe to great acclaim, among his greatest admirers being Adolf Hitler. In 1937 he returned to Sydney, Australia for a series of performances at the Tivoli (\\"the Tiv\\"). Into the 1940s Colleano continued performing in the U.S. and appeared on television on the Texaco Star Theater in 1952. His farm in Pennsylvania became a retreat for his siblings and their offspring between performances and, so established, he adopted United States citizenship together with now wife Winnie in 1950. Personal life In 1956 Con and Winnie returned to Australia where they purchased the Albion Hotel at Forbes, New South Wales. When the venture failed, they returned to America and he resumed his career on the wire to no great acclaim, ending at Honolulu in 1960. Con and Winnie had no children; Con was the uncle of American actor Bonar Colleano and the great-uncle of American actor Jack Stehlin. Death He died at his home in Miami in 1973 survived by Winnie who later returned to Australia. Winifred died in 1986 in Sydney. Ethnicity Colleano's father was white; his mother the daughter of a West Indian father and part-aboriginal mother. From Federation Australia aspired to a white society, legislated by the White Australian Policy (1901) concerning immigration, and the Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902 (under which Indigenous people from Australia, Asia, Africa and the Pacific Islands, with the exception of MƒÅori were denied voting rights). School attendance was compulsory and enforced, but \\"voluntary\\" for aboriginals. While unskilled labour was almost the sole employment option for those of mixed race, the circus provided an opportunity. In South Africa, Colleano first used his Spanish toreador act (to identify as an Australian or being of African descent would likely have proven unhelpful at the box office). Thenceforth, he retained his assumed racial identity being generally perceived as Spanish. Despite the tenor of Skipping on Stars and other recent reportage no evidence suggests that, within the non-discriminatory milieu of the circus, he denied, or was greatly concerned by his heritage. Honours In 1997 he, (together with May Wirth), was honoured by Australia Post on a postage stamp depicting a contemporary poster entitled The Wizard of the Wire. Legacy Con Colleano was inducted into the International Circus Hall of Fame in 1966 and Winifred Colleano in 1975. Colleano's name had been included in the Circus Hall of Fame, Sarasota, Florida, in 1966.Mark Valentine St Leon biography article, \\"Colleano, Con (Cornelius) (1899‚Äì1973)\\", This article was published in Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 13, (MUP), 1993 He was also celebrated in The Flying Fruit Fly Circus show Skipping on Stars, which was a tribute to his life to sold out crowds. Jack Wilson and Joe Keppel met in Colleano's Circus after the First World War; they later formed the act Wilson, Keppel and Betty.

Aims and results of quality control.\\", International Angiology, 2003 Sep;22(3):263-72. On the basis of this study and the work on plaque characterisation it has become possible to identify a high risk group of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (5.5% stroke rate per year), but most important has been the identification of a low risk group with an annual stroke risk of less than 1%, that can be spared from unnecessary intervention. His more recent research is focused on the identification of bio-markers, both biochemical and genetic, that are associated with unstable atherosclerotic plaques. The multidisciplinary approach combining angiography, high-resolution ultrasound, thrombolytic therapy, plaque pathology, histochemistry, coagulation studies, and more recently molecular biology has led to the realisation that carotid plaque rupture is a key mechanism underlying the development of cerebrovascular events.Nicolaides, A et al.: \\"Ultrasonic Characterization of Carotid Plaques\\", Nonivasive Vascular Diagnosis, Section III, 2007; Section III, Pages 127‚Äì148. = Other academic work and positions held = Nicolaides is past-president of the International Union of Angiology.International Union of Angiology and past-president of the Section of Measurement in Medicine of the Royal Society of Medicine.

New York: Hip-O Select/Motown/Universal Records. It was also recorded by The Marvelettes. Featuring Diana Ross, going by her given name, Diane Ross, in lead, the song was a doo-wop ballad similar to what the Supremes had been recording since forming as \\"The Primettes\\" two years earlier. The song's lyrics tell about a lonely woman who wants a new lover who won't mistreat her and always be loyal to her. :I want a guy to love me :One who will love me completely :Not like the last :Who's in the past :Who broke my heart and made me cry When issued, the song failed to chart forcing Berry Gordy to find other options for the teenage quartet - its full lineup included Barbara Martin alongside Ross, Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson. Three members of the group (Ross, Wilson and Ballard), in fact, had already recorded a single, \\"Tears of Sorrow\\"/\\"Pretty Baby\\", in their previous quartet, \\"The Primettes\\". In between the two singles the teenaged girls would replace Betty McGlown with Martin, and the new quartet would be recording under a new name (and under a new record deal).

It stars Margaret Sullavan (in her film debut) and John Boles. According to the on-screen credit, the film's story line was \\"suggested\\" by the 1931 nonfiction bestseller Only Yesterday by Frederick Lewis Allen, who had sold Universal the rights to his book. The film is set in a time frame close to that of Allen's book but otherwise bears no resemblance to it, and the film's title may simply have been an attempt to capitalize on the book's fame at the time of the film's release. The plot of the film appears to be based closely on Letter from an Unknown Woman (Briefe einer Unbekannten) by Stefan Zweig, published first in 1922 and in English translation a decade later. According to the New York Times, some moviegoers contacted Zweig's publisher, Viking Press, noting similarities between the film and his book. The Times reported that \\"These similarities were bought and paid for by Universal Pictures\\", which moved the story to the United States, \\"altered the story greatly, and made no mention of Zweig's name in the film\\". The studio also paid \\"a large sum\\" for the right to use the title of Allen's book. Cast *Margaret Sullavan as Mary Lane *John Boles as James Stanton Emerson *Edna May Oliver as Leona *Billie Burke as Julia Warren *Benita Hume as Phyllis Emerson *Reginald Denny as Bob *George Meeker as Dave Reynolds *Jimmy Butler as Jim Jr., Mary's son *Noel Francis as Letitia *Bramwell Fletcher as Scott Hughes *June Clyde as Deborah Billie Dove and Gloria Stuart were considered for the lead before Margaret Sullavan was cast. Plot Unlike in the Zweig story, in the end Emerson acknowledges his son. Reception The film was Universal's only outstanding success released that year according to a poll of movie theater managers.

Early life and background Born in a Hindu family with musical background in Kolkata, he was the grandson of Dwarkanath Ghosh (1847‚Äì1928), who founded Dwarkin in 1875 and invented the \\"Dwarkin harmonium\\", popular in West Bengal, India. He graduated from the Scottish Church College of the University of CalcuttaSome Alumni of Scottish Church College in 175th Year Commemoration Volume. Scottish Church College, April 2008, page 589 He was keen in sports (he played soccer, hockey, polo and billiards). He also practised painting, but had to discontinue these due to an eye injury in a soccer match. Then he turned to music. He was trained in vocals by Girija Shankar, Mohammed Sagir Khan and Mohammed Dabir Khan. He took tabla lessons from Ustad Masit Khan of the Farukhabad gharana and became his senior disciple and later from Ustad Feroze Khan of the Punjab gharana. Career He worked for 15 years in All India Radio as a producer of music. He wrote pieces in classical music, light music, modern, orchestral, choral, and percussion styles. He was the founder of Sourav Academy of Music and closely associated with the 'Sangeet Research Academy'. He scored music for many Bengali films, of which Jadubhatta, Andhare Alo and Rajlakshmi o Srikanta (1958) are worth mentioning. He has composed and directed music to a number of popular gramophone records sung by various artistes.Saregama : Music A percussion entitled The Drums of India and a jugalbandi with Pandit V.G. Jog on the harmonium and violin respectively have earned him wide popularity. One of his compositions was called Chaturang ‚Äì involving tabla, pakhawaj, kathak and tarana. He would instruct disciples staying with him to practice late into the evenings and it is said that he would correct any errors that reached his ears. He also provided music for the Academy Award nominated animated short Bead Game, directed by Ishu Patel for the National Film Board of Canada. His residence at 25 Dixon Lane in Bowbazar, Kolkata, was frequented by musicians, be it local or those visiting the city, and thus was the venue of several recitals, most notably a Raga Chhayanat performed by Bade Ghulam Ali Khan in 1954. Amongst his notable students are tabla players Kanai Dutta, Shyamal Bose, Shankar Ghosh, Abhijit Banerjee, Anindo Chatterjee, and Nikhil Ghosh, Rajkumar Misra, singers Prasun Banerjee, Ajoy Chakrabarty, Suman Ghosh and Arun Bhaduri, and instrumentalist Paul Grant.

The first commercial version was produced in 1976 by Sinclair Optics. Since then, OSLO has been rewritten several times as computer technology has advanced. In 1993, Sinclair Optics acquired the GENII program for optical design, and many of the features of GENII are now included in OSLO. Lambda Research Corporation (Littleton MA) purchased the program from Sinclair Optics in 2001. The OSLO software is used by scientists and engineers to design lenses, reflectors, optical instruments, laser collimators, and illumination systems. It is also used for simulation and analysis of optical systems using both geometrical and physical optics. In addition to optical design and analysis, OSLO provides a complete technical software development system including interactive graphics, math, and database libraries. Applications OSLO provides an integrated software environment that helps complete contemporary optical design. More than a lens design software, OSLO provides advanced tools for designing medical instrumentation, illuminations systems and telecommunications equipment, to name just a few typical applications. OSLO has been used in a multitude of optical designs including holographic systems,Rongsheng Tian; Charles S. Ih; K. Q.

OSLO has the capability of modeling a wide range of reflective, refractive and diffractive components. In addition, OSLO is used to simulate and analyze the performance of optical systems. OSLO's CCL (Compiled Command Language), which is a subset of the C programming language, can be used to develop specialized optical and lens design software tools for modeling, testing, and tolerancing optical systems. OSLO has many unique features, for instance slider wheels. This feature allows users to affix up to 32 graphical sliders providing callbacks to default or user-supplied routines that perform evaluation or even full optimization iterations when a slider is moved. Some examples in the use of these slider wheels to design telescopes are provided by Howard.Dr. Joseph Howard, ‚ÄúOptical Design of Telescopes and other Reflective Systems using SLIDERS‚Äù https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20080043876_2008044082.pdf Compatibility OSLO works with other software products using a DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) Client/Server interface.

This area has many well-preserved late 19th-century buildings, owing to a building boom and crash in the 1880s. The result is one of the finest examples of a late 19th-century port town on the west coast. The historic district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1977. and Description and history County courthouse Port Townsend is located at the northeastern tip of Washington's Olympic Peninsula, and developed beginning about 1850 as a strategically placed well-sheltered deep-harbor port at the junction of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Admiralty Inlet, which provide access to Puget Sound. It grew as a major customs point, and as a shipment point for lumber taken from the peninsula's forests. The downtown area saw a major building boom beginning the late 1880s, when local businessmen developed prospects for a rail link connecting the city to Portland, Oregon. The town grew from under 1,000 residents to about 4,500 between 1880 and 1890, and is estimated to have peaked at between 7,000 and 8,000 at the height of the development boom. It is estimated that enough housing was built to support a population of 20,000, an optimistic target that the city has never reached. The building boom came to an abrupt end when the railroad endeavour was bankrupted in 1890. Although the local economy has been periodically stimulated (e.g., by the construction of Fort Worden in the early 20th century), the population quickly dwindled to about 2,000, and grew slowly over the 20th century. Because of the speed at which the economy of Port Townsend fell and the non-existence of any industry or economy to replace it, very few of the Victorian buildings were torn down or heavily renovated. They were, in essence, preserved as time capsules for the next 100 years until the value of keeping them intact was appreciated and fostered. The historic district encompasses a roughly rectangular area about in size on the southeast side of the downtown area. It is roughly bounded on the northwest by Blaine Street, and on the southwest by Scott and Walker Streets. This area includes about 700 residences and 60 commercial and civic buildings, including the city hall (1891) and the Jefferson County Courthouse, a fine Queen Anne/Romanesque structure built in 1892. The houses that populate much of the district are typically two-story frame structures, built in the Queen Anne style or one of its variants such as the Stick or Eastlake style. Commercial buildings are two to four stories in height, and are generally built out of brick with stone trim. In addition to the courthouse, there are several good commercial examples of the Richardsonian Romanesque style that became popular around that time. Three of the city's buildings are separately listed on the National Register: the Capt. Enoch S. Fowler House, the Rothschild House, and St. Paul's Episcopal Church.

Rothschild =Early business ventures= David Charles Henry Rothschild (1824-1885) was one of seven siblings from Sulzbach am Main, Bavaria. He came to the United States in the mid 1840s. His brother, William, nearly 15 years older, had preceded him to America and settled in Harrodsburg, Kentucky where he had an establishment called \\"The Kentucky Store\\". He joined his brother in this venture but, in 1848, he returned to Sulzbach for three months, then returned to America by way of Cape Horn, to San Francisco. There, he served as secretary of the Phoenix Quartz Mining Company and worked for both the Tehama Quartz Mining Company and the North California Mining Company. Later, he and a partner opened a store in Nevada City but sold out the following year, going first to New York and then back to Bavaria. A year later, he was back in Nevada City, and opened another store. =Travels= After operating his latest store for a year, he decided to travel to \\"exotic\\" places for the next three years, visiting China, the East Indies, Australia, Tahiti, and the Society Islands. He returned to San Francisco to be a miner for six months, then opened a tobacco and cigar store in Sacramento. It was there that he married. He chose to raise his family in Port Townsend, where he settled with his wife Dorette (also from Bavaria). Over time, he came to be known as \\"The Baron\\"; a reference to the famous Rothschild banking family.Karen Brown's World of Travel =Rothschild & Co.= In 1858, shortly after settling in Port Townsend, he established a new \\"Kentucky Store\\" which, in addition to being a regular mercantile store, provisioned ships and did some salvage operations. By 1881, shipping had become his primary focus and the business became \\"Rothschild & Company\\". His son Henry later took over the business and, in conjunction with his partner William J. Jones, expanded into stevedoring.

The idea was to create something small and inexpensive, yet professionally done, in a way that would circumvent the issues that were being protested during the strike. Reception has been overwhelmingly positive. On October 31, 2008, Time magazine named it #15 in Time's Top 50 Inventions of 2008. It also won the People's Choice Award for \\"Favorite Online Sensation\\", and the 2009 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. In the inaugural 2009 Streamy Awards for web television, Dr. Horrible won seven awards: Audience Choice Award for Best Web Series, Best Directing for a Comedy Web Series, Best Writing for a Comedy Web Series, Best Male Actor in a Comedy Web Series (Harris), Best Editing, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Music. It also won a 2009 Creative Arts Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class ‚Äì Short-format Live-Action Entertainment Programs. Plot Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog consists of three acts of approximately 14 minutes each. They were first released online in July 2008 as individual episodes, with two-day intervals between each release. =Act I= Dr. Horrible is filming an entry for his video blog, giving updates on his schemes and responding to various emails from his viewers. Asked about the \\"her\\" that he often mentions, he launches into a song about Penny, the girl he likes from the laundromat (\\"My Freeze Ray\\"). The song is cut short when his \\"evil moisture buddy\\" Moist brings up a letter from Bad Horse, the leader of the Evil League of Evil. The letter informs Dr. Horrible that his application for entry into the League will be evaluated, and that they will be watching for his next heinous crime (\\"Bad Horse Chorus\\"). The following day, Horrible prepares to steal a case of wonderflonium for his time-stopping Freeze Ray by commandeering the courier van using a remote control device. Penny happens to be on the same street (\\"Caring Hands\\"), and appears asking him to sign a petition to turn a condemned city building into a homeless shelter. However, the remote requires his attention, and he appears uninterested in her and her cause. As Penny leaves, Horrible is conflicted, but opts to steal the wonderflonium, telling himself that 'A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do' (\\"A Man's Gotta Do\\"). As Horrible remotely drives the van away, Captain Hammer appears and takes over Horrible's song, smashing the remote control receiver and inadvertently causing the van to veer towards Penny. Hammer pushes her out of the way (into a pile of garbage) just as Horrible regains control of the van and stops it, making it appear that Captain Hammer stopped the van with his bare hands. The two confront each other, with Hammer repeatedly slamming Horrible's head on the van's hood, but Penny emerges to thank Hammer, making him forget about beating up Dr. Horrible. As Hammer and Penny serenade each other, Horrible jealously glares at them while he makes off with the wonderflonium. =Act II= Dr. Horrible stalks Penny and Captain Hammer on their dates; Horrible sings of the misery of the human condition, and Penny sings of hope and the possibility of redemption (\\"My Eyes\\"). Penny and Horrible, known to her as Billy, begin to talk openly as friends. On his blog, Horrible reveals that his Freeze Ray has been completed, and that he plans to use it the next day. The following post reveals that he has failed, as Hammer and the LAPD watch his blog, and they were ready for him with Hammer giving him a black eye. He then receives a phone call from Bad Horse and is reprimanded, saying that the only way to be inducted now is to commit an assassination (\\"Bad Horse Chorus (Reprise)\\"). Horrible is conflicted and can't decide on a victim, or even if he wants to commit a murder at all, even though the League will deny his application if he doesn't. Billy chats with Penny over frozen yogurt, at the laundromat, about his problems (\\"Penny's Song\\"). As they grow closer, Penny mentions that Captain Hammer is planning to drop by. Billy panics and tries to leave, only to run into Hammer as he walks in. They feign ignorance on recognizing each other, but when Penny leaves them alone, Hammer reveals that he recognizes Billy as Dr. Horrible. Captain Hammer then taunts Dr. Horrible about his crush on Penny, happy to be taking the thing that Dr. Horrible wants most. It becomes obvious that Hammer doesn't really care about Penny but just wants to sleep with her to spite Horrible. Horrible decides to kill Hammer as his heinous crime for admission to Bad Horse's Evil League of Evil (\\"Brand New Day\\"). =Act III= The city is abuzz with Captain Hammer's crusade to help the homeless and he is considered the city's new hero; Penny ponders her relationship with Captain Hammer, waiting at the laundromat to share frozen yogurt with an absent Billy; and Dr. Horrible goes into seclusion while obsessively constructing a Death Ray to kill Captain Hammer once and for all (\\"So They Say\\"). At the opening for the new homeless shelter, where a statue of Captain Hammer will be unveiled, Captain Hammer begins a speech of encouragement to the homeless, but it degenerates into self-centered, condescending praise of his own excellence and relationship with Penny (\\"Everyone's a Hero\\"). Penny, embarrassed and disillusioned, quietly tries to leave as the crowd joins in singing Hammer's song, but they are interrupted by the appearance of Dr. Horrible, who uses the Freeze Ray on Captain Hammer, cutting his song short. Dr. Horrible taunts the shocked crowd and declares that they cannot recognize that Hammer's disguise is \\"slipping\\", and he reveals a second, more lethal laser gun: his completed Death Ray (\\"Slipping\\"). At last, Horrible aims the lethal weapon at the frozen form of Captain Hammer, but hesitates. At that moment the Freeze Ray unexpectedly fails, and a suddenly revived Hammer punches Horrible across the room. The Death Ray falls from his hands, damaging it. Hammer then picks up the Death Ray, turns it on Horrible, and triumphantly completes the final note of his prior song. However, ignoring Dr. Horrible's warnings, Hammer pulls the trigger and the damaged Death Ray misfires. The weapon explodes in Hammer's hands, injuring him and causing him pain, apparently for the first time in his life. He flees, a wailing wreck, asking for \\"someone maternal\\". Dr. Horrible realizes suddenly that he has succeeded in vanquishing his nemesis, but still having not committed the murder required by the League. Unfortunately, he discovers Penny slumped against a wall, impaled by shrapnel from the exploding weapon. Tragically, she dies in Horrible's arms, deliriously reassuring him that Captain Hammer will save them. Dr. Horrible declares a Pyrrhic victory, with \\"the world [he] wanted, at [his] feet\\", seeing that her death is ironically the murder he required. In the aftermath, Horrible gains infamy and is free to commit additional crimes unfettered by Captain Hammer, who is seen on a psychiatric couch sobbing to his therapist. Horrible becomes a member of the League, striding into a party in celebration of his induction, attended by Moist and the villains Pink Pummeller and Purple Pimp. Dr. Horrible, donning a new outfitred coat, black gloves and his goggles covering his eyestakes his seat at the League, composed of fellow super-villains Tie-Die, Snake Bite, Professor Normal, Dead Bowie, Fake Thomas Jefferson, Fury Leika, and Bad Horse (who proves to be an actual horse). He addresses the camera, saying, \\"now the nightmare's real\\", and in working \\"to make the whole world kneel\\", that \\"[He] won't feel...\\". He completes the line \\"...a thing\\" in a final blog post as Billy, out of costume, staring into the camera. (\\"Everything You Ever\\"). Soundtrack The musical contains 14 songs, including credits and reprises, but at the time of broadcast the song titles were not identified. The soundtrack was released through the iTunes Store on September 1, 2008 and was released on CD in the US on December 15, 2008. Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog Soundtrack made the top 40 Album list on release, despite being a digital exclusive only available on iTunes. =Musical numbers= ;Act I *\\"Dr. Horrible Theme\\" ‚Äì Instrumental *\\"My Freeze Ray\\" ‚Äì Dr. Horrible *\\"Bad Horse Chorus\\" ‚Äì Bad Horse Chorus *\\"Caring Hands\\" ‚Äì Penny *\\"A Man's Gotta Do\\" ‚Äì Dr. Horrible, Penny & Captain Hammer ;Act II *\\"Dr. Horrible Theme\\" ‚Äì Instrumental *\\"My Eyes\\" ‚Äì Dr. Horrible & Penny *\\"Bad Horse Chorus (Reprise)\\" ‚Äì Bad Horse Chorus *\\"Penny's Song\\" ‚Äì Penny *\\"Brand New Day\\" ‚Äì Dr. Horrible ;Act III *\\"Dr. Horrible Theme\\" ‚Äì Instrumental *\\"So They Say\\" ‚Äì Movers, Captain Hammer Groupies, Penny, Captain Hammer, News Anchors & Dr. Horrible *\\"Everyone's a Hero\\" ‚Äì Captain Hammer & Groupies *\\"Slipping\\" ‚Äì Dr. Horrible *\\"Everything You Ever/Finale\\" ‚Äì Dr. Horrible & Groupies *\\"End Credits\\" ‚Äì Instrumental Cast From left to right: Maurissa Tancharoen, Joss Whedon, Nathan Fillion, Jed Whedon, Felicia Day, Neil Patrick Harris * Neil Patrick Harris as Billy/Dr. Horrible: An aspiring supervillain of the mad scientist variety with the catchphrase \\"I've got a Ph.D. in Horribleness\\". He desires to become a member of Bad Horse's Evil League of Evil and use his inventions to take over the world and enact social change for the betterment of humanity. His socio- political beliefs include the paradoxical idea of autocratic anarchy: \\"The world is a mess, and I just... need to rule it\\". As Billy, he struggles to make a romantic connection with Penny. * Nathan Fillion as Captain Hammer: Dr. Horrible's archenemy, a superhero who possesses super-human strength and near- invulnerability. Hammer is self-centered and enjoys harassing Dr. Horrible even when the situation does not warrant it. * Felicia Day as Penny: Dr. Horrible's love interest. She is idealistic, generous, and volunteers at a homeless shelter. * Simon Helberg as Moist: Dr. Horrible's friend and sidekick, who has the underwhelming ability to dampen things. Dr. Horrible calls him \\"my evil moisture buddy\\". Several colleagues of Joss Whedon have cameo roles in the series. Marti Noxon, an executive producer on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, portrays a newsreader alongside Buffy and Angel writer David Fury. Buffy and Angel writers Doug Petrie and Drew Goddard cameo as supervillains Professor Normal and Fake Thomas Jefferson, respectively. Jed, Joss, and Zack Whedon all provide the singing voices of Bad Horse Chorus. Zack also plays the man who rolls the gurney with Penny on it out of frame, and Jed Whedon also appears as the supervillain Dead Bowie, while Maurissa Tancharoen plays a superhero/supervillain groupie as well as the background voice on \\"Everything You Ever\\". Production Joss Whedon funded the project himself (at just over $200,000) and enjoyed the independence of acting as his own studio. \\"Freedom is glorious,\\" he comments. \\"And the fact is, I've had very good relationships with studios, and I've worked with a lot of smart executives. But there is a difference when you can just go ahead and do something.\\" As a web show, there were fewer constraints imposed on the project, and Whedon had the \\"freedom to just let the dictates of the story say how long it's gonna be. We didn't have to cram everything in‚Äîthere is a lot in there‚Äîbut we put in the amount of story that we wanted to and let the time work around that. We aimed for thirty minutes, we came out at forty two, and that's not a problem.\\" Some of the music was influenced by Stephen Sondheim. The production of the DVD included a contest, announced at Comic-Con, in which fans submitted a three-minute video explaining why they should be inducted into the Evil League of Evil. Ten winning submissions have been added to the DVD release. =Recording locations= The songs were recorded in a small studio set up in Joss Whedon's loft. Dr. Horrible was shot in Los Angeles, with five locations on one soundstage, and one day of filming at the Universal Studios backlot street set, including the scenes of the van heist, and the giant Dr. Horrible crushing people beneath his feet. Dr. Horrible's home, used for blogging scenes as well as the final party scene, is the house featured in the \\"Mad Scientist House\\" episode of Monster House. Distribution Whedon has said that the plan was to find a venue for the series that would enable it to earn its money back and pay the crew. This plan was to release the show onto the Internet, with an iTunes release to follow. If the Internet and iTunes releases were successful enough, Whedon planned to greenlight an official DVD, which would include some \\"amazing extras\\". The musical's fansite launched in March 2008 (despite the official site containing nothing more than a poster at the time) and was the first place to publicly release the teaser trailer three months later on June 25, 2008. =Online= The episodes first aired at the Official Dr. Horrible website, hosted on Hulu, accessible internationally (unusual for the US-based service whose videos are typically not accessible to Internet users who reside outside the US) and free to watch (ad-supported). Act I premiered on Tuesday, July 15, 2008Act II followed two days later on July 17, and Act III surfaced on July 19. The episodes were taken offline on July 20 as planned, but became available again on July 28. The show was later (date unknown) restricted to the United States only. On October 10, 2009, all three acts were made available via iTunes for the UK and Australia. The film is also available from Amazon Video on Demand. On November 29, 2009 all three acts, both separate and together, were taken off Hulu. On February 22, 2010, the full feature became available to stream on Netflix, with all three episodes appearing sequentially. On March 20, 2014, it was removed from Netflix. =DVD and Blu-ray= On November 28, 2008, the Official Dr. Horrible website announced that pre-orders were being taken for the DVD. The following day Tubefilter reported that pre-orders of the Dr. Horrible DVD were \\"booming\\". The DVD was released exclusively at Amazon.com on December 19, 2008, in the United States and on January 13, 2009, in Canada at Amazon.ca. The DVD is region free. During pre-ordering the Amazon page stated the discs would be manufactured on demand using recordable media. Although some customers report receiving DVD-R discs (identified by a purple data-side), most are receiving pressed discs. On June 2, 2009, a new release of Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog was produced by New Video Group, which included the same materials as the Amazon DVD but was distributed through regular retail outlets. A Blu-ray version was released on May 25, 2010, from New Video Group. Special features on the DVD and Blu-ray include Commentary! The Musical; commentary by the cast and creators; behind-the-scenes featurettes on the making of the movie and the music; the top 10 Evil League of Evil application videos from fans; and four easter eggs. =Commentary! The Musical= The DVD and Blu-ray versions of Dr. Horrible include as an extra Commentary! The Musical, a commentary track comprising entirely new songs performed by the cast and crew, thus creating another whole musical on its own. The actors and writers sing various songs both as solos and with the entire company, playing versions of themselves. Commentary! is partly self-referential, and one of the co-creators, Zack Whedon, self-referentially comments that one song \\"wasn't even about the movie, it was about itself\\", which he claims is \\"like breaking the ninth wall\\". As of January 8, 2010, Commentary! The Musical has been for sale on the iTunes Music Store.

In November 2008, Joss Whedon blogged about Dr. Horrible's Sing- Along Blog and stated that due to its success they had been able to pay the crew and the bills. Later, in 2012, Joss Whedon said during an interview with Forbes that \\"with the movie and the soundtrack and everything we‚Äôve been able to do with it, we made over $3 million with it\\". =Television broadcast= The three-part series made its television broadcast debut on October 9, 2012, airing at 9:00 pm on The CW. It was edited to fit the 42 minutes needed for a one-hour time slot. Comic books Tie-in comic books for Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog have been released by Dark Horse Comics. The first three were through its online comics anthology Dark Horse Presents, the fourth was a special release as part of the \\"One Shot Wonders\\" series.

Dr. Horrible co-writer Maurissa Tancharoen responded, \\"All we have to say on the subject is we've never heard of Dr. Steel before... There's room for everyone in this party.\\" Unproduced sequel Since the series' release in 2008, there have been rumors of a sequel, however it remains one of Joss Whedon's unrealized projects. In 2009, Joss Whedon announced at San Diego Comic-Con that a sequel was in the works and that it might be presented as either another web series or as a feature film. Nathan Fillion also said that he knew the title of the sequel, but was unwilling to reveal it at the time. In an April 2011 interview in The New York Times, Whedon said \\"We've got several songs near completion and we've got a very specific structure,\\" and that the cast of Dr. Horrible have sung the songs at casual gatherings. While promoting Marvel Studios' The Avengers in March 2012, Whedon said he and the writers involved in Dr. Horrible would be working on writing the script during the 2012 summer. At the San Diego Comic- Con in July, Whedon announced that he planned to shoot Dr. Horrible 2 by spring 2013. However, due to his commitment on Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Avengers: Age of Ultron, Whedon told E! News in an April 2013 interview that production on the sequel would be delayed. In April 2015, Whedon stated in an update that \\"I was starting to feel like, I don't know if that‚Äôs [possible]. Everybody‚Äôs so busy, and we‚Äôve all changed. I saw Neil do Hedwig [on Broadway], and went backstage, and the first thing he said was, 'When are we doing a sequel?!' I'm like, OK! Maybe that's still on! So it'll be interesting to see when we come up for air on it. Not sure. But god knows, we have the people. We have the technology. We can rebuild it.\\" In March 2019, Harris, while promoting the Netflix series A Series of Unfortunate Events, expressed his doubts on if a sequel to Dr. Horrible would ever happen stating \\"I have no information. I haven‚Äôt seen Joss in ages and everyone‚Äôs wonderfully busy with other things. So, unless the writers want to strike again, which is when we did the first one, I‚Äôm not sure when it would ever happen.\\" Harris goes on to address his current age with \\"I‚Äôm no spring chicken. So, at a certain point, Dr. Horrible isn‚Äôt Billy the Internet geeky kid anymore. I‚Äôm a grown man. So they‚Äôll probably have to cast Nick Jonas in it.‚Äù References External links  Category:2008 comedy films Category:2000s musical films Category:2008 web series debuts Category:2008 web series endings Category:American superhero films Category:American films Category:Supervillain films Category:American comedy web series Category:Films directed by Joss Whedon Category:Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form-winning works Category:Hugo Award-winning television series Category:Science fiction musicals Category:Films with screenplays by Joss Whedon Category:Superhero comedy films Category:Supervillain television shows ","title":"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog"},{"id":"18158430","text":"Gardenzitty was a well-known Czech soundsystem from Prague playing drum and bass.

Summary In this fantasy, the first of a new trilogy, the world's magic comes at a terrible cost: a witch's own finite life force, which drains away with each spell. The sole exceptions are the immortal Magisters, who secretly tap a more murderous fuel for their power.

Meanwhile, Prince Andovan, third son of the avaricious King Danton, is expiring from the baffling Wasting disease, which can only be caused by a Magister. When the enraged king banishes his right-hand Magister, the mysterious and sinister Kostas takes his place, much to the dismay of Andovan's mother, Queen Gwynofar.

It was founded in 1902 as the Northern Aluminum Company, renamed Aluminum Company of Canada in 1925, and Alcan Aluminum in 1966. It took the name Alcan Incorporated in 2001. During that time, it grew to become one of the world's largest aluminum manufacturers. Alcan was purchased by Australian-British multinational Rio Tinto for $38 billion in 2007, becoming Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. in 2008. It was headquartered in Montreal, in its Maison Alcan complex.  History  The Northern Aluminium Company Limited was founded in 1902, in Shawinigan, Quebec, as part of the Pittsburgh Reduction Company. In 1913, the company opened a kitchen utensil production plant and foundry in Toronto. It opened a rolling mill in the plant a few years later. During World War I (1914‚Äì18), aluminium production shot to 131,000 tonnes from 69,000. In 1925, the company was renamed the Aluminium Company of Canada. The Aluminium Company of Canada was responsible for rapid development in Arvida, today a part of the city of Saguenay in Quebec, by contributing to the construction of major ports and railway facilities. It began production at its sheet rolling and extrusion facility in Ontario in 1940. In 1931, the Northern Aluminium Co. Ltd. or Alcan Industries Ltd. pig and rolled Aluminium factory was opened on land acquired in 1929 in the then hamlet of Hardwick, West Oxfordshire, England. The factory helped build parts for Spitfire fighter aircraft during World War II.[http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/yourtown/banbury/4533488.End_of.../ End of the line for Banbury's Alcan factory Oxford Mail August 6, 2009 The Alcan Laboratories Club was founded in 1948 by the lab technicians to promote the well-being of the workforce in general. As a result, the village began to grow. By the early 1950s, the local economy had become dependent on the plant's prosperity, with 24% of the town's workers being employed there. At this time 13% were employed in distribution, 7% in clothing and 5% in agriculture. With the onset of World War II, the Allies' demand for aluminum expanded rapidly, and with it the company. Already encompassing roughly three- quarters of the production capacity for aluminum in the British Empire, the company's \\"assets increased fivefold; sales increased fivefold; net income increased sixfold\\" between 1937 and 1944, according to a report on commissioned by the Government of Canada. The governments of the UK, Canada, the United States, and Australia facilitated this growth with low-interest loans and tax deferrals. In 1945, the Aluminium Company of Canada was officially registered under the trade name Alcan. Sales fell substantially in the immediate aftermath of the War, but rebounded with postwar expansion, as aluminum was increasingly in use in construction, by electrical utilities, and in manufacturing. In 1951, it initiated a $500-million project at Kitimat, British Columbia, the largest public-private partnership ever introduced in Canada at the time. Despite a June 1950 antitrust ruling that forced shareholders divest themselves of shares in either Aluminum Limited (as the company was then known) or Alcoa, and the rise of American rivals Kaiser and Reynolds, Alcan remained a dominant player in the aluminum sector for many subsequent decades. In 1994 Alcan sold their building products unit (with a plant in Scarborough, Ontario) to Genstar Capital and the location later closed and demolished. Between 1998 and 2001, the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean became the largest construction site in North America, as Alcan undertook a $3-billion construction project in Alma with a yearly production capacity of 400,000 metric tonnes. In 2000, Alcan acquired Algroup (Alusuisse Group Ltd.), merging the companies to become Alcan, Inc. in 2001. Alcan became the second biggest primary aluminium production company. It then became the world's largest aluminium manufacturer in 2004 after acquiring the Pechiney Group, the fourth player in worldwide production and fabrication of aluminium and the number three in packaging. =Acquisition= In 2007, Rio Tinto acquired Alcan, in a US$38 billion deal. The offer served to undermine a hostile bid of $27.5bn from Alcoa, Alcan's US rival. Rio Tinto became the world's leading aluminum producer. Rio Tinto quickly announced its intention to sell off the Engineered Products and Packaging business groups. Alcan Incorporated was amalgamated with Rio Tinto Canada Holding Incorporated and renamed Rio Tinto Alcan Incorporated in 2008. The various Alcan facilities on the 53-acre site in Oxfordshire closed between 2006 and 2007, and the factory and laboratory were demolished over the course of 2008‚Äì2009.

As one of China's earliest ministers to London, Paris and Saint Petersburg, he played an important role in the diplomacy that preceded and accompanied the Sino-French War.  Early career  Zeng Jize (1839‚Äì90), a native of Hunan province, was the eldest son of Zeng Guofan (), a leading reformist minister at the Qing court, who was a descendants of Zengzi. Zeng had inherited his father's title of Marquis in 1877. He received a traditional Chinese education, but was also one of the few Chinese officials who learned English and took an interest in European affairs. With these advantages he was persuaded to represent China's interests abroad as a diplomat.  Marquis Zeng's diplomacy  Zeng was appointed minister to Britain, France and Russia in 1878, and lived in Europe for seven years (1879‚Äì1885). He made his name as a diplomat in 1880 and 1881, by renegotiating the infamous 1879 Treaty of Livadia with Russia. The resulting Treaty of Saint Petersburg (February 1881), which reversed most of the Russian gains of 1879, was generally considered a diplomatic triumph for China.Lung Chang, 66http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/TSENG_CHI-TSE.html Zeng's duties as minister to Paris were dominated by the confrontation between France and China over Tonkin that eventually culminated in the Sino-French War. Zeng's denunciations of French policy in Tonkin began softly enough in April 1882 after the capture of the citadel of Hanoi by Henri Rivi√®re, grew more insistent as French ambitions became clearer in the summer of 1883, and reached a climax immediately after the S∆°n T√¢y Campaign in December 1883. In July 1883 Zeng's optimistic assessment that the French government had no stomach for a full-scale war with China influenced the Qing government's decision to terminate the Shanghai negotiations between Li Hongzhang and Arthur Tricou over the future of Tonkin. The failure of the Shanghai negotiations stiffened France's resolve to confront the Black Flag Army to entrench its protectorate in Tonkin, and arguably made war between France and China inevitable.Eastman, 76‚Äì84 In August 1883, during a series of discussions in Paris with the French foreign minister Paul-Armand Challemel-Lacour, Zeng used the good offices of the American charg√© d'affaires E. J. Brulatour to convey Chinese proposals to the French, in an attempt to give the impression that the United States was more closely associated with China's diplomatic position on Tonkin than it really was. The manoeuvre was easily detected, and irritated both the French and the Americans.Chere, 143‚Äì52; Eastman, 85‚Äì7; Lung Chang, 174‚Äì6 In January 1884, in the wake of Admiral Am√©d√©e Courbet's capture of S∆°n T√¢y (16 December 1883), Zeng wrote a provocative article that made wounding references to the Franco-Prussian War ('The bravery of the French soldiers has been so widely praised that one might almost think that they had captured Metz or Strasbourg rather than S∆°n T√¢y'). To add insult to injury, he arranged for this article to be published in Germany, in the Breslau Gazette.Lung Chang, 214‚Äì15 This and earlier provocations goaded the French government into demanding his replacement in April 1884. The Qing court, dismayed by the rout of China's Guangxi Army in the B·∫Øc Ninh Campaign (March 1884), complied with this demand on 28 April, paving the way for the conclusion of the Tientsin Accord between France and China in May 1884. Xu Jingcheng (), an emollient career diplomat, was appointed China's minister- general to France, Germany, Austria and Italy, and Zeng was simultaneously relieved of his position as minister to France, ostensibly to allow him to devote more time to his duties as minister to Britain and Russia. Pending Xu's arrival from China (he set sail in September 1884 and only arrived in Europe in early 1885), the Chinese minister to Germany Li Fengbao () was appointed interim minister to France.Lung Chang, 215‚Äì19 Notes  References  * Chere, L., The Diplomacy of the Sino-French War (1883‚Äì1885): Global Complications of an Undeclared War (Notre Dame, Indiana, 1988) * Eastman, L., Throne and Mandarins: China's Search for a Policy during the Sino-French Controversy (Stanford, 1984) * Lung Chang [ÈæçÁ´†], Yueh-nan yu Chung-fa chan- cheng [Ë∂äÂçóËàá‰∏≠Ê≥ïÊà∞Áà≠, Vietnam and the Sino-French War] (Taipei, 1993) Category:1839 births Category:1890 deaths Category:Qing dynasty politicians from Hunan Category:People of the Sino-French War Category:Qing dynasty diplomats Category:People of the Tonkin campaign Category:Politicians from Xiangtan Category:Ministers of Zongli Yamen Category:Ambassadors of China to France Category:Ambassadors of China to Russia Category:Ambassadors of China to the United Kingdom ","title":"Zeng Jize"},{"id":"18158507","text":"Tenayuca () is a pre-Columbian Mesoamerican archaeological site in the Valley of Mexico. In the Postclassic period of Mesoamerican chronology, Tenayuca was a settlement on the former shoreline of the western arm of Lake Texcoco. It was located approximately to the northwest of Tenochtitlan (the heart of present-day Mexico City). Tenayuca is considered to be the earliest capital city of the Chichimec, nomadic tribes who migrated and settled in the Valley of Mexico, where they formed their own kingdoms.Tenayuca at INAH Etymology Tenayuca means walled place in Nahuatl. Location The pyramid of Tenayuca is located in San Bartolo Tenayuca in Tlalnepantla de Baz, in Mexico State. It falls within the urban sprawl of Greater Mexico City. History By some historiographic traditions Tenayuca had been founded ca. 1224 by Xolotl, a semi-legendary ruler of a \\"Chichimec\\" tribe that had settled in the Valley of Mexico in the period some time after the 12th-century collapse of the former political hegemony in the Valley -- the so-called Toltec empire, emanating from Tula. Xolotl was succeeded by Nopaltzin who consolidated the Chichimec Kingdom . His son, Tlotzin, became lord of Tenayuca. When Nopaltzin died, his successor Quinatzin transferred the seat of Chichimec power to Texcoco, relegating Tenayuca to a site of secondary importance. However archaeological remains recovered from Tenayuca indicate that the site had already been occupied in the Classic Period, long before this foundational event described in several of the Mesoamerican historical documents. Its population increased in the early Postclassic and continued to increase after the fall of Tula, when Tenayuca became an important regional power.Davies 1982, 1990, p166. In the late 13th century A.D., some time after the arrival of the Chichimecs at Tenayuca, Tochintecuhtli,Rabbit Lord in Nahuatl the ruling lord of Tenayuca, allied himself with Huetzin, lord of the Acolhuas of Coatlich√°n, and their alliance dominated the central Valley of Mexico, extending as far northeast as Tulancingo. By the mid 14th century the power of Tenayuca had already waned, it was conquered and replaced as a regional power by nearby Azcapotzalco.Davies 1982, 1990, p167. Around 1434, Tenochtitlan conquered Tenayuca, bringing it into the Aztec Empire.Hassig 1988, p.152. At the time of the Spanish Conquest Tenayuca was still occupied, and fighting took place there in 1520. The conquistador Bernal D√≠az del Castillo referred to Tenayuca as the \\"town of the serpents\\".Smith 1996, 2003, p.41. At some point the site was abandoned. It was rediscovered during excavations made by Mexican archaeologists in 1925. Genesis of Aztec sacred architecture Aztec temple architecture primarily developed at Tenayuca, which has the earliest example yet found of the typical Aztec double pyramid, which consists of joined pyramidal bases supporting two temples. After Tenayuca came under Aztec dominance, the Aztecs adopted this innovative style for the worship of their own deities.Matos Moctezuma 2002, p57. The temple of Tenayuca is better preserved than the similar temple of Tlatelolco and its wall of serpents remains mostly intact on three sides of the base of the pyramid.Kelly 2001, pp. 92-93.Davies 1982, 1990, p232. Site layout and description The base of the Aztec pyramid of Tenayuca -- adorned with a row of rattlesnake sculptures, known as coatepantli in Nahuatl. The site consists of a massive pyramidal platform with a double stairway rising on the western side to where the twin temples of Tlaloc and Huitzilopochtli once stood. The temple of Tlaloc occupied the northern part of the pyramid while the Huitzilopochtli temple stood to the south. Some of the temple steps are carved with year-glyphs such as knives, circles and shields. To the south of the stairway at ground level is a projecting platform bearing sculptures of crossed bones and projecting skulls. Like many Mesoamerican temples, various phases of construction were built one on top of the other. In the case of Tenayuca, the size of the building increased through six phases of construction but the basic form remained unchanged. The original double pyramid was enlarged five times, the first time probably in 1299 and then successively at 52-year intervals. The last phase of construction probably dates to 1507 and measures 62 meters wide by 50 meters deep. Aztec influence is apparent from the third stage in 1351, the following stages were purely Aztec in style, as demonstrated by the sloping tiers of the pyramid rather than the vertical walls apparent in the earlier stages. The pyramid base is surrounded by a coatepantli (Nahuatl for wall of serpents), a low platform supporting 138 stone sculptures of snakes. Their bodies were once covered with plaster and painted in a variety of colours, with their scales painted black. On the north and south sides of the pyramid, at ground level, are two sculptures of coiled serpents . The crests on their heads bear markings representing the stars and identify them as Xiuhcoatl (the fire serpent). All the serpent sculptures around the pyramid were associated with fire and sun worship. There are several altars and shrines nearby that were also excavated, some of these also have serpent sculptures. 200 meters from the main pyramid of Tenayuca are the remains of what appear to have been an elite residential complex, with surviving plaster floors in some rooms. This area has been labelled Tenayuca II by archaeologists and appears to have gone through various phases of construction. The pyramid of Tenayuca is in the care of the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History) and is open to the public.

They learn from a new arrival that the United Nations, which funds the base, is having second thoughts about its viability. Many of the colonists have been so long on Mars that their muscles have become acclimatised to the low gravity conditions and they would be unlikely to survive long under Earth conditions. Nevertheless, they decide to send an 'embassy' (the Voices) to Earth to plead their cause. Maurice, his uncle Leslie Yorke, and Bruce Talbot make the trip. Whilst in Earth orbit, they hear on radio a debate at the United National Scientific Council, which has been hijacked by a few self-serving politicians. The crew decide to land and try to address the debate. Despite being badly affected by Earth gravity and heat, they make it to the debating chamber. Maurice manages to convey his opinions on the importance of the Mars colony to the delegates, before collapsing. They are conveyed back to the spaceship and leave Earth. They later learn that attempts to close the base have been defeated.

The future of Palestinian prisoners detained by Israel is considered central to progress in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process. The sentences of Palestinian prisoners are commonly based on an accusation that they are \\"members of illegal organizations\\" (meaning formerly the PLO, and now Hamas or Islamic Jihad), planning or taking part in sabotage against Israelis, or raising a Palestinian flag. In December 2011, 4,772 security prisoners were serving terms in Israeli prisons. Of these, 552 were sentenced to life terms. In April 2013, there were 4,748 security prisoners, 155 of them held under administrative detention, meaning incarceration without charge. At the end of May 2020, the number had shrunk to 4,236 security prisoners, including 352 held in administrative detention. Overview depopulated Palestinian village of Khirbat Al-Dumun Jalame Prison (Kishon Detention Center), located at the depopulated Palestinian village of Al-Jalama, Haifa The military court system for the occupied territories, modeled partially on the British military court system set up in 1937, was established in 1967, and had been called the institutional centerpiece of the occupation, and within it West Bank Palestinians are treated as \\"foreign civilians\\". The measures it applies, combining elements of colonial administration and martial law, cover not only incidents involving recourse to violence but many other activities, non-violent protests, political and cultural statements and the way Palestinians are allowed to move or associate with each other. Some of the problematic facets of the system Palestinian prisoners are subject to are, according to sociology professor Lisa Hajjar; prolonged detention of suspects incommunicado, impeding a client's access to his lawyer, the routine use of coercion under interrogation to obtain confessions, and the introduction of \\"secret evidence\\". Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been put on trial since 1967. According to Saree Makdisi the cumulative total of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel reached 650,000 in 2005. Of these, according to Tamar Pelleg-Sryck (2011), tens of thousands have been subjected to administrative detention. The incarceration rate was the highest in the world during the First Intifada (1987-1992) ‚Äì and their conviction rates varied from 90 to 95%, being for the most part secured by plea bargains in 97% of cases. According to Red Cross statistics, in the first two decades of the occupation, from 1967 to 1987, one in three Palestinians, about 500,000, were detained by Israeli forces, and on any given day the courts would be crammed with \\"children in handcuffs, women pleading with soldiers, anxious people thronging lawyers for information.\\" After the Oslo Accords, courts in Palestinian towns were withdrawn to Area C, causing greater difficulty for lawyers and family of the defendant to get access to the tribunals because of the permit system. The specific practice of administrative detention was initially introduced by the British to subdue Palestinians, but was then increasingly applied to cope with behavior by Jewish political activists and suspected members of Jewish paramilitary organizations, an extension vigorously opposed by Jewish settlers at the time and one which Jewish lawyers in July 1936 argued should be repealed. Dov Yosef likewise argued in 1948 that the practice abolished the writ of habeas corpus and had led to the improper incarceration by the British of numerous Jewish activists. The state of Israel, on securing independence however, retained this body of regulations on the new state's statute book. Article 111 therein enabled military commanders to arrest and detain anyone, without public reasons given or the laying of formal charges or trial, for periods of up to one year, though a provision exists for indefinitely extending any person detained under the order. The Fourth Geneva Convention permits detentions, and on these precedents the IDF promulgated its Article 87 of the Order Concerning Security Instructions, and applied it to cases where the rules of evidence of Israeli courts would not allow the suspect to be convicted. Egregious examples of the practice took place early in the occupation. Taisir al-Arouri, a Bir Zeit University professor of Mathematics, was arrested at night on 21 April 1974 and released on 18 January 1978, after suffering 45 months of imprisonment without trial or charges being laid, only after Amnesty International issued a public protest. Writing in 1978 Michael Goldstein called the detention system \\"an aberration of criminal justice\\", but temporary in nature and dictated by an ongoing war situation. He credited Israel with refraining from making it part of their judicial, as opposed to military, system. In a five-month period of the First Intifada alone, Israel put 1,900 Palestinians under an administrative detention order. For the decade from 2000 to 2009 it was estimated that at any one time anywhere between 600 and 1,000 Palestinians were subjected annually to administrative detention. Amnesty International stated that in 2017 Israeli authorities continue to adopt administrative detention rather than criminal prosecution to detain \\"hundreds of Palestinians, including children, civil society leaders and NGO workers, without charge or trial under renewable orders, based on information withheld from detainees and their lawyers\\", and that administrative detainees numbered 441. Notable Palestinians who have been recently subjected to the process include Khalida Jarrar and Ahmad Qatamesh, both of whom are regarded by Amnesty International as prisoners of conscience. Number of prisoners According to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, from the Six-Day War (1967) to the First Intifada (1988), over 600,000 Palestinians were held in Israeli jails for a week or more.Arrests, imprisonment and torture, Palestinian Centre for Human Rights. Retrieved 27 June 2008. Rory McCarthy, The Guardian's Jerusalem correspondent, estimated that one-fifth of the population has at one time been imprisoned since 1967. On 11 December 2012, the office of then Prime Minister Salam Fayyad stated that since 1967, 800,000 Palestinians, or roughly 20% of the total population and 40% of the male population, had been imprisoned by Israel at one point in time. About 100,000 had been held in administrative detention. According to Palestinian estimates, 70% of Palestinian families have had one or more family members sentenced to jail terms in Israeli prisons as a result of activities against the occupation. According to B'Tselem, there was a decline, starting in 1998, in the number of Palestinians held in administrative detention. Less than 20 were held from 1999 to October 2001. However, with the start of the Second Intifada (2000), and particularly after Operation Defensive Shield (2002), the numbers steadily rose.Administrative Detention, B'Tselem. Retrieved 27 June 2008. According to the F√©d√©ration Internationale des ligues des Droits de l'Homme (FIDH), from the beginning of the Second Intifada to April 2003, more than 28,000 Palestinians were incarcerated. In April 2003 alone there were more than 5,500 arrests. In 2007, the number of Palestinians under administrative detention averaged about 830 per month, including women and minors under the age of 18.2007 Annual Report: Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, B'Tselem, Special Report, December 2007. By March 2008, more than 8,400 Palestinians were held by Israeli civilian and military authorities, of which 5,148 were serving sentences, 2,167 were facing legal proceedings and 790 were under administrative detention, often without charge or knowledge of the suspicions against them. In 2010, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported that there were \\"over 7,000\\" Palestinians in Israeli jails, of them 264 under administrative detention. Most of the prisoners are held at Ofer Prison in the West Bank and Megiddo and Ketziot prisons in Israel.Who are the Mid-East prisoners: Palestinian prisoners BBC News. 31 March 2008. In April 2008, Adalah: The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel stated that 11,000 Palestinian prisoners were in prison and detention in Israel, including 98 women, 345 minors, 50 members of the Palestinian Legislative Council, and 3 ministers of the Palestinian National Authority. Of these 11,000 Palestinian prisoners, 8,456 were from the West Bank, 762 from the Gaza Strip, and 694 from within Israel itself (including 552 from Jerusalem). In October 2008, Haaretz reported that 600 Palestinians were being held in administrative detention in Israel, including \\"about 15 minors who do not know even know why they are being detained.\\" = Minors = In 2000‚Äì2009, 6,700 Palestinians between the ages of 12 and 18 were arrested by the Israeli authorities, according to Defence for Children International's Palestine Section (DCI/PS). In 2009, a total of 423 were being held in Israeli detention and interrogation centers and prisons. In April 2010 the number dropped to 280. DCI/PS states that these detentions stand in contravention of international law. Up to August 2013, 193 minors were imprisoned, and according to The Economist, \\"nearly all\\" were \\"brought to court in leg shackles and handcuffs.\\" = Public figures = Marwan Barghouti, a leader of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades militia, convicted by Israeli court on five counts of murder and sentenced to five life sentences and forty years in prison. There are several Palestinian leaders and politicians held in Israeli jails, including 47 Hamas members of the Palestinian Legislative Council, in addition to some ministers and the mayors and municipal council members of various towns and cities in the West Bank. Marwan Barghouti a leader of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades militia and al-Mustaqbal political party, was arrested and tried by an Israeli civilian court for attacks carried out by the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. He was convicted on 20 May 2004 on five counts of murder and sentenced to five life sentences and forty years. Ahmad Sa'adat, secretary-general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) is currently held by Israel. In 2002, he was tried, convicted and imprisoned in Jericho by the Palestinian National Authority, for his role in the assassination of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi on 17 October 2001 by the PFLP. The Palestinian Supreme Court later declared his imprisonment unconstitutional. His imprisonment by the PNA, rather than extradition to Israel as required by the Oslo Accords, was negotiated between the PNA, Israel the US and the UK. Under the terms of that agreement, the imprisonment was to be monitored by US and UK observers. On 14 March 2006, after both the American and British monitors, as well as the Palestinian guards of the Jericho jail abandoned their posts, Israeli forces surrounded the prison in Jericho and took Sa'adat, who has been under administrative detention since then.

Payments by Palestinian Authority In 2003, Palestinian law mandated a monthly salary of $250 to Palestinian security detainees imprisoned in Israel for up to five years, with a higher payment to those serving a longer term. Those who served a life sentence were paid $1,000 per month. In January 2011, Prime Minister Salam Fayyad enacted an amendment to increase these payments by 300%. In March 2009, an extra $190 was added to these payments to prisoners affiliated with Palestine Liberation Organization factions in Israeli prisons. Each PLO-affiliated prisoner receives $238 per month, along with an extra $71 if they're married and $12 for each child. As of May 2011, the Palestinian Authority spent $4.5 million per month paying Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, including prisoners convicted of murdering civilians, and $6.5 million to the families of suicide bombers. The salaries, funded by the PA, are given to Fatah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad prisoners. These payments comprise 6% of the PA's budget. Hamas member Abdullah Barghouti, who was sentenced to 67 life terms for perpetrating the killings of 67 Israelis, receives NIS 4,000. In addition, prisoners who have been imprisoned for over 30 years receive NIS 12,000 ($3,000) per month. In November 2011, ahead of the Eid Al-Adha holiday, the Palestinian Authority paid Palestinian prisoners 550 NIS (about $140), as well as 50 NIS (sbout $12) to purchase sweets during the holiday. In October 2012, the Daily Mail online edition reported that prisoners were receiving British aid money in amounts between 230 pounds - 1957 pounds per month, depending on several criteria, regardless of the crimes committed. Pauline Latham MP, of the International Development Select Committee said: \\"I hope that after further investigation, the DfID and the FCO can ascertain exactly how the Palestinian Authority spends aid money and put a stop to its use in detracting from any potential peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\\" Alan Duncan, International Development Minister said: \\"The PA operates two social assistance programmes to provide welfare payments to households who have lost their main breadwinner. I hope you will also agree that dependent spouses or children should not be held responsible for the crimes of family members, or forced to live in poverty as a consequence.\\" Prisoner exchanges and releases Israel has released Palestinians in prisoner exchange agreements concluded with various Palestinian militia factions. In 1985, Israel released 1,150 prisoners, including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, in exchange for three Israeli POWs being held by Ahmed Jibril. The 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip called for the release of Palestinian detainees in stages, as part of a series of \\"confidence-building measures.\\" Upon the Israeli withdrawal from populated Palestinian centers in 1995, many Palestinians in military jails were transferred to jails inside Israel, which some Palestinian activists said was a breach of articles 49 and 76 of the Geneva Conventions prohibiting deportations. The 1998 Wye River Memorandum specified that Israel was to release 750 Palestinian prisoners, some 250 of which were released by the time of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum in 1999.Europa, 2004, p. 555. Wye 2 reduced the number of those to be released from 500 to 350, and these were freed by mid-October 1999. Israeli released 26 security prisoners at the beginning of Ramadan,On page 252 of Politics and Sociolinguistic Reflexes, \\"security prisoners\\" is defined as a term used to refer to \\"Palestinians imprisoned in Israeli jails under the charge of being involved in acts that endanger the security of Israel.\\" half of whom had a few months left to serve. An additional seven prisoners from East Jerusalem were released the next day after protests from the Palestinian Authority, which had expected more. In 2000, another 18 prisoners were released as a goodwill gesture in March and June. At the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit on 8 February 2005, Israel pledged to release another 900 Palestinian prisoners of the 7,500 being held at the time. By the spring of 2005, 500 of these had been released, but after Qassam rocket attacks on Sderot on 5 May, Ariel Sharon withheld the release of the remaining 400, citing the need for the Palestinian Authority to rein in militants. On 25 August 2008, Israel released 198 prisoners in a \\"goodwill gesture\\" to encourage diplomatic relations and support Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas.Israel releases 198 Palestinian prisoners, The Guardian, Tuesday 26 August 2008. On 15 December 2008, Israel released 224 Palestinian prisoners from Ofer Prison in the West Bank, 18 of them released to the Gaza Strip.Israel releases 224 Palestinian prisoners, International Herald Tribune, 15 December 2008. In 2011, the Israeli government released 1,027 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier held by Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip for more than five years. Hamas leader Ahmed Jabari was quoted in the Saudi Arabian newspaper Al-Hayat as confirming that the prisoners released as part of the deal were collectively responsible for the killing of 569 Israeli civilians.Army Radio newscast, 20 October 2011 The agreement was the largest prisoner exchange agreement in Israeli history and the highest price Israel has ever paid for a single soldier. Gilad Shalit was also the first captured Israeli soldier to be released alive in 26 years. In October 2012, according to data compiled by the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, dozens of the prisoners released in the Gilad Shalit exchange had resumed terror activity. Many had joined the leadership of Hamas, others had developed weapons and fired rockets, some had recruited members to terrorist cells in the West Bank. Former prisoners in the West Bank have also engaged in violent activity, and Israel arrested 40 of them for rioting, throwing Molotov cocktails, funneling money to terrorism, and other acts. One cell in Hebron planted a bomb in Jerusalem and plotted to kidnap an Israeli soldier. However, a senior defense official stated that cooperation between Israeli security forces and Palestinian Authority was effective in tracking the individuals and preventing further attacks. In August 2013, the Israeli Cabinet agreed on a four-stage process by which 104 Palestinian prisoners will be released as part of a \\"confidence-building\\" measure aimed to boosting renewed Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. All of the prisoners slated for release were convicted for terrorism against Israel before the signing of the Oslo Accords in September 1993; most were either directly involved in the murder of Israelis and many were serving life sentences. In December 2013, Israel freed another 26 Palestinian prisoners under the peace talks brokered by US Secretary of State John Kerry.  Breach of international law  = Terrorists versus \\"prisoners of war\\" = In July 2003, the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) reported that \\"Israel does not recognize Palestinian prisoners as having the status of prisoners of war.\\" The prisoners are instead treated as politically motivated criminals or terrorists, and either charged with terrorist offences or violent crimes, or administratively detained without charge. It has been argued by supporters of the Palestinian cause that according to the Geneva Conventions, Palestinians who are members of armed resistance organizations should be entitled to prisoner of war status and not called terrorists.UN, 13 September 2011, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 , par. 20-21 (doc.nr. A/66/358) The position of the Geneva Conventions with regard to Palestinians detained for armed activity against Israeli forces is not entirely clear.

Since then, most of them are deported to prisons and detention centres on Israeli territoryHCJ Rejects Petition against Holding Detained Palestinians in Israeli Territory Israeli Democracy Institute This was described as a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which states that detained persons have the right to remain in occupied territory in all stages of detention, including serving of sentences if convicted.Ongoing Violations of the Rights of Palestinian Prisoners , Al-Haq On 28 March 2010, the Supreme Court of Israel rejected a petition by the human rights group Yesh Din seeking to halt the practice of detention inside Israel. = Administrative detention = Khalida Jarrar has been in Administrative detention since October, 2019. Amnesty International has stated that Israel has imprisoned Palestinians for prolonged periods, without charging them or putting them on trial. Israel has said that detention without trial is a necessary security measure used to avoid exposing confidential information in trials.B'Tselem, 1 January 2011, Criticism of administrative detention under the Administrative Detention Order The European Union has criticized the policy. The Defense Minister has the authority to issue Administrative Detention orders for up to six months in cases where there is a reasonable chance that the person harms the security of the state. The same Minister has the authority to renew such orders. Likewise, the Chief of the General Staff can issue such orders, but valid for only 48 hours. Law enforcement authorities have to show cause within 48 hours (in a hearing behind closed doors). Administrative Detention orders can be appealed to the District Court and, if denied there, to the Supreme Court of Israel. The District Court can annul such orders if it finds the administrative detention occurred for reasons other than security (e.g., common crimes, or the exercise of freedom of expression). Overall supervisory authority on the application of the relevant law rests with the Minister of Justice. Within the West Bank, any local army commander can issue an administrative detention order, and the order can be appealed at the local military court, or, if denied there, at the Supreme Court. Here too, an administrative detention order is valid for at most six months, but can be renewed by the appropriate authority. Israel refers its use of administrative detention in the occupied territories to Article 78 of the Fourth Geneva Convention 1949, which states that \\"If the Occupying Power considers it necessary, for imperative reasons of security, to take safety measures concerning protected persons, it may, at the most, subject them to assigned residence or to internment.\\" The first use of an administrative detention order in the West Bank following the 1967 War was on 3 September 1967. Over 100 hundred people were detained during the first year of the occupation. The detainees were held for up to a year or deported. In 1974 there was a crack down on Palestinian nationalist organizations which led to 200 people being detained, some of whom were held without trial for five years. In 1978 Amnesty International launched an appeal against the use of administrative detention which led to a change in procedures. The number detained fell from 30 cases in 1978 to only one in 1981. He was released in March 1982 having been held for seven years. The use of administrative detention orders resumed in August 1985 with over 100 detained in two weeks.Middle East International No 263, 22 November 1985, Publishers Lord Mayhew, Dennis Walters MP; Sami al-Aboudi pp. 11,12 Some notable examples include: *On 20 March 2010, Moatasem Nazzal, a 16-year-old Palestinian was arrested at his home in Qalandiya refugee camp without explanation and remained imprisoned until 26 December 2010. Khader Adnan graffiti in Ramallah *On 17 December 2011, Israel arrested Khader Adnan for \\"activities that threaten regional security.\\" While Adnan was a member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Israel did not accuse Adnan of direct involvement in any attacks by the group. Israeli officials did not charge him with any crime. After Adnan went on a hunger strike, the Israeli justice ministry announced that he would be released. This announcement reportedly cancelled a judicial review of the Israeli practice to hold prisoners without trial. * On 21 November 2015, Palestinian journalist Muhammad al-Qiq was put on administrative detention, allegedly for \\"terror activity.\\" His case gained notoriety as he went on a hunger strike to protest his detention. He was released on May 19, 2016 after enduring a 94-day hunger strike and without having been charged with any crime. * On 15 June 2016, Bilal Kayed was placed under administrative detention after being released from a 15-year-long prison sentence. Kayed went on a hunger strike and eventually reached a deal with Israeli authorities to be released at the end of the six months. * On 3 April 2017, a 16-year-old boy Nour Issa was placed under administrative detention for four months (subsequently extended to seven) on charges of \\"incitement on Facebook.\\" As of January 2012, 309 Palestinians were held without criminal charges, according to B'Tselem: *16 Palestinians have been held without charge for 2‚Äì4.5 years *88 have been held for 1‚Äì2 years *80 have been held for 6 months-1 year In July 2012 the number had decreased to 250. According to the Israel Prison Service figures for December 2012, 178 Palestinians were being held in administrative detention (without charge or trial). According B'Tselem that number had rose to 352 in May 2020. Allegations of human rights abuse The IDF has been accused of prisoner abuse by Palestinian advocacy organizations.Israeli army abuses Palestinian prisoners: group, Reuters, 22 June 2008.Report: Soldiers routinely abuse Palestinian prisoners, Haaretz, 22 June 2008.Utterly Forbidden: The Torture And Ill-Treatment Of Palestinian Detainees, B'Tselem & Hamoked, May 2007. =Physical torture= Until 1999, \\"moderate physical pressure\\" was permitted in the interrogation of suspects by the Israeli Shin Bet, as outlined in the Landau Commission report of 1987. B'Tselem drew up a list of alleged interrogation methods that includes: \\"depriving the interrogee of sleep for a number of days by binding him or her in painful positions; playing loud music; covering their head with a filthy sack; exposing the interrogee to extreme heat and cold; tying them to a low chair, tilting forward; tightly cuffing the interrogee's hands; having the interrogee stand, hands tied and drawn upwards; having the interrogee lie on his back on a high stool with his body arched backwards; forcing the interrogee to crouch on his toes with his hands tied behind him; violent shaking of the detainee, the interrogator grasping and shaking him; using threats and curses, and feeding him poor-quality and insufficient amounts of food.\\" In 1997, the United Nations Committee Against Torture stated that such methods constituted torture and were in breach of the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, a convention ratified by Israel in 1991. In September 1999, Israel's High Court ruled that the Israeli Security Agency (ISA) does not have legal authority to use physical means of interrogation that are not \\"reasonable and fair\\" and cause the detainee to suffer. While the court noted that a reasonable interrogation is likely to cause discomfort and put pressure on the detainee, this is lawful only if \\"it is a 'side effect' inherent to the interrogation,\\" and not aimed at tiring out or \\"breaking\\" the detainee as an end in itself. Uri Davis wrote that the ruling of 1999 came after 50 years of silence \\"in the face of systematic torture practiced in Israeli jails and detention centers against Palestinian prisoners and detainees, as well as other prisoners.\\" However, Davis also notes that after the Supreme Court ruling, the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel found that \\"torture has, in most cases, ceased.\\" In 2000, an official Israeli report acknowledged torture of detainees during the First Intifada. The report said that the leadership of Shin Bet knew about the torture but did nothing to stop it. Human rights organisations claim some detainees died or were left paralysed.  Prisoners of Gaza  More than 334 prisoners from Gaza includes 2 women and a child. Their families had been under many restrictions to visit them in the Israelis prisons. They were required to obtain permits from Israeli authorities to pass the Israeli Security Agency, so they can visit their relatives. While there is many limitations on Gaza families to enter in Israel. They allow prison visits every 2 month at most for 3 members of the family, only the spouses, parents and children under 16 years- old. In 2007, Israel prevent families from Gaza to visit their relatives after the capture of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. The restrictions increased after armed groups in Gaza kidnapped the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed during the 2014 Gaza conflict. Education programs In 1967, Palestinian prisoners were initially denied pencils and paper. In the wake of prisoner protests, access was granted to pens, pencils, paper, books, newspapers and monitored radio broadcasting. Libraries were established in every prison, and literacy and language courses were organized. Young prisoners were offered classes to prepare for the General Secondary Examination. Thousands of Palestinian prisoners have learned Hebrew in Israeli prisons. In the 1980s, according to Maya Rosenfeld, the option of armed resistance was completely blocked and prisons became a \\"sanctuary\\". Her research among Palestinian refugees in the Dheisheh camp in Bethlehem found that the politicization process of young men from the camp underwent a qualitative transformation during their period of imprisonment, which she attributes to the internal organization practices of Palestinian prisoners and the central role of studies and education. Eventually, Palestinian prisoners were allowed to take online courses from the Open University of Israel, and to complete academic degrees. Under the program, education for the prisoners was free, with prison authorities paying their university tuition. In 2009, there were 250 Palestinian prisoners studying at Israel's Open University. In June 2011, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced, in response to a halt in the peace talks, that Palestinian prisoners would no longer be granted the right to pursue academic degrees in prison. In late 2012, three prisoners appealed the decision the Israeli Supreme Court, which rejected their appeal. In their ruling, the judges stated that the right to free university education does not apply to those convicted of terror offenses. The ruling did, however, call on prison authorities to be \\"considerate\\" in deciding the cases of prisoners already in the midst of academic programs. Hunger strikes In 1998, there were nine hunger strikes conducted by Palestinian prisoners in different prisons in Israel. On 1 May 2000, almost 1,000 of the 1,650 Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli prisons at the time participated in a month-long hunger strike, in protest against \\"arbitrary treatment by prison officials, substandard prison conditions, prohibitions on family visits, use of solitary confinement, poor medical care, and Israel's refusal to release all the categories of prisoners specified in its agreements with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\\" Mass demonstrations in solidarity with the prisoners erupted throughout the areas of Palestinian self-rule in the days following, culminating in a mass protest on 15 May (the anniversary of the Nakba) and ending on 18 May, with 7 Palestinians killed and 1,000 injured. In addition, 60 Israelis were also wounded. The hunger strike was ended on 31 May after Israeli prison authorities promised to review the complaints and ease restrictions on visitations. A report by the Israeli government released in June 2001 on conditions in the Shatta prison noted that the living conditions were \\"particularly harsh\\" in the wing where prisoners from the Occupied Palestinian Territories were held, and concluded that the exposed tents and filthy bathrooms in which prisoners were housed and bathed were unfit for human use. In February 2017, Mohammed al-Qiq, a Palestinian journalist in an Israeli prison threatened an open hunger strike against administrative detention upon his re-arrest which the Israel Security Agency stated was for \\"terror activity\\" for the Islamist group Hamas. He was released from prison in May 2016 after a 94-day hunger strike and re-arrested in mid-January after participating in a protest on the West Bank demanding the release of bodies of Palestinian militants. Al-Qiq was one of a number of prominent Palestinian hunger strikers in 2016, who included the Balboul brothers who went without food for 77 and 79 days, Malik al-Qadi for 68 days, Bilal Kayid for 71 days. =2012 mass strikes= Following his arrest on 17 December 2011, Khader Adnan, alleged by Israel to be a leader of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, began a hunger strike in protest at what he claims were the violent circumstances of his arrest. Hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli prisons reportedly joined Adnan in his hunger strike as an act of solidarity. In April 2012, he was released after fasting for 66 days. In February 2012, approximately 1,800 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons began a mass hunger strike in protest at the practice of administrative detention. Israel holds about 4,500 Palestinian prisoners, of which about 310 are being held in administrative detention, without the right to a trial. Four of the hunger strikers spent over two months without food. The demands of the hunger strikers included the right to family visits for prisoners from Gaza, the end of the use of extended solitary confinement and the release of those held under the administrative detention laws. Demonstrations in support of the prisoners were held in Nazareth, Umm al-Fahm, Kfar Kanna and Haifa. On 7 May 2012, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected the appeals on human rights grounds of two of the prisoners, Tha'er Halahlah and Bilal Diab. A few days later, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon and the International Committee of the Red Cross both expressed concern about the condition of the hunger strikers. On 14 May, it was announced that the prisoners had agreed to end their hunger strike, having reached a deal with the Israeli authorities, brokered by Egypt and Jordan and following a formal request from Mahmoud Abbas. Under the deal, Israel agreed to limit administrative detention to six months, except in cases where new evidence against a suspect had emerged, to increase access to family visits and to return prisoners in solitary confinement to normal cells. There was also an agreement to open further discussions on improving prison conditions and representatives of the hunger strikers agreed not to engage in militant activity, including recruitment, within prisons. Hanan Ashrawi of the Palestinian National Council stated the hunger strikers had \\"truly demonstrated that non-violent resistance is an essential tool in our struggle for freedom\\". Political and social activism According to Yezid Sayigh, an \\"inadvertent consequence\\" of Israel's internal security measures was to contribute to the social mobilization of Palestinian society. Due to the large number of students and youth in prison from the mid-1970s to early 1980s, the prison population \\"tended to be young, educated, and familiar with the tactics of civil disobedience and unarmed protest.\\" In prison, they were exposed to political indoctrination and instruction in security and organization from veteran guerillas. Prisoners organized themselves according to political affiliation and initiated educational programs, making the prisons \\"unsurpassed 'cadre schools'\\". Upon their release, they became leaders of students movements in Palestinian universities and colleges. An Israeli investigation among Palestinian prisoners in the early stages of the First Intifada found that their political mobilization was not so much ideologically based, as it was a function of repeated humiliations at the hands of Israeli forces. =Palestinian Prisoners' Document= Five Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails, affiliated with Fatah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), authored the Palestinian Prisoners' Document in 2006. The document outlined 18 points on the basis of which negotiations with Israel should proceed. =Palestinian Prisoners Club= The Palestinian Prisoners Club is an independent, non-governmental, Palestinian organization which was established in 1993 with around 1,600 members of former Palestinian prisoners who were at least a year in an Israeli jail. The purpose of the club is to assist and support the thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. The club operates in variety of ways, ranging from legal aid, political action for the release of the prisoners, to aid to the families of prisoners. Abdulal al- Anani is the president of the club, and Abdullah Zghari is the club's executive director. However, since at least 2011, Qadura Fares has been consistently referred to as the \\"head\\" of the Palestinian Prisoners Club, so it is unclear exactly what position Fares actually holds. = Mohammed Abu Sakha = In March 2016, Amnesty International launched a campaign to free a Palestinian circus trainer Mohammed Abu Sakha, who is being held without a charge or trial since his arrest in December 2015. Shin Bet claims that the reason for the detention is that Sakha is a member of a terrorist organisation. The main purposes of the campaign are to put pressure on Israel and to highlight the cases of over 600 other prisoners in similar situation. The call has been answered with protests being held around the world.

Some of his other designs are the H-35, H-40, H-star, H-323, Targa 42, Targa 96, Finnsailor 34 and 29, Deger√∂ 33, Joe 17, Joe 34, Netta, IS 400, Artina 29 and Artina 33 as well as a lot of one-off boats.SailboatData.com - sailboat designs of Hans Groop by year References Category:1932 births Category:Living people Category:Finnish yacht designers Category:Swedish-speaking Finns ","title":"Hans Groop"},{"id":"18158624","text":"Jiajak Jaqeli () was the Empress consort of Alexios II of Trebizond. Family Jiajak was a daughter of Beka I, the Jaqeli atabeg of Samtskhe. The Jaqelis held the Georgian feudal office of Eristavi, which could be \\"governor of a region\\" or an \\"army-commander\\",Mariam Lordkipanidze , \\"Georgia in the XI- XII centuries\\", Glossary roughly equivalent to the Byzantine strategos and normally translated into English as \\"duke\\". Marriage The marriage of Jiajak to Alexios II can be estimated to c. 1300. The Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos had been his guardian and wanted Alexios to marry a daughter of the high court official Nikephoros Choumnos, but, without asking for the permission, the young man instead married jiajak Jaqeli. Andronikos appealed to the Church to annul the marriage but the Patriarch refused to assist him, on the ground that Jiajak was reported to be already pregnant. Alexios' mother Eudokia Palaiologina, who returned to Trebizond on the pretext of inducing her son to dissolve the marriage, advised him to keep his Iberian wife.William Miller, Trebizond: The last Greek Empire of the Byzantine Era: 1204-1461, 1926 (Chicago: Argonaut, 1969), pp. 32f The duration of their marriage remains uncertain. Alexios died in 1330 but there is no report when Jiajak died. The Dictionnaire historique et G√©n√©alogique des grandes familles de Gr√®ce, d'Albanie et de Constantinople (1983) by Mihail-Dimitri Sturdza considers her to be only the first of two wives. The second one being Jigda, the only daughter of Demetre II of Georgia and his second wife Solghar, a Mongol. Demetre II practiced polygamy and had three known wives at the same time. While a daughter is reported in the \\"Georgian Chronicles\\", the Chronicle does not mention her being married. However older works such as the Europ√§ische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europ√§ischen Staaten (1978) by Detlev Schwennicke do not mention any second marriage for Alexios II. As a result, Sturdza's theory is not universally accepted.  Family  Djiadjak and Alexios had at least six children:George Finlay, The History of Greece and the Empire of Trebizond, (1204-1461) (Edinburgh: William Blackwood, 1851), p. 436 # Andronikos III, Emperor of Trebizond 1330-1332. # Basil, Emperor of Trebizond 1332-1340. # Michael Anachoutlou, murdered by his brother Andronikos III in 1330. # George Achpougas, murdered by his brother Andronikos III in 1330. # Anna Anachoutlou, a nun, became Empress of Trebizond 1341-1342. # Eudokia, despoina of Sinope, so named for having married the Emir of that city.

Until the 19th century, it was a tack farmed by a cadet branch of the Clan Mackinnon. Notable visitors included Thomas Pennant, in the course of the travels that resulted in the publication of A Tour of Scotland in 1769, and Samuel Johnson and James Boswell, on their tour of the Highlands. Johnson and Boswell On their first visit, Johnson said: ‚ÄúFrom Armidel (Armadale) we came at night to Coriatachan, a house very pleasantly situated between two brooks, with one of the highest hills of the island behind it. It is the residence of Mr. Mackinnon, by whom we were treated with very liberal hospitality, among a more numerous and elegant company than it could have been supposed easy to collect.‚Äù Corriechatachan ruins interior door on the ground level Boswell recorded that; ‚ÄúDr Johnson was much pleased with his entertainment here. There were many good books in the house: Hector Boethius in Latin; Cave's Lives of the Fathers; Baker's Chronicle; Jeremy Collier's Church History; Dr Johnson's small Dictionary; Craufurd's Officers of State, and several more‚Ä¶‚Äù On their second visit, Boswell recorded, ‚ÄúThis evening one of our married ladies, a lively pretty little woman, good-humouredly sat down upon Dr Johnson's knee, and, being encouraged by some of the company, put her hands round his neck, and kissed him. 'Do it again,' said he, 'and let us see who will tire first.' He kept her on his knee some time, while he and she drank tea. He was now like a BUCK indeed. All the company were much entertained to find him so easy and pleasant. To me it was highly comick, to see the grave philosopher--the Rambler--toying with a Highland beauty! But what could he do? He must have been surly, and weak too, had he not behaved as he did. He would have been laughed at, and not more respected, though less loved.‚Äù Legacy Corriechatachan ruins ground level The Mackinnons occupied the house until about the year 1790 at which time they relocated to Corry Lodge in Broadford. The remains are now used as a sheep fank.
