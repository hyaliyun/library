His brother, Maulana Jilani (Akhilendra Mishra) is a much respected Muslim face. Having a huge following, the maulana gets his followers out of trouble with the authorities thus adding to his power. But the maulana’s intentions are not what they seem to be. He has a sinister side to him, that of inciting mobs and spreading terrorism. He specialises in choosing boys for suicide bombing missions and brainwashes them in various ways including showing them films of atrocities against Muslims. On the tail of the maulana is the ATS cop, Rann Vijay Singh (Ajaz Khan), who has information that something is slated to happen in Lucknow on a certain date. Khan's love life has been shattered after his Muslim fiancée learnt that her brother is also a terrorist. She decides to atone for him by not marrying! Gradually,Ran Vijay has zeroed down on the maulana and worked out that a suicide bomber will destroy a crowded mall in the city. He makes it to the mall only to see the bomb going off. The bomb blast will haunt the maulana as one of the victims is his brother’s pregnant daughter-in-law, Amreen(Arjumman Mughal). Ran vijay’a hopes rested on her since she was seen talking to the bomber before it went off which meant she knew him. She is the only witness to the bombing but she is brain-dead. While the surgeon Dr.Mazhar (Manzar Sehbai) wants to keep her alive till the doctors can bring the child out of her, the maulana makes all the efforts to kill her including threatening Dr.Mazhar with mob violence and destruction of his hospital.

After selecting a nickname, players build and strengthen themselves as well as their teams by collecting, enhancing, and evolving a variety of unique legendary gods and heroes such as Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades from hundreds of cards. Currently, the game is available only in Australia.  Arena  Players can challenge each other in the arena. Players with higher ranks will receive more credits to exchange for cultivation fruits, which in turn can be used to make their heroes stronger. The Arena is unlocked when a player's team level reaches 5.  Spirit System  Every hero has their own spirit. One can rebirth heroes to use in battle by collecting enough spirit fragments. Players can not have two of the same hero. If a player receives a hero already possessed prior, then the new hero will become a spirit fragment. A player can use spirit fragments to upgrade the hero they already have to make them stronger and to gain attribute points.  Portal  Portals lead the player to many different places, and provide functions for the player to explore. Portals contain several different types of gameplay, and players can gain different types of rewards depending on their performance.  Quests  In the Quests, tab players can challenge each other for each other's Conjury Fragments. Once a player collects a full set of Conjury Fragments, they can assemble the conjury and use it as an attack, or sacrifice it to strengthen another conjury.  Sacrifice  Players can sacrifice heroes or hero spirit fragments to increase the stats and attributes of the whole team, or a specific hero.

United States=NIFC-CA= In the future, CEC will form a key pillar of the Naval Integrated Fire Control- Counter Air (NIFC-CA) capability, which will allow stealthy sensor platforms such as the F-35C Lightning II to act as forward observers with their observations channeled through the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye to less stealthy platforms such as the UCLASS or Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. In a combat situation where the United States Navy would need to penetrate an anti- access/area denial (A2/AD) environment, a carrier air wing would launch all of its aircraft. The F-35C would use its stealth to fly deep into enemy airspace and use its sensors to gather intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) data. The EA-18G Growler would use the Next Generation Jammer to provide stand-off jamming or at least degradation of early warning radars. When targets are detected by the F-35C, they would transmit weapons-quality track to the E-2D and pass that information on to Super Hornets or other F-35Cs. The F/A-18E/F fighters would penetrate as far as they could into heavily contested airspace, which is still further than an ordinary fourth-generation jet fighter, then launch stand-off weapons. The UCLASS would use aerial refueling capabilities to extend the range of the strike force and use its own ISR sensors.Inside the Navy’s Next Air War - News.USNI.org, 23 January 2014 NIFC- CA relies on the use of data-links to provide every aircraft and ship with a picture of the entire battlespace. Aircraft deploying weapons may not need to control missiles after releasing them, as an E-2D would guide them by a data- stream to the target. Other aircraft are also capable of guiding missiles from other aircraft to any target that is identified as long as they are in range; work on weapons that are more survivable and longer-ranged is underway to increase their effectiveness in the data-link-centric battle strategy. This can allow forward-deployed Super Hornets or Lightning IIs to receive data and launch weapons without needing to even have their own radars active. E-2Ds act as the central node of NIFC-CA to connect the strike group with the carrier, but every aircraft is connected to all others through their own links. Two Advanced Hawkeyes would move data using the tactical targeting network technology (TTNT) waveform to share vast amounts of data over long distances with very low latency. Other aircraft would be connected to the E-2D through Link 16 or concurrent multi-netting-4 (CMN-4), a variant of four Link 16 radio receivers \\"stacked up\\" on top of each other. Growlers would coordinate with each other using data-links to locate hostile radar emitters on land or on the ocean surface. Having several sensors widely dispersed also hardens the system to electronic warfare; all cannot be jammed, so the parts that are not can home in on the jamming energy and target it for destruction. The network is built with redundancy to make it difficult to jam over a broad geographic area. If an enemy tries to disrupt it by targeting space-based communications, a line-of-sight network can be created. Cooperative engagement also applies to ship-based protective features where Aegis radars of guided missile cruisers and destroyers are linked together into a single network to share data as a whole. This allows targets detected by one ship, as well as those seen by aircraft, to be identified by another ship and fired upon with long-range missiles like the Standard Missile 6 (SM-6) without that vessel having to actually detect it themselves. Not needing to fire on targets only once a ship's own sensors see them allows for shorter time needed to shoot, increased standoff distance to begin firing, and enables a whole fleet to intercept threats, like high-speed cruise missiles, once only a single ship sees them.You Spot, I Shoot: Aegis Ships Share Data To Destroy Cruise Missiles - Breakingdefense.com, 24 October 2014 On September 12, 2016 Lockheed used a separate ground station to relay the F-35's Multi-Function Advanced Data Link (MADL) targeting data to an Aegis system for a SM-6 launch. =Potential countermeasures= There is serious concern among the U.S. Navy that key parts of the CEC can be countered by sophisticated electronics. Russian and Chinese advancements in low-frequency radars are increasingly able to detect stealth aircraft; fighters like the F-22 Raptor and F-35 are optimized to avoid detection from higher frequencies in the Ku, X, C, and parts of the S bands, but not from longer wavelengths like L, UHF, and VHF. Previously these bands might see stealth aircraft but not clearly enough to generate a missile lock, but with improved computing power, fire control radars could discern targets more precisely by the 2020s or 2030s. Warships like the Chinese Type 52C Luyang II and Type 52D Luyang III have both high and low-frequency radars to find aircraft detectable by both wavelength ranges. This would make it difficult for the Navy F-35C to survive in a low-frequency radar environment. The entire NIFC-CA concept is also vulnerable to cyber warfare and electronic attacks, which would be used to disrupt the system reliant on data-links. Long-range anti-radiation missiles can threaten the radar-equipped E-2D, the central node of the NIFC-CA network. These threats may give impetus to calls for building the UCLASS as an all-aspect broadband stealth aircraft.Chinese and Russian Radars On Track To See Through U.S. Stealth - News.USNI.org, 29 July 2014 It is feared that the stealth F-35C could be targeted by low- frequency radar-guided missiles, like during the 1999 downing of an F-117 Nighthawk. In that incident, the F-117 Nighthawk became the first stealth plane to be shot down when it was hit by an SA-3 Goa. The low-frequency VHF acquisition radar detected it some away, then cued the higher-frequency S-band engagement radar, which small stealth planes are optimized to avoid detection, although at away sufficient lock was achieved to fire several missiles until the third one struck the Nighthawk. The creation of digital AESA VHF acquisition radars, including the Russian ground-based 3D Nebo SVU and Chinese ship-borne Type 517M, offering detection at greater ranges, faster and more accurate cueing of engagement radars, enhanced resistance to jamming, and improved mobility contribute to the perceived vulnerability of small stealth fighters.The F-35 vs. The VHF Threat - Thediplomat.com, 21 August 2014 Several important factors made the intercept in 1999 possible, including engagement radars being active for no more than 20 seconds to avoid location by NATO electronic warfare aircraft, and the use of decoys and frequent movement of the missile battery to make it difficult for NATO suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) aircraft to locate and target it. Poor operational discipline on the US's part also contributed, including the F-117 flying the same flight path on different missions, communicating on unencrypted channels that could be (and were) monitored by hostile forces, and the absence of standoff electronic warfare support aircraft to be properly aligned with enemy radars to support a stealth intrusion. The F-35C was designed for network-centric warfare, and gives the pilot enhanced situational awareness from its ability to communicate and process data obtained from onboard sensors and from other platforms. While the F-117 had no radar, the F-35C uses an AN/APG-81 AESA radar that can act as a narrowband jammer and can be used against engagement radars. Under NIFC-CA, F-35Cs will routinely be supported by Growlers and Super Hornets to jam and destroy enemy targets beyond the range of surface-to- air missiles. Data-links used to share information are high-bandwidth and jam- resistant to maintain contact. The Navy would also work with the United States Air Force in an attack, with the Navy using the EA-18G as a dedicated EW platform in contested airspace, and the Air Force contributing other stealth platforms including the B-2 Spirit, Long Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B), and future stealthy unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs); those platforms have, or are planned to have, wideband stealth using geometrical features such as large size and a tailless configuration to enable them to stay undetected when confronted by VHF radars. Even with the possibility of cyber and electronic attack to hack or jam data-links, passive detection systems to locate aircraft based on their electronic emissions, and long-range anti-radiation missiles, the flexibility of \\"network-centric\\" cooperative engagement concepts allows additional systems and platforms to be \\"plugged or unplugged\\" as required, offering increased survivability and growth potential for new methods of countering countermeasures to be integrated into new or existing concepts. France France has developed its own CEC system tenue de situation multi plateformes (TSMPF) India On 15 May 2019, the Indian Navy became the second service in the world after the United States, and the first in Asia, to have developed the capability, by conducting the maiden cooperative engagement firing of the Barak 8. The firing was undertaken on the Western Seaboard by 2 Kolkata-class destroyers, INS Kochi and INS Chennai wherein the missiles of both ships were controlled by one ship to intercept different aerial targets at extended ranges. The trial was carried out by the Indian Navy, DRDO and Israel Aerospace Industries. The capability would be rolled out on all future major warships of the Indian Navy.http://pib.nic.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1572157&RegID;=3&LID;=1 The test employed the full Joint Taskforce Coordination (JTC) mode which implements the Barak 8 ‘Cooperative Engagement’ operating mode. The trial comprised two complex scenarios involving multiple platforms and several simultaneous targets. The destroyers detected multiple targets using their EL/M-2248 MF-STAR radars and launched several missiles at those targets. What was different was that only one of the ships controlled the engagement, intercepting different aerial targets at extended ranges by the missiles fired from both ships using the systems’ JTC mode. The test demonstrated the ability of MRSAM to operate wide area air defense, distributing assets and control over different platforms and locations. Previous MRSAM firing trials were conducted on a single platform, in the stand-alone mode.

Directed by Mike de Leon from a script by Clodualdo del Mundo Jr. The film is about the titular fraternity's harsh initiation of a new batch of members in 1981 as seen from the eyes of Gil's character, Sid Lucero. It was screened at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival's Directors Fortnight. Although it is a joint production of LVN Pictures, MVP Pictures, and Sampaguita Pictures, the movie was also Sampaguita's last before it closed down. Plot Sid Lucero (Mark Gil), a student at an unnamed university in the Philippines, is attracted by the prospects of joining the Alpha Kappa Omega, one of the school's most prominent Greek-letter organizations. He is considering a new direction in his life, as his mother was pushing him to take up zoology and later on to medical school. Lucero is one of the fraternity's 15 initial applicants, but only eight make it into the group's six-month initiation program with the seniors overseeing it. One neophyte is kicked out on the first day for defying the masters' orders to strip after noticing a prerecorded tape of women giggling and talking about men stripping in front of them. The fraternity leader, Vince (Jimmy Javier), orients the batch in the ways of the group before submitting them to their first hazing, which lasts all night. Over the next several months, the fraternity masters submit the neophytes to a series of tests. Pacoy Ledesma (Ward Luarca) has sex with a teacher whom a senior, Gonzalez (Vic de Leon Lima), asked him to send a bouquet to, and is made to eat his lunch food mixed with soft drinks and ketchup when Vince chances upon him at the school cafeteria. For falling behind during a test where the neophytes ran in public in their underwear and sneakers, Ding Quintos (Edwin Reyes) is forced to hold a mosquito net over Gonzalez as he sleeps all night. Ronnie Roxas Jr. (Ricky Sandico) is made to drink beer laced with his batchmates' spittle at a birthday party (and everybody else was in on it). A doctor who is an AKO member attaches surgical equipment as a pain-tolerance experiment to Lucero, whose girlfriend is concerned for his safety after losing her only brother in the frat's initiation rites two years before. The psychological pressure takes its toll on Ronnie and Arni Enriquez (Rod Leido) and both decide to leave. When Vince discovers this, he has Ronnie tied to an electric chair as part of a quiz for all the neophytes to see. Ronnie's own father (Chito Ponce Enrile) - one of the fraternity's founding members - oversees the session, where the younger Roxas will be shocked for the wrong answers. When the voltage is set higher and Ronnie Sr orders the session to continue, the neophytes are made to shock their friend even if he has to die in the process. When Pacoy sees that Ronnie is not responding to the questions, he refuses to do so and is made to replace Roxas, who suddenly wakes up. Ronnie Sr explains that everything was a set-up to help the neophytes trust their masters. Later, Arni gets angry at Sid being callous over everything and it takes the entire group to placate them; Roxas decides to stay. The neophytes are elated at Ronnie's decision and push on with their presentation for the university's annual Upakan inter-fraternity talent show, a rendition of the classic play Cabaret. Later after the show, Sid, Arni, and Arni's girlfriend, Tina (Sandy Andolong), are waylaid by members of the Sigma Omicron Sigma fraternity. Its leader – Tina's brother Abet (Mike Arvisu) – makes good on his earlier threats to stop Arni dating his sister by drowning him in front of Lucero's eyes. Eager to avenge Arni's death, Sid asks Vince to retaliate. Both fraternities break up a truce and settle everything in a street fight. Ronnie is killed on the AKO side by a Sigma Omicron fratman, who falls to a cleaver strike by Gonzalez; he then works with Sid to kill Abet but at the cost of his own life. Saddened at what AKO had become, Ronnie Sr. forgives the group. After one last hazing at a beach, the remaining neophytes – Lucero, Ledesma, Magtibay (Dodo Cabasal), Santi Santillan (Noel Trinidad), and Ding Quintos - are officially welcomed into the fraternity. A closing voice-over by Lucero reveals that he eventually becomes one of the masters overseeing another batch of neophytes.

Development Clodualdo del Mundo Jr., Raquel Villavicencio, and director Mike de Leon created the screenplay. Producer Marichu Maceda claimed her experiences on the film were based on what she felt when her own son was beaten up by his own \\"brods\\" (Filipino slang for frat members). It is often seen as an allegory on the Marcos regime's tyrannical rule. Legacy The movie left an impact as a study on the psyche of fraternities in the Philippines. The realism of the movie's initiation scenes are also referred to by Philippine media on stories of fraternity hazings. The film eventually became one of Gil's most known works. His son Tim, who was a year old at the time of the film's release, would eventually assume his character's name Sid Lucero as a stage name upon joining show business years later.  Themes and Symbolisms  The movie revolved around Sid’s character and his tumultuous journey as he tries to get in the Alpha Kappa Omega, a fraternity. The movie exposed the realities of hazing, as it was very common in the ‘80s. = Hazing = Hazing in the movie symbolizes fascism, as the members are stripped of their individual rights, while going through public humiliation and torture. This also mirrored the political regime during the reign of the Marcoses.  Release  The movie was released on September 12, 1982 in Canada after being nominated at the Toronto International Film Festival and in the USA in October of the same year. On November 18, 1982, the movie was shown nationwide in the Philippines.  Impact  Film producer Marichu Vera-Perez made the \\"antifraternity\\" movie after her son, aged 14 was beaten black and blue by his fraternity \\"brothers\\". Her friend also had a son who underwent a brain operation after being beaten up badly. At the same time, the movie resembled the political prisoners that were blindfolded, striped naked and forced to answer by their “master” where they have no choice but to obey. Awards The film was accepted for screening at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival's Director's Fortnight. It landed seven nominations at the 1983 Film Association of the Philippines Awards for Best Performance By an Actor in a Leading Role, Best Production Design, Best Editing, Best Original Score, Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Original Screenplay, eventually winning the latter two.

It is dated between 1390 and 1410. Richly decorated, it is one of the city's finest examples of Mudéjar art. History Located on the Calle Averroes in today's Faculty of Arts building, the relatively unknown chapel is one of the city's most notable monuments. With the development of the Alcázar Viejo district in 1391 and the later expulsion of the Jews from La Judería, the parish of San Bartolomé was established while a church of the same name was constructed between 1399 and 1410. The little building continued to operate as a parish church until the 17th century, possibly awaiting completion of a larger church. Restored in 1953 and 2006, the chapel is a fine example of ancient Mudéjar art. Architecture Rectangular in shape, the area is divided into two sections, one for the chapel itself, the other for a courtyard. Built of rusticated sandstone, the chapel has a rectangular floor measuring by . The chancel is slightly higher than the remainder of the building. There are two doors, one through a porch opening into a courtyard on Calle Averroes, the second, strangely locked from the outside, providing access into a side chapel which may have been connected to a sacristy in another building. The entrance from the courtyard has a pointed arch with a few simple decorations while the other entrance, also pointed, has zigzag or sawtooth decorations. Two small columns bearing Islamic decorations with scrolls and leaves support the elegantly rib- vaulted ceiling. The interior walls are richly decorated with yeseria plasterwork and tiling while the floor is also decorated with alternating tiles. The wall decorations combine depictions of plants, geometric patterns and heraldry. The coats of arms belong to the Knights of the Band, an order created by King Alfonso XI. Inscriptions are in both Kufic and Naskh scripts. Listing The chapel has been listed as a historic monument since 1931.

He is the 2011 Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) world champion bull rider.  Early life  Shane Proctor was born on March 24, 1985, in Grand Coulee, Washington.  Personal life  He currently resides in Delaware, Oklahoma, with his wife Hayley, whom he married in 2019. In his previous marriage, he was married to two-time Professional Bull Riders (PBR) world champion J.B. Mauney's sister, Jessi.  Career  Proctor competes on the PRCA circuit. He has also competed on the PBR and Championship Bull Riding (CBR) tours. He is the 2011 PRCA world champion bull rider, and has qualified for the PRCA's National Finals Rodeo (NFR) five times (2011 to 2013 and 2015 to 2016) in bull riding and the PBR World Finals nine times (2006, 2008 to 2011, 2013, and 2015 to 2017). Apart from being a bull rider, he is also a bareback and saddle bronc rider. Proctor made his debut on the PBR's elite series, the Built Ford Tough Series in 2006. In January 2010, at Madison Square Garden, in New York City, New York, Proctor rode 2008 and 2010 World Champion Bull Bones for 91.25 points. Bones scored 44.5 points, just an average score for a bull of his calibre. Proctor won the event that weekend. In April 2017, in an event in Tacoma, Washington, Proctor rode World Champion Bull Contender Pearl Harbor for 93.50 points. The bull scored 45.75, a very good score for a high calibre bull. The ride won him the 15/15 Bucking Battle. \\"Riding in my home state, it doesn’t get much better than that,” Proctor said. “Definitely probably the highlight of my career.\\" Proctor has qualified for the NFR five times. Four of those times he also had qualified for the PBR World Finals, including when he won the PRCA World Bull Riding Champion title. “That is one of the biggest things I take pride in,” Proctor said. \\"When it comes down to it, I was good in both associations, but I was never great. I would like to be a great cowboy. The guys I looked up to were Ty Murray and Cody Lambert. Guys that did the all-around.\\" On Friday, January 6, 2018, after completing his last PBR event at Madison Square Garden, Proctor announced his intention to leave the PBR in order to pursue an All-Around Cowboy title in the PRCA. Proctor has spent several years competing in both circuits, but is focusing solely on the PRCA as of January 2018. \\"Proctor has long been considered a better bronc rider than bull rider, but bull riding was something that Proctor knew would always pay the bills better for him\\": Since his PBR debut, he has earned $1.3 million. He almost won a couple years ago, but fell short by $400 in one event (you have to win at least $3,000 in two events). He also feels it is time for another roughstock athlete to win the event. The last time was when Ty Murray won the title in 1998.

Attacks Initially, Derp sent a few tweets using the Twitter account “DerpTrolling” to indicate that he were going to bring down the popular gaming website League of Legends. his first attack however, was on a game called Quake Live. Hours afterwards, many of the League of Legends game server regions in North America, Europe, and Oceania, as well as the website and Internet forums were taken down. To bring down the game servers, he used an indirect attack on Riot Games' internet service provider Internap. he revealed to have been targeting a popular livestreamer who goes by the name of PhantomL0rd on the streaming website Twitch. PhantomL0rd, whose real name is James Varga, is a 25-year-old professional gamer who regularly streams gameplays on his Twitch account and gets paid to play video games. Reddit summarized the report by saying that he had planned to use distributed denial of service attacks to flood traffic on various high-profile gaming websites associated with PhantomL0rd, including League of Legends and Blizzard Entertainment's Battle.net. According to The Escapist, the hacker also issued a threat to take down Dota 2 if PhantomL0rd were to lose his game, which the hacker carried out. However, he only crashed Phantoml0rd's game, while other games in DoTA 2 were running normally. When PhantomL0rd asked the hacker why he was attacking these sites, he responded by saying it was \\"for the lulz\\" and that it was also partially out of dislike for \\"money-hungry companies.\\" He also persuaded PhantomL0rd into playing Club Penguin while simultaneously managing to take down Electronic Arts website EA.com. PhantomL0rd's personal information was leaked during the attack and released onto multiple gaming websites, in a process often referred to as doxing. This led to many fake orders of pizza arriving at his house, as well as a police raid on his house when they received reports about a hostage situation. According to PhantomL0rd, at least six policemen searched through his house, but they only realized later that the call was fake. The hacker group claimed to have additionally attacked several other Internet games and websites including World of Tanks, the North Korean news network KCNA, RuneScape, Eve Online, a Westboro Baptist Church website, the website and online servers of Minecraft, and many others. A day after the attacks, Riot Games issued a statement confirming that their League of Legends services had indeed been attacked by the hacker, though the hacker have brought their services back online. Aftermath and reaction The news website LatinoPost criticized the attack as being \\"frivolous\\" and merely \\"just for attention,\\" unlike so-called hacktivist groups. It's considered fortunate at the time that the hackers' activities have mainly been restricted to denial of service attacks and have not been as severe as password leakage yet. VentureBeat noted that PhantomL0rd's stream was still drawing in over one hundred thousand viewers and that it is \\"still good for his traffic.\\" PlayStation LifeStyle stated that they believe the current problems with the PlayStation Network had more to do with the \\"influx of new PS4 owners and increased holiday online activity\\" than any effect or damage the hacker attempted on the network. Editor of popular gaming news website Game Informer's Mike Futter also blamed the Twitch streaming service and PhantomL0rd for not shutting the stream immediately despite having received several warnings throughout, and that this was tantamount to playing accomplices to the crime. Varga defended himself by saying that he was merely trying to maintain a business, and that if he did not comply, DerpTrolling would have targeted another streamer.

In 2011 Liza Enebeis became the studio’s third creative director. The studio is also lead by Tom Dorresteijn, Strategy Director since 2005, and Wouter Dirks, Operations Director since 2016. In 2016 the studio became part of Dept, a digital agency with over 1,100 specialists in 9 countries. Philosophy and influence Studio Dumbar describes itself as “an international branding agency specialised in visual identity and communication design” meaning that it creates every visible expression of a brand or organisation — offline and online. Its international scope is reflected in its team, with an average of seven nationalities in Rotterdam. Fragmented, sometimes complex to the edge of chaos, and layered with complex typography, many Dumbar projects in the early 1980s caused consternation among advocates of a more ordered aesthetic. But by the late 1980s many European designers were mimicking Studio Dumbar’s approach, causing Gert Dumbar to place a moratorium on these techniques within his firm.Philip B. Meggs/Alston W. Purvis, Meggs' History of Graphic Design, , p. 16 Projects and clientele The studio has a comprehensive range of clients, designing everything from experimental graphics for cultural clients to corporate identity programs and literature. Its portfolio is diverse, encompassing work for a variety of clients both large and small — from business and government to cultural and non–profit.

Retrieved 3 August 2017. History of Buddhism in Southeast Asia Until Islam became the dominant religion in Indonesia in the 13th Century, both Buddhism and Hinduism were adopted from the India subcontinent as the principal local religions. Over time, many buddhist sculptures were transported to the islands by pilgrims returning from holy sites in eastern India. These in turn inspired local craftsmen who developed their own styles and traits. The buddhist sculptures from Sambas Treasure were almost certainly made in Java based on artistic models that were developed in eastern India centuries before. Discovery and ownership The Sambas Treasure was found in a large earthenware pot on the south-west coast of Borneo sometime during the 1940s. It was then owned by the collector Tan Yeok Seong, a Singaporean historian of Southeast Asia and a collector of historical artifacts. The treasure was subsequently bought by the philanthropist PT Brooke Sewell, who donated it to the British Museum in 1956. Description The hoard is composed of nine gold and silver buddha and bodhisattva images. The largest figure is approximately 18 cm high and represents a standing Buddha made of sold silver. In addition to the Buddhist sculptures, the treasure includes a bronze incense burner in the shape of a house and a silver votive plaque with text in dhāraṇī, which was found in the base of the large Buddha figure. The high quality of the craftsmanship and the use of precious metals such as gold and silver suggest they were originally made for an important local dignitary or patron.

It had 3332 inhabitants (31 December 2013). The township also includes \\"Hessie\\" which was formerly part of Millegem and therefore Geel. Toponymy The name Ezaart derives from Esaert as it was written a long time ago. The word Esaert contains two words: es and aert. Es is an old Dutch word for shrub and aert for a lowland. There is also another explanation. It is said there once was a farmer travelling between Mol and Geel. He had a stubborn donkey which would not move anymore. The farmer got some help from local people and they pushed and pulled the donkey to get him to move. However, they pulled so strong on the animal's tail, it broke off. This incident should have taken place in front of the little chapel \\"Mary in need\\". In this opinion, Ezaart derives from the Dutch words \\"ezel\\" (= Donkey) and \\"staart\\" (= tail). A sculpture has been placed before the chapel to remember the incident, although it is most probably an urban legend.The sculpture \\"Ezelsstaart\\" Interesting locations *Ezaartmolen, a windmill built in 1856.

It is known the chapel is older. In 1696 the chapel was extended. During the French revolution, the chapel was closed. It was reused as some kind of customs and later as a school. In 1926 the chapel was donated to the \\"Saint Peter and Paul-church\\" in Mol. In 1996 the chapel was renovated. It is now used for cultural performances.

He has been a speaker at many of the major universities in Europe and the United States. A specialist in nineteenth and twentieth century Spanish literature he has published numerous books on Spanish Romanticism, with interpretive contributions and unpublished texts. He has edited the most faithful edition of the complete works of authors such as José de Espronceda and the Duque de Rivas. He has also written about Lista and Quintana and the work of Spanish progressive liberals from the early nineteenth century to the end of the period of Romanticism. He has studied the poetic thought of Juan Ramón, Octavio Paz and José Bergamin. He has also dedicated numerous studies to the works of Cervantes. He has studied the narrative of Álvaro Cunqueiro, Juan Benet, Azorín and has published the first annotated edition of El Ruedo Ibérico of Valle-Inclán. His concept of literary methodology stems from a new, non- Marxist approach to the binomial ideology and literature. His concept of poetic works is based on what he has called the aesthetic of simplicity: he seeks the emotion of the reader with a simple yet refined style, full of lyricism and thought, which transparently offers an almost philosophical worldview, on topics such as love, the issue most frequently addressed in his work, death and the concept of art itself, poetic creation and beauty. In his recent novel Éxito (Success) he offers a testimony to the vision of his generation from the beginning of counter-culture to the present day. Major Spanish writers have provided forwards for his creative works, which have been included in several Spanish and American anthologies. His poetic works have been translated into Italian and his narrative to English.

The Falcon and the Co-eds was the seventh of 16 in the Falcon series. The story and screenplay was by Ardel Wray, a frequent collaborator with Val Lewton in his RKO horror series, who added supernatural elements to the proceedings.Bansak 2003, p. 146. As he had in the past three Falcon films, Tom Conway played the suave amateur sleuth, this time backed up by a bevy of young starlets, including Jean Brooks, Rita Corday and Amelita Ward.Jewell and Harbin 1982, p. 189. Plot Jane Harris (Amelita Ward), a student at the Bluecliff Seminary for Girls, asks Tom Lawrence (Tom Conway), aka the Falcon, for his help to investigate a death predicted by her unstable roommate, Marguerita Serena (Rita Corday), a clairvoyant. Professor Jamison has recently died. Was it suicide or homicide? Posing as an insurance investigator, the Falcon meets the Dean, Miss Keyes (Barbara Brown); the school's Psychology teacher, Dr. Anatole Graelich (George Givot); the Drama teacher, Vicky Gaines (Jean Brooks); and the Music teacher, Mary Phoebus (Isabel Jewell). Inspector Donovan (Cliff Clark) and Detective Bates (Edward Gargan) are also looking at the local Coroner's verdict of suicide. Tom begins his investigation at the dead professor's room, and then goes to the undertaker's (Ian Wolfe), where he finds out it is assumed Professor Jamison committed suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills. Believing the death was a murder, a group of suspects are carefully watched, including Marguerita, who thinks she has inherited her father's insanity, and a love triangle involving Graelich, Mary and Vicky, all with a motive to kill. Before Tom can confront the killer, Dean Keyes is murdered; and, when Marguerita tells Mary that she saw her standing over the dead body of Miss Keyes, Mary tries to force the hysterical girl to jump from the cliffs by the school. Tom races to the cliffs and startles Mary, who topples over the cliffs to her death. She had been behind all the murders, starting with Jamison who was killed in a jealous rage, and the Dean, who would have dismissed Graelich, whom Mary had married in secret, as married couples could not work at the school. When Jane's mother, a famous actress, arrives at the school with another actress, she asks the Falcon to solve a murder at the theater.

The growing popularity of the Falcon series led to filming two films nearly back-to-back, with the previous film in the series, The Falcon In Danger, which was in production, April 13 to early-May 1943.\\"Original print information: 'The Falcon Strikes Back'.\\" Turner Classic Movies.

Retrieved: September 5, 2016. Reception Film historians Richard Jewell and Vernon Harbin described The Falcon and the Co-eds as handicapped by a \\"twisting and turning narrative\\" that revealed a \\"sloppiness\\". In a recent review for the Time Out Film Guide, Tom Milne wrote, \\"Despite the off-putting title, an attractive little thriller in which the Falcon investigates murder in a girls' school, where an atmosphere of fear and loathing centres on a girl with second sight, while she herself is driven to suicidal despair by her predictions of murder. Scripted by Ardel Wray, who worked regularly with Val Lewton (I Walked with a Zombie, The Leopard Man, Isle of the Dead), it is beautifully characterized and has some vividly eerie touches (better exploited in Roy Hunt's camerawork than by Clemens' direction).

The charity was founded in 2003 by Dr Sri Ram PhD FRSA and Mrs Rajni Sriram FRSA and currently runs successful schools programmes in India, Malawi and the UK. In both India and Malawi, Wings of Hope supports poor and underprivileged children by providing them with a free education. In the UK, the charity runs a national schools competition, ‘The Wings of Hope Achievement Awards’ (WOHAA). Wings of Hope is not affiliated with any political or religious associations. * Founders: Dr Sri Ram PhD FRSA and Mrs Rajni Sriram FRSA * Type: International children’s education charity * Charity Registration Number: 109968 * Year founded:2003 * Headquarters: London * Origins: London * Area serves: UK, India and Malawi * Mission statement: ‘to Empower through Education’ * Website: http://www.thewingsofhope.org/ Campaigns=India= Wings of Hope supports a school in Nemilicherry (Chrompet Township) in Chennai, southern India. The school offers education to around 360 students aged 4–16 years. The school is supported by 17 dedicated teachers who conduct lessons in Mathematics, Science and Social Sciences in English, Tamil and Hindi. A great emphasis is placed on value-based education and the school ethos adheres to the motto – ‘the end of education is character’. Many of the students from the Wings of Hope School have achieved great academic success, with several having been awarded top marks in national exams. Many of the students have also competed on a national level in science, yoga and computer sciences competitions. The annual winners of the Wings of Hope ‘WOHAA’ competition go on an all-expenses paid trip to visit this school at the end of their fundraising programme. =Malawi= The Wings of Hope ‘House of Hope’ in Malawi supports 600 young people between the ages of 3 and 20. Many of these have been orphaned as a result of the country’s HIV/AIDS epidemic. The aim of the centre is to help vulnerable young people to develop a sustainable higher quality of life within their community. As is such, the House of Hope focuses on the physical, emotional and spiritual, as well as the intellectual, needs of its students. Children are encouraged to attend school with the provision of a hot meal every day. The House of Hope runs a ‘School Support Programme’ allowing students to work towards the equivalent of their GCSEs and A-levels. The aim of this programme is to give students the opportunity to go on and undertake further education. The centre also offers nursery school facilities for children aged between 3 and 5 years and provides extensive after school care. Here, students can receive help with homework, as well as participating in extra-curricular activities. In addition to this, the House of Hope engages adults from the community in a literacy skills programme, as well as offering them tuition in practical skills such as sewing. Many of these adults are the older siblings or guardians of the orphans attending the centre. =The UK – WOHAA= The Wings of Hope runs a national schools competition and fundraising awards scheme called ‘The Wings of Hope Achievement Awards’ (WOHAA). WOHAA is open to all students in the UK in school years 9 to 13. To date over 475 schools and 16,000 students from across the UK have taken part in the competition, which began in 2003. The competition runs annually. =How WOHAA works= The competition works by students getting together in teams of up to 6 to design and carry out a Wings of Hope fundraising programme. The team decides how they want to fundraise – creativity and innovation are encouraged. Throughout the course of the competition the teams have access to online resources, are mentored by the Wings of Hope team and receive invitations to attend ‘industry skills workshops’ hosted by Wings of Hope’s corporate partners. At the end of the fundraising programme the teams submit a Snapshot Project to Wings of Hope, explaining what they did, how they did it and what they learned along the way. The best teams are invited to present their projects to a panel of famous judges at the semi-finals stage, held at the House of Lords. The winners are announced at the WOHAA Annual Awards Ceremony=Winners and prizes= Teams are judged according to 6 winning categories. They are: ‘Most Innovative’, ‘Best House of Lords Presentation’, ‘Most Awareness Raised’, ‘Most Funds Raised’, ‘Best Speak Out (community) Project’ and ‘Overall Winning Team’. All members of the winning teams gain work experience placements with Wings of Hope’s corporate partners. The ‘Overall Winning Team’ is awarded an all expenses paid trip to India, to visit the Wings of Hope school project. =Aims of WOHAA= WOHAA allows students to compete on a national level, in a well-established and reputable schools competition. Supported by a network of WOHAA mentors, the programme helps students to develop outside of the boundaries of the national curriculum, improving key transferable skills in areas such as communication, leadership, teamwork, time management and entrepreneurship. WOHAA also offers students the opportunity to undertake valuable work experience in financial and project planning, fundraising, presenting/public speaking, sales & marketing, digital marketing, advertising, press & PR, journalism, events management, art, photography and creative media. On completion of WOHAA participants gain official certification and can also use the programme as an addition to CVs and UCAS applications. It also fulfills the ‘Volunteering’ aspect of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award. With access to a range of corporate partners and top professionals in a variety of job sectors, WOHAA aims to help students in the UK leave school better prepared for employment, as a way of tackling current youth unemployment issues. =WOHAA workshops= Working in conjunction with corporate partners including Edelman (PR), Tata Consultancy Services (IT Services and Business Solutions) and Barclays (Finance) Wings of Hope runs industry skills workshops open to all WOHAA participants. They are often held at the partners’ offices and hosted by top professionals from within the company. Format and content varies, but in the past students have been given an insight into the relevant job sector, information about working for the specific partner organisation and skills/CV writing/interview tips. WOHAA also runs an annual Speed Mentoring event – a unique careers event bringing top professionals from over 50 different industries to meet with WOHAA participants. The event works in the same way as speed-dating – with students getting ten minutes at an ‘industry table’ to find out as much as they can and everything that they have ever wanted to know about a specific career before moving onto their next choice. The professional mentors come from top law firms, banks, academic institutions, government, media companies, the music industry, medical service providers and many more exciting sectors.

The Belgian army sorties from Antwerp against German troops to the south. The Belgians planned to exploit German troop movements away from Antwerp and to assist the French army on the Marne. King Albert I the Belgian Commander in Chief, saw that the Germans had strengthened most of their positions south of Antwerp and reduced the attack to an operation against , which had advanced from Brussels towards Dendermonde. The attack was made by the 4th and 5th divisions of the field army. The 4th Division advanced from Grembergen and Hamme, as the 2nd and 5th regiments of the 5th Division attacked on the left flank from Bornem and Puurs. The Cavalry Division attacked Aalst from the west but the Belgian sortie was suspended after German artillery began a bombardment of the forts of the National redoubt of Belgium (, ) around Antwerp, preparatory to its own attack. Background The railway network in Belgium had many facilities for the movement of supplies and troops and after the sortie of the Belgian High Command planned to destroy the communications at several points. Seven volunteer detachments of a hundred cyclists each were formed and sent through the German lines to conduct railway demolitions. The cyclist detachments left Antwerp on 22 September, slipped through the lines and cut the principal lines in Limburg, Brabant and Hainault. Most detachments were able to return to Antwerp but some were discovered, surrounded, killed or taken prisoner and the Germans inflicted reprisals on civilians living nearby. Ten motorcyclists unpinned the rails between Bilzen and Tongeren; two hours later, a German troop train was derailed. Germans troops entered Bilzen, shot eight civilians and set fire to part of the village. Another cycle column was surprised by the Germans in the act of blowing up the line at Tubize; a few Belgians escaped and took refuge in a neighbouring village. Shortly afterwards the bodies of two civilians were found near the scene of the skirmish and several houses were seen to have been burnt down. A German proclamation was issued on 25 September by the Governor- General, Prelude Grand Quartier Général (GQG) the French army general headquarters, requested that the Belgians undertake a substantial new attack on German communications. It was believed to be possible, because the German forces before Antwerp had been reduced to send reinforcements to France. The Belgian general staff selected a region to the west of Brussels for a raid. The Cavalry Division was sent by rail to Ghent, ready to move on Aalst, while the main army in the fourth sector was to march southwards. During the preliminary movements for the sortie, the Belgians found that the German force before Antwerp had been reinforced. The sortie was cancelled, except for a slight westerly movement of the main body of the army and an attack on 37 near Dendermonde. On 26 September, the 4th Division was to advance on Dendermonde and carry out a frontal attack. The 5th Division was to attack the German right flank and the Cavalry Division was to attack on the left flank. Action On 26 September, the Germans withdrew from the ruins of Dendermonde on the approach of the 4th Division, which advanced through the town along both banks of the Dender and engaged at Sint-Gillis-bij-Dendermonde, Oudegem and Wieze. The 5th Division advanced cautiously to cover its left flank and engaged the Germans with small detachments. Two battalions tried to cut off the retreat of the brigade by an advance from Buggenhout on Lebbeke, which was occupied as night fell. The Cavalry Division pushed back German detachments guarding the passages of the Dender at Aalst, where the Belgians and Germans engaged each other on opposite banks. Groups of Belgian cavalry pushed on to Asse but escaped the encirclement by skirting Lebbeke on the west in the dusk to reached Opwijk by back roads, where they rejoined the main body early on 27 September. The front line was separated by the Dender, which flows through Aalst. An old weaver carrying a pail of water across the street in Aalst was bayoneted. In Binnen Straat, houses were set on fire and two men killed. In the Eue des Trois Clefs about forty civilians were dragged from their homes, stripped of their valuables and money and then driven to the river Dender and used as human shields. A Belgian officer in command of a machine-gun commanding the drawbridge signalled to the civilians to throw themselves on the ground and the Belgians fired, forcing the Germans to retreat, who then killed eight or nine civilian prisoners. In the Eue des Trois Clefs, Eue Lenders and Eue de 1'Argents, houses were burnt down and some people who tried to escape from the houses were cut down, being killed. A German column of left Aalst for the village of Erpe with set fire to the houses and killed five or six civilians who tried to escape. A Belgian car with a machine-gun appeared and the Germans placed the hostages from Aalst on the road where two were wounded by Belgian machine-gun fire. At about the same time fighting took place in Campine between the Germans and the 4th Volunteer Regiment, which was composed of recruits. The regiment occupied the camp of Leopoldsburg (Beverloo) and cleared the countryside of German scouting parties. The presence of the volunteers in the Limburg district caused much local disruption to the Germans and on 20 September there was an engagement at Schaffen-lez-Diest between four companies of volunteers and Germans troops. The recruits resisted German attacks for nearly three hours and retreated when the Germans began to envelop their right flank. Another skirmish occurred at Lummen, where over fifty houses were fired by the Germans. A company of volunteers held the bridge over the canal at Beeringen, against much larger forces advancing from the direction of Heusden and Pael. All volunteer companies were sent as reinforcements during the night to Heppen, Beverloo, Beringen, Oostham and Tessenderloo. At on 27 September, German artillery began to bombard Beringen, as the Belgian volunteers remained concealed in trenches by the canal. The Germans tried to cross the canal by the bridge, which the Belgians had not been able to destroy. Firing from cover the Belgian infantry repulsed the attack but outnumbered Belgians retired from Beringen at through woodland to the Baelen road, where Beringen, Heppen and Oostham were seen to be on fire. Soon afterwards, the Germans entered Leopoldsburg and set fire to some buildings, while the volunteer company escaped through the woods. At the Belgians reached Mol as German troops approached Geel and Meerhout. A group of volunteers occupied the Mol railway station and put outposts by the canal. A German attack began and many civilians were killed in the fighting before the Germans fell back. A group of volunteers then pushed on to Bothy to find that houses in the Grand Place had been sacked and burnt down. Another body of volunteers went to Herenthals and the Belgians returned to Mol the next day, intending to recapture the camp at Leopoldsburg but urgent orders from Headquarters forced them to retire. During the night a Belgian officer drove to Herentals to blow up the railway line. On 28 September, the siege of Antwerp began with the bombardment of forts Waelhem and Sint-Katelijne-Waver, after which Belgian operations in the Limburg district ended.

Hemichromes, which precede the denaturation processes of haemoglobin (Hb), are mainly produced by partially denaturated haemoglobins and form histidine complexes. Hemichromes are usually associated with blood disorders.  Types of hemichromes  Hemichromes can be classified in two main categories: reversible and irreversible. Reversible hemichromes (Hch-1) have the ability to return to their native formation (haemoglobin). Some hemichromes can be reduced to the high-spin state of deoxyhaemoglobin, while others are first being reduced to hemochromes (FeII) and then to deoxyhaemoglobin through anaerobic dialysis. Photolysis, in the presence of oxygen from CO and its reaction with the hemochrome, can quickly convert a hemichrome to oxyhaemoglobin (HbO2).Molchanova, T. http://www.tatianamolchanova.com/files/Hemichrome_alphaHb_AHSP_Molchanova.pdf Irreversible hemichromes (Hch-2) cannot be converted to their native form. Both the reversible and irreversible hemichromes have a similar rate during proteolytic degradation and they both have a lower percentage of alpha helixes.  Hemichrome in bloodstains  Upon blood exiting the body, haemoglobin in blood transits from bright red to dark brown, which is attributed to oxidation of oxy-hemoglobin (HbO2) to methemoglobin (met-Hb) and ending up in hemichrome (HC). For forensic purposes, the fractions of HbO2, met-Hb and HC in a bloodstain can be used for age determination of bloodstains when measured with Reflectance Spectroscopy .  Hemichrome stability  Hemichromes form an insoluble macromolecule (macromolecular aggregate) by copolymerization with the cytoplasm of band 3. Covalent bonds reinforce the aggregate interactions of the hemichromes which are accumulated on the surface of the membrane. However, hemichromes are less stable than their native form.  Normal formation  Hemoglobin A in humans can form hemichromes even under physiological conditions as a result of pH and temperature alterations, and the autoxidation of oxyhaemoglobin. Hemichrome formation, followed by a band 3 clustering and the formation of Heinz bodies, can take place during the physiological clearance of damaged red blood cells. The difference between a normal red blood cell (RBC) and a red blood cell with unstable haemoglobin (such as in the case of haemolytic anaemia) is that, in a normal RBC, the formation of Heinz bodies is significantly delayed. In cells with unstable haemoglobin, hemichromes are formed soon after the cell has been released into the bloodstream and they precipitate on the membrane's surface.  Abnormal formation  When haemoglobin is exposed to certain conditions, reversible or irreversible hemichromes are formed. Reversible hemichrome formation occurs in the presence of: * Fatty acids * Aliphatic alcohol (n-butanol) * Dehydration * High concentration of glycerol * Polyethylene glycol Irreversible hemichrome formation occurs in the presence of: * Phenylhydrazine * Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)  References  Category:Hemoproteins Category:Cellular respiration ","title":"Hemichrome"},{"id":"41510899","text":"Bargarh (Sl.

The club was founded in 1904 and was initially managed by James Ramster who only took charge of the team for friendly matches. Ambrose Langley, a former Sheffield Wednesday player managed Hull for over 300 games from 1905 to 1913. Harry Chapman, Fred Stringer, David Menzies and Percy Lewis held short tenures as manager before Billy McCracken led the club from 1923 to 1931, overseeing 375 matches. Haydn Green took charge for almost three seasons, leaving the club in 1934 with a win percentage just shy of 50%. Raich Carter became the next Hull City manager to lead the club for over 100 competitive matches, holding the tenure from March 1948 to September 1951. Five managers, Bob Jackson, Bob Brocklebank, Cliff Britton, Terry Neill and John Kaye, then led the club over the next 25 years. Mike Smith and Brian Horton also managed the club for over 100 games, while Terry Dolan took charge for over 300 matches in the 1990s. Dane Jan Mølby became the first manager from outside the United Kingdom when he took over in April 2002. His tenure was to be short-lived, he was replaced on a full-time basis after just 17 competitive matches in charge by Peter Taylor. Phil Brown became the first Hull City manager to lead the club to the top division of English football in 2008 after winning the Football League Championship play-off Finals 1-0 against Bristol City at Wembley Stadium. After a poor run of results, Brown was placed on \\"garden leave\\" to be replaced by Iain Dowie in an attempt to keep Hull City in the Premier League, an effort which ended in relegation with Dowie only overseeing a solitary win in his nine games in charge. Nigel Pearson was appointed to stabilise the team following relegation to the Championship, he held the role for 15 months until he was enticed to return to Leicester City, the club he had left to join Hull City. Hull City player Nick Barmby took over, initially in a caretaker role, in November 2011, but was released from his duties the following May, to be replaced by Steve Bruce. On 22 July 2016 the BBC reported that manager Steve Bruce had resigned from his position. This was later confirmed by the club who announced Mike Phelan would act as caretaker manager. On 13 October 2016, Phelan became the head coach. He was sacked on 3 January 2017. On 5 January 2017, the club announced the appointment of Marco Silva as the new head coach until the end of the 2016–17 season. On 25 May 2017, following relegation from the Premier League head coach Marco Silva resigned. On 9 June 2017, the club announced the appointment of Leonid Slutsky as head coach. On 3 December 2017, Leonid Slutsky left the club by mutual consent after a run of bad results. On 7 December 2017, Nigel Adkins was appointed as head coach on an 18-month contract. On 8 June 2019, manager Atkins indicated that he would not take-up the offer of a new contact with the club and left the club before the start of the 2019–20 season.

He was a member of the South Australian House of Assembly from 1884 to 1905, representing the electorates of Gumeracha (1884-1902) and Murray (1902-1905). He was Leader of the Opposition from 1901 to 1902 and Attorney-General of South Australia from 1890 to 1892, 1892 to 1893 and 1904 to 1905. His sons Hermann Homburg and Robert Homburg Jr. also served in the House of Assembly, with Hermann also being a long-serving minister. Homburg was born in Brunswick, Duchy of Brunswick, Germany, the son of Wilhelm Homburg (died 1860), a grain merchant, and his wife Caroline Magdalene Pauline. Homburg arrived in South Australia in the year 1857. He was employed in a land agency business until 1868, when he was articled to James Boucaut. The last two years of his articles were served in the office of Sir John Downer, and he was admitted to the bar in April 1874. Homburg was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly as a representative for Gumeracha in April 1884, and at the election of 1887 was re-elected with the Sir Robert Dalrymple Ross. In April 1890 he was again returned with Theodore Hack. In 1880 for a short period he was president of the German Club. He was appointed Attorney-General in Thomas Playford's second Ministry in August 1890, and held office till June 1892, when he retired with his colleagues. Homburg was again Attorney-General from 15 October 1892 to 16 June 1893 and from 4 July 1904 to 24 February 1905 (also being Minister of Education in the latter term). Homburg held the seat of Gumeracha until its abolition at the 1902 election. Homburg served as the tenth Leader of the Opposition from 1901 to 1902. Homburg represented the Assembly for Murray from 1902 until the 1905 election. Homburg was appointed a justice of the Supreme Court of South Australia in 1905. He died in Medindie, Adelaide on 23 March 1912; he was survived by a total of four sons and four daughters from his two marriages.

It is a fast-growing pioneer plant, a typical fynbos component, and may be found on dunes, rocky places, along forest margins, beside streams, and in open grassland. It belongs to the milkwort family of Polygalaceae. The thin, oval, mucronate leaves, 25–50 mm long and up to 13 mm wide, are arranged alternately and have entire margins – some forms of P. myrtifolia have thin, needle-like leaves. The attractive mauve sweetpea-like flowers, which close at night, may also be pink, crimson or white, and have a characteristic brush- like tuft protruding from the keel. For pollination an intricate piston mechanism is used. The fruit is an oval, brown, dehiscent capsule which is narrowly winged. The species is often cultivated in South African gardens. The genus of Polygala comprises some 659 species with a wide distribution in the tropics and temperate zones. 'Polygala' is interpreted as 'much milk' since the plant was thought to stimulate milk production in European cows – 'myrtifolia' translates as 'myrtle-shaped leaves'. The species is noted for its antibacterial and antifungal properties. Research conducted by the University of KwaZulu Natal found that aqueous extracts of P. myrtifolia proved effective against Candida albicans. Environmental impact P. myrtifolia has become naturalised in coastal areas of California, New Zealand and Norfolk Island. In Australia, it is a significant environmental weed in coastal districts of Victoria and South Australia, and a moderately important environmental weed in New South Wales, Tasmania and Western Australia. In the 2010s, it was recently listed as a priority environmental weed in parts of Queensland.

The molecular ratio of tin in silicon can vary based on the fabrication methods or doping conditions. In general, SiSn is known to be intrinsically semiconducting, and even small amounts of Sn doping in silicon can also be used to create strain in the silicon lattice and alter the charge transport properties. Theoretical studies Several theoretical works have shown SiSn to be semiconducting. These mainly include DFT-based studies. The band structures obtained using these works show a change in band gap of silicon with the inclusion of tin into the silicon lattice. Thus, like SiGe, SiSn has a variable band gap that can be controlled using Sn concentration as a variable. In 2015, Hussain et al. experimentally verified the tuning of band gap associated with the diffusion of tin using homogenous, abrupt p-n junction diodes. Production SiSn can be obtained experimentally using several approaches. For small quantity of Sn in silicon, the Czochralski process is well known. Diffusion of tin into silicon has also been tried extensively in the past. Sn has the same valency and electronegativity as silicon and can be found in the diamond cubic crystal structure (α-Sn). Thus, silicon and tin meet three out of the four Hume-Rothery rules for solid state solubility. The one criterion that is not met is that of difference in atomic size. The tin atom is substantially larger than the silicon atom (31.8%). This reduces the solid state solubility of tin in silicon. Electrical performance The first MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor) using SiSn as a channel material was shown in 2013. This study proved that SiSn can be used as semiconductor for MOSFET fabrication, and that there may be certain applications where the use of SiSn instead of silicon may be more advantageous. In particular, the off current of SiSn transistors is much lower than that of silicon transistors. Thus, logic circuits based on SiSn MOSFETs consume lower static power compared to silicon-based circuits. This is advantageous in battery operated devices (LSTP devices), where the standby power has to be reduced for longer battery life. Thermal conductivity Si- Sn alloys have the lowest conductivity (3 W/mK) of all the bulk alloys among Si-Ge, Ge-Sn, and Si-Ge-Sn; less than half that of Si-Ge which has been extensively studied, attributed to the larger difference in mass between the two constituents. In addition, thin films offer an additional reduction in thermal conductivity, reaching around 1 W/mK in 20-nm-thick Si-Sn, Ge-Sn, and ternary Si-Ge-Sn films, which is near the conductivity of amorphous SiO2. Group-IV alloys containing Sn have the potential for high-efficiency thermoelectric energy conversion.

Biography Zvegintzov was born in Russia into an aristocratic family, the son of Colonel Dimitry Ivanovitch Zvegintzov (1880–1967) and Princess Maria Obolensky (1882–1947), the daughter of Ivan Mikhailovich Obolensky. During the Russian Revolution of 1917, his family moved to England, fearing the repercussions of the Bolshevik takeover. He was subsequently educated at Bloxham School, where he was nicknamed \\"Zog\\", and served as drum major in the Officers' Training Corps band, with the rank of Cadet Serjeant. On 17 September 1931, Zvegintzov, then working a clerk and living in Barons Court, London, became a naturalised British subject, having been granted a Certificate of Naturalization, and sworn the Oath of Allegiance. He joined the Supplementary Reserve of Officers in May 1933, and 1 February 1935 was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Border Regiment, receiving promotion to lieutenant on 1 February 1938. He saw service during the Second World War, being promoted to captain on 1 February 1943, and having the war substantive rank of major by the end of the conflict. He remained in the army post-war, being promoted to major on 25 January 1947. and was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 1 January 1949. On 1 July 1952 he was brevetted as a lieutenant-colonel, eventually being promoted to that rank on 5 April 1955. He was promoted again, to colonel, on 12 September 1957, and to brigadier on 12 September 1961. Zvegintzov was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 1 January 1963, and eventually retired from the army on 2 February 1965. In April 1968 he was made an Officer of the Order of Saint John. Zvegintzov died in 23 April 1984 at his home in Glasbury on Wye, Wales.

Motor sports are widely popular in the United States, but Americans generally ignore major international series, such as Formula One and MotoGP, in favor of home-grown racing series. History Americans, like the rest of the world, initially began using public streets as a host of automobile races. As time progressed it was soon discovered that these venues were often unsafe to the public as they offered relatively little crowd control. Promoters and drivers in the United States discovered that horse racing tracks could provide better conditions for drivers and spectators than public streets. In the 1910s, board track racing became widely popular. Based on the concept of the velodrome used in bicycle racing, board tracks were relatively inexpensive but could accommodate far faster speeds than dirt tracks. The drawbacks of board tracks soon became apparent: the tracks were difficult to maintain and, being constructed of wood, highly flammable; most closed or burned down within a few years of opening, with the phenomenon as a whole largely abandoned by the end of the 1920s. Many of the principles that board tracks used, including the elliptical banked tracks with smooth surfaces, were later adapted into oval track racing, first by the contemporary brickyard surface pioneered by Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1909, then on asphalt surfaces, which provided many of the benefits of board tracks without the flammability or durability problems. The result has been long standing popularity for oval track racing while road racing has waned; however, an extensive illegal street racing culture persists.SpeedTV.com My Take on Open Wheel Racing In America Accessed 2008-07-22 Indianapolis 500 Indianapolis Motor Speedway is among the world's premier racing facilities. Historically, open wheel racing was the most popular nationwide, with the Indianapolis 500 being the most widely followed race. However, an acrimonious split in 1994 between the primary series, CART (later known as Champ Car), and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (the site of the Indy 500) led to the formation of the Indy Racing League, now known as INDYCAR, which launched the rival IndyCar Series in 1996. From that point, the popularity of open wheel racing in the U.S. declined dramatically. The feud was settled in 2008 with an agreement to merge the two series under the IndyCar banner, but enormous damage had already been done to the sport. Notable IndyCar drivers include A. J. Foyt, Rick Mears, Mario Andretti, Michael Andretti, Al Unser, Al Unser, Jr., Bobby Unser, Dario Franchitti and Scott Dixon. Since reunification, the Indycar series and especially the Indianapolis 500 have enjoyed a resurgence. The 100th running of the Indianapolis 500 in 2016 (races were not held during the years of 1917-1918 and 1942-1945 due to world wars) featured the largest crowd in more than two decades, and local Indianapolis media suspended their longstanding television \\"blackout\\" during the race due to a sold out crowd. https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/motor/2016/05/25/ims-lift- indy-500-blackout/84898908/ Californian rookie and ex-Formula 1 driver Alexander Rossi won the 2016 Indy 500 on fuel mileage https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/motor-sports/rookie-alexander-rossi- pulls-upset-win-100th-indianapolis-500and subsequently became an IndyCar mainstay at Andretti Autosport. https://www.roadandtrack.com/motorsports/news/a31029/alexander-rossi- indycar-2017/ Subsequent races have featured victories by Takuma Sato (2017), Will Power (2018), and Simon Pagenaud (2019). Longtime team owner and billionaire https://www.forbes.com/profile/roger-penske/#5c61dfa7d90fRoger Penske purchased Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the IndyCar series, and IMS Productions in November 2019. https://apnews.com/b89897dd6fb945bb95abb11e7f2a6918 NASCAR The start of the 2015 Daytona 500, the biggest race in NASCAR The CART-IRL feud coincided with an enormous expansion of stock car racing, governed by NASCAR, from its past as a mostly regional circuit mainly followed in the Southern U.S. to a truly national sport. NASCAR's Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series generally harnesses an 8 million person audience on television, as well as sold-out crowds at many tracks. In the last few years however, attendance and television ratings are down considerably. Many fans stated increasing costs of attending (tickets, hotels) and recent rule changes as reasons why they stopped attending or watching NASCAR races. The most prestigious NASCAR race is the Daytona 500 at the beginning of the season in February. Popular NASCAR drivers include Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson, Tony Stewart, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Kyle Busch, and Alex Bowman. NASCAR is also the most popular Motorsport in the U.S. Formula One Although the world's most popular form of motorsport, Formula One, is not as popular in the U.S., it has been conducted in the US at several venues including Sebring, Riverside, Watkins Glen, Phoenix, Long Beach and the Indianapolis Grand Prix. It was hosted in Austin, Texas, in November 2012. The race was run at a new venue (which now also hosts MotoGP) named Circuit of the Americas. The 2012 event was the first United States Grand Prix held since 2007. A second race, called the Grand Prix of America, was to take place in Weehawken, New Jersey, designed to give a view of the New York City skyline. The race was planned for the 2013 season, but was delayed and the idea was abandoned. The United States also has two former Driver's World Champions: Phil Hill (1961) and Mario Andretti (1978). The last American to compete in F1 is Alexander Rossi in 2015. The U.S. has its own F1 team, Haas F1 Team, created in 2016 with drivers Romain Grosjean and Esteban Gutiérrez, and starting in 2017, Kevin Magnussen raced with the team, replacing Gutiérrez. In 2019, British energy drink brand Rich Energy sponsored the team, turning the name into \\"Rich Energy Haas F1 Team\\". However, later in the season the relationship soured after Rich Energy's now-infamous tweet about Haas' performance in the 2019 French Grand Prix went viral. The team officially split with Rich Energy after the 2019 Italian Grand Prix.https://www.thedrive.com/accelerator/24506/haas-f1-signs-soft-drink- startup-rich-energy-as-2019-title-sponsor Motorcycle Although international street motorcycle racing does not enjoy the mainstream popularity of its all-terrain cousin, motocross, in the U.S., American riders have been very successful. Seven Americans have won a combined fifteen championships in MotoGP. Eddie Lawson has won four championships (more than any other American). Five American riders have won eight Superbike World Championships. Endurance racing Another form of auto-racing in the United States is sports car racing. While not as popular as other forms of racing in the country, both the American Le Mans Series and the Rolex Sports Car Series operated as the premier series, now called WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, of sports car endurance racing in the U.S. The former, known informally as the ALMS and sanctioned by IMSA, is based on the rules that govern the world famous 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race in France. As such, there is a typical European flair in the races and the cars that participate. The Rolex series, sanctioned by Grand-Am, has rules similar to the ALMS, but the cars themselves are ultimately different and are made with a more cost-efficient formula in mind. Among the better known sports car races in America are the 12 Hours of Sebring, 24 Hours of Daytona, and Petit Le Mans. All three races have been featured as rounds in world championships in previous years with Sebring slated to open the 2012 season of the FIA World Endurance Championship. Other motor sports Another one of the most popular forms of motorsports in the United States is the indigenous sport of drag racing. The largest drag racing organization, the National Hot Rod Association, boasts 80,000 members, more than 35,000 licensed competitors and nationwide television coverage.Inside the NHRA: NHRA: World's largest auto racing organization Other indigenous motorsports also enjoy major and widespread popularity. Monster truck demonstrations have a national and regional following; Monster Jam, the widest-known monster truck circuit in the United States, regularly sells out large stadiums on its national tours. Demolition derby, in which vehicles attempt to damage each other until one is left running, is primarily a local phenomenon. Figure 8 racing is a form of banger racing in which vehicles attempt to navigate a purposely intersecting track. Sprint car races feature small, specially designed vehicles with characteristic wings on top; several regional circuits exist for the sport. Dirt track racing, as opposed to most major racing circuits that use asphalt-paved tracks, enjoys local popularity. Several regional circuits also sanction competitions in tractor pulling. Mud bogging, in which trucks attempt to pass through a muddy pit, has popularity in rural areas. The Australia-based Supercars Championship, which uses cars roughly similar in appearance to NASCAR stock cars but runs exclusively on road courses and street circuits, expanded to the U.S. in 2013 with an event at the Circuit of the Americas, but that proved to be its only U.S. race to date.

The Bayer designation ο (omicron) has been variously applied to two or three of the stars 30, 31, and 32 Cygni. 31 Cygni has been designated, variously, as ο1 or ο2 Cygni -- therefore for clarity, it is preferred to use the Flamsteed designation 31 Cygni. It is an Algol-type eclipsing binary and ranges between magnitudes 3.73 and 3.89 over a period of ten years. The component stars are an orange supergiant of spectral type K4Iab and a blue- white star likely to be evolving off the main sequence with a spectral type of B4IV-V. The eclipsing system has been studied in attempts to determine an accurate direct mass for a red supergiant. The value is believed to be accurate to about 2%, but there are some discrepancies in the orbital fit. 30 Cygni is another naked eye star a tenth of a degree away, forming a bright triple. 32 Cygni is about a degree away to the north, also a detached eclipsing binary system.

Brownmuir or Brimmer Hill at feet is a prominent eminence in the parish and it overlooks the area with Lochlands Hill and Cuff Hill relatively nearby. The old estate of Threepwood lay to the east. The History of the Lands of Brownmuir The lands of Brownmuir lay in the Regality of Kilwinning and Bailiary of Cunninghame. The boundary to the west was with the Lands of Threepwood. A substantial laird's style dwelling is not indicated on the available 18th century maps of the area. =Brownmuir= The radio shack and aerial on Brimmer Hill. The name 'Brownmuir' or 'Brimmer'Paterson, Page 115 may derive from the appropriately descriptive terms 'brown' and 'moor'. The present day Brownmuir Farm is located on a lane that runs between Threepwood Road and the Boydstone and Knowes Roads. A drove road once ran from near Brownmuir Farm passed Rakerfield Farm to join the existing road near Newmills. In 1856 a lint mill was located on the Muir Burn near Brownmuir Farm with a wooden footbridge and two dams on the watercourse. The mill was linked to the Boydston Road by a short lane. This mill was upstream of Mill of Beith and the 'Warlock Craigie Spout' or waterfall.6 in OS Map Retrieved : 2013-12-30 The ruins of the long abandoned Langbank Farm are situated on the northern side of Brownmuir Hill near the old drover's road's junction with the Newmills to Threepwood road. ;Brownmuir Hill Brownmuir or Brimmer Hill Plantation is mainly composed of oak, rowan, Scots Pine, birch and beech. The area is very wet with a high humidity and as a consequence the habitat is characterised by a large number of Sphagnum moss hummocks which rise up as much a metre above ground level.Geolocation Retrieved : 2013-12-30 A whinstone quarry and a gravel pit were located on the Brownmuir Hill as were several well made cart tracks. On the summit are the remains of a radio shack and aerial in a remote fenced off area once supplied with mains electricity. The road that ran around the southern slopes of the hill (see photograph) appears from its width to have been a 'drove road' used to drive cattle and sheep to market and considerable effort was clearlyctaken to construct good drystone dykes to confine stock to the road itself. It may also have been used by pack animals/mule trains and was built probably before wheeled vehicles were introduced on farms in the late 18th century; large sledges were in use by farmers at this time to move heavy loads. =Rakerfield= The ruins of Rakerfield. In 1615 William Montgomerie, a merchant, lived at Rakerfield that was situated just off the above-mentioned old drove road that once formed a direct route from Beith to Howwood. Rakerfield Farm was a two storey dwelling of unusual construction, with well carved stone window and door surrounds, etc. It was once used as hunting lodge and a dwelling for a gamekeeper. Mrs & Mrs Blair, lived here at the time of the construction of Kirkleegreen Reservoir and it was purchased upon their death by Ayrshire County Council who the roof removed. A 'Raker' is the Scot's for a travellerScots Dictionary Retrieved : 2013-12-31 which may link with the old drove road that once ran past the property. The Lairds=Hamiltons= The Hamilton family of Brownmuir were probably descended from Udston, ancestor of the Hamilton's of Wishaw, however Dobie records that they were originally a cadet branch of the Hamiltons of Duchal and held Brownmuir for some centuries.Dobie, page 74 The first recorded laird from circa 1611 is Hugh HamiltonPaterson, Page 83 and the next Hamilton heir is William, noted in the 1615 testament of William Montgomerie, merchant in Rakerfield. William appears in the inventory of Hew Montgomerie of Boghall, as having a claim for dry multures and he was in 1685 recorded on the roll of the Lochwinnoch heritors, as the feuar of the land of Auchinbothie-Blair. William Hamilton, the elder of Brownmuir, is recorded as a creditor in 1648 of Robert Gawane (Gavin) of Beith.Paterson, Page 84 In 1646 William's heir was also a William and his daughter was Ursula who married John Fulton of Boydston. In the 1630s the nearby Townend of Threepwood Farm was obtained by a Thomas Fulton.Paterson, Page 118 In 1648 and 1701 William Hamiltoun of Brownmuir was an elder of Beith Kirk and a feuar circa 1658 of a farm of the lands of Auchinbothie Blair. William had two offspring, namely Jean and Ursula. Jean (b. 1662) married the antiquary and writer Robert Hamilton of Wishaw and her descendants succeeded to the title of Lord Belhaven. James Cochrane of Auchincreuch and Mainshill married Ursula circa 1691. =Crawfurds= In 1796 William, seventh Lord Belhaven sold the lands and mills of Brownmuir to Hugh Crawfurd who was a baillie and a writer in Greenock. Hugh Crawfurd married twice and had by his first wife had Hugh Crawfurd of Hillend and the second James, by Ann Dunlop, inherited the lands and sold them in 1829.Paterson, page 86 =Pratts and later owners= John Pratt of Glentarkie in Fife purchased the lands from Lord Belhaven and became sole owner. John had married Isabella Crawfurd, third daughter of Hugh Crawfurd and upon their death the property passed jointly to Maria Eliza Stevenson and Margaret Stevenson. A Stevenson family once also lived at Townend of Threepwood. Water Mills A number of water mills were associated with the Lands of Brownmuir, including the Mill of Beith and probably the lint mill used for processing flax that was located on the Muir Burn near Brownmuir Farm above Knowes Mill, with an associated retting pond. The name of this lint mill is unrecorded. A mill also existed at Boydston on the opposite side from Mill of Beith and Davies o'the Mill may have been another flax mill. Bleach works were located at Threepwood and Sunnyside of Threepwood for bleaching linen made from the processed and woven flax. The evidential records for these are that in 1677, an agreement is recorded between William Hamilton of Brownmuir, who was a heritable proprietor of the corn mill at Mill of Beith, and the suckeners of that mill. The text of the agreement is as follows, laying out the amount of meal that the miller could take as payment for his work - \\"And the said coags to be the just proportionable pairt of the peck whereof the shilling is first measured at the said milne, and that in lieu and place and for satisfaction of all knaveschip, bunnock. gratification, or any other consuetude formerlie dew or is accustomed to be paid or required at the said mylne, and the saids two cogfulls of meill are to be kepped at the mylne eye and hand waved by the owner of the meill; and in case the millar of the said mylne dissent through dissatisficatione with the waving thereof, in that case the said milner is to have libertie to sift the samen, and instead thereof shall have two coagfulls of sifted clean meall straiked ; and whilke two cogfulls of meal extending both to the thrid part of ane peck.\\"Paterson, Page 85 It is also recorded that when in 1796 William Hamilton, seventh Lord Belhaven, sold the Lands of Brownmuir to Hugh Crawfurd of Greenock, mills 'plural' are mentioned as being included in the sale.

He is known for his work on loudspeaker design, and the measurement of professional audio sound systems. Hughes first worked for Peavey Electronics designing loudspeakers and horns where he was granted a patent for the Quadratic-Throat Waveguide horn used in concert loudspeakers. He worked for Altec Lansing for two years as chief engineer for the pro audio division and was granted two more patents. Currently, Hughes designs loudspeakers and performs contract engineering for Excelsior Audio as co- owner. He is an expert consultant in audio measurement and analysis software and systems. He has led committees in prominent standards organizations to develop technical standards for the measurement, modeling and production of audio equipment. Career Hughes with Gene Patronis in 2000 Hughes studied physics at the Georgia Institute of Technology including audio engineering under Dr. Eugene \\"Gene\\" Patronis. He helped maintain WREK, the campus radio station, and he spoke on the air as talent. His senior project was a 3-way loudspeaker system that Hughes describes as sounding good but looking shabby because of his poor woodworking skills. He graduated in 1988 with a bachelor's degree in physics. Following college, Hughes was hired by Peavey Electronics in Meridian, Mississippi, where he worked for almost 14 years. =Peavey= At Peavey, Hughes served as a loudspeaker designer and the main horn designer for loudspeaker enclosures. He developed a new horn design as a means to improve linearity in mid- and high-frequency reproduction. The design was primarily a simple conic section except that its throat was curved in a circular radius arc to match the desired throat size for proper mating to the compression driver. The mathematical formula describing the cross-sectional area expansion was a quadratic equation: :S = Ax^{2} + B\\\\sqrt{r^{2} + x^{2}}\\\\ + C This quadratic equation suggested to Hughes the name of the horn design: the Quadratic-Throat Waveguide (QT waveguide). Instead of increasing the horn mouth size with a flare to control midrange beaming, a relatively thin layer of foam covering the mouth edge was found to suit the same end. The QT waveguide, when compared to popular constant directivity (CD) horns, produced about lower levels of second harmonic distortion across all frequencies, and an average of lower levels of the more annoying third harmonic distortion. Being without a diffraction slot, the QT waveguide was free from problems with apparent apex, making it arrayable as needed for public address purposes. In New York City, Hughes presented a paper on the technology at the Audio Engineering Society convention in September 1999. His patent for the QT waveguide was provisionally filed on March 5, 1999, and granted on May 9, 2000. At Peavey, Hughes measured the results of his horn experiments, and he analyzed the total performance of multiple-driver loudspeakers, especially with regard to tuning the crossover to obtain optimum results. In this measurement he used TEF, a professional acoustical measurements and instrumentation system first made by Techron, a division of Crown International, then sold to Gold Line. TEF is a system that incorporates Richard C. Heyser's time delay spectrometry (TDS) method to analyze sound waves. In 1998, Hughes was appointed to the advisory committee of Gold Line's TEF division. As of 2008 he was still on the advisory committee. Hughes also programmed in MATLAB, a computing environment that allowed him to visualize the complex output pattern of a loudspeaker system under test. He used MATLAB to optimize crossovers to achieve smoother directivity results at the crossover transition region. Toward this end, Hughes developed a software tool called PolarSum which eliminated much of the drudge work of taking a great many polar plot measurements. Hughes also used Enhanced Acoustic Simulator for Engineers (EASE), a 3D simulation tool which was developed by Wolfgang Ahnert and Stefan Feistel of Germany. Hughes involved himself early with the more practical aspects of operating sound systems. He served as head sound engineer and sound designer at the Meridian Little Theatre from 1989. Beginning in 1991, Hughes teamed with Peavey Product Manager Mick Donner to form Meridian SoundWorks, a local sound reinforcement company providing gear and engineering to mix concerts, corporate and political events, and theatrical productions. Meridian SoundWorks also provided sound system design and optimization for permanent installations. The experience allowed Hughes to assess the performance of sound gear in real-world applications. In 2000, Hughes became an instructor of TEF II systems, part of a team that included Don Eger and Russ Berger. =Altec= Hughes joined Altec Lansing in May 2002 to serve as senior engineering manager in the professional audio division. This included both component-level and overall product engineering for the installation market as well as for touring systems. While at Altec, Hughes was granted two patents. The first was a patent for the optimum spacing of driver elements in a line array, using a minimum of drivers. This technology, marketed as \\"InConcert\\", was at the core of Altec's compact computer speaker system FX 6021, a satellite and subwoofer system which used the patented process for its two satellite speakers, each containing six drivers mounted vertically. The two center drivers covered the frequency range from 150 hertz up to 20 kHz, the next two drivers above and below covered up to 6 kHz, and the top and bottom drivers covered up to 1 kHz. This allowed for good sounding results with six drivers mounted on a columnar surface that could physically accommodate eight or nine. Hughes' third patent, his second with Altec, was a patent for a dipole and monopole surround sound speaker system which used indirectly aimed drivers added to the top of the usual front left and front right loudspeakers. Altec brought the technology to market as the GT 5051R—a 3.1 system which included a center speaker and a subwoofer. The front left and right speakers bounced surround information off of the walls and ceiling for customers who did not want to clutter their listening space with a pair of rear speakers. =Excelsior Audio= Hughes left Altec in late 2004 to co- found Excelsior Audio in North Carolina. He serves as managing director. Audio measurement and analysis Hughes in 2013 with audio test and analysis equipment The EASE simulation software that Hughes had been using for years came under management by the Ahnert Feistel Media Group (AFMG) in early 2006. At the beginning of 2011, AFMG brought Hughes on board to consult on software development and to join their team of product support and advanced training experts. Hughes supports AFMG software products such as EASE, EASERA, SysTune and SpeakerLab. Through AFMG, he trains and supports customers of Renkus-Heinz audio products. Professional associations Since 1994 Hughes has been a member of the Audio Engineering Society. He has contributed to four standards committees: SC-02-01 (Digital Audio Measurement Techniques), SC-04-01 (Acoustics and Sound Source Modeling), SC-04-03 (Loudspeaker Modeling and Measurement), SC-04-08 (Sound systems in rooms). After his first paper in 1999, he teamed with Ahnert, Feistel, and Bruce Olson to present a paper in New York in 2007 on simulating the directivity of loudspeakers.Simulating the Directivity Behavior of Loudspeakers with Crossover Filters In 2008 in San Francisco he took part in a panel discussion about the state of the art in loudspeaker design in profession sound reinforcement. The panel included consultant Tom Young, Tom Danley of Danley Sound Labs, Aleš Dravinec of ADRaudio, Dave Gunness of Fulcrum Acoustics, and Pete Soper of Meyer Sound Laboratories.The SOTA of Designing Loudspeakers for Live Sound Hughes also gave a talk called \\"Loudspeaker Directivity Improvement Using Low Pass and All Pass Filters.\\"Loudspeaker Directivity Improvement Using Low Pass and All Pass Filters In New York in 2009, Hughes once again spoke in a panel of experts on the state of live sound loudspeakers.State of the Art Loudspeaker Design for Live Sound In San Francisco in 2010, Hughes chaired a panel discussion about achieving directionality with subwoofers; the panel was composed of Dravinec, Steve Bush from Meyer, Dave Rat of Rat Sound, and Bill Gelow from Bosch Communications.Subwoofer Directionality Hughes also participated in a panel discussion composed of Peter Mapp, Floyd Toole and Kurt Graffy comparing objective audio measurement results with subjective methods.Audio System Measurement and Subjective Evaluation In New York in 2011 he revisited the topic of subwoofer directionality as a member of a panel including Jim Risgin of On Stage Audio, Paul Bauman of JBL, and consultant Doug Fowler.Subwoofer Arrays and Beam Steering Hughes is a member of the Consumer Electronics Association Standards Committee. In 2006, he served as chairman of the sound measurement working group which established testing methods and marketing specifications for subwoofers. Hughes pushed for standardization so that consumers would not be confused by incompatible specifications between subwoofer brands. He said, \\"Consumers trying to interpret figures from two different manufacturers are in a quandary. The numbers may be the same, but they may sound completely different.\\" In October 2013, the CEA honored Hughes at their Technology & Standards Awards Dinner in Los Angeles, naming him as the 2013 recipient of the Technology & Standards Achievement Award, recognizing his contributions to the advancement of \\"new technologies or significant enhancements to existing technologies.\\" The award acknowledged Hughes' leadership in producing the guideline CEA-2034, Standard Method of Measurement for in Home Loudspeakers. Beginning in the 1990s, Hughes joined a LISTSERV discussion hosted by SynAudCon, an audio training organization, and he assisted SynAudCon in training students. As well, he wrote articles for SynAudCon's newsletter. Hughes also joined another industry LISTSERV called Live Audio Board (LAB), hosted by Dave Stevens, a live audio engineer. The LAB was bought by ProSoundWeb (PSW), and Hughes submitted articles for publication by PSW. Hughes also writes for Live Sound International, a magazine published by PSW. Hughes is a member of the Acoustical Society of America. Personal life Hughes graduated from William B. Murrah High School in Jackson, Mississippi. He moved to Atlanta to attend the Georgia Institute of Technology. Upon graduation he moved to Meridian, Mississippi, to work for Peavey. On May 27, 1989, he married Beth Fleeman. First a daughter, Tori, then a son, Ben, were born in Mississippi. The family moved to Milford, Pennsylvania, in mid-2002. In late 2004, the family moved to Gastonia, North Carolina—the hometown of Beth—where Hughes established Excelsior Audio. In December 2012, Hughes presented his daughter at the Gastonia Debutante Ball.

Many of the sets, costumes and vehicles also appear similar in design and the director, Aldo Lado, goes by the alias \\"George B. Lewis\\" in reference to George Lucas. Plot Sometime in the distant future, the planet Metropolis (once known as Earth) is a peaceful utopia led by a leader called The Great Brother. His world is threatened by his brother Graal who has escaped from a prison satellite, stolen a warship and enlisted the help of a mad scientist named Dr. Kraspin. Kraspin has a plan to make an army of unstoppable supersoldiers he calls \\"Humanoids,\\" but to mutate them he requires the powerful element Kapitron that is being kept at the Grovan Institute on Metropolis. Graal sends down a squad of soldiers to break into the institute and steal the Kapitron. They are also ordered to kill a woman named Barbara Gibson, a scientist who once worked with Kraspin but who realized the horrendous potential of the element and had Kraspin committed to a mental facility. Kraspin had escaped the facility two years earlier and seeks revenge against her. Barbara leaves before the slaughter when she is summoned home by her mysterious pupil, a boy named Tom Tom who exhibits powers of mental suggestion. Tom Tom also communes periodically with two mysterious beings who he claims are foreign travelers. After the raid, Graal returns to his hidden base on the planet Noxon where he is joined by Lady Agatha, the world's tyrannical queen, who hopes to share the rule of the galaxy as Graal's wife once he conquers Metropolis. Kraspin is also hiding there, given asylum in exchange for keeping Agatha young and beautiful with daily injections of a youth serum he creates by sapping the life essence of female slaves. Once in possession of the Kapitron, Kraspin selects the perfect specimen to test his mutation on and targets a bearded, giant of a man named Golob. Kraspin forces Golob to crash his ship in a lake and Kraspin fires a small Kapitron missile which explodes turning Golob into a beardless, raging hulk with superhuman strength. Witnessing the horror is Golob's robot dog companion Kip, who sadly watches Kraspin capture and take his master away. Kraspin fits Golob with a brain control chip and unleashes him upon Metropolis with orders to kill the Great Brother. Nick, a Metropolis security officer, tries to protect the Great Brother, but Golob is unstoppable. As Golob approaches his primary target to destroy him, Kraspin interrupts with new orders to go after Barbara Gibson first and Golob leaves. Golob tracks Barbara to her house but Tom Tom uses his powers to calm him down and removes the control chip. Golob, now free of Kraspin's control, becomes Tom Tom and Barbara's friend. Golob tells Barbara that Graal and Kraspin are hiding on Noxon and she goes to inform Nick and The Great Brother. On her way, however, Barbara is captured by Graal's forces and taken back to his base. Tom Tom and Golob try to rescue her but are forced to retreat when Graal's soldiers open fire. The two are saved by the mysterious travelers who shoot the soldiers with glowing arrows. At the Metrolpolis command center, Nick devises a plan to rescue Barbara with a commando raid, but the Great Brother fears innocent people living on Noxon will be killed. Instead, Golob says he will rescue Barbara himself. Nick joins him and he and Golob take a ship to Noxon. Along the way they discover Tom Tom stowing away and wanting to help. Nearing the planet, their ship is attacked by Graal's fighters and crash lands. Near the crash site, they encounter Kip who Golob excitedly remembers as his old companion. Kip then helps them sneak into Graal's base. Once inside the heroes discover Kraspin has a giant missile filled with Kapitron that he will explode over Metropolis and turn its population into mutant humanoids. Meanwhile, Barbara is taken to Kraspin's laboratory and placed in a machine to extract her essence. Barbara is saved last minute when Nick and Golob burst in and free her from the machine. Kraspin and Agatha then attempt to flee to Graal's ship. With Barbara's help and assistance from the mysterious travelers, the heroes launch an attack on the missile launch bay. During the battle, Agatha, unable to get a dose of the youth serum, dies when she rapidly ages into a skeleton. Nick chases Graal onto the bridge of his ship and faces off with him in a duel. Graal shoots lasers from his hands in defense and almost kills Nick. Golob appears and crushes a control panel on his chest and Graal disappears. Kraspin is killed when Golob topples the launch pad of the Kapitron rocket. Golob then removes the Kapitron container from the missile which then launches across the bay and hits Graal's ship destroying it. With the facility exploding around them, the heroes make their escape but without Golob. Tom Tom spots him running away with the Kapitron and jumping off a cliff into a lake. The lake explodes and the heroes fear Golob dead, but he emerges from the water with the effects of the mutation having been reversed. The group briefly celebrates their reunion and victory over their enemy. A mysterious translucent sailing ship appears in the sky piloted by the two travelers. Tom Tom tells Barbara that his mission is over and he must return home. Barbara asks who he really is and where he comes from. Tom Tom tells her he is returning to a land called Tibet in the ancient past, but he will always be with her in her heart. Tom Tom is then seen departing on the ship as the movie ends.

It is a tree species found in parts of south Asia, typically occurring in the edges of tropical wet evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. Taxonomy The following are recognized as synonyms of Mallotus tetracoccus: Mallotus albus var. occidentalis Hook.f., Mallotus ferrugineus (Roxb.) Müll.Arg., Rottlera ferruginea Roxb., and Rottlera tetracocca Roxb. Local names The species is known by a number of vernacular names across its range, including: * Sinhala: Bu kenda (බූ කැන්ද) * Tamil: Mullupolavu, VattaGamble, J. S., and C. E. C. Fischer (1915–1935). Flora of the Presidency of Madras, Parts I to XI. (3 volumes). Adlard and Son Limited, London. * Malayalam: Thavatta, Vatta, Vattakkumbil, Kazhuvakkaradi, Porivatta * Kannada: Uppale mara * Upper Myanmar: Petwaing * Bengali: Marleya Distribution The species occurs in India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Thailand, and China. Within the Western Ghats of India, it is distributed from the Konkan southwards in semi-evergreen to evergreen and shola forests, from the plains to about 1600 m elevation. It also occurs in peninsular hills such as the Shevaroy Hills and Kollimalai Hills of southern India in evergreen and secondary forests. In the north, Brandis notes the species is distributed in the outer ranges and valleys of the Sikkim Himalaya ascending to , common in second growth forest. Further, it occurs in Assam, Bangladesh (including Chittagong hill tracts), Upper Myanmar, and Sri Lanka being very common in the moist low country. Characteristics This is a distinctive mid-sized or mid- storey tree species growing up to around 15 m tall. The bark is 5–8 mm thick with a grey surface, smooth and fibrous. The tree gains its rusty or coppery- white appearance from the colours of the branchlets, young parts, and undersides of leaves. The branchlets and young parts are densely grey or tawny tomentose (hairy) and the young parts are covered by rusty lepidote scales. The underside of leaves is velvety white due to stellate hairs, contrasting with the bright green and glabrous upper surface. The thinly leathery leaves are simple, alternate, and spirally arranged on the twigs. The lamina is 8–25 cm long x 6.5–20 cm broad, and variable in shape from young saplings to large trees, ranging from more or less circular to deltoid or broadly egg-shaped. The leaf apex is acuminate, and the base truncate, nearly heart-shaped or round. The leaves are peltate (prominently in young plants, more narrowly in adult trees). The leaf margin is entire or glandular dentate (toothed or lobed). The leaves are usually prominently 3-5 ribbed from base, with lateral nerves 6-8 pairs, the tertiary nerves running nearly horizontal. The stipules are lateral and fall off, while the leaf also has a long petiole (4.5–10 cm) which is stout and swollen at the base, stellate tomentose along the length, and with two glands at the top. The species is dioecious (unisexual) with male and female flowers on different individual trees. The inflorescences are terminal, branched, panicles about 12–20 cm long, on stout peduncles, holding rusty tomentose buds and yellow or yellowish-white flowers. The male flowers are 7 mm across, with 4 tepals (2 mm) and ovate containing many stamens (filaments to 3 mm). Female flowers are 5 mm across and with 4 tepals (2 mm). The ovary is tomentose, often 4-loculed, and the style, often 4 (or 5), is about 3 mm long and feathery. The fruiting pedicel is about 5 mm long attached to a fruit (1 cm in diameter) which is a depressed roundish capsule covered in gray tomentose and softly spiny stellate hairs. The seeds (ca. 5 mm) are blackish brown, rounded and wedge shaped (angular).

Ecophysiological studies indicate that Mallotus tetracoccus shows higher quantum use efficiency of photosynthetic system (FV/FM) at higher light conditions, with FV/FM values of 0.7407, 0.8140, 0.8020, and 0.7825 at light regimes of 10%, 25%, 50%, and 100%, respectively. Similarly, the species also shows higher relative growth rate (RGR, mg g−1 day−1) in higher light conditions, with RGR values under 10%, 25%, 50%, and 100% light regimes being 5.38, 30.01, 47.38, and 50.02, respectively. The combination of high quantum use efficiency of photosynthetic system and relative growth rates under higher light conditions, similar in pattern to other pioneer species such as Macaranga peltata, indicate the early-successional nature of Mallotus tetracoccus. Adults and saplings are also known to occur in the understorey of Eucalyptus plantations in the Western Ghats. As a dioecious species, a male- biased flowering sex ratio (male: female = 1.73) was reported among trees in a 20 ha plot of tropical forest at Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve in Yunnan, south-west China. In tropical wet evergreen forests of the southern Western Ghats, India, the tree has been reported to be an edge or gap species whose fruits are consumed and seeds are dispersed by birds. The species has also been noted a wind-pollinated species showing diurnal anthesis. The flowers and seeds of Mallotus tetracoccus are reported as consumed by lion- tailed macaques in a tropical rainforest fragment in the Anaimalai hills, India. Uses The plant is known for many Ayurvedic medicinal purposes. Bark and gum of the tree is used for treating fractures and venereal diseases.

The local government of the city of Moscow awarded him a prize in 1997 and in 2013 he was made an honorary professor.  Science and Research  Krylov's main scientific focuses are psychoanalytical anthropology, human identity, communication and social change. According to him, traditional psychoanalysis has evolved from psychotherapy to philosophy. In his monograph “Evolution of Identity” (2010) he showed that the understanding of a human- being is influenced by social change. According to Krylov, the modern human being does no longer try to define himself through traditional identities, but increasingly through new ones.http://elib.suub.uni- bremen.de/edocs/00102112-1.pdf In his monograph “Religious Identities: individual and collective assertiveness in the post-industrial space” he shows that religion is one of the most important factors of identity. His research in the area of economics makes him one of the pioneers of communication management in Eastern Europe. According to Krylov, the development of new forms of management is a sign of the increasing social sensitization of business. His research in the area of business and management is closely connected to communication psychology, morality and ethics.  References  * Alexander N. Krylov // Who's Who in the World.

Biography = Origins and conversion to Christianity = Map of the southwestern part of the Sasanian Empire. Yazdin was a native of Kirkuk in the Garamig ud Nodardashiragan province; he belonged to a high-class Iranian family which practiced Zoroastrianism. He was the son a certain Mihryar, and had a brother named Dadgushnasp. Yazdin's mother was the daughter of the governor (marzban) of Nisibis. When Yazdin grew up, he was sent to a Zoroastrian school, which he, however, disliked and fled from. He shortly arrived to his foster parents who received him warmly. He was later found by his father, who, after having beaten him, sent him back to the school. Yazdin fled once again, and was in the end allowed to stay with his foster parents, while his brother Dadgushnasp would go to school instead. Yazdin visited the church several times with his foster parents, but in the end fled from them and got baptized. = Financial ministry and death = Due to his aristocratic origin, Yazdin had much land under his possession, mostly near Kirkuk and Margha. He is later mentioned as serving as the financial minister of king Khosrow II. Because Yazdin was a Christian and member of the Church of the East, he did everything, to improve the position of his coreligionists. Yazdin built numerous churches and enjoyed the fullest confidence of Khosrow. During the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, a certain Yazden was appointed as the governor of Armenia. This Yazden may have been the same person as Yazdin. In 614, the Sasanians seized the True Cross and brought it to the capital Ctesiphon, where Yazdin took care of the cross and had a celebration along with the other Christians of the Empire. He then sent a piece of the cross to Mount Izla, a place near Nisibis. Yazdin also had rivals at the Sasanian court of Ctesiphon, which included Khosrow's wife Shirin, and the royal physician Gabriel of Sinjar, who unlike him, were both Miaphysite Christians, and were attempting to push back the influence of the Nestorian Christians in favor of their church. However, in 624, the Byzantine emperor Heraclius turned the tide of war against the Sasanians, and advanced into northern Adurbadagan, and by 627, he was close to Ctesiphon. These Sasanian failures made Khosrow so angry that he had several of his officers, including Yazdin, executed. Yazdin had a son named Shamta, who is said to have killed Khosrow. However, according to other sources, it was the Iranian aristocrat Mihr Hormozd, who had Khosrow killed.  References  Sources  * * Peter Brown: The Rise of Western Christendom. 2 expanded edition.

Cronise, also credited as J.D. Cronise, is an American heavy metal musician and record producer. Originally from Roanoke, Virginia, he is best known as the lead vocalist, guitarist, primary songwriter and former producer for Austin, Texas-based band the Sword, which he co-founded in 2003. Prior to the formation of The Sword, he also performed in the bands Those Peabodys and Ultimate Dragons, the latter of which also featured original the Sword drummer Trivett Wingo. Early life Originally from Roanoke, Virginia, as a child Cronise wanted to become a comic book artist, admitting he was \\"more interested in drawing [than songwriting] as a kid\\". He first started playing guitar at the age of 13; his first instrument was an Ibanez RG-550, although he had originally wanted a Gibson Les Paul as Jimmy Page had been his first main inspiration to play guitar. Career=1999–2003: Early career= Cronise moved to Austin, Texas in 1999, claiming that he chose the location over larger cities like Los Angeles and New York City as it was a \\"laid back music town\\" at the time. After originally meeting and first performing together in Virginia, original The Sword drummer Trivett Wingo also moved to Austin a few years after Cronise, and the two returned to playing together \\"almost immediately\\" according to the vocalist and guitarist. Another band in which Cronise performed prior to the formation of The Sword was Those Peabodys, which he has described as \\"pretty much a straight-up rock 'n' roll band\\"; he claimed the reason he left the band was because he felt he \\"needed to do something heavier\\". =2003–present: The Sword= Cronise formed The Sword in 2003 with guitarist Kyle Shutt, bassist Bryan Richie, and drummer Trivett Wingo, after writing and recording music on his own for \\"a few years\\". The majority of the band's early material was written solely by the frontman before the band was formed, although when it was released in 2006 in the form of Age of Winters the musical compositions were credited to the band as a whole. For Age of Winters and the 2008 follow-up Gods of the Earth, Cronise was credited as producer in addition to his contributions of guitar and lead vocals. Prior to the recording of the band's third album Warp Riders, Cronise enlisted in singing lessons to improve his vocal performances, claiming that he \\"stepped it up a little bit\\" for the album. Noting that his vocals were \\"probably the most criticized aspect of [the band's] music\\", he defended himself by claiming that \\"I hear what I meant to do\\", and proposing that maybe people \\"don’t really understand what we’re going for\\". Warp Riders was also the band's first album not to be produced by Cronise himself, instead featuring Matt Bayles; The Sword frontman remained away from production duties for the 2012 follow-up Apocryphon, with studio owner J. Robbins producing the album. Style and influences=Musical influences= One of Cronise's main musical inspirations is English hard rock band Led Zeppelin. In an interview in 2012, he claimed that he felt they were \\"arguably the greatest rock band of all time\\", adding that \\"they were the reason [he] started playing guitar\\". Other bands named as inspiration by Cronise include Thin Lizzy, ZZ Top, Black Sabbath, AC/DC, and the Melvins. In reviews of the band's albums and shows, Cronise's vocal style has been compared to that of Ozzy Osbourne. =Songwriting= Many of Cronise's lyrics on The Sword songs are influenced by literature, including the works of authors such as George R. R. Martin and Jack Vance; Gods of the Earth track \\"To Take the Black\\", for instance, was written about the Night's Watch, a group from Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire novel series. Speaking about his philosophy on writing songs, Cronise has explained that \\"It’s all meant to paint a picture, both the music and the lyrics. I start with an image, or a set of images, or a scene, and work from there\\", drawing similarities between writing songs and drawing pictures. He went on to admit that he is inspired by literature, movies, history, and folklore, and named H. P. Lovecraft as his favourite author (as well as mentioning Robert E. Howard as another influence). It has also been noted that progressive metal band Queensrÿche, French animator and director René Laloux, and Peruvian-American author Carlos Castaneda influenced Cronise during the writing of Warp Riders. When asked in an interview in 2012 about whether he had \\"shied away from using [his] own viewpoint and perspective in songwriting\\" on albums prior to Apocryphon, the frontman admitted that he was \\"hesitant\\" to convey his thoughts and opinions on early material, and that he now felt like he'd \\"gotten to the point where [he] can tell people what [he] thinks and not really give a shit about what they think about [it]\\". He has also stated that he \\"takes a lot of time on [his] lyrics\\", claiming that \\"If you aren't following along with the lyric sheet when you are listening to it then you aren't getting the whole picture of the music\\". Equipment Cronise is endorsed by guitar manufacturer B.C. Rich, and has been known to play their Mockingbird Exotic Classic and Bich Double Neck models. Aside from B.C. Rich, he has also played a number of variations of the Gibson Explorer, and a Gibson Les Paul Custom. Speaking in an interview after the release of Apocryphon, the guitarist claimed that the band had been using mainly the same equipment since they formed, with the exception of \\"some new guitars here and there\\", and that he had been an exclusive user of Orange amplifiers since 1998.

In 2010, Zahran moved to live in the United Kingdom. In 2014, Zahran was indicted by a Jordanian military court on four separate charges against him after he wrote articles describing Jordan to be an apartheid state resembling that of South Africa in its treatment of Palestinians. In September 2019, due to \\"security reasons\\", he was denied entry into Israel where he was scheduled to meet with right-wing and settler leaders. The Jerusalem Post reported that Zahran had faced accusations by some in Israel (including columnists Ruthie Blum and Dr Harold Rhode, the Post's writer Caroline Glick and the Elder of Ziyon blog) of being a \\"fraud\\" and that his so-called the \\"Jordan Opposition Coalition\\" is only present on the internet without a real backing in Jordan. Biography Born on 19 April 1973, Zahran is a Jordanian national writer of Palestinian origin. Zahran's parents were born in Jerusalem, and moved to Jordan during the period when the West Bank was under Jordanian control (1950–1967). He has two master's degrees and was reported in 2012 to have been completing a Ph.D in finance. Before seeking asylum in the UK, Zahran was serving as assistant policy coordinator at the United States Embassy in Amman. In 2010, Zahran wrote an article in The Jerusalem Post that described Jordan as an apartheid state in its treatment against Palestinians; he also claims the Jordanian state resembles that of former apartheid South Africa. The article provoked an uproar of criticism by both Jordanians and Palestinians alike. Shortly after the article was published, Mudar sent a letter of apology through Ammon News after his father Adnan Zahran threatened to cut off relations if the former wrote anything else and considered Mudar's continuation of writing as \\"ingratitude\\" on a personal level against his father, and as an \\"ungratefulness\\" towards Jordan. The father described Mudar's writings as far from truth and reality. Mudar vowed through the letter dating 26 July 2010 to \\"not publish any articles or reports in any language related to Jordanian domestic or foreign affairs.\\" He continued: \\"This decision comes because of I have sensed clearly that my articles are being misunderstood and exploited by some against my precious country whether by ill intention or misunderstanding.\\" After leaving Amman to live in the United Kingdom in 2010, a local gazette published an announcement on 31 May 2011 by Amman's Magistrates' court calling on Mudar to present himself at court for a lawsuit filed against him by the HSBC bank branch in Jordan. The announcement said he was called for failing to repay the bank amounts totaling up to 47,000 Jordanian dinars (about US$66,000). He told The Times of Israel in 2012, \\"The King (Abdullah II) is not going to survive, it's out of the question... I give him until next summer, more or less. And even if I am wrong, I can't see the King making it to 2014 by any stretch.\\" In December 2013, Zahran was charged by a Jordanian military court and scheduled to be tried in absentia for four separate charges against him: \\"inciting hatred against the regime, sectarian strife and insulting the king as well as security services.\\" According to the Jordanian newspaper Al Ghad, \\"Zahran's social networking sites carry articles and phrases offensive to Jordan and his own people (Palestinians).\\" In February 2014, The Jerusalem Post reported that Zahran had been convicted and sentenced in absentia to jail with hard labor. The reports concerning the length of his sentence differed, with AFP reporting earlier that he might face up to 15 years. According to The Jerusalem Post's deputy managing editor Caroline Glick, she was contacted by three of her acquaintances in October 2017 who discouraged her from writing in support of Zahran. \\"They did not coordinate their calls. Each one told me independently that Zahran is not a credible source. He is not a leader of an opposition movement. He doesn't have an organization. He has multiple websites, they said...\\" Her sentiment was shared by other Israeli right-wing writers and publications including the Elder of Ziyon blog. On 17 September 2019, he was banned from entering Israel where he was scheduled to meet with far-right and settler Israeli leaders. The Israeli Interior Ministry said that the ban was denied due to \\"security reasons\\". The Jerusalem Post reported that Mudar faced accusations by some in Israel (including columnists Ruthie Blum and Dr Harold Rhode, the Post's writer Caroline Glick and the Elder of Ziyon blog) that he is a \\"fraud\\" and that his so-called \\"Jordan Opposition Coalition\\" only has a presence on the internet with no real backing in Jordan. Personal life Zahran lives in London and has two daughters and a son.

Early life Moy was born in the Liberty of the Rolls (now part of Westminster) in London around 1823. In the 1851 Census of Islington he is listed as living with his wife Henrietta and six-month-old daughter and is described as a 28-year-old Law Stationers Clerk.1851 Census of Islington, RG8/1500, Folio 415, Page 6, Thomas Moy, 15 Freeling Street, Finsbury. In 1881 Moy was living in Camberwell and was described as a 58-year-old civil engineer.1881 Census of Camberwell, RG11/676, Folio 66, Page 35, Thomas Moy, 64 Anstley Road, Camberwell. In 1901 he was still living in Camberwell but was now described as a 78-year-old Mechanical Engineer and Patentee; his wife also with him, but she died a few months after the census.1901 Census of Camberwell, RG13/508, Folio 65, Page 13, Thomas Moy, 130 Ivydale Road, Camberwell. Aeronautics Moy's introduction to aeronautics was through ballooning but he soon became interested in heavier- than-air flight, and performed some experiments with lifting surfaces by towing surfaces in the Surrey Canal in 1861 Moy was one of the earliest members of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain (later the Royal Aeronautical Society), founded in 1866, and presented a number of papers at its meetings, including one in 1869 describing the soaring flight of albatrosses in a wind. His best-known work, the Aerial Steamer was constructed in 1874 and tested at the Crystal Palace in South London in July 1875, with limited success: the aviation historian Charles Gibbs-Smith credits the machine with a brief flight, lifting off the ground by 6 in (15 cm)Gibbs-Smith (2003) 61. However, according to Octave Chanute's contemporary and detailed account, the aircraft never came close to flying because it was unable to reach the speed necessary for takeoff. The Society described it as \\"one of the most determined attempts at solving the problem [of powered flight] which has yet taken place.\\" Shortly after the first test the machine was damaged in a storm: Moy rebuilt it with substantial modifications, but after brief tests the project was abandoned owing to lack of money. He was also involved in a dispute over patent rights with Mr. Shill, the engineer who had worked with him on the development of the engine. In 1879 he demonstrated the Military Kite to a meeting of the Aeronatical Society. This was a rubber-powered model, capable of taking off under its own power. Around 1901 Moy was experimenting with an ornithopter mounted on an elevated track at Farnborough, Kent In March 1904 Moy gave a lecture to the Aeronautical on mechanical flight. After his lecture the president announced: Moy died in 1910. The Aerial Steamer The Aerial Steamer, with the propellers as first designed The Aerial Steamer, sometimes called the Moy-Shill Aerial Steamer, was an unmanned tandem wing aircraft driven by a 3 hp (2.25 kW) steam engine using methylated spirits as fuel. This drove a pair of six-bladed propellers placed between the two bamboo and stretched linen wings, of which the rear had a span of 14 ft (4.27 m) and an area of 64 ft2 (5.9 m2): the front wing was slightly smaller, with an area of 50 ft2 (4.6 m2). A third smaller surface was mounted at the rear of the aircraft: this was adjustable for the purpose of altering the trim. It was 14 ft (4.27 m) long and weighed about 216 lb, (98 kg) of which the engine accounted for 80 lb (36 kg), and ran on three wheels. Moy's first set of propellers consisted of a number of individual wooden blades attached to the six spokes of the assembly, their pitch becoming finer the further they were from the hub: this arrangement was replaced by stretched fabric blades before the flight test. The propellers were fitted with a mechanism designed to alter the pitch of the blades as they rotated, so that the blades moving downwards were at a coarser pitch to provide a lifting force. It was tested in tether around an ornamental fountain at the Crystal Palace in South London in June 1875 on a circular rolled gravel track of nearly 300 ft (90 m) diameter. A first trial churned up the gravel and achieved very little. A wooden deck was then laid over the gravel, and a second attempt made: Moy later told Octave Chanute that it did not reach a speed of above 12 mph (19 km/h) and did not lift off: Moy had calculated that a speed of around 35 mph (56 km/h) would be necessary. However it is credited with being the first steam-powered aircraft to have left the ground under its own power by the historian Charles Gibbs- Smith. Shortly afterwards the Aerial Steamer was severely damaged by in a gale. Moy rebuilt it, with the propellers enlarged to 12 ft (3.66 m)and now rotating about a vertical axis, in effect transforming the machine into a helicopter. In this configuration it now weighed . He tested it under cover, and it was found that by suspending it and counterbalancing of its weight it would lift off, the \\"aerial wheels\\" (as Octave Chanute calls them) providing lift. The Military Kite In 1879 Moy demonstrated his \\"military kite\\" to a meeting of the Royal Aeronautical Society. This was a small model aircraft propelled by a pair of rubber-driven propellers which rotated in opposite directions. This had two lifting surfaces like the Aerial Steamer, but was more like a modern aircraft in that there was a principal lifting surface mounted in front of a second lifting surface of half the span and a quarter of the area. The bow-shaped surfaces were made of cambric, had dihedral and an adjustable angle of incidence and were fixed to on a central pine box-girder, mounted on wheels. Unlike Alphonse Pénaud's Planophore of 1871, which had to be hand-launched, the Military Kite could take off under its own power. NotesReferences *Gibbs-Smith, C.H. Aviation London: NMSI, 2003.

He held the estates of Birkenbog and Forglen, as well as land in Ireland. He served as Vice-Lord-Lieutenant of Banffshire, and Justice of the Peace and Commissioner of Supply for both Aberdeenshire and Banffshire. Ancestry Abercromby was the son of George Samuel Abercromby (1824–1872) and Agnes Georgina, the daughter of John Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Kilmaine. The couple had three other sons, George Cosmo, Cavendish Douglas and Douglas Charles, and two daughters. Life Abercromby was born in London on 14 June 1850 but spent his formative years at Forglen House in Turriff, Aberdeenshire, after his father succeeded to the family estates in Scotland and Ireland in the year 1855. He was educated at Eton College. In November 1872 he inherited the estates from his father, becoming the 7th in the line of Abercromby baronets. Forglen House was the main family seat and Abercromby continued programmes of improvement to the house and policies that had been initiated by his forebears. The Abercrombys also owned land in Ireland after the 5th Baronet bought most of the town of Fermoy from the estate of fellow Scotsman John Anderson after his death in 1820. The 7th baronet is recorded as the owner of 434 acres of land in County Cork during the 1870s and Fermoy House is listed as the family seat in Ireland. Inchdrewer Castle also formed part of his inheritance and MacGibbon and Ross list it in his ownership in 1887. Abercromby served on several committees, including being Convenor of the County Lunacy Board, Chairman of the Parochial Board (when these became civil parishes he was unopposed as Chairman of the new committee) and a member of the Banff County Road Board. He was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of Banffshire from 1874, then Vice-Lord- Lieutenant of Banffshire from 1892. From 1876 he was also Deputy Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire. He also undertook the roles of Justice of the Peace and Commissioner of Supply for both Banffshire and Aberdeenshire, although he was less active within the jurisdiction of the latter. On 26 June 1883 Abercromby married Florence Anita Eyre Coote (23 December 1860 – 4 December 1946), the only daughter of Eyre Coote and the granddaughter of the British Army officer of the same name, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. The youngest child, Robert Alexander Abercromby, was born almost three weeks after Abercromby's death and later, after the death of his brother, became the 9th baronet. Death and legacy Abercromby had been in poor health for several years before he died. He and his wife stayed in Ceylon during the winter of 1894 to avoid the extreme Scottish weather. His health appeared to have improved after they returned to the UK but he was taken ill in July. Despite a successful stomach operation, he died on 24 July 1895. Abercromby is buried in the mausoleum within the policies of Forglen House. The estate passed to his eldest son, George William Abercromby (born 18 March 1886), who at the time was nine years old.

(16 December 1880 – 19 September 1959) nicknamed (, alluding to his stature), was an Irish educator and briefly an independent senator. He was active in the Gaelic League and became head teacher of Coláiste na Rinne in County Waterford. Early and personal life Ó hEocha was born James HoughHindley 1990, p.xviii in Ballyshane, Monagea, south of Newcastlewest, County Limerick. He was one of six children of David Patrick Hough, a farmer, and his wife Honora, née Dowling. His mother tongue was English. After primary school he worked in Dublin and attended Irish classes in the Gaelic League with Brian O'Higgins. He considered emigrating to the United States where his relative P. H. McCarthy was an influential trade unionist. Instead he got a job teaching Irish for the League around County Kildare. He married Mairéad Ní Dhruacháin and they had three children: Colm, later an academic and administrator; Aonghus; and Déirdre. He died in Bon Secours Hospital, Cork, and his funeral mass was celebrated by Daniel Cohalan, Bishop of Waterford and Lismore, and attended by the President, Éamon de Valera, and other political and Irish-language figures. Career Ó hEocha studied Irish in Coláiste na Mumhan in Ballingeary, passing an exam in 1906 and gaining the nickname \\"An Fear Mór\\" in 1908. He worked as a timire, organising Irish classes around Munster for the Gaelic League. Later he taught Irish in Cistercian College, Roscrea and Mungret College. Having earlier helped pay for the building of Coláiste na Rinne in 1906, he became its principal when it became a primary school in 1919. He and the Coláiste more generally were credited with slowing the encroachment of English as the vernacular into the small Ring Gaeltacht, although in later years he was pessimistic about its survival.Hindley 1990, p.125 In 1920 The Educational Company of Ireland published as a reader Seanchas agus Scéilíní Simplidhe dá Ghaedhil óga na hÉireann, a collection of stories which had appeared in Pobal, a Limerick paper. Later readers were Géilín chun na leanbhaí thabhairt isteach ar léigheamh na Gaedhilge (1923), Bréagán do pháistí óga na h-Éireann, and Féirín do leanbhaidhe óga na hÉíreann. He also edited a collection of stories by Micil Ó Muirgheasa, a seanchaí from Ring. Ó hEocha helped start two factories in Dungarvan, one for leather and the other for glue and gelatin. He was a member of the Gaeltacht Commission in 1925–26, the governing body of University College Cork in 1945, and the Irish Tourist Board in 1941–42. He presided over the 1949 Oireachtas na Gaeilge. 1938 Seanad Ó hEocha served in the brief 2nd Seanad, convened in April 1938 after the revival of Seanad Éireann under the 1937 Constitution and dissolved that July after the Dáil election in June. He was nominated on the Cultural and Educational Panel by the Irish Technical Education Association. Although the opposition senators hoped to have him nominated unopposed as Leas-Cathaoirleach, the Fianna Fáil senators, then in government, successfully nominated one of their own, Pádraic Ó Máille. This was an early indication that the revived Seanad would be run along party lines, mirroring Dáil Éireann, the lower house. Ó hEochadha was not a member of subsequent Seanads.

The club is named after the ancient historian Herodotus, descended from Halicarnassus, Asia Minor, whose bust is also used as the club logo. Irodotos was established in 1932 by refugees from Asia Minor (and specifically the site of modern Bodrum, then still called Halicarnassus), who were displaced following the Greco-Turkish War in 1922. By acclamation, Irodotos is considered the third most successful club in Heraklion in terms of achievements, due to its consistent presence in the Second and Third national divisions, but has maintained a considerable fan base, and a longstanding rivalry with local Superleague side OFI, despite the fact the two haven't met in national competitions for almost 30 years. The club currently competes in the Football League, the second tier of the Greek football league system, while also administering amateur men's football and basketball departments. In the past it also had departments for wrestling, cycling, women's football and athletics. Its colours are blue and white. History Club older crest. =Early years and legacy= Several years after the public housing development of Nea Alikarnassos was founded (in 1925), former Halicarnassus residents and refugees established a sports club in order to strengthen the collective consciousness ties between the inhabitants of the settlement. The club was named after Herodotus (), thus commemorating the ancient historian native to Halicarnassus. The club was officially established as Podosferikos Athlitikos Syllogos Alikarnassou Irodotos (or P.A.S.A. Irodotos) by then community president, Michalis Eleftheriadis and other prominent figures of the refugee community. In its early years, and until the end of the German occupation of Crete, Irodotos' sporting activities were primarily mild, before reverting to full activity in 1948. Irodotos joined the Third Division of the regional Heraklion Football Clubs Association, managing consecutive promotions to reach the First Division and compete against historical clubs such as OFI and Ergotelis. Irodotos promoted to national competitions (e.g. the Beta Ethniki, second tier of the Greek football league system) in 1960, and played in the competition until 1965, when the club was relegated to the newly established Gamma Ethniki (third level in the league pyramid). In total, Irodotos has played 12 seasons in the Second National Division (relegated for the last time in 1982) and 16 times in the Gamma Ethniki, thus making it the club with the third most appearances in professional competitions based in Heraklion, behind ex-Greek Superleague local rivals OFI and Ergotelis. Furthermore, Irodotos has reached the Greek Football Cup Quarter-finals once in 1987–88 (losing to competition finalists Panathinaikos) and the Round of 16 twice, the first time during the 1981−82 season (eliminated by eventual competition winners AEK) and for a second time during 1988−89, when they were eliminated by club rival OFI. =Recent years= In recent years, Irodotos have played primarily in the Gamma Ethniki, from which they were last relegated in the end of the 2014–15 season after being deducted fifteen points by the Hellenic Football Federation in response to the murder of visiting fan Kostas Katsoulis by Irodotos hooligans in the municipal Nea Alikarnassos Stadium during a Football League 2 home match vs. Ethnikos Piraeus. After the tragic incidents that took place in 2015, Irodotos made a triumphant return to the Gamma Ethniki winning four trophies in a single season during 2016−17. More specifically, Irodotos was crowned champion of the Heraklion FCA Championship, while also managing to win the Heraklion FCA Cup, along with the Greek Football Amateur Cup and eventually the Greek Amateurs' Super Cup. Their next season in the Gamma Ethniki saw them win the Group 8 title and qualify to the Football League promotion play-offs, where they eventually celebrated their return to the 2nd tier of the Greek football league system after a 36-year absence.

It was completed in 1947 to house United Nations employees and delegates, many of whom had faced racial discrimination when they sought housing in other areas. History When the United Nations began operations in the New York City area in 1946, people from all over the world came to the area to work for the fledgling international organization, including many persons of color. Almost all real estate in the area was racially segregated, and this along with a national housing shortage made housing options for non-white people particularly limited. In an attempt to surmount this shortage, the UN had contracted for housing in Fresh Meadows and Peter Cooper Village, both new apartment complexes owned by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, but these contracts still allowed the company to deny housing to prospective residents on the basis of race. Although it had not articulated a discriminatory policy, in fact both complexes' residents were exclusively white at the time (and for decades thereafter). Many UN employees protested this situation, and the UN backed out of its contracts with the complexes. Still needing housing for its employees, the organization then signed a lease with Parkway Village, which was under construction at the time. As the initial lessee of most of the apartments, the UN could allocate housing to its employees without regard to race or origin. This made Parkway Village an unusually integrated community for its time. The location was convenient to the UN's temporary headquarters, the present Queens Museum building erected for the 1939 New York World's Fair, where many thought the organization would build its permanent headquarters, which ultimately was completed in 1952 in Manhattan. Though the UN's involvement in the property ended the same year that the Manhattan headquarters opened, many of its employees continued to live there, and they comprised about a quarter of all residents three decades later. Ralph Bunche, an African American diplomat who was instrumental in the UN's formation, and who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950, lived at Parkway Village from 1947 to 1952. Bunche was one of the employees who protested the UN's initial involvement with segregated apartment complexes. After leaving Parkway Village, Bunche moved to a private house nearby that is a National Historic Site. Around this time, two prominent residents without UN connections were attracted to the community by its unique international character: civil rights leader Roy Wilkins and labor (and later feminist) activist Betty Friedan both lived at Parkway Village in the early 1950s. Description and Architects The complex consists of 109 buildings, which together take up only 16% of the land area, surrounded by landscaped grounds. Each are each two or three stories tall and are faced with red brick. Their style is described as neo-Georgian or \\"modernized Colonial\\". The architect was Leonard Schultze, who in prior decades was known for designing luxury hotels (notably the Waldorf-Astoria), but who in the 1940s had turned his attention to large middle-income apartment complexes for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, including Parkmerced in San Francisco, Park La Brea in Los Angeles, and Parkfairfax in Alexandria, Virginia. The landscape designer was Clarence Combs (1892-1958), who had previously worked on many other projects associated with Robert Moses, including the well-known Jones Beach State Park. Moses, a politically powerful parks commissioner and the driving force behind the construction of Parkway Village, had helped to arrange the project's financing and lease with the UN. He likely recommended Combs for the landscaping role. Owing to both its architectural significance and its historical associations, the complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

Clark, starring Esther Williams and Cliff Robertson. The cast also includes Robert Vaughn, Margia Dean, Nehemiah Persoff and David Nelson, who was best known to audiences of the time for The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet television show. This is the third variation of Jerome Weidman's novel I'll Never Go There Any More. The other two are Broken Lance (1954) a western version starring Spencer Tracy, and House of Strangers (1949) set in the big city starring Edward G. Robinson. Plot Bruno Everhard (Persoff) is the rigid and uncompromising owner of a German traveling circus. His four sons and daughter all work for the circus, including as performers. Three of the boys, in particular Klaus (Vaughn), resent the favoritism Bruno shows one son, Josef (Robertson). To curry his father's favor, Klaus abandons his sweetheart, circus aerialist Carlotta Martinez (Dean), to instead marry Teresa Vizzini (Mannhardt), whose father operates an animal menagerie that Bruno would like to merge with as a result. Josef, meantime, has fallen in love with a wealthy American woman, Hillary Allen (Williams), who wants him to quit the circus and begin a new life. Bruno is defied by his daughter, who marries Eric (Nelson), a soldier who wishes to try the trapeze. Teresa, distraught at learning why Klaus married her, commits suicide at the circus, stepping into the cage of man-eating bear. Carlotta, too, is almost killed, due to a faulty high wire during her act. Negligence is charged and Josef accepts the blame, sparing his father from having to go to prison. The other brothers seize the opportunity to take control of the circus. Bruno attempts a comeback on the trapeze, but has a heart attack and dies. Released from prison, Josef vows revenge. Klaus decides to kill his own brother, but steps too close to the bear's cage and is killed. Wishing there to be no more violence or retribution, Josef decides to leave the circus for good, and Hillary agrees to marry him. Cast * Esther Williams as Hillary Allen * Cliff Robertson as Josef Everard * Nehemiah Persoff as Bruno Everard * Robert Vaughn as Klaus Everard * Margia Dean as Carlotta Martinez * David Nelson as Eric Solden * Carol Christensen as Garda Everard * Kurt Pecher as Hans Everard * Renate Mannhardt as Teresa Vizzini * Franco Andrei as Fredrik Everard * Peter Capell as Pietro Vizzini * Stefan Schnabel as Lawyer * Carleton Young as Judge Richter * Philo Hauser as Ringmaster * Mariza Tomic as Fraustein Production James Clark and Ted Sherdeman had worked together on A Dog of Flanders for Associated Producers Inc (API). They formed their own company, Gemtaur Productions, and made The Big Show with API. At one stage Millie Perkins was announced for the lead. The film was shot in Munich Germany and Copenhagen in November 1960. Esther Williams insisted on writing her own dialogue. Reception Maury Dexter says the film was a moderate success at the box office.Dexter p 107 =Critical response= Howard Thompson of The New York Times wrote in his review of the film: \\"Against the excellently staged sawdust numbers (the polar bear act is fascinating), the increasingly ugly incidents edge toward dank, Gothic melodrama (a trial and a murderous climactic fight). There is little lightness or imagination in either the script or the directing. As softening concessions, we have two obvious romantic interludes. In one, young Carol Christensen pairs off with David Nelson, as a smitten American soldier—and the youngsters do very nicely. The main match brackets the laconic Mr. Robertson, as the noblest circus heir, and a starry-eyed Miss Williams, in the briefest role of her career, as a rich American expatriate without a pool to her name. She does dip once, swiftly, in an inserted and strikingly photographed, resort sequence (Scandinavia). The film's best performance, with the cast striving hard, comes from Renate Mannhardt, as a lovely, betrayed bear tamer. Robert Vaughn, Margia Dean and Kurt Fecher are okay in other supporting parts. But The Big Show is an unappetizing bill of goods, beautiful to look at.\\" Clark and Sherman worked on another film for API, Brother, but it appears to have not been made. Release The Big Show was released in theatres on July 14, 1961. The film was released on DVD on December 11, 2012.

The by-election was held due to the succession of the incumbent Conservative and former Liberal Unionist MP, Hon. Harry Levy-Lawson to the peerage as Baron Burnham, on the death of his father. It was won by the Conservative candidate Warwick Brookes.http://www.leighrayment.com/commons.htm Noel Pemberton-Billing, who had resigned from the Royal Naval Air Service to campaign for greater use of air power in World War I, stood as an independent candidate, promising that when the defence of London was in the hands of \\"practical airmen\\" the city would be safe from air raids by zeppelins. Canvassing on behalf of Brookes began immediately. J. D. Gilbert, who had won the Newington West by-election, sent him a letter of support asking Mile End's Liberals to support Brookes, and B. S. Straus, who had been the prospective Liberal candidate in Mile End, offered to sign Brookes's nomination papers. Campaigning in support of an intensified war effort, Brookes supported the \\"economic strangulation\\" of Germany, and backed Military Service Bill which would introduce conscription. He also supported the development of air defences, and advocated an air force given the same pre-dominance then held by the Royal Navy. The writ for the by- election was issued on 17 January, and with the campaign well underway The Times newspaper commented the next day that it would be \\"unwise to speculate on the result\\". Many of Mile End's 6,000 electors were unable to vote, since they were away serving in the war. Some 2,000 of the voters were Jewish, and their support was seen as critical; many of them were shopkeepers, and The Times speculated that they might be attracted to Billings' commitment to end the blackout. Billings made his speeches from the cockpit of an aeroplane and both candidates advocated similar policies for strengthening air defences. Nominations closed on 21 January, and the First Lord of the Admiralty, Arthur Balfour, intervened to denounce the \\"criminality\\" of an implication by Billings that the air defence of the East End had been neglected because the people there were poor. Polling took place on 25 January, and Brookes was declared the winner with a majority of 376 votes (10.4%) over Billings.

The lands were given to the abbots of the Abbey of Arbroath by King William the Lion before 1211 and the Monymusk Reliquary was held there. The original castle, built around 1346, was replaced by a vernacular harled house that was later extended. Significant development of the estate began when it was acquired by the family of Lord Banff and they started the work of landscaping and planting trees. It became their main family seat during the 18th century. After the death of William Ogilvy, the eighth and final Lord Banff, the estate passed by marriage to the Abercromby baronets who continued to enhance the property and maintained it as their main residence. Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet commissioned the Aberdeen City Architect, John Smith to design the present house in 1839. Forglen House was sold by the Abercromby family in 1974 but remains in private ownership. It is not open to the public, although access to the grounds is available and some cottages can be hired as holiday lets, including one of the lodge houses. The mansion is a Category A listed building and several other structures within the estate, including the stables and a gothic-style mausoleum, are Category B listed. The gardens are listed on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland as outstanding in most sections. History The estate of Forglen (Foithir Gleann, meaning \\"the hollow of the vale\\" in Gaelic) was one of the parcels of land added to the property of the abbots at the Abbey of Arbroath by King William the Lion prior to 1211. Charters indicate the Monymusk Reliquary or Breccbennach was probably held at Forglen and the tenants were required to ride under the standard of the Arbroath abbots if called to defend king and kingdom. Forglen remained under the Abbey's feudal superiority until the superiority passed to the Marquis of Hamilton in 1608. Thirty-nine years later, in 1641, the feudal superior was William Murray, 1st Earl of Dysart and then, in 1642, it was the Maules of Panmure. The first holders of the Forglen land detailed in the charters are Sir Thomas of Monymusk and then his son, Malcolm, is listed in the 1315 charter. Malcolm was probably succeeded by a son, John, who died by 1387. The following generations produced no male heirs so the land was inherited by daughters. Alexander Irvine of Drum raised a successful brieve (writ) mort d'ancestor at a specially arranged court in Aberdeen on 24 January 1414 claiming the lands of Forglen. The session was overseen by the justiciary of the Arbroath abbots and held in the house of Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar, a known supporter of the Irvine family who had fought alongside him in France and at the Battle of Harlaw, just north of Inverurie. The land continued in Irvine family ownership until 1624 when they sold it to the Urquharts of Craigfintray. George Ogilvy, who later became Lord Banff, acquired Forglen in 1637. The Ogilvy family were staunch Royalists and their properties, including Forglen, came under attack by the Covenanter forces led by General Robert Monro in 1640. The principal family seat at the time was Inchdrewer Castle and appears to have remained as the main residence until around 1713 when George Ogilvy, 3rd Lord Banff died in a fire there. Sir Alexander Ogilvy, 1st Baronet was the second son of George Ogilvy, 2nd Lord Banff and is described in a 1702 ratification charter signed by Queen Anne as \\"Alexander Ogilvy of Forglen\\". He assumed the title of Lord Forglen after his appointment as a Senator of the College of Justice in 1706. Forglen became the main family residence of the Ogilvy family during the 18th century and marked the onset of significant development of the estate. The 7th Lord Banff, Alexander, who inherited the estate from his grandfather in 1727, began planting trees and organising plantations. He died at Forglen on 1 December 1771. As Alexander's eldest son, also named Alexander, had pre-deceased him, his second son, William, inherited and became the 8th Lord Banff. William, a former army captain who served under the Duke of York, continued the development of the estate until his death at Forglen on 4 June 1803. The lands were then inherited by William's sister, Lady Jane Abercromby, who had married Sir George Abercromby of Birkenbog and the peerage of Lord Banff became dormant. The Abercromby baronets owned a significant amount of property in Ireland, as most of the town of Fermoy had been purchased by them from John Anderson in the early 19th century. By 1814 Forglen was used as the main family seat of the Abercromby family; in 1877 they also acquired Dunlugas House, which was sited on the other side of the River Deveron. Lady Jane Abercromby's son, Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet, continued to enhance the grandeur of the estate policies by commissioning the building of a new mansion and several other buildings. During the Second World War Forglen was one area that had an Auxiliary Unit Patrol. Auxiliary Units were a top-secret resistance organisation formed down the entire eastern side of the UK. If Germany ever invaded, the patrol would go into hiding in an Operational Base. When the invasion was one to two weeks old, and things settled down, the patrol would come out at night and undertake guerilla warfare. Members of the patrols were trained as explosives experts and were well armed compared to the conventional British Army. Research by Coleshill Auxiliary Research Team has identified the patrol members and an approximate location of the operational base in the estate. Robert Alexander Abercromby, the 9th Abercromby baronet, died at home on 19 October 1972 and the estate was marketed for sale in 1974. It was subsequently bought by Tristan Russell and his family and remains as of 2018 in their ownership Mansion A feature on the 4-storey tower is a triple coat of arms from 1578 The original residence at Forglen, on the left bank of the River Deveron, was constructed around 1346. The first structure was probably a castle but was replaced with a vernacular harled house, which had a tower wing extension erected during the late 18th century. In 1839, when Sir Robert Abercromby commissioned the Aberdeen City Architect John Smith to build the present mansion, the old house was demolished but some materials were salvaged and used in the new house. The mansion was constructed over the footprint of the previous structure. Armorial panels and inscriptions from the ancient castle were preserved and set into an octagonal tower. The cost of building the new mansion was £16,000, equivalent to about £1.4 million as of 2012. Architectural historian Charles McKean likened the central tower and gatehouse to the style of Robert Smythson and described the mansion house design as an \\"Elizabethan Gothic confection\\" that had \\"all the romantic aspirations of the early 19th century poured into it\\". The mansion house was designated a Category A listed building by Historic Scotland on 22 February 1972. =Exterior= Based on a courtyard house layout, externally the harled whinstone rubble mansion is a combination of Elizabethan and Jacobean (or Gothic) design, similar to Smith's work at Slains. A spacious central courtyard is surrounded by buildings three storeys high. Within the back of the courtyard, circular towers enclose the service stairways. A large Elizabethan-style tower housing the main stairway is also set within the courtyard but sited to the front behind the reception rooms. Other external features include: canted and box bays; a variety of lofty towers that are round, square or octagonal; many different gables; and numerous diagonally set stone flues. The southeast facing front elevation lacks symmetry with the main Tudor style entranceway set off centre and extending out. A plaque commemorating the building dates of 1839–1842 and a central armorial are above the round arched entrance. There is also an eight- sided tower positioned at the front corner. A separate driveway accesses the outside kitchen yard at the back of the north west elevation. This side of the mansion is plainer, more restrained and built into the slope of the hillside. A lengthy one storey lean-to houses fuel supplies and servants toilets and provides additional ground support. The northeast elevation is also more architecturally reserved than the front. =Interior= Internal components embraced a classical style with features like the Corinthian columned screen featured in the Dining Room. The entrance hall has two storeys with a left ascending staircase. Kitchen, service and servant amenities are on the ground floor, as are the gun room, stores and beer and wine cellars. The first floor has a long gallery corridor running the whole length of the inner courtyard. Another pair of Corinthian columns screen the cantilevered staircase from the gallery corridor. Several trompe-l'œil panels and borders are present and the plastered walls mimic timber panelling. Bedrooms were accommodated on the first and second floor. The bedrooms housed within the north-west elevation on the third floor are simple and were used by the servants of visitors if there was insufficient room for them on the ground floor. Polished red granite was used for the mantlepieces. =Late 19th-century furnishings= An 1895 newspaper description of the furnishings of the mansion relates there are several hunting trophies displayed in the entrance hall. The antler from an elk's skeleton, which had been found buried in the family's Fermoy estate, was mounted in the hall and the width between the tips was reported as more than . The dimensions for the long gallery are given as long with a ceiling height of and wide. Decorated in a deep maroon, steel engravings, drawings and old prints adorn the walls. It was furnished with antiques and an organ was the centrepiece. Some of the first floor rooms accessed from the gallery were a Ballroom and a Drawing Room. Three arches separated these two rooms and the side arches were fitted with mirrors. Silk damask in a light blue shade was the Ball Room wall covering while satin of a light green colour was used in the Drawing Room. Among the paintings displayed in the Dining Room were family portraits by Henry Raeburn and a painting by John Hoppner was in the Library. Gardens and wider estate The Gothic-style Mausoleum The gardens and policies were added to the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland in 2011 because it is an \\"all-round, outstanding designed landscape\\". Designated as \\"outstanding\\" within six of the seven categories (work of art, historical, horticultural, architectural, scenic and archaeological), it is listed as of high importance in the assessment for the nature conservancy listing. To the northwest of the mansion is a square walled garden. Enclosed inside the high perimeter walls are greenhouses and outside are several lean- to stores, potting sheds and a single storey cottage for the gardener. Category C listed on 15 February 1982, these structures were also designed by Smith in the 19th century. Several other structures within the policies are listed. These include the Category B listed Gothic style mausoleum constructed in 1865 at a cost of £2,500, equivalent to around £266,000 as at 2012. Built in the shape of a cross, it has a round stained glass window in the front gable and features many gargoyles and other stone decorations. Bodies are interred in the burial ground outside but commemorative stones made of Carrara marble are inside the mausoleum. The corbels on the internal oak roof are embellished with angel figurines. Among other Category B listed structures are the stables and coach house situated to the south of the mansion. This group of buildings are given as constructed 1840 by Historic Scotland but Miller attributes them as being from the time of the previous mansion. The brick built Dovecot, from the early 19th-century and the Eastside and North Lodge houses from 1865 are also Category B listed. In 1906 some excavation work was undertaken by Scottish archaeologist J. Graham Callander on a circular tumulus that is within the estate, just over half a mile to the south of the mansion. The mound, in a wooded area known as Meadowheads Wood, is in height and wide. Various relicts and urns were discovered including three drinking-cup type urns, some of the \\"highest quality\\". Recent times The mansion and estate remains in private ownership in the 21st century. The Russell family undertook gradual and ongoing restoration and re-furbishment of the mansion internally and externally. The roof has been re-slated and some replacement or repair has been carried out to the stonework, harling and guttering. A large number of rooms are no longer used, particularly on the ground and second floors. The mansion house is not open to the public but walks can be taken through the estate. Several of the cottages are hired out as holiday lets, including one of the lodge houses.

It lies near the Ilm river. History There was a monastery in the village, thought to have been founded by pupils of the Irish missionary Columbanus at the start of the 6th century. Saint Emmeram of Regensburg probably visited the small monastery around 650. The monks would not have lived together, but scattered in cells throughout the parish, which was extensive in the early days. Around 815 a Benedictine monk rebuilt the Ilm Monastery, which was endowed with lands in the region. The monastery was destroyed around 955 AD by the Hungarians. The inhabitants rebuilt the church of Saint Paul im Moos. The only remains of the monastery is the word \\"münster\\" in the village name. In 1030 Geisenfeld Abbey was founded nearby to replace the Ilm Monastey. A tower-like castle was built around 800, partly destroyed in 954-55, rebuilt in 1051 and in 1400 converted into a chapel. It was used by the people of Engelbrechtsmünster until 1827. The parish of Engelbrechtsmünster was the second largest in the diocese of Regensburg, and one of the best endowed. It had a number of churches and supported a pastor and several chaplains. In 1971 the village was incorporated into the neighboring town of Geisenfeld. A village renewal project was undertaken in 2010. As of 2012 there were 376 inhabitants.

Adair received her undergraduate degree from Mount Holyoke College in 1948. Adair married Robert K. Adair, a physicist, in 1952. In 1955, she obtained her doctorate from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She received her Ph.D. in a combination of two fields: sensory psychology and physics. Scientific work Starting in the 1970s, Adair conducted physiology studies as a fellow at the John B. Pierce Laboratory in New Haven to learn how humans and animals react to heat. This work led her to focus on the controversial area of microwaves and their effect on human health. Experimenting first on squirrel monkeys and then on human volunteers, she concluded that microwave radiation from microwave ovens, cells phones, and power lines is harmless to humans and animals. In 1996, she joined the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory at Brooks Air Force Base, Texas, as a senior scientist studying electromagnetic radiation effects. Awards and honors Adair was a fellow of several scientific societies, including the Bioelectromagnetics Society and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). She served as the secretary-treasure of the former. Adair chaired several IEEE committees, including the Committee on Man and Radiation and the Standards Coordinating Committee.

Heigl plays Jenny, a woman who finally decides to get married, but her choice of partner tears her conventional family apart. Jenny's Wedding was filmed on location in Cleveland from October 2013. An Indiegogo campaign was later launched to help raise money for post-production costs. The film was released on July 31, 2015 in a limited release by IFC Films. Plot Jenny is the middle daughter of a conservative Catholic family in Cleveland, Ohio. She is a closeted lesbian who tells her family that her partner of five years, Kitty, is her roommate. Her parents, Eddie and Rose, have always dreamed of the day their middle daughter will get married and are always reminding her about her biological clock and trying to fix her up with men. Jenny realizes that she does want to get married and have a family, and proposes to Kitty. She decides to come out to her family and her parents are taken aback that she is not only gay, but engaged to a woman. Jenny has the support of her older brother, Michael, who says he suspected she was gay since high school. Her younger sister Anne always felt that Jenny was their mother's favorite and is not so much upset that Jenny is a lesbian as that she lied to her all those years. They reconcile when Jenny asks her to be her maid of honor. Jenny's parents want her to stay closeted in front of their friends but she refuses, causing a big fight with her father. Her parents at first refuse to go to the wedding, but eventually her mother realizes that Jenny is the same daughter she's always been proud of and agrees to go. Jenny's father has a talk with his best friend the day of the wedding and finally also agrees to go, and both parents walk her down the aisle.

She also produced the film, along with Gail Levin and MM Productions' Michelle Manning. The rights to the film were put up for sale at the American Film Market from November 6, 2013. =Filming= Principal photography on Jenny's Wedding commenced on October 28, 2013 in Greater Cleveland. The film was expected to shoot in the metropolitan area for three to four weeks. Filming locations included University Heights City Hall and Cuyahoga County Councilman Julian Rogers's home in Cleveland Heights. Rogers and his family moved out on October 23 and the studio paid for a rental in Shaker Heights. Representatives from the studio had noticed the house and asked Rogers \\"out of the blue\\" if they could use it for filming. The family returned home in November. On November 15, Heigl was seen shooting some scenes for the film on Euclid Avenue in Downtown Cleveland inside the 5th Street Arcades Some filming was done at the Trinity Cathedral. Production wrapped in Cleveland during the same month. =Post-production= An Indiegogo campaign was set up to aid in post-production with Donoghue and her crew asking $150,000 to cover the costs of music, titles, color and sound. Lucas Shaw from The Wrap thought that some of the money raised would go towards taking the film to festivals, as, at the time, it had yet to secure a domestic distributor. The campaign ended on April 12, 2014, having raised $96,691. Release The film had its world premiere at the Outfest Los Angeles Film Festival on July 10, 2015. IFC Films acquired distribution rights to the film and released it on July 31, 2015 in the United States in a limited release and through video on demand a day later on August 1, 2015.

The disorder reached a climax on 8 November, \\"Black Thursday\\", when eight demonstrators were killed. In the aftermath of the violence the Greek Orthodox Church reacted by banning any translation of the Bible into any form of modern demotic Greek, and by forbidding the employment of demoticist teachers, not just in Greece but anywhere in the Ottoman Empire. The Riots marked a turning-point in the history of the Greek language question, and the beginning of a long period of bitter antagonism between the Orthodox Church and the demoticist movement.  Linguistic background: the rise of demoticism = Introduction of katharevousa = By 1901, the long debate known as the Greek language question had been underway for 135 years. Initial hopes that Ancient Greek itself could be revived as the language of the newly liberated Greek nation had proved illusory; modern spoken or \\"demotic\\" Greek had evolved far from its ancient roots, and the two languages were now mutually incomprehensible. As a compromise, a grammatically simplified version of Ancient Greek known as katharevousa glossa (\\"language that tends towards purity\\") had been adopted as the written language of the new state in 1830. This meant that the spoken and written languages were now intentionally different. It was hoped that written katharevousa would provide a model for imitation, and that spoken Greek would naturally \\"purify\\" itself by becoming more like this written form, and therefore more like Ancient Greek, within a matter of decades. To provide additional motivation, the current spoken or demotic Greek was widely condemned as \\"base\\" and \\"vulgar\\", the damaged product of centuries of linguistic corruption by subjection to Ottoman \\"Oriental despotism\\". After 50 years, spoken demotic still showed no sign of becoming \\"purified\\" into something more like Ancient Greek. On the other hand, katharevousa was proving unsatisfactory in use as a general- purpose written language. Scholars could not agree on its grammatical rules; and as a purely written language with no native speakers, it could not evolve a natural grammar of its own. Its Ancient Greek vocabulary could not be used to write about the objects and events of ordinary life without sounding stilted and unnatural. = Ancient Greek in schools = The problem was compounded by the educational system. Until 1881 only Ancient Greek — not even katharevousa — was taught in Greek primary schools, continuing the tradition of the Greek Orthodox Church, which had exercised an effective monopoly over education for centuries (the Church had always taught the ancient koine Greek of the gospels and the Divine Liturgy). The children thus had to learn to read and write in a language they did not speak, or even hear outside church. This had been acceptable in previous centuries, when the schools had concentrated on training future priests; but it could not provide universal popular literacy. = Demotic renaissance = By 1880, many were beginning to feel that katharevousa had outlived its usefulness. Kostis Palamas led the New Athenian School in a renaissance of demotic poetry; Roïdis pinpointed the deficiencies of katharevousa, and coined the word diglossia to describe the unhealthy split between the spoken and written languages; and finally, in 1888, Ioannis Psycharis published My Journey, which transformed the language debate. = Psycharis and My Journey = Psycharis proposed the immediate abandonment of katharevousa and the adoption of demotic for all written purposes. But he did not reject the relationship with Ancient Greek; on the contrary, as an evolutionary linguist, he argued that spoken demotic really was Ancient Greek, merely two thousand years further along in its evolutionary history. As a Neogrammarian, he believed that the essence of language was passed on by speech rather than writing, and he regarded katharevousa as an artificial construct rather than a true language. Many agreed with him up to this point. But Psycharis went further. If demotic were to be used as the written language of a modern state, it would need a larger technical vocabulary. Educated everyday speech in the 1880s simply borrowed such terms from written katharevousa (for example: the word , \\"evolution\\", was altered to to conform to the morphology of spoken demotic). Psycharis rejected all such borrowings. Instead, he coined the word , which he claimed was the word spoken Greek would have evolved for the concept of evolution if it had been free of the corrupting influence of katharevousa. He created many such words on the same principle; his declared aim was to set up a revitalized, scientifically derived demotic as a new written standard based entirely on the spoken language, isolated from katharevousa and independent of it. Some found the new coinages ugly and unnatural: \\"Psycharis' versions sounded like mispronunciations of learned words by uneducated people, who would be unlikely to be familiar with many of these words in the first place.\\" Others were inspired by Psycharis' vision and became enthusiastic supporters of his version of demotic. Notable among these was Alexandros Pallis, who was to play a leading part in the events surrounding the Gospel Riots. Psycharis is widely credited with turning demoticism from an idea into a movement, which steadily gained strength during the 1890s. Although he met some opposition, it was at first mainly good-humoured, constructive, and centred on linguistic and cultural issues. = Linguistic situation in 1896 = By 1896, the situation might be summarized as follows: Ancient Greek was established firmly in the Church, in secondary schools, and also in primary schools (with some katharevousa there since 1881). Katharevousa was still used for every kind of administration and for non-fiction literature, but in prose fiction it was just beginning to give way to demotic. In poetry, demotic had taken the lead. The supporters of katharevousa were on the defensive, but the demoticist movement was split between the \\"extreme\\" demoticists spearheaded by Psycharis and Pallis, and the \\"moderate\\" demoticists who were less doctrinaire, and much more tolerant of borrowing from katharevousa (it was these moderates who would finally win the language debate 80 years later).  Religious background: previous gospel translations  The Eastern Orthodox Church had never had theological objections, in principle, to translation of the Ancient koine Greek gospels into a more modern form of Greek closer to the spoken language. \\"The first translation appeared in the 11th century and until the beginning of the 19th century as many as twenty-five had been published. Some of these translations were officially solicited by the Patriarchate at Constantinople, while others were the work of prominent theologians and monks. The main characteristic of these translations, solicited or not, was that those who undertook them were members of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Hence, they did not pose a direct threat to the authority of the church but merely a challenge, aiming at making it more open-minded and receptive to the changing times.\\" This situation, however, began to change in the years following 1790, with the expansion in number and reach of the Protestant missionary societies. These societies opened missions all over Greece, the Levant, and the Near East, bringing with them (especially after 1830) new translations into the local vernacular languages. The Eastern Orthodox Church regarded these Protestant-sponsored translations as attempts at proselytism, and therefore as a direct threat to its religious authority. Accordingly, in 1836 and 1839 two encyclicals were issued by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (and approved by the newly independent Autocephalous Church of Greece) commanding that all translations undertaken by \\"enemies of our faith\\" should be confiscated and destroyed. At the same time, all previous translations, even if undertaken by \\"our co-religionists\\", were condemned. These measures were successful in curbing the activities of the Protestant missions. However, the fact still remained that most Greeks could not understand the Gospels in their Ancient Greek form, a problem that had been publicly recognised by some senior figures in the Orthodox Church at least since Theotokis had published his Kyriakodromion in prototype katharevousa in 1796. Accordingly, some scholars within the Orthodox establishment continued to work on translations even after the Patriarchal encyclicals. Neofytos Vamvas The most notable of these was Neofytos Vamvas, head of the School of Philosophy, and later Dean, of the University of Athens. Vamvas had been a close friend and follower of Korais in Paris, and over the years 1831–1850, he led a small team of scholars in producing a translation of the Old and New Testaments into the \\"Pan-Hellenic\\" katharevousa of the time — not the spoken language, but close enough to it, it was hoped, to influence everyday speech and make it a little more like Ancient Greek. However, despite the thoroughly patriotic Pan-Hellenic ideals behind the undertaking, the appearance of this translation in 1850 sparked bitter controversy (not least because, in the absence of local Greek backing for such a \\"radical\\" project, it had been sponsored by the British and Foreign Bible Society). In the end, it was not approved for public use until 1924; but its very existence, and the high repute of its creators, kept alive the prospect of a \\"respectable\\" katharevousa translation of the Gospels. By the late 1890s katharevousa had completely lost the connotations of enlightenment republicanism it had carried in the days of Korais and Vamvas. By contrast with the more 'hairy' forms of demotic now in circulation, it seemed the soul of respectability and orthodoxy; and when the religious Anaplasis association requested approval for a translation of the Gospel of Matthew into \\"simple katharevousa\\", this was granted by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in 1896, and by the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece in 1897. The translation was published in 1900. After this decision it could plausibly be argued that the overall ban on translations announced in the encyclicals of 1836 and 1839 was no longer in force. Queen Olga's translation of the Gospels=Origin of the translation= Queen Olga Olga Constantinovna had served as Queen Consort of the Hellenes since her marriage in 1867 to King George I. Only 16 when she first arrived in Greece after the wedding, she had won the respect of her adopted country by learning Greek within a year and engaging in a wide-ranging programme of charitable and educational work, which did much to maintain the prestige and popularity of the Greek monarchy. However, as the decades passed and the 'Bulgarian threat' loomed larger in the North, her close family ties to the Romanov dynasty of Russia began to make her an object of suspicion to those who saw, or claimed to see, Pan-Slavic conspiracies behind every setback. After the trauma of Black '97 these rumours of conspiracy became much more widespread, and therefore more useful to political opponents of the monarchy. Queen Olga undertook her translation of the Gospels from the best of motives. In the aftermath of Black '97, she had spent much time in the military hospitals, at the bedsides of the wounded soldiers of the defeated army. However, when she tried to raise their spirits by reading the Gospels to them, she discovered that few could understand the Ancient Greek words; they called it \\"deep Greek for the learned\\". The Queen was used to taking the initiative in charitable and educational work, and decided at once that the Gospels must be translated into \\"the language of the people, the language that we all speak\\". She commissioned Ioulia Somaki, her private secretary, to do the actual translation; and the manuscript was complete by December 1898. =Pre-publication consultation= The Queen now assembled a small advisory committee to edit Somaki's manuscript, consisting of Professors Pantazidis and Papadopoulos of the University of Athens, and , Metropolitan of Athens and president of the Holy Synod. She also sent the manuscript to the Synod itself with a request for formal approval. After long delays and several exchanges of letters, the Synod decided not to give this approval, and instructed Prokopios to explain to the Queen why it \\"could not do anything else in regard to the matter\\". Prokopios II, Metropolitan of Athens, in 1901 However, Prokopios failed to dissuade the Queen, and indeed eventually gave her unofficial permission to proceed. Prokopios' motives in this affair have been the subject of much speculation. An eminent religious scholar and administrator, he was also the personal tutor of the royal couple's children, and in 1896 had been appointed, not elected, as Metropolitan of Athens on the insistence of the Queen, an appointment which \\"had raised more than a few eyebrows among high-ranking clergymen\\". Whatever the reasons, it seems that he found it impossible to say a definite no to the Queen. The reasons why the Synod approved the Anaplasis translation, but not the Queen's, are also unknown; the archives are not available. It was probably not a katharevousa-versus-demotic linguistic issue, since the actual demotic language of Somaki's manuscript received hardly any criticism, or indeed mention, from even the most outspoken opponents of the translation. It seems likely that the decision stemmed from suspicion of the Queen (as a possible agent of the Pan-Slavic 'foreign finger') and of Prokopios (as a possible agent of the Queen). The Queen also sent copies of the manuscript to a number of university professors, mainly theologians, with requests for comment. She received a wide variety of replies, ranging from dismissive to encouraging, and the ensuing debate began to attract public interest. Finally, the Queen consulted the government. \\"Hoping to acquire the government's sanction for the circulation and distribution of Somaki's translation in primary schools, Her Majesty approached the Minister of Religious and Public Instruction, Antonios Momferatos. Momferatos argued that before such a step was taken, the translation would have to be approved by the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece. He did, however, suggest to the Queen that should the Synod refuse to give its approval, the government would probably not prohibit the publication of an unofficial version of the translated Gospels.\\" On this basis — no official religious or political approval, but also no explicit prohibition — the Queen decided to proceed with publication in early 1901. =Pre- publication opposition= The Queen's wide-ranging consultations made the project common knowledge well before the publication date, and a heated debate ensued in the Athenian newspapers of 1899. Some supported her, but a vociferous majority were opposed, explicitly linking her translation with the Bulgarian threat in the North: This assertion that the \\"Bulgarian-speaking Greeks\\" (or 'Bulgarians', as they mostly now regarded themselves) of the disputed Macedonian territories would soon be demanding a translation of their own was disingenuous; they were already using a Bulgarian translation, and had been ever since the establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate in 1870. But few cared about such details. The point was that the Queen had touched a nerve when she \\"declared\\" so publicly that ordinary Greeks found Ancient Greek \\"incomprehensible\\". \\"The translation of the Bible into Modern Greek implied that the modern language was sufficiently different from the ancient language that uneducated people could not read Holy Writ. This was an implication that conservative nationalists strenuously opposed.\\" Since the foundation of the modern Greek state in 1830 the government had maintained the position that Ancient Greek, in its simplified katharevousa form, was the language of the nation. The language taught (very ineffectively) in schools was full, un- simplified Ancient Greek (although the pupils were not told that they were learning an ancient language; they were told they were simply learning to read and write). Almost all published writing was in katharevousa, using vocabulary from Ancient Greek, and looking very much like it on the page. Judging solely from written materials, then, it might indeed appear that modern Greece used the same language as the old Byzantine Empire, and was therefore the true heir to its glory and its former territories. The uncomfortable gap between this constructed image and the substantially different demotic language used in everyday speech and thought by modern Greeks lay at the heart of the Greek language question. Even after the image began to crumble in the 1880s, many found it hard to let it go. There was an irrational, but lingering and very deep-rooted feeling that if the nation loosened its hold on Ancient Greek even a little, it would risk losing its claim on the ancient Byzantine territories forever; and this is what led the conservative nationalists to deny so strenuously the very existence of a gap between the ancient and modern languages. The demoticists, who held the common-sense view that better rifles and a reformed army would be of more use in the coming Macedonian Struggle than a proficiency in Ancient Greek, were still very much a political minority in 1899. Other opponents had different motives. In the early decades of the 20th century a general anti-monarchist sentiment was widespread in Greece, rising and falling with political events. Immediately after Black '97, \\"A wave of anti-dynastic feeling, not based on any ideological conviction, swept the country culminating in an unsuccessful attempt on the king's life on 14 February 1898.\\" King George responded by touring the country to rally support; the Queen insisted on continuing her engagements without a military guard; and openly anti-monarchist activity died down again. But the translation offered an opportunity to attack the monarchy indirectly, without explicitly naming the King or the Queen. In some cases party politics were involved. \\"It is no great coincidence that the individual who expressed in the severest tones his disapproval of the translation was Nikolaos D. Levidis, one of the most vociferous leaders of the Opposition. Therefore, political demagogy and its probable electoral gains should be considered instrumental in motivating individuals in their opposition to Olga's translation.\\" There may also have been an element of anti-feminism. \\"The fact that this translation was the work of two women may have been one of the factors that contributed to the furore that greeted its publication.\\" It is remarkable, in view of the storm of condemnation that later descended on Pallis' translation, that the one thing hardly criticised by anyone was the actual language of Somaki's translation, \\"a rather conservative variety of Modern Greek\\", with none of the innovations favoured by Psycharis' 'hairy' wing of the demotic movement. \\"It is characteristic that the work, with minor exceptions, was not attacked for any literary or linguistic inadequacies, nor did the main Purists take active part in the debate.\\" =Publication in February 1901= Publication of the initial print run of 1000 copies, at the beginning of February 1901, came as something of an anticlimax. The translation was presented as a study aid \\"for exclusive family use\\" at home; at the insistence of Prokopios it had been printed as a parallel text, with the koine original and the demotic translation on facing pages. According to the one-page preface, probably written by the Queen herself, the work was intended to reach out to those who could not understand the original, and help them not to lose faith. The preface also reminded readers that the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople had already given its approval to the Anaplasis translation. The book was priced at one drachma, far below the cost of production, and immediately began to sell steadily. There were no public protests or demonstrations. It was noticeable that \\"... opposition preceded instead of following the publication of the translation. Once the work came out all talk about it receded ... one can only speculate about the reasons for this sudden silence ...\\" Evidently, it was the declaration of the need for the translation that had been the provocative act, rather than the translation itself. By the end of March the book had sold so well that the Queen began to think of bringing out a new edition; and for the next five months, Queen Olga's translation dropped out of the news. Alexandros Pallis' translation of the Gospels=Origin of the translation= Alexandros Pallis was a member of Psycharis' inner circle, and an enthusiastic user and promoter of his new 'scientifically derived demotic'. This put Pallis firmly on the 'hairy' wing of the demoticist movement. The term malliaroi ('hairies') had come into use in late 1898, as a jocular term for demoticists, particularly the extreme demoticists on Psycharis' wing of the movement, because of their (alleged) habit of wearing their hair long. The word remained in use for the next century, with writers and their works being assessed according to their degree of 'hairiness'. Before Black '97, the same scale had been described more politely as 'Hellenic' at the traditional end and 'Romaic' at the other; but now the language debate had become less abstract and more personal. Pallis was a merchant and businessman, working for the Ralli Brothers in Manchester, Liverpool and Bombay; his career in the company was long and successful, and he eventually became a partner and director. He used some of his considerable wealth to fund various demotic literary activities, publishing work by several demotic prose writers, and in particular helping to finance the newspaper Akropolis, which had been printing pieces in demotic since its founding in 1883. It was Akropolis which in late 1901 would publish his Gospel translation. Pallis had also published his own work, starting in 1892 with the first part of his translation of the Iliad; this was more uncompromisingly demotic than earlier (1875–1881) version of the Odyssey, and already showed the influence of My Journey, published only four years before. Pallis was making a particular linguistic point with his choice of material to translate: \\"Another purpose of his translations was to show that demotic was capable of embodying the spirit of the founding texts (and the highest peaks) of pagan and Christian Greek literature, namely the Homeric epics and the four Gospels.\\" As a devout Christian, he also had a moral and religious motive. Pallis spent most of his life working in the British Empire, becoming a British citizen in 1897, and came to share its general belief that all nations and peoples should have access to the Gospels in their own spoken languages. Finally he had a political, demoticist motive: \\"Most of all, his translation of the Gospels aimed to foster national, moral and political regeneration after the 1897 defeat, both by enhancing the prestige of the colloquial modern language and by democratizing and modernizing national culture and opening it up to the broad masses of the population.\\" Motivated as he was, Pallis saw little need for extensive consultations like those of the Queen. He naturally discussed the matter with Psycharis, who advised caution. \\"Psycharis was sensible enough to leave religion alone, and he had advised Pallis to do the same, arguing that it was provocative enough for the demoticists to be challenging the secular authority of katharevousa without challenging the Orthodox Church as well.\\" This cautious approach was typical of the demoticist movement of the time: \\"Also, although this was not stated explicitly, it was essentially a secular movement.\\" Up to this point, the demoticist movement and the Church had left each other alone; neither one had challenged the other. Pallis, however, was not dissuaded. It is notable that neither of the demotic Gospel translators of 1901 was a mainstream demoticist. The Queen was a traditional royalist and Pallis was apparently alone among demoticists in wishing to challenge the Church. Strongly motivated, and perhaps encouraged by the fact that the Queen's translation had been selling quietly but well since February, Pallis contacted his friend Vlasis Gavriilidis, the owner and editor of Akropolis, and arranged for serialised publication of the Gospel of Matthew starting in September. =Publication begins in Akropolis: 9 September 1901= Akropolis, a daily broadsheet newspaper based in Athens, was essentially the creation of one man, Vlasis Gavriilidis, who founded it in 1883 and played a major part in running it until his death in 1920. By 1901 it had established a solid reputation as the most progressive of Greece's newspapers and one \\"of the few which cultivates a taste for general, non-political articles\\". On Sunday 9 September 1901 (Old Style), the front page carried the first instalment of Pallis' translation of the Gospel of Matthew, under a full-width headline reading \\"ΤΟ ΕΥΑΓΓΕΛΙΟΝ ΕΙΣ ΤΗΝ ΓΛΩΣΣΑΝ ΤΟΥ ΛΑΟΥ\\", or \\"THE GOSPEL IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE PEOPLE\\". Front page of Akropolis, 9 Sept 1901 OS The translation itself occupied the right- most column, under a sub-heading quoting (in Greek) St Paul's words: \\"So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to understand, how shall it be known what is spoken?\\" (1 Corinthians 14.9) The long editorial, starting in the left-most column, was written by Gavriilidis himself and is headed \\"Akropolis is continuing the work of the Queen\\". However, it placed Pallis' version in a very different social setting from that of the Queen. In Mackridge's words, this \\"provocative editorial ... placed Pallis' initiative within the context of the effort in Europe, initiated by the French revolution, to 'raise the lower classes'. The editorial claimed that all the social reforms that had taken place during the previous century had been inspired by the Bible. It continued, > Who amongst the peasants and the workers, who even among the merchants and > the clerks and all those who have not completed secondary education can > understand the language of the Gospels? No one. \\"What was perhaps even more provocative was that Gavriilidis explicitly dissociated the Bible from filopatria [love of one's country] and misleadingly associated Pallis' translation with that of Queen Olga. He ended by claiming: > Rarely, perhaps for the first time, has the vernacular language taken on > such a godlike gentleness and sweetness and harmoniousness as in the > language of Mr Pallis. It is as though one is listening to the tinkling of > the bells of a distant flock, such as those that first greeted the Birth of > Christ. =Opposition= The new translation met immediate opposition that only gathered strength as the weeks passed. \\"Pallis' translation was vehemently attacked by most sections of the Athenian press, by the Ecumenical Patriarchate, by the Theological School of the University of Athens, by the parties of the Opposition, by leading Purists, by countless other institutions, societies and individuals alike, and eventually by the Holy Synod of Greece. The translation was considered anti-religious, anti-national, full of vulgar words, degrading the true spirit and meaning of the Gospel. The accusations levelled against Pallis himself were equally devastating. He was called a traitor; one who had no patrida [homeland]; an agent of Pan-Slavism; a foolish and despicable merchant of ivory and indigo; a sleazy person who alongside the malliari ['hairies'] was attempting to dislodge katharevousa as the official language of the state; an evil little creature who ought to be excommunicated.\\" Suspicions of Pan-Slavism Vlasis Gavriilidis in 1898, from Estia It is not known why Gavriilidis made such a point of announcing that Akropolis was \\"continuing the work of the Queen\\". Possibly he hoped to share the immunity from criticism that she had apparently been enjoying since February. If so, he took a great risk in associating himself with the Queen and her supposedly Pan-Slavist family connections; it seems that many took — or pretended to take — his introductory editorial as a declaration of intent to \\"continue the Queen's work\\" of Pan-Slavic subversion. All the old opponents of the Queen's translation immediately sprang to the attack again with redoubled energy, since Pallis and Gavriilidis had struck the same nerve as the Queen: the gap between the spoken and written languages. The format of the Queen's book had only implied that some of the least educated might need a little help with written Ancient Greek; now Gavriilidis had announced on a front page that a majority of the population could not understand it at all. The fact that this was true did nothing to diminish the reawakened fury of the conservative nationalists. Gavriilidis, however, continued to insist on the link with the Queen. \\"Throughout the whole of October, in the columns of Akropolis, he continued emphatically to link Pallis' translation with that of Queen Olga, pointing out that the former was merely the continuation of the latter. In fact, he phrased his articles in a way that implied that the Queen herself was actually behind Pallis' translation.\\" This only served to confirm the popular suspicion that Pallis' translation was the next step in some Pan- Slavic master-plan. By November the two very different translations had become inextricably linked in the public mind; they would now stand or fall together. Suspicions of foreign Protestant influence Pallis' translation, however, while still subject to all the old criticisms that had been directed at the Queen's work, also attracted new kinds of political, linguistic and personal attack. His long residence in the British Empire aroused suspicions of British influence, and his adopted British nationality laid him open to the accusation of being a traitor, \\"one who had no patrida\\". British influence in itself would not have been too threatening, since Britain had always been a reliable supporter of the young Greek state; but the British were predominantly Protestant, and the thought of a Protestant 'foreign finger' awoke memories of the 1830s threat from the missionary societies that had brought about the ban on Bible translations in the first place. Although Pallis was an Orthodox believer, he had certainly \\"developed anti-clerical leanings and had come to believe that the sacred texts of Christianity should be available to all people in their own language for their own private study.\\" To the Orthodox Church, these seemed suspiciously similar to Protestant views, coming as they did from a British citizen. Linguistic criticism The actual language of the translation also provoked widespread criticism. It was not just demotic, but Psycharis' 'scientifically derived' demotic; and Pallis did not seem to realise that many of Psycharis' innovations, while perhaps charming and natural in the chatty reminiscences of My Journey, might seem out of place and even offensive in the context of a holy book. Psycharis' rigid linguistic rules did not allow for a change of register to a more elevated style. In fact, any such change was deprecated as contamination from katharevousa. \\"Many readers were shocked by the sheer novelty of seeing a familiar text in the unfamiliar guise of a highly colloquial and sometimes idiosyncratic variety of their language. Protestors objected, for example, to the rendering of 'Mount of Olives' by the folksy-sounding 'Ελαιοβούνι' instead of the original 'Ορος των Ελαιών'.\\" As the weeks passed and the dispute became more heated, some opponents began to invent further 'examples'. For Luke 23.4, \\"Remember me, Lord, when thou comest into thy kingdom\\", the Ancient Greek is 'Μνήσθητί μου, Κύριε, όταν έλθης εν τη βασιλεία σου'. A rumour began to circulate that Pallis had translated this as 'Θυμήσου με, αφεντικό, όταν έρθεις στα πράματα', which might be rendered as \\"Remember me, boss, when you get in\\". This was completely false. The rumour, however, spread faster than the truth. As demonstrations began in the streets and opinion became more polarised, some conservatives began to take up extreme positions. \\"In the Greek Parliament a former minister of Religious Affairs and Education, Konstantinos Papamichalopoulos, likened the demonstrations to the national insurrection of 1821: the demonstrators, he asserted, driven by 'divine inspiration', had risen up in defence of the 'divine language', which was no less sacred than religion itself.\\" This position — that the whole of the Ancient Greek language was uniquely sacred, and specially designed by the Christian God — was quite new. The Ancient Greek revival movement of the early 1800s had viewed it in a much more humanist spirit, as the language of Greek civilisation as a whole. In 1853 Soutsos, one of the most enthusiastic revivalists, had declared \\"that the hearts and minds of the modern Greeks will be elevated by writing Ancient Greek, and that they will thereby learn Truth and Freedom\\". There had been no mention of God. It is notable that the most extravagant claims for the divine quality of Ancient Greek came just as it was losing its privileged position in society.

The process involves dipping the substrate in a water solution containing nickel salt and a boron-containing reducing agent, such as an alkylamineborane or sodium borohydride. It is a type of electroless nickel plating. A similar process, that uses a hypophosphite as a reducing agent, yields a nickel- phosphorus coating instead. Unlike electroplating, electroless plating processes in general not require passing an electric current through the bath and the substrate; the reduction of the metal cations in solution to metallic is achieved by purely chemical means, through an autocatalytic reaction. Thus electroless plating creates an even layer of metal regardless of the geometry of the surface – in contrast to electroplating which suffers from uneven current density due to the effect of substrate shape on the electric field at its surface. Moreover, electroless plating can be applied to non-conductive surfaces. The plating bath usually contains also buffers, complexants, and other control chemicals. History Electroless nickel-boron plating developed as a variant of the similar nickel-phosphorus process, discovered accidentally by Charles Adolphe Wurtz in 1844. In 1969, Harold Edward Bellis from DuPont filed a patent for a general class of electroless plating processes using sodium borohydride, dimethylamine borane, or sodium hypophosphite, in the presence of thallium salts, thus producing a metal- thallium-boron or metal-thalium-phosphorus; where the metal could be either nickel or cobalt. The boron or phosphorus contents was claimed to be variable from 0.1 to 12%, and that of thallium from 0.5 to 6%. The coatings were claimed to be \\"an intimate dispersion of hard trinickel boride () or nickel phosphide () in a soft matrix of nickel and thallium\\". Several versions of the process were patented by Charles Edward McComas in the following years: * Bellis's formulation was modified by adding stronger chelating agents (\\"Generation 1\\"). A method for applying nickel-thallium-boron to titanium without fatiguing the titanium substrate was also developed and commercialized by Purecoat International under the brand \\"NiBRON\\". * In 1986, McComas patented an improved formulation (\\"Generation 2\\") for nickel-cobalt-thallium- boron coating, that further increased stability and repeatability of the process. The patent claims that the coating consisted of \\"hard, amorphous alloy nodules of high nickel content dispersed or rooted in a softer alloy of high cobalt content\\". * In 1994 McComas developed another formulation (\\"Generation 3\\"), patented in 1998, that allowed consumed chemicals to be replenished during the plating, making it into a continuous process rather than a batch one. * A further improvement, patented by McComas in 2000 (\\"Generation 4\\") used lead tungstate as the stabilizer in place of thallium sulfate, at a pH of 10 to 14. This formulation has been commercialized by UCT Coatings under various brand names, including UltraCem and FailZero. Types The earliest variants of electroless nickel-boron plating included thallium salts in the plating bath, and actually created nickel-thallium-boron coatings (\\"Type 1\\" in the AMS classification). Eventually formulations were devised that were free from the toxic thallium ingredients, resulting in true nickel- boron (\\"Type 2\\") coatings. Characteristics As-plated grains of amorphous nickel boron deposit in a columnar structure with the columns being perpendicular to the substrate surface and forming a nodular topography on the surface. Coating will contain 2.5–8% boron by weight. The nodular structure reduces surface-to-surface contact of two mating/sliding surfaces, thus reducing friction and improving heat dissipation. It is also claimed to reduces drag in both gas and liquid flows. Applications Actual and potential applications of electroless nickel-boron coating include saw blades blades, ship propellers, down-hole crude oil pumping equipment, bushings, thrust washers, paper guide plates, and greaseless guns.

Cold foil printing can be done two ways: the older dry lamination process common in the offset printing industry, or the newer, more versatile wet lamination process, which is dominant in the flexo label industry. How it works=Cold foil dry lamination= Using a standard printing plate, an image is printed onto a substrate with the use of an ultraviolet-curable cold foil adhesive. An ultraviolet dryer then cures the adhesive, which becomes tacky. Foil spools from an unwind and is nipped to a substrate. Foil sticks to the tacky adhesive on the substrate, and an image with a bright foil surface is created. Foil that does not adhere to the adhesive remains on a thin polyester liner, and waste is directed to a rewind spool. Because the adhesive is applied on press like a conventional ink, no expensive stamping die has to be created. Once printed, the surface of cold foil images may be varnished, laminated, or encapsulated in order to provide a hard-wearing, durable surface. =Substrates= Some printing substrates are unsuitable for cold foil transfer. The best results are obtained on glossy coated papers and papers with a smooth surface. Weights from about 80 to 500 g/m^2 are possible. Benefits The process does not require stamping tools, but instead uses printing plates, which are cheaper and can be made in a few hours. In contrast, delivery time for an engraved or etched stamping tool can be up to two weeks. More importantly for the designer, gradients and halftone images can be introduced. History=Hot foil stamping= Cold foil evolved from hot foil stamping. Hot foil stamping is mostly used offline when foil is required on a preprinted substrate, such as in the manufacture of greeting cards and special occasion ribbons. Hot foil is economical but very slow. The types of graphics that can be applied are usually limited to text and bold images. Hot foil is not usable with heat-sensitive substrates such as polyethylene, vinyl, or shrink film. In-line cold foil printer =Cold foil evolution= Cold foil takes the idea of hot foil stamping and makes it more convenient and cost-effective. The cold foil functions like an additional ink and is actually a UV-curable, very fast lamination adhesive and can be bonded in-line in a single run using a printing plate for either flexographic web printing or offset sheet-fed printing. It can be applied precisely with high resolution, even for fine structures such as raster gradients and thin lines. Typeface is legible from about 5 points upwards and has excellent edge definition. Cold foil printing needs smooth surface substrates for excellent image quality. Cold foil indexing As the cold foil market evolves, major players in the printing industry are finding ways to make the process even more cost-effective. By indexing cold foil, printers can reduce foil waste, reduce their presses' downtime, and in turn maximize their presses' efficiency. Uses Cold foil is most commonly used on products that call for a strong \\"shelf appeal\\", such as household consumables, cigarette cartons, wine labels, and cosmetic packaging. It provides a luxurious metallic look on higher added-value label applications.

Her father, whose family is of Cape Verdean descent, was a programmer and her mother, who is from the United States, was a guidance counselor at New Bedford High School, where Santos and her brother Aaron attended. After high school, she attended Harvard University. As a sophomore, she became a research assistant and traveled to Cayo Santiago, a small 38-acre island east of Puerto Rico. Cayo Santiago's monkey population inspired Santos and spurred her interest in the psychology of animals. In 1997, she received her Bachelor of Arts degree magna cum laude in psychology and biology and won the annual Psychology Department Undergraduate Thesis Prize. She continued her studies as graduate student in the Harvard Psychology Department, obtaining a Master's in Psychology in 2001 with a focus on Cognition, Brain and Behavior and then a Ph.D in the same field in 2003. Her dissertation won the Richard J. Herrnstein Dissertation Prize of the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences for “the best dissertation that exhibits excellent scholarship, originality and breadth of thought, and a commitment to intellectual independence.”  Career and research  In 2003, she began as an assistant professor in psychology and cognitive science at Yale University, earning tenure as an associate professor in 2009. Her research investigates the evolutionary origins of the human mind by comparing the cognitive abilities of humans and non-human animals, including primates and canines. Santos was Yale's director of undergraduate studies in psychology from 2010 to 2015. In June 2016, she was named the head of Silliman College, one of the 14 undergraduate residential colleges at Yale, succeeding Nicholas Christakis. Santos' Yale course, \\"Psychology and the Good Life” focuses on answering questions like: “What actually makes us happy?” and “What can we do to achieve the good life?” Her course has become the most popular class in Yale history and as a result, Yale has made it available externally on the online learning platform Coursera in March 2018 as \\"The Science of Well-Being.\\" As of November 2018, over 170,000 people from at least 170 countries have enrolled in the online course. = Featured work = Santos's scientific work has been published in journals such as Psychological Science, Animal Cognition, Developmental Science, Current Biology, Animal Behaviour, and Cognition. Her scientific research has been featured in outlets including The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Economist, Forbes, The New Yorker, New Scientist, National Wildlife, Smithsonian Magazine, and Discover Magazine as well as on National Public Radio and Nova. She is the editor (with Bruce Hood) of The Origins of Object Knowledge. She has been featured on National Public Radio, on Big Think, and—with her colleagues Paul Bloom, Tamar Gendler and Joshua Knobe she is a regular contributor to Bloggingheads.tv’s Mind Report. Santos has had to retract two scientific papers because of coding errors in her lab. = Podcast: The Happiness Lab = Since September 2019, Santos has hosted the podcast The Happiness Lab, which examines the latest scientific research on factors impacting our well-being and happiness. The show completed its first 10-episode season in November 2019, and has spent 126 days on the U.S. Podcasts Chart, peaking at No. 3. It's published by Pushkin Industries, the media company led by journalists Malcolm Gladwell and Jacob Weisberg, formerly of Slate magazine. Writing in the Financial Times, Fiona Sturges wrote: “Santos is the voice of sanity, not to mention scrupulous research. [She's] a warm yet authoritative host who shows us the contradictions in our psychological impulses.” = Honors and awards = In 2007, Santos was featured in Popular Science as one of the journal's “Brilliant Ten” young scientists. In 2008, she was awarded the Stanton Prize for outstanding early-career contributions to interdisciplinary research in philosophy and psychology by the Society for Philosophy and Psychology and the Arthur Greer Memorial Prize for Outstanding Scholarly Publication or Research by Yale University. In 2010, she was a featured speaker at the TED Global Conference in Oxford, UK. In 2011, she was featured as the Association for Psychological Science Presidential Symposium Speaker. In 2012, she was awarded Yale University's Lex Hixon Prize for teaching excellence in the social sciences, the highest teaching prize awarded at Yale College, and the American Psychological Association's Distinguished Scientific Award for Early Career Contribution to Psychology. In 2013, she was voted as one of Time magazines leading campus celebrities. In 2016, she served as the President of the Society for Philosophy and Psychology. In 2018, she received a Genius Award from the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey.  Personal life  Santos is married to philosopher Mark Maxwell.

It is a scheduled ancient monument, and probably dates from around AD 996 when a college was founded at this site. The decoration is of an extremely rare type, and has survived the effects of weathering comparatively well. It consists of seven bands, depicting vine scrolls, various animals, acanthus, and lattice- work. Kendrick (1938) considered the decoration to be unique; the only surviving example in England which demonstrated the southern continental Baroque style. He also thought (1949) that it illustrated \\"a taste for a crowded display of finicky decoration\\", which is also reflected in the later Stapleford Cross.

It was founded by William Carter, who started experimenting with automotive carburetors while running a successful bicycle shop. His first, cast brass carburetor could meter and deliver fuel more accurately than many competing units. He sold Carter Carburetor Company 13 years after founding it to American Car and Foundry Company, a firm older than William Carter. Carl Breer wrote that, upon learning that the Ball family (owners of Ball & Ball) was planning to leave the carburetor business, he set them up with Carter, which continued to produce the Ball & Ball basic designs used by Chrysler. Carter adapted carburetors for Willys Jeep four-cylinder engines, waterproofing them for water crossings and making it possible to keep the engine going even on a steep incline (the Y-S carburetor). Carter also produced the first American four-barrel carburetor, used for Buick’s 1952 straight-eight, and followed by the WCFB on the 1955 Chrysler C300. This was eventually superseded by the AFB and the AVS. The final Chrysler use of four-barrel Carter carburetors was the Thermo-Quad, which used a lightweight thermoplastic float bowl, on the most powerful Chrysler engines. Carter produced Rochester Quadrajet carburetors for their rival maker whenever demand outpaced Rochester's ability to make them. They were identical to Rochester's units, except the Carter name was stamped into the body. In Carter's final years in the early 1980s, they also produced Weber carburetors under license, such as the three-barrel Type 40IDA sold as replacements (or fuel injection retrofits) for 1960s and 1970s Porsche 911 S. In 1984, with fuel injection having replaced carburetors on most cars, the plant closed. In 1985 American Car and Foundry shut down the entire Carter Carburetor foundry, a year later ceding the PCB-contaminated property to the City of St. Louis. The plant became an EPA Superfund site. The site contains contaminants including TCE and PCBs that penetrate the topsoil to bedrock. In 2013 cleanup was estimated to cost US$30 million.

It operated from June 1969 to 1973. The racetrack served as the site for such events as the NHRA Spring Nationals and World Finals, and the Texas International Pop Festival in 1969. When it first opened, the Speedway featured a quarter-mile paved dragstrip, grandstands, and a distinctive control and observation tower. Later, a 2.5-mile road course was added, followed by a quarter-mile dirt course for motorcycle racing. The first event held at the Speedway was the 1969 NHRA Spring Nationals. The event was generally considered to be a successful debut for the new track, but was marred by tragedy when Funny Car driver Gerry Schwartz was killed in a mid- track collision with Pat Foster. The track was also the site of another tragedy on Oct. 16, 1971 when race car driver Art Arfons crashed his jet- powered \\"Super Cyclops\\" resulting in the deaths of two onlookers and a passenger in the vehicle, WFAA TV news reporter Gene Thomas. A series of event rainouts, debt issues, and track maintenance costs combined to force the Speedway into bankruptcy by 1973, when the property was purchased for commercial development and the Speedway facilities were demolished.

It was first developed for use in the 2004 DTM season, replacing the Audi TT DTM at the end of the 2003 DTM season. Based on the Audi A4, it was continually improved over the course of six facelifts between 2004 and 2011. The Audi A4 DTM was succeeded by the Audi A5 DTM in 2012. Comeback as a factory team After the private Team Abt Audi TT-R was raced from 2000 to 2003, Audi re-entered the DTM series with a factory team since 1992. Audi's comeback resulted in a successful start and finish with titles for the driver, team, and manufacturer rating of the championship race. Technical details Like all DTM racing cars, the A4 DTM resembles its A4 production equivalent only in cosmetic appearance. The A4 DTM is constructed with a carbon fiber reinforced plastic monocoque chassis and an integrated fuel tank. Powered by a Audi naturally-aspirated V8 engine in partnership with Neil Brown Engineering for development, building, assembly, maintenance and tune-up role, it has a power output of approximately and a maximum torque of more than . The rear- wheel drive A4 DTM also has a sequential 6-speed transmission, a 3-plate carbon fiber clutch supplied by Sandtler (2004-2010) and ZF (2011), and an adjustable multi-disc limited-slip differential.

It was released as a single with the alternative title \\"Stand Up and Holler\\" under Nilsson's pseudonym Foto-Fi Four and was packaged with a synchronized standard 8 mm film of The Beatles first arriving in the United States in 1964. The rhythm of \\"All for the Beatles\\" is similar to that of \\"Not Fade Away\\", a Buddy Holly cover by The Rolling Stones, which was also based on Bo Diddley's song \\"Bo Diddley\\". The song, which preceded the later friendship and collaboration of Nilsson with The Beatles, was not a commercial success, but the single became a sought-after collectible. A cover version was later released as \\"All for the Beatles (Stand Up and Holler)\\" by The Originals.  History  The young Harry Nilsson recorded several songs by songwriter John Marascalco at a demo session for Scott Turner in 1962. He recorded and co-authored several songs with him; these were released as singles under Nilsson's pseudonym Bo Pete. The Beatles came first to the USA in February 1964 to promote their upcoming tour by appearing on the Ed Sullivan Show, as well as performing two concerts in Carnegie Hall and at the Washington Coliseum. Their arrival at the airport, some subsequent press conferences, and their concerts were filmed. Nilsson and Marascalco jumped on the Beatlemania bandwagon and took advantage of the Beatles' tour in August 1964 as a context within which to release their own song. The four-part vocals were recorded by Nilsson through multitracking. An additional track added the harmonizing screams of backing vocalists, which were, according to Nilsson's biographer Alyn Shipton, probably from Beach Girls, a girl group that had supported the Bo Pete record Baa Baa Blacksheep.  Release  A-side of Foto- Fi 107 with the note \\"Play this side with film\\" Marascalco released the song under his own BMI associated publishing company, Robin Hood Music, with the title \\"All for the Beatles\\". The copyright is not recorded at the Library of Congress. A standard 8 mm film, sealed in foil and showing clips of The Beatles recording in February 1964, was added to the 7\\" single, which was released under the alternative title \\"Stand Up and Holler\\". According to a note on the single and its sleeve, it is possible to play the song and film synchronously. Marascalco created a new label imprint called Foto-Fi Records for the release of \\"Stand Up and Holler\\", which was its only publication. Similarly, Nilsson used the new pseudonym Foto-Fi Four. The B-side of the single contained the same song but without the Beach Girls' backing vocals.  Form  The musical structure of \\"All for the Beatles\\" is a traditional 12-bar blues framework, which repeats itself five times. As an introduction, there are two bars of a major scale tonic, and in the conclusion, several bars of a tonic guitar solo up to the fade out. The first and last 12-bar figures are split into strophe and refrain. Nilsson presents the strophes single-partly, but the four-part refrain was recorded by overdubbing. In the centre of the five blues frameworks there is an electric guitar solo. The Bo Diddley beat The song is based on a Bo Diddley beat. This one-bar rhythm was well known when \\"All for the Beatles\\" was recorded following its use in the American debut single \\"Not Fade Away\\", a Buddy Holly cover by The Rolling Stones. This beat was introduced in 1955 by Bo Diddley in his song \\"Bo Diddley\\" and he reused it several times.  Cover versions  The Originals, Associated Artists 1464 The Originals recorded the song in the same year that it was released for the label Associated Artists. They used the title \\"All for the Beatles (Stand Up and Holler)\\". The song was released with \\"Will You Come Back My Love?\\" as the B-side. In 1965, Marascalco adapted the rhythm and melody of \\"All for the Beatles\\" for the song \\"Mary Mary\\", which was recorded by the Doo Wop group The Electras with a new bridge and lyrics. For the release of the song through Marascalco's own labels Lola Records and Ruby-Doo Records the Electras members Gary Pipkin, Chester Pipkin and Brice Coefield were listed as songwriters in place of Nilsson and Marascalco.  Reception  Neither the original nor the cover version of \\"All for the Beatles\\" charted. Alyn Shipton writes that the song \\"in itself [was] not particularly remarkable, but it [was] a harbinger for Nilsson's subsequent love of all things Beatles\\". The single and the film it was released with have become collectible items, for which prices of more than US$200 were paid in 2006. Shipton wrote that it was ironic that \\"All for the Beatles\\" approached Beatlemania by adapting a Rolling Stones hit. \\"Borrowing unashamedly from it was calculated to put everyone who heard it in mind of the 'British Invasion'.\\" Nilsson sang \\"in an Americanized approximation of John Lennon,\\" but the main guitar solo was very similar to that of Keith Richards. Shipton concludes that the song is the first real example of Nilsson's preference for overdubbing, which he perfected during his career, to take-up with the close harmony of The Beatles. The filmmaker John Scheinfeld used the song 2006 in his documentary Who Is Harry Nilsson (And Why Is Everybody Talkin’ About Him)?, when The Beatles were first mentioned.

He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on four occasions for his actions in command of the 6th (Service) Battalion, Queen's Own (Royal West Kent) Regiment from 1916 to his death in 1918, and Mentioned in Despatches at least five times. He was wounded in action at least seven times. Early life Dawson was the son of William and Ethel Dawson, of Cold Ash near Newbury, Berkshire. His father was a lawyer, and his mother also became a solicitor. His grandfather Henry Hill Dawson had served as a captain in the 19th Regiment of Foot. He was the brother of Colin Aufrère Dawson, who served as a Lieutenant in the mechanical transport section of the Royal Army Service Corps, and was the last solicitor at the family firm, Dawsons, that traced its history to Edward Woodcock, the first solicitor to register in March 1729. The first Dawson in the firm was William Hill Dawson in 1855, and the last was Colin Aufrère Dawson in 1958. The firm merged with Penningtons in 2011, and with Manches in 2013. Noel Dawson was another brother. His French middle name derives from an 18th- century Huguenot relative, Jeanne Aufrère, daughter of Rev. Antoine Aufrère, Marquis de Corville and minister of the French congregation at the Savoy Chapel; her daughter Sarah with Canon Balthazar Regis married William Dawson. Their son, also William, married a cousin, Sophia Aufrère. Through William and Sophia, Bob Dawson was distantly related to historian Christopher Dawson. He was educated at Bradfield College from May 1905 to Jul 1910 and Oriel College, Oxford. Army career Dawson studied law at Oriel College, Oxford. He was a Cadet in the Officers' Training Corps at Oxford University and joined the Royal Field Artillery in 1912. He transferred to the Queen's Own (Royal West Kent) Regiment in June 1914. Most of the 1st Battalion was sent to France when the First World War broke out in August 1914, but Dawson remained in England to help form a 6th (Service) Battalion. He was promoted from second lieutenant to lieutenant in September 1914, then temporary captain in March 1915. He served with the Royal West Kent Regiment on the Western Front from June 1915, in the 12th Division, and commanded the 6th Battalion from 1916 to his death in 1918. He refused staff appointments and the possibility of promotion to command a brigade in favour of remaining with his battalion, which became known as \\"Dawson's battalion\\". Dawson was often wounded, leading from the front. The unit served south of Ypres, at Hulluch near Loos, at the craters near Vermelles, was in reserve at the Battle of the Somme in July 1916, but joined the offensive on Ovillers, and then at Gueudecourt in October 1916. He became temporary major when second in command of a battalion in August 1916, and formally took command of the 6th Battalion in November 1916 as acting lieutenant colonel, aged just 25. He was promoted to the substantive rank of captain in December 1916, and in January 1917 was promoted from acting lieutenant colonel when in command of a battalion to command a battalion in the rank of temporary lieutenant colonel (with seniority from December 1916). He was wounded twice in 1916, He was wounded at Monchy near Arras in May 1917 but returned to command in August 1917. He was wounded again at Cambrai in November 1917. He returned to command in February 1918, and was wounded again in March in the German Spring Offensive. He was promoted to brevet major and returned to command in June 1918 for the Hundred Days Offensive. He was severely wounded by a shell near Nivelle on 23 October 1918. After a long period in the 20th General Hospital at Camiers, during which time he was visited by his parents, he died of wounds in December 1918. Although he had wished that his body should be returned to England, he was buried at Étaples Military Cemetery and is commemorated at St Margaret's at Cliffe His first DSO was gazetted in April 1916, with the first Bar in July 1917, a second Bar in June 1918, and a third Bar (posthumously) in March 1919 (and citation in October 1919).

He worked an architect in DerbyHe was at Osmaston Street, Derby in 1849: see ; in an advertisement of 1851 he announced his move to 57, St Peter's Street in 1851: and Dudley before moving to London in 1860, where he ran his practice from in Cornhill in the City. He was the Derby agent of the British Fire and Life Assurance Company. He became an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1854 and a Fellow in 1857. He was the author of Sanitary Reform: Model Town Dwellings for the Industrious Classes (1850) and a 36-page pamphlet entitled The Late Archidiaconal Visitation of Bromsgrove and the Injustice and Illegality of Visitation Fees. A two volume work called England's Operative Home was announced in 1851. His plans for houses for the working classes, as exhibited at a bookseller's in Derby in 1850, envisaged a block built around three sides of a quadrangle, with three storeys, each accommodating fifteen families. The dwellings were designed to be entirely fireproof, and ventilated by a system of Wigginton's own invention. Access to the upper floors was to be via two stone staircases, leading to open balconies which were carried around the quadrangle at each level. He was one of six candidates shortlisted for the post of architect and surveyor to the London School Board in 1871. The post went to E.R. Robson. Wigginton was a freemason, and a member of the Volunteer Corps, receiving a commission as Lieutenant- Colonel of the 1st Tower Hamlets Artillery, which he resigned on 29 October 1873.

History Sleep Party People was formed in 2008 as a project of Brian Batz, influenced by artists like Boards Of Canada, David Lynch and Erik Satie, starting a unique proposal of the Danish music scene. Since its beginning, the one-man project has been characterized by wearing rabbit masks in his photoshoots and live performances. Of course, Rabbit Voices. Contrary to the misconception that Sleep Party People is a band, Brian Batz is the sole member of Sleep Party People. Kaspar Kaae, Jacob Høegh, Ask Bock, Casper Hegstrup, Anders Stig Møller, Hans Hvidberg, Per Lyhne, Rasmus Lindahl, Line Felding, and Frederik Thybo have all performed with Batz in live shows. Batz explains in an interview with Motion Pikczer, \\"It's a bunch of good friends that's playing with me. So, it's not a band, it's just me and my bunnies, in a way.\\" Quickly gaining acceptance, Sleep Party People was featured in Soundvenue, a magazine covering the Danish music scene. After this, the record label Neh-Owh Records chose two of his songs to be featured in a compilation EP. In the end of 2009, Batz signed with the label A:larm Music. In 2010, he released his self-titled debut album with 10 songs. With this success, Batz was featured in Dutch and British magazines. In April 2012, Sleep Party People released a new album titled, We Were Drifting On a Sad Song. In 2013, they toured the United Kingdom. In 2013, Batz traveled to San Francisco to start to craft the third album in the company of producers Jeff Saltzman and Mikael Johnston. Batz recorded and wrote everything there and returned to Denmark with a nearly finished album. The album, Floating, was released in Scandinavia and Asia on May 30, 2014, and worldwide on June 2, 2014. Sleep Party People was signed by Joyful Noise Recordings in February 2017.

The founding members Scott Tyler (vocals, guitars), Adam Hoffman (vocals, guitars), and Matt Lipkins (vocals, keyboards)met at Emory University in 2008.  History = Formation = The band began at Emory University where Scott Tyler (from Nashville, Tennessee), Adam Hoffman (from Cedar Rapids, Iowa) and Matt Lipkins (from Larchmont, New York) met during their freshmen year in 2007. = Band name = Hoffman, Lipkins and Tyler decided on the group's name in 2009. The term \\"shadowboxer\\" can be defined as someone who makes the motions of attack or defense, and for the band it represents rhythm and method. The group is rhythmically driven, describing their sound as anything \\"soul\\". Their music is composed of substance, layers of tempos and harmonies. = Indigo Girls = The band was writing extensively, booking shows around Atlanta, and honing their sound. In 2010, Tyler met Emily Saliers, one half of the Atlanta-based Indigo Girls at a Passover Seder. The two began talking about music and Saliers asked to hear him play. Tyler picked up a guitar and played her some of his original material with The Shadowboxers. Saliers recalls saying when she heard Tyler sing, \\"I just remember being stunned by it.\\" The following week, Saliers attended a performance by the band. One year later, the band went on tour with the Indigo Girls, serving as their backing band and opening act for over two years.317x317px = Justin Timberlake = On December 3, 2013, Hoffman tweeted to Justin Timberlake from band's Twitter account, telling him he needed to check out their cover of his song \\"Pusher Love Girl\\". It caught his attention and Timberlake posted a tweet about the video. The trio met with Timberlake a couple of weeks later during his 20/20 Tour and he offered to mentor them and help them shape their sound. Later, he signed them to his artist development label, Villa 40, and in June 2017, the band joined Justin Timberlake and K-Kov at a studio in New York to record new music.

Two weeks later, Red Room was named as a top music pick from the New York Daily News. = Apollo EP = The Shadowboxers released an EP of original works titled Apollo on March 23, 2018. Included are previously released singles \\"Hot Damn!\\" and “Runaway\\" and features the focus track, “Timezone,” which debuted on Spotify’s New Music Friday playlist. = Singles = Woman Through The Wall  On May 5, 2016, the band released the single \\"Woman Through The Wall\\", which was co-written by Gabe Simon from Kopecky.

Runaway  On January 16, 2018, the band released the single \\"Runaway\\" produced by The Shadowboxers, Timberlake and Rob Knox. It was performed live on The Today Show and The Talk and placed on Spotify's United States Viral Top 50 playlist.

Finding A Problem  On August 9, 2018, the band released the single \\"Finding A Problem,\\" a personal song about the \\"recognition in yourself that maybe it's you not committing fully to something as opposed to everyone else.\\"  Telephone  “Telephone,” an ode to the Bee Gees seminal 1977 music video “How Deep Is Your Love” and co-written by Justin Timberlake, drips in nostalgia, from the band’s embroidered satin jackets to their recreation of the Bee Gee’s iconic back-to-back-to-back shot. For “Telephone,\\" The Shadowboxers (Matt Lipkins, Scott Tyler and Adam Hoffman) were inspired by the schoolyard game of the same name, where word travels from person to person, but is never quite the same as when it started. The single was released on October 11, 2018.  Runaway Acoustic  The acoustic version of the song \\"Runaway\\" by The Shadowboxers was released on November 15, 2018.  Timezone Acoustic  The acoustic version of the song \\"Timezone\\" by The Shadowboxers was released on November 15, 2018.  Last Summer  The Shadowboxers wrote the title track for the Netflix feature film, \\"The Last Summer\\" starring KJ Apa. The film premieres May 3rd.  In The Dark  \\"In The Dark\\" was released on October 25, 2019.  Honeymoon  The Shadowboxers wrote \\"Honeymoon\\" in the winter of 2017 with their friend Adrianne “AG” Gonzalez, while breaking from session after session of writing upbeat pop songs. The song was released on December 6th, 2019. The title, “Honeymoon” was something Matt brought in, and in trying to work out a song around the word itself, he and AG thought it’d be interesting to write a deceptively romantic sounding sad ballad. “Honeymoon” represents a lot of elements of The Shadowboxers identity that they haven’t showcased in years. Where in the past a lot of their music has been very bold and energetic, this song is vulnerable and honest. From its lyrics to its chord changes and melodies, it’s unafraid and unapologetic about its influences and its message. “Honeymoon” is skillfully sad. It feels heartwarming, but as the bridge hits, you realize that the entire bottom has fallen out of this honeymoon dream - “When I pulled back the curtain, she didn’t love me anymore.” I love when that dichotomy exists in any song and I particularly love the context of it here.  Won't Ever Say Goodbye  \\"Won't Ever Say Goodbye\\" was released exclusively via Billboard on January 22, 2020 and the single released worldwide on January 23, 2020. \\"The song lived in our heads and in our DropBox for a long time, but we kept coming back to it. The task of finally going into the studio to record it felt pretty daunting. Demo-itis is a real thing. But what we came out with really felt more honest and more uniquely 'us,'\\" The Shadowboxers tells Billboard. \\"From a production standpoint, this song is really hard to classify. It somehow feels fast and slow at the same time. It exists in this sort of slinky in-between space which helps you feel the dichotomy of the intense resolve of the song combined with a kind of subconscious melancholy.\\" The track features a groovy guitar cutting into razor-sharp pop vocals, as the group sings about not letting go of a significant other, divine echoing harmonies cooing in the background. It's a coincidental feeling for the group to be singing about, considering they're letting go of their sonic past to create this new chapter for themselves where they exhibit more creative control.

Adapted from the play Life of Riley by Alan Ayckbourn, the film had its premiere in the competition section of the 64th Berlin International Film Festival, just three weeks before Resnais died, where it won the Alfred Bauer Prize. Plot In Yorkshire, three couples—Kathryn and Colin, Tamara and Jack, Monica and Simeon—are shattered by the news that their mutual friend George Riley is fatally ill and has only a few months left. Thinking how best to help him, they invite him to join their amateur dramatic group, but rehearsals bring their past histories to the surface. When George decides to have a last holiday in Tenerife, each of the women wants to accompany him, and their partners are in consternation. Cast * Sabine Azéma as Kathryn * Hippolyte Girardot as Colin * Caroline Silhol as Tamara * Michel Vuillermoz as Jack * Sandrine Kiberlain as Monica * André Dussollier as Simeon * Alba Gaïa Kraghede Bellugi as Tilly Production Resnais said that he was drawn to Ayckbourn's play Life of Riley by its portrayal of a group of characters who are constantly mistaken about the behaviour and motives of the others and about their own; it questions whether people really match the descriptions which others give of them. Resnais also liked the challenge of Ayckbourn's device of having all the real action take place offstage with characters speaking about things which the audience never sees.François Thomas. \\"Entretien avec Alain Resnais\\", in Positif, no. 638 (avril 2014), p.15. For the third film in succession, Resnais (using his writer's pseudonym of Alex Reval) worked with the writer/director Laurent Herbiet on the screenplay of Aimer, boire et chanter, remaining faithful to the text of Ayckbourn's play (except for some shortening) and preserving its English setting in Yorkshire. He then asked the playwright Jean-Marie Besset, whom he knew for other adaptations of English dramatists, to write the French dialogue with his own rhythms and phrasing. In choosing four of his cast with whom he had previously worked (Sabine Azéma, André Dussollier, Hippolyte Girardot, and Michel Vuillermoz), Resnais was conscious of assigning them roles in this film which would allow them to give performances distinctly different from what they had done before. Caroline Silhol had worked once for Resnais many years earlier, and Sandrine Kiberlain was the only complete newcomer to his team. Most of his actors also had experience in productions of Ayckbourn's plays.François Thomas. \\"Entretien avec Alain Resnais\\", in Positif, no. 638 (avril 2014), p.16. Resnais wanted to film in a studio in order to preserve a theatrical style of décor which matched Ayckbourn's dialogue, but budget constraints made it impossible to build full sets of the houses of the various couples. He therefore took inspiration from his teenage memory of a stage production of Anton Chekhov's The Seagull for which Georges Pitoëff had used pieces of fabric to give minimal indication of settings. The designer Jacques Saulnier devised a series of painted curtains and simple props to provide a schematic representation of gardens, trees, or facades of houses. The sense of theatricality was reinforced by introducing the scenes with sketches of the setting by the cartoonist and graphic artist Blutch, alongside travelling shots filmed in the roads and lanes of Yorkshire.Jean-Luc Douin. Alain Resnais. Paris: Éditions de la Martinière, 2013. pp.242-243.Jonathan Romney, in Film Comment, 13 February 2014. [Retrieved 15 March 2014.] For the title of the film, Resnais chose Aimer, boire et chanter, to convey something of the spirit of the otherwise untranslatable original title. It is also the French title of a waltz by Johann Strauss II, which is heard during several scene transitions; and a vocal version with French words by Lucien Boyer is sung during the final credits in a recording by the tenor Georges Thill.François Thomas. \\"Entretien avec Alain Resnais\\", in Positif, no. 638 (avril 2014), p.19. Reception When the film was shown at the Berlin Film Festival in February 2014, it was awarded the Silver Bear Alfred Bauer Prize \\"for a feature film that opens new perspectives\\". It also received the Fipresci International Critics Prize for Best Film.Michel Ciment. Slices of Cake, at Fipresci. [Retrieved 15 March 2014.] (Resnais was too frail to attend the festival in person. He died less than three weeks later.) Initial critical responses to the film among English- language reviewers were divided between those who appreciated its light- heartedness and fun, rare among festival entries, and those who found it laboured and tedious in the theatricality of its format and the mannered style of performance. The latter view included judgments that \\"its overtly theatrical style will turn off most viewers beyond the director’s faithful few\\"Jordan Mintzer, \\"Life of Riley (Aimer, boire et chanter): Berlin review\\", in The Hollywood Reporter, 2 February 2014. [Retrieved 15 March 2014]. and that it was \\"little more than a lightweight piece of filmed theater\\" and \\"largely a superfluous footnote to the lofty career of its nonagenarian director.\\"Eric Kohn, Berlin review, in Indiewire, 10 February 2014. [Retrieved 16 March 2014.] Others appreciated the subtlety and wit in its direction: \\"The intellectual thrust of the film hinges on alienation — from both the text and the staging. This is a wry critique of the theatrical mode whose ample pleasures derive from minute touches which offer a reminder of how the camera, its placement and a delicate edit here or there, can charge a banal text with added emotion and import.\\"David Jenkins, \\"Berlin Film Festival 2014: Round-up Part 2\\", in Little White Lies, 13 February 2014. [Retrieved 15 March 2014.] And: \\"Life of Riley isn’t, as far as one can tell from the film, one of Ayckbourn’s most interesting or most formally inventive plays—the key conceit is that Riley himself is never seen but hovers in the background like a convivial Godot. But what’s fascinating is the amount of formal mischief that Resnais whips up. One running joke is the excess of establishing shots, of a singularly artificial variety: every time the scene shifts to one of the characters’ houses, Resnais shows us a cartoon of the place (by French artist Blutch), which then is replaced by a stylized stage-set version of the same locale, designed in dizzyingly distinctive color schemes by Jacques Saulnier, with gorgeously painted curtains standing in for trees, houses, background lawns alike....\\" A French critic, writing in English, summarised the director's approach in this late film: \\"Resnais inserts surrealistic touches such as the appearance of a mole puppet, and creates an uncanny feeling by using British props, newspapers, groceries and maps while the characters all speak French! At once rigorous in its stylistic devices and plot developments and wildly free, the film testifies to an artist who loves to play games, to give free rein to his imagination and, above all, to celebrate life, even in the presence of death.\\" ReferencesExternal links  * Category:2014 films Category:2014 comedy-drama films Category:Films scored by Mark Snow Category:Films about actors Category:Films about theatre Category:French films based on plays Category:Films directed by Alain Resnais Category:Films set in Yorkshire Category:Films shot in France Category:Films shot in Yorkshire Category:French films Category:French comedy-drama films Category:French-language films ","title":"Life of Riley (2014 film)"},{"id":"41512824","title":"Adam Bakri"},{"id":"41512842","text":"Bhagavathy Temple, Mudappallur Vandazhy is a gram panchayat in the Palakkad district, state of Kerala, India.

It is the seat of the Diocese of New Jersey. History The Rev. Dr. Alfred Baker, rector of Trinity Church in Princeton, New Jersey, has the first recorded mention of a cathedral for the Diocese of New Jersey in a plan he proposed at the Diocesan Convention of 1908. The Rt. Rev. John Scarborough approved of Baker's plan and established a committee of five clergy and five laymen to study the possibility of establishing a cathedral system in the diocese. A plan was proposed and adopted the following year and Bishop Scarborough appointed a Provisional Cathedral Chapter of ten clergy, ten laymen and the Chancellor. The Trustees of the Cathedral Foundation in the Diocese of New Jersey was established in 1913. Over the next several years resolutions to establish a cathedral were passed at the convention, including a scheme to raise the necessary funds. By 1915 Bishop Scarborough was dead and the Rt. Rev. Paul Matthews replaced him. Bishop Matthews saw the need for cathedral works, but not for a cathedra. However, he accepted the offer of the vestry of Christ Church in Trenton of their church as a pro-cathedral. He believed in this way people could visualize the diocesan and cathedral work. The Cathedral League was organized with the responsibility to further the work of the cathedral and to raise the necessary funds. The Rev. Baker was installed as the first Cathedral Dean in 1919. The former All Saints Church remains intact as a part of the Cathedral Complex. It was at a meeting of the Foundation on April 24, 1930 that Bishop Matthews mentioned a plan to make Trinity Church in Trenton the diocesan cathedral. The vestry at Trinity approved of the idea and Christ Church, which was only a cathedral in a limited sense, was not opposed. The necessary resolutions were passed by all the entities involved throughout 1930 and on November 1, 1930 Trinity Church officially became Trinity Cathedral. On November 20, 1930 Trinity and All Saints Church agreed to merge. The merger permitted the diocese to acquire land around the All Saints location for the location of the new cathedral. The Trinity property did not allow for this possibility. On January 25, 1931 Bishop Matthews was enthroned in Trinity Cathedral. The Rev. Ralph E. Urban was installed as the Cathedral Dean and the Rev. Hamilton Schuyler as Honorary Canon on February 23 of the same year. The Standing Committee gave its consent to Trinity Church to change its corporate name to Trinity Cathedral on March 16, 1931. The crypt of the present cathedral church was begun in 1935 and completed a year later. The cathedral itself was dedicated on January 24, 1954, and consecrated in 1965. In subsequent years the cathedral has become a parish church. Architecture The cathedral was designed by P.L. Fowler, Samuel Mountford and A.E. Micklewright in the Gothic Revival style. The roof of the structure reaches above the ground. The High Altar is composed of rose-colored marble and rests on two platforms of green Italian marble. In the north transept is the Caesarea Altar that features carved figures of the Twelve Apostles. The south transept contains the Elizabeth's Chapel that features 14 Russian Icons and a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary and child in a 15th-century style. The crypt below the cathedral follows the Norman style that is characterized by round arches and octagon- shaped pillars. The High Altar there is constructed of sandstone, with a reredos of limestone. It has depictions of Moses with the Tablets, and St. John the Evangelist. The former All Saints Church was built in 1896 and now serves as the Synod Hall. The rose window in the former choir loft contains symbols of the Holy Trinity. The former reredos in the back of the room contains the seal of the diocese and the shields of the Apostles. Images of saints and leaders of the church are depicted in the stained glass windows. The All Saints Chapel is also known as the Bishop Urban Memorial Chapel in honor of the cathedral's first dean. It features a carved Rood Screen that separates the nave and the chancel. On top of the screen is a depiction of the crucified Christ that is flanked by his mother Mary and the apostle John. The stained glass windows in the chancel depict the life of Mary. They include images of her mother Anne, her father Joachim, her cousin Elizabeth, and the Flight into Egypt. Old Testament prophets and saints of the Anglican tradition are found on the windows in the nave. The Stations of the Cross, also in the nave, were executed by an artist who was a Chinese immigrant. The tree bells located in the chapel spire were from the former Trinity Church. They were a gift from the City of Trenton in thanksgiving for the end of the American Civil War.

After receiving his Ph.D. degree from Princeton University in 1956, he joined the staff of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS: now NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology), where he was employed until his retirement in 1998. As Chief of the NBS Atomic Spectroscopy Section (and its successor organizations) from 1962 to 1998, he led the development of its reference data resources on the spectra of rare-earth elements, substantially increased its coverage of highly excited and ionized species, and pioneered the publication of NIST Standard Reference Data on the internet. Life Martin was in born in Cullman, Alabama on November 27, 1929. He received a B.S. in physics from the University of Richmond in 1951 and then pursued graduate studies at Princeton University, where he received a Ph.D. in physics after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \\"The energy levels and spectra of neutral and singly ionized phosphorus\\", under the supervision of Allen G. Shenstone. As a student at Princeton, he had some encounters with Albert Einstein, who lived near his lodgings. Martin served as an instructor in physics at Princeton during 1955–1957. In 1957 he was hired as a physicist by the National Bureau of Standards, where he spent the rest of his career, retiring in 1998 and remaining active as an emeritus member of staff until his death in 2013. In 1959 he married Dolores Moyano. They had two sons, Eric B. Martin and Christian B. Martin. Scientific Contributions In 1962, Martin was appointed Chief of the NBS Atomic Spectroscopy Section (later renamed the Atomic Spectroscopy Group), and his most influential work was done in that capacity and during his subsequent leadership of its successor organizations until 1998. The generation, curation and publication of critically evaluated data on atomic energy levels was a major scientific activity of NBS when Martin joined its staff. That program had resulted in the publication of three landmark monographs Widely known in the spectroscopy community as Charlotte Moore's tables, these monographs, which have been cited over 10,000 times in the scientific literature, tabulated the energies and other properties of atomic energy levels of the elements from hydrogen (atomic number Z = 1) through actinium (atomic number Z = 89), except for the rare- earth elements, cerium (atomic number Z = 58) through lutetium (atomic number Z = 71). Martin began a long project of analysis of the spectra of the rare earths that resulted in numerous research publications and a fourth monograph, that completed the NBS coverage of the periodic table up to the actinide series. In 1963, he established that the ground level of atomic cerium is of the form 6s25d4f 1G4°, in standard notation. At the time, it was widely believed that the ground electronic configuration of this element was 6s24f2, an error that could still be found in reference sources fifty years later. In the 1970s and 1980s, basic scientific advances, such as laser and plasma spectroscopy, and user needs, particularly those of the nuclear fusion and astrophysics communities, were generating vast quantities of new atomic spectral data and additional data needs, notably those associated with highly excited or ionized species. Martin and his co-workers initiated analyses that covered data from all ions of most second-row elements in the periodic table: *sodium. *magnesium. *aluminum. *silicon. *phosphorus. *sulfur. The culminating effort of this period was a major atomic spectral compilation, issued in print by NBS in 1985 under Martin's supervision: a 664-page compilation of all data known then, for all ionization stages of the elements potassium (atomic number Z = 19) through nickel (atomic number Z = 28). At that time it was clear that the vast expansion of atomic data could no longer be adequately disseminated by print publications alone. Many NIST data publications had been converted to magnetic storage media, which could be purchased from the NIST Standard Reference Data Program. In the early 1990s, perceiving the potential of the World Wide Web, Martin persuaded NIST management to allow free distribution of NIST atomic data on the internet. This was the first foray of NIST into free online data distribution, which remains in place today and has since been followed by other NIST data resources. The most comprehensive of the NIST atomic data products is the NIST Atomic Spectra Database (ASD). First placed online in March, 1995, it was serving about 60,000 page requests per month in late 2013. In addition to his many contributions to ASD, Martin was coauthor of The Handbook of Basic Atomic Spectroscopic Data, which contains data on spectra of neutral atoms and singly charged ions of all elements from hydrogen through einsteinium (atomic number Z = 99). He was also the architect of the NIST Periodic Table: Atomic Properties of the Elements, which has had over 100,000 copies distributed in its print version as of 2013. Another of Martin's abiding concerns was the accurate description of the spectrum of atomic helium. This spectrum is of particular importance as a calibration reference, a benchmark for theoretical calculations of atomic structure and of quantum electrodynamics effects in atoms, and for applications in astrophysics.

He held a considerable estate, including the manor Dubrovitsy near Moscow. In 1825 he refused the oath to Tsar Nicholas I and was declared insane. For the rest of his life he stood under trusteeship at Vassilyevskoye manor, which became known as Mamonov's Dacha. Biography=Youth. Literary production= His father was Count A.M. Dmitriev-Mamonov - Adjutant General and a lover of Catherine II. His mother was Princess Darja Fjedorovna Shsherbatova.According to some Mamonov thought Empress Catherine II to be his real mother. Vyazemsky remarks \\"Count Mamonov was a man gifted far above average, but spoiled by birth and auspicious circumstances. It was said, that he ascribed even to his birth a distinction which it had not and could not have had under the circumstances.\\". He was one of the richest landowners in Russia (in 1860 he held manors with 90,000 desyatinas in 10 provinces and 29 counties, 15,000 male serfs, more than 200,000 rubles in state papers, valuables worth more than 200,000 rubles, real estate in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and elsewhere). He was educated at home. In 1807 he was promoted kammerjunker; effective 9/21 April 1811, due to the patronage of the then minister of justice I.I. Dmitriev, he was ober-procurator of the 6. (Moscow) criminal department of the Senate. During these years he befriended Moscow freemasons, especially M.I. Nevsorov and N.I. Novikov, and quickly rose through the ranks, in 1807 being already Grand Master. Throughout the years 1811 to 1812 he published a cycle of poems in Nevsorov's journal \\"Friend of the Youth\\" (\\"\\"), influenced by the poetry of Bobrov and Derzhavin. In his literary work he joined the opponents of Karamzin - the so-called \\"archaists\\". He also studied the Pugaschev riots. =Military Service= At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War of 1812 he made a speech before the members of the Moscow nobility which left an epic impression. The text has not been preserved, though Pushkin later dubbed it \\"immortal\\". Mamonov offered the government to use his whole income for the war effort keeping back just 10,000 rubles a year for his personal use; further, he also offered to mobilise his serfs. The tsar thanked him for his offer and suggested he raise a cavalry regiment within the Moscow militia. On 23 July/4 August 1812 he entered the Moscow militia and participated in the battles at Borodino, Tarutinsk, and Malojaroslavets. The raising of the regiment, which was called after its chief 1st Mounted Cossack Regiment Count M.A. Dmitriev-Mamonov, went on only sluggishly, though the popular cavalry colonel Prince B.A. Svjatopolk- Tshetvertinsky had been named its commander. The regiment consisted in part of the count's serfs, but in part also of volunteers. The officers belonged to the Moscow court nobility. Among them was Prince P.A. Vyazemsky, who later wrote of these times: A Cossack of the Mamonov regiment Рифмы прочь, и перья в папку, И долой мой модный фрак, Я надел медвежью шапку, Я мамоновский казак. Away with rimes, quill pen into the portfolio, and down with my dapper dress- coat, I wear a bearskin, I am a Mamonov cossack. On 19/31 August the regiment comprised 56 commissioned officers, 59 petty officers, and 186 men, but had only 81 horses. Though the regiment had no part in any battles, it was used to keep up law and order during the army's retreat from Moscow and the crossing of the Moskva River at the Dorogomilovsky gate. Dmitriev-Mamonov himself was awarded for his courage at Tarutinsk and Malojaroslavl the \\"golden sword for courage\\".Сайт Министерства обороны Российской Федерации (Website of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation) As a consequence of the regiment's redeployment at Yaroslavl province, the loss of the ammunition bought at Moscow, and the pillage of Mamonov's villages the raising of the regiment was further delayed. At the beginning of January 1813 ten squadrons contained 60 commissioned officers, 96 petty officers, and 389 cossacks. On 12/24 March 1813 the First Cossack Regiment was reorganised into the Uhlan Regiment Count M.A. Mamonov, with 6 squadrons; he himself was made its chief and promoted major-general. In April the regiment was redeployed at Serpukhov, but during the summer it saw action. \\"The count was always conceited, but these accolades brought him over the brink. Furthermore he was never trained as a soldier and did not possess any of the necessary skills to lead a regiment. Irregularities and misunderstandings occurred. Even before the final deployment of the regiment he fought a duel with one of his staff officers, probably Tolbuchin\\", Prince Vyazemsky observed. In 1814 the regiment saw action and reached Fort-Louis in France. The regiment leader in his youthful inexperience failed to uphold the discipline among his men (already at the deployment of the regiment at Yaroslavl his cossacks had been nicknamed \\"mamma’s boys\\" instead of \\"Mamonov’s boys\\", and due to rioting an inquiry had been opened at Serpukhov); clashes with the Austrian allies and the local population occurred; a German village was burned down. On 27 August/8 September 1814 the Mamonov regiment was dispersed, he himself transferred to be the commander of the First Cavalry Corps under general F.P. Uvarov. After the cessation of hostilities he was with the commander of the Second Mounted Jäger Division. On 2/14 March 1816 he applied for discharge after a conflict with Tsar Alexander I, to whom he wrote a critical letter on the circumstances of his regiment's dissolution (officially he sought discharge for health reasons). =Social-political activity= In 1812 he established the Russian Order of Chivalry, at first a purely free-masonic institution, which, however, during the years 1814/15 under the influence of M.F. Orlov turned into one of the first pre-Decembrist organisations. He put up program documents for the order, in 1816 printing the pamphlet \\"Short Instruction for Russian Knights\\" on the premises of the Typographic Institute of the Moscow Imperial Medico- Surgical academy with a run of 25 copies (in French; one copy of the Russian original has been preserved). Mamonov's constitutional projects were published in 1906 by А. K. Borosdin. They provided among other things for the abolition of serfdom and the transformation of Russia into an aristocratic republic with a bicameral parliament (with a chamber of lords and chamber of deputies). One of the order's objectives was \\"to deprive all foreigners of any influence on the state affairs\\" and \\"the final overthrow, possibly the death of all foreigners holding office\\".Бороздин А. К. Из писем и показаний декабристов. — М., 1906. — С. 147. (Borosdin, A.K.: From Letters and Testimonials of the Decembrists) As a foreigner, however, \\"must be regarded within the Order also the greatgrandson of a foreigner, whose forebears from great-grandfather down to the father belonged to the Greco-Russian faith, served the throne of Russia and upheld their nationality without ever leaving Russia\\". This instruction was directed against Alexander I, who in Mamonov's opinion was a foreigner (para. 53 of the Instruction), being the great-grandson of the Holsteinian Peter III and furthermore often absent from Russia. As a means of the transformation the count proposed a military uprising. Dubrovitsy manor, where the count lived in total seclusion After his return from abroad in 1817 he retired to his manor near Moscow, where he lived until 1823 in perfect seclusion, only seldom venturing into town: \\"During some years he saw not even one of his servants. All he needed was kept within a separate room; there, too, he left his written instructions. The walls of his bedroom were decorated with strange pictures with cabbalistic, but also erotic scenes\\". In the opinion of contemporary historians the count showed signs of mental disturbance already in 1817, such as a proclivity to a secluded lifestyle, growing a beard, and wearing \\"Russian garb\\". Modern scientists, especially Y.M. Lotman, hold that an extravagant lifestyle of that kind as such cannot be construed as proof of mental weakness. Contemporaries and memorialists agree, that the count was of highly egocentric, proud, and irascible temperament, at all times emphasised his ancient noble lineage, and never thought it necessary to exercise restraint in writing to superiors. Furthermore, Mamonov was quite close to members of secret societies; M.F. Orlov visited him repeatedly in his manor. All that disturbed those in power, further incited by the information of M.K. Gribovsky on the activities of secret societies. Since the beginning of the 1820s, the count was under observation by the secret police. Emphasising his own independence he erected on his estate at Dubrovitsy, 35 versts from Moscow, at the confluence of the Desna and Pakhra rivers, a true fortress with ordnance and a detachment of troops levied from his serfs. In his open contempt for the Romanovs and their claim to the Russian throne, which he considered void, he kept in his home the banner of Prince D.M. Pozharsky and the bloodstained shirt of the tsarevich Dimitri Ivanovich - the ultimate symbol of the Rurik dynasty. Though they did not wear a princely title, the Dmitriev-Mamonovs were not therefore less proud of their descent from Vladimir Monomakh. The awareness of their Rurikid lineage was already in the 1850s present in the mind of one of the members of the Dmitriev family (a younger branch), the publicist M.A. Dmitriev, a nephew of the renowned poet I.I. Dmitriev. He wrote in his memoirs: \\"We derive directly from Vladimir Monomach, and this in the male line, not in the female line, like the Romanovs - these pseudo issue of our ruling family, who are not even Romanovs, but are derived from the Holsteins\\".Лотман Ю. М. О русской литературе. - СПб, 1997. - С. 350. (Lotman, J.M.: On Russian Literature) =Arrest and Stultification = In 1823 the count's valet died, and a new one was employed, the freedman, citizen Nikanor Afanassjev, a former serf of Prince P.M. Volkonsky, the Chief of the General Staff and one of the leaders of the political police, who had already been the recipient of Gribovsky's denunciation in 1822. In that denunciation he informed him on the unexpected reactivation of the Russian Order of Chivalry \\"long since deemed defunct\\" and openly named Mamonov. According to the son of the teacher of Russian literature in the Mamonov household, P. Kicheyev - the new valet rather than fulfilling his role as servant spied upon the count. As he suspected him to be a government agent, the count ordered him flogged. The victim turned to the Moscow Military Governor, Prince D.V. Golitsyn who immediately sent his adjutant to Dubrovitsy. When Mamonov sent him packing, gendarmes and soldiers appeared in the village, arresting the count. From that point onwards Alexander I and Arakcheyev took matters in hand personally. As Prince Vyazemsky reports: \\"he was charged with irregularities in the management of the estate, namely oppression of the peasants not as an absentee landlord, but by the actual management\\".:s:Старая записная книжка 81—90 (Вяземский) By imperial prescript Mamonov was placed under house arrest in his Moscow residence. Mamonov answered to D.V. Golitsyn’s threat to put him under trusteeship, with a furious letter, notably stating: …You are not empowered to put me under trusteeship and will not dare to do so, for I am neither under age nor insane, as I do not hesitate to submit serfs living in my house to corporal punishment, when in my opinion they deserve it: for the right to flog one’s serfs is immanent to Russian private and public law as handed down to us by our forebears. (…) Your Illustrious Highness must be aware, also in your capacity as citizen of legal age, that you are not allowed to threaten another citizen of legal age and imperial dignitary; and how dare you write something like this to me, a man who is in every respect - with the exception of the Table of Ranks - your superior!Дмитриев-Мамонов М. А. Письмо к князю Д. В. Голицыну от 23 февраля 1825 // Русский архив. — 1868. — Вып. 9. — Стб. 964—965. (Dmitriev-Mamonov. M.A.: Letter to Prince D.W. Golitsyn from 23 February 1825, in: Russ. Archive) At the end of his message Mamonov declared himself ready to sort out matters with the governor by a duel. On 28 February he wrote to his old patron I.I. Dmitriev asking him to act as mediator, but he had been in retirement for years and could not help him. A medical commission appointed by D.V. Golitsyn declared the count insane. On Golitsyn's request the cabinet decided on 23 June/5 July to put him under trusteeship. According to all accounts Dmitriev-Mamonov was an ordinary snob, eccentric and frondeur, but the government was apprehensive that the combined influence of his money, of his ties to conspirators in secret societies and Orlov’s options, who after all was in command of a division, might be sufficient to trigger an insurgency or even a coup d’état. During the Decembrist riots of 1825 the count, held hitherto in Moscow under arrest as suspect but not as insane, refused the oath of allegiance to tsar Nicholas I. From that point onwards cruel \\"cures\\" were applied, aimed at either making him relent or to drive him insane. A relative and one of his last trustees, N.A. Dmitriev-Mamonov, reports, that for the first time he was treated harshly and cruelly, proof of which are the straight jackets and strappings which I found thirty years ago with which he was tied to his bed,Дмитриев-Мамонов Н. А. Из воспоминаний: Граф Матвей Александрович Дмитриев-Мамонов // Русская старина. — 1890, апрель. — С. 176. (Dmitriev- Mamonov, N.A.: From my Memories: Count Matvej Alexandrovitch Dmitriev-Mamonov, in: Old Russia) whereas P. Kischeyev states, that the treatment began by pouring cold water over his head which of course drove the count raving mad.Кичеев П. Из семейной памяти: Граф М. А. Дмитриев-Мамонов // Русский архив. — 1868. — № 1. — С. 99. (Kischeyev, P.: From the Family Recollections: Count M. A. Dmitriev-Mamonov, in: Russian Archive) The Mamonov Dacha, where the Count lived for the last 30 years of his life in total seclusion, in 1913. He was not even allowed to visit the gardens. Since 1830 Mamonov was kept in strict isolation at Vassilyevskoye manor at Sparrow Hills, which had expressly been purchased from Prince Yusupov. In consequence of the long detention there of Count Mamonov it was named \\"Mamonovian Dacha\\" by the Muscovites. \\"Treatment\\" and abuse by the turnkeys did not remain without effect: People, who met the count during the 1840-1860 period, remember him as a lunatic suffering from delusions of persecution and grandeur. He died from gangrene caused by the constant wear of perfumed shirts. He was buried at the Donskoy Monastery at Moscow. With him the (first) comital line of the house of Dmitriev-Mamonov expired.

The film premiered in competition at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival. Plot Nana Kunning, a struggling mother of two young sons, takes her children to an isolated location. She, along with other parents and children, have come there in order to be seen by the Architect, a faith healer who builds small delicate structures out of branches and then brings patients inside them. The Architect works by lottery and Nana's son Gully, who has an inoperable brain tumour, is not chosen to be saved. Before the Architect can touch the winning patient, a blind boy, the falcon of Ivan (Nana's other son) destroys the structure. The furious crowd refuses to give Nana and her sons a ride unless they abandon the bird. When Ivan releases the falcon, one of the men shoots it dead. The Architect arrives at Nana's job at a hog farm, informing her that she healed the blind boy she touched, stating that he never touched the boy's eyes, while she did. Nana ignores him, but is later surprised when the man who shot the falcon comes to her, pleading that she save his child. The Architect trains Nana in creating the structures needed to heal people. To fix the legs of a little girl, Nana builds a swing. Her sons wait in the vehicle while she heals the girl, but Ivan grows bored and goes into the woods, where he sees his mother on the swing with the girl. Not understanding what he had witnessed, Ivan takes the vehicle and attempts to drive Gully home. He instead crashes the car onto an ice-covered lake. Ivan survives, but Gully drowns under the ice. Nana is crushed by Gully's death, abandoning 10-year-old Ivan to concentrate on her faith healing. Now 31-year- old Ivan is visited by journalist Jania Ressemore, for an interview about the falcons he breeds. When Jania asks him if he is still in contact with his mother, Ivan cuts the interview short. When Ivan learns that Jania intends to interview his mother, he decides to join her, leaving behind his own wife and child, and bringing one of his falcons. Jania and Ivan travel to Nunavut where they find that the road has been blocked by a truck accident. They continue on foot, across a large frozen lake. In the dark, Ivan begins to hear the ice cracking. Jania takes his hand, convincing him to walk step by step. They are picked up by a local man who takes them to his home and lends them his truck. On the road Ivan and Jania grow close. Eventually Ivan realizes that Jania is ill, and that she is making the trip so that Nana could heal her. The two fight, but when Jania tries to leave and see Nana, Ivan sends his falcon out to her. She stops the vehicle and waits for him to join her. When they arrive at Nana's isolated retreat, Nana does not recognize Ivan, thinking he is also a journalist until, during the interview, he asks how a mother can abandon her son. Ivan vents his pain and anger. Nana consoles him, telling him that it had been too much to bear. She puts something in his hand, saying it is for Jania. While the people hoping to be healed by Nana unwrap the stones they have been given, to see who has won the lottery to be healed, Nana tells a story of a man who fell under ice. While Nana is telling the story, Jania unwraps her lottery stone and sees it is green, which means she has not won. However, Ivan slips a white stone into her handswhich Nana had given him and Jania begins to cry with relief. CastProduction Filming took place in Manitoba, Canada, and Madrid, Spain. Reception and box office On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 17% based on 65 reviews, with an average rating of 4.21/10.

Its purpose is to advance the practice of clinical chemistry in Canada through the promotion of excellence in education, research and practice, by means of activities at the international, national, provincial and local levels. In Canada, clinical chemists are members of the medical laboratory management team that consists of pathologists, laboratory managers and senior technologists. They are primarily responsible for setting the standards of performance for the clinical biochemistry laboratory. They use skills developed through post doctoral training programs to ensure that laboratory services meet the needs of the patients while being delivered in an efficient manner. They monitor the quality of the testing services and act as technical experts to evaluate and select methods and instrumentation. They apply clinical and technical knowledge to assist physicians with the selection and interpretation of tests and to support the research and teaching activities of the laboratory. History The founding meeting for the CSCC was held in Montreal, Quebec on Oct 17th 1956. Since that time the membership has grown to several hundred clinical chemists and highlights of the society's accomplishments during its first 50 years were documented by Dr. Arlene Crowe (past president) in Clinical Biochemistry. In 1986 the Canadian Academy of Clinical Biochemistry was established as the academic body of the CSCC to oversee training, certification, accreditation, and professional development of clinical chemists in Canada. A syllabus for post doctoral training in clinical biochemistry was developed and is maintained by the CACB as a guide to program directors and trainees. Activities The CSCC holds an Annual Scientific Congress and Annual General Meeting.

Meeks (born October 30, 1970), a Republican, is the senior member of the Arkansas House of Representatives. He is from Greenbrier in Faulkner County in central Arkansas. Since 2013, he has represented District 67, which includes portions of central Faulkner County, including the cities of Greenbrier, Holland, Vilonia, Wooster, and western Conway. From 2011 to 2013, he represented House District 47. Meeks' brother, David Meeks, is a Republican representative for House District 70. Background Meeks was raised in rural Springhill in Faulkner County, Arkansas. In 1988, he graduated from Greenbrier High School in Greenbrier. Thereafter, he relocated to Florida where his father was transferred by an employer. In 1997, Meeks obtained an Associate of Science degree in Telecommunications Engineering from Florida State College at Jacksonville, then known as Florida Community College in Jacksonville. Two years later he procured an Associate of Arts from the same institution. A former educator, Meeks taught astronomy from 1997 to 2003 at Florida Community College and Elementary School from 2001 to 2003 at Baymeadows Baptist Day School in Jacksonville, simultaneous with his duties at Florida Community College. While in Jacksonville, Meeks was the president of the Northeast Florida Astronomical Society. A military veteran, he maintains a strong interest in astronomy, space flight, and amateur radio. He earns his livelihood as a computer technologist. Meeks and his wife, the former Jennifer Brickey, a Florida native, are members of Faith Baptist Church, a theologically conservative congregation in Greenbrier. They have one daughter. From 1987 to 1993, Meeks was a member of the United States Army Reserve. He was a combat engineer and a cargo specialist. Political life In 2010, Meeks was elected in House District 47, having unseated incumbent Democrat Eddie Hawkins, 4,841 to 3,921. In 2012, District 47 was reconfigured to include Jackson and White counties. Meeks won his second term in revised District 67 by defeating Democrat Sam Lane, 8,002 to 3,003. He was unopposed in the 2014 election for his third term. Meeks serves on these legislative committees: (1) House Revenue and Taxation, (2) House Agriculture, Forestry and Economic Development, and (3) Joint Budget. He is the House Chair of Special Language, a subcommittee of Joint Budget. He is also the Chair of the Advanced Communication and Information Technology Committee. In 2013, Meeks co-sponsored legislation to amend state income tax rates. He voted to place a spending cap on the state budget, but the measure failed in the House by two votes. He was the primary House sponsor of and successfully lead the override of a veto of Democratic Governor Mike Beebe to enact legislation to require a photo identification for casting a ballot in Arkansas. He also voted with the majority to override the Governor's veto on legislation that would ban abortion after twenty weeks of gestation. He supported related legislation to ban abortion whenever fetal heartbeat is detected, to forbid the inclusion of abortion in the state insurance exchange, and to make the death of a fetus a felony in certain cases. He voted to allow university officials to carry concealed weapons. He did not vote on a proposal to make the office of prosecuting attorney in Arkansas nonpartisan. He supported the bill, signed by Governor Beebe, to permit the sale of up to five hundred gallons per month of unpasteurized whole milk directly from the farm to consumers. He also developed legislation to create the most comprehensive light pollution law in the country, aimed at getting state and local governments to use cheaper, more efficient outdoor lighting. In 2011, Meeks in District 47 co-sponsored legislation that allowed religious institutions to choose to allow the carrying of concealed weapons on their property. He opposed a dress code for public schools. He backed curriculum standards for biblical instruction in public schools. He co-sponsored the Capital Gains Reduction Act. He voted to reduce utility rates on manufacturers as a means of attracting industry to Arkansas. Meeks abstained on the congressional redistricting bill. Without opposition, Meeks was re-elected to a third term in the House in 2014. In 2018, Meeks tweeted that in the United States, poverty is a choice, and that a homeless man could go to school to become a truck driver and be a millionaire in 20 years. Meeks deleted the post after receiving criticism. He later apologized.

Biography Born to a Welsh merchant working in Livorno, as a boy orphan, Llewelyn came under the care of an uncle. The uncle wished for the young man to study commerce, but instead Llewelyn chose to study (1894–1895) in the studio of Guglielmo Micheli where he met Modigliani, Romiti, Martinelli, and Ghiglia. There he also met Fattori, whom he followed to Florence.Pinacoteca Livorno short biography. He first exhibited at the 1897 Florentine Promotrice, with \\"Mattino al Calambrone\\" (Morning at Calambrone). He began painting sea- and land-scapes using divisionist techniques. He traveled to Liguria where he met the painters, including Lori and Discovolo, who had coalesced around Nomellini and became known as the Gruppo di Albaro, based on the hillside neighborhood where they worked. Returning to Florence, in 1907 he exhibited in a hall at the Promotrice Fiorentina, titled the Secessione (Secession), recalling other prior anti-academic movements such as the Vienna Secession. In this hall, Costetti, De Carolis, Ghiglia, and Graziosi shared the walls with Lloyd. In September 1907 he traveled to Elba, and the coasts were subjects of his paintings exhibited in the 1909 Venice Biennale. In 1914, he exhibited at the Roman Secessione along with a coterie of painters calling themselves the Giovine Etruria. In 1919, he published his book La pittura dell'Ottocento in Italia.La pittura dell'Ottocento in Italia. In 1922, he exhibited at the Fiorentina Primaverile and in 1923 at the Mostra della Corporazione delle Arti Decorative. In 1929 the Italian Navy commissioned portraits of its entire fleet from Lloyd. His works were exhibited in Spain, Portugal, and Tripolitania, and displayed at the 3rd Exhibition of Marine Art held in Rome. From 1931 to 1939 he exhibited a number of times at the Galleria d'Arte in Florence. Because he had maintained British citizenship, he was arrested and interned in a prisoner camp, first at Fossoli di Carpi, then in Bavaria, until released on the war's end in 1945. Back in Italy, he was hosted by Roberto Papini, who collected his recollections in a semi-autobiographic but posthumous volume titled Tempi Andati (1949).Tempi Andati.Biography extracted from: La pittura in Italia-l'Ottocento.

The first book, titled Legion, was first published on August 31, 2012 by Subterranean Press, followed in November 2014 by Legion: Skin Deep, and in September 2018 by Legion: Lies of the Beholder. The books have received favorable reviews.  Background  Sanderson wrote the first story on the flight home from France in the summer of 2011. It \\"came from an idea I'd been kicking around in my head for a few months, and the time seemed right to explore it on paper. When finished, I sent it out to my agent - and we had a Hollywood option by the end of the year.  Plot = Legion = Legion tells the story of Stephen Leeds, better known as 'Legion', a man whose unique mental condition allows him to generate multitude of personae. He is a brilliant problem solver, rich and quite good at what he does, helped by his hallucinations. However, he would rather be left alone, and that means no researchers or psychologists who want to get to the bottom of his abilities. But then Legion receives a letter with a mysterious, impossible picture, and he can't resist traveling the world to search for answers. He must track down a missing inventor who disappeared with a camera that can take pictures of the past. Helped by Monica, who is also searching for the inventor, he travels to Jerusalem to solve the problem. = Legion: Skin Deep = Stephen Leeds, AKA Legion, is back with his aspects once again in tow. This time around Stephen is called on to help a friend after the mysterious disappearance of a body. His investigation is hampered by the interference of a trained assassin and the dead man's younger brother. Stephen and his invisible entourage face danger at every turn whilst looking into the body theft and the man's secretive work on human cells. = Legion: Lies of the Beholder = Stephen Leeds, or 'Legion', has his final adventure. Two unrelated events start it off: the disappearance of one of Stephen's many \\"aspects\\", Armando, and an unexpected cry for help from Sandra, the woman who helped him learn to live with his condition many years before. The combination of the two leads to a sinister high-tech firm specializing in advanced methods of human incarceration.  Reception  Legion has been well received by reviewers, one commenting: \\"This is the first time I wish a Brandon Sanderson story was longer than it ended up being. Maybe we'll get to read more about Stephen \\"Legion\\" Leeds in future stories or novels, if Sanderson finds the time between all his other projects. Leeds is definitely a character with enough depth to lead an entire novel, or even a series. Based on this short teaser novella and Sanderson's writing talent, Legion could be the starting point for a great contemporary fantasy/crime hybrid\\". Television rights In 2013, Sanderson posted on his blog that Lionsgate has the rights for a Legion television show under option, and later said the TV rights were purchased by Lionsgate sometime in 2012. In 2016, Sanderson posted on Reddit that interest for making a series had dwindled after a show with the same name featuring a similar character from Marvel Comics' X-Men universe was announced. As of September 2020 the rights are held by Cineflix Media.

The species was identified in 1912 from a specimen caught off the coast of Luzon Island, and has been both bycatch and a targeted species in fisheries since. Its taxonomy is complex, having been renamed in 1931, being misidentified as a type of shortspine spurdog, then being revived as a species in 2007. It is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to past and present threats from fisheries. It is morphologically similar to several other species, which makes identification difficult. The species is identified as a member of the mitsukurii group, a species complex The similarity to other species has posed problems in identifying trends in the species, and thus, in its conservation.  Biology, anatomy, and appearance  S. montalbani is relatively large, in comparison to other dogfish sharks. Females, with a maximum total length of are generally larger than males, which have a maximum total length of . The spines on the dorsal fin are low, like others in the mitsukrii species complex. Coloration patterns are similar to others in the mitsukrii group: The dorsal surface is a light grey, and the ventral surface is white. The caudal bar is a dark bar found on the caudal fin of some species, including some sharks. Like other sharks in the mitsukurii group, the Philippines spurdog has a caudal bar which is dark and almost upright, however the caudal bar extends further in S. montalbani than S. mitsukurii, allowing visual differentiation of the species. An additional coloration pattern distinguishes the two species: a dark blotch on the upper lobe of the caudal fin appears in both S. montalbani and S. mitsukurii, however the placement and shape differs. Like most sharks, the species is yolk-sac viviparous. The species has been observed with litter sizes of 4-16 pups, with pups developing a yolk sack in utero. Diet is described in White et al. 2006 \\"primarily of small fishes, cephalopods and crustaceans,\\" which is repeated by the IUCN.  Taxonomy  The \\"Philippines spurdog\\" was first described in 1912 by Hugh McCormick Smith and Lewis Radcliffe, however the binomial name they choose, S. philippinus, is identical to a name previously given to the Port Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni). Although S. philippinus is a junior synonym for the accepted binomial name for the Port Jackson shark, and thus is not valid, it is also not valid as a name for the Philippines spurdog either. The species was renamed by Gilbert Percy Whitley in 1931. Thus, although the name S. philippinus predates the accepted name S. montalbani, S. philippinus is considered a junior synonym for the Philippines spurdog and a junior homonym for an invalid name of the Port Jackson shark. The species was identified as synonymous with S. mitsukurii in several important taxonomic lists, including the first edition of Sharks and Rays of Australia in 1994. and the 1984 Sharks of the World. The conspecificity of S. mitsukurii and S. montalbani was based on overlapping ranges and a substantial morphological similarity. In 2006, a description of the Indonesian greeneye spurdog was given in Economically Important Sharks and Rays of Indonesia and given the temporary binomial name Squalus sp. 1 pending clarification of the classification of the species. The species name S. montalbani was revived and applied to this species after further analysis in 2007, based on morphometric differences and differences in the coloration pattern. The holotype specimen for the species was collected by Smith and Radcliffe in 1908, during the Philippine expedition. It is a juvenile male, taken from a depth of off the coast of Sombrero Island in the Philippines. The specimen deposited at the Museum of Natural History (USNM Cat No. 70256).  Range and habitat  S. montalbani, like most other sharks, is exclusively a marine species. It is found in Pacific and Eastern Indian Ocean waters of SE Asia, the Philippines, and Australia. The range in Australian waters extends around the continent, however is most frequently found off the coasts of New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia. It is found throughout waters of the Philippeans and Indonesia. It inhabits water which is warm to temperate. Its range overlaps with other species in the mitsukurii group. The species is found primarily in deep waters, generally close to the bottom. Specimens of the species have been recovered from depths as deep as , and as shallow as , however the species is usually caught in depths from . The species has been caught along the upper continental shelf or near islands.  Conservation and human interaction  The species fished in bathydemersal longline fisheries in Indonesia, either as a targeted species or by-catch of other dogfish fisheries. It is eaten, and the fins and liver oil are both economically valuable. The species was also caught in a short-lived fishery based in Esperance, Western Australia during the 1990s, however rapidly declining catches closed the fishery since 1999. The species was listed as \\"vulnerable\\" by the IUCN in 2008 due to threats from fisheries. The similarity of the species to others in the mitsukurii group, and related uncertainty in its taxonomic classification, has posed problems for conservation of the species. Records of the species specifically do not exist, however morphologically similar dogfish underwent a massive collapse in the 1970s off the coast of Australia. Populations probably underwent declines of as much as 97% in some parts of New South Wales as the result of fishing. The IUCN estimated global population of the species to have declined more than 30% from unfished levels and with a decreasing population trend.

Background  Armatrading used a string orchestra on several tracks. She used the London Metropolitan Orchestra, along with the Kronos Quartet on one track and The Memphis Horns on two songs. Because of this, the album had several arrangers (see Personnel list) including Armatrading herself. B. J. Cole returned to play slide guitar, the first time he had played on an Armatrading album since 1976, when he played on the track \\"Down to Zero\\" from the eponymous Joan Armatrading album; and Manu Katché once more returned to play drums. After a twelve-year gap, Tony Levin reprised his role as one of the album's bass guitarists – he had previously played on Walk Under Ladders in 1981 and The Key in 1983. Other than those, Armatrading and her co-producer David Tickle worked with a new set of musicians for the album, including some very experienced artists guesting on several tracks, such as Darryl Jones, who had worked with Miles Davis and Eric Clapton, among others, and who went on to join the Rolling Stones; Greg Phillinganes, a keyboardist who had worked with Stevie Wonder, Eric Clapton, Donna Summer, Aretha Franklin and many others, and Benmont Tench of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.

Right: Metro-style app; entirely composed of contents Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps (formerly Windows Store apps and Metro-style apps) are applications that can be used across all compatible Microsoft Windows devices, including personal computers (PCs), tablets, smartphones, Xbox One, Microsoft HoloLens, and Internet of Things. UWP software is primarily purchased and downloaded via the Microsoft Store. Nomenclature Starting with Windows 10, Windows initially used \\"Windows app\\" to refer to a UWP app. Any app installed from Microsoft Store (formerly Windows Store) was initially \\"Trusted Windows Store app\\"Cortana. Windows 10 version 1511. Microsoft (2015). and later \\"Trusted Microsoft Store apps\\".Cortana. Windows 10 version 1803. Microsoft (2018). Other computer programs running on a desktop computer are \\"desktop apps\\". Starting with Windows 10 1903, Windows indiscriminately refers to all of them as \\"Apps\\". The terms \\"Universal Windows Platform\\" (or \\"UWP\\") and \\"UWP app\\" only appear on Microsoft documentation for its developers. Microsoft started to retrospectively use \\"Windows Runtime app\\" to refer to the precursors of UWP app, for which there was no unambiguous name before.  In Windows 8.x  Windows software first became available under the name \\"Metro- style apps\\" when the Windows Store opened in 2012 and were marketed with Windows 8. =Look and feel= In Windows 8.x, Metro-style apps do not run in a window. Instead, they either occupy the entire screen or are snapped to one side, in which case they occupy the entire height of the screen but only part of its width. They have no title bar, system menu, window borders or control buttons. Command interfaces like scroll bars are usually hidden at first. Menus are located in the \\"settings charm\\". Metro-style apps use the UI controls of Windows 8.x and typically follow Windows 8.x UI guidelines, such as horizontal scrolling and the inclusion of edge-UIs, like the app bar. In response to criticism from customers, in Windows 8.1, a title bar is present but hidden unless users move the mouse cursor to the top of the screen. The \\"hamburger\\" menu button on their title bar gives access to the charms. =Distribution and licensing= For most users, the only point of entry of Metro-style apps is Windows Store. Enterprises operating a Windows domain infrastructure may enter into a contract with Microsoft that allows them to sideload their line-of-business Metro-style apps, circumventing Windows Store. Also, major web browser vendors such as Google and Mozilla Foundation are selectively exempted from this rule; they are allowed to circumvent Microsoft guidelines and Windows Store and run a Metro-style version of themselves if the user chooses to make their product the default web browser. Metro-style apps are the only third-party apps that run on Windows RT. Traditional third- party apps do not run on this operating system. =Multiple copies= Before Windows 8, computer programs were identified by their static computer icons. Windows taskbar was responsible for representing every app that had a window when they run. Metro-style apps, however, are identified by their \\"tiles\\" that can show their icon and also other dynamic contents. In addition, in Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 RTM, they are not shown on the Windows taskbar when they run, but on a dedicated app switcher on the left side of the screen. Windows 8.1 Update added taskbar icons for Metro-style apps. There is no set limit on how many copies of desktop apps can run simultaneously. For example, one user may run as many copies of programs such as Notepad, Paint or Firefox as the system resources support. (Some desktop apps, such as Windows Media Player, are designed to allow only a single instance, but this is not enforced by the operating system.) However, in Windows 8, only one copy of Metro-style apps may run at any given time; invoking the app brings the running instance to the front. True multi-instancing of these apps were not available until Windows 10 version 1803 (released in May 2018).  In Windows 10  Windows 10 brings significant changes to how UWP apps look and work. = Look and feel = How UWP apps look depends on the app itself. UWP apps built specifically for Windows 10 typically have a distinct look and feel, as they use new UI controls that look different from those of previous versions of Windows. The exception to this are apps that use custom UI, which is especially the case with video games. Apps designed for Windows 8.x look significantly different from those designed for Windows 10. UWP apps can also look almost identical to traditional desktop apps, using the same legacy UI controls from Windows versions dating back to Windows 95. These are legacy desktop apps that are converted to the UWP apps and distributed using the APPX file format. = Multitasking = In Windows 10, most UWP apps, even those designed for Windows 8.x, are run in floating windows, and users use the Windows taskbar and Task View to switch between both UWP apps and desktop apps. Windows 10 also introduced \\"Continuum\\" or \\"Tablet Mode\\". This mode is by default disabled on desktop computers and enabled on tablet computers, but desktop users can switch it on or off manually. When the Tablet Mode is off, apps may have resizable windows and visible title bars. When the Tablet Mode is enabled, resizable apps use the windowing system similar to that of Metro-style apps on Windows 8.x in that they are forced to either occupy the whole screen or be snapped to one side. UWP apps in Windows 10 can open in multiple windows. Microsoft Edge, Calculator, and Photos are examples of apps that allow this. Windows 10 v1803 (released in May 2018) added true multi-instancing capabilities, so that multiple independent copies of a UWP app can run. = Licensing and distribution = UWP apps can be downloaded from Windows Store or sideloaded from another device. The sideloading requirements were reduced significantly from Windows 8.x to 10, but the app must still be signed by a trusted digital certificate that chains to a root certificate. Lifecycle Metro-style apps are suspended when they are closed; suspended apps are terminated automatically as needed by a Windows app manager. Dynamic tiles, background components and contracts (interfaces for interacting with other apps) may require an app to be activated before a user starts it. For six years, invoking an arbitrary Metro-style app or UWP app from the command line was not supported; this feature was first introduced in the Insider build 16226 of Windows 10, which was released on 21 June 2017. Development=Windows Runtime= Traditionally, Windows software were developed using Windows API. Software had access to the API with no arbitrary restrictions. Developers were free to choose their own programming language and development tools. Metro-style apps, however, are developed using Windows Runtime (WinRT). Calling a forbidden API disqualifies the app from appearing on Windows Store. Not every app using WinRT is a Metro-style app; a limited subset of WinRT is available for desktop apps. Metro-style apps can only be developed using Microsoft's own development tools. According to Allen Bauer, Chief Scientist of Embarcadero Technologies, there are APIs that every computer program must call but Microsoft has forbidden them, except when the call comes from Microsoft's own Visual C++ runtime. =Universal apps= Apps developed to work intrinsically on smartphones, personal computers, video game consoles and HoloLens are called universal apps. This is accomplished by using the universal app API, first introduced in Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1. Visual Studio 2013 with Update 2 could be used to develop these apps. Windows 10 introduced Universal Windows Platform (UWP) 10 for developing universal apps. Apps that take advantage of this platform are developed with Visual Studio 2015 or later. Older Metro-style apps for Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8.1 or for both (universal 8.1) need modifications to migrate to this platform. UWP is not distinct from Windows Runtime; rather, it is an extension of it. Universal apps no longer indicate having been written for specific OS in their manifest; instead, they target one or more device families, e.g. desktop, mobile, Xbox or Internet of Things (IoT). They react to the capabilities that become available to the device. A universal app may run on both a small mobile phone and a tablet and provide suitable experience. The universal app running on the mobile phone may start behaving the way it would on a tablet when the phone is connected to a monitor or a suitable docking station. =APPX= APPX is the file format used to distribute and install apps on Windows 8.x and 10, Windows Phone 8.1, Windows 10 Mobile, Xbox One, Hololens, and Windows 10 IoT Core. Unlike legacy desktop apps, APPX is the only installation system allowed for UWP apps. It replaces the XAP file format on Windows Phone 8.1, in an attempt to unify the distribution of apps for Windows Phone and Windows 8. APPX files are only compatible with Windows Phone 8.1 and later versions, and with Windows 8 and later versions.How to Install APPX File on Windows Phone 8.1 The Windows Phone 8.x Marketplace allows users to download APPX files to an SD Card and install them manually. In contrast, sideloading is prohibited on Windows 8.x, unless the user has a developers license or in a business domain. Security Traditional Windows software have the power to use and change their ecosystem however they want to. Windows user account rights, User Account Control and antivirus software attempt to keep this ability in check and notify the user when the app tries to use it for malicious purposes. Metro-style apps, however, are sandboxed and cannot permanently change a Windows ecosystem. They need permission to access hardware devices such as webcam and microphone and their file system access is restricted to user folders, such as My Documents. Microsoft further moderates these programs and may remove them from the Windows Store if they are discovered to have security or privacy issues.

Location The school is based at Soroti Airport, , in the town of Soroti in the Eastern Region. It is approximately , by air, north-east of Entebbe International Airport, Uganda's largest civilian and military airport. The coordinates of the airport are 1°43'15.0\\"N; 33°37'03.0\\"E (Latitude:1.720833; Longitude:33.617500). Overview As of May 2018, the flying school was undergoing renovations and a certification process to become a center of aviation excellence in the region. New technical staff have been recruited, including (a) a Director (b) a Quality Manager (c) a Safety Manager (d) a Chief Engineering Instructor (d) Flying instructors (e) Ground instructors (f) Engineering instructors and (g) Flight Operations Instructors. At that time the school had nine training aircraft. By May 2018, nine pilot- trainees, seven aircraft maintenance engineers and fourteen flight operations officers had completed training during the calendar year. Another fifteen pilots, fifteen flight operations engineers and five aircraft maintenance engineers were expected to graduate during the second half of 2018. History EACAA was founded in September 1971 under the Directorate of Civil Aviation of the EAC. The government of Uganda, the East African Community (EAC), the United Nations Development Programme, and the International Civil Aviation Organization were the major contributors. When the first EAC collapsed in 1977, the Ugandan government took over the management and maintenance of the school. In 2012, the government began the process of returning the school to the EAC. In late 2013, the Ugandan government entered into preliminary discussions with Integra, a private Danish aviation company, to improve and manage the school at international standards under a public- private-partnership (PPP) arrangement. Discussions at the Ugandan cabinet level have also been held about returning the school to the EAC. In 2014, the EAC Council of Ministers agreed to take it back. On 3 July 2014, the presidents of Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda agreed in principle to re-instate the EACAA as one of the centres of excellence in the EAC. However, due to the failure of partner states to remit operational and development funds to the school, the Ugandan Cabinet, in March 2019, formally resolved to take over the ownership and management of the academy. It is expected that the academy will expand its training programs to include pilots and aircraft maintenance engineers from (a) UPDF Air Force (b) Uganda National Airlines Company (c) Uganda Police Air Wing (d) Ugandan Presidential Fleet (e) Commercial and General aviation. This would save Uganda millions of dollars in foreign exchange, currently spent on procuring this training outside the country.

He served as Governor of Jalisco from 2013 to 2018.  Education and personal life  Aristóteles Sandoval is the son of Leonel Sandoval and Sagrario Díaz. His father is currently a magistrate for the Supreme Court of Justice of Jalisco. He completed his bachelor's degree at the University of Guadalajara. He also has a degree in law from the University of Guadalajara and a master's degree in politics and public development from the Western Institute of Technology and Higher Education. He was the head of the University of Guadalajara student organization, the Federation of University Students (FEU) and directed the PRI youth organization, the Revolutionary Youth Front (FJR) of Guadalajara.  Political activity  Between 2001 and 2003, he was an alderman for the City of Guadalajara and a member of the Edilicias Commissions of Justice (as president), Sports and Youth Care (president), Finance and Budget, and Urban Development. As an alderman, he proposed the creation of the Municipal Institute of Youth Care. In 2003, he was elected as a state delegate for District XI of Guadalajara, presiding over the Commission of Finance and Budget for the LVII Congress of Jalisco. He held this position until 2006. After that, he was the PRI's 2006 mayoral candidate for Guadalajara, but declined in favor of Leobardo Alcalá Padilla. = Municipal President of Guadalajara = In the 2009 Jalisco state elections, he won the municipal presidency of Guadalajara for the term lasting from 2010 to 2012. He competed against Jorge Salinas Osornio of the National Action Party (PAN). The city has now been governed by the PRI for three consecutive terms. At age 35, he became the youngest municipal president to have governed the city of Guadalajara. = Governor of Jalisco = Gubernatorial election  On January 11, 2012, Aristóteles Sandoval requested to leave the municipal presidency in order to register himself as a gubernatorial candidate for the state of Jalisco. He ran on behalf of a coalition formed by the PRI and the Mexican Green Party, called Compromiso por Jalisco. The city council appointed Jesús Ayón López as interim municipal president in his place. In this way, he competed in the 2012 Jalisco state elections against candidates Enrique Alfaro Ramírez of the Partido Movimiento Ciudadano, Fernando Garza Martínez of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, Fernando Guzmán Pérez Peláez of the National Action Party and María de los Ángeles Martínez Valdivia of the New Alliance Party. The campaign began on March 30, 2012. The election was conducted on July 1, 2012. The results provided by the Programa de Resultados Preliminares (PREP) declared Sandoval the winner with 98% of the votes counted and a margin of 4 percentage points over the closest contender, Enrique Alfaro Ramírez. Regardless, the election results were challenged by the Movimiento Ciudadano party, but the challenge was dismissed by the Jalisco Electoral Tribunal, ratifying the election of Sandoval as governor. As a consequence, on July 8, 2012, Sandoval received certification on behalf of the Instituto Electoral and from Participación Ciudadana, declaring him as governor elect.  Gubernatorial term  On March 1, 2013, Sandoval was sworn into office, officially assuming the governorship of Jalisco.

It is turn-based, and allows three to six players at once. It is produced by American indie studio Subaltern Games, and designed by Seth Alter. As in Risk, the world is divided into a number of different regions that player try to dominate. Unlike Risk, however, the goal is not to occupy as many regions as possible, but to liquidate the votes you have purchased in regions in order to put as much money as possible in a Swiss Bank account. The game lasts for twelve turns. At the end of the twelfth turn, the player who has the most money in his Swiss Bank account is the winner. Also, Neocolonialism differs from Risk in that the map of the world is rotated 180° in relation to the most common world map orientation, putting the north at the bottom. In the introductory tutorial, the learner is told: \\"You will learn the basics of how to ruin the world.\\" Later the learner is warned: \\"Neocolonialism is a game about finance bankers attempting to extract as much wealth from the world as possible.\\" Gameplay The game is played using the mouse alone; the keyboard is not used except when chatting with other players in multi-player mode. Three to six people can play at once. The world is divided into eleven regions: Australia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia,In the game, this region includes the sections of Asia that are generally considered Central Asia; however, the region also includes China. India, Russia, Middle East, Africa, Europe, South America, Central America, and North America. Each region has ten \\"units\\" of voters that the players can purchase. Each player starts with fifteen units of currency, symbolized by the character \\"¤\\". There are three phases to each turn: investment, policy, and IMF (International Monetary Fund). * Investment Phase – the players take turns buying and selling government votes. On bottom center of the page there are options to buy, sell, or pass. Each region has ten \\"units\\" of voters that can be purchased. The price for a voting unit of each region is listed in the bottom-right panel. This price can fluctuate; the price of region's voting unit is determined by the mines, factories, and free trade agreements that currently make that region profitable (or unprofitable). * Policy Phase – the players manipulate regional parliaments. A player can tell his or her voting units whom to vote for in an election; propose to build mines or factories, or to establish Free Trade Agreements; or vote on the proposals made by the other players. When three or more voting units have been purchased in a single region, the region elects a Prime Minister. The Prime Minister of a region can propose a policy, but the policy cannot go into effect until it is ratified in the next turn (and sometimes the other voters of the region will vote against it). A policy will not generate money for players until it has been ratified. A Prime Minister also has the option of liquidating his or her own votes and sending the money to a secret Swiss Bank account. A Prime Minister has a three-term limit before re-election. * IMF Phase – the players observe and/or intervene in response to tragedies in different regions. These events are usually problems with the economy (such as a mine collapse), and they often result in a reduced value for each unit of votes in that region. At the beginning of each turn, players can receive money, which they use to buy votes. However, a player will only receive money if he or she has bought votes in a region that has a Prime Minister. In every region where there is a Prime Minister, a player will receive an amount of money equal to 1/3 of how much that player's voting units are currently worth in that region. For instance, if Player1 owns six voting units in Europe, and voting units in Europe are currently worth nine units of currency, then Player1 will received eighteen (six times nine, divided by three) units of currency. A player only receives money at the beginning of a turn if the player owns votes. Therefore, if a player liquidates his or her votes, that player loses a source of income. The vote distribution for a region is listed in the bottom-left corner of the screen. On the top-right corner is the \\"data\\" button, which shows where other players have purchased their votes. When three or more of a region's voting units have been bought, and all of them belong to a single player, the player is called a \\"dictator\\" and the region becomes a \\"dictatorship\\". Sometimes in a dictatorship, a coup occurs. A coup overturns the government, and causes the former-dictator to lose all of his or her votes. The player's money is not returned or refunded after the coup. At the end of twelve turns, the player with the most money in his or her Swiss Bank account is the winner. An announcement is made—\\"The world has been ruined\\"—followed by the players and their scores. The number of voting units left on the map is irrelevant to the final scores. Development Seth Alter first got the idea in September 2011, when he was playing German-style board games with friends in Boston. A friend jokingly wondered how to make a board game \\"based solely on the Marxist theory of neocolonialism—in which developed-world institutions control developing- world countries by purely financial means.\\"Bernstein, Joseph. \\"We found the unofficial computer game of the Mitt Romney campaign\\". Kill Screen. 5 September 2012. Retrieved 31 December 2013. A few months later, Alter reported his progress on the game so far, on a blog, with his screenname \\"sampedestal\\": \\"Neocolonialism is a complex cocktail of background financial and political decisions conjured by a global potpourri of rich people.

His Radar Tires' branded products were declared Carbon Neutral in October 2013, after a two- year project with Ernst & Young to study the brands global carbon emissions. With the November 2014 launch of the Timberland Tires brand, Omni United announced a take back and recycling program to convert worn Timberland Tires into new outsoles of Timberland footwear. Liberty Tire Recycling will collect worn Timberland Tires after they have been changed out at authorized Timberland locations and sort the tires at its consolidation centers. From there, the used tires will be shipped to a North American tire recycling facility where they will be recycled into crumb rubber and further processed into sheet rubber for use in Timberland® footwear. The rubber will be mixed into an approved compound for outsoles that will ultimately be incorporated into Timberland® boots and shoes.  The Breast Cancer Research Foundation - Corporate Partnership  Since 2011, Radar Tires has supported The Breast Cancer Research Foundation with the Radar Tires [Omni United] Award. The same year, the company released a \\"Ring of Hope\\" tire, a limited edition pink- walled version of its Radar RPX 900 .

Its name means \\"money\\" in the Totonac language. (Note that this word in Totonac is borrowed from the old Spanish coin the \\"tomín\\" [www.rae.es]). Espinal is a municipality of some 2600 inhabitants, 19% of whom are indigenous Totonac people. Used as a complementary currency, the Tumin was first put in circulation in 2010 as a student project at the Intercultural University of Veracruz, where students were trying to find ways of strengthening the local economy. In Espinal the access to cash is scarce as most people work for the minimum wage. The project creators analyzed the economy of the area and concluded that there were sufficient goods and demand, but that a medium of exchange was lacking. The creators designed bills and started promoting its use as a kind of exchange coupon among locals in Espinal, in order to support a barter economy. The bills are decorated with the likenesses of Emiliano Zapata and paintings by Diego Rivera, and they describe the value of the bill in Spanish and Totonac. The Tumin is accepted in Espinal in the purchase of services from health care to tacos and internet cafe visits. In order to participate one has to produce some product for exchange, and declare that they want to be a member. Each member is provided with 500 Tumin and a directory of the other members, with whom they can exchange services using the currency. A member commits to charging at least 10% of the worth of a product that they exchange in Tumin, effectively lowering the price of goods at no cost to the seller since their initial 50 Tumin were provided for free. A Tumin is worth one Mexican peso and can be exchanged for that amount. The desired function is to effectively lower prices and to establish a preference for buying goods from other community members since Tumin only circulate within the community. The system does not work if participants raise prices, or if some members accumulate Tumin since that implies that a member does not buy products from others, or if they spend all their Tumin without providing goods for others to consume. Those who do not produce goods, such as laborers or the poor in the community are in effect excluded from the Tumin community as they do not have any services to exchange. The Tumin has been described by journalists as reinvigorating the economy of the municipality, but has also been criticized by the Mexican National Bank for being an attempt to substitute the Mexican national currency, the peso. The Mexican National Bank has in fact sued the developers of Tumin for acting against its monopoly on printing money, a lawsuit that is still on-going. The creators state that the accusations are invalid as Tumin do not replace money, but is rather an instrument for barter. One 2013 study argued that the currency was ineffective in reaching the goal of improvement of the community's economy, but that it has been successful in promoting mutuality and solidarity within the community.

It dates to the 13th century, and was built to protect a medieval trade route. After 1712 the castle was allowed to decay, and much of it has disappeared. Location Rottenegg Castle is in Upper Austria about northwest of Linz. Is about to the north of Ottensheim, which lies on the Danube. The ruined castle is on a projecting rock promontory where the Kleinen Rodl enters the Großen Rodl river from the north, looking over the confluence. It guarded an old trade route that ran past this location. History Rottenegg is first mentioned in 1285. That year Chunrad and Sieghard Piber were cited as witnesses to a charter of the Wilhering monstery. They were named after Rottenegg, which presumably had already been standing for some time. The castle remained in the possession of the Piber family until 1340, when Otto II dem Piber died. His daughter Diemut inherited the property, governess of the Duchess Catherine. In 1363 the castle was handed to Deimut's sons Ruger and Berengar von Landenberg. Ruger soon died. In 1375 Berengar sold the castle to the brothers Reinprecht, Rudolf and Friedrich von Wallsee. After that the castle changed hands several times. In 1712 it was acquired by Thomas Gundaker, Count Starhemberg, who united it with the domain of Eschelberg and managed it from there. The castle was inhabited by poor people, was not maintained and fell in disrepair. In 1936 it was sold to private owners. Building Once a four-story masonry residential and defensive tower, it was later extended and at the turn of the 16th and 17th century was converted into a stately house. The tower was retained and topped with an onion dome. The donjon was integrated into the house and can no longer be seen as a tower from the outside. The house had three levels with comfortable rooms, a large hall, a large and beautiful chapel and vaults, and well-built stone cellars. The chapel occupied the lower two floors of the southwest corner of the residential building. Today the joists and floors have all collapsed, but the remaining walls and window frames still show elaborate stucco decoration and traces of painting. It can be seen that the castle was repeatedly modified or extended. The large windows would not have originally been present. The surrounding wall and farm buildings have completely gone, but the gatehouse is largely intact, although modernized, and is still occupied. The former grange to the north of the main castle also continued to be used. It was transformed into a well-kept residence in the 19th and 20th centuries.

The series stars Dilweed and Fungus, two woodchucks with big hearts, who are obsessed with using their bungling kung-fu skills to protect the lives of the citizens in their town of Ding-a-Ling Springs. The series was cancelled, and its final episode aired on December 1, 2016, after a total of 52 episodes were produced. Plot Before one night changed their lives, woodchuck brothers Dilweed and Fungus never saw themselves as heroes. But during a late-night-TV infomercial, they ordered a Woodchuck Morris kung-fu video. Now, they have made it their mission to become just as awesome as their kung-fu mentor. Misguided but with good intentions, the brothers become obsessed with using their newfound skills to protect the citizens in their town of Ding-a-Ling Springs. Dilweed and Fungus take on a never-ending quest to fight off danger with Morris' guidance. EpisodesCharacters * Dilweed Chuck (voiced by Terry McGurrin) – Dilweed is a focused yellow woodchuck. He is the eldest of the Numb Chucks by 15 seconds. As the eldest brother of the duo, Dilweed takes himself, and everything they do, a bit more seriously than Fungus. To him, kung fu is a deadly serious matter. * Fungus Chuck (voiced by Lou Attia (Season 1) and Cory Doran (season 2)) – Fungus is an emotional, unfocused and overzealous brown woodchuck. He has a happy-go-lucky kind of personality. Fungus secretly wants to be as awesome as his older brother, Dilweed, who he looks up to. Fungus is very emotional and is prone to clumsiness and fears almost anything. * Quills (voiced by Bryn McAuley) – Quills is a happy, easy going and helpful purple porcupine. She works at \\"Pin Heads\\", Ding-A-Ling Springs' popular bowling alley. Quills is the bowling alley's only employee and rarely goes outside. The Numb Chucks are a wacky ray of sunshine in her day. She loves them both and Quills supports the Numb Chucks martial arts vision and yearns to be like them. Even though she tolerates their silliness, she can be annoyed by their stupidity at times. * Buford G. Butternut (voiced by Andrew Jackson) – Buford is a jealous, lazy and irritable blue sheep. He lives in a house with his Grandmother. Since Buford's Grandma loves the Numb Chucks and makes Buford look bad, Buford has made it his goal to get rid of the Numb Chucks and expose their stupidity to his Grandma. Buford used to be unlike his current personality when he was around six, before the Chucks accidentally shut a door on him and something inside him snapped before the Chucks came out and wondered where he went. * Grandma Butternut (voiced by Julie Lemieux) – Grandma Butternut is a feisty, blunt and generous yellow sheep. She is Buford's grandmother and housemate. She is constantly disappointed with him. Grandma is polite and sweet to everyone except to Buford. She adores the helpful Numb Chucks as they remind her of the 'good ole days' in Ding-A-Ling Springs. She is fond of Hooves and often disturbs him. * Sir Rupert Van Der Hooves (voiced by Robert Tinkler) – High strung and delicate, Hooves is a nervous moose. And who wouldn't be, living next door to the Numb Chucks? Hooves went to High School with Woodchuck Morris which makes the Numb Chucks love him to Hooves' dismay. Hooves enjoys gardening, cleaning, relaxing, reading, fancy living etc., but doesn't enjoy the Chucks or Grandma Butternut invading his personal space. According to the pilot, he speaks in a German accent. * Woodchuck Morris (voiced by Joris Jarsky) – A former Ding-A- Ling springs native, Woodchuck Morris is the highly charged and intimidating host of the Numb Chucks' favourite martial arts training video, The Way Of the Chuck, a parody of Chuck Norris' The Way of The Dragon. He fears nothing! He doesn't like pity, evil or compromise of any kind! His main desire is to spread the gospel of kung fu and is the icon that the Numb Chucks have chosen to follow. He is a homage to Chuck Norris.

It is a Grade II* listed building which occupies a prominent position at the junction of Brixton Road, Brixton Hill and Effra Road. The church was constructed following the Church Building Act 1818 and was consecrated in 1824.  Parish  Until 1824, Brixton was part of the large ancient parish of Lambeth, whose church stood about away, next to Lambeth Palace. These arrangements were inconvenient for those living in the new housing that was already starting to appear along the main roads passing through Brixton, a situation that was addressed by the construction of four new churches at Waterloo, Kennington, Norwood and St Matthew's at Brixton. The St Matthew's parish created in 1824 included Brixton, Brixton Hill, Herne Hill, Tulse Hill and (in modern terms) the Loughborough Junction and western Camberwell area. In 1886 the population of the parish amounted to 13,924 and was served by three clergy. The total proportion attending (morning and evening services) was 12.4%. In 1901 the population of the parish was 12,029. In the following year, there were two clergymen and the total proportion attending was 11.2%. In 2002 St Matthew’s parish was united with that of St Jude's in East Brixton, whose church building had been sold in 1980 and which had no incumbent since 1991. St Jude's was built in 1867-68.] Based on statistics from the UK census, the Diocese of Southwark estimates the population of the parish was 12,100 in 2001 and 15,500 in 2011. It is not clear whether the figure for 2001 includes people who were then living in the former parish of St Jude's. Building  Portico of St Matthew's Church The church was constructed following the Church Building Act 1818, which allowed for new churches in overpopulated parishes. Initial works began late in 1821 and the foundation stone was laid by Charles Manners-Sutton, Archbishop of Canterbury on 1 July 1822. The church was consecrated in 1824. Since 19 October 1951 St Matthew’s church has been designated a Grade II* listed building. It was designed by Charles Ferdinand Porden (1790-1863) with the foundation stone laid in 1822 and the church consecrated two years later. The building is a rectangle, with a massive Greek Doric entrance portico at the west end, fronting onto Brixton Hill. A tower stands at the east end of the building. During the 1970s and subsequently, major internal alterations have been carried out to provide accommodation for a variety of activities, including continued use of a part by the Anglican congregation. The building and its churchyard occupies a highly visible triangular site at the junction of major roads, but pedestrian access is somewhat restricted because of the width of these roads and the density of the traffic. Architecture The church is built of pale yellowish brick with dressings of stone and Roman cement. The west portico is tetrastyle in antis and has fluted Doric columns. There are three tall doors which are battered and which have enriched panels, in eared moulded architraves. By the doors are cast iron boot-scrapers. The church has five-bay sides with pilasters of Roman cement and entablature. The church lies on a stone plinth and has battered windows with eared architraves. On each side there are stairs with side-walls down to an entrance to the crypt. There is a pedimented doorway enclosed by a strong, double wrought iron gate. The east end of the church is stone-faced with a wide projecting central tower bay, which has a window. There are doors in recessed side bays. The tower has a square bell stage with Doric screens, below on octagonal \\"Tower of the Winds\\" which has a low conical top with a crown and cross. At the base of the Tower of the Winds is a blue-faced clock with gilt numbering. When the building was given Listed Building status in 1951, it was reported that inside the church there was a wide gallery around three sides and in the west end a Doric organ case. In front of the east window was a tall screen of two Doric columns. There were also original pews and some memorial tablets. The more recent internal changes to the building have provided a smaller worship area at the west end of the building with access through a lobby from the main entrance doors. The worship area has ancillary accommodation such as a vestry and kitchen. There is also a gallery (although not the one mentioned in the 1951 listing description). Notable people Former British Prime Minister John Major married Norma Major in the church in 1970.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Vermont. History About 55 Episcopalians were present in a Burlington hotel when St. Paul's Church was organized in 1830. The first service was held in the courthouse on June 12, 1831. A stone, Gothic Revival church building was dedicated the following year. The structure was enlarged three times (1851, 1866, 1910) as the congregation grew. The 1910 renovation followed a fire. At the Diocesan Convention of 1965 St. Paul's was designated as the cathedral church for the diocese. It was formally elevated on May 6, 1966. The old St. Paul's Cathedral was destroyed by a fire on February 15, 1971. It was sparked by an electrical malfunction in the basement. The City of Burlington was in the midst of a massive urban renewal project at the time. They offered to exchange the land on which the old church had stood for a new plot of land overlooking Lake Champlain downtown. Burlington Associates was chosen to design the new cathedral. It was completed in 1973 and consecrated on November 11, 1973. Architecture St. Paul's was designed in the Modern architectural style. It is composed of stressed concrete. The interior features white oak furnishings and paneling and a slate floor. It is naturally lit from the skylights and large curtain windows. The south wall’s great window provides a panoramic view of Lake Champlain and the Adirondacks. The tower holds eight bells from old St. Paul's. They were cast in 1895 by the Meneely Bell Company of Troy, New York. The bells were refurbished after the fire and rehung in the new bell tower. A ninth bell cracked in the fire and is now in the Memorial Garden. The Memorial Garden is located on the east side of the nave. The ashes of parish members and friends of St. Paul’s are buried there. It is enclosed with stonework that incorporates stones from old St. Paul’s.

She was modeled after , Canada's first effective icebreaker, but was slightly longer and more powerful. Like her predecessor, her primary winter duties were keeping Prince Edward Island connected to the mainland—one of the conditions under which the province had entered Confederation. The ship entered service in 1899 and remained on the East Coast of Canada until 1915, when Minto was sold to the Russian Empire. Transferred in November, she became Ivan Susanin, and was tasked with keeping northern ports open during the war. Her name was changed to Leitenant Dreyer in 1920 after being taken over the Soviet Navy and Skuratov in 1921. The ship was wrecked in the Barents Sea in 1922. Description Mintos design was based on CGS Stanley, Canada's previously constructed icebreaker. Minto was larger and had no bowsprit and a rounded bow. Minto was intended to augment Stanley in servicing Prince Edward Island. The ship had a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 1,089 tons and was long overall with a beam of and a draught of . The ship was powered by steam from a triple- expansion engine driving a single screw. This created and gave the vessel a maximum speed of . Service history The ship was ordered from Gourlay Brothers and constructed in Dundee, Scotland. The vessel was launched on 12 July 1899, named for the Governor General of Canada, Gilbert Elliot-Murray- Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto. The vessel was completed in September 1899\\\\. Like Stanley, Minto was used as a lighthouse and buoy supply vessel from spring to fall and in winter, was used for icebreaking and passenger ferry service to and from Prince Edward Island. In 1905, the ice became too thick for either ship to traverse and the ferry service was suspended, with travel to island done by iceboat. In 1911, 1912 and 1915, Minto was sent to Hudson Bay for survey work. During the First World War, the Russian Empire required icebreakers to keep northern ports open for cargo traffic. In 1915 Canada sold the vessel to Imperial Russia, with Minto departing in November for Archangelsk. Upon arrival, the ship was renamed Ivan Susanin and was deployed in the White Sea, breaking Russian and British ships out of the ice. In 1920, with the fall of the Russian Empire, the ship was taken over by the Soviet Navy and renamed Leitenant Dreyer. In 1921 the vessel was renamed again, this time to Skuratov. In 1922 Skuratov foundered at Cheshskaya Guba in the east Barents Sea.

In 1915 he was promoted to Major, and later in 1917 he was appointed to the Oberste Heeresleitung (Supreme Army Command) under Colonel Walter Nicolai, where he remained until its termination in October 1919. In the Spring of 1920, he was appointed Lieutenant Colonel (Oberstleutnant) in the reconstruction of a new military intelligence service in the new Reichswehr. He served in its statistical office until his retirement with the nominal grade of Major General in June 1927. = The Gempp report and service in the Second World War = From 1928 to 1944 he wrote a monumental report on Geheimer Nachrichtendienst und Spionageabwehr des Heeres, (Secret Intelligence Service and Counterintelligence of the Army in the First World War) the so-called Gempp report. With the mobilization in 1939 for the Invasion of Poland, he was recalled to active service in the Intelligence Service (Abwehr) of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW). He was assumed to be captured by the Soviet Army in 1945, and officially declared dead on 11 August 1946. = Arrest, death and rehabilitation = Gempp was arrested by the Soviet Military Intelligence service on 10 April 1946, transferred to imprisonment in Moscow, and died on 3 January 1947 in the prison hospital of heart failure.

It was founded in 1524 by the nuns of Santa Clara de la Columna de Belalcazar. The building is located in the historic center, near the parish church and the Hermitage of Santa María del Castillo. It is designed in the mudéjar style. The bell-gable was added in the 18th century. A new altarpiece was added in 1942, after the restoration of the damage arising as a result of the Spanish Civil War. Architecture and fittings The building was enlarged to meet the growing needs of the religious community. The original construction is mostly ruined and abandoned, although the refectory, kitchens, stairs, cloister of the cistern, yards, gardens and cemetery are identified. The main entrance of the convent is opens directly onto the street Francisco Botello. It is made with blocks of granite and consists of a geminate inverted arch, with thread cutting molding and keystones; it is aligned with and supports arch panels on flat pilasters. A gallery features six arches on granite piers with tapered capitals. This gallery is open through two portals, also of granite, the first settled by a simple arch and the second through another arch. In front of this porch is the entrance to the temple. The church and convent are joined by a large room divided longitudinally by a semicircular arch double banked on a column of granite. A lower level is reached by three steps. The staircase is two sections at right angles with a central plateau and paneled roof deck; the steps are of granite in one piece. The refectory is rectangular and is punctuated by three elliptical arches of granite. It connects directly to the kitchen area, pantry, herb garden and cloister of the cistern. The Cloister of the Cistern is a large irregular space landscaped with fruit trees; pomegranate and lemon are mentioned. There are trees and aromatic shrubs, including thickets and laurel and ornamental plants such as roses. It is bounded to the southwest by the cemetery, two small pens and a two-story gallery with arches, where the former cells were located. In this cloister there is a well curb dated 1956 Neo-Baroque style. To the west, there is a large space before the old garden, currently segmented in two by a low wall that separates the modern building of the cloister, built in the 20th century by housing of the old convent. The church, located transversely with respect to the outside, has a presbytery and a dome decorated with paintings alluding to Christ's Passion and Compassion Mary. At the foot is the choir. The ceiling is reinforced by a column of wrought iron. The choir loft connects directly with the body of the former living cells. The connection to the street is done via the front opening in the wall of the Epistle, containing granite block lintels.

The Liphart family moved away during World War I and the Russian Revolution heralded the start of sales of the more valuable part of the art collection in Copenhagen in 1920. The manor was obtained by Tartu University. The buildings housed the Estonian National Museum from 1922. This was a bold move as the Liphart family of Baltic German aristocrats were viewed as \\"ideologically and culturally revolting\\" by the local Estonians. Despite this the museum was popular and the grounds became a place for leisure. The manor was destroyed during the Tartu Offensive in 1944 when it caught fire during a bombing raid. Airfield Military airport building in 2008 In 1940 100 ha were requisitioned to create a Russian airport.History, ERM.ee, retrieved 31 December 2013 The airport became a major Soviet bomber base for fifty years. The secrecy of the airfield meant that foreigners were not allowed to visit the city. Over 100 bombers were based here making it the largest Baltic airfield. This meant that the museum's collection had to be stored in places like the city's churches. The airfield is still seen as a reminder that Estonia was occupied by Soviet forces. Today Today the Estonian National Museum has buildings for storage at Raadi and the ice house and gatehouse have been renovated. The museum has plans to build new buildings here and it has organised an architecture competition to identify a winning design. That design choice was made in 2006. The winning single-storey multi-national design will retain the legacy of Raadi Manor's history. The new building will be nearly 34,000 square metres and will incorporate the museum, conference facilities and a cinema. The building may start before 2015. The park is currently open to the public.

It is the only species in the genus Prionium, and is endemic to South Africa (Cape Province and KwaZulu- Natal).Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families Some authors have separated Prionium from the Thurniaceae, putting it instead in its own family, the Prioniaceae.Munro, S.

Description The stem of P. serratum is up to in diameter and covered with the black, fibrous bases of old spirally arranged leaves, four-ranked or tristichous, as in the closely related family Juncaceae, a family in which it was previously placed - it also has close affinities with the bergpalmiet (Tetraria thermalis) in the Cyperaceae. The strap-like lanceolate leaves are rigid, with a high silica content, narrow, leathery, grey-green, and with toothed margins. The small, brown flowers are on a branched inflorescence about 1 m in length. Plants are hermaphroditic and pollination is anemophilous. The fruit is a dry dehiscent triangular capsule, with three seed chambers and arillate seeds which are hispid (with sclerenchymatous fibres) and winged.\\"The families of flowering plants\\" - L.

New flower shoots are cooked as vegetables. (see illustrations) Taxonomy and distribution P. serratum is one of only four species in the family Thurniaceae and the only member of the family native to southern Africa. This species has a disjunct distribution along the southern and south-eastern seaboard from the Western Cape to KwaZulu-Natal on sandstone substrates, growing in dense mats in marshy areas, and in and along streams and rivers. Palmiet wetlands are ecosystems that greatly reduce the erosive damage done by floodwater. When palmiet is removed, streams may become choked by sediment and banks eroded by unchecked floodwater. Prionium is from the Greek for sawblade, while serratum is Latin for toothed.PlantZAfrica.com The name ' was used by Jan van Riebeeck for this plant, doubtless because of its close resemblance to palmito and the palmettos, and it was first noted by the Swedish botanist Carl Peter Thunberg in about 1772. The name evolved into wilde palmiet and then palmiet. Several rivers in the Western Cape have been named Palmiet River for this species growing along their courses - two of the larger ones are the Palmiet River mouthing between Betty's Bay and Kleinmond, and one having its source just west of Formosa Peak and eventually joining the Keurbooms River.

Born in Germany following World War II to Americans stationed in a refugee camp, O'Connor began his career as a journalist in the 1980s. As a foreign journalist, he covered civil wars and conflicts for NPR, The New York Times, CBS News, among others. In 2009, he started his work at CPJ as a representative of Mexico, one of the most dangerous countries for journalists in the world. He travelled across the country investigating attacks against the press and cases about intimidation, disappearances, and murder of Mexican journalists. In 2012, he was one of the leading figures behind the promotion of a federal law signed by former President Felipe Calderón that gave the federal government more jurisdiction to investigate crimes against the press, cases traditionally reserved for local and state officials. Early life and career Mike O'Connor was born in Germany on February 8, 1946, to Jerry and Jess O'Connor. His father was stationed there after the conclusion of World War II and was in charge of supervising the camps of people who were displaced in the conflict. As a child, O'Connor moved back and forth from U.S. to Mexico, where he learned to speak Spanish. The family fled to Mexico constantly because they believed they were on the U.S. government's radar for their sympathy and closeness with left-wing political groups. During his early life, O'Connor lived near the U.S.-Mexico border. It was much later in his life that O'Connor found out that his mother was affiliated with the Independent Labour Party and was blacklisted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). O'Connor also lived in Mexico, a country he deeply cherished and admired, for many years of his life, including Mexico City and Monterrey. He was married to Tracy Wilkinson, the bureau chief of Mexico City for Los Angeles Times. He had two children, Sean and Gabriel; two granddaughters and four siblings. He began his career as a reporter in the 1980s in the San Francisco area before working as a war correspondent for CBS News, covering the civil wars in El Salvador and Nicaragua, and news in the rest of Latin America. He then returned to California and worked again as a local reporter. He then went on to cover Central American affairs for The New York Times (NYT) and NPR. His investigative reporting in Haiti earned him the \\"Overseas Press Club\\" award. For the NYT, O'Connor covered the conflict and aftermath in Yugoslavia. He then went on to work for NPR and covered the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In January 2009, he began to work for Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a New York-based nonprofit organization that raises awareness and protects press freedom and journalists' rights across the world. O'Connor was Mexico's correspondent for CPJ. He often traveled to dangerous areas for journalists in Mexico to report the intimidation, disappearances and murder of Mexican journalists. In his first major report for CPJ in 2009, he published an article about the drug-related violence and censorship of journalists in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, one of the most- dangerous cities in the country that year. Among his most important works was \\"Silence or Death in Mexico's Press\\", a 43-page report that was presented to Mexico's President Felipe Calderón in September 2010. He was one of the leading figures behind the promotion of the \\"Law for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists\\" (Spanish: '), which was passed by the Mexican government in 2012. The law gave authorities at a federal level more autonomy to prosecute crimes against the press in Mexico. CPJ research conducted by O'Connor and his colleagues showed that attacks against the press in the country were often ignored and even facilitated by corrupt law enforcement officials, especially those at the state and local levels. Mexico is one of the most dangerous countries for journalists in the world with one of the highest levels of unsolved crimes against the press. Death O'Connor died in his sleep at home in Mexico City due to an apparent heart attack on December 29, 2013. The United States Department of State extended their condolences; Reporters Without Borders (RWB) and Mexico City's Human Rights Commission (Spanish: ') lamented the death and recognized O'Connor's work to uncover and combat all manner of threats to the safety of Mexican journalists.

At the end of the 19th century, it changed its name to the Bricklayer’s Arms, as there was a huge amount of construction taking place in the surrounding area, due to the extension of the District line railway. The landlady Becky Newman is a former actress, having appeared in Casualty and The House of Eliott. She took over the pub in 2005.

Origins  Both the particular art form and the application of the term \\"vitreography\\" were pioneered by the French-American artist Jean-Pierre Weill, Weill having trademarked the word in 1992.Artfully Elegant, accessed 31 Dec 2013, URL - http://www.artfullyelegant.com/jean-pierre-weill.html Art Leaders Gallery, accessed 31 Dec 2013, URL - http://art-leaders-gallery.com/artists- biographies/jean-pierre-weill-biography Painting on successive glass panes to add real-world dimension to a depiction is seen by some as the natural bridge between the arts of sculpting and painting. What distinguishes vitreography from other stacked glass pane paintings is that each level of a vitreography largely maintains its independence, creating scenes within a larger scene rather than a singular amalgamation.Naldz Graphics, accessed 31 Dec 2013, URL - http://naldzgraphics.net/inspirations/impressive-3d-paintings-done-on-a- series-glass-panes/  Vitreography today  Vitreography remains a fringe art form, as few artists experiment with the technique.

Club career=Doncaster Rovers= Peterson was with Doncaster Rovers since the age of 11, coming through the club's Centre of Excellence and having made progress throughout the youth ranks, Peterson signed a one-year professional contract with the club on 1 July 2013 Peterson later stated in the club's official interview about being a professional. Peterson soon made his debut for the first team away at Charlton Athletic on 26 November 2013, replacing midfielder Marc de Val in the 76th minute as Rovers attempted to get something from the game. He first made the starting eleven in the following month in a 0–0 draw at home against Millwall on 29 December 2013. After making his first start, Peterson expressed his satisfaction. On 18 March 2014, Peterson joined Conference side Barnet on loan for the remainder of the 2013–14 season. He played 90 minutes in a 2–0 loss at Macclesfield Town the same day, but this was the only appearance he made before his loan spell was cut short on 16 April. Upon returning to Doncaster Rovers, Peterson signed a new 12-month contract with the club. After signing a new contract, Peterson was determined to make a breakthrough in the first team. However, Peterson only made one league appearance against Walsall, coming on as a substitute in the 66th minutes on 27 September 2014. Peterson joined Scarborough Athletic on loan in November 2014. By some accounts he had a successful spell here, before his loan was cut short and he returned to Doncaster. At the end of the 2014–15 season, Peterson was released by the club. =Non-league football= After his release by Doncaster Rovers Peterson returned to Scarborough Athletic following his loan spell.

The parish is part of the Episcopal Diocese of Olympia.  History In 1853, Rev. John D. McCarty came as a missionary for the Protestant Episcopal Church to the Northwest. This included many areas of Oregon and Washington, including Olympia, Washington Territory. He conducted services in the Hall of the Representatives. On May 26, 1854, McCarty and Bishop Thomas F. Scott arrived in Olympia. McCarty continued onto Steilacoom for services, and Bishop Scott conducted Sunday services in Olympia. Rev. McCarty returned after that on a monthly basis to conduct services in Olympia. On January 7, 1864, the Washington Territory State Legislature passed an act to incorporate St. John's Episcopal Church. Actually, the incorporation papers specifically indicated \\"Rector, Wardens And Vestrymen Of The Parish Of St. John's Church Of Olympia\\" The only church organization incorporated earlier than St. John's was the Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle, so in one way St. John's was the first parish to be incorporated. The first regularly appointed missionary for St. John's was Rev. D. Ellis Willes. He arrived in June, 1860, and conducted services in the local Methodist Chapel, which was the first church building in Olympia. Rev. Willes resigned in 1861, with monthly services subsequently conducted by Rev. Daniel Kendig, the chaplain at Fort Steilacoom, until Rev. Peter Edward Hyland arrived in 1865. The church building was consecrated by Bishop Scott on Sep. 3, 1865, and two persons, Mrs. Robert Frost and Mrs. Charles (Martha) Grainger were confirmed. Also that day, Rev. Hyland married William Glendenning of Seattle to Jane Connor of Olympia. \\"Accompanying the above was a most generous supply of wine and cake. As we regretfully gaze at the empty bottles and the remnants of the bridal loaf we waft them out best wishes for happiness\\" said the Washington Standard of Sep. 9 of this event. On April 2, 1866, St John's became the oldest incorporated parish in the state of Washington when a meeting of the congregation was held and the parish formally constituted. The Rev. Peter E. Hyland was the rector, and the following were on the vestry: Sam W. Percival, Senior Warden; William Pickering, Junior Warden; and James R. Wood, Robert Frost, Frank Henry, Richard Lane, Benjamin Harned, and John L. Head as vestrymen. Rev. Hyland served until 1871, when he became the Chaplain of the Washington Territory State Legislature. He was followed by a series of ministers who served the church. At times the services were performed by lay ministers, as was the case prior to 1878 when Governor Elisha P. Ferry performed that role. Additionally these rectors included Rev. Dr. Reuben Nevius, the first Registrar of the Diocese of Olympia, and Rev. Thomas E. Jessett, a prominent historian of the Northwest. Mrs. Rebecca G. Howard, a well-known Olympia proprietor of the Pacific House, and a faithful communicant and liberal supporter of St John's died July 12, 1881. The following story was told about her: > Upon one of his visits Bishop Benjamin Morris brought Mrs. Morris and two of > his sisters-in-law to the service. Mrs. Morris and her sisters took a pew > which happened to be the one always occupied by Mrs. Howard. A few minutes > later Mrs. Howard came in, dressed in all her finery and found her pew > occupied by strangers. She took a place a few pews away and then turned and > stared at Mrs. Morris and her sisters until they, embarrassed, moved into > another pew. Mrs. Howard then triumphantly marched into her accustomed > place. Notable early members *Elisha P.

In December, 1863, the ladies of the congregation, organized as the \\"Sewing Society\\", held a fair to raise funds for a church building. Members of the St. John's congregation purchased a lot and buildings from Benjamin Harned at 7th and Main Street (now Capitol Way), the land being part of the current Governor Hotel. The first church building was a converted carpentry shop, occupied beginning in 1865. In 1870 Mrs. T. F. McElroy organized her Sunday School class of girls into \\"The Busy Bees.\\" On March 23, 1875, at a meeting of \\"The Dime & Sewing Society\\" Mr. O'Brien introduced the subject of \\"employing a sexton for the Church to ring the Bell, make fires and light the lamps: the Busy Bees generously offering to keep the Church clean.\\" In 1878 a rectory was built by James Stewart at a cost of $1800 gold coin raised by \\"The Dime Society\\" and the \\"Busy Bees.\\" The St. John's Episcopal Church women's groups are recognized for their contributions to the Olympia area in a registration in the National Register of Historic Places (\\"Women's History in Olympia: First Settlement 1846 to 1948\\"). The registration document states \\"Women were often deeply involved in the establishment and support of local churches. Without their organizational and fund raising abilities, the churches would not have existed.\\" The document goes on to provide specific examples, taken from the history of St. John's women's groups. On April 23, 1888, the old church building and its site was sold for $1500 and plans were made to build a 2nd church. In May the bids were put out publicly for builders, using the plans laid out by the architect, C. N. Daniels. The final cost of the new building was $10,361.75, and was located at present day Washington & 9th in downtown Olympia. (The Church is now the 1st Baptist church, which still has some of the original furnishings including the beautiful stained glass Rose window which was made in England. ) The Rector, the Rev. Horace Buck, equipped the church by writing to friends in former parishes. Some of these furnishings were the baptismal font of carved oak from St. Thomas church in New Haven Connecticut, and the eagle lectern which was the gift of a former parishioner, Mrs. Fanny Mary Wilkinson of Tacoma, daughter of Judge Elwood Evans. From the old church came the bell, the stained glass window of St. John and St Mary, and the Bishop's and Rector's chairs which had come around the Strait of Magellan in earlier days. The opening of the new church and the dedication of these furnishings was held July 19, 1891. The carpet for the chancel and cushions for the pews were supplied by St. John's Guild. To raise money for them they made sheets and pillow slips and hemmed curtains for the first Olympian Hotel; bound blankets for the National Guard of Washington; had teas and garden parties; gave bazaars and excursions. St. John's Episcopal Church moved to its current location at 20th and Capitol Way in 1960. Included in the buildings are many traditional and abstract style stained glass windows. The church facility also contains many artifacts from the second church facility.

State employment growth versus change in tax liability for bottom 90% income earners in the United States. This chart has been claimed to show that tax decreases on the bottom 90% income earners are correlated with increased employment growth. and employees. The effect of taxes on employment is a hotly debated economic and political issue. Some commentators claim that higher taxes lead to lower employment, by reducing the availability of capital to be invested in job-creating enterprises, or by reducing the amount of money available for consumers to use to purchase goods and services, thereby causing a loss of business for purveyors of those goods and services. Other commentators claim that higher taxes lead to higher employment, because governments use those tax revenues to employ government workers, who then purchase goods and services from private businesses, and because governments themselves may act as consumers of goods and services. Higher taxes have also been claimed to increase the confidence of outside investors in the stability of the government, and in the government's willingness and ability to pay debts. On local scales, it has also been claimed that higher taxes in one city, state, or country will motivate businesses to move their operations to other cities, states, or countries with lower taxes. However, it has conversely been claimed that some jurisdictions with relatively high tax burdens experience higher employment than some jurisdictions with relatively low tax burdens, based on the infrastructure and government services that may be provided to businesses operating in that jurisdiction. In 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported on a paper published by economist Owen Zidar examining state-by-state changes in employment following changes in state and federal taxation since the end of the Second World War. Zidar's examination concluded that reduction of taxes on low-income groups spurs employment growth, while little effect on employment results from reduction of taxes on those in the top ten percent of wealth holders.

Radford, 16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 594 (1818), is a United States Supreme Court decision delivered by Justice Bushrod Washington on . The dispute arose from a suit in chancery to establish a clear title to land in Kentucky located on the south bank of the Ohio River, 30 miles downriver from the mouth of the Scioto River. A military land warrant for 1,000 acres had been issued by the Colony of Virginia on and duly patented by a French and Indian War veteran, William Sutherland. Subsequently, treasury warrants were purchased from the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1780 by Craig et al. which they duly patented over parts of the same property. A suit in the Kentucky Circuit Court awarded unconditional title to the original Sutherland patent. An appeal was argued before the Supreme Court during the 1817 term but the verdict upheld the lower court's decision. Non-citizen property rights established by this case have been cited and argued ever since. Early owners of the property included William Clark, Admiral William Radford and General Stephen W. Kearny.  Origin of the Dispute  The Treaty of Paris in 1763 concluded the French and Indian War and distributed the lands of New France between Britain and Spain. King George then issued a royal proclamation. In it, he instructed his Royal Governors to issue military land warrants to war veterans, awarding acreage based upon military rank. Also, in recognition that the Cherokee from the south and the many Indian tribes north of the Ohio River hunted but did not reside in the area they called Kentucky, the king declared an Indian Reserve west of the Appalachian Divide by invalidating any land claims and ordering all settlers to vacate the reserve area. The allure of uninhabited land, especially the Bluegrass Region, contributed to the colonist's disregard for the Indian Reserve. Settlers already in-place believed they had established \\"cabin rights\\". Newcomers, by building a cabin and farming the land, felt qualified under the homestead principle. As a result, the 1763 boundary line continually crept westward as British agents negotiated new treaties, such as the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, Treaty of Hard Labour and Treaty of Lochaber. Individuals also purchased land directly from tribes, such as for the Transylvania Colony. These transactions involved either the Cherokee or tribes from Pennsylvania, but they mostly ignored the western tribes north of the Ohio River, such as the Shawnee and Miami. The growing influx of settlers gave rise to deadly conflicts due to this oversight. In 1772, the last Royal Governor for the Colony of Virginia, John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore (also known as Lord Dunmore) established Fincastle County, extending to the Mississippi River, the border with Spanish Louisiana. He named William Preston as principal surveyor for the county. In 1773, Lord Dunmore issued the overdue military land warrants to French and Indian War veterans and their scope encompassed land south of the Ohio River, between the Scioto River and the Falls of the Ohio. In April 1774, teams departed to survey thousands of acres over the next months. On , surveyor Hancock Taylor (along with chainmen Abraham Hemptonstrall, James Strother and Willis Lee) conducted a 1,000 acre survey for William Sutherland, who had served as an Ensign for the 95th Regiment of Foot. On close to present-day Carrollton, Indians attacked the survey party, killing Strother and wounding Taylor. During the party's retreat home, Taylor died near Richmond. Hemptonstrall and Lee delivered Taylor's field notes to Preston's residence Smithfield. Preston recorded all of Taylor's surveys. The Virginia legislature abolished Fincastle County on due to its affiliation with loyalist Lord Dunmore. The Sutherland property then came under the jurisdiction of Kentucky County, Virginia. Upon the commencement of the American Revolutionary War, loyalist Sutherland permanently left Virginia for Orkney but still continued ownership of his Kentucky land. John Craig, Lewis Craig and Simon Kenton purchased treasury warrants in 1780 and redeemed them for acreage which overlaid the Sutherland tract. Their claims were surveyed during 1785 and land patents were issued on or prior to . The Commonwealth of Virginia did not patent the 1,000 acres to Sutherland until . Kentucky County was abolished on June 30, 1780, when it was divided into Fayette, Jefferson, and Lincoln Virginia counties. These three counties were retained when the Commonwealth of Kentucky was created in 1792. The disputed property came under jurisdiction of Fayette County, Kentucky. Beginning August 19, 1796, William Sutherland began periodically advertising sale of his land, then under Mason County jurisdiction, through the Kentucky Court of Appeals. On , Speculator William Radford (Admiral William Radford was his grandson) purchased Sutherland's 1,000 acre deed for $3,000. Radford, finding individuals who refused to relinquish their claims to his land, began a suit December 2, 1800 in chancery in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. Following William Radford's death in 1803, his heir John Radford continued the suit. The court records announcing the final verdict are apparently lost; the last entry was dated November 24, 1806 while the case was still ongoing. In 1808, John, with his wife Harriet and infant son William, relocated from Fincastle, Virginia to the disputed property finally situated in Lewis County, Kentucky.  Objections  Most of the background was admitted as fact by both parties in the suit. Craig et al. disputed the following: # Deputy surveyor Taylor did not hold the land warrant and so had no authority to execute his survey. # There was no physical proof of Taylor's survey and, even if so, Hemptonstrall testified the survey was begun but not completed. # Incomplete lines run by a deputy should not be sufficient for the principal surveyor to certify the plat and validate the grant. # Sutherland, as a Tory, was an enemy alien and forfeited his colonial land warrant when Virginia joined the United States.  Resolution  The Supreme Court overruled all four objections. There was no dissenting opinion identified in the resolution. # The principal surveyor's certificate referencing the land warrant is sufficient authority for the survey. # Incompetent or incomplete surveys do not invalidate the claim to the land. # A deputy has the whole power of the principal surveyor and Taylor's survey was accepted by the principal as completed. # No act of Virginia legislation had divested property from enemy alien owners before 1794 and the Jay Treaty ninth article protected defeasible estate from then on.  Basis  Traditional English law allowed aliens to purchase land but the crown retained interest to that land. So, even though an alien could exercise dominion over his property as a tenant, he could not bequeath the land to heirs and had to surrender the title upon demand from the crown. Upon declaration of war, enemy aliens automatically forfeited their title to the land. That presumption from long standing law became a pleading for this case. However, the Supreme Court held that land owned by British subjects, made aliens due to the Revolutionary War, was protected from confiscation per the Treaty of Paris. To reclaim land possessed by British subjects, each state had to pass applicable legislation and then complete escheat proceedings for individual cases. Virginia did not enact such law. As of 1794, under the protection afforded by the Jay Treaty, British subject Sutherland retained title to his 1,000 acres in question.  Sidebar  John Radford died, gored by a boar in a hunting accident in 1817, before the Supreme Court decision was delivered the following year. Widow Harriet Kennerly Radford moved with her three children to Saint Louis, Missouri to live near her two brothers, James and George Kennerly, and ailing first cousin, Julia Hancock Clark. Julia's husband was William Clark. Julia passed in 1820 and Harriet became Clark's second wife in 1821. William Preston wrote a letter to George Washington describing the escalated attacks his surveyors and residents in Kentucky were facing. These deadly attacks were a prelude to Lord Dunmore's War and then the subsequent Illinois Campaign and Northwest Indian War. There is argument that this case, by extending rights to non-citizen individuals per federal treaties, exceeded United States Constitutional authority. New York lawyer Franklin Pierce contended in 1908 that land titles were domestic law and state statutes were wrongly overridden, specifying this case as an example. In 1984, Judge Robert Bork wrote a concurring opinion for the Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Republican case in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit which argued the courts cannot apply treaty rights without explicit private right of action specified in the treaty.

Born in Claremore, Oklahoma, Chambers graduated from Pleasant Grove High School in Pleasant Grove, Utah.http://www.deseretnews.com/preprecords/bb/bbiruns.html He played at three colleges and earned all-conference honors at all three. These included Dixie State, where he was an All-American in 1984. In 1985, Chambers transferred to Utah Technical College, then to Southern Utah, where he earned his degree in 1989. He began his coaching career in 1991 at Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas, where he remained until 1999. In his time with the Gaels, the team won six consecutive Sunset Division championships, and were the state runners up in 1997. Chambers was named NIAA Coach of the Year in 1992 and 1993. He also coached the Las Vegas Knights of American Legion Baseball, where he won three state championships and reached the 1998 American Legion World Series. In 2000, Chambers was hired to coach the Southern Nevada Coyotes baseball team, an NJCAA squad in Las Vegas. As the first Coyotes coach to manage a game (first coach Roger Fairless resigned prior to the program's first competition due to health issues), Chambers built the program to a major power, including seven conference championships, the regional titles, two district championships and the 2003 NJCAA World Series title. In 2010, Chambers coached the Bryce Harper-led Coyotes to the NJCAA Semifinals. In the summer of 2010, the Washington Nationals, who would later draft Harper first overall, courted Chambers to be a scout. Instead, a month later Chambers was introduced as the head coach at UNLV, following Buddy Gouldsmith's resignation. In his three seasons, the Rebels have reached 30 wins twice and claimed wins over several ranked teams, including Stanford, TCU, UC Irvine, and Arizona, while entering the rankings in both 2011 and 2013 themselves. Chambers was fired by UNLV in December 2015 after being arrested for driving under the influence. Chambers died on October 27, 2019.

Veith was professor of the zoology department at the University of Cape Town and taught in the medical bioscience department. During this time, the department was awarded a Royal Society London grant for zoological research. After joining the Seventh-day Adventist Church, he rejected the theory of evolution in favor of creationism and so had to give up teaching at the University of Cape Town. As a creationist, he speaks internationally on this and other topics. His lectures, videos, and books promote creationist and Adventist beliefs and doctrines. These include an evangelical understanding of the Bible with a very strong commitment to the Textus Receptus and the King James Version of the Bible. He also promotes a vegan diet and a belief in the imminent fulfillment of Biblical End Times and the return of Jesus Christ. Veith has written a number of books, including Diet and Health and The Genesis Conflict, which gives a biblical perspective and evidence claimed to support young earth creationism. He is the keynote speaker of Amazing Discoveries, a non-profit worldwide ministry based in British Columbia, Canada. Amazing Discoveries conducts seminars and streams by satellite, 24 hours a day, seven days a week on TV and satellite across North America and the world. Life=Childhood= Walter Veith was born in 1949 and grew up in a strict Catholic home. His mother, a Protestant, died early from cancer. Veith was told by his religion teacher that because of his mother's non-Catholic beliefs, she would \\"languish forever and ever\\" in hell. This prompted Veith to become an atheist at the age of ten. =Study= In 1971 Walter Veith began studying zoology at the University of Stellenbosch, where he graduated with a Master of Science in zoology. His thesis dealt with the propagation of dwarf chameleons. A two-year postgraduate course at the University of Cape Town followed in 1979. His thesis was an Autoradiographic and Electron Microscopic study of embryonic nutrition in the teleost Clinus superciliosus. He also attended lectures on zoology at the universities of Durban-Westville and Stellenbosch. Veith's research field is nutritional physiology, concentrating on the effect of modern animal husbandry on the incidence of disease transferral to humans. His research concentrates on degenerative diseases caused by incorrect nutrition and particularly on diseases such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, and also on fertility. Teaching and religious development After the graduation Veith, became an adjunct professor at the University of Stellenbosch and until 1987 gave lectures in zoology. Early in the 1980s, after his young son fell seriously ill and recovered, he and his wife returned to the Catholic faith. But a few years later he developed doubts about Catholicism and, through the influence of a craftsman who renovated his kitchen, he and his wife joined the Adventist faith. In his first lectures as an adjunct professor, he had had a student who rejected what she called the lie of evolutionism and instead maintained the truth of the biblical creation story. He soundly put her in her place. Now, his new faith and his own Bible studies led him to adopt this belief, which brought him into conflict with what he was teaching. Because of his lectures on the alleged scientific evidence for the biblical creation story he was asked to leave the University of Stellenbosch. He sold his house in Stellenbosch and accepted a position as associate professor at the University of the Western Cape in zoology. His serious concerns about the theory of evolution had been resolved by the proviso that he only needed to carry out research. The university closed temporarily due to race riots. This gave Veith the opportunity to travel to California and visit Ariel Roth, a creationist in charge of the Adventist Geoscience Research Institute, Loma Linda. He researched evidence of the biblical story of creation, and developed a series of lectures to present his findings. The following year Veith received a one-year contract at the University of Cape Town. His creationist lectures meant that his contract was not renewed, but he was hired in a research-only position at the University of the Western Cape. At this time, Veith began to hold lectures outside university. Initially, his talks were mainly to Adventist congregations in the United States, then in Canada, Australia and Europe. In his lectures on nutrition he promoted Adventist values such as vegetarianism and fasting. His first book was published in 1998 under the title of Diet and Health. In 1995 he became a full professor with tenure and the head of the Department of Zoology, the content also dealt with the theory of evolution after five years. He used his position among other things to promote his belief in creationism and to deny the theory of evolution, finding a fellow believer in these views in his colleague Quincy Johnson. In 1997 he published his results in The Genesis Conflict.Veith Walter, Genesis Conflict, Amazing Discoveries After conflicts at the University of the Western Cape due to their unorthodox views, Walter Veith and Quincy Johnson left the department of zoology. Johnson joined the Department of Microbiology, while Veith joined the Department of Physiology, where he worked until 2003. With this change, their right to teach zoology was withdrawn. Since his retirement from teaching physiology, Veith has devoted his time to pastoring. Lectures Veith teaches in his lectures the basic pillars of Adventism, which he believes are an extension of the Reformation's founding principles including Sola Gracia, Sola Christos, Sola Scriptura–Grace alone, Christ alone, the Bible alone and a pillar of the Reformation: the identity of the Antichrist. He states that Adventism has proceeded from the beliefs of the Reformation which eventually fell into creeds and made five key discoveries along with the Three Angels' Messages,\\"\\"Mission Statement of the Seventh-day Adventist Church \\". Official statement approved by the General Conference Executive Committee at the Spring Meeting in Silver Spring, Maryland, April 1993; and amended on October 10, 2004 which make the Adventist denomination unique: :\\"The Sanctuary doctrine—the whole plan of salvation laid out in type. The ceremonial law God gave to ancient Israel symbolizes Jesus' work throughout history. As the people started unraveling this plan, they began to understand the ministry of Jesus and what had happened on the day of their disappointment. :\\"Out of the sanctuary doctrine and the Great Disappointment, the great message of the Second Advent was formed, the truth about the Sabbath was recovered, A Biblical understanding of the state of the dead was unraveled, and the Spirit of Prophecy was established.\\" Veith has also presented lectures on diet, how it directly impacts numerous degenerative diseases including his findings of the negative effects caused by poor nutrition, such as osteoporosis, arthritis, and cancer. He also lectures on creationism. Veith's view of the KJV Bible Veith holds that some of the new versions of the Bible coming out came from manuscripts with corruptions introduced by the Alexandrian text and varies and is less reliable than the Majority Text. The Adventist church does not hold a KJV only view, although a number of Adventists continue to prefer the King James Version. Because of his 2004 lecture War of the Bibles Veith was denied access to SDA churches in Germany for a time but was reinstated in 2010. A periodical recommended that Veith \\"revise from scratch future comments on this topic to be balanced, fair and serious or to dispense with them\\".Textus Receptus and modern translations, In: \\"Advent Echo\\" (3 November 2004) 31. October 2004, accessed on 24 . March 2011 (PDF), 252 kB, the text appeared shortened in November 2004 in Advent echo ^, Advent Publishing maintains this online addition, these detailed version ready, which is provided with the following annotation: \\"amended October 31, 2004 This version is compared . improved slightly older versions The original drawing was created for the Austrian Union and published jointly by the faculty Bogenhofen \\"):\\".. Summary Much W. Veith is to appreciate its fundamental views and especially in his scientific lectures, as are his remarks on the subject of Bible translations and Textus Receptus regrettably one-sided, unbalanced, scientifically dubious and lead to unnecessary uncertainty. You can not be recommended. W. Veith should be strongly encouraged, therefore, to revise either future comments on this topic from scratch and they balanced, fair and serious offer up or not to do without them.\\" The Adventist Biblical Research Institute disagrees with Veith's view of Bible translations. Conspiracy theories Spectrum magazine, an independent periodical focusing on Adventism, refers to Walter Veith as the leading conspiratory voice within Adventism. Without specifically naming Veith, the church's official paper, the Adventist Review, has addressed Veith's conspiracy theories. Veith responded to the Review author explaining his views further. In May 2020 the head office of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Southern Africa, the Southern Africa Union Conference, issued a statement repudiating claims that Veith made the Jesus would come around or by 2027. He has also made claims in recent DVDs that the COVID-19 pandemic is one of the signs of the imminent coming of Christ - in line with his 2027 claim. This is not supported by the church he is a member of. Antisemitism accusation In a lecture in Nürnberg-Marienberg in October 2012 Walter Veith claimed that the Holocaust was used to \\"herd together\\" the Jews from all over Europe, so that they could be resettled in Palestine. The leadership of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Germany, Austria and Switzerland decided on 9 November 2012 that these statements were anti-Semitic and discriminatory. The church leaders took the view that they were \\"very close to criminal trivialization of the Nazi reign of terror\\". In December 2012, the Church leaders banned Veith from speaking in community centers and described his lectures as \\"conspiracy theories\\" and \\"spiritual abuse\\". However, various of the German Seventh-day Adventist groups are getting around this ban by inviting Walter Veith into larger, independent event halls. Amazing Discoveries and Walter Veith replied that the presentation was not meant to be anti-Semitic in any way, and they distanced themselves from anti- Semitism and racism. Veith blamed the accusation of anti-Semitism on \\"linguistic inadequacy\\", because German is a foreign language for him, adding that in Germany there is a \\"hypersensitivity\\" to statements about the persecution of the Jews. According to Amazing Discoveries Arno Hamburger, a member of Nuremberg City Council and first chairman of the Jewish Religious Community, speaking for the local Jewish community, expressed the view that there was no recognizable anti-Semitism in Veith's statement.

Before 1000 AD, Kano had been ruled as an Animist Hausa Kingdom. The Sultanate lasted until the Fulani jihad in 1805 and the assassination of the Last Sultan of Kano in 1807. The Sultanate was then replaced by the Kano Emirate, subject to the Sokoto Caliphate. The capital is now the modern city of Kano in Kano State. Location Kano lies to the north of the Jos Plateau, located in the Sudanian Savanna region that stretches across the south of the Sahel. The city lies near where the Kano and Challawa rivers flowing from the southwest converge to form the Hadejia River, which eventually flows into Lake Chad to the east. The climate is hot all year round. Rainfall is variable, ranging from 350mm to 1,300mm annually with the mean around 950mm, almost all falling during June–September period. Traditionally agriculture was based on lifting water to irrigate small parcels of land along river channels in the dry season, known as the Shadouf system. At the time when the kingdom was flourishing, tree cover would have been more extensive and the soil less degraded than it is today. Early history Our knowledge of the early history of Kano comes largely from the Kano Chronicle, a compilation of oral tradition and some older documents composed in the nineteenth century, as well as more recently conducted archaeology. In the 7th century, Dala Hill, a hill in Kano, was the site of a community that engaged in iron-working. It is unknown whether these were Hausa people or speakers of Niger–Congo languages. Some sources say they were Hausa speaking hunter/gatherers known as Abagayawa who migrated from Gaya. The Arab geographer al-Yaqubi, writing in 872/873 CE (AH 259), describes a kingdom called \\"HBShH\\" with a city named \\"ThBYR\\" ruled by a king called \\"MRH\\" (none of these words are vocalized, so their actual pronunciation can vary), located between the Niger Bend and the Kingdom of Kanem.al-Ya'qubi, \\"Tarikh\\" in Nehemiah Levtzion and J. F. P. Hopkins, transl, Corpus of Early Arabic sources for West African History (Cambridge University Press, 1981), p. 21. If the kingdom's name is vocalized as \\"Habasha\\" it would correspond with other Arabic language texts that also appear to refer to the Hausa, and would be the earliest reference to the Hausa region. Kano was originally known as Dala, after the hill, and was referred to as such as late as the end of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th by Bornoan sources. The Kano Chronicle identifies Barbushe, a priest of a Dalla Hill spirit, as the city's first settler.\\"Kano Chronicle\\" ed. H. R. Palmer in Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland 38 (1908) p. 63 (Elizabeth Isichei notes that the description of Barbushe is similar to those of Sao people.) According to the Kano Chronicle, Bagauda, a grandson of the mythical hero Bayajidda, became the first Hausa king of Kano in 999, reigning until 1063.\\"Kano Chronicle\\" ed. H. R. Palmer,pp. 64-65.H. R. Palmer, ed. and trans. \\"The Kano Chronicle\\" Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland 38 (1908), p. 65. His grandson, Gijimasu (1095–1134), the third king, began building city walls at the foot of Dalla Hill, and Gijimasu's son, Tsaraki (1136–1194), the fifth king, completed them during his reign. The Bagauda family steadily extended the kingdom through conquest of nearby communities. They established numerous sub-rulers, with titles starting with \\"Dan\\", of which the most important was \\"Dan Iya\\".\\"Kano Chronicle\\" ed. Palmer, pp. 66, 67. Rise of the Sultanate Ali Yaji (1349–85), accepted Islam from a people called the 'Wangarawa', a Soninke sub- tribe from Mali. He then relinquished the Cult of Tsumbubura, the principal cult of the patron goddess of Kano. According to the Kano Chronicle, in around 1350 the Cult of Tsumbubura, which was based in Santolo Hill, rebelled against Yaji. A civil war ensued, culminating in the Battle of Santolo. After his victory, Ali Yaji set out on a wave of conquests. He conquered Rano, extending Kano's reach and launched a successful expedition into the Kwararafa region.\\"Kano Chronicle,\\" ed. Palmer, pp. 70-72. According to the Kano Chronicle, in the reign of Kanejeji (1390-1410) the cult of Tsumbubura saw a momentary resurgence, after failing to pacify Zukzuk, the parent state of the Sultanate of Zauzau, Kanajeji reverted to Hausa Animism he introduced the armored cavalry Lifidi and using them, succeeded in subduing the Zukzuk occupying the city of Turunku. In the Reign of Umaru Kanejeji (1410-1421), Sufi Islam made its first inroads to Kano, The Kano Chronicle recalls Umaru's reign as that of peace and prosperity, He restored the Sultanate and strengthened religious institutions with Sufism. The reign of his successors; Daud and Abdullahi Burja presumably coincided with the rise of Amina Sukera, The fact that Turunku(Modern Zaria) was under Kanoan suzerainty suggests that the fabled Sultana known as Queen Amina, Founder of modern Zaria was a scion of the House of Gijimasu. Kanoan Empire In the reign of Muhammadu Rumfa, the Sultanate succeeded in maintaining its independence when the Sultan took the daughter of Askiya the great; Auwa as wife, later on the rebellion of Kanta of Kebbi against the Songhai allowed the sultanate to attempt expansion on former Songhai tributary states. Auwa later on became the first female Madaki of Kano and guided her grand son; Muhammadu Kisoki to assert the First Kanoan Empire. In his reign, the Sultan of Kano was Said to have ruled the whole of Hausa Land. Both Abubakar Kado (1565–73) and Muhammadu Shashere(1573–82) attempted to subdue Borno but failed, they however maintained Kano's hold on the rest of Hausa land and Kwararrafa. The Empire was to last until the reign of Muhammadu Nazaki(1618–23). a decline in trade throughout the Sudanic area possibly caused by environmental degradation has been cited as probable cause, ancient cities like Wadan and other Songhai strongholds experienced similar misfortunes. House of Kutumbi Muhammadu Kutumbi was the last Kanoan Sultan to preside over its Empire. In his regn, multiple rebellions slowly degraded the Empire, he eventually lost his life in attempt to subdue one at Katsina in 1648. By the time of Muhammadu Shekarau (1649–51) Kano had signed peace treaties with most of its former tributaries. The relative peace however exposed the House of Kutumbi to internal trifles. In 1652, Muhammadu Kukuna was overthrown this eventually led to the Second Kanoan Civil War. by the time he was restored the economy of the sultanate had been greatly devastated. Decline and Fall By the 1700s Fula clans, invigorated by their success in Takrur and the Futa area, were beginning to assert control over most of Sudanic West Africa. In Kano, the most powerful clan; the Jobawa were relatively pacified by a seat in the powerful council of state known as Taran Kano. Other clans were however wrestling with the sultanate for control. Economic decline had forced the successive sultans to raise taxations to the point that Tuareg clans were abandoning Kano. According to the Kano Chronicle, Mohammed Sharef (1703–1731) and his successor, Kumbari dan Sharefa (1731–1743), both engaged the Fula in major battles. The Fulani under the Sokoto Caliphate finally established control when Muhammadu Bakatsine, Leader of Jobe Clan of Fulani rebelled against Muhammadu Alwali Ibn Yaji, the last sultan of Kano. He was eventually deposed in 1805 and killed in 1807, Kano then became an emirate subject to Sokoto.

Holmes describes her weariness \\"of writers who had contacted me for a number of years during my intersex-activist days, trying to determine if their proposed ‘hermaphrodites’ could do things like impregnate or have sex with themselves\\", and how depictions of intersex people are \\"stalled\\", reifying \\"the proper place of traditional visions and modes of masculinity in opposition to femininity\\" or \\"beyond and outside the realm of gender altogether\\"; the character of Annabel/Wayne, in the Canadian novel Annabel by Kathleen Winter, provides an example of monstrous auto- impregnation. An intersex murderer plot twist trope has been repeated in the TV programs Nip/Tuck (Quentin Costa), Passions (Vincent Clarkson) and Janet King. This has been criticised as hackneyed and offensive, characterizing intersex people as deceitful. Examples of the medical dilemmas trope include the 2010 Childrens Hospital episode Show Me on Montana, the 2012 Emily Owens, M.D. episode Emily and... the Question of Faith, a 2009 episode of House entitled, 'The Softer Side', and Masters of Sex episode 3 in season 2, Fight.‘Masters of Sex’ Recap 2×3: ‘Fight’ , New York Observer, July 28, 2014. The MTV series Faking It marked the first intersex series regular in a TV show, Lauren Cooper, and also the first intersex character played by an intersex person, Raven. MTV worked with intersex civil society organization interACT on Faking It; the program was praised for creating a groundbreaking character. A Freaks and Geeks story has also been credited as commendable. In film, the character Rebeca Duarte in the movie Both was created by an intersex woman, Lisett Barcellos.

Chuck Jones, later to be famed as a director, is credited as animator on the short. This cartoon marks the final appearance of Gabby Goat. The short's working title was The Early Bird gets Porky. Summary The title screen changes seamlessly into a sign reading: \\"Get Rich Quick\\", followed by \\"For Sale/This lovely lot containing lots and lots/Oh!--Just oodles of OIL!\\" An oil tanker pulls into the lot, and the lot's owner, dogface con artist John Gusher, hooks the tanker to a sprinkler system to make it appear as if the land is saturated with natural crude oil, in hopes of luring some suckers to buy the otherwise worthless land. Out of the corner of his eye, he spies Porky Pig and Gabby Goat ascending the steps of the First National Bank, where Porky means to deposit the money contained in a sack that he is holding; Gabby eagerly tries to convince Porky not to deposit his money (this in a time when bank failures were still fresh in recent memory) and spend his savings on pleasure, like a yacht \\"or a chocolate soda or something;\\" Porky insists on getting his 2% interest. Mr. Gusher jumps in front of the two, barely introduces himself by way of a hastily drawn and withdrawn business card, and points out the plot just across the street. With Gabby egging him on, Porky signs the wayward oilman's deed and turns over his sack in exchange for the field. The two friends, having gathered some tools in the meanwhile, begin their excavation. Gabby, by means of a pickaxe, unearths a can of oil. A dog wanders onto the property and attempts to bury a bone, only to have it spat back at him by a small gusher; the dog has some further difficulties restraining the spouts of crude. Gabby rides a jackhammer as \\"The Merry-Go- Round Broke Down\\" plays, and, as he can not control the device, drills into the earth and out again, and in again, not to be seen again for several moments. We return to the dog, who is confronted by a gopher, who performs a magic trick: he flattens the soup bone with his hands, then causes it to appear out of the dog's left ear, to the canine's delight. The gopher then buries the bone for the dog to personally exhume: but the dog only gets a face full of oil, while the gopher magically removes the bone from his \\"volunteer\\"'s mouth and absconds with it to his subterranean lair, leaving the poor dog to howl in frustration! Returning to Porky, he hits a small squirt of oil that disappears quickly; when he hits the same spot again with his pickaxe, he discovers a piece of the sprinkler system and realizes he's been conned. An angry Porky confronts Gusher and demands his money back, but Gusher (feigning sincerity) offers only one dollar in return for the deed. Porky, reluctantly, begins to hand over the deed. By this point Gabby, still astride his jackhammer, is far beneath the earth. Just as Porky is about to accept Mr. Gusher's offer, Gabby hits a large vein of oil, which liquid then bursts through the surface and carries all of the major characters high into the air just before Gusher can get his hands on the deed. Porky realizes his new wealth and latches onto the deed, with Gusher also getting his hands on it and causing a tug of war battle. Gabby unintentionally strikes Gusher with the jackhammer, leading the crook to shout in pain and let go of the deed. Gabby and Porky fall to the ground, with Porky proudly holding the deed in his hand—only to find that instead, he has the dog's bone. A despondent Porky turns away, but his sulking is interrupted by the gopher; silently requesting the useless bone, the cheerful gopher transmutes the bone back into the deed, but only offers to return it if Gabby and Porky give the gopher a 50% share of the deed as \\"partners.\\" Availability Get Rich Quick Porky lapsed into the public domain in 1966. It has been widely distributed on discount media since then, usually in the form of poor-quality colorized prints.

The film is about a group of young women who hold a party at a disused warehouse where they are violently attacked by a gang of vagrants before a malevolent, supernatural force is unleashed. Plot The film opens with gloomy footage of night-time Dublin and a female radio DJ talking about three girls who recently went missing in the city centre. While in a pawnshop a young man (Eoin Macken) pawns his ring for cash, offered €50 he demands €200, and eventually accepts €75 and a second hand camcorder. He discovers a tape still inside, sits in a cafe, plays back the footage on the camera and watches the film. In the footage, a group of girls; Sienna (Kellie Blaise), Cara (Tereza Srbova), Louise (Vanessa Fahy) and Sian (Natalia Kostrzewa) are heading out for the 21st birthday of Corina (Siobhan Cullen). As a gift, Sienna and Cara have bought Corina a video camera, with which they plan to record the evening's events. They blindfold Corina and instead of going to a club they break into an disused, abandoned and ramshackled warehouse on a secluded back street, much to Sian's disapproval. Once there, they start drinking, Corina's boyfriend Barry (Sean Stewart) arrives, and they reminisce and share secrets. After Barry leads Sian to a toilet, the remaining girls complain and back-stab about Sian. Louise then takes the camera and discovers Barry having sex with Sian. Then three vagrant, violent men; Eamo (Brian Fortune), Scat (Karl Argue) and Hughie (Emmett Scanlan) break in and gatecrash the party. They terrorise, verbally torment, abuse, and physically and sexually assault the women, and the women scream and wail in fear and despair. Sienna tries to confront them only to be head-butted by Hughie. When Barry tries to intervene, Hughie beats him to death and instigates a game of spin the bottle to rape the women. Whilst Sian is being raped by Eamo, the lights go out, odd sounds emanate from the building, old televisions switch themselves on and a baby's haunting cries are heard. Moments later, Eamo is yanked from Sian by an unseen force, quickly followed by Sian herself. The negative energy from the brutality of the vagrants awakens a dormant, malevolent, demonic, supernatural force with a thirst for flesh and souls within the building. A brave Cara and hysterical Louise take the camcorder around the building, and try and escape using the narrow beam of the camera's built-in light via the labyrinthine, brick basements with decrepit corridors. They are approached by a Scat who is hysterical about something he has seen and begs them not to leave him alone. After shutting the door behind him, they find a dead Corina with her eyes gouged out. They then notice arches and ominous, arcane symbols and shapes signs on the walls in the dark. Louise enters a trance and is approached by a shambling, ghoulish, gore-covered, malign, emaciated naked figure (Patrick Moynan). A distressed Cara runs away and finds Sienna, they continue trying to find a way out from room to room but are trapped in the building. They are found by Hughie and shortly followed by The Creature. They break through a door leaving them behind, Sienna picks another lock, then Cara also enters a trance and is taken by The Creature. Sienna runs off through decrepit brick basements to a catacomb in an effort to evade The Creature, she discovers a dead workman and hides from The Creature before being followed and stalked by it, she then runs back, escapes from the warehouse and abandons the camcorder. After finishing watching the video, The Man uses the footage as a guide to retrace the steps to where the events occurred. The man tracks down the warehouse and makes his way into the basement. He walks into the aftermath and finds Sian and Louise. Sian cries for help as The Creature approaches, The Man tells her to be quiet and hides, she is then attacked and consumed by The Creature. After The Creature leaves, The Man then tries to rescue Louise, but while in a hypnotic trance she hits him over the head with a stone, escapes from the warehouse and is hit by a car.

The assault scene was performed in a single 14-minute take. Eion Macken states in the making-of that there are a lot of things in Irish history to inspire horror films; and he eschews banshees, leprechauns, and sídhe in favor of something more abstractly-formed (partly inspired by the worst in man, as well as possibly a paucity of imagination). Release The Inside premiered at Empire, Leicester Square as part of the London FrightFest Film Festival on 26 August 2012. The Inside (2010) – Discovery Screen 12:45* The film was released in UK cinemas on 3 January 2013. The DVD of the film was released on 25 March 2013. The film's UK television premiere was on the Horror Channel on 2 December 2013. Reception Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes has collected one negative review, resulting in a 33% approval rating. Tom Jollife of Scream Magazine said \\"Like Rec, The Inside is one of the most terrifying found footage films ever,\\" and described the film as \\"Paranormal Activity meets The Blair Witch Project...On steroids. Brilliant!\\" FlickeringMyth.com said \\"It's well acted, very naturalistic, but again, on a cinematic level, it's not easy to watch. The film is most interesting in the middle third as the film turns supernatural and we follow the camera holder and whoever she happens to be with. It's quite involving, making good use of a very creepy setting, especially the underground caverns.\\" Mark Adams of Screen Daily said \\"The violence is quite nasty, with the hand- held camerawork making it even more intense.\\" Wayne Simmons Zombie Hamster described the film as a \\"very effective film that shows with the right care and attention, and a talented cast and crew... It's well shot and produced with the best possible use made of its set...\\" Golden State Haunts And Events said \\"The Inside is a hard, violent, visceral psychological horror, which gets into your belly, and leaves an unnerving disturbed feeling after watching it.\\" Cine Outsider felt \\"the basics of a decent if unadventurous Found Footage horror are certainly here, and as someone who still has a soft spot for the subgenre and a fondness for torch-lit sequences set in dark and crumbling basements, I really wanted to like it a lot more than I did.\\" Stuart Willis of Sex Gore Mutants said \\"The Inside starts in a fairly unpromising manner but soon picks up thanks to the performances... The scenes where the guys terrorise the lasses is authentically intense, bringing to mind the infamous home invasion sequence from Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. Even the score at this point is reminiscent of John McNaughton's essential chiller...\\" They added the \\"film could probably terrify someone with little or no experience of the modern horror genre... the first 40 minutes are its most interesting and that the lack of original ideas in its latter half seriously hampered its clearly passionate attempts to scare audiences witless.\\" Horrorphilia said of the film \\"you don't have any character development at all... it is above average for a first person horror film... If you are a huge first person point of view type of horror fan lover then it's definitely worth a watch.\\" Joel Harley of Horror Talk said \\"despite the obvious ambition and talent behind the camera, the thing about The Inside is that it's actually unwatchable...\\" Screen Jabber said \\"The camera never stays still... Despite being a supposedly unedited recording, the film still cuts and the camera develops suspiciously artistic faults only at key points where it enhances the story. Brilliantly, this amateur footage being watched straight off a handycam comes with an ominous electronic score. The screenplay is nails on a blackboard excruciating. The girls alone are shrill, and annoyingly crass...\\" Brutal As Hell called it \\"...lazy, nonsensical, misogynistic, classist and a monumental waste of time... The Inside does nothing more than establish some horrible characters to be killed by some standard boogeyman, with no imagination, flair or talent in its repetitive execution.\\" Becky Bartlett of FrightFest said \\"The Inside is dull – filled with characters it is impossible to care about, flitting between psychological human chiller and unexplained, supernatural horror, with a desperately tedious screenplay, this is a confused movie with tacked on additions to compensate for a lack of focus or an interesting concept.\\" Anton Bitel of Little White Lies thought \\"The Inside offers a stale vision of inescapable entrapment that you, like these hapless partygoers, will wish would just end - and then suddenly it does, in a manner both arbitrary and unsatisfying. Dull to look at, and not much going on inside either.\\" Russ Gomm of Chris and Phil Present thought \\"If the film wasn't so painfully dull and technically inefficient it might have been able to take a reasonable idea and turn it into an interesting ten-minute short film, but this is not worthy feature film material.\\" Dread Central said the \\"'found footage' nightmare that will likely have even the most ardent fans of the subgenre legitimately debating whether the format is one of the worst things to ever happen in the world of horror.\\" See also *Found footage (pseudo-documentary) ReferencesExternal links  Category:2012 films Category:2012 horror films Category:2012 horror thriller films Category:Irish films Category:Irish horror thriller films Category:Irish supernatural horror films Category:English-language films Category:Camcorder films Category:Found footage films Category:2010s supernatural horror films Category:Films about rape Category:Films shot in the Republic of Ireland Category:Films set in Dublin (city) ","title":"The Inside (film)"},{"id":"41515120","text":"The Inside may refer to: *The Inside (TV series), 2005 American crime drama television series *The Inside (album), an album by Zebra & Giraffe *The Inside, a 2007 album by Moses Mayfield *The Inside (film), 2012 Irish horror film by Eoin Macken See also *Inside (disambiguation) *The Insider (disambiguation) ","title":"The Inside"},{"id":"41515128","title":"Sabirul Islam"},{"id":"41515130","text":"Mohammed Mahee Ferdous Jalil (; born 13 April 1973) is a Bangladeshi-born British businessman, founder of Channel S, owner of Prestige Auto Group and television presenter. Career Jalil founded Channel S which began broadcasting in December 2004. He founded Prestige Auto Group, which later became Diamond Auto Group – based in Walthamstow, London. He also presents talk show Reality with Mahee which airs every Thursday at 8.30 pm on Channel S. Controversy=Kidnapping= On 25 May 2011, Jalil was bundled into a car at gunpoint outside the offices of Channel S in Clifford Road, Walthamstow, London at 1:30 am. He was then driven to an Indian restaurant in West London where he was hooded, bound, beaten, tortured and repeatedly demanded £250,000 ransom. Jalil was eventually released by one of the kidnappers, driven to the edge of London's A406 North Circular Road and given £30 to get a taxi. Jalil made his way home, called the police, and was taken to hospital for treatment for burns and internal injuries. In June and July 2011, Mohammed Iqbal Hussain, 44, ATN Bangla CEO Hafiz Alam Bakhsh, 39, and businessman Sadek Ali, 41, were charged with conspiracy to kidnap. Later, Abul Aktar, 38, was also charged. In February 2012, after a month-long trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court, Bakhsh, Ali and Aktar were found not guilty of conspiracy to kidnap, Hussain was found guilty of conspiracy to kidnap, blackmail and assault causing grievous bodily harm. On 15 June 2013, Hussain was sentenced to a 32-year prison term (15 years for kidnap, 10 years for grievous bodily harm and 7 years for blackmail). Jalil suffered posttraumatic stress disorder and psychological difficulties from the physical and mental ordeal. =Insurance fraud= Jalil committed money laundering offences in 2008 while awaiting trial for conspiracy to defraud. On 4 August 2008, he was found guilty at Croydon Crown Court for conspiracy to defraud for car insurance fraud over \\"crash-for-cash\\" staged accidents between 2002 and 2003 and sentenced to an 18-month prison term. He was released after serving seven months of his term and made his first public appearance at the Channel S Community Awards on 30 March 2009. Jalil was on bail awaiting trial from the previous fraud when at the time he became involved in the next fraud. Between 2006 and 2010, he accepted at least £500,000 into bank accounts under his control and laundered some of the profits of a £3 million \\"crash-for-cash\\" scam, while knowing the money had been defrauded out of insurance companies. Jalil admitted to playing a background role behind Motor Alliance, an insurance company which made at least £1.17 million during the four-year scam. On 8 July 2013, he pleaded to guilty to money laundering and admitted to possessing criminal property between 19 July 2006 and 31 October 2010 under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 just before he was due to stand trial at Southwark Crown Court. Between November 2005 and October 2008, at least 124 claims were made by individuals linked to Motor Alliance, a company run by Jalil's brother, Mohammed Samsul Haque, a series of London-based accident management firms were used as a front to hide fraudulent insurance claims offering storage facilities and replacement vehicle hire. In October 2011, Haque and five other men were sentenced to a total of more than 12 years in prison following a Metropolitan Police Service investigation called Operation Scarp. Jalil was the final person to be prosecuted under Operation Scarp. In August, he was ordered to pay £84,000 to AXA Insurance. Jalil initially denied involvement in the scam, but pleaded guilty to money laundering when he appeared before the court in July 2014, just as he was due to stand trial at Southwark Crown Court. He was freed on bail until his sentencing hearing on 13 September. Sentencing was adjourned for a pre-sentence report to be prepared and a psychological report to deal with the incident leading Jalil suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. On 17 February 2014, he was sentenced to a three-year prison term for money laundering at Southwark Crown Court. He admitted possessing criminal property and was also banned from being a director for 10 years. He was the final person to be jailed under Operation Scarp.

In 2008 they finished at the bottom of the league without gaining a point. In 2009 Fermanagh Mallards won the Championship Cup against Cliftonville. In 2010 the team was promoted back into the Women's Premier League from the Women's Championship after beating Loughgall Lakers into second place. (archived at The Free Library) The club has also provided players for the Northern Ireland women's national football team. In June 2013 Fermanagh Mallards were ejected from the Women's Premier League by the Northern Ireland Women's Football Association because of a lack of players, which often led to numerous fines and loss of points during the 2013 season. The ejection came after the club did not travel to Belfast for a league cup match against Glentoran Belfast United L.F.C., the third time that the team forfeited a fixture during the season. As a result, Fermanagh Mallards were also banned from competing in the Women's Premier League during the 2014 season.

In August 1936, he suggested to Zamanillo that a Real Academia de Estudios Militares de la Comunión Tradicionalista is created, Jaime del Burgo Torres, Un episodio poco conocido de la guerra civil española.

Sending del Burgo to the front deprved Fal of an ally and facilitated Navarre falling to the rodeznistas, Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 218, Ugarte Tellería 1998, p. 293 pursues a somewhat competitive interpretation, namely that del Burgo’s departure to the front was intended as disposing of a dangerous radical, comparable to marginalization of the Rohm SA faction within Nazism He labeled occasional enthusiasm for unification a \\"collective psychosis\\".Blinkhorn 1975, p. 290; Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 59 To underline Traditionalist identity, he was commissioned to compile a concise doctrinal handbook, published in April 1937 as Ideario Tradicionalista.commissioned by Junta Carlista de Guerra de Vizcaya according to Garralda Arizcun 2008; the actual text available here Some scholars claim that the collaborationists intended to get rid of del Burgo, still active in national AET,in April of 1937 del Burgo engaged in AET congress, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 32 and send him abroad, as a Traditionalist tutor of Don Juan.Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 245, Iker Cantabrana Morras, Lo viejo y lo nuevo: Díputación-FET de las JONS.

Though in the mid-1930s he was fanatically loyal to the dynasty,Gonzales Calleja 2011, p. 191 following the death of Don Alfonso Carlos del Burgo only hesitantly accepted the regency of Don Javier;according to del Burgo, \\"la Regencia es la muerte de cualquier monarquía\\", César Alcalá, Valoración historica del carlismo: pasado y futuro, [in:] Arbil 79, available here instead, he advanced the cause of Don Carlo Pio as early as on the frontline in 1937.which, apparently, was quite popular in Tercio de Begoña, see here; before the Civil War the group named cruzadistas have advanced the cause of Don Carlos Pio; their paper La Fe concluded on 19.7.36 that if Don Javier is to become a regent, the only option is to declare Don Carlos Pio the king, César Alcalá, Cruzadistas y carloctavistas: historia de una conspiración, Barcelona 2012, , pp. 192-194. Though he did remain technically loyal to the regent, in 1940 del Burgo again publicly called for declaring Carlos Pio the Carlist king, Francisco de las Heras y Borrero, Un pretendiente desconocido. Carlos de Habsburgo. El otro candidato de Franco, Madrid 2004, , p. 52 When the latter officially raised his claim as Carlos VIII in 1943, del Burgo joined his followers - dubbed carloctavistas - and constructed a supporting dynastical interpretation.his theory was that Carlos V established a new dynasty; according to this version Don Javier, as not his descendant, represented another, non-Carlist dynasty, Jeremy MacClancy, The Decline of Carlism, Reno 2000, , p. 290 Unlike many Carlos VIII supporters he did not sympathize with the AxisDel Burgo blamed the Nazis for falangisation of Spain. His stance was also due to friendship with Jaime Lasuén, a French citizen and ex-combatant of Tercio de Begoña, who engaged in anti-Nazi French resistance. He sought refuge in Spain and was helped by del Burgo when on transit in Pamplona. He was later captured by the Francoist security in Madrid and given over to Gestapo; he died due to the tortures suffered. He handed del Burgo an envelope, to be collected by someone later on. Since no-one came to pick it up, del Burgo opened it years later and found that it contained an organigram of Nazi espionage network in the North of Spain; Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 273-4; see also here, and for an alternative view, see here and did not enter the first carloctavista executive of 1943.the provinvial carloctavista jefe in Navarra was initially Emilio Dean Berro, see Alcalá 2012, pp. 249-50, to be later replaced by Antonio Lizarza, Alcalá 2012, pp. 273-4, 311 It was only in 1945 that del Burgo became one of the Comunión Católico-Monárquica leaderstheoretically supporting prospective Carlist candidates did not breach the loyalty to Don Javier as a regent; according to some scholars del Burgo was clearly disloyal, see Mercedes Vázquez de Prada Tiffe, La reorganización del carlismo vasco en los sesenta: entre la pasividad y el \\"separatismo\\", [in:] Vasconia. Cuadernos de Historia-Geografía, 38 (2012), p. 107 and vice-president of the claimant's Navarrese Royal Council.Real Consejo del Reino de Navarra was presided by Emilio Dean Barro, Alcalá 2012, p. 276 Don Carlos Pio was only 3 years del Burgo's senior and equally radical; the two have forged a close relationship and exchanged a lengthy correspondence over the years.from 1944 to 1953, see here , samples re-printed in Heras y Borrero 2004, pp. 209-225 In the late 1940s Del Burgo's worked to capture new supporterslike Antonio Lizarza, Antonio Pagoaga, Antonio Cabañas, Francisco Ciganda, Alcalá 2012, pp. 298-304; in 1946 he was in daily touch with Cora y Lira, Alcalá 2012, p. 303, see also Heras y Borrero 2004, p. 72 and in 1950 he managed to reconstruct Navarrese AET as a carloctavista organization.Alcalá 2012, p. 319 However, at that time he was replaced as a key claimant's man in the province by Antonio Lizarza.Alcalá 2012, p. 306 The unexpected 1953 death of Don Carlos Pio left the carloctavistas puzzled. While most of the group focused on Carlos VIII's older brother Don Antonio and minor factions backed either his sons or another brother Francisco Jose, del Burgo advocated allegiance to the oldest daughter of Carlos VIII, Alejandra. According to del Burgo, having been a minor she would appear as \\"abanderada provisional\\", until the claim is passed to her anticipated male descendant.Heras y Borrero 2004, pp. 143-144 This option received scarce support and no faction was built around it.Heras y Borrero 2004, pp. 140-166.

When the carloctavista collaborationism crashed with the death of Don Carlos Pio,some scholars claim that carloctavismo was fractured even earlier, with the 1950 appearance of Juntas Ofensivas de Agitación Carloctavista by Cora y Lira, the carloctavistas which opposed collaboration with Franco, Alcalá 2012, p. 330 del Burgo was left disoriented. In the mid-1950s it was the mainstream Carlism which in turn commenced a possibilist strategy, with intransigence abandoned and Fal replaced by Valiente. None of the sources consulted offers any information on a would-be rapprochement (or hostility) between del Burgo and the Javieristas, though his Ideario still served as their doctrinal point of reference.for 1949 see Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 331, for 1964 see Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, El naufragio de las ortodoxias: el carlismo, 1962-1977, Pamplona 1997, , 9788431315641, p. 45 In 1958 he was appointed as representative of Navarre in the Falangist Consejo Nacional, a largely fictitious executive body which nevertheless automatically guaranteed membership in the Francoist quasi- parliament, Cortes Españolas;see Indice Historice de Diputados service, available here. For his appointment to Consejo Nacional see ABC 14.05.58, available here it is not clear what if any background mechanism elevated him to the position. Del Burgo served in Comisión de Leyes Fundamentales,ABC 03.06.58, available here though there is no information available on his stand versus the constitutional laws discussed. Though re-appointed in 1961,see Indice Historice de Diputados service, available here. he did not have his ticket prolonged in 1964; according to some sources, he resigned due to differences with Francoism.Diario de Navarra 25.10.05, Garralda Arizcun 2008 Don Carlos Hugo As a former radical aetista and an active collaborationist, he would have seemed a potential ally for the new generation of Carlist progressists, also revolutionary, socially-minded, AET members and apparently keen to exploit possibilist opportunities within Francoism. However, they preferred to jump on the older version of de Mella's sociedalismo and there is no trace of any link between del Burgo and the Huguistas.compare Martorell Pérez 2009 One source suggests that as Delegate of the Ministry of Information and Tourism he sabotaged their plans, preventing the presence of Carlos Hugo at the annual Montejurra gathering in 1964.Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 306; this version is not confirmed in Javier Lavardín [José Antonio Parilla], Historia del ultimo pretendiente a la corona de España, Paris 1976, pp. 231-234 Del Burgo is not mentioned as taking part in power struggle between Traditionalists and Progressists, which erupted within Carlism in the late 1960s,the most competent study on the issue, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, barely mentions del Burgo; another detailed study on Carlist ideological identity of the 1960s, Martorell Pérez 2009, refers to del Burgo only as a source though he maintained at least private contacts with Traditionalists like Manuel Fal Conde in 1969.\\"Lo único que he hecho en mi vida -y voy en los 56- ha sido trabajar para crear una familia a imagen y semejanza de la de mis mayores, y perpetuar en mis hijos -con éxito- las ideas y actitudes que en nosotros son ya tradicionales\\", a letter from del Burgo to Fal, quoted after Gemma Pierola Narvarte, Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, Entre la ideología y lo cotidiano: la familia en el carlismo y el tradicionalismo (1940-1975), [in:] Vasconia: cuadernos de historia-geografía 28 (1999), p. 52; Fal also appreciated del Burgo, see Manuel Martorell Pérez, Navarra 1937-1939: el fiasco de la Unificación, [in:] Príncipe de Viana 69 (2008), p. 439.

His works range from syntheses to monographs, biographies and case studies. As an amateur with no systematic training, he did not adhere to any specific methodology,Garralda Arizcun 2008 though he remained chiefly within the limits of political history and based his studies on thorough research in primary sources, mostly the printed ones. Del Burgo's key historical work is the monumental Bibliografía de las guerras carlistas (1953-1966), the opus which spanned across 5 volumes, cost 25 years of workit was this work which earned del Burgo the national literary prize in 1967, Garralda Arizcun 2008 and indexed more that 10,000 works; until today it remains a point of reference for all students of the subject.see e.g. José María Sanchez Nistal, Problemas y soluciones para la busqueda de información bibliografica en la investigación historica, [in:] Probemas actuales de la historia, Salamanca 1993, , 9788474817348, p. 15 Second to be listed is Historia General de Navarra (1978), a massive synthesis of the region's past, heavily based on his earlier works and the result of 10-year-research.Garralda Arizcun 2008; later Jaime Ignacio del Burgo Tajadura re-worked the volume and re-issued as a joint work, see Vanity Fair review available here Then come detailed studies related to the history of Carlism and Navarre, most prominent of them Carlos VII y su tiempo (1994) and La sucesión de Carlos II (1967). Del Burgo is also the author of Conspiración y guerra civil (1970), the work intended as a synthesis, though today it is – somewhat unintentionally – broadly used rather as a historical source.compare numerous references in Martorell Pérez 2009 Finally, he authored a number of minor publications ranging from petty contributions to popular booklets,Garralda Arizcun 2008 like Vida y hechos militares del mariscal de campo Don Juan Manuel Sarasa narrados por él mismo.co-authored with Juan Manuel Sarasa Many of his works form part of auxiliary sciences, bibliography or metabibliography, source criticism, or prosopography.Garralda Arizcun 2008, selected bibliography in Ainhoa Arozamena Ayala, Cristina Aznar Munárri, Jaime del Burgo Torres entry, [in:] Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia, available here As a historian del Burgo is praised for sound referential basis;Garralda Arizcun 2008 the critics usually point to his Carlist bias.José Luís Martínez Sanz, Historians and Historiography on carlismo: the difficult boundary between politics and science, [in:] Contributions 49 (2002), p. 115; he is also denounced for pursuing an utopian vision of a Navarrese-Carlist unity, as according to him, the Carlist wars \\"configuraron de manera permanente el caracter de esta region, asignandole el papel de defensora de las mas puras esencias hispanicas\\", quoted after Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, Navarra y el carlismo durante el régimen de Franco: la utopía de la identidad unitaria, [in:] Investigaciones históricas 17 (1997), p. 287-8 He is particularly criticized for an attempt to recalculate the number of victims of the Rightist terror in Navarre; other historians support 4 times higher figures.Del Burgo arrived at a total of ca 680 victims, while the figure advanced by many others is in the range of 2,000-3,000, compare José María Jimeno Jurío, La Gierra Civil en Navarra (1936-1939), Pamplona 2006, , Ramón Salas Larrazábal, Los Fusilados en Navarra en la Guerra de 1936, Madrid 1983, , Mari Jose Berrio Zaratiegui, Juan Carlos Esparza Zabalegi, José Mari Ruiz Vilas, Navarra 1936 - de la Esperanza al terror, Altafulla 2003, This controversy coincides with the fact that del Burgo was personally accused of a war crime,see the account of Francisco Inza Goñi in Navarra 1936 - de la Esperanza al terror, p. 483, widely quoted in cyberspace, compare here the charge that left him very embitteredaccording to del Burgo’s own account the case was exactly the opposite: he did his best to prevent war crimes, e.g. saving republican POWs from execution by incorporating them into requeté units, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 85 and which he always denied;\\"Del Burgo, mientras vivió, dijo una y otra vez a quien le quiso oir que no había matado a nadie fuera del campo de batalla y mucho menos en Pamplona\\" quoted after kaosenlared.net available here it is also disqualified by some historians.moreover, some claim he saved lives of Leftist activists like Telesforo Monzon or Juan Arrastia, see EKA site available here, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 117 As an amateur he has never assumed academic duties,Ainhoa Arozamena Ayala, Cristina Aznar Munárri, Jaime del Burgo Torres entry, [in:] Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia refer to him as \\"profesor mercantil\\", though no trace of his academic or otherwise teaching activity is found elsewhere though he became member-correspondent of Real Academia de la Historia;Diario de Navarra 25.10.05, Garralda Arizcun 2008 for his bibliographical work del Burgo received the National Literary Prize in 1967.ABC 25.10.05, available here Writer a valley in Navarrese Pyrenees Del Burgo commenced his literary career in the early 1930s, publishing short dramas revolving around episodes from the Carlist history and sometimes played at the local party circulos: Lealtad (1932), Cruzados (1934) and Al borde de la traición (1936).Ainhoa Arozamena Ayala, Cristina Aznar Munárri, Jaime del Burgo Torres entry, [in:] Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia Calibrated as praises of old Carlist virtues and with clear moralizing objectives,Ainhoa Arozamena Ayala, Cristina Aznar Munárri, Jaime del Burgo Torres entry, [in:] Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia, Ugarte Tellería 1998, p. 278, Blinkhorn 1975, p. 211; according to Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, \\"Esa ciudad maldita, cuna del centralismo, la burocracia y el liberalismo\\": la ciudad como enemigo en el tradicionalismo español, [in:] Actas del congreso internacional \\"Arquitectura, ciudad e ideología antiurbana, Pamplona 2002, , p. 92, del Burgo’s dramas were \\"ejemplos de teatro carlista tradicionalista\\" they are classified as costumbrismo nostalgico.\\"todos ellos coinciden en reflejar en sus obras cómo la perniciosa influencia de lo foráneo va pervirtiendo las sanas y católicas costumbres locales de la Navarra ‘auténtica’\\", Javier Dronda Martínez, Con Cristo o contra Cristo.

Propaganda, testimonio y memoria creativa, Alicante 2010, p. 240 After the break of the 1960s and 1970s, dedicated mostly to historical research, del Burgo returned to drama with Llamada sin respuesta (1978), to poetry with Soliloquios: en busca de un rayo de luz perdido (1998)Ainhoa Arozamena Ayala, Cristina Aznar Munárri, Jaime del Burgo Torres entry, [in:] Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia; the sub-title is a commentary to del Burgo losing his eyesight in the last years of his life, Garralda Arizcun 2008 and to prose with La Cruz del fuego (2000), a well-documented adventurous intrigue from the times of Henry I of Navarre.Carlos Mata-Indurain 2002, p. 935 Though heavily contributing to Carlism in literature, Del Burgo has not made it to the history of Spanish belles-lettres of the 20th century, be it either general synthetic accountsDel Burgo is entirely missing in synthesis of Spanish literature like Santos Sanz Villanueva, Historia y crítica de la literatura española, vol. 8/1 (Epoca contemporanea 1939-1975), Barcelona 1999, , Domingo Yndurain, Historia y critica de la literatura española 1939-1980, vol. 8 (Epoca contemporanea 1939-1980), Barcelona 1981, Jordi Gracia, Domingo Ródenas, Derrota y restitución de la modernidad: literatura contemporánea, 1939-2009, Madrid 2009, , Jean Canavaggio, Historia de la literatura española, vol. 6 (El siglo XX), Barcelona 1995, or encyclopedias and dictionaries.compare Jesus Bregante, Diccionario espasa.

Appreciated for documentary value, del Burgo's novels are described as production of scarce esthetic and literary value, very repetitive in terms of its structures, primitive in terms of narration and Manichaean in terms of personalities.Carlos Mata, La aportación de Navarra a la literatura española, [in:] Jaime Ignacio del Burgo (ed.), Vascos y Navarros en la Historia de Espana, Pamplona 2007, , p. 366 Present-day scholars point to two interesting features of his novels. One is a strong Basque ethnic sentiment, calibrated in pre-nationalist, sabinan terms of an ancient Basque Eden.Francisco Javier Caspistegui, Historia oral, inmaterial e intrahistoria en la recuperación de la memoria colectiva de la Navarra rural, [in:] Gerónimo de Uztariz 23-24 (2008), p. 211; Basque threads were present though not key in many of his works; in fact, he insisted on different ethnic origins of alaveses, vizcainos, guipuzcoanos and navarros, see Iñaki Iriarte López, Euskaros, nacionalistas y navarristas. Ideologías del pacto y la agonía en Navarra, [in:] Revista Internacional de los Estudios Vascos 44 (1999), p. 59 Another is equally idyllic rustic thread, advancing a fairly typical Carlist praise of ruralismo and mistrust towards urban life.Caspistegui Gorasurreta 2002, pp. 80-81 Order of Alfonso X the Wise Del Burgo's novelist work was acknowledged by Premio de Literatura y Periodismo de la Secretaria General de FET (1954).ABC 23.12.54, available here Apart from the national prize of 1967, he was also rewarded by the Bayonne-Pamplona International Competition Award (1963),Garralda Arizcun 2008 Fundacion de Larramendi Award (1993)see Fundación Ignacio Larramendi site, available here and Badge of the Order of Alfonso X the Wise (1997), conceded by the Ministry of Education and received in Pamplona in May 1999 from the then Minister of Education and Culture, Mariano Rajoy.Diario de Navarra 25.10.05 Permanent Councilor of Institución Príncipe de Viana,El Mundo 26.10.05, available here himself he has never received the Viana Cultural Prize, set up in 1990 and awarded by the Government of Navarre.though was nominated in 2001, Diario de Navarra 25.10.05 See also * Carlism * Requeté * Francoism * Carloctavismo * Carlo-francoism FootnotesFurther reading * César Alcalá, Cruzadistas y carloctavistas: historia de una conspiración, Barcelona 2012, * Jaime Ignacio del Burgo Tajadura (ed.), Jaime del Burgo.

Between 1745 and 1781 he compiled a manuscript entitled \\"Diseases in Virginia.\\" He was a physician who attended about 85 households during a smallpox epidemic of 1747/8. Physician to future 1st Family In 1769, Colonel George Washington, as he was known then, frequently called in Dr. Sequeyra to treat his stepdaughter \\"Patsy,\\" daughter of Martha Park Custis. Patsy suffered from increasingly debilitating epileptic seizures which eventually led to her death.Custis Papers 1765-1769 (Virginia Historical Society) Physician to the insane In 1773, the first insane asylum in the 13 colonies, Eastern State Hospital was built in Williamsburg, Virginia, and it remains in operation to this day. Dr. John de Sequeyra was one of the first physicians attached to the facility. So accomplished in caring for the residents, was Dr. Sequeyra, that when he retired in 1795 it took two doctors to back-fill his position.

The series focuses on the work and home life of a fictionalized version of actor and comedian Drew Carey. The episode first aired on November 12, 1997 on ABC in the United States. The episode's plot sees Mr. Wick (Craig Ferguson) pass off caring for his boss Mrs. Lauder's (Nan Martin) Hungarian Puli to his employee Drew (Drew Carey). When Drew has the prize-winning dog shaved and neutered, he and his friends decide to perform a striptease at the local bar, The Warsaw Tavern, to earn quick cash to buy a replacement. The episode was co-written by producers Robert Borden and Deborah Oppenheimer, while Steve Zuckerman directed. It was inspired by the British comedy film The Full Monty and Carey invited four of the film's cast members to appear in the episode. \\"The Dog and Pony Show\\" was shot on October 15, 1997 at the Warner Bros. Television studios in Burbank, California. The set was closed to the usual taping audience while the cast performed their striptease routine. \\"The Dog and Pony Show\\" was seen by an estimated 12.4 million viewing households, finishing in 15th place in the ratings for the week it aired. Critical response was mostly positive, with reporters praising the script and the striptease routine. Plot When Mr. Wick (Craig Ferguson) is asked to look after Mrs. Lauder's (Nan Martin) prize- winning Hungarian Puli, he decides to pass the task on to his employee Drew (Drew Carey). Kate O'Brien (Christa Miller) offers to take the dog, Lucky, to Drew's house; but she has to leave suddenly to pick up her boyfriend Oswald (Diedrich Bader). Drew does not see Kate's note and assumes Lucky is a stray. He takes it to the vet to get it shaved and neutered. When Kate sees the dog, she fears that she, Drew and Mr. Wick will be fired. She finds an advertisement for a pure bred Hungarian Puli, but it costs $4,500. Since no one has that kind of money, Oswald suggests they sell their bodies for money. Inspired by The Full Monty, the guys decide to perform a striptease at The Warsaw Tavern to make the money they need. Lewis Kiniski (Ryan Stiles) backs out of the performance at the last minute, but Larry Almada (Ian Gomez) steps in as his replacement. With the bar full, the guys begin their routine, but are soon stopped by the police, who explain that due to zoning regulations, stripping is illegal at The Warsaw. Drew and the guys go before the city council, but their request is denied. Drew questions how the council can deny something without seeing it and the guys, including Lewis, decide to demonstrate their striptease routine before the council members. Their request is then approved. After performing the striptease at the bar, Drew counts out the money and finds that they have $4,800. Mr. Wick asks what they should do with the extra money and Drew replies that they should give it to the people that earned it. He then walks off stage and into the audience and starts handing out the extra cash, apologizing for them having seen his naked buttocks. Production Mark Addy and three other Full Monty cast members appeared in the episode. \\"The Dog and Pony Show\\" was co-written by producers Robert Borden and Deborah Oppenheimer, and directed by Steve Zuckerman. The episode was inspired by the British comedy film The Full Monty. Following its release in the United States, Drew Carey saw the film three times and loved it so much he invited the cast to appear in the episode, while they were promoting the film. However, Andrew Essex from Entertainment Weekly reported that cast members Mark Addy, Paul Barber, Steve Huison and Hugo Speer were not allowed to perform on the show after being stopped by the American immigration department because they did not have work permits. The cast members were instead billed as \\"guests of honor\\" due to Actors Equity rules preventing them from being paid for their cameo. The episode was filmed at the Warner Bros. Television studios in Burbank, California on October 15, 1997. The set was closed to the usual taping audience when Carey, Bader, Ferguson, Gomez and Stiles performed their striptease to The Edgar Winter Group's \\"Free Ride\\". The Full Monty cast members came to the set to offer advice and watch the taping. The remainder of the episode was filmed before an audience later that same night. Gomez said that having two guys paint his body in make-up was \\"more embarrassing\\" than filming the routine, while Stiles joked that the episode was the first time he had been \\"totally naked\\" since he was cast in the show. Carey was grateful that stripping during prime-time had to be PG and apologized that viewers had to see his naked buttocks. He also clarified that the cast wore pouches to protect their modesty. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"The Dog and Pony Show\\" finished 15th in the ratings for the week of November 10–16, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 12.8, equivalent to approximately 12.4 million viewing households. It was the fourth highest-rated show on ABC that week, following episodes of Home Improvement, Monday Night Football and 20/20. The episode received mostly positive attention from television critics. A reporter for the Los Angeles Daily News gave the episode a positive review calling it \\"meatier\\" than usual. The reporter thought the take on The Full Monty was \\"sharply silly\\" and said \\"Carey's striptease doesn't come till the show's end. The most we see is a full rear view – raw indeed but strategically blocked by microphones. But the bun fun, half-baked as it is, is exuberant and preceded by smarter writing than usual.\\" The reporter called the characters \\"unlikely Chippendales\\" and added that Carey had one of the best scripts he had in a while, which mixed \\"understated humor with unself-conscious undress.\\" Alan Pergament, writing for The Buffalo News, awarded the episode 3 and a half stars out of five and said the episode \\"offers a delicious take on the surprise theatrical movie hit from England.\\" Pergament thought there were too many penis jokes, especially for the show's time slot, but called the dance scenes \\"hysterically funny.\\" The Spokesman- Review's John Martin stated that while he usually condemned the \\"cheap, tawdry use of nudity\\" to boost ratings, it was different with Carey and he thought the take on The Full Monty was \\"riotous\\" and \\"wild\\". Martin finished by saying \\"Carey may be the only comic in prime time who could pull this off, so to speak. You gotta love the big guy.\\" Lon Grahnke from the Chicago Sun-Times gave the episode three stars. The Chicago Tribune's Steve Johnson said the show was \\"working at its usual level\\" and called the homage to The Full Monty \\"uninspired\\". A reporter for The Age chose \\"The Dog and Pony Show\\" as one of the shows Melbourne would be talking about the week it aired in Australia. While The Sun-Herald's Rachel Browne awarded the episode four out of five stars and called it an \\"hilarious homage to The Full Monty\\". Browne was thankful that the gang's modesty was protected. James Joyce, writing for The Newcastle Herald, commented that the episode was \\"a crack-up.\\" Joyce later branded the plot \\"contrived\\", but thought the end of the episode was \\"risque\\" and \\"suitably cheeky.\\" NotesReferencesExternal links * * \\"The Dog and Pony Show\\" at TV.com * \\"The Dog and Pony Show\\" at TBS Category:The Drew Carey Show episodes Category:1997 American television episodes ","title":"The Dog and Pony Show"},{"id":"41515459","text":"Spicks and Specks is an Australian music-themed comedic television quiz show, a revival of the original Spicks and Specks series that was telecast on ABC1 for seven seasons and 277 episodes. The new show started on Wednesday 5 February 2014. It was recorded and produced at the ABC Broadcasting Studios in Elsternwick, Victoria. On 30 May 2014, ABC programmer Brendan Dahill announced that the show would not be renewed for a second season because it \\"hasn't resonated with viewers to the degree we had hoped.\\" The show was pulled from the schedule after episode 20 has screened, with the final six shows of the 26 shows recorded airing during late 2014. The reason why this happened was because Josh Earl's second child was born at this point. Premise of the show  The show was hosted by stand-up comedian Josh Earl, who posed questions to two teams each headed by permanent team captains, singer/songwriter Ella Hooper and radio presenter/comedian Adam Richard. The overall style of the show is a mix of music and comedy. The revival includes a refreshed format and new games. Delayed relaunch  The revival of the show was originally announced in November 2012, during the ABC 2013 program launch but the network decided to delay the relaunch until 2014. ABC executives were reportedly upset when news of the return of the show in 2014 was prematurely leaked before the intended official announcement.
