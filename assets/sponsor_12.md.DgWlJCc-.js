It was passed with 75% approval (63% in Nuuk) and a 72% turnout. The non-binding referendum was on expanded home rule in 30 areas, including police, courts, and the coast guard; gave Greenland a say in foreign policy; provided a more definite split of future oil revenue; and made the Greenlandic language the sole official language. The referendum was announced by Prime Minister Hans Enoksen on 2 January 2008.Ukiortaami oqalugiaat 2008 Namminersornerullutik Oqartussat, 2 January 2008 Enoksen also announced the launch of an information and discussion campaign on the issue of self-government. This included town hall meetings throughout the country.Namminersorneq pillugu paasititsiniaaneq Namminersornerullutik Oqartussat, 7 January 2008 Background Greenland became a Denmark‚ÄìNorway colony in 1775 and was made a province of Denmark in 1953. In 1979, it was made an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark, with a parliament and local control of health care, schools, and social services. In 1985, it withdrew from the then European Economic Community (now known as the European Union) to maintain control of fishing in its waters. There has been some movement towards independence, encouraged by Denmark but held back by Greenland's need for economic subsidies. A 2003 report from the Commission on Self-Governance outlined six possibilities for the future of Greenland. Namminersornerullutik Oqartussat These were: * Independence * Union with another country, or otherwise known as a personal union with Denmark, similar to the former Kingdom of Iceland (1918‚Äì44) * Free association, similar to the relationship between Palau and the United States, or the United Kingdom to its Dominions such as Canada and Australia at the beginning of the 20th century. * Federation * Increased self-government beyond the then-existing home rule. * Complete integration Proposal and expansion of home rule Although it was a non-binding referendum, the Danish parliament supported it and promised to honour its results. The expansion of home rule took effect on 21 June 2009, the 30th anniversary of the establishment of home rule, when the Act on Greenland Self-Government took affect. Greenland gained greater control of the police, coast guard, and courts. In addition, the Greenlandic language became the sole official language. Oil revenues will be divided differently, with the first 75 million Danish kroner (US$13.1 million) going to Greenland, and the remaining revenue split evenly with Denmark. Greenland's subsidies from Copenhagen will be phased out. The subsidy is currently 3.5 billion kroner ($588 million) per year, which accounts for about one-third of the island's gross domestic product of 10.5 billion kroner and almost two-thirds of the total income of the home rule government of 6.1 billion kroner. Greenlanders are also recognized as a separate group of people under international law,. The changes were met with skepticism from some Danish politicians. Per √òrum J√∏rgensen, who helped negotiate the agreement, said that it may be \\"30‚Äì40 years\\" before Greenland is ready to take charge of itself. MP S√∏ren Espersen from the Danish People's Party controversially claimed that Greenlanders had been \\"brainwashed with unprecedented propaganda\\" and that he believed \\"huge problems are waiting in the future\\".

Overview  This is a method similar to tf-idf but it deals with finding keywords suitable for information retrieval and ones that are not. Please refer to Vector Space Model first. This method uses the concept of Vector Space Density that the less dense an occurrence matrix is, the better an information retrieval query will be. An optimal index term is one that can distinguish two different documents from each other and relate two similar documents. On the other hand, a sub-optimal index term can not distinguish two different document from two similar documents. The discrimination value is the difference in the occurrence matrix's vector-space density versus the same matrix's vector-space without the index term's density. Let: A be the occurrence matrix A_k be the occurrence matrix without the index term k and Q(A) be density of A. Then: The discrimination value of the index term k is: DV_k = Q(A) - Q(A_k)  How to compute  Given an occurrency matrix: A and one keyword: k * Find the global document centroid: C (this is just the average document vector) * Find the average euclidean distance from every document vector, D_i to C * Find the average euclidean distance from every document vector, D_i to C IGNORING k * The difference between the two values in the above step is the discrimination value for keyword K A higher value is better because including the keyword will result in better information retrieval.  Qualitative Observations  Keywords that are sparse should be poor discriminators because they have poor recall, whereas keywords that are frequent should be poor discriminators because they have poor precision.

Early life and career Nyagua was born in the early 1800 in Kenema in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone. Nyagua ruled a great realm, covering much of the territory between modern Kenema and Sefadu in the Eastern Province. He conquered many outlying districts to enlarge his domain, but some came voluntarily under his control. Nyagua built up an impressive capital at Panguma, and is said to have possessed a vast number of slaves and about four hundred wives. As British power increased in the Sierra Leone hinterland, Nyagua realised that he did not have the strength to resist it. He therefore co-operated with the British on several occasions by signing a treaty of friendship, capturing warriors who had raided a customs post, and sending a son to be educated in Freetown. But Nyagua saw himself as a friend, and not a vassal or servant of the British. He was the king of a small allied state, and felt that he deserved the respect of a sovereign ruler. When a travelling British Commissioner called Nyagua to a meeting abruptly at his own convenience, the Mende King refused to attend; and when the British Governor sent an \\"order\\", Nyagua replied that he must take up the matter with his elders first as custom required. British officials began to see Nyagua as arrogant and troublesome, despite his obvious co-operation; and when the 1898 Rebellion erupted, led by Temne chief Bai Bureh the British ordered his immediate arrest. Nyagua had commanded his people to remain at peace for their own protection, and his followers attacked the British only after the arrest of their king. Nyagua was taken to Freetown on \\"suspicion of disloyalty\\" and sent along with Bai Bureh into exile in the Gold Coast (now Ghana) from which he never returned to his homeland, instead he died in the Gold Coast. Even the British officials acknowledged that Nyagua had committed no hostile act, but they felt his influence was too strong for him to remain a chief in their new Protectorate. He was among the last of Sierra Leone's independent warrior-kings.

In 2006, he was named Presidential Distinguished Professor at the University of Guelph, and in 2011 he was the Shastri Indo-Canadian Institute's Canadian Lecturer to India. Education Russon received his Ph.D. in 1990 from the University of Toronto. His dissertation was entitled Hegel on the Body. Research Russon is known for his original philosophical contributions, and also for his scholarly interpretations of G.W.F. Hegel, Contemporary Continental Philosophy and Ancient Philosophy. =Original philosophy= Russon is known as an original philosopher, primarily through his books Human Experience, Bearing Witness to Epiphany, and Sites of Exposure. Leonard Lawlor describes Russon as \\"one of the few original voices working in Continental Philosophy today.\\"Cited on the cover of Bearing Witness to Epiphany, (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2009) Human Experience, which won the 2005 Broadview Press/Canadian Philosophical Association Book Prize, brought together themes from Hegel, Contemporary Continental Philosophy and Ancient Philosophy, and produced an original interpretation of the development of personal identity.David Morris, John Christman, and John Stuhr, Symposium on Human Experience by John Russon, Dialogue 45 (2006):307-354 In this work Russon argues that the experiences through which we are inaugurated into any distinctive domain of meaning necessarily leave the stamp of their specific (and contingent) character on our subsequent experiences in that domain. He uses this notion to interpret the significance of family experience in the formation of personal identity, and he finds this aspect of our experience to be the key to understanding mental health (and mental illness).Leonard Lawlor, Review of Human Experience by John Russon, Continental Philosophy Review 39 (2006):215-222 Russon's approach to mental health‚Äîin particular his interpretation of neurosis‚Äîis specially striking for its bringing together of the theme of embodiment that has been prominent in existential phenomenology with the theme of dialectical self-transformation that is prominent in the philosophy of HegelLewis Livesay, \\"Kafka's The Metamorphosis: Gregor's Da-Sein Paralyzed by Debt,\\" Analecta Husserliana 86 (2007): 367-393 and with the theme of the \\"system\\" of family life that is prominent in the work of such psychologists and family theorists as Salvador Minuchin, R.D. Laing and D.W. Winnicott.Aaron R. Denham, \\"Rethinking Historical Trauma: Narratives of Resilience,\\" Transcultural Psychiatry 45 (2008): 391-414 This work is also important for its use of these ideas to criticize the \\"individualist\\" premises of much political and economic theory,Bernard Hodgson, \\"The Conundrum of Moral Evaluation in Economics,\\" Chapter 4 of Christopher Cowton and Michaela House (eds), Trends in Business and Economic Ethics, (Springer, 2008), p. 113. and to develop of a political theory of multiculturalism.Real Fillion, Multicultural Dynamics and the Ends of History, (Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press, 2008), pp 72-86. His interpretation of the dynamic and transformative role of sexuality (eros) provides an important link between his work and the philosophy of Plato. The importance of sexuality to personal development, and especially its relationship to ethical life and to artistic creativity is further explored in Bearing Witness to Epiphany. Like Human Experience, this work stands out for its emphasis on the way that the important dimensions of our experience are embodied in the most basic material dimensions of our lives‚Äîeveryday \\"things\\" and basic bodily practices‚Äîand this work thus offers a new metaphysics of \\"the thing\\" and of reality in general, arguing that issues of metaphysics cannot be separated from issues of ethics. His most recent book, Sites of Exposure, broadens the perspective of these earlier books to address issues of politics and history. Russon analyzes the dynamic process by which we make ourselves at home in a culture, and at the same time come into conflict with other cultures. Investigating this process throughout history, with a special emphasis on ancient Athenian democracy, the history of Islam, and the history of British Empire in Asia, Russon argues for a pluralist multiculturalism as the only viable political direction. He concludes the book with a study of art, which is relevant because it is art that can transform our perspective in a way that opens us to the new possibilities of social and cultural life that are necessary if we are to get beyond simple situations of cultural conflict. He offers original studies of Thomas Cole, Rachel Whiteread, Anselm Kiefer, and Gerhard Richter, among others. =History of philosophy= In addition to his original philosophical contributions, Russon has also published substantial scholarly work in the history of philosophy. Hegel Though his doctoral supervisor was the Heidegger scholar Graeme Nicholson, his interpretation of Hegel's philosophy is more often thought of as continuing the tradition of his teacher H.S. Harris (1926‚Äì2007),http://pi.library.yorku.ca/dspace/handle/10315/883 the pre-eminent Hegel scholar in the English-speaking world. Russon's Hegel-interpretation is also distinctive because of its attempt to show the continuity of Hegel's philosophy with the philosophical traditions of phenomenology, existentialism and deconstruction. This interpretation has been developed through many scholarly articles, and especially through three books: The Self and Its Body in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit,reviewed by H.S. Harris, Owl of Minerva 1998, John Thomas, Bulletin of the Hegel Society of Great Britain, 39/40 (1999): 129-30, and Christopher Field, Review of Metaphysics, 2000. Reading Hegel's Phenomenology,reviewed by John McCumber, Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews, June 16, 2005. and Infinite Phenomenology: The Lessons of Hegel's Science of Experience.reviewed by Michael Vater, Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews, June 10, 2016, and Timothy L. Brownlee, Canadian Society for Continental Philosophy, June 24, 2016 Contemporary Continental philosophy Russon's philosophical orientation is largely derived from existential phenomenology, and he has published a number of scholarly articles in this area, especially focusing on the work of Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Jacques Derrida. His most recent works include, \\"The Self as Resolution: Heidegger, Derrida and the Intimacy of the Question of the Meaning of Being,\\" and \\"The Spatiality of Self-Consciousness: Originary Passivity in Kant, Merleau-Ponty and Derrida.\\" Ancient philosophy Russon is also known as a scholar of ancient philosophy, especially for his use of the methods of 20th Century European philosophy (phenomenology, hermeneutics and deconstruction) to interpret the texts of Plato and Aristotle. Along with John Sallis, he organized an influential conference at the Pennsylvania State University in 1997 entitled \\"Retracing the Platonic Text,\\" (the papers from which were published as Retracing the Platonic Text by Northwestern University Press in 2000).reviewed by Kevin Corrigan, Philosophy in Review, 21 (2001): 373 This conference helped to inaugurate the growing North American movement to interpret the texts of Greek Philosophy through the lens of Contemporary Continental Philosophy, a movement especially associated with the Ancient Philosophy Society. He is currently the editor of a book series from Northwestern University Press entitled Rereading Ancient Philosophy, a series that publishes books on ancient philosophy that are informed by the insights of continental philosophy. Teaching Russon has supervised the dissertations of many current professors of philosophy across North America on topics in Plato, Aristotle, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, John Dewey and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Russon has held academic appointments at Harvard University, the University of Toronto, Acadia University, the Pennsylvania State University, Stony Brook University, and the University of Guelph. He is also the founder and main organizer of the Toronto Seminar, an annual private seminar for the study of philosophy, held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

His story is featured prominently in The Emperor's Birthday, the 1993 documentary by John Dollar. By Papa Dyer's own account, he was converted to Rastafari after seeing Mortimer Planno speak in 1959. Like many young Jamaicans at the time, Dyer made his way to England in 1961 (aboard a Spanish ship), but unlike those who had preceded him, his intention was not to remain there, but to travel on to Africa, namely the free land at Shashamane that had been promised to West Indians by Emperor Haile Selassie I in 1948. He stayed for about three years in England, before deciding that he had had enough of the 'belly of the beast'. In 1964, he decided to leave 'Babylon' for his spiritual homeland, Ethiopia, with only five pounds, five shillings and five-and-a-half pence in his pocket. It took him around 1 year to reach his destination. He did not literally \\"walk\\", but hitch-hiked through France, Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt and Sudan, before arriving in Addis Ababa in September 1965. At Addis, Dyer was granted an audience with Emperor Haile Selassie I at his Jubilee Palace. There, he says the Emperor personally told him, \\"Be at home in the Jubilee Palace. Make yourself at home, like when it was in Jamaica. Everything will be all right.\\" The following day, he made his way to Shashamane with all the documents needed for residence and a position with the Imperial Highway Authority. He was preceded there by only one other Rastafari elder, brother Gladstone Robinson of the Ethiopian World Federation (EWF), who had flown to Ethiopia in June, 1964.

Antecedents Earlier books of comparable scope include: * Dresser's nine-volume A History of the Birds of Europe, Including all the Species Inhabiting the Western Palearctic Region (1871‚Äì1896) * Witherby et al's five-volume Handbook of British Birds (1938‚Äì1941) Book The Birds of the Western Palearctic is a comprehensive regional avifauna for the Western Palearctic. It consists of 9 volumes, the first published in 1977 and the ninth in 1994. The main editor for the first five volumes was Stanley Cramp. Cramp died in 1987 and the subsequent volumes were edited by Duncan Brooks and Christopher Perrins. BWP's format and breadth influenced the development of regional avifaunas for other parts of the world, notably The Birds of Africa. The titles of the nine volumes were: *Volume I: Ostrich to Ducks *Volume II: Hawks to Bustards *Volume III: Waders to Gulls *Volume IV: Terns to Woodpeckers *Volume V: Tyrant Flycatchers to Thrushes *Volume VI: Warblers *Volume VII: Flycatchers to Shrikes *Volume VIII: Crows to Finches *Volume IX: Buntings and New World Warblers A two-volume Concise Edition was produced in 1998. Both the full and concise editions were published by Oxford University Press (OUP). The boundary used for the region included Iceland, but not Greenland; all of Macaronesia (islands off Portugal and North Africa); North Africa; the northern parts of the Arabian peninsula; Iraq and Kuwait, but not Iran; and Russia west of the Urals. A number of subsequent papers have questioned the appropriateness of this boundary, particularly its southern and southeastern delimitations, among them Martins & Hirschfeld (1994).Martins, R. P. & Hirschfeld, E. (1994) Where are the limits of the Western Palearctic? Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club 114: 207‚Äì08 Martins and Hirschfeld published a more detailed paper in 1998, discussing the boundary in Iran and the Arabian peninsula. They concluded that the mountainous western and northern areas of Iran, and the Arabian peninsula, except for two small enclaves in the south, should be included in the Western Palearctic.Martins, R. P. & Hirschfeld, Erik (1998) Comments on the limits of the Western Palearctic in Iran and the Arabian Peninsula Sandgrouse 20(2): 108‚Äì34 Ullman (2000) disagreed with their conclusions regarding the Arabian enclaves, however, arguing that their depauperate avifauna, when compared to species- rich areas in northeast Africa, justified inclusion of the whole of Arabia in the Western Palearctic.Ullman, Magnus (2000) The limits of the Western Palearctic Sandgrouse 22(1): 74‚Äì75 Roselaar (2006), analysing the breeding distributions of 1037 passerine bird species in the Palearctic region, and northern parts of the Afrotropical and Oriental regions, also proposed a southern boundary somewhat to the south of that used by BWP. He excluded southernmost parts of Arabia, albeit with a slightly different border to that used by Martins & Hirschfeld.Roselaar, Kees (2006) The boundaries of the Palearctic region British Birds 99(12): 602‚Äì18 A journal, BWP Update, was published for a number of years following the completion of BWP. Three electronic versions of BWP have been produced. The first, produced by OUP, suffered from a number of technical problems. The second, known as \\"BWPi\\", was produced by BirdGuides Ltd. This included the full text of the nine volumes, the Concise Edition, all updates from BWP Update, new video and audio, and recent taxonomical changes.

Until World War II, the Deutsche Rundschau was the mouthpiece of the Young Conservatives, and later of the conservative opponents of the Nazis. In 1942, Pechel was imprisoned and the periodical banned. Four years later, Deutsche Rundschau was again published by Pechel.

Records in the United States. The album contains music composed for the 1997 film Metroland, directed by Philip Saville. Composition The instrumental tracks, specifically composed and recorded for the film by Knopfler, effectively help to create the mood and highlight the distinct personalities of the principal characters,Metroland movie review by Harvey Karten with the soundtrack changing the atmosphere as the film flips back and forth between Paris in the early '60s and suburban London in 1977.\\"The film flips back and forth between the Beatlemania-era of the early '60s and their suburban period of the '70s\\" Parisian flavour is augmented by the music of Fran√ßoise Hardy, Django Reinhardt and Quintette du Hot Club de France, with some late-70s classics from The Stranglers, Dire Straits, Hot Chocolate and Elvis Costello that are appropriate for that the period. In the lyrics of \\"Metroland\\", the only song he wrote for the movie, Knopfler says \\"I've danced in the rain and I've been Django\\", so it is entirely appropriate that music by Django Reinhardt should also be on the soundtrack. The song is illustrative of Knopfler's art: it begins with a rising four-note theme on flugelhorn which parallels the hymn Jerusalem, the quintessential anthem of Englishness, but with a vibraphone accompaniment recalling Anglo-French jazz of the '50s. The same theme has been used throughout the movie as the protagonist's signature. The song then moves from a conventional verse backed by acoustic guitars into an electric guitar and organ-driven rock song, sweeping the listener along in its accelerating rush. Knopfler skillfully manipulates the dynamics to take the listener along an emotional journey, mimicking the film's protagonist's journey from detached observer to painfully involved main character. Critical reception The soundtrack generated generally positive reviews. In his review for AllMusic, Chuck Donkers gave the album three out of five stars, noting that Knopfler's music \\"nicely evokes the picture's wistful, nostalgic atmosphere.\\" In his review in the Los Angeles Times, Kevin Thomas noted Knopfler's \\"evocative score\\".Los Angeles Times, Movie Review; Metroland In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin noted that one of the film's \\"strongest assets\\" was Knopfler's \\"fine, expressive score\\". In her review in Boxoffice Magazine, Susan Green wrote, \\"This is a thoroughly satisfying little film with an exquisite Mark Knopfler score.\\" In her review for iF Magazine, Etana Jacobson wrote that \\"Mark Knopfler's quirky Franco-Brit score adds without distracting.\\" In his review for KillerMovies, Scott Renshaw wrote, \\"There's some nice atmosphere to Metroland, particularly from Mark Knopfler's silky score.\\" Track listing All music was written and performed by Mark Knopfler, except where indicated.

Politics often revolve around budgeting and how money for budgets should be raised. History Florida approved its lottery by amending the constitution in 1984. It approved slot machines in Broward and Miami-Dade County in 2004. It has disapproved casinos (outside of sovereign Seminole and Miccosukee tribal areas) three times: 1978, 1986, and 1994. Budget Florida is one of the nine states that do not impose a personal income tax (list of others). The state had imposed a tax on \\"intangible personal property\\" (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, money market funds, etc.), but this tax was abolished after 2006. The state sales tax rate is 6%. Local governments may levy an additional local option sales tax of up to 1.5%. A locale's use tax rate is the same as its sales tax rate, including local options, if any. Use taxes are payable for purchases made out of state and brought into Florida within six months of the purchase date. Documentary stamps are required on deed transfers and mortgages. Other taxes include corporate income, communication services, unemployment, solid waste, insurance premium, pollutants, and various fuel taxes. Florida has a balanced budget provision, requiring the state not to have a budget deficit. The requirement for a balanced budget does not appear as such in the Florida Constitution. Article VII, Section 1(d), Florida Constitution, provides: \\"Provision shall be made by law for raising sufficient revenue to defray the expenses of the state for each fiscal period.\\" Article III, Section 19(a), Florida Constitution, provides for \\"Annual Budgeting.\\" These two provisions, when read together, form the basis for the balanced annual budget requirement. Florida's state budget is funded one-third from General Revenue and two-thirds from hundreds of trust funds.The Conference Report for Senate Bill 2800, the 2011-2012 General Appropriations Act, authorizes the expenditure of $23,182,748,671 from the General Revenue Fund and $46,493,890,488 from Trust Funds (before gubernatorial veotes). The General Revenue portion of Florida's state budget is funded primarily by sales tax, while local governments also have their own respective budgets funded primarily by property taxes. The annual state budget is constructed by the legislature and signed into law by the governor who administers it. The state budget for 2008-9 was $66 billion. In 2008, the state was one of four which had fully funded pension systems for government employees, including teachers. There are five classes of state employees for pension investment: Regular and Special Risk Administrative employees accrue retirement benefits at 1.6‚Äì1.68% per year; Senior Management, 2%; Special Risk employees, such as police and firefighters, 3%; and elected officers, including judges and legislative at 3% to 3.3%. The higher rate for the latter is to encourage early retirement. In 2010 there were 304,000 state retirees and 655,000 active employees. The average teacher's retirement check is $1,868 monthly. The average regular class retiree gets $970 per month. In 2011 to 2012 fiscal year, the state collected over $2.2 billion from the tax on gasoline. In 2011, Medicaid costs were 20% of the budget. These are mandated by the federal government. While the state administers the program, it has no actual control over expenses. From 2000 to 2010, Medicaid costs rose from $8 billion to $18 billion. Education costs were 30% of the budget. The $70 billion budget for 2010‚Äì11 contained the following allocations: *Health and Social Services $30 billion *Education $21.2 billion *Transportation $7.9 billion *Criminal Justice and Corrections $4.5 billion *General government $4 billion *Natural Resources and Environment $3 billion *Reserves $2.28 billion *Courts $459 million In 2011, undocumented immigrants were estimated to cost the Florida government $700 million. This included $548 million for children (excluding American-born children of undocumented aliens). Average student cost is $9,035. There are an estimated 60,750 undocumented immigrant children of school age. There are 5,641 undocumented in Florida prisons at an average cost of $18,980 annually, for a total of $107 million. A 2003 study indicated unpaid hospital costs of $40 million annually. High level state officers use one of two airplanes to get around Florida. Flights take 90 minutes to get from the capital at Tallahassee to Miami. In February 2011, Governor Scott directed the sale of both airplanes., Announcement from the Governor's Office. Employees In 2011, as a result of Governor Rick Scott's executive order, the department required that all workers be verified as U.S. citizens with e-verify. This applied to contracts and funds otherwise under the jurisdiction of local government. Statutes=Real estate= Florida is one of several states where the courts are required to be involved in every step of the foreclosure process. By 2012, it took three years to complete the process. In nonjudicial states, it takes an average of 100 days. As a result of the United States housing bubble, there is a large backlog of housing that is in the foreclosure process but unavailable to the market. This overhang has had a detrimental effect on the housing market. =Gun laws= Florida is considered \\"accommodating\\" to guns, by national standards. There are 56 laws relating to owning, transporting, and using guns. \\"open carries\\" are nearly always illegal. Convicted felons have few rights to gun possession. =Merchandising alcohol in bulk= Florida has a 3-tier system requiring a producer, a wholesaler and a retailer. A franchise law designates who can market what alcoholic beverages where.

The origins of Darby were from a tropical wave which moved off the coast of Africa on June 19. It traversed the Atlantic, and moved across Mexico, where it re-emerged in the Pacific on June 29 and became a tropical depression on July 2, a tropical storm on July 5, and a hurricane on July 6. The storm remained well offshore, although it killed three people. Meteorological history The origins of Darby can be traced back to a tropical wave that emerged off the African coast on June 19. The wave tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean without further development, eventually passing over the Caribbean Sea and tracked over Mexico. The wave reached in the Pacific on June 29, as its organization began to improve. The system was designated Tropical Depression 5-E on July 2 while moving southwest as it continued to organize. On July 4, the depression attained tropical storm status and was named \\"Darby\\". The tropical storm intensified to hurricane status as it brushed by the southern tip of Baja California. Although the storm remained well offshore, it contained a large circulation which produced tropical storm force winds extending up to 300 miles (480 km) away from the center. As Darby passed by, Socorro Island recorded a minimum pressure of 974 hPa. The storm then reached its peak intensity of 968 hPa before beginning a weakening trend due to colder waters. The hurricane, now as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, was moving to the northwest near 20 mph (32 km/h). Darby continued on a northwest track as it moved away from the Baja California on July 6. As the storm moved over cooler waters, deep convection decreased, and Darby was downgraded to a tropical storm on July 7. Darby, now losing tropical characteristics, was downgraded to a tropical depression on July 9. Darby soon dissipated, and moved into the southwest United States producing light rainfall. By July 10, Darby had lost all of its tropical characteristics. As the remnant low pressure meandered across the southwest United States it moved north, and tracked offshore of California, where it persisted as a remnant low and produced shower activity to parts of California. Preparations and Impact Although Darby remained well offshore, the large size of the hurricane's circulation prompted the government of Mexico to issue tropical storm warnings for the southern tip of Baja California. The United States Coast Guard reported two separate boating accidents in Los Angeles, which were directly related to Darby. The first was a boat that experienced engine failure off the California coast. The seven people on board abandoned the boat, and were rescued. The second report was a boat that reported to be taking on water off the coast of California, on July 8. A news source also reported that a tuna fishing boat experienced technical difficulties, but this is not official. The effects from Darby were mostly minor, with three deaths reported by a Mexican newspaper. Four fishermen were reported missing, and onshore, 180 small stores were damaged along the Acapulco city port. Rainfall was mainly light, although some locations picked up 5 inches (125 mm). In California, Darby's remnants produced overcast skies around the Edwards Air Force Base. This caused the landing of the Space Shuttle Columbia to be postponed for a day at the conclusion of STS-50, as well as the landing happening at Kennedy Space Center. Darby produced high humidity, fog, and heavy rain around Los Angeles. A fell in San Diego, setting daily records.

She has produced over fifty works for theater, radio, and television, and is best known for her avant-garde theatrical work from the 1960s. As a founding member of The Open Theater, she developed an actor- training and character-creation technique known as \\"transformation\\". She used this technique to create her 1966 work Viet Rock, which was both the first rock musical and the first play to address the war in Vietnam. Life and work=Early life and education= She was born, as Marguerite Duffy, to Marguerite (n√©e Henry) and businessman Harold Joseph in Seattle, Washington. She first showed an interest in the theatre after attending a play at the age of seven. She wrote, \\"I went and I looked at the stage and I fell madly in love... I knew I wanted to do that, whatever it was.\\" As a child, she wrote, directed, and designed sets for productions staged in the backyard of her family's home, earning her the nicknames \\"Tallulah Blackhead\\" and \\"Sarah Heartburn\\" from her father. He was not pleased by her interest in theatre. After years of participating in school plays, Terry became a member of the Seattle Repertory Playhouse during her senior year in high school. The liberal politics and activist attitudes of the company's directors, Florence and Burton James, had an effect on her view of theatre in society. She has credited their influence, as well as the 1951 closure of the Seattle Repertory Playhouse under pressure from the House Un-American Activities Committee, for her later use of political commentary on stage. Terry went on to earn a scholarship to the Banff School of Fine Arts in Alberta, Canada, where she received certificates in theatre directing, design, and acting. While there, she took psychology and sociology courses at the University of Alberta, and served as technical director for the Edmonton Children's Theater, where she became interested in theatre as a tool for youth education. Midway through her degree program, Terry was forced to return to Seattle when her grandfather became seriously ill. She finished her degree at the University of Washington, where she was awarded a Bachelor of Education degree in 1952. After graduation, she decided to focus on theatre for children and began teaching at Seattle's oldest performance conservatory, the Cornish School of Allied Arts. She also organized her first ensemble, the Cornish Players. At this time, she was writing a series of controversial short plays for youth dealing with issues like sex and politics, and adopted a pseudonym to shield her professional career as a playwright from her more conservative colleagues. She chose the name Megan because it was the Celtic root for Marguerite, and Terry in homage to the nineteenth-century actress Ellen Terry. =New York City, The Open Theater, and Viet Rock= Terry faced backlash for the edginess of her earliest plays, Beach Grass and Go out (1955) and Move the Car (1955). She became increasingly frustrated with creative and political restraint in the Seattle theatre community, and decided to move to New York City. Once there, she continued writing plays dealing with social and political issues, including The Magic Realist (1960), which uses vaudeville techniques to burlesque the inequity of a capitalistic economic power structure on individuals, families, and criminal justice, and Ex-Miss Copper Queen on a Set of Pills, the story of an ex-beauty queen who has begun working as a prostitute to support her drug addiction. Ex-Miss Copper Queen on a Set of Pills opened in 1963 at Edward Albee's Playwrights Unit Workshop. Despite the success of these early productions, Terry had to support herself by working as an actress in television serials. In her free time, she began forming connections in the theatre community, including with fellow playwright Maria Irene Fornes and director Joseph Chaikin. Chaikin was then working with The Living Theatre.Gary Botting, The Theatre of Protest in America (Edmonton: Harden House, 1972) p. 18-20, 24-28. Terry and Chaikin, together with Peter Feldman and Barbara Vann, founded The Open Theater in 1963. The Open Theater was a cooperative that progressed from a closed experimental laboratory to an ensemble. The Open Theatre used the methods of the worldwide collective theater movement and was particularly inspired by the work of the acting teacher, Nola Chilton, and the innovator of theater games, Viola Spolin. Along with her colleagues at The Open Theater, Terry began working on exercises to produce a new kind of collaborative performance based on a \\"radical program of communal engagement in the nonhierarchical and collaborative ensemble\\" that viewed the concept of a \\"play\\" as a continuing process rather than an end product. The resulting productions exhibited sudden changes in mood, time, or character meant to disrupt the audience's sense of immersion and focus on creating a changing emotional state. These techniques resulted in a theatre experience that feminist scholar Rebecca Bell-Metereau described as filled with \\"... earthy language, sexual and political content, musical segments, humor, and vaudeville touches [that] all blend to create lively, dynamic experiences for audiences.\\" Terry's most significant contribution to The Open Theatre's growing repertoire of exercises was \\"transformation\\", in which the actors would improvise overheard dialogue in an effort to \\"transform\\" into characters coping with various situations. These exercises fueled Terry's work as she and the company produced such plays as Keep Tightly Closed in a Cool Dry Place at the Sheridan Square Playhouse and Gloaming, Oh My Darling at the Martinique Theater, both in 1965. The self-guided theatre experiments were cut short by the ensemble's outrage at the United States' decision to go to war with Vietnam. In protest, Terry and her ensemble began work on what would become Viet Rock: As the first rock musical to be written and performed in the United States, and the first play to address America's involvement in Vietnam, Viet Rock was a landmark production for both The Open Theater and Terry as a playwright. The collectively-created piece evolved from workshop improvisations in The Open Theater laboratory, with music by Marianne de Pury. The musical premiered off-off Broadway at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club and had a preview run at the Yale Repertory Theatre before opening off- Broadway at the Martinique Theatre on November 10, 1966. Terry described Viet Rock as a \\"folk war movie\\" about the \\"futilities and irrelevancies\\" of war and the \\"nightmares, fantasies, regrets, terrors, confusions\\" of the Vietnam War. Viet Rock conveys \\"the bombardment of impressions we get from the mass media\\" along with firsthand testimonials about the war. Following the lives of seven soldiers on the front lines, the predominantly female cast juxtaposed intimate scenes, like a boy crawling on his belly and saying, \\"I can't wait till I get there and make a killing on the black market!\\" with actors performing up-tempo rock numbers like \\"Let's go gay with L.B.J.!\\" Similar to the \\"transformation\\" exercises done earlier in workshops, Viet Rock collected the personal stories of veterans and incorporated them into a satirical antiwar testimonial with a rock and roll soundtrack. Richard Schechner described Viet Rock as \\"Elizabethan in scope and tone\\" and compared the technique used by Open Theatre to that of Shakespeare.Richard Schechner, Public Domain, cited in Gary Botting, The Theatre of Protest in America (Edmonton: Harden House, 1972, 28. Some praised the vigor of the play's social protest, while others did not. New York Times critic Walter Kerr called the musical \\"truly distressing\\" and \\"an essentially thoughtless from-the-gut-only noise.\\" Cast member Gerome Ragni borrowed Terry's anti-war theme, improvisational technique, and rock and roll aesthetic to create the musical Hair with fellow actor James Rado. Canadian playwright Gary Botting noted, \\"It is fair to say that Viet Rock was unrivaled in popularity on Off-Off-Broadway until the advent of the rock musical that was directed by the same man, the rock musical that appeared to take the world by storm: Hair.\\"Gary Botting, \\"Megan Terry\\", in The Theatre of Protest in America, p. 28. =Later career= Following the mixed reviews of Viet Rock, which was translated and produced internationally, Terry left New York and The Open Theater. She moved to Minnesota and became the writer-in-residence for Minneapolis' Firehouse Theatre, where she had previously been a Rockefeller Fellow during the development of Keep Tightly Closed in a Cool Dry Place. For several years, she split her time between theatre in Minnesota and commissions for television and public radio, including the program Home: Or Future Soap (1968). She did return to New York City to develop new plays such as Changes (1968) at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, St. Hydro Clemency, and Massachusetts Trust, all directed by Tom O'Horgan. Approaching Simone (1970), Terry's play about the twentieth-century French feminist philosopher Simone Weil, won the 1969/1970 Obie Award for Best Off-Broadway Play. Terry took a stronger interest in women's issues after the production of Approaching Simone and began working to increase the visibility of women in theatre. Along with Fornes, Rosalyn Drexler, Julie Bovasso, Adrienne Kennedy, and Rochelle Owens, Terry founded New York's Women's Theater Council in 1972. Though the council was short-lived, it served as a consciousness-raising organization early in the development of 1970's feminist theatre, and facilitated the authorship of numerous important feminist plays. While in New York, Terry reconnected with Chaikin and The Open Theater to work with fellow playwrights Sam Shepard and Jean-Claude van Itallie on the company's final production, Nightwalk, in 1973. Following this production, Terry again left New York and settled at the Magic Theatre in Omaha, Nebraska, where she remained as playwright-in-residence and literary manager for the remainder of her career. In recognition of her achievements and innovations in the theatre, Terry was elected to lifetime membership in the College of Fellows of the American Theatre in 1994. Her other awards have included the 1983 Dramatists Guild Award, an Academy of Theatre Arts Silver Medal for \\"distinguished contributions to, and service in, the American theatre\\", a Yale and a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Robert Chesley Award, two Rockefeller Foundation grants, and a National Endowment for the Arts literature fellowship. Her papers are kept at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center and at the Omaha Public Library. Many of her plays are available from Alexander Street Press, and some are available at the Rutgers Drama Library.

Members of this genus have showy flowers and long cylindrical leaves. They are epiphytic, occasionally lithophytic or terrestrial, that grow pending and are cespitously, or reptant and ascending, which exist is three isolated areas of South America, in Ecuador, Amazon Forest and Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira mountains, in Brazil, both in shady and sunny places. The genus Scuticaria has been traditionally placed close to Maxillaria but recent research shows they are more closely related to the genus Bifrenaria. Despite their interesting appearance, they are hardly seen in nature and, because their culture is complicated, they are not common in private collections and orchid shows either. No other use for these species is reported besides ornamentation. Because it is a well established genus, formed by a few species that are reasonably easy to separate, there were few publications about them during the last decades.  Distribution and habit  Despite there are few species, Scuticaria inhabit varied climates, disperse in a very uneven way through all countries of South America northern to Bolivia, this excluded, and also in areas of Mata Atl√¢ntica in Brazilian Southeast. No species is common in nature, being just occasionally or even rarely found. The species with wider range is Scuticaria steelei which inhabits open clearings at higher elevations of central Amazon, jungles known as matas de terra firme, up to eight hundred meters of altitude.Miranda, Francisco: Orqu√≠deas da Amaz√¥nia Brasileira, pp. 43. Ed. Express√£o e Cultura, 1996. Although this species occupies wide area, it is not found very often.Freitas Luz, Francisco J.: Orqu√≠deas na Amaz√¥nia, p. 59. Instituto Brasileiro de Cultura, Ed. On Line, 2001. Another species from Amazon, however, in a much more restricted area, just in Guyana, in places where the altitude is lower and the humidity is higher, is Scuticaria hadwenii var. dogsonii.Reichenbach, Heinrich Gustav: Scuticaria dogsonii in Gardeners' Chronicle vol.15: p. 9. London, 1881. Endemic in another area of Amazon, separated but not that far from the habitat of Scuticaria steelei, on southeastern Ecuador, close to the place where the Andes starts, in humid and slightly colder forests, on the mountains up to 1,300 meters of altitude, it is found Scuticaria salesiana.Dressler, Robert Louis: Scuticaria salesiana in Orquideologia vol.3(2): p. 3. Revista de la Sociedad Colombiana de Orquideologia. Medellin, 1968. Under the same conditions but in wider areas, that encompass the southeast of Ecuador and northeast of Peru, lives S. peruviana.Bennett, David E. & Christenson, Eric: Scuticaria peruviana in Orchid Digest 66: pp.64. Berkeley, California, 2002. All species from Amazon are always epiphytic. The remaining species inhabit the area occupied by Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The only species that can be found widespread through several states is Scuticaria hadwenii, in the humid jungles of Serra do Mar from Santa Catarina to Bahia States,Toscano de Brito, Ant√¥nio & Cribb, Phillip: Orqu√≠deas da Chapada Diamantina, pp. 284. Ed. Nova Fronteira, 2005. generally found living epiphytic at middle height over thick tree stems.Miller, David; Richard Warren; Izabel Moura Miller & Helmut Seehawer: Serra dos √ìrg√£os sua hist√≥ria e suas orqu√≠deas, pp. 294. Rio de Janeiro, 2006. Other species occasionally found, although often under living litophytic over rocks and gatherings of fallen leaves in sunny areas of the mountains of S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, is S. strictifolia.Hoehne, Frederico Carlos: Scuticaria in Flora Brasilica, vol. 12-7 p. 342. Instituto de Bot√¢nica de S√£o Paulo, 1953. Scuticaria irwiniana, second and last rupicolous species, exists only on the mountains of Minas Gerais State, found in sunny or shadier places up to two thousand meters of altitude.Guido Pabst & Fritz Dungs: Orchidaceae Brasilienses vol. 2 pp. 187, Brucke-Verlag Kurt Schmersow, Hildesheim, 1977. Two are the species from Esp√≠rito Santo State, S. novaesii and S. kautskyi, both endemic of restricted areas in the dry jungles of the countryside.Barros, F√°bio & Catharino, Eduardo L.M.: Scuticaria novaesii, nova esp√©cie de Orchidaceae do Brasil. Hoehnea vol. 9: pp. 52‚Äì62, S√£o Paulo, 1982. The last Scuticaria species is S. itirapinensis, which has been found only a couple of times in the west-central dry woods of S√£o Paulo State, in an area which has been highly deforested, close to Itirapina. There are no records or reports on this species, both in nature and under culture, during the last twenty-five years. It is speculated about the possibility of its extinction.Records of species displayed during orchid shows. Archives of Coordenadoria das Associa√ß√µes Orquid√≥filas do Brasil - CAOB. Accessed October 2008. Description Scuticaria novaesii, an endemic species from Espirito Santo State in Brazil discovered in 1981. The species subordinated to genus Scuticaria are characterized by being plants of thick cylindrical roots covered by thick vellamen. Their stem is formed by an ordinarily short rhizome, slightly elongated in some species; and by cylindrical almost inconspicuous pseudobulbs of the same diameter or slightly thicker than the unique leaf born on their apexes, because they generally are covered by small dried scaling steaths. The leaves may be erect or pending up to one meter long. The inflorescences grow from the said steaths and almost always bear just one flower, exceptionally two in one species, and always is much longer than the pseudobulbs, bearing showy yellow, orange, purple or greenish flowers, with petals and sepals plain, stained or striped, usually by light brown but also by diverse combinations and shades of the other mentioned colors. Ordinarily the labellum presents contrasting colors, frequently with white areas. The flowers are large, wide open, and last during about two weeks. They have sepals of similar sizes and form an almost invisible chin with the column foot. The petals may be similar to the sepals but smaller, or much smaller and with a much narrower base, occasionally showing different patterns or colors. The labellum articulates with the column, is trilobed, with comparatively small lateral lobes and larger terminal, which has variable shapes with diverse patterns and a callus under to column. The later is √© semi-cylindrical, slightly arching, erect and thick, without any kind of appendix, ending in an apical anther and elongated in a small foot at the base. The flowers bear to pairs of pollinia of different sizes. The caudicle is narrow and the retinacle is small. The fruits resemble the ones of Maxillaria. There are no observation records of pollinators activities but Scuticaria are supposedly pollinated by Euglossini bees. Taxonomic notes Scuticaria steelei. Illustration of original description published by William Jackson Hooker in 1837. In May 1837, the English Botanist William Jackson Hooker received a drawing and a dried sample of a plant, sent by an orchid grower from Liverpool, together with a note explaining that the plant arrived from Demerara, in Guyana, in July of the preceding year. Hooker described this species, classifying it under the genus Maxillaria, calling it M. steelei, in homage to its discoverer. In his description, Hooker affirms that the plant is highly interesting and an excellent addition to the known epiphytic species because it shows cylindrical leaves almost one meter long, different from anything ever found.Hooker, William Jackson: Scuticaria in The Botanical magazine 64: t. 3573. Ed. William Curtis, London, 1837. Published on Internet. A few months later, John Lindley published again the species Hooker described, however, adding more information. Two years earlier, several plants had been sent from Demerara and Lindey reports that he had previously informally classified this species as Maxillaria flabellifera which, under this name, could be found in several orchid collection in England. Because he had not yet described this species, he accepts the priority of the name chosen by Hooker. Lindley adds, however, that he had some doubts about the classification, of a species so different from any other known so far, under the genus Maxillaria.Lindley, John: Scuticaria steelei in Edward's Botanical Register Vol.2, t.1986. James Ridgway & Sons Ed. London, 1837. Published on Internet. In 1843, Lindley published a revision of a group of orchids classified as tribus Maxillaridae, then subordinated to Vandeae, a subfamily of Orchidaceae at the time. In this revision, he indicates that much work is needed till the limits between each genus within this tribus can be established and states his doubts regarding some of the new genera he was proposing, despite being very sure of other ones. Lindley suggested the division of Maxillaridae in twenty- five genera, being Scuticaria one of the genera he considered well established. When describing this new genus, Lindley based on morphologic characteristics of Maxillaria steelei Hook., selected as the Type species of Scuticaria with the name Scuticaria steelei.Lindley, John: Scuticaria in Edward's Botanical Register Vol. 29 (miscelanea), p. 14. James Ridgway & Sons Ed. London, 1843. Published on Internet. This name comes from Latin scutica, flagellum, in reference to the long cylindrical leaves that the species of this genus show, similar to the leather whips used to punish. Strangely, because he published the genus Scuticaria many years earlier, in 1851, Lindley described another species now considered part of this genus, classifying it under Bifrenaria. It is speculated that possibly because it was found in Brazil on the same area in the southeast where most of Bifrenaria were common, or because he believed that two species separated by so long distance belonged to the same genus. It was Scuticaria hadwenii.Lindley, John: Bifrenaria hadwenii in Paxton's Flower Garden. John Paxton Ed., London, 1851. Few months later, Jules √âmile Planchon corrected Lindley moving it to the genus where it is subordinated today.Planchon, Jules √âmile: Scuticaria hadwenii in Flore des Serres et des Jardins de l'Europe vol.7: p. 239. Ghent, 1852. In 1851, the only two common Scuticaria species were described and the genus well established, therefore no later confusion about the classification of any species subordinated to this genus ever happened.R. Govaerts, M.A. Campacci (Brazil, 2005), D. Holland Baptista (Brazil, 2005), P.Cribb (K, 2003), Alex George (K, 2003), K.Kreuz (2004, Europe), J.Wood (K, 2003, Europe) (Novembro 2008). World Checklist of Orchidaceae. The Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Published on Internet. (Accessed March 2009). Almost one century passed before any important new information were published. In 1881 Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach described Scuticaria dogsonii, originated from Guyana, but in 1892, Berthold Stein, considering that the only difference it shows from Scuticaria hadwenii is the fact it bears two flowers each inflorescence, reduced it to a variety of the later.Stein, Berthold: Scuticaria hadwenii var. dogsonii in Orchideenbuch, 1892. In 1903, C√©lestin Alfred Cogniaux, when revising all orchids species from Brazil, cites two other varieties of Scuticaria hadwenii which, because just show color differences, can not be accepted as such today.Cogniaux, C√©lestin Alfred: Scuticaria in Flora Brasiliensis Vol.3 Part.6: pp. 78‚Äì81. K.F.P. von Martius Ed., 1903. Published on Internet. Finally, in 1947, Frederico Carlos Hoehne described a new species, Scuticaria strictifolia, yet similar to Scuticaria hadwenii, although showing some slight differences on the labellum structure, besides their normally lithophytic habit and erect leaves.Hoehne, Frederico Carlos: Scuticaria strictifolia in Arquivos de Bot√¢nica do Estado de Sao Paulo, n.s, f.n.2, p. 88. Instituto de Bot√¢nica de S√£o Paulo, 1947. Scuticaria irwiniana, is one of the two Scuticaria species with erect leaves and the one with the shortest leaves among all species. If few species were known so far, after 1968 the number of described species triplicated. All species described during the later years are uncommon and inhabit restricted areas, some are very rare or even supposedly extinct. In 1968 Robert Louis Dressler described Scuticaria salesiana, discovered in Ecuador in an area far apart from the other Scuticaria range. In 1972, Guido Pabst described Scuticaria kautskyi, found in Esp√≠rito Santo State,Pabst, Guido F.J.: Scuticaria kautskyi in Bradea 1: pp.169 Boletim do Herbarium Bradeanum. Rio de Janeiro, 1972. in southeast Brazil and, during the following year, published two species at once, S. itirapinensis and S. irwiniana.Pabst, Guido F.J.: Scuticaria irwiniana and Scuticaria itirapinensis in Bradea 1: pp. 336-7 Boletim do Herbarium Bradeanum. Rio de Janeiro, 1973. In 1982, other species was discovered in Esp√≠rito Santo, Scuticaria novaesii. The last described species was S. peruviana, found in Peru in 2002, in the same region of S. salesiana, to which it is related. Despite Lindley indicated the possibility of Scuticaria being closely related to Bifrenaria when he initially described S. hadwenii under this genus, all later taxonomists always included Scuticaria on the same group Maxillaria were.Dressler, Robert Louis: Phylogeny and classification of the orchid family. Cambridge University Press, 1993. It was just in 2000 that the first proofs of Scuticaria closer proximity to Bifrenaria started being published.Whitten, W. Mark; Williams, Norris H. & Chase, Mark W.: Subtribal and generic relationships of Maxillarieae (Orchidaceae) with emphasis on Stanhopeinae: combined molecular evidence. American Journal of Botany. 2000;87: pp. 1842‚Äì1856, 2000. published on Internet. In 2002, a detailed research about the phylogeny of Bifrenaria performed molecular analyses on two Scuticaria species while choosing them as out groups. This study claims that the phylogenethic internal relationships among Scuticaria species so far remain unknown.Koehler, Samantha: Estudo taxon√¥mico e an√°lise clad√≠stica do complexo Bifrenaria Lindl. (Maxillarieae, Orchidaceae). Universidade Estadual de Campinas. Instituto de Biologia, December 2001. published on Internet. It is known that other orchid genera bearing cylindrical leaves devolved this sort of leaves as a defense to climate changes their habitats were going through along the eras. Terete leaves are capable of much more water and nutrients and to face longer drought periods than species bearing thin leaves, on the other hand, almost all epiphytic species presenting the former type of leaves show more or less atrophied pseudobulbs since the leaves carry on its accumulating role. It is a supposition that Scuticaria species should have once inhabited much drier through their evolution. Because most of the species are found in shadier and more humid species now, this may one of the reasons why their culture uses to be complicated, possibly because the delicate balance they reached in nature is broken. For the same reason, it is supposed their frequency in nature is only occasional or rare. Species Scuticaria hadwenii is the most variable among Scuticaria species and widespread through a large area in Southeast of Brazil. Because of its highly particular morphologic characteristics which allow immediate identification, its restricted species distribution, and its comparatively low variability, since the genus Scuticaria was established by Lindley, only ten species were formally described and there has never been much confusion concerning the distinguishing of any of the species. Out of these ten, nine are generally accepted, the tenth being normally accepted not as a species but as a variety. For identification purposes, the species can be split as follows: Only two species present erect leaves and are the only ones frequently found as lithophytes, Scuticaria irwiniana, easily known recognized because of its flowers without any stains on the internally entirely purple and externally whitish sepals and petals, with white labellum, striped of purple. This species generally can be identified even without flowers because of its reptant, slightly ascendant growth, and longer rhizome than any other species. Scuticaria strictifolia also has erect leaves but occasionally, when cultivated under insufficient light, their leaves can be narrower and slightly bent making the distracted observer find hard to differentiate it from S. hadwenii. The Brazilian taxonomist Guido Pabst considered this species a variety of the later. Scuticaria strictifolia, which is very close to Scuticaria hadwenii but has erect leaves; different colors and diverse callus structure on the labellum. All species remaining are epiphytic with pendant habit. Scuticaria hadwenii, due to its several more or less isolated groups of populations along Serra do Mar, mostly on the west side of this chain of mountains, spreading throughout the interior highland in some states of Brazil, is the Scuticaria species that presents most variable colors. It can be separated from S. strictifolia because shows leaves always pending, flowers of more vivid colors and by the interior of the labellum, which ordinarily is more pubescent. There is a variety denominated dogsonii, native from Guyana, which is more floriferous. The two other species from Esp√≠rito Santo State are highly different from each other. Scuticaria kautskyi usually has more or less uniform orange color on its sepals and petals, with their bases slightly lighter and dotted of greenish-yellow. Their labellum is white showing few colored drawings and narrow terminal lobe, slightly deflected. The other species from this state, Scuticaria novaesii presents flowers with green- yellow segments, intensely spotted with dark brown and wide and flat labellum terminal lobe, with clearly marked by radial multicolored lines. Scuticaria itirapinensis, the last species of Brazilian southeast, is the one that closely resembles Amazonian Scuticaria steelei, although it can be easily separated because of its strong yellow flowers and much shorter leaves, besides slight differences on the proportions of floral structures. A Scuticaria steelei presents entirely pale yellow flowers, completely covered by spaced small darker stains, However it is not even necessary to observe the flowers to identify it as their leaves are about one meter long, and there are references of plants measuring almost one and a half meter. The last two Scuticariaare isolated in forests of Peru and Ecuador and are similar to each other. They are different from all other because of the proportions of floral segments. The labellum is much larger when compared to their sepals and petals than it is on other species. Moreover, their petals are striped of brown and much smaller than the sepals, showing a greater difference than it is found on the other species. From each other, they can be separated mostly by the shape of the labellum. Scuticaria salesiana presents more rounded intermediate lobe, and Scuticaria peruviana has it more rectangular, with the apex truncated, almost in a straight line. In 2008, a new species of Scuticaria, S. bahiensis has been described from Bahia state in Brazil but so far it remains mostly unknown.K.L.Davies & Stpiczynska. (2008). Scuticaria bahiensis in Orchid Review 116: 344. Culture Scuticaria itirapinensis This showy species has been found just a couple of times in nature and has not been found or seen anywhere during the last decades. In his book Flora Brasilica, the Brazilian Botanist Frederico Hoehne strongly recommended the culture of Scuticaria species because of their beautiful flowers and interesting vegetation, however, soon later he admits that all species then cultivated by S√£o Paulo Botanic Garden had died after two or three years. Indeed, he claims that to successfully grow them a special environment needs to be created. These plants are not easy to maintain under culture. Only recently, with the help of modern technology, timers and foggers that keep the humidity constant, the growers have been finally capable of keeping them out of their natural environment for several years. There are four different sorts of culture according to the origin of each species. S. steelei and S. hadwenii var. dogsonii are the species that need higher temperature and humidity. The two rupicolous species, S. irwiniana and S. strictifolia are the ones which need more light and constant ventilation besides drier culture conditions. S. peruviana and S. salesiana take slightly cooler temperatures than the other species although still need humidity mostly during the early morning hours. The other species need less light than the mentioned ones. All species should be preferably mounted on plaques of vegetable fibers because of their pending habit, the rupicolous species may alternatively potted in well-drained pots. Scuticaria are delicate plants that like to remain untouched during several years because their roots easily resent on replants.

It is starred and produced by Alain Delon. In France and Germany it runs less than the Italian cut. It is known and available on DVD in France as Le Professeur (The Professor) and in Germany as Oktober in Rimini (October in Rimini). It tells the story of a gifted but restless young man who cannot live up to the high traditions of his family and survives in obscurity, taking casual teaching jobs and living in a loveless partnership with a depressed woman. His aimless existence reaches a crisis point when he falls for one of his pupils, a beautiful but badly damaged girl. Plot While a teacher is on sick leave, despite his dishevelled appearance and an employment history with unexplained gaps, Daniele is hired to take a class in Rimini. To get to know his pupils, he asks them to write a free essay or, if they prefer, one on the writer Manzoni. To his surprise, only one chooses the latter, the quiet and very attractive Vanina, who increasingly absorbs his attention. He talks to her when he can and gives her the book Vanina Vanini by Stendhal. In his free time, he leaves his partner Monica to herself (they sleep apart) while he gets to know a group of local men who enjoy drinking, gambling, recreational drugs, fast cars and easy women. Prominent among them are a crooked businessman Gerardo, who drives an ostentatious Lamborghini and is the lover of Vanina, and Spider, a gay pharmacist who is secretly a devout Catholic and lover of poetry. Daniele takes the withdrawn Vanina to see a wall painting by Piero della Francesca and on the way back they share a kiss. When Spider's birthday comes round, after going to a disco where Vanina sulks and will not dance, the group end up at Gerardo's luxurious house. In revenge he shows a home movie, which starts innocently with Vanina on holiday but turns into a sex tape. She switches off the electricity and Gerardo asks everybody to leave. Next day Vanina does not turn up at school and Daniele goes to the house of her mother, who with threats warns him to stay away from her daughter. Going home, he faces trouble from Monica, who tolerates his evenings out with other men but not his growing obsession over his pupil. In addition, Spider has fallen in love with him and has found a book of poems he wrote called The First Night of Stillness. When Spider asks the significance of the title, Daniele says it is taken from Goethe: after you die, you have your first night without dreams. Another friend Marcello, a real estate agent with empty properties to sell, takes Daniele to a solitary house by the sea he has allowed Vanina to hide in. After Daniele and Vanina have made love, they are woken by a furious Gerardo who has been looking for his runaway lover. He tells Daniele that Vanina was a child prostitute, managed by her mother, who has been enjoyed by most men in town and some women too. Daniele then gets the better of him in a fight and he leaves. Putting Vanina on a train to stay with her sister, Daniele goes home to tell Monica he is leaving her, to which she replies that she will kill herself. When he stops at a bar to ring Monica, the phone is not answered and as he leaves he is professionally beaten up by the lover of Vanina's mother. Rescued by Marcello, he is looked after by Spider. Injured and upset, he drives fast and erratically through the fog to Monica's. After getting no response to knocking on Monica's door, he drives to a bar to phone for help in getting into Monica's flat and says that he will be there soon. He then drives onto a main road without looking and is hit by a truck and killed. The only character to go to his funeral in his family's grand villa is Spider.

History The tavern in 2009 Francis Brinley, an English immigrant, constructed the original building on the site in 1652. In 1673, he sold the lot to William Mayes who enlarged the building to become a tavern. The building was also used for large meetings, including use as a Rhode Island General Assembly meeting place, a court house, and a city hall. William Mayes obtained a tavern license in 1687, and his son William Mayes, Jr. operated it through the early eighteenth century. The operation was named \\"The White Horse Tavern\\" in 1730 by owner Jonathan Nichols. Tories and British troops were quartered there during the British occupation of Newport in the American Revolution, around the time of the Battle of Rhode Island. Newport's Van Bueren family donated money to the private Preservation Society of Newport to restore the building in 1952, after years of neglect as a boarding house. After the restoration, the building was sold and once again operated as a private tavern and restaurant, and it remains a popular drinking and dining location today.http://www.whitehorsetavern.com/history.htm See also * List of the oldest restaurants in the United States * Oldest buildings in America * National Register of Historic Places listings in Newport County, Rhode Island * List of the oldest buildings in Rhode Island * List of oldest companies * List of oldest companies in the United States References Category:Government of Rhode Island Rhode Island Category:Landmarks in Rhode Island Category:Buildings and structures in Newport, Rhode Island Category:Taverns in Rhode Island Category:Taverns in the American Revolution Category:Residential buildings in Rhode Island Category:Restaurants in Rhode Island Category:Government buildings in Rhode Island Category:Drinking establishments on the National Register of Historic Places in Rhode Island Category:National Register of Historic Places in Newport, Rhode Island Category:Historic district contributing properties in Rhode Island ","title":"White Horse Tavern (Newport, Rhode Island)"},{"id":"15102663","text":"St Philip's Hospital is a former 100-bedded capacity hospital located in Santa Venera, Malta.

Etymology Trigonidium derives from the Greek \\"trigonon\\", meaning \\"triangle\\", in reference to the triangular shape of the flowers. Description The epiphytes and lithophytes of the genus have long or short rhizomes. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical or ovoid with overlapping sheathes at their base and one or two leaves at their apex. The inflorescences of the genus are basal, erect, and single flowered, with the flower usually as long or longer than the leaves. The flowers are tubular at the base with sepals spreading. The sepals are larger than the petals and the petals are larger than the lip. The lip is trilobed and not spurred. The flowers have shiny pads and eyespots that lure male bees to perform pseudocopulation with the blossoms. Cultivation Plants of the genus grow well in pots with standard epiphyte mix, in intermediate conditions with light shade and high humidity. Plants should be kept dry but not so dry that pseudobulbs shrivel.

He played at the tackle position on the University of Michigan's undefeated 1947 and 1948 football teams. He signed to play with the Baltimore Colts, but a knee injury prevented him from playing in the NFL. He was an assistant football coach at Eastern Michigan University (1952‚Äì1954) and a head coach at Franklin College (1955‚Äì1956) and Eastern Illinois University (1957‚Äì1964). From 1964 until his retirement in 1993, Kohl worked as a professional football scout. He was considered the top scout in the BLESTO NFL scouting combine in the 1960s and 1970s and served as the head scout for the Minnesota Vikings for two decades. Early years Kohl was born in Shaker Heights, Ohio and grew up in University Heights. He attended high school in Cleveland Heights and prep school at the Kentucky Military Institute. He briefly enrolled at both the University of Kentucky and Western Teachers College. He played for the Kentucky Wildcats football team in 1942. (\\"Kentucky used two freshman ... Coach Ab Kirwan calling up Ralph Kohl a yearling tackle from Cleveland, O. ...\\") He enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps and served in Italy and Africa during World War II. University of Michigan After being released from the military, Kohl enrolled at the University of Michigan and played at the right tackle position for head coach Fritz Crisler on the undefeated 1947 Michigan Wolverines football team that has been selected b the ESPN Big Ten College Football Encyclopedia as the best team in the history of Michigan football. He also played right tackle for Bennie Oosterbaan's undefeated 1948 Michigan Wolverines football team. Kohl played on Crisler's offensive squad in 1947, and he was switched to a defensive tackle in 1948.(interview with Kohl) His \\"alert recovery of a fumble\\" in the third quarter of the 1948 Ohio State game was credited with helping Michigan \\"cling to a precarious seven to three lead.\\" The 1949 Michiganensian (the University of Michigan yearbook) said, \\"Ralph Kohl, gigantic tackle, was the power man in the offensive line. Transferring from the defensive spot which he held down in 1947, the big Cleveland boy was a vital cog in the front line of the Michigan attack.\\"1948 Michiganensian During Kohl's two years playing for the Wolverines, the team won 19 games and lost none, outscoring opponents by a combined score of 646 to 97 and won an undisputed national championship in 1948 and a contested national championship in 1947. Kohl was selected to participate in two of the post-season college all-star games, both the East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game played on New Year's Day 1949, and the 1949 Chicago Tribune Charities, Inc. All-Star Game played in the summer of 1949. Football coach In May 1949, after graduating from Michigan, Kohl signed with the Baltimore Colts, but a knee injury prevented him from playing in the NFL. Kohl began a career as the football coach at Belding, Michigan High School in 1950.. He then was the line coach for the Joliet Steelemen in the Greater Chicago League. From 1952 to 1954, he served as an assistant coach, with responsibility for the linemen, at Eastern Michigan University. In April 1955, he became the head football coach at Franklin College in Franklin, Indiana.(\\"Ralph Kohl, line coach at Michigan State Normal College, has been signed as head football coach at Franklin College, it was announced today by Dean J. Geoffrey Moore.\\") After two years as the head coach of the Franklin Grizzlies, Kohl was hired by Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois, as its head football coach in June 1957. Kohl served as the head football coach for the Eastern Illinois Panthers from 1957 through 1964, compiling a record of 17‚Äì49‚Äì2.Eastern Illinois Coaching Records Football scout After the 1964 season, Kohl resigned his position as the head coach at Eastern Illinois to accept a job a scout for BLESTO, an NFL scouting combine that was an acronym for the Bears, Lions, Eagles and Steelers Talent Organization. The four teams, later joined by the Minnesota Vikings, Miami Dolphins and Dallas Cowboys, combined their scouting resources under the BLESTO banner. Kohl began as a scout for talent at Big Eight and then Big Ten universities. He was considered BLESTO's best scout and became the combine's Eastern supervisor scout in 1968. In the 1970s, Kohl became the head scout for the Vikings, a position he held for two decades until his retirement in 1993. In 1988, the Minneapolis Star Tribune praised Kohl for his talent as a scout: \\"Ralph Kohl, the Vikings' chief scout, is a respected judge of football flesh. He has been rating players for nearly a quarter of a century and once was the top scout for the Blesto combine. Clearly the man he knows his stuff ...\\" In September 1984, Kohl was one of the first scouts to tout Randall Cunningham, then a little-known quarterback at UNLV. In 1981, Kohl recommended that the Vikings draft Villanova defensive lineman Howie Long. Vikings general manager Mike Lynn recalled his response: \\"Howie Long? We said, 'What are you talking about, Ralph? You've got to be out of your mind,'\\" Long was drafted in the second round by the Oakland Raiders and went on to a career that resulted in his being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Lynn later noted, \\"Ninety to 95 percent of the players Ralph says will make the team will make it. It's an amazing statistic.\\" Kohl developed a reputation as one of the best scouts in the NFL and said that the key to success was forming one's own opinions based on the facts and not buying into the conventional wisdom about players. He noted, \\"It's a matter of a guy being stereotyped. Scouts are old coaches, and coaches are parrots. They say the same thing, and even if it's a lie, if it's told often enough, people believe it.\\" He was also dubious about the modern scouts' reliance on \\"all the measuring\\" of height, weight, speed, strength and agility. In Kohl's view, it was about something more basic, \\"The bottom line is, can the guy play football?\\" Family and later years Kohl and his wife, Dorothy Kohl, had a daughter, Jackie, who was born in approximately 1954. He moved with his wife and daughter to Holland, Michigan in 1969. They later moved to nearby Saugatuck, Michigan, and for 23 years from the 1970s until 1996, Kohl and his wife spent the winters at their second home in Pompano Beach, Florida. Kohl died in June 1997 at Holland County Hospital in Saugatuck, Michigan. Kohl and his wife had been married for 45 years at the time of his death.

At its founding it was recognized by the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Despite some remarkable achievements, by the late nineteenth century Korea found itself wholly unable to resist, or even properly comprehend the encroachments of foreign powers. Japan's victory in the First Sino-Japanese War had both removed the Chinese from the peninsula and exacted an acknowledgment of Korean independence, but the country's independence was fragile, with Japan, Russia, and other powers vying for influence. The group was founded by reform-minded citizens, and worked to strengthen Korean independence, promote national self-strengthening, create a public sphere, and advocate democratic participation in government decisions. The club published a newspaper, Tongnip Sinmun (The Independent), and worked to create symbols of Korean independence. It supported public education, journalism, and language reform. Its political program for reforming the government into a constitutional monarchy brought it into conflict with the Emperor and conservatives in the court, and the club was ordered to disband in December 1898.  Overview  It did not go unnoticed in Korea that Emperor Kojong and his high officials were prepared to rely on the support and benevolence of foreign powers to preserve the territorial integrity of Korea. If the government could not act in the face of such an external threat however, the people could, and did. The public at large reacted by attacking the government's ineffective policies and fought dauntlessly to maintain their nation's independence and freedom. The fight was carried out largely through the efforts of a newly emerging class of intellectuals that had been exposed to the liberal ideas of Western culture. At its roots, the Enlightenment thought of these new reformers represented a continuation of the old school traditions of Northern Learning within the Sirhak movement. It held to the same goals of achieving national prosperity and military strength through the introduction of new technology and the development of modern commerce and industry. The difference this time was the new reformers were reaching to the West for modernization, not to China. The enlightenment thinkers pushed the notion that their goals could be best achieved by throwing open Korea's ports and establishing commercial relations with the West. Topping the list of Korea's concerns was the acquisition of Western weapons technology to improve its ability to defend itself. In addition, Korea was very interested in acquiring new agricultural technology to help enrich the country. Gradually however, this concern gave way to a more radical stream of enlightenment thought that placed a high priority on political and institutional change in the government. The dynastic weakness and foreign aggression in both China and Korea between 1896 and 1898 led to a number of internal reform movements. In the search for new answers, Korea certainly had its own visionaries, men like Yu Kil-chun, who studied in both Japan and the United States during the 1880s and had visited Europe. Edward S. Morse, Director of the Peabody Museum in Boston, Massachusetts, had made three trips to Japan in the 1870s and 1880s and dedicated himself to bringing Asian art and culture to the United States. In 1883, Morse was asked to help organized the first official Korean delegation to America. Yu Kil-chun, a junior member of that delegation, became friends with Morse and remained in the United States to continue his education. After returning to Korea, Yu wrote the first Korean book on the West, Observations on a Journey to the West. He wrote about the geography, history, politics, economy, society, and learning of numerous Western nations. He not only described what he saw, but measured Korea against the West and advocated that Korea follow the model of Western civilization in its drive for modernization. Yu Kil-chun As a progressive advocate of internationalism, Yu Kil-chun believed the process of enlightenment could take only two directions in Korea. One way would slavishly imitate the methods of others without first understanding the context in which those methods had developed. The second way, the way Yu hoped would be followed, involved first perceiving the ways of the West and then adapting them to the realities of Korea, much like the path taken by Japan. Yu proceeded to develop a plan for political and economic reform in Korea based on this approach. His ultimate objective was to establish a constitutional democracy and create a free enterprise capitalist economy. The idea of capitalism was not unheard of in Korea at the time. In 1883, a now unknown author published an article that described the formation of a corporation. The article addressed the need to form Western style business organizations and went on to describe the structure and operation of the modern corporation. Until this transition could be accomplished however, Yu felt the constitutional monarchy of Emperor Kojong was best suited for his country. Yi Hang-no At the other end of the reform spectrum, the Reject Heterodoxy movement ran directly counter to the enlightened thought of men like Yu Kil- chun. Yi Hang-no was perhaps the foremost proponent of this position, one conceptually based on the Neo-Confucianism of Chu Hsi. Yi Hang-no and his followers held that Neo-Confucianism was the only valid belief system and that any civilization believing any other philosophy must be kept out of Korea at all costs. He and his followers took the extreme Confucianist position that called for continued armed resistance against foreign intrusions, asserting all the while that to advocate peaceful relations would be tantamount to abandoning the moral foundations of Korean civilization. Yi Hang-no believed his position so strongly that in 1866, following the French attacks on Kanghwa Island, he resigned his position as Royal Secretary to the King. From then on, Yi attempted not only to rouse his countrymen to battle against foreign aggression, but insisted that internal transformation of society was also needed. Only after the government acted on the advice of its policy critics, improved the state of military readiness and appointed men of moral character to government posts, would a strong stance against foreign aggression be possible. Yi Hang-no went so far as to call for the formation of local guerrilla militias, so called \\"righteous armies,\\" to fight alongside the government in its battle against the foreign enemy. He raised a great cry in opposition to Western economic aggression against Korea. He believed that trade with the West would only impoverish Korea by taking the goods it needed for its own development. He even called for a boycott of Western goods, thinking that if Koreans did not use them, trade with the West would become unnecessary. Seo Jae-pil Seo Jae-pil, a sincere patriot and an advocate of modernization and political democracy, emerged as one of the leading figures behind the move toward national independence and governmental reforms in Korea. Seo Jae-pil, one of the leaders of the attempted coup d'√©tat of 1884, fled to Japan when it failed. From there, he traveled to the United States, where he married an American woman, acquired United States citizenship, and earned a medical degree from the University of Washington. Known in America as Doctor Philip Jaisohn, Seo Jae-pil returned to Korea in early 1896 and soon afterward was offered a position as consultant to the Privy Council. Preferring to have greater freedom of action, he refused the position, but agreed to serve as an adviser to the throne, a position which broadened his contacts among prominent government leaders. Determined to help secure Korean independence and spread the desire for democracy and reform among the population by whatever means he could, Seo Jae-pil chose the press as his medium. With government financing, he introduced modern journalism to Korea on April 7, 1896, with the publication of Korea's first independent, modern bilingual newspaper, the Dongnip Sinmun (The Independent). To attract as wide a readership as possible, the first three pages were printed in pure Hangul and the last page was printed in English. The four-page newspaper started with a press run of just 300 copies three days a week, but quickly became a daily paper that covered the views of the new intelligentsia and their liberal Western ideas. The Independent served as an effective vehicle to spread the messages of reform and patriotic nationalism, informing the public and maintaining independence from foreign encroachment. It argued impartially both for and against government policies, calling for an all-out effort to strengthen Korean autonomy and promote the public good. The Independent awakened Koreans to the urgent needs of the day: eliminating corruption, promoting civil rights, expanding education and solidifying national sovereignty. Seo Jae-pil took every opportunity to address the Korean people on current topics and did his utmost to introduce readers to modern science and Western ideology. He demanded the Korean government give top priority to promoting civil rights and that it safeguard national sovereignty by resisting the growth of foreign influence. He worked tirelessly to educate the public on the need for modernization by calling for wide circulation of both domestic and foreign newspapers, currency for domestic transactions, the exploitation of mining resources and commerce promoting national wealth, road construction, women's education, the promotion of Hangul for mass education and the creation of an elected congress. Foreign Perspective The English author Isabella Bird Bishop, an ardent traveler and the first female member of the Royal Geographical Society, wrote a number of books on her travels, including Korea and Her Neighbors. In 1898, she wrote > Only those who have formed some idea of the besotted ignorance of the Korean > concerning current events in his own country, and of the credulity which > makes him the victim of every rumour set afloat in the capital, can > appreciate the significance of this step and its probable effect in > enlightening the people, and in creating a public opinion which shall sit in > judgement on regal and official misdeeds. It is already fulfilling an > important function in unearthing abuses and dragging them into daylight, and > is creating a desire for rational education and reasonable reform, and is > becoming something of a terror to evil-doers. ... The sight of newsboys > passing through the streets with bundles of a newspaper in onmun [hangul] > under their arms, and of men reading them in their shops, is among the > novelties of 1897. Forming the Independence Club A number of political organizations came into being in Korea during the 1890s, each formed with the hope of securing the nation's independence and the rights of the people. Each group tackled the problem of national independence from a different direction. The most energetic of these organizations was also the first to form. On July 2, 1896, Seo Jae-pil and Yi Sang-jae, Yun Chi-ho formally inaugurated the Independence Club (Doklip-hyuphoe). Minister of War An Kyong-su served as the club's first president and Foreign Minister Yi Wan-yong served as its chairman. The principal goals of the club were to instill a desire for independence, to instill a belief in democratic principles in the hearts of Koreans, to awaken the population to the need for self-realization and modernization, and to emphasize the strengthening of their own power. The Independence Club drew its early membership of about 30 men from other like-minded groups, from incumbent politicians and former government officials. Members came from the Chongdong Club, founded by Yun Chi-ho and Yi Sang-jae, both active in Korea's diplomatic affairs, and from the Konyang Club (a name that symbolized the end of Korea's suzerain relationship with China), founded by Yu Kil-chun and other leaders of the reforms of 1894. As criticism of the government and its policies mounted, a number of the higher level officials associated with the Independence Club thought it wise to resign their positions for political reasons. In their place came representatives of the new intelligentsia, men influenced by Western culture whose ideology developed from the Confucian reformist idea of \\"Eastern ways, Western machines.\\" One of the most noteworthy members of the Independence Club was a young man named Ahn Chang-ho. He grew into one of Korea's most illustrious national leaders, a man who devoted his entire life to the Korean independence movement. Ahn Chang-ho was recognized as a great political and educational thinker who developed a vision and philosophy for national salvation, social reform and the philosophy of character innovation. The selection of officers and the conduct of club business was handled democratically. Matters of importance were decided by a simple majority of the members present. In time, the Independence Club expanded its network of members into the countryside. After sufficient branches had been established in provincial towns, one group in each province became the liaison group that maintained regular contact with the club's headquarters in Seoul. Political Action As it became more of a citizen's assembly, the Independence Club moved beyond symbolic activities and began to initiate direct social and political action programs. This modernization movement began with the goals of awakening the Korean people, opposing the country's tributary attitude towards Qing China, promoting the cause of national self-rule, and reforming government administration. The first priority was to launch a campaign of public education and the most effective tool toward this end was The Independent, the club's newspaper. One of the first projects undertaken by the paper was an attempt to establish some tangible symbol of Korean independence. Seo Jae-pil proposed to tear down the Yeongeunmun (\\"Gate of Welcoming Grace\\") a tile-roofed gate with stone pillars and a red wooden top. Built in 1539, this was the special gate where Chinese envoys had been escorted and received in the past. In its place, a new gate, the Dongnimmun (\\"Independence Gate\\") would be erected as a symbol of Korean independence and the end of suzerainty to a foreign power. Second, he proposed that the Mohwagwan, the guest quarters where Chinese embassies had been entertained, be renovated and that an Independence Hall and Independence Park be created there. In the context of the international crisis facing Korea at the time, the proposals evoked a warm response from the people. For the first time, the word \\"freedom\\" came in vogue in Korea. In August 1896, within days after the proposals, the \\"Independence Association\\" was founded. The citizens responded with not only support, but sizable contributions as well. Even the royal family and many of the government's highest officials contributed to the Independence Club projects. Crown Prince Yi-Chak made a financial contribution to the group as a token of his cooperation. Within three months, membership in the association swelled to nearly ten thousand. With its success thus assured, the groundbreaking and cornerstone laying ceremony was carried out in November. The Independence Gate, modeled after the French Arc de Triomphe in Paris, was built by Chinese workers under the watchful eyes of architectural engineer Sim Ui-seok. The new gate, which used 1850 granite blocks, was completed and dedicated in 1898. The words Tongnipmun (Independence Gate) were inscribed at the top of the gate ‚Äì Korean characters on the south side and Chinese characters on the north side. Sculptors carved the Korean flag into the granite face on each side of the gate, the only place where the Korean flag could be legitimately displayed during the Japanese occupation. Retaining a bit of the past, the two large pillars on the front side of the Independence Gate were taken from the old Yongunmun Gate. The activities of the Independence Club were specifically directed toward three primary goals: national independence, wider citizen participation in the political process, and national self-strengthening. First, it directed its energy toward safeguarding Korea's independence in the face of external pressures by urging that Korea adopt a foreign policy based on independence and neutrality, one that would show no favor to any foreign power seeking to advance its parochial interests in the peninsula. Second, the Independence Club initiated a popular rights movement in Korea to create wider participation in the political process. The ideological basis of this movement demanded the full equality of all people, the rights of free speech and assembly, the right of the individual to the security of his person and property, and the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people. In its demands for the right of the governed to participate in their governing, the Independence Club had in effect launched a grassroots political movement for political democracy in Korea. Third, the Independence Club sought to promote a movement of self-strengthening by establishing schools in each village to provide a new and more modern kind of education. In their drive to expand the commercial and industrial infrastructure in Korea, the Club promoted the construction of textile and paper mills and ironworks to further Korea's commercial capacity and industry. Finally, they urged the development of a more modern national defense capability, including a navy, to ensure the security of the country. With the future of the peninsula increasingly tied to the fortunes of Japan and Russia, the Independence Club gained strength throughout Korea, generating a force that gave some hope to a future free from foreign influence. It unleashed a strong sense of independence among the people and generated the hope for a future free of foreign domination, the first prerequisite for the formation of a modern state. Clash with the government and disbanding the club The Independence Club launched a movement to establish a national assembly in April 1898. In October 1898 the club held demonstrations in front of palace in response to the government's attempts to revise repressive pre-Gabo laws. Participants included yangban, students, monks, merchants, and other commoners, as well as outcastes. The club mobilized a thousand people a day, causing great public excitement, and appears to have come close to forcing Gojong to give into their demands for an appointed assembly. The Independence Club took ‚Äúloyalty to the emperor and patriotism for the country‚Äù as its motto. The organization tried to criticize the government for corruption, while not directly insulting Emperor Gojong, distinguish him from his ‚Äúwicked‚Äù officials. Gojong, however, seems to have seen the Independence Club as a threat to his power. When the club voted to recall Park Yeong-hyo from Japan to sit in the assembly, conservatives in the court struck back. Conservatives charged that the club was plotting to overthrow the Emperor, and on November 5, 1898, seventeen club members were arrested. This resulted in bloody street battles in November that brought Seoul to a state of near anarchy. The Emperor condemned the club, saying it had \\"ignored government orders, rudely repudiated the court, and expelled the ministers.\\" He resented that the club members did not heed his ordinances ordering them to curb their activities, and he ordered the organization be dissolved. After continued riots, in December 1898 Gojong enforced martial law and arrested 340 leaders of the Independence Club, sent troops to break up demonstrations, and forbade popular assemblies. Several of the leaders went into exile. Gojong preferred to uphold royal authority rather than risk opening the political system to public participation. The following years saw the Emperor work to consolidate monarchical power, and discourage public opposition.

Biography Young was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, moving to Milwaukee in about 1945. He was an amateur boxer in the 1940s, but he later recalled that \\"It was nothing to write home about... I decided that music was the best thing to do.\\" He began his music career in the early 1950s, singing on the Milwaukee nightclub circuit and taking his stage name after the film of the same name. In 1955, he returned to Louisiana to make his recording debut, for Jiffy Records. He then moved to Chicago, where he worked as a sideman, notably with Joe Little & his Heart Breakers and later Billy Boy Arnold. After recording \\"Why Baby\\" / \\"Empty Arms\\" for Bobby Robinson's Fire Records in 1961, he performed with Otis Rush in the early 1960s, playing on Rush's album Cold Day in Hell. He also continued to record under his own name for small labels such as Webcor, Celtex, and Jacklyn. Biography by Bill Dahl, Allmusic.com. Retrieved 4 November 2016 He played on Magic Sam's albums West Side Soul and Black Magic and also worked with Jimmy Rogers, Willie Dixon, Tyrone Davis and Jimmy Dawkins. Young's album Blues with a Touch of Soul was released by Delmark Records in 1971, and two further albums followed on the Ovation label in the mid-1970s. Young regularly performed in the 1970s and 1980s at the Wise Fools Pub in Chicago. His song \\"Turning Point\\" was used in the feature film Thief (1981), directed by Michael Mann. In 1986 he began work on an album, eventually released in 1997 as Mighty Man. After he underwent surgery on a pinched nerve in his neck, he developed numbness in his fingers, which affected his ability to play guitar. In 1998, he underwent further surgery on his spine in an attempt to regain feeling in his fingers, but he died at the age of 71 after developing pneumonia. Appraisal Young's mid-1970s Ovation LPs were said by AllMusic's Bill Dahl to have \\"showcased the guitarist's blues-soul synthesis\\". Reviewing Young's 1976 self-titled LP in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: \\"If Young's voice weren't as gruffly workaday as his guitar, he might be a threat‚Äîhe's got a knack for the blues subject, from mama-in-law to barbecue to what money can buy.

She helped change the movement of women in the fashion industry, along with Donna Karan and Liz Claiborne. Awards Tricot St. Raphael was awarded the \\"Partners in Excellence Awards\\" in 1995. Tricot was selected from among 35,000 companies doing business with Nordstrom at the time. \\"The three companies selected exceeded our expectations in each of the judging categories: quality, value, service, partnership and business ethics,\\" said John Whitacre, Nordstrom co-president at the time.PR Newswire Business life Platovsky founded Tricot St. Raphael, a menswear company that manufactures sweaters, mostly out of Uruguay in 1973. Growing up with a family in the textile industry in Belgium, Cecile was very familiar with fashion at a young age, and in a 2009 interview she said \\"I have always wanted to design clothes\\" since I was young. Cecile said she wanted to \\"make sweaters for traditional people that wanted to be fashionable\\". When Cecile decided to start Tricot, she felt that Uruguay was the place to start, because they were well known for being a wool producing country, and \\"I figured if they produce wool, there must be factories\\". When she arrived in Montevideo, she knew one name through a relative and asked if he would like to manufacture menswear. When he agreed, the ecstatic Cecile began Tricot. While in Uruguay, Cecile stayed in the resort town of Punte del Este. She was so taken with the country and the places she had been that she named her company after her favorite hotel in Montevideo, The Hotel St. Raphael. She added \\"Tricot\\" which means \\"knitwear\\" in French. After designing her first line, she brought a few samples to a gentlemen she had met in New York. When he looked at the samples he said, \\"these are great, you should take part in a menswear fashion show next week\\". In her first day, she sold 8,000 sweaters. Later she tells Snyder, \\"I had a feeling that someone was watching over me.\\" Later that year, she received a call from the Neiman Marcus seller in Paris, he said \\"I cannot come to New York, but heard great things about your line and would love to see it, can you come and meet me in Dallas?\\" This was well before Tricot had a travel budget, so Cecile took the gamble and flew down to Dallas. On the spot Neiman Marcus made an order for $80,000 and put Tricot on the map. Tricot continued to grow and began selling to many better retail stores such as, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord and Taylor. In an interview discussing her career she said: > \\"I worked very hard for 32 years, six days a week, but looking back I had a > ball\\" As the company grew, so did potential buyers, and in December 2000 Tricot was purchased by Salant Corp. Platovsky continued to run the division. After 32 years in the business, Platovsky stepped down from the helm in July 2004.  Personal life  Cecile has three children and lives on the Upper West Side. Her son Ronald was the Vice President of Tricot before she sold it in 2004.

He speaks Spanish fluently, but in an interview he said \\"I didn't want people to think I was a Latin singer like Enrique Iglesias. Not because those people are bad, because they make great music. But I didn't want anyone to get the wrong idea.

Inspired by artists like Michael Jackson and Daft Punk, he eventually began writing and recording some songs as a side project in his Dallas-based bedroom with a laptop and Wurlitzer to assist him. By November 2004, Dubuc had self-released his first full-length album, entitled Antarctica. Less than a year later, he followed up with the EP This Is Bigger Than You and I, which was issued through Doll House Recordings. Momentum began building around his distinctive electronica laptop pop/rock, and The Secret Handshake developed a devoted fanbase. Another EP, Summer of '98 (referring to the summer before he started high school), was released in early 2007 through New York's Triple Crown Records, anchored by the vocoder- heavy title track. The full length One Full Year followed, becoming his full length Triple Crown Records debut. In 2008 The Secret Handshake was featured on the Punk Goes Crunk compilation/covers album, where he covered Skee-Lo's rap classic \\"I Wish\\". On April 29, 2009, The Secret Handshake released his third studio album, My Name Up in Lights. The album was recorded entirely in Dubuc's apartment in Dallas. In 2009, the album reached #17 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart and #45 on the Independent Albums chart.Charts, Billboard.com The Secret Handshake opened for the Alternative Press Tour 2009, entitled The Fall Ball, which also featured You Me At Six, Set Your Goals, The Academy Is..., and Mayday Parade. Luis Dubuc was featured on the subscriber- only cover of Alternative Press November 2009 issue, along with the lead singers of the other bands featured on The Fall Ball tour with a feature article. The Secret Handshake toured in Australia from November 26 to December 6. The Secret Handshake finished a two-month tour in the summer of 2010 with Every Avenue, Sing it Loud, and There for Tomorrow on the Motel 6 \\"Rock Yourself to Sleep\\" tour. The Secret Handshake's fourth studio album Night & Day was released on August 17, 2010. Sound In The Signals complimented the new style found on the album, but criticized Dubuc's vocal ability. Alternative Press noted the new Motown sound was a risky move but stated that Dubuc \\"obviously had the skills to pull it off\\". Luis Dubuc was interviewed in the Alternative Press October 2010 issue, in the feature article titled You Can Hurry Love. = Mystery Skulls (2011‚Äìpresent) = In 2011, Dubuc put The Secret Handshake to sleep and began to make music under the name Mystery Skulls. In 2013, Mystery Skulls signed with Warner Bros. Records. His debut album as Mystery Skulls featured collaborations with Nile Rodgers, Adam Lambert, and Avicii. Dubuc followed up with his sophomore album \\"One of Us\\" in 2017, originally envisioned to be a soundtrack for an accompanying film. In early 2018 Dubuc began airing live streams from his studio inviting fans to collaborate on his upcoming third album. Over the next several months he aired weekly videos on either YouTube or his Patreon. In fall of 2018 via Instagram Dubuc announced he was in the end stages of developing the new Mystery Skulls album and also working on a side project \\"Sex Moves\\".

Drivers for master data management  Organisations, or groups of organisations, may establish the need for master data management when they hold more than one copy of data about a business entity. Holding more than one copy of this master data inherently means that there is an inefficiency in maintaining a \\"single version of the truth\\" across all copies. Unless people, processes and technology are in place to ensure that the data values are kept aligned across all copies, it is almost inevitable that different versions of information about a business entity will be held. This causes inefficiencies in operational data use, and hinders the ability of organisations to report and analyse. At a basic level, master data management seeks to ensure that an organization does not use multiple (potentially inconsistent) versions of the same master data in different parts of its operations, which can occur in large organizations. Other problems include (for example) issues with the quality of data, consistent classification and identification of data, and data-reconciliation issues. Master data management of disparate data systems requires data transformations as the data extracted from the disparate source data system is transformed and loaded into the master data management hub. To synchronize the disparate source master data, the managed master data extracted from the master data management hub is again transformed and loaded into the disparate source data system as the master data is updated. As with other Extract, Transform, Load-based data movement, these processes are expensive and inefficient to develop and to maintain which greatly reduces the return on investment for the master data management product. There are a number of root causes for master data issues in organisations. These include: # Business unit and product line segmentation # Mergers and acquisitions = Business unit and product line segmentation = As a result of business unit and product line segmentation, the same business entity (such as Customer, Supplier, Product) will be serviced by different product lines; redundant data will be entered about the business entity in order to process the transaction. The redundancy of business entity data is compounded in the front- to back- office life cycle, where the authoritative single source for the party, account and product data is needed but is often once again redundantly entered or augmented. A typical example is the scenario of a bank at which a customer has taken out a mortgage and the bank begins to send mortgage solicitations to that customer, ignoring the fact that the person already has a mortgage account relationship with the bank. This happens because the customer information used by the marketing section within the bank lacks integration with the customer information used by the customer services section of the bank. Thus the two groups remain unaware that an existing customer is also considered a sales lead. The process of record linkage is used to associate different records that correspond to the same entity, in this case the same person. = Mergers and acquisitions = One of the most common reasons some large corporations experience massive issues with master data management is growth through mergers or acquisitions. Any organizations which merge will typically create an entity with duplicate master data (since each likely had at least one master database of its own prior to the merger). Ideally, database administrators resolve this problem through deduplication of the master data as part of the merger. In practice, however, reconciling several master data systems can present difficulties because of the dependencies that existing applications have on the master databases. As a result, more often than not the two systems do not fully merge, but remain separate, with a special reconciliation process defined that ensures consistency between the data stored in the two systems. Over time, however, as further mergers and acquisitions occur, the problem multiplies, more and more master databases appear, and data-reconciliation processes become extremely complex, and consequently unmanageable and unreliable. Because of this trend, one can find organizations with 10, 15, or even as many as 100 separate, poorly integrated master databases, which can cause serious operational problems in the areas of customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, decision support, and regulatory compliance. Another problem concerns determining the proper degree of detail and normalization to include in the master data schema. For example, in a federated HR environment, the enterprise may focus on storing people data as a current status, adding a few fields to identify date of hire, date of last promotion, etc. However this simplification can introduce business impacting errors into dependent systems for planning and forecasting. The stakeholders of such systems may be forced to build a parallel network of new interfaces to track onboarding of new hires, planned retirements, and divestment, which works against one of the aims of master data management.  People, Process and Technology  Master data management is enabled by technology, but is more than the technologies that enable it. An organisation's master data management capability will include also people and process in its definition. = People = Several roles should be manned within MDM. Most prominently the Data Owner and the Data Steward. Probably several people would be allocated to each role, each person responsible for a subset of Master Data (e.g. one data owner for employee master data, another for customer master data). The Data Owner is responsible for the requirements for data quality, data security etc. as well as for compliance with data governance and data management procedures. The Data Owner should also be funding improvement projects in case of deviations from the requirements. The Data Steward is running the master data management on behalf of the data owner and probably also being an advisor to the Data Owner. = Process = Master data management can be viewed as a \\"discipline for specialized quality improvement\\"DAMA-DMBOK Guide,2010 DAMA International defined by the policies and procedures put in place by a data governance organization. It has the objective of providing processes for collecting, aggregating, matching, consolidating, quality-assuring, persisting and distributing master data throughout an organization to ensure a common understanding, consistency, accuracy and control, in the ongoing maintenance and application use of that data. Processes commonly seen in master data management include source identification, data collection, data transformation, normalization, rule administration, error detection and correction, data consolidation, data storage, data distribution, data classification, taxonomy services, item master creation, schema mapping, product codification, data enrichment, hierarchy management, business semantics management and data governance. = Technology = A master data management tool can be used to support master data management by removing duplicates, standardizing data (mass maintaining), and incorporating rules to eliminate incorrect data from entering the system in order to create an authoritative source of master data. Master data are the products, accounts and parties for which the business transactions are completed. Where the technology approach produces a \\"golden record\\" or relies on a \\"source of record\\" or \\"system of record\\", it is common to talk of where the data is \\"mastered\\". This is accepted terminology in the information technology industry, but care should be taken, both with specialists and with the wider stakeholder community, to avoid confusing the concept of \\"master data\\" with that of \\"mastering data\\".  Implementation models  There are a number of models for implementing a technology solution for master data management. These depend on an organisation's core business, its corporate structure and its goals. These include: # Source of record # Registry # Consolidation # Coexistence # Transaction/centralized = Source of record = This model identifies a single application, database or simpler source (e.g. a spreadsheet) as being the \\"source of record\\" (or \\"system of record\\" where solely application databases are relied on). The benefit of this model is its conceptual simplicity, but it may not fit with the realities of complex master data distribution in large organisations. The source of record can be federated, for example by groups of attribute (so that different attributes of a master data entity may have different sources of record) or geographically (so that different parts of an organisation may have different master sources). Federation is only applicable in certain use cases, where there is clear delineation of which subsets of records will be found in which sources. The source of record model can be applied more widely than simply to master data, for example to reference data. = Registry = This model maintains a central registry, linking records across various source systems. It spots duplicates by running cleansing and matching algorithms, then assigns unique global identifiers to matched records to help identify a \\"single version of the truth\\". This model does not send data back to the source systems, so changes to master data continue to be made through existing source systems. When a single, comprehensive view of a customer is needed, it uses each reference system to build a view in real-time. This model may be useful where an organisation has a large number of source systems spread across the world, and it is difficult to establish an authoritative source. It also enables analysing data while avoiding the risk of overwriting information in the source systems. = Consolidation = In this model, master data is generally consolidated from multiple sources in the hub to create a single version of truth, often referred to in this context as the \\"golden record\\". Any updates made to the master data are then applied to the original sources. Consolidated hubs are inexpensive and quick to set up (as MDM solutions go!). This model is mainly used for analysis and reporting. = Coexistence = This model provides a \\"golden record\\" in the same way as the Consolidation model, but master data changes can happen in the MDM system as well as in the application systems. This tends to make deployment more expensive. The main benefit of this style is that data is mastered in source systems and then synchronized with the hub, so data can coexist harmoniously and still offer a single version of the truth. Another benefit of this approach is that the quality of master data is improved, and access is faster. Reporting is also easier as all master data attributes are in a single place. = Transaction/centralized = This model stores and maintains master data attributes using linking, cleansing, matching and enriching algorithms to enhance the data. The enhanced data can then be published back to its respective source system. This requires intrusion into the source systems for the two-way interactions. Source systems can subscribe to updates published by the central system to give complete consistency. The main benefit of this style is that master data is accurate and complete at all times while security and visibility policies at a data attribute level can be supported by the Transaction style hub. An organisation gains a centralized set of master data for one or more domains.  Transmission of master data  There are several ways in which master data may be collated and distributed to other systems.\\"Creating the Golden Record: Better Data Through Chemistry\\", DAMA, slide 26, Donald J. Soulsby, 22 October 2009 This include: # Data consolidation ‚Äì The process of capturing master data from multiple sources and integrating into a single hub (operational data store) for replication to other destination systems. #Data federation ‚Äì The process of providing a single virtual view of master data from one or more sources to one or more destination systems. # Data propagation ‚Äì The process of copying master data from one system to another, typically through point-to-point interfaces in legacy systems. Change management in implementation Master data management can suffer in its adoption within a large organization if the \\"single version of the truth\\" concept is not bought into by stakeholders who believe that their local definition of the master data is necessary. For example, the product hierarchy used to manage inventory may be entirely different from the product hierarchies used to support marketing efforts or pay sales reps. It is above all necessary to identify if different master data is genuinely required. If it is required, then the solution implemented (technology and process) must be able to allow multiple versions of the truth to exist, but will provide simple, transparent ways to reconcile the necessary differences. If it is not required, processes must be adjusted. Without this active management, users that need the alternate versions will simply \\"go around\\" the official processes, thus reducing the effectiveness of the company's overall master data management program.

The function of a \\"substation\\" was to convert very high voltage alternating current (AC) from a power generating plant (often miles away) for an AC to lower voltage DC conversion. The high voltage AC entered the substation, was dropped in level by a transformer, and the resulting lower voltage AC was then fed to a device called a Rotary Converter for the conversion to 600 volts DC. Substations existed on every trolley and interurban line in the United States and often still do for today's subway and light rail lines although the very large and cumbersome rotary converter,as much as eight feet in diameter and rotating, has been replaced by solid state converters.The Electric Interurban Railways in the United States, George W.Hilton, 1952 PE's Altadena Substation #8 Pacific Electric Railway Company Substation No. 8, also known as the Altadena Substation, is a National Register of Historic Places structure (site #77000295) in Altadena, California. Originally used to power Pacific Electric Railway (PE) lines in the Altadena area, it is today used as an office building. The PE's traction substation was built in 1905. In addition to providing power to the PE lines, it also powered the Mount Lowe Railway. In 1941, when PE sold its Pasadena area lines to Pasadena City Lines, a subsidiary of National City Lines, the substation was included in the sale. It was placed on the Register in 1977 for its significance as a part of the Pacific Electric Railway.

His former name was \\"Shaoquan\\" () and he also wrote under the name \\"Hs√º An-ch'eng\\"(). Jiang was initially attracted by the doctrines of Anarchism and organized the Chinese Socialist Party, the first anarchist-socialist party in China, which existed from 1911 to 1913. As his politics became more conservative, he founded Southern University in Shanghai, taught at University of California, Berkeley, and became chair of the Department of Chinese Studies at McGill University in Canada. During the Second Sino-Japanese War he joined the Japanese-sponsored Reorganized National Government of China. He was arrested as a traitor following the war, and died in a Shanghai jail in 1954. Biography=Early life= Jiang Kanghu as pictured in The Most Recent Biographies of Important Chinese People He was born in Yiyang, Jiangxi, China. Jiang, whose reading abilities included Japanese, English, French, and German, learned and began to develop a passion for socialism and anarchism while studying and traveling in Europe and Japan. In 1909 he attended the congress of the Second International in Brussels. On his return to China, he served as educational adviser to Yuan Shikai.Jonathan Spence, In Search of Modern China (New York: Norton: 1999), p.260. =Early political and literary activities= Jiang served briefly as a professor at Peking University, but was ousted from that position on the grounds of his ideological radicalism.Gillin, Donald G. Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911-1949. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1967. pp.206-207 In August 1911, shortly after losing his post at Peking University, Jiang Kanghu established the Association for Socialism, and in November renamed it the Socialist Party of China. The next year Jiang devoted himself to reformism, leading Sha Gan () and many anarchists to withdraw from Jiang's party. In autumn 1913, the Chinese Socialist Party was dissolved by Yuan Shikai's order, and Jiang went to United States. He became an instructor at the University of California, Berkeley, where he presented a collection of 10,000 Chinese books to the University. In 1920 he returned to China. While teaching at Berkeley, Jiang met a fellow faculty member, Witter Bynner, and the two struck up a long lasting friendship based on their love of poetry. Bynner later recalled him as a ‚Äúgentle scholar‚Äù and a ‚Äúman of principle and brave action.‚Äù Jiang‚Äôs off-handed quotations from Chinese literature and poetry led to a collaboration on a translation of the canonical anthology, Three Hundred Tang Poems .Bynner, ‚ÄúRemembering a Gentle Scholar,‚Äù The Occident (Winter 1953), reprinted in Witter Bynner. The Chinese Translations. (New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, The Works of Witter Bynner, 1978. ), pp. 3-4. Jiang supplied word by word literal translations, then Bynner wrote poems in English which achieved a remarkable balance of faithfulness and literary quality. The volume was published as The Jade Mountain (New York: Knopf, 1928), which has remained constantly in print.Burton Watson, ‚ÄúIntroduction to The Jade Mountain,‚Äù in Bynner. The Chinese Translations p. 26. Throughout his life, Jiang continued to promote his views through his personal contacts, through his academic work, and through his writing. When he no longer found the doctrines of anarchism persuasive, he conducted an extensive public debate with anarchist intellectuals such as Liu Shifu which clarified their points of difference. His views influenced contemporary Chinese who later became major political figures in China. After he became estranged from them, Chinese anarchists accused Jiang of being \\"hopelessly confused.\\" This confusion was not apparent to Mao Zedong, who later stated that, as a student, Jiang's writings had been a major influence on the development of his own political, social, and economic theories. =Academic career= Through his views, Jiang came to be known as a \\"Socialistic Confucian\\". Jiang attempted to provide a traditional sanction for nationalizing agriculture by arguing that in antiquity there had existed an agrarian socialist utopia built around the well-field system that vanished after the Qin dynasty abolished the public ownership of land (which Jiang identified with contemporary practices of land tenureship). Jiang promoted the abolition of private property, a model of rapid industrialization led by the state, as much local self-government as possible, the establishment of universal public schooling, and the advancement of women's rights. In April 1921 Jiang visited the Soviet Union. He participated in the Comintern Third World Congress in Moscow, and met with Vladimir Lenin. In August 1921, Jiang returned to China. In September 1921 Jiang established Southern University in Shanghai and became the president of that university. While he was the president of Southern, Jiang criticized the Comintern and openly opposed both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China. In 1922, Jiang visited Taiyuan, Shanxi, three times, with the intention of convincing the local warlord, Yan Xishan, of the need to carry out political, social, and economic reforms in Shanxi. Although Jiang ultimately failed to convince Yan to follow Jiang's suggestions for reform at that time, Jiang's ideas left a great and lasting impression on Yan. Over the next two decades, Yan would adopt ideas and methods that were very similar to those proposed by Jiang. Particular ideas that Yan may have borrowed from Jiang include the glorification of the village, a dislike for the money economy, a belief that the state must take over responsibilities previously held by the family, his hatred of \\"parasites\\" (mostly landlords and money-lenders), and the belief that practice (i.e. manual labour) is an inseparable component of learning. In June 1924, Jiang reestablished the Chinese Socialist Party, and in January 1925 renamed it the New Social Democratic Party of China. In the Northern Expedition, Jiang cooperated closely with the Beiyang General Wu Peifu, who fought against Chiang Kai-shek's National Revolutionary Army. After the defeat of Wu Peifu to Chiang Kai-shek, Jiang was publicly criticized by the Kuomintang. In the face of public opposition Jiang dissolved his party and escaped to Canada. Jiang served as Canada's first sinologist between 1930 and 1933, when McGill University appointed him as the Professor of Chinese Studies. During his professorship at McGill, Jiang gained international notoriety through attacking Pearl Buck's The Good Earth in the pages of the Chinese Christian Student. Jiang wrote that although peasants, coolies, and other humble persons constituted the vast majority of the Chinese population, they \\"are certainly not representative of the Chinese people.\\" Peter J. Conn. Pearl S. Buck : A Cultural Biography. (Cambridge England; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996. ) pp. 126-172. In 1933, Jiang returned to China and devoted himself to promoting socialism and traditional Chinese culture. In 1935, Jiang again visited Taiyuan, after Yan Xishan announced plans to implement a system of land reform in Shanxi. Jiang's impression of Yan at this time was so great that Jiang wrote an article lavishing praise on Yan, calling the warlord a \\"practical rather than a theoretical socialist.\\" =Collaboration with Wang Jingwei= After the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, Jiang escaped to Hong Kong. In 1939 he was invited by Wang Jingwei to take a position in Wang's Reorganized National Government of China based in Nanjing. Jiang accepted Wang's offer and traveled to Shanghai, where he wrote \\"The Shuangshijie Declaration about this Situation\\" (), asserting the establishment of a New East Asian Order. Jiang was appointed Chief of the Examination Yuan in March 1942. After the surrender of Japan and collapse of the collaborationist Reorganized National Government of China, Jiang Kanghu was arrested by Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Government as a traitor. However, due to the ongoing Chinese Civil War, his case was never brought to trial. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, he remained imprisoned in Shanghai at the Tilanqiao Prison. Jiang Kanghu died in prison due to malnutrition and tuberculosis on December 7, 1954.

Etymology According to le Strange, the name Urtas is probably a corruption of Hortus, which has the same meaning as Firdus (Paradise),Le Strange, 1890, p. 440 while E.H. Palmer thought it was a personal name. The name might also be derived from Latin hortus meaning garden, hence the name Hortus Conclusus of the nearby Catholic Convent. Geography Artas is located (horizontal distance) south-west of Bethlehem. It is bordered by Hindaza to the east, Ad Duheisha camp to the north, Al Khader to the west, and Wadi Rahhal to the south. The Israeli Settlement of Efrat is located nearby which has been rapidly expanding around Artas and has recently expanded to 2 strategic hilltops facing at Artas called Givat Hadagan and Givat Hatamar.Another exclusively Jewish Israeli Settlement neighborhood of Efrat is planned to be built to surround Artas called Givat Eitam which is across the hill on top of the Christian monastery on the last piece of land that is available for the squished metropolitan area of Bethlehem to expand . Artas and the surrounding area is characterized by the diversity of landscapes, flora and fauna due to its location at a meeting place of ecosystems.Artas Valley From a spring below the village an aqueduct used to carry water to Birket el Hummam by Jebel el Fureidis.Conder & Kitchener, SWP III, 1883, p. 161 History=Fatimid to Mamluk eras= According to Moshe Sharon, professor of early Islamic history at Hebrew University, two inscriptions found in the village show the great interest in Artas from leaders in the Fatimid and Mamluk states, as well as the wealth of the village at that time.Sharon, 1997, pp. 117- 120 Nasir Khusraw (1004-1088) wrote that \\"a couple of leagues from Jerusalem is a place where there are four villages, and there is here a spring of water, with numerous gardens and orchards, and it is called Faradis (or the Paradises), on account of the beauty of the spot.\\" During the Crusader period, the village was known as Artasium, or Iardium Aschas. In 1227, Pope Gregory IX confirmed that the village had been given to the Church of Bethlehem.R√∂hricht, 1893, p. 259, no 983; cited in Pringle, 1993, p. 61 Remains of the Crusader church were torn down in the 19th century.Baldensperger, 1913, p. 114 =Ottoman era= Artas, 1940 The village was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1596 it appeared in the tax registers as being in the Nahiya of Quds of the Liwa of Quds. It had a population of 32 Muslim households. The villagers paid a fixed amount of 5,500 ak√ße in taxes, and all of the revenue went to a Muslim charitable endowment.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 116 Until the 19th century, the Artas residents were responsible for guarding Solomon's Pools, a water system conducting water to Bethlehem, Herodium, and the Temple Mount or Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem. The village had a tradition of hosting foreign and local scholars, not a few of whom were women.A Century and a Half of Women's Encounters in Artas As a result, there is a great body of work on all aspects of the village.Recommended Reading and Selected Bibliography of Artas In 1838, Edward Robinson noted it as a Muslim village, located south of Wadi er-Rahib.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 3, 2nd appendix, p. 123 The place was described as being inhabited, though with many houses in ruins. Robinson also found many signs of antiquity, including foundations of a square tower.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 2, p. 168 He further noted the fine fountain above it, which watered many gardens.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 2, p. 164 In the mid-19th century, James Finn, the British Consul of Jerusalem (1846-1863), and his wife Elisabeth Ann Finn, bought land in Artas to establish an experimental farm where they planned to employ poverty-stricken Jews from the Old City of Jerusalem. Johann Gros Steinbeck (grandfather of the author John Steinbeck) and his brother Friedrich, settled there under the leadership of John Meshullam, a converted Jew and member of a British missionary society.Mountain of Despair, Haaretz Clorinda S. Minor also lived in Artas in 1851 and 1853. The French explorer Victor Gu√©rin visited the area in July 1863,Gu√©rin, 1869, p. 104 ff and he described the village to have about 300 inhabitants. Many of the village houses appeared to be built of ancient materials.Gu√©rin, 1869, p. 108 An official Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Artas had 18 houses and a population of 60, though the population count included only men.Socin, 1879, p. 144 It was noted in the Hebron districtHartmann, 1883, p. 148 In 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Artas as \\"a small village perched against hill-side...with a good spring behind it whence an aqueduct led to Jebel Furedis...remains of a reservoir Humman Suleiman.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, 'Urtas'. p. 27.

She \\"arrived in Palestine in order to find the Jewish ancestors of Scripture. What she found instead was a Palestinian people with a distinct culture and way of life. She therefore changed the focus of her research to a full investigation of the customs, habits and ways of thinking of the people of that village.

He was a great believer in productivity, an ideology that was very much in vogue at the time, and in 1853 purchased for ¬£250 Karm al-Khalil (Arabic for \\"Abraham's Vineyard\\", lit. \\"vineyard of the loved one\\", which in Hebrew became Kerem Avraham) a barren piece of land outside the walls of the Old City. Kerem Avraham was established as a training farm for Jews in agriculture and to become productive citizens. Finn employed Jewish labourers to build the first house there in 1855. Cisterns for water storage were built and a soap factory was established which produced high quality soap sold to tourists. He helped establish the experimental farm at the village of Artas outside Bethlehem. Finn was removed from his post in 1863. His superiors believed he had become too personally involved in local affair. His insolvency and clashes with Samuel Gobat, the Protestant Bishop of Jerusalem, also contributed to his removal.

It was built in 1904 as the central feature of the Scripps Estate, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History and significance  Scripps Hall was built by William Armiger Scripps. The house is a three-story Arts and Crafts style residence designed by architect Charles W. Buchanan. Scripps lived in a small bungalow on his property near the intersection of Mariposa Street and Fair Oaks Avenue in 1904 while his three-story mansion was built. He planted citrus and olive groves on his 'Scripps Estate' located in the community then known as North Pasadena. After William died Scripps Hall was subsequently passed to his grandson. The western portion of the property was subdivided. In 1979, with the residence threatened with demolition, the Altadena Heritage Association coordinated the historic home's sale to the Pasadena Waldorf School, one of many Waldorf Schools around the world. Scripps Hall was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999 under Criterion A for its representation of local history and development patterns (#99000893). The nomination notes that the property is significant for its \\"design by a well-known local architect, C. W. Buchanan (only one of two of his major works still standing in Altadena); its high state of integrity; its association with a regionally significant long-term original owner, the Scripps family; and its prominence within the historic context of Altadena's residential growth and development during the first decades of the 20th century. It is the most intact example of the estates that once lined Altadena's 'Millionaire's Row.'\\"  William A. Scripps  William Armiger Scripps was the son of James Mogg Scripps. His father was a prominent bookbinder in England and came to America in 1844 with six motherless children. Scripps grew up on a Rushville, Illinois farm, where his father remarried. William moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he and his brother George opened a print shop. His other siblings and half-siblings, such as E. W. Scripps and James E. Scripps, owned and operated major newspapers around the country. After the original print shop was destroyed by fire, William Scripps moved to Southern California, being financially supported by the family newspaper empire, the E. W. Scripps Company. Scripps spent some time with his siblings in La Jolla, California, before moving to Altadena in 1904. William Scripps' sister was Ellen Browning Scripps, also involved with the founding of the E. W. Scripps Company, who become a prominent philanthropist in founding: the Scripps Research Institute, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Scripps College, and the Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden. William also became involved in community philanthropy and founded 'Scripps Home' in Altadena for the elderly.

As of 2011 the group is on indefinite hiatus.  History  James Asmus, John Bohan, and Jim Fath met as castmates of Cabaret Dada in Cleveland in 2003. In 2004, all having moved to Chicago, they formed the group \\"The Leading Brand\\". The group's first effort, \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Death\\", was a sketch show molded into a narrative following the story of a terminally ill man named Charlie Peeler and those seemingly oblivious characters around him. It was eventually performed at the Apollo Theater in Chicago in the spring of 2005 and then again in the same space that fall. After a brief hiatus the group resurfaced under the new name \\"Hey You Millionaires\\" (HYM).

The group consists of a core of around 20 regularly active artists, rising to around 100 when additional participants are called upon for a particular task. Ztohoven aims for a limited number of high quality works, as opposed to concentrating on a high volume of minor works. Thus, the group tends to disappear from public notice for long periods only to resurface, sometimes years later. The group aims to use familiar tools and methods to challenge public perceptions of society. Members of the group are anonymous, and use pseudonyms when appearing or commenting in public. Many of the names used by the group's members are puns, some of which (e.g. Roman Tyc, Dan Gerous or Ana Ward) are chosen to work in English as well as Czech. Among the most active members are Roman T√Ωc and Tom√°≈° Jasn√Ω (alias Philip Dvorsk√Ω). The Ztohoven name is itself a Czech-language pun, and can be read either as ' (\\"The way out\\"), or ' (\\"One hundred shits\\"). The group translates the name into English as \\"Out of shit\\".  Projects = The question mark above the Prague Castle = First event of Ztohoven at all was when they covered the left half of a 20 meter tall pink neon heart by Czech artist Ji≈ô√≠ David and installed on V√°clav Havel's demand on the rooftop of the Prague Castle, the seat of the President. Under the heart Ztohoven installed a red light with a diameter of one meter. From distance, a big question mark was seen instead of a heart. The heart was a part of a famous sign of V√°clav Havel, who was ending his presidency at that time. The Czech nation was absorbed by a large doubt: Who will be the next and who could replace Havel? = Subconscious raped = In 2003, Ztohoven replaced all 750 posters in the backlighted advertisement display cases (\\"Citylights\\") in Prague's subway system by white posters with a big black question mark and a web address of their web site. This overnight action hit all the people on their way to the work during the morning. Ztohoven's web page showed nothing but a few words that at 2pm there would be more information displayed. At 2pm the webpage turned into an invitation to an opening of an instant exhibition in the vestibule of the Dejvick√° subway station, where each of Ztohoven members, plus invited artists, turned existing citylights into original art pieces using all the advantages of this media ‚Äì backlight, electricity, sound and space. Everything was cleaned up by subway workers during the next 24 hours, but in the meantime, hundreds of people came to see and witness this event which had no precedent in Czech art history. In connection to the choice of typically advertising media and because of parody of promoting themselves in order to promote the principles of art, the group named this act \\"Subconscious raped\\" (Zn√°silnƒõn√Ω Podvƒõdom√≠).Skupina Ztohoven vydƒõsila v ƒåT atomov√Ωm v√Ωbuchem. - iDNES.cz It was their first action that led to prosecution of a group. = The Media Reality = Atomic explosion - mushroom cloud in a public TV broadcast On 17 June 2007, Ztohoven disconnected one of the cameras used for automatic live forecast broadcast from Krkono≈°e mountains and connected their own pre-recorded video source. On the live morning ƒåT2 TV show \\"Panorama\\", the pre-recorded video was broadcast; it depicted a fictitious atomic explosion with mushroom cloud over the mountains. This led to the January 2008 announcement that six Ztohoven members would be prosecuted for scaremongering and spreading false information; they faced prison sentences of up to three years. On 25 March 2008 a Czech judge dismissed the scaremongering charges against the artists, citing public amusement rather than public unrest, but the prosecutor said the state would consider an appeal.Hacker Artists Cleared in Czech TV Stunt - New York Times - March 27, 2008 In December 2007, the Czech National Gallery awarded Ztohoven the NG 333 prize for works unrelated to the \\"Media Reality\\" incident; this included CZK 333 000. A Czech War of the Worlds: Mushroom Butt Pranksters to Stand Trial - International - SPIEGEL ONLINE - News = Citizen K. = This name of this 4th Ztohoven event is also a pun. In Czech language \\"Obƒçan K.\\" means \\"Citizen K.\\" while the word \\"Obƒçanka\\" is the colloquial expression for \\"Obƒçansk√Ω pr≈Økaz‚Äú - the Czech national identity card. With the same haircut, twelve members of Ztohoven took photo portraits. Using morphing software they merged two faces into one in which it would be possible to recognize the significant facial features of both. They applied for new IDs, but each of them used the name of his colleague. Through twelve months they lived under that fictitious identity, participated in elections, traveled abroad, applied for and received a gun license, or even married. After this period, on an exposition launched 18 June 2010 they revealed their secret identities including documentation of entire process. Their IDs were confiscated and Roman T√Ωc was arrested. = Non multi sed multa = In July 2011 Ztohoven added one cross to the remaining 27 crosses lying on Staromƒõstsk√© n√°mƒõst√≠ (Old Town Square in Prague) in order to express a tribute to unjustly neglected Martin Fruwein from Podol√≠ - one of the 28 Czech Lords claimed responsible and executed for the revolt for Czech ideals - who has apparently committed a suicide in time, so on the day of execution (21 June 1621) only his dead body was decapitated. According to Mrs Maria Klodinska, a historian of Academy of Sciences of Czech Republic, placing the 28th cross is historically justified, because those 27 Czech Lords were in fact 28. The 28th cross remained laying unnoticed for three days. = The Moral Reform = Moral reform of political scene, initiated by Czech controversial art group Ztohoven, caused confusion at the 40th meeting of the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic Parliament from its very beginning. In a sophisticated way Ztohoven managed to send 585 SMS messages directly to cell phones of deputies, government members, selected members of the President of Czech Republic office including the president himself and selected journalists. Ztohoven found a way of sending the messages on behalf of deputies themselves (spoofing) which caused surprise and confusion. This caused the message to appear on the cellphone display under the name of the sender. During the first minutes people were watching a live broadcast from Congress on Czech TV - targeted deputies staring at their mobiles, twisting heads, searching for the authors of messages in order to confirm the sender. In the end, selected journalists were targeted asked to reserve their time for a government declaration of The Moral Reform. This time, Ztohoven delayed their signing up. The magazine T√Ωden was the first who informed that it may be the Ztohoven who are behind this on 6 June in the morning. Later that day, on their webpage Ztohoven confirmed their authorship and posted The Manifest of The Moral Reform as well as an interactive web application of The Moral Reform on Ztohoven.com where everyone can go through from who, to who and what was the messages including the content of all of the 585 sent messages. The text messages called for a moral reform in Czech politics across political parties, forget personal differences and work towards better future. In November 2012 the group published cell phone numbers of Czech deputies and President as a part of the exhibition Mor√°ln√≠ reforma (The Moral Reform) in the modern art center DOX, Prague - Hole≈°ovice. = The red boxer shorts over Prague Castle = On Saturday 19 September 2015, members of Ztohoven stole the presidential flag flying over Prague Castle and replaced it with a flag-sized mock up of a pair of red boxer shorts. The incident was confirmed by Castle spokesman Ji≈ô√≠ Ovƒç√°ƒçek. On his Twitter account, Ovƒç√°cek referred to the fascisization of \\"Pra≈æsk√° kav√°rna\\" (literally \\"Prague cafe\\", presumably meaning Prague cafe society, a term used by Milo≈° Zeman to describe his opponents) and said that they no longer recoil from desecrating a state symbol. A confusingly backdated blog post on the group website linked to a video of the prank and stated that finally, here was flying the standard of a man who is ashamed of nothing. Alongside this was a poem of three stanzas. In the first stanza, the giant boxer shorts are described as being as red as the Chinese flag, embarrassment and rage. In the second, they are said to be fluttering, not missing the buttocks which are evermore disfiguring the country. In the third ironic stanza, the garment is said to be waving as the standard of a lord who is the arbiter of elegance and wisdom. News reports on Sunday had it that the Czech political class was unconcerned by events. Czech Premier, Bohuslav Sobotka, took the prank as \\"a coarse practical joke\\" and dismissed any suggestion that it might be related to fascism. \\"The country that gave the world J√°ra Cimrman will undoubtedly be able to cope with a giant pair of boxer shorts flapping over the castle,\\" he said. \\"Own up, who's missing a pair of red boxers?\\" asked chairman of KDU-ƒåSL and minister of Agriculture, Marian Jureƒçka on his Twitter account. The chairman of ODS, Petr Fiala, took a different stance, describing the stunt as \\"in bad taste\\". \\"The flag is a state symbol and does not belong to Milo≈° Zeman\\", he said, \\"and we ought to honour it irrespective of what we think of the individual holding office.\\" The minister of Defence, Martin Stropnick√Ω of ANO, considered that the action was a form of democracy and said he was not greatly concerned by it. The previous week, he added, while in conversation with television political correspondent V√°clav Moravec, the security arrangements at the Castle had been discussed without regard to the issue of giant red boxer shorts, and had been found wanting. The latest Ztohoven stunt would do nothing to change their need for improvement. The boxer shorts were publicly burnt by firemen in the presence of Zeman at an impromptu press conference three years later, on 15 June 2018.Czech president calls press conference for underwear burning. BBC.com, 15 June 2018. Czech media said the president had purchased the same boxer shorts from the state property office for the price of one Czech crown.

He was born in Idria, Carniola, then in Austria (now Slovenia), the son of a mining official. He studied philosophy and theology and became a priest in 1796. His weak health prevented him from undertaking parish duties, and in 1796 he became a scribe in the library of the Ljubljana Lyceum, but soon gave this up, and for forty years devoted himself to teaching in the various schools of Ljubljana. In 1803 he was already director of the Normal School and in 1807 prefect of the high school, a job that he held until his sight failed. In his last years he was blind. He was honoured for his work there by Emperor Francis. During the French annexation under the Illyrian Provinces, Hladnik was appointed professor of botany and natural history at the Central School of Ljubljana, and presented with a piece of land to be laid out for the cultivation of the flora of Carniola. It soon contained 600 kinds of local plants. While occupied with his botanical garden, he also delivered lectures on botany and spent his holidays for thirty years in researching the crownland of Carniola. He died in Ljubljana, bequeathing his botanical collection to the Rudolfinum Public Museum, founded in Ljubljana in 1831. The museum contains his portrait, painted by Amalija Hermann von Hermannsthal. Among Hladnik's pupils was Alexander Skofitz, the founder of the √ñsterreichische botanische Zeitschrift (Austrian Botanical Journal). Hladnik discovered several new kinds of plants and certain genera have been named after him. He did not publish any scientific works; his manuscripts now in possession of the Carniola Historical Society are written in Latin, German, French, and Slovenian.

It was written and directed by Jeff Lowell. The film is about Kate (Eva Longoria), who dies on the day of her wedding to fianc√© Henry (Paul Rudd). He subsequently begins a relationship with psychic Ashley (Lake Bell) who becomes haunted by Kate trying to sabotage their relationship. The film was released in the United States and Canada on February 1, 2008. Plot Kate and Henry are a happy couple. Henry proposed to Kate and they are about to be married, but on the day of their wedding, Kate is accidentally killed by an ice sculpture angel, because of the actions of an ice sculptor (Stephen Root). Unaware that she has died and her soul left her body, Kate awakens in Purgatory, and wastes precious time arguing with an angel who finally leaves before she can explain to Kate what she must do to move on. A year later, Henry's sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) hopes that he will find closure by consulting Ashley (Lake Bell), a psychic who also runs a catering business with her gay best friend Dan (Jason Biggs). After an unsuccessful first meeting, Chloe gives Kate's diary to Ashley so that she can pretend to communicate with Kate and convince Henry to move on with his life. In the process, Henry and Ashley fall for each other... much to the consternation of Kate, who has been watching over Henry. When Kate voices her displeasure, Ashley hears her, unaware of what it means. Angry over Ashley's deception and uncertain of what she is supposed to do, Kate later encounters the ice sculptor, and discovers that he is also a ghost (a result of a drunk driving accident). He explains to her that they must deal with their unfinished business. Believing that her job is to protect Henry, Kate proceeds to harass Ashley (who is the only one who can see or hear Kate). Using her ghostly abilities of intangibility, levitation, and auditory hallucination, Kate hopes to force Ashley to break up with Henry. Ashley persists, but then Henry discovers the fraud with the diary and breaks off the relationship. Despondent over the break-up, Ashley turns to Dan for solace, but is further distraught when Dan reveals that he is not gay and has secretly been in love with her for years. Over time, Ashley and Dan eventually reconcile. After several months of watching Henry fall back into a depressed funk, Kate encounters the sculptor once more, who points out that if she had resolved her unfinished business, she would have moved on to Heaven by now. When the sculptor asks her what she really wants, Kate reluctantly admits that she only wants Henry to be happy... and realizes that he could be happy with Ashley. Then the sculptor reveals that Kate was his unfinished business and he had to get her to do the right thing before moving on, which he does. Kate first attempts to convince Ashley to get back together with Henry but Ashley doesn't believe her change of heart, and is preparing to fly to Las Vegas with Dan. In desperation, Kate finds she is able to talk to Henry through his pet parrot and gets him to meet Ashley at the airport. Realizing that Henry has forgiven her and that she has Kate's blessing, Ashley joyfully embraces with Henry. At their wedding, Ashley delays her walk down the aisle to sit briefly in the back pew, to promise Kate that she will strive to make Henry happy. Also at the wedding, Dan makes a new connection with Chloe. Now ready to move on, Kate arrives once more in Purgatory, congratulated for her efforts by the angel and requests the \\"orb of true light\\" collected from Kate's loved ones. The angel leaves once again, leaving Kate in Purgatory.

Because of the pioneering success to establish an express company, other entrepreneurs in upstate New York, not far from John Butterfield‚Äôs home in Utica, also started express companies by using Butterfield‚Äôs vast transportation network. Henry Wells was from Auburn, NY (80-miles from Utica), and William Fargo was from Pompei, NY (50-miles from Utica) and their express companies of Wells & Co., and Livingston, Fargo & Co. became competitors of Butterfield, Wasson & Co. Butterfield saw the benefit of forming one company by consolidating the three separate companies. In 1850, The American Express Company was formed from the three companies into one consisting of two subdivisions. The company‚Äôs subdivision of Wells, Butterfield & Co. would control the express business from Buffalo, NY, to the east, and the subdivision of Livingston, Fargo & Co. would control the express business from Buffalo to St. Louis, Missouri.Syracuse Daily Standard, NY, \\"American Express Company, \\"April 5, 1850, p. 1. John Butterfield‚Äôs Overland Mail Company The Resource Study Act, to designate the Butterfield Trail as a National Historic Trail, was authorized under the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act (Public Law 111-11) signed by President Barack Obama on March 30, 2009. The act was completed and in June 2018 the bill was presented to Congress by Arkansas Senator John Boozman. Kirby Sanders was the consulting historian and lead researcher for the Butterfield study for the National Park Service.This is from his statement to historians on his Facebook site Butterfield Overland Trail Friends, March 22, 2014. Congressional authorized researcher Sanders put into perspective Wells, Fargo & Co.‚Äôs only direct involvement with the Butterfield Overland Mail Company. He stated ‚ÄúWells Fargo may have run a ‚Äòtrunk route‚Äô off the Butterfield [Trail] in LA [Los Angeles] but it was NOT Butterfield per se.‚ÄùButterfield Overland Trail Friends, October 16, 2014. The line was very expensive and cost $3,500,000 to build and maintain.Waddell F. Smith, The Smoke Signal, The Tucson Corral of the Westerners, No. 17, Spring 1868, Tucson, Arizona, p. 150. Some of the money was borrowed from the banks of express companies such as Adams Express and Wells, Fargo & Co. Express. William B. Dinsmore, who was also president of Adams Express Co., was the second largest stockholder and was Vice President of Butterfield‚Äôs Overland Mail Company. The largest lender may have been Wells, Fargo & Co. Express, since they were the most successful of the express companies. Ownership of the six-year contract for John Butterfield‚Äôs Overland Mail Company was by stockholders only and therefore any ownership was as stated on the stock certificates. Nowhere in the six-year contract, with all its various changes from 1858 to 1864, is the name of Wells, Fargo & Co. to be seen.Contract with the Overland Mail Company, Letter from The Postmaster General, 46th Congress, 3d Session, Senate, Ex. Doc. No. 21. This government document is thirty-seven pages long for the six-year contract made with John Butterfield and includes all the variations made to the contract. It should also be noted that the Pony Express was made part of the Overland Mail Company contract on March 12, 1861. > ‚ÄúAlthough Wells Fargo & Company shared board members with several stagecoach > companies, it was not primarily in the stagecoach business, it was, first > and foremost, an express company, concerned with expediting the shipment of > almost anything between a paying sender and an intended addressee.Ken > Wheeling, Overland Journal, Winter 2005-2006.

This book is reprinted from the original 1967 edition by Thomas Y. Crowell Company, New York. Noel M. Loomis, Wells Fargo, Clarkson N. Potter, Inc., New York, 1968. W. Turrentine Jackson, The California Historical Society Quarterly, Vol. XLV, No. 4, December 1966, A New Look at Wells Fargo, Stagecoaches and the Pony Express, pp. 291-324. Jackson was a paid consultant for Wells, Fargo & Co. In 1968 a complete and clear rebuttal was made by Waddell F. Smith, the grandson of one of the founders of the Pony Express, to Jackson‚Äôs article stating that there was no ownership by Wells, Fargo & Co. of the Overland Mail Company. Waddell F. Smith, The Smoke Signal, The Tucson Corral of the Westerners, No. 17, Spring 1868, Tucson, Arizona. One of these was Ralph Moody even though he stated in his book Stagecoach West: > ‚ÄúNo conclusive evidence has been ever discovered to prove that Wells, Fargo > & Co. had outright ownership of the Overland Mail Company and the Pioneer > Stage Line on or before July 1, 1861, the date on which the overland mail > contract was transferred to the central line.‚ÄùIbid, Stagecoach West, p. 205. It wasn‚Äôt until 1867, five years after Butterfield ceased operations on the Southern Overland Trail, that Wells, Fargo & Co. entered the staging business when they scraped off the name on the transom rails of the Pioneer Stage Line and added their own. The line was operating on the western section of the Central Overland Trail.Ibid, Overland Journal, pp. 143-145. Legacy His son, Daniel Adams Butterfield (1831 ‚Äì 1901), was a Union General in the American Civil War, and Assistant U.S. Treasurer. Daniel is credited with creating the bugle call \\"Taps\\", a variation of a bugle call known as the \\"Scott Tattoo\\", in 1862.

These different understandings often inform each other. The Buddhist philosopher, Herbert V. G√ºnther, has stated: > What we call 'body' and 'mind' are mere abstractions from an identity > experience that cannot be reduced to the one or the other abstraction, nor > can it be hypostatized into some sort of thing without falsifying its very > being. Modern Western cultures inherited the concept of Cartesian dualism which isn't evident in many other cultures. As a result of multiculturalism and globalization, the bodymind philosophies found in other cultures, such as in Navajo and Tibetan societies, have been integrated into the bodymind concept adopted by the Western New Age movement. Vajrayana and Zen Buddhism In Vajrayana, Mahayana, Theravada and Zen Buddhism the concept of bodymind, or namarupa, is key. In Vajrayana, namarupa is informed by the related doctrines of heartmind and Yogachara's mindstream. Within these traditions, Bodymind is held as a continu√ºm and field phenomenon. Arpaia and Rapgay discuss the connection of mindbody in the eighth chapter of their book, Tibetan Wisdom for Modern Life , entitled \\"Health: strengthening the mind-body connection\\". David E. Shaner, PhD, coined the compound term \\"bodymind\\" in his thesis work at the University of Hawai'i, \\"The Bodymind Experience in Japanese Buddhism\\", which he defended in 1979 and published in 1985.[2] Shaner translated the term ÂøÉË∫´Áµ±‰∏ÄÂêàÊ∞£ÈÅì, Shinshintouitsu Aikid≈ç.

Later in the first quarter, kicker Mike Allen got Wisconsin on the board with a 46-yard field goal, to tie the game, 3‚Äì3.

In the third quarter, Greene found Jeremy Thomas for a 24-yard touchdown to extend the lead to 17‚Äì6. Running back Thomas Brown rushed 29 yards for a touchdown, to increase Georgia's lead to 24‚Äì6 at the end of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Quarterback John Stocco found wide receiver Darrin Charles for a 19-yard touchdown pass to trim the lead to 24‚Äì13. With Georgia trying to run out the clock, David Greene threw an interception that was returned by Andy Crooks for 11 yards, for a Wisconsin touchdown. The ensuing two-point conversion attempt succeeded, and Wisconsin now trailed by only three points, 24‚Äì21. Their ensuing onside kick attempt failed, but there was still time left. Georgia eventually converted a fourth-and-one on Wisconsin's 15-yard line, which allowed the Bulldogs to run out the clock and secure the victory.

Family Strutt was the son of Hon. Arthur Strutt and Alice Mary Elizabeth Philips de Lisle. His paternal grandfather was Edward Strutt, 1st Baron Belper. On 10 October 1905 he married Florence Nina, daughter of John Robert Hollond MP DL, of Wonham, Bampton, Devon. They had no children.thePeerage.com ‚Äì Person Page 7639 Education and military life Strutt was educated at Beaumont College, Windsor, then at Christ Church, Oxford, and the University of Innsbruck. He joined the 3rd (Militia) Battalion of the Royal Scots (Lothian Regiment) as a lieutenant, and was promoted to captain on 20 February 1900. The battalion was embodied in late December 1899 for service during the Second Boer War, and in early March 1900 left Queenstown on the SS Oriental for South Africa. Strutt left Cape Town for the United Kingdom with most of the battalion in May 1902, shortly before the end of the war. He later served in the First World War, gaining many decorations and attaining the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the Royal Scots. Strutt commanded a detachment of soldiers from the Honourable Artillery Company that escorted the family of Charles I, the last Austro-Hungarian Emperor-King, to safety in Switzerland in 1919, after having served as the family's protector at Eckartsau on the personal initiative of King George V.Gordon Brook-Shepherd, Uncrowned Emperor ‚Äì The Life and Times of Otto von Habsburg, Hambledon Continuum, London 2003. .Gordon Brook-Shepherd, The Last Habsburg, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London 1968. .

Seat of League of Nations High Commissioner for the Free City of Danzig In 1920 Strutt was appointed Allied High Commissioner of the League of Nations in Gda≈Ñsk which under the auspices of the League was known then as the Free City of Danzig (). Alpinism Strutt had numerous mountaineering expeditions to Tyrol, √ñtztal, the Stubai Alps and the Karwendel range. From 1892 the family employed Beatrice Tomasson as a governess. Despite Tommason being fifteen years older than Strutt the family believed they were romantically involved. Tomasson became a member of the Austrian Alpine Club in 1893 and began to attempt major climbs in the Dolomites from 1896 onwards. Strutt was climbing leader and deputy to expedition leader C. G. Bruce on the 1922 British expedition to Mount Everest that included George Finch and George Mallory. Strutt proved to be an unpopular member of the party, being thought of as 'pompous and pontificating'. The expedition was called off when an avalanche killed seven Sherpa climbers. Strutt was editor of the Alpine Journal from 1927‚Äì37, these being the years ‚Äì according to Alan Hankinson ‚Äì in which 'the Alpine Club [...] had declined into a stuffy, snobbish, backward- looking institution.' Hankinson added: As editor, Strutt published a number of attacks on what he saw as the insidious modern trends in mountaineering, more often than not on the part of the Germans. Although Strutt had words of praise for those climbers (on expeditions to peaks such as Kangchenjunga and Nanga Parbat) whom he perceived as climbing in the classical tradition ‚Äì 'We yield to no one in admiration for the German overseas parties led by Rickmers, Bauer, Borchers, Merkl, and others. The modesty of these parties have been excelled only by their skill'E. L. Strutt, 'A Superiority Complex', in Mirrors in the Cliffs, ed. J. Perrin, London: Diadem, 1983, p. 437 Daniel Anker notes in this context, 'The German attempts on Nanga Parbat were, during the same period, every bit as deadly as those on the Eiger, yet the Alpine Journal maintained a serious tone in its accounts of them. The reason is that Nanga Parbat was considered by the British to be an interesting mountaineering problem.' Eiger: the Vertical Arena, Seattle: The Mountaineers, 2000, pp. 21‚Äì2 ‚Äì he had a different reaction to climbers using modern tactics in the Alps. He continued in this article from the 1935 Alpine Journal: The trend towards climbing (and descending) the great peaks at great speed also disgusted Strutt. On hearing of an American who had hired a guide to take him up and down the Matterhorn in five hours, Strutt commented that this was the kind of crime 'for which the death penalty is inadequate'.Strutt quoted in Claire Engel, Mountaineering in the Alps, London: George Allen and Unwin, 1971, p. 198 The north face of the Eiger The ongoing attempts on the north face of the Eiger (the Eigerwand) ‚Äì which had thus far resisted all efforts, and had taken the lives of six German and Austrian climbers ‚Äì were a particular object of his disdain, provoking his most notorious outburst (in his 1938 Presidential Valedictory Address to the Alpine Club, just before the first successful ascent by Anderl Heckmair and party): Decorations * Queen's South Africa Medal and four clasps, King's South Africa Medal and two clasps (Second Boer War) * Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in 1918 * Chevalier, Order of Leopold (Belgium) * Chevalier, Order of Romania * Croix de Guerre (Belgium) * Croix de Guerre (France) with four palms * Officer, L√©gion d'honneur * Commander, Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1919 * Mentioned in despatches four times Bibliography * T.

He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to hairdressing. Carbosiero joins a select list of hairdressers and List of British Italians to be recognised with the award. Career Carbosiero started his career in the early 1980s, serving his apprenticeship under Neville Tucker and Daniel Hersheson at their Neville Daniel salon in New Cavendish Street, London. By 1985, he had opened his own salon called GeraldLino with business partner, Gerald Monaghan in nearby Blandford Street. In the years of salon ownership, Carbosiero forged a liaison with the 80s pop management team of Stock Aitken Waterman. Through the record company, he began to become notable in the music, television and fashion industries, working with artists such as Jason Donovan, who invited him to appear (as a dustman) in the video for his single \\"When You Come Back To Me\\", and Kylie Minogue, for whom he created the look on the cover of her debut album Kylie. In 1993 he began working at the Daniel Galvin salon and has since worked backstage on a variety of films, TV shows, concerts, and West End shows. He was the head stylist for all of the contestants who appeared on the first three series of The X Factor and helped train Amanda Holden for her role in the BBC1 TV drama series about life in a hair salon, Cutting It. In 2008, Lino became the personal hairdresser to the Right Honourable David Cameron and his wife Samantha, and has continued as such since Cameron became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 2010. Following renewed media interest in early 2014, Lino revealed that this style change was simply due to chance. Carbosiero was drafted in to tend the locks of First Lady of the United States Melania Trump for the state visit with her husband Donald Trump. Lino has been the global spokesperson for Avon International's hair care range and Style Director for both Brylcreem and Laross Hair Extensions. He also launched his own range of hair extensions with Annabelle's Wigs. Carbosiero is also an Ambassador for the ARKS UK Charity and the Hairdressing Council. Media work Carbosiero previously had his own weekly hairdressing column in The Sun, a monthly column in EasyJet Magazine, and gave hairdressing tips and advice to Candis Magazine and Hello Magazine. He also works with Hilary Alexander on the monthly make over page for The Daily Telegraph. He also featured in the successful Yummy Mummy Survival Guide Book by Liz Frazer, whilst the Kelly Osbourne book Fierce features a section of \\"Hair do's and Hair Don'ts\\" written by Lino. In 2008 Lino appeared in Britain's Missing Top Model on BBC Three whilst ITV's This Morning used him for a make-over slot on a segment called Bus Pass Beauty.

After the Poles, in the second half of the 16th century, came shepherds from Wallachia, who in the course of the time assimilated with Polish population. In 1772 (see Partitions of Poland) Mil√≥wka was annexed by the Austrian Empire, and became part of the province of Galicia, where it remained until late 1918.

The film is based on true events. It is one of the most important Soviet films of the 1960s. It won the Crystal Globe Award in 1962. Plot summary Two young physicists and old friends ‚Äî the possessed experimental physicist Dmitri Gusev and the skeptical theoretical physicist Ilya Kulikov ‚Äî conduct nuclear studies at a research institute in Siberia. Dmitri leads the research started by his teacher Sintsov, who has received a deadly dose of radiation as a result of an experiment. Dmitri has also been irradiated. Doctors warn him that further irradiation might kill him as well. Meanwhile, his friend Ilya and Lyolya, a love interest of Dmitri, have developed a romantic relationship. The enamoured couple is getting prepared for the wedding and looking for an opportunity to inform Dmitri. When they finally meet, Dmitri already suspects Lyolya and Ilya and treats them coldly. Caught up in self-contradictions, Lyolya tries to understand Dmitri's true feelings for her, only to learn the terrible diagnosis. Realizing that she still loves Dmitri, Lyolya cancels the wedding to Ilya in order to marry Dmitri. Despite the health warnings, Dmitri continues with his experiments in fusion power. After a number of failures, he turns to Ilya for help. Whilst carrying out of the experiment successfully, Dmitri receives a new radiation dose. He tries to hide this fact from everyone, including his wife Lyolya who is misinterpreting his sudden isolation, though the truth eventually rises to the surface. The research work has been continued by Ilya. Dmitri's health is getting worse, but he decides to fight his illness to the end and agrees to undergo bone marrow transplantation. Production The film's working title was 365 Days. Mikhail Romm assembled a team of people with whom he had never previously worked before. Popular actors Yury Yakovlev and Alexey Batalov were hired for the main roles. Before the filming started, Yakovlev was hospitalized and had to be replaced with Innokenty Smoktunovsky. For the main female part a young and little-known actress Tatyana Lavrova of the Sovremennik Theatre was invited. The role of Lyolya was Tatiana‚Äôs best known role in her film career, later she mainly devoted herself to the theater. The screenplay was written by Romm jointly with Khrabrovitsky. The cinematographer of the film was a newcomer German Lavrov. In many respects, the picture became a new word in the Soviet cinema. Experts have noted an unusual interpretation of the theme song and sound engineering - in fact there is almost no music, there is only a certain sound accompaniment of the technological sense. The sets of the film were also innovative. The filming took 6 months. The premiere was on the 5th of March 1962 at the Rossiya Theatre in Moscow. 7 actors participated in the film who were later awarded the title of People's Artist of the USSR: Batalov (1976), Smoktunovsky (1974), Plotnikov (1966), Blinnikov (1963), Gerdt (1990), Evstigneev (1983), Durov (1990). The director Mikhail Romm became the People's Artist of the USSR in 1950. Alexey Batalov witnessed that numerous dark parts which were conceived by the authors were removed from the film per censorship requirements. As a result, an episode was removed where Gusev visits his mother's grave, a possible indication that in the finale the disease leads to Gusev becoming blind.

Auspop, formerly known as SouthPop, champions Austin artists who were mainly responsible for \\"weird\\" Austin. History and mission SouthPop was formally established in 2005 to collect and display concert posters by a group of artist known as the Armadillo Art Squad who came together around the Armadillo World Headquarters. It was born from a community art collective known as the South Austin Museum of Popular Culture which had coalesced in 2004 around the private files of Henry Gonzalez. The collections expanded to include other live music venues of the 1970s including Threadgills, the Vulcan Gas Company, the Austin Opry House, and Antone's. Eventually the purpose of SouthPop was to preserve the legacy of Austin's counterculture and popular arts through exhibitions, collection, and scholarship. The center has evolved to become a collecting and exhibiting center for photography, prints, and non-traditional art and has widened the visibility of the Austin cultural scene. The South Austin Museum of Popular Culture is an independent resource available to those who want to learn more about the Austin's cultural history and is not supported by any government institution. Armadillo Art Squad An extensive 1997 review of the Armadillo Art Squad named many of its artists and cartoonists (often one and the same), including Gilbert Shelton, Jim Franklin, Guy Juke, Kerry Awn, Michael E. Arth, Ken Featherston, Henry Gonzales, Danny Garrett, Sam Yeates, Micael Priest, Gary McIlhenny, and Jack Jaxon. This group of local Austin artists designed posters and handbills for Eddie Wilson's Armadillo World Headquarters at a time when the Austin music scene was fueled by the Cosmic Cowboy movement. Memorial Wall Southpop's outdoor memorial, 'Wall of Fame', as Austin humorist John Kelso calls it, has photos of over 150 people. It honors them for their contribution to Austin's creative scene. The outdoor wall includes both the famous and the obscure, from Bill Hicks, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Janis Joplin to Bill Livingood, Bud Shrake, and Poodie Locke, Willie Nelson's stage manager. Name changes Originally named the South Austin Museum of Popular Culture and was referred to as SAMOPC. In 2010 it was renamed the South Austin Popular Culture Center, and has since become known locally as SouthPop. Subsequently the name has been changed back to South Austin Museum of Popular Culture.https://www.facebook.com/SouthPopATX/ or https://www.southpop.org/ In September 2019 Leea Mechling, the executive director announced that the name is changing to Austin Museum of Popular Culture (AusPop) and that the museum will relocate to a new space on North Lamar behind Threadgill‚Äôs restaurant.

The programme is unique among other similar makeover shows in that it never encourages participants to undergo cosmetic surgery or lose weight. The US format premiered on Lifetime Television in 2008 with Carson Kressley hosting, it was the #1 Unscripted Show on the network at the time. On 27 June 2019, it was announced that the show would be revived by Really with Gok Wan returning as host. This would be the channel's first commission since its acquisition by Discovery.  Format  The format of the show is based on activities designed to build a woman's self-esteem and self-confidence. These include photographing the woman naked and then displaying a very large picture of the woman's body in a public place, such as projected onto the side of a building or on the side of a van, and asking passers-by what they think of them. Viewers typically respond very positively, which builds the woman's self- esteem. Wan burns the woman's current underwear and then replaces it with more flattering underwear, including \\"tummy tuck pants\\". At the end of each episode, Wan asks the woman to walk down the modeling catwalk showing her new nude look to family and friends. In more recent episodes, Wan has used a variety of very personal tactics designed to encourage women to love their bodies and feel sexy. He has had women pose naked in London shop windows, stopped women on the street and asked if they have Lady Lines, published the image of a semi-naked woman on the front of a fake newspaper titled Naked News, and then handed the newspaper out on a busy London street. At the end of each catwalk show, the woman is encouraged to strip naked on stage to show how far they had come in terms of body confidence.  Catchphrases  Wan's favourite and most famous catchphrases include \\"bangers\\", which is slang for breasts, and \\"gorgeous\\", often calling the women participating in the show \\"girlfriend\\". Many of his other catchphrases are puns on his name, such as \\"Gok shock\\" and \\"fairy Gok mother\\". In his most recent series, Wan has introduced a new feature aimed at giving style and beauty advice to men, which he calls \\"Wan for the boys\\".

In Works and Days, Hesiod (without mentioning Homer) claims he won a poetry contest, receiving as the prize a tripod, which he dedicated to the Muses of Mount Helicon. A tripod, believed to be Hesiod's dedication-offering, was still being shown to tourists visiting Mount Helicon and its sacred grove of the Muses in Pausanias' day, but has since vanished.Pausanias, Description of Greece ix.31.3. Manuscripts The Certamen itself is clearly of the second century A.D., for it mentions Hadrian (line 33). Friedrich Nietzsche deducedNietzsche, \\"Die Florentinischer Tractat √ºber Homer und Hesiod\\", in Rhetorica (Rheinisches museum f√ºr philologie) 25 (1870:528-40) and 28 (1873:211-49). that it must have an earlier precedent in some form, and argued that it derived from the sophist Alcidamas' Mouseion, written in the fourth century B.C. Three fragmentary papyri discovered since have confirmed his view.Koniaris 1971, Renehan 1971, Mandilaras 1992. One dates from the third century B.C.,Flinders Petrie, Papyri, ed. Mahaffy, 1891, pl. xxv. one from the second century B.C. First published by B. Mandilaras,Platon 42 (1990) 45-51. (both of these contain versions of the text largely agreeing with the Hadrianic version) and one, identified in a colophon text as the ending of Alcidamas, On Homer (University of Michigan Pap. 2754)Winter, J. G., \\"A New Fragment on the Life of Homer' Transactions of the American Philological Association 56 (1925) 120-129 ). from the 2nd or 3rd century AD. That the story derives in part from the classical period or earlier (and before the Mouseion) has been shown most clearlyThe evidence for a 5th-century version of Certamen is summarised by N.J. Richardson, \\"The contest of Homer and Hesiod and Alcidamas' Mouseion\\", The Classical Quarterly New Series 31 (1981:1-10). by two lines from its riddle passage that appear in Aristophanes' Peacelines 1282-83. \\"It does seem easier to suppose that Aristophanes was quoting a pre-existing text of the Certamen than that Alcidamas appropriated the lines from Aristophanes for a Certamen-like story in his Mouseion,\\" R.M. Rosen observes.Ralph Mark Rosen. \\"Aristophanes' Frogs and the Contest of Homer and Hesiod\\", Transactions of the American Philological Association 134.2, Autumn 2004:295-322. (on-line text) The more profound influences of some version of the Contest on Aristophanes' The Frogs has been traced by Rosen, who notes the clearly traditional organising principle of the contest of wits (sophias), often involving riddling tests.  Content  The site of the contest is Chalcis, in Euboea. Hesiod tells (Works and Days lines 650‚Äì662) that the only time he took passage in a ship was when he went from Aulis to Chalcis, to take part in the funeral games for Amphidamas, a noble of Chalcis. Hesiod was victorious; he dedicated the prize, a bronze tripod, to the Muses at Helicon.The Contest is adduced by Richard Hunter, (The Shadow of Callimachus: Studies in the Reception of Hellenistic Poetry at Rome (Cambridge University Press) 2006:18) as an expression of the cultural conditions behind the conspicuous absence of Homer at Helicon. There is no mention of Homer. In Certamen Homeri et Hesiodi the winning passage that Hesiod selects is the passage from Works and Days that begins, \\"When the Pleiades arise...\\" The judge, who is the brother of the late Amphidamas, awards the prize to Hesiod. The relative value of Homer and Hesiod is established in the poem by the relative value of their subject matter to the polis, the community: Hesiod's work on agriculture and peace is pronounced of more value than Homer's tales of war and slaughter. The work also preserves 17 epigrams attributed to Homer. Three of these epigrams (epigrams III, XIII and XVII) are also preserved in the Contest of Homer and Hesiod and epigram I is found in a few manuscripts of the Homeric Hymns.Hesiod; Homer; Evelyn-White, Hugh G. (Hugh Gerard), d. 1924 Hesiod, the Homeric hymns, and Homerica London : W. Heinemann ; New York : Putnam p.467 The short textapproximately 338 lines. begins with brief sketches of the poets' lives, including their parentage and birth. It then describes the contest itself, which consists of challenges and riddles that Hesiod poses, to which Homer improvises masterfully, to the applause of the on-lookers, followed by their recitation of what they considered their best passage and the awarding of the tripod to Hesiod; this takes up about half the text and is followed by accounts of the circumstances of their deaths. Modern editions One modern edition of the Greek text is in volume 5 of T.W. Allen's Oxford Classical Text of Homer (1912). An edition with Greek text and English translation (on facing pages) by Hugh Evelyn-White was published in 1914 as part of the Loeb Classical Library volume titled Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns and Homerica, and is now in the public domain and available online.See References section for links.

MUHBA Orsini bomb The Orsini bomb was a terrorist improvised explosive device built by and named after Felice Orsini and used as a hand grenade on 14 January 1858 in an unsuccessful attack on Napoleon the Third. The weapons were somewhat commonly used by anarchists in the latter half of the 19th century in Europe, and surplus bombs were also used by the Confederacy during the American Civil War. The design is reminiscent of modern impact fused grenades, such as the Soviet RGO hand grenades. Orsini bombs were designed to remove ‚Äúthe uncertainty of slow burning fused weapons\\". The bomb had a unique design for its time, and instead of having a fuse or timer, the bomb had numerous pins around it. The pins were filled with mercury fulminate and when the pins sensed contact on any angle with an object, it would immediately trigger the detonation. The bomb was designed by Felice Orsini, an Italian exile living in England, while the casing of the bomb was made by English gunmaker Joseph Taylor. The bomb was designed and created in Birmingham, England, but was tested by Taylor in Sheffield and Devon. After thorough testing, Taylor provided the bomb to Orsini and smuggled them into France disguised as ‚Äúgas machinery.‚Äù Taylor later claimed that he thought the device was a genuine piece of explosive ordnance of a novel design. The bomb was originally created in an attempt to kill Napoleon III in 1858. This act and the design of the bombs may have been inspired by a previous attempt to kill Napoleon I in 1800 with an improvised explosive. Orsini created 12 bombs for the plot. The plan was that he and three other accomplices would throw four bombs at the Emperor when he emerged from his carriage, but they all missed their targets. However, they did still manage to kill 10 and wound 157. A description of the plot written by a participant was found and said: ‚ÄúMy grenade contained 4 pounds of powder. All the conspirators had their respective posts previously assigned to them. Four hand-grenades were to be thrown by Gomez, myself, Orsini, and Pieri, respectively. ‚Ä¶ throwing my grenade right under the fore part of the carriage, and dropping myself among some dead horses and struggling men, I watched the effects of the explosion. The horses and the driver were instantly killed[.]‚Äù The Orsini bomb was later often used by anarchists when they could not obtain dynamite in several plots, including an attack at Rossini's Opera William Tell at Liceu Theater in 1893 by anarchist Santiago Salvador; resulting in the death of 20 people and wounding 30, though only one of the bombs detonated. One of the unexploded bombs was preserved at the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA) until it was displayed at the Van Gogh Museum in 2007 in an exhibit on late 19th century Barcelona. Coincidentally, the bombs were thrown into the audience during the play ‚ÄúWilliam Tell‚Äù which is the same play that the Emperor Napoleon III and his wife were on their way to during the attempt on their life by Orsini over 35 years earlier. An Orsini bomb was also once dug up in Arkansas in the 1950s. It is said to have been used during the Civil War by the Confederacy. Many types of improvised grenades were used in the Civil War and the Orsini bomb was well known to be copied or acquired from French surplus designs.

It is listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a Grade II* listed building. Originally built for the Winstanley family, the building is one of only three Tudor buildings in the Borough. History The hall was built in the 1560s for the Winstanley family of Winstanley; the Winstanley family were lords of the manor since at least 1252 and may have been responsible for building the moat on the site. The Winstanleys owned the hall until 1596, when the estate was sold to James Bankes, a London goldsmith and banker. Winstanley Hall has three storeys and has a date stone with a date of 1584, but this is not in situ so may not provide an accurate date for the construction of the house. Extra blocks were added in the 17th and 18th centuries. Further and extensive alterations were made in 1811-19 by Lewis Wyatt in a Jacobean style. He moved the entrance to the left flank of the hall and replacing the original entrance with a window. The final additions to the hall were made in 1843 when an extra wing was added. To the south, on lands belonging to the hall, is a small stone building which was used to house bears that provided entertainment for the hall's guests. The Winstanley Family also owned the Braunstone Hall estate in Leicestershire. The Bankes family retained ownership of the hall until the 21st century when it was sold for private development. The hall had been kept in good condition until the 1960s when the family moved out; it was last occupied in the 1980s. As the building decayed and the cost of maintaining Winstanley Hall was too much for the family, and was sold on in 2000 with 10 acres of land. It has been reported that the new owner intended to develop the hall into private flats, and that refurbishment was held up due to problems with planning permission, although it has also been reported that no application for planning permission has been submitted. The interior is now in some disrepair. Historic England have the hall on the Heritage at Risk register listing it in 2019 as in very bad condition and in the highest category of risk of further deterioration. Access The building is currently owned and controlled by Dorbcrest Homes.

Before a court finds a defendant guilty of a criminal offense, the prosecution must present evidence that, even when opposed by any evidence the defense may choose , is credible and sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed each element of the particular crime charged. The component parts that make up any particular crime vary depending on the crime. The basic components of an offense are listed below; generally, each element of an offense falls into one or another of these categories. At common law, conduct could not be considered criminal unless a defendant possessed some level of intentioneither purpose, knowledge, or recklessnesswith regard to both the nature of his alleged conduct and the existence of the factual circumstances under which the law considered that conduct criminal. However, for some legislatively enacted crimes, the most notable example being statutory rape, a defendant need not have had any degree of belief or willful disregard as to the existence of certain factual circumstances (such as the age of the accuser) that rendered his conduct criminal; such crimes are known as strict liability offenses. Mental state (Mens rea) Mens rea refers to the crime's mental elements of the defendant's intent. This is a necessary element‚Äîthat is, the criminal act must be voluntary or purposeful. Mens rea is the mental intention (mental fault), or the defendant's state of mind at the time of the offense, sometimes called the guilty mind. It stems from the ancient maxim of obscure origin, \\"actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit reas\\" that is translated as \\"the act is not guilty unless the mind is guilty.\\" For example, the mens rea of aggravated battery is the intention to do serious bodily harm. Mens rea is almost always a necessary component in order to prove that a criminal act has been committed. Mens rea varies depending on the offense. For murder, the mental element requires the defendant acted with \\"malice aforethought\\". Others may require proof the act was committed with such mental elements such as \\"knowingly\\" or \\"willfulness\\" or \\"recklessness\\". Arson requires an intent to commit a forbidden act, while others such as murder require an intent to produce a forbidden result. Motive, the reason the act was committed, is not the same as mens rea and the law is not concerned with motive. Although most legal systems recognize the importance of the guilty mind, or mens rea, exactly what is meant by this concept varies. The American Law Institute's Model Penal Code has reduced the mental states to four. In general, guilt can be attributed to an individual who acts \\"purposely,\\" \\"knowingly,\\" \\"recklessly,\\" or \\"negligently.\\" Together or in combination, these four attributes seem basically effective in dealing with most of the common mens rea issues. Conduct (Actus reus) All crimes require actus reus. That is, a criminal act or an unlawful omission of an act, must have occurred. A person cannot be punished for thinking criminal thought. This element is based on the problem of standards of proof. How can another person's thoughts be determined and how can criminal thoughts be differentiated from idle thoughts? Further, the law's purview is not to punish criminal ideas but to punish those who act upon those ideas voluntarily. Unlike thoughts, words can be considered acts in criminal law. For example, threats, perjury, conspiracy, and solicitation are offenses in which words can constitute the element of actus reus. The omission of an act can also constitute the basis for criminal liability. Concurrence In general, mens rea and actus reus must occur at the same time‚Äîthat is, the criminal intent must precede or coexist with the criminal act, or in some way activate the act. The necessary mens rea may not continually be present until the forbidden act is committed, as long as it activated the conduct that produced the criminal act. However, for criminal liability to occur, there must be either overt and voluntary action.// Causation Many crimes include an element that actual harm must occur‚Äîin other words, causation must be proved. For example, homicide requires a killing, aggravated battery requires serious bodily injury and without those respective outcomes, those respective crimes would not be committed. A causal relationship between conduct and result is demonstrated if the act would not have happened without direct participation of the offender. Causation is complex to prove. The act may be a \\"necessary but not sufficient\\" cause of the criminal harm. Intervening events may have occurred in between the act and the result. Therefore, the cause of the act and the forbidden result must be \\"proximate\\", or near in time.

Starting as a book illustrator, he specialized in animal subjects and established an international reputation as a wildlife artist. In 1960 Driscoll painted three large murals in the London Zoo. A year later he illustrated the inaugural brochure for the World Wildlife Fund. By the mid-1960s Barry's work was appearing regularly in the national press, and he had his own Sunday Express wildlife column. In 1970 Time-Life commissioned him to do a series of paintings of fauna in Arizona. Early years Born in Camberwell, Driscoll was one of four sons of a printer on the Daily Express. During World War II his family moved to Shropshire, where, truant from school, the young Driscoll roamed the countryside and began making sketches from nature. He was a keen reader, and in particular cherished Gilbert White's Natural History of Selborne. Driscoll was conscripted into the army, and was commissioned into the Royal Army Service Corps in 1947. He served as a subaltern in India, where he \\"lost\\" the convoy of which he was in charge, and was severely reprimanded. He later served in the Palestine Mandate, Egypt, and Northern Ireland. In 1948 he enrolled at St Martin's School of Art on the British equivalent of the GI Bill. After he graduated from St Martin's with a national diploma in design, he won a place at the Royal College of Art. He married Kiffi Bowerley, a fellow St Martin's student, in 1951; they had three children (one of whom, Guy, died in 1996). They divorced in 1979. He launched himself on a career as an illustrator, which stretched on into the 1970s and included many national press campaigns; authors he collaborated included the famous naturalist Gerald Durrell and the Hans Christian Andersen Awardee Ren√© Guillot. By 1982 he became a sculptor, enjoying the technique of working in a three-dimensional medium. He declared that sculpture was easy when compared with painting. He made many trips to Italy to oversee his sculptures, forged by the Mariani foundry at Pietrasanta. His son, Falcon, married an Italian woman, Sabina Coppola, in 2001, further copper-fastening Barry Driscoll's love of Italy. Exhibitions Driscoll was under less pressure to exhibit than many other artists. He did show with the Society of Wildlife Artists (SWLA), of which he was a member, and with the Phoenix Gallery in Lavenham, Suffolk, although he was not represented by any major commercial gallery. In 2002, he was the principal sculptor in a wildlife show of two- and three-dimensional works which originated at the Accademia Nazionale d'Arte Antica e Moderna in Turin, Italy. It travelled then to Barcelona, then back to the Society of Wildlife Artists (SWLA) in England. Death He died of cancer, aged 79, and was survived by his former wife, Kiffi; his children, Pippa and Falcon, and by Leila Kooros, Driscoll's later partner in life.

Several prominent theologians, scholars, business leaders, and media personalities from a variety of different backgrounds and beliefs have endorsed Trust in the Lord: Reflections of Jesus Christ. Deen and his wife Kristin are the parents of nine children. They live in Abita Springs, Louisiana. Books Deen Kemsley is the author of Trust in the Lord: Reflections of Jesus Christ. Many prominent business leaders and others have endorsed his book. The following review came from Publisher's Weekly: Kemsley, an accounting professor at Tulane University in New Orleans, posits that ‚Äúthe journey to know Christ is the journey to know the deepest, best element of ourselves.‚Äù In this brief book, Kemsley draws on personal experiences and anecdotes to demonstrate how he came to know Christ. His experiences are not miraculous or earth-shattering, but ordinary and real: seeing Christ reflected in a newborn, for example, or an act of service. As a father of nine children, many of these acts of service are unseen and unthanked late-night feedings or diaper changes; though they did not seem significant at the time, Kemsley now realizes that such simple deeds mean everything. Although Kemsley is a Mormon and the book is from an LDS publisher, it has a deeply ecumenical tone. The focus throughout is on knowing and loving Christ, not emphasizing denominational differences. Although it lacks the poetic nature of some other memoirish devotional books of this type, such as The Quantity of a Hazelnut, there is a simple honesty to this volume that makes it refreshing and quietly lovely.

Presentation Frequently patients will have reduced stereopsis, large accommodative lag on dynamic retinoscopy, and a reduced visual field (tubular or spiral field). Streff Syndrome was first described in 1962 by an optometrist, Dr. John Streff as Non-malingering syndrome. In 1962, Dr. Streff and Dr. Richard Apell expanded the concept to add early adaptive syndrome as a precursor to Streff syndrome. Dr. Streff believed the visual changes were induced by stress from reading. There is dispute on the taxonomy of functional vision defects. Some research indicates that Streff syndrome may be caused by a dysfunction in the magnocellular pathway of the retinal ganglion cells.Nimesh P. The use of frequency doubling technology to determine magnocellular pathway deficiencies. Journal of Behavioral Optometry, Volume 15. Number 2, 2005 These cells are only 10% of the retinal nerve cells and register motion detection. Early Adaptive Syndrome Diagnosis The diagnostic criteria for Streff syndrome are not well established, and the validity of this condition has not been recognized by The American Academy of Ophthalmology, The American Academy of Pediatric Ophthalmology, The American Academy of Optometry or The American academy of Pediatrics. Treatment Most optometrists agree that Streff syndrome is a generalized reduction in visual performance that is not caused by structural damage. It is a disease involving vision distress primarily of the accommodation system. Hans Selye described stress, distress and eustress. It is most common in girls ages 8 to 14. Hand held reading material is often positioned excessively close. Reading aloud shows signs of elevated pitch and stumbling over common words. History of homework avoidance and falling class performance are often present. If the patient is directed to read aloud and +.50 lenses are then used, there is usually a dramatic improvement as observed by patient and parent. Abnormal results on color vision or visual field testing is not uncommon. Visual field often presents as constricted 'tubular' at multiple test distances. The poor visual performance is understood as distress, and treatments are usually to provide the patient with low powered reading glasses. The \\"relaxing\\" nature of reading glasses is believed to reduce the near vision stress and allow normal function. The emotional effects of chronic near vision stress are also reduced. The \\"non-Malingering\\" name is a refutation that the patient is malingering.

In that short, he is nearly convinced by Stymie that ham and eggs can talk and is later pushed down a well by his own dog, Nero. Bailey left the Our Gang series in 1932 at the age of nine. Bailey quietly left the film industry in 1940. Before retiring from his professional acting career at age 17, Bailey appeared in a few movies, including The Big Stampede (1932) with John Wayne, Too Many Parents (1936), and Young Tom Edison (1940) with Mickey Rooney. He graduated from Polytechnic High School in Long Beach, then studied engineering at UCLA but did not graduate. He later earned his state civil engineering license and worked as a civil engineer in Huntington Beach. Death He died of cancer on his 64th birthday.Maltin, Leonard and Bann, Richard W.

Don Juan Macapagal was given the title Maestre de Campo General of the natives Arayat, Candaba and Apalit for his aid in suppressing the Kapampangan Revolt of 1660. He further aided the Spanish crown in suppressing the Pangasinan Revolt of Don Andres Malong in the same year, and the Ilocano Revolt of 1661. Don Juan Macapagal died in 1683. Don Juan Macapagal is a direct ancestor of Philippine Revolutionary General, L√°zaro Macapagal and two former Philippine President Diosdado Macapagal and his daughter, former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.  Ancestry  As one of the requirements of the Spanish authorities when he asked for more privileges to be given to his family he had to show proof of descent from the old Lord of Tondo. In the records, it is shown that his parents were Capitan Don Gonzalo Capulong and Dona Maria Bina; Don Gonzalo Capulong was the son of Don Dionisio Capulong, the eldest son of Don Carlos Lacandola. The signature of Don Dionisio Capulong (c. 1594-1607) was found in the UST archives Libro 22, as published by Alberto Santamar√≠a in his article El ‚ÄúBaybayin‚Äù en el Archivo de Santo Tomas, in Unitas Vol. XVI No. 8, February 1938. Courtesy of Christopher Ray Miller, Ph.D., 2011. He had at least 3 brothers and a sister: Don Juan de Guevarra, Don Miguel Alfonso de Lapira, Don Nicolas Lacandola, and Dona Cathalina Bina. He himself had 5 children, who were Dona Maria Macapagal, Don Francisco Macapagal, Don Pablo Macapagal, Don Salvador Macapagal, and Don Piotenciano Macapagal.  Civilian life  Don Juan Macapagal occupied the post of juez de sementeras of the town Arayat twice before becoming its governor five times in a row. He was also commissioned by the Spanish crown to conduct the supply of silver from Pangasinan through Zambales.  Military career  Don Juan Macapagal started out as a corporal of a squad of native soldiers. He later rose to the rank of sargento capitan of the infantry. Fighting under Spanish captain Sebastian Castelu, Macapagal help pacify the northern frontiers of the province of Pampanga, which then extends all the way up north to Cagayan Valley. He was wounded during the suppression of the Chinese uprising in 1639 and in suppressing a minor Kapampangan uprising in 1641. In 1660, he was given the title Maestre de Campo General of the natives Arayat, Candaba and Apalit for his aid in suppressing the Kapampangan Revolt of 1660. Don Juan Macapagal was also one of the few natives of the Philippines to become an encomendero or a feudal lord under the Spanish crown. In order to gain his support suppressing the Ilocano Revolt of 1661, the Spanish crown awarded him an encomienda or a fief that once belonged to ex-Governor General Don Diego Fajardo y Chacon. The fief was worth 500 ducados of tributes of Negritos from the province of Zambales. After the collapse of the Ilocano Revolt and the execution of 133 of its leaders, Macapagal further received the honor of becoming the Maestre de Campo of the Kapampangan Regiment that guarded Fort Santiago. Because of his outstanding career in the service of the Spanish crown, quite rare for a native of the Philippines during that era, the Spanish authorities decided to revive the special rights and privileges offered by the Spanish crown to Don Carlos Lacandola and all his descendants throughout the province of Pampanga.  Descendants  Don Juan Macapagal is a direct paternal ancestor of former Philippine President Diosdado Macapagal the 9th president of the republic and his daughter, former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, the 14th president of the republic.

In music, such an outside performer is often referred to as a guest artist. In performance art, the terms guest role or guest star are also common, the latter term specifically indicating the guest appearance of a celebrity. The latter is often also credited as special guest star or special musical guest star by some production companies. In pop music and hip-hop, such guests are often referred to as featured artists or featured guests. Such a performer may be annotated in credits or even in song titles by the abbreviation feat. or further abbreviation ft.; or by the word with or abbreviation w/. In a TV series, a guest star is an actor who appears in one or a few episodes (sometimes a story arc). In radio and television shows, a guest star is a guest on the show who is a celebrity or other noteworthy interviewee or commentator. Classical performance arts Guest appearances have been known in theatre, ballet, and classical music for centuries, with guests both from the home country and from abroad. The advent of air transport has made this practice much more practical and global. In classical music, guest orchestra conductors are a common practice. Guest artists should not be confused with touring groups, troupes, orchestra, or even individual artists, although the distinction may be blurred. In the case of touring, their act is independent in itself, while the guest takes part in the act of the resident staff. The duration of involvement of a guest artist may vary, from separate short-term acts with fees per concert to fixed temporary contracts for several seasons. Contemporary music In the early days of the pop music industry the bands were relatively stable units, and while guests were not uncommon, they were seldom given credits on album covers. For example, Eric Clapton was not credited in print for his guitar performance in the release of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" of the Beatles. Gradually guest appearances have become a fully credited staple of music industry. The custom of guest appearance has become especially prominent in rap music, and this influenced rock musicians as well. To have a guest star on a record, a production coordinator must in many cases obtain permission from the record label of the guest and make sure that proper credits are delivered to the host record label. Often credits appear in the form \\"Artist name, courtesy of Record Label name.\\" Reasons for guest appearances A common reason for guest appearances is to draw attention to an act by including a celebrity into it. And vice versa, in the fashion- driven environment of show industry, older stars keep themselves in the limelight by associating themselves with emerging stars. In rap, mutual and multiple guest starring was recognized as a way to diversify the performance. In theatre and ballet, guest appearances diversify actors' repertory and experience under different choreographers, and give more acting opportunities. Even for established stars prestigious overseas engagements increase their home status. Conversely, a guest star benefits the receiving troupe, bringing new inspiration and technique. Audience would welcome diversity, and theatrical business benefits as well: theatre connoisseurs will come to see the same piece with a new star. Drawbacks Commercialization of guests policy may also have negative consequences. Local theatres may limit the growth opportunities for their performers in favor of guests. Sometimes rehearsal times are inadequate to fully integrate the home and guest styles. Touring increases physical load on an actor. It is also associated with multiple stress factors: from jet lags to close calls due to unanticipated travel delays. With a television series, the appearance of a special guest star, or depending on an overabundance of guest star appearances to the frustration and demerit of the regular cast of the series, could mark the moment when a series \\"jumps the shark\\"; that is, a doomed attempt to reverse a decline in popularity.

South Carolina had comfortably defeated Ohio State in the previous year's game, 24‚Äì7. This was the 16th edition of the Outback Bowl. Summary South Carolina scored first, when running back Andrew Pinnock scored on a 1-yard touchdown run to open up a 7‚Äì0 second quarter lead. Quarterback Phil Petty found Brian Scott for a 7-yard touchdown pass, to increase the lead to 14‚Äì0. In the third quarter, Phil Pettey found Andrea Gause for a 50-yard touchdown pass to increase the lead to 20‚Äì0. Andrew Pinnock made the lead seemingly insurmountable when he rushed 10 yards for a touchdown, to put USC up 28‚Äì0, late in the third quarter. Late in the third quarter, quarterback Steve Bellisari rushed 2 yards for a touchdown to put Ohio State on the board, 28‚Äì7. Early in the fourth quarter, he found Darnell Sanders for a 16-yard touchdown pass to trim the margin to 28‚Äì14. Ohio State was driving again with 6 minutes left, when Belisari fumbled a snap at South Carolina's 23-yard line. On the very next play, South Carolina gave it right back, when they fumbled, giving Ohio State new life. Steve Belisari threw a 22-yard pass to Michael Jenkins, and Jonathan Wells took a handoff 1 yard for a touchdown, bringing Ohio State to 28‚Äì21. South Carolina went three-and-out on its next possession, giving the ball to Ohio State. Steve Bellisari engineered a perfect drive, going 5-for-5 passing for 63 yards, including a 9-yard touchdown pass to Sanders with 1:54 left, to tie the game, 28‚Äì28. Ohio State intercepted a South Carolina pass, but Belisari threw an interception, and South Carolina got the ball back in good field position. Daniel Weaver kicked the winning field goal for South Carolina as time expired, giving the Gamecocks a narrow 31‚Äì28 victory.

He was the custodian of the Shrine of Ghous-e-Azam Abdul-Qadir Gilani and has been accepted by many as a reformer of Sufism. Born in Baghdad on 18 June 1932, he traced his lineage by seventeen steps to Abdul-Qadir Gilani and 28 steps to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. In 1956, Al-Gillani left Baghdad and migrated to Pakistan, where he settled permanently in Quetta. He stayed in Pakistan until the end of his life. He went to Germany for medical treatment May 1991, and died the following month. He was buried in Lahore, Pakistan. He had three sons, AlSyed Mahmood Mohyuddin Al-Gillani Al-Qadri, AlSyed Abdul Qadir Jamaluddin Al- Gillani Al-Qadri and AlSyed Muhammad Ziauddin Al-Gillani Al-Qadri, who propagate the teachings of Silsilah e Qadiriyya Tahiria. Background and education Al-Gillani came from an Iraqi family who are the custodians of the mausoleum of Abdul-Qadir Gilani. He is the youngest of the six sons of Naqeeb- ul-Ashraaf Mahmood Hussamuddin al-Gillani al-Qadri. His grandfather, Naqeeb- ul-Ashraaf Abd Al-Rahman Al-Gillani, was the first Prime Minister of Iraq (11 November 1920 ‚Äì 20 November 1922) following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. The current Custodian of the Shrine of Abdul-Qadir Gilani is his elder-brother, Naqib ul Ashraaf AlSyed Ahmed Zafar Al-Gillani, who also served as the ambassador of Iraq in Pakistan from 1978 until 1992. As a child, Al- Gillani would spend the entire night alone in seclusion at the shrine of his ancestor Shaykh Abdul Qadir Gilani. He received his spiritual training and mentoring directly from his father Naqeeb-ul-Ashraaf Alsyed Mahmood Hussamuddin AlGillani Al-Qadri, who was a Sufi and the custodian of the mausoleum of Abdul-Qadir Gilani. Al-Gillani completed his other traditional religious studies at the Madrassa of Syed Sultan Ali in Baghdad, where he studied under scholars of Iraq including Syed Ali Afridi, Qasim alQaise, Khalil ar-Ravee and the Grand Mufti of Iraq. Migration In 1956, Al-Gillani left the city of Baghdad and migrated to Pakistan after receiving spiritual orders from Abdul Qadir Gilani. Al-Gillani first completed 40 days seclusion (Chilla) at the Shrine of the Sufi saint Data Ganj Baksh Ali Hujwiri in Lahore. He then settled in Quetta, where he established the Darbar-e-Ghousia religious school. In honour of Al-Gilani's presence, the government of Balochistan renamed the road to Al-Gillani Road. Darbar-e-Ghousia became the official headquarters of Tariqa Qadiria in the sub-continent and is still run by the sons of Al-Gillani. He received a personal visit from President General Ayub Khan, to welcome him to Pakistan. General Ayub Khan pledged Baith (Oath of Allegiance) in the Qadiriyya Tariqa at the hands of Al-Gillani. Al-Gillani was visited by presidents, politicians, tribal leaders and religious scholars for his prayers, advice and guidance. Pakistani President Zia ul Haq is also known to have had both pledged Baith on Al-Gillani's hands, whilst leaders such as President Saddam Hussein, the Sultan of Brunei, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Mian Nawaz Shareef, would visit him or stay in contact. Life sketch Following in the footsteps of his ancestor Abdul Qadir Gilani, Al-Gillani spent the majority of his life in spiritual retreat (khalwah) and undertaking spiritual exercises (mujƒÅhidah). There is little known about Al-Gillani's life as he would strictly forbid his followers from writing about him. Al-Gillani was very strict in adherence to the laws of Shariah and Tariqah, and until he died he worked tirelessly at propagating the teachings of his ancestor Abdul Qadir Gilani and the other Mashaikh of the Qadiriyya path. He encouraged Islamic Unity and would often speak out against acts which were considered bad innovations and rituals that had crept inside Tassawuf Since a young age, he began touring across the world for propagating Islam and the teachings of Tariqa Qadiria. His visits included Saudi Arabia, India, Bangladesh, United Kingdom, Germany, Egypt, Canada, Indonesia, Singapore, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sri Lanka and the Persian Gulf countries. During Al- Gillani's visit of Ceylon in 1958, he established a care-home in Ceylon for needy and orphaned children. When Al-Gillani visited India in 1952, he visited the city of Bareilly on the invitation of Mustafa Raza Khan Qadri, the Grand Mufti of India. When Al-Gillani reached Bareilly, his car was lifted by the hundreds of thousands of devotees and carried to the residence of Mufti Mustafa Raza Khan.https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak- ash3/644192_455297664553207_231134639_n.jpg It is reported that Mufti Mustafa Raza Khan was so respectful of Al-Gillani that he remained barefoot for the duration of his stay and would stand to serve him. On this occasion, Maulana Mustafa Raza Khan also made several of his family members pledge Baith on the hands of Al-Gillani including the later Grand Mufti of India Mufti Akhtar Raza Khan. During this visit to India, Al-Gillani was visited by the heads of major Sufi Tariqas situated here, including Abdul Qadeer Badayuni Qadri and Muhammad Abdul Qadeer Siddiqi Qadri. In the 1960s, Al-Gillani was invited to the city of Faisalabad by the grand scholar of Pakistan Muhadith e Azam e Pakistan Maulana Sardar Ahmed Qadri to attend the opening ceremony of Jamia Amjadia Rizvia. To welcome Al-Gillani and for his protocol, Maulana Sardar Ahmed Qadri arranged for rolls of white silk to be spread the entire journey from his madrasah to the Railway Station. It is reported that a small spot had been left uncovered near the door of the madrasah and Maulana Sardar Ahmed Qadri kneeled down and used his own beard to sweep this area clean. After a three- storey stage was erected, Al-Gillani was seated at the top and covered in rose petals, and Maulana Sardar Ahmed Qadri and other sheikhs sat beneath his feet on the second storey and Maulana Sardar Ahmed placed his own sons and students on the last level. At the conclusion of the gathering, the crowds were uncontrollable as they rushed in the hope of meeting or touching Al-Gilani so Maulana Sardar Ahmed ordered for a side wall had to be demolished so Al- Gillani could leave safely. Al-Gillani would be invited as main guest to conferences and events, being held both nationally and internationally. These include the International Khatm e Nabuwat Conference held at Minar e Pakistan, the inauguration of Minhaj-ul-Quran International held at Lahore in 1984, the International Minhaj-ul-Quran Conference held at Lahore in 1987, the Al-Hejaz Conference held in London and the historic International Minhaj ul Quran Conference held at Wembley Arena, London in 1988 Marriage and children Al-Gillani married the Princess of Kalat Princess Munawar Sultan ‚Äì the daughter of Khan-e-Azzam Mir Ahmad Yaar Khan of Kalat.

Reading, Pennsylvania: Supergraphics. p. 92. Notable contributors to Crack Comics included Alfred Andriola, George Brenner, Gill Fox, Jack Cole, Paul Gustavson, Klaus Nordling, and Art Pinajian. Quality Comics published 62 issues of Crack Comics from 1940 to 1949; the title was temporarily revived in 2011, when the Next Issue Project published issue \\"#63.\\"  Publication history  Crack Comics #5 (Sept. 1940), first use of the \\"Quality Comic Group\\" logo (to right of \\"COMICS\\"). Cover art by Gill Fox. Crack Comics started off as a monthly anthology of 68 pages, often with as many as 15 features. At first edited by Ed Cronin, much of its material was originally \\"packaged\\" by the Eisner and Iger Studio. \\"The Clock,\\" as well as such newspaper strip reprints as \\"Rube Goldberg's Side Show,\\" \\"Jane Arden,\\" and \\"Ned Brant,\\" moved over from Quality's Feature Comics. The first use of the publisher name \\"Quality Comic Group\\" was on the cover of Crack Comics #5 (Sept. 1940). With issue #26 (Nov. 1942), at the height of World War II, the title dropped down to a bi-monthly schedule due to wartime paper shortages; and with issue #33 (Spring 1944) it became quarterly, also reducing its page- count to 60. It was around this time that publisher Arnold dropped Eisner & Iger as a \\"packager\\" and began producing much of the material in-house. The syndicated newspaper strip reprints \\"Jane Arden\\" and \\"Ned Brant\\" disappeared during this period, as well as such recurring features as \\"Black Condor,\\" \\"Don Q,\\" and \\"Snappy.\\" Cartoonist George Brenner became editor of Crack Comics with issue #31 (Oct. 1943) (Cronin having left the post in Feb. 1942), a few issues before Brenner's character The Clock stopped appearing in the book's pages.Markstein, Don. \\"The Clock,\\" Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

(During this time, the title also gradually reduced its page-count from 60 to 52 to 36.) Brenner stayed on as editor almost to the end, leaving the post after issue #61 (July 1949). = Crack Western and Jonesy = As comics readers' tastes changed in the years following World War II, Quality publisher Arnold responded. Starting with issue #63 (Nov. 1949), Crack became a Western comic, changing its name to Crack Western. This format lasted 22 issues until #84 (May 1953), when the title changed again, to Jonesy. Jonesy published one issue with the old numbering system and then restarted (from #2), publishing until issue #8 (Oct. 1954), when it was cancelled for good. = Next Issue Project = Following the demise of Crack Comics and later the publisher itself, many of Quality Comics' characters lapsed into the public domain.

He had a two season stint as player coach for the Giants from 2015-2017. Williams was one of the most prolific players from British hoops scene, having played over 5600 minutes in the BBL, and scoring over 6200 points for six different teams. The 6ft5 Guard has represented his country with both the England national team and the Great Britain team in his career. Biography=Playing for the Giants= His career started with his hometown team, the Manchester Giants when he was signed professionally in 1994 from their junior teams, making his senior debut against the Greater London Leopards on 25 September 1994. In his first season (1994-95), he helped his team reach the final of the BBL Championship Play- off's and also won the Slam Dunk contest in 1995. Yorick stayed with the Giants for two more seasons before signing for Derby Storm in 1998. Although only staying with Storm for the 1998-99 season, Williams averaged 17.33 PPG in 24 appearances. In 1999, he signed for the Birmingham Bullets, the first of two spells with the Midlanders. The Guard's impressive form continued over two seasons and in 2001, he earned a lucrative move to Aris Thessaloniki in the prestigious Greek A1 Ethniki league. =Back to England= However, after just one season in the Mediterranean, Williams returned to England and signed for the Essex Leopards, the same franchise he made his BBL debut against in 1994. While Yorick had an impressive career up to this point, there was a severe lack of honours won, and he was desperate for success. The Leopards were one of the best teams to grace the league in the 1990s, but following the end of his first season (2002-03) when he averaged 15.22 PPG, the Leopards franchise withdrew from the league and yet again the journeyman was forced to find another club. =Overdue success= Brighton Bears came calling and Williams signed for the South-coaster's in what would be his most successful spell to date. The 2003-04 season saw Brighton, with the help of Yorick's average of 14.16 PPG, dominate the domestic scene, winning the BBL Championship and finishing runners-up in the BBL Trophy, losing by 2 points (66-68) against the Chester Jets. This season also saw the Bears compete in the ULEB Cup, and for Yorrick a return to playing basketball against European opposition. Brighton took 3rd place in Group F, with a 4-6 record. The 2004-05 season saw Brighton again finish runner-up in the BBL Trophy, and although they could not retain their Championship crown, they did find triumph in the BBL Cup, beating the Scottish Rocks 90-74. For Yorrick it was a season of mixed emotions as the triumph's were tarnished by injury that restricted him to just 19 games, averaging 17.26 PPG. =A season to remember= The summer of 2005 brought wholesale changes at Brighton, and after only two games into the 2005-06 season, Williams was transferred back to the Birmingham Bullets. In 29 games for the struggling Bullets, rooted to the foot of the table for the season's duration, Williams posted a career high 23.90 points-per-game, the highest in the league. Birmingham's financial pressures were too much to handle however, and the franchise went into liquidation in 2006. For the 2006-07 season, Williams signed with East Midlander's the Leicester Riders, but after a dire season blighted by off-court difficulties, including unpaid wages, Williams departed the troubled club and headed south to sign for the Milton Keynes Lions for the 2007‚Äì08 season.

The beach is a popular tourist destination. The Marieta Islands () are a group of small uninhabited islands a few miles off the coast of the state of Nayarit, Mexico, located in federal waters approximately southwest of the peninsula known as Punta de Mita, in the municipality of Bah√≠a de Banderas. The islands are a popular tourist destination because of the abundant marine life populations due to the islands being protected from fishing and hunting by the Mexican government. The ocean water depth around the islands is between 70 and 110 feet.  Geography  The Marietas islands were originally formed many thousands of years ago by volcanic activity, and are completely uninhabited. The islands are about an hour-long boat ride west-northwest from the coast of Puerto Vallarta or a 15-minute boat ride from the resort area of Punta Mita and are visited daily by hundreds of tourists. However, visitors cannot legally set foot on the islands. In the early 1900s, the Mexican government began conducting military testing on the islands since they were uninhabited. Many bombings and large explosions took place on the islands causing caves and rock formations to be created. After a massive international outcry, started by scientist Jacques Cousteau in the late 1960s, the government eventually decided to declare the islands a national park and therefore protected against any fishing, hunting or human activity. Situated in a sort of open sun-drenched crater, this beach is affectionately nicknamed the \\"hidden beach\\" or \\"beach of love\\" (), it is accessible only when the tide is low. This beach was created by bombs in the 1900's and the erosion afterwards.  Flora and fauna  Many species of birds make the Islands their breeding and feeding ground The islands are home to 44 different species of plants and wildlife. This has led to the inclusion of National Park in RAMSAR sites its designation as a UNESCO MAB Biosphere Reserve. Many species of seabirds use the location as feeding and breeding grounds, these include blue-footed boobies as well as the red-billed tropicbirds. It also has many different varieties of coral, which, in turn, is home to a large variety of reef fish species. The island ecosystem is also home to dolphins, Manta Rays and a number of tropical fish. Eels and many species of sea turtles are also found in the reefs and the many caves that dot the site. During the winter months humpback whales arrive at the islands and can be observed all through winter.  Tourism  breaching off the islands Protection by the government has created an environment conducive to the development of the marine ecosystem, and is a popular location for snorkeling and scuba diving. Not even during whale watching tours, people often report seeing sea turtles, manta rays, octopus, wild dolphins, humpback whales and thousands of species of tropical fish around the islands. The islands are also home to a few thousand birds, with species such as the blue-footed booby. Currently, the Mexican government allows only a few companies to go to the islands and allows the landing of passengers onto one secluded beach with the necessary permit from SEMARNAT. From Punta de Mita, small boats do tours through the islands to see the wildlife of this region. From December to March gray and humpback whales can be observed that come from Alaska to give birth off the coast of Nayarit. It has been estimated in studies carried out at the University of Guadalajara that the so-called \\"hidden beach\\" or the \\"love beach\\" can accommodate up to 116 visitors a day without degrading. The carrying capacity of the entire park is 625 visitors a day. (These studies used the antiquated system of Tourism carrying capacity to estimate visitors). However the actual number of visitors is typically three or four times this limit with more than 2500 visitors landing on it each day during 2016. During the Easter holidays more than 250 boats landed on the island per day, some of them carrying as many as 400 tourists. This has been due to recent interest in the Island. The number of tourists in 2012 was only 27,500, but this skyrocketed to 127,372 in 2015.  Closure to general public  The pristine beaches of the Islands were a popular tourist destination In May 2016, the National Commission of Protected Natural Areas, the national environmental authority in Mexico announced that the Islands and their beaches shall be closed to the general public from May 9.Marieta Islands has been closed There have been several reasons presented for this closure, although all of them stem from the increased number of tourists visiting the site. One of the main reasons of the closure is that the coral in the area is being destroyed. The cause of coral destruction is thought to be a combination of global warming, presence of boat oil in the water due to excessive tour trips and physical destruction due to dropping of anchors up to 250 times a day. The structure of the Islands and the famous beach is composed of two types of volcanic rocks. The interior is made up of \\"explosive rocks\\" which erode quickly and the exterior \\"shell\\" is made up of a more resilient form of rock which can withstand erosion to a greater degree.This does not mean that the island is not susceptible to erosion. According to various studies carried out in 2014 it has been estimated that the Island only has a few thousand more years before it will erode away. However, the rate of erosion is being accelerated by human impact and according to officials, \\"Excessive tourism could lead to a more rapid destruction of this sanctuary.\\" Another problem is the increase in solid waste pollution and hydrocarbon pollution. These pose a threat not only to the coral but to larger animals as well. even the humpback whales have felt the negative impact of hydrocarbon pollution. When the closure was announced, rumors began to circulate on various social media networks that the Islands and the beaches had been sold to foreign corporations. Roberto Sandoval, the governor of Nayarit, dismissed these rumors as fabrications and stated that the Islands were part of the Mexican national heritage and shall therefore remain an icon of Riviera Nayarit forever.  Conservation efforts  The Mexican authorities have outlined several plans to undo the damage done to the beaches and the islands. These will focus not only repairing the damage already caused by human hands, but will also focus on mitigating any further human interference in the ecosystem. The first part of the plan is to \\"replant\\" the coral in order to compensate for the coral that has been destroyed. This is done by attaching new coral to the already existing coral and letting it grow for 3 to 4 months. Another major effort focuses on limiting the damaging human impact on the sanctuary when the islands reopen for the general public and tourists. According to National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) after the Islands have been reopened for tourism tourist overload may be mitigated by placing a special floating dock in the bay area which will limit the ships that arrive. another measure under consideration is to place buoys around the fragile ecosystem in order to control the number of visitors that are arriving.

A place for experimentation, thought provoking original works, reinterpretations of classic works, vital community events, and a home to ensemble works of all disciplines, the Center has hosted/presented over 100 events in the last two years including 5 pieces by the Ensemble itself. Brooklyn New York, the Irondale Ensemble Project descends from the ensemble movement in American theatre. This movement came out of the Great Depression and developed throughout the age of progressive politics during the 1960s.Taken from the company's website: irondale.org Irondale Ensemble Project creates theatre that is a voice for social change and has performed in schools, prisons, shelters, and other community settings. Central to their work is the exploration of collaboration, creativity, pedagogy and the process of theatre-making through the long association of theatre artists working as an ensemble.Taken from the website for the Network of Ensemble Theatres:http://ensembletheaters.net/netmembers.htm Irondale is a member of the Theatre Communications Group, the Network of Ensemble Theatres and ART New York. It is funded by the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York State Council on the Arts, and the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs. History The Irondale Ensemble Project was founded in 1983, by Jim Niesen, Terry Greiss and Barbara Mackenzie-Wood as an experimental/research theater to further investigate the performance and education techniques that they had developed at the Long Wharf Theatre in the late 1970s. It exists today as a company dedicated to the exploring the emerging themes in our society with a permanent ensemble of artists that has developed a distinctive body of work and practices. In 2008, the company moved into the BAM Cultural District in the landmarked Fort Greene area of Brooklyn. Irondale is a founding member of the Network of Ensemble Theaters, a national consortium of artist-driven performance companies. Between 2000 and 2008, Irondale was the administrative ‚Äúlead company‚Äù of the NET. The majority of the company‚Äôs work follows two closely related performance styles: the presentation of established texts in unorthodox and often irreverent productions; and the creation of new theater works, often by combining original material with a classic and blending multiple styles of performance, music, dance, design, historical research text. The company has also created significant documentary theater works including ‚ÄúA People‚Äôs History of Fort Greene‚Äù and ‚Äú911:Voices Unheard‚Äù. In addition to developing and performing its own theatrical pieces, Irondale has conducted extensive programs of educational and community engagement programs. The combination of daily rehearsal and performance work, in conjunction with the para-theatrical use of Irondale techniques as a means of educating and addressing social issues, has done much to shape the politics of Irondale as a company and to determine the nature and direction of its ongoing experiments. The fusion of art and education, to the extent that no separation exists between them, is a considered part of the company‚Äôs aesthetic and philosophy. The company‚Äôs audience is as diverse as its mission would demand, including students, seniors, a general theater-going public and a broad-based mix of social, educational, ethnic and gender backgrounds. Irondale‚Äôs model has been replicated. Irondale, New York has been replicated through the creation of a ‚Äúsister‚Äù ensemble of Canadian theater artists based in Nova Scotia and three NYC based ensembles created by Irondale alumni. They have successfully adapted the model to reach other audiences and accommodate new artistic voices.

He played in the Football League in England for Tranmere Rovers, Chester City and Crewe Alexandra and also played and managed in non-league football. He is the elder brother of comedian John Bishop. Playing career Bishop was born in Liverpool and began his career playing non-league football. He was with Nantwich Town and Winsford United before beginning the first of three spells with Northwich Victoria in 1984‚Äì85. He later had a spell with Altrincham before a brief stint with Runcorn prompted Tranmere Rovers to give Bishop his professional chance at the age of 25 in March 1988. He returned to Northwich on loan in August 1988 but was quickly back with Rovers, making 35 league appearances during their Division Four promotion season. The following season saw Bishop appear at Wembley Stadium as a substitute in the Division Three play-off final against Notts County, which Tranmere lost 2‚Äì0. Match Details In December 1990 Bishop joined local rivals Chester City for ¬£70,000, making him Chester's record signing until Stuart Rimmer returned to the club the following year. He scored seven times in 19 games to help Chester avoid relegation from Division Three, but he was out of favour the following season and spent time on loan with Crewe Alexandra in the closing stages of the season. Bishop regained his place in the Chester side and became the first Chester player to score at the Deva Stadium, albeit with a late consolation in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Stockport County on 25 August 1992. Over the next three years he had spells in and out of the side, before a potent start to the 1995‚Äì96 season saw him score in the opening five games of the season. He added three more before the end of October, but he was ruled out through injury for the remainder of the season. Bishop (now playing part-time) was released at the end of the season, with his final Football League appearance having been as a substitute in a 3‚Äì1 win at Rochdale on 31 October 1995. The season also saw him involved in an unusual incident when out injured during Chester's home win over Hereford United, when he grabbed hold of the public address microphone to criticise the referee as he turned down a Chester penalty appeal. Bishop returned to Northwich in the summer of 1996, making 54 Conference appearances over the next two seasons. He then moved to local rivals Witton Albion, where he also became part of the coaching staff. He had a spell as joint caretaker manager in 1998‚Äì1999, and in 2001 was appointed manager after another successful stint in caretaker charge. But his reign as permanent boss lasted only 10 games and ended shortly after an incident in a Cheshire Senior Cup tie against Woodley Sports . He returned to football as assistant manager to Nigel Gleghorn at Nantwich Town, where he continued his playing days, leaving in the summer of 2002. He then had a spell assisting his former Chester teammate Chris Lightfoot at Runcorn F.C. Halton, with the pair being sacked together in October 2004 .

Naka≈° worked 1500 consecutive days during the war and its aftermath. After the Bosnian War he started the Union of Health workers in 1997. Naka≈° also turned to politics and was elected a member of the parliaments of first the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (one of the two post-Dayton peace agreement entities) and then the state for the SDA of Alija Izetbegoviƒá. He was not particularly nationalist, and was moderate in his views, but was deeply disturbed by the breakup of Bosnia and Herzegovina following the dissolution of Yugoslavia. His last illness was short; he was operated on in Berlin, but died a month later from a ruptured abdominal aneurysm followed by haemorrhagic pancreatitis and kidney failure. His funeral was one of the largest seen in the country and attended by over 10,000 ordinary people, many of whom he had treated. He was buried in Kovaƒçi, an old cemetery dedicated to soldiers and the many civilian victims of the recent war.

Early life and medical career 'Tommy' Openshaw was born in Bury in Lancashire, England, and was educated at Bristol Grammar School. On leaving school he originally trained as an engineer, but then entered Durham University to study medicine. In 1877 he entered the London Hospital Medical College, where he was noted as a successful student and a good football player. In 1879 Openshaw won the Outpatient Dresser's Prize of ¬£15, awarded to the best dresser of wounds in the Outpatients Department.: Master surgeon, photographer, cyclist and angler at www.bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk Having successfully completed his medical studies, Openshaw was awarded an MBBS (Durham) and, in 1883, was appointed a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons. Openshaw took the English Conjoint Diploma in 1884, and in 1886 became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. Among Openshaw's other qualifications at that time were Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries and Master of Surgery (Durham).: Master surgeon, photographer, cyclist and angler at www.bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk Following his Fellowship, he was appointed Assistant Demonstrator of Anatomy at the London Hospital Medical College in 1886, and, after his subsequent appointment as Curator of the Pathology Museum in 1887, he extended and catalogued the Museum's collection of pathological specimens, thereby creating an important research facility for the College's medical students. Openshaw's medical career continued to develop at the London Hospital with his appointment as assistant surgeon in 1890 and surgeon in 1899. He founded the Orthopaedic Department at the London Hospital, and became a consulting surgeon in 1926.'The Lancet' obituary, 23 November 1929 pg 1117 Jack the Ripper Envelope containing the 'Openshaw Letter' Copy of the 'Openshaw Letter'. When a kidney, purportedly from Jack the Ripper victim Catherine Eddowes, was posted to George Lusk, Chairman of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, together with the From Hell letter, Lusk was persuaded by his fellow Committee members to take them to Dr Frederick Wiles, who had a surgery nearby on the Mile End Road. Wiles was out, so his assistant, F S Reed, examined the contents of the box and took the kidney to Openshaw at the nearby London Hospital. Openshaw believed that the kidney was from the left side of a human body. As Openshaw was frequently mentioned in press reports at the time in connection with the kidney and From Hell letter, his name became known widely among the general public. On 29 October 1888 he received a letter through the post addressed to 'Dr Openshaw, Pathological curator, London Hospital, Whitechapel' and was postmarked 'LONDON E', 'OC29 88'. The text of the letter reads as follows: Old boss you was rite it was the left kidny i was goin to hoperate agin close to your ospitle just as i was going to dror mi nife along of er bloomin throte them cusses of coppers spoilt the game but i guess i wil be on the job soon and will send you another bit of innerds Jack the Ripper O have you seen the devle with his mikerscope and scalpul a-lookin at a kidney with a slide cocked up.

However, it was a brand of stationery that was widely available at the time. Also according to Cornwell, mitochondrial DNA extracted from the stamp on the envelope could not be ruled out as being the same as that found on other Sickert letters. Mitochondrial DNA, however, is not a definitive test of identity and the sequence found by Cornwell's team of experts could be from one of over 400,000 individuals.The Complete Jack the Ripper; Donald Rumbelow (Penguin 2004) Military service As a youth Openshaw became a member of the British Army's volunteer force (the then equivalent of the Territorial Army), eventually being appointed Lieutenant Colonel in the Lincolnshire Yeomanry. Having been appointed surgeon to the Volunteer Medical Staff Corps in 1888, when the Second Boer War broke out in South Africa in October 1899, Openshaw left his duties at the London Hospital and went there as surgeon to the Imperial Yeomanry Field Hospital. Openshaw was taken prisoner by the Boers, but was released after two weeks of confinement during an exchange of prisoners. He was subsequently appointed Principal Medical Officer at the Number Three Medical School Hospital in Pretoria. For his services during the Second Boer War Openshaw was awarded the Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) by Queen Victoria. As Openshaw was 58 years old when the First World War broke out in 1914, he was considered too old to serve abroad in the front line. Nevertheless, he was determined to contribute to the war effort and therefore served with the rank of colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps (Territorial Force) as a consulting surgeon based in the United Kingdom. Openshaw later received the Territorial Decoration (TD) for his services. He was elected surgeon to the King Edward VII Hospital, and later, as an acknowledged expert in orthopaedic surgery, he was instrumental in establishing the Queen Mary Convalescent Auxiliary Hospital for the Limbless at Roehampton, where he oversaw the development of effective artificial limbs for the thousands of men who had become amputees because of injuries sustained during the war. In 1917 he was awarded the Companion of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath (CB) for this important work. Interests Openshaw had numerous interests outside of medicine. For example, he was the Master of four guilds, the Worshipful Company of Wheelwrights, the Worshipful Company of Barber-Surgeons, the Worshipful Company of Glovers and the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights. He was also an enthusiastic Freemason and was a founder member of the London Hospital Lodge, and was also a founder of lodges at his old grammar school and university. In addition, he was a Fellow of the Old Time Cyclists Club, President of the Red Spinner Angling Society, President of the Association of Lancastrians in London and an early Master of the Lancastrian Lodge. Later years Openshaw late in life Although he wrote no books or medical treatises, Openshaw was the joint editor of the Catalogue of the Pathological Collection at the London Hospital. From 1916 to 1924 he served on the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons. In addition, he was consulting surgeon to the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, the Poplar Hospital for Accidents, and the Cottage Hospitals of Tilbury, Sidcup and Woolwich. He was surgeon to the Royal Surgical Aid Society. Openshaw had a son and daughter with his wife, Selina Gertrude Pratt, the daughter of William Pratt of Buern Abbey in Oxford, whom he met at the London Hospital where she had trained as a nurse. They married in 1890. His son, Major L.P. Openshaw, served in the Royal Air Force as a pilot and was killed in a mid-air collision during an air show in Bournemouth in June 1927.Bournemouth, Early Airfields, Ensbury Park. at daveg4otu.tripod.com A few months after his wife's death in 1929 Openshaw developed diabetes and died of pneumonia in a nursing home aged 73.

The boundaries of Castle Ward are approximately Bromham Road and Goldington Road to the north, Denmark Street and George Street to the east, Rope Walk to the south, with the Midland Main Line railway line and Ashburnam Road to the west. Castle Ward includes almost all of Bedford town centre, as well as the eastern section of the Castle Road neighbourhood. Castle is the only Ward in the town of Bedford to be located on both sides of the River Great Ouse. In common usage the 'Castle' area is often synonymous with the Castle Road neighbourhood. Since local government boundary changes in Bedford in 2011, however, the Castle Road neighbourhood has been split between Castle Ward and Newnham Ward. History Bedford Castle The name 'Castle' comes from Bedford Castle which is located in the ward. William II granted the Barony of Bedford to Paine de Beauchamp who built the castle. The Castle was destroyed in 1224 by Henry III. In 1166 The town of Bedford was given a Charter. This was when Bedford Market was founded, and it is still held in Castle Ward. To the south of the river, Cauldwell Priory was built in the area by Franciscan Friars in 1238. The priory included a leper colony dedicated to St Leonard. The priory was dissolved by King Henry VIII in 1541, and around this time a new bridge was built over the River Great Ouse, and the town of Bedford began to expand to the south of the river. The river became navigable as far as Bedford by 1689. Up until this time, Bedford was a small agricultural town, with wool being an important industry in the area for much of the Middle Ages. However, with the opening up of the River Great Ouse, wool declined in importance and brewing became a major industry in the town.http://www.localhistories.org/bedford.html 'A brief history of Bedford' by Tim Lambert In 1660 John Bunyan was imprisoned for 12 years in Bedford Gaol, which was located in present-day Castle Ward. It was here that he wrote The Pilgrim's Progress. Bedford Corn Exchange The 19th Century saw Bedford transform into an important engineering hub. In 1832 Gas lighting was introduced into the area that is now Castle Ward, and the railway reached Bedford in 1846. Bedford's Corn Exchange was built in the area in 1849, and the first drains and sewers were dug in 1864. Bedford's growth in the 19th century saw the Castle area expand along the river to the east. After the Second World War, the Cauldwell Street neighbourhood of terraced houses was demolished, making way for new offices and public buildings, including headquarters for Bedford College and Bedfordshire County Council. Bedford Borough Hall in Castle Governance Castle is an unparished area, with all community services under the direct control of Bedford Borough Council. Castle elects two councillors to Bedford Borough Council, both currently from the Green Party, being the first Green Party councillors in Bedford. Economy Virtually all of the Bedford's central business district is located in Castle Ward, with many major High Street shops being located here.

It was historically an extra-parochial area, then civil parish (1866-1926), in Middlesex, England.West Twyford: Introduction, A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 7: Acton, Chiswick, Ealing and Brentford, West Twyford, Willesden (1982). Date accessed: 7 January 2008. It is in the small part of its borough having a NW postcode.

The Borough of Ealing has west London postcodes save for the NW postcode of West Twyford shared with its neighbours including North Acton and Park Royal. History Twyford Abbey west elevation The area now known as West Twyford began as a manor houseTwyford Abbey at Brent Heritage in the fourteenth century. A small community built up to the west around St Mary's Church which had originally been a chapel belonging to the manor house. In 1902 the Alexian Order took over the manor house as a nursing home; it has since been known as Twyford Abbey. The brothers ran short of funds in 1988 and joined another part of their order in Manchester. The abbey, which is a Grade II listed building, now lies derelict.] Various applications for planning permission have been made but not granted. The best view of this beautiful building is from next to St Mary's Church in the wintertime. The name Twyford relates to Twyford Brook. The brook now runs almost entirely underground. It formerly fed the Guinness brewery in Park Royal. The word itself 'Twyford' is said to mean 'Two Fords'. The area became a civil parish under the Extra-Parochial Places Act 1857 and formed part of Greenford Urban District from 1894. In 1901 it occupied an area of and had a population of 97. When the urban district was abolished in 1926 the parish was transferred to the Municipal Borough of Ealing. Then in 1934 it was transferred to the Municipal Borough of Willesden. The area now forms part of Greater London. Much of the housing on Twyford Abbey Road was originally built by Guinness in order to house employees working in at the brewery in Park Royal. Abbeyfields Close is one such residential development, built in 1984 around a series of communal gardens, on land formerly owned by Guinness, although its name hints that it might have originally been agricultural land forming part of Twford Abbey estate. The parish of St Mary's was combined with the parish of the Church of the Ascension in neighbouring Hanger Hill. In the 1950s the chapel of St Mary's was extended with a new large church building, which later fell into disrepair and disuse, due to safety issues. In 2010 the new church was totally renovated to become a community hall and the original chapel was re-dedicated to St Mary to become the church again. The church itself is quite tiny, having originally been the chapel of Twyford Abbey, located just behind. St Mary's churchyard contains one of the oldest headstones in Middlesex. Transport Bus route 226 runs through Twyford Abbey Road towards Ealing Central and Golders Green (via Harlesden). Routes 83, 95 and 112 also stop nearby on the Hanger Lane Gyratory and the A406 North Circular Road, respectively. These buses run towards Ealing Hospital (via Ealing Broadway), Shepherd's Bush, Southall and Brent Cross, as well as Golders Green (via Wembley). West Twyford is close to two London Underground stations: * Hanger Lane (Central line) * Park Royal (Piccadilly line) Amenities West Twyford is well served for groceries, banking, post office and health services at the nearby 'Park Royal Neighbourhood Centre' where there is also a popular Lebanese Restaurant, a Spice Shack restaurant and Subway cafe. A new building is going up at the moment on Acton Lane next to the Central Middlesex Hospital which will have retail and restaurant space on the ground floor. For Vue Cinema, Megabowl ten pin bowling, Pure Gym and a choice of about 10 popular chain restaurants there is 'Park Royale', a leisure park immediately to the south of the A40 and West Twyford and accessed by the underpass by Park Royal tube station. The Boden flagship store is located next to Park Royal Tube station. Education There is a primary school in West Twyford that caters for children from 3 to 11 years old. It has around 300 pupils on the school roll. Sport and Leisure West Twyford Park was formerly called Bodiam Fields, after the area of the same name in Sussex, where hops were grown for the Guinness brewery. There are plans for improvements to West Twyford Park as well as new lakeside walks and cycle paths nearby. The Grand Union Canal runs through West Twyford and provides level pathways alongside for walking a running. It is a short walk along the canalside to the Grand Junction Pub, which has lots of outdoor seating alongside the canal. The pathway continues to Little Venice and Paddington. Crystals on Twyford Abbey Road is a bar and function room, but also holds Zumba classes in its function room. Culture and community There are a number of active community projects in West Twyford, including the 'West Twyford Community and Youth' project and 'West Twyford Children‚Äôs Centre'. The latter provides a range of services and activities, including mother and toddler groups, health services, daycare, before and after school clubs, Women into Work and English classes. St Mary‚Äôs Church Community Hall, on Brentmead Gardens provides a range of activities for local people. Future West Twyford will soon benefit from a new public plaza with shops, cafes, a restaurant and health and fitness club. There will also be new public play, games and fitness areas in West Twyford Park. There will be an improved pedestrian/cycle route from West Twyford to Park Royal Underground station, and the station itself is also due to be improved. The public park, walkways two children's playgrounds plus a new games court are now completed, however the plaza seems to be on hold for the time being. Flats in the Royal Waterside development (Bodiam Court and Abbey Court) are due to be finished from summer 2015. In the Mayor's plans for the Park Royal Opportunity Area, it says that one of their objectives is to get public access to the grounds of Twyford Abbey heritage site.

Wastelands: Stories of the Apocalypse. San Francisco: Nightshade Book, 2008. 245-55. Print. Plot summary A mysterious pandemic leaves civilization in ruins and severely limits humankind's ability to communicate. Some are deprived of their ability to read or write, while others lose the ability to speak. They identify themselves by carrying items or symbols that function as names. People communicate among themselves through universally understood sign language and gestures that can often exacerbate misunderstandings and conflicts. Additionally, it seems that as a result of the illness and their handicap, many ordinary people are easily prone to uncontrollable feelings of jealousy, resentment, and rage over their own impairments and the ability of others. In Los Angeles, a woman named Rye has lost her parents, husband, sister and children to the illness. Due to this isolation, she decides to seek out her brother and his family in nearby Pasadena. They are her only remaining relatives, although she is unsure if they have survived. When a fight breaks out on a bus, Rye is forced to consider walking the rest of the twenty miles through dangerous territory. She then meets Obsidian, a man dressed in an LAPD uniform, an oddity in a society in which all governmental organizations have disintegrated. He stops to restore order, ending the fight by throwing an object which releases gas into the bus, causing everyone to exit and the fight to end. He then offers her a ride in his car. She initially refuses the offer of a ride, noting the gun he owns and fearing his intentions. However, he gestures persistently and removes his revolver to indicate he doesn't intend to harm her. Confronted with the hostilities of her fellow passengers or the threat of walking the streets alone, she cautiously accepts the stranger's offer, and together they resume the trip out of the city. Before long, Rye learns that Obsidian can still read a map, and she struggles with an intense feeling of jealousy and an urge to kill him. Instead, she reveals that she is still able to talk, and the two share an intimate moment and have sex. Rye asks Obsidian to return home with her, and he reluctantly agrees. On the road home, the couple observes a woman being chased by a man wielding a knife. Both feel inclined to intervene in the woman's defense but are unable to prevent the woman from being fatally stabbed. After wounding the assailant, the man is able to wrestle the gun from Obsidian and shoot him in the head, which instantly kills him. Rye then kills the assailant. After the violence, two children emerge, a boy and a younger girl, apparently the children of the dead woman. Rye drags Obsidian back to the car with the intention of giving him a proper burial‚Äîand initially plans to ignore the plight of the children‚Äîbut shortly afterward, she has a change of heart and returns for the body of the woman and her two children. As she reaches for the woman's body, the girl speaks in coherent English, shouting \\"No. Go Away,\\" and the young boy tells her not to speak. This is the first coherent speech that Rye has heard in many years, and she realizes that her choice to adopt the children is the right one. \\"I‚Äôm Valerie Rye,\\" she says. \\"It‚Äòs all right for you to talk to me.\\" It is the first time she has spoken her own name in a very long time.Butler, Octavia E. \\"Speech Sounds.\\" Bloodchild and Other Stories. New York: Seven Stories Press, 1996. pp. 87‚Äì110. Print.  Themes  Communication Everyone has to use symbols that represent their name as forms of identification. Rye uses a pin in the shape of a stalk of wheat (the closest thing to \\"rye\\") and Obsidian uses a black rock. We learn that \\"Rye\\" is actually our protagonist's last name; her first name is Valerie. Rye going by just her last name represents the limitations of communication in the society.Troy, Maria Holmgren. \\"Loss of Words: Octavia Butler's 'Speech Sounds'.\\" The Power of Words. Ed. Solveig Granath, June Miliander, and Elizabeth Wenn√∂. Karlstad, Sweden: Karlstads Universitet, 2005. 73-80. We also do not know if \\"Obsidian\\" is actually his name; Rye assumes it from the black rock token he shows her. The limited nonverbal communication present in the society has most people harboring intense feelings of jealousy, rage, and aggression. The fight on the bus was initiated by one wrong look. There is even an hierarchical aspect in the abilities still retained among everyone; left-handed people are seen as more intellectual, and less prone to aggression and irrationality. The entire story is guided by gestures, from the mock throwing of punches between the men on the bus to Obsidian's gentle touch with Rye in the car. Rye notices Obsidian frequently motioning with his left hand, a sign that he has retained some intellect. The male passengers on the bus, with obvious lesser abilities, do mostly obscene gestures in the first half of the story, a lot of which now represent the new society's versions of curse words. Survival The decline in intellectual ability has left everyone to fend for themselves in the post-apocalyptic society. Rye carries a gun with her at all times for this reason. Rye has learned to be a quick thinker, knowing exactly what to do when the fight on the bus breaks out, like stopping herself from getting hurt and getting off the bus as soon as she could.Govan, Sandra Y. \\"Disparate Spirits Yet Kindred Souls: Octavia E. Butler, 'Speech Sounds,' and Me.\\" Strange Matings: Science Fiction, Feminism, African American Voices, and Octavia E. Butler. Ed. Rebecca J. Holden and Nisi Shawl. Seattle, WA: Aqueduct, 2013. 109-127. Any sense of normalcy and protection has diminished; any sort of transportation can be used as weapons (hence the lack of cars and Rye's surprise when a bus turned up), and organizations such as the LAPD have ceased to exist. When she first encounters Obsidian, an LAPD officer still in uniform, she was wary of his intentions, fearing he might harm her. The children Rye saves at the end of the story have also learned to protect themselves at a young age. When Rye attempts to retrieve the body of the women, the sister of the pair tells her \\"No! Go away!,\\" and the brother reprimands her for speaking out loud to a stranger; he is aware that if people know they can speak, they can be in serious danger.Sorlin, Sandrine. \\"Stylistic Techniques and Ethical Staging in Octavia Butler's 'Speech Sounds'.\\" The Ethics and Poetics of Alterity: New Perspectives on Genre Literature.

She was the first person known to be buried at what would become known as Arlington National Cemetery.  Early life  Mary Randolph was born on August 9, 1762, at Ampthill Plantation in Chesterfield County, Virginia. Her parents were Thomas Mann Randolph Sr. (1741‚Äì1794) and Anne Cary Randolph (1745‚Äì1789). The extended Randolph family was one of the richest and most political significant families in 18th century Virginia. Mary's father was orphaned at a young age and raised by Thomas Jefferson's parents who were distant cousins. Her father also served in the Virginia House of Burgesses, the Revolutionary conventions of 1775 and 1776, and the Virginia state legislature. Anne Cary Randolph was the daughter of Archibald Cary, an important Virginia planter. Anne's grandmother, Jane Bolling Randolph completed a cookbook manuscript in 1743 which was handed down to her daughter Jane Randolph Walke. Anne Cary Randolph was also a descendant of Pocahontas and John Rolfe through her mother Mary (granddaughter of John Bolling, great- granddaughter of Jane Rolfe). Mary Randolph was the oldest of Thomas and Anne's 13 children. Her brother Thomas Mann Randolph Jr. married Martha Jefferson (daughter of Thomas Jefferson) and became a Congressman and Governor of Virginia. One sister, Virginia Randolph Cary, was a noted essayist and another, Harriet, married Richard Shippey Hackley who became US Consul and they lived in Cadiz, Spain. She was probably the source of the Spanish recipes in Randolph's cookbook. Her sister, Ann Cary \\"Nancy\\" Randolph, was the wife of Gouverneur Morris and mother of Gouverneur Morris Jr. Ann figured in a scandal involving her brother-in-law and distant cousin, Richard Randolph of Bizarre, in which he was responsible for \\"feloniously murdering a child said to be borne of Nancy [Ann] Randolph.\\" Randolph grew up at Tuckahoe Plantation in Goochland County, Virginia. The Randolphs were known to hire professional tutors to teach their children. Mary would likely have learned reading, writing, and arithmetic in addition to domestic skills. Marriage 1807 engraving of David Meade Randolph In December 1780, 18-year-old Mary Randolph married her first cousin once removed, David Meade Randolph (1760‚Äì1830), a Revolutionary War officer and tobacco planter. The newlyweds lived at Presquile, a 750-acre plantation that was part of the Randolph family's extensive property in Chesterfield County, Virginia. Over the course of their marriage, Mary and David had eight children, four of whom survived to adulthood. Around 1795 President George Washington appointed David Randolph the U.S. Marshal of Virginia and by 1798, the family had moved to Richmond, where they built a house called \\"Moldavia\\" (a combination of Molly, a nickname for Mary, and David). Mary Randolph was a celebrated hostess in Richmond. David Randolph was a Federalist and an open critic of his second cousin Thomas Jefferson. After Jefferson's election to the presidency, he removed David Randolph from office and the family's fortunes declined. Boarding house In 1807, Mary Randolph opened a boarding house in Richmond. In March 1808, an advertisement appeared in The Richmond Virginia Gazette: \\"Mrs. RANDOLPH Has established a Boarding House in Cary Street, for the accommodation of Ladies and Gentlemen. She has comfortable chambers, and a stable well supplied for a few Horses.\\" David was in England during the 1810 census which listed Mary as the head of a Richmond household that included nine slaves. In May 1815, Harriott Pinckney Horry spent a few days at the Randolph's boardinghouse and described Randolph's refrigerator in her journal. Inside a 4 by 3 1/2 foot box there was another box four inches smaller. The space between the two was packed with powdered charcoal and the refrigerator was filled with ice daily to cool butter, meat and other foods. In the 1825 2nd edition of her cookbook, Randolph included sketches for a refrigerator and bath tub. Years later an author claimed (falsely) that Randolph invented the refrigerator and that her design was stolen and patented by a Yankee who stayed in her boardinghouse. By 1819, the Randolphs had given up their boardinghouse and moved to Washington to live with their son William Beverly Randolph. While in Washington, Mary Randolph completed her cookbook and in 1824 The Virginia House-Wife was published.  The Virginia House-Wife  Randolph's influential housekeeping book The Virginia House-Wife was first published in 1824 and it was republished at least nineteen times before the outbreak of the Civil War. The book was 225 pages long, included nearly 500 recipes, and resulted from Randolph's \\"practical experience as keeper of a large establishment, and perhaps in the hope of further augmenting the family income.\\" The Virginia House-Wife is considered the first regional American cookbook. According to historian Cynthia A. Kierner, \\"Randolph presented a southern ‚Äî specifically, a Virginian ‚Äî model for southern readers. Although her occasional explanations of uniquely southern foods suggests she anticipated an audience beyond her region, [Randolph's work] appealed to the women of the rural South who were the majority of her readers.\\" Randolph's recipes exhibited a uniquely Virginian style, using Virginia produce for dishes influenced by African, Native American, and European foods. The book included recipes for Southern classics such as okra, sweet potatoes, biscuits, fried chicken, barbecue shote (young pig), and lemonade. European influenced recipes included gazpacho, ropa vieja, polenta, and macaroni. Six curry recipes were included in The Virginia House-Wife, these were the first curry recipes published in the United States and suggest curry was already a popular seasoning in the region. Specialties from other parts of the US included a recipe entitled \\"Dough Nuts - A Yankee Cake.\\" The Virginia House-Wife also included the first ice cream recipe published by an American author. Conventional wisdom has claimed that early Americans ate few vegetables and overcooked the few they did eat. The Virginia House-Wife gives recipes for forty some vegetables and seventeen aromatic herbs. This dietary diversity can be confirmed with Thomas Jefferson's notes on the produce for sale in Washington's markets. Randolph specifically recommended short cooking times for asparagus and spinach, Karen Hess points out that overcooking didn't become common until canning became a popular method of preservation in the mid-nineteenth century. Although Randolph was a knowledgeable cook, the majority of the labor in her kitchen was done by black women. While it is impossible to speculate on Randolph's relationship to these women, Melissa Blank of Colonial Williamsburg sees \\"evidence that enslaved cooks had a significant influence on how Mary prepared food.\\" Karen Hess's introduction to the 1984 edition of the Virginia housewife notes \\"The black presence was infinitely more subtle in Virginia cookery than in that of New Orleans or the West Indies, but ... the culture was sufficiently imbued with it to condition the palette of the entire community. Hess cites gumbo, eggplant, field peas, yams and possibly tomatoes as crops black cooks brought with them to the Americas. Hess also notes the West Indies forged a connection between Spanish, French, Creole, and Southern cooking. The Virginia House-Wife was an overall household guide and in addition to recipes it also explained how to make soap, starch, blacking and cologne. Later years Marker over the grave of Mary Randolph at Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial, at Arlington National Cemetery. Randolph spent the last years of her life caring for her son Burwell Starke Randolph, who had been disabled while serving in the Navy. Randolph was the first person known to be buried at what would become Arlington National Cemetery, at the home of her cousin George Washington Parke Custis, stepson of George Washington and father of Mary Custis, wife of Robert E. Lee.  Influence  Southern cookbooks similar to The Virginia House-Wife were published in the years that followed. Two of the most important were The Kentucky Housewife by Lettice Bryan (1839) and The Carolina Housewife by Sarah Rutledge (1847). In 1982, James Beard praised Mary as \\"a far-seeing culinary genius\\" in The Richmond News Leader. He was particularly impressed by her use of tomatoes, writing \\"At a time when few people thought of tomatoes at all, she provided food recipes for tomato ketchup, tomato marmalade and tomato soy.\\" According to culinary historian Andrew F. Smith, Randolph's wide range of tomato recipes \\"set the standard for tomato cookery over the next three decades.\\" In a 2014 essay for National Geographic, restaurant Jose Andres cited Mary Randolph as an influence. Andres serves Randolph's gazpacho at his America Eats Tavern and believes that Randolph's \\"Gazpacho recipe demonstrates just how far back the notion of this country as a cultural melting pot goes.\\" Honors Grave of Mary Randolph at Arlington National Cemetery. In 2009 Randolph was posthumously honored as one of the Library of Virginia's \\"Virginia Women in History\\". In 1999, the state of Virginia erected a historical marker in her honor near the site of her birth in Chesterfield County.

Opened in 1981, it covers . The museum scriptis an interpretive center focusing on 19th-century iron-making technology. It features an extensive collection of machinery and other iron industry artifacts spanning from the time of the American Civil War until the 1960s, including belt-driven machines, a reconstruction of an 1870s machine shop, and four steam engines. The collection also houses over ten thousand artifacts and other items sourced from archaeological digs at various iron- making sites in Alabama such as the Roupes Valley Ironworks, and from the Alabama Department of Archives and History, the Henry Ford Museum, and the Washington Navy Yard. The collection includes rare steam engines, forge cams and war materials manufactured at the CS Naval Gun Works at Selma, Alabama. In the museum, the collections and displays feature both belt-driven machines and the nineteenth century iron-making tools and products. The museum preserves more than 10,000 historical relics, including collections from the Washington Navy Yard and the Henry Ford Museum, as well as rare iron-making machinery from the Tredegar Ironworks from Virginia. The displayed ironworks show how iron making developed during the period from the Civil War to the 1960s. By visiting the museum, visitors can understand how iron making in this area grows into the later Birmingham Iron & Steel District. This site preserves and demonstrates thousands of artefacts from archaeological digs in this area, showing the previous human activities in Alabama from the end of the Civil War to the middle of the 20 centuries. On top of that, 16 slave cabins have also been unearthed on the site in more recent excavations. The museum is connected with the best preserved furnaces at Tannehill Ironworks by the Tram Track Hiking Trail. Various interactive displays are available in the museum, which can enable the visitors to go back into the historical environments in the nineteenth-century Alabama. Visitors can follow the timeline of industrial growth to trace how iron trade developed from the ancient Egypt to modern Fairfield Works in Birmingham. The Tannehill Learning Centre currently offers educational programmes and tours to school children in this region. Museum visitors are provided with field trips during the spring and fall. The museum underwent a major renovation of its exhibits in 2004‚Äì05. The site also has a 30-seat theatre which plays a short video on the park's history. History of Iron and steel in Alabama=Post-war decades: From 1860s to 1880s= Since the Civil War, North Alabama became one of the country's leading iron and steel manufacturers. The Birmingham District was particularly well positioned to be an iron-and-steel production centre in the southern United States. The development of Alabama's iron and steel industry was primarily stimulated by the abundance of raw materials; coal, iron ore, limestone, and dolomite. The most powerful and profitable companies in North Alabama were those which had direct control over mines, as well as other facilities necessary for extracting and assembling raw materials, such as blast furnaces. Being dependent on raw materials and relevant infrastructural facilities, iron and steel makers expanded the furnaces in Alabama. Those manufacturers also attempted to incorporate new charging machines to increase the overall production of iron. Since iron and steel production was a resource-intensive industry this required powerful iron and steel manufacturing enterprises to hold a control over the regional railroads in Alabama. A typical example was the Woodward Iron Company whose holdings were mostly linked by a company-owned railroad. This railroad originally measured 12 miles in length but the company extended it outward from its blast furnaces, to its quarries of limestone and dolomite, and further to its coal mines and ore mines. =In the late 1800s= In the late 1800s, with the large investments financed by northern bankers and southern investors, as well as the technological expertise provided by northern and mid-western engineers, the iron and steel industry began to flourish in Birmingham, Alabama. In addition, the growth of Alabama's iron and steel industry was further facilitated by the influx of a large labour force at that time. During the last decades of the nineteenth century, Alabama's agricultural sector was mainly dominated by the economic models of sharecropping and tenant farming. This tenancy system encompassed over 60 percent of the farming population in Alabama; however, under its influence, landless farmers had to suffer from a legacy of illiteracy and poverty. Driven by poverty, many labourers, including unemployed and impoverished freedmen and white people, began to search for jobs in the iron-and-steel manufacturing industry, which was considered to be a more attractive alternative to sharecropping and tenant farming. Moreover, the introduction of convict-lease system also provided Alabama's iron and steel manufacturers with abundant cheap labour. The convict-lease system functioned in the state and counties of Alabama between 1875 and 1928, through which iron manufacturers paid to the local governments in exchange for prison labour. As regulated by the system, prisoners had to work for the companies that leased them from the governments. Until its abolition in 1928, the convict-lease system had provided iron manufacturers, owners of coal mines, and other enterprises in Alabama with a substantial number of prisoners as cheap labourers. At the end of the nineteenth century, due to the region's abundant geographical resources coupled with its low raw-material assembly costs, Alabama experienced a period of rocket development. =In the early 1900s= At the beginning of the twentieth century, as steel production became more dependent on the use of electric arc furnace technology in mini-mill environments, the convenient transportation of scrap metal became a competitive advantage of manufacturers, so the availability of geographical resources was no longer the most significant driving force for iron-and-steel production growth. The Birmingham area began to invest in building the earliest mini-mills, and continued to have a strong foundry emphasis, attracting many large cast-iron pipe producers, such as American Cast Iron Pipe Company. Headquartered in Birmingham in 1905, American Cast Iron Pipe Company, with its 2,100 acre site and 2,400 employees at its operations, became the world's largest iron pipe casting plant. With advanced expertise and the latest technological innovations, Birmingham furnaces produced millions of tons of pig iron from 1990s to 1970s. A half of the produced pig iron was used for steel production, and the other half was sold as foundry iron. This trend reflected that the region's iron ore was of poor quality, so manufacturers had difficulties in extracting it. This is a geological factor that limited the further development of Alabama's iron and steel industry, despite the help of advanced technology and innovative smelting practices. Origins and development of the museum The growth of Alabama's iron and steel industry was significantly influenced by Tannehill iron-making practices, such as using distilled coal residues as a furnace fuel, making early experimentation with coke, and reducing red iron ore from Red Mountain in a blast furnace. Due to the significant role that Tannehill pays in Alabama's iron and steel industry, the Alabama Central District of Civitan International and the representatives of the University of Alabama first proposed in the late 1960s that a state park should be built to preserve the site of Tannehill Ironworks, the birthplace of the Birmingham iron industry. The proposal was approved by the state in 1969, and in the following year 1970, the Tannehill Historical State Parkopened to the public. There are more than 45 historical buildings in this state park, including the May Plantation Cotton Gin House, the John Wesley Hall Gristmill, as well as a collection of log cabins that trace back to the nineteenth century. Among the efforts to preserve the historical buildings and Tannehill artifacts, the Iron and Steel Museum of Alabama was built, and it opened in 1981. At present, the Tannehill Ironworks state park has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the Civil War Discovery Trail. In particular, the museum demonstrates how 13 iron manufacturers and 6 rolling mills worked to produce iron during the Civil War, making the Tannehill Ironworks among the best-preserved and oldest historical sites in the Southeastern part of this country. From 2004 to 2005, the museum had a significant make-over to introduce more new exhibits to the site, including an old rice-plantation-owned power source, and one of the oldest steam engines in this country. In 2017, Tannehill Ironworks, containing the Iron and Steel Museum of Alabama, became one of the six Birmingham historical sites which contributed to the creation of the Birmingham Industrial Heritage Trail. More recently, the Tannehill Furnace memorial park has become one of the most visited sites in Alabama, and the number of visitors each year exceeds 425,000. This is mainly due to the park's organisation of a variety of outdoor events and activities; for example, the Trade Days event is organised monthly from March to November each year, and visitors also have an opportunity to participant in a Civil War battle re-enactment. Buildings and displays=Buildings= The museum has several functional areas, with the main museum building covering over 13,000 square feet. The displays at the main museum building contains iron-industry content as well as a wide variety of archaeological artifacts. In addition, the museum also houses the Walter B. Jones Centre for Industrial Archaeology and includes an exhibit centre, the 1858 May Plantation Cotton Gin House, a 30-seat theatre, as well as a gift shop. The exhibition centre displays preserved Birmingham's iron-and-steel industrial artifacts over the period from 1930s to the 1960s. Main museum displays To show the visitors how Birmingham's iron industry developed, the main museum displays a wide range of Tannehill artifacts that have survived. Visitors, through paying a visit to the museum, can learn from the graphic exhibits how iron was made by 13 different iron companies and six rolling mills and how Alabama's iron-making industry made this state the arsenal of the Confederacy. Although Alabama's iron and steel industry experienced rapid growth during the post-war decades, Alabama's iron production had already occupied a central position in the country's iron supply before the war ended. In the last two years of the Civil War, iron produced by Alabama furnaces accounted for 70% of the Confederate iron supply. To demonstrate the significant role Alabama played during the war , the museum displays a large number of wartime ironworks, including cookware, rifles and other weapons used by US soldiers (e.g. a 52 Cal. U.S. Spencer Repeater), cast-iron water pipes, CS artillery projectiles, the original parts of the Six Mile Bloomery Forge manufactured in 1860s, as well as a part of the Steve Phillips Collection. Notably, the artillery shells manufactured from 1862 to 1865 at the Naval Gun Works are also preserved in this museum, and this exhibition is considered as the South's largest collection of artillery shells. In addition to the wartime iron relics, the museum preserves and demonstrates substantial numbers of historical artifacts that have witnessed the development of Alabama's iron and steel industry, such as a cast iron water pipe made in Birmingham during the 1880s. The Iron and Steel Museum of Alabama not only displays iron relics but also preserves archaeological artifacts uncovered in this region. The site houses Walter B. Jones Centre for Industrial Archaeology, a state geologist and archeologist who devoted his lifetime to investigating Alabama's mineral and fossil fuel resources (Garrison, 2001) His geological and archaeological works are well preserved by many museums and historical institutions, including the University of Alabama's Jones Museum at Moundville Archaeological Park, as well as the Iron and Steel Museum of Alabama. In addition to the preservation of the archaeological works written by Walter Jones, the museum is further famous for its conservation of more than 10,000 archaeological artifacts that were discovered from 8 major on-site archaeological investigations from 1956 to 2008. It is noteworthy that the main museum building also houses a small research library. In this library, those who are interested in investigating the iron-making history in this country (e.g. historical researchers, scholars, and students) can find many historical archives, published materials, records, as well as first-hand accounts.

Fletch's failure to meet deadlines earns him a reproach from city desk editor Gus Haynes. While researching a feature on the homeless, Fletcher gets to know Bubbles, spending a considerable amount of time with him over a span of a few weeks, while Bubbles acts as Fletcher's guide to the city's homeless population. Fletcher visits Bubbles in various settings: the soup kitchen where he volunteers, an NA meeting, and while selling newspapers. After getting his permission, Fletcher publishes an article about Bubbles. The article was favorably received by both Haynes and Bubbles. Fletcher is promoted to city desk editor after Haynes is demoted. The quality and depth of Fletcher's article about Bubbles is in contrast to what David Simon says is a major theme of the season: The Sun misses the important stories about the city.

Twigg often smokes with editors Tim Phelps and Gus Haynes. Haynes dispatched Twigg to report on a rowhouse fire that Haynes spots from the Newsroom window.

Building The organization, founded before the YMCA as the Young Men's Christian Union, had previously met at an office on Union Street, next to the city's former post office. It was built in 1908 in the Renaissance Revival style, one of the few in the city, with part of a $265,000 gift from William Wallace Smith, one of Smith Brothers cough drop makers and a YMCA member and benefactor. His gift also included a neighboring office building, since demolished. The New York City firm of Jackson & Rosencrans were the architects. In keeping with the style and era, the building features many ornamental touches, such as a molded cornice, quoins, denticulated frieze second-story balcony and domed first-floor windows. The center of the top balustrade has an elaborate cartouche. The interior likewise boasts sliding double doors, dark-stained woodwork and brick fireplaces It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The YMCA has since moved to different quarters a few blocks away and become the Dutchess County YMCA. The building, now attached to newer structures on either side, houses some county government offices and a few private businesses.

The game, telecast on ESPN, featured the San Jose State Spartans from the WAC and the hometown New Mexico Lobos from the Mountain West Conference. The game was the inaugural New Mexico Bowl and the first bowl game held in the state. San Jose State controlled the action all game long, jumping out to a 20‚Äì3 lead before New Mexico tacked on 9 points in the final few minutes. Spartan quarterback Adam Tafralis threw three touchdown passes, two to offensive MVP James Jones, in a dominant performance. With the loss, New Mexico's postseason drought was extended to 45 years. Game summary=First Quarter= The game was scoreless through the first quarter with each team punting on all of their three possessions. =Second Quarter= On the first play of the second quarter, San Jose State quarterback Adam Tafralis threw a 76-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver John Broussard who was wide open on a blown coverage. The nine second scoring drive gave San Jose State a 7-0 lead they would not relinquish. On the ensuing kickoff, New Mexico return man DeAndre Wright took the kickoff to the San Jose State 40-yard line. The Lobos used the field position to set up a first and goal at the one-yard line but fumbled on third down in the endzone after San Jose State linebacker Matt Castelo put his helmet on the ball and knocked it loose from the Lobos' Rodney Ferguson. Spartan Damaja Jones caught the ball out of the air and returned it 57 yards to the New Mexico 43, changing momentum for good in the game. After a pair punts, Tafralis connected with wide receiver James Jones who made a man miss on the sideline and went in for a 36-yard touchdown to give San Jose State a 13-0 lead. The PAT was missed. New Mexico kicker Kenny Byrd got the Lobos on the board on the following drive with a 40-yard field goal to make the score 13-3. =Third Quarter= After two punts to start the second half, New Mexico fumbled again on a crucial 4th and 1 run on their own side of the field and did not convert. On the fourth play of the ensuing Spartan drive, Tafralis took advantage with his third scoring toss of the day, connecting with James Jones for a 24-yard jump ball to increase his team's lead to 20-3. Spartans All-American defensive back Dwight Lowery returned an interception for a touchdown late in the quarter but it was wiped away by a pass interference call. =Fourth Quarter= San Jose State's defense held New Mexico's offense in check after recovering three more Lobo fumbles, and looked poised to run out the clock. Backed up deep in their end zone and leading by 17, San Jose State coach Dick Tomey elected to have punter Waylon Prather take a safety rather than risk a turnover or blocked punt, bringing the score to 20-5. With only 58 seconds remaining after a squib kick, New Mexico quarterback Chris Nelson - who replaced freshman starter Donovan Porterie for the second half - led his team down the field with three first down throws and a 15-yard scoring strike to wideout Marcus Smith, cutting the deficit to 20-12. San Jose State recovered the ensuing onside kick with 15 seconds left and knelt on the ball, capturing the inaugural New Mexico Bowl. =Scoring summary= *2nd Quarter **SJSU ‚Äì John Broussard 76-yard pass from Adam Tafralis (Jared Strubeck kick), 14:51.

The school moved back onto the Park Lane site and was reopened on 25 February 2009.  Sixth form  The school has a strong sixth form with approximately half of Year 11 staying on each year to complete A level courses. Students are required to have obtained at least five GCSE grades from A* to C in order to take up any A level course at the school's dedicated sixth form. Many A level subjects are offered at St. John Fisher Catholic High School, some of which are taught at The King's School through a collaborative arrangement.  School leadership team  The school is led by a headteacher, deputy headteacher and four assistant headteachers, plus a business manager. Each year House and School Councils, Head Boy/Girl, and Deputy Head Boy/Girl are elected by the students. Many other opportunities for students to lead are provided.  GCSE and A level results  Examination results have improved consistently at both GCSE and A level. Progress measures are especially strong and the changes to performance tables for 2016 emphasize this.  Inspection  Ofsted have visited the school many times in recent years following a dip in performance that saw the school placed in special measures from 2008 to 2010. Steady and continual improvement saw the school judged Good in October 2013. The corresponding Diocesan Inspection judged it to be an outstanding Catholic school.  Modernization When the school was given over fourteen million pounds to modernize their buildings and facilities it was felt that the school itself needed to be modernized also. The school name changed to 'St. John Fisher Catholic High School', the school timetable changed from six lessons a day to four 75-minute lessons, and a new uniform and a new school logo were added. The school opened on 25 February 2009 in their old site with new facilities, buildings and a new look. Executive head teacher Sean Hayes was appointed as permanent head teacher.

It won the Hugo Award for Best Short Fiction 1964, and the Prometheus Award for Classic Fiction (the Hall of Fame award) in 2010. The title is taken from Rudyard Kipling's poem \\"The Old Issue\\" (1899), in which kings represent tyranny or other forms of imposed rule, to be fought to preserve hard-won individual freedoms. Plot summary In a post-apocalyptic United States, the Pacific States of America are convulsed by a bloody civil war backed on one side by the \\"Espers\\", a movement that claims its followers can achieve great psychic powers. However the Espers are just a front for an even more unusual group. The story explores the balance of social forms, from feudal to super-state, and warns of the dangers of forced nation-building. It begins with the Pacific coast divided into a collection of clans with a weak central government, following some form of global war and collapse. A war breaks out, generated by people who sincerely believe that replacing the clans with a strong, overarching government is necessary for the future. Unknown to them, there are forces behind the scenes manipulating the situation through the pacifistic \\"esper\\" colonies. Eventually, the clan leaders discover that the \\"espers\\" are a fraud; they use advanced technology to perform their \\"psychic\\" acts. Knowing this, the inherent superiority of the clan system slowly defeats the regular government forces, eventually taking San Francisco. There, artillery damage reveals the great secret: one of San Francisco's skyscrapers houses an alien spacecraft. Confronting the aliens, the clansmen are told that the aliens are trying to manipulate human society into a pacifist one, without which their science predicts war and death. When told that their machinations have already resulted in war and death, the aliens plead that their science is not exact. The ensuing argument encapsulates the point of the story quite effectively; that people should be allowed to think for themselves, and form a society which they choose for themselves, rather than one chosen and imposed by an external body, no matter how wise and noble the intent. According to Jerry Pournelle's foreword in \\" Day of the Tyrant: There Will Be War vol IV \\", Poul Anderson asserted, \\"The do-gooders get their comeuppance\\". Reception Algis Budrys faulted the story as \\"a-flicker with confusing scene changes [and] stuffed with narrative compressions and a pale army of sketched characters,\\" suggesting that Anderson's conception required lengthier treatment to be successful.\\"Galaxy Bookshelf,\\" Galaxy, February 1965, p.155. However, other critical and fan acclaim has been high, with the work winning the year's Hugo award.

The film had its world premiere on January 19, 2008 at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. The film was shown at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2008, and opened in limited release in the United States on May 30, 2008. Title The * in the title refers to how athletes who are implicated in using performance-enhancing drugs have their records postfixed by an asterisk (*). The title itself refers to the Olympic motto: \\"Faster, higher, stronger\\", also a play on WWE's wrestlemania theme \\"Bigger, Better, Badder\\". The tagline also evokes the lines of the opening sequence of The Six Million Dollar Man, \\"Better, Stronger, Faster.\\" Synopsis The documentary examines the steroid use of director Christopher Bell's two brothers, Mark \\"Smelly\\" Bell and Mad Dog, who all grew up idolizing Arnold Schwarzenegger, Hulk Hogan, and Sylvester Stallone, and also features professional athletes, medical experts, fitness center members, and US Congressmen talking about the issue of anabolic steroids. Beyond the basic issue of anabolic steroid use, Bigger, Stronger, Faster* examines the lack of consistency in how the US views drugs, cheating, and the lengths people go to achieve success. The film looks beyond the steroid issue to such topics as Tiger Woods' laser eye correction to 20/15 vision, professional musicians use of blood pressure reducing drugs, or athletes' dependence on cortisone shots, which are a legal steroid. It takes a skeptical view of the health risks of steroids and is critical of the legal health supplement industry. Christopher Bell on steroid regulation: \\"If you look at all the laws in our country, and at how and why things get banned, they don‚Äôt actually fit into that category: They‚Äôre not addictive, they don‚Äôt actually kill people. I don‚Äôt condone the stuff, but after three years of researching this, it seems like we should take another look.\\" https://www.vulture.com/2008/05/filmmaker_christopher_bell_on.html Reception The film received highly positive reviews from critics. It received three out of four stars in People magazine and was marked as a 'Critic's Choice' pick (63/65 Fresh). Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 80 out of 100, based on 17 reviews. Stephen Holden of The New York Times released a positive review shortly before the film's release, noting that it takes a look at steroid use from numerous perspectives and that \\"[a]lthough the movie doesn't defend steroid use, neither does it go on the attack.\\" Holden said that the film \\"left [him] convinced that the steroid scandals will abate as the drugs are reluctantly accepted as inevitable products of a continuing revolution in biotechnology. Replaceable body parts, plastic surgery, anti-depressants, Viagra and steroids are just a few of the technological advancements in a never-ending drive to make the species superhuman.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5/4 stars, saying that it is \\"remarkable in that it seems to be interested only in facts.\\" Aftermath On December 14, 2008, Mike Bell, brother of the director Chris Bell, who was prominently featured in the film, died at 37. Christian Boeving, whose appearance in the film included the admission of steroid use, was later fired by his sponsor, MuscleTech.

Originally a training base on board the cruiser it takes its name from, it is part of the Devonport Naval Base in North Shore City, Auckland, New Zealand. History The naval base was founded in 1921 when the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy was first formed. The old cruiser HMS Philomel, with her engines and armament removed, was moored at the Admiralty reservation, Devonport Dockyard, Auckland, and re-commissioned as a naval training base. HMS Philomel has been described as the \\"Cradle of the Navy.\\" Waters, Sydney David (1956) The Royal New Zealand Navy: Official History of World War II, Appendix VIII : Record of HMNZS Philomel In October 1941, on the creation of the Royal New Zealand Navy, HMS Philomel was recommissioned as the training base HMNZS Philomel. Because of wartime demands for increased training many of her training functions were transferred, along with the ship's main mast, to a new base HMNZS Tamaki situated at Motuihe Island. Waters, Sydney David (1956) The Royal New Zealand Navy: Official History of World War II, Page 422 ref HMNZS Tamaki Over the years Philomel sprouted many creative additions on her decks in an effort to provide more space for her operations. These physical extensions then spilled over to the use of onshore buildings. In January 1947 the boat Philomel was finally decommissioned and HMNZS Philomel became a land establishment. In 2000, HMNZS Tamaki was decommissioned with its functions absorbed again by HMNZS Philomel. Current Today Philomel is a sprawling land establishment located at Devonport, New Zealand. It is the home of the Naval Support Services, responsible for the logistics and organisation of Naval personnel, and for visits to the base by foreign ships. Its Naval Community Office provides support for families of naval personnel, and its Te Taua Moana Marae is the cultural home for all naval personnel, regardless of iwi or upbringing.Official Navy website It incorporates the naval college Tamaki, formerly HMNZS Tamaki, which coordinates training within the naval base from new entry or officer training to damage control and command schools that everyone must attend at stages of their career. There are also schools for naval specialisations such as marine engineering, Officer of the Watch, hydrography and communications. The base includes a navy band and a fleet gymnasium. RNZN College  Navy museum  The first Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) museum was established in 1974 and was housed in a single room within HMNZS Philomel, then in 1982 moved to a separate building. In 2010 it moved to new, larger facilities at Torpedo Bay.

It is located 560 km north of Nairobi in Marsabit County in the former Eastern Province and its reserve is noted for its zebra population and bird sanctuary. Geography The area contains a number of extinct volcanic craters, which are covered in forests. There is a crater in the vicinity named Gof Redo, roughly north of Marsabit in the fork of the roads to Moyale and North Horr.  Flora and fauna  Zebras, buffaloes, black and white colobus, blue monkeys, bushbucks, sunis, and leopards populate the park. The park contains some 350 species of birds in total, of which 52 are birds of prey. The cliffs in the northern end of Lake Paradise, in Gof Sokorte Gurda, are home to a number of birds, including Ruppell's griffon vultures, peregrine falcons, mountain buzzards, black kites and African fish eagles. Ducks such as garganeys, southern pochards and teals are found on the lake, which is also home to red-knobbed coots, hamerkops, ibises, purple herons, and yellow-billed storks. On the lower slopes of the forest of the park, marked by scrubland, there are populations of olive baboons, vervet monkeys, Peter's gazelles, beisa oryxes, striped hyenas, caracals and aardwolves. On the road south from Mount Marsabit to the rocky plains of Shaba, Michael Palin describes passing extraordinary Strangler figs in the mountain-top forest, a stark contrast to the dusty track below which is lined by low, flat-topped acacias. The area is home to sociable weaver birds, which can be identified by their neater, tidier nests; sparrow weavers, with their \\"scruffier\\" nests; and white-bellied turacos. In the 1970s, the park achieved fame for reputedly having elephants with the longest tusks in the world. One elephant, named Ahmed, was under constant surveillance, and when he died his tusks were found to weight over 300 kg.

The school was located in the town of Ossining and overlooked the Hudson River. After the 1906 annexation of Scarborough by the village of Briarcliff Manor, Holbrook's became part of the village within Ossining. The school was founded in 1864 as Mr. Tracy's School. In 1866, after David A. Holbrook purchased the school, it became known as Dr. Holbrook's Military School. The school ran until 1915, after which it was used in World War I as a field hospital and headquarters to a New York Guard regiment. From 1919 until at least 1927, the school served as the Teachers College Country Club. History Students at the school, c. 1888 Saint Denis Institute was said to have occupied the land prior to the school. It was founded in 1864 as Mr. Tracy's School, a seminary for young women on a estate. In 1866, Reverend David A. Holbrook, PhD, purchased the school, turned it into a boys' school, and enlarged it to . It had 60 students. After Holbrook's death in December 1898, Dr. Holbrook's sons Dudley and Henry became involved with running the school. They were joined in 1899 by their brother Dwight, and ran the school until its closure as Holbrook's Preparatory School for Boys. When it closed in 1915 the school had 80 students. Shortly after the school's closure, in 1917, events in World War I led the New York Guard's First Provisional Regiment (1,500 men operating under Colonel John B. Rose) to guard the Croton Aqueduct. Captain Charles W. Baldwin, Chaplain of the regiment and Rector of Saint Mary's Episcopal Church in Scarborough and also in present-day Briarcliff Manor, arranged a deal with V. Everit Macy, then the owner of the school estate, for free use of the campus and buildings until three months after the war's end. The regiment, originally headquartered at Pines Bridge Inn on Croton Lake, moved its headquarters to the Holbrook Military Academy, and the academic building at the school became Field Hospital No. 2 of the Atlantic Division of the American Red Cross. The ground floor of the west wing and the mess hall on the first floor was turned into a large, well-heated office with glass-partitioned private offices, and equipped with typewriters and mimeograph machines. The new regimental office had strong contrast with their Pines Bridge Inn office, it having been drafty, dirt-floored and poorly-lit. The site opened for their use on October 8, 1918, and the regiment fully demobilized on February 1, 1919. A reunion was held at the former school grounds for many of the troops from March 23 to 25, 1919. In June 1919, V. Everit Macy gave the property, buildings, and $7,500 for remodeling to the Teachers College Country Club; Macy was chairman of the college's board of trustees at the time. The club was founded on October 4, 1919 and initially used a building called Hill Cottage, which it outgrew shortly thereafter. The club opened there on September 1, 1919 and existed there until at least 1927. Presidents included Henry C. Pearson (1919‚Äì21), Jesse C. Williams (1921‚Äì23), Walter H. Eddy (1923‚Äì25), and Edward S. Evanden (1925). Walter W. Law gave the club's members (which numbered 200 in 1920) the right to use Briarcliff Manor's 9-hole golf course, the present-day Trump National Golf Club. Curricula The school as the First Provisional Regiment headquarters In 1903 the school consisted of six forms, the first two making up the lower school and the remaining four making up the upper school; in the upper school students chose from three curricula: classical, Latin-scientific, or English- scientific. Students received grades for deportment, application, spelling, declamation and composition, church attendance, and skill at military drill, as well as in classes where they learned arithmetic, algebra, French, Latin, German, and Greek. Sports included baseball, football, tennis, hockey, track, athletics, and golf. The school issued a merit roll every four weeks, where students were ranked on conduct, lessons and attendance. Notable people George Whipple George Whipple, a physician and pathologist, was a teacher at the school for a year before he started work at Johns Hopkins University. Notable students include Donn Barber, an architect, Nelson Doubleday, a publisher, Edward Avery McIlhenny, a businessman, explorer, and conservationist, John Avery McIlhenny, a businessman, soldier, politician, and public servant, Harold Medina, a lawyer, teacher and judge, and John W. Norton, a muralist and easel artist.

It is based on the childhood memories of Frouke Fokkema, who wrote the script together with Koolhoven. The film featured Van Houten in her first leading role; she would work again with Koolhoven on the films AmnesiA and Brimstone. Plot The film is set in the sixties and revolves around the teenager Suzy, who is part of an uncaring family: father is abusive and unemployed, mother is naive, one brother is the brooding type while the other is habitually stoned. Suzy surreptitiously manages to gain access to the hotel room of Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull during their visit to Amsterdam. Suzy gets kissed by her idol Jagger and wants to tell the world, but nobody believes her or even wants to hear the story. Background The film is a joint production of Staccato Films and the Dutch public broadcasting service. The title refers to the Rolling Stones' cover of the Dale Hawkins song Susie Q. Suzy Q won various awards - amongst which a Gouden Kalf for Van Houten - and was the most decorated Dutch film of 1999, which is all the more notable since the film was made for TV. Due to the frequent use of music by the likes of The Rolling Stones, The Turtles, Jimi Hendrix, Tee Set and Booker T & the MG's, the film was never released in cinemas or on DVD. In 2014, to save his project from obscurity, Martin Koolhoven published the film on YouTube. He also asked for the film to be distributed via torrent sites, which promptly happened.

Waldsch√ºtz (dir.), Gro√ües Werklexikon der Philosophie, vol. 1, Stuttgart, 1999, \\"Fredegisus Turonensis\\", p. 511 An Anglo-Saxon, he was a pupil of Alcuin, first at York and afterwards at the court of Charlemagne in Aachen. The approximate date of his birth is determined by a reference to him as \\"a boy\\" (puer) in a letter of Alcuin dated 798. He was a favourite pupil of Alcuin and was one of the group of distinguished scholars who formed the Schola palatina in Aachen, in which he was known by the name Nathaniel. Fr√©degis de Tours. At that time he was a deacon. When, in 796, Alcuin became abbot of Marmoutier Abbey, Tours, Fridugisus seems to have remained at the court. According to some authorities he was Alcuin's successor as Master of the Palace School. This is, however, improbable. In 804 he succeeded his teacher as abbot of Marmoutier Abbey at Tours, retaining at the same time his relations with the emperor. Among his contemporaries he enjoyed a reputation for great learning. He composed several poems. He also wrote a short treatise in epistolary form, which deals with the nature of nothing and darkness, De nihilo et tenebris.PDF here The epistle was written probably during the author's residence at Tours. It is addressed \\"to all the faithful and to those who dwell in the sacred Palace of the most serene prince Charles\\". It dealt with the question, are nothing and darkness real things? (Some suggest that this was inspired by the Biblical use of the words in the first chapter of the Book of Genesis). If the Bible uses the words \\"nothing\\" and \\"darkness\\", it seemed that there must be things corresponding to those words. Fridugisus accepts this answer and defends it both by arguments from authority and by arguments from reason. In F. A. Lange‚Äôs History of Materialism, First Book, Second Section, Chapter 2, he mentioned that Fridugisus confused \\"subjective and objective elements in our conception of things.\\" Lange wrote, \\"We find an interesting example of this [confusion] in Fredegisus [sic], a pupil of Alcuin‚Äôs, who honoured Charles the Great with a theological epistle 'De Nihilo et Tenebris [Of Nothing and Darkness]', in which that 'Nothing' out of which God created the world is explained as an actually existing entity, and that for the extremely simple reason that every name refers to some corresponding thing.\\" In this way, Fridugisus mistook a name (Nothing) that existed in his brain for something in the world outside his brain. That his solution, however, was not generally accepted is clear from the opening words of the treatise, in which he refers to the long prevailing divergence of opinion in the matter. The treatise makes use of the dialectical method which was afterwards developed into the scholastic method by Abelard, Alexander of Hales, and Saint Thomas Aquinas. He also took part in controversies against Agobard de Lyon.

The attack took place in the city of Tarn√≥w in Poland of the interwar period, ahead of the joint invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The time bomb planted by the secret agent exploded inside the station on the night of 28 August 1939, killing 20 people and wounding 35 others. The population of Tarn√≥w in 1939 was around 40,000. The busy train station of Tarn√≥w G≈Ç√≥wny (Tarn√≥w Central) was located on the railway line connecting two major agglomerations in southern Poland, Krak√≥w to the west and Lw√≥w to the east. Trains passed through Tarn√≥w carrying thousands of travellers. The threat of imminent conflict with Germany added to the awaiting crowd many army reserve soldiers ordered to report to their units, as the international situation worsened day by day. The dense traffic was halted abruptly at 11:18 p.m., when a time bomb left by a German saboteur, Anton Guzy, exploded in the waiting hall. Twenty people at the station died instantly. It has been argued by commentators that the world war had just began. Attack The saboteur who planted the bomb ‚Äì a man named Antoni (Anton) Guzy from Bielsko ‚Äì was the son of a German mother and a Polish father. His father died during World War I, and in 1938 Guzy, a locksmith, became unemployed. In search of a job, he joined the Gewerkschaft Deutscher Arbeiter, a local organization which helped to organize employment in Germany. It was probably through this agency that he was persuaded to carry out the attack. Guzy travelled to Tarn√≥w from Gliwice with the man named Neumann. He left two suitcases packed with explosives in the luggage hall and went to a platform to wait for a night Luxtorpeda train from Krynica, via Tarn√≥w, to Krak√≥w, which, according to the schedule, would leave at 11:02 p.m. It is speculated that Guzy might not have known when the bomb would explode. He drank a beer at the station's restaurant, before taking a walk around the station. When the explosion took place, the saboteur, together with other passengers ran away in panic. Reportedly, his German masters might have planned for him to die in the attack. The number of victims would have been much higher, had it not been for a stopping train from Krak√≥w, which arrived eight minutes late. Also, a few minutes before the attack, a military transport with numerous soldiers had left the Tarn√≥w station. Approximately one-third of the station building was destroyed. Rail workers and policemen spent hours searching for victims in the rubble. It is impossible to reconstruct all the details of the attack. At 11:30 a.m. Guzy met a man from Skocz√≥w named Neuman (given name unknown to him), who was a member of a German saboteur organization. Together, they went by rail to Krak√≥w, leaving Bielsko-Bia≈Ça station at 12:13 p.m. In Krak√≥w they had coffee, and later took two heavy suitcases from a station's luggage office. According to Guzy's later statement, Neuman told him to leave both cases at the Tarn√≥w station and return to Krak√≥w, where he would be waiting. After the explosion, Guzy was stopped by the railroad police, asked for his identity papers and released. Stopped again near the station, he was recognised as the man who had left the suitcases. During the interrogation he said that he felt sorry about what had happened, and that he had never received any money. Guzy's subsequent fate is uncertain. The German investigation conducted in 1941 concluded that he was shot in the first days of September 1939, before invading Germans reached the area.

The difference between well and cistern is in the source of the water A well is an excavation or structure created in the ground by digging, driving, or drilling to access liquid resources, usually water. The oldest and most common kind of well is a water well, to access groundwater in underground aquifers. The well water is drawn up by a pump, or using containers, such as buckets, that are raised mechanically or by hand. Water can also be injected back into the aquifer through the well. Wells were first constructed at least eight thousand years ago and historically vary in construction from a simple scoop in the sediment of a dry watercourse to the qanats of Iran, and the stepwells and sakiehs of India. Placing a lining in the well shaft helps create stability, and linings of wood or wickerwork date back at least as far as the Iron Age. Wells have traditionally been sunk by hand digging, as is the case in rural areas of the developing world. These wells are inexpensive and low-tech as they use mostly manual labour, and the structure can be lined with brick or stone as the excavation proceeds. A more modern method called caissoning uses pre-cast reinforced concrete well rings that are lowered into the hole. Driven wells can be created in unconsolidated material with a well hole structure, which consists of a hardened drive point and a screen of perforated pipe, after which a pump is installed to collect the water. Deeper wells can be excavated by hand drilling methods or machine drilling, using a bit in a borehole. Drilled wells are usually cased with a factory-made pipe composed of steel or plastic. Drilled wells can access water at much greater depths than dug wells. Two broad classes of well are shallow or unconfined wells completed within the uppermost saturated aquifer at that location, and deep or confined wells, sunk through an impermeable stratum into an aquifer beneath. A collector well can be constructed adjacent to a freshwater lake or stream with water percolating through the intervening material. The site of a well can be selected by a hydrogeologist, or groundwater surveyor. Water may be pumped or hand drawn. Impurities from the surface can easily reach shallow sources and contamination of the supply by pathogens or chemical contaminants needs to be avoided. Well water typically contains more minerals in solution than surface water and may require treatment before being potable. Soil salination can occur as the water table falls and the surrounding soil begins to dry out. Another environmental problem is the potential for methane to seep into the water. History Camel drawing water from a well, Djerba island, Tunisia Wood-lined wells are known from the early Neolithic Linear Pottery culture, for example in Ostrov, Czech Republic, dated 5265 BC, K√ºckhoven (an outlying centre of Erkelenz), dated 5090 BC and Eythra, dated 5200 BC in Schletz (an outlying centre of Asparn an der Zaya) in Austria. Some of the earliest evidence of water wells are located in China. The neolithic Chinese discovered and made extensive use of deep drilled groundwater for drinking. The Chinese text The Book of Changes, originally a divination text of the Western Zhou dynasty (1046 -771 BC), contains an entry describing how the ancient Chinese maintained their wells and protected their sources of water. Archaeological evidence and old Chinese documents reveal that the prehistoric and ancient Chinese had the aptitude and skills for digging deep water wells for drinking water as early as 6000 to 7000 years ago. A well excavated at the Hemedu excavation site was believed to have been built during the neolithic era. The well was cased by four rows of logs with a square frame attached to them at the top of the well. 60 additional tile wells southwest of Beijing are also believed to have been built around 600 BC for drinking and irrigation. A Chinese ceramic model of a well with a water pulley system, excavated from a tomb of the Han Dynasty (202 BC - 220 AD) period In Egypt, shadoofs and sakias are used. The sakia is much more efficient, as it can bring up water from a depth of 10 metres (versus the 3 metres of the shadoof). The sakia is the Egyptian version of the noria. Some of the world's oldest known wells, located in Cyprus, date to 9000-10,500 BC. Two wells from the Neolithic period, around 6500 BC, have been discovered in Israel. One is in Atlit, on the northern coast of Israel, and the other is the Jezreel Valley. Wells for other purposes came along much later, historically. The first recorded salt well was dug in the Sichuan province of China around 2,250 years ago. This was the first time that ancient water well technology was applied successfully for the exploitation of salt, and marked the beginning of Sichuan's salt drilling industry. The earliest known oil wells were also drilled in China, in 347 CE. These wells had depths of up to about and were drilled using bits attached to bamboo poles. The oil was burned to evaporate brine and produce salt. By the 10th century, extensive bamboo pipelines connected oil wells with salt springs. The ancient records of China and Japan are said to contain many allusions to the use of natural gas for lighting and heating. Petroleum was known as Burning water in Japan in the 7th century. Types Water well near Simaisma, eastern Qatar right Well, Historical Village, Bhaini Sahib, Ludhiana, Punjab, India =Dug wells= View into a hand-dug well cased with concrete rings; Ouelessebougou, Mali. A dug well in a village in Kerala, India. Until recent centuries, all artificial wells were pumpless hand-dug wells of varying degrees of sophistication, and they remain a very important source of potable water in some rural developing areas where they are routinely dug and used today. Their indispensability has produced a number of literary references, literal and figurative, to them, including the reference to the incident of Jesus meeting a woman at Jacob's well (John 4:6) in the bible and the \\"Ding Dong Bell\\" nursery rhyme about a cat in a well. Hand-dug wells are excavations with diameters large enough to accommodate one or more people with shovels digging down to below the water table. The excavation is braced horizontally to avoid landslide or erosion endangering the people digging. They can be lined with laid stones or brick; extending this lining upwards above the ground surface to form a wall around the well serves to reduce both contamination and injuries by falling into the well. A more modern method called caissoning uses reinforced concrete or plain concrete pre-cast well rings that are lowered into the hole. A well-digging team digs under a cutting ring and the well column slowly sinks into the aquifer, whilst protecting the team from collapse of the well bore. Hand-dug wells are inexpensive and low tech (compared to drilling) as they use mostly manual labour to access groundwater in rural locations in developing countries. They may be built with a high degree of community participation, or by local entrepreneurs who specialize in hand-dug wells. They have been successfully excavated to . They have low operational and maintenance costs, in part because water can be extracted by hand bailing, without a pump. The water is often coming from an aquifer or groundwater, and can be easily deepened, which may be necessary if the ground water level drops, by telescoping the lining further down into the aquifer. The yield of existing hand dug wells may be improved by deepening or introducing vertical tunnels or perforated pipes. Drawbacks to hand-dug wells are numerous. It can be impractical to hand dig wells in areas where hard rock is present, and they can be time-consuming to dig and line even in favourable areas. Because they exploit shallow aquifers, the well may be susceptible to yield fluctuations and possible contamination from surface water, including sewage. Hand dug well construction generally requires the use of a well trained construction team, and the capital investment for equipment such as concrete ring moulds, heavy lifting equipment, well shaft formwork, motorized de-watering pumps, and fuel can be large for people in developing countries. Construction of hand dug wells can be dangerous due to collapse of the well bore, falling objects and asphyxiation, including from dewatering pump exhaust fumes. The Woodingdean Water Well, hand-dug between 1858 and 1862, is the deepest hand-dug well at . The Big Well in Greensburg, Kansas is billed as the world's largest hand-dug well, at deep and in diameter. However, the Well of Joseph in the Cairo Citadel at deep and the Pozzo di S. Patrizio (St. Patrick's Well) built in 1527 in Orvieto, Italy, at deep by wide are both larger by volume. =Driven wells= Driven wells may be very simply created in unconsolidated material with a well hole structure, which consists of a hardened drive point and a screen (perforated pipe). The point is simply hammered into the ground, usually with a tripod and driver, with pipe sections added as needed. A driver is a weighted pipe that slides over the pipe being driven and is repeatedly dropped on it. When groundwater is encountered, the well is washed of sediment and a pump installed.\\"How I drill a Well.\\" Popular Science, April 1952, pp. 177-181. =Drilled wells= Drilled wells are typically created using either top-head rotary style, table rotary, or cable tool drilling machines, all of which use drilling stems that are turned to create a cutting action in the formation, hence the term drilling. Drilled wells can be excavated by simple hand drilling methods (augering, sludging, jetting, driving, hand percussion) or machine drilling (rotary, percussion, down the hole hammer). Deeprock rotary drilling method is most common. Rotary can be used in 90% of formation types. Drilled wells can get water from a much deeper level than dug wells can‚Äîoften down to several hundred metres. Drilled wells with electric pumps are used throughout the world, typically in rural or sparsely populated areas, though many urban areas are supplied partly by municipal wells. Most shallow well drilling machines are mounted on large trucks, trailers, or tracked vehicle carriages. Water wells typically range from deep, but in some areas can go deeper than . Cable tool water well drilling rig in Kimball, West Virginia Water well drilling in Ein Hemed, near Jerusalem circa 1964 Rotary drilling machines use a segmented steel drilling string, typically made up of sections of galvanized steel tubing that are threaded together, with a bit or other drilling device at the bottom end. Some rotary drilling machines are designed to install (by driving or drilling) a steel casing into the well in conjunction with the drilling of the actual bore hole. Air and/or water is used as a circulation fluid to displace cuttings and cool bits during the drilling. Another form of rotary-style drilling, termed mud rotary, makes use of a specially made mud, or drilling fluid, which is constantly being altered during the drill so that it can consistently create enough hydraulic pressure to hold the side walls of the bore hole open, regardless of the presence of a casing in the well. Typically, boreholes drilled into solid rock are not cased until after the drilling process is completed, regardless of the machinery used. The oldest form of drilling machinery is the cable tool, still used today. Specifically designed to raise and lower a bit into the bore hole, the spudding of the drill causes the bit to be raised and dropped onto the bottom of the hole, and the design of the cable causes the bit to twist at approximately revolution per drop, thereby creating a drilling action. Unlike rotary drilling, cable tool drilling requires the drilling action to be stopped so that the bore hole can be bailed or emptied of drilled cuttings. Drilled wells are usually cased with a factory-made pipe, typically steel (in air rotary or cable tool drilling) or plastic/PVC (in mud rotary wells, also present in wells drilled into solid rock). The casing is constructed by welding, either chemically or thermally, segments of casing together. If the casing is installed during the drilling, most drills will drive the casing into the ground as the bore hole advances, while some newer machines will actually allow for the casing to be rotated and drilled into the formation in a similar manner as the bit advancing just below. PVC or plastic is typically welded and then lowered into the drilled well, vertically stacked with their ends nested and either glued or splined together. The sections of casing are usually or more in length, and in diameter, depending on the intended use of the well and local groundwater conditions. Surface contamination of wells in the United States is typically controlled by the use of a surface seal. A large hole is drilled to a predetermined depth or to a confining formation (clay or bedrock, for example), and then a smaller hole for the well is completed from that point forward. The well is typically cased from the surface down into the smaller hole with a casing that is the same diameter as that hole. The annular space between the large bore hole and the smaller casing is filled with bentonite clay, concrete, or other sealant material. This creates an impermeable seal from the surface to the next confining layer that keeps contaminants from traveling down the outer sidewalls of the casing or borehole and into the aquifer. In addition, wells are typically capped with either an engineered well cap or seal that vents air through a screen into the well, but keeps insects, small animals, and unauthorized persons from accessing the well. At the bottom of wells, based on formation, a screening device, filter pack, slotted casing, or open bore hole is left to allow the flow of water into the well. Constructed screens are typically used in unconsolidated formations (sands, gravels, etc.), allowing water and a percentage of the formation to pass through the screen. Allowing some material to pass through creates a large area filter out of the rest of the formation, as the amount of material present to pass into the well slowly decreases and is removed from the well. Rock wells are typically cased with a PVC liner/casing and screen or slotted casing at the bottom, this is mostly present just to keep rocks from entering the pump assembly. Some wells utilize a filter pack method, where an undersized screen or slotted casing is placed inside the well and a filter medium is packed around the screen, between the screen and the borehole or casing. This allows the water to be filtered of unwanted materials before entering the well and pumping zone. Image:Jet-pump System.svgAn automated water well system powered by a jet-pump.

There are two broad classes of drilled-well types, based on the type of aquifer the well is in: *Shallow or unconfined wells are completed in the uppermost saturated aquifer at that location (the upper unconfined aquifer). *Deep or confined wells are sunk through an impermeable stratum into an aquifer that is sandwiched between two impermeable strata (aquitards or aquicludes). The majority of deep aquifers are classified as artesian because the hydraulic head in a confined well is higher than the level of the top of the aquifer. If the hydraulic head in a confined well is higher than the land surface it is a \\"flowing\\" artesian well (named after Artois in France). A special type of water well may be constructed adjacent to freshwater lakes or streams. Commonly called a collector well but sometimes referred to by the trade name Ranney well or Ranney collector, this type of well involves sinking a caisson vertically below the top of the aquifer and then advancing lateral collectors out of the caisson and beneath the surface water body. Pumping from within the caisson induces infiltration of water from the surface water body into the aquifer, where it is collected by the collector well laterals and conveyed into the caisson where it can be pumped to the ground surface. Two additional broad classes of well types may be distinguished, based on the use of the well: * production or pumping wells, are large diameter (greater than 15 cm in diameter) cased (metal, plastic, or concrete) water wells, constructed for extracting water from the aquifer by a pump (if the well is not artesian). * monitoring wells or piezometers, are often smaller diameter wells used to monitor the hydraulic head or sample the groundwater for chemical constituents. Piezometers are monitoring wells completed over a very short section of aquifer. Monitoring wells can also be completed at multiple levels, allowing discrete samples or measurements to be made at different vertical elevations at the same map location. A well constructed for pumping groundwater can be used passively as a monitoring well and a small diameter well can be pumped, but this distinction by use is common. Siting Before excavation, information about the geology, water table depth, seasonal fluctuations, recharge area and rate must be found. This work is typically done by a hydrogeologist, or a groundwater surveyor using a variety of tools including electro-seismic surveying, any available information from nearby wells, geologic maps, and sometimes geophysical imaging. Contamination Waterborne diseases can be spread via a well which is contaminated with fecal pathogens from pit latrines Man cleaning a well in Yaound√©, Cameroon. Hand pump to pump water from a well in a village near Chennai in India, where the well water might be polluted by nearby pit latrines Shallow pumping wells can often supply drinking water at a very low cost. However, impurities from the surface easily reach shallow sources, which leads to a greater risk of contamination for these wells compared to deeper wells. Contaminated wells can lead to the spread of various waterborne diseases. Dug and driven wells are relatively easy to contaminate; for instance, most dug wells are unreliable in the majority of the United States. = Pathogens = Most of the bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi that contaminate well water comes from fecal material from humans and other animals, for example from on-site sanitation systems (such as pit latrines and septic tanks). Common bacterial contaminants include E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter jejuni. Common viral contaminants include norovirus, sapovirus, rotavirus, enteroviruses, and hepatitis A and E. Parasites include Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora cayetanensis, and microsporidia. = Chemical contamination = Chemical contamination is a common problem with groundwater. Nitrates from sewage, sewage sludge or fertilizer are a particular problem for babies and young children. Pollutant chemicals include pesticides and volatile organic compounds from gasoline, dry-cleaning, the fuel additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and perchlorate from rocket fuel, airbag inflators, and other artificial and natural sources. Several minerals are also contaminants, including lead leached from brass fittings or old lead pipes, chromium VI from electroplating and other sources, naturally occurring arsenic, radon, and uranium--all of which can cause cancer--and naturally occurring fluoride, which is desirable in low quantities to prevent tooth decay, but can cause dental fluorosis in higher concentrations. Some chemicals are commonly present in water wells at levels that are not toxic, but can cause other problems. Calcium and magnesium cause what is known as hard water, which can precipitate and clog pipes or burn out water heaters. Iron and manganese can appear as dark flecks that stain clothing and plumbing, and can promote the growth of iron and manganese bacteria that can form slimy black colonies that clog pipes. = Prevention = The quality of the well water can be significantly increased by lining the well, sealing the well head, fitting a self-priming hand pump, constructing an apron, ensuring the area is kept clean and free from stagnant water and animals, moving sources of contamination (pit latrines, garbage pits, on-site sewer systems) and carrying out hygiene education. The well should be cleaned with 1% chlorine solution after construction and periodically every 6 months. Well holes should be covered to prevent loose debris, animals, animal excrement, and wind-blown foreign matter from falling into the hole and decomposing. The cover should be able to be in place at all times, including when drawing water from the well. A suspended roof over an open hole helps to some degree, but ideally the cover should be tight fitting and fully enclosing, with only a screened air vent. Minimum distances and soil percolation requirements between sewage disposal sites and water wells need to be observed. Rules regarding the design and installation of private and municipal septic systems take all these factors into account so that nearby drinking water sources are protected. Education of the general population in society also plays an important role in protecting drinking water. =Mitigation= Cleanup of contaminated groundwater tends to be very costly. Effective remediation of groundwater is generally very difficult. Contamination of groundwater from surface and subsurface sources can usually be dramatically reduced by correctly centering the casing during construction and filling the casing annulus with an appropriate sealing material. The sealing material (grout) should be placed from immediately above the production zone back to surface, because, in the absence of a correctly constructed casing seal, contaminated fluid can travel into the well through the casing annulus. Centering devices are important (usually 1 per length of casing or at maximum intervals of 9 m) to ensure that the grouted annular space is of even thickness. Upon the construction of a new test well, it is considered best practice to invest in a complete battery of chemical and biological tests on the well water in question. Point-of-use treatment is available for individual properties and treatment plants are often constructed for municipal water supplies that suffer from contamination. Most of these treatment methods involve the filtration of the contaminants of concern, and additional protection may be garnered by installing well-casing screens only at depths where contamination is not present. Well water for personal use is often filtered with reverse osmosis water processors; this process can remove very small particles. A simple, effective way of killing microorganisms is to bring the water to a full boil for one to three minutes, depending on location. A household well contaminated by microorganisms can initially be treated by shock chlorination using bleach, generating concentrations hundreds of times greater than found in community water systems; however, this will not fix any structural problems that led to the contamination and generally requires some expertise and testing for effective application. After the filtration process, it is common to implement an Ultraviolet (UV) system to kill pathogens in the water. UV light effects the DNA of the pathogen by UV-C photons breaking through the cell wall. UV disinfection has been gaining popularity in the past decades as it is a chemical free method of water treatment. Environmental problems A risk with the placement of water wells is soil salination which occurs when the water table of the soil begins to drop and salt begins to accumulate as the soil begins to dry out. Another environmental problem that is very prevalent in water well drilling is the potential for methane to seep through. =Soil salination= The potential for soil salination is a large risk when choosing the placement of water wells. Soil salination is caused when the water table of the soil drops over time and salt begins to accumulate. In turn, the increased amount of salt begins to dry the soil out. This is a very detrimental problem because the increased level of salt in the soil can result in the degradation of soil and can be very harmful to vegetation. =Methane= Methane, an asphyxiant, is a chemical compound that is the main component of natural gas. When methane is introduced into a confined space, it displaces oxygen, reducing oxygen concentration to a level low enough to pose a threat to humans and other aerobic organisms but still high enough for a risk of spontaneous or externally caused explosion. This potential for explosion is what poses such a danger in regards to the drilling and placement of water wells. Low levels of methane in drinking water are not considered toxic. When methane seeps into a water supply, it is commonly referred to as \\"methane migration\\". This can be caused by old natural gas wells near water well systems becoming abandoned and no longer monitored. Lately, however, the described wells/pumps are no longer very efficient and can be replaced by either handpumps or treadle pumps. Another alternative is the use of self-dug wells, electrical deep-well pumps (for higher depths). Appropriate technology organizations as Practical Action are now supplying information on how to build/set-up (DIY) handpumps and treadle pumps in practice. Water use, Tacuinum Sanitatis, Biblioteca Casanatense (14th century) Society and culture Springs and wells have had cultural significance since prehistoric times, leading to the foundation of towns such as Wells and Bath in Somerset. Interest in health benefits led to the growth of spa towns including many with wells in their name, examples being Llandrindod Wells and Royal Tunbridge Wells. Eratosthenes is sometimes claimed to have used a well in his calculation of the Earth's circumference; however, this is just a simplification used in a shorter explanation of Cleomedes, since Eratosthenes had used a more elaborate and precise method. Many incidents in the Bible take place around wells, such as the finding of a wife for Isaac in Genesis and Jesus's talk with the Samaritan woman in the Gospels.

Perot was a Texas industrialist who had never served as a public official, but he had experience as the head of several successful corporations and had been involved in public affairs for the previous three decades. Grass-root organizations sprang up in every state to help Perot achieve ballot access following his announcement on the February 20, 1992 edition of Larry King Live. James Stockdale, a retired Navy vice admiral, was Perot's running mate. Perot focused the campaign on his plans to balance the federal budget, further economic nationalism, strengthen the war on drugs, and implement \\"electronic town halls\\" throughout the nation for \\"direct democracy\\". His views were described as a combination of \\"East Texas populism with high-tech wizardry\\". Supporters saw him as a non-political and witty \\"folk hero\\", but critics described him as \\"authoritarian\\" and \\"short- tempered\\".Gilbert and King, p. 213 Perot largely financed his own campaign and relied on marketing and wide grass roots support. In certain polls, he led the three-way race with Republican nominee George H. W. Bush, the incumbent President, and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic nominee. He dropped out in July 1992 amid controversy, but re-entered in October, participating in all three presidential debates. His polling numbers never fully recovered from his initial exit, despite his aggressive use of commercials on prime-time television. Perot appeared on every state ballot as a result of the earlier draft efforts. He won several counties, finished in second place in two states, and finished in third place overall, receiving close to 18.97 percent of the popular vote, the most won by a third-party presidential candidate since Theodore Roosevelt in 1912. Background Perot stands next to a portrait of George Washington at his office in 1986. Ross Perot had never been elected to public office, but he ran several successful corporations and was involved in public affairs for decades. After serving in the United States Navy in the 1950s, Perot joined IBM as a salesman. He surpassed his one-year sales quota in just two weeks. After the company ignored his idea for electronic storage, he founded Electronic Data Systems in 1962, which was then contracted by the United States government to store Medicare records. Perot earned a fortune with the company, and by 1968 was named by Fortune as the \\"fastest, richest Texan.\\"Elkind, p. 100 Perot was known to run the company in a militaristic fashion, built on loyalty and duty. His best known venture with the company was in 1979, when he sent a private militia into Iran in the midst of the Iranian Revolution to rescue two of his employees who had been imprisoned. The episode inspired the 1983 novel, On Wings of Eagles. Perot eventually sold his company to General Motors in 1984 for $2.55 billion, and founded Perot Systems in 1988. By 1992, his fortune was judged to be $3 billion. Perot was a hawk on the Vietnam War, an advocate for U.S. servicemen held as prisoner of war and a supporter of their families. During the war, he aided soldiers by providing supplies and holding rallies for those returning home. In public affairs, he led the Texas War on Drugs Committee in 1979 at the behest of Republican Governor Bill Clements, and was put in charge of the Select Committee on Public Education in 1983 by Democratic Governor Mark White. Perot's most dear political effort involved the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue. He worked extensively to free soldiers that he believed had been left behind, and even engaged in secret diplomatic talks with the Vietnamese government, to the chagrin of the Reagan White House. Perot had been supportive of President Ronald Reagan and labeled him as a \\"great president\\" in 1986. He even pledged $2.5 million to support his presidential library, but the relationship soured after Perot was sent on a trip to Hanoi, and determined afterwards that the administration was not taking the POW/MIA issue seriously. He revoked his pledge to the library in 1987, based on the POW/MIA issue as well as his disillusionment from the administration's actions during the Iran‚ÄìContra affair. He became a critic of the George H. W. Bush administration, and opposed the 1991 Gulf War. Initial campaign Ross Perot appeared on the February 20, 1992, edition of Larry King Live on CNN, his fourth appearance on the show since 1991.Wakin, p. 196 After a lively interview concerning political issues, King directly asked Perot if there was \\"any scenario in which [he] would run for president.\\" Perot firmly stated that he did not want to run, but spontaneously affirmed that he would begin a campaign if \\"ordinary people\\" signed petitions and helped him achieve ballot access in all 50 states.Kurtz, p. 90 He set up a phone bank at his office on March 12, staffed with volunteers to inform interested voters and supporters on how they could assist Perot's potential campaign. Supporters viewed the candidate as an \\"action man ... who can get things done ... [and who] takes care of his people\\". They were angry at President Bush for reneging on his promise not to raise taxes. The New York Times speculated that Perot's \\"iconoclastic, take-no-prisoners persona and anti-politics politics\\" would appeal to the \\"angry frustrated electorate\\". But Republican consultant Karl Rove characterized Perot as an \\"untested wild man\\". He rejected any financial donations for more than $5, and stated that he would personally fund a potential campaign. Perot spent $400,000 of his own money in the first month, however, he largely spread this message via television, capped by a March 18 National Press Club speech, which aired on C-SPAN.Jelen, p. 17 =Draft efforts= Perot's running mate James B. Stockdale \\"Draft Perot\\" organizations opened throughout the nation, and petition drives were coordinated largely by Perot's friend Tom Luce,Jelen, p. 18 and the real estate arm of Perot Systems,Jelen, p. 36 to help secure a place for the candidate on every state ballot. At the height of the efforts, 18,000 simultaneous calls came into Perot's telephone banks after he appeared on the Phil Donahue Show. At one point, 30,000 telephone calls were received in one hour. MCI Communications Corporation reported that over a million calls came in during the first ten days that the phone banks were active. At the time, presidential polls showed Perot with 21% support from the electorate, 14 points behind likely Democratic presidential nominee Bill Clinton and 16 points behind President Bush. Despite this, only one third of potential voters knew enough about Perot to form an opinion of him. A large segment of his support came from Reagan Democrats, entrepreneurs and suburban conservatives deemed \\"Perot Republicans\\", who agreed with the central theme of his campaign, though they disagreed with his pro-choice stance on abortion. Political newcomers were also involved in the volunteer efforts. Twenty-five states required that a presidential candidate have a running mate to appear on the ballot. As a result, Perot named retired Vice Admiral James B. Stockdale, who had been awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during years of captivity as a POW during the Vietnam War, as his \\"interim\\" running mate in late March. Stockdale would remain in the position throughout the campaign. A Boston Globe report suggested that Boston University President John Silber was also considered as a running mate. During an Associated Press interview in April, Perot commented that he might begin a campaign before his supporters achieved ballot access in all states. In New York, ballot access appeared to be the most difficult to attain. In a five- week summer period, the campaign would be required to compile 20,000 signatures from non-primary voters, including 100 from each of half of the state's Congressional districts. Perot conceded that he might not appear on the state's ballot, but stated that he may run anyway. Throughout April, the draft efforts continued, and Perot appeared on talk shows, discussing his plans and positions on political issues. During an appearance on Larry King Live, Perot stated that he was closer to a decision on a potential campaign, and that he was willing to spend $100 million of his own money to finance it. On the Today Show he was interviewed by Katie Couric, and proposed to cut Medicare and Social Security for \\"people who don't need it\\". He appeared on Face the Nation later in the month, and argued that wealthy Americans should spend more than average Americans to eliminate the budget deficit. His budget numbers were contested by Tim Russert on Meet the Press, during a heated interview, after which, a frustrated Perot considered dropping out of the race. C-SPAN ran a speech by Perot, where he announced that he hoped to run a campaign without \\"political pros\\" to avoid the \\"dirty tricks\\" of past campaigns. After this appearance, campaign consultant Raymond Strother explained to Perot that professionals such as pollster Mark Penn were essential to a successful campaign. In late April, Perot hired former Chicago Tribune editor James Squires as press spokesman to handle the large volume of interview requests from the media. At the end of the month, Perot realized that he had spent too much time visiting talk shows, and announced that he would spend his next few weeks focusing on the issues. =Frontrunner status= By May, Perot was leading presidential polls in both Texas and California. The Bush and Clinton campaigns became concerned about a candidacy, and publicly wondered if Perot could continue to \\"play by his own rules\\". They attempted to downgrade Perot from his \\"folk hero status\\" to that of a politician, by highlighting his \\"alleged character flaws\\". Meanwhile, Perot focused on sharpening his political positions as he promised. He hired John P. White, who served as a budget official under President Jimmy Carter, to work on his budget platform. Meanwhile, petition drives in every state reported that they had secured enough signatures to place Perot on the Election Day ballot. Speculation arose in the media that Perot would split the electoral college and force the United States House of Representatives to decide the presidency. Around this time, Hal Riney, who had worked on Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign and was known for the \\"Morning in America\\" ad, was hired as advertising consultant. When Riney revealed the cost of advertisements during a meeting, Perot reportedly \\"flipped out\\", and asked \\"Why would I spend that when I could go on the Today show for free?\\" Riney produced several ads during the campaign that never aired. Perot won a large share of the vote in both the Democratic and Republican primaries in Oregon and Washington in mid-May, although he did not campaign or advertise for those contests. In the Oregon primary, he was written-in by 13% of Democrats and 15% of Republicans. Exit polling showed Perot's favorability at or above that of Clinton and Bush in their respective party's primaries. At the end of May, Perot called on Bush to \\"climb in the ring\\", claiming that the President was using surrogates to attack him. To strengthen his own team, Perot's campaign interviewed Jimmy Carter's 1976 campaign manager and White House Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan and Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign manager Ed Rollins to fill a position in the campaign. Eventually, both were hired as co-campaign managers. On May 29, Perot ended his talk show hiatus after talking with Barbara Walters on 20/20. He discussed his three-part plan for balancing the budget, starting with a Congressional act to limit spending, followed by a cut in government waste, of which he would be more specific in coming weeks, and a reform of the existing tax system. During the interview, Perot also stated that he would avoid adding homosexuals to his cabinet to prevent \\"a point of controversy with the American people\\". However, he commented that \\"what people do in their private lives is their business.\\" Former Pat Buchanan pollster Frank Luntz was hired by the campaign, along with former Republican National Campaign Committee chairman Charles Leonard. The New York Times reported that Perot sought the help of operatives to search court and federal documents to find information that might reflect poorly on the potential candidate so that preparations could be made to respond. In the final round of Democratic and Republican primaries, most notably in California, exit polls revealed that 42% of Republicans and 33% of Democrats favored Perot. A Time Magazine poll found that Perot had 37% support of all the electorate, ahead of both Bush and Clinton who tied for second at 24%. At this time, Vice President Dan Quayle became the most senior member of the Bush administration to criticize Perot, calling him a \\"temperamental tycoon\\". Perot campaigned in California in mid- June, and held a rally attended by 7,000 in Sacramento where he was heckled by some who chanted \\"Talk about the issues!\\" He privately spoke with black and Asian leaders in Los Angeles to discuss race relations following the L.A. race riots; afterwards, he gave a speech to a mostly white audience in Orange County about race relations, but did not take a stand on affirmative action. Perot finished his California campaign swing in Irvine before traveling to events in Colorado and Massachusetts. At the end of the month, large nominating conventions were held in Washington and other states to put together the final pieces to include Perot on the ballot. Perot addressed the conventions, largely made up of \\"well dressed, middle aged\\" individuals, and spoke of improving the education system and restoring the America \\"where you leave the doors unlocked\\". As June came to a close, speculation arose that Perot was planning a National Convention to follow the Democratic and Republican National Conventions. Decline and withdrawal In July, some of Perot's past actions, including a private investigation of the Bush family in the late 1980s, circulated in the media, causing frustration for the campaign. Perot blamed the reports on a \\"Republican research team\\" and claimed that he was warned that since he had such a \\"clean record they have got to try to redefine you and destroy you\\". Campaign officials tried to come up with a new strategy to combat the negative press, and to end Perot's use of generalizations on the issues. Perot sought National Institutes of Health head Dr. Bernadine Healy as his running mate, but she declined. Meanwhile, Perot faced obstacles on the campaign trail. During an Olympia rally, he was approached by a gay rights group, demanding that he address AIDS and gay rights; he soon flipped on the issue and stated that he would allow gays to serve in the military and in his cabinet. During an address to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Perot faced his toughest demographic, and made the gaffe of referring to African Americans as \\"you people\\". It was later revealed that Perot did not want to appear at the meeting or any other forum without his supporters. Press consultant Squires had written a speech for Perot for the occasion, but he instead used his own. After the speech, Perot was concerned that members of the New Black Panther Party were plotting his assassination.Hillsman, p. 73 By mid-July, the Washington Post reported that Perot's campaign managers were becoming increasingly disillusioned by his unwillingness to follow their advice to be more specific on issues, and his need to be in full control of operations with such tactics as forcing volunteers to sign loyalty oaths. Perot's poll numbers began to slip to 25%, and his advisers warned that if he continued to ignore them, he would fall into single digits. Co-manager Hamilton Jordan threatened to quit, and on July 15, Ed Rollins resigned after Perot fired advertisement specialist Hal Riney, who had worked with Rollins on the Reagan campaign. Rollins later claimed that a member of the campaign accused him of being a Bush plant with ties to the CIA. Amidst the chaos, Perot's support fell to 20%. The next day, Perot announced on Larry King Live that he would not seek the presidency. He explained that he did not want the House of Representatives to decide the election if the result caused the electoral college to be split. He asked his supporters to look for other candidates to nominate for the race, and formed United We Stand to \\"influence the debate.\\" At this point, Perot had spent $12 million of his own money on the race. Bill Hillsman, who produced a few unaired advertisements for the campaign, wrote that Perot's withdrawal was a tactic to find temporary relief from the press.Hillsman, p. 67 Former advisors commented that Perot, who had achieved ballot access in 24 states, was unwilling \\"to spend money on things that mattered\\" including Rollins' and Jordan's proposed $150 million advertising campaign,Jelen, p. 19 was \\"obsessed\\" with his image, and lost interest in running after receiving negative press. Supporters were angry and distraught at Perot's decision, and his popularity dropped among the American public. One woman called Perot and commented that \\"the tears have not stopped.\\" A class action lawsuit was filed in Florida to force him to remain in the race, but it was dropped. Later in July, the economic plan that Perot's campaign had been working on was released. The fifty-page proposal included cuts in domestic spending, investment in education, communication and transportation programs, an increase in income taxes for the wealthy, and an increase in the gasoline tax. The plan was projected to eliminate the budget deficit in five years. At the end of August, Perot promised to give his endorsement to any candidate that supported his economic plan, but hinted that he may reenter the race. These hints increased in September, as Perot looked to buy advertising time on the major networks to discuss his economic plan, which could only occur if he was a declared candidate. Meanwhile, petitions for ballot access were approved in all 50 states, and polls showed Perot still in double digits with 14% support, behind Clinton and Bush with 44% and 39%, respectively. Re-entrance On October 1, Perot re-entered the presidential race, with a desire to further explain his economic plans to the American people. The New York Times commented that Perot's \\"chances of winning are much less than when he quit in July. His only dim practical hope is to confuse and destabilize the contest.\\" He hoped to spend more resources using paid advertisements than holding traditional rallies to spread his message. During the last month of campaigning, Perot left his headquarters in Dallas only to appear in the presidential debates and seven rallies. One aide later commented: \\"he wanted to do it just like he could go to the office every day, run for president, and go home and eat dinner.\\" Rather than using professional advisers, Perot employed \\"political amateurs\\" whose loyalty was unquestioned. Orson Swindle, whom he had known since the 1970s, was hired as the top aide. Perot's son-in- law Clayton Mulford, who was involved in the early draft effort, was hired as legal adviser. Sharon Holman, who had worked for Perot since 1969, was hired as press secretary, and friend Murphy Martin was added as the media chief. Perot employed a massive marketing strategy, spending $34.8 million to buy half hour and hour-long segments on major television networks, memorably using charts to illustrate his ideas for the economy. His first infomercial was aired on October 6, and viewed by 16.5 million people. He used two dozen charts and a metal pointer during the ad, explaining that \\"We got into trickle-down economics and it didn't trickle.\\" He later concluded that \\"our President blames Congress, Congress blames the President, the Democrats and Republicans blame each other. Nobody steps up to the plate and accepts responsibility for anything.\\" He spent a large portion of the infomercial speaking into the camera while sitting at a desk in front of a bookshelf. Political experts commented that the nature of the ad was groundbreaking. Two days later, an ad campaign was unveiled that included three new 60-second commercials to air on ESPN, CNN and five other cable networks. One commercial entitled \\"Red Flag\\" displayed a waving red flag with a background drum roll and the statement: \\"While the Cold War is ending another war is upon us. In this new war, the enemy is not the red flag of Communism, but the red ink of our national debt, the red tape of our government bureaucracy. The casualties of this war are counted in lost jobs and lost dreams.\\" A second half hour infomercial was shown on October 9. =Debates= Perot participated in the first of three presidential debates for the 1992 election, on October 11 in Clayton, Missouri, along with George Bush and Bill Clinton. It was the first time that a third party candidate was involved in a national televised debate since John B. Anderson in 1980 and was the first general-election presidential debate to ever feature three candidates. During the event, Perot discussed a wide range of issues including the budget deficit, education, and drug use and proclaimed that, as president, he would eliminate the influence of lobbyists. He also had a few memorable quips. When asked to address detractors' criticism of his lack of government experience, he remarked: \\"Well, they've got a point. I don't have any experience running up a $4 trillion debt.\\" When discussing what would happen if one of his opponents won, he commented: \\"Then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do. I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music here tonight.\\" After the debate, three out of four polls declared Perot as the winner. The average of all four showed Perot at 37% followed by Clinton with 30% and Bush with 18%, but election polls still showed Perot in third with 14%, far behind both Bush and Clinton. His running mate, James Stockdale, participated in a Vice Presidential debate in Atlanta, with fellow Vice Presidential nominee Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle. Largely unknown to the general public, Stockdale memorably opened the debate by unexpectedly asking the philosophical question, \\"Who am I? Why am I here?\\" He was unprepared to deal with some of the substantive issues raised, and his struggling performance may have damaged the Perot campaign. The second presidential debate was held on October 15 in Richmond, Virginia, and included questions from undecided voters, who kept the candidates focused on the issues. During his opening statement, Perot explained that there was a \\"giant sucking sound\\" caused by the rush of manufacturing jobs to Mexico. During one exchange, Perot commented that Democrats and Republicans were both to blame for the deficit, but that neither was willing to take responsibility. He joked \\"somewhere out there, there's an extraterrestrial that's doing this to us, I guess.\\" At the close of the debate, Perot described himself as \\"results ... [and] action oriented\\", and explained that \\"if they want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man.\\" Perot took part in the third debate held in East Lansing, Michigan, on October 19. Throughout the debate, he plugged and referenced his infomercials. He criticized Bush's economic plan to start off the debate, stating that it would not balance the budget. He later remarked that he would spend $60 million of his own money to finish the race. Notably, Perot brought up the fact that \\"both parties have foreign lobbyists on leaves and key roles in the campaigns.\\" After the debate, he ripped the media during a press conference, criticizing them for their use of \\"gotcha\\" stories and the lack of coverage concerning his opponent Bush's foreign lobbyists. Former pollster Frank Luntz explained, \\"When Ross Perot uses his head, he's unbeatable. He's focused, straightforward and compelling. When he uses his heart, sometimes his emotions get carried away.\\" =Final stages= Perot showing a chart of the federal budget deficit in his first infomercial. During the broadcast, he named his pointer a \\"voodoo stick\\", a play on \\"voodoo economics\\" In the week following the debates, Perot did not campaign and was not often seen on television. ABC aired a 30-minute sequel to an autobiographical infomercial shown on October 17. The spot cost Perot $370,000. CBS aired an infomercial on October 24 entitled The Ross Perot Nobody Knows, and two days later another was shown on ABC, preceding the kickoff of Monday Night Football, which cost $940,000. Perot hoped to better explain his earlier exit as Election Day neared. Reports circulated that a security official from the campaign had contacted the Dallas Police in August to urge them to perform a sting operation targeting Bush campaign adviser James Oberwetter, in response to allegations that Republicans planned to wiretap Perot's office. Perot claimed during an interview with 60 Minutes that \\"Republican operatives\\" also threatened to disrupt his daughter's wedding, which forced him to withdraw in July. He reported the story to the FBI, but no evidence of any wrongdoing was found.Jelen, p. 23 The New York Times argued that the story could help Perot with voters and his overall image by presenting him as a man \\"who was willing to give up his goal to protect his family\\"; nevertheless, his lack of evidence drew criticism. By the end of October, Perot had reached 20% in opinion polls, and his favorability ratings slightly increased. But as reports detailed Perot's investigation of campaign volunteers and the prior use of \\"loyalty oaths\\", the numbers remained stagnant. Aides hoped to shift the focus of the campaign and media reports back to the economy. Perot appeared on Larry King Live later in the week and opined that the early 1990s recession was not over \\"because of deficit spending and competition for money\\". He was also interviewed on Talking with David Frost, where he affirmed a statement made by his running mate that the Vietnam War protests had prolonged the war effort. In the final days, it was estimated that Perot spent $5 million a day on advertisements. Overall, he had spent $40 million in October alone, and $60 million overall during the course of the campaign. In the lead up to Election Day, Perot attended a few rallies in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Denver. A major rally was staged in Tampa, and was attended by more than 10,000 supporters. Perot also made stops in Kansas City, Los Angeles and Santa Clara. On the final night, infomercials aired on all three major networks. He held his final campaign event in Dallas outside his headquarters, and thanked his supporters, stating: \\"What you've been through hasn't been pretty, but by golly, you're taking your country back.\\" At the end, his campaign song \\"Crazy\\" by Patsy Cline was played. In the final NBC-Wall Street Journal poll, Perot was in third place with 15%, behind Bush with 36% and Clinton with 44%. Results On Election Day, Perot finished in third place behind Clinton (the winner) and Bush. Perot received 19,743,821 votes, which accounted for 18.91% of the popular vote. He failed to win any states in the Electoral College because of the relatively even distribution of his support, but did win over 30% of the vote in Maine and 27% in Utah, finishing second in both states. Perot was the first third party candidate since George Wallace in 1968 to finish first in a county, winning counties in Alaska (divided into boroughs), California, Nevada, Colorado, Kansas, Texas and Maine. He won his largest percentage in Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska and Loving County, Texas with over 40%. According to exit polls, 52% of Perot's supporters were male, 94% were white, 63% were aged between 18 and 44, and about 2/3 had not received a college degree. The income of supporters mirrored the general public. In terms of ideology, 53% identified as moderates, 27% were conservative and 20% were liberal, while two-thirds were either members of the Democratic Party or were politically independent. Perot's performance satisfied the 5% popular vote threshold for third party candidates, classifying it as successful under the criterion established by scholar Walter Dean Burnham.Rapoport and Stone, p. 4 The legitimacy of this success has been questioned by scholars who dismiss the label of Perot as a typical third party candidate, largely due to the availability of campaign funds and financing of grassroots efforts.Rapoport and Stone, p. 8 Others dispute these claims and point out that Perot forced the other candidates to change their rhetoric on the issues to gain the votes of his supporters, indicating an issues campaign.Rapoport and Stone, p. 10 Exit polls revealed that 35% of voters would have voted for Perot if they believed he could win. Contemporary analysis reveals that Perot could have won the election if the polls prior to the election had shown the candidate with a larger share, preventing the wasted vote mindset.Abramson and Aldrich, p. 349 =Analysis= The effect of Ross Perot's candidacy has been a contentious point of debate for many years. In the ensuing months after the election, various Republicans asserted that Perot had acted as a spoiler, enough to the detriment of Bush to lose him the election. While many disaffected conservatives may have voted for Ross Perot to protest Bush's tax increase, further examination of the Perot vote in the Election Night exit polls not only showed that Perot siphoned votes nearly equally among Bush and Clinton,Los Angeles Times.

A mathematical look at the voting numbers reveals that Bush would have had to win 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti- NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights. A 1999 study in the American Journal of Political Science estimated that Perot's candidacy hurt the Clinton campaign, reducing \\"Clinton's margin of victory over Bush by seven percentage points.\\" Aftermath After the election, Perot continued to work with \\"United We Stand\\", and focused his efforts to defeat the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In 1993, he was involved in a highly publicized debate with Vice President Al Gore on Larry King Live over NAFTA. Perot formed the Reform Party of the United States of America in 1995, and ran for president under the party's banner the following year. During the election, he failed to appear in the presidential debates, and finished in third place with about 8% of the vote, behind Republican nominee Bob Dole and President Bill Clinton. The Reform Party's candidate, former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura, was elected as Governor of Minnesota in 1998, which was connected to Perot's performance in the presidential elections.Jelen, p. 163 His focus on a balanced budget during his campaigns is speculated to have brought the issue to the forefront, enabling the surplus of the late 1990s.Jelen, p. 8 Perot declined to run in the 2000 presidential election, and endorsed eventual winner Republican Governor George W. Bush of Texas. In 2008, he endorsed Republican Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts for the presidency, and stated \\"the situation in 1992 was not nearly as bad as it is now ... if ever there was a time when it was necessary to put our house in order, it is now.\\" The populist Tea Party movement and supporters of President Donald Trump have both been compared to Perot advocates. Upon Perot's death from leukemia in 2019, Politico editor-in-chief John F. Harris reflected upon Perot's 1992 campaign and referred to him as the \\"father of Trump\\" due to Trump's 2016 presidential victory as, like Perot, a populist businessman without traditional political experience.

Founded by Edmund Harris in 1877, it still operates as a local history and fine art museum.  History  In the 19th century, it became legal to raise money for libraries by local taxation, and the town of Preston wanted a grand museum and library for its inhabitants. From 1850, local people held fund-raising events; and in 1877 Edmund Robert Harris, a Preston lawyer, left in his will ¬£300,000 to establish a trust and support a public library, museum and art gallery with Preston Corporation. In 1879, the first Preston lending library was set up in the Town Hall basement, while a public museum was set up on Cross Street, opening 1 May 1880. Success led the council to erect a new building for both. Work started on the museum in 1882 during the Preston Guild, and it officially opened in 1893. Design The building was designed by a local architect, James Hibbert, who chose a Neo-Classical style. For the 1880s, this was in some ways contrary to the Gothic Revival style which was popular at the time and features in numerous contemporary buildings in Preston, including the old Town Hall which stood on the western side of the Harris. =Exterior= The building's exterior reflects Hibbert‚Äôs vision of a neo-classicism through \\"‚Äúsimplicity, symmetry of plan, truthfulness of expression and refinement of detail‚Äù. Unlike other public buildings designed in this style (such as the British Museum in London and the Konzerthaus in Berlin), Hibbert's design does not feature steps leading up from the Flag Market but instead has ground-level entrances om each side of the building. A pediment dominates the front of the building and features a sculpture based upon Raphael's painting The School of Athens. Interpreting Hibbert's design fell to London sculptor Edwin Roscoe Mullins and features the central figure of the Ancient Athenian general Pericles, surrounded by twelve other men arranged symmetrically to either side. The sculpture is considered Mullins' principal work. Beneath the pediment is the inscription To Literature, Arts and Science. There are further inscriptions along the sides, and on the lantern tower a quotation in Ancient Greek from Pericles' Funeral Oration. Supporting the pediment are six Ionic fluted columns leading down to a raised portico overlooking the Flag Market. =Interior= The building's interior is dominated by a central hall rising over 120 feet from the ground floor to the ceiling of the lantern tower. As well as the ground floor, there are three upper floors with balconies opening up onto the central hall, and collection halls and exhibition spaces on each floor. The interior design features classical influences from Ancient Greece, Assyria and Egypt, including columns and mosaic floors, and copies of Classical and Renaissance sculpture representing the ‚Äúwhole range and history of the world‚Äôs greatest achievements in art‚Äù. Only the Greek and Assyrian friezes on the upper floors and the copy of Lorenzo Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise on the ground floor remain of the original sculptures. The ground floor has been remodelled to include a cafe and gift shop, and is the entrance to the Harris Library. Located in the basement are additional storage spaces and workshops for maintaining the collections.  Collections  The Harris collections cover fine art, decorative art, costume, textiles and history including collections on archaeology and local history. The museum has a permanent history gallery called Discover Preston which covers Preston's history but also includes a Discovery Room featuring the wider collections. Highlights of the Discovery Room include a display of the complete skeleton discovered in 1970, of the 13,500-year-old Poulton Elk, a skeleton of an Ice Age elk with two embedded man-made barbed points, the earliest relic of human occupation of Lancashire.Harris Museum: The Poulton Elk. The fine art collection includes over 800 oil paintings featuring work by Richard Ansdell, George Frederick Watts, Lawrence Alma-Tadema, Stanley Spencer, Lucian Freud, Ivon Hitchens and Graham Sutherland as well as local artists Anthony Devis and Reginald Aspinwall.Reginald Aspinwall's Paintings, BBC Your Paintings, accessed April 2013 The decorative art collection includes collections of British ceramics and glass, highlights of which include the largest scent bottle collection in the country and are displayed in the Ceramics and Glass Gallery. In addition there is a contemporary art programme of national and international artists, touring shows and in-house exhibitions. A Foucault pendulum hangs in the central foyer, through all the floors, over a butterfly- shaped plate marked with the hours of the day. As a result of the rotation of the Earth, this functions as a decorative and reasonably-accurate clock. The building is also decorated with a number of plaster casts of classical friezes throughout the central atrium and a 19th-century copy of the Baptistery doors from Florence is located on the ground floor. These were part of the original design scheme by the architect James Hibbert.  Library  The building also houses Preston City's Public Library, which is run by Lancashire County Council. The first librarian of the Harris Free Public Library was a William Bramwell who retired in 1916 aged eighty-one.The Harris library holds important book collections including the Shepherd Collection donated to Preston by Dr Richard Shepherd in 1761, with additions funded by the Shepherd bequest, local studies material, nineteenth-century journals, rare books and art books. Also the Spencer collection of illustrated children's books and chapbooks.A Catalogue of the Spencer Collection of Early Children's Books and Chapbooks, Presented to the Harris Public Library, Preston, By Mr. J.

The film features Robert Bixby, director of the Concord Coalition, and David Walker, the former U.S. Comptroller General, as they travel around the United States on a tour to let communities know of the potential dangers of the national debt. The tour was carried out through the Concord Coalition, and was known as the \\"Fiscal Wake-Up Tour.\\" The film competed in the Documentary Competition at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. It began its nationwide showing at the Holland Performing Arts Center in Omaha, Nebraska on 21 August 2008, with a live discussion among Warren Buffett, Pete Peterson, David Walker, William Niskanen, and Bill Novelli following the screening. The film was broadcast on CNN on January 10, 2009. Plot The film follows Bixby and Walker who describe systematically four serious deficits shaping the U.S. economy: budget, savings, the balance of payments, and leadership. As of the early 2008 release of the film they had created a national debt of over $9.6 trillion, $30,000 for each American.Paul B.

China has the greatest trade surplus in the world while the USA has the largest trade deficit in the world. * The leadership deficit is the lack of civic or political leaders willing to make it clear Americans must cut government spending, pay more taxes, save more of their personal income and use less imported materials.

Running back Brian Toal answered for Boston College with a 1-yard touchdown run to make it 14‚Äì13. Kaheaku-Enhada once again threw a touchdown pass, this one covering 24 yards to Jason Tomlinson to increase Navy's lead to 21‚Äì13. With no time left in the half, kicker Steve Aponavicius drilled a 26-yard field goal, to cut the lead to 21‚Äì16. In the third quarter, Navy was poised to score a touchdown, but BC's defense held strong, and forced a field goal. Matthew Harmon]connected on the 22-yard field goal to extend Navy's lead to 24‚Äì16. With 7:36 left in the fourth quarter, Ryan found tight end Ryan Purvis for a 25-yard touchdown pass. The two-point conversion attempt failed, and Navy still led 24‚Äì22. Navy had the ball, with 1:43 left in the game, and Boston College had no time outs left. On the next play, Reggie Campbell fumbled an option pitch, that was recovered by BC's Jo-Lonn Dunbar at the Navy 40-yard line. Ryan threw a 16-yard pass to Ryan Purvis to get BC into field goal range. Steve Aponavicius drilled a 37-yard field goal as time expired to give Boston College the 25‚Äì24 win. The win extended BC's streak of consecutive bowl wins to seven.

The series premiered in 1995, and 22 specials have been produced to date, with most of the more recent ones consisting of multiple episodes. The earlier programmes were produced in-house by the BBC's Natural History Unit, but the more recent Spy in the ... titles were made by the independent John Downer Productions. The first 18 specials, through 2008, were narrated by David Attenborough. Polar Bear: Spy on the Ice (2010), Penguins: Spy in the Huddle (2013) and Dolphins: Spy in the Pod (2014) were narrated by David Tennant.  Broadcast and production history  The Wildlife Specials have always been broadcast on BBC One. Following the pilot Great White Shark: The True Story of Jaws, transmitted in 1995, a sequence of six further programmes were broadcast in 1997, as part of the Natural History Unit's 40th anniversary celebrations. Later specials were screened on an intermittent basis, typically at holiday times to attract a family audience. Viewing figures for the 1997 programmes peaked at 9.5 million, for Polar Bear: The Arctic Warrior. Although the animals featured in the specials are frequent documentary subjects, the Wildlife Specials incorporate the latest filming techniques and scientific research to present the creatures in a new light, as described in the examples below: * During the production of Polar Bear: The Arctic Warrior, the producer and cameraman were trapped on an ice floe for 20 hours, but managed to capture the first scenes of newborn cubs in the den. * In Leopard: The Agent of Darkness, infrared cameras are used to reveal the cats' previously unseen nocturnal hunting of baboons. * Eagle: The Master of the Skies uses aerial photography to capture dramatic scenes of the birds, including footage of them dropping tortoises from a great height to smash their shells open. Fifteen of the world's sixty species of eagle were filmed for this programme. * A specially constructed, remote-controlled airship was used to capture aerial footage of humpback whales as they breached, scooping thousands of fish into their mouths, for Humpback Whale: The Giant of the Oceans. * Lions: Spy in the Den was the first special to be commissioned from an independent production company. The filmmakers at John Downer Productions used their previous experience on ground-breaking films such as In-Flight Movie to develop a range of mobile, remote-controlled cameras. The \\"Boulder Cam\\" was disguised as a rock, and enabled the capture of the first footage shot inside a pride's den. This technique was developed further for the later Spy in the ... specials about elephants and bears. * Groundbreaking high-speed photography, x-ray imaging and miniature cameras attached to the heads of snakes captured footage of new and revealing behaviour in Serpent: Through the Eyes of the Snake. * For the two-part special Trek: Spy on the Wildebeest, cameras disguised as tortoises and crocodiles, and an aerial camera christened \\"Dragonfly Cam\\", were developed. * In Tiger: Spy in the Jungle, trained elephants carried and deployed the \\"Trunk Cam\\" and \\"Tusk Cam\\", whilst the \\"Log Cam\\" gathered unique footage of India's jungle wildlife.

The war lasted from 1645 to 1669 and was fought in Crete, especially in the city of Candia, and in numerous naval engagements and raids around the Aegean Sea, with Dalmatia providing a secondary theater of operations. Although most of Crete was conquered by the Ottomans in the first few years of the war, the fortress of Candia (modern Heraklion), the capital of Crete, resisted successfully. Its prolonged siege, \\"Troy's rival\\" as Lord Byron called it,Lord Byron, Childe Harold, Canto IV.14 forced both sides to focus their attention on the supply of their respective forces on the island. For the Venetians in particular, their only hope for victory over the larger Ottoman army in Crete lay in successfully starving it of supplies and reinforcements. Hence the war turned into a series of naval encounters between the two navies and their allies. Venice was aided by various Western European nations, who, exhorted by the Pope and in a revival of crusading spirit, sent men, ships and supplies \\"to defend Christendom\\". Throughout the war, Venice maintained overall naval superiority, winning most naval engagements, but the efforts to blockade the Dardanelles were only partially successful, and the Republic never had enough ships to fully cut off the flow of supplies and reinforcements to Crete. The Ottomans were hampered in their efforts by domestic turmoil, as well as by the diversion of their forces north towards Transylvania and the Habsburg Monarchy. The prolonged conflict exhausted the economy of the Republic, which relied on the lucrative trade with the Ottoman Empire. By the 1660s, despite increased aid from other Christian nations, war- weariness had set in. The Ottomans on the other hand, having managed to sustain their forces on Crete and reinvigorated under the capable leadership of the K√∂pr√ºl√º family, sent a final great expedition in 1666 under the direct supervision of the Grand Vizier. This began the final and bloodiest stage of the Siege of Candia, which lasted for more than two years. It ended with the negotiated surrender of the fortress, sealing the fate of the island and ending the war in an Ottoman victory. In the final peace treaty, Venice retained a few isolated island fortresses off Crete, and made some territorial gains in Dalmatia. The Venetian desire for a revanche would lead, barely 15 years later, to a renewed war, from which Venice would emerge victorious. Crete, however, would remain under Ottoman control until 1897, when it became an autonomous state; it was finally united with Greece in 1913. Background After the loss of Cyprus to the Ottomans in the fourth Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1570‚Äì1573), the island of Crete (the \\"Kingdom of Candia\\") was the last major overseas possession of Venice.Faroqhi (2006), p. 51 Its important strategic position made it an obvious target for future Ottoman expansion,Setton (1991), pp. 107‚Äì108 while its size and fertile ground, together with the bad state of its fortresses, made it a more tempting prize than Malta.Greene (2000), p. 17 On the Venetian side, the Serenissima, with its weak military and great dependence on uninterrupted trade, was anxious not to provoke the Ottomans. Hence Venice scrupulously observed the terms of its treaty with the Ottomans, securing over sixty years of peaceful relations.Finkel (2006), p. 222 By the early 17th century moreover, Venetian power had declined considerably. Its economy, which had once prospered because of its control over the Eastern spice trade, had suffered as a result of the opening of the new Atlantic trade routes, and from the loss of the important German market because of the Thirty Years' War. In addition, the Republic had become embroiled in a series of wars in northern Italy like the Mantuan War and was further weakened by an outbreak of the plague in 1629‚Äì1631.Setton (1991), pp. 104‚Äì106 The potential for conflict between the Ottomans and Venice was still present, as evidenced in 1638, when a Venetian fleet attacked and destroyed a fleet of Barbary pirates that had sought protection in the Ottoman port of Valona, bombarding the city in the process.Lane (1973), p. 408 Sultan Murad IV was enraged: he threatened to execute all Venetians in the Empire, and put an embargo on Venetian trade.Setton (1991), pp. 108‚Äì109 Eventually, and given that the Ottomans were still engaged in a war with the Persians, the situation was defused with the Republic paying the Ottomans an indemnity of 250,000 sequins.Parry & Cook (1976), p. 152 A similar episode however in 1644 had an entirely different outcome: on 28 September, the Knights of Malta attacked an Ottoman convoy on its way from Constantinople to Alexandria, aboard which were a number of pilgrims bound for Mecca, including the exiled Kƒ±zlar Aƒüa (Chief Black Eunuch) S√ºnb√ºl Aƒüa, the kadi of Cairo and the nurse of the future sultan Mehmed IV. During the fight, S√ºnb√ºl Aƒüa and most of the important pilgrims were slain, while 350 men and 30 women were taken to be sold as slaves.Setton (1991), p. 111 The Knights loaded their loot on a ship, which then docked at a small harbor on the southern coast of Crete for a few days, where it disembarked a number of sailors and slaves.Finkel (2006), p. 225 The Ottomans were enraged at the incident, and the Porte accused the Venetians of deliberate collusion with the Knights, something the Venetians vehemently denied. With the hawkish party being then dominant in the Ottoman court,Finkel (2006), p. 226 the incident was seen as a perfect pretext for war with a weakened Venice.Finlay (1856), p. 128 Despite a long period of negotiations, which lasted until well into 1645, and against the objections of the Grand Vizier Sultanzade Mehmed Pasha,Setton (1991), p. 124 war was decided upon. An expedition was quickly assembled with over 50,000 troops and reputedly 416 vessels, under Kapudan Pasha Silahdar Yusuf Pasha, the Sultan's son-in-law. The Ottoman armada sailed from the Dardanelles on 30 April, heading towards the harbor of Navarino in the Peloponnese, where it remained for three weeks.Setton (1991), p. 126 The fleet's target was not announced, but the Ottomans, to allay Venetian fears, implied that it would be Malta. War=Early operations in Crete= The Venetians were indeed fooled by the Ottoman subterfuge and were taken by surprise at the arrival of the Ottoman fleet at Crete on 23 June 1645. Despite the efforts of the recently appointed provveditore generale, Andrea Corner, the Venetian defenses were still in a bad state.Setton (1991), p. 120 The island's fortifications were substantial, but they had been long neglected, and much effort was put into repairing them.Setton (1991), p. 107 Anxious about Ottoman preparations, the Republic reinforced Crete in late 1644 with 2,500 troops and provisions, and began arming its fleet, while assistance was promised in the event of war by the Pope and Tuscany.Setton (1991), p. 121 its fortifications, 1651 The Ottomans first landed 15 miles west of Canea (Chania), where the local militia fled before them. They then attacked the small island fortress of St. Todero, the commander of which, the Istrian Blasio Zulian, blew himself, the fortress and its garrison up rather than let it fall to the Ottomans. The Ottoman army next advanced to the city of Canea itself, which fell on 22 August, after a siege that lasted for 56 days.Setton (1991), p. 127 At the same time, however, the Venetians were strengthened, as the promised help started to arrive in the form of galleys from the Papal States, Tuscany, Malta and Naples. In September, the Ottoman fleet was in disarray, but the allied Christian fleet, under the cautious command of Niccol√≤ Ludovisi, the Pope's nephew, failed to exploit the opportunity for a decisive strike.Setton (1991), pp. 128‚Äì129 When the Christian forces finally moved to retake Canea on 1 October, with a fleet of about 90 ships, the stout Ottoman defense and the Allies' lack of cooperation doomed the attack. Soon thereafter, the Venetian allies returned to their bases. 1651 map by Francesco Basilicata depicting the Venetian Lion of St. Mark standing guard over the Regno di Candia. By that time however, all of the island, except for the capital Candia, was under Ottoman control. In November, Silahdar Yusuf Pasha left behind a strong garrison and returned to Constantinople for the winter. There however, he fell foul of the Sultan and was executed.Finkel (2006), p. 227 Nevertheless, Ottoman preparations continued in order to renew and expand the war, while the Venetians were frantically trying to raise money and men, and attempting to induce other European powers to join them against the Ottomans. However, as most of Europe was locked into the fierce antagonisms of the Thirty Years' War, their pleas fell mostly on deaf ears.Setton (1991), pp. 131‚Äì132 The Venetians were hard pressed by the financial demands of the war: besides placing taxes on the Italian mainland possessions (the Terraferma), they resorted to the sale of nobility titles and state offices to fill their war coffer.Setton (1991), pp. 131,137‚Äì138 To lead the effort against the Ottomans, the Senate initially appointed the 80-year-old doge Francesco Erizzo, but after his death in early 1646, he was replaced by the 73-year-old Giovanni Cappello as Captain General of the Sea.Setton (1991), p. 129 Cappello's performance in 1646 was distinctly lackluster: he failed to interdict the arrival of Ottoman reinforcements under Koca Musa Pasha in June (see below),Setton (1991), p. 140 and an attack on the Ottoman fleet at Chania Bay in August failed, as did his attempt to break the Ottoman blockade of Rettimo (Rethymno). As a result, the city fell on 20 October, while the citadel held out until 13 November.Setton (1991), p. 141 During the winter of 1646‚Äì1647, both sides suffered from an outbreak of plague, and throughout the spring of 1647, operations did not make much headway. In mid-June however, a small Ottoman force routed a larger body of Venetian mercenaries. This Ottoman success paved the way for Gazi H√ºseyin Pasha, the local commander, to conquer the eastern half of the island, except for the fortress of Siteia.Setton (1991), p. 147 The Venetians and the local population suffered some grievous losses: it is estimated that by 1648, almost 40% of the Cretan population had perished of disease or warfare,Setton (1991), p. 148 and in 1677, the island's pre-war population of ca. 260,000 had dropped to about 80,000.Miller, p. 196 By the beginning of 1648, all of Crete, except Candia and a few strongholds like the island of Gramvousa, was in Ottoman hands. =Siege of Candia begins= The siege began in May 1648. The Ottomans spent three months investing the city, which included cutting off the water supply. Eventually, it would last until 1669, the second longest siege in history after the Siege of Ceuta (1694-1727) by the Moors under Moulay Ismail.The Siege of Candia is often cited as \\"the longest siege on record\\", (e.g. by ). Nevertheless, the blockade and siege of Ceuta, variously given as lasting until 1720 () or until Moulay's death in 1727 , was longer. The Ottoman besiegers were adversely affected by the bad supply situation caused by the activity of the Christian fleets in the Aegean, who intercepted Ottoman convoys carrying supplies and reinforcements to the island. In addition, the overall Ottoman war effort was severely hampered by increased domestic instability caused by Sultan Ibrahim's erratic policies and his summary execution of leading state officials. It ultimately led to his deposition in favor of his son Mehmed IV, ushering in a further period of confusion within the Ottoman government.Setton (1991), pp. 151‚Äì153 The lack of supplies had forced the Ottoman commander Gazi H√ºseyin Pasha to lift the siege in early 1649, but it was renewed for a short period of two months after the arrival of the Ottoman fleet in June.Setton (1991), p. 158 The Ottomans assailed the fortifications, exploding over 70 mines, but the defenders held firm. The Ottomans lost over 1,000 men, and the subsequent withdrawal of 1,500 Janissaries and the lack of any further reinforcements over the course of 1650 left H√ºseyin Pasha with little option but to continue maintaining as tight a blockade as possible. The Ottomans strengthened their positions with the construction of three forts in the Canea area, and the arrival of reinforcements in late 1650 allowed them to keep up their tight blockade.Setton (1991), p. 159 Despite the Venetian blockade of the Dardanelles and the political turmoil at the Ottoman court, the Ottoman forces were kept well supplied enough to sustain themselves, although too weak to engage in offensive actions against Candia itself. In 1653, the Ottomans took the island fortress of Selino in Suda Bay, and San Todero, captured a few years previously, was refortified.Setton (1991), p. 167 The Venetian naval successes over the next few years further reduced the offensive ability of the Ottoman army in Crete, but the blockade of Candia continued, and the Ottomans retained possession of their other conquests on the island, until the arrival of a new Ottoman expeditionary force in 1666. =Naval war= :For a complete list of naval engagements, see Naval battles of the Cretan War Early clashes, 1645‚Äì1654 A Maltese galley. Although being gradually replaced by sailing ships, galleys formed still a large part of the Mediterranean navies during the 17th century. Venice could not directly confront the large Ottoman expeditionary force on Crete, but it did possess a fine navy, that could intervene and cut the Ottoman supply routes.Turnbull, p. 85 In 1645, the Venetians and their allies possessed a fleet of 60‚Äì70 galleys, 4 galleasses and about 36 galleons. The Venetians were also superior in their use of a mixed fleet of both galleys and sailing ships, while initially, the Ottoman navy relied almost exclusively on galleys.Cooper (1979), p. 231 In order to bolster their forces, both opponents hired armed merchantmen from the Netherlands, and later from England (especially the Ottomans), to augment their forces.Holt, Lambton & Lewis (1978), p. 631 The first Venetian operation was an attempt to blockade the Dardanelles in 1646. To interdict the supplies headed to the Ottoman forces in Crete, a force of 23 Venetian ships under Tommaso Morosini scoured the Aegean for Ottoman shipping, and attempted to capture the strategically important island of Tenedos at the entrance of the Dardanelles. The Kapudan Pasha Koca Musa led a fleet of 80 warships against the Venetians, but his fleet was driven back into the Dardanelles on 26 May.Setton (1991), p. 139 However, the blockading fleet was unable to stop the next exit of the Ottoman fleet on 4 June, when the lack of wind enabled the Ottoman galleys to evade the Venetian sailing ships. The Ottomans were thus able to land new troops and supplies on Crete unopposed.Setton (1991), pp. 139‚Äì140 The efforts of the Venetian fleet to counter the Ottoman land operations in Crete likewise failed, through a combination of timidity on behalf of their commanders, the delays in payment for the crews, and the effects of a widespread plague.Setton (1991), pp. 140‚Äì141 On 27 January 1647, the Venetians lost Tommaso Morosini, when his ship was forced to face the entire Ottoman fleet of 45 galleys. In the ensuing fight, Morosini was killed, but managed to cause significant casualties to the Ottomans, including Koca Musa Pasha himself. The ship itself was rescued by the timely arrival of the Venetian fleet under the new Captain General, Giovanni Battista Grimani. This stand-off, where a single ship had caused such damage and casualties to the entire Ottoman fleet, was a major blow to Ottoman morale.Setton (1991), p. 146 Despite some successes like a raid in √áe≈üme, the remainder of the year was a failure for the Venetians, as several attempts to blockade Ottoman harbors failed to stem the flow of supplies and reinforcements to Crete.Setton (1991), pp. 147‚Äì148 Battle of the Venetian fleet against the Turks at Phocaea (Focchies) in 1649. Painting by Abraham Beerstraten, 1656. The Venetians returned to the Dardanelles in 1648. Despite losing many ships and admiral Grimani himself in a storm in mid-March,Setton (1991), p. 149 reinforcements under Giacomo da Riva brought the Venetian fleet back up to strength (some 65 vessels), and allowed them to successfully blockade the Straits for a whole year.Setton (1991), p. 150 The Ottomans countered this in part by building a new fleet at √áe≈üme, forcing the Venetians to divide their forces, and in 1649, a strengthened Ottoman fleet under Kapudan Pasha Voinok Ahmed broke the blockade. Despite scoring a victory over the Ottoman fleet in its anchorage at Phocaea on 12 May 1649, capturing or destroying several ships, da Riva was not able to prevent the Ottoman armada from eventually reaching Crete.Setton (1991), p. 155 This highlighted the weakness of the Venetian position: maintaining long blockades with galleys was an inherently difficult task, and the Republic did not have enough ships to control both the Dardanelles and the passage of Chios at the same time. In addition, in a major development, 1648 the Ottomans decided, in a meeting chaired by the Sultan himself, to build and employ galleons in their fleet, instead of relying exclusively on oared galleys as hitherto.Bostan (2009), pp. 426, 429 For most of 1650, a Venetian fleet of 41 vessels maintained the blockade of the Dardanelles, prohibiting Haideragazade Mehmed Pasha from sailing for Crete. He was replaced late in the year by Hozamzade Ali Pasha, governor of Rhodes, who used a clever ploy to get through the blockade: waiting until winter, when the Venetians withdrew their forces, he assembled a small number of ships and embarked several thousand troops with many provisions on them, and sailed unmolested to Crete. On 10 July 1651, the first significant naval battle of the war was fought south of Naxos, a three-day engagement in which the Venetians with 58 ships under Alvise Mocenigo were victorious over the twice as large Ottoman fleet.Setton (1991), pp. 163‚Äì164 The remainders of the Ottoman fleet withdrew to Rhodes, from where they were however able to reach Candia. Mocenigo was replaced soon after by Leonardo Foscolo, but both sides did not accomplish much in the next two years, although the Ottomans did succeed in supplying their forces on Crete while keeping their fleet intact.Setton (1991), pp. 164‚Äì169 Battles of the Dardanelles, 1654‚Äì1657 Map of the Dardanelles and vicinity For 1654, the Ottomans marshaled their strength: the Arsenal (Ters√¢ne-i √Çmire) in the Golden Horn produced new warships, and squadrons from Tripolitania and Tunis arrived to strengthen the Ottoman fleet.Setton (1991), p. 170 The strengthened Ottoman fleet that sailed forth from the Dardanelles in early May numbered 79 ships (40 sailing ships, 33 galleys and 6 galleasses), and further 22 galleys from around the Aegean and 14 ships from Barbary stood by to reinforce it off the Straits.Setton (1991), p. 172 This force considerably outnumbered the 26 ships of the Venetian blockade fleet under Giuseppe Dolfin.Setton (1991), p. 173 Although the battle that followed resulted in an Ottoman victory, for the Venetians, given the successful escape of their fleet from the superior Ottoman force, coupled with reports of large Ottomans casualties and the great bravery displayed by the Venetian crews, it counted as a moral victory.Setton (1991), pp. 174‚Äì177 The Ottoman fleet, now reinforced by the Aegean and Barbary squadrons, plundered the Venetian island of Tinos, but retreated after only a brief skirmish with the Venetians under Alvise Mocenigo on 21 June. Kara Murad Pasha succeeded in evading the Venetians for the remainder of the year, with both fleets sailing back and forth in the Aegean, before returning to the Dardanelles in September due to agitation among the fleet's Janissaries.Setton (1991), p. 178 The final months of 1654 were marked by a significant change in the Venetian leadership: Mocenigo died at Candia, and was succeeded as acting Captain General of the Sea by Francesco Morosini, who had distinguished himself in the previous battles.Setton (1991), p. 179 Morosini initiated a more energetic approach in the Venetian pursuit of the war: in the spring of 1655, he raided the Ottoman supply depot at Aigina and razed the port town of Volos in a night attack on 23 March. In early June, Morosini sailed to the Dardanelles, awaiting the sally of the Ottoman fleet, which was however delayed because of political upheaval in the Ottoman government. Leaving Lazzaro Mocenigo with half the fleet (36 ships) to keep watch at the Straits, Morosini returned to the Cyclades.Setton (1991), pp. 179‚Äì180 A week after his departure however, on 21 June, the Ottoman fleet, numbering 143 ships under Mustapha Pasha, appeared.Setton (1991), p. 180 The resulting battle was a clear Venetian victory. The Ottoman fleet avoided action for the remainder of the year, before it withdrew to winter quarters, leaving Morosini free to undertake an ultimately unsuccessful siege of the strategically important island fortress of Malvasia (Monemvasia) off the south-eastern coast of the Peloponnese.Setton (1991), pp. 181‚Äì182 In September, Morosini was posted as the new provveditore of Crete, with Lorenzo Marcello as the new Captain General of the Sea.Setton (1991), p. 182 The Fourth Battle of the Dardanelles, by Pieter Casteleyn, 1657 Although in the previous years the Venetians had generally held the upper hand against the Ottomans, largely controlling the Aegean and able to extract tribute and recruits from its islands,Lane (1973), p. 409 they had been unable to transform this superiority into concrete results. Despite their defeats, the Ottomans were still free to roam the Aegean and resupply their forces in Crete,Finkel (2006), p. 247 in particular through the use of supply fleets from places like Alexandria, Rhodes, Chios or Monemvasia in the Peloponnese.Lane (1973), p. 410 In June 1656 however, a combined Venetian‚ÄìMaltese fleet of 67 ships under Marcello inflicted on the Ottomans, with 108 ships under Kenan Pasha, their \\"worst naval defeat since Lepanto\\":Finkel (2006), p. 248 Sixty Ottoman ships were destroyed and 24 captured and 5,000 Christian galley slaves set free, although the Venetians and Maltese suffered some casualties too, including the loss of Captain General Marcello.Setton (1991), p. 183 Although in the aftermath of this victory the Maltese contingent departed, the scale of their success enabled the Venetians under Barbado Doer to seize Tenedos on 8 July and Lemnos on 20 August.Setton (1991), pp. 183‚Äì184 Using the two islands, strategically located near the entrance of the Straits, as forward bases, the Venetian blockade became much more effective. As a result, the resupply of Crete was effectively cut off, and Constantinople itself suffered a shortage of food during the following winter.Finkel (2006), pp. 251‚Äì252 In 1657, the Ottomans reversed the situation. A new and energetic Grand Vizier, K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha, armed with almost dictatorial authority, had been appointed in September 1656, and reinvigorated the Ottoman war effort.Shaw (1976), p. 209Setton (1991), p. 190 The fleet was strengthened under the new Kapudan Pasha, Topal Mehmed, and in March, the Ottomans succeeded in evading the Venetian blockade of the Straits and sailed towards Tenedos. They did not attack the island however, because the Venetian garrison was too strong.Setton (1991), p. 185 In May, the Venetians under Lazzaro Mocenigo achieved some minor victories, on 3 May and two weeks later at Suazich. Reinforced by Papal and Maltese ships, Mocenigo sailed to the Dardanelles, awaiting the renewed sally of the Ottoman fleet, which came on 17 July. Due to disagreements among the Christian commanders, the allied battle line had not been completely formed, and the Ottoman fleet was able to exit the Narrows before battle was joined.Setton (1991), p. 186 The battle consisted of a series of actions over three days, with both fleets drifting south and west out of the Dardanelles into the Aegean. The battle ended in the evening of 19 July, when an explosion destroyed the Venetian flagship and killed Mocenigo, forcing the allied fleet to withdraw. In this battle, the Venetians had inflicted heavier casualties on the Ottomans than they had suffered, but the Ottomans had achieved their goal: the blockade was broken.Setton (1991), pp. 186‚Äì188 Under the personal direction of the Grand Vizier and strengthened by men and ships from the Barbary states,Shaw (1976), p. 210 the Ottoman fleet proceeded to recover Lemnos, on 31 August, and Tenedos, on 12 November, thus removing any hope the Venetians may have had of re-establishing the blockade as firmly as before.Setton (1991), p. 189Finkel (2006), p. 256 Stalemate, 1658‚Äì1666 In 1658, Ottoman power was redirected north in a campaign against George II R√°k√≥czi, Prince of Transylvania, which evolved into a long conflict with the Habsburgs. For the next few years, the Venetian fleet, again under the command of Morosini, unsuccessfully attempted to maintain the blockade of the Straits of the Dardanelles. Morosini also resumed his tactic of attacking Ottoman strongholds: a siege of the island of Santa Maura (Lefkada) in August 1658 failed, but in 1659, the Venetians, aided by the Maniots, sacked Kalamata in the Peloponnese, followed by Torone in the Chalcidice, Karystos in Euboea, and √áe≈üme. However, since Venice could not spare forces to occupy these places, these raids gained the Republic nothing of substance. On the Ottoman side, K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed ordered the construction of two new forts, Sedd el Bahr (\\"Rampart of the Sea\\") and Kilid Bahr (\\"Key of the Sea\\"), at the European shore of the entrance of the Dardanelles, to prohibit the Venetians from entering the Straits again.Duffy (1979), pp. 196‚Äì197 In the meantime, war- weariness had set in among the Venetians, who suffered from the disruption in trade. Peace feelers were sent to the Ottomans, but their demand for the full concession of Crete as a condition for peace was unacceptable to the Republic.Setton (1991), pp. 188‚Äì189 With the end of the war between France and Spain however, the Venetians became encouraged, hoping to receive increased assistance in money and men, especially from the French, whose traditionally good relations with the Porte had soured of late. This support did indeed soon develop, when individuals or whole companies of men from across Western Europe volunteered for the Republic's army, while Christian rulers also felt obliged to provide men, supplies and ships.Setton (1991), pp. 214‚Äì216 The first French contingent of 4,200 men under Prince Almerigo d'Este arrived in April 1660, along with further contingents of German mercenaries, troops from Savoy, and Maltese, Tuscan and French ships. Despite this increase in strength, Morosini's operations in 1660 were a failure: an assault on Canea in August succeeded in taking the outlying fortifications but failed to retake the city itself; similarly, an attack against the Ottoman siege lines at Candia in September achieved some success, but did not break the Ottoman siege. Following the death of Prince d'Este at Naxos shortly after, the French contingent returned home, followed soon after by a disheartened Morosini, who was succeeded by his kinsman Giorgio.Setton (1991), pp. 190‚Äì191 In 1661, Giorgio Morosini scored a few minor successes: he broke an Ottoman blockade of Tinos, and, pursuing the Ottoman fleet, defeated it off Milos. The next few years however were relatively idle. Although the Ottomans were heavily engaged with the Austrians in Hungary, and that their fleet rarely sallied forth, the Venetians failed to make use of this opportunity, and, except for the intercept of a supply convoy from Alexandria off Kos in 1662, there was little action.Setton (1991), pp. 192‚Äì193 Final phase of the war, 1666‚Äì1669 Grand Vizier K√∂pr√ºl√º Fazƒ±l Ahmed Pasha If the Venetians were idle, the Ottomans were not: with the signing of the Peace of Vasv√°r in 1664, they were able to focus their strength against Crete. Grand Vizier K√∂pr√ºl√º Fazƒ±l Ahmed initiated large preparations in the winter of 1665/66, and dispatched 9,000 men to bolster the Ottoman forces in Crete.Setton (1991), p. 193 An Ottoman peace proposal, which would have allowed Venice to keep Candia against an annual payment of tribute was rejected,Finkel (2006), p. 270 and in May 1666, the Ottoman army, under the personal leadership of the Grand Vizier, departed from Thrace for southern Greece, whence it would embark for Crete during the winter. In February 1667, the Venetians received significant reinforcements from France and Savoy, totaling 21 warships and some 6,000 men, but, as in past years, disagreements among the leaders of the various contingents over precedence (France, the Papal States, Malta, Naples, Sicily contributed ships and men) hampered operations.Setton (1991), p. 194 At the time, Catherine of Braganza, Queen of England, involved herself in the effort to relieve Candia, but failed to persuade her husband Charles II to take any action. Francesco Morosini, now again Captain General, sought to engage the Ottomans, but they avoided battle, and using their superior resources and bases, they steadily kept their forces on Crete supplied. The only allied success in 1667 was the repulsion of an Ottoman raid on Cerigo (Kythera).Setton (1991), p. 195 On 8 March 1668, the Venetians were victorious in a hard-fought night battle off the island of St Pelagia, where 2,000 Ottoman troops and 12 galleys attempted to seize a small Venetian galley squadron. Forewarned of their intentions Morosini reinforced it, and won a costly victory, which was to be Venice's last victory at sea in this war.Setton (1991), pp. 196‚Äì197 Reinforced again with Papal and Hospitaller ships, the Venetians maintained a blockade of Canea, the Ottomans' main supply base, during summer. To secure their anchorage off St Todero island, the allied forces seized the fortress island of St Marina,Setton (1991), pp. 199‚Äì200 a minor success which did not in the end prevent the Kapudan pasha's fleet, bearing fresh troops and supplies, from reaching Canea in September, after the Maltese‚ÄìPapal squadron had departed.Setton (1991), p. 205 =Fall of Candia= German map of the final phase of the Siege of Candia. It clearly illustrates the city's trace italienne fortifications, and the proximity of the characteristic Ottoman siege trenches, especially in the northwestern sector (bottom right), to the walls. The new Ottoman army arrived on the island during the winter of 1666/1667, and in 22 May, the final phase of the siege, overseen by the Grand Vizier himself, began. It lasted 28 months. In the assaults sorties that followed, 108,000 Turks and 29,088 Christians lost their lives. These casualties included 280 Venetian noblemen, a figure equivalent to roughly a quarter of the Grand Council. Faced with the renewed Ottoman assault and a struggling economy, despite the prospect of considerable reinforcements from Western Europe, in 1668 the Signoria hoped to end the war by striking a peace settlement with the Ottomans.Setton (1991), p. 206 Indeed, the Venetians hoped to use the imminent arrival of reinforcements to secure concessions from the Ottomans.Setton (1991), p. 214 Admiral Andrea Valier was at first appointed as envoy, but fell ill and was quickly replaced by the elderly nobleman Alvise da Molin.Setton (1991), pp. 206‚Äì209 Molin and his embassy traveled to Larissa, where the Ottoman court resided during one of the Sultan's hunting expeditions.Setton (1991), p. 212 The Ottomans proposed that Venice keep one half of Crete, but the Signoria, emboldened by further pledges of reinforcements, especially from France, and renewed turmoil at the Ottoman court and within the Empire, refused the offer.Setton (1991), pp. 216‚Äì218 Molin, in the meantime transported by the Ottomans to Canea in Crete, was ordered to continue negotiations and to continue observing the Ottomans' strength and intentions, but not commit himself or the Republic.Setton (1991), pp. 217‚Äì219 Schematics detailing the Ottoman trenches and mines and the Venetian counter-mines at Candia, by Johann Bernhard Scheither, 1672. On 19 June, the first part of the long-awaited French contingent (in total some 6,000 soldiers and 31 ships), under the command of Fran√ßois, Duke of Beaufort, arrived at Candia. The second part, comprising the galley fleet, would arrive on 3 July.Setton (1991), pp. 223‚Äì224 The Ottomans had been making steady progress over the past years, having reached the outer bastions of the fortress; the defenders were in dire straits, while most of the city of Candia lay ruined.Setton (1991), pp. 224‚Äì225 The French staged their first sally on 25 June. Caught by surprise, the Ottomans were quickly routed, but the French became disorganized among the siege trenches, and an Ottoman counter-attack drove them back. The attack thus ended in disaster, costing the French some 800 dead, including the Duke of Beaufort himself, who was hit by a bullet and left on the field.Setton (1991), p. 225 The arrival of the second half of the French expeditionary force revived the defenders' morale, and a combined attack was agreed upon, involving bombardment of the Ottoman siege lines by the powerful allied fleet. The attack was launched on 25 July, in an impressive display of firepower: up to 15,000 cannonballs were said to have been fired by the fleet alone.Setton (1991), p. 226 The Ottomans however were well-protected by their deep earthworks, and suffered comparatively little damage, while things went awry for the Christian fleet, as an accident caused the explosion of the French ship Th√©r√®se, which in turn caused significant casualties among the surrounding French and Venetian ships. This failure, coupled with the disaster of the previous month, further soured the relations between the French and the Venetians. Cooperation was distinctly lacking in the few operations attempted during the next few weeks, while the bad supply situation, the spread of sickness among their troops and the continuous attrition of their forces in the everyday fighting at Candia made the French commanders especially keen to depart.Setton (1991), pp. 226‚Äì227 The French contingent eventually departed on 20 August. Two Ottoman assaults on the 25th were repulsed, but to Morosini, it was clear that the city could no longer be held.Setton (1991), pp. 227‚Äì228 After a council of war on 27 August, but without first consulting Venice, it was decided to capitulate. On 5 September 1669, the city was surrendered to the Ottomans, while the survivors of the garrison, the citizens and their treasures were evacuated.Finkel (2006), p. 271Finlay (1856), p. 132 On his own initiative, Morosini concluded a permanent peace agreement with the Ottomans, which, under the circumstances, was relatively generous: Venice would retain the Aegean islands of Tinos and Kythera and the isolated island fortresses of Spinalonga, Gramvousa and Souda off the Cretan coast, as well as the gains made in Dalmatia. =War in Dalmatia= During the , the Venetians in Dalmatia with the support of the local population managed to compel the Ottoman garrison of Klis Fortress to surrender. The Dalmatian front was a separate theater of operations, which was involved in the early phase of the war. The conditions there were almost reverse to those in Crete: for the Ottomans, it was too far away and relatively insignificant, while the Venetians operated near their own bases of supply and had undisputed control of the sea, being thus able to easily reinforce their coastal strongholds.Nicolle (1989), p. 40 The Ottomans launched a large-scale attack in 1646, and made some significant gains, including the capture of the islands of Krk, Pag and Cres,Setton (1991), p. 143 and most importantly, the supposedly impregnable fortress of Novigrad, which surrendered on 4 July, after only two days of bombardment.Setton (1991), p. 142 The Ottomans were now able to threaten the two main Venetian strongholds in Dalmatia, Zadar and Split.Setton (1991), p. 144 In the next year however, the tide turned, as the Venetian commander Leonardo Foscolo seized several forts, retook Novigrad, temporarily captured the fortress of Knin and took Klis, while a month-long siege of the fortress of ≈†ibenik by the Ottomans in August and September failed. During the next few years, military operations stalled because of an outbreak of famine and plague amongst the Venetians at Zadar, while both sides focused their resources in the Aegean area.Setton (1991), p. 162 As other fronts took priority for the Ottomans, no further operations occurred in the Dalmatian theater. Peace in 1669 found the Republic of Venice with significant gains in Dalmatia, its territory tripled, and its control of the Adriatic thus secured. Aftermath The surrender of Candia ended the four and a half centuries of Venetian rule in Crete, and brought the Ottoman Empire to its temporary territorial zenith.Faroqhi (2006), p. 22 At the same time, the cost and casualties incurred during this prolonged war contributed greatly to the decline of the Ottoman state during the latter 17th century. On the other hand, Venice had lost its greatest and most prosperous colony, its pre-eminent trading position in the Mediterranean had diminished,Cooper (1979), p. 232 and its treasury was exhausted, having spent some 4,253,000 ducats on the defense of Candia alone. To all this, the Dalmatian gains were insufficient compensation. Upon his return to Venice in 1670, Morosini was tried on charges of insubordination and treason, but was acquitted. Fifteen years later, he would lead the Venetian forces in the Morean War, where the Republic attempted, for the last time, to reverse its losses and reestablish itself as one of the major powers of the Eastern Mediterranean.Faroqhi (2006), pp. 58, 115 During that war, in 1692, a Venetian fleet attempted to retake Candia, but failed. The last Venetian strongholds off Crete fell in the last Turkish‚ÄìVenetian War in 1715. Crete would remain under Ottoman control until 1897, when it became an autonomous state. The island continued under nominal Ottoman suzerainty until the Balkan Wars. In their aftermath, the Ottoman Sultan dropped any claim on the island, and on 1 December 1913 it was formally united to Greece.Detorakis (1986), pp. 438‚Äì456 Following the fall of Candia, fears rose that the Ottomans would attack Malta. In 1670, the Order of St. John began to improve the island's defences with the construction of the Cottonera Lines and Fort Ricasoli.

He was born at Ludgvan, Cornwall, and baptised on 27 August 1695, described as the son of John Oliver the owner of the Trevarno Estate.The statement of some writers that he was the illegitimate child of William Oliver (1659‚Äì1716) may be dismissed from consideration (according to the ODNB article). The ODNB article on the other William Oliver is by . It makes no reference to this suggestion. His family, originally seated at Trevarnoe in Sithney, resided afterwards in Ludgvan, and the estate of Treneere in Madron, which belonged to him, was sold in 1768 after his death. When he decided to erect a monument in Sithney churchyard to the memory of his parents, Alexander Pope wrote the epitaph and drew the design of the pillar.Quarterly Review, October 1875 He was admitted a pensioner of Pembroke College, Cambridge on 17 September 1714, graduated M.B. in 1720, and M.D. in 1725, and to complete his medical training, entered at Leiden University on 15 November 1720. On 8 July 1756 he was incorporated at Oxford, and he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 22 January 1729‚Äì30. Medical career On returning from Leyden, Oliver practised for a time at Plymouth, where he introduced inoculation for smallpox. but about 1725 he settled at Bath and remained there for the rest of his life, obtaining in a very short time the leading practice of the city. This was mainly due to his friendship with Ralph Allen (a fellow Cornishman, who introduced him to Pope, Warburton, and the rest of the guests at Prior Park), and with Dr. William Borlase, his ‚Äòfriend and relation,‚Äô who, after being his patient in 1730, sent to him the gentry of the west country. =Hospital= Oliver took great pains in obtaining subscriptions for the erection of the Water or General Hospital, now called the Royal Mineral Water Hospital, at Bath, and in 1737 made an offer of some land for its site, which was at first accepted, but afterwards declined. Next year he was appointed one of the treasurers to the fund, and in July 1739 he became a deputy-president. On 1 May 1740 he was appointed physician to the hospital, and on the same day Jeremiah (known as Jerry) Peirce became the surgeon. The regulations for the admission and removal of English patients were drawn up by him; and in 1756, when the privileges were extended to patients from Scotland and Ireland, he compiled a set of rules applicable to their case. Until 1 May 1761, when he and Peirce both resigned, he ruled the institution. The third article in Charleton's Three Tracts on Bath Waters, 1774, consisted of ‚Äòhistories of hospital cases under the care of the late Dr. Oliver,‚Äô a subject on which he had himself contemplated the publication of a volume; and Some Observations on Stomach Complaints, which were found among his papers, were printed in pp. 76‚Äì95 of the same work. Peirce and Oliver were painted together by William Hoare, R.A. in 1742, in a picture now in the board-room of the hospital, in the act of examining three patients, candidates for admission. =Controversy= Oliver's position in the medical world of Bath involved him in trouble. Archibald Cleland, one of the hospital surgeons, was dismissed in 1743 on a charge of improper conduct, and the dismissal led to many pamphlets. An inquiry was held into the circumstances, under the presidency of Philip, brother of Ralph, Allen; this resulted in Oliver's conduct being highly commended. In 1757 Oliver and some other physicians in the city declined to attend any consultations with William Baylies, M.D. and Charles Lucas, M.D., in consequence of their reflections on the use and abuse of the waters, and their censures on the conduct of the physicians at the hospital. Much correspondence ensued, and it was published as proving the existence of a ‚Äòphysical confederacy in Bath.‚Äô His medical skill is mentioned by Mrs. Anne Pitt.Suffolk Letters, 1824, ii. 246‚Äì50 and by Mrs. DelanyAutobiography, ii. 17, iii. 625 He and Peirce attended Ralph Allen in his last illness, and each received a complimentary legacy of ¬£100. The Bath Oliver and Bath Bun Oliver is said to have invented the Bath bun,Biography of Dr Oliver however it proved too fattening for his rheumatic patients, and so he invented the ‚ÄòBath Oliver‚Äô biscuit, and shortly before his death confided the recipe to his coachman Atkins, giving him at the same time ¬£100 in money and ten sacks of the finest wheat-flour. The fortunate recipient opened a shop in Green Street, and soon acquired a large fortune. The ‚ÄòBath Oliver‚Äô is still a well-known brand.Bath Oliver biscuits are now known as \\"Fortt's Bath Oliver\\" and are made by United Biscuits UB website (accessed 8 January 2008). Personal life Oliver purchased in 1746, as a vacation residence, a small farmhouse two miles from Box, near Bath, and called it Trevarnoe, after the scene of his childhood and the abode of his fathers. For many years before his death he was subject to the gout. He died at Bath on 17 March 1764, and was buried in All Saint's Church of Weston, near that city, where an inscription ‚Äòon a white tablet, supported by palm-branches,‚Äô was erected to his memory. There is also a plain mural tablet to his memory in Bath Abbey. The statement in the Life and Times of Selina, countess of Huntingdon (i. 450‚Äì1), that he remained ‚Äòa most inveterate infidel till a short time before his death‚Äô is probably an exaggeration. He was generally admitted to have been an eminently sensible man, and one also of a most compassionate and benevolent nature. His library was sold in 1764. His son, the third William Oliver, matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 20 January 1748‚Äì9, aged 18, and his name appears on the books at Leyden on 21 September 1753. The eldest daughter married a son of the Rev. John Acland, rector of Broadclyst, Devonshire; the second daughter, Charlotte, married, 14 April 1752, Sir John Pringle, bart., F.R.S. Some of his descendants are said to have been living at Bath in 1852. Writings Oliver published, in 1753, Myra: a pastoral dialogue sacred to the memory of a lady who died 29 Dec. 1753, aged 25. His Practical Essay on the Use and Abuse of warm Bathing in Gouty Cases came out in 1751, passed into a second edition in 1751, and into a third in 1764. Philip Thicknesse inserted some remarks on this essay in his Valetudinarian's Bath Guide, (1780, pp. 30‚Äì36). Oliver was also the anonymous author of A Faint Sketch of the Life, Character, and Manners of the late Mr. Nash, which was printed at Bath for John Keene, and sold at 3d. It was praised by Oliver Goldsmith as ‚Äòwritten with much good sense and still more good nature,‚Äô and it was embodied in Goldsmith's Life of Beau Nash. It also appeared in the Public Ledger of 12 March 1761, and in the Rev. Richard Warner's History of Bath, (pp. 370‚Äì1). To the Philosophical Transactions for 1723 and 1755 respectively he contributed brief papers on medical topics, the former being addressed to Dr. Richard Mead. Oliver wrote some elegiac lines on the death of Ralph Thicknesse; he was standing at Thicknesse's elbow at the moment that Thicknesse fell dead as he was playing the first fiddle in a performance of a piece of his own composition at a concert in Bath.cf. Philip Thicknesse, New Prose Bath Guide, p. 33; John Nichols, Literary Anecdotes ix. 253; Britton, Bath Abbey Church, p. 92; Samuel Egerton Brydges, Restituta, iv. 421‚Äì2) His lines to Sir John Cope ‚Äòupon his catching Sir Anthony's fire by drinking Bath waters,‚Äô are in Mrs. Stopford Sackville's manuscripts.Hist. MSS. Comm. 9th Rep. App. iii. 132 Oliver applied to Dr. Borlase for minerals for Pope's grotto, and his name frequently occurs in the letters of Pope and Borlase at Castle Horneck, near Penzance. A letter to Oliver from Pope, dated 8 October 1740, and the property of Henry George Bohn, was inserted with the first draft of the reply in Carruthers's Life of Pope.Bohn's Illustrated Library, 1857, pp. 173‚Äì4 Several other letters were formerly in the possession of Upcott. One, dated 28 August 1743, is printed in Roscoe's Works of Pope, (i. 541‚Äì2), and it was reprinted with two others which were taken from the European Magazine.1791, pt. ii. p. 409, and 1792, pt. i. p. 6, in Courthope's edition, x. 242‚Äì5. In the summer of 1743 Oliver wrote to Pope to free himself from all knowledge of John Tillard's attack on William Warburton, which was dedicated to him without his knowledge (Works, ed. Courthope, ix. 233). Two letters from Warburton to Oliver are in Nichols's Literary Anecdotes, (v. 581‚Äì582), and several communications from him to Doddridge from 1743 to 1749 are contained in the latter's Correspondence, (v. 223‚Äì225, 302‚Äì4, v. 66‚Äì7, 126‚Äì9). Three letters from Stephen Duck to him are printed in the European Magazine, (1795, pt. i. p. 80 and pt. ii. p. 79). He bestowed many favours on Duck, and was, no doubt, the polite son of √Üsculapius depicted in that author's Journey to Marlborough, Bath, &c.; (Works, 1753, p. 75). A letter from Oliver to Dr. Ward on two Roman altars discovered at Bath is in the British Museum, (Addit. MS. 6181, f. 63), and three more letters referring to some dirty and miserly old acquaintance of Jacob Tonson at Bath in 1735, are in Addit. MS. 28275, fols. 356‚Äì61. Some manuscript letters to James Jurin belong to the Royal Society. Benjamin Heath dedicated to him in 1740 The Essay towards a demonstrative Proof of the Divine Existence; plate 18 in the Antiquities of Cornwall was engraved at his expense and inscribed to him by Dr. Borlase; and the later impressions of Mary Chandler's ‚ÄòDescription of Bath‚Äô contained (pp. 21‚Äì3) some verses to him acknowledging that he had corrected her poem, and that NotesReferences * Category:1695 births Category:1764 deaths Category:18th-century English medical doctors Category:English philanthropists Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Alumni of Pembroke College, Cambridge Category:Leiden University alumni Category:People from Ludgvan, Cornwall Category:Cornish philanthropists Category:People from Bath, Somerset Category:18th-century philanthropists ","title":"William Oliver (physician)"},{"id":"15106119","text":"Greek Left (, Elliniki Aristera, abbreviated EAR) was a Greek political party.

It focuses on the Mardi Gras celebrations in Mobile, Alabama, the oldest in the United States. It reveals the separate mystic societies established and maintained by black and white groups, and acknowledges the complex racial history of a city with a slaveholding past. While showing the mystic societies' ties to economic, class and racial stratification, the film also showed the beginnings of interaction between the black and white courts. It also tells some of the history of Africatown, a community formed north of Mobile in 1860 by Africans from Ghana, transported illegally as slaves to Mobile decades after the end of the slave trade. The film competed in the Documentary Competition at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. It had a limited release in New York on July 25, 2008, and ran on Independent Lens, a PBS series featuring independent films, in 2009. It was distributed by The Cinema Guild.

Licensed to Hillsborough, New Hampshire, United States, it serves the Manchester, New Hampshire market. The station is owned by Bill Binnie's Binnie Media, through licensee WBIN, Inc. It airs a news/talk radio format in the daytime and carries the CBS Sports Radio Network at night. History The original construction permit for the station was granted on August 4, 1987, under the call sign of WRCI; a license to cover was granted on September 7, 1990. However, the station's original owners, Empire Radio Partners, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1992, and the station was sold to Radioworks in 1993. By 1994, WRCI was serving as a simulcast of its then- sister station WJYY (105.5), an adult contemporary station. The station had changed simulcast partners to WNHI (93.3; now WNHW), a classic rock station, by 1996. Radioworks sold its stations to Vox Media in 1999, and on December 27 the station was converted to the current news/talk format by way of a simulcast with another Vox station, WKXL, as part of a format shuffle that resulted in WKXL's original FM station, on 102.3, becoming the country music station WOTX-FM (now WXRG). The WKXL-FM call sign moved to 107.7 the following February. Vox sold WKXL to Embro Communications in 2002. The sale did not include WKXL-FM or its programming; as a result, WKXL launched a separate news/talk format, with its prior programming remaining on 107.7 under the new call letters of WTPL. Embro took over WTPL as well under a local marketing agreement the next year, and reintroduced some shared programming, including a talk show hosted by Arnie Arnesen. Vox then sold WTPL to Great Eastern Radio (whose principal, Jeff Shapiro, had co-owned Vox with Bruce Danzinger), in 2004, and soon afterward the station again became independent of WKXL, relocating to studios in Bow, New Hampshire, and a transmitter atop Pats Peak, both originally constructed for WNNH (99.1). (Clark Smidt, who founded WNNH, has had involvement with WTPL.) Effective August 1, 2017, Great Eastern Radio sold WTPL, WLKZ, and WZEI to Dirk Nadon's Lakes Media, LLC for $2.6 million. Lakes Media immediately agreed to sell WTPL to Binnie Media for $1.3 million and turned over the station's operations to Binnie under a local marketing agreement; the sale was completed on November 16, 2017. Programming Weekday programming includes a local morning news and talk program, Good Morning New Hampshire, hosted by Peter St. James and Pat Kelly, from 6:00 to 10:00 am; followed by the nationally syndicated talk program The Financial Exchange from 10:00 am to 12:00 noon.

It has been attributed to Aphra Behn, but this attribution remains in dispute. The novel is \\"based loosely on an affair between Ford, Lord Grey of Werke, and his wife's sister, Lady Henrietta Berkeley, a scandal that broke in London in 1682\\". It was originally published as three separate volumes: Love-Letters Between a Noble-Man and his Sister (1684), Love-Letters from a Noble Man to his Sister: Mixt with the History of Their Adventures. The Second Part by the Same Hand (1685), and The Amours of Philander and Silvia (1687). The copyright holder was Joseph Hindmarsh, later joined by Jacob Tonson. The novel has been of interest for several reasons. First, some argue that it is the first novel in English. Its connection to Behn means that it has been the subject of a number of books and articles, especially considering Behn's role in the development of the novel and amatory fiction. Secondly, its commentary on the political scandal of the times demonstrate the ways that amatory fiction interprets political appetite and ambition as sexual lasciviousness. Plot summary ;Characters * Silvia: a beautiful young woman, who slowly becomes more calculating and deceptive as she falls from grace; romantically connected to Philander, Octavio, and Alonzo * Philander: a young handsome man, who enjoys conquering women; romantically connected to Silvia and Calista * Octavio: a handsome, rich, and noble man; one of the States of Holland; Calista's brother; in love with Silvia and a rival to Philander * Cesario: Prince of Condy; leader of the rebellion of the Huguenots in France; aspires to become the next King of France; he is the King's bastard son * Brilljard: Philander's servant; later Silvia's lawful husband, who promised not to claim her as his wife; however, he falls in love with her * Calista: Octavio's sister, married to an old Spanish Count; Philander's new conquest * Sebastian: Octavio's uncle, one of the States of Holland as well * Sir Mr. Alonzo Jr.: a handsome young gentleman, nephew of the governor of Flanders, by birth a Spaniard; a womanizer * Osell Hermione: Cesario's mistress, later his wife; neither young nor beautiful * Fergusano: one of the two wizards appointed to Hermione; Scottish; deals with black magic =Part I= ;Dedication Addressed to Thomas Condon. This dedication is to a relatively unknown young man. The author compares his passionate nature to Philander's, but encourages him to act prudently and judiciously in the art of love. ;Plot Silvia, a young beautiful woman, is wooed by Philander, her brother-in-law, in an \\"incestuous\\" affair. Philander is ultimately successful, and at the end of the novel, he and Silvia flee their country and their families. The plot is the slow decline of honor and nobility, as well as the psychological effects of love. The novel is told through letters between Silvia and Philander that give a deeply personal nature to the affair. Silvia is a loose representation of Lady Henrietta Berkeley, daughter to George Berkeley, 1st Earl of Berkeley who was a prominent Tory politician. She eloped in 1682 with the Whig Ford Grey. Meanwhile, Henrietta's sister and Grey's wife Mary Berkeley was having an affair with James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, Charles II's illegitimate son. As Monmouth would go on later to challenge his uncle James II for the throne when Charles died, the scandal gave the author considerable political fodder to pull from. =Part II= Silvia, disguised as a young man with the name Fillmond, and Philander run away to Holland. Brilljard, who has been married to Silvia to save her from being married to another man by her parents, and two male servants accompany them. On their journey they meet a young Hollander, Octavio. Quickly, a strong friendship develops between Philander and Octavio. Both Brilljard and Octavio develop feelings for Silvia, and when she falls into a violent fever, her true sex is discovered by the servants and the whole truth of their story is revealed to Octavio. Philander leaves the country to avoid being captured by the king, leaving Silvia to recover. Philander's affection lessen in his absence, and both Brilljard and Octavio reveal their love to Silvia. She denies them both. Angered by Philander's lessening affection, Silvia has Octavio write a letter to Philander in which he confesses his love for her, asking Philander for his permission to do pursue her. Philander, who has also fallen in love with someone else‚ÄîCalista, wife of the Count of Clarinau‚Äîencourages Octavio. Octavio reveals Philander's inconstancy, angered because Calista is his sister. Upset by Philander's betrayal, Silvia attempts suicide but is stopped. After a series of misunderstandings, Silvia enlists Octavio's help in her scheme to get revenge on Philander for successfully wooing Calista. Octavio proposes, and after Silvia learns of Philander's betrayal, she agrees to marry him. The second part ends with Silvia and her maid, Antonett, setting off for a church in a nearby village to meet Octavio. =Part III= Titlepage of The Amours of Philander and Silvia (1687) ;Dedication To Lord Spencer: The author praises Spencer for his noble birth and the glorious future, that is surely destined for him. The author compares Spencer to Cesario, saying that he is too loyal to be like him, but also warning him against unlawful ambition. ;The Lovers The main plot of last volume is difficult to ascertain. Many new characters, such as Alonzo, are introduced and the plot contains various love affairs, disguises, mistaken identities, and personal and political intrigues. Despite the title \\"The Amours of Philander and Silvia\\" the love between these two characters does not seem to play the major role any more (as it did in part 1). Their feelings towards each other are only dissembled and their relationship to other people gain in importance. Silvia continues to be pursued by Octavio and by Brilljard; Philander pursues Calista and other women. Furthermore, a large part of the action is concerned with Cesario's political scheme to gain the crown. In addition, the narrative form shifts from epistolary to an omniscient narrator's voice, creating distance between the character's motivations and what the reader is allowed to know. Part two ended with Silvia meeting Octavio at a nearby church. Their marriage is prevented by Brilljard, Silvia's lawful husband, who has grown jealous of Octavio. Although Brilljard had promised never to claim her as his wife, he reveals in public that he is already married to her. Silvia and Octavio's reputations are damaged, and although Octavio has learned that she is already married to Brilljard, he still wants to marry her. After Silvia evades the advances of Octavio's uncle Sebastian, she and Octavio flee to Brussels. Meanwhile, Calista leaves Philander and takes orders after learning he has another mistress. Philander returns to Silvia and quickly woos her again. Octavio and Philander duel over Silvia, and Octavio is badly wounded. Silvia leaves him and absconds with Philander to a nearby town. However, their affections quickly dwindle. Philander starts having other affairs, and Silvia gives birth to a child that is barely mentioned in the text. Its fate is unknown. Silvia begins leveraging physical affection for loyalty. She enlists Brilljard as her confidant in an attempt to win back Octavio, promising Brilljard sexual favors for his help. Similarly to his sister Calista, Octavio takes orders to avoid unlawful passions. He settles a good pension on Silvia so she can support herself honorably, but she immediately spends it on fine clothes and jewels. In this new guise, she impresses Alonzo at the \\"Toure,\\" who she had met earlier while inhabiting the guise of a man. With Brilljard's help she manages to deprive him of his fortune. ;The Political Plot: The political plot is focused on Cesario's ambition of becoming King of France. His relationship to Osell Hermione plays a crucial role in this part of the story. She is a former mistress to Cesario and is already past her beauty. To the surprise of everyone, the handsome prince falls in love with her. Only the reader gets to know the reason: Fergusano, a Scottish wizard, made a philtre, that bewitched Cesario and attached him to Hermione. She finally becomes his wife, and stirs up his ambition to become King with the help of two wizards. Cesario leaves with all his men from Brussels to France, where he proclaims himself King. Cesario's army is defeated by the Royal Army due to his impatience and losing the loyalty of his friends. He is eventually executed. Attribution questions Love-Letters was never published under Aphra Behn's name in the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries. The primary reason the novels are ascribed to Behn is because of Gerald Langbaine, who in 1691 published Account of the English Dramatick Poets that named Behn as the author. Another reason for the attribution is that the second volume has a title page that read \\"Printed for A.B.\\" Both prefaces of the second and third volumes are signed \\"A.B.\\" Other evidence includes: \\"the fact that Behn was having money difficulties and was having trouble selling her plays by the mid-1680s, as evidenced from her letter borrowing money from [Jacob] Tonson, and that her previous plays and poems indicate that she might have the literary skill to execute Love-Letters.\\" However, the evidence is only circumstantial. Anonymous publication was very common, and Behn usually did not publish anonymously (The Rover is an exception). Nor can the initials on the book be concretely attributed to \\"Aphra Behn\\". Janet Todd explains that, similarly to using anonymous, \\"A. B. is precisely what anyone might call him or herself when not wanting to be recognized or when insisting on standing for a group or for everyone.\\" In addition, Behn's canon is notoriously hard to pin down, and there are many other works that have been attributed to her incorrectly. Despite this, the attribution is commonly given to Behn without scrutiny. Leah Orr concludes that there is no evidence that Behn did not write Love-Letters, but this alone does not mean that we should argue that she did.

It is owned by Rumpke Consolidated Companies, Inc. and occupies over of a tract of land that the company owns. The landfill receives 2 million tons (2 kg) of household and industrial wastes annually. Mount Rumpke is above sea level and the highest landform in Hamilton County, Ohio, clearly visible from U.S. Route 27. It is the largest landfill in the state of Ohio and the sixth largest in the United States. It is sometimes claimed that it is the highest point in Ohio, but in fact there are higher elevations in many Ohio counties. History=Company= In the 1930s, Barney and Bill Rumpke collected garbage from their neighbors without charge in the neighborhood of Carthage in Cincinnati. Most of the waste was food scraps, which they fed to their hogs on their hog farm. Eventually, officials told them that it was unsanitary, so they stopped feeding the garbage to the pigs although their neighbors wanted them to continue to remove their garbage. Therefore, they sold their hogs and charged money to take the garbage away, creating their trash business. The Rumpke Landfill was started in 1945 and has expanded today to occupy over of land. As of 2010, Rumpke may still be considered a family operation with over 70 employees being part of the family. =Landslide and fire= On March 9, 1996, a massive landslide occurred on the north side of the landfill. The north face of the mound cracked and fell forward, exposing of buried waste. A few months after the landslide, on May 23, 1996, lightning struck near the location of the landslide, causing a fire that lasted for six days. The crack was filled in and Rumpke paid one million dollars as a fine. Attorney General Betty Montgomery called the incident \\"the largest trash landslide in Ohio history\\". =Expansion= In 2005, Rumpke was permitted to expand Rumpke Sanitary Landfill by , and it is expected to be below maximum capacity until 2022. Rumpke planned to nearly double the size of the landfill to produce a 785-acre landfill. Local zoning stymied this expansion, so Rumpke sued the township and obtained a ruling in 2010 that the dump was a public utility and therefore not subject to zoning. The township appealed to the Ohio State Supreme Court who, in September 2012, ruled in favor of the township. The decision states that Rumpke cannot proceed without approval of the Colerain Township Zoning Commission. http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20120905/NEWS/309050082/Ohio-Supreme-Court- overturns-Rumpke-case =Elevated temperatures= On August 31, 2009, Rumpke reported elevated temperatures and poor gas quality at some of their methane recovery wells. This increased rate of oxidation has increased citizen complaints of odors in the area. Montauk Energy, Rumpke, Ohio EPA, U.S. EPA, Hamilton County Department of Environmental Services (HCDOES), Hamilton County Public Health (HCPH), and Colerain Township Fire have been involved in trying to resolve the issue. =Miscellany= A 14-year-old circus elephant and the world's largest Hershey's bar are some of the items buried in the landfill. Landfill gas recovery Three methane gas recovery facilities, owned by Montauk Energy Capital, operate on the landfill. The first plant opened in 1986, then the second opened in 1995, and the third opened in 2007. These facilities convert the methane gas into natural gas. The plants can recover about of landfill gas, making it the largest recovery operation of its kind in the world. Distributed by Duke Energy Corporation, the natural gas energy from the natural gas from the three facilities combined is enough to power 25,000 homes and businesses. Air monitoring Hamilton County Department of Environmental Services (HCDOES), U.S. EPA, and Ohio EPA have been involved in monitoring the air onsite and surrounding the landfill for air pollutants. Levels of hydrogen sulfide, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, and methane are included in the measurements.

Roberts was born in Pipestone, Manitoba. He studied in Upper Canada College and graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario in 1914, student #891. From 1939, he commanded the 1st Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery in Northern France, and was serving in that position when the Germans began the Battle of France in May 1940. Roberts managed to save his regiment's guns while evacuating from Brest in Brittany during the unsuccessful attempt to establish a second British Expeditionary Force in France after the evacuation at Dunkirk. He was later promoted to Major General and appointed General Officer Commanding the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division in 1941. Roberts was put in charge of the ground troops for the raid against Dieppe, on August 19, 1942. His command post was aboard and due to poor communications he had no idea how his troops were managing, until they called for landing craft for immediate evacuation. Roberts was criticized for unnecessarily committing his reserve troops (Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal) and inadvertently increasing the casualties. He was relieved of his command six months later.Neillands, Robin The Dieppe Raid It was Roberts's inept performance during a war-game codenamed Operation Spartan in March 1943 rather than the Dieppe raid, which ended Roberts's career.English, John The Canadian Army and the Normandy Campaign: A Study of Failure in High Command, New York: Praeger, 1991 page 147. General Harry Crerar reprimanded Roberts for the poor co-ordination between the 2nd Division's artillery and infantry during Operation Spartan war-games, and that Roberts failed to have forces dig in after seizing a bridgehead despite having ample time to do so. After Operation Spartan, Roberts was judged unfit to hold a combat command. He was sent to command reinforcement units in the United Kingdom and received no further operational commands.

Earlier, two assassins had killed prominent Egyptian newspaper editor Yusuf Sibai and then rounded up as hostages several Arabs who were attending a convention in Nicosia. As Cypriot forces were trying to negotiate with the hostage-takers at the airport, Egyptian troops launched their own assault without authorization from the Cypriots. The unauthorized raid led to the Egyptians and the Cypriots exchanging gunfire, killing or injuring more than 20 of the Egyptian commandos. As a result, Egypt and Cyprus severed political ties for several years after the incident.  Hijacking  In the late hours of 18 February 1978, Yusuf Sibai, editor of a prominent Egyptian newspaper and a friend of the Egyptian President, Anwar Sadat, was assassinated by two gunmen at a convention being held at the Nicosia Hilton. The two assassins rounded up 16 Arab convention delegates as hostages (among them, two P.L.O. representatives and one Egyptian national) and demanded transportation to Larnaca International Airport. They also demanded and were supplied with a Cyprus Airways Douglas DC-8 aircraft. Following negotiations with the Cypriot authorities, the hijackers were allowed to fly the aircraft out of Cyprus with 11 hostages and four crew members. The aircraft, however, was denied permission to land in Djibouti, Syria and Saudi Arabia and was forced to return and land in Cyprus a few hours later. According to a report in Time magazine, Sadat was aggrieved by the assassination of his personal friend and begged the Cypriot President, Spyros Kyprianou to rescue the hostages and extradite the terrorists to Cairo. The Cypriot President responded by promising to oversee the rescue operation and any negotiations personally, and travelled to the airport himself. According to the same report however, Sadat dispatched an elite antiterrorism unit (Task Force 777) to Cyprus aboard a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. Cairo merely informed Kyprianou that \\"people are on the way to help rescue the hostages\\" and did not reveal who was on board nor what their intentions were. Upon landing in Cyprus, the Egyptian force immediately launched an all out assault, dispatching a single Jeep all- terrain vehicle with three men to race ahead of an estimated 58 troops (another report has this figure at 74) moving towards the hijacked aircraft on foot.  Egyptian raid  As the Egyptian troops advanced quickly towards the hijacked DC-8 aircraft and the Cypriot Special Forces who surrounded it, the Cypriot Special forces reportedly issued a single verbal warning to halt and submit, though in other reports, the Cypriots issued two verbal warnings, the second demand for the Egyptians to return to their aircraft. As this occurred, the occupants of the Jeep and the Cypriot Operators exchanged gunfire, and the Egyptian Jeep was struck by a rocket propelled grenade (RPG), as well as gunfire, killing all three occupants. As the vehicle came to a halt, the Cypriots and the main Egyptian force confronted each other at a range of less than , and it is variously reported that the Egyptians, who lacked any form of cover, dropped down onto the tarmac in prone firing positions. At this moment, the two forces engaged each other with heavy gunfire, and the Cypriots opened fire on the Egyptian C-130H aircraft with a 106 mm anti-tank missile, striking it in the nose and killing all three crew on board. With their aircraft destroyed, the Egyptian force and the Cypriot Special Forces exchanged heavy gunfire for nearly an hour in sporadic fighting on the open tarmac. Some of the Egyptian troops took cover in a nearby empty Air France aircraft. Cypriot President Spyros Kyprianou, who was watching the events unfolding from the airport control tower, was forced to withdraw from the windows and take cover as Egyptian commandos shot at the tower with automatic gunfire. Aftermath Of the Egyptian commando force, 15 men were killed, in addition to three crew of the C-130H Hercules transport aircraft who were killed when it was struck by a missile. An estimated 15 more Egyptian commandos were reported to have been taken injured to Larnaca General Hospital with gunshot wounds. Following the assault, it emerged that the surrender of the two hostage-takers had already been secured at the time of the failed Egyptian attack, and the two men were taken prisoner by the Cypriots and later extradited to Egypt, where they received death sentences, later commuted to life sentences. On 20 February, Egypt recalled its diplomatic mission and requested the Cyprus government to do the same in Cairo. Cyprus requested the withdrawal of Egypt's military attach√©. Egypt and Cyprus severed political ties for several years after the incident, until President Anwar Sadat was assassinated in 1981. President Kyprianou offered reconciliation and apologies but maintained that Cyprus could not have allowed the Egyptians to act. Other Arab countries such as Syria and Libya denounced Egypt's action.

Trouble the Water is a redemptive tale of a couple surviving failed levees, bungling bureaucrats, and their own troubled past and a portrait of a community abandoned long before Hurricane Katrina hit, featuring music by Massive Attack, Mary Mary, Citizen Cope, John Lee Hooker, The Roots, Dr. John and Blackkoldmadina. Trouble the Water is distributed by Zeitgeist Films and premiered in theaters in New York City and Los Angeles on August 22, 2008, followed by a national release in more than 200 theaters. It had its television premiere on HBO and has been rebroadcast on National Geographic Channel and Turner Classic Movies. Trouble the Water is available on DVD. Synopsis Trouble the Water opens the day the filmmakers meet 24-year-old aspiring rap artist Kimberly Rivers Roberts and her husband Scott at a Red Cross shelter in central Louisiana, then flashes back two weeks, with Kimberly turning her new video camera on herself and her neighbors trapped in their Ninth Ward attic as the storm rages, the levees fail and the flood waters rise. Weaving 15 minutes of Roberts' ground zero footage shot the day before and the morning of the storm, with archival news segments, other home video, and verit√© footage they filmed over two years, director/producers Tia Lessin and Carl Deal document the journey of a young couple living on the margins who survive the storm and seize a chance for a new beginning. Trouble the Water explores issues of race, class, and the relationship of government to its citizens, issues that continue to haunt America, years after the levees failed in New Orleans. Critical reception The film appeared on several critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008.  Subtitles Trouble the Water was presented in France, with French subtitles translated by Celine Prost.

Walt Unsworth, London: Allen Lane, 1981, p. 15 The magazine covers all aspects of mountains and mountaineering, including expeditions, adventure, art, literature, geography, history, geology, medicine, ethics and the mountain environment, and the history of mountain exploration, from early ascents in the Alps, exploration of the Himalaya and the succession of attempts on Mount Everest, to present-day exploits.
