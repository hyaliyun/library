Brown Memorial Block is a historic commercial building at Congress and Casco Streets in downtown Portland, Maine. Built in 1883 to a design by John Calvin Stevens, it is one of the city's few examples of Queen Anne Victorian commercial architecture. It is named in honor of John B. Brown, founder in 1855 of the Portland Sugar Company. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history The Brown Memorial Block stands on the northwest side of Congress Street, the principal road through the city's downtown area, at the western corner with Casco Street. It is a large 4-1/2 story masonry structure, built primarily out of brick, occupying about 2/3 of the block between Casco and Oak Streets. Its main facade is long, with four store fronts which are slightly stepped due to the sloping lot. Its window bays are articulated by brick pilasters, and are set in groups of varying sizes. Near the center of the facade is the main entrance, recessed behind a stone arch; the bays above this entrance include a round-arch window on the third floor, and it is capped by one of two large gabled projections from the hipped roof, and flanked by a pair decoratively- topped chimneys. The hip roof is obscured by a wall, added in the mid-20th century, which gives the roof a mansard appears; it was added to minimize snow falling from the roof onto the sidewalk below. The interior has for the most part been covered over by reversible modern finishes. The building was designed by John Calvin Stevens, then already a well-known Portland architect, and was built in 1883. John B. Brown, in whose honor it is named, founded the Portland Sugar Company in 1855, and in 1868 built the Falmouth Hotel, which was a center of the city's social activities for half a century.

Meiyappan and Jayanthilal Thakore agreeing to produce the Tamil version. T. P. Rajalakshmi was signed up to play Yeshoda, with C. V. V. Panthulu, as Nandagopan. T. S. Rajalakshmi portrayed the role of Radha. T. R. Mahalingam, who was then a stage actor made his acting debut with this film at the age of 14 portraying the character of Lord Krishna. T. R. Ramachandran, who went to become a famous comedian and music composer S. V. Venkataraman started their career with this film. Dhaibar and Meiyappan were disappointed with a song sung by the actress who portrayed Devaki's mother hence they both came up with an innovative idea to replace the soundtrack with another voice. Lalitha Venkatraman, prominent Carnatic vocalist in Mumbai was brought in to do the playback singing thus earned her the credit of being the first playback singer of Tamil cinema and also became the first Tamil film to introduce playback singing.

Subsequently, he became a lieutenant-colonel on 15April 1824 and a major and colonel on 9January 1838 Ellison's profuse growth of dark facial hair earned him the regimental sobriquet \\"Black Bob\\".

These are the Anangtal Baoli, the Gandhak Ki Baoli, and the Rajon Ki Baoli. These were built below the ground level as ground water edifices and in the context of Hinduism they were built as shrines in medieval times. Location The three baolis in Mehrauli are located in the South West district of Delhi. Two of the baolis, Gandhak ki Baoli and Rajon ki Baoli, lie in the Archaeological Park maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India near Qutab Minar. Gandhak ki Baoli (to the south of the Adham Khan's tomb) is at one extremity of the Archaeological Park. Rajon ki Baoli is away from this baoli. Anangtal Baoli is in a forest 100 meters (330 ft) west of the Yogmaya Mandir, behind a neighborhood and outside of the Archaeological Park complex. History The oldest of the three baolis, Anangtal Baoli, was built in the 11th century (1060 AD) by Rajput king Anangpal II of the Tomar dynasty in the then capital area of Lalkhot of Delhi. Gandhak ki Baoli is believed to have been built during the 13th century when the slave dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate Iltutmish (1211‚Äì1236 AD) ruled over Delhi. The Rajon ki Baoli is named after the rajmistries or masons who used it. It was built during the 16th century, by Daulat Khan during the rule of Sikander Lodhi of the Lodhi Dynasty. Features Anangtal Baoli on 8 December, 2018 =Anangtal Baoli= The Anangtal Baoli (28¬∞31'31.7\\"N 77¬∞10'53.8\\"E), the oldest baoli in Delhi, is a single stage step well. Excavations at this site reveal that the well was probably very large; some steps leading to the water are extant. It used the technique of rainwater harvesting for its storage. The baoli is located in a forest behind a neighborhood and is used as a local waste dump and pig farm, with sewage running into it. While it was supposed to be maintained by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), the Delhi High Court ordered that the Yogmaya Mandir Welfare and Management Society take over, since the DDA was failing in its duties. As of 8 December, 2018, the baoli is not maintained and does not have any markers signifying its historical relevance. =Gandhak ki Baoli= The Gandhak ki Baoli () is a much larger step well than the Anangtal Baoli. It has decorative architectural features. As the name Gandhak implies, the water in the step well has sulphur content and hence smells of sulphur fumes, and the water is said to have curative quality. It has a simple plan with five stages or floors at each stage, in taper down fashion, with steps leading to the water surface at the lowest level. The stairway here is about long and wide. On each floor there are ornate pillared passages. Over the centuries the step well got silted up and recently ASI imitated action to do desilting. the desilting operations carried out by ASI in 2004‚Äì05 has resulted in recuperation of the water in the well to a depth of . =Rajon ki Baoli= Rajon ki Baoli The Rajon ki Baoli (), rectangular in plan, is the largest and most ornamented of all the three baolis in Mehrauli. It has a series of steps forming four stages, each in descending size, with floors at each stage, leading to the water level from the surrounding ground level. Its appearance is like a courtyard of the medieval period with passages marked by stylized carved symmetrical arches spanning the columns in North Indian architectural style, which form the three sides of the baoli. There are rooms at each floor which once provided a cool resting place for people. With its incised plaster work, the baoli is an elegant architectural edifice. When built the water used to reach up to the third stage. Over the centuries the well got silted up. It has since been desilted. The Archaeological Survey of India has carried out desilting operations of the well which was silted to a depth of , during 2004‚Äì05. As a result, the water level has risen by 20 ft and 60 steps in the well lead to the surface of water.

This chemical, present at 20‚Äì40% of the fresh weight of the fruit bodies, inhibits the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. It is found in other mushrooms, but in much lower amounts. In animal studies, consumption of polyporic acid caused reduced locomotor activity, depressed visual placing response, hepatorenal failure, metabolic acidosis, hypokalaemia, and hypocalcaemia. Because these effects are similar to those observed in individuals poisoned by H. nidulans, polyporic acid is thought to be the primary toxin in H. nidulans. Polyporic acid has some antifungal and antibacterial activity. It has been shown to be an intermediate in the biosynthesis of allantofuranone, a gamma-lactone antibiotic from the fungus Allantophomopsis lycopodina.

It mainly consists of paintings, including 83 formerly in the Spanish royal collection, given to Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, who was Prime Minister as well as the general commanding the British forces to victory in the Napoleonic Wars. It also includes his collection of furniture, sculpture, porcelain, the silver centrepiece made for him in Portugal around 1815, and many other artworks and memorabilia relating to his career. Gerald Wellesley, 7th Duke of Wellington, gave the house and its most important contents to the nation in 1947, but the Wellington Museum Act that year established the family's right to occupy just over half the house \\"so long as there is a Duke of Wellington\\". The Wellington Collection, along with the house, is managed by English Heritage and is open to the public. List of paintings The Agony in the Garden, Antonio da Correggio, c. 1524 The Waterseller of Seville, Diego Vel√°zquez, 1618‚Äì1622 Two men sitting at the table, Diego Vel√°zquez, c. 1618 Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker statue of Napoleon by Antonio Canova The notable collection of over 200 paintings on display includes 83 paintings from the Spanish royal collection. At the Battle of Vitoria in northern Spain in 1813, the British army captured a carriage full of paintings from the Spanish royal collection.Apsley, 1; \\"Apsley House collection\\", English Heritage Joseph Bonaparte, whose brother Napoleon had made him King of Spain, had already lost Madrid, escaping with over 200 paintings in the carriage. Most had been removed from their frames and were rolled up in a large \\"imperial\\" or travelling-chest, along with state papers, love letters, and other documents. After a quick look, Wellington and his staff thought there was nothing very important or valuable in it, but sent the imperial by sea to his brother William, Lord Maryborough (as he then was) in London for a proper check. His brother called in William Seguier, later the first keeper of the National Gallery, who recognised the quality of the paintings and compiled a list of 165 of the most important.Kauffmann, 9-11 Wellington then informed the court of the restored Bourbon King Ferdinand VII of Spain of the incident, to make arrangements for their return, but the king said Wellington should keep them as a gift.Kauffmann, 11-12 The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck was also in the carriage, but (being conveniently small) appears to have been looted by the soldiers, and next appeared in London in 1816 in the possession of a Scottish colonel who had been at Vitoria.Campbell, Lorne, The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Paintings, 176, National Gallery, 1998, Not all the paintings acquired by the first Duke have been on public display.

She introduced the spinning jenny and the linen weaver profession in Finland, and had an unusual position for her gender at the time, being a woman sent on government support and power of attorney to in effect introduce a new profession. In response to a growing need of yarn, the Stockholm authorities founded spinning schools in 1739. Finland, at the time a Swedish Province, was deemed especially suitable for the cultivation of linen, and a decision was made to appoint a spinning teacher on state expense to introduce the profession in Finland. Elisabeth Forsell, at that time a weaver at the K√§ttsta factory in Haraker in V√§stmanland, was appointed to this position because she was deemed to be the perhaps best weaver in Sweden at that time. She was given a power of attorney to demand any assistance necessary from the Finnish authorities and a spinning jenny: this was not the English version, but a different model, constructed by Abraham Hedman of K√§ttsta. In Finland, she gave lessons in √Öbo 1739-40, and in Borg√• in 1740-1747. Her students were likely exclusively women, as the profession of weaver was at that time customarily regarded a woman's profession, and the majority of her students are described as maidservants, wives and daughters of craftsmen, though reportedly, some women from the upper classes were also interested to learn the technique. She was met by some resistance from the local authorities and governor, often motivated by the controversy of a young woman using a power of attorney to demand assistance from the authorities. She is last mentioned in 1747: after this year, her life is unknown, but she is believed to have returned to Sweden proper, and left her weaving school to her student Juliana Garberg.

The Wheel Spins (a.k.a. The Lady Vanishes) is a 1936 mystery novel by British writer Ethel Lina White.  Plot  Iris Carr, a young English society woman, is staying at a small hotel in ‚Äòa remote corner of Europe‚Äô. Her friends leave on the train to Trieste. Iris is glad to be alone, but then starts to miss them. The remaining guests are also glad to see them leave, due to their noisy ways and monopolising of the hotel facilities. After going for a long walk and getting lost in the local mountains, Iris decides to leave also, but waiting at the railway station, she is struck or hit on the back of the head and loses consciousness. She wakes up in the waiting room, but as she can‚Äôt speak the local language, no-one can tell her what happened. She concludes that it must have been sunstroke, but manages to get on the crowded train. She finds herself in a compartment with only one English speaker, Miss Winifred Froy. Miss Froy explains that she was a teacher of the children of a local aristocrat. His widow, the Baroness, is also a passenger in the compartment. Fellow hotel guests, the Reverend and Mrs Barnes and the Misses Flood-Porter are also aboard the train. She spies a heavily bandaged body in another compartment, supervised by a sinister-looking doctor apparently taking an accident victim to hospital in Trieste. Miss Froy confides that she has most recently been teacher to the children of the ‚ÄòLeader of the Opposition‚Äô, understood to be part of a nascent Communist faction. Iris and Miss Froy lunch in the restaurant car and on returning, Iris takes tablets for her headache. When she awakens, Miss Froy is not there. All her fellow passengers deny having seen Miss Froy. Iris eventually finds two Englishmen who speak the local language; Max Hare, a young engineer and his travelling companion, 'the Professor'. All the passengers still deny Miss Froy‚Äôs existence. A lady dressed identically to Miss Froy reappears, but it isn‚Äôt her ‚Äì it‚Äôs Frau Kummer. The Flood-Porters and the Barnes have their own reasons for wanting to get back to England without delay and continue to deny Miss Froy‚Äôs existence. The 'Todhunters', ostensibly honeymooners but actually an adulterous couple, remain in their private compartment and play no part in the events. Iris begins to believe that she has been hallucinating. The doctor convinces Max to surreptitiously administer a sleeping-draught to Iris; as it takes effect, she summons the strength to enter the next compartment and rip off the bandages from the 'victim'. It is indeed Miss Froy. Iris spends the rest of the journey through Italy and France in semi-consciousness. Only at Victoria station in London, does Max explain what happened. Miss Froy innocently witnessed something without realising its significance. The doctor and his assistants have been arrested, but he feels that the Baroness will use her influence to hush up the matter. Miss Froy returns home, having enjoyed her adventure, and Iris decides that she and Max will make his next trip ‚Äòtogether‚Äô.  Publishing  The novel was originally published in 1936 and is one of the few novels by White which are still in print today. It is available to read on Project Gutenberg Australia.  Adaptations  The book has been adapted for the screen several times. It has also been made into an audiobook. ;Films * The Lady Vanishes (1938 film), directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Margaret Lockwood, Michael Redgrave and Dame May Whitty. * The Lady Vanishes (1979 film), starring Cybill Shepherd, Angela Lansbury and Elliot Gould. * The Lady Vanishes (2013 film), starring Tuppence Middleton. ;Plays * The Lady Vanishes (2018 stage play) written by Derek Webb  References  Category:1936 British novels Category:British novels adapted into films Category:British crime novels Category:Collins Crime Club books ","title":"The Wheel Spins"},{"id":"48432442","text":"Anahit (, ) is a 1947 Soviet adventure film, directed by Hamo Beknazarian and starring Hrachia Nersisyan, Avet Avetisyan and O.

They ordered the patrons into one room and then shot at them, killing one. IPLO The IPLO began as a breakaway faction from the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), who they feuded with for much of 1986-87. The IPLO was a small but very violent Irish republican paramilitary organisation which was formed in 1986 by disaffected and expelled members of the INLA, whose factions coalesced in the aftermath of the supergrass trials. It developed a reputation for intra-republican and sectarian violence, and criminality. The shooting At around 13:15, somebody pressed the security buzzer on the Orange Cross Social Club's door to seek admission to the Club and a female employee at the club went to open the door. As the door opened, three gunmen from the IPLO entered and ordered the men in the room to stand at the bar. The lead gunman was carrying an UZI sub-machine gun, the second a Scorpion machine pistol & the third a 9mm pistol, they were wearing white boiler suits.Aaron Edwards - UVF: Behind The Mask p.189 They pretended it was a robbery at first to better ensure compliance, then one of the IPLO gunmen started firing indiscriminately at the customers with the Uzi sub-machine gun. Stephen McCrea, a Red Hand Commando member, was fatally wounded. The IPLO claimed McCrea was an informer working for the British security forces. One of his work-mates described the scene. \\"I stood in line whenever the first shot was fired and all of a sudden Stevie McCrea dived in front of me. The shots rang out and we all hit the floor. By this time the gunmen had run out of the room and we all stood up again. That is, except for two other men and Stevie McCrea. He had saved my life alright but lost his own in doing so‚Äô. But according to Jack Holland and Henry McDonald's book I.N.L.A - Deadly Divisions the IPLO missed an extraordinary chance to wipe out the whole Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) Belfast leadership (or most of it) which would have made the IPLO heroes with hardline Republicans and would have given them a respectable standing in the Nationalist community who turned a blind eye to Republican operations. While the shooting was going on downstairs in the bar The UVF Brigade Staff was holding a meeting upstairs when the IPLO unit burst in. It's believed the attack on the club was led and carried out by the IPLO's Belfast brigade commander Martin \\"Rook\\" O'Prey. O'Prey was later himself killed by the UVF in August 1991.Jim Cusack & Henry McDonald - UVF: The Endgame (Fully Revised & Updated) p.278https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/cgi- bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day;=16&month;=08&year;=1991 Aftermath The IPLO quickly claimed responsibility for the attack. The security forces had been fearing a republican backlash for the number of Catholic civilians killed in the previous weeks. The IPLO claimed it was a retaliation attack for two Catholic civilians and a Sinn F√©in councillor killed during the same week. Sinn F√©in president Gerry Adams called on those responsible for the shooting to \\"desist\\" and Kevin McQuillan of the IRSP, the INLA's political wing, also denounced the attack.http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi- bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day;=14&month;=02&year;=1989http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/chron/1989.html See also * Donegall Arms shooting * 1994 Shankill Road killings * Darkley killings * Rosnaree Hotel shooting Sources *Jack Holland, Henry McDonald, INLA ‚Äì Deadly Divisions' *CAIN project References External links *ITN news report of the Orange Cross Social Club shooting Category:1989 in Northern Ireland Category:The Troubles in Belfast Category:1989 murders in the United Kingdom Category:February 1989 events in the United Kingdom Category:Irish People's Liberation Organisation Category:20th century in Belfast Category:Terrorist incidents in the United Kingdom in 1989 ","title":"Orange Cross Social Club shooting"},{"id":"48432477","text":"Tayyab Tahir (born 26 July 1993) is a Pakistani first-class cricketer who plays for Lahore.

The initial thrust was given by the leaders of Congress and Khilafat movement. The main reason for the movement was high rent, which was generally higher than 50% of recorded rent in some areas. Oppression by thekedars who were entrusted to collect rent and practice of share rent also contributed to this movement. The Eka meetings were marked by a religious ritual in which a hole that represented River Ganga was dug in the ground and filled with water, a priest was brought in to preside and assembled peasants vowed that they would pay only recorded rent but pay it on time, would not leave when ejected, would refuse to do forced labour, would give no help to criminals and abide by the Panchayat decisions, they would not pay the revenue without receipt and would remain united under any circumstance. Small zamindars who were disenchanted with British Government due to heavy land revenue demand were also a part of this movement. Soon the leadership of Movement changed from Congress to Madari Pasi, a low caste leader who was not inclined to accept non-violence. This led the movement losing contact with nationalist class. Because in this the national leader was Mahatma Gandhi and his ideology was based on non violence. By March 1922, due to severe repression by authorities brought the Eka Movement to an end.

The building was designed by the prominent architecture firm, Emley and Williamson and completed in 1936. History The Suburb of Orange Grove sits in a historically important location on Louis Botha Avenue, or The Old Pretoria Road as it was once known. It was the site of a Boer War blockhouse that is said to have had uninterrupted views North, towards Pretoria. Before that, The Orange Grove Hotel had also been important, as Paul Kruger, the president of the Zuid Afrikaanse Republiek had met various delegations there. By the 1930s, Art Deco had become the most fashionable style of architecture in Johannesburg and a number of Art Deco buildings were erected in Orange Grove and neighbouring Houghton, including Houghton Heights and Roxdale Mansions. Architects Frank Emley was one of the preeminent architects in early Johannesburg. In partnership with William Leck he designed numerous important buildings in Johannesburg, including the Corner House Building (1903), and the Rand Club (1905). The partnership was also commissioned to design the homes of Sir Lionel Phillips, Judge Henry Hull and various other prominent members of early Johannesburg society. After the passing of Wiliam Leck, Emley won the competition for the new Central Block at the University of the Witwatersrand and brought on Frederick Williamson as a partner. Together they designed the main buildings at the University of the Witwatersrand campus (1920), and the Third Anstey's Building (1935). Lauriston Court was completed the year before The Third Anstey's Building, Emley and Williamson's Art Deco masterpiece. Features The building is completely symmetrical and in the Art Deco style. It features a characteristic tower of cantilever bay windows towards each of the two wings, reminiscent of the curved cantilever balconies of the German Expressionist architect, Erich Mendelsohn. The facade of the building is of painted plaster with horizontal bands stretching the full length of the building. The approach to the entrance is via a mosaic stairway with an aluminium rail down the middle. The entrance is through a double wooden doorway, leading into an opulent, split level foyer with an unusual curved ceiling and diagonal chessboard marble floor. There is now a Heritage Association blue plaque, with a synopsis of the building's history, at the front gate.

They enjoyed brief local and regional success with their first single, \\"I Need Love,\\" released in 1965, later recorded by the Time Stoppers. Though they failed to reach a wider audience, in the intervening years since their breakup they have become known amongst garage rock collectors and enthusiasts. Their 1966 song \\"I'll Come Running\\" has also become a song highly regarded amongst enthusiasts. The band formed in Annapolis, Maryland in 1964. Their original lineup consisted of Dave Vittek on lead vocals, Tom Curley on lead guitar and harmonica, Alan Fowler on bass, and Richard Kumer on drums. They had been playing in local clubs for almost a year when they were discovered by Barry Seidel, who became their manager and brought them in to be the first act signed by his production company Traydel Productions. Seidel and his business partner Tony Traynor took the band to the recording studio to cut their first single \\"I Need Love\\" b/w a rock version of \\"Blowin' in the Wind.\\" \\"I Need Love\\" was later recorded by the Time Stoppers. CD 5022 - CD liner notes Seidel and Traynor licensed the Mad Hatters' single to Ascot Records, a division of United Artists Records, who released it in the fall of 1965. \\"I Need Love\\" became a local hit in the Baltimore, Washington D.C. area and elsewhere, but it failed to break nationally. The Mad Hatters had recorded and a second single for Ascot, featuring two songs written by Tom Curley \\"This Is How It's Gonna Be\\" b/w \\"Go Find a Love,\\" but the label canceled the release after pressing promotional copies. The Mad Hatters signed with Fontana Records, who released their third single \\"I'll Come Running\\" b/w \\"Hello Girl\\" in late 1966. SC 11187 - CD liner notes The record failed to catch on commercially. The band recorded a pair of pair of folk rock songs under the name the Loved ones, but they were never released. In early 1967, lead vocalist Dave Vittek left the group. For a while the Mad Hatters continued with Bobby Howard on lead vocals, but band had lost momentum and by the end of the year they broke up for. Drummer Richard Kumer went on to play in another Washington, DC area band, the Fallen Angels. Songs such as \\"I Need Love\\" and \\"I'll Come Running\\" have become popular with garage rock collectors over the years, and the Mad Hatters' work has since been reissued on several compilation albums, such as Sundazed Records' Garage Beat '66 Volume 7: That's How It Will Be!, and their collected works are included on The Mad Hatters/Meet the Fallen Angels: Washington DC 1965-66 CD released in 2012 on Cicadelic Records.

Ecclesiastical career =Pastoral ministry= As a ministerial candidate of the United Basel Mission, Wilson pastored at the United Basel Mission Church in Mumbai from 1973-1974. During his overseas study, he was Youth Pastor at the Arcola Methodist Church, New Jersey. From 1978-1979, he was Honorary Associate Presbyter at CSI-St. Andrew's Church, Bangalore. Although Wilson belonged to the Basel Mission which had unionized itself into the Church of South India in 1968, he continued to be in the fold of the United Basel Mission. The ecclesiastical unification of the erstwhile Basel Mission did not go well with the congregations resulting in undecided allegiance, an act which resulted in chaos due to poor management.Godwin Shiri (Edited), Wholeness in Christ: The Legacy of the Basel Mission in India, KATHRI, Mangalore, 2009 (second impression). Wilson took some time to decide his allegiance and eventually came into the fold of the Church of South India resulting in his ordination on 19 November 1978Chan Jung Christian University at CSI-St. Paul‚Äôs Church, Mangalore by S. R. Furtado then Bishop - in - Karnataka Southern Diocese. =Teaching ministry= India After Wilson completed his doctoral studies, he returned to India and took up a teaching assignment at the United Theological College, Bangalore and taught from 1977 to 1988 serving under two Principals, J. R. Chandran and E. C. John. For a year (1989), he served as Ecumenical Relations Director he moved to the Church of South India Synod on the invitation of the Moderator, Victor Premasagar. Overseas From 1989 to 1998, Wilson was at Geneva serving as Executive Secretary, Department of Theology, World Alliance of Reformed Churches, Geneva. Again from 1998 to 2003, Wilson was Wilhelm Loehe Associate Professor of World Mission at the Wartburg Theological Seminary, Dubuque. From 2003 to 2006, Wilson was H. George Anderson Professor of Mission and Cultures at the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia. Contribution to theological education =India= During Wilson's stint at the BTESSC from 1980-1988, he ensured that budding theologians were recognised and sent for higher theological education, both locally and internationally to sustain its continuity in India. At the same time, research and publishing were carried on at BTESSC in a manner benefiting theological education.Monica J. Melanchthon, Graduate Biblical Studies in India in Elisabeth Sch√ºssler Fiorenza, Kent Harold Richards, Transforming Graduate Biblical Education: Ethos and Discipline, SBL, Atlanta, 2010, pp.119-120.

As consul general to Liberia, he was the first African-American to serve in the U.S. diplomatic corps. Early life Turner was born into slavery in St. Louis, Missouri. As a child, he was sold on the steps of the St. Louis US Courthouse for $50 (US$ in ). His enslaved father, John Turner, was a \\"horse doctor\\". Allowed to keep some of his earnings, he eventually purchased freedom for himself and his family. At fourteen, James Turner attended Oberlin College in Ohio for one term; following his father's death in 1855, Turner had to return to St. Louis to care for his family. Turner attended John Berry Meachum's Floating Freedom School on a steamboat on the Mississippi River, which Meachum had set up to evade the 1854 Missouri law against education of blacks. Career When the American Civil War broke out, Turner enlisted in the Union Army and served as body servant for Col. Madison Miller. He was wounded, resulting in a permanent limp. After the war, Miller's brother-in-law, Missouri Governor Thomas Fletcher, appointed him as assistant superintendent of schools. He was responsible for setting up schools for black Missourians. He helped establish the Lincoln Institute in Jefferson City, the first institution of higher education for African Americans in the state. The Institute's name was later changed to Lincoln University. As a politician, Turner, an outspoken member of the Radical Republicans and a leader of the Missouri Equal Rights League, was held in high regard for his oratorical skills. In 1868 he was installed as the principal of Lincoln School, the first school for blacks in Kansas City, Missouri. He was succeeded by J. Dallas Bowser.Coulter, Charles Edward. Take Up the Black Man's Burden: Kansas City's African American Communities, 1865-1939. University of Missouri Press, 2006. p23 In 1871, Turner was appointed as consul general to Liberia by Republican President Ulysses S. Grant. He relocated to Monrovia and held that post until 1878. During this time he was involved in settling the Grebo war.Turner, J. Milton When he returned to St. Louis, Turner played an important role in helping to resettle black refugees from former Confederate states in the South. He also worked to organize freedmen and people of color free before the Civil War as a political force; they overwhelmingly joined the Republican Party, considered the party of Abraham Lincoln. Turner also took part in relief efforts for African Americans who had left the South for Kansas as part of the Exoduster Movement of 1879. Many of these migrants settled in St. Louis. In 1881, Turner worked with Hannibal Carter to organize the Freedmen‚Äôs Oklahoma Immigration Association to promote black homesteading in Oklahoma. As chairman of the Negro National Republican Committee, he proposed nominating US Senator Blanche Bruce, another African American, as the vice presidential candidate on the Republican ticket in 1880. Turner worked during the last two decades of his life in fighting for the rights of Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw freedmen in the Indian Territory. After the war, the US government had made new treaties with these tribes, which had supported the Confederacy. They required the tribes to offer full citizenship to those freedmen who chose to stay in tribal territory, as the US had done for freedmen in the United States. He successfully lobbied Congress for the nearly 4,000 Cherokee Freedmen to receive $75,000 (US$ in ) from funds that the U.S. government had paid the tribe in 1888 for their land. The Cherokee originally did not want to divide the money for communal lands to include the freedmen. In late 1915 Turner was in Ardmore, Oklahoma, representing the freedmen in a legal dispute. When a nearby railroad car exploded, the debris cut his left hand. Blood poisoning developed in the wound, and Turner died November 1, 1915 in Ardmore. The Turner School in the Meacham Park area of Kirkwood, Missouri was named for Turner. The school opened in 1924 and was renamed after Turner in 1932; it closed during the 1975-1976 school year.

He enjoyed a European-wide reputation during his lifetime.Joseph Lies - Romantiek at tento Life Joseph Lies was born in a family of modest means. His father Hendrik worked as a blacksmith at their home in Antwerp. When his father died when Joseph was 13 years old, his mother Catharina-Jozefina van Grimberghen opened a hardware store to secure an income for the family. He did not attend school but studied at home with his brother and learned various foreign languages. From 1834 to 1842 he attended courses at the Antwerp Academy of Fine Arts. His first paintings, mainly history and genre scenes, date from his period. One of his teachers at the Academy was Nicaise de Keyser, a key figure in the Belgian Romantic-historical school of painting.Max Rooses, 'Joseph Lies' in: Max Rooses, 'Oude en Nieuwe Kunst', Boekhandel J. Vuylsteke, Ghent, 1896, p. 47-48, 129-139 A contrast At the age of 20 Lies was drafted into the Belgian army. He served in a regiment in Li√®ge where the officer in charge allowed him to devote most of his time to painting and required him to give art classes to the officer's daughter. After completion of his military service and his return to Antwerp in February 1843 Lies picked up his painting career. His most important works were created in the second half of the 1850s. The Antwerp city council commissioned in 1859 his largest painting entitled Baldwin VII, Count of Flanders. Gradually Lies started receiving official recognition for his work. In 1851 he was awarded the gold medal at the exhibition in Brussels for his Interrogation of Joan of Arc. In 1853 he again obtained the gold medal in Brussels.Joseph Hendrik Hubert Lies (Antwerp 1821‚Äì1865), Idyll in the Park at Dorotheum In 1858 he was made a knight of the Order of Leopold. When in 1849 the Vereniging van Antwerpse kunstenaars (the 'Association of Antwerp artists') was established, he was elected its secretary. Upon the merger in 1852 of this association with the newly formed Kunstverbond or Cercle Artistique, Lit√©raire et Scientifique d‚ÄôAnvers ('Art Association'), Lies retained the post of secretary of the department of visual arts, a position he held until 1861. The Kunstverbond championed changes to the organisation of the Antwerp Academy and Lies was the author of a plan that called for the separation of the artistic and administrative functions in the Academy.Jan Lampo, De eerste burgerlijke uitvaart in Antwerpen, Schilder Lies reist naar het Eeuwige Oosten, in: EOS - Memo, 15-03-2014 In 1859 Lies showed the first serious signs of tuberculosis. He complied with his doctor's advice to take a journey to the south and left on 21 October 1859 for Italy. He travelled south through Switzerland, France and Italy. In Italy he visited Florence and Venice where he was evidently influenced by the Italian masters. He stayed in Italy until June 1860. Upon his return to his hometown he continued to paint and created some of his most successful pieces. He also became a teacher at the Antwerp Academy. He was, however, not fully cured from his illness to which he eventually succumbed on 5 January 1865 in Antwerp. He was in Antwerp one of the first who chose to have a civil (i.e. non-religious) burial as he was a freemason and an atheist. Jaak de Braekeleer chiseled a mausoleum for his friend at the cemetery of Stuivenberg, and this was later transferred to the cemetery of Kiel. Work Maria Leys, daughter of Henri Leys Lies kept a record of all the paintings that he sold. It shows that he sold 120 paintings, although his actual production was likely higher. The initial work of Lies was influenced by the Romantic movement as represented by Nicaise de Keyser. He later came under the influence of his friend Henri Leys, a leading representative of the historical or Romantic school and a pioneer of the Realist movement in Belgium. Leys had distanced himself from the pathos and historical anecdotes of the Romantic school and the Rubens' influenced style of de Keyser. Instead, Leys had begun painting scenes set in 16th-century Antwerp, combining details studied from life with a deliberately archaising style reminiscent of 15th and 16th-century Flemish and German painting.Jean F. Buyck, Henri Leys - Lucie Leys, dochter van de schilder in OKV 1966 These innovations by Leys in style and subject matter left a deep mark on Lies' work. Landscape In the mid 1840s Lies painted in the various genres and subjects then popular with the public: love scenes, scenes from the lives of famous painters, views of old abodes and rooms with collectors of antique objects. From 1848-1849 his works started to focus more on history subjects. His paintings carried titles such as Erasmus writing The Praise of Folly, Albrecht D√ºrer descends the Rhine, etc. This shift to more serious history subjects may have reflected the influence of Leys but could also have been a reaction to political developments in Belgium. As an atheist and critic of the Catholic Church, Lies was sympathetic to Albrecht D√ºrer who was a Lutheran and to Erasmus who was critical of the Catholic Church. Landscape became more important as the principal subject or background of his paintings and took gradually on a more realistic aspect. The landscapes in his compositions made after 1858 show in the distance villages, roads and fields, which bring to mind the later works of Leys. Lies included a view of an entire village in his The enemy approaches (1857, Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp). He excelled in the rendering of the play of colour and light in his views of forests and fields. His landscapes had an influence on the work of Jean Pierre Fran√ßois Lamorini√®re who was seven years his junior.Max Rooses, 'De schilderkunst van 1400 tot 1800; De schilderkunst der XIXde Eeuw', Amsterdam, 1908 and 1910 Lies was a gifted portrait painter as shown by his two portraits of the wife and daughter of his friend Leys. In particular the portrait of the young daughter of Leys stands out in its simplicity and brings to mind the children's portraits of the 17th-century Flemish artists Cornelis de Vos and Pieter van Lint.

During the war he led an influential committee on economic warfare. Early years Jean-Baptiste Morel was born on 10 October 1854 in Nandax, Loire. He attended the Ecole sup√©rieure de pharmacie de Paris (Pharmacy School of Paris) where he won various prizes and medals. He was elected local councilor on 28 July 1889, then Mayor of Charlieu in May 1896. He became a councilor-general of the Loire department on 9 December 1894, and later became president of the council. National politics On 8 May 1898 Morel ran for election as deputy for the Roanne constituency, and won in the first round. He was reelected in the second round of the April‚ÄìMay 1902 elections. He ran for election to the Senate on 7 January 1906, but was not elected. He was reelected deputy on 10 May 1906. In 1906 Morel was secretary of a Customs Commission to examine tariff needs in a changing industrial landscape. The committee issued a protectionist report, but the recommendations were blocked by supporters of firms that exported luxury goods. Morel was appointed Minister of the Colonies on 3 November 1910 in the cabinet of Aristide Briand, holding office until the cabinet fell on 2 March 1911. He again ran for election to the Senate of 7 January 1912, and this time succeeded. He was again appointed Minister for the Colonies on 21 January 1913 in the cabinet of Aristide Briand, and retained that position in the succeeding cabinet of Louis Barthou, holding office until 9 December 1913. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) the Bureau d'√©tudes √©conomiques (Office of Economic Studies) was set up in July 1915 under Morel's leadership. The bureau contained permanent officials and parliamentarians, and was a \\"laboratory of ideas\\" for conducting economic warfare against Germany both before and after the military conflict. It also coordinated between the government and the parliamentary committees. It was highly influential in 1915‚Äì16, less so after the Ministry of Commerce took charge of planning for the post-war economy. Morel's committee was to define France's financial demands at the Versailles Conference. In 1917 a Comit√© d'√âtudes was established to prepare for material on national borders for the post-war Peace Conference, and in December 1918 Andr√© Tardieu began to coordinate its work with Morel's economic committee, but he had achieved little when the peace conference began. Morel was reelected to the Senate on 11 January 1920 and on 6 January 1924. He sat with the Radical Democrats and Radical Socialists. He died from a paralytic stroke on 7 February 1927 in Paris, at the age of 72. Legacy There is a rue Jean Morel in the towns of Regny, Charlieu, Annay and Coudekerque-Branche.

Most commonly, Honda CT90 trail bikes were converted, although several other motorbikes models were as well. Design An airline captain for United Airlines, Lawrence ‚ÄúLarry‚Äù S. Shapiro, recognized the need for small, lightweight, transportation. Using a stock Honda Trail 90, he began work on modifying it so that it could be disassembled or collapsed down to a small size that could fit in most aircraft luggage compartments. The ability to do this without requiring tools was seen as a must. The final version had 90 custom parts. The design was awarded a United States Patent, #3,872,944, in 1975. At peak manufacturing, Suitcase Cycle production models included the Suzuki 100cc, 125cc and the freeway legal 185cc model. Honda models included the CT90, CL100, and SL125 models, another an instance of a converted Honda 175cc model, and a Yamaha 360cc has been reported. The company also sold storage and safety accessories, like hard sided luggage, vinyl soft cases, and helmets. Production & Marketing Suitcase Cycle started in the garage at Shapiro family home in Westchester, California, in the late 1960s. Shortly thereafter, production was expanded and moved to the Santa Monica Airport, where a dozen employees - including Shapiro's family - worked. The Suitcase Cycle appeared in several feature articles in aviation magazine during its production run, as well as advertisements. Over 1,000 Suitcase Cycles were completed when the production came to a sudden halt in 1974. End of Production A shift in product liability laws compelled Shapiro to shutter the production line in 1974. Several of dealers that Suitcase Cycle got their motorbikes from were instructed to no longer sell to Suitcase Cycle bikes for conversion. Larry Shapiro retired from United Airlines, and died in 2001. Today, factory-built Suitcase Cycles, with complete badging and documentation, command premium prices among GA pilots and Honda collectors alike.

Saman Deviyo Considered as one of the guardian gods of Sri Lanka, Deity Saman is deeply venerated in the region of Rathnapura and related areas in the province of Sabaragamuwa of Sri Lanka, he is recorded to have been a district administrator of the region contemporary to Lord Buddha who he met on the former's visit to Sri Lanka. According to the Mahavamsa the chronicle of ancient Sri Lanka, it is mentioned that the Administrator Saman, attained the first level of enlightenment Sotapanna at the end of the sermon of Lord Buddha. After the demise of Saman, the administrator of Deva Clan he has started to be venerated as a God or a deity. The Shrine It is believed after the demise of Saman, his clan of Deva started to venerate him by erecting a shrine for him. And it's believed there had been a Temple called Saparagama Viharaya, in the same premises in the Anuradhapura era of Sri Lanka, as it's mentioned in Mahavamsa that monks from the said temple attended to the opening ceremony of Ruwanwelisaya of King Dutugamunu.

Anyway, the present shrine is said to have built by a court minister in Dambadeniya era of Sri Lanka named Aryakamadeva, in the patronage of King Parakramabahu II, in 1270 AD, as a fulfillment of his vow to erect a shrine in the name of deity Saman, if his effort to find gems is successful.

It is located 30 km from Tirunelveli. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple has three precincts. Shiva is worshipped as Kailasanathar and his consort Parvati as Sivakami. The temple is the sixth temple in the series of Nava Kailasams where the presiding deity of all the nine temples is Kailasanathar and associated with a planetary deity. The temple is associated with the planet Saturn. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple has a flat gateway tower, unlike other South Indian temples that have a pyramidal entrance tower. The temple was originally built by Chandrakula Pandya Vijayanagar and Nayak kings commissioned pillared halls and major shrines of the temple during the 16th century. The temple has artistic sculptures representative of Nayak art. The temple is open from 6 am - 12 pm and 4-7 pm on all days except during festival days when it is open all day. Four daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Brahmotsavam festival during the Tamil months of Chittirai (April - May) and Aippasi (October - November) being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend and religious significance The Santhana sababathy hall where image of Nataraja is housed As per legend, sage Urosamar floated a set of flowers in Tamiraparani River and the sixth flower reached the shore at this place. The sage established a temple for Kailasanathar. The lingam, the aniconic form of Shiva in the temple, is believed to an aspect of Shani, one of the planetary deities. The flagstaff of the temple is believed to have been brought from Devi Kanya Kumari in Kanniyakumari. The Nataraja in this temple is called Santhana Sababathi (anointed with sandal). Nine temples, including this one, on the banks of Tamiraparani river are classified as Nava Kailasam; the presiding deity of each is Kailasanathar and each temple is associated with one of the nine planetary deities (Navagraha). The temple is associated with the planet Shani (Saturn) and considered sixth in the nine temples. Kumaraguruparar, a saint of the 18th century, was born at this place. Architecture The precinct around the entrance The image of Kailasanathar (Shiva) in the form of Lingam is housed in the sanctum. The shrine of his consort Sivakami (Parvati) is housed in a west-facing shrine. The temple also houses the images of Vinayaka, Subramanya, Veerabhadra, Rishabhandika, and Nataraja on the walls. Two sculptures - Veerabadra and a warrior in the flagstaff hall - are noteworthy. The west-facing shrine adjacent to the flagstaff has a hall with yali pillars, where Nataraja is housed. The temple has sculptural representation of sage Romasa, Agnipathar and Veerabadrar on the pillars in the temple dating back to the Nayak Empire. The shrine of the guardian deity Bhoothanathar, housing his wooden image, is an important shrine in the temple. He is given the primary role during the Chittirai Brahmotsavam festival. It is believed that during historic times, the temple staff used to surrender the keys of the temple to its protector Bhoothanathar. The image of the Nataraja is always covered with Sandal paste and hence called Rathnasabapathy. History The temple is believed to be originally built by the Pandya king, Chandrakula Pandya, who ruled over the region of Madurai. He built the central shrine and vimana of the temple. Veerappa Nayaka (1609-23 AD), a ruler of Madurai Nayak dynasty built the Yagasala, dwajasthamba (flagstaff) and Sandana Sababathy hall. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. The temple is the place where Kumaragurupara Desikar, a saint from the 17th century. Festival The temple follows Shaivite tradition. As at other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, Shaivite Brahmin temple priests, perform the temple rituals. The rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasanthi at 8:30 a.m., Uchikalam at 11:30 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., and Aravanai Pooja between 8:00 \\\\- 8:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), naivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Kailasanathar and Sivakami. During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 6 am - 12 pm and 4-8:30 pm generally except during new moon days when it is open all day. The Brahmotsavam festival celebrated during the Tamil months of Chittirai (April - May) and Aippasi (October - November) are the most prominent festivals of the temple.

History and classification Tityus apozonalli was described from a solitary fossil, which is preserved as an inclusion in a transparent chunk of Mexican amber. At the time of description, the amber specimen was housed in the fossil collection of the Museo del √Åmbar de Chiapas in San Crist√≥bal de las Casas, Simojovel. The holotype fossil is composed of a very complete adult male recovered from the Guadalupe Victoria site. Mexican amber is recovered from fossil bearing rocks in the Simojovel region of Chiapas, Mexico. The amber dates from between 23 million years old at the oldest and 15 million years at the youngest. The Guadalupe Victoria site is an outcrop of amber bearing strata belonging to the Mazantic Shale and Balumtum Sandstone. The deposits preserve a transitional river or stream environments near the coast and preserves fossils of a mangrove forest ecosystem. The holotype was first studied by a team of researchers headed by Francisco Riquelme of the Universidad Aut√≥noma del Estado de Morelos with their 2015 type description of the species being published in the natural sciences journal PLoS ONE. The specific epithet apozonalli was derived from the N√°huatl word \\"apozonalli\\", coined by the Aztecs for amber, and translating as sea bubble or foam. T. apozonalli is one of two Tityus species described from Mexican amber, the other being Tityus knodeli. Three other species have been described from the similarly aged Dominican amber Tityus azari, Tityus geratus and Tityus hartkorni. Description The T. apozonalli is a reddish-brown in overall coloration with the manus pedipalps, and legs a pale yellowish tone. The total body length is and a metasoma. There are several eyes on the ocular node, with two smaller ocelli placed to the sides of the median node. On the chelicerae there are rows of dentition which line up on each side of the jaws and scattered macrosetae on the lower back edges. The enlarged pedipalps have raised ridges along the femur, patella, and the chelae. There are trichobothria present but the exact configuration is hard to determine due to the preservation. Both the fixed and mobile sides of the chela have rows of teeth with a slightly darkened coloration. The underside of the mesosoma clearly shows the paired pecten combs each with twenty-nine teeth. At the rear of the mesosoma the male genitalia are only faintly visible in the subtriangular genital operculum. The telson has both a large Aculeus and a smaller subaculear tubercle.

Located on the outskirts of Doha, it is designed to hold 68,640 people. Qatar, responding to intense international criticism over mistreatment of migrant workers constructing facilities for the upcoming 2022 FIFA World Cup, built the camp for an estimated ‚Ç¨750 million. It includes multiple facilities, namely a 17,000-seat theatre, commercial centres, markets, four cinemas, a cricket field, two police stations, two mosques and a medical centre. There is a very high degree of surveillance and security, which both benefits the workers yet undermines their private lives. Despite the accommodation and amenities it brings, Labour City has been criticised to be part of a broader urban planning strategy to segregate Qatar's low-income workforce from the general population and away from established residential areas in a forced- gentrification fashion.

It contains a reasoned illustration of science as a social process with all the failing and imperfections of human endeavors. Content 'It is impossible to understand the social and ethical problems confronting science without recognizing the falsity of the assumption, crucial to traditional theories of science, that the results of scientific research must be essentially good and true. Dr. Ravetz demonstrates the role of choice and value-judgment, and the inevitability of error, in scientific research'.(from Oxford University Press back matter entry for this volume) Important aspects of the book are the social construction of facts, science as a craft with essential tacit elements, the role of choice and value judgment, and the inevitability of error. The book argues that the internal quality control system of industrialized science will suffer severe problems: \\"The problem of quality control in science is thus at the centre of the social problems of the industrialized science of the present period.\\" Moore (1973) summarizes the main claims of Ravetz's work are as follows: \\"First, historically the social character of science has undergone tremendous changes. Secondly, the traditional philosophies of science which conceive of science as an activity in the pursuit of truth are obsolete. And thirdly, it is imperative to develop a new philosophy of science which accounts for the social nature of contemporary science.\\"Moore, J.H., 1973, Review of ‚ÄòScientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems by Jerome R. Ravetz‚Äô, Philosophy of Science, Vol. 40, No. 3 (Sep., 1973), pp. 455-457. Ravetz analyzes the transition from basic science to 'industrialized science', with particular attention of issues of degeneration (shoddy science). He also focuses on entrepreneurial science, where a scientist becomes more concerned with research grants and power than with the quality of his scientific research. The need for 'good morale', i.e. for an ethos of science upheld by a community of peers is mentioned in relation to the danger that such an ethos may not survive 'industrialized science'. For Gowing (1974) the main difficulty of this work is the confusion among the different kinds of science addressed by the inquiry: 'natural sciences, pure and applied', versus 'any sort of disciplined inquiry', up to include 'social sciences'.Gowing, M., 1974, Review of ‚ÄòScientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems by Jerome R. Ravetz‚Äô, The British Journal for the History of Science, Vol. 7, No. 1 (Mar., 1974), pp. 72-75. Reviews For Higgins \\"Ravetz best sections deal with science as a craft ... but a craft nonetheless. This science-as-craft cannot be taught independent of its ideology. One learns a craft at a master's knee, as one learns style. What this really means is that students must learn to make judgments about their actions; also about their behaviors, their science, their data.\\"See A.C. Higgins, Science Fraud Database, at For Rothman (1974) Ravetz elucidates \\"the processes by which genuine and meaningful scientific knowledge accumulates. These chapters ‚Äì nine in all ‚Äì from the most interesting and useful part of the book.

They develop \\"innovative strategies\\" to move pharmaceutical products from \\"pipeline to endgame.\\" Philidor is part of a network of companies, including BQ6 Media Group LLC and Isolani LLC. Philidor RX Services created Isolani LLC. The name Philidor refers to an 18th-century French Chess master Francois-Andre Philidor and the Philidor position, an important chess Chess endgame; isolani refers to an isolated pawn. BQ6 Media is named after the chess shorthand for Bobby Fisher's legendary move against Russian chess master Boris Spassky in 1972. The Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation (SIRF) report alleges that several states list Matthew Davenport, David Wing, John Carne and Gregory Blaszcynski as officers of BQ6 Media and another company, End Game Partnership LLP (chess reference), as assistant treasurer. The SIRF report pointed to another reference to a popular chess move called the King's Gambit Accepted (KGA) that is also the name of Valeant's wholly owned unit ‚Äî KGA Fulfillment Services Inc., formed in Delaware in November 2014. History Philidor Rx Services was formed in 2013 by Matthew S. Davenport and Andrew (Andy) Davenport as an online pharmacy in Delaware with an office in Horsham, Pennsylvania and in Hatboro, a town of about 7,360 in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. California is the \\"largest market for medicines\\" in the US and Philidor and Valeant faced \\"hurdles in getting prescriptions filled there. In August 2013 Philidor had requested an application for a California Non-Residency Pharmacy Permit but it was denied in May 2014 by State Attorney General Kamala Harris staff because Philidor allegedly falsified information on its application, claiming that Matthew Davenport was registered as Philidor's principal when Andrew (Andrew) Davenport was the principal and did not disclose that Andrew owned 27% of Philidor. There were other \\"false statement of facts\\" on the application and Philidor was accused of unprofessional conduct. On December 1, 2014 64-year- old pharmacist Russell Reitz sold his small three-year-old specialty pharmacy prescription-filling mail-order business ‚Äî R&O; Pharmacy ‚Äî in Camarillo, in suburban Los Angeles for $350,000 to Isolani LLC. Reitz stayed on as manager. Prior to the acquisition by Isolani, R&O; Pharmacy had dispensed a modest number of prescription medications to patients and collected reimbursements from insurance companies. With the new owners, Isolani and Philidor, Reitz' store's name R&O; Pharmacy, and his National Council for Prescription Drug Programs identification number were used to fill prescriptions nationwide at other pharmacies which amounted to $230 million a year. Reitz became concerned and in July he sent emails to Andy Davenport CEO of Philidor and Eric Rice of Isolani. In the emails Reitz, claimed that his personal \\"ID was used to bill for prescriptions\\" that were \\"filled by some other pharmacy (in some cases for drugs that R&O; did not even stock)\\" or \\"filled and billed\\" before the R&O; purchase agreement was finalized. Another pharmacy in the Philidor network is West Wilshire Pharmacy in Los Angeles. According to a Wall Street Journal article in October 2015, \\"Valeant employees were placed at Philidor while the pharmacy was in its infancy\\" to provide help on \\"structures and processes.\\" In 2014, Philidor created 250 new jobs. In an October 26, 2015 conference call Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson said, Valeant had paid $100 million in late 2014 for an option to buy Philidor for nothing over the next 10 years. In turn Philidor \\"has an option to buy a Delaware entity called Isolani LLC, which has an agreement to buy\\" Camarillo, California-based specialty pharmacy R&O; Pharmacy. Specialty pharmacies Most of the prescriptions filled by Philidor were for Valeant's expensive drugs like Solodyn, an oral antibiotic approved to treat moderate to severe acne and Jublia, a treatment for onychomycosis of the toenails. They also filled Retin-A Micro Tretinoin prescriptions. Jublia, which received FDA approval in July 2014 and Retin-A Micro, which received FDA approval in January 2014, were two products among others that Valeant acquired with the purchase of Dow Pharmaceuticals in 2008. By October 2015, a \\"bottle of 30 of Solodyn tablets can cost up to $1,040.41\\" and an \\"8-milliliter bottle of Jublia costs $1,075.72\\" according to \\"Truven Health Analytics, which publishes average wholesale prices.\\" According to ProPublica, According to Reuters, \\"Specialty pharmacies are designed to handle medicines that require complex storage or administration, often for serious conditions such as cancer or rheumatoid arthritis. Valeant has used Philidor to dispense a range of its medications, including conventional treatments for acne and toenail fungus.\\" Valeant and Philidor Tactics used by Philidor Rx Services were challenged in a 2015 investigation of Philidor's partner company, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. During the October investigations Valeant disclosed that it has an option to buy Philidor RX Services. Valeant's stocks have decreased in value as a result of these allegations. According to \\"former employees and an internal document\\", Philidor who filled Valeant's prescriptions \\"altered doctors‚Äô orders to wring more reimbursements out of insurers.\\" Valeant employees who worked at Philidor in the early months of Philidor's operations, \\"set up separate Philidor email accounts, under \\"clearly distinguishable names,\\" to keep ‚Äútheir internal Philidor communications separate from the Valeant communications, primarily to reduce the risk of incorrectly sharing either company‚Äôs proprietary information.\\" One alleged practice entailed Valeant employees directly managing Philidor's business operations while posing as Philidor employees and with all written communication under fictitious names. For example, Bijal Patel, a manager of access solutions at Valeant in Scottsdale, Arizona used the email name of Peter Parker, the alter ego of Spider-Man at Philidor where he tracked prescriptions. In October 2015, major pharmacy benefit management (PBM) organizations ‚Äî such as Express Scripts ‚Äî the largest PBM organization in the United States ‚Äî began reviewing pharmacy programs run by AbbVie Inc and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd regarding the potential use of tactics employed by Philidor that \\"can allow drugmakers to work around reimbursement restrictions\\" from Express Scripts and other insurers. Insurers like Express Scripts direct \\"patients to cheaper generic versions of widely-used medicines to save costs.\\" A major allegation is that, by controlling the pharmacy services offered by Philidor, Valeant steered Philidor's customers to expensive drugs sold by Valeant. On October 22, Alex Arfaei, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets ‚Äî who has promoted Valeant's stock purchase since 2013 ‚Äî questioned Valeant's close ties to specialty pharmacies that distribute its drugs arguing that Valeant's arrangements with the specialty was \\"not just aggressive, but questionable\\" and that BMO \\"cannot defend the specialty pharmacy structure.\\" Valeant responded that Citron Research group accusations that Valeant was the 'Pharmaceutical Enron' were \\"erroneous.\\" On October 30, Valeant cut ties with Philidor.

Neill's A Dominie's Log is a diary of his first year as headteacher at Gretna Green Village School, during 1914-15. It is an autobiographical novel.Croall, Jonathan (1983b). Neill of Summerhill: The Permanent Rebel. New York: Pantheon Books. . He changed a hard working, academic school controlled by corporal punishment and the fear of the authority of the teacher into one of happiness, play and children controlling their learning.Neill, A. S., A Dominie's Log, Herbert Jenkins Limited, London, 1915 He was a reflective teacher, sitting on his desk thinking out why he and the children were at the school. He also, most importantly, thought the children were human beings, and engaged with them as such, joining in their games, sliding with them on an ice slide in the street, sharing their sweets, laughing with them, and appreciating and respecting their individuality, and creativity.  Celebrating the practising teacher  Most images of teachers are about the individual as hero overcoming the problems of school and parents and leading the children to enlightenment. Like the heroes of fairy tales they do not challenge or change the system, they are simply heroes of the system,Zipes, Jack, Breaking the Magic Spell: Radical Theories of Folk and Fairy Tales, The University Press of Kentucky; 2nd Revised edition, 1 Jul 2002, if only all teachers were like them. To Neill the children, and their school and local community, are the heroes, they are the ones that he sees as helping the child to be happy, healthy and free. In the first review it states that he has opinions on everything, but that was to miss the point, that the issues of the school and its children impinge on political and cultural life, they are not separate. Neill is thinking of the culture of childhood and schooling, not of the school as a place for effective, efficient methods and positive measurable outcomes. The story is about him trying to 'create an attitude'. Indeed, after ten years of teaching, in 1921 he creates a school, a community, that is the hero, Summerhill School. Its formation is portrayed in A Dominie Abroad, and the Children's BBC producer, Jon East, uses it to get audiences to question what a school is in his drama about the school and its fight with Ofsted inspectors, Summerhill. \\"An awful lot of drama is set in schools - and yet each series only reinforces the dominant paradigm,\\" Jon East says. \\"What we're trying to say in this drama is that there could just be another way of doing things.\\"Rampton, James, Summerhill: The school where lessons are optional', The Telegraph, 19 Jan 2008 Neill reads the war news everyday to discuss with the children. He uses Ibsen's play An Enemy of the People, replacing that day's bible lesson, to question the justice of democracy when the mob rules. This book, the way it is written, the way he thinks through issues, the way it ends, can be seen as representing all those teachers who at that time helped create the community known as New Ideals in Education Conferences. They believed in the foundation value for all schools and children's communities, of 'liberating the child from the authority of the teacher'.  Basing schools on children's rights  It was recognised by the New Ideal's teachers, professors, soldiers, politicians, headteachers, artists, musicians, actors... that the liberty of the child, the autonomy of the learner, their creativity, self-expression, their search for knowledge and learning was the hope for a world of justice and peace. \\"In the first place, this amazing Conference at which we have seen sitting side by side Government Officials, advanced Montessorians, antediluvian Teachers like myself, University Professors, Soldiers in khaki, Musicians, Artists, Headmasters of Public Schools, the superintendent of the Little Commonwealth, Primary Schoolteachers, and the American Ambassador himself stands, first and foremost, for Freedom, - I do not like \\"emancipation\\", for the word suggests slavery, and the use of it probably promotes it. We have all agreed that the child is to be free: yes, but the teacher must be free as well as the child‚Ä¶\\"‚ÄîMr Lionel Helbert, Headmaster of West Downs, Winchester, 1915.New Ideals Committee, Report of the Conference on New Ideals in Education August 14‚Äì21, 1915, p122, Women's Print Society, 1915 Neill in A Dominie's Log writes about the children's ice slide being salted by the policeman to protect the property of the farmers, their horses. He reflects with the children that they have no voice because they have no vote, he compares them to women, and women's low pay and menial jobs. He suggests they write a charter of children's rights. As through the whole book he does not do what teachers so often do now, turn things into projects, getting the kids to role play a campaign or draw cartoons of their plans for play in the town and its streets, but to look at the issue in terms of power, and how to get equality!  Need for a culture and shared history of children's rights  For all rights movements to succeed they build on their history, on changes their struggles have caused, and just as importantly on the culture of struggle they have created. This empowers them to feel a part of a movement, a successful, heroic struggle, with numerous examples of small successes that help to build the momentum for sustained change in laws and attitudes. Children and teachers need to feel they are a part of an historical struggle for the rights of the child. A Dominie's Log is one personal story of a headteacher, it is representative of a whole movement, New Ideals, and it is vital that we celebrate and share this history, so that it effects the present. Evidence has been submitted to the Select Committee on Education for their meeting with the Children's Commissioner, Anne Longfield OBE, to discuss her new report 'Ambitious for Children' (August 2015). It is trying to input into the discussion of the voice of the child, and their future society and culture, the importance of this history.

It reminds us of the concept of the good primary school being child-centred, based on creative learning, play, learning by doing, group work, learning from the natural world, making decisions and taking responsibility for their learning and their community. We must claim these back as the foundations of our schools.

The station is part of the Initial Construction Segment.  History  The initial 2005 Environmental Impact Report for the system considered two general alignments for the Fresno to Bakersfield segment: one following the BNSF Railway right-of-way down the center of the Central Valley, and another following the Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way farther to the east. The BNSF alignment was chosen because it avoided urban areas, making it less expensive and having fewer constructibility concerns. The preferred Bakersfield station option co-located it with the existing Bakersfield station at Truxtun Avenue due to its central location and connectivity with existing transportation. The city of Bakersfield had endorsed the Truxtun Avenue station location in 2003, but reversed its position in 2011 to oppose the High-Speed Rail project due to concerns on the impact to new facilities and revitalization to the downtown area that had occurred in the interim. The Environmental Impact Report for the Fresno to Bakersfield segment was approved in May 2014 by the California High-Speed Rail Authority, preserving the BNSF Railway alignment and Truxtun Avenue station location. Construction of this alignment would have impacted 526 structures, including 231 residences. The City of Bakersfield filed a lawsuit in June 2014 opposing this alignment. The lawsuit was settled in December 2014 with an agreement to instead adopt a \\"locally generated alignment\\" that uses the alignment of the slightly-farther- north Union Pacific Railroad, stopping at a new station near the intersection of F Street and Golden State Avenue. The new alignment is shorter, and its construction would be much less disruptive, impacting only 150 buildings, almost all of which are non-residential. This change, along with an ongoing lawsuit with the nearby city of Shafter, California, caused the southernmost of the Initial Construction Segment to be delayed and not included as part of the first package of construction bids. A station planning agreement with the city was announced on September 15, 2015. In February 2016, the California High-Speed Rail Authority's draft business plan stated that the funding on hand would only allow construction of the segment from San Jose to just northwest of Shafter, raising the possibility that a temporary station might be built near Shafter, 23 miles north of Bakersfield, if additional funds could not be obtained. The April 2016 revisions to the plan cut back the initial construction segment to Wasco, 30 miles north of Bakersfield, given its better connectivity to existing transportation. In March 2019, the Kern County Board of Supervisors approved a proposal calling for the \\"immediate abandonment of the high-speed rail project\\" and any surplus state funds to be redistributed to community programs among the Central Valley. As of December 2019, an elevated station design was being planned for the Bakersfield station.

It would be located near the intersection of Hanford Expressway and Central Valley Highway, just east of the city limits of Hanford and less than west of the larger city of Visalia. The construction of the station has been controversial, with Tulare County supporting the station while Kings County, where the station would be located, has strongly opposed the entire California High-Speed Rail project. History = Planning = The current Amtrak San Joaquin service in the Central Valley uses the BNSF Railway tracks through the center of Hanford, stopping at an existing station there. However, a high-speed rail route along this alignment was strongly opposed by Hanford city officials, who said that it would disrupt the city's historic downtown. This meant that only routes that bypassed Hanford city limits were considered. An alignment along Route 99 was ruled out due to the extra expense and uncertain cooperation from Union Pacific Railroad, which has its own track in the vicinity. This left routes through rural areas, which ran into opposition from farmers whose land would be taken. In October 2011 the Kings County Board of Supervisors voted to oppose all possible alignments through that county. In December 2011 the Kings County Association of Governments turned down a station planning grant that it had already been approved for due to opposition within the county. Tulare County and the City of Visalia continued to pursue a similar grant, leading to complaints from Kings County officials that Tulare County was sidelining Kings County's jurisdiction. Hanford officials also complained that the opening of the high-speed rail station would lead to a loss of service to the existing downtown Amtrak station, negatively affecting the city's tourism industry due to the new station being from the city center. The initial plans called for the high-speed rail line to diverge from the BNSF line and run east of Hanford city limits, with a west bypass not considered due to increased impacts on wetlands and farmland, negative effects on potential development between Hanford and Lemoore, and increased distance from Visalia. However, in October 2011 the California High-Speed Rail Authority recalled its draft environmental impact report to produce a new one that would consider both routes. An initial report in April 2013 indicated that the western alternative with below-grade tracks was preferred. However, in November 2013 the Authority approved the original eastern alignment for largely the same reasons that it was initially preferred, along with the discovery that the groundwater in the western area was only to below ground level due to an impermeable clay formation, making a below-grade track unfeasible there. In August 2015, the Hanford City Council rejected contributing $100,000 to a planning grant that included a potential light rail line connecting the high-speed rail station to the centers of Hanford and Visalia, the Cross Valley Corridor. Tulare County had already approved its $100,000 contribution, and the California High-Speed Rail Authority had promised $600,000, but Hanford's rejection killed the entire grant. Tulare County and Visalia officials indicated that they would seek funding to plan for a connectivity study potentially including light rail even without the assistance of Kings County or Hanford. = Construction = In November 2019, it was announced that construction of the viaduct leading to the station would begin the following month. The design at this point had changed from an at-grade to an elevated station on a mile-long viaduct, with the benefits of having a smaller footprint, avoiding modifications to the Union Pacific Railroad line and an electrical transmission line at the location, and allowing potential Cross Valley Corridor service to be accessed at-grade beneath the high-speed rail tracks.

The first purpose-built high speed rail station in the United States, it is part of the system's Initial Construction Segment. The facility is located in Downtown Fresno at H Street between Fresno and Tulare Streets, and is about 7 blocks south from the existing Fresno Amtrak station. The high-speed rail line runs along the right-of-way of the Union Pacific Railroad at this location. History The station itself replaced a Greyhound bus terminal dating from the 1950s. In July 2015, it was estimated that construction of the station building itself would commence in 2017 or 2018 and was expected to spur new development in Downtown Fresno. Several existing industrial and office buildings in the vicinity had to be demolished to make way for the station and tracks. In October 2016, the plans called for the station to occupy about 120,000 square feet and cost about $80 million, with the planning work being finished by the end of 2019. At the end of January 2017, demolition was begun on the former Greyhound bus station occupying the site of the future high-speed rail station.

The station was initially intended to be the northern terminus of the system's Initial Construction Segment. The high-speed rail line runs along the right-of-way of the Union Pacific Railroad at this location. The station is north of the planned Chowchilla Wye, where the high- speed rail splits into two branches. Merced is on the eastern branch, which at the conclusion of Phase II will continue northwards to Sacramento. The California High-Speed Rail Authority's February 2016 draft business plan said that the Merced station would not begin service at the same time as the initial San Jose to Bakersfield route in 2025, but would likely open in 2029 instead. The Merced City Council vigorously opposed the delay in the station opening, noting that Merced would be a prime area for commuters seeking to use high-speed rail to access jobs in Silicon Valley. In response, the April 2016 revisions to the business plan indeed included Merced in the initial construction segment, initially as a single-track spur connecting only to the westbound track to the Bay Area, with buildout of the full Chowchilla Wye happening later. The station was chosen as the terminus of the Altamont Corridor Express commuter rail extension into Stanislaus and Merced Counties; the siting of ACE platforms will be dependent on the HSR location selection and may also change accordingly. The line is planned to open to the station in 2027, anticipating high-speed services. Additionally, the San Joaquin Joint Powers Authority has plans to run San Joaquins trains to the station as a feeder line into the Merced to Bakersfield high speed segment. A new rail link connecting the BNSF line on the north of Merced to the high speed rail station will facilitate the transfer.

It is the first permanent structure constructed as part of California High-Speed Rail. The bridge site is located just east of the city limits of Madera, California, approximately 20 miles northwest of the planned Fresno high-speed rail station, and approximately 10 miles southeast of the planned Chowchilla Wye. Because the site is downstream of the John Franchi Diversion Dam, the riverbed is normally dry unless heavy rains cause the dam to overtop. The bridge will be 1600 feet long and 25 feet high, and will run parallel to the BNSF Railway bridge over the Fresno River.  Construction  Construction began in June 2015. Initial work consisted of assembling rebar cages for the bridge columns and pouring concrete. In August 2015, temporary cofferdams were erected to excavate sand to construct the bridge's structural supports. By the end of October 2015, the work on the piles had ended and the rebar skeletons of the 16 columns had been erected. In late March 2016, concrete began to be poured for the bridge's superstructure. In October 2016, the final span of the bridge was being constructed and the rest of the deck was complete, with preparations commencing for installation of the deck's barrier wall.

Rittmann is Regents' Professor of Environmental Engineering and Director of the Swette Center for Environmental Biotechnology at the Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University, and a member of both the Civil Engineering and the Chemical Engineering Sections of the National Academy of Engineering.NAE profile, National Academy of Engineering Members Directory. accessed Nov 6, 2015 He was elected to the Academy in 2004. Biography Rittmann was born in St. Louis, MO to Albert and Ruth Rittmann. He moved to Affton, MO at age 4 and attended Reavis Elementary School and Affton High School. In 1974, he received the BS degree in Civil Engineering and MS degree in Environmental and Sanitary Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis. After working as an environmental engineer with Sverdrup & Parcel in St. Louis, he moved to Stanford University, where he received the PhD in Environmental Engineering in 1979. His PhD adviser was Perry L. McCarty. Rittmann joined the faculty in the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1980 as an assistant professor. He was promoted to associate and full professor in 1984 and 1988. In 1992, Rittmann moved to Northwestern University to become the John Evans Professor and Area Coordinator of Environmental Engineering. In 2005, he moved to Arizona State University to start the Center for Environmental Biotechnology in the newly formed Biodesign Institute. He was named a Regents‚Äô Professor in 2009, and the Center was endowed as the Swette Center for Environmental Biotechnology in 2011. Rittmann was the President of the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors in 1990-91, the same organization‚Äôs Distinguished Lecture in 2004, chairman of two National Research Council (NRC) committees concerning in situ bioremediation, vice- chairman of the NRC‚Äôs Water Science and Technology Board, and Editor-in-Chief of Biodegradation. Rittmann is married to Marylee MacDonald and the proud step father of Drs. Jacqueline MacDonald-Gibson, Robert MacDonald, Theodore MacDonald, and John MacDonald. Research = Biofilm modeling = Rittmann is one of the pioneers in developing and applying mathematical models of biofilms, which are microorganisms that grow attached to a solid surface. Although some biofilms are infamous for causing infections or fouling the surfaces of pipes, ships, and membranes, Rittmann focuses on the good biofilms used to treat contaminated water. Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool to integrate the several microbiological, chemical, and transport processes that occur together in a biofilm. Models can represent the gradients in substrates that the microorganisms metabolize, the products generated by the microorganisms, and the different types of microorganisms that exist together in biofilms. Rittmann's PhD dissertation focused on biofilm modeling, and he and his team have expanded the scope and power of biofilm modeling up through today. = Molecular microbial ecology = Originally working in cooperation with Dr. David Stahl, Rittmann introduced the powerful tools of molecular biology to environmental engineering, helping create the exciting field known today as Environmental Biotechnology, in which the goal is to manage microbial communities so that they provide services to society. The tools of molecular microbial ecology directly interrogate the genetic information in microorganisms. They make it possible to determine what types of microorganisms are present in the complex communities of environmental biotechnologies, what reactions those microorganisms can carry out, what reactions they are carrying out, and how they interact with each other and their environment. Now working hand-in-glove with Center colleague Dr. Rosa Krajmalnik-Brown, Rittmann is using molecular microbial ecology to understand and manage microbial communities in a wide range of microbiological processes used for removing pollution from water, generating renewable resources, and improving human health. = Microbial products = Rittmann and several colleagues were the first to define soluble microbial products (SMP), which comprise a wide range of soluble organic molecules that microorganisms release to their environment. With Dr. Chrysi Laspidou, Rittmann linked SMP to the solid-phase products generated by microorganisms, the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS); they created the ‚Äúunified model‚Äù of SMP, EPS, and active biomass, and it has been expanded and applied to all types of microbiological processes. Being major sinks for electrons and carbon, SMP and EPS have profound impacts on the performance of environmental biotechnologies in terms of effluent quality and the composition of the biomass. = Bioremediation = Bioremediation refers to the microorganism-based clean up of contaminated soils and associated water. Rittmann's PhD research involved bioremediation of organic micropollants from wastewater recharge to aquifers. His work expanded to the bioremediation of chlorinated solvents, petroleum hydrocarbons, and radionuclides. Rittmann helped establish and direct the field of in situ bioremediation through the publication of two National Academy reports from committee he chaired: In Situ Bioremediation: When Does it Work? (1993), and Natural Attenuation for Groundwater Remediation (2000). = Membrane biofilm reactors = Rittmann is the inventor of the Hydrogen-based Membrane Biofilm Reactor (MBfR), which can be used to reduce and detoxify a wide range of oxidized pollutants commonly found in water: e.g., nitrate, perchlorate, chromate, selenate, trichloroethene, and uranyl. In the MBfR, H2 gas is delivered directly to H2-oxidizing bacteria that live on the outer surface of a bubble-less gas-transfer membrane. The oxidized contaminants in the water moving past the biofilm are reduced to harmless or readily removed forms. Rittmann holds six patents on the MBfR, which is commercialized at the ARo (Autotrophic Reduction of) technology by APTwater. The MBfR won the 2011 Environmental Engineering Excellence Award from the American Academy of Environmental Engineers. = Photobioenergy = Rittmann‚Äôs photobioreactor team is working towards finding practical ways to utilize photosynthetic microorganisms to capture sunlight energy and convert CO2 into valuable feedstock for fuels and chemicals. The team focuses on advanced photobioreactor systems that give high productivity of the target product. The product can be part of the biomass itself or chemical synthesized and excreted by the photosynthetic microorganisms. The latter theme is in cooperation with Dr. Willem Vermaas of ASU‚Äôs School of Life Sciences. The ultimate goal is to make CO2 a resource for generating renewable fuels and chemicals. = Microbial electrochemical cells = Microbial electrochemistry utilizes bacteria that are able to transfer electrons to the anode of an electrochemical cell. Called ‚Äúanode-respiring bacteria,‚Äù they are able to oxidize organic molecules and create an electrical current that can be used to generate electrical power, hydrogen gas, hydrogen peroxide, or other reduced materials, depending on conditions at the cathode of the electrochemical cell. Working with Center colleagues Dr. C√©sar Torres and Dr. Sudeep Popat, Rittmann is advancing the fundamental science and technology bases for microbial electrochemistry, with the ultimate goal of using the technology to capture the energy in organic waste streams as valuable energy or chemical outputs. = Intestinal microbial ecology = The human intestines harbor a very high diversity of microorganisms that interact with the human host in ways that profoundly affect the host‚Äôs health. Working with Center colleagues Dr. Rosa Krajmalnik-Brown and Dr. Andrew Marcus, Rittmann is helping to uncover the microorganisms that are essential for good health, as well as means to enhance the activity of our ‚Äúgood‚Äù bacteria. The team‚Äôs work is characterized by its comprehensive nature and orientation towards microbial ecology. The utilize high-throughput genomics, metabolomics, and quantitative modeling to understand the complex interactions among the many microorganisms and the human host, as well as to uncover means to manage the microbial communities towards good health outcomes.

The Lithuanian Tatars, descendants of Crimean Tatars, were organized into a single squadron at the beginning of the Russian Campaign. Their first commander was Squadron Leader Achmatowicz, who was killed at Vilna and succeeded by Captain Ulan, who led the unit through the remainder of the war. The Lithuanian Tatars were disbanded during the First Bourbon Restoration.  Origins  The appellation \\"Tartars\\" was commonly used in the 17th and 18th centuries, but \\"Tatars\\" has become the common usage in recent times. During the 14th century, several families from Tatar tribes in Crimea followed Grand Duke Vytautas to Lithuania, where they served as his personal guard at Trakai Island Castle. After the Polish-Lithuanian union in 1385, the Tatars divided and formed communities in several villages. Unlike the Christian Lithuanian people, the Tatars were Muslims; they were granted religious freedom and were exempt from taxes, but still had to provide military service. In the 18th century, after the partition of Poland and Lithuania by Russia, Austria, and Prussia, the Tatars fell under Russian rule. Some Tatar volunteers served in the Polish Army after the creation of the Duchy of Warsaw by Napoleon in 1807.  Organization  Lithuanian Tatars of the Imperial Guard at the charge, by Richard Kn√∂tel. In June 1812, General Micha≈Ç Sokolnicki suggested that Napoleon create a regiment of Lithuanian Tatars. He wrote of \\"their probity, as well as their courage were experienced [‚Ä¶]\\". Despite Napoleon's hopes that the unit could comprise up to a thousand soldiers, only enough Tatar volunteers could be found to form a squadron. It was composed of 123 men including 1 squadron leader, 1 major, 4 captains, 7 lieutenants and second lieutenants, and 110 non-commissioned officers and soldiers. The squadron also had an imam named Aslan Aley, who also served as a second lieutenant. The unit was officially created in October 1812 and was placed under the command of Colonel Mustapha Murza Achmatowicz, who paid for the squadron's equipment and uniforms. The Tatars were attached to the 3rd Lithuanian Lancers Regiment of the Imperial Guard as scouts.  Military campaigns  Officer and troops of Lithuanian Tatars at the outposts. Picture by Bronislaw Gembarzewski, 1896. The squadron participated in the 1812 French invasion of Russia with the 6th Brigade of the Imperial Guard Cavalry (√âlite Gendarmes, 3rd Lancers and Tatars). They suffered heavy losses during the invasion, particularly at Vilna from 10 to 12 December where Squadron Leader Achmatowicz was killed with 34 of his men. The Tatars also participated in the Battle of Kalish on 13 February 1813. The survivors were first incorporated into the remnants of the 3rd Lancers, which had nearly been destroyed at Slonim in October 1812, and then combined with the Polish Lancers of the Imperial Guard where they formed the 15th Company, considered as \\"Middle Guard\\". By this time, the Lithuanian Tatars were led by Captain Samuel Murza Ulan with lieutenants Ibrahim and Aslan Aley as seconds-in-command, with a total strength of only 53 men. From April to June 1813, on the recommendations of Colonel-Major Dautancourt, the Captain Ulan tried to recruit new cavalrymen and left for France with mar√©chal des logis-chef Samuel Januszerwski. Reduced to just 47 men, he was refused foreign soldier reinforcements at Metz and went to Paris to seek support from Minister of War Henri Jacques Guillaume Clarke. Unsuccessful, Ulan and 24 recruits returned to Friedberg, Germany, the depot of Polish Lancers. The Lithuanian Tatars continued to serve under Captain Ulan as part of the Polish Lancers during the 1813 German Campaign, participating in battles at Dresden, Peterswalde, Leipzig and Hanau. The Tatars were then transferred to the 3rd Polish Scouts Regiment of the Imperial Guard and saw further losses during the 1814 French Campaign, having 6 killed and 7 taken prisoner. After the abdication of Napoleon on 6 April, Ulan and the few survivors returned to Lithuania. According to Pigeard, 100 men of the initial 123 died by the end of the campaign.

With facilities in Crown Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant, and Prospect Heights, it is a full-service non-profit community hospital that has 287 beds and serves more than 11,000 inpatients each year. It also has more than 200,000 outpatient visits and services and 50,000 emergency department visits annually. Interfaith is also a teaching hospital, with four graduate medical education residency programs, and fellowship programs in Pulmonary Medicine, Cardiology and Gastroenterology. Interfaith continues to serve as a safety-net hospital for its surrounding community since it emerged from bankruptcy in 2014. In addition to its main campus at 1545 Atlantic Avenue, Interfaith has other buildings which house specialists who provide care and offer community education and physician referrals to several other areas in Central Brooklyn. The largest is the Bishop Orris G. Walker, Jr. Healthcare Center, located at 528 Prospect Place and serving Prospect Heights and Crown Heights. The Bishop Orris G. Walker Center houses most outpatient specialties along with an internal medicine clinic and Atlantic Urgent Care.  History  Interfaith Medical Center was formed on December 31, 1982 with the merger of two large, previously independent hospitals, the Brooklyn Jewish Hospital and Medical Center in Crown Heights and St. John's Episcopal Hospital in Bedford- Stuyvesant. = St. John's Episcopal Hospital = The official date for the dedication and incorporation of the St. John's Episcopal Hospital are unknown. The best documentation dates St. John's Episcopal Hospital's services to the mid-19th century. The Episcopal Diocese of Long Island established the St. John's Episcopal Home for the Aged and the Blind on Herkimer Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. = Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn and Medical Center = The Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn opened as a small dispensary at 70 Johnson Street in 1895. Originally the Jewish Hospital Society of Brooklyn, the dispensary grew to serve the burgeoning populations of Crown Heights and Prospect Heights. On December 9, 1906, the society dedicated the Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn. By the 1950s, it had grown to be one of the largest and best hospital complexes in Brooklyn. In addition to the main building, which faced Classon Avenue, the hospital had a nursing school and residence (built in 1927) and several adjoining pavilions, wings and clinics, the last of which seem to date from the 1950s. In December 1948, Dr. Rudolph Nissen, a hospital surgeon, famous for developing a widely used operation to prevent esophageal reflux, performed an exploratory laparotomy on Albert Einstein at the hospital. = Merger = St. John's Episcopal and Brooklyn Jewish Hospital both grew during the first half of the 20th century. At the heights of their successes, they were the largest employers in Central Brooklyn. However, after World War II, the population of the neighborhood began to change. The affluent residents began to decamp to the suburbs and were replaced by a less wealthy population. The patients in the area began to become more reliant on Medicare and Medicaid, and these government programs paid less than private health insurers. As a result, the both hospitals became increasingly financially unstable. Brooklyn Jewish Hospital declared bankruptcy in 1979. It received federal protection, was able to reorganize, and its operations continued until 1982. Although St. John's did not declare bankruptcy, its finances nevertheless became increasingly precarious. To save the two hospitals, a merger was completed in December 1982. The combined entity was called Interfaith Medical Center. After the merger, Interfaith continued to struggle financially. In 1985, its medical residents went on a two-week strike over disputed wages and long hours of work.  Facilities  =Behavioral Health Services= Offerings in behavioral health are a mainstay of Interfaith's medical services. The medical center provides a wide array of outpatient, inpatient and emergency behavioral health, psychiatric, detoxification, and drug rehabilitation programs. The hospital also assists patients in entering housing and outpatient chemical dependency programs. =Bishop Orris G. Walker Jr. Health Care Center= This center provides numerous outpatient services. The facility consists of 34 outpatient clinics in general medicine and a wide range of other specialties and subspecialties. =AIDS Treatment Center= Interfaith provides federally supported care and treatment services in their AIDS Treatment Center. Hospital rating data The HealthGrades website contains the clinical quality data for Interfaith Medical Center, as of 2017. For this rating section three different types of data from HealthGrades are presented: clinical quality ratings for thirteen inpatient conditions and procedures, twelve patient safety indicators and the percentage of patients giving the hospital as a 9 or 10 (the two highest possible ratings). For inpatient conditions and procedures, there are three possible ratings: worse than expected, as expected, better than expected. For this hospital the data for this category is: * Worse than expected ‚Äì 7 * As expected ‚Äì 5 * Better than expected ‚Äì 1 For patient safety indicators, there are the same three possible ratings. For this hospital safety indicators were rated as: * Worse than expected ‚Äì 4 * As expected ‚Äì 7 * Better than expected ‚Äì 1 Percentage of patients rating this hospital as a 9 or 10 ‚Äì 52% Percentage of patients who on average rank hospitals as a 9 or 10 ‚Äì 69%HealthGrades website, https://www.healthgrades.com/hospital-directory/new-york-ny-nyc-suburbs-long- island/interfaith-medical-center-hgstbaf97b36330397 .

Limbrunner that had its premiere performance on 17 September 2015 at the theatre \\"Cabaret des Grauens\\" (also known as \\"Cabaret am Bichl\\") in Burghausen Germany. It is notable for being the first theatrical adaptation of the Meredith Kercher murder case, and the subsequent miscarriage of justice concerning Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito. The play is both a true crime documentary and a classic courtroom drama depicting the Nencini trial that took place from September 2013 until January 2014 in Florence, Italy. The play ran from 17 September 2015 until 10 October 2015. It is in two acts and has a running time of 3 hours.  Background  The play is an original work based on official courtroom transcripts, publicly available police documents and files, newspaper reports, and the author's own research. The author invested eight years following the case, three years of research, and one year of writing. The official press folder explains the purpose of the play: \\"The Verdict Of Perugia\\" is an attempt to recreate a real trial, with the real facts, the real argumentative line, using authentic photographic and video material, in the form of an exciting suspense play, a successor of classic courtroom dramas like \\"Inherit The Wind\\", \\"12 Angry Men\\" and \\"Judgment At Nuremberg\\". The sequence of events and wording of the Nencini trial had to be condensed and partially fictionalized for dramatic reasons. Some of the characters, like Amanda Knox, who were not present in person at the Nencini trial, although their statements and witness depositions were provided to the Judges, were shown testifying to the court within the play, in order to keep the plot vivid and lively. Some real life persons have been amalgamated into fictitious characters in order to make it possible to tell the story. The defense attorney in the play, Vincente Petroscaglia, is based on Carlo Dalla Vedova and Luciano Girgha, while prosecutor Dottoressa Carla Collodi (intentionally named after Pinocchio author Carlo Collodi), was based on both Giuliano Mignini and Manuela Comodi. The Play was written to be performed by seven live actors, all male and all female witnesses played by the same two actors.  Characters  Amanda Marie Knox Raffaele Sollecito Judge Alessandro Nencini Vincente Petroscaglia, Defense Attorney Dr. Carla Collodi, Assistant Chief Prosecutor Of Perugia Meredith Kercher (Voice Over) Dr. Luca Lalli, pathologist Edgardo Giobbi, police officer Giuseppe Codispoti, CSI officer Dr. Patrizia Stefanoni, forensic scientist of the police Prof. Dr. Carla Vecchiotti, independent forensic scientist Rita Ficarra, police officer The opening night cast included Andrea Reinbacher, Nadine Konietzny, Bernhard H√∂fellner, Lisa Hanoeffner, Sascha Ciric, Patrick Brenner, Elke Heinrich as the voice of Meredith Kercher and the author of the play.  Plot  PROLOGUE In the prologue of the play authentic video- and photo material is projected for the audience, while Meredith Kercher, as a wise voice from the afterlife, in heightened language narrates the story of the crime and the first two main trials. She concludes that what the audience is about to see is the third struggle about the verdict of Perugia, the so-called Nencini trial. ACT 1 The first act opens with judge Nencini opening the trial and explaining in an introductory speech the task of the court in this case. This is followed by the opening statements of prosecutor Carla Collodi and defense attorney Vincente Petroscaglia. While the prosecution puts forward a theory of three perpetrators of the crime, Amanda Knox, Raffaele Sollecito and Rudy Guede, who murdered together for different reasons, the defense argues that Meredith Kercher was the victim of a sole killer, serial burglar Rudy Guede, who broke into the apartment in Via della Pergola 7, and was caught in the act by the victim returning home. The prosecution presents as first piece of evidence a reading of Rudy Guedes 2007 statement to the prosecution, in which he identified Knox. When Collodi wants to conclude the reading, the defense interrupts pointing out, that the reading of the protocol was incomplete. Petroscaglia reads the rest of the statement, to prove that originally Rudy Guede did not mention Sollecito but was tricked into it, during a recorded interruption of this first interrogation. The prosecution then presents Amanda Knox 1.45 statement from early 6 November 2007, often misinterpreted as a \\"confession\\". The next day Collodi calls the scientific witnesses of the prosecution to the stand. Dr.Patrizia Stefanoni from the Polizia Scientifica testifies that a lot of Rudy Guede's traces were found in the victim's blood, that DNA traces of Knox were found in her house, also shoeprints of her and her bare footprints in Kerchers blood. She also heavily incriminates Sollecito. Regarding the two main pieces of evidence, the bra clasp and the alleged murder weapon, the double DNA knife, Stefanoni clearly attributes them to Sollecito and Knox, therefore providing convincing evidence for three murderers. Stefanoni is followed by pathologist Dr. Luca Lalli who, visibly shaken by the memory of the crime scene, gives the results of Kerchers autopsy. When Collodi wants to bring him to testify that more than one person was necessary to hold the victim, he refuses to do so, to Collodi's dismay. Petroscaglia cross examines Dr. Lalli, who then explains that there were absolutely no traces of the defendants to be found on the victim's body, that there is no evidence that more than one person held the victim, and that the fatal knife wound was dealt to Kercher be someone who stood behind her, presumably attacking her by surprise. Petroscaglia is able to move Lalli into confirming that the alleged murder weapon is not fitting the wounds of the body, being too long by almost ten centimeters. The scene jumps several days forward, to the point in time when the defense opens their case, beginning with a speech in which Petroscaglia sharply criticizes the rule of the judge in the constitutional state especially the complete freedom of evidence evaluation, which makes the profession of judge the only one standing above the law. After an argument with Nencini, Petroscaglia calls Rudy Guede to the stand. But the Judge denies the request to hear that witness, even if Guede is the only person whose presence at the crime scene at the night of the murder is undoubtedly confirmed. Angrily the defense calls police officers Edgardo Giobbi and Rita Ficarra to the stand, in order to cross examine them. In the relentless questioning of Giobbi Petroscaglia is able to prove that Giobbi's opinion that the break in into the apartment was faked, is not based on police investigation of any kind, but only by Giobbis \\"certain feeling\\". The defense is also able to establish that the investigators‚Äô suspicions based on Knox‚Äô alleged strange behavior after murder are completely unfounded ‚Äì using Giobbi himself as an example. In the even more forceful interrogation of Officer Ficarra Petroscaglia can show that Knox‚Äô 1.45 statement, memoriale one, was made under extreme suggestive pressure and duress, and was the result of a highly illegal questioning. Ficarra is shown to be very aggressive and forced to admit, that the statement was not given voluntarily. The scene fades into black, and the meta level of the play emerges for the first time. Amanda Knox enters the stage and speaks about her tribulations of being unjustly accused. The First Act closes with Knox‚Äô remark that there may be a lot more wrongful conviction cases than anybody thinks. ACT 2 The Second Act starts again with a monologue of Amanda Knox on the Meta level of the plot, in which she tells us, how she met Meredith Kercher for the first time, and also explains how na√Øve she had been, when she first came to Perugia not knowing what life would hold in store for her. Throughout the second act, whenever time shifts happen, monologues of the Amanda character are placed, so that the audience can find many-sided ways to identify with her and her subjective point of view. The Action then shifts back into the courtroom where Judge Nencini announces that the defense will now present its scientific witnesses. First Giuseppe Codispoti from the crime scene investigation squad is called to the witness stand. The good hearted Codispoti is confronted with the famous picture of the alleged bloody bathroom that was reprinted worldwide. He freely admits that the red substance is not blood but a forensic marker and Amanda Knox did never see the bathroom with those supposed \\"fountains of blood\\". When Codispoti is asked to comment the original police video containing the discovery of the bra clasp, which is projected for the court, he cannot help but confirm that the bra clasp could very easily have been contaminated since the international protocols for evidence collection have all been neglected entirely. The video clearly shows that the gloves with which the clasp was touched, were visible dirty. Dr. Collodi forgoes the opportunity to cross examine Codispoti. The central witness for the defense is Prof. Dr. Carla Vecchiotti, who, together with Dr. Stefano Conti, provided the first independent examination of the physical DNA evidence in the case. She reluctantly takes the stand. Vecchiotti, very timid and shy at the beginning, grows more and more confident during her testimony. She states clearly that the evidence collection was botched up so much, that a cross contamination of all physical evidence from the crime scene is likely. She also points out that the DNA traces of Knox found in her own flat are completely irrelevant because they were only found on those places were everyone necessarily leaves DNA. When Petroscaglia questions Vecchiotti about the alleged murder weapon, Vecchiotti cannot confirm that Kerchers DNA ever was on the knife, since the first sample has been destroyed and could not be tested anymore, and the second sample was proven not to be human DNA, least of all Kerchers, but starch. Since the knife does neither fit the victim's wounds, nor the bloody imprint found on one of the bed sheets, and also shows no trace of Kerchers blood (which it should, if Kerchers DNA had actually still been on it, and the knife therefore could not have been cleaned then) ‚Äì she comes to the conclusion, that it is not murder weapon, but a random knife out of Raffaeles kitchen that has nothing to do with the murder. Vecchiotti then cites the fact that the DNA quantity of the findings on the bra clasp after Stefanoni's testing was five times higher than before the testing, as a definitive proof of contamination. Finally, when asked about the traces in the murder room, Vecchiotti, even to Petroscaglias surprise, goes as far as pointing out, that the lack of any trace of Sollecito or Knox in the murder room, is undeniable proof of the defendants absence during the murder and therefore their innocence. The Judge has to restore order in the courtroom. In the cross examination that follows Collodi tries to lead Vecchiotti astray but the witness, grown confident during her questioning, lectures the prosecutor on scientific thinking instead. One day later Vincente Petroscgalia cross examines Dr. Stefanoni, asking her about the hundreds of test results she did not provide to the defense, even though the court had ordered her to do so. The prosecutor interrupts, and after a heated argument the judge decides that the matter is not allowed to be discussed, which provokes the defense attorney to request a judicial disqualification of the judge for bias. Nencini rejects the request. In the following, brutal questioning of Stefanoni, Petroscaglia is able to prove by confronting the witness with photos and police illustrations that the attribution of singular shoe and footprints to the defendants made by her office, were intentionally wrong, and that Stefanoni had testified falsely about it before. By using a formerly hidden report from her own lab, the defense is able to show, that Stefanoni lied under oath about Knox having left her footprints in the victim's blood, knowing that the footprints were left from showering as early as in 2007. An attempt to break the witness to confess the truth fails, when prosecutor Collodi intervenes. The last witnesses are Amanda Knox herself and Raffaele Sollecito who both vividly and shockingly describe, in a scene based on word by word translations of earlier court transcripts, how they were set under pressure and manipulated during the infamous interrogation night from 5th to 6 November 2007. The second Act nears its closure with extremely passionate and heated closing arguments of both sides. After a recession, and final time shift, during which on the meta level of the play, Knox describes a possible future as wrongfully convicted person incarcerated for three decades, Judge Nencini finally offers his verdict, which, at first seems to end with an acquittal, but then suddenly changes to an unexpected, almost grotesque conviction with even higher sentences. A traumatized Amanda stays back alone, while everybody else is leaving the stage and the epilogue sets in. EPILOGUE The Epilogue starts again with the voice of Meredith Kercher who in poetic terms comments on the travesty called justice, that just happened. After a final goodbye, the epilogue shifts its focus onto the destiny of Amanda and Raffaele and describes the events up to the final and complete exoneration by the Corte Di Cassazione Di Roma in March 2015. The play ends with a quotation from Jean De La Bruyere \\"One Person who is wrongfully convicted is the concern of every decent human being\\"  Reception  Felix Drexler wrote in his review in the Burghauser Anzeiger: \\"Based on the actual files and events of the murder case surrounding Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito, a case that happened in 2007 in Perugia, Italy, and that stirred a lot of controversy both in the justice system and the media, author and director Stefan Limbrunner created a spellbinding and extremely gripping courtroom drama.\\" He further noted that \\"taking into account that authentic photo and video material was presented, the precision of detail and truth to reality Stefan Limbrunner is employing is impossible to surpass\\" Drexler especially praised the actors, writing \\"The mesmerizing performances and impressive use of language is stunning\\". Stefan Limbrunners performance as Vincente Petroscgalia was described as \\"outstanding\\". As of October 26, 2017 the play has been published on Amazon Kindle.

They named the company Oscar after Kushner's great-grandfather, in order to bring a human element to the ethos of the healthcare company.Inc (June 24, 2014) FennDonna-8 Oscar began selling insurance for the same year that the Affordable Care Act exchanges and individual mandate went into effect for the 2014 plan year. In its first year, Oscar secured 16,000 members. In 2015, Oscar expanded coverage to New Jersey and grew to about 40,000 members. =2016= In 2016, Oscar had 145,000 members in New York, New Jersey, California, and Texas. Oscar expanded its operations to Tempe, Arizona in August 2016, where it decided to locate its Concierge teams, their name for their member services model. On August 23, 2016, Oscar announced it would be exiting the New Jersey Marketplace at the end of 2016, citing uncertainties in the market that would make it challenging ‚Äúto operate effectively and continue to deliver access to quality healthcare.\\" Oscar also announced that it would halve the size of its provider network in New York amidst rising premiums in order to ‚Äúgain more control over pricing and patient experience.NewYorkTimes (August 30, 2016) AbelsonReed In November 2016, Oscar opened the Oscar Center in partnership with Mount Sinai Health System. Located in Brooklyn Heights, next to the Jay Street‚ÄìMetroTech station, the Oscar Center had a primary care practice only available to Oscar policyholders, with a doctor, nurse practitioner, and a behavioral health specialist. It also hosted free classes for members, such as yoga classes or classes for expectant mothers. On March 13th, 2020, Oscar closed the Oscar Center \\"until further notice.\\" =2017= On April 25, 2017, Oscar announced its entrance into the small group insurance market, offering health plans in New York.

On June 21, 2017, Oscar announced its intention to expand to additional markets in 2018 in areas of Tennessee, Ohio, Texas, New Jersey and California. On July 12, 2017, Oscar announced that it would be selling small group insurance in the Nashville metro area to companies with up to 50 employees through a strategic partnership with Humana. = 2020 = In January 2020, Oscar announced a partnership with Cigna to bring health insurance plans to small businesses.

Oscar sells Medicare Advantage plans in New York City and Houston, Texas. Mario Schlosser is the company‚Äôs CEO, after serving as Co-CEO with Nazemi until the latter‚Äôs departure in early 2015. While Kushner does not hold a formal role in Oscar‚Äôs daily operations, he remains a major shareholder and Schlosser confirmed (as of 2017) that he has ‚Äúsignificant input in multiple aspects of the company like strategy, hiring, and marketing.\\" Product and services Oscar currently offers individual health plans in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Missouri, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Texas, New Jersey, Tennessee, and California. It offers small group health insurance plans in New York, New Jersey, California, and Tennessee. Oscar also offers Medicare Advantage plans in New York City and Houston, Texas. Oscar assigns each of its members to a ‚ÄúCare Team‚Äù which is made up of a team of three Care Guides and a registered nurse that handle both traditional customer service questions as well as coordination of clinical care. In an interview with the Phoenix Business Journal in 2017, Oscar's former VP of Customer Care Paul Gazely said that Oscar's concierge model ‚Äúhelps to build a relationship and build trust with our members with their health care needs,‚Äù and that the model helps Oscar familiarize itself ‚Äúwith the member‚Äôs needs by looking at the entire member‚Äôs health history.‚Äù As noted by Becker‚Äôs Hospital Review, Schlosser stated that \\"[the Care team helps connect] the dots better, making sure you stay up to date with how you best manage your health. They can see if you are filling [a prescription], and they will reach out to you if you are not.\\" Oscar offers direct appointment scheduling with a selection of its provider partners and (as of 2017) provides an application and tools to serve Oscar members, including a Clinical Dashboard that pulls Oscar members‚Äô medical histories into a single platform. According to WIRED, they built predictive models using purchased Medicare data and Oscar's own claims data to better optimize their patient and doctor provider network based on location and provider specialties. In 2018, Oscar began offering a wider network to its small business customers which it dubbed Circle Plus, as opposed to its original network which it calls Circle.

Cavoye's father, Fran√ßois Ogier or Augier, Seigneur de Cavoye, was a French army officer killed in the service of the crown in 1641 at the Siege of Bapaume following the Battle of La Marf√©e; the young Cavoye was subsequently reared at the French court alongside the Dauphin, the future King Louis XIV, who was three years his junior ‚Äî the two became close lifelong friends. Despite his friendship with the King, in 1668, Cavoye was imprisoned in the Conciergerie for two years following a duel with Marquis de Courcelles; the two had quarrelled over rumours spread by Hortense Mancini that Covoye was having an affair with Courcelles's wife, who was also reputed to be the lesbian lover of Mancini.The Kings' Mistresses: The Liberated Lives of Marie Mancini, Princess Colonna, and Her Sister, Hortense, Duchess Mazarin, by Elizabeth C. Goldsmith, PublicAffairs, 2012 However, as a Favourite of the king, his imprisonment was far from onerous, and he enjoyed many privileges. The dual was fought, in the early morning, in Paris's Le Marais; both dualists were uninjured, but had contravened a strict Royal ban on duelling. Both men served the full two-year sentence. In 1677, the scandal behind him, d'Oger was made Grand Marshall of the Royal Household (Mar√©chal des logis du roi) the same year he married Louise Philippe de Co√´tlogon (1641-1729) who was a Maid of Honour to Louis XIV's wife, Queen Maria Theresa.

As Grand Marshall of the Royal Household, to be near Versailles and the royal court, he bought in 1696, Chateau Voisins in Louveciennes. Unusually, for a King's Favourite, the Marquis de Cavoye was held in high esteem, among those who lauded him were Joseph de Maistre, who said that D'Oger had \\"the highest degree of sentiment of dignity\\" and \\"honour\\"; and D'Artangnan, who claimed that D'Oger was a rare man at court because he never told a lie.

Hayes, also known as General Edmund Hayes, (1849-1923) was an engineer and businessman who built bridges and manufactured autos. He was a pioneer investor in the development of electrical power from Niagara Falls. His company installed the Steel Arch Bridge over the Niagara River and made the first power plant on the Canadian side of the river. Early life Edmund B. Hayes was born in Farmington, Maine, in 1849. He attended Dartmouth College intermittently because he needed to earn sufficient tuition by working at farms or teaching. After completing two years, he transferred to MIT, graduating in 1873 with a civil engineering degree. Career =Union Bridge Company= Poughkeepsie Bridge in 1900Steel Arch Bridge in 1900After short stints with the \\"Passaic Bridge Company\\" in New Jersey and the Erie Railroad, he came to Buffalo, New York, to join George S. Field, a friend who would later become his brother-in-law, at his \\"Morrison, Field Bridge Company.\\" In the 1870s and 1880s, with the expansion of railroads across the U.S., many bridge building companies combined to create larger companies and extend manufacturing facilities. The company Hayes worked for became the \\"Central Bridge Company.\\" In 1883, Hayes was instrumental in persuading the Michigan Railroad that a competitor's design for a bridge spanning the Niagara River in Niagara Falls would not stand the strain of train traffic. He proposed that the railroad use his cantilever design instead. His design would be the first steel span cantilever bridge across the Niagara and one of the largest steel span bridges constructed at that time. In 1884, the company combined with two other small bridge companies to form the Union Bridge Company, with Edmund Hayes, Stewart Maurice and Field as part owners. He and Field supervised an 8-acre manufacturing site (at the foot of Hamburg St. in Buffalo) where 200-300 skilled workers manufactured 15,000 tons of material for bridges that was shipped around the world. The company also installed the Steel Arch Bridge over the Niagara River and made the first power plant on the Canadian side of the river. The company also built the Poughkeepsie Bridge over the Hudson River in 1888, a bridge that has been saved from demolition by transformation into the Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park. In 1891, the Union Bridge Company was sold to the U.S. Steel Company, which would later become American Bridge Company. Hayes celebrated by taking a long overseas trip with his wife. =Lackawanna Steel Company= Lackawanna Steel in 1907In 1889, Lackawanna Iron and Steel Company, at the time the largest steel company in the world, decided to move its facilities out of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Lackawanna was looking to move away from Scranton, Pennsylvania because of increases in union labor cost and lack of railroad access to the company's newly emerging markets in the West. They were drawn to Western New York by the area's easy access to the Great Lakes and the numerous rail lines in the area. Lackawanna Company executives reached out to Buffalo attorney John G. Milburn, who brought in John J. Albright. Albright had been discussing organizing a steel plant in Buffalo with William A. Rogers (vice-president of \\"Rogers, Brown & Company,\\" the largest pig iron dealer in the United States), so Albright asked that Rogers and Hayes be brought into negotiations as well as. To avoid speculation, the company employed Albright to purchase land on its behalf. In March 1899, while Hayes was in Jekyll Island, the Company's executives met with Albright, Milburn, and Rogers in Buffalo and explored several sites, ultimately choosing the undeveloped shoreline on Lake Erie in what was then the western part of the Town of West Seneca, New York. Hayes returned on April 1, 1899, at which point Albright began purchasing land. By the end of the month had obtained nearly all the required property for a price of $1,095,430.98 (). =Buffalo Bolt Company= In 1897, Hayes and Albright bought the Buffalo Bolt Company, which George C. Bell had founded in 1859. Buffalo Bolt produced nuts and bolts that were used by manufacturers in the production of automobiles, ships, trains, household appliances, and hundreds of other products. Under their ownership, production increased many times over. In 1869, Buffalo Bolt produced 14,000 nuts and bolts per day, and by 1911, the Company was producing 1,250,000 per day. By 1920, Buffalo Bolt was producing 600,000,000 pieces of bolts, nuts, and screws as well as 5,000 varieties of finished products and 50,000 tons of steel rolled. In 1921, the company's main factory was located at 101 East Avenue in North Tonawanda, New York, the general offices were in Buffalo, and the western offices were at 934 Monadnock Building in Chicago, IL and 1107 Chemical Building in St Louis, Mo. The officers were: Albright, president; R. K. Albright (Albright's son) and Ralph Plumb, vice presidents; G. A. Mitchell, treasurer; Robert C. Board, secretary. The Board of Directors was composed of: Hayes, Albright, R. K. Albright, Ralph Plumb, G. A. Mitchell, W. P. Cooke, and Anson Conger Goodyear (son of Charles W. Goodyear). =Buffalo and Susquehanna Iron Company= Hayes, along with Albright and Stephen Merrill Clement, had invested in William A. Rogers‚Äô \\"Rogers, Brown & Company\\" subsidiary, \\"The Iroquois Iron Company,\\" in South Chicago, Illinois, which owned a plant containing two blast furnaces. In 1904, Rogers invited Hayes, Albright and Clement to accompany him on one of his periodic visits, as they had not seen the property before. Purportedly, Frank H. Goodyear, another Buffalo businessman, heard of the trip and offered the use of his private car for the occasion. Rogers accepted and invited Goodyear and his brother Charles W. Goodyear to join the party. Goodyear was so impressed with the capacity of the plant to produce tonnage that he wanted one established on the line of the Goodyear brother's Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad. Rogers and the Goodyear Brothers joined forces to create a company and plant in Buffalo that was called the Buffalo and Susquehanna Iron Company, named after the Goodyear brother's Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad. Soon after, the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad, the Buffalo and Susquehanna Iron Company, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Lackawanna Steel Company jointly built a giant ship canal on the border of Buffalo and Lackawanna called the \\"Union Ship Canal.\\" The canal, used by all parties, allowed room for steamships to bring in iron ore from Michigan and Minnesota to be reduced to pig iron. The Union Ship Canal's continued to be used as an industrial waterway until January 1982 with the closure of the Hanna Blast Furnace. Personal life Jekyl Island Club After moving to Buffalo, he was introduced to his George Fields' sister in-law, Mary H. Warren whom he married in 1878. They did not have any children, collected art, and had an extensive library. For much of his later life, he was called \\"General Hayes,\\" an honorary military title he acquired from the time he served as chief of the engineering division of New York State. Hayes was a personal friend of Grover Cleveland, who made him a General in the National Guard while Cleveland was President. He was a member of the Jekyl Island Club, joining in 1886 and being a member until 1921. Hayes died on October 19, 1923, and Mary died November 16, 1924. =Home= 300x300px In 1891‚Äì92, Hayes and his wife had Green & Wicks design a home for them at 147 North Street, two doors from the Metcalfe House (built in 1882 by McKim, Mead & White and demolished in 1980). The Hayes home was of yellow brick (\\"old gold\\") and \\"chocolate brown\\" contrast elements. In 1922, the Hayes moved from their home and sold it to the University of Buffalo Alumni for $100,000 () as their first clubhouse. The Alumni eventually sold the home to commercial interests and it was later demolished. =Philanthropy= Hayes served as a member of the University of Buffalo Council from 1920 to 1923, and left a bequest of $389,000 () to the university upon his death. When the structure was remodeled for university use, the Hayes bequest was honored in naming the building Edmund B. Hayes Hall. He served on the board of the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy and, in 1892, gave $5,000 () to assist the school in offering classes. From 1915 until his death, he supplemented the academy's annual budget to cancel any debts. St. Paul's Episcopal Church in 1890In 1906, when St. Paul's Episcopal Church was experiencing financial distress, he offered $50,000 () to the church if others in the congregation would collectively match that total, which they did and therefore, was able to remain in Shelton Square. Hayes was the longest-serving vestryman, with 34 years service. In 1913, when he attended the Dartmouth 40th reunion (of the class he would have graduated with), they presented him with a Master of Science degree. After he returned home, sent them a check for $10,000 (). In 1923, when he died he left the following bequests: *Artwork went to the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy, plus $75,000 () for the future purchase of art. *St. Paul's church received another $50,000 () *Buffalo General Hospital received $10,000 () *Children's Hospital, $10,000 () *Home for the Friendless, $5,000 () *The YMCA, $10,000 () *The Farmington, Maine Old South Church, $10,000 () *The Farmington Library, $20,000 () Upon his wife's death, the remainder of their estate was to be divided between the University of Buffalo and Dartmouth College.

He supported the view, not always well accepted by governments, that since the State was part of society, it must be judged in the same courts as individual citizens. Life =Early years= B√§hr was born in Fulda, then as now a small historic town slightly more than 100 km (65 miles) north-east of Frankfurt in a region of the former Holy Roman Empire, at the time still with a somewhat ambiguous constitutional status, known as the Electorate of Hesse. His father was an army doctor. He devoted his own student studies to Jurisprudence and Cameralism (Kameralwissenschaften) at G√∂ttingen and Marburg. =Legal career= In 1848 Otto B√§hr was a member of a commission established to codify the administration of civil justice in the Electorate of Hesse. In 1844 he had obtained a post as a junior Hugh Court judge (Obergerichts-Assessor), and in 1849 he became a more senior Hugh Court judicial official (Obergerichts-Rath) in the Kurf√ºrstentum 's capital, Kassel. In terms of the serious political ructions that affected politics and constitutional law in the Electorate of Hesse at the time, Otto B√§hr was an opponent of the arbitrary traditionalism represented by Ludwig Hassenpflug, as a result of which he was sent back to his home town, Fulda, in 1851. However, Hassenpflug fell from power during the early 1850s and in 1856 B√§hr was permitted to return to Kassel. In 1857 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Marburg. He nevertheless rejected offers of academic posts from Marburg and from two other universities. In 1863 or 1864 he was appointed a senior appeal court judge (\\"Oberappellationsgerichtsrat\\") based in Kassel. After the events of 1866, whereby the Electorate of Hesse lost its independence, in September 1867 B√§hr was accepted as a high court judge in the Prussian justice service, headquartered in Berlin. Later, following unification, in 1879, he was appointed as a high court judge at the new state's High Court, which had its seat in Leipzig, but he resigned the post with nervous exhaustion in 1881. =Authorships= B√§hr wrote a number of influential legal works. He was critical of various contemporary developments in Jurisprudence. Of particular importance is his 1864 publication \\"Der Rechtsstaat. Eine publicistische Skizze\\", which provides a basis for modern concepts of the rule of law. =Politics= In 1867 he became a member of the short-lived North German Reichstag, where he remained till the body was dissolved at the end of 1870. Following unification, he was listed as a member of the German Reichstag between 1871 and 1880.Specht, Fritz / Schwabe, Paul : Die Reichstagswahlen von 1867 bis 1903.

The court had its antecedent in a tribunal of 12 judges, composed of both secular (senatorial) judges and of ecclesiastical members, created by Andronikos II Palaiologos () in 1296. It functioned as a supreme court, and there was no appeal from its decisions. The tribunal was reduced to four members, at least one of whom had to be a bishop, by Andronikos III Palaiologos () in 1329, and received the name \\"kritai katholikoi\\". According to Manuel II Palaiologos (), they had authority over all matters; received only written complaints; conducted the hearings, including expert testimony where deemed necessary; and deliberated in seclusion, with the judgement resulting from the majority of opinions. The first four judges were Joseph, Bishop of Apros, Gregory Kleidas, an archdeacon and dikaiophylax, the megas dioiketes Glabas, and Nicholas Matarangos, probably a scholar. They served until a major corruption scandal in 1336/7, of which the first three were found guilty. Besides the original tribunal resident in the capital Constantinople, similar boards of judges appeared in the course of the 14th century in the Byzantine territories of the Despotate of the Morea, in Thessalonica, and Lemnos, as well as in the Byzantine- influenced Serbian Empire and the Empire of Trebizond.

He published a book about Ali entitled The Voice of Human Justice. Jordac hails from south Lebanon village of Marjayoun. He attended a local school for his primary education. Thereafter, he moved to Beirut for further study. In 1950, George published his first book while he was still a teenager titled ‚ÄúWagner and the Woman‚Äù. He started his career as a journalist, working in several magazines. He also taught Arabic literature and philosophy in several universities. In the introduction of the Trouble with Christianity, Philip Voerding who has written the book expresses that \\"The Voice of Human Justice written by an Eastern Christian named George Jordac. Theodicy was the most important belief in 12er Shia ideology after the oneness of God. I found this to be impressive\\". Early life  George Jordac was born in 1931 in the town of Al-Jadida in the Marjayoun area, in southern Lebanon.. Marjayoun consists of two words \\"Marj\\" and \\"Ayoun\\" (springs), the place where the springs come up. It has many springs. The people of the village are lovers of literacy. They also have special regard and respect for Ali ibn Abi Talib. Jordac narrated that his father was mason and hung one stone upon the door of their house, written On it‚Äù There is no chivalrous except Ali ibn Abi Talib and there is no sword except Zolfaghar (Ali ibn Abi Talib‚Äôs sword)‚Äù. Education He finished his primary education in a school in this area. As a child, he read Nahj al-Balagha, the Diwan (poetry-collection) of Al-Mutanabbi, and Majma' al-ba·∏•rayn by Nasif al-Yaziji. He learned about Nahj al-balagha from his brother Fuad Jordac (an engineer, philologist, and poet). Always he escaped from school and went to the side of these spring. The school principal and teachers were always looking after him and every day complained about him to his family. In his family, only his brother, Foad Jordac, supported him. When he was 13 years old, George had memorized much of Nahj al-balagha and the other two books. When Jordac was about 14 years old, he composed the play titled Sunrise. The play was performed at some villages in the south of Lebanon. At this time one of their friends, Mansoor Jordac, decided to send him to Europe for studying Math, but George refused. He came to Beirut and studied Arabic literature at the College of the Church. While George was only 18 years old, he wrote his first literary works that named \\"Wagner and woman\\". After he graduated from the university, George taught Arabic literature and Arabic philosophy in some schools and universities in Beirut, and at the same time, he translated and wrote some articles for Lebanese newspapers and magazines. He wrote in newspapers such as Al-jumhuri al-jadid, Al-hurriyya, al-·π£ayyƒÅd, Al-shabaka, NisƒÅ', Al-kafa·∏• al-'arabƒ´, Al-amn, and some Arabic newspapers printed in Paris, and for two years in Al-watan and Al-ra'y al-ƒÅm, both printed in Kuwait. In 1960, George made up his mind to write the encyclopedia about Ali ibn Abi Talib and named it \\"Ali, The Voice of Human Justice\\". He died on November 5, 2014.

A native of Newark, New Jersey, he achieved first regional and then national prominence for his \\"incredibly detailed\\" and realistic silverpoint drawings which conveyed \\"the softest and most subtle transitions of tonal values.\\" Early life and training Dee was born in Newark, New Jersey on July 8, 1931. He attended Newark Arts High School, graduating in 1950 with a three- year scholarship to attend the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Arts. Drafted into the U.S. Army in 1953, he served two years in Fort Meade and, returning to civilian life, re-entered the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Arts under the G.I. Bill. While a student at that school, he took classes from instructors who had established reputations in their respective fields, including Leopold Matzal (portrait painting), James Rosati and Reuben Nakian (sculpture), and Ben Cunningham (color theory). Among them were two artists associated with the precisionist movement whose teaching had lasting influence on Dee's mature style. One of the two, Charles Goeller, showed Dee how to create realistic drawings in fine detail and the other, Hans Weingaertner, showed him how to make paintings having \\"precise and quiet form\\" and trompe l'oeil realism. Mature style When Newark's Rabin & Krueger Gallery gave Dee his first solo exhibition in 1957, he was making paintings in an abstract style. However, impressed by the gallery's display of silverpoint drawings by Joseph Stella, he subsequently made a transition to an austere style in that medium. In 1958, Dee was hired to teach life drawing at the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Arts and soon thereafter a collage- drawing of his became the first of his works to be purchased by a major museum. This piece, Self-Portrait, revealed his skill in the trompe l'oeil technique by means of which he was able to give the appearance of collage by the precise application of very fine lines. A critic for the New York Times wrote that the self-portrait was a \\"haunting image\\" having \\"great formal and emotional power.\\" The technique soon became Dee's dominant style of drawing. A few years later when Newark Museum showed this drawing along with another called Reflections in White, critics remarked on the \\"superrealism\\" which he achieved, his \\"staggering technical perfection,\\" and an apparent \\"intense concern for truth and purity.\\" This technique shows up in a silverpoint drawing he made in 1964 called Musician. Leo Dee, Fringed Drapery, 2003, silverpoint on paper, 40.6 x 30.5 cm., Museum of Fine Arts, Boston In 1966, a drawing of Dee's appeared in a touring exhibition of 100 drawings sponsored by the American Federation of Arts. Reviewing the show for the New York Times, Grace Glueck, singled out a drawing called Death and Transfiguration as one of her two favorites. A few years later, the art gallery at Yale University purchased Paper Landscape, a silverpoint drawing which the authors of an art book describe as \\"a contemporary handling of the trompe l'≈ìil technique where verisimilitude is the goal.\\" In 1975, Dee was given a solo exhibition at the Coe Kerr Gallery, New York. The show brought together some of his paintings and reliefs as well as the silverpoint drawings for which he had achieved recognition. Writing in the New York Times, a critic admired the painstaking still-life draftsmanship of the drawings and said the other work was \\"unlikely to make history.\\" Three years later, the New Jersey State Museum displayed twenty-seven of his drawings and two masonite reliefs in a show held in the main gallery. A reviewer noted that Dee made his subjects \\"come alive,\\" eliminating superfluous elements and rendering them with great realism. \\"The viewer,\\" she wrote, \\"is not merely getting a detailed rendition of the object, but also a feeling for the essence of that object‚Ä¶ Though incredibly detailed, Dee's work is very modern in its approach.\\" During the 1980s and 1990s, Dee's drawings appeared in group exhibitions in New Jersey museums and galleries and critics continued to praise their fine draftsmanship and meticulous realism. His silverpoint work won praise, as well, for its \\"softness and spirituality.\\" In 1978, a critic wrote that \\"Dee can make a piece of drapery come alive and can make you feel the sensuous curves of an apple, a pear or a lemon, or the mystery of the spiral chamber of a conch shell\\" and, the same year, he himself commented on this quality in his art. \\"In my drawings,\\" he wrote, \\"I strive for elegance and a quality of magic. With a large, open portion of the surface, I seek to create a special universe for each object, giving it a life of its own. Finding human characteristics in a pear or lemon viewing landscapes in a crumpled piece of paper, I try to evoke the feeling that all of nature is one.\\" Art teacher In 1958, Dee was appointed as instructor of drawing and painting in the Newark School Fine & Industrial Art. He later became the school's principal instructor of realistic drawing, retiring in 1993. Thereafter he taught evening classes at the Visual Arts Center of New Jersey in Summit, N.J. and was periodically a visiting instructor at Seton Hall University, South Orange, N.J. Personal information Dee was born on July 8, 1931, in Newark, New Jersey. His parents were Leo J. Dee and Elenor K. Dee. It is suggested that his maternal grandmother, an artist who had attended the predecessor of the school where Dee learned and later taught art, influenced his decision to become an artist himself. In 1963, Dee married the art historian and museum curator, Elaine Evans. She had previously been married to William H. Gerdts, the author of an essay on Dee that appeared in the catalog for Dee's solo show at the Coe Kerr Gallery in 1975. In 1993, Dee retired from his teaching position at the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Arts and three years later, after short-term, part-time teaching stints in northern New Jersey, he and Elaine Evans moved permanently to Truro, Massachusetts, a village on Cape Cod where they had previously spent summer vacations. There, he continued to make silverpoint drawings using elements in the local landscape for his subjects. He died in Truro on November 22, 2004. Other names As his professional name, Dee used Leo Dee or sometimes Leo J. Dee. When young, he was known as Leo J. Dee, Jr. His friends and family called him Joe Dee. Exhibitions During the 1970s and 1980s, Dee exhibited frequently in New Jersey galleries and museums and occasionally, as well, in New York. This list is representative, not comprehensive.

It is a four-story structure, built mainly out of brick and ceramic blocks, although its southeastern section has upper levels with wood framing and finishing. Its main facade has an elaborate projecting entrance portico, with the entrance set in an elliptical-arch opening supported by fluted pilasters. The interior retains significant original features, including a bank vault, marble wainscoting, and a 2,500 seat auditorium. It was built in 1923-24 for the Supreme Lodge of the Woodmen of Union, an African-American social organization, which operated it as a multifunction bathhouse, hotel, hospital, bank, and performance venue. It was purchased in 1950 by the National Baptist Association. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. History The first bathhouses were established at the hot springs in 1830. With the growth in popularity, the United States created a reservation to prevent commercial exploitation. The nineteenth century saw the village grow into a medical- pleasure resort. The 1875 completion of a railroad from Malvern made the springs available to a larger audience.Woodman of Union Building, National Baptist Hotel / GA 0469; Patrick Zollner, National Resister/Survey Coordinator, Arkansas Historic Preservation Program; National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior; May 16, 1997 It is assumed that there was at least a small community of colored people by 1868, when Rev. Henderson Patillo and Rev. B. W. Whitlow came to Hot Springs from Malvern to preach to a group of worshippers. In 1919, the Supreme Lodge of the Woodman of Union, a black social club/union/fraternity, purchased the site. In 1923, the building was erected along Malvern Avenue, between Gulpha and Garden Streets. From throughout Arkansas, African-American men came on January 17, 1924, to dedicate the Woodman of Union Building. Created by the genius of J.L. Webb, Supreme Custodian of the Woodman of Union. The building contained a 100-bed hospital and nurse training school, a 75-room bath hotel, the Woodman of Union Bank, a 2,500 seat auditorium, an electrically operated printing plant, and executive offices were all located within the building. The auditorium hosted attractions such as Count Basie and Duke Ellington. In 1950, the building was purchased by the ‚Äò‚ÄôNational Baptist Association, U.S.A‚Äò‚Äô, being then known as the National Baptist Hotel and Bath House. The bathhouse was subject to federal regulations regarding bathhouse standards, like those along Bathhouse Row. The Association expanded the bathhouse and improved the facilities. As segregation was coming to an end in the 1970s, integrated public facilities became prevalent, and the National Baptist Hotel saw a decline in clientele. In 1981, it closed. In 1984, it was purchased for redevelopment, which was later dropped. In 1991, Hawk Management Group, Inc., of Northern Nevada purchased the building.

On 20 July 2018, he became the first batsman for Pakistan to score a double century in a One Day International (ODI) match. Two days later, he became the fastest batsman to score 1,000 runs in ODIs. In August 2018, he was one of thirty-three players to be awarded a central contract for the 2018‚Äì19 season by the Pakistan Cricket Board. Early life Zaman was born on 10 April 1990 in Katlang in the Mardan District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He moved to Karachi at the age of 16 following matriculation. In 2007, Zaman joined the Pakistan Navy as a sailor after receiving his schooling and training at sea from the Pakistan Navy School, Bahadur. His choice of career was persuaded by his father, who was dissuaded by Fakhar's childhood addiction to cricket and wanted his son to focus on his academics. The name Fakhar literally translates to \\"pride\\". Amongst his teammates, he is known by the nickname fauji (soldier). Domestic and T20 career In Karachi, Zaman continued playing cricket occasionally in inter-departmental matches, including representations for the Pakistan Navy cricket team. He was first identified by his navy coach, Azam Khan, who encouraged him to pursue professional cricket. In 2013, he left his naval career after a \\"tough decision\\" in pursuit of this dream and began appearing for regional outfits like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Abbottabad Falcons, Balochistan and several Karachi teams. He became the second-highest run scorer in the 2016 Pakistan Cup and also impressed selectors in the 2016‚Äì17 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy. He was also picked by the Lahore Qalandars side for the 2017 Pakistan Super League, where he was closely mentored by New Zealand player Brendon McCullum. He was soon noticed by Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur during a training camp in Lahore, following which he earned a call-up for the national side. In August 2017, he was named in Durban Qalandars' squad for the first season of the T20 Global League. However, in October 2017, Cricket South Africa initially postponed the tournament until November 2018, with it being cancelled soon after. In July 2019, he was selected to play for the Rotterdam Rhinos in the inaugural edition of the Euro T20 Slam cricket tournament. However, the following month the tournament was cancelled. International career =International debut= In March 2017, he was named in Pakistan's limited overs squad for their matches against the West Indies. He made his Twenty20 International (T20I) debut for Pakistan against the West Indies on 30 March 2017. In April 2017, he was named in Pakistan's One Day International (ODI) squad for the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy. He made his ODI debut for Pakistan against South Africa in the Champions Trophy on 7 June 2017, scoring 31 runs. In the final against India, Zaman edged to the wicket-keeper, when he was on 3, but survived as it was a no-ball. After that, Zaman went on to score his maiden ODI century and helped Pakistan post a total of 338. With that, Zaman became the first batsman for Pakistan to score a century in an ICC event final. India batting second collapsed and Pakistan won the match by 180 runs to become the winners of Champions Trophy for the first time. Zaman was adjudged man of the match for his batting performance. Zaman and Azhar Ali's partnership in the match was 128 runs, making it the highest opening partnership in the Champions Trophy history for Pakistan, and the highest opening partnership in an ODI for Pakistan since 2009. =2018: England, Zimbabwe and Australia= In April 2018, he was named in Pakistan's Test squad for their tours to Ireland and England in May 2018, but he did not play. On 8 July 2018, Fakhar scored 91 runs against Australia in the tri-series final in Harare to help Pakistan secure the title. He was named man of the final and man of the series. During his innings he also became the first Pakistani batsman to score 500 or more runs in T20Is in a calendar year. On 20 July 2018, in the fourth ODI against Zimbabwe, he became the first batsman for Pakistan to score a double century in ODIs, finishing 210 not out. In the same match, he and Imam-ul-Haq made the then highest opening partnership in ODIs, scoring 304 runs. His innings propelled Pakistan's total to 399, which was their highest score in ODIs. Two days later, in the fifth match of the series, Zaman became the fastest player to score 1,000 runs in ODIs. He reached the milestone in 18 innings, beating the previous record of 21 innings, held by five other batsmen. Zaman went on to score 85 runs in the match, bringing his total to 515 runs in the series, the most by a Pakistan batsman in a bilateral ODI series. Zaman and Imam had scored 705 runs together across the series, the most by a pair in a bilateral ODI series. Zaman also recorded the most runs scored by a batsman between two dismissals in ODIs, with 455. In September 2018, he was named in Pakistan's Test squad for their series against Australia. He made his Test debut for Pakistan against Australia on 16 October 2018. =2019: Cricket World Cup year= In April 2019, he was named in Pakistan's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. Ahead of the Cricket World Cup, in the ODI series against England, Zaman scored 138 runs in the second ODI match. This was the highest individual total for a Pakistan batsman against England in a One Day International. However, three days later, Imam- ul-Haq set a new record with 151 runs, in the third ODI of the series. =2020= In June 2020, he was named in a 29-man squad for Pakistan's tour to England during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, on 23 June 2020, Zaman was one of seven players from Pakistan's squad to test positive for COVID-19.

Birth and education Gepner was born in Philadelphia to Israeli parents. He studied mathematics at Technion, Haifa (B. Sc., 1976) and theoretical physics at the Weizmann Institute, Rehovot (Ph.D., 1985), where his graduate advisor was Yitzhak Frishman. His early work focused on non-perturbative quantum field theory in two space-time dimensions. Research In 1985-1987 Gepner was a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University. He made important contributions to the study of Rational Conformal Field Theory with extended chiral algebras. He also pioneered the use of methods of conformal field theory to study compactifications of superstring and heterotic string on Calabi-Yau manifolds. He introduced exactly solvable examples of such compactifications now known as Gepner models.http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Gepner+model This was an important step in establishing that superstrings and heterotic strings have a landscape of consistent vacua. Later he held research and teaching positions at Princeton University (1987-1989), Weizmann Institute (1989-1993) and California Institute of Technology (1992-1994). Since 1993 he has been an associate professor at the Weizmann Institute. Gepner's later work centered on Rational Conformal Field Theory and its relation with 2D integrable models.

Koneƒçni (born October 27, 1944) is an American and Serbian psychologist, aesthetician, poet, dramatist, fiction writer, and art photographer, currently an Emeritus Professor of Psychology at the University of California, San Diego. In psychology, he has carried out influential work in several distinct areas, related to each other by strong methodological concerns. Koneƒçni has conducted laboratory and field studies of human emotion and (physical and verbal) aggression, as well as of altruistic behavior, which have been cited in numerous social psychology textbooks. Decision-making has been another major research area in which Koneƒçni has been heavily involved (in close collaboration with Dr. Ebbe B. Ebbesen, a long-time colleague at the University of California, San Diego). Most of their work has been devoted to judicial decisions in the criminal justice system, but they have also conducted a number of frequently cited studies of drivers' decisions in real- world settings.Koneƒçni, V.

Finally, Koneƒçni has for some forty years worked in the multi-faceted interdisciplinary domains of empirical aesthetics, psychology of art, and music psychology. Notable groups of his studies in these areas have addressed the highly specialized and technical problems of the \\"golden ratio\\" (or \\"golden section\\") in visual art, the significance of macrostructure in music, peak aesthetic responses, and the relationship between music and emotion. Biography Vladimir Koneƒçni grew up in Belgrade (then the capital of Yugoslavia, now of Serbia). His parents were Dora D. Koneƒçni (n√©e Vasiƒá), an economist and banker, and Josip J.

He lives in San Diego (California, USA), Amsterdam (Netherlands), Tallinn (Estonia), and Belgrade (Serbia). Career Koneƒçni received his Bachelor of Arts degree in experimental and clinical psychology, and philosophy, from the University of Belgrade in 1969; as an undergraduate, he published three refereed articles.Konecni, V.

With regard to aggression, on the basis of experimental findings, Koneƒçni distinguished among physical, verbal, play, fantasy and other types of aggression, and proposed the existence of bidirectional causation (behavioral and psychophysiological) between the degree of anger (high arousal antagonistically labeled) and the amount of expressed physical aggression. This theoretical model, which emphasized previously unacknowledged feedback loops, seems to resolve the classical issue of \\"catharsis\\". By means of definitional clarity and experimental precision, the model shifts the debate to the many implications of the theoretically sound and empirically observable \\"cathartic effect\\",Baron, R.A. (1977). Human aggression. New York: Plenum Press.Kaplan, R. M., Koneƒçni, V. J., & Novaco, R. W. (Eds.). (1984). Aggression in children and youth. The Hague, The Netherlands: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers. replacing unfocused appeals to sources as diverse as Aristotle's Poetics, Kleinian play therapy, and Albert Bandura's social learning theory.Bandura, A. (1973). Aggression: A social learning analysis. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall. This Anger-Aggression Bidirectional-Causation (AABC) theoretical model parsimoniously accounts for hundreds of experimental findings in the literature. These ideas have also been applied to the role of aversive events in the development of intergroup conflict. Subsequently, Koneƒçni's writing on aggression was extended to the concept of revenge and the expression of anger and violence on the stage and in literature. =Legal psychology and judicial decision-making= From 1973 to 2011 (the year of Emeritus Professor Ebbe B. Ebbesen's passing), Ebbesen and Koneƒçni worked on judicial decision-making in the criminal justice system. Using quantitative methods, they studied how various participants in the system ‚Äì judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, police officers, perpetrators, and others ‚Äì combine the information available to them into decisions that then become information items for other decision-makers in the system.

One of its major features has been the comparison of data from experimental simulations to those obtained from archival records and court hearings, often involving the same participants or the same classes of participants (even Superior Court judges participated in the simulations). After their much-cited first article, in 1975, comparing judges' bail-setting decisions in a simulation to those they made in the courtroom,Ebbesen, E. B., & Koneƒçni, V. J. (1975). Decision making and information integration in the courts: The setting of bail. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 32, 805‚Äì821. Ebbesen and Koneƒçni published a number of critical methodological articles on the key issue of external validity at many points in the existing research on the legal process, with special reference to jury simulations.Koneƒçni, V.

Contemporary Psychology, 33, 586‚Äì588. In 1982, Koneƒçni and Ebbesen edited a book (dedicated to Egon Brunswik and Kurt Lewin), The Criminal Justice System: A Social-Psychological Analysis, to which they contributed five chapters that outlined their theoretical and methodological viewpoint and addressed several major empirical issues.Koneƒçni, V. J., & Ebbesen, E. B. (Eds.). (1982). The criminal justice system: A social-psychological analysis. San Francisco, CA: W. H. Freeman. One of the chapters presented the results of a large project (over one thousand cases) on judicial sentencing for felonies in California; among other findings, it included a causal analysis that eliminated several popular views of sentencing and highlighted the decisive role of probation officers.Ebbesen, E.

They also published extensive critiques of what they believed were mistaken, yet entrenched, views on another major issue in legal psychology, namely, the probative value of prior eyewitness memory research in general,Ebbesen, E. B., & Koneƒçni, V. J. (1997). Eyewitness memory research: Probative v. prejudicial value. Expert Evidence, 5, 2‚Äì28. and, specifically, the probative value of psychologists' testimony on eyewitness issues in the cases of exonerations by DNA evidence.Koneƒçni, V. J., Ebbesen, E.

Finally, while working in Koneƒçni's laboratory, G. Kette, an Austrian psychologist, coauthored two articles with Koneƒçni on communication channels and the decoding and integration of cues in judicial decision- making.Kette, G., & Koneƒçni, V. J.

Gruppendynamik, 3, 309‚Äì328. =Empirical aesthetics= Throughout his career, Vladimir Koneƒçni has conducted numerous experiments in diverse areas of empirical aesthetics ‚Äì a field dominated by scientifically oriented psychologists and thus often referred to as psychological or (psycho-) aesthetics (distinct from \\"aesthetics\\", which usually refers to philosophical aesthetics).Koneƒçni, V. J. (2005). On philosophical and empirical aesthetics. In A. ≈†ƒºahova (Ed.), Proceedings of the 4th International Conference Person-Color-Nature-Music (pp. 46‚Äì55). Daugavpils, Latvia: Saule. In his first article (1976) in psycho- aesthetics, Koneƒçni, influenced by Daniel Berlyne (one of his graduate-school mentors), successfully combined work on physiological arousal with his own prior work on the \\"cathartic effect\\" to study music preference (as a dependent variable). A broad and innovative empirical approach to the study of emotional, mood, and personality antecedents of aesthetic preference and choice in both visual art and music resulted in a number of publications with several American and European graduate students and in various languages.Koneƒçni, V.

Koneƒçni also wrote two widely cited theoretical articles that addressed (a) the social, emotional, and cognitive determinants of aesthetic preference and (b) the measurable psychological consequences of exposure to aesthetic stimuli,Koneƒçni, V.

Empirical psycho-aesthetics and her sisters: Substantive and methodological issues (Part 2). Journal of Aesthetic Education, 47, 1‚Äì21. Visual art Various problems in the area of visual art have been frequently and to this day investigated by Koneƒçni. There have been articles, inspired by MAE, on the interactive effects of visual art and music on emotion and mood,Koneƒçni, V. J. (1994). Interactive effects of music and visual art. In I.

Emotion in painting and art installations. American Journal of Psychology, 128, 305‚Äì322. In addition, he is one of very few psychoaestheticians who has been able to study the creative process in vivo ‚Äì in his experimental study of portraiture.Koneƒçni, V. J. (1991). Portraiture: An experimental study of the creative process. Leonardo, 24, 325‚Äì328. Koneƒçni has also written about the politics and social ecology of architecture ‚Äì specifically in Stalin's Soviet Union and Hitler's Germany ‚Äì and he has recently addressed the aesthetic and social issues regarding new museums, public sculptures, and parks in China, Serbia, and Japan.Koneƒçni, V.

The \\"golden ratio\\" For about ten years (1995‚Äì2005), Koneƒçni did a great deal of experimental and theoretical work on the \\"golden ratio\\" (or \\"golden section\\").Koneƒçni, V. J. (1997).

He has repeatedly emphasized the need for distinguishing among the numerous facets of this classical problem in aesthetics and art: Objects in nature vs. objects in art and architecture; the known presence vs. absence of artist's intention in utilizing the ratio; the degree of perceivers' awareness of the ratio in an object and the influence of that awareness, if any, on the object's aesthetic appeal. In his work on paintings, Koneƒçni used many different measures, including the dimensions of the rectangle (frame); the vertical and horizontal bisections of a painting; and the dimensions of significant depicted objects within the painting. He considered the analysis of this variety of measures indispensable and developed several methodological innovations, as well as refinements of the classical Fechnerian ones. Koneƒçni has described the golden ratio as \\"elusive but detectable\\", and more likely to influence the results of carefully conducted experiments as part of higher-order interactions than as a main effect; its \\"contextuality and configurality\\" make it, he has suggested, comparable to concepts in Zen aesthetics. Neuroaesthetics This new, 21st century, area of research has been considered a branch of empirical aesthetics. Koneƒçni has described its main characteristics, and has critically analyzed some of the claims made by several prominent practitioners, arguing that these claims are exaggerated.Koneƒçni, V. J.

(2015). Reflections on psychological and neuroaesthetics. Theoria, 58, 5‚Äì15. =Music psychology= Koneƒçni has been heavily involved in many aspects of music psychology. In addition to the experimental and theoretical articles on the effects of a variety of factors (including high arousal and other forms of stress) on music preference and choice (for example, among melodies differing in complexity), he developed a new methodology to investigate the theoretically interesting question of \\"hedonic effects of development vs. chance in resolved and unresolved aural episodes\\".Koneƒçni, V. J. (1999). Expression and meaning in Tasol: Hedonic effects of development vs. chance in resolved and unresolved aural episodes. Musikpsychologie, 14, 102‚Äì123. Furthermore, he contributed to topics of interest to musicians, such as a two-part article that presented a psychological analysis of J. S. Bach's St. Matthew Passion,Koneƒçni, V. J. (1986, July).

(2009). Mode and tempo in Western classical music of the common-practice era: My grandmother was largely right ‚Äì but no one knows why. Empirical Musicology Review, 4, 23‚Äì26. In addition, Koneƒçni wrote about the (Latin) Requiem by the Russian composer Vyacheslav Artyomov and about the playing style of the Canadian pianist Glenn Gould.Koneƒçni, V. J.

Amsterdam, The Netherlands: North Holland. in which \\"messages\\" were defined broadly to include, in the two experiments devoted to music, the macrostructure of the pieces, such as the original ordering of the movements in Beethoven's piano sonatas and string quartets. Surprisingly, and contrary to strongly held musicological conventions, even drastic reordering of the movements produced negligible decrements in listeners' enjoyment. Follow-up experiments produced analogous results; a variety of highly esteemed and diverse music pieces were used as research stimuli in this work, including J. S. Bach's Goldberg Variations (diverse ordering of the variations) and Mozart's Symphony in G minor, K. 550 (reordering of the key structural parts of the first movement).Gotlieb, H., & Koneƒçni, V. J.

Koneƒçni has taken a strong and elaborate ‚Äì albeit minority ‚Äì stance against what he regards is an avalanche of insufficiently substantiated claims regarding the relationship between music and emotion, and specifically against the thesis that music causes emotion. In a recent book review, he wrote: \\"The authors never clearly state something very simple and almost certainly true: some music may, sometimes, in some people, under some circumstances, elicit some psychobiological emotions, but never nearly as powerful as the correspondent emotions in social life.\\" Koneƒçni has based this view on a careful examination of the literature in both music psychology and philosophical aesthetics; on the Prototypical Emotion-Episode Model (PEEM, which he had developed over many years); on his own experimental findings and theoretical work regarding music and emotion; and on what he perceives as widespread neglect of definitional precision and sound methodology in this multidisciplinary field, including in numerous highly cited research articles. Anti-\\"emotivism\\" Koneƒçni has written that there is ample evidence to view the majority position about the relationship between music and emotion as an aspect of the socio-culturally prevalent \\"emotivism\\", which he distinguished from emotivism in ethics, and defined as \\"the propensity for excessive insertion of emotion and 'feeling' into both lay and scientific theories of mental life, motives, needs, and daily behavior, in matters artistic and non-artistic\\". He has suggested that the proclivity for emotional and quasi-emotional excess is related to the prevalent anti-narrative social climate, which often ignores evidence and reason. Koneƒçni recently published a theoretical article on emotion in the domain of painting and art installations and discussed emotivism in this context also.Koneƒçni, V. J. (2013). A critique of emotivism in aesthetic accounts of visual art. Philosophy Today, 57, 388‚Äì400.Koneƒçni, V. J. (2014). Paintings and emotion: A nonemotivist reevaluation [CD, pp. 34‚Äì39]. Proceedings of the 23rd biennial congress of the International Association of Empirical Aesthetics. New York, USA. =Peak aesthetic experiences= This issue is one in which philosophical aesthetics and psycho-aesthetics are intertwined ‚Äì in general and in Koneƒçni's extensive work in the past decade. In 2005, he published a theoretical article outlining his \\"aesthetic trinity theory\\" (ATT),Koneƒçni, V. J. (2005). The aesthetic trinity: Awe, being moved, thrills.

Philosophy Today, 55, 64‚Äì73. consisting of: (a) physiological thrills (or chills), the most frequent and transient response, and the least pronounced, yet the object of most experimental work; (b) the state of \\"being moved\\", considered to be intermediate in depth and duration (the linguistic representation and conceptual structure of this state have recently been empirically investigated by Kuehnast et al., 2014); and (c) aesthetic awe, conceptualized as the peak aesthetic response, exceedingly rare and memorable, and similar to the fundamental emotions in terms of physiological fluctuation, but, unlike them, characterized by existential safety, controllability of danger, and the ease with which it can be \\"switched off\\". In ATT, aesthetic awe is viewed as the prototypical response to the \\"sublime stimulus-in- context\\" that is external to the perceiver (unlike some positions in philosophy), defined independently of aesthetic awe, and characterized by physical grandeur, great rarity, extraordinary beauty, and novelty, among other criteria). Many aspects of ATT are testable and the results would speak to both philosophical and psychological aestheticians. =Work in literature and the arts= Vladimir Koneƒçni has for a long time been a prolific poet, dramatist, short-story writer, and art photographer. \\"A conversation with Vladimir Koneƒçni about art, aesthetics and critics.\\" He has published literary works in English, French, and Serbian. His plays have been performed in a number of countries in North America and Europe, under his direction on two occasions.

It sets up a two-way link between the sender's computer and the final router in the chain; data passed between them is encrypted in three layers, and each router in the chain peels off one layer along the way. Each data packet \\"remembers\\" only the address of the last router it visited.

Before leaving for Europe to further her studies, Lashanska's recital debut took place on May 2, 1909, at the Lyceum Theatre in New York City, where she performed under the name \\"Hulda Lashan.\\" A critic wrote \\"[Lashanska's] natural ability has been guided into proper channels by thorough instruction, and even now she sings with a measure of art and understanding very uncommon in a singer of her years and inexperience. She revealed an abundance of excellent artistic material, especially a voice of vibrant quality, rich in color, and a pronounced degree of musical and dramatic temperament.\\"\\"Hulda Lashan's Debut,\\" Musical Courier (May 5, 1909). Organized by Alexander Lambert, the concert's purpose was to raise funds for Lashanska's continued studies abroad. Her first song recital at Aeolian Hall took place on January 24, 1918. A critic remarked: \\"From Sembrich, who has taught her for two years, she has acquired not only the art of easy and pure tone production, but also the secrets of style and correct phrasing dependent largely, on her splendid breathing control. She is an oasis in the desert of voices.\\"\\"Hulda Lashanska, a New Vocal Star,\\" New York Post (January 25, 1918). She first sang at Carnegie Hall in 1919. \\"Madam Lashanska has a voice of pure and limpid beauty, artistic gifts of musicianship bestowed like the proverbial silver spoon, by the good fairies at her birth, and she has \\"the aristocratic note,\\" quoted by Emma Eames.New York Times (December 2, 1918) and reproduced numerous times in Lashanska's advertising (for example, Musical Leader (December 12, 1918), p. 569.

Lashanska first appeared with the New York Philharmonic on November 27, 1910, where she sang Franz Liszt's \\"Die Lorelei\\" with the orchestra conducted by Walter Damrosch. Her last appearance with the Phiharmonic was November 22, 1936, at Lewisohn Stadium where she sang an aria by George Frideric Handel and songs by Hugo Wolf under conductor John Barbirolli.\\"Digital Archive,\\" New York Philharmonic website, accessed 1 November 2015. An unnamed critic wrote \\"Her singing merited praise for tonal quality and mellowness along with understanding of the moods of the music. Certain outstanding high notes were somewhat vibratory, but her voice was satisfactory in volume for the taxing requirements of outdoor performance and, for the most part, produced with ample fluency.\\"\\"Stadium Crowd Greets Return of Lashanska,\\" New York Herald Tribune (August 11, 1936).

Visual art forms representing the female genitals encompass two- dimensional (e.g. paintings) and three-dimensional (e.g., statuettes). As long ago as 35,000 years ago, people sculpted Venus figurines that exaggerated the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or vulva. In 1866, Gustave Courbet painted a picture of a nude woman which depicted the female genitals, entitled \\"The Origin of the World\\". In the 20th and 21st century, artists such as Niki de Saint Phalle, Jean Tinguely, Megumi Igarashi and Anish Kapoor have created artworks that depict the vagina or vulva. Sometimes these are explicitly works of feminist art: Judy Chicago created The Dinner Party to celebrate 39 women of history and myth, many of whom had fallen into obscurity. Other artists deny that their works reference the female genitalia, although critics view them as such; the flower paintings of Georgia O'Keeffe are a case in point. There have long been folklore traditions, such as the vagina loquens (\\"talking vagina\\") and the vagina dentata (\\"toothed vagina\\"). Playwright Eve Ensler wrote The Vagina Monologues, a popular stage work about many aspects of women's sexuality. In some cases, vagina- or vulva-themed art has attracted controversy and led to legal issues or official censorship pertaining to perceptions of obscenity. Cultural aspects The vagina represents a powerful symbol as the yoni in Hindu thought. Pictured is a stone yoni found in C√°t Ti√™n sanctuary, Lam Dong, Vietnam. Various perceptions of the vagina have existed throughout history, including the belief it is the center of sexual desire, a metaphor for life via birth, inferior to the penis, visually unappealing, inherently unpleasant to smell, or otherwise vulgar. The vagina has been known by many names, including the ancient vulgarism \\"cunt\\", euphemisms (\\"lady garden\\"), slang (\\"pussy\\"), and derogatory epithets. Some cultures view the vulva as something shameful that should be hidden. For example, the term pudendum, the Latin term used in medical English for the external genitalia, literally means \\"shameful thing\\". Positive views of the vagina use it to represent female sexuality, spirituality, or life, e.g. as a \\"powerful symbol of womanliness, openness, acceptance, and receptivity ... the inner valley spirit\\". Hinduism has given the world the symbol of the yoni, and this may indicate the value that Hindu society has given female sexuality and the vagina's ability to birth life. Other ancient cultures celebrated and even worshipped the vulva, for example in some ancient Middle Eastern religions and the paleolithic artworks dubbed \\"Old Europe\\" by archaeologist Marija Gimbutas. As an aspect of Goddess worship such reverence may be part of modern Neopagan beliefs. History =Prehistory= The Venus of Hohle Fels sculpture, which is at least 35,000 years old, is the oldest example of a vulva in art. Two- dimensional and three-dimensional representations of the vulva, i.e. paintings and figurines, exist from tens of millennia ago. They are some of the earliest works of prehistoric art. The cave of Chuf√≠n located in the town of Riclones in Cantabria (Spain) has prehistoric rock art which may be a depiction of the vulva. The cave was occupied at different periods, the oldest being around 20,000 years ago. Aside from schematic engravings and paintings of animals, there are also many symbols, such as a those known as \\"sticks\\". There is also a large number of drawings using points (puntillaje), including one which has been interpreted as a representation of a vulva. A Venus figurine is an Upper Paleolithic statuette portraying a woman. Most have been unearthed in Europe, but others have been found as far away as Siberia, extending their distribution across much of Eurasia. Most of them date from the Gravettian period (28,000‚Äì22,000 years ago), but examples exist as early as the Venus of Hohle Fels, which dates back at least 35,000 years to the Aurignacian, and as late as the Venus of Monruz, from about 11,000 years ago in the Magdalenian. These figurines were carved from soft stone (such as steatite, calcite or limestone), bone or ivory, or formed of clay and fired. The latter are among the oldest ceramics known. In total, over a hundred such figurines are known; virtually all of modest size, between 4 cm and 25 cm in height. Most of them have small heads, wide hips, and legs that taper to a point. Various figurines exaggerate the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or vulva. In contrast, arms and feet are often absent, and the head is usually small and faceless. =Ancient times= The ancient Sumerians regarded the vulva as sacred and a vast number of Sumerian poems praising the vulva of the goddess Inanna have survived. In Sumerian religion, the goddess Nin-imma is the divine personification of female genitalia. Her name literally means \\"lady female genitals\\". She appears in one version of the myth of Enki and Ninsikila in which she is the daughter of Enki and Ninkurra. Enki rapes her and causes her to give birth to Uttu, the goddess of weaving and vegetation. Vaginal fluid is always described in Sumerian texts as tasting \\"sweet\\" and, in a Sumerian Bridal Hymn, a young maiden rejoices that her vulva has grown hair. Clay models of vulvae were discovered in the temple of Inanna at Ashur; these models likely served as some form of amulets, possibly to protect against impotency. =11th and 12th century= church at Kilpeck, Herefordshire, England Sheela na gigs are 11th and 12th century figurative carvings of naked women displaying an exaggerated vulva. They are architectural grotesques found on churches, castles, and other buildings, particularly in Ireland and Great Britain, sometimes together with male figures. One of the best examples may be found in the Round Tower at Rattoo, in County Kerry, Ireland. There is a replica of the round tower sheela na gig in the county museum in Tralee town. Another well-known example may be seen at Kilpeck in Herefordshire, England. Such carvings are said to ward off death and evil.Andersen, Jorgen The Witch on the Wall (1977) Rosenkilde & Bagger Weir, Anthony & Jerman, James Images of Lust: Sexual Carvings on Medieval Churches, London: B. T. Batsford Ltd, 1986 Other grotesques, such as gargoyles and hunky punks, were frequently part of church decorations all over Europe. It is commonly said that their purpose was to keep evil spirits away through the use of apotropaic magic. They often are positioned over doors or windows, presumably to protect these openings. Weir and Jerman argue that their location on churches and the grotesque features of the figures, by medieval standards, suggests that they represented female lust as hideous and sinfully corrupting. Another theory, espoused by Joanne McMahon and Jack Roberts, is that the carvings are remnants of a pre-Christian fertility or mother goddess religion.McMahon, J. & Roberts, J. The Sheela-na-Gigs of Ireland and Britain: The Divine Hag of the Christian Celts ‚Äì An Illustrated Guide, Mercier Press Ltd. (2000) A 2016 book by Starr Goode called the Sheela na gig: The Dark Goddess of Sacred Power, traces these images throughout history and contributes a discussion of the universality of \\"female sacred display\\" in it meanings and functions back to the origins of culture as seen in the Paleolithic cave art through the inclusion of the image in contemporary art, particularly feminist art. =Folklore traditions= The vagina loquens, or \\"talking vagina\\", is a significant tradition in literature and art, dating back to ancient folklore motifs. These tales usually involve vaginas talking due to the effect of magic or charms, and often admitting to their unchastity. Another folk tale concerns the vagina dentata (\\"toothed vagina\\"). The implication of these tales is that sexual intercourse might result in injury, emasculation, or castration for the man involved. These stories were frequently told as cautionary tales warning of the dangers of unknown women and to discourage rape. =Contemporary art= While Georgia O'Keeffe's paintings have been interpreted by some modern feminist artists as stylized depictions of the vulva, O'Keeffe herself consistently denied these Freudian interpretations of her paintings (pictured is \\"Blue and Green Music\\", 1921). In 1966, the French artist Niki de Saint Phalle collaborated with Dadaist artist Jean Tinguely and Per Olof Ultvedt on a large sculpture installation entitled \\"hon-en katedral\\" (also spelled \\"Hon-en-Katedrall\\", which means \\"she-a cathedral\\") for Moderna Museet, in Stockholm, Sweden. The outer form is a giant reclining sculpture of a woman with her legs spread. Museum patrons can go inside her body by entering a door-sized vaginal opening.\\"Biography - 1965-69\\", Niki de Saint Phalle Foundation, Retrieved 8 November 2014. Saint Phalle stated that the sculpture represented a fertility goddess who was able to receive visitors into her body and then \\"give birth\\" to them again. Inside her body is a screen showing Greta Garbo films, a goldfish pond and a soft drink vending machine. The piece elicited immense public reaction in magazines and newspapers throughout the world. From 1974 to 1979, Judy Chicago, a feminist artist, created the vulva-themed installation artwork \\"The Dinner Party\\". It consists of 39 elaborate place settings arranged along a triangular table for 39 mythical and historical famous women. Virginia Woolf, Susan B. Anthony, Sojourner Truth, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and Theodora of Byzantium are among those honoured. Each plate, except the one corresponding to Sojourner Truth (a Black woman), depicts a brightly-colored, elaborately styled butterfly-vulva form. After it was produced, despite resistance from the art world, it toured to 16 venues in six countries to a viewing audience of 15 million. Since 2007, it has been on permanent exhibition in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum, New York. Chicago gave Georgia O'Keeffe a prominent place in The Dinner Party, because some modern feminists believe that O'Keeffe's detailed flower paintings such as Black Iris III (1926) evoke a veiled representation of female genitalia. O'Keeffe consistently denied the validity these Freudian interpretations of her art. American Annie Sprinkle turned her genitals into performance art with her \\"Public Cervix Announcement\\", first unveiled in the early 1980s and then reprised for her 1990s touring show, \\"Post-Porn Modernist\\". In it, she lay back in a reclining chair on a low stage, inserted a speculum into her vagina, and invited members of the audience to look at her cervix. The phrase was taken up in 2018 by cancer charities in Britain and Australia asking women to take a Pap test to rule out cervical cancer. Modern artistic representation of the vagina coincides with 18th century anatomical dissection and identification of the genitalia (i.e., William Hunter). Contemporary art, from a feminist perspective, has revisited and deconstructed the androcentric view of woman genitalia and the stereotypical identification with female subjectivity (i.e., Ana Mendieta, Enrique Chagoya, Vik Muniz, Candice Lin, etc.). The Vagina Monologues, a 1996 episodic play by Eve Ensler, has contributed to making female sexuality a topic of public discourse. It is made up of a varying number of monologues read by a number of women. Initially, Ensler performed every monologue herself, with subsequent performances featuring three actresses; latter versions feature a different actress for every role. Each of the monologues deals with an aspect of the feminine experience, touching on matters such as sexual activity, love, rape, menstruation, female genital mutilation, masturbation, birth, orgasm, the various common names for the vagina, or simply as a physical aspect of the body. A recurring theme throughout the pieces is the vagina as a tool of female empowerment, and the ultimate embodiment of individuality.Ensler, Eve (2001). The Vagina Monologues: The V-Day Edition. Random House LLC. . Retrieved June 9, 2014. Jamie McCartney, based in Brighton on the south coast of England, created the Great Wall of Vagina, made from dozens of casts of real vulvas, showing widespread variation. On 22 October 2001 the television sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond, showed an episode where Marie made an abstract sculpture that many thought looked \\"inappropriate\\" While it was clear what it was meant to look like, the \\"v\\" word was never used. Aidan Salahova is an Azerbaijanian artist, gallerist and public person. In an article entitled \\"Vagina Art Veiled at Azerbaijan's Venice Biennale Pavilion, Causing Some to Cry Censorship\\", Kate Deimling stated that in 2011, Salahova's \\"Black Stone\\", a \\"sculpture depicting the black stone in Mecca venerated by Muslims within a vagina-like marble frame, were both covered up\\". She was representing the Azerbaijan Pavilion among other national artists at the 54th Venice Biennale. Two of her artworks previously approved by the ministry of culture were ordered to be covered and eventually removed from the exhibition a day before the opening, \\"because of government sensitives towards the nation's status as a secular Muslim country\\".Rob Sharp Venetian mask: Azerbaijan censors its own Biennale entry, The Independent (London), 4 June 2011.

Commenting on the conflict, the pavilion curator Beral Madra stated that the concept of the removed sculptures had been misinterpreted by the government, and added that in over 25 years of curating she had not \\"ever experienced this kind of conflict\\". In 2012, an image of an 1866 Gustave Courbet painting of the female genitals, entitled \\"The Origin of the World\\", being posted on Facebook led to a legal dispute. After a French teacher posted an image of the painting, Facebook considered the image to be pornographic and suspended his account for violating its terms of use. The Huffington Post called the painting \\"a frank image of a vagina.\\" Mark Stern of Slate, who called the painting a stunning, brilliant \\"....cornerstone of the French Realistic movement\\", states that the teacher then sued the website for allegedly violating his freedom of speech. In October 2013, artist Peter Reynosa created a \\"... red and white acrylic painting [that] depicts [pop singer] Madonna painted in the shape of a defiant yonic symbol that looks like a vagina or vulva.\\" 101 Vagina is a 2013 black- and-white photo-book by Philip Werner, with a foreword by Toni Childs. The book contains 101 close-up nude photos shot in a non-provocative way, along with an accompanying story or message written by each woman about her vagina. The book's photos and stories were exhibited five times in Australia in 2013, with a US and Canadian tour in 2014 taking in six locations. Werner was initially inspired by The Vagina Monologues and subjects were found via social media after Werner publicised his objective to create a book that had both an educational and celebratory goal. Stories accompanying the photos discuss various themes, including ageing, pregnancy, Brazilian waxing, first sexual encounter and poor body image. In Sydney the exhibition was visited by police responding to a complaint that the images were visible from the street. Images were required to be censored as part of a group exhibition at The Sydney Fringe. Lena Marquise is a Russian-born, American visual and performance artist. Her work often covers the subjects of sex work and censorship, eliciting critical response for its controversial eroticism. In 2014, at Art Basel Miami, Marquise performed in an installation artwork, \\"Body As Commodity\\", at VECTOR Gallery. In this artwork, she charged cellphones with her vagina. Musical artist Usher visited VECTOR Gallery on December 3, 2014, and he participated by charging his cell phone inside the installation. It was the top story generated during Art Basel. VECTOR Gallery is curated and operated by JJ Brine, who is an American visual artist and gallerist. He has drawn attention and critical response for his use of controversial Satanic imagery. Brine and Lena Marquise have previously collaborated on an erotic Satanic short film \\"The Visitor\\" written by Brine and performed by Marquise as the Biblical Mary where she masturbates with a knife while chanting patriarchal verses as a commentary on mass genital mutilation in Egypt. In Japan, artist Megumi Igarashi has drawn attention for her work featuring vaginas and vulvas, which she considers \\"overly hidden\\" in Japan compared to male genitalia. In July 2014, Igarashi was arrested by Japanese authorities for distributing 3D data of her vulva to contributors of her crowdsource campaign. She has also made vagina-themed sculptures. While police charged Igarashi for her vulva- and vagina-themed artworks, there are several phallus festivals in Japan in which participants parade with massive penis sculptures, a practice which is deemed acceptable by authorities. In 2015 Anish Kapoor, a Turner Prize-winning artist, created controversy with his sculpture entitled \\"Dirty Corner\\", a \\"massive steel funnel set in broken stone, placed in the garden of the...Palace of Versailles\\", which he claims is a depiction of the vagina of the former Queen of France.

She is currently the Henry Rutgers Professor of African American Studies and Creative Writing, the founding director of the New Arts Justice Initiative housed in Express Newark, and the associate director of the Clement A. Price Institute on Ethnicity, Culture, and the Modern Experience at Rutgers University--Newark. Prior, Tillet was the Robert S. Blank Presidential Associate Professor of English and Africana Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, where she was awarded the Edmund J. and Louise W. Kahn Award for Distinguished Teaching by an Assistant Professor in 2010. Tillet was also an associate fellow for the Center of African American Studies at Princeton University and the Du Bois-Mandela-Rodney Postdoctoral Fellow for the Center for Afro-American and African Studies at the University of Michigan. In 2003, Salamishah and her sister Scheherazade Tillet co-founded A Long Walk Home, a Chicago-based national non-profit that uses art to empower young people to end violence against girls and women. Tillet is also a freelance writer for culture and opinion at the New York Times.  History and Background  Salamishah Tillet was born into a politically conscious household in Boston. Inspired by the Black Power Movement, her parents, Lennox Tillet and Volora Howell, named her Salamishah, which combines ‚Äúsalaam‚Äù, an Arabic word for peace, ‚Äúmi‚Äù, her parents‚Äô interpretation of black, and ‚Äúshah‚Äù, Persian for \\"king\\", resulting in her first name becoming a literal translation of ‚Äúpeace/black/majestic‚Äù. Upon her parents‚Äô separation, Tillet lived in Boston with her mother, and then after her mother was a victim of sexual assault by a serial rapist in Boston, Tillet and her sister, Scheherazade, moved to her father‚Äôs city of Port of Spain, Trinidad in 1985 where she attended Mucurapo Girls School for primary school and St. Joseph‚Äôs Convent for secondary school. In 1988, Tillet returned back to the United States, to attend Newark Academy in Livingston, New Jersey from eighth grade to the end of high school. Throughout these years, Tillet developed a deep interest in literature and spent her extra time playing soccer and running winter and spring track. While there set school records for the 300-meter and 600-meter indoor races. After graduating high school at Newark Academy, Tillet began her undergraduate career at the University of Pennsylvania, she intended to study law. However, taking courses on topics such as jazz and literature with professors, including Professor Farah Jasmine Griffin (now the William B. Ransford Professor of English and Comparative Literature and African-American Studies at Columbia University), transformed Tillet‚Äôs trajectory and interests. Under the mentorship of Professor Griffin, Tillet began to understand the impact of work in academia. In an interview with Kathryn Levy Feldman from the Penn Gazette Tillet states, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt grow up having academics in my family‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt know you could be an English Professor, but Farah provided a lot of insight as well as a model for how I could do work that was relevant.‚Äù Along with a growing relationship with Professor Griffin and regular visits to Penn‚Äôs Van Pelt Library, Tillet declared ‚ÄúIt was at this time that I made a conscious commitment to writing my own scholarly works in accessible language and to be politically engaged.‚Äù Tillet earned a B.A. in English and African American Studies, where she was on the dean‚Äôs list and graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Pennsylvania in 1996. The following year, she earned her Masters in the Art of Teaching from Brown University in 1997. Later, she earned her A.M. in English and American Literature in 2002 and a Ph.D. in History of American Civilization program (now American Studies) in 2007 from Harvard University. At Harvard University, Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Werner Sollors co-chaired her dissertation ‚ÄúPeculiar Memories: Slavery and the Cultural Imagination.‚Äù Tillet‚Äôs childhood passion for literature, particularly in the intersection of African American studies and literature, laid a foundation for her passions for literary and cultural criticism. Her research interests include American Studies, twentieth and twenty-first-century African American cultural studies, and feminist theory. In 2007, Tillet returned to the University of Pennsylvania to join the faculty in the English Department. There her research and courses included topics in American Studies, twentieth and twenty-first African American literature, film, popular music, cultural studies, and feminist theory. More specifically Tillet taught a number of courses, including Family Feuds: Beyonce, Jay-Z, and Solange and the Meaning of American Music, No Bench By the Road: Monuments, Memory, and the Afterlife of Slavery, ‚ÄúWhere My Girls At?‚Äù: African American Women Performers in the 20th Century, Black Rage: Race, Affect, and the Politics of Feeling, and more. Tillet is now based in Newark, New Jersey, where she lives with her partner and two children. She teaches courses in creative nonfiction and African- American studies in the MFA program in the Department of English, Creative Writing and Department of African-American and African Studies at Rutgers University--Newark.  A Long Walk Home  In 2003, Salamishah and her sister, Scheherazade Tillet, co-founded A Long Walk Home, Inc. (ALWH), a Chicago-based national nonprofit that uses art to empower young people to end violence against girls and women. Through its national and local programs, Story Of A Rape Survivor (SOARS) multimedia performances and college trainings and workshops and the Girl/Friends Leadership Youth Institutes, ALWH has educated thousands of survivors and activists to build safe communities and eliminate gender violence. A Long Walk Home works with artists, students, activists, therapists, community organizations, and cultural institutions to elevate marginalized voices, facilitate healing, activate social change. Twenty years before #MeToo, A Long Walk Home emerged as a leading organization in the United States using black feminist justice approaches to combat gender violence and racism. ALWH has been the recipient of the Face History and Ourselves ‚ÄúUpstanders‚Äù Award, the Moxie Award for Excellence and Creativity from Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault, the Chicago Foundation for Women‚Äôs Impact Awards, the Bright Promise Foundation‚Äôs Ed Marciniak Bright Star Award and part of the 2nd Move to End Violence cohort‚Äîa 10-year initiative by the NoVo Foundation designed to strengthen the collective capacity to end violence against girls and women in the United States. = SOARS (Story of a Rape Survivor) = In 1997, Tillet called her younger sister, Scheherazade to tell her that she had been raped, not just once but twice in college. That next year, while enrolled in her first social documentary photography class, Scheherazade asked Salamishah if she could document Tillet‚Äôs healing journey, which included reclamation of her sexuality, spirituality, and body. Throughout her photographic journey, both Scheherazade and Salamishah discovered ways to heal Salamishah, her family, and others. By 1999, the Tillet sisters invited a cast of black women artists to bring those images to the 90-minute performance, Story of a Rape Survivor (SOARS), a collective portrait of one black woman‚Äôs surviving sexual assault. SOARS is a unique record of black women as the earliest trailblazers in ALWH‚Äôs current movement to end sexual violence against all people. Feminist icon, Gloria Steinem, describes SOARS as ‚Äúa gift that beautifully blends art, policy, and grassroots organizing to empower our most vulnerable and voiceless Americans.‚Äù Today, as millions of sexual assault victims come forward, the devastating daily impact of rape on their lives remains to be told. SOARS breaks that silence through its groundbreaking model of healing and sisterhood, and is currently being adapted into a documentary film by Yvonne Shirley. = The Girl/Friends Leadership Institute = In 2009, ALWH launched Girl/Friends, a youth-centered leadership program that amplifies the voices and creative visions of those most vulnerable to violence: girls and women of color. Created as a safety net for adolescent girls who are most vulnerable to racial and gender-based violence, Girl/Friends has been at the forefront of Chicago‚Äôs most recent campaigns to end violence against girls and young women, which includes sexual and domestic violence, crimes against queer and gender non-conforming girls, gun violence, and police brutality. For its innovative and intersectional strategy to combat gender violence, A Long Walk Home has been featured in The Chicago Reader, Chicago Tribune, The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Washington Post, on CNN, MSNBC, and NPR. ALWH has also been awarded major grants from the With and For Girls Collective and the NoVo Foundation. Salamishah and her sister, Scheherazade were finalists for Glamour‚Äôs Women of the Year Award for their work to end violence against girls and women.  New Arts Justice  New Arts Justice is an incubator within Rutgers University-Newark that is committed to feminist approaches to art‚Äôs relationship to place, social justice, and civic engagement in Newark and beyond. Inspired in name and spirit by the 1968 film ‚ÄúThe NEW-ARK,‚Äù created by poet, playwright, and activist Amiri Baraka about racial justice education, urban public theater, and political consciousness-raising in Newark, New Arts Justice keeps Newark as an artist-activist city at the core, while carefully considering its position within the university as well. Housed in Express Newark, under the directorship of Professor Salamishah Tillet, New Arts Justice is a joint partnership between the Clement A. Price Institute on Ethnicity, Culture, and Modern Experience and Express Newark that: * Curates inside/outside public art installations and exhibitions throughout the city of Newark * Supports emerging to mid-career fine artists and curators who actively practice socially-engaged art * Promotes and publishes innovative scholarly research and data collection on art and civic engagement = A Call to Peace = A Call to Peace was a public art and history exhibition co- curated by New Arts Justice and Monument Lab around a central question: What is a timely monument for Newark? The exhibition was conceived in response to Military Park‚Äôs Wars of America monument (1926), built by sculptor Gutzon Borglum. Borglum, famed for creating Mount Rushmore and designing a Confederate Monument on Stone Mountain in Georgia, was also affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan and used granite from Stone Mountain as the pedestal for his sculpture in Newark. A Call to Peace includes four temporary prototype monuments by artists Manuel Acevedo, Chakaia Booker, Sonya Clark, and Jamel Shabazz, who each responded to the exhibition‚Äôs central question. The artists‚Äô projects respectively focus on underrepresented veterans, engaging the legacies of the Confederate statues, and addressing the relationship between public spaces and historical memory. The artists were invited based on their interdisciplinary approaches to monumental work and their innovative approaches to art and social justice.  Publications  Salamishah Tillet published her first book, Sites of Slavery: Citizenship and Racial Democracy in the Post-Civil Rights Imagination (Duke University Press) in 2012. Sites of Slavery examines how contemporary African American artists and writers represent slavery as a metaphor for the ongoing feelings of exclusion and estrangement that African American citizens have in the United States. The foundation of the text initially began as an independent study project on eighteenth-century and nineteenth-century slave narratives during Tillet‚Äôs undergraduate career. Tillet says, Sites of Slavery ‚Äúcomes out of my desire to understand why contemporary African-American artists and intellectuals are so preoccupied with returning to the theme of slavery in their works and how their representations of the past help understand our racial present better.‚Äù Moore, Darryl L. and Aishah Shahidah Simmons. \\"Feminists We Love: Salamishah Tillet\\", The Feminist Wire, 15 February 2013. American literary critic, Henry Louis Gates Jr., calls Sites of Slavery ‚Äúan original contribution and a dazzling analysis of the many ways slavery lives in the contemporary imagination and colors our past, present, and future.‚Äù Valerie Smith, President of Swarthmore College, notes, ‚ÄúThis book will transform the way we think about the place of African American cultural production in relation to ‚Äòpost-civil right era‚Äô political discourse.‚Äù Tillet has also contributed to a number of scholarly journals and publications. In 2010, Tillet co-edited a Special Issue on Ethiopia, Literature, and Art for The Callaloo: A Journal of African Diaspora Arts and Letter, Volume 33. She has also produced chapters and articles including, ‚Äú‚ÄòI Got No Comfort in This Life‚Äô: The Increasing Importance of Patsey in 12 Years a Slave‚Äù, for American Literary History 26(2), ‚ÄúElle Perez: On Feminism‚Äù for Special Issue Aperture 225, and ‚Äú‚ÄòYou Want to Be Well?‚Äô: Self-Care as a Black Feminist Intervention in Art Therapy‚Äù in Art Therapy for Social Justice: Radical Intersections. Tillet has also written the liner notes, ‚ÄúNina Simone: The Voice of a People‚Äù, for Nina Simone Sings the Blues and ‚ÄúFreedom Then, Freedom Now‚Äù for Wake Up! by John Legend and the Roots.

Board, and The Fate of Black Girlhood‚Äù at Loyola University. She has co-organized a number of projects and conferences including The Continuum Violence Project, an incubator for policyholders, activists, and academics who work on ending violence--gun control, community and gang violence, and gender-based violence, with the NoVo Foundation and Black Girl Movement: A National Conference, a three-day gathering to focus on the experiences and realities of all Black girls, cis, queer, and trans, in the United States, at Columbia University.

Though the band never obtained national success, they made a huge splash in Southern California with their song \\"Falling Sugar\\". The group is also notable for featuring the first commercial appearance of Emitt Rhodes, later a member of the Merry-Go-Round. History The foundation of the Palace Guard was set in early 1964 with the formation of the Emerals in Los Angeles. (The Emerals are sometimes incorrectly noted as the Emeralds; however, The Emerals chose their name after deciding it sounded more \\"exclusive\\" than \\"Emeralds.\\") Several members of the Emerals left the band after a contract dispute, including drummer Emitt Rhodes. However, Rhodes then had a change of heart, reconciling with some of his former Emerals bandmates and rechristening themselves the Palace Guard. The earliest lineup consisted of Rhodes, Rick Moser (bass guitar), Mike Conley (rhythm guitar), Chuck McClung (piano), and brothers David (tambourine, vocals), John (tambourine, vocals), and Don Beaudoin (lead guitar). For a brief period, the band also featured actor Don Grady‚Äîcontributing vocals, keyboards, and drums‚Äîof My Three Sons fame, who went on to become a member of the sunshine pop band the Yellow Balloon. Grady stayed with the Palace Guard to record one obscure single, \\"Little People\\", in early 1965, which was credited to Don Grady and the Palace Guard. The band was known for their style of dress, clothing themselves in military-themed red coats, as if they were members of the Queen's Guard. After months of rehearsal, the Palace Guard's big break came when KRLA deejay Casey Kasem invited the group to perform on his local television dance show Shebang. In mid-1965, the group began an extended residency at the Hullabaloo club, on Sunset Boulevard, earning popularity as a need-to-see attraction in Los Angeles. Two singles followed on the Orange-Empire record label, before the group scored a regional hit with \\"Falling Sugar\\" in early 1966, described by music historian Lenny Kaye as \\"a catchy Moptop-ish toe tapper brimming with youthful fervor\\". Indeed, \\"Falling Sugar\\", like most of their material derived from a blend of folk rock and the harmonic sound of the Beatles. Rhodes began to have larger ambitions, both as a songwriter and to become a guitarist, leading him to depart the band to form the Merry-Go-Round and reaching number 63 on the Billboard Hot 100 with his song \\"Live\\". His replacement Terry Rae, formerly of the Driftones, an early version of the Yellow Payges, recalls in an interview that prior to leaving Rhodes \\"used to bring up his acoustic guitar and sing \\"Yesterday\\" at the Hullabaloo while he was with The Guard. I think this gave him the inspiration to play guitar full time, and to do only his material\\". After Rhodes' departure, the Palace Guard signed to Cameo- Parkway Records, releasing \\"Greed\\" and \\"Saturday's Children\\". However, with no national distribution in sight for the group, they decided to disband in mid-1970. Since their disbandment, the Palace Guard's songs have been compiled on several compilation albums, including the Nuggets albums Nuggets Volume Four: Pop Part Two, the 1998 expanded box-set reissue of Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965‚Äì1968, and Where the Action Is! Los Angeles Nuggets 1965‚Äì1968. On February 23, 2003, Gear-Fab Records released all of the band's recorded material on The Palace Guard album.

He was a firm believer in the republican form of government, and sat with the center left, but on topics such as religion held conservative views. Early years (1816‚Äì48) Edmond Edouard Ernest Victor Toupet des Vignes was born on 5 September 1816 in Givet, Ardennes. He studied at the Coll√®ge Charlemagne, where he was a brilliant student, but did not continue as planned to the √âcole Polytechnique. He returned to his home town where he became a member of the liberal opposition to the government of Louis Philippe I. Second French Republic and Empire (1848‚Äì70) Toupet des Vignes commanded the National Guard of Givet during the revolution of February 1848. On 23 April 1848 he was elected to the Constituent Assembly as representative for the Ardennes. In his election campaign he demanded free and compulsory education, improvement of the lot of workers through progressive organization of work, and full liberty of association. He said \\"I was a republican before the glorious February revolution, I am a republican today, I will be a republican tomorrow. Toupet des Vignes joined the committee on Algeria in the Assembly. He voted with the moderate republicans, and was in favor of banishing the Orleans family. He was against the proposal for two chambers, the Rateau motion and the expedition to Rome. On 13 May 1849 he was reelected for the Ardennes to the Legislative Assembly. Toupet des Vignes retired to private life after the coup of 2 December 1851. He was general councilor of his department from 1848 to 1870. This was the only public function he would accept under the Second French Empire. Toupet des Vignes ran for election to parliament on 1 June 1863 as an opposition candidate, but was defeated. Third French Republic (1871‚Äì82) On 8 February 1871 Toupet des Vignes was elected representative of the Ardennes in the National Assembly, and took his seat with the Centre gauche parliamentary group. On several occasions he voted with the Right. On 14 June 1871 he seconded the motion by Louis Blanc that members of the government of national defense should have to account for the way in which they had exercised power during the Siege of Paris. He remained committed to the republican form of government. He was opposed to reintroduction of the monarchy, but on several occasions voted with the monarchists, particularly on questions of religion. He was in favor of public prayers and of rescinding the laws of exile and allowing the return to Paris of the royal family. Toupet des Vignes was reelected councilor general for the canton of Givet on 8 October 1871. He was elected senator for the Ardennes on 30 January 1876, and again sat with the Center Left.

Life Lill was born 20 October 1830 in Br√ºx (Bohemia). From 1848 to 1849 he studied mathematics at the Czech Technical University in Prague and in 1850 he joined the military engineering corps of the Austrian Empire. From 1852 to 1856 he continued his education at the military engineering academy at Klosterbruck near Znaim. Later he was stationed in Esseg, Kronstadt and Spalato until he retired from his military career in 1868 with the rank of captain (Hauptmann) of the engineering corps. In the same year he became an engineer for the Austrian Northwestern Railway and oversaw the railroad construction at Trautenau (Trutnov). A severe accident however restricted him soon to office work. From 1872-1875 he worked as a secretary for the director of construction of the railway company. Later he became a technical consultant for company's headquarters and in 1885 the head of its statistics department. He retired in 1894 with the title of a chief inspector.Lill, Eduard. In √ñsterreichisches Biographisches Lexikon 1815‚Äì1950 Work Lill is best remembered for a contribution in mathematics, and his traffic and transportation research. In mathematics he devised a graphical procedure to determine the roots of polynomials, which in essence is a representation of Horner's scheme. He published his invention in 1867 in the French journal Nouvelles Annales de Math√©matiques, and Charles Hermite provided a description of it for the Comptes rendus of the same year. Later it became known as Lill's method. Dan Kalman: Uncommon Mathematical Excursions: Polynomia and Related Realms.

Considered an original and eloquent poet, he won the praises of his contemporaries and later Turkish writers, securing for himself an important place in Turkish literary history. Life Not much is known on his origin and youth. It is agreed that he was born a slave in Edirne. His names ƒ∞sa (Jesus) and Necati (who escaped from danger / found refuge) indicate a non- Muslim and non-Turkish ancestry, although contemporary biographers (tezkire writers) do not mention it. It seems that he made his name already in Edirne and managed to purchase his freedom. At a young age he went to Kastamonu where he developed his skill in calligraphy and poetry. Around 1480, he went to Constantinople, where he wrote poetry for Sultan Mehmed II and made powerful friends. In one story, one of the Sultan's companions with the name Yurgi or Chiyurgi, said by some to have been a Greek from Trabzond, took some of Necati's ghazels with him when he went to play chess with the Sultan. The introduction was crucial; the Sultan was pleased with Necati's work and appointed him katib in the Ottoman Imperial Council. After the accession of Sultan Bayezid II in 1481, Necati briefly entered the service of one of his sovereign‚Äôs sons, Prince Abdullah. Together with his friend Sehi Bey, he served as katib (secretary) to Prince ≈ûehzade Mahmud, son of Bayezid II. After the death of Prince Mahmud (1507 or 1508), Necati refused any further appointments and lived in retirement in Constantinople until his death on 17 March 1509. Poetry He was considered by contemporary and later bibliographers to be one of the greatest of his epoch. Apart from a few scattered lines from the many pieces attributed to Necati, the only extant work is his Dƒ´vƒÅn (\\"Collection of Poems\\"), in which there are numerous examples of his graceful and refined verse.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica ƒ∞sa Necati His G√ºl Kas√Ædesi (Rose Qasida) is one of the only eight qasidas dedicated to Bayezid II, but the occasion is unknown, though it should have come during the early Bayezid reign. It is a Bahaariye, or spring qasida. Necati is considered less influenced by Persian literature than other poets before him.

She was also the first woman to earn a doctorate in botany from the University of Chicago. She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1985. Early life and education Hazel Marguerite Schmoll was born in a sod cabin in McAllaster, Kansas, on August 23, 1890, to William and Amelia Schmoll. The family moved to Ward, Colorado when she was two, where her father set up a livery stable. Schmoll showed an early interest in learning about wildflowers and spent much time roaming the area on horseback collecting specimens and picking berries. She described her childhood in Ward as ideal and retained a lifelong connection to the town, which shrank to less than a dozen residents in the 1940s before rebounding in the 1960s. Schmoll attended Ward School through eighth grade, followed by the State Preparatory School in Boulder (an earlier incarnation of Boulder High School). She then went to the University of Colorado, from which she graduated in 1913 with a degree in biology. She taught for four years (1913‚Äì1917) at Vassar College, first in the biology department and then in the botany department. She was the first University of Colorado graduate to be hired by Vassar. Coming from the state that had been the first to grant women the vote, she was active in promoting the cause of women's suffrage on campus. Discovering that she would need an advanced degree if she wished to continue teaching at Vassar, she enrolled at the University of Chicago to get a master's degree in botany. She studied mainly with botanist and ecological pioneer Henry Chandler Cowles and received her degree in 1919. Career On returning to Colorado after her master's degree, Schmoll was hired to do some work for the Colorado Historical and Natural History Society at the Colorado State Museum, at first mainly mounting and cataloguing the botanical collections of Alice Eastwood and Ellsworth Bethel. The resulting herbarium is still considered one of the finest in the state. She went on to conduct the first systematic study of plant life in the southwestern part of the state, a project that would later feed into her doctoral dissertation. Another of her roles was to educate the public about plant life in the Rocky Mountains, and she served briefly (1920‚Äì21) as assistant curator for the State Bureau of Mines. In 1925, she was a leading lobbyist for efforts to pass legislation protecting the state flower, Aquilegia coerulea or blue columbine. A job which Schmoll had expected to be short-term ended up lasting until 1925, when Scholl left with the goal of pursuing a doctoral degree. In late 1925, Schmoll traveled to Europe to visit botanical gardens and learn German. On returning, she enrolled at the University of Chicago for a Ph.D. in ecological botany, supporting herself with various jobs ranging from cleaning houses to rewriting a high school biology textbook. She also worked at the Field Museum of Natural History and served as a substitute professor at a local junior college. In 1932 she became the first woman to obtain a Ph.D. in botany from the University of Chicago. The subject of her dissertation was vegetation of the Chimney Rock area of southwestern Colorado. During the Depression, Schmoll was unable to find a permanent job as a scientist. In 1938, she built Rangeview Ranch outside Ward, first as a children's camp and then as a guest ranch. It adjoined Rocky Mountain National Park, and Schmoll served as a nature guide for guests well into her seventies. Schmoll split her time between the ranch in the summers and a house in Ward the rest of the year. Schmoll died on January 31, 1990, at the age of 99. Much of her property was donated for conservation purposes, although Rangeview Ranch was donated to the Christian Science Church for use as a retreat and conference center. In 2017, the ranch changed hands again and became the Rocky Mountain Ecodharma Retreat Center. Legacy and honors In Schmoll's honor, the University of Colorado, Boulder, has established the Hazel Schmoll Research Fellowship in Colorado Botany emphasizing field botany and open to faculty, staff, and students. A rare and imperiled species of milkvetch (also known as locoweed), Astragalus schmolliae or Schmoll's milkvetch, is named after Schmoll. It grows only on Chapin Mesa in Mesa Verde National Park, where it was first collected by Alice Eastwood in 1890 and where Schmoll and an assistant reported it for the second time in 1925. It was not described until 1945, at which time it was named after Schmoll. Schmoll's extensive notebooks are in the archives of the Boulder Historical Society.

Although there are many variations of the legend, most say the Gray Man was first seen in 1822, three years before the town government was incorporated. The last reported sighting was just before Hurricane Florence hit in 2018, and previously just before Hurricane Hugo hit the area in 1989. History and legend Legend holds that the Gray Man is the ghost of a young man traveling from Charleston to see his fianc√©e. On the way, he and his horse were caught in quicksand-like pluff mud in the marshes before Pawley's Island, and died. His spirit has haunted the shore nearby ever since, looking for the girl he loved. Some stories have conflicted on his identity, but some ideas include: * Percival Pawley, the island's namesake * Plowden Charles Jeannerette Weston, an early resident who owned the home that is now Pelican Inn * Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard Charles Joyner says the legend appears to originate from a book of ghost stories by Julian Stevenson Bolick, published in 1956. The Gray Man got national attention just after Hurricane Hugo when residents Jim and Clara Moore were interviewed on the television show Unsolved Mysteries. They told their story about seeing the man on the beach and how he disappeared when they waved. Their house was spared in the storm while the homes of their neighbors were heavily damaged. Others who have encountered the spirit have credited him with saving them or their homes. Either they have come ashore or left the area and returned to find their homes and belongings unscathed by severe storms. He has been described as a man wearing gray clothing, a long coat, dressed \\"like a pirate,\\" and sometimes as having no legs. Popular culture The Weather Channel aired a series in 2014, American Supernatural, that featured the Gray Man of Pawley's Island.

Plot   Reception  \\"This Renaissance fantasy uses wind machines, conveyor belts, masks, duck-shape codpieces, occasional tomtom accompaniment and a bear's cage decorated with origami birds. It also employs an abundance of mime, which is a good many people's least favorite performing art. This arsenal of tactics is all in the service of the tale of a returning young Hungarian King who has Italian friends, Turkish enemies and an alleged 'mother,' who looks younger than he. What is her secret? She is suspected of sacrificing a different young woman each day so as to maintain her looks. Quite a beauty secret. 'The Tyrant's Heart,' which has as much the feeling of a sideshow as of the tone poem Mr. Jancso apparently intends, has become almost unbearably precious well before one character turns to the camera and says, of another player, 'He's only an actor; don't kill him.'

The restaurant is located in a former 19th century townhouse.

The algorithm will assign an entire block of data an exponent, rather than single units themselves being assigned an exponent, thus making them a block, rather than a simple floating point. Block floating-point algorithm operations are done through a block using a common exponent, and can be advantageous to limit the space use in the hardware to perform the same functions as floating-point algorithms. The common exponent is found by data with the largest amplitude in the block. To find the value of the exponent, the number of leading zeros must be found (count leading zeros). For this to be done, the number of left shifts needed for the data must be normalized to the dynamic range of the processor used. Some processors have means to find this out themselves, such as exponent detection and normalization instructions. Block floating-point algorithms were extensively studied by James Hardy Wilkinson. A similar arithmetic can be used on top of a floating-point format having a limited range.

Customs at Port Adelaide. Early life Hawker was born in Catsfield, England. He was a son of Admiral Edward Hawker, R.N. After an educational career in French, Swiss, and Italian academies, his education was completed at the High School in Tavistock Square, London. He had two brothers, George Charles Hawker and Charles Hawker, with both of whom he settled in Australia in 1841. Australia Hawker sailed to South Australia in 1838 with George Gawler, who was an old friend of his father, and who was to succeed Captain Hindmarsh, R.N., the first viceregal representative in the colony. Gawler had made an offer to Hawker's father to take one of his sons to South Australia with him when he took up his new post. They arrived in Port Adelaide, described as a \\"wretched mudhole\\", in October. There he met harbormaster (and his future father-in-law) Capt. Thomas Lipson, R.N., accompanied the new Governor on his official entry into the city, and witnessed the swearing-in at the viceregal residence. In December 1838, Hawker joined the party which conducted a survey on the Sturt River, led by J. W. McLaren who became Deputy Surveyor-General of South Australia. Hawker was the fourth officer in that party, and subsequently led a survey party on the Onkaparinga River. Among the officers was draftsman John McDouall Stuart, later noted as an explorer. Hawker executed surveys in other parts of the colony, before resigning and returning to Government House to assist in the Private Secretary's office. He was present at the public dinner given to Colonel Gawler in 1840, and later in that same year he left for England in the ship Katherine Stewart Forbes. Finding that his two brothers, George and Charles, had themselves only just left for Australia, Hawker returned almost immediately to join them, sailing on the barque Siam. Leaving England in December 1840, he arrived back at Holdfast Bay in South Australia on 25 April 1841. Within ten days of arriving, Hawker had volunteered to accompany a party which went out to retrieve 5,000 sheep left near Chowilla by overlanders Henry Inman (his future brother in law), Henry Field and nine others after being attacked by local Aboriginal people. One attacker was shot dead before Inman, Field and the other overlanders escaped, the fate of the sheep unknown. The retrieval party found themselves opposed by about 300 warriors, and fired at the attackers, killing eight, and wounding several more before they retreated. They returned without the sheep, Field slightly wounded, and his horse badly speared.\\"Despatch from Governor Grey to Lord John Russell (May 29, 1841)\\", Accounts and Papers 1843, Volume 3 (London: William Clowes and Sons), p. 267-272. [This includes a letter co-signed by Hawker, p.269.] Hawker subsequently went out as commissary under command of Police Commissioner O'Halloran, their force succeeding in protecting other settlers who had been attacked and in retrieving their animals. Hawker soon settled down with his two brothers, and all three engaged in sheep-farming, initially at Mount Dispersion, near Anlaby Station, north of Nuriootpa. On 22 December 1841 he discovered a permanent water supply in the Mid-North of South Australia at Bungaree, which was improved by sinking a well, and transferred his stock there. In 1843, James Hawker sold his share in the Bungaree Station to his brother George, and relocated to Moorundie on the River Murray. He, along with E. J. Eyre (explorer and later Governor of Jamaica) plus E. B. Scott (one-time superintendent of Yatala Labour Prison) were the first three settlers on the Murray. However, his speculation proved unsuccessful, in 1847 Hawker took up a post with H.M. Customs at Port Adelaide, becoming tide surveyor and eventually comptroller in 1862. In 1860 Hawker founded Port Adelaide's first rowing club, called the \\"Pelican Club\\", of which he was captain and an oarsman for many years. Their Patron was Lady MacDonnell, whose name graced one of their two boats. Diaries and publications Hawker compiled diaries over much of his life, originally publishing them as articles that appeared in the South Australian Register and the Adelaide Observer. He subsequently published them in two books: * Early Experiences in South Australia (1899), Adelaide: E.S. Wigg and Son. * Early Experiences in South Australia, Second Series (1901), Adelaide: E.S. Wigg and Son. The 1899 series gave detailed accounts of his journey to Australia on board the Pestonjee Bomanjee, his years there, the many acquaintances he met, including assisting the renowned ornithologist John Gould during his studies in 1839, and of his return to England on board the Katherine Stewart Forbes. The second series recounted his experiences for the years immediately after his return to Australia in 1842, including the establishment of the Bungaree station. Family and later life On 24 October 1850 at Trinity Church, Adelaide, Hawker married Louisa Lipson (1829 ‚Äì 5 August 1918), youngest daughter of Capt. Lipson R.N., Harbourmaster at Port Adelaide. In August 1872, Hawker retired from the customs branch, and went into private commercial life, establishing the business of land and station agency and surveyor. He also became a respected Freemason. At the time of his death in 1901, his business was continuing under the name of James C. Hawker & Son. In his later years Hawker lived a quiet life at Strangways-terrace, North Adelaide. He died on 15 October 1901 and was buried at North Road Cemetery. He left a widow, three sons, and five daughters.

Lee was forced to serve as a sex slave during World War II with the Imperial Japanese Army. She is one of the youngest comfort women still living.  Biography  Lee Yong-soo was born in Daegu, South Korea on December 13, 1928. Lee was sixteen when she was forced to become a comfort woman. She was outside near a riverbank, catching snails with her friend Bunsun, when both were captured by a military man. She and her friend were taken by train, and then switched to a boat at Anju. On the boat, which was headed to a Kamikaze Unit in Hsinchu County, Taiwan, she was raped for the first time. She recalls that on average, she was forced into sexual relations with four to five men a day and did not have any rest even when she was menstruating. She also says that she \\"suffered electrical torture, was beaten and was cut by a soldier's knife.\\" She learned quickly to submit so that she would not be shocked or beaten again. Lee says that she never thought to run away because she did not know how to leave the area even if she did escape. Additionally, she was isolated from the other comfort women in her area. After the war and her return home, she said that her family no longer recognized her and she did not feel fit to get married. She was ashamed of what happened to her, and did not realize that it had also happened to so many other women. Lee first came forward to testify about her experience as a comfort woman in June 1992. She was influenced by Kim Hak-sun's press conference on TV to finally talk to others. Yong-soo registered with the Korean government as a comfort woman. She was the twenty-ninth woman to testify about her experiences. Coming forward gave her life a true purpose: \\"I thought I was worthless. I didn't talk about it, and nobody asked me. Until the women came out, I did not exist.\\" In 1996, Lee attended Kyungpook National University and eventually received her master's degree in 2001. At the Women's International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan's Military Sexual Slavery held in Tokyo in 2000, she testified about what happened to her during World War II, and then later shared her story at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. In 2007, she testified in front of the United States joint Congressional session about her experiences during World War II. She said, \\"I am an honorable daughter of Korea, I am not a comfort woman.\\" Her experience at the hands of the Japanese Army was described as \\"traumatic.\\" After her testimony, the Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, came out and denied that Japan was culpable and that a former apology from Japan's cabinet in 1993 was not necessary. Nevertheless, the outcome of her testimony (along with the testimony of two other comfort women) led to the House passing a resolution which asked the Japanese government to apologize formally to former comfort women. The resolution was passed unanimously. Right-wing elements in the Japanese government have been trying to erase the history of comfort woman from the record. This is what Yong-soo and others are fighting against. In 2014, Lee Yong-soo met with Pope Francis. As a devout Catholic, she hoped that the Pope could help end their pain. In 2015, she attended the South Korean National Assembly's exhibition of art created by former comfort women. Later, she traveled to San Francisco to receive a commendation award from city council and also to ask the city to install a memorial to former comfort women. She was a guest of California Representative Mike Honda in 2015. Yong-soo also participated in protests in the United States when Prime Minister Abe visited. Lee Yong-soo continues to participate in weekly demonstrations held on Wednesdays in front of the Japanese Embassy. She always wears a traditional Korean hanbok, including the dongjeong, beoseon and gomusin so that everyone who sees her knows that \\"I am a Joseon daughter. I am an honorable Korean.\\" She says, \\"I don't want to advertise that I am a comfort women victim. Rather, I want to be a problem solver that can ensure that there will be no other victims of war such as us.\\" She says that she will not give up until Prime Minister Abe acknowledges the truth of her and other women's testimonies. In May 2020, Lee accused the Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance and Yoon Mee-hyang, the former head, of misusing funds and embezzlement. As a result, Lee said she would no longer attend the Wednesday demonstrations and called for Yoon Mee-hyang resign from becoming a member of the National Assembly. However, on May 27, Lee made a surprise appearance at one of the Wednesday demostrations in Daegu.

Tsin-is-tum, also known as Jennie Michel, (c. 1814‚Äì1905, Clatsop), was a Native American folklorist based on the Pacific Coast of Oregon. Called \\"Last of the Clatsops\\" at the time of her death in 1905, Tsin-is-tum was much photographed. She provided oral history for scholars of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Among her accounts was of family members who interacted with members of the Lewis and Clark expedition in the winter of 1805-1806; she helped historians to locate salt works they had used. Biography Tsin-is-tum (known to some during her lifetime as \\"Jennie Michel\\") was a Clatsop woman born about 1814 to a family on the coast of what is today part of the American state of Oregon.Tsin-is- tum's year of birth has been variously reported. The best estimate seems to be that of Chairman L.B. Cox of the Committee on Memorials of the Oregon Historical Society, who noted that Tsin-is-tum was \\"said to be about 86 years of age\\" at the time of the visit of his committee to the site of salt cairns of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Tsin-is-tum had been invited as an expert witness. See: L.B. Cox, \\"Appendix A,\\" Proceedings of the Oregon Historical Society, Including the Quarterly Meetings of the Board of Directors, and the Second Annual Meeting of the Members of the Society, Held December 15, 1900. Salem, OR: W.H. Leeds, State Printer, 1901; pg. 16. She was the daughter of a woman named Wah-ne-ask, who was an eyewitness of the Lewis and Clark Expedition that visited the Pacific Northwest in 1805 and 1806.Tsin-is-tum, \\"Testimony of Tsin-is-tum to the Oregon Historical Society,\\" in Proceedings of the Oregon Historical Society, Including the Quarterly Meetings of the Board of Directors, and the Second Annual Meeting of the Members of the Society, Held December 15, 1900.

He was killed in a bombardment of her village by a warship, probably in the spring 1829.Cain Allen, \\"Tsin-is-tum (Jennie Michel),\\" The Oregon History Project, Oregon Historical Society, 2004. Tsin-is-tum was recognized by historians associated with the Oregon Historical Society as a source of folklore of the Clatsop people, as well as oral history of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. She had family members who had engaged with the Anglo-America explorers during their 1805-1806 sojourn on the northwest coast of today's state of Oregon. In addition to her mother's recollections, Tsin-is-tum learned from her uncle Ka- ta-ta about his experiences of hunting elk with the explorers. At the time of contact with Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, and their associates, the total population of the Clatsop people had plummeted to as few as 200 people, in the estimation of the Anglo-America visitors. They had suffered high mortality in the late 18th century due to new infectious diseases introduced into the population through contact with outsiders. Postcard with image of \\"Princess Jennie and Princess Chloe, The Last of the Clatsop Tribe\\". Tsin-is-tum married the last chief of the Nehalem people, Wah-tat-kum. The couple lived along the Oregon coast between the outlets of the Columbia and Nehalem rivers until his death. She later married again, this time to Michel Martineaux (also written as \\"Michelle Martineau\\"), a man of French Canadian descent and a retired steam-boat captain and sailing master. Her alternative name, Jennie Michel was derived from this relationship. The couple lived in the area of Seaside, Oregon. In June 1900, Tsin-is-tum provided a statement to a committee of the Oregon Historical Society. She described the story of her life and helped identify the location of salt works used by the Lewis and Clark party during their stay in Oregon in the winter of 1805-1806. At the time, she was believed to be one of the last three surviving full-blooded Clatsops.L.B.

She was one of seven children; her father died during World War II. She attended elementary school at Bogo Central School and high school at Cebu Roosevelt Memorial College in Bogo. She earned her BS in Elementary Education from the Cebu Normal College. She graduated from the University of the Visayas College of Law in 1976 and was admitted to the Philippine Bar in April 1977. In 1978 Geonzon was appointed the legal aid director for the Cebu City Chapter of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines. Through her work she confronted abuses of the legal system that took place during the martial law of Ferdinand Marcos. Adults and children were incarcerated without being charged, imprisoned longer than their sentences, and subject to inhumane treatment. In one incident in March 1979 she met with 39 minors in the Cebu City Jail who were being held beyond their sentences, some for three years even though their initial sentence did not even require imprisonment. The jail offered no rehabilitation services, so Geonzon organized opportunities for minors to participate in boy scouting activities and earn certificates for good behavior. She also organized a civic assistance team to provide basic needs for prisoners who lacked basic necessities such as mats or clothing. Rehabilitation activities supported by the organization included literary classes, sports activities, cultural programs, and a spiritual ministry. She visited the Bagong Buhay Rehabilitation Center at Apas as well as other prisons. Geonzon founded the non-profit, non-religious organization Free Legal Assistance Volunteers Association (Free LAVA) in 1983 to provide legal aid for prisoners who were victims of human rights violations. Free LAVA has a program of crime prevention, legal aid, and rehabilitation. Its volunteers visited prisons and gathered legal evidence for wrongly-imprisoned inmates. By 1987 the umbrella organization involved the collaboration of 26 community groups. Geonzon was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in 1984 for \\"giving assistance to prisoners and aiding their rehabilitation.\\" Geonzon died of cancer on July 25, 1990.

Although the ground was built for Celtic, the opening match at the stadium on 8 May 1888 was between the Edinburgh-based Hibernian and Glasgow club Cowlairs, a game that ended in a 0‚Äì0 draw with a crowd of 3,000 present. Hibernian had agreed to play the opening match in order to fulfil a promise that the club's founder and manager Canon Edward Joseph Hannan had made to Brother Walfrid; however, Celtic did benefit from the gate receipts.The Birth of Celtic Hibernian FC Celtic's first match at the ground was played on 28 May 1888 against Rangers, with the home side winning 5‚Äì2 in front of almost 2,000 spectators.The men who kicked it all off for the Celts Celtic FC In 1890 Celtic were founder members of the Scottish Football League (SFL).

Formed in 2014 during the Syrian Civil War, the majority of the volunteers' activity in Syria consists of medical evacuation, urban search and rescue in response to bombing, evacuation of civilians from danger areas, and essential service delivery. As of April 2018, the organisation said it had saved over 114,000 lives, with 204 White Helmet volunteers losing their lives in the process. They assert their impartiality in the Syrian conflict. The White Helmets are considered a terrorist group by Iran, Russia and Syria. The organisation has been the target of a sustained disinformation campaign by supporters of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and Russian state-sponsored media organisations such as RT and Sputnik; the campaign has promoted false accusations connecting it with terrorist activities and other conspiracy theories. The organisation has also been criticized by the Iranian news agency MNA\\"The White Helmet myth: A soft war propaganda\\". Mehr News Agency. 11 March 2018. and Chinese state news agency Xinhua. The White Helmets were also banned from entering Kurdish-controlled areas of Syria. History The rescue teams that later became Syria Civil Defence emerged during the late 2012 escalation of the Syrian Civil War, as areas no longer under the control of the Assad government came under sustained attack from its military forces. In response, in the absence of formal governmental structures, small groups of civilian volunteers from affected communities, particularly in Aleppo and Idlib, assembled to assist civilians injured in bombardment or trapped under the rubble of destroyed buildings. Training, funding and support was provided from international partners, including donations from governments in Western Europe, the US and Japan; the Turkish AKUT Search and Rescue Association; and a combination of NGOs, private individuals, public fundraising campaigns, and charities. Primary support and training was provided by Mayday Rescue Foundation, a not-for-profit foundation established by former British Army officer James Le Mesurier,\\"Order of the British Empire\\" The London Gazette ‚Äì Official Public Record. 11 June 2016. ‚Äî \\"The Queen has been graciously pleased, on the occasion of the Celebration of Her Majesty's Birthday, to give orders for the following promotions in, and appointments to the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire: O.B.E. To be Ordinary Officers of the Civil Division of the said Most Excellent Order: James Gustaf Edward LE MESURIER, Director, Mayday Rescue, For services to Syria Civil Defence and the protection of civilians in Syria.\\" and became a key factor in the development of the organisation. Local and provincial councils joined with Mayday Rescue Foundation and AKUT Search and Rescue Association to create the first training programmes in early 2013. ARK, an international contracting firm based in the United Arab Emirates, would facilitate entry of volunteers to Turkey, where they would be trained by AKUT. Early training courses included trauma care, command and control and crisis management. Over the next two years, the number of independent civil defence teams grew to several dozen as graduates of the early trainings such as Raed Saleh established new centers; the national organisation of SCD was founded on 25 October 2014 at a conference of independent teams. SCD grew to be an organisation of over 3,000 volunteers operating from 111 local civil defence centres across 8 provincial directorates (Aleppo, Idlib, Latakia, Hama, Homs, Damascus, Damascus Countryside, and Daraa) in 2016. In October 2014, these self-organised teams came together and voted to form one national organisation: Syria Civil Defence. As of January 2017, the SCD claims to have rescued over 80,000 people since they began to keep count in 2014. The White Helmets themselves have become targets of Syrian and Russian airstrikes. According to The Economist, approximately one in six SCD have been killed or badly wounded, \\"many by 'double tap' Russian and Syrian airstrikes on the same site as they search for bodies.\\" Seven members were killed in August 2017 in an apparent assassination at their operations centre in Sarmin in Idlib Province. Although SCD has existed since 2013, their worldwide acknowledgement in media started in late 2014 with the help of The Syria Campaign NGO, which introduced the nickname \\"White Helmets\\".\\"Meet Syria's Peacemakers: Fighting on the Side of Life\\", The Syria Campaign, Youtube, 13 January 2015 On 14 December 2016, as the Syrian Armed Forces were recapturing eastern Aleppo, SCD head Raed Saleh requested safe passage of SCD operatives to rebel controlled countryside around Aleppo. Syria Civil Defence joined the Independent Doctors Association, the Syrian Network for Human Rights, and the Violations Documentation Center to accuse Russian forces of war crimes in eastern Aleppo, jointly submitting a report to the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic. In May 2018, the US State Department announced that funding has been frozen for the White Helmets. A State Department official indicated that they were reviewing assistance programs in Syria overall, which included funding for the White Helmets, and at the same time indicated that the United States would continue to support the White Helmets through multilateral donations. The chairman of the White Helmets stated that the government of the United States, and other supportive institutions, promised to continue to provide critical funding to the organization. On the night of 21 July 2018, Israel opened the Golan Heights boundary to allow a UN rescue mission to evacuate 422 people ‚Äì 98 White Helmet volunteers and their family members ‚Äì to Jordan. An international group led by Chrystia Freeland lobbied for the exit of the White Helmets, as their lives were in danger due to the Syrian government‚Ä≤s advancing offensive in southwestern Syria. The White Helmets reported 3,700 of their volunteers remained in Syria. A Syrian government official condemned the evacuation of White Helmets as a \\"criminal operation\\" that had revealed \\"the terrorist nature\\" of the group. President Bashar al-Assad said: \\"They have two choices: to lay down their arms and use the amnesty we have offered over the last four or five years, or be killed like other terrorists.\\" In September 2018, the United Kingdom granted asylum to about 100 White Helmet staff and relatives that had been evacuated to Jordan. The co-founder of the White Helmets, James Le Mesurier, was found dead in Istanbul on 9 November 2019. Operations SCD clearing rubble following an attack in Maarat al-Nu'man in November 2014, using a USAID-supplied bucket loader SCD's stated mission is \\"to save the greatest number of lives in the shortest possible time and to minimize further injury to people and damage to property.\\" Their work covers the 15 civil defence tasks as laid out in international humanitarian law (IHL); the bulk of their activity in Syria consists of urban search and rescue in response to bombing, medical evacuation, evacuation of civilians from danger areas, and essential service delivery. The most prominent role of SCD was rescuing civilians from airstrikes with barrel bombs, improvised explosive devices dropped by SAAF helicopters. Following a request from Bashar al-Assad for support, Russia intervened in the Syrian Civil War on 30 September 2015. Much of the work of SCD has been in response to aerial bombardments by the Russian Air Force attack aircraft. As well as providing rescue services, SCD undertakes repair works such as securing damaged buildings and reconnecting electrical and water services, clearing roads, teaching children about hazards from unexploded ordnance, as well as firefighting and winter storm relief. Sometimes described as the most dangerous job in the world, SCD operations involve risk from being active in a war-zone. By late 2016, 159 White Helmets had been killed since the organisation's inception. SCD is not affiliated with the International Civil Defence Organisation (ICDO), nor is it connected to the Damascus's Syrian Civil Defence Forces (SCDF), an ICDO-member since 1972. But, since the SCDF operate in government-held areas and since civilian casualties in Syria overwhelmingly result from government forces' bombardments against targets in opposition-held areas, the unaffiliated SCD engages in civil defence tasks in said rebel-held areas. In 2015, the SCD unsuccessfully lobbied the European Union (EU) and governments to impose a no fly zone over certain parts of Syria to protect civilians from airstrikes. The White Helmets have unsuccessfully called upon governments such as France to act to effect a ceasefire and protect lives in subsequent years. As of 2015, SCD had an annual budget of $30 million provided by a mix of state donors and public fundraising. Volunteers who work full-time receive a $150 monthly stipend. It has a co-ordination office on the Turkish-Syrian border in Gaziantep and a training centre in Turkey. As of April 2017, there were about 3,000 White Helmet members, about 100 of which were women. As of March 2018, a British government programme review recorded that stipends were being paid for 4,011 volunteers in 179 centres to provide search and rescue and other services, and that 114,507 civilians had been reported rescued or aided. In June 2018 the British government decided, due to the changing military situation, to responsibly withdraw from funding other projects in the area that the White Helmets operated in, such as policing, education and livelihood support, while maintaining support for the White Helmets. In October 2018, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry announced that at least 300 White Helmets members who had fled Syria into Jordan are now resettled in several Western countries, including Canada and the United Kingdom. Partnerships and funding SCD is officially an impartial humanitarian NGO, with no affiliation to any political or military actor and a commitment to render services to anyone in need. Like all NGOs operating in opposition-controlled areas, SCD negotiates humanitarian access with organisations such as local councils, provincial councils, and armed groups, with relationships varying widely from governorate to governorate. SCD work in close partnership with the Netherlands-based NGO Mayday Rescue Foundation. Mayday Rescue's Program Manager for Syria is Farouq Habib, who has also been described as the White Helmets' Head of International Relations. The White Helmets receives charitable funding from the United States, the United Kingdom, and other western governments. Initially the United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office was the largest single source of funding through Mayday Rescue Foundation. U.S. government funds are directed to SCD through Chemonics, a U.S. based private international development company. Funders now include the Canadian government Peace and Stabilization Operations Program, the Danish government, the German government, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs. the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the United Kingdom Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF). USAID have contributed at least $23 million from 2013 to March 2016. The British government had provided ¬£15 million of funding between 2012 and November 2015, increased to ¬£32 million by October 2016. As of 31 March 2018, the British government had provided ¬£38.4m in aid to the White Helmets. The SCD has also received individual donations online to their Hero Fund, which provides treatment for wounded volunteers and supports their families. In March 2017, the organization was reported to be operating on an annual budget of about $26 million. Mayday Rescue reports that between 2014 and 2018 the White Helmets received funding of $127 million, $19 million of which came from non- government sources; it is not clear if this included U.S. government funding which went through Chemonics rather than Mayday Rescue. In 2018, the White Helmets' vice president reported that the group‚Äôs financing for 2018 from foreign governments had fallen to $12 million from $18 million the previous year. In April 2018, the Trump administration suspended the funding of the White Helmets as part of a wider suspension of the funding of stabilization projects in Syria while the U.S. reassesses its role in Syria. The U.S. had provided more than $33 million to support the group since 2013. On 14 June 2018, the Trump administration authorised USAID and the United States Department of State to release approximately $6.6 million in aid to be shared between the group and the UN's International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism in Syria. The Netherlands announced that it would end its funding of several aid projects in opposition strongholds in Syria, including the White Helmets, by December 2018. This announcement followed a Ministry of Foreign Affairs report according to which the supervision over the activity of White Helmets is inadequate and there is a risk that funds meant for the rescue workers would end up in the hands of armed groups instead.Nederland stopt steun aan Syrische oppositie wegens gebrekkig toezicht op hulpprojecten; Britse organisatie ontkent kritiek, Volkskrant, 10 September 2018 Publicity and recognition Raed al-Saleh (left), SCD Director, meets with UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt in 2018 SCD is widely cited, quoted, or depicted in regional and international media coverage of the conflict in Syria. Raed Al Saleh, the Director of SCD, has been an outspoken advocate against bombardment of civilians, addressing the United Nations Security Council and other international bodies on a number of occasions. SCD has been the subject of two films. The streaming service Netflix released a documentary film entitled The White Helmets on 16 September 2016 by British director Orlando von Einsiedel and producer Joanna Natasegara. The film won the Best Documentary (Short Subject) at the 89th Academy Awards. SCD head Raed Saleh was unable to attend the Oscars ceremony due to escalation of the conflict, despite having a valid visa. Khaled Khateeb, cinematographer of the film, was unable to attend due to a visa problem. The Associated Press reported that the United States Department of Homeland Security under President Trump decided to block Khaled Khateeb at the 11th hour. Released in 2017, Last Men in Aleppo was directed by Syrian director Feras Fayyad in collaboration with Danish film-maker Steven Johannessen and the Aleppo Media Centre; it was the Winner of the Grand Jury Documentary prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 2017.Charlie Phillips Unflinching film-making ‚Ä¶ Last Men in Aleppo, Guardian Tuesday 24 January 2017 SCD was nominated for the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize and was a recipient of the 2016 Right Livelihood Award, the \\"Alternative Nobel Prize\\". In 2017, it was awarded the McCall-Pierpaoli Humanitarian Award by Refugees International and its women volunteers were awarded the Theirworld Hope award by Sarah Brown's children's charity Theirworld.Female White Helmets from Syria and Afghan footballer receive Theirworld awards, Theirworld, 7 March 2017 Female SCD volunteer Manal Abazeed, who accepted these awards, was listed by Fortune magazine as being among the \\"World's Most Powerful Women\\" of 2017. In 2017, Politico listed Khaled Omar Harrah, a leading member in Aleppo, known as the 'child rescuer', as one of the 28 people \\"shaping, shaking and stirring Europe\\". He was killed in Aleppo in an airstrike in August 2016. Harrah is the main character in Last Men in Aleppo, which was dedicated to him after his death. Another prominent member is Mohammed Abu Kifah, a civil defence team member who rescued another child from beneath the rubble in Idlib.Raf Sanchez Seven members of Syria's White Helmets shot dead by unknown gunmen, 'Telegraph, 12 August 2017 Following his death in an apparent assassination on 12 August 2017, aged 25 years old, Kifah's life was commemorated on BBC Radio 4's Last Word.  Controversies  According to investigative journalists and analysts, SCD became a target of a systematic information warfare campaign by the Russian government, the Syrian government, alt-right personalities, and their supporters, who have accused the organisation of taking sides in the Syrian Civil War, carrying arms and supporting \\"terrorist\\" groups. Claims by contributors to the English language Russian-funded RT television network and Sputnik news agency have come under scrutiny and multiple sources have found issues with the veracity and credibility of the Russian outlets in making accusations against SCD. According to The New York Times, Assad's claim that the White Helmets are \\"Al-Qaeda members\\" was \\"without evidence\\". Assertions made by RT contributor Eva Bartlett that the White Helmets stage rescues and \\"recycle\\" children in its videos were reported by Snopes and Channel 4 News as being false \\"beyond a reasonable doubt\\". In December 2017, The Guardian newspaper commented that it had \\"uncovered how this counter-narrative is propagated online by a network of anti-imperialist activists, conspiracy theorists and trolls with the support of the Russian government...[which] ...attract an enormous online audience, amplified by high-profile alt-right personalities, appearances on Russian state TV and an army of Twitter bots.\\" In November 2016, the Revolutionaries of Syria Media Office, an opposition media organisation, published a video showing two SCD volunteers performing a staged rescue operation for the Mannequin Challenge meme. The White Helmets apologised for their volunteers' error of judgement and said it had not shared the recording on their official channels. In June 2017, a member of the White Helmets was suspended indefinitely after he was discovered to have assisted armed militants in the burial of mutilated corpses of soldiers belonging to pro-government forces. Footage showing White Helmets members removing a man's body following his execution by rebel militants has caused critics to accuse the group of \\"assisting\\" in executions. The leader of the White Helmets has remarked that these are \\"isolated incidents\\" and are not representative of the leadership of the organisation. In 2018, Anglican vicar Andrew Ashdown, along with Church of England and House of Lords figures such as Lord Carey of Clifton and Michael Nazir-Ali, visited Syria and met with Assad; Ashdown accused the White Helmets of being militants, and accused the group of \\"keeping an injured Syrian child untreated and covered in dust and blood\\" for propaganda purposes. A UK Foreign Office memorandum criticized the trip, warning that it would be exploited by Assad. The White Helmets have a hostile relationship with the majority-Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The group operated in Afrin until the local Kurdish administration banned it in December 2015. It returned following the capture of the city by the Turkish Army and Syrian rebels in the Turkish-led Operation Olive Branch in 2018. In June 2019, after fires set to crop fields by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant threatened the food supply of Syrians living in SDF-controlled areas, the White Helmets offered to enter SDF territory and help fight the fires, but permission was denied. Nicholas A. Heras, a Fellow at the Center for a New American Security, stated that the White Helmets, as an organization, referred to Turkey‚Äôs operation in Afrin as the \\"liberation\\" of Afrin, and maintained that there was \\"credible evidence\\" that the White Helmets assisted Turkish soldiers and rebels by providing de-mining assistance. The White Helmets denied that they supported the campaign.

The novel received mixed reviews. Slade House originated as a Twitter story which was then developed into a full novel, and is a companion to The Bone Clocks. Set between the late seventies and the present, the novel explores the mysterious Slade House and a number of characters who are drawn to it.  Plot summary  = The Right Sort = In 1979, Nathan Bishop and his mother are invited to the house of the respected Lady Grayer. Nathan is quickly acquainted with her son Jonah, and the two spend the afternoon in the garden of Slade House whilst Norah Grayer entertains Nathan‚Äôs mother. Nathan begins hallucinating strange people and other visions and becomes worried that the Valium he took from his mother is having a bad effect. After being invited into the house, he experiences more hallucinations before finding himself at his father's lodge in Rhodesia. This dream is quickly broken by the Grayers, who reveal themselves to be twin siblings and carnivorous Anchorites, beings who steal the souls of certain people to maintain their youth. The Anchorites conduct a ceremony, and feast on Nathan‚Äôs soul. = Shining Armour = In 1988, a detective inspector, Gordon Edmonds, is investigating Slade Alley, and stumbles into the garden. There, he meets a widowed woman named Chloe Chetwynd. While they talk, Edmonds hears children playing but is confused to see there are none. Edmonds reveals he‚Äôs investigating the disappearance of the Bishops, who were assumed to have fled debts, but a window cleaner awakened from a coma revealed his interactions with them on the day of their disappearance. The inspector and Chloe strike up a relationship, and Chloe reveals that the voices Edmonds heard are ghosts she too hears. They become intimate, but it is short-lived. Edmonds is lured upstairs, and has a brief encounter with the remnants of Nathan. The twins reveal they are not members of the Anchorites, but act alone. Norah, to Jonah's disdain, believes they can no longer operate as they have. They begin their ceremony and absorb Edmonds' soul. = Oink Oink = In 1997, a group of students belonging to a paranormal club converge upon Slade House, intending to investigate the disappearances of the Bishops and Edmonds. One of the students, Sally Timms, is infatuated with a fellow member. The leader of the group is the nephew of Fred Pink, the window cleaner who saw the Bishops before they disappeared. The group stumble into a previously non-existent Slade House and discover it appears as a student house in the throes of a Halloween party. Sally mingles with the guests of the party before waking to find herself next to a frozen man implied to be Inspector Edmonds, who hands her a weapon, a hairpin with a fox head. Sally is led to the attic via the Grayers' mind games. The twins argue once again about their methods, and prepare their ceremony. Sally swears someone will stop them, and then her soul is consumed. = You Dark Horse You = In 2006, Sally Timms' sister Freya meets with Fred Pink in a pub near the supposed Slade House. Pink reveals he has been investigating the House and the Grayers for years. He tells her they were born in the late 1800s, and were known for their mystical abilities. They travelled the world learning all they could and eventually retired to Slade House in the 1930s. They used their power to isolate Slade House from time, placing it in a bubble where it existed long after its destruction during bombings in the 1940s. Freya, believing Pink to be mad, intends to leave, but finds herself in the attic of Slade House. Jonah reveals he was playing Pink all along. Norah is furious with him for revealing their history to Freya, but they begin their ceremony. Just as Freya's soul is taken from her body, Sally appears, stabbing Jonah in the neck with the fox pin. The twins are enraged, and Freya's soul is not consumed and allowed to pass on. = Astronauts = In 2015, Norah Grayer invites the former psychologist of Fred Pink, a Doctor Iris Marinus-Fenby, to Slade House. After eighteen years without fresh energy, the house's reality is decaying and Jonah remains injured and trapped in the attic. Norah inhabits the body of a young conspiracy theorist, who lures Iris into the garden with the insistence Pink was not mad. Within the reality of Slade House, it is clearly fading away, and a weakened Norah and Jonah are unable to play their normal mind games. Iris is drawn to the attic, where Jonah and Norah prepare to consume her, but at the last minute she reveals herself to be an Horologist, immortals who are reincarnated as opposed to the Shaded Way method of consuming souls for immortality. Marinus criticises the antiquity of the Grayers' methods compared to new ones, and encourages Jonah to attack, allowing her to easily destroy him. She leaves Norah in the collapsing attic of Slade House's final moments to age and wither into nothing. At the last second, Norah, enraged and powered by the desire for revenge, transplants her soul into an unborn child.  Allusions and references  As with all of David Mitchell's novels, Slade House contains references to his other works; be they people, places or events. *The primary antagonists of the story are soul carnivores, people who learned dark arts in order to subsist on the souls of people with psychic gifts in order to maintain their youth.

This cleared the way for Girard to win the gold in 1,000 m, the first Canadian short track speed skater to win in the distance. =Retirement= While competing at the 2019 World Championships Girard won another silver medal, his fourth individual world medal and sixth including two relay medals. During the summer of 2019, Girard and his girlfriend Kasandra Bradette, suddenly announced their retirement. Girard was expected to be the heir to Charles Hamelin but actually retired before the elder. His retirement left the Canadian men's short track team without a true star aside from Hamelin, leaving Kim Boutin as the sole leader of the Canadian team.

A branch of Libanus, Aberaman, early meetings were held at the home of Thomas Anthony, an engineer at the Shepherd's Pit in the village. However, in 1868 the first building collapsed due to its being located directly above a coal level owned by one David Bevan. The chapel was rebuilt the following year.

A true definition of forgiveness is debated by many researchers, yet Hargrave suggests that forgiveness refers to releasing resentment towards an offender. Forgiveness is a complex phenomenon which involves cognitive, affective, behavioural, motivational, decisional and interpersonal elements. Forgiveness is thought to be central to human functioning and important in restoring interpersonal relationships. It is an effective intervention to problems caused by anger, depression, drug abuse, guilt and moral development. Due to the different conceptualisations of forgiveness, different scales have been developed to measure the ability in different ways. Examples of forgiveness scales include the Forgiveness scale of the Interpersonal Relationship Resolution Scale;Hargrave, Terry D. The Development of a Forgiveness Scale. Journal of marital and family therapy. (01/1997), 23 (1), p. 41 - 62. the Marital Offence-Specific Forgiveness Scale;Paleari, F. Giorgia Measuring offence-specific forgiveness in marriage: The Marital Offence-Specific Forgiveness Scale (MOFS).. Psychological assessment. (2009), 21 (2), p. 194 - 209. the Workplace Forgiveness Scale;Watkins, Itsara A Psychometric Analysis of the Workplace Forgiveness Scale. Europe's journal of psychology. (05/2013), 9 (2), p. 319 - 338 and the Tendency to Forgive scale.Brown, Ryan P. Letting bygones be bygones: further evidence for the validity of the Tendency to Forgive scale. Personality and individual differences. (02/2005), 38 (3), p. 627 - 638 Forgiveness can also be measured via methods which are not empirical scales. These may come in the form of biological measures; such as chemical, central and peripheral physiological measures, as well as behavioural measures; and measures of self forgiveness. Studies have found that compared to participants without past suicide attempts, those with past suicide attempts scored on the Forgiveness Scale as being significantly less believing of forgiveness by others, were less likely to forgive themselves, and to a lesser degree, were less forgiving of others.Sansone, Randy A. The relationship between forgiveness and history of suicide attempt. Mental health, religion & culture. (01/2013), 16 (1), p. 31 - 37  The Development of Forgiveness Scales  = Hargrave's Forgiveness Framework = This framework builds the basis for some forgiveness scales by identifying that destructive entitlement results in family pain and hurt. Forgiveness is able to reduce this destructive entitlement and improve family relationships. Hargrave identified that forgiveness can be categorised as exonerating or forgiving. Exonerating focuses on understanding why the pain was perpetrated whereas forgiving focuses on rebuilding love and trust in the relationship. Forgiving can also be achieved by giving the opportunity for compensation through an overt act of forgiving. The development of the Interpersonal Relationship Resolution Scale (IRRS) from this framework uses the victim's perceptions of their interactions with others. This is because the IRRS is a self-report measure. = Interpersonal Relationship Resolution Scale (IRRS) = A five stage procedure was used to develop the IRRS. Stage 1: This initial stage involved the development of definitions for forgiveness and the manifestations of pain; these included forgiveness through insight, opportunity for compensation and the act of forgiving as well as a range of pain from shame to rage to chaos. These definitions were grouped to form the Forgiveness Scale and the Pain Scale respectively. Stage 2: Then statements were formulated, from the definitions in stage 1, to create the items for the scale. 162 items were created for the preliminary IRRS represented in the form of 'yes/no' options from which the participant chose. The final IRRS consisted of a forgiveness scale of 44 items. Stage 3: The third stage was used to test the preliminary IRRS. The scale's subjects, factor analysis and reliability were tested. These results showed that there was no correlation between the Forgiveness and Pain Scales, thus confirming that they tested different phenomena. Stage 4: Concurrent validity of the IRRS was then tested. Both the Forgiveness Scale and the Pain Scale were found to have correlations to other scales which increased the concurrent validity of the IRRS. Stage 5: The final stage looked into the predictive validity of the IRRS which was supported by the findings. The IRRS was then acknowledged as a suitable scale for testing forgiveness through perceptual inter-personal interactions. = Tendency to Forgive Scale (TTF) = The TFF Scale is another empirical measure used to determine forgiveness and was developed by Ryan Brown in 2003. This measure differs from other forgiveness scales as it seeks to determine dispositional forgiveness over general attitudes towards forgiveness - such as the Attitudes towards Forgiveness Scale (ATF) \\\\- or scenario based measures - such as the Transgression Narrative Test of Forgiveness (TNTF). The TFF Scale is a scale consisting of Likert-Scales which ask participants to respond with how they would usually respond when someone offends them. These items include statements such as \\"I tend to get over things quickly when someone hurts my feelings.\\" = Self-Forgiveness Dual-Process Scale = Forgiveness is usually thought of in the concept of forgiving others for their wrongdoing, however it is also possible to experience self-forgiveness. Self-forgiveness is where a person becomes able to forgive themselves for any negative things they have said or done and experience moral repair. Therefore, the Self-Forgiveness Dual-Process Scale was created to measure it. This scale was developed to test subject's self-forgiveness through positive value reorientation involving a cognitive shift to accepting responsibility for one's perceived offence, as well as the restoration of the self-esteem of the individual. By recognising and measuring the mechanisms of self-forgiveness, regular functioning can be restored and thus improve the psychological well-being of individuals. Therefore the development of scales and understanding of self-forgiveness can not only aid research empirically but also the clinical applications of self- forgiveness and interpersonal functioning.  Usefulness of Forgiveness Scales  The IRRS and TFF scales have both been acknowledged as highly valid through concurrent and discriminant validity tests respectively. This ensures that the scales are measuring what they intended to in terms of forgiveness. Thus, meaning that further academic research can utilise these measures when determining the forgiveness levels of their subjects. The IRRS has been found to be a reliable and valid instrument for its purpose. This scale can be used to determine participant's forgiveness and the pain which they have perceptually experienced. As forgiveness is such a complex concept, this attempt to measure it using psychological methodology is very useful to researchers but should not be thought of as an exhaustive measure of forgiveness. Research has shown that individual differences in one's willingness and ability to forgive are apparent. Therefore dispositional tests such as the TFF can be beneficial in improving the ability to predict forgiveness in conflicts and give insight into the interpersonal differences in forgiveness tendencies. The psychometric properties and validity of the Self-Forgiveness Scale were statistically supported and therefore also increase the usefulness of the scale in further research. However; the majority of recognised forgiveness scales are self-report scales. This may contribute to the limitation of the validity of some measures as subjects responding to the scales may act under certain biases, examples may include social desirability bias. Yet there is still evidence to show that these scales earned high reliability scores using Cronbach's Alpha and thus are still useful in psychological research. It may therefore be suggested that in order to determine the most accurate and reliable measure of forgiveness, triangulation is needed. This involves combining measures from different approaches of measuring forgiveness; such as self-report scales, indirect measures and observational strategies in order to produce adequate and thorough assessments of the concept at hand. This avoids the assumption that a single forgiveness scale is fully exhaustive of the concept and helps to preserve forgiveness' holistic nature. Thus addressing both ultimate and proximate measures of human forgiveness.

She creates abstract works inspired by the natural world. Her practice encompasses painting, design, sculpture, and video installation. Early life and education Mira Lehr was born in Brooklyn, New York. Her father, Charles I. Tager, was an inventor who patented an affordable, efficient version of the modern stapler. Lehr received a degree in art history from Vassar College in 1956, where she studied under Adolf Katzenellenbogen, Wolfgang Lotz, and notable feminist historian Linda Nochlin. After college she did post-graduate work at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and received a Rockefeller scholarship that supported a studio in Carnegie Hall. Lehr studied with a range of artists through her career, including James Brooks, James Billmyer, Nieves Marshaleck Billmyer (Hans Hofmann School) and Robert Motherwell. Although she maintained her studio practice consistently, she didn‚Äôt start widely exhibiting her work until the 1980s. In 1960 Lehr moved back with her husband to Miami Beach, where she had been raised. She describes the lack of art scene and cultural vibrancy as being \\"like a desert island.‚Äù She and a contingent of other female artists founded Continuum Gallery, which lasted into the 1990s. It was among the first women‚Äôs co-op gallery spaces in the South East, and many of its founders are still involved with the now- bourgeoning Miami art scene. Many art world luminaries came to lead workshops, speak and interact with the members, including Betty Parsons, John Chamberlain and Buckminster Fuller. Lehr was later selected by Fuller in 1969 to work on the first World Game Scenario Project at the New York Studio School. Artwork and themes Sand Bar, 2014, Mixed media on canvas, 54 x 72 inches Working with imagery from the natural world, Lehr creates layered abstract compositions with unconventional materials. 60 Minutes correspondent Morley Safer referred to her as \\"the mistress of light\\". The lush flora of her Florida home has a profound influence on her aesthetic vocabulary. Lehr seeks to express the natural world's essence and patterns, so that her artwork expresses the reality of nature better than a naturalistic rendering. On closer inspection, they reveal a myriad of contrasts ‚Äî natural imagery with abstract gesture, dense planes with translucent washes, and rich, abraded textures with a crisp, contemporary structure. Art historian Irving Sandler describes her use of imagery thus: ‚ÄúWhat makes Lehr's work different is the specificity of her references to nature. I was trying to think of any other artist working in this tradition who did it quite as explicitly as Mira did and I couldn‚Äôt come up with one.\\" She plays with things intangible and impermanent- in her sculptures, for example, the shadows created on the wall are as much a part of the piece as the physical objects. With her use of poured resins in her paintings, the spaces that separate layers are integral marks themselves. Mira‚Äôs work has been noted for its environmentalist connotations; one exhibition, \\"The Pull of the Tide‚Äù in Miami, was particularly explicit about its intentions. Coastlines, which are fragile ecosystems, are threatened by pollution and development. While the sculptures are seductively beautiful, they are partially made of politically charged materials, including jute hemp, whose purpose is to prevent land from eroding. Lehr created forms that resemble jellyfish, which can regenerate themselves. She describes taking inspiration from the cycle of nature- we have polluted and overfished the oceans, but they are now threatening to encroach on our developed world. Asian influence Many critics have commented upon an Asian or Japanese influence, particularly in her choice of materials and processes; Lehr uses Japanese paper, ink, lacquer, and woodblock printing in her work. The deliberate and balanced compositions are reminiscent of scroll-painted landscapes. Critic Courtney Powers Curtiss emphasizes how Lehr‚Äôs paintings have a spirituality associated with nature that is found in many Asian belief systems. This is historian Eleanor Heartney take: \\"The hanging moons, silhouetted bellflowers and expressive freestyle lines do evoke an Asian aesthetic. But in fact, Lehr was well on her way to this approach to art before she began to fully appreciate Asian art. Instead the connection must be sought a deeper level. Lehr's work, like that of the Japanese masters, is based on a honing down, and a sense of disciplined restraint. Lehr's interest in haiku comes out of this approach. Like those highly structured and deeply minimalist poems, in which a whole world is evoked with a few words or a simple metaphor, she is interested in creating a reality in which a few forms and lines speak volumes.\\" Sea Foam 1, 2014, Steel wire, resin, Japanese paper, ink, 24\\" x 36\\" x 16‚Äù Recent work Lehr has started experimenting with explosives in her work. She uses gunpowder and fuses, which burn holes and leave imprints on her layered paintings. The resulting forms resemble lace with an uncontrolled, grainy quality. She describes her use of explosives as tying into the theme of creation versus destruction, which is integral to the cycle of nature. Lehr has also recently expanded her practice to include resin, Japanese rice paper, and steel wire. She also uses marine rope to create large scale mangrove root sculptures. Career Lehr has exhibited widely in the United States, particularly New York and Florida, and internationally with the Art in Embassies program. Her pieces have been included in exhibitions and archives of the New Museum, the Smithsonian Museum of American Art, and the Getty Museum. In 2015 a retrospective, titled Mira Lehr: Mapping Nature, was held at Rosenbaum Contemporary in Florida. Throughout her career she has collaborated with design companies Holly Hunt and Stephanie Odegard, for whom she designed handmade rugs. In 2016 Lehr was invited to have a solo show at the Fairchild Tropical Gardens titled Second Nature. Shortly after, Lehr was commissioned to create an outdoor sculpture in celebration of the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens centennial. This outdoor sculpture served as a performance set for the opera Dido and Aeneas. In 2018 Lehr was selected for a museum wide exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami, titled Tracing the Red Thread. It referred to the complex environmental situation we find ourselves in today. USA Today named one of the must-see exhibitions of fall 2018. Artnet also listed the exhibition as one of \\"33 Museum Shows Worth Traveling For.\\" The exhibition subsequently traveled to Fritz Gallery, and will travel to the Orlando Mennello Museum of American Art in 2020. Mangrove sculptures from the exhibition were part of a special project at Pinta Miami, Ad-Astra, held at Mana Contemporary during Art Basel 2018. 2019 also included a solo show at the Jewish Museum of Florida Lehr is represented by Rosenbaum Contemporary and exhibits with the gallery at Art Miami.

It is the sequel to Crazy Rich Asians, a novel about the wealthy Singapore elite. Kwan was urged to write the sequel by his publishers after the initial success of Crazy Rich Asians. The title refers to a line in the novel in which Nick's mother, Eleanor, exclaims over the wealth of the \\"China rich\\" who are billionaires, \\"These people aren't just everyday rich with a few hundred million. They are China rich!\\" The novel was followed by a sequel, Rich People Problems in 2017. Plot In 2013, two years after the events of Crazy Rich Asians, the story begins with Eddie meeting with a wealthy client of his European bank, Bao Shaoyen, a distraught mother who is anxious to hear about her troubled son who was in a car accident from racing an expensive car. He is undergoing serious surgery, while one of his two passengers becomes paralyzed and the other dies. Bao Shaoyen needs this incident to be discreetly addressed, and Eddie manages to blackmail Eleanor Young into helping the woman, who she learns is extremely wealthy and has a son named Carlton who strongly resembles Rachel Chu, the girlfriend of her estranged son, Nick. Back in Manhattan, Nick has managed to repair his relationship with Rachel, and they have planned a wedding in California, near Rachel's relatives. Astrid Teo, Nick's cousin, is invited to this wedding, and later meets with Charlie Wu, her former fianc√©. Astrid's husband, Michael, has become extremely successful due to Charlie's secret investment, and his behavior has become arrogant and hostile. Charlie is stuck in an unhappy marriage with Isabel, but does not let Astrid know, and continues to help her with her troubled marital issues. Meanwhile, Kitty Pong, the former soap actress who managed to marry her way into the Singapore elite, tries to buy her way into the high-society of Hong Kong by appearing in gossip magazines and buying high-profile art. However, she is socially clumsy and finds herself continually shunned; so she hires the services of Corinna Ko-Tung, a woman from a well-born family who helps Kitty appear more sophisticated by trying to change her behavior and make better social connections. Kitty can act well and manages to amend some of the damages she created. Nick is still not on speaking terms with his mother or his grandmother, and he does not attend his grandmother's Chinese New Year event. While still investigating Bao Shaoyen and her son, Eleanor learns of the upcoming wedding details from Astrid‚Äôs son. Intruding upon Rachel and Nick's wedding rehearsal, she informs Rachel that she has located her long-lost father, and she reconnects him with Rachel and her mother. Eleanor decides that she approves of Nick and Rachel's marriage, Nick is suspicious and asks her why she is reversing her position. She reveals it wasn't just because Rachel now associates with the wealthy elite of China, but also that Eleanor was trying to protect both him and Rachel from Su Yi's wrath. Years ago, she endured life as Su Yi's disapproved daughter-in-law due to Philip marrying her out of love. Rachel meets her father, Bao Gaoling, prior to the wedding, and is afterwards invited to spend time with his entire family in Shanghai during her honeymoon. Bao Shaoyen is angered by this and demands Bao Gaoling keep her away from her house. He places her in a fancy hotel and stalls any meeting for over a week, but Nick suspects mischief. Carlton is also banned from associating with her, but decides to meet Rachel anyway, and quickly becomes close with her and Nick. He introduces her to his wealthy party-time friend Colette Bing. The four of them eventually travel to Paris for a shopping spree. At a party, Colette's boyfriend for 3-years, Richie Yang, proposes but she does not accept. He gets angry at Carlton and they vent their anger by deciding to compete in a reckless car race. Rachel begins to feel upset she has only met her father once since reuniting. Colette and Rachel try to stop Carlton from car racing against Richie. In anger, he accidentally tells Rachel that Bao Shaoyen refuses to let her into her household. Bao Shaoyen is in fear of losing her husband's political advantages for having an illegitimate child, and wishes to prevent Rachel from receiving Carlton's inheritance. Before leaving, Colette calls him a spoiled brat for hurting Rachel and tells him to go through with the race with Richie. Upon learning about his previous accident, Rachel convinces Carlton not to race Richie. In turn, Carlton apologizes to Rachel for his behavior. Rachel decides to leave China, but returns for a spa weekend with her friend Peik Lin. However, at the spa, she becomes very ill and is placed under medical watch after experiencing mysterious organ failures. Peik Lin and Nick receive a bouquet of flowers with a note, saying that Rachel was poisoned as a warning. The poison is extremely rare, and Carlton realizes that his parent's pharmaceutical company may be involved. Believing Bao Shaoyen poisoned Rachel, he comes home to confront her about it and she denies involvement in the poisoning. Refusing to believe his mother, Carlton then confesses to his father about how she bribed everyone to cover up the truth of his accident as well as the other girl's death. However, when Rachel discovers the truth, he claims Shaoyen intentionally poisoned her in order to shun her. Carlton ends his confession stating that their family will face disgrace from the China Elite, but not by Rachel and him, when the police come to arrest Shaoyen for his sister's poisoning. Now remorseful for how he's treated Rachel, Bao Gaoling visits her and Nick over in Hong Kong at Eddie's apartment. Apologizing, Gaoling confesses that Shaoyen has become cooperative with the police. He invites Rachel into his home, where she is introduced to the rest of his family who are all touched by her story. Bao Shaoyen finally meets Rachel and discovers how similar she looks to her son. She realizes her fears were misplaced and apologizes to her. In doing so, they start to get along. The police discover that Colette's assistant Roxanne was behind the poisoning, which was done in response to Colette's tearful concerns that her inheritance would be reduced. Despite Colette's lack of knowledge to the situation, Carlton blames Colette and breaks up with her. Nick is hesitant, but Rachel agrees to meet with Colette and accepts her apology. Colette later asks that Rachel help her and Carlton reconcile. Rachel does not want to get involved, and Colette becomes hysterical. She accuses Rachel of vindictively keeping them apart. She begins yelling at and berating her. Rachel responds by accusing Colette for being selfish. She points out that she learned to be content in having a loving supportive family and working hard in the real world. Rachel claims that Colette never knew how to be content. The argument ends when Rachel tells Colette to grow up. The incident is taped and becomes widely viewed on the internet. Humiliated, Colette loses her sponsorship to a popular fashion designer label. This is made worse when she learns through the tabloids that her father, Jack, had been having an affair with Kitty behind her back. Meanwhile, Astrid finds herself increasingly confiding in Charlie Wu after her husband becomes detached and cold. Michael gets interviewed by a magazine about his family, naming him Father of the Year after bragging about his accomplishments and showcasing his luxury items. The magazine then does research into Astrid Leong and publishes information about her lineage and wealth. This angers her family and he is forced to meet with her father, who berates him in front of a man Michael is trying to impress. The magazines are recalled and retracted from distribution, and Michael begins to believe that his company's situation is the result of Astrid's father's meddling. Astrid eventually realizes that the company was bought at a loss by Charlie so that Michael would feel more confident in the marriage. Michael confronts Astrid about her relationship with Charlie, revealing he has read her messages and threatening her with a weapon. Astrid takes control of the situation and escapes with her son. Later, it is revealed that Charlie Wu had divorced Isabel and he and Astrid have not left each other's sides all night. Kitty Pong and Corinna Ko-Tung, her society consultant, run into issues where no one has seen her husband, Bernard Tai, in ages and have speculated about rumors regarding his disappearance along with their daughter. Kitty finally shows Corinna where her husband has been hiding, in a small house in Los Angeles while he is receiving reconstructive surgery. It is revealed he has dramatically changed from being in California for so long, and their daughter is forced to engage in his new and unfamiliar lifestyle. She kidnaps her daughter and they escape using the private plane of her lover Jack Bing. She returns to her lavish house in Singapore with her daughter and reconnects Carol Tai with her granddaughter.

Reception The novel received positive reviews and was noted in The Washington Post as \\"the year's best beach reading,\\" as well as excerpted in Vanity Fair. Anne Kingston of Maclean's wrote of the novel, \\"Kevin Kwan‚Äôs sequel to the bestselling Crazy Rich Asians is perhaps even more delicious than the first.\\" Film adaptation Time reported on August 15, 2018 that Kwan has been tasked with developing the sequel to Crazy Rich Asians from his follow-up novel China Rich Girlfriend. (physically published in August 27, 2018 issue; digitally published on August 15) The planning is still in pre- production as of August 2018, with several of the key actors currently committed to other projects until 2020. Director Jon Chu was also already committed to shoot the film adaptation of In the Heights, which was scheduled for release in June 2021. Awkwafina was interviewed in January 2019 and indicated that there were still no scripts for the sequel and that production filming had not started. According to Town and Country magazine, the filming and premiere of the film is not scheduled to take place until 2020. According to a Slash film journal article, the two sequels, including Rich People Problems, will be shot back-to-back in 2020 once the filming commences. Shooting is expected to be delayed until at least the end of 2020. Screenwriter Adele Lim declined to work on the sequels because of an equal-pay inequity dispute during negotiations in fall 2018. Color Force had hired the experienced Peter Chiarelli to write the screenplay for the Crazy Rich Asians adaptation; when Chu joined the original production, he brought Lim on to add authentic details from Singapore and Malaysia. For the sequels, Warner Brothers had initially offered Lim a salary approximately th of Chiarelli's pay; although they later made an offer closer in parity to Chiarelli's, who had offered to split his fee with Lim, Lim declined. On April 29, 2019, CNBC reported that Harry Shum Jr. is to be cast in the role of playing Astrid's previous boyfriend in the sequel to Crazy Rich Asians, stating, \\"Shum will play Charlie Wu, the former flame of Astrid Young Teo (played by Gemma Chan), cousin of lead character Nick Young, in China Rich Girlfriend, which is currently in pre-production.\\" The sequel film is expected to focus on the relationship between Charlie and Astrid, the search for Rachel's father, and Kitty Pong.

Gladfelter (born April 27, 1974) is a quantitative cell biologist and Professor of Biology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she mainly investigates cell cycle control and the septin cytoskeleton. She discovered that nuclei in multinucleated cells can undergo the cell cycle asynchronously despite sharing a common cytoplasm and continues to investigate spatial organization of the cell and cellular components. Additionally, she studies the assembly of the septin cytoskeleton and the how aberrant septin structure affects their function. She has trained and mentored many undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows. The American Society for Cell Biology named her the winner of the 2015 WICB Mid- Career Award for Excellence in Research for her contributions to the field. Gladfelter was named a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Faculty Scholar in 2016. Early life and education Gladfelter was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on April 27, 1974. She grew up in Windermere, Florida, and graduated from West Orange High School in 1992. It was during high school that Gladfelter became interested in biology, primarily due to exploring the natural world that the Florida countryside had to offer. Gladfelter attended and graduated from Princeton University with a B.A. in Molecular Biology in 1996. During her undergraduate summers, she spent extensive time doing research with Simon Lewis at the University of Texas Medical Branch, Toby Bradshaw at the University of Washington, and later Bonnie Bassler at Princeton. She then attended Duke University where she worked in Danny Lew's lab, exploring how cells polarize and CDC42 signaling. In 2001 she graduated from Duke University with a Ph.D. in Genetics. Following her time at Duke, she conducted post-doctoral research on the control of nuclear division in multinucleate fungal cells with Peter Philippsen at the University of Basel Biozentrum in Basel, Switzerland. Cell biology research Following her post doctorate work in Switzerland, Gladfelter returned to the United States and began work at Dartmouth College in 2006. She had her own lab which dealt with the arrangement of cells in time and space, and the organization of the septin cytoskeleton in cells. Her lab combined live cell microscopy and computational approaches with biochemistry and genetics analyses. One of the most significant discoveries Gladfelter made was asynchronous nuclear division in multinucleated cells. This discovery came in Ashbya gossypii cells, where nuclei that occupied the same cytoplasm progress through the cell cycle independently of each other. During her time at Dartmouth, Gladfelter also taught a full load of courses while she served as an Associate Professor of Biological Sciences. Additionally, she mentored undergraduate and graduate students, as well as post doctorates in her lab. Her leadership earned her the Graduate Student Mentoring Award from Dartmouth in 2014. A few years after starting at Dartmouth, Gladfelter began to collaborate with Rudolf Oldenbourg and Tomomi Tani during summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. One of her main focuses at the MBL is investigating the septin cytoskeleton, and in particular the ‚Äúorientation and dynamics of individual septin molecules with higher-order structures.‚Äù In 2016, Gladfelter left Dartmouth and began working at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), where she currently serves as an Professor of Biology. As before at Dartmouth, her lab at UNC employs both students and post-doctoral trainees to further investigate how cells are organized in time and space. The two main concepts she covers are how the cytoplasm is spatially organized and how cells sense their own geometry. Her team uses ‚Äúlarge multinucleate cells such as fungi, mammalian cancer lines, muscle, and placenta‚Äù to study the architecture of the cytoplasm. It is these cells that are of interest because of the challenges they face in cell division and growth due to their size. Additionally, multinucleate cells are common in tumors, making her lab work extremely relevant to understanding mechanisms of cancer formation and persistence. Recent discoveries include the aggregation of proteins that form liquid-like droplets within the cytosol, an example of biological phase separation (liquid-liquid phase separation). The second area Gladfelter's lab explores is how cells sense their shape. Because septins localize to areas of the cell that change shape or are highly curved, they are the proteins Gladfelter and her team examine. Septins are involved in many processes that occur in eukaryotic cells, including cytokinesis, formation of diffusion barriers to compartmentalize the plasma membrane, and regulation of cellular processes such as the release of neurotransmitters and microtubule dynamics. Because the septin cytoskeleton has a fundamental role in various cellular processes, understanding more about it can lead to a better understanding of the cell itself. Gladfelter has ‚Äúdiscovered how septins polymerize with [her] establishment of the first reconstitution system that can analyze septin dynamics on supported lipid bilayers.‚Äù Aberrant septin function has been linked to many different types of tumors, making Gladfelter's research useful in understanding septin's impact on malignant cells.

She is in overall length, of which is the hull, with a beam of and a draught of . During the Second World War, she was possibly used to smuggle refugees and arms from Poland and Denmark, supporting the Polish Home Army. Her rigging was later removed when she was motorized, with a custom-built engine, in 1950. She was in service as a trading vessel until the late 1960s. = Operation Raleigh = She was converted back to a sailing ship in the 1970s, and relocated to the UK. She was purchased by Nick Broughton and chartered to Operation Raleigh, led by Colonel Blashford-Snell, named after Walter Raleigh's first expedition to America 400 years earlier. She was extensively refitted, and the expedition was launched by Charles, Prince of Wales from St Katharine Docks in October 1984. She circumnavigated the globe between 1984 and 1988, over which time she carried nearly 500 young people, and visited 41 countries. During the operation she hosted people excavating the wreck of the Zanoni off the coast of Adelaide, Australia. = Liverpool = From the late 1980s for the next 27 years, she was based in Liverpool, and owned by the Mersey Heritage Trust. She was overhauled and refitted in 2000, and became known as the 'Flagship of Liverpool'. She has Brigantine rigging, with the main mast, the second and tallest of the two masts, carrying at least two sails. The foremast is square- rigged. In August 2013 the ship listed to port, with no-one aboard, and was subsequently stabilised. Around 4.30am on 4 September 2015, she sank at her moorings near to the Pumphouse Pub. Work to raise her started on Friday 25 September 2015, and finished on Tuesday 29 September 2015, by salvage teams from Hughes Sub-Surface Engineering, Waterwitch Engineering and Carmet Tug Company, using 8 airlift bags. Three days after Zebu was refloated, she was towed from outside of Tate Liverpool to Canning Dock, near to the Merseyside Maritime Museum. In January 2017 the ship was purchased by Gerrith and Suzi Borrett, and National Lottery Resilience Funding was received in November 2017. The community interest company Tall Ship ZEBU was founded in April 2017. , more restoration work is ongoing in order to turn the ship into a floating,mobile museum and educational platform in late 2020, that is capable of going out to sea rather than staying in harbour.

She replaced head coach Tina Martin and is the fourth in the history of the program. Playing career Born Natasha Deanean Barnes in Silver Spring, Maryland, she attended Albert Einstein High School, where she was a track star, leading her team to the state championship and the Penn Relays Invitational, before switching to play basketball. She went on to be named as a USA All-American in high school basketball and began to receive interest from several college coaches, namely University of Connecticut's Geno Auriemma. Following Adair's anterior cruciate ligament injury in 1990, Auriemma did not want her on his team. However, University of South Florida Coach Trudi Lacey called with a plan for Adair to go to Pensacola, Florida, to receive treatment. After the treatment, she could play at Pensacola Junior College and, if recovery went well, transfer to South Florida. Adair went to Pensacola and played the following season, leading her team in rebounding and to two state championships. Lacey monitored her progression, and Adair transferred to South Florida. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in communication and still maintains the single season rebounding record. Coaching career Following Adair's playing career, she went on to be an assistant coach at Georgetown (1998‚Äì2004) and Wake Forest (2004‚Äì2012). At Georgetown, she was primarily responsible for the post players. At Wake Forest, she was recruiting coordinator and post coach, before being promoted to associate head coach in 2007. In 2012, Adair became College of Charleston's women's head basketball coach. In her first season there, Adair guided her team to 16 wins and a spot in the Women's Basketball Invitational (WBI) postseason tournament. During the 2013-2014 season, Adair's team had a 19-15 record, marking the third-highest win total in the school's Division I era. The squad also finished third in conference play and advanced to the semifinals of both the Colonial Athletic Association Championship and the WBI. In 2014, Adair was introduced by Georgetown's Director of Athletics Lee Reed as the Hoyas' ninth women's head basketball coach.

A 1988 Guggenheim Fellow, she has served as president of the American Institute of Biological Sciences, the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists, Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology, International Union of Biological Sciences, and the International Society of Vertebrate Morphology. She is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the California Academy of Sciences, and is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Life Marvalee Hendricks was born in Orange, California on July 31, 1939. She attended the University of Southern California (USC), earning a B.A. 1961; M.S. in 1964; and completing her Ph.D. in 1968 under herpetologist Jay Savage. While at USC she met and married biologist David B. Wake and gave birth to a son. Wake became assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and later she and her husband moved to the University of California, Berkeley, where David assumed directorship of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology and Marvalee became a professor. She was rapidly promoted, eventually assuming the chair of the Department of Zoology and its successor, the Department of Integrative Biology. She nominally retired as professor in 2003, but remained active in research and since 2004 has held the position of Professor of the Graduate School at UC Berkeley. Wake is known as an expert in caecilians‚Äîa relatively little-known group of limbless amphibians‚Äîand her research has included the developmental biology, evolution, reproduction, and anatomy of these creatures. Her research has been credited with stimulating renewed world-wide interest in the group which has historically received little research. In her doctoral dissertation and a series of early papers she explored comparative aspects of caecilian reproductive anatomy, and in 1972 co-described the first evidence of caecilians in the fossil record. She is also recognized for her contributions towards the field of vertebrate morphology. Biologist Brian K. Hall writes: \\"Consistently, passionately and effectively, Marvalee Wake has advocated the teaching of morphology as a multifaceted modern science that informs evolutionary biology and evolutionary theory, and is foundational to integrative biology.\\" She has formally collaborated with her husband‚Äîan expert in salamanders‚Äîsince 1975, although the two maintain separate labs and graduate students. Wake has published or co-published over 200 journal articles and book chapters, edited a revision of the textbook Hyman's Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy (originally written by Libbie H. Hyman), and co-edited a general biology textbook (Biology, 1979) as well as the scholarly book The Origin and Evolution of Larval Forms (1999). Wake is commemorated in the name of the caecilian Microcaecilia marvaleewakeae, and she and her husband are jointly commemorated in the names of the frog genus Wakea and the lizard Cyrtodactylus wakeorum (Wakes' gecko). A festschrift of papers in her honor was published in the journal Zoology in 2005. Since 2013, Wake has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education. Wake has served as advisor to 17 doctoral students and 15 post-doctoral students. In 2014 she received the Henry S. Fitch Award for Excellence in Herpetology from the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.

His biggest hit, Shir LaMaalot (Psalm 121), appeared on his debut album, Road Marks (2000). Biography Born Gilad Kardunos, he was raised in a traditionalist Jewish family in Petah Tikva, Israel. As a youth, he excelled in swimming and football. He placed second in a national competition in the 50-meter breaststroke, and competed with the Po'el Petah Tikva football team until he suffered a sprain to his ankle. In his early teens, he studied music and in particular the bass guitar. In 1987, at the age of 18, he was conscripted into the Israel Defense Forces, where he played in a military musical troupe run by the Northern Command. Following his army service, Karduner formed his own rock band and was the backup guitarist for the Israeli singer Uzi Hitman. When Karduner was 24, he was first introduced to the Torah of Rabbi Nachman of Breslov which inspired him to learn more about Breslover Chasidus. Influenced by discussions with Hitman and his father, the scion of an Orthodox Jewish, Hasidic Lubavitcher family, Karduner put his career on hold and began studying in a yeshiva run by the Breslov Hasidic group for Jews who had turned to embrace Orthodox Judaism (\\"baalei teshuva\\"). In the mid-1990s, during his religious conversion, he changed his name from Gilad Kardunos to Yosef Karduner. During one session of secluded prayer (\\"hitbodedut\\"), the tune for Shir LaMaalot (\\"Song to the Ascents\\"‚ÄîPsalm 121) popped into Karduner's head and one of his teachers urged him to resume his music career, this time in a vein related to Judaism. Shir LaMaalot became a hit in the Israeli religious world, inspiring other religious songwriters such as Aharon Razel to begin composing songs with lyrics from the Hebrew Bible. Shir LaMaalot has been covered by numerous Israeli artists, including Sheva, and is a staple among synagogue youth groups in Israel and Canada. Although he has released 11 albums, Karduner's work has not reached a wide audience due to his aversion to public relations and advertising. He rarely gives interviews. His albums are distributed in the US and he has conducted several live concert tours in New York and Chicago, including annual appearances in Crown Heights, Brooklyn from 2011 to 2019 with Aryeh Kunstler. Karduner also joins Rabbi Moshe Weinberger of Congregation Aish Kodesh at the annual Hilula of The Aish Kodesh, the Rebbe of Piacezna. At those annual events, Weinberger speaks words of Torah while Karduner performs. Karduner has received inspiration from the teachings of Rabbi Shalom Arush and Rabbi Lazer Brody. In 2008 he and Brody staged several Orthodox Jewish outreach sessions together, combining music and dancing with talks on Judaism and faith. Outside of his music career, Karduner spends his time with his family, Torah study and collective and solitary prayer. He and his wife, Vered, have seven children and reside in Beit Shemesh, Israel. Musical style The teachings of Rebbe Nachman are a major source for Karduner's musical inspiration. Karduner's early albums were described as a \\"refreshing breeze on the Hasidic music scene\\". His melodies are simple and repetitive. His music also reflects soft rock, rock 'n' roll, jazz, and Latin music. A member of the Breslov Hasidic group, Karduner often sets the words of Rebbe Nachman's teachings to music, as well as composes songs based on biblical and liturgical passages. Karduner's clear voice has earned him the sobriquet \\"The Nightingale of Breslov\\". He has also been referred to as The \\"Sweet Singer of Breslov\\". Discography Karduner has released the following albums: *Sha'ah Achat (One Moment) (2020) *Mesugal L'Teshuva (Capable of Repentance) (2016) *Menorah HaZahav (The Golden Menorah) (2013) *Dibur Pashut (Simple Talk) (2012) *Kisufim L'Shabbat (Yearning for Shabbat) (2010) *Kumzits: Live in New York (2010) *Mikdash Melech (Sanctuary of the King) (2008) *Breslever Melave Malka (2006) *Bakesh Avdecha (Your Servant Asked) (2005) *Osef L'yedidi (2003) *Bechirah (Choice) (2003) *Achat Sha'alti (I Asked One Thing) (2003) *Mekor Chachmah (Source of Wisdom) (2002) *Simanim Baderech (Road Marks) and Kol HaOlam (The Whole World) (2000, double album) References External links *\\"Yosef Karduner: Shir LaMa'alot\\" (video) *Interview with Yosef Karduner on The Jewish Scene (Hebrew) Category:1969 births Category:Hasidic singers Category:Jewish songwriters Category:Israeli male singer-songwriters Category:Israeli guitarists Category:People from Petah Tikva Category:Living people ","title":"Yosef Karduner"},{"id":"48436351","title":"Katerina Shpitsa"},{"id":"48436355","title":"Nikol Kuƒçerov√°"},{"id":"48436383","text":"Kakani Katija is a bioengineer from Hawaii. While earning her Master's and PhD in Aeronautics and Bioengineering, Katija began to study the mechanics of swimming and feeding marine organisms . Biography Kakani Katija completed her bachelor's degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics at the University of Washington in 2004. She furthered her studies, earning a Master's in Aeronautics in 2005 at the California Institute of Technology (CIT) and her Doctorate at CIT in 2010 in Bioengineering. Katija was awarded research fellowships from both the American Society for Engineering Education and the National Science Foundation to conduct graduate research. As a certified research diver, she has conducted field studies in various locations throughout the world, such as a study completed in 2009 off the coast of the Palau archipelago. The goal of this study was to understand the physics involved in the jellyfishes' movements. Instead, what they discovered was that the jellyfish not only push water into their bells, but drag an almost constant flume of water behind them. That discovery propelled Katija to study how much marine life contribute to mixing the ocean. Katija's discovery has led her to explore how much sea creatures mix fluid in the ocean at rates comparable to winds and tides. She was named an Emerging Explorer from the National Geographic Society in 2011 and as part of the award, a research dive in Panama was filmed in 2012 by National Geographic Society.

It is located behind a foreground galaxy cluster known as Abell 1703, hence its name. It has a spectroscopically determined redshift of over 7, corresponding to a light travel time of 12.9 billion years. It is located in the Canes Venatici constellation. It was discovered in 2012, by a group led by L. D. Bradley, published in The Astrophysical Journal. The C IV emission line (with a wavelength of 1548 √Ö) was detected from this galaxy, signifying triply ionized carbon. Because it takes high amounts of energy to triply ionize carbon, it may suggest that A1703 zD6 has an active galactic nucleus (AGN), or a population of very young, hot, and metal-poor stars. Subsequent investigations found that the ionization source is likely to be the latter: a cluster of stars (abbreviated SF, for star-forming region).

It provides the ability to encode a wide dynamic range, while still being compatible with the existing transmission standards in the standard dynamic range (SDR) region. This makes HLG compatible with standard dynamic range displays, reducing complexity and cost for both equipment manufacturers and content distributors. The HLG standard is royalty-free and was approved as ARIB STD-B67 by the Association of Radio Industries and Businesses (ARIB). HLG is defined in ATSC 3.0, Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) UHD-1 Phase 2, and International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Rec. 2100. HLG is supported by HDMI 2.0b, HEVC, VP9, and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, and is used by video services such as BBC iPlayer, DirecTV, Freeview Play, and YouTube. Chart showing a conventional SDR gamma curve and Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG). HLG uses a logarithmic curve for the upper half of the signal values which allows for a larger dynamic range. Technical details HLG defines a nonlinear transfer function in which the lower half of the signal values use a gamma curve and the upper half of the signal values use a logarithmic curve. E'=\\\\begin{cases} r \\\\, \\\\sqrt{E}\\\\ & 0 \\\\le E \\\\le 1,\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\\\\\ a \\\\ln(E - b) + c & 1 < E \\\\end{cases} where *E is the signal normalized by the reference white level and _E'_ is the resulting nonlinear signal *r is the reference white level and has a signal value of 0.5 * and the constants a, b, and c are defined as a = 0.17883277, b = 0.28466892, and c = 0.55991073 The signal value is 0.5 for the reference white level while the signal value for 1 has a relative luminance that is 12 times higher than the reference white level. ARIB STD-B67 has a nominal range of 0 to 12. HLG uses a logarithmic curve for the upper half of the signal values due to Weber's law. HLG does not need to use metadata since it is compatible with both SDR displays and HDR displays. HLG can be used with displays of different brightness in a wide range of viewing environments. The dynamic range that can be perceived by the human eye in a single image is around 14 stops. An SDR video display with a 2.4 gamma curve and a bit depth of 8-bits per sample can display a range of about 6 stops without visible banding. Professional SDR video displays with a bit depth of 10-bits per sample extend that range to about 10 stops. When HLG is displayed on a 2,000 cd/m2 display with a bit depth of 10-bits per sample it can display a range of 200,000:1 or 17.6 stops without visible banding. HLG increases the dynamic range of the video compared to a conventional gamma curve by using a logarithmic curve for the upper half of the signal values. HLG also increases the dynamic range by not including the linear part of the conventional gamma curve used by Rec. 601 and Rec. 709. The linear part of the conventional gamma curve was used to limit camera noise in low light video but is no longer needed with HDR cameras. HLG is supported in Rec. 2100 with a nominal peak luminance of 1,000 cd/m2 and a system gamma value that can be adjusted depending on background luminance. HLG is supported in HEVC with a formula that is mathematically equivalent to ARIB STD-B67 but has a nominal range of 0 to 1 instead of 0 to 12: V=\\\\begin{cases} \\\\sqrt{3} \\\\cdot L_c^{0.5} & \\\\frac{1}{12} \\\\ge L_c \\\\ge 0,\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\\\\\ a \\\\cdot \\\\ln(12L_c - b) + c & 1 \\\\ge L_c > \\\\frac{1}{12} \\\\end{cases} where *Lc has a nominal range of 0 to 1 and V is the resulting nonlinear signal *the constants a, b, and c are defined as a = 0.17883277, b = 0.28466892, and c = 0.55991073 History = Inception = On May 15, 2015, the BBC announced that they had begun work with the NHK to develop a joint HDR proposal that would be proposed to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

The new line will, when fully completed, be long, will serve 27 stops, and will operate from Z√ºrich Altstetten to Killwangen via Farbhof, Schlieren, Urdorf, Dietikon and Spreitenbach. The Limmat Valley is a major transport corridor. Its first railway was the first line in Switzerland, the so-called Spanisch-Br√∂tli-Bahn that opened in 1847, and that line now carries long distance passenger trains, freight trains and suburban trains of the Z√ºrich S-Bahn. However the stations of the S-Bahn are well separated, with only five stations in the distance to be covered by the Limmattal line. The Limmattal tramway provided more local transport from 1900, but closed in stages between 1928 and 1955, being replaced by buses. The roads of the Limmat Valley are now at capacity, leading to delays to both bus and car traffic. It estimated that traffic will continue to grow, with 113,000 extra journeys a day by 2030. It is against this background that the Limmattal light rail line was proposed as a solution. Planning began in 2000, and by 2007 the line was included in the cantonal plans of Aargau and Z√ºrich. In 2010, the Limmattalbahn AG company was founded by the cantons to plan and implement the infrastructure for the line. A referendum, held in November 2015, approved the construction of the line, and it was announced in May 2016 that the line would be operated by BDWM Transport, who also operate the Bremgarten‚ÄìDietikon line. Construction commenced in August 2017, and phase 1 between Farbhof and Schlieren opened in September 2019. A further referendum called by opponents in the canton of Z√ºrich in an attempt to have phase 2 cancelled was defeated, and the line is expected to be fully opened throughout in 2022. When fully open, light rail trains will run every 15 minutes between Z√ºrich-Altstetten and Killwangen-Spreitenbach stations, with the ability to later increase the frequency to every 7.5 minutes. The line will be double-track throughout, and over 90% segregated from road traffic. The stretch of the line between Farbhof and Schlieren is already used by an extension of Z√ºrich tram route 2, running every 7.5 minutes and replacing the existing Z√ºrich trolleybus route 31 over that stretch. This section will continue to be served by both services once the whole line is opened. The Limmattal and Bremgarten‚ÄìDietikon lines will also share a short section of track on the existing alignment of the latter in the centre of Dietikon. From Farbhof to Schlieren the line is electrified at 600 V DC for compatibility with the Z√ºrich tram network, and the section of phase 2 between Altstetten and Farbhof will also be electrified at this voltage. The rest of the line will be electrified at 1200 V DC, which is also used by the Bremgarten‚ÄìDietikon line. A joint order, with Baselland Transport, has been placed with Stadler for the supply of new light rail vehicles to operate the service from Altstetten to Killwangen. The Limmattal portion of this order is for eight long and wide double-ended Citylink vehicles, with an option for up to eight more, for which a depot is to be constructed between Dietikon and Spreitenbach. The extension of Z√ºrich tram line 2 is operated by the existing single-ended Z√ºrich tram fleet, for which a turning loop has been provided at Schlieren.

Reviews On the original publication of the novel a reviewer in The Sydney Mail stated: \\"It is undoubtedly one of the best and most effectively written Australian novels that has yet appeared. It has humour, as one might expect from the author of Three Goats on a Bender; it has beauty of phrase and word, as is natural from a pen that has produced verse of no mean order; but it has also that insight, sincerity, and power without which no story, however good, can really 'live' in the world of letters. This is high praise; but Earth's Quality deserves it, and no critic worthy of the name can come across so rightful an opportunity of expressing his delight without seizing that opportunity with joy and alacrity.\\"\\"Some Novels and a Biography\\", The Sydney Mail, 13 March 1935, p20 A reviewer in The Age was a little more critical: \\"Miss Birkett is not very successful in portraying woman characters, and her story is somewhat bare of incident, but the literary quality of her book lifts it much above the level of most Australian novels.\\"\\"New Novels\\" The Age, 23 March 1935, p4 Awards and nominations * 1935 winner ALS Gold Medal\\"Gold Medal ‚Äì Australian Literary Society\\" The Canberra Times, 31 October 1936, p2 References Category:1935 Australian novels Category:ALS Gold Medal winning works Category:Novels set in New South Wales Category:Angus & Robertson books ","title":"Earth's Quality"},{"id":"48436518","text":"Alexander Macduff Baxter (25 June 1798 - 11 March 1834) was a Scottish- Australian lawyer and politician who served as Attorney General of New South Wales between 1827 and 1831. The Governor of New South Wales, Sir Ralph Darling, considered him to be incompetent and tried to persuade the Colonial Office to dismiss him, but Baxter resigned in order to become a judge in Tasmania. In Tasmania, the Lieutenant-Governor, Sir George Arthur, managed to prevent Baxter from taking up his post. Baxter returned to England later in 1831 and died in 1834.  Early life  Alexander Baxter was born at Monzievaird in Perthshire to the Reverend Colin Baxter and Jacobina Macduff in 1798. He was admitted as a barrister in London in 1819, but his career was unsuccessful and Baxter remained dependent on his father who sought help from Sir George Murray. Sir George was a Member of Parliament for Perthshire who would become Colonial Secretary in 1828. As a result, in 1826, Baxter was nominated as Attorney General of New South Wales.  New South Wales and Tasmania  Just as in London, Baxter's legal career in Sydney was not a success. Within two months of taking up his post, the Governor, Sir Ralph Darling, wrote to the Colonial Office to complain that he was totally inexperienced and incapable of speaking effectively in court. Professionally incompetent, Baxter relied heavily on the new Solicitor General, William Foster and even sought help from other lawyers. Alexander Baxter became a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1829 but continued to fail to gain the Governor's confidence. The Governor and Chief Justice were sometimes required to draft legislation; work that should have been done by Baxter. In 1831, Baxter resigned his post to take up the position of second judge on the Supreme Court of Tasmania. However, in Hobart, the Lieutenant- Governor was appalled by his behaviour and decided that it would have been \\"a violation of all public decency to have suffered him to take his seat on the Bench\\". Sir George Arthur agreed to a request for leave of absence from Baxter as a means of getting rid of him.  Private life  In March 1827, shortly before leaving for New South Wales, Baxter married Maria del Rosario Anna Uthair, a Spanish heiress. Their son was born in Sydney on 24 August 1828. Baxter fell out with his wife over his lavish spending, which led to his bankruptcy. He became an alcoholic and attacked her violently after she gave birth to twin daughters. When she had the daughters baptised in the Roman Catholic faith, he left her, taking his young son with him, and Governor Darling helped Maria to return to England. As a widow, in 1836, she was still trying to recover jewels and other property that had been seized in Sydney to repay her husband's debts.  Return to England  Baxter left Tasmania late in 1831. The following year he was imprisoned for debt for 12 months in Marshalsea prison. Baxter died at Onchan on the Isle of Man in 1834.

Early life  Jones was born at Chirbury in Shropshire to Thomas Bowdler Jones, small landowner and brewer, and Elizabeth Ann (n√©e) Philips. He was a clerk in London before migrating to New South Wales, where he became a merchant and pastoralist. In 1823 he married Mary Louisa Peterson, with whom he had eight children.  Politics  On 30 January 1829, Jones was an appointed member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, a role he held until 5 January 1843. In 1832, the Council changed from a fully appointed body to become a body of 36 members with 12 appointed and 24 elected. From 17 July 1843 Jones continued as an appointed member of the Council. However, even as he appointed, his merchantile business was suffering in the economic downturn that prevailed from 1842 to 1844. In August 1843, he was unable to pay debts of ¬£180,000 and he became insolvent in October 1843, forcing him to resign from the Council, effective 1 November 1843. Barrister Robert Lowe was appointed to the Council to replace him. Having moved to Brisbane (then part of New South Wales but later in Queensland), on 1 October 1850 Jones was elected as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council representing the electoral district of Counties of Gloucester, Macquarie, and Stanley (Brisbane being within the County of Stanley).

The meeting house, which was completed in December 2000, was designed and built to house the Live Oak Friends Meeting, which was formed in 1954. The building features a permanent installation by the artist James Turrell, known as the Skyspace or One Accord. It has been described as an architectural \\"idealization of Quaker testimonies like peace and equality.\\" Live Oak Friends Meeting Live Oak Friends Meeting (LOFM) is a monthly meeting (congregation) of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Houston, Texas. The Meeting is a Liberal Quaker meeting and worships in the traditional unprogrammed style. The Meeting is a member of Bayou Quarterly Meeting and South Central Yearly Meeting and is associated with Friends General Conference. The meeting has approximately 75-100 attendees. The Meeting was founded in 1954, when a group met at the home of Walter and Myra Whitson. Members of the meeting met for many years in temporary spaces, including a Jewish community center, a Presbyterian manse, the Chocolate Bayou Theater, and a dance studio. They acquired two acres on which to build, but lacked resources to do so. The Meeting House Hiram Butler, a Houston gallery owner, connected the Live Oak meeting with Arizona- based artist James Turrell. Turrell, a Quaker himself, was fascinated by light. He saw the Live Oak meeting house as an opportunity to combine his art and his religious faith by creating a working space for religious worship that would embody the Quaker belief in inner divinity, often spoken of as the \\"light within\\". In turn, partnering with the artist offered new possibilities for raising funds for creation of the meeting house, by soliciting funds from the Houston arts community. Members of the Live Oak Friends Meeting were deeply concerned about whether the creation of an expensive building, with outside funding, could be reconciled with the Quaker Testimony of Simplicity. Members of the community resolved their concerns in part by working out issues through the consensus-based processes of Quaker meeting with James Turrell and architect Leslie K. Elkin. Members of the meeting worked with architect Leslie K. Elkin and artist James Turrell to design the building. The meeting raised half a million dollars, about 1/3 of the total cost of the project. The rest of it was funded through gifts from outside individuals, corporations and foundations, to a nonprofit established for the project. Groundbreaking for the building occurred in October 1998. The building was completed in 2000 and opened to the public in 2001. The design of the meeting house draws upon early Quaker meeting houses such as the Gunpowder Friends Meeting House in Sparks, Maryland and the 1684 Third Haven Meeting House in Easton, Maryland. The long house form of the building was suggested by the Gunpowder Meeting House. Third Haven's white oak benches were the basis for the benches of the Live Oak Meeting House. Turrell was also inspired by his childhood memories of meeting for worship. The three-room meeting house has a broad metal roof, supported by large timbers. Wide overhanging eaves create a nine-bay facade, with doorways in the even-numbered sections. The flooring is made of sinker pine which was salvaged from the Trinity River and cut specifically for the meeting house. Its long submersion has given the wood a greenish tint. Inside the main room, benches are arranged in a square. Above the center of the square is Turrel's Skyspace installation. The Skyspace The Skyspace consists of a 12-foot- square opening in the roof, with a retractable cover that can be opened to the sky. When the roof is not open, a system of hidden neon tubes fills the Skyspace with blue light. This permanent installation by artist James Turrell was originally known simply as the Skyspace. More recently it has been referred to as One Accord, to differentiate it from other installations of skyspaces by Turrell. Between 2008-2010, the Skyspace could not be used. It had to be redesigned and renovated to address damage to the retractable roofing system. The rails supporting the hatch were originally made of wood covered in metal. Due to the semitropical climate the wood had begun to rot. The new design replaced the metal-covered wood with a square metal pipe, braced at the sides. The new design was expected to be both water- and hurricane-proof. The space was again closed and repaired between 2013 and 2015, because of flooding from a broken pipe. As of February 27, 2015, openings resumed on Friday evenings and on the first Sunday evening of the month. Emphasis on and utilization of natural light is seen as a guiding principle in the architecture of more modern Quaker meeting houses. The Live Oak Meeting House has been described as the most spectacular example of this style.

While in this role Snodgrass despatched a Sydney mounted police detachment to pursue the Namoi, Weraerai and Kamilaroi people who had killed five stockmen in separate incidents on recently established pastoral runs in the upper Gwydir River area of New South Wales. Tragically this led to the events in January 1838 which became known as the Waterloo Creek massacre (or the Australia Day Massacre). On 26 January 1838, a New South Wales Mounted Police detachment led by Major James Nunn murdered perhaps 40 to 50 men, women and children. (Some historians claim up to 300 people were killed).R.

The park is managed by Scenic Hudson and is part of the Palisades Interstate Park system. History The land comprising Franny Reese State Park was once an estate known as \\"Cedar Glen\\", built in the mid-19th century by painless dentistry pioneer Charles H. Roberts. After Roberts' death, the estate fell into disrepair as his heirs fought over ownership of the property. The property was purchased in 2003 by Scenic Hudson, a not-for- profit environmental organization that aims to conserve land along the Hudson River between Albany and New York City. It opened as a state park in 2009, shortly after the land's ownership was transferred to the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, although Scenic Hudson continues to manage the property. The park is named for environmentalist Frances \\"Franny\\" Reese (1917-2003), who worked to conserve lands in the Hudson River region. Park description Franny Reese State Park's main feature is its of hiking trails along old carriage roads that may also be used for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing in the winter. The trails offer views of the Hudson River, the nearby Mid-Hudson Bridge, the Walkway over the Hudson, and the City of Poughkeepsie across the river.

Background The May 31, 1969 issue of The Black Panther called for a \\"Revolutionary Conference for a United Front Against Fascism,\\" to be held in Oakland in July of that year. The announcement drew links between the killing of James Rector and the imprisonment of Huey Newton, and outlined the purpose of the conference: it would develop a political programme representing the \\"poor, black, oppressed workers and people of America\\", involving strategies for community control of policing, the release of political prisoners, the expulsion of the military from college and university campuses, and community self-defense. Event Around 5,000 people responded to the call, including members of the Communist Party USA, the Peace and Freedom Party, the Progressive Labor Party, the Red Guard Party, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), the Third World Liberation Front, the Young Lords, the Young Patriots Organization, the Young Socialist Alliance and various groups associated with the women's liberation movement. Events took place in the Oakland Auditorium and DeFremery Park. Delegates included Asian Americans, Latinos and other people of color, but the majority in attendance were white. Members of SDS were ejected from the auditorium for \\"disruptive behavior,\\" and the following day distributed pamphlets which accused organizers of excluding them. Speeches were given on the first day of the congress. The second day was devoted to workshops on issues around fascism, gender, workers and students, political prisoners, health, religion, state repression of political dissent and policing. Speakers included Bob Avakian and Jeff Jones of SDS; Elaine Brown, who presented a letter from Ericka Huggins who was at that time incarcerated; the politician Ron Dellums; and the lawyers Charles Garry and William Kunstler, the latter of whom discussed the 1967 Plainfield, New Jersey riots and argued for the legality and necessity of defensive violence. Following the congress the National Committees to Combat Fascism, a national network that sought community control of police forces, was established. Significance In 2017 the historian Robyn C. Spencer connected the UFAF to contemporary antifascism in the United States, and argued that > The history of the UFAF demonstrates that discussions about fascism in the > US are nothing new. It shifts the discussion of fascism away from an > American exceptionalist terrain where the US is compared with Europe and > government structures or despotic leaders are analyzed and instead > demonstrates the value of unearthing manifestations of fascism in the lived > experiences of Black people in the US.

He played college football for the UCLA Bruins and Michigan Wolverines. In high school he was a 2014 Under Armour All-America Game selection and subsequently played college football for the Michigan Wolverines. Speight redshirted in 2014 and was the backup quarterback in 2015. As a redshirt sophomore in 2016, he started 12 games and earned third-team All-Big Ten honors. In 2017, Speight started four games before suffering a season-ending injury. In April 2018, Speight announced that he would be transferring to UCLA. Early years Speight was born in Henrico County, Virginia, on December 6, 1994. His father, Robert Wilton Speight, Jr., played basketball, and his grandfather, Robert Wilton Speight, Sr., was a second-team All-American basketball player in 1953 who later had his jersey retired at NC State. Speight is the oldest of three brothers; his younger brothers are Griffin and Jess. Jess, earned a scholarship as a third year defensive lineman at Michigan. Speight played high school football and basketball for Collegiate School in Richmond, Virginia. He was a highly recruited Virginia high school athlete who was being recruited by the likes of Virginia Tech until a severe collarbone injury during the first game of his fall 2011 junior season that required a metal plate and eight screws to repair caused most schools to lose interest in him. Speight had previously had a medial collateral ligament injury. Speight hired quarterback guru Steve Clarkson to help him regain his form and posted 2,900 yards and 32 touchdowns in ten games during the 2012 season. He was unranked by most services at the time. A few months later after player rankings were reassessed following his second chance at his junior season in 2012, he was the number 7 ranked quarterback in the national class of 2014 according to ESPN. Other ratings services also returned him to their class of 2014 rankings: 16 by Rivals.com and 21 by Scout.com following his reclassification. Speight appeared in the 2014 Under Armour All-America Game, completing two of six passes for 63 yards. He started at quarterback and served as team captain. In 2014, Speight was named the Collegiate School's Outstanding Senior Athlete, an award given to the \\"senior boy who has contributed most to the athletic program through leadership, cooperation, sportsmanship and ability.\\" College career =Michigan= Commitment and redshirt season In early February 2013, Speight received a scholarship offer, and promptly verbally committed, to play college football at the University of Michigan. On October 16, 2013, he signed his early enrollment letter. In January 2014, he enrolled early at Michigan. He attended Michigan's spring camp in March 2014 under coach Brady Hoke. Speight redshirted his entire freshman season for the 2014 Wolverines as fifth-year senior Devin Gardner led the team. 2015 season As a redshirt freshman for the 2015 Wolverines, Speight began the season as a backup to Jake Rudock and Shane Morris. Speight made his Michigan debut on September 12, 2015, taking kneel-down snaps in the closing minutes of a victory over Oregon State. Asked why he played Speight instead of Morris at the end of the Oregon State game, head coach Jim Harbaugh explained that he did not want to burn Morris's redshirt year on a meaningless snap, emphasizing that Morris remained his No. 2 quarterback. Harbaugh ultimately decided to redshirt Morris during the 2015 season, resulting in Speight seeing playing time as Rudock's principal backup. Speight failed to complete a pass in three attempts against UNLV on September 19 and in his only pass attempt against Maryland on October 3, 2015. Speight received his first significant playing time on October 31, 2015, in the Little Brown Jug rivalry game against Minnesota. After Rudock was injured in the third quarter, Speight came into the game. With five minutes remaining and Michigan trailing 26‚Äì21, Speight led Michigan on a game-winning drive culminating in 12-yard pass to wide receiver Jehu Chesson and a pass to wide receiver Amara Darboh for a two-point conversion. Speight completed three of six passes for 29 yards and one rush for six yards. The two-point conversion gave Michigan a three-point lead that forced Minnesota into a decision to attempt to score a touchdown on the goal line as time expired. Speight had not completed any passes prior to that game. Harbaugh explained that Speight had earned the backup role in practice in the preceding weeks. Speight next saw significant playing time against Ohio State on November 28, 2015. After Rudock was injured on a sack by Joey Bosa, Speight came into the game and completed six of 14 passes for 44 yards, but also threw his first college interception on a pass tipped and caught by Bosa. Speight finished his redshirt freshman season with nine completions in 25 attempts, one interception, one touchdown pass, 145 passing yards, and a 36% completion percentage. 2016 season John O'Korn and Speight (right) were part of a preseason quarterback battle Michigan's 2016 spring practice featured a quarterback battle between Speight, redshirt junior John O'Korn, redshirt junior Shane Morris, true freshman Brandon Peters and redshirt freshman Alex Malzone. After spring practice, press reports indicated that Speight, O'Korn and Morris were leading the competition, in that order. O'Korn and Speight were the starters in the April 1 spring game. Speight passed for a touchdown and ran for another leading his team to a 14‚Äì13 win. In August 2016, Speight and O'Korn entered training camp as Michigan's quarterback frontrunners. Coach Harbaugh refused to reveal the identity of his starting quarterback prior to the opening game. On September 3, 2016, Speight was named the starting quarterback. In the opening game, Speight led Michigan to a 63‚Äì3 victory over Hawaii. On Michigan's first play from scrimmage, Speight threw an interception on an attempted screen pass to Jake Butt. For the game, he completed 10 of 13 passes for 145 yards with three touchdown passes and one interception. In his second start on September 10 against UCF, Speight completed 25 of 37 passes for 312 yards with four touchdown passes and no interceptions to earn Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week honors. On October 1, Speight's tiebreaking fourth quarter touchdown pass to Amara Darboh against #8-ranked Wisconsin lifted Michigan to its first win against a top-10 opponent since the 2008 Wolverines beat the 2008 Badgers, ending a streak of 12 consecutive such losses. After leading Michigan to a 9‚Äì0 start with a 59-3 victory in his career-high 362-yard passing performance against Maryland on November 5, Speight and Michigan lost to Iowa 14‚Äì13 on November 12. Two days later, it was reported that Speight had endured a broken collarbone during the game and was feared lost for the rest of the season. However, after missing one game against Indiana, Speight returned to the lineup to start against Ohio State in the rivalry game. He posted 2 touchdowns, but had 2 interceptions and a critical fumble in the double-overtime loss. Following the season, Speight was the third team All-Big Ten quarterback selection by both the coaches and the media (behind J. T. Barrett and Trace McSorley). During the 2016 Capital One Orange Bowl, Speight and the Michigan offense struggled to generate offense against a dominant Florida State defensive line. Michigan managed just 6 points in the first half on two field goals (from kicker Kenny Allen). Michigan rallied late in the game, including Speight's only throwing touchdown of the night, eventually taking a 30‚Äì27 lead with 1:57 remaining in the game. The lead was short-lived as Michigan gave up the game-winning touchdown with just 36 seconds remaining in the game. The ensuing Michigan possession ended with Florida State intercepting a Speight pass and running out the clock for a Florida State victory (33‚Äì32). For the game, Speight completed 21 of 38 passes (55.3%) for 163 yards with one touchdown and one interception. In 12 starts, Speight finished the year with 2,538 passing yards, 18 touchdowns, 7 interceptions, and completed 61.6 percent of his passes. 2017 season Speight entered training camp in a quarterback competition against redshirt senior O'Korn and redshirt freshman Peters and additional competition from true freshman Dylan McCaffrey, redshirt sophomore Alex Malzone, and Mike Sessa. He won the competition and started Michigan's opener against Florida on September 2, beating the Gators 33-17. However, Speight endured a back injury on September 23 against Purdue, causing him to be sidelined for several weeks. On November 13, head coach Jim Harbaugh stated that Speight was cleared to participate in non-contact football activities. On November 26, 2017, Speight announced he would be transferring from Michigan to play as a graduate transfer at another school. =UCLA= 2018 season On April 12, 2018, Speight announced he would be transferring to UCLA for his final year of eligibility. On August 30, 2018, it was announced that Speight had been named by Head Coach Chip Kelly to be the starting quarterback for the Bruins' season opener against the University of Cincinnati.https://twitter.com/UCLAFootball/status/1035290052748697601 Unfortunately, Speight suffered a back injury in the opener (an eventual 26‚Äì17 loss) and had to be replaced with true freshman Dorian Thompson-Robinson in the 2nd quarter. Speight did not see game action again until the Bruins' matchup with the Arizona Wildcats on October 20. True freshman quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson suffered an injury in the second quarter, and Speight came in to take his place. Speight completed 17 of 27 passes for 204 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions, as the Bruins defeated the Wildcats, 31‚Äì30. On November 10, Speight posted a season-high 335 yards passing and 2 touchdowns in a 31-28 loss to Arizona State. On November 17, Speight completed 13 of 22 passes for 166 yards, one touchdown, and one interception as UCLA defeated its crosstown rival, the USC Trojans, 34‚Äì27. Speight also rushed for a touchdown against the Trojans. Professional career After going undrafted in the 2019 NFL draft, Speight signed with the San Francisco 49ers.

The complex of three buildings was developed in the 1930s by the Vermont Newspaper Corporation, and served as home for the Bellows Falls Times newspaper until 1965, when it was consolidated with other local newspapers. The main building is a particularly fine local example of Colonial Revival design. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. The building complex is located on the west side of the island formed by the Connecticut River and the Bellows Falls Canal. The main building faces south toward Bridge Street, on the east side of the canal, with a warehouse to its north. A small wood frame former garage building stands east of the warehouse, fronting on Island Street. Architecture The main building is a single-story brick structure, which is particularly notable for its front facade. The brick is laid in Flemish bond, trimmed with stone and concrete elements. A semicircular portico shelters the main entrance, with Tuscan columns supporting a modillioned cornice. The side gables have stepped ends in the Dutch Revival fashion. An ell to the rear of this building has a shed roof, and plainer styling, with a former railroad access bay at the end now enclosed to form a secondary entrance. left The warehouse is a two-story frame structure, with vertical board siding, and two rail access bays on its western (canal-facing) facade. The east facade has overhead doors for freight truck access, and also has a pedestrian entrance. The garage is a two-part structure, one with a gabled roof, the other with a parapeted flat roof. History This complex of buildings was built in the early 1930s by the Vermont Newspaper Company, publisher of the Bellows Falls Times, a weekly newspaper, as well as weeklies in other nearby communities. It was built after its previous offices in the main square were destroyed by fire. The main building was designed by Concord, New Hampshire architect Harold Holmes Owen, and is one of Bellows Falls' most fully realized examples of Colonial Revival architecture. The complex was used by the publisher until 1965, when its operations were consolidated with those of other area publishers. The buildings have since been adaptively reused by other types of businesses.

Upon Julian's death, the newly elected Emperor, Jovian, was forced into signing a humiliating treaty by which territorial and diplomatic concessions were given to the Sasanians.  Background  = Julian's preparations = After his accession to the Roman throne in A.D. 361, Emperor Julian reinitiated the war against Sasanid Persia. Over the winter of 362-63 Julian established his headquarters in Antioch, and as soon as spring arrived he was ready to take the field. Within a month of his departure from Antioch, a force of around 80,000 had been assembled at Carrhae. This army under Julian marched swiftly south-east along the river on route to Ctesiphon, the enemy capital. The remainder of the Roman forces, with the aid of the King of Armenia Arshak II, was ordered to effect a junction with the emperor before the walls of Ctesiphon, marching by way of Nisibis and along the Tigris. = Progress of the war = The southern arm of the Roman invasion met with some initial success. The Tigris was crossed, and the Sasanian army which contested its passage was defeated and penned up in Ctesiphon. After a vain attempt to penetrate further east to Susa, which Julian was forced to abandon his fleet and most of his provisions, he was at length convinced that no option remained to him but a retreat. On 26 June 363, during the Battle of Samarra, Julian was wounded. His death that night, and the subsequent election by the troops of Jovian as his successor, seemed to secure the end of the campaign.

It is also the series' 100th episode. In this episode, Emma, Snow, David, Regina, Henry, Robin, and Mr. Gold arrive in the Underworld. In flashbacks, the Evil Queen celebrates her birthday. Plot =Opening sequence= The fallen Storybrooke clock tower in the Underworld appears in the red-tinted forest. =Event chronology= The Enchanted Forest events take place after \\"Page 23\\" and some time before \\"Hat Trick\\". The Storybrooke events take place during \\"Swan Song\\", after Emma makes a deal with Mr. Gold and before the group's departure for the Underworld. The Underworld events take place after Hook's death in \\"Swan Song\\". =In the Characters' Past= In the Enchanted Forest, Prince Henry is trying to convince his daughter, Regina, still after Snow White's heart, to give up vengeance, but she is unable to let go of her anger. He turns to the Magic Mirror in desperation to speak with Cora, believing that the best way to force Regina to get over Snow White is to just help her complete her plot, which Prince Henry is not in favor of. Unknown to Prince Henry and Regina, Cora has managed to enter the realm of the Enchanted Forest through the mirror again. Later on, Prince Henry meets with Snow White in the woods. The real Prince Henry comes up behind her, and Snow realizes that the first Prince Henry was actually Cora, who rips out her heart while she is distracted. Cora takes Snow's heart to Regina as a birthday present, only to then learn that Snow switched it out with that of a guard. It turned out that Prince Henry saved Snow White by switching the hearts. A furious Regina then shrinks her father and condemns him into the very box that was holding the heart. Regina confronts Cora and sends her mother back into the mirror and seals it forever. At the last minute Cora takes the box containing her husband so Regina will be truly alone. =In the Underworld= In what appears to be a dream, Emma wakes up in a car and is greeted by Neal, who tells her that he's just sending her a \\"long distance call from an old friend.\\" He explains that he personally isn't in the Underworld, as it is only for those who have unfinished business, and that once they arrive, it's very hard to leave. Neal warns Emma not to go, but she refuses to listen to his advice and he knew she would and so he tells her he loves her and kisses her goodbye on the forehead and Emma wakes up. As Emma, Gold, Mary Margaret, David, Henry, Regina, and Robin Hood arrive in the Underworld in their quest to find Hook, the ensemble comes across a brimstone- hued version of Storybrooke. Gold tells them that every soul with unfinished business lives here until it is fulfilled, and since they have arrived that means they are ready to finish it as they were responsible, as Emma sees Cruella's car that serves as an example. As they split up Regina and Robin are being followed by a resident (the person that Regina choked back in the Enchanted Forest), who leads them to Cora, who is the mayor of the Underworld Storybrooke. Cora offers Regina a way out, telling her she has one hour to leave on the ferry with Henry and Robin. She then takes Regina to a ledge over the Phlegethon, the River of Fire. She threatens to send Regina's father to a worse place if Regina does not comply, and she uses her messenger as an example by sending him off into the flames. Around the same time, Mary Margaret enters an Underworld version of Granny's and is recognized by the Blind Witch by her smell, and is then encountered by David wearing different clothes and proceeds to kiss her, as she realizes it's James, who is the \\"Sheriff\\" in this world. Gold goes to the Underworld version of his pawn shop and encounters his father Malcolm, whose soul must live as Peter Pan. Knowing already what Gold wants, Pan is willing to make a deal with no strings attached. However, he urges Gold to leave the Underworld, telling him that the others aren't his real friends, but Gold ignores his plea, accepting some sort of potion. Pan ominously adds that he himself would be able to leave, if only he could trade places with a living soul, although Gold refuses this. As everyone meets up again, Regina tells the others about Cora's warning, while Gold gives Emma the potion he obtained, which is from DunBroch, and can be used to summon the dead by pouring it over someone's grave. Gold explains it can be used to summon Hook and ask him where he is, but will not join them as he has decided that he is returning to Storybrooke. The group travels to the site of Hook's grave (everyone in the underworld has a grave site) and Emma pours the ale of Seonaidh potion (Seonaidh is a Celtic water spirit from the Isle of Lewis) on the ground but lacks the power to bring him back, although they get a glimpse of an injured Hook before the potion wears off. Regina uses the potion and finds the soul of her father Prince Henry. Prince Henry tells Regina she has come too far to betray her friends now and tells her she must stay. Regina races to the banishment site with Henry as Cora attempts to banish the elder Henry, only to see the flames die down and a pathway to heaven open up. Since Regina has chosen to stay, remain a hero, and is no longer under the influence of her mother, Prince Henry's unfinished business is resolved. With his soul at peace, he is accepted into \\"a better place,\\" and departs the Underworld after saying goodbye to Regina and Henry, who meets his namesake for the first time. The heroes realize they could potentially rescue all the souls here, and continue their quest to find Hook with this in mind. Cora meets with the ruler of the Underworld, Hades, who wishes the heroes gone (the clock on the broken tower will tick each time a soul leaves the Underworld), and punishes Cora for her failure with an eternity as a miller's daughter once again. Production Notes This episode would become the final one that was produced by Scott Nimerfro, who died on April 17, 2016 after a battle with angiosarcoma, a cancer in the inner lining of the blood vessels.\\"Scott Nimerfro, Writer and Producer on ABC's 'Once Upon a Time,' Dies at 54\\" from The Hollywood Reporter (April 17, 2016)\\"Scott Nimerfro, ‚ÄòHannibal‚Äô and ‚ÄòOnce Upon a Time‚Äô Producer, Dies at 54\\" rom The Wrap (April 19, 2016) Reception The episode received positive reviews, but noted that there are areas the producers could make improvements on. In a review from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, \\"‚ÄúSouls of the Departed‚Äù is a story of redemption, and perhaps Season 5B could be similarly redemptive to any OUAT fans who weren't thrilled with the direction Season 5A took. I suppose we'll see. Either way, I'm in for the ride.\\"‚ÄòOnce Upon A Time‚Äô Midseason Premiere Review: Regina Comes Full Circle In ‚ÄòSouls of the Departed‚Äô\\" from Rickey.org (March 6, 2016) Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly notes in her assessment of the review: \\"Once Upon a Time has taken us pretty much everywhere in and out of fairy tale lore over the past five years: Storybrooke, the Enchanted Forest, Arendelle, Neverland. Tonight, with a return marking the show's midseason premiere, as well as its landmark 100th episode, Once gave us something old (daddy issues), something new (the Underworld), something borrowed (a potion) and something blue (that classic Hades hair),\\" but later sums up the entire episode: \\"I know we're going to be dealing with a lot of returning cast in the coming weeks, but admittedly, I was a wee bit let down by the fact this was touted as Once's big reunion episode, and the only significant people we saw from the past were Neal, Cora, and Pan. What I am happy about, though, is the prospect that Regina may end up being wholly important to this Underworld story line. Maybe she'll finally get an arc that's more than just waffling between good and evil. More importantly, it seems like everyone in the Underworld is either in cahoots with Hades or being manipulated by him in some way. Both Pan and Cora were keen on persuading their still-living significant family members, with Cora asking Regina to leave and Pan asking Rumple to save him. I'm interested in seeing exactly what's going on in this little corner of hell and exactly how Once is going to wade through this new road of storytelling.\\"Once Upon a Time recap: Souls of the Departed\\" from Entertainment Weekly (March 6, 2016) Amy Ratcliffe of IGN said of the episode, \\"The return of Once Upon a Time served as set up for the final half of Season 5. They used the Underworld to bring back a ton of characters for quick check-ins, but Neal and Henry were the only ones who really strongly impacted the story and the Storybrooke team. Emotions fell flat across the board otherwise, except for the moment where Emma briefly saw Hook. They do have a compelling enough reason to stay in the Underworld -- though why Snow and Charming would spend so much time away from their newborn confuses me -- but overall, the episode was all about getting the board ready.\\" Ratcliffe gave the episode a 7.0 rating out of 10. Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club gave the episode an excellent review, giving it a B. In her recap, she points out: \\"With ‚ÄúSouls Of The Departed‚Äù Once Upon a Time, believe it or not, has just crossed a key threshold: 100 episodes. For all this show's inanities and love of catchphrases and gaping plot holes where logic should exist, there's clearly something very compelling about Storybrooke and its residents that resonates with viewers. In my own home, it's a decent family watch, that the kids find intriguing and even occasionally scary enough not to be lame, and the adults in the house can still take an interest. And the show still finds surprising mileage out of turning fairy tale tropes on their ear, or offering different sides of characters we think we know well.\\" Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.2 out of 5.

Prior to 1943, the company operated under the name of Electrical Research Products Inc. (ERPI) Classroom Films. History =Early years as ERPI Classroom Films= In November 1928, John Otterson of Electrical Research Products Inc. decided to make use of the latest sound technology in 35mm motion pictures and apply it to the 16mm format that was gradually being adopted by colleges and schools with easier- to-use projectors. The company had already been involved with many Hollywood studios including Warner Bros. and boasted an operating business of $20 million leasing equipment to theaters. The headquarter offices were shared with its parent company AT&T; in New York City, with the Bell Labs as the research staff and Western Electric as its manufacturer.As covered by Kenneth Kaye, Chapter 1, II: http://www.kaye.com/miscellany/EBFhx.htmGeoff Alexander, Academic Films for the Classroom: A History, p. 16 At first, there was much skepticism of the value of motion pictures as an educational tool in public schools, despite mogul William Fox's willingness to spend $9 million in putting projectors into the nation's classrooms. As lampooned in The New Yorker (November 9, 1929): \\"We doubt if any director could photograph Bunker Hill for the kiddies without stopping the fighting at least once for Major Pitcairn to sing 'Sonny Boy'. We doubt if any director could photograph a major operation without interrupting it for a mandolin solo by one of the surgeons. Also, we are troubled by the haunting dread of living in a completely canned civilization where everyone will look like Clara Bow and talk like Eddie Leonard. Without doubting Mr. Fox's honorable intention, we are nonetheless anxious to know whether the talkies are going to approach science and education the way they have approached life. We want to know whether they intend to give truth a happy ending!\\" As covered by Kenneth Kaye, Chapter 1, X: http://www.kaye.com/miscellany/EBFhx.htm During its first year of operation, Otterson appointed \\"Colonel\\" Frederick L. Devereux as company head, along with Varney Clyde Arnspiger, a former superintendent of schools. Under Arnspiger, a special team of experts was assembled, among them researchers Howard Gay, Max Brunstetter and Miss Laura Kreiger, along with Dr. Melvin Brodshaug from Columbia University who would stay with the company for over two decades. Among others involved, Howard Stokes and Arthur Edwin Krows (famous for an earlier Yale Chronicles of America educational series) became leading production supervisors.Kenneth Kaye, chapter 1, XII In its early years, ERPI had competition with both the Path√© Exchange, which entered the educational market in conjunction with Harvard University, and Eastman Teaching Films, an offspring of Eastman Kodak that had invented the 16mm format along with E.I. Dupont de Nemours back in 1923. The latter company had made an estimated 300 silent (with title cards) films by the thirties (with eventually 270 silent and later sound films officially registered for copyright between 1927 and 1943). An often repeated story involved Arnsiger getting invited to an alley fist fight with an Eastman representative who feared losing a fortune with their silent films already in circulation.Academic Films, p. 16 (Later, in the 1940s, Eastman's film library would be sold to them.) Newark, New Jersey was among the first public school systems to incorporate sound movie projectors in their classrooms in 1930. During the early years, projectors were often sold with films initially, until the national total reached a thousand by 1936.Academic Films, p. 21 Until many technical problems were fixed (the best 16mm projectors were manufactured after 1933), ERPI sold both 16mm and 35mm formats.Kenneth Kaye, chapter 1, XIV James Brill, an artist, unofficially became narrator on the majority of ERPI films (and later many early EB films through the mid-fifties). His stentorian style made science and geography topics easy to understand for children. In 1930, he also helped supervise the company's first major series, profiling the musical instruments of an orchestra (i.e. The Brass Choir, The String Choir, The Woodwind Choir, The Percussion Group). These were all successfully reissued in later years before being redone in color in 1956.Three editions (2nd in 1938) per Motion Pictures 1912‚Äì1939 Catalog of Copyright Entries and Motion Pictures 1950‚Äì1959 Catalog of Copyright Entries (see links below in references)Maurice Mitchell discusses remaking films in color, with scenes from one film, in The Unique Contribution: https://archive.org/details/unique_contribution left Among the first films to be sold with text brochures to aid teachers were nature documentaries focusing on the time-lapse photography of plants and close-up footage of animals. These were credited to (George) Clyde Fisher of the American Museum of Natural History, borrowing much footage from earlier British Instructional Films. Other early films of importance included a Yale University backed Arnold Gesell covering early child development and a slow motion study of football techniques with popular coaches like Biff Jones of West Point and H.E. Von Kersburg of Harvard. Dr. Carey Croneis supervised some geology subjects and also worked on the science pavilion at the Century of Progress fair of 1933‚Äì34, which (in turn) inspired another newcomer, Edward Shumaker, to join the company and fine-tune the title logos. A renewed slogan read \\"ERPI Films bring the world to the classroom\\". In the spring of 1937, ERPI scored a surprise \\"blockbuster\\" with Adventures of Bunny Rabbit. Its widespread appeal was partly due to narrator James Brill ending with a question directed towards the kindergarten and first grade students watching, one that was repeated by their teachers: \\"And now Bunny is once more with his mother. What do YOU think he is telling Mother Gray Rabbit ‚Äì and what do YOU think Mother Rabbit is telling Bunny?\\" Animal pictures were among ERPI's (and later Britannica's) best sellers with popular late 30s and '40s titles as Three Little Kittens, Snapping Turtle and a post-war dramatization of Aesop's The Hare and the Tortoise (later redone in animation). Geography was covered with a very relatable series called \\"Children of Many Lands\\", which compared the similarities and differences of daily life outside of the United States. A typical title like Children of Japan made sure children were seen in a classroom not unlike one at home. More exotic was Attilio Gatti's filming of the \\"Dark Continent\\" in Pygmies of Africa and Amos Burg's portrait of People of Western China shortly before the Japanese invasion. Unfortunately World War II curtailed international travel and the films of this type for a while. John Walker got his start with 1938's Navajo Indians and remained a prolific producer through the early 1970s, with a particular emphasis in his later decades with animal subjects and a late 1960 \\"Problems of Conservation\\" series. Back in 1932, heads Devereaux and Arnspiger had established a very close relationship with Beardsley Ruml and Robert Maynard Hutchins of the University of Chicago, providing the films the extra prestige of scholarly credits. A promotional book The Educational Talking Picture was published by Devereaux through the University in 1933, followed four years later by Max Brunstetter's How to Use the Educational Sound Film. The close relationship between ERPI and the university tightened considerably more after John Otterson had left the company to work for Paramount Pictures in 1935. When Hutchins appointed William B. Benton as the university's vice president, his involvement with the films was much like that of a production head. By this time, the Federal Communications Commission had started pressuring the parent company AT&T; to divest its highly profitable subsidiary. After an attempt to get the Rockefeller Foundation to purchase ERPI, Benton made another unsuccessful effort with Henry Luce of Life (although the magazine giant initially saw little future in educational films, Time-Life would belatedly enter the market in the 1960s). =Merging with Encyclop√¶dia Britannica= William Benton and Robert Hutchins had established a successful relationship with chairman Colonel Robert E. Wood of the Sears, Roebuck and Company. Over a lunch meeting held December 9, 1941, Benton managed to persuade Wood to donate Sears' profitable, but aging, subsidiary Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc. to the University of Chicago outright as a tax write-off. The process of this transaction took more than a year to complete, culminating on February 1, 1943. Benton also acquired the services of EB editor Walter Yust. (His son Larry would later become a top filmmaker for the company.) In a second move, Walter Page of AT&T; and Kennedy Stevenson of Western Electric sold their interests in ERPI Classroom Films to Benton for $1 million, to be paid over the next decade. The University itself didn't own the company outright, but had the option to acquire half of Benton's stock (and soon decided not to). Benton changed the name over to Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Films because he had once heard a school child call the films \\"burpy\\" on account of the rhyming. The first titles to sport the new name were released in November 1943. Later on, titles sported a simplified \\"EB Films\\" logo. After expanding the facilities with $1.5 million invested, William Benton temporarily left to become Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs under President Harry Truman, then as a senator and arch adversary of Joseph McCarthy before returning in 1952. With Beardsley Ruml mostly in charge, a prestigious board of directors was set up. Operating as president for a time was the future Ford Fund for Adult Education head Cyril Scott Fletcher. Although production was curtailed during the war (with only two brand-new titles registered for copyright in the year 1945), profits increased dramatically as 150, 000 16mm projectors were in operation by 1946. During this mid-decade period, a great many previously released titles were successfully given new soundtracks in Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian and other languages for foreign export. Milan Herzog began a long association with EB in 1946 with The Mailman and other portraits of common occupations. He eventually became one of the most prolific producers. Popular titles later in the 1950s and 1960s include Tobacco and the Human Body and The Passenger Train (2nd edition), along with a series on the Soviet Union co-directed by Arnold Michaelis. In an effort to keep the films in line with their educational goals, music scores were rarely used prior to the late 1940s and then only selectively used with a greater focus on narration. While this occasionally made them seem a bit static and lecture-like, it also prevented them from aging fast on account of changing musical tastes (a problem with rival educational films of the period). Curiously the company was slow to make the transition to color, despite the Kodachrome 16mm process being popular with rival companies like Bailey Films and Coronet Films (starting before the war). The first color EB films were not made until 1946‚Äì47, covering painting lectures by Eliot O'Hara and scenic portraits of farm life (i.e. Spring on the Farm and Winter on the Farm). As quoted in the silver jubilee anniversary title Making Films That Teach, \\"Color is pretty but sometimes expensive for the teaching value you might get from it.\\"video: https://archive.org/details/MakingFi1954 Nonetheless, color soon became quite mainstream in the middle fifties, as EB was soon updating popular early titles with all-color remakes such as The Woodwind Choir and Spiders. In cooperation with Emerson Films, a couple dramatic biographies on famous people were produced economically in Hollywood, marking the first time hired actors were used. For a brief period, it was decided to move forward in this route and a former movie director Walter Colmes once affiliated with Republic Pictures headed the company for a two-year period before being succeeded by Maurice B. Mitchell who would bring EB Films into its most successful years. Although the overall quality of EB's product was already ahead of the competition, it had gained further esteem with the arrival of John Barnes, a veteran of CBS radio writing and some stage work. In 1951, Barnes collaborated with producer Gordon Weisenborn in People Along the Mississippi, one of the earliest school films to address the sticky topic of race relations. (One key scene shows a light-skinned Paul stop playing with his darker-skinned friend due to peer pressure.) Passionate about social rights, Barnes once personally protested the censorship of his biography Sir Francis Drake: The Rise of England Sea Power (featuring an interracial friendship) in Georgia schools. Before Brown v. Board of Education (and even years after), many public schools in the United States were still segregated by race. Therefore, EB was initially reluctant to cover many social studies subjects for fear of offending top purchasers in southern U.S. states. As reported to historian Geoff Alexander, Thomas G. Smith stated as late as the 1960s: \\"if they were filming in a classroom and there were a couple black children in the room, they'd just frame the other way. If they had to choose several kids to be featured and the black kids were taller than the rest, they'd ask for the shorter children.\\"Academic Films ... , p. 44-45 =EB's Golden Age= With Maurice Mitchell leading as company supervisor (starting in 1953), business doubled to $4,500, 000 in a few short years. Westinghouse Broadcasting and Trans-Lux (which distributed some of the films on 35mm for theaters) made some of the company's catalog available to television stations for the first time.Motion Picture Herald magazine, December 1, 1956Motion Picture Daily magazine, April 24, 1957 trade ads During this same period, Metro-Goldwyn- MayerGeoff Alexander states in Academic Films (p.28) there was a rumor circulating that MGM wanted to purchase EB Films, but Benton turned them down. and other Hollywood studios utilized Britannica's subsidiary, Films Inc. (owned since 1951), to handle the 16mm educational distribution of their theatrical material.Motion Picture Daily magazine, January 28, 1957 (details MGM's involvement); Motion Picture Daily magazine, November 28, 1960 (questions of a possible monopoly in 16mm distribution) Adding to the fortunes of the educational film industry in general was the Cold War panic imposed by the Soviet launching of Sputnik, which prompted the U.S. government to spend more federal money on America's schools in an effort to keep the nation in fierce competition. In 1958, Mitchell held a special meeting in Washington D.C. with the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Affairs to include motion pictures and other visual media in federal budgets. (He is seen lecturing on the importance of cinematic education in the following year's The Unique Contribution.) William Benton also campaigned passionately enough and helped get FCC chairman Newt Minnow, Anna Rosenberg Hoffman and Adlai Stevenson II to pressure Congress to pass the National Defense Education Act. (Stevenson soon became a chairman with Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Enterprises and not the only high profile politician to do so. Hubert Humphrey also joined after losing the 1968 United States presidential election.) One of John Barnes' 1953 contributions, The Living City, earned an Academy Award nomination. The following year, he filmed a series of historical subjects in England, among them the socially conscious The Pilgrims, Captain John Smith, Founder of Virginia, and Roger Williams: Founder of Rhode Island. Some of these gained praise even by mainstream theatrical film critics who traditionally ignored school films, like Howard Thompson of the New York Times (July 3, 1955). In addition to many artistic subjects and some of the best school films covering The Renaissance: Its Beginnings, Leonardo Da Vinci and Michelangelo, he also spearheaded a \\"Humanities\\" series sponsored in part by the Ford Foundation (which had previously back an equally ambitious, but less successful financially, Physics: The Complete Introductory Course that was co-scripted by future president Warren Everote). His coverage of Thorton Wilder's Our Town, Charles Dickens and Plato's Apology, the Life and Teachings of Socrates were all typical of Barnes' knack for making classics more entertaining to middle and high schools. Occasionally he would battle the front office for this reason, since sometimes \\"entertainment\\" was questioned in regards to \\"education\\". As Geoff Alexander profiled in a series of letters regarding his and director Douglas Campbell's treatment of Macbeth, president Maurice Mitchell had plenty to say in a letter written June 24, 1964: Barnes successfully fought back. Ever the idealist, he once stated in a 1966 interview: \\"I have an idea‚Äîa faith, I suppose it really is‚Äîthat some of my films‚Äîor a single film, or even a single sequence in a film or a shot in a film‚Äîwill light up a young mind somewhere, light it up so that nothing‚Äîunsympathetic teachers, lack of a decent place to live or lack of love‚Äîcan ever plunge it into darkness.\\" LA Times obituary (July 1, 2000): http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jul/01/local/me-46848 Meanwhile, William's son Charles Benton had troubles of his own, often dealing with his cautious father. He had joined in 1953 as an assistant to top producer Milan Herzog (and later vice president in the mid-1960s), moving up through the ranks by organizing the company's mailing lists. As marketer for Films Inc. (a subsidiary of EB) and later president of filming, Charles was most enthusiastic in adding both profits and prestige by outsourcing major companies like David L. Wolper and National Geographic Society under the EB banner. Neither the senior Benton nor co-head Mitchell was particularly supportive. Father to son (in a January 7, 1966 letter): \\"As you know, I am exceedingly uneasy about your preoccupation with products which do not carry the EBF imprimatur. I have the feeling that you hope to get something for nothing.\\" Academic Films ... , p. 93-95 Charles left in 1967 (partly pressured out by the elder Benton and Mitchell) and soon convinced EB to split off Films Inc. as a separate company with him in charge. That same year saw two other upsets to the company hierarchy. Mitchell himself accepted a chancellor job with the University of Denver that summer and was replaced by the more disciplined (keeping films under budget) Warren Everote, a veteran at EB since 1946 and previously president for a short period earlier that decade. In July, William Deneen left to start up a rival company with Columbia Pictures: the Learning Corporation of America would quickly become one of EB's biggest rivals in the 16mm field. During his past decade with EB, William Deneen's specialty was geography films, being owner of an independent film company since 1950 that was distributing through EB until they absorbed his company and made him vice president. Among his most famous in-depth looks of everyday life overseas were a series on Japan, Hungary and Communism and a trio shot on Samuel Bronston's sets of Fall of the Roman Empire, including Claudius: Boy of Ancient Rome. These were certainly the most expensive looking school films of the era, despite being made very economically. Despite dramatic changes in management, combined with some cost-cutting, the 1960s and early seventies produced many memorable classics. A Bill of Rights series both dramatized and explained major legal battles that school students often take for granted (examples include Freedom to Speak, People of New York Vs. Irving Feiner and Free Press Vs. Fair Trial By Jury- the Sheppard Case, latter produced by Stanley Croner). John Barnes, who also contributed to some of these, tackled Shaw vs. Shakespeare on the historical accuracy and personality of Julius Caesar; this was filmed in 1969 with the cast and sets of a failed British play Her First Roman. Larry Yust and Clifton Fadiman adapted Shirley Jackson's controversial short story The Lottery despite its shocking (for 1969 school students) ending. Didactic science films were not always successful in keeping bored students awake and alert, but EB fared better than much of the competition. Special praise goes to cinematographers such as the very prolific Isidore Mankofsky, who could insert many close-ups of menacing hands zooming at the screen and low-angle shots of vacationers among the geological close- ups of the typical The Beach: A River of Sand. Charles F. Finance (who carried on through the 1980s), Stanley Croner and Warren Brown were among those who contributed this and other popular favorites of the long running American Geological Institute series. 8mm loops covering chemistry and medical topics were another market tapped into at this time for the serious science student to study subjects in more detail. In addition, throughout the late 1950s and 1960s, were a wide assortment of full color biology films covering everything from protozoa to hummingbirds to veracious army ants on the hunt; many of these were produced by John Walker and Bert Van Bork. Also of particular interest was a 1971 Silent Safari series on African animals shot by Jane and Peter Chermayeff, but ignoring the usual narration so that viewers can make their own assessments of the animals' behavior. (A second series was released a dozen years later, including ostriches and wildebeest.) As the times changed, so did the popular subjects in demand. A large part of America's population and their history that had been overlooked before the civil rights movement finally got its due, such as Henry McNeal Turner in Bishop Turner: Black Nationalist and American Indian Speaks, the latter produced by longtime veteran Thomas G. Smith. The impact of the sexual revolution on teenagers opened the market for provocative subjects like Venereal Disease: The Hidden Epidemic, another Smith production and among the earliest to advocate condom use. This was another of EB's top sellers that the company had to keep pressing prints of, in part because of the uproar in the news media it caused with the more religious and conservative districts. =Post Benton Era: from 16mm movies to video to internet= With William Benton's death in March 1973 and ownership of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica moving to the Benton Foundation the following year, EB's film department entered its last two \\"twilight\\" decades as the industry leader. The gradual decline of the films' market was not noticed at first since virtually every public school system was well stocked with 16mm projectors and both EB and its rivals (Coronet, Time-Life, Learning Corporation of America and others all in fierce competition) were busy keeping up with the demand. In fact, the seventies were probably the peak decade for 16mm classroom instruction, which made the rapid decline a decade later all the more surprising. VHS and Betamax video cassettes were merely a new mid- decade novelty that was only rarely used prior to the Reagan years. Although the federal government had gradually been decreasing the amount spent on education when Carter was president, it was the mid and late eighties that saw the most rapid decline as the Cold War drew to a close and the Soviet Union was no longer a threat. After two back-to-back and very brief tenures with Jim Parton (succeeding Warren Everote) and Jack Saunders, Ross Sackett took over the same year as Benton's death. Among the popular releases of the period included Energy: A Matter of Choices (one of many ephemerals of the decade covering that \\"hot topic\\", this one produced by Charles Finance), John Barnes profiling John Keats and The Bible As Literature, a comedy pantomime series \\"Bip\\" featuring Marcel Marceau and many featurette (25+ minutes) co- productions with Avatar Learning covering earthquakes, dinosaurs and sharks. Thomas G. Smith capped off a long career with EB with the 1976‚Äì77 production of The Solar System with special computer generated effects not unlike those being used in the early Star Wars films. Sackett was followed in 1977 as president by Ralph Wagner, who had married William Benton's daughter Louise. With a tighter eye on budgets, there were increasing clashes with the filmmakers. The star director, John Barnes, particularly didn't get along well with Wagner and left soon after completing one of his most popular films, a glossy adaptation of Walter van Tilburg Clark's apocalyptic sci fi tale told in flashbacks, The Portable Phonograph. This last film of his was part of an ongoing series of short story adaptations featuring established actors (more familiar on TV and stage) and often released with an additional \\"part 2\\" reel that covered the director's commentary on the story in question. Others included The Hunt (adapted from The Most Dangerous Game by Richard Connell), J. M. Synge's Well of the Saints and Guy de Maupassant's La Paurure. Unfortunately, these ambitious miniature dramas ultimately proved too expensive to survive into the next decade. By 1980, VHS videos were beginning to be marketed alongside the 16mm films and would quickly overtake the other. A new problem soon erupted: teachers copying films to video and impacting the company's income. On June 25, 1982, New York's Board of Cooperative Educational Services was prosecuted for doing this not only by EB, but also Time-Life and the Learning Corporation of America. Although the film companies won, historian Geoff Alexander points out that \\"perhaps the most disturbing element of the case was that, more than 15 years after the halcyon days of post-Sputnik government largesse, BOCES found it financially more viable to defend a costly lawsuit than to simply buy films and tapes from film companies as it once did.\\" Academic Films ... , p. 194 Not that educational film making showed any decline in quality as the revenue dried up. There was little question that the product of this last great decade was slicker and more sophisticated in visual appeal than a great many films previously. Particularly popular throughout the eighties was Bruce Hoffman's cluster of \\"inside the human body\\" titles that benefited greatly from the ever advancing developments in microphotography combined with expert animation by David Alexovich. Later that decade, the Benson Foundation donated all Britannica properties to the University of Chicago. Ralph Wagner left the presidency at the end of 1987, with an ex-Coronet Films Joe Elliott now taking over. By this time, 16mm films had pretty much been replaced by video cassettes although a few (mostly foreign language versions of older titles) films continued to be distributed to libraries and schools as late as 1991. Longtime vice president assistant Philip Stockton remained as vice president of film/video production under Elliott until 1994 (being succeeded by William Bowe) and kept an ongoing, if declining, annual output that included a multi-part short subject series Science Essentials (a few produced by Stockton and many featuring animation by Steve Boyer), Viruses: What They Are And How They Work (a latter day production from veteran Bert Van Bork with Bill Gudmundson), Judith Conaway's For Your Baby (which continued a tradition going back the early ERPI era with Arnold Gesell), David Wood and Scott Shearer's Mathsense series and, co-produced with York Films, A Galactic Encyclopedia The shrinking market for educational media eventually hit the company hard and production came to a halt in 1995. The University of Chicago sold its financially struggling EB properties in January 1996 to Jacqui Safra for $135 million. CEO Don Yannias, appointed the following year, refocused attention to CD-ROM and the internet (with limited DVD attention). This officially ended an era. =Renewed interest = In recent years, the higher-than-average quality of EB films have enjoyed renewed interest as some titles gradually fell into public domain and are easily viewed on YouTube and the Internet Archive. Because the company made comparatively fewer social guidance films than rivals like McGraw-Hill and Coronet (the type that are often ridiculed today with the changing social customs) and the producers were very cautious in their choices of narration and music, many of these films tend to be viewed as less \\"dated\\" today than other non-theatrical ephemerals.

He took part in the War of the Navarrer√≠a in 1276‚Äì77 and in the Aragonese Crusade in 1284‚Äì85. Eustache was probably born in the hamlet of Beaumarchais, now part of Othis, into a family of the petty nobility. He first entered royal service as guardian of the abbey of Aurillac. In 1257, Count Alphonse of Poitiers appointed him bailiff of the royal part of the Auvergne, which Alphonse held as an appanage. Eustache continued as bailiff down to 1266, when he was succeeded by Geoffroy de Montirel. In 1268, Alphonse, who was also Count of Toulouse, named him his seneschal in Poitou. Alphonse died in 1271 and his counties escheated to the crown, but Eustache continued in the seneschalate of Poitou until 1276. In 1272, Eustache was appointed royal seneschal in Toulouse, a post he held until his death. It was in his capacity as seneschal of Toulouse that he was sent with an army to Navarre in 1276, to put an end to the civic unrest and stave off invasion by Aragon and Castile. The French crown had an interest in Navarre, since the heir to the French throne, Philip, was betrothed to the Navarrese queen, Joan I. In 1279, Eustache and Imbert de Beaujeu were appointed joint military commanders in Languedoc, a position they held until 1282. In 1283, the king ordered Eustache to make an examination of the Coutumes de Toulouse, the customary law of Toulouse. In 1286 he ordered the Toulousains to swear an oath to uphold the Coutumes. In 1280, Eustache became one of the king's knights. In 1284‚Äì85, he took part in King Philip III's disastrous invasion of Catalonia. Philip did manage to captured the city of Girona, over he which he made Eustache governor. Philip died late in 1285, and in February 1288 his successor confirmed Eustache as a royal knight and seneschal of Toulouse in letters patent. In 1291, Eustache exchanged some property with the king. In the county of Toulouse, Eustache oversaw the construction of 22 bastides: Rimont (1272), Alan (1272), Montr√©jeau (1272), Fleurance (1274), Valence-d'Albigeois (1275), Beaumont-de-Lomagne (1279), Verdun-sur-Garonne (1279), Saint-Lys (1280), Mirande (1281), Pavie (1281), Caz√®res (1282), Cologne (1284), Mi√©lan (1284), Plaisance-du-Touch (1285), R√©jaumont (1285), Pampelonne (1285), Boulogne-sur-Gesse (1286), Valentine (1287), Aurimont (1287), Beaumarch√©s (1288), Grenade-sur-Garonne (1290) and Sorde (1290).

The team began and ended as a duo consisting of Naomi and Tamina, but for most of its time was a trio also including Sasha Banks, who joined in July 2015 as part of the Divas Revolution storyline and left the team in February 2016. Both Naomi and Tamina are members of the Anoa ªi professional wrestling family.  History  = Formation and beginnings = In May 2015, Naomi aligned herself with her real life cousin-in-law Tamina Snuka, after having been outnumbered by The Bella Twins (Brie and Nikki Bella) on multiple occasions. Tamina and Naomi went on to defeat The Bella Twins in a tag team match at Payback. = Divas Revolution = On the July 13 episode of Raw, after weeks of being outnumbered by The Bella Twins and their ally Alicia Fox, WWE authority figure Stephanie McMahon called for a \\"revolution\\" in the WWE Divas division and introduced then debuting NXT Women's Champion Sasha Banks as an ally to Naomi and Tamina, after bringing in Charlotte and Becky Lynch to ally with Paige, leading to a brawl between the three teams. At Battleground, a triple threat match took place with Sasha Banks representing Team B.A.D. against Charlotte of Team Paige (later known as Team PCB), and Brie Bella for Team Bella in a losing effort while Charlotte picked up the victory. The following night on the July 20 episode of Raw, Naomi and Sasha Banks were victorious in a tag team match against Paige and Becky Lynch. The three teams would ultimately face off at SummerSlam in a three team elimination match, where Team B.A.D. were the first team to be eliminated courtesy of Team Bella when Tamina was pinned by Brie, and Team PCB would win the match. After defeating then Divas Champion Nikki Bella by submission in a non-title match on the August 17 episode of Raw, Banks participated in the first ever Divas number one contender's Beat the Clock challenge, in which she fought Paige to a time limit draw and Charlotte was named the number one contender. Following this, Banks began a short feud with Paige and defeated her twice on the September 7 and 14 episodes of Raw, and fought to a no contest on the September 10 episode of SmackDown. Although she lost in a fatal four-way number one contender's match for Charlotte's Divas Championship in November, Banks started a winning streak, defeating the likes of Brie Bella Alicia Fox, and Becky Lynch, whom she again defeated after distractions by Naomi and Tamina on the TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs kickoff show on December 13. = Banks' split and dissolution = Banks returned at the Royal Rumble pay-per- view on January 24, 2016 after about a month off television, attacking Charlotte and Becky Lynch after their Divas Championship match, showing her intentions to challenge for the championship. Prior to a match with Lynch on the February 1 episode of Raw, Banks claimed that she was \\"on her own\\", signaling that she had moved on from the group, at which Naomi and Tamina declared that there were no hard feelings; however, during Sasha's match with Lynch, the duo attacked Banks until she was saved by Lynch, turning Banks into a face in the process. The feud between Banks, Naomi and Tamina would continue throughout February, and would lead to a tag team match at Fastlane on February 21, where Naomi and Tamina lost. Team B.A.D. & Blonde members, walking to the ring before their match at the WrestleMania 32 event in April 2016 After their feud with Banks, Team B.A.D. formed a brief alliance with Lana, Emma and Summer Rae, and on the March 14 episode of Raw, they defeated Alicia Fox and Brie Bella after a distraction by Lana. Team B.A.D. allied with her later in a segment backstage after confronting Paige, and later allied with Emma and Rae the week after on Main Event. The following week on Raw, they accompanied Emma to her match against Paige, where Emma won, after which they attacked Paige's allies (Alicia Fox, Brie Bella and Natalya) before they were saved by a returning Eva Marie. As a result, a 10-Diva tag team match between the two newly dubbed alliances, \\"Team Total Divas\\" and \\"Team B.A.D. & Blonde\\", was announced for the WrestleMania 32's pay-per-view pre-show. At the event on April 3, they were defeated by Team Total Divas after Naomi submitted to Brie Bella.

Plot Norwark's field director, \\"Pop\\" Hussey (Noah Beery Jr.), has a lot of trouble. His airport is well equipped, but a high-voltage line, located on the edge, leads the administration to close it and is given two months to find a solution. Hussey does not have the money to move the line, and the municipality is turning a deaf ear. The CAA inspector is still present, when a student pilot crashes at the landing, after narrowly avoiding power lines! \\"Spinner\\" McGee (Phil Regan) is a Midway Airlines pilot who hauls mail at night. Apart from his service with which he takes great liberties, he is a true romantic and is often love-struck. After a hectic flight where McGee, too, narrowly avoided high voltage cables, he meets the beautiful air hostess Maxine (Jean Parker). He learns at the same time that he is suspended for two months, because of his repetitive delays and bad judgment. He then opens a flying school, with much publicity; success is at hand, to the point that his success endangers the mail flights. One day, he is test-flying a new aircraft that interests the coastguard. But he is very late, and his mechanic takes his place, who dies in a crash. McGee feels this loss very strongly. \\"Pop\\" Hussey eventually interests the local authorities in the future of his airport, stressing he needs help. While the notables are in an aircraft piloted by Roscoe Turner, the mayor, from the air, can address the crowd below. But the aircraft has engine trouble and must land immediately but the electrical wires are in its path. Just then, an aircraft piloted by McGee, suddenly cuts in front of them, before crashing into the ground. The airliner, and its passengers and pilot are saved, while McGee is taken to the hospital, where he finds Maxine running to console him.

In 2009, he was appointed chair of the Toronto Port Authority, and in 2014 he was appointed the chair of the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority. Family He has 2 children, a boy born in 2006 and a girl born in 2004. Mark is married. Early years In 1982, when McQueen was just 16, Time published a photo he took of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, when they were on an official visit to Ottawa. In a 2009 profile in the Toronto Star, Linda Diebel noted that comments 21-year-old McQueen made from the floor during the 1986 convention that chose Brian Mulroney as the leader of Progressive Conservative Party had triggered an admiring reply from Mulroney, and had triggered coverage of McQueen in a column by Dalton Camp. Career When Mulroney became Prime Minister, McQueen worked in the Prime Minister's Office, as Chief of Staff Hugh Segal's executive assistant. After leaving the PMO in 1993, Matthew Barrett, then the chair of the Bank of Montreal encouraged him to go into banking. McQueen worked briefly as a teller, before joining the bank's fund management department. In 2000 he founded his own investment fund, Wellington Financial. In 2008 McQueen was appointed to the Toronto Port Authority. On July 30, 2014, Lisa Raitt, Minister of Transport, appointed McQueen the chair of the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, together with two other directors, and the authority's President and CEO. While noting that McQueen and the other three appointees did have significant financial expertise, they noted that none of the appointees had ties to the Windsor region. Tom Mulcair, leader of the opposition in the Canadian Parliament, noted that three of the first four appointees were donors to the Conservative Party of Canada. Ed Arditti, of the online news site Windsor Square suggested McQueen's appointment was linked to the Mulroney administration's struggles with Matty Moroun, who owned the Ambassador Bridge, the original bridge over the Detroit River. McQueen was replaced as chair of the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority by former Liberal MPP Dwight Duncan on January 1, 2016.

Lake Horowhenua dispute Lake Horowhenua, is a lake in the Horowhenua region, next to the town of Levin. The Maori tribe Muaupoko own the land surrounding the lake and the lake bed through a trust. For Muaupoko the lake is of central importance, and three hundred of their ancestors are buried under the lake bed. Due to years of pollution it is one of the most polluted lakes in New Zealand, with water quality so bad that ingesting it could potentially kill a small child. There is also a grievance over the use of motorboats on the lake, as the New Zealand Listener described: > Since the 1950s, the lake owners have raised objections to motor-powered > boats because of the noise, the risk of pollution and the churning up of the > water under which their ancestors lie. Accordingly, power boats are allowed > on the lake only in specific circumstances and with express approval from > the board ‚Äì a requirement flouted for so long, according to Taueki, that > many club members are not even aware of it. Since 2004, Philip Taueki, a member of Muaupoko tribe and a former accountant has lived in a building on land next to the lake campaigning against the continued degradation of the lake. This has brought to Taueki into conflict with the rowing and sailing clubs who use the lake over the use of motorboats on the lake. As a member of Mauapoko, Taueki is a beneficial owner of the lake and the domain surrounding it. Taueki had also been given \\"authority of the Trust to ensure that the bylaws were complied with and, in particular, that boats going on the lake were washed down and did not cause further contamination\\".Taueki v R [2013] NZSC 146 at [24]. Assault on Sailing Club members On 14 September 2008, Taueki drove up to the Horowhenua Sailing Club building and got out of his car before shouting at club members about to launch a motorboat into the lake.Taueki v R [2013] NZSC 146 at [5]. Taueki was attempting to tell the Club members not to take the boat onto the lake. In the course of this heated discussion with club members, Taueki pulled a club member off the motorboat, \\"by grabbing his clothing around the chest and neck area\\", as the boat sat on its trailer about to be launched.Taueki v R [2013] NZSC 146 at [6]-[7]. As a result of this altercation Taueki was charged with the assault with which this appeal is concerned. Two further charges of assault were laid in relation to a continuing physical conflict with club members.Taueki v R [2013] NZSC 146 at [8]. Legal background The status of the land where the dispute took place is complex. Although Muaupoko continued to own the lake and most of its surroundings, the Reserves and Domains Act 1953 had declared that some Muaupoko owned land and the lake's surface to be in the public domain, managed and controlled by a Domain Board.Taueki v R [2013] NZSC 146 at [66]. As such the assault took place on land which was owned by the Muaupoko trust but vested within the public domain. The shore of Lake Horowhenua. At trial in the District Court, Taueki attempted to use section 56 of the Crimes Act 1961 to justify his assault on the club member in the boat: > s 56 Defence of land or building (1) Every one in peaceable possession of > any land or building, and every one lawfully assisting him or acting by his > authority, is justified in using reasonable force to prevent any person from > trespassing on the land or building or to remove him therefrom, if he does > not strike or do bodily harm to that person. Taueki was convicted of assault in the District Court and had his appeal dismissed in the Court of Appeal. He appealed to the Supreme Court. Judgment Justice McGrath delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court dismissing Taueki's appeal. The Supreme Court clarified the meaning of possession and peaceable possession in the context of the defence of property. On possession, they held: > Possession, as required by s 56, accordingly turns on whether the person > raising the defence has actual control over the property in question. > Whether a person has sufficient control to be in possession is a factual > question turning on all the circumstances including, for example, the nature > of the land in question and the manner in which it is usually enjoyed.Taueki > v R [2013] NZSC 146 at [58]. On the definition of peaceable possession they ruled that: > Overall, the meaning of \\"peaceable possession\\" which best fits the context > of the Crimes Act is simply possession that has been achieved other than in > the context of an immediate or ongoing dispute. In brief, it is possession > obtained and maintained before the employment of the physical force the use > of which the person seeks to justify.Taueki v R [2013] NZSC 146 at [64]. In determining whether Taueki was in peaceable possession the Court held: > But we are satisfied that Mr Taueki was not in possession of that area as > required by s 56. While the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Act reserved > to the Maori owners, of whom Mr Taueki was one, the \\"free and unrestricted > use\\" of the lake and domain, this right of access to the lake and land does > not confer any control over, or amount to possession of, the same especially > given the nature of the land as a public domain. Nor is there any evidence > that Mr Taueki had asserted or was exercising any actual control over the > part of the domain in front of the clubhouse. He was not occupying the area > where the incident occurred nor using it for his own purposes. On the other > hand, the Club was actively occupying the area for its own purposes. On > these facts, Mr Taueki did not have actual control. Given that Mr Taueki was > not in possession of the land where the assault took place, the issue of > \\"peaceable\\" possession does not squarely arise.Taueki v R [2013] NZSC 146 at > [67]. The Court also held that in order for force to be reasonable, the person using it will normally need to have given a trespasser notice that they are trespassing and a reasonable opportunity to leave.Taueki v R [2013] NZSC 146 at [69]. In addition, the Court held that a defendant could not rely on a mistaken belief as to whether they were in peaceable possession of the land or whether the other party was trespassing.Taueki v R [2013] NZSC 146 at [73].

Etymology During the Spanish invasion of the Philippines, stories from old folks revealed that the Spaniards are exploring every place to study, learn and try to understand the different Filipino cultures. They would frequently asked questions about something that caught their keen interests. An anecdote was told that one of the incidences that occurred during those times was about a group of Spaniards who lost their way. The place of Mampirao today was then thickly covered by forest. As they trekked along a very small path and reached at a crossroad, the Spaniards saw a native indio and consequently asked about the name of place. The indio without knowledge of the Spanish language, hence, he did not understand what the Spaniards were asking, and instead sensing that he was asked about what he was doing, he immediately responded that he was just \\"nagpipirao\\" which means \\"sleeping\\". Accordingly, the Spaniards understood that the name of the place was \\"Mampirao\\" as they have difficulty in pronouncing the world \\"nagpipirao\\". Another account states that \\"mampirao\\" was derived from \\"mam-irao\\" which means a place where you can find an air-plant called \\"irao\\". Thus, later it became \\"mampirao.\\" Geography and Demographics Barangay Mampirao is classified as a rural place composed of 7 purok/zones.

Bhd. Located on the edge of Ipoh's Old Town, close to the Kinta River. Within walking distance of the well-known Panglima Lane (Concubine Lane), it is the #1 attraction in Ipoh on TripAdvisor. Originally the home of the Hakka Tin Miners Club, founded in 1893. The building was rebuilt in 1929 to replace the earlier double-storey club house on the same site. This unique museum encompasses approximately 5000 square feet over three floors. On display are artifacts, collectibles, ephemeras and also photographs from the 19th and 20th century. True to life murals painted by local students of the Perak Institute of Art (PIA) provides the experience of a tin mine. Opening in February 2015, the museum attracted more than 6000 visitors in the first six months and is steadily increasing. It is open from Tuesday to Sunday but visitors are required to make bookings online or in person prior to their visit.  History  The story of Han Chin Pet Soo starts in 1876 when a young man, Leong Fee, aged 19, and 16 other immigrants, arrived at a gathering of Malay huts, between the river and the jungle, then called Epoh. Here they settled to make their way in life. It is said they were \\"the only Chinamen in Ipoh\\", Leong Fee, also known as Liang Pi Joo, was born in Meixian District, Guangdong Province, China, in 1857, arriving in an old freighter at Weld Quay, Penang in 1876 to seek his fortune in Nanyang (the Southern Seas) as Malaya was known to the Chinese. Here he worked, as a cook and hawker for some 6 months before moving to Epoh the same year. He came by river from Penang, via Telok Mak Intan (now Teluk Intan). He brought with him the spiritual tablet of the deity Tua Pek Kong and first founded the Tai Pak Koong or God of Prosperity Temple alongside the Kinta River, to give thanks for their safe arrival, for the journey had been arduous and at times dangerous. While prospecting for tin he initially worked as a clerk, becoming a well-known and successful miner by the late 1880s, with sufficient money from his Ipoh mine at Ampang to make a trip back to China. He returned to Ipoh in 1889. In 1893, in the wake of 1 June 1892, \\"Great Fire of Ipoh\\" he erected some of the first brick houses in Leech Street. That same year, on the 5th day of the 5th moon, he formed the Han Chin Tin Miners' Club in a double-storey shophouse where the Villa stands today. The club membership was restricted to Hakka miners and it was a place where they could connect with their colleagues and friends from home or have a meal. Lodging house facilities were also available where relatives and friends could stay. They could also legally play mahjong as in 1897 they received a copy of a memo from the District Magistrate, Kinta to the Assistant Magistrate Ipoh, dated 1 February 1897. It reads: \\"The members of the Chinese Club, Ipoh have permission to gamble in their house pending the issue of a formal licence. Sd/- Cecil P. Villy\\". A shot of the dining table taken at the head of the table The club was run at Leong's expense until his death in April 1912, when his son Leong Yin Khean aka Liang En-Chuen, together with Lim Chang Jiu, Leong Jin Yuen, Leong Moon Chow, Leong Rui Dian, Pan Jing Ting and Sze Hua continued to sponsor the club In 1927 Leong Yin Khean purposely devalued the land and sold the house to the club members at less than the market price. In 1929 the building was renovated and extended into a three-storey villa with an added balcony and it stood proud among its neighbours just as it does today. On 5 May 1930, the 37th anniversary of the club the members held a house-warming party for their revamped building. It was lit and decorated by electricity, probably the first time that this had been done as electrical distribution only came to Ipoh that same year. All went well until 1941 when the Japanese invaded and in the confusion the building was illegally sold without the knowledge of the members and the villa was lost to them until 1945 when they were able to prove they were the rightful owners and the building was returned. In the 1960s another small renovation took place when the front windows were changed and air conditioning was installed therein. The elegantly curved bay windows had gone forever.Anderson, I. (2013/2014, December - February). Leong fee and the hakka tin miners' club. Ipoh Valley of Dreams, (22), pp. 22‚Äì23. As the great tin mining era came to an end, the number of miners gradually reduced and in 2012 there were insufficient members to be able to maintain the building. Consequently, the white ants took over the timbers while the pigeons made the balconies and bedrooms their home. The famous buildings' future was therefore in doubt. But there was good news for the club members recently voted to lease the building to ipohWorld, a heritage group dedicated to restore it, with a view to making it a tourist attraction.

The story was originally published in 1784, and has since been republished numerous times under varying titles. The narrative In 1780, the Gilbert family was settled near what was then the frontier between encroaching colonists and Native Americans. In a minor action in the American Revolution a war party from the British base at Fort Niagara, under the overall command of Colonel John Butler, swept through the area. The attack was probably in retaliation for the destruction of native towns by the Sullivan Expedition the previous year. The war party consisted of eleven people: * Rowland Monteur - Mohawk, first captain. * John Monteur - Mohawk, second in command, who was also styled captain. Roland and John were the sons of Catherine Montour, called French Catherine. * Samuel Harris, John Huston, and his son John Huston, jr.,‚Äî Cayugas. * John Fox - Delaware The other five were unidentified Senecas. The war party took the Gilbert family and some neighbors captive, fifteen people in all: * Benjamin Gilbert, aged 69. * Elizabeth, Benjamin's wife, 55. * Joseph Gilbert, Benjamin's son, 41. * Jesse Gilbert, Benjamin's son, 19. * Sarah Gilbert, Jesse's wife, 19. * Rebecca Gilbert, Benjamin's daughter, 16. * Abner Gilbert, Benjamin's son, 14. * Elizabeth Gilbert, Benjamin's daughter, 12. * Thomas Peart, Elizabeth Gilbert's son by a prior marriage, 23. * Benjamin Gilbert, a son of John Gilbert of Philadelphia, 11. * Andrew Harrigar, a hired worker, 26. * Abigail Dodson, a neighbor, 14 * Benjamin Peart, Elizabeth Gilbert's son by a prior marriage, 27. * Elizabeth Peart, Benjamin Peart's wife, 20. * Elizabeth Peart, Benjamin Peart's daughter, about nine months old. The group made the trek from Pennsylvania to Fort Niagara on foot and horseback, a journey of about a month. Although threatened with death several times the captives were generally well treated. Harrigar managed to escape en route. On reaching Niagara, Benjamin and Elizabeth Gilbert, and Jesse and Sarah Gilbert were released through the intervention of John Butler and Guy Johnson, and sent by boat to Montreal. Benjamin died on the way, but the other three safely reached their destination. The remaining captives were adopted by Indian families and spent time in Niagara and Buffalo Creek. The last were freed in 1782.

It was partly formed for the first time as a standard Red Army rifle division a few months after the German invasion, but the formation process appears to have been abandoned and the unit was never assigned to the front. A second formation began in April 1942 and was completed on June 16, after which it was sent to the Kalinin Front. Assigned to 43rd Army, it remained in that Army until November 1944, and in that Front (renamed 1st Baltic Front) until March 1945. It ended the war in Leningrad Front, helping to contain the German forces trapped in the Courland Pocket. The division had compiled a solid record of service and won a unique battle honor by this time, and was disbanded shortly after hostilities ended.  1st Formation  The 306th Rifle Division began forming in September 1941 in the Moscow Military District. Very little is known about this formation:  2nd Formation  The second 306th Rifle Division began forming in April 1942 in the Moscow Military District,Dunn, Stalin's Keys to Victory, p. 111 and had its first commander, Lt. Col. Andrei Grigorevich Frolenkov, assigned on June 16.Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, 1996, p. 115. Sharp states that an unknown rifle brigade was used as a cadre, while Dunn states that no cadre was used. The division's order of battle was as follows: * 935th Rifle Regiment * 938th Rifle Regiment * 992nd Rifle Regiment * 1043rd Artillery RegimentSharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 115 * 429th Antitank Battalion * 342nd Sapper Battalion * 915th Signal Battalion * 210th Reconnaissance Company Postwar portrait of Kucheryavenko The division spent an unusually long time in the process of forming up. At the end of June it was assigned to 10th Reserve Army, and Col. Stepan Ivanovich Chernyak took command on July 8, a post he would hold until January 12, 1943. Instead of being shipped south along with the rest of what became the 5th Shock Army, it was moved in August to join 43rd Army, still in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. In September, that Army was assigned to Kalinin Front. The 306th remained in that Army and Front for an unusually long time. During October 1942 the division, along with several others of its Army, was on notice to prepare to join in the planned second stage of Operation Mars; in the event this did not take place because the first stage was unsuccessful.David M. Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, pp. 51, 53, 473n.18 Following two previous changes in command (including one brief stint by Col. Mikhail Ivanovich Kucheryavenko in March 1943) the divisional command passed to Col. Georgii Matveevich Kostik on March 27, 1943, and he would remain in this position until April 19, 1944. In September 1943, the 306th was assigned to the 91st Rifle Corps.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 115 =Smolensk and Vitebsk Offensives= In that same month the division was participating in the offensive to liberate Smolensk. On September 13 the 306th, and its corps-mate, the 179th Rifle Division, attacked the left flank of the German 256th Infantry Division and made a small breakthrough at Bedenki. This was countered by the few local reserves available. The next day the 306th liberated the fortified village of Ribshevo.Robert Forczyk, Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, UK, 2019, Kindle ed. In recognition of this success, on September 15 the division was uniquely granted that name as an honorific:In early November, 43rd and 39th Armies were ordered to concentrate north of the Smolensk ‚Äì Vitebsk railroad and highway in preparation for a new offensive against the latter city to begin on the 8th. 91st Corps was in first echelon on the right side of its Army's attack frontage. The two armies had about a five-fold superiority in infantry, in spite of their rifle divisions (including the 306th) being at about half their authorized strength. The assault made good initial progress; 43rd Army hit the junction of German 14th and 206th Infantry Divisions of VI Army Corps south of Ianovichi, about 24 km due east of Vitebsk, and tore a gaping hole through their defenses. On the following day the combined assault of both armies had produced a 10 km-wide breach, and by evening the lead elements of the attackers had reached Poddube, just 10 km from the inner defense lines of Vitebsk proper, and the defensive fronts of both German divisions were in shambles. However, enemy reserves managed to contain 43rd Army's advance at this point on November 11, and by the 17th the Soviet assault had expired in exhaustion.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 141‚Äì43 A further effort towards Vitebsk began on December 19. In this assault, the 306th was in second echelon of its Corps, behind 179th and 270th Rifle Divisions. By the end of the day the enemy had been driven back up to 3 km on an 8 km front, and the next day the division was committed into this breach, and made a further advance of up to 2 km in heavy fighting, but German reserves again intervened, and although the Soviet forces managed to reach the road between Vitebsk and Surazh on a 10 km sector before December 23, the offensive had to be once again shut down. Yet another assault began on that date. In this, 91st Corps acted in a supporting role to 39th and 33rd Armies by once again attacking the 14th Infantry's positions. The 306th was in the first echelon alongside the 270th in a sector between Kovalie and Piatiletna, backed by the 179th, the remaining vehicles of two tank brigades, and a motorized infantry brigade. The attack penetrated to within 2 km south of the Vitebsk-Surazh road, and along with advances on other sectors forced the German LIII Army Corps to withdraw to new defenses even closer to Vitebsk.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 234‚Äì35, 291‚Äì93, 296‚Äì97 =Operation Bagration= In February 1944, the division was reassigned to 1st Rifle Corps, and it was in this Corps at the start of Operation Bagration. Following a very heavy artillery barrage lasting 20 minutes at dawn on June 22, assault companies of the division, in concert with those of six other divisions, attacked the positions of the German 252nd Infantry Division and Corps Detachment D on a 20 km front, breaking through to the second defense line by noon. By evening an armored group supported by the 306th and two other rifle divisions had crossed the Obol River and were pushing southwest towards the Vitebsk ‚Äì Polotsk rail line, having advanced 7 km during the day. The following day the division assisted in the envelopment of Corps Detachment D's positions in Shumilino and forced a crossing of the Dvina River by evening. From here, 1st Rifle Corps was ordered westward, and reached Beshenkovichi by the end of June 25. By the 27th it had reached Lepel, against scattered German resistance.Dunn, Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp. 95, 100, 102, 104, 106, 109 Along with its Army, in the following months the 306th advanced into the \\"Baltic Gap\\" between Army Groups North and Center, driving towards Riga and the Baltic coast and trapping the remains of Army Group North in the Courland Pocket. In November it was moved, with its Corps, briefly into 2nd Guards Army, then to the 4th Shock Army,http://www.cgsc.edu/CARL/nafziger/944RLAA.pdf , p 18 then again to the 51st Army. 51st Army was reassigned to the 2nd Baltic Front in February 1945, but in March and for the duration the division was in the 1st Shock Army of the Courland Group.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 115 The men and women of the 306th Rifle Division ended the war with the official title of 306th Rifle, Ribshevo, Order of the Red Banner Division.

From its construction in 1888 through most of the 20th century the building housed municipal offices, the police and fire departments, and a public library, while the upper-floor meeting hall was a key venue for public and private events. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 for having local significance in the themes of architecture and politics/government. It was nominated for being a typical example of Minnesota's municipal buildings of the late 19th and early 20th century, and for its longstanding centrality to government and civic functions in Delano. Description Delano Village Hall is a two-story, brick rectangle with a corner tower‚Äîa slightly later addition‚Äîthat rises to a third story. Overall it has no distinct architectural style, but the arched windows and doorways, windows grouped within recessed arches, and finely decorated parapet are elements of Romanesque Revival design. The fire hall doors at the front of the building were filled in with brick in the 20th century, but the city received a grant in 2010 to restore them closer to their original appearance. History The village of Delano was incorporated in 1876 and, just over a decade later, community enthusiasm for the construction of a municipal hall culminated in a special election on September 12, 1887. Further action by the city council secured a prominent corner lot, bricks from a local brickmaker, and issued a construction contract to E.J. Swedebalk and Swan Erickson for $3,524 on March 13, 1888. That summer the unfinished building hosted a dance on Independence Day and was completed by August 24. The upstairs meeting hall was used heavily for public and private events, such as meetings, dances, church dinners, school graduations, wedding receptions, even basketball games and at least one funeral. In 1890 a stage for theatrical performances was added to the upstairs meeting hall, with dressing rooms following a year later. In 1896 the city government added a corner tower as a belfry for the fire department's alarm bell. Additional jail cells were installed in 1905. City services available in the building expanded in 1940 with the addition of a public library. The interior was modified over the years to suit changing needs; the stage and dressing rooms were ultimately removed to make space for a kitchen and indoor restrooms. In 1972 the fire department moved to its own newly built facility, and the library took over the vacated space. The building was still being used for most of the same original government and civic functions when it was nominated to the National Register in 1978. However, as new facilities were constructed elsewhere, use of the original village hall declined. Delano's government offices are now housed in a modern building across the street. The library moved to another building in 2004. The Delano Franklin Historical Society has been working to refurbish the building as a heritage center and event venue.

When held up to the light, their oil dots can be clearly seen in the leaf blade. The minuscule flowers appear over winter and spring (July to September). Distribution and habitat Micromyrtus grandis is found along one long ridge at an altitude of 600 to 750 m in the Severn River Nature Preserve and adjoining private farmland. It grows in exposed locations in heath and open woodland, associated with such species as narrow-leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra), stringybark she-oak (Allocasuarina inophloia), Acacia sp. aff. pubifolia, Johnson's grasstree (Xanthorrhoea johnsonii), and heath species Leptospermum novae- angliae, Micromyrtus sessilis and Leucopogon neo-anglicus. It is gazetted as endangered by both New South Wales and Federal governments. Cultivation Micromyrtus grandis has been cultivated at the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra since 1998, proving hardy and easy to grow, and can be propagated by seed or cutting.

The division was first formed in the summer of 1941 and was in the Bryansk pocket. The division was reformed in June 1942 and served until the end of the war. Postwar, it was converted into a rifle brigade, which became the 473rd District Training Center after several redesignations.  History  = First Formation = The 279th was formed from the 6th Reserve Rifle Brigade in the cities of Vladimir and Gorky beginning on 2 July 1941, part of the Moscow Military District. The division's basic order of battle included the 1001st, 1003rd, and the 1005th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 831st Artillery Regiment and the 378th Separate Reconnaissance Battalion. On 5 August, the 279th became part of the Reserve Front's 24th Army, with headquarters at Putykova. On 10 August the division transferred to the 43rd Army, but five days later became part of the 50th Army. At the end of September, just before the start of Operation Typhoon, the German attack on Moscow, the 279th had a strength of 7,964 men, 317 machine guns, 89 artillery pieces, 6 anti-aircraft guns, and 15 anti-tank guns. The division was surrounded and destroyed in the Bryansk pocket, created by the German breakthrough. By 1 November the only remaining unit of the division was the 1005th Rifle Regiment, which became a separate unit directly under the Bryansk Front. On 15 November the division was officially disbanded, and its remnants used to reinforce the 154th Rifle Division. = Second Formation = The division began its second formation on 2 June 1942 at Balakhna, formed from troops called up from the Urals and Central Asia and a rifle brigade, and commanded by Colonel Gerasim Mukhin. The 279th was immediately assigned to the 9th Reserve Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. In August it became part of the 43rd Army, which in September became part of the Kalinin Front. At the end of the year, the division transferred to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and moved south, becoming part of the Southwestern Front's 3rd Guards Army by the end of January 1943. In April the 279th became part of the 32nd Rifle Corps. The division transferred back to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command in January 1944 and became part of the 51st Army of the 4th Ukrainian Front. The division fought in the Crimean Offensive during April and May as part of the 10th and the 1st Guards Rifle Corps, during which it helped recapture Simferopol and on 24 April received the Order of the Red Banner. On 7 May the division and the rest of the army participated in the assault on Sevastopol, which was captured two days later. The remaining Axis troops soon evacuated from Crimea, enabling the 51st Army's transfer to the Baltic states in May after briefly moving into the RVGK. By 1 July 1944, the army was part of the 1st Baltic Front, and in August the division transferred to the 10th Rifle Corps. From late 1944, the 51st Army blockaded German troops trapped in the Courland Pocket, where the 279th ended the war in May 1945. On 17 August 1945, the 279th was transferred to the Elansky military camp in Kamyshlov in the Ural Military District, where it became the 23rd Separate Rifle Brigade in May 1946. On 12 September 1953, the brigade was converted into the 61st Mechanized Division. On 25 April 1957, the 61st became the 44th Tank Division, which became a training unit, the 44th Tank Training Division, in 1960. The division later became the 473rd District Training Center.

Kwan stated that his intention in writing the novel was to \\"introduce a contemporary Asia to a North American audience\\". He claimed the novel was loosely based on his own childhood in Singapore. The novel became a bestseller and was followed by two sequels, China Rich Girlfriend in 2015 and Rich People Problems in 2017. A film adaptation of the novel was released on August 15, 2018. Plot The novel begins with a quote from the 14th-century Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta: The book is told from the perspective of five main characters: Rachel Chu, Nicholas (Nick) Young, Eleanor Young, Astrid Leong, and Edison Cheng. The story revolves around the grand wedding of Singapore's most eligible bachelor, Colin Khoo, and a fashion icon, Araminta Lee, which everyone calls the wedding of the year. Rachel is a New York University (NYU) professor of economics, who is originally from Cupertino, California. She was raised by her single mother and leads a typical middle-class life. When her boyfriend Nick, also an NYU professor, takes her to meet his family in Singapore, she is completely unaware of what is in store for her. Although he grew up in London, Nick is a Singapore native. Unknown to anyone in New York, he not only belongs to one of the top ten wealthiest families in Asia but is possibly sole heir to his family's great fortune. Despite this wealth, he was raised to be humble and to keep a low profile. Because of his upbringing, he is confident his family will approve of his simple girlfriend, but things turn out very differently than he expects. Eleanor Young is Nick's controlling mother who is obsessed with prestige and pride. Since Nick was born, she has allowed her mother-in-law, the Young family matriarch, to practically raise her only child, so that, when the time comes, she will leave the family fortune to him. As a result, Eleanor is not very involved in Nick's upbringing and is even separated from his father, who chooses to live and work in Australia to manage their family's businesses there. She is also very adamant that Nick marry someone from the close-knit, rich circle of her friends and plans to sabotage Nick and Rachel's relationship. She hires a private detective to gather information on Rachel's family, which she later attempts to use to drive Rachel out of Nick's life, but ultimately results in her son freezing her out of his life. Rachel is shocked when she learns who her father, Zhou Fang Min, is and leaves to stay with her friend Goh Peik Lin and her family. Astrid Teo is Nick's famous cousin whose beauty is well known all across Asia. Although she maintains a positive image to her family and society, her marriage is suffering. Michael, her long-suffering husband, is a self-made young man who is looked down on because he does not come from money. Astrid discovers that he might be having an affair with someone in Hong Kong. When she confronts him, Michael admits to having an affair and leaves. With the help of her ex-fianc√© Charlie Wu, Astrid confronts him again in Hong Kong where he reveals that he has, in fact, not been having an affair and has only made it seem like he had so that she would want to divorce him, being no longer able to deal with the outsider status since he married into Astrid's family. In a last-ditch effort to help save their marriage and make Astrid happy, Charlie secretly buys shares in Michael's startup company at a highly inflated price. Edison Cheng is Nick's spoiled Hong Kong cousin who works as a banker. He is one of the few members of his clan who lives up to his birthright as a member of one of the wealthiest families in the world. He wants to impress all his friends and relatives at the wedding, but his plans fall short because of his family, particularly his younger brother Alistair who is dating Kitty Pong, a starlet of questionable background and intentions. Alistair and Kitty are briefly engaged but she leaves him for Bernard Tai, a billionaire's son, after Oliver T'Sien misleads her to believe that the Chengs are not as rich as she thought. Rachel and Nick suffer a falling out. Nick tries to convince her to stay in the relationship with him, professing that he no longer cares about what society and his family expect from him. Rachel doesn't believe him, claiming that no matter how much they try to ignore his family's legacy, they know they may not be able to. She tells Nick that she wants her children to grow up treasured and loved by their relatives like her own family has done, not raised with a family whose primary concern is their own wealth, family legacy, and the kinds of rich people they know. Rachel breaks up with him as a result and Nick realizes she's lost to him. Depressed, he stays at Colin's house for a while. At the Goh house, Rachel calls her mother, Kerry, and they have a falling out. She demands to know why Kerry didn't tell her about Fang Min being her father. When Kerry tries to explain that he was abusive and she had to save her life, Rachel blames her for her actions and hangs up the phone. While staying at Colin's house, Nick regrets bringing Rachel to Singapore without giving her an insight into how to deal with his wealthy family. Instead of his family liking Rachel, they successfully turn her against Nick, which leads to their eventual break up. He mentions this to Colin, along with his thoughts of letting Rachel go. However, Colin suggests that Nick fight for Rachel and do one thing to win her back. As Rachel and Peik Lin are preparing to leave to meet Fang Min, Rachel's father who is in jail, Nick stops them from leaving, revealing that he's brought something from China to her. To Rachel's anger, it's her own mother that he brought to Singapore. Annoyed with Nick for preventing her one chance of meeting her father, Rachel tells Kerry off: she doesn't want to see her again and wants her to just let her meet her father. In desperation, Kerry finally reveals the truth about her real father: it isn't Fang Min but a man nicknamed Kao Wei. Rachel decides to listen to her mother and learn about the abuse she went through with Fang Min, including how Kao Wei saved her life by helping her escape to America, where she stayed with her relatives. Upon realizing how abusive Fang Min was to Kerry, Rachel is remorseful for her earlier behavior and reconciles with her mother. Nick takes the ladies to Marina Bay Sands for Singapore Slings.

Development Before his father died of cancer in 2010, Kwan suspended his work for eighteen months to care for him, during which they would reminisce about life in Singapore. He began writing stories as a way to preserve those memories while grieving his father's death. The novel was inspired by his childhood in Singapore. Kwan first developed what became the second chapter of the book from a poem entitled \\"Singapore Bible Study,\\" which he had written for a creative writing course in college. That poem describes the study group as \\"an excuse to gossip and show off new jewelry\\". After adapting that poem into a chapter of a novel, he was inspired to complete the entire story. Kwan shared an incomplete draft of the novel with an editor friend, who later complained he had ruined her Thanksgiving dinner, as she could not put the book down, delaying meal preparations. She encouraged him to engage an agent for the manuscript. He also recognized there was a gap in the coverage of contemporary Asia in the western book market, which was publishing either historical fiction or Asian-American identity works. Kwan stated some characters \\"are loosely inspired by people I know\\" while others are completely fictional. Tyersall Park was inspired by Kwan's paternal grandparents, with whom he lived while growing up in Singapore. He stated they had \\"a quiet elegance in the way they carried on with their lives, as well as a beauty to the customs and rituals we practised\\". The lavish decorations and clothing described in the novel were also inspired by true stories, but Kwan's editor asked him to cut some of those details, as they were hardly believable. Kwan sent the editor links to news articles to prove that \\"truth is stranger than fiction when it comes to details\\". Reception The novel received positive reviews internationally from sources including The New York Times, The Boston Globe and The Independent. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote of the novel, \\"Mr. Kwan knows how to deliver guilty pleasures. He keeps the repartee nicely outrageous, the excess wretched and the details wickedly delectable.\\" Film adaptation A film adaptation of the 2013 novel was directed by Jon M. Chu under Warner Bros. Pictures. Filming began in April 2017. It was distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures after being released on August 15, 2018. The director of the film appears in the book as a distant cousin of Rachel Chu's.

He recorded a substantial number of jazz pieces with orchestra between 1919 and 1922, in addition to ragtime music such as his popular Hungarian Rag of 1913. Early life in Baltimore Lenzberg was the youngest child of German (Prussian) immigrants Henry and Julia Lenzberg, and he had many brothers and sisters. His father worked as a cigar packer in Baltimore. Jules, as he often called himself, worked at the Weber and Fields Vaudeville Club in Baltimore until it closed in November 1897, so the young Lenzberg then played violin and piano elsewhere. By 1900, he had published two marches, and was living with his parents and several siblings. His newly formed \\"orchestra of soloists\\" performed in October, 1900 at the Al Reeve's Music Hall in New York. In 1903, Jules married German-born Ella Lenzberg, and they moved permanently to New York City so he could pursue his music career.Edwards, Bill. Julius Lenzberg\\", ragpiano.com, accessed November 1, 2015. Music career in New York Lenzberg first led an ensemble at New York's Circle Theatre on Broadway near Columbus Circle. The Circle had a troubled existence in its early years, however, switching from legitimate theatre to vaudeville and then to burlesque,\\"Circle Theatre\\" http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/2935/map and Lenzberg soon was appointed musical director of the nearby Colonial Theatre (New York City) when it became a vaudeville house in May 1905. \\"Colonial Theatre\\" http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/2943 \\"Harkness Theatre\\" https://www.ibdb.com/theatre/harkness-theatre-1412 In the summers, when the Colonial and most New York theatres went dark because of the heat, Lenzberg played in ensembles on Long Island and Long Branch, New Jersey. By 1910 the Lenzbergs had moved to Queens, New York where they remained for the rest of their lives, and the move to Queens marked the beginning of his greatest period of productivity as a composer. The Hungarian Rag was his only huge seller, but his other compositions, though not as successful, still made him a comfortable income. Meanwhile, he continued to be a successful leader of his orchestra at the Colonial Theatre. Bill Edwards, \\"Julius Lenzberg\\", extensive biography at www.perfessorbill.com He often adapted familiar classical tunes to ragtime, as he did with his Hungarian Rag and Operatic Rag, inspiring others to \\"rag\\" famous tunes, though not always as successfully as Lenzberg. His Hungarian Rag was based upon the Hungarian Rhapsodies by Liszt. Lenzberg's Haunting Rag may be his most original work. Among Lenzberg's collaborators was the singer and songwriter Ernest Ball.Edwards, op. cit. Lenzberg was in a group called the \\"Harmonists\\" who performed in vaudeville, and he was also musical director for the first \\"George White's Scandals\\" revue in 1919 on Broadway. During that period, he was also conductor at B. F. Keith's Riverside Theatre at Broadway and 96th Street (the Keith chain was managed by E. F. Albee at that time, as Keith had died in 1914), where he often led the orchestra with his violin; the Riverside alternated vaudeville programs with film screenings, and the music was always of a popular nature. He and the Riverside Orchestra recorded dance tunes, mostly for Edison Records and for the Path√© label. A news report from 1920 describes an interesting incident there: > Julius Lenzberg, leader of the orchestra at the Riverside Theatre, New York, > recently featured during the intermission 'Tired of Me,' the new Irving > Berlin, Inc., number. Mr. Lenzberg is something of a violin soloist himself, > and put over the number so well that he was compelled to play the chorus > twice. 'It is the first time I ever heard an audience demand an encore > during intermission,' declared Mr. Lenzberg.Music Trade News (December 25, > 1920). His work at the Riverside Theatre remained popular for years,New York Evening Telegram (October 16, 1922) and some important musicians worked with him.

Kwon is the first woman to bring charges of sexual assault against the South Korean government. She was also considered by historian Namhee Lee to be \\"an emblematic figure of South Korea in the 1980s; she embodied the passion, the ideals, and the conflicting aspirations of the 1980s democratization movement.\\" Kwon later became a feminist scholar in South Korea.  Biography  As a middle school student, Kwon recalls feeling \\"duped\\" by the Korean government in power. She had been involved with student movements at the time, and said that \\"It was hard to swallow the betrayal and anger against adults to had fed lies to the young.\\" Kwon went on to become a student activist in the democratic movement while in college. Later, as a Seoul National University student, she obtained a blue-collar job by not reporting her university credentials. She lied about her education in order to \\"organize factory workers into a trade union.\\" In June 1986, she went to the police station in Puch'≈èn in order to address charges that she had falsified documents. She had also been charged for taking part in a \\"violent demonstration.\\" Kwon was sexually abused at the police station by an officer, Mun Kwi-dong. Kwon went on to file sexual abuse charges against the government, which were initially considered \\"exaggerated\\" by authorities, even though the government had already admitted that she was \\"forced to remove her jacket and T-shirt and was beaten 'in the breasts three or four times' on two occasions during the questioning.\\" In July 1986, a rally in protest of her treatment was sponsored by Kim Yong-sam and the New Korea and Democratic Party (NKDP), but was stopped by police with tear gas. During press coverage of the case, the South Korean government micromanaged how the press would report what happened to Kwon, including guidelines that changed the tone of the case and which also cast Kwon as a liar and possibly a communist. The initial reporting of the story was a single line at the bottom of the social page in Korea Daily. A spokesman for the government called her allegations of sexual assault a \\"routine tactic used by student radicals.\\" Eventually the police did admit that \\"she had been sexually molested during interrogation.\\" Kwon was eventually imprisoned for eighteen months for falsifying identification documents. Criminal charges against Mun were dropped because while \\"the prosecution office said its investigation into Kwon's complaint found some truth\\" there was still not enough evidence for them to proceed with the trial. In addition, the prosecution claimed that while she had been beaten on the breasts while nude, the government did not \\"consider these acts sexual abuse.\\" Kwon was released from prison in 1987, along with hundreds of other political prisoners in Korea. Mun was eventually assessed $45,000 in civil penalties after \\"extensive legal maneuvering.\\" Kwon's case is considered an illustration of cover-ups regarding political neutrality of the South Korean judicial system in the mid-1980s. Kwon has gone on to become a feminist scholar whose work analyzes patriarchal constructs of masculinity in militarized areas and how these concepts affect women, children and civilians.  Legacy  The news that Kwon had sued regarding her sexual abuse would \\"rock Korean society for months. It was shocking that a young woman would go public with an accusation that was more likely to damage her own reputation than that of the accused.\\" Traditionally, sexual and physical abuse was considered an \\"unspeakable experience,\\" but Kwon's public testimony helped reframe the issue of sexual abuse in South Korea by \\"recasting her experience from the 'shame of the victim' to the 'crime of the perpetrator.\\" The acts of sexual abuse as described by Kwon led to the creation of the KWAU which would influence Korean politics in the 1990s.
