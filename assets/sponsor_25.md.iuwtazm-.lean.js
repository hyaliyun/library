As harassment of Jews in the Pontifical States worsened under Paul IV from 1555, Judah went to the home of his kinsman Minzi Beretaro at Mantua, where he enjoyed the society and instruction of the foremost Jews of his time, the brothers Moses, David, and Judah Proven√ßal and Azariah dei Rossi. In 1587 he became chief rabbi of Mantua. Moscato was a true child of the Renaissance, well versed in the classical languages and literatures and in sympathy with their spirit. Like many of his contemporaries, he believed that the ancient civilization and all the languages of culture were derived from Judaism and that it was the duty of the Jews to acquire these branches of knowledge, of which they had once been masters. He was widely read, especially in philosophy; and again like his contemporaries, although an admirer of Judah ha-Levi and Maimonides, he was an enthusiastic student of the Cabala. Moscato published, under the title Nefu·∫ìot Yehudah (Venice, 1588; Lemberg, 1859), fifty-two sermons,which inaugurated a new epoch in homiletic literature. Most of these were delivered in Hebrew or in Italian; and while they observe the rules of rhetoric they deal with their subjects naturally and without forced exegesis. His other printed work, ·∏≤ol Yehuda (Venice, 1594), was the first commentary on the \\"Cuzari\\" of Judah ha-Levi. Since this fact would at once secure for it a wide circulation, the rabbis Cividali and Saraval of Mantua urged him to publish it. It appeared posthumously, and since then has always been printed together with the \\"Cuzari.\\" Moscato wrote poetry also, especially elegies on the deaths of friends and scholars, including one on the death of Joseph Caro. Three of his elegies, on the death of Duchess Margherita of Savoy (d. 1574), have recently become known. Here is an excerpt from Rabbi Moscato's book Kol Yehuda: References * *Zunz, G.

The school is located in Addis Ababa. The school has an enrollment of nearly 1,000 students from over 67 nations. ICS Addis has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools since 1992. The school was accredited again in December 2014. ICS Addis has been authorized to offer the International Baccalaureate Program (IBDP) since March 1982. ICS Addis is located on a 15-acre (61,000m2) tract. The sports facility of the school includes among others a 300-meter track dedicated to Haile Gebreselassie and a newly launched multipurpose sports pavilion luxuriously sitting on an area of 2,700 square meters. The Early Childhood area, also called Little Eagles‚Äô Nest is on a separate campus right next to the main campus. The New Classroom Building (NCB), entirely dedicated for the middle school, equipped with classrooms and laboratories themed with the 21st century personalized, hub model of learning was also launched in June 2017.

The school offers an American high school diploma to all graduates who meet graduation requirements. Almost 100% of the graduates enter higher education immediately after graduation, and 85% of the graduates attend colleges and universities in the US and Canada. Many students also pursue the IB Diploma (International Baccalaureate). The school is the only testing center for the SAT in the city, but does not offer the TOEFL. The after-school program includes sports at all age levels, drama, clubs, activities and community service opportunities. Sports teams at several age levels participate in a local league with other international and national schools. Boys and girls varsity soccer, volleyball and basketball teams also participate in the International Schools of Southern and Eastern Africa(ISSEA) league, with seven other international schools from Mozambique, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Zambia and South Africa. Students of the middle and high school go on four- or five-night grade level field trips to areas of Ethiopia/ overseas, in support of the science or history curricula. However, domestic trips have been cancelled for 3 years, as of 2017, with the school administration citing safety concerns.  Philosophy  The school is in a PLC (Professional Learning Community) journey towards becoming certified as a PLC Exemplar School. The collaborative planning in all areas of the education is guided by the four essential PLC questions: Q1: What is it that we want our kids to know and be able to do? Q2: How will we know they know it? Q3: What will we do if they don't know it? Q4 What will we do if they already know it? With this, the school is aiming to become a highly effective, learning progressive school in which students gain solid, conceptual understanding of subject areas while maintaining the high achievement in local and international standards. ICS is led by global thought leaders in education. The head of school, Dr. Timothy Stuart, is one of the most prominent leaders in Professional Learning Communities (PLC) and personalized learning. ICS Addis has started a PLC journey of personalizing learning in which all students learn at high levels while their individual needs are met professionally. With this, the school hosted the first ever PLC at Work¬Æ institute in Africa organized by Solution Tree in October 2018. The event was held for three days (11-13 October 2018) and brought educators and global leaders in education like Dr. Anthony Muhammad and Tom Schimmer. Admissions Admission is based upon completed application forms, previous school records and results from previous or current academic testing as required by the professional staff. Placement tests at the time of application assist admissions and placement decisions. ICS does not offer part-time, partial or correspondence programs. Events Scholarship program Since the early 1990s, ICS Addis has offered four 4-year scholarships every year to rising ninth graders from schools throughout Addis Ababa. The scholarships are need-blind and are based on merit. The selection process begins in March/April with applications from the top students from public and private middle schools around the city. Applicants are taken through a rigorous process that includes a 3-hour written test, student and parent interviews. The Scholarship Club hosts an Ethiopian Food Sale once or twice every year. The sale includes the traditional foods of Ethiopia; both fasting and non-fasting. Besides the food sale, the Scholarship Club also hosts a garage sale every year. These are funding programs, created to help the Scholarship Club financially. Many of the ICS scholarship students go on to win full scholarships at universities in the USA. In the past, ICS Scholarship Students have been awarded four-year scholarships to Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Vassar, Davidson, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Duke and Amherst to name a few. Governance The school is governed by a nine-member hybrid Board of Governors. Two members are elected for two-year terms by the ICS Addis Parent Association, six members are appointed by the Board for four-year terms and one member is appointed by the US Ambassador.

It is located on a peninsula that juts southwesterly into Hudson Bay across from Smith Island (Qikirtajuaq). Akulivik lies 1,850 km north of Montreal. Akulivik, meaning \\"central prong of a kakivak\\" in the Nunavik dialect of Inuktitut, takes its name from the surrounding geography. Located on a peninsula between two bays, the area evokes the shape of a kakivak, a traditional, trident-shaped spear used for fishing. Telephone and internet are furnished by satellite. There is no hospital, but a clinic staffed by nurses provides non-critical care; otherwise air ambulances are available. Policing is done by the Kativik Regional Police Force. History Akulivik was incorporated as a community in 1976. The Inuit have lived in the area for thousands of years. In 1610, the explorer Henry Hudson passed by the island of Qikirtajuaq near present-day Akulivik. In 1922, the Hudson's Bay Company established a trading post on the site of today's settlement. The outpost was moved to the island of Qikirtajuaq in 1926. Between 1922 and 1955, the area where Akulivik is located today was the summer camp of Inuit who congregated around the trading post. In 1952, the post was closed, forcing the families to move to Puvirnituq, 100 km to the south. In 1973, one family moved back to the area. The following year, many others followed and, together, they built the village of Akulivik. On June 11, 2017, a resident named Illutak Anautak broke into three homes and stabbed five people, killing three and critically injuring two, among them a 10-year-old child. Anautak was shot and killed by police when attempting to break into a fourth home. His motives were unclear. Education The Kativik School Board operates the Tukisiniarvik School.\\"Our Schools.\\" Kativik School Board. Retrieved on September 23, 2017. The Tukisiniarvik School has 167 students in classes from Kindergarten to Secondary V (Grade 11). Inuktitut remains the dominant language of the community. As in all the communities of Nunavik, Inuktitut is also the language of instruction at school until grade 3, at which point students choose between English or French as the language of instruction, and continue to study Inuktitut language and Inuit culture as separate subjects. Transportation Inaccessible by road, Akulivik is served by the small Akulivik Airport - AKV. Ice starts to form in late September and stays until late July, when the Bay becomes navigable. Large items are delivered by ship, including in building supplies, snowmobiles and gasoline, as well as a year's supply of diesel fuel for the town generator. Thrice-weekly air service brings cargo including food and services to Akulivik. References Further reading * Kaminski, Gregory.

It runs as follows: The interpretation of the second paragraph was debated when it first appeared and became a major issue towards the end of the 19th century during the conflicts over what vestments and ceremonies were legal in the Church of England. History and interpretation The rubric first appears in the Elizabethan revision of the Book of Common Prayer in 1559 and was retained in the later 1604 revision under James I. The second paragraph is essentially an extract from the penultimate section of the Elizabethan Act of Uniformity (1559 ‚Äì 1 Elizabeth I,c.2) and breaks off in the middle of a sentence. The act itself provided that: Until June 1549 the Sarum Rite Mass (a version of the Roman Rite) was celebrated in Latin, with certain insertions in English.From 1547, the Epistle and Gospel on Sundays and Holy Days; and from March 1548 the inclusion of devotions between the consecration and the reception of communion very similar to those used in the 1549 book.(Procter and Frere, pp.35ff) The ornaments of the ministers would have been the traditional Eucharistic vestments used in that Rite: albs, tunicles, dalmatics, copes, chasubles, maniples, mitres et cetera. The text of the 1549 Rite is quite explicit and reads for the ministration of the Holy Communion \\"the Priest shall put upon him...a white Albe plain, with a vestment or Cope. And where there be many Priests or Decons\\"...\\"shall have upon theim likewise\\"...\\"Albes, with tunicles.\\"Brad Thompson, Liturgies of the Western Church, 1962. p. 246 The wording in the 1559 Prayer Book Preface to Morning Prayer, reads\\"...the minister at the time of the Communion, and at all other times in his ministration shall use such ornaments as were in use by authority of Parliament in the second year of the Reign if Edward the Sixth according to the Act of Parliament set forth in the beginning of thys book.\\" The wording of the Rubric is an order, not an option. The \\"second year\\" referred to in the Act of 1559 began on 28 January 1548, and the Act approving the introduction of the first Book of Common Prayer was approved by Parliament on 21 January 1549. While it has been argued that the Act legalises the Roman Catholic vestments which were actually in use in the second year, most authorities accept that the Act refers to the vestments ordered in the first Edwardine Prayer Book of 1549In summary: plain white alb, with a vestment (meaning chasuble) or cope and in the case of a bishop, the rochet. even though they were only required as from June 1549.Blunt & Phillimore p.116 However, such an argument ignores the fact that the Ornaments Rubric was inserted in the Prayer Book of 1559 (as once of the concessions to Catholic feelings in order to get the Act of Uniformity passed by the Lords) and refers to the ornaments of the churches and ministers as in use in 1548 or more specifically and restrictively ordered in 1549 (as some have argued)!Christopher Haigh, English Reformations, 1993, pp. 240-241 ; Diarmid MacCullough, The Later Reformation in England, 1547-1603, 1990 p. 26 If this was not the intent in 1559 the language should have been changed to explicate what vestments and ornaments were permissible, if not albs, tunicles, dalmatics, copes, chasubles, maniples, miters, et cetera which ones - gown and surplice only? The insertion of the Ornament Rubric, the addition of the Words of Administration at time of Communion (stating a belief in the Real Presence with a particular definition) from the First to the Second Prayer and the Adoption of the Prayer Book of 1552 suggests that Queen, a moderate non-ideological Protestant, wanted the celebration of the Holy Communion to look like a MassHaigh, p. 241 Also, if she had had her way the clergy would have been celibate since she detested married clergy. On 30 April 1559, it was \\"glossed\\" (interpreted) by Dr Sandys, successively bishop of Worcester (1559), London (1570) and York (1575),ODCC \\"Sandys\\" to mean that \\"we shall not be forced to use them, but that others in the mean time shall not convey them away, but that they may remain for the Queen.\\"Procter and Frere, p.105 note 2 Later in 1559, the Queen issued her Injunctions, one of which required the churchwardens to deliver to \\"our visitors\\" an inventory of \\"vestments, copes or other ornaments, plate, books and especially of grails, couchers, legends, processions, hymnals, manuals, portuals and such like, appertaining to their church.\\"Bray p.344 The policy was to wean the Church from the outward trappings of the Catholic past by permission to use them until such time that the clergy, almost 100% Catholic, could be replaced by new men over time. Some parishes complied, others did not. Next year after learning many of the parishes were vandalizing their ornaments, she tried to reverse her policy somewhat. In 1566, the metropolitan (Archbishop Parker) issued his \\"advertisements\\" ordering the use of the surplice and in cathedrals and collegiate churches the cope.ODCC \\"Advertisements, Book of\\" The Canons of 1604, passed with strict conformity to legal procedures and legally binding with minor modifications till well into the 20th century, enforced this same line.Neill, p.84 It wasn't until the end of the century that the last of the ornaments of old were finally done away with everywhere (though some survived hidden away as in St. John's College, Oxford). However, by this time a large section of the 'new' clergy had re- discover the Catholic heritage, the cuckoo in the nest (A Protestant theology, programme within Catholic structure that rejected Calvinist predestinarian theology, emphasized the role of the sacraments esp. the Eucharist and a reexamination the early Church writers instead of ReformersMcDiarmid MacCullough, The Later Reformation in England, 1547-1603, pp. 78-79 The result of which was to strengthen their resolve not to give into Puritan demands. The strong Catholic substrate in the Prayer Book was intact, but not the ornaments associated with it. The issue about these would re-surface in the mid-19th century in the Ritualist Movement. For about one hundred years, starting in the middle of the 19th century, the legal interpretation of the rubric was disputed.Neill p.268 Anglo-Catholics pointed to it to justify their restoration of the traditional Eucharistic vestments of western Christianity in the Anglican Communion, whereas Evangelicals insisted that further order was taken in the Injunctions of 1559, the \\"Advertisements\\" of 1566 and the Canons of 1604 and therefore the only legal vestments were choir habit together with the cope in Cathedrals and collegiate churches.Dyson Hague pp.36,37 The use of the disputed vestments became undoubtedly legal in the Church of England with the passing of the 1969 Canons, but these stated that no particular doctrinal significance was attached to them.

The rebellions, while at first thought to be an attempt at a military coup, were staged primarily to assert displeasure against the civilian government and make certain military demands known.  Background  Following Argentina‚Äôs return to democracy in 1983 with the election of Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n, the new democratic government sought justice for the human rights violations perpetuated by the military government. The creation of CONADEP, the publication of Nunca M√°s, the reform to the Military Justice Code, and the Juicio de las Juntas were some of the measures taken to shed light on what had happened during the Proceso de Reorganizaci√≥n Nacional and bring the perpetrators to justice.  The Uprisings  On April 15, 1987, Lieutenant Colonel Aldo Rico led the first uprising of the Carapintadas at the Campo de Mayo Infantry School in Buenos Aires. The Carapintadas referred to this uprising as Operaci√≥n Dignidad, a reflection of their demands for honor and respect to be shown to the Armed Forces, something that the Carapintadas felt had been lost under the new democratic regime. Among this general sentiment, there was also a call for the end to the trials for human rights violations and removal of the army chief of staff. In future uprisings, the Carapintadas would include expansion of the military budget among their demands. President Alfons√≠n addressed an estimated 200,000 protestors who had gathered in front of the Presidential Palace, promising to end the conflict, before traveling to Campo de Mayo to negotiate with Rico. On April 19, 1987, the Carapintadas surrendered. The Carapintadas revolted again under Rico's command in January 1988 in Monte Caseros. Six other regiments joined Rico in solidarity, adding up to a total of 350 soldiers. An unconditional surrender followed 5 days later, whereupon Rico was expelled from the army and imprisoned, while other Carapintada members were forced to retire, expelled from the army, or exiled. The third uprising took place in on December of that year, when members of the Albatros special unit, led by Mohamed Al√≠ Seineld√≠n, took control of the military barracks in Villa Martelli. The demands of this rebellion were similar to the previous two: they requested the resignation of General Caridi and that his replacement be pro-Carapintada; full amnesty beyond the Due Obedience law; and an increase in military salaries. (Payne 55). However, by this rebellion, the demands of the Carapintada were beginning to become much more vague than the previous uprisings under Rico. They were later followed by around 1,000 troops of the three armed forces. The mutineers surrendered days later, but only Seineld√≠n and Major Hugo Abete were arrested. Several of the mutineers' demands were conceded by the government, such as the replacement of General Caridi with General Gassino and a military pay increase. As was reported in the Buenos Aires Herald at the time, and in The Journal of Commerce and other US publications, both Rico and Seineld√≠n spent time in Central America, where they trained Argentine cadres and other troops involved in supporting the US anti-leftist mission in the region. Both men have more than tangential connection to the organized torture and human rights violations that were carried out by the Argentine military during the nation's Dirty War. In October 1989, president elect Carlos Menem signed a pardon for a number of detained military men; including 39 held by events during the military dictatorship, and 164 Carapintadas. In spite of this, on December 3, 1990 Seineld√≠n again staged what would become known as the most violent Carapintada uprising. After the takeover of eight regiments, the rebellion ended with several deaths and 300 arrested. Because of President Menem‚Äôs positive relations with the military, the uprising did not gain much military support and was shut down by the loyalist military within 36 hours. A few days later, Menem signed the pardon for all the most important people convicted for misdeeds during the Dirty War.  Significance  The uprisings of the Carapintadas had significant effects on the trajectory of Argentine civil- military relations and transitional justice processes. President Alfons√≠n‚Äôs government inherited a substantial amount of debt from its military predecessor, which led to intense slashing of the military budget. This was interpreted as an attempt to undercut and weaken the military in addition to the humiliation of the human rights trials and denunciation of the National Reorganization Process. The first rebellion was also the first outright expression of the Argentine Armed Forces regarding the memory of the Dirty War. In the eyes of the Carapintadas, the National Reorganization Process had been a necessary war against Communist subversion and the military had saved the Argentine way of life. The rebellions as a whole created rifts within the military itself: while the non-Carapintada military did not fully support the rebellion, they were unwilling to repress the Carapintadas until the final uprising under Menem. The rebellions also created tensions and power struggles between the government and military for several years afterward. Rather than attempting to organically cultivate military support for the democratic civilian government, Alfons√≠n‚Äôs administration had instead attempted to force the Armed Forces to respect civilian control. Additionally, the government‚Äôs response to the uprisings weakened civilian faith in the new democracy‚Äôs ability to manage the military and proceed with human rights rectification. The passing of the Due Obedience Law shortly after the first Carapintada uprising in 1987 was seen by many human rights groups and activists as Alfons√≠n making concessions with what remained of authoritarian rule. Leaders of the Carapintadas later entered politics. Aldo Rico formed MODIN and ran for president in 1995, while Gustavo Obeid formed the Peoples Reconstruction Party. Both parties have a right-wing nationalist orientation.

The neighborhood is adjacent to Wilshire Park, a neighborhood park. The community's side streets wind around the hill, past cottages and expansive Craftsman homes. Alameda is located between the business districts of Beaumont Village and the Hollywood District. Locals informally refer to the neighborhood as the Yarn District for its abundance of yarn-based hobbyists. The Alameda neighborhood was established on the 1859 land claim of William C. Bowering and his wife, Isabelle. The area became known as Gravelly Hill Road for a gravel pit at NE 33rd and Fremont. In 1909, the Alameda Land Company laid out the Alameda Park subdivision that was then annexed to the city of Portland. The development advertised an extremely broad exclusion in its printed brochure, declaring \\"no people of undesirable colors and kinds.\\" The name comes from the Spanish word \\"alamo,\\" meaning a poplar or cottonwood tree. \\"Alameda\\" means, precisely, a public walk or promenade lined with poplar trees, and, by extension, a street lined with trees, like the English word \\"parkway.\\" Alameda Elementary School of the Portland Public Schools district is located in the neighborhood, as is The Madeleine School, a Catholic K-8 school.

Guglielmo Oberdan, (born Wilhelm Oberdank) (February 1, 1858 - December 20, 1882) was an Italian irredentist. He was executed after a failed attempt to assassinate Austrian Emperor Francis Joseph, becoming a martyr of the Italian unification movement. Biography Guglielmo Oberdan He was born in the city of Trieste, which was Austrian at the time. His mother was a Slovene woman from ≈†empas in the County of Gorizia and Gradisca, while his father, Valentino Falcier, was a Venetian soldier in the Austrian army. He did not recognize his son, so Wilhelm took his mother's surname. He was educated in an Italian cultural milieu, embraced irredentist ideas and Italianized his name to \\"Guglielmo Oberdan\\". In 1877 he enrolled at the Vienna's College of Technology (now Vienna University of Technology) where he studied engineering. As he supported the idea of independence for all of the empire's national groups he resented the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary and therefore deserted from the Austro-Hungarian Army because he did not want to take part in military activities there. Instead, he fled to Rome to continue his studies. In the Italian capital he adopted irredentist ideas, aiming at the annexation to Italy of the Italian-speaking lands still under Austro-Hungarian rule. In 1882 he met with irredentist leader and co-founder Matteo Renato Imbriani. It was then that he came to the conviction that only radical acts of martyrdom could bring the liberation of Trieste from Austrian rule. The assassination attempt In the same year, Emperor Franz Joseph was planning a visit to Trieste as part of the celebration of the 500th anniversary of Habsburg rule. Although the city had earned itself the honorific title of urbs fidelissima (\\"most faithful city\\") for its non-participation in the revolutions of the 1840s, the city was nonetheless a hotbed for Italian irredentists. The ceremonies were accompanied by anti-Austrian demonstrations. At this opportunity, Oberdan and Istrian pharmacist Donato Ragosa plotted an assassination attempt on the Emperor. Oberdan's attempt failed. Oberdan was arrested and sentenced to hang by an Austrian court. His mother, Victor Hugo and Giosu√® Carducci appealed for clemency - but in vain. The condemned Oberdan refused all religious rites, stating \\"I am a mathematician and a freethinker, and do not believe in the immortality of the soul\\". Just before the execution, he cried \\"Viva l'Italia!\\" (Long live Italy!), which helped establish his later reputation as a martyr of the Italian National cause. Statues of him were erected in towns and cities throughout unified Italy. The Emperor Franz Joseph, who reigned another thirty-five years, never visited Trieste again. The subsequent assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, and the revival of irredentism that followed, harked back to Oberdan's earlier attempt. Legacy Various prominent monuments in Italy celebrate Oberdan. In Trieste, one of the central squares carries his name (Piazza Oberdan). In Florence, his name is inscribed in the Obelisk of the Fallen in the Wars of Independence in the square in front of Santa Maria Novella. The Slovene writer Boris Pahor wrote a novel with that title, in which he incorporated the events from Oberdan's life. The Italian writer Enzo Bettiza also depicted Oberdan in his novel \\"The Ghost of Trieste\\", under the fictitious name of Stefano Nardenk (Narden). A film adaptation of Oberdan's life was produced in 1915 by Tiber films of Rome. It starred Alberto Collo as Oberdan and was directed by Emilio Ghione, who also played the role of the governor of Trieste. It was one of a number of patriotic, irredentist films produced in Italy during World War One.Lotti, Denis (2007).Emilio Ghione, l'ultimo apache. Bologna: Edizioni Cineteca di Bologna. P.77 Emilio Ghione met the irredentist Gabriele D'Annunzio at an invitational showing of the film in Rome and Ghione's inter-titles were praised by D'Annunzio.Emilio Ghione (March‚ÄìDecember 1928). Memorie e Confessioni. Milan: Cinemalia magazine. p.78. John Gatt-Rutner, biographer of the Trieste writer Italo Svevo, suggests that Svevo - 21 years old at the time of Oberdan's execution - was deeply affected by it. In the aftermath, Svevo started writing regularly for the Trieste Irredentist paper L'Indepedente. He never mentioned Oberdan explicitly - the paper was heavily censored and the Austrian authorities considered any manifestation of sympathy for Oberdan as treason. However, on January 21, 1884, Svevo published a translation of Ivan Turgenev's story \\"The Worker and the Man with the White Hands\\", whose protagonist is sent to the gallows for a rebellious act on behalf of the oppressed; Svevo added the remark that \\"What is really moving is not the death of the man with the white hands, but his self-sacrifice on behalf of people who are unable to appreciate it.\\" Gatt-Rutner states that \\"Triestines could not miss the allusion to Oberdan, which clearly demonstrates the light in which [Svevo] viewed the matter\\".John Gatt-Rutner, \\"Italo Svevo, A Double Life\\", Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1988, Ch. 12-13 Notes References  External links *I giorni di Trieste: 1882 ‚Äì L‚Äôimpiccagione di Guglielmo Oberdan (2 December 2013) Category:1858 births Category:1882 deaths Category:People from Trieste Category:Irredentism Category:History of Trieste Category:19th-century Italian people Category:Executed Slovenian people Category:Executed Italian people Category:People executed by Austria-Hungary Category:Italian people of Slovene descent Category:TU Wien alumni Category:Freethought Category:Italian irredentism Category:1882 in Austria ","title":"Guglielmo Oberdan"},{"id":"5647246","text":"The 1979‚Äì80 UEFA Cup was won by Eintracht Frankfurt on away goals over Borussia M√∂nchengladbach.

Peripherals included an inexpensive printer and a very unusual quad phi-deck cassette tape system for storing programs and data.

The town is an independent municipality, within the administrative district of Ortaca. Dalyan achieved international fame in 1987 when developers wanted to build a luxury hotel on the nearby ƒ∞ztuzu Beach, a breeding ground for the endangered loggerhead sea turtle species. The incident created major international storm when David Bellamy championed the cause of conservationists such as June Haimoff, Peter G√ºnther, Nergis Yazgan, Lily Venizelos and Keith Corbett. The development project was temporarily stopped after Prince Philip called for a moratorium and in 1988 the beach and its hinterland were declared a protected area, viz. K√∂yceƒüiz-Dalyan Special Environmental Protection Area. Life in Dalyan revolves around the Dalyan √áayƒ± River which flows past the town. The boats that ply up and down the river, navigating the maze of reeds, are the preferred means of transport to all the local sites. Etymology River Dalyan Dalyan means \\"fishing weir\\" in Turkish. Bass, Mullet and Sea Bream swim upstream from the sea to K√∂yceƒüiz Lake where another large town of the region, K√∂yceƒüiz, is located. The fish spawn there, and when returning to the sea they are caught in the \\"dalyans\\". According to the turkish etymological dictionary Nisanyan S√∂zl√ºk, dalyan (ta aliana) derives from the greek word aliia (Œ±ŒªŒπŒµŒØŒ±) which means fishing. Economy In addition to its attraction as a tourist destination, the region around Dalyan is a highly fertile and productive agricultural zone. Cotton used to be grown intensively, but has now largely been replaced by pomegranate. In the area around K√∂yceƒüiz many other fruits (citrus fruits) and vegetables are grown, which are all on display in the market on Saturdays, the day when villagers come from miles around to sell their products. Tourism Lycian tombs near Dalyan across the Dalyan river Ancient Kaunos theater near Dalyan Above the river's sheer cliffs are the weathered fa√ßades of Lycian tombs cut from rock, circa 400 BC (). The ruins of the ancient trading city of Kaunos are a short boat trip across the river.Dalyan Guide & Access information The south of Dalyan on the Mediterranean coast, lies ƒ∞ztuzu Beach, near the village of the same name is a popular area for sunbathing and swimming. There are regular boat and minibus (dolmu≈ü) services to the beach. Visitors should be aware of the wooden stakes in the beach to mark nesting sites. The road route is particularly scenic, offering views of S√ºl√ºng√ºr Lake. In 2008 ƒ∞ztuzu Beach was proclaimed winner in the category Best Open Space (Europe) by The Times because of the eco-friendly exploitation of the beach. In 2011 Dalyan and ƒ∞ztuzu Beach were proclaimed Best Beach Destination of Europe by Dutch holiday assessment website Zoover.Dalyan heeft beste stranden, De Stentor, 06-07-2011 Conservation The beach is well known for the Caretta caretta (Loggerhead sea turtle), an endangered species that has existed for about 45 million years. International animal protection organizations monitor and protect the turtles' nesting grounds in Turkey. The beach is closed between 20.00 and 8:00 hours during the period that the turtles lay their eggs and hatchlings go out to sea (May to October).

It was the media market competitor to the morning edition of the Miami Herald for most of the 20th century. The paper started publishing in May 1896 as a weekly called The Miami Metropolis. The Metropolis had become a daily (except Sunday) paper of eight pages by 1903. On June 4, 1923, former Ohio governor James M. Cox bought the Metropolis and renamed it the Miami Daily News-Metropolis. On January 4, 1925 the newspaper became the Miami Daily News, and published its first Sunday edition. Cox had a new building erected for the newspaper, and the Miami News Tower was dedicated on July 25, 1925. This building later became famous as the Freedom Tower. Also on July 25, 1925, the News published a 508 page edition, which still holds the record for the largest page-count for a newspaper. The News was edited by Bill Baggs from 1957 until his death 1969. After that, it was edited by Sylvan Meyer until 1973. Its final editor was Howard Kleinberg, a longtime staffer and author of a comprehensive history of the newspaper. The paper had the distinction of posting its own demise on the final obituary page. In 1973, the News moved in with the Knight Ridder-owned Herald at One Herald Plaza, sharing production facilities with its morning rival while maintaining a separate editorial staff. A 30-year joint operating agreement inked in 1966 made the Herald responsible for all non-editorial aspects of production, including circulation, advertising and promotion. Citing losses of $9 million per year, declining circulation (from 112,000 in 1966 to 48,000 in 1988 while households in the Dade County area grew 80 percent) and owner Cox Newspapers unable to find a suitable buyer to save the paper, the News ceased publication on December 31, 1988. Some of the newspaper's staff and all of its assets and archives were moved to nearby Cox publication The Palm Beach Post in West Palm Beach. An entire searchable archive of the newspaper is available online via Newspapers.com. A small selection of photographs were donated to the Archives and Research Center of HistoryMiami. Notable former employees include writer Marjory Stoneman Douglas, Dorothy Misener Jurney, journalist and author Helen Muir, Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Don Wright, Boston Globe columnist Adrian Walker, photographer Michael O'Brien, columnist John Keasler and best-selling author Dary Matera, who served as a general assignment reporter from 1977 until 1982.

Scammell was born in Change Islands, where he grew up and received his early education. He was a schoolteacher in several Newfoundland outports during the 1930s. He left to attend McGill University and did not live full-time in Newfoundland again until 1970, after his retirement from teaching. Scammell is perhaps best known for his songwriting, most notably, \\"Squid-Jiggin' Ground\\", which he wrote while still in high school, and The Six-Horsepower Coaker. However, he also produced a significant body of work that was originally published in the magazine Atlantic Guardian, of which he was also a co-founder. Through essays and stories, Scammell attempted to convey some of the positive aspects of life in Newfoundland outports, which, despite their disadvantages, he saw as providing a sense of community and personal satisfaction that larger centres lacked. A collection of Scammell's work was published as My Newfoundland in 1966. In 1987, he became a Member of the Order of Canada. In 1977, he received his Honorary Doctor of Laws from Memorial University of Newfoundland and, in 2011, he was inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame (for \\"Squid-Jiggin' Ground\\").

Haysi and Honaker have a larger enrollment than the other schools in the district, sometimes leading to disparities, mostly in football. This is aggravated by Council choosing not to field a football team due to the schools small size and inability to produce enough athletes (typical Council football teams consisted of 15-20 players). In Scholastic Bowl, Honaker has been the dominant force, winning either the district regular season and/or district tournament for 12 consecutive years. While Haysi has traditionally been the dominant team in the sports arena winning nearly all of the boys track titles and a majority of the districts football titles.

It was established in 1995 by Universidad San Francisco de Quito in collaboration with Boston University, and is jointly managed by them as a center of education, research and conservation. A higher diversity of reptiles, amphibians, insects, birds and bats has been found there than anywhere else in South America, and possibly the world. It is located in the province of Orellana, about 280 km ESE from Quito, the capital city of Ecuador. It is located on the northern bank of the Tiputini River, and although separated from the Yasun√≠ National Park by the river, the station forms part of the Yasun√≠ Biosphere Reserve. The research site It is a field study facility in which students and other scientists perform different research projects. Although the station is geared towards research and education it is not strictly off limits to tourists. There are however no regular tours to the area. Its location near the Tiputini River provides a remote locale for ecological research on the Eastern Ecuadorian Amazon habitats of the Yasun√≠ Biosphere Reserve. It was built with sustainability in mind so deforestation was kept to a minimum when building the cabins and lab. The forest surrounding TBS is mostly terra firma, of which a tract of 6.5 km¬≤ is preserved by the TBS. Though consisting mainly of primary non-flooded forest, a rather narrow belt of flooded vegetation is also present towards the river, the stream tributaries and the surroundings of a small oxbow lake. Along the Tiputini River, several beaches become exposed during the dry season, but these are short stretches, never more than 100 meters in extent. Because of its remote location and agreements with local indigenous groups, no hunting of large mammals has occurred in the area and it is possible to habituate and study primates that are difficult to observe elsewhere. The discovery of further oil deposits in the region has put the station at risk from nearby development of petroleum extraction and transport infrastructure, though the impacts may be mitigated somewhat by voluntary concessions by the management company. It remains to be seen if promised environmental sensitivity is implemented in the field, however. Research and lodging facilities The facilities are located around the two-story lab. The station includes 9 cabins, a few labs, and a cafeteria. Four cabins are for the head researchers and employees that work there full-time and include 2 beds and a full bath. The other 5 cabins are for additional researchers and student groups that visit and include bunk beds and a full bath. The bathrooms have running water and flush toilets but no hot water. TBS has electricity available in the cabins for about 6 hours a day (3 in the afternoon and 3 at night), and for 24 hours in the lab. The station has a large cafeteria that can comfortably accommodate about 60 individuals. There are 3 meals served every day, with box lunches available to researchers in the field that may miss a scheduled meal. There is internet access but it is limited because of the physical location of the station. In the researcher‚Äôs downtime they can go on hikes to lookout towers around the facility. Research projects Tiputinia foetida, a local monotypic plant of the forest floor, which lacks chlorophyll, and sustains itself on subterranean fungi The station has been the site for many research projects and has led to the publication of many papers. Bird population studies, reproductive behavior, social structure, and seed dispersal characteristics have all been studied across multiple bird species. Primatology is a large topic of study in this area because of the diversity and abundance of primate species. One paper looked at the relationship between primates and naturally occurring mineral licks using camera traps to identify different species that visited the lick, as well as the frequency and duration of their visits.Blake, 2009 TBS has also been the host for many genetic research projects. One project looked at the genetic relationships between offspring and parents to determine reproductive behavior in manakins.Tori, 2006 This project was novel in using a new technique for sampling genetic material. Sampling of genetic material from offspring requires a sample from the bird after hatching or from the egg after it has developed to the extent that veins have become visible. These birds however suffer from high nest predation rates and consequently not all the offspring from a nest can be sampled. In order to surmount these problems researchers took eggs from the nests and replaced them with plaster eggs which the mother could take care of. In the meantime the eggs were incubated until they were ready to have a genetic sample taken. Afterwards the eggs were placed back in the nest with the mother. Other goals of the station TBS has initiated a river turtle nest project in which locals collect turtle eggs on the river banks by the Tiputini station and rear them in captivity. Their populations have been decimated in recent years due to collecting of turtle eggs for sale at market. Podocnemis unifilis has shown improvements in recent years, but P. expansa is still in danger in this region of the river.Tiputini Biodiversity Station, 2011 TBS also has camera traps set-up around the facility and in the neighboring forest to capture photos of the various species in the surrounding national forest. These camera traps are used to estimate population sizes of certain species and to document rare species. TBS also serves as a place to reintroduce captive animals into the wild. A black caiman farm near the station closed down and most of the captive caimans were introduced into the rivers near TBS. However, the main goal of this station is to provide a place for people to perform experiments and research. Indigenous people TBS is located near the Huaorani Reserve. These local people have not yet shown any malcontent toward the workers at the TBS and in fact a few stop by the station to ask for food or other supplies.Personal Correspondence, Dr. John Blake However, the Huaorani have shown aggressive behavior toward the oil companies that have tried to drill in their lands since the 1950s. Today some Huaorani can be found in villages along the side of the roads established by oil companies, but others still live in the deep jungle. Media Tiputini Biodiversity Station has been featured in the BBC series Andes to Amazon, in National Geographic and on National Public Radio. Notes References * Cisneros-Heredia, D. F. (2006).

The exposition on cryptanalysis included the use of tables of letter frequencies and sets of letters which cannot occur together in one word. Kahn therefore cited it as the first work in human history that described cryptology, because it described both cryptography and cryptanalysis.

Life and work He was born on July 16, 1934 in San Miguel de Tucum√°n and is generally considered an influential and innovative figure in Latin America both as journalist and a novelist. Eloy Mart√≠nez obtained a degree in Spanish and Latin American literature from the University of Tucum√°n, and an Masters of Art at the University of Paris. From 1957 to 1961 he was a film critic in Buenos Aires for the La Naci√≥n newspaper, and he then was editor in chief of the magazine Primera Plana between 1962 and 1969. From 1969 to 1970 he worked as a reporter in Paris. In 1969 Eloy Mart√≠nez interviewed former Argentine President Juan Domingo Per√≥n, who was exiled in Madrid. These interviews were the basis for two of his more celebrated novels: La Novela de Per√≥n (1985) and Santa Evita (1995).\\"Muere Tom√°s Eloy Mart√≠nez, el novelista de Per√≥n y Evita\\" El Mundo, accessed on February 1, 2010 In these as in many of his books he combined historical true facts with fictional content in a way unparalleled by any other Latin American writer. This drew comparisons to the work of Truman Capote, the American writer whom is in general credited with inventing the sub-genre in his famous novel In Cold Blood. In 1970 he and many former writers of Primera Plana worked at the magazine Panorama, where Eloy Mart√≠nez was the director. He also collaborated in the newspaper La Opinion, founded by Jacobo Timmerman. He is credited as helping Latin American writings be know around the world, including the Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez staple novel One Hundred Years of Solitude. On August 15, 1972 he learned of the uprising of political prisoners in the jail at Rawson, Chubut Province. Panorama was the only publication in Buenos Aires that reported the correct story of the affair in Rawson, which differed significantly from the official version of the de facto Argentine government. On 22 August he was fired at the behest of the government, whereupon he went to Rawson and the neighboring city of Trelew and from there he reported the Massacre of Trelew in his book The Passion According to Trelew. The book was banned by the Argentine dictatorship. For three years (1972‚Äì1975) Eloy Mart√≠nez was in charge of the cultural supplement of La Naci√≥n. La Opini√≥n was shut down by the military authorities who seized power in 1976. After this, he was forced to live in exile (1975‚Äì1983) and moved to Caracas, Venezuela, where he remained active as a journalist, co-founding the newspaper El Diario de Caracas. In his book The Memoirs of the General he recounts that he was threatened by the \\"Triple A\\", the Alianza Anticomunista Argentina, and on one occasion, gunmen held a pistol to the head of his three- year-old son because they were witnesses to a crime Eloy Mart√≠nez believed to be an operation led by the far-right paramilitary group. During the year 1984 he moved to the United States to the Washington, D.C., area and was a professor at the University of Maryland. In 1991, he participated in the creation and launch of the daily newspaper Siglo 21 (November 8, 1991), owned by businessman Alfonso Dau and published by Jorge Zepeda Patterson in Guadalajara, Mexico, which ran for seven years, until December 1998. Also, he created the literary supplement Primer Plano for the newspaper P√°gina/12 in Buenos Aires. The end of the 1990s saw him back in the United States, being entrusted as professor and director of the Latin American studies program at Rutgers University in New Jersey, although he maintained his collaboration with Latin American newspapers throughout this period, which was the inspiration as well for his last book Purgatory where he dealt with the sadness and melancholy of exile and the dire impact on the lives of the families of the \\"desaparecidos\\" (people that were kidnapped and presumed dead by the dictatorship known as \\"El Proceso\\"). Eloy Mart√≠nez was also a teacher and lecturer. He wrote columns for La Naci√≥n and the New York Times syndicate, and his articles have appeared in many newspapers and journals in Latin America. He was awarded the Guggenheim and Woodrow Wilson fellowships, and won the 2002 Premio Alfaguara de Novela for the novel Flight of the Queen.

The play was premiered at the Music Box Theatre, Broadway, on 19 February 1953 in a Theatre Guild production, directed by Joshua Logan, which ran for 477 performances. The original cast featured Ralph Meeker, Eileen Heckart, Arthur O'Connell, Janice Rule, Reta Shaw, Kim Stanley and Paul Newman. Inge won the 1953 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the work, and Logan received a Tony Award for Best Director. The play also won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best Play of the season. Picnic was Paul Newman's Broadway debut. An unknown at the time, Newman campaigned heavily for the leading role of Hal, but director Joshua Logan did not think Newman was physically large enough to convey the lead character's athletic attributes. As a result, Ralph Meeker was given the role of Hal opposite Janice Rule as Madge. Newman played Hal's former college roommate Alan Seymour while understudying the role of Hal. Newman eventually took over the lead role. Synopsis It is Labor Day, and everyone is preparing for a neighborhood picnic. Hal Carter, a drifter, arrives in town looking for work and visits his college friend Alan, who is dating Madge Owens with the intent to marry her. Hal does odd jobs for the welcoming Helen Potts. Her neighbor, Flo Owens, distrusts Hal, especially around her daughters, Madge and Millie. Since shy Millie does not have a date, neighbor Mrs. Potts suggests that Hal accompany her, much to the chagrin of Flo. Hal agrees, but he is much more interested in Madge. There is an undeniable attraction between the two, as much as they try to fight it. While getting ready for the picnic, the family and friends dance in Flo's backyard to music playing nearby. Hal grows on both Millie and Madge, and they both vie for his attention. Rosemary, an \\"old maid schoolteacher\\" who boards at the Owens house, notices, disapproves, and is attracted to the shirtless Hal as she waits for her Labor Day date, local shop proprietor Howard Bevans. As Madge and Hal dance passionately, and a drunken Rosemary later butts in so she can dance with Hal (and proceeds to rip his shirt when Howard pries her away from Hal), Millie gets sick from drinking too much whiskey while no one is paying attention. Rosemary blames Millie's drinking on her date Hal, and says he'll never rise beyond the gutter, and Flo joins in criticizing him. Hal sits in the shadows by himself while everyone leaves for the picnic. Rosemary and her boyfriend Howard decide to skip the picnic and go for a drive. Madge stays behind to change her dress. When she comes back outside and tries to console Hal, they kiss after a deep and revealing conversation. They run off together and spend the night in the car. Howard brings Rosemary back to the house. As he leaves, Rosemary begs him to marry her. When Madge and Hal return, Madge is ashamed of what they did. Hal asks for one more kiss, and their ‚Äúpassion is revived‚Äù.Inge, William. Four Plays. New York: Grove Press, 1958. p.133. In the morning, Flo is frantic because she has seen Madge crying hysterically. Rosemary leaves with Howard to get married, and everyone goes to the street to see her off. When Madge is left alone in the backyard, Hal shows up to talk to her. He has spent the night in hiding after Alan falsely reported to the police that Hal stole his car, in order to drive him out of town for \\"stealing\\" Madge. The others come back into the yard, and Hal leaves after defending himself when Alan arrives to drive him away, but only after telling Madge that he loves her and asks her to leave with him, despite Flo's presence and disapproval. Madge finally realizes that she loves him after he's gone, and she enters the house crying. Alan leaves, and it is obviously over between him and Madge. A little while later, Madge comes out of the house with a suitcase and tells her mother that she's going after Hal. The play ends with Flo watching her daughter leave.

A Life of William Inge. Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1989. p.128 This allows for little to no set changes and is a bit ironic in the fact that the play is called Picnic, but there are no picnic scenes.Voss, Ralph F. A Life of William Inge. Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1989. p.129 The houses are typically shown as a bit rundown and as naturalistic as possible. Music In this play, there are several instances where the characters reference piano and band music playing down the street. All are in act two's dancing scene, in which different characters dance together, get to know each other better, and some major conflict begins. Millie mentions the music when it is present in the play, and it seems to have some importance to her. She is a lover of art and changing the world, which can be done with music. Millie explains that the music is coming from a band called Ernie Higgins and his Happiness Boys.Inge, William. Four Plays. New York: Grove Press, 1958. p.117 The name suggests happiness, and brings with it a sense of freedom. Production history Picnic opened on Broadway at The Music Box Theatre in New York City on February 19, 1953. It was produced by The Theatre Guild and directed by Joshua Logan. The play's original cast included Ralph Meeker as Hal, Janice Rule as Madge, Kim Stanley as Millie, Peggy Concklin as Flo, and Paul Newman as Alan.Inge, William. Four Plays. New York: Grove Press, 1958. p.73 After that, the play toured throughout 1954 and 1955.Marill, Alvin H. More Theatre: Stage to Screen to Television, Vol II (M-Z). Metuchen: The Scarecrow Press, Inc., 1993. p.944 In 1955, Picnic was produced in several different states, including Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pennsylvania on May 30, the Pasadena Playhouse in Pasadena, California on July 28, and the Cape Playhouse in Dennis, Massachusetts in August. Picnic opened in England at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry on April 14, 1958, with scenery and costumes designed by Barry Kay. A revival was produced by Roundabout Theatre Company in 1994, starring Kyle Chandler, Tate Donovan, and Ashley Judd. Adaptations Paul Osborne was chosen to turn Picnic into a musical in the 1960s. It was called Hot September and instead of going to the Alvin Theatre on Broadway in October 1965, the musical premiered in Boston and closed within a few weeks. Another rewrite of Picnic, undertaken by Inge himself in the early 1970s, was titled Summer Brave. It opened at the Equity Library Theatre in New York in 1973, two months before Inge committed suicide.Hawkins-Dady, Mark (Editor). International Dictionary of Theatre ‚Äì 1: Plays. Chicago: St. James Press, 1992. p.613-614 The play only lasted 14 performances, but it was revived two years later at the ANTA Theatre. This time it lasted 18 performances.Marill, Alvin H. More Theatre: Stage to Screen to Television, Vol II (M-Z). Metuchen: The Scarecrow Press, Inc., 1993. p.945 Picnic was made into a film by Columbia Pictures, and was released in December 1955. It was directed by Joshua Logan. and nominated for six Academy Awards, of which it won two. William Holden, Kim Novak, Rosalind Russell, and Arthur O'Connell were the most prominent members of the cast. There was also a television special called Picnic ‚Äì Broadway on Showtime that aired on November 10, 1986, and featured Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gregory Harrison, Rue McClanahan, Dick Van Patten, Conchata Ferrell, Dana Hill, and Michael Learned. It was produced by Catalina Production Group, Ltd.Marill, Alvin H. More Theatre: Stage to Screen to Television, Vol II (M-Z). Metuchen: The Scarecrow Press, Inc., 1993. p.946 Another TV film was made in 2000, with Gretchen Mol, Josh Brolin, Chad Morgan, Bonnie Bedelia, Mary Steenburgen. The University of Kansas' operatic version of the play premiered April 8, 2008. Librettist and stage director Tim Ocel recalled, \\"When Forrest Pierce knocked on my door during the fall of 2006 and said he‚Äôd like to compose something for KU Opera, I jumped at the chance. The voice/opera division was just beginning to consider what our contribution to the 50th Murphy Hall celebration would be. I thought maybe we should create something; William Inge is the playwright and dramatic storyteller of 1950s Kansas, so why not explore the possibility of turning one of his plays into an opera? We both agreed that Picnic was the play that lent itself best to an operatic treatment. The libretto formed over the next six months, and by June 2007 Forrest was composing. The opera is a domestic comedy of sorts. Inge calls the play \\"A Summer Romance.\\" It's about everyday people... you and I... who have to figure out what it means to be alive and connected and useful in this world. It attempts to show the truth and the possibility of our everyday lives.\\" Inge's Picnic was used as the basis for an opera with the name, composed by Libby Larsen on a commission from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro's School of Music, Theatre and Dance. Larsen's Picnic premiered on Thursday, April 2, 2009 by UNCG, in Aycock Auditorium. The play was revived on Broadway in 2013 at the American Airlines Theatre, with a cast that featured Ellen Burstyn, Mare Winningham, Maggie Grace, Sebastian Stan, Reed Birney, and Elizabeth Marvel.https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/theater/reviews/picnic-at-american- airlines-theater.html At Home with Amy Sedaris season 3, Episode 3, titled \\"Outdoor Entertaining\\" is loosely based on this play. In The Golden Girls season 2, Episode 14, \\"The Actor\\", the women are cast in similar play. Reception Tom Jicha of the South Florida Sun Sentinel wrote in 2000 that by then, the Picnic franchise no longer had a \\"racy\\" and critically acclaimed reputation and had shifted to being perceived as being not critically acclaimed and \\"tamer than an episode of Dawson's Creek\\". According to Jicha, this meant that the TV movie produced by CBS airing that year, while not being \\"a washout\\" and \\"moderately entertaining couple of hours\\", had \\"a second-tier cast glad to take the work\\".

The main character of the series was introduced on an episode of Happy Days, then set in the early 1960s, but the show is set in the present-day of 1977.Note, however, The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946‚ÄìPresent doesn't include the series in its list of prime time spin- offs. . The series was a ratings flop and was cancelled after only 13 episodes. Synopsis Nancy Walker played Howard Cunningham's visiting cousin Nancy Blansky from Las Vegas on the February 4, 1977, episode of Happy Days. Blansky's Beauties premiered the following week, on February 12, 1977. Nancy Blansky (Walker) was a long-time Las Vegas showbiz vet (since the 1950s) and current den mother to a bevy of beautiful Las Vegas showgirls. In addition to keeping order in the chaotic apartment complex where they all lived, Nancy staged the girls' big numbers at the Oasis Hotel. Although the Happy Days episode on which Nancy first appeared took place in the late '50s, Blansky's Beauties itself was set in (then) present-day 1977. Emilio (Johnny Desmond), the ma√Ætre d', was Nancy's boyfriend. To help Nancy defray costs of her apartment, Ethel \\"Sunshine\\" Akalino (Lynda Goodfriend) and Bambi (Caren Kaye) shared it with her, along with her nephews Joey DeLuca (Eddie Mekka), a choreographer, and leering, 12-year-old (\\"going on 28\\"), Anthony DeLuca (Scott Baio). Anthony was forever trying to impress Bambi, who much to his chagrin treated him like a kid brother, as did almost all of Nancy's girls. Also sharing Nancy's apartment was a huge Great Dane named Blackjack who was shown in the opening credits playing blackjack. Links to parent show and other spin-offs Eddie Mekka's character Joey DeLuca was a younger cousin to Carmine Ragusa, Mekka's 1950s-era character on Laverne & Shirley. During production of Blansky's Beauties, Mekka continued in his starring roles on both series, a rare occurrence of one actor assuming two regular scripted roles, in two different primetime series, at the same time. The series' star, Nancy Walker, had just finished several seasons of the same situation in which she had co-starred simultaneously in both McMillan & Wife and Rhoda, while also maintaining her ongoing role as diner waitress Rosie, the spokesman for Bounty paper towels, which she continued during Blansky's Beauties. In episode 1 (\\"Blansky's Biking Beauty\\") Joey introduced Nancy Blansky to stunt motorcyclist Pinky Tuscadero (Roz Kelly) who was instantly hired for Nancy's stage show. Pinky wore the same outfit as in her Happy Days episodes, though her hair was now in a '70s style shag cut. She looked as though she had not aged in 20 years. The show also implied a link to then-ongoing show Laverne & Shirley; in the episode \\"Nancy Remembers Laverne,\\" Nancy recalls working with a clumsy girl named Laverne DeFazio (Penny Marshall's character on Laverne & Shirley) back around 1957. She discovered that, despite her clumsiness, Laverne was a great dancer and Nancy offered her a job on the spot, which Laverne declined. Pat Morita, after the failure of his series Mr. T and Tina, was added to the cast as Arnold, the character he originated on Happy Days. As with Pinky Tuscadero, he seemed not to have aged in 20 years' time. Here he ran a coffee shop, whereas in Happy Days, he owned the diner. Morita would re- join the cast of Happy Days five years later, while his replacement on that series, Al Molinaro, would repeat Morita's career move at that time by joining another Happy Days spin-off, Joanie Loves Chachi. After the end of Blansky's Beauties, Lynda Goodfriend and Scott Baio would join the cast of Happy Days at the start of the 1977‚Äì78 season. Goodfriend and Baio, along with their Blansky's Beauties co-stars Caren Kaye, Shirley Kirkes and Elaine Bolton, would appear in a similarly-plotted pilot, Legs, for NBC in 1978, using different character names. This project would be revised further and appear on the network as Who's Watching the Kids? in the fall of that year, lasting half a season. Garry Marshall, creator of Blansky's Beauties and the aforementioned Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, and Joanie Loves Chachi, et al., had a recurring role as Nancy's employer, the enigmatic Mr. Smith.

He served as a judge for the Comedy Central series The High Court with Doug Benson. In 2007, he starred in the film Super High Me, a documentary about marijuana usage. Benson also currently hosts the popular Doug Loves Movies podcast along with his weekly marijuana video podcast show Getting Doug with High. His Comedy Central series The Benson Interruption ended its first season in December 2010 and was turned into a monthly podcast in January 2011. Early life Benson was born and raised in San Diego, California, to parents Wendy (Young), a pharmacy clerk, and Robert Matthew Benson, a former English teacher turned salesman. Doug attended Grossmont High School and was active in the drama department. He also collaborated with a friend on several 8 mm action/thriller short movies during his junior and senior years. After attending Grossmont College, a community college in El Cajon, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. Benson was raised Methodist. As a child, Benson struggled with vertigo and poor depth perception as a result of his close-set eyes. Career =Early career= While in Los Angeles, Benson began doing stand-up after he and two other friends dared each other to. One of them didn't show, and the other one signed up too late. Benson claimed that \\"I went in anyway and did my three minutes of whatever I could come with and people actually laughed.\\" At the age of 22, Benson began performing regularly as a stand-up comedian; however, it wasn't until 28 that he became a stoner, after a week's worth of gigs smoking pot afterwards alongside Brian Posehn and Greg Proops. He made his earliest television appearances as a stand-up in the late 1980s and early 1990s on programs such as Comedy Central's The A-List and Two Drink Minimum and was one of the featured comedians in the cast of Joel Hodgson's sketch-comedy pilot The TV Wheel which aired on Comedy Central in 1995. One of Benson's earliest jobs in television was writing for the MTV game-show Trashed in 1994. Along with comedian friends Arj Barker and Tony Camin, Benson co-created and performed in the comedy stage-show The Marijuana-Logues. He also hosted High Times ' 6th annual Stony Awards with rapper Redman. =Comedy albums= Benson appeared on the comedy compilation album Comedy Death-Ray. On August 4, 2009, Benson's second album, Unbalanced Load, was released by Comedy Central Records. His third album, Hypocritical Oaf was released on August 31, 2010. Benson aims to record a new album every April 20 (with a subsequent summer release date) for as many consecutive years as possible. Benson's fourth album, Potty Mouth, was released on August 29, 2011. The pattern continued with the release of his fifth album, Smug Life, which was released on July 3, 2012, and Gateway Doug, his sixth album, released on July 9, 2013. On July 8, 2014, Doug released a sequel to Gateway Doug entitled Gateway Doug 2: Forced Fun. His latest album release is Promotional Tool which came out on June 9, 2015. =Doug Loves Movies podcast= In 2006, Benson began hosting a weekly comedy podcast, titled Doug Loves Movies (formerly I Love Movies with Doug Benson), which is recorded in front of a live audience at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in Los Angeles. The show typically tapes weekly, and is later archived on iTunes for fans to listen to for free. Benson and guests talk about movies and comedy both. Benson's guests have included such notables as Daniel Van Kirk as Mark Wahlberg, John Lithgow, Leonard Maltin, Brian Posehn, Joe Rogan, Zach Galifianakis, Sarah Silverman, Patton Oswalt, Jon Hamm, Adam Carolla, David Cross, Bob Odenkirk, Scott Aukerman, Adam Scott, Ron Bennington, Aziz Ansari, Amy Poehler, Wayne Federman, Elisabeth Shue, Aubrey Plaza, Michael Cera, Edgar Wright, Paul F. Tompkins, T.J. Miller, Kumail Nanjiani, Gillian Jacobs, Michael Sheen. A regular feature of the podcast is the Leonard Maltin Game, which has been described as Name That Tune with movies instead of songs.Culture Mob article: \\"Doug Benson at the Arlington Cinema Drafthouse.\\" The game consists of Benson reading excerpts from a Leonard Maltin review and guests wagering how many names, read from the bottom of the cast list up, it would take for them to identify the movie. Other regular features of the podcast include the segments Tweet Relief: Tweets About Movies, Watch This/Not That, Not for Emetophobes, and From the Corrections Department, as well as the games Build a Title, Name a Movie, A-B-C-Deez Nuts, How Much Did This Shit Make?, Lincoln or Bane?, Love, Like, Hate, Hate-Like, Doing Lines with Mark Wahlberg, Last Man Stanton, Whose Tagline Is It Anyway, Now Buscemi Now You Don't, Tell The Truth!, Live Die Repeat, Alex and Jason and Deb's IMDB game, and F Marry Kill: Movies. At the conclusion of many of the early podcasts, Doug would state \\"As always, Willem Dafoe is a Shithead,\\" which resulted in so many people wondering about why, that Google searches began to automatically complete the phrase as a suggested match. The Willem Dafoe comment started as a joke based on the fact that it would seemingly be the only bad words ever uttered about Dafoe, but many people didn't catch on and, after explaining it a few times, Benson decided to let Dafoe rest. Until 2019, the runners up in the Leonard Maltin game are allowed to name one shithead as a consolation prize. Starting in early 2019, Benson now closes the show with \\"Positive Energy\\" in honor of his late friend, Brody Stevens In 2010, Benson started an annual, 2 hour Twelve Guests of Christmas special every holiday season. This episode features 12 guests (occasionally more) rather than the usual 3 guests and they play an elimination style Leonard Maltin Game. Scott Aukerman won the first year, while Graham Elwood dominated the next two years in a row. The 2013 champion was podcast fan and Pardcast-A-Thon auction winner, Sean Sakimae. Sakimae also qualified for the next Tournament of Champions for naming the film Titanic in negative names and winning the game. Riki Lindhome beat Jimmy Pardo in the finals of the 2014 edition when Pardo couldn't get the name Lori Singer when going negative three on Footloose. Scott Aukerman bested Sarah Silverman for his second win in 2015. In addition to Doug Loves Movies, Benson has begun recording The Benson Interruption and releasing it as a monthly podcast for $1.99 and has appeared on numerous other podcasts, including Comedy Bang! Bang!, The Joe Rogan Experience, WTF with Marc Maron, The Adam Carolla Show, Nerdist with Chris Hardwick, Mohr Stories, You Made It Weird with Pete Holmes, Never Not Funny, and Who Charted with Howard Kremer and Kulap Vilaysack. =Getting Doug With High = Benson started a weekly talk-show on YouTube entitled Getting Doug with High, that generally airs live every Wednesday at 4:15 p.m PST. Benson invites featured guests to recreationally smoke marijuana with him at 4:20. He asks them questions and discusses topics (usually related to marijuana), and at the end of the show, he makes them watch a magic trick. Notable guests on the show include Cheech Marin, Tommy Chong, Kevin Smith, Jay Chandrasekhar, Jack Black, Andy Richter, Dan Harmon, Michael Ian Black, Sarah Silverman, Pete Holmes, David Cross, Aubrey Plaza, Greg Proops, Joey Diaz, Horatio Sanz, Jenny Slate, Ron Funches, Jeff Ross, Doug Stanhope, Todd Glass, Brian Posehn, Anthony Jeselnik, Margaret Cho, Kyle Kinane, and Reggie Watts as well as comedy groups Trailer Park Boys, Workaholics, and Broad City. Occasionally, the show is done in front of a live audience in Los Angeles where the performers take turns inhaling from bags of vaporized cannabis. =Super High Me= In 2008, Benson was the protagonist of the film Super High Me (a play on the name and concept of the film Super Size Me), released on DVD on June 10, 2008. In the movie, Benson compares the results of not smoking any marijuana at all for 30 days versus the effects of smoking as much marijuana as possible for the same amount of time. The film was produced by Red Envelope Entertainment. The results of the experiment were that it had little or no negative effects on Doug's health. Doug is currently suing the people who made the original film to stop a sequel. =The Benson Interruption= On November 5, 2010 Comedy Central began airing The Benson Interruption, hosted by Benson. The show is based on the live stand-up comedy showcase of the same name that he has hosted in Los Angeles for many years. Special guests for the series include comedians Chris Hardwick, Patton Oswalt, Brian Posehn, Adam Carolla, Nick Swardson, Rob Huebel, Nick Kroll, Thomas Lennon, Mary Lynn Rajskub and Eugene Mirman. The show spun off into a monthly audio-only podcast on January 21, 2011, which took the TV show's format and altered it slightly by allowing the performances and conversations to play out in longer unedited episodes. =The High Court with Doug Benson= Benson starred as the judge on The High Court with Doug Benson, a comedic court show on Comedy Central. During each episode Benson is under the influence of cannabis. All of the cases featured are real and all of his rulings are real and legally binding. The series premiered on February 28, 2017. After hearing the case with his guest bailiff, Judge Doug and the bailiff retire to his chambers where they smoke marijuana while deciding the case. Special guest bailiffs for the series include comedians Tiffany Haddish, Michael Ian Black, Reggie Watts, Todd Glass, Rory Scovel, Brandon Wardell, and others. The series is produced by JASH and Propagate Content. =Other film work= While working as a stand-in on numerous movies in the 1980s, he had visible roles as an extra in films such as Blade Runner, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, About Last Night and a backup dancer in the Disney theme park attraction Captain EO.WTF with Marc Maron podcast episode: \\"Episode 131 - Doug Benson.\\"Who Charted? podcast episode: \\"Episode 48 - Emotional Luggage.\\" =Other television work= In the mid to late 1990s, Benson had small roles on HBO's Mr. Show with Bob and David, which was co-created by his friend David Cross. He also had small roles on Curb Your Enthusiasm, How I Met Your Mother, The Sarah Silverman Program, Yes, Dear, and Friends. In 2007, Benson was a contestant on fifth season of the NBC reality show Last Comic Standing. He was voted off the program during the ninth episode, earning him 6th place overall.Pittsburglive.com article: \\"Comedian Doug Benson going up in a cloud of success.\\" In the 2000s, the comedian regularly appeared on the VH1 show Best Week Ever and taped several episodes of Comedy Central Presents. On December 29, 2009, Benson had a documentary special called The High Road with Doug Benson air on the G4 network. The special followed Benson and comedian Graham Elwood on one of their stand-up comedy tours. Benson regularly appears as a panelist on the Comedy Central program @midnight, and during the week of January 4‚Äì7, 2016, was featured during a weeklong special titled the \\"Benson Bowl,\\" featuring many marijuana-related games. Benson currently ranks first in number of appearances on the show, as well as victories. Red Eye incident On March 17, 2009, the host of the Fox News comedy program Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld along with Benson as a panelist, joked about Canadian Lieutenant General Andrew Leslie's statement that the Canadian Armed Forces may require a one-year \\"synchronized break\\" once Canada's mission in Afghanistan ends in 2011. \\"Meaning, the Canadian military wants to take a breather to do some yoga, paint landscapes, run on the beach in gorgeous white Capri pants,\\" Gutfeld said. \\"I didn't even know they were in the war\\", added Benson, then continued, \\"I thought that's where you go if you don't want to fight. Go chill in Canada.\\" Gutfeld also said: \\"Isn't this the perfect time to invade this ridiculous country? They have no army!\\" The segment drew wide attention and outrage in Canada after being posted on YouTube following the reported deaths of four Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan three days earlier. Canada, at the time, had been in command of the NATO mission in the Kandahar Province, the birthplace and former Taliban capital, for the past three years. Along with the Helmand Province, the two provinces were \\"home to some of the fiercest opposition to coalition forces\\" and reported to \\"have the highest casualty rates per province.\\" Canadian Defence Minister Peter MacKay called on Fox to apologize for the satirical comments, describing the remarks as \\"despicable, hurtful and ignorant.\\" Benson was scheduled to appear in Canada at Edmonton's The Comic Strip April 3‚Äì5, 2009, but the shows were canceled after the owner received threats of \\"bodily injury\\" toward the American comic. \\"Some were saying he wouldn't make it from the airport to the club. For everyone's safety, we decided it was best to avoid the scenario altogether,\\" said manager Rick Bronson. Benson offered an apology following the incident on CTV News Power Play with Tom Clark. The comedian stated that he was \\"ignorant about the situation in Afghanistan\\" and that the timing of the jokes were \\"completely out of line\\". \\"I honestly said things, in retrospect, I completely regret\\" said Benson and he has vowed to \\"never appear on the show again\\".

Retrieved June 19, 2019. The Lafayette Theatre opened on November, 1912. In 1913 the Lafayette became the first major theater to desegregate. African-American theatergoers were allowed to sit in orchestra seats instead of the balcony, to which they were relegated in other New York theaters. The Lafayette Players, the resident stock company, played before almost exclusively African-American audiences both in plays from white theater repertory and in the classics. The theater presented such Broadway hits as Madame X and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. From 1916‚Äì1919, the theatre was managed by Quality Amusement. Robert Levy, the owner of this entertainment company, drew large audiences of both blacks and whites with his sophisticated productions and groundbreaking work with black actors. In 1923, Duke Ellington made his New York debut while performing in Wilbur Sweatman's band at the Lafayette, and later performed with his own group at the venue. This was all due to producer/director Leonard Harper who Ellington lived with as a boarder in his larger Harlem apartment at the time. Ellington and his orchestra also appeared at the Lafayette in October 1927 with the singer Adelaide Hall in the show Jazz Mania.

Harlem Renaissance playwright Eulalie Spence's play On Being Forty premiered at the Lafayette Theatre on October 15th, 1924. Although the play was never published, the Lafayette performance was reviewed by George S. Schuyler, providing all that is presently known about the play, as no extant copies have been found. Schuyler would later become known as \\"the most prominent African American journalist and essayist of the early twentieth century.\\"Miller, Henry D.

The Lafayette Theatre reached the height of its fame with the Voodoo Macbeth, a production of Shakespeare's Macbeth, adapted and staged by Orson Welles that ran April 14‚ÄìJune 20, 1936. This show had an all African-American cast. It was a production of the Federal Theatre Project which was part of the Works Project Administration. The overture was by James P. Johnson and such notable actors as Canada Lee and Rose McClendon were part of the program. The production was universally known in advance as the \\"Voodoo Macbeth\\" because the setting was changed from Scotland to a fictional Caribbean island based on Haiti, and acquired its nickname due to its use of voodoo imagery in place of the witchcraft in the original play. In 1951 the building was acquired by Williams Institutional Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. The original facade was replaced in 1990, to the distress of advocates of historic preservation. The building was demolished in 2013, replaced by an eight-story apartment building called the Lafayette.

Over 12 professional seasons, he amassed La Liga totals of 276 matches and 55 goals, mostly at Betis (six) and M√°laga (three), after starting his career at Real Madrid. Playing career =Club= Real Madrid Fernando was born in M√°laga, Andalusia. After starting at hometown's M√°laga CF, he finished his football grooming in the ranks of La Liga giants Real Madrid, going on to appear once for its first team in the 1999‚Äì2000 season, against Real Zaragoza (90 minutes, 1‚Äì0 home win). After that, Fernando joined Real Valladolid on loan as many Real Madrid canteranos would move to that club in that timeframe (Alberto Marcos, V√≠ctor, Jos√© Garc√≠a Calvo, etc.). Betis In the summer of 2002, Fernando signed with top division club Real Betis, scoring 15 goals in his debut campaign, with the team finishing in eighth place thanks greatly to his braces against M√°laga (3‚Äì0), RCD Espanyol (4‚Äì2) and Real Sociedad (3‚Äì2). He won the only trophy of his career in 2005, the 2‚Äì1 Copa del Rey victory over CA Osasuna. On 27 June 2008, as his role with Betis was a lesser one from 2005 to 2008 ‚Äì only ten matches in his last season ‚Äì Fernando signed a four-year contract with M√°laga, returning to his first youth club after 11 years. M√°laga and later years Fernando netted his first league goal for M√°laga on 23 September 2009 against Espanyol, more than one year after arriving; however, this happened in a 1‚Äì2 away loss. Sparingly used in his debut season, he became a starter in 2009‚Äì10, scoring on five occasions. Fernando continued in the starting lineups in the 2010‚Äì11 campaign, under new manager Jesualdo Ferreira. In the second matchday, he scored twice in a 5‚Äì3 win at Zaragoza, the first goal coming after just 73 seconds; rarely used by the following coach, Manuel Pellegrini, he still contributed 21 games as the Boquerones finally avoided relegation. On 21 August 2011, the 32-year-old Fernando was released from his M√°laga contract. He moved abroad for the first time on 4 February of the following year, joining several compatriots at Hungarian side Di√≥sgy≈ëri VTK; he retired from football in June 2013. =International= Fernando won four caps for Spain at under-21 level, in six months. His first arrived on 27 February 2001, when he played the second half of the 4‚Äì0 friendly defeat of England in Birmingham. Coaching career Fernando started working as a full-time manager in 2016, with amateurs CD El Palo which he had already coached briefly the previous year after starting out with their youths.

Ephs form the largest known subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Both Eph receptors and their corresponding ephrin ligands are membrane-bound proteins that require direct cell-cell interactions for Eph receptor activation. Eph/ephrin signaling has been implicated in the regulation of a host of processes critical to embryonic development including axon guidance, formation of tissue boundaries, cell migration, and segmentation. Additionally, Eph/ephrin signaling has recently been identified to play a critical role in the maintenance of several processes during adulthood including long-term potentiation, angiogenesis, and stem cell differentiation and cancer.  Subclasses  Ephs can be divided into two subclasses, EphAs and EphBs (encoded by the genetic loci designated EPHA and EPHB respectively), based on sequence similarity and on their binding affinity for either the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked ephrin-A ligands or the transmembrane-bound ephrin-B ligands. Of the 16 Eph receptors (see above) that have been identified in animals, humans are known to express nine EphAs (EphA1-8 and EphA10) and five EphBs (EphB1-4 and EphB6). In general, Ephs of a particular subclass bind preferentially to all ephrins of the corresponding subclass, but have little to no cross-binding to ephrins of the opposing subclass. It has recently been proposed that the intrasubclass specificity of Eph/ephrin binding could be partially attributed to the different binding mechanisms used by EphAs and EphBs. There are exceptions to the intrasubclass binding specificity observed in Ephs, however, as it has recently been shown that ephrin-B3 can bind to and activate EphA4 and that ephrin-A5 can bind to and activate EphB2. EphA/ephrinA interaction typically occur with higher affinity than EphB/ephrin-B interactions which can partially be attributed to the fact that ephrin-As bind via a \\"lock-and-key\\" mechanism that requires little conformational change of the EphAs in contrast to EphBs which utilize an \\"induced fit\\" mechanism that requires a greater amount of energy to alter the conformation of EphBs to bind to ephrin-Bs. 16 Ephs have been identified in animals and are listed below: * EPHA1, EPHA2, EPHA3, EPHA4, EPHA5, EPHA6, EPHA7, EPHA8, EPHA9, EPHA10 * EPHB1, EPHB2, EPHB3, EPHB4, EPHB5, EPHB6  Activation  The extracellular domain of Eph receptors is composed of a highly conserved globular ephrin ligand-binding domain, a cysteine-rich region and two fibronectin type III domains. The cytoplasmic domain of Eph receptors is composed of a juxtamembrane region with two conserved tyrosine residues, a tyrosine kinase domain, a sterile alpha motif (SAM), and a PDZ- binding motif. Following binding of an ephrin ligand to the extracellular globular domain of an Eph receptor, tyrosine and serine residues in the juxtamembrane region of the Eph become phosphorylated allowing the intracellular tyrosine kinase to convert into its active form and subsequently activate or repress downstream signaling cascades. The structure of the trans- autophosphorylation of the juxtamembrane region of EPHA2 has been observed within a crystal of EPHA2.  Function  The ability of Ephs and ephrins to mediate a variety of cell-cell interactions places the Eph/ephrin system in an ideal position to regulate a variety of different biological processes during embryonic development. = Bi-directional signaling = Unlike most other RTKs, Ephs have a unique capacity to initiate an intercellular signal in both the receptor-bearing cell (\\"forward\\" signaling) and the opposing ephrin- bearing cell (\\"reverse\\" signaling) following cell-cell contact, which is known as bi-directional signaling. Although the functional consequences of Eph/ephrin bi-directional signaling have not been completely elucidated, it is clear that such a unique signaling process allows for ephrin Ephs to have opposing effects on growth cone survival and allows for the segregation of Eph-expressing cells from ephrin-expressing cells. = Segmentation = Segmentation is a basic process of embryogenesis occurring in most invertebrates and all vertebrates by which the body is initially divided into functional units. In the segmented regions of the embryo, cells begin to present biochemical and morphological boundaries at which cell behavior is drastically different ‚Äì vital for future differentiation and function. In the hindbrain, segmentation is a precisely defined process. In the paraxial mesoderm, however, development is a dynamic and adaptive process that adjusts according to posterior body growth. Various Eph receptors and ephrins are expressed in these regions, and, through functional analysis, it has been determined that Eph signaling is crucial for the proper development and maintenance of these segment boundaries. Similar studies conducted in zebrafish have shown similar segmenting processes within the somites containing a striped expression pattern of Eph receptors and their ligands, which is vital to proper segmentation - the disruption of expression resulting in misplaced or even absent boundaries. = Axon guidance = As the nervous system develops, the patterning of neuronal connections is established by molecular guides that direct axons (axon guidance) along pathways by target and pathway derived signals. Eph/ephrin signaling regulates the migration of axons to their target destinations largely by decreasing the survival of axonal growth cones and repelling the migrating axon away from the site of Eph/ephrin activation. This mechanism of repelling migrating axons through decreased growth cone survival depends on relative levels of Eph and ephrin expression and allows gradients of Eph and ephrin expression in target cells to direct the migration of axon growth cones based on their own relative levels of Eph and ephrin expression. Typically, forward signaling by both EphA and EphB receptors mediates growth cone collapse while reverse signaling via ephrin-A and ephrin-B induces growth cone survival. The ability of Eph/ephrin signaling to direct migrating axons along Eph/ephrin expression gradients is evidenced in the formation of the retinotopic map in the visual system, with graded expression levels of both Eph receptors and ephrin ligands leading to the development of a resolved neuronal map (for a more detailed description of Eph/ephrin signaling see \\"Formation of the Retinotopic Map\\" in ephrin). Further studies then showed the role of Eph‚Äôs in topographic mapping in other regions of the central nervous system, such as learning and memory via the formation of projections between the septum and hippocampus. In addition to the formation of topographic maps, Eph/ephrin signaling has been implicated in the proper guidance of motor neuron axons in the spinal cord. Although several members of Ephs and ephrins contribute to motor neuron guidance, ephrin-A5 reverse signaling has been shown to play a critical role in the survival of motor neuron growth cones and to mediate growth cone migration by initiating repellence in EphA-expressing migrating axons. = Cell migration = More than just axonal guidance, Ephs have been implicated in the migration of neural crest cells during gastrulation. In the chick and rat embryo trunk, the migration of crest cells is partially mediated by EphB receptors. Similar mechanisms have been shown to control crest movement in the hindbrain within rhombomeres 4, 5, and 7, which distribute crest cells to brachial arches 2, 3, and 4 respectively. In C. elegans a knockout of the vab-1 gene, known to encode an Eph receptor, and its Ephrin ligand vab-2 results in two cell migratory processes being affected. = Angiogenesis = Eph receptors are present in high degrees during vasculogenesis (angiogenesis) and other early development of the circulatory system. This development is disturbed without it. It is thought to distinguish arterial and venous endothelium, stimulating the production of capillary sprouts as well as in the differentiation of mesenchyme into perivascular support cells. The construction of blood vessels requires the coordination of endothelial and supportive mesenchymal cells through multiple phases to develop the intricate networks required for a fully functional circulatory system. The dynamic nature and expression patterns of the Ephs make them, therefore, ideal for roles in angiogenesis. Mouse embryonic models show expression of EphA1 in mesoderm and pre-endocardial cells, later spreading up into the dorsal aorta then primary head vein, intersomitic vessels, and limb bud vasculature, as would be consistent with a role in angiogenesis. Different class A Eph receptors have also been detected in the lining of the aorta, brachial arch arteries, umbilical vein, and endocardium. Complementary expression of EphB2/ephrin-B4 was detected in developing arterial endothelial cells and EphB4 in venous endothelial cells. Expression of EphB2 and ephrin-B2 was also detected on supportive mesenchymal cells, suggesting a role in wall development through mediation of endothelial- mesenchymal interactions. Blood vessel formation during embryogenesis consists of vasculogenesis, the formation of a primary capillary network followed by a second remodeling and restructuring into a finer tertiary network - studies utilizing ephrin-B2 deficient mice showed a disruption of the embryonic vasculature as a result of a deficiency in the restructuring of the primary network. Functional analysis of other mutant mice have led to the development of a hypothesis by which Ephs and ephrins contribute to vascular development by restricting arterial and venous endothelial mixing, thus stimulating the production of capillary sprouts as well as in the differentiation of mesenchyme into perivascular support cells, an ongoing area of research. = Limb development = While there is currently little evidence to support this (and mounting evidence to refute it), some early studies implicated the Ephs to play a part in the signaling of limb development. In chicks, EphA4 is expressed in the developing wing and leg buds, as well as in the feather and scale primordia. This expression is seen in the distal end of the limb buds, where cells are still undifferentiated and dividing, and appears to be under the regulation of retinoic acid, FGF2, FGF4, and BMP-2 ‚Äì known to regulate limb patterning. EphA4 defective mice do not present abnormalities in limb morphogenesis (personal communication between Andrew Boyd and Nigel Holder), so it is possible that these expression patterns are related to neuronal guidance or vascularisation of the limb with further studies being required to confirm or deny a potential role of Eph in limb development. = Cancer = As a member of the RTK family and with responsibilities as diverse as Ephs, it is not surprising to learn that the Ephs have been implicated in several aspects of cancer. While used extensively throughout development, Ephs are rarely detected in adult tissues. Elevated levels of expression and activity have been correlated with the growth of solid tumors, with Eph receptors of both classes A and B being over expressed in a wide range of cancers including melanoma, breast, prostate, pancreatic, gastric, esophageal, and colon cancer, as well as hematopoietic tumors. Increased expression was also correlated with more malignant and metastatic tumors, consistent with the role of Ephs in governing cell movement. It is possible that the increased expression of Eph in cancer plays several roles, first, by acting as survival factors or as a promoter of abnormal growth. The angiogenic properties of the Eph system may increase vascularisation of and thus growth capacity of tumors. Second, elevated Eph levels may disrupt cell-cell adhesion via cadherin, known to alter expression and localisation of Eph receptors and ephrins, which is known to further disrupt cellular adhesion, a key feature of metastatic cancers. Third, Eph activity may alter cell matrix interactions via integrins by the sequestering of signaling molecules following Eph receptor activation, as well as providing potential adherence via ephrin ligand binding following metastasis.  Discovery and history  The Eph receptors were initially identified in 1987 following a search for tyrosine kinases with possible roles in cancer, earning their name from the erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma cell line from which their cDNA was obtained. These transmembranous receptors were initially classed as orphan receptors with no known ligands or functions, and it was some time before possible functions of the receptors were known. When it was shown that almost all Eph receptors were expressed during various well-defined stages of development in assorted locations and concentrations, a role in cell positioning was proposed, initiating research that revealed the Eph/ephrin families as a principle cell guidance system during vertebrate and invertebrate development.

Pre-Hispanic oral tradition  The artistic production of the pre-Hispanic period, especially art produced under the Incan Empire, is largely unknown. Literature produced in the central-Andean region of modern-day Ecuador, Per√∫, Bolivia and Chile, is thought to have been transmitted orally alone, though the quipu of the Inka and earlier Andean civilizations increasingly casts this into doubt. It consisted of two main poetic forms: harawis (from the Quechua language)--- a form of lyrical poetry ---and hayllis--- a form of epic poetry. Both forms described the daily life and rituals of the time, and were recited by a poet known as the harawec. Orally transmitted folktales expressed the cosmology of the Andean world, and included creation and destruction myths. Many of these stories have survived until the present, thanks in no small part to the efforts of early chroniclers such as Inca Garcilaso, who rediscovered Quechua poetry, and Guam√°n Poma de Ayala, who preserved mythology. Their inclusion in the \\"official canon\\" was a slow process, as they were not viewed with seriousness. For instance, Jose de la Riva Ag√ºero, in his 1905 thesis Character of the Literature of Independent Peru considered the Pre-Hispanic literary tradition \\"insufficient\\" and unimportant in the formation of any new literary tradition. It was resurrected from obscurity in the 20th century, by a number of literary scholars and anthropologists who compiled and rescued Pre-Hispanic myths and legends. Among them are: # Adolfo Vienrich - 'Tarmap Pacha Huaray (translated as 'Azucenas quechuas or Quechuan lilies), compiled in 1905; and Tarmapap Pachahuarainin (translated as Fabulas Quechuas or Quechuan fables), compiled in 1906 # Jorge Basadre - 'La literatura inca (Incan Literature), 1938; En torno a la literatura quechua (Regarding Quechua Literature), 1939. # Jos√© Mar√≠a Arguedas, who translated the Huarochir√≠ Manuscript, a 17th-century text on indigenous Andean mythology and religion, also known as Hombres y dioses de Huarochir√≠ (Men and Gods of Huarochiri) # Martin Lienhard - 'La voz y su huella.

He speaks of a great tradition of \\"enormous textual mass\\" which was marginalized and sidelined by the Western scriptural system. Luis Alberto S√°nchez, on the other hand, employed elements of the Pre- Hispanic tradition to illustrate his theory of a racially mixed \\"Creole\\" literature of both indigenous and Iberian parentage. To this end, he cited chronicles by authors such as Cieza, Betanzos and Garcilaso.  Colonial Literature  = Literature of Peru's Discovery and Conquest = The literature of Peru's discovery and conquest includes all works produced in the region during its discovery and conquest by Spain. It can also refer to literature produced roughly around this time. The period begins on November 15, 1532 in Cajamarca with the capture of the last Inca lord, Atahualpa; it ends with the complete dismantling of the Incan Empire and the founding of the city of Lima. The principal literary manifestations of this period are in the form of chronicles of discovery, or are epistolary in nature. Major works which explore the literature of this time include: Francisco Carrillo's Enciclopedia hist√≥rica de la literatura peruana (Historical Encyclopedia of Peruvian Literature), and various tomes by Ra√∫l Porras Barrenechea which detail the works of the early chroniclers.  Spanish chroniclers  First page of the Chr√≥nica del Per√∫ by Pedro Cieza de Le√≥n According to Francisco Carrillo, the early chroniclers could be divided into various groups. The first is the group of chroniclers detailing the conquest. The majority of these were writers and soldiers who were responsible for producing official transcripts of military expeditions. There was also a small group of non- official chroniclers or personal diarists who provided unique personal insights on the effort to subdue and colonize the region. Both groups coexisted during the first period of the Peruvian conquest, which took place between 1532 and 1535. For the most part, these chroniclers all wrote from the perspective of the conqueror, whose mission was to \\"civilize\\" and \\"reveal the true faith\\" to the native peoples of Peru. Therefore, many of their descriptions and the motivations they ascribe to the indigenous peoples of the region are distorted and in error. Among the official Spanish chroniclers were Francisco Xerez, personal secretary of Pizarro, who wrote the Verdadera relaci√≥n de la conquista del Per√∫ y provincia del Cuzco llamada la Nueva Castilla (The True Narrative of the Conquest of Peru and of Cuzco Province, Otherwise Known as New Castile), in 1534. He is also responsible for Relaci√≥n S√°mano-Xerez (the Samano-Xerez Narrative) of 1528, which details Pizarro's first expeditions of 1525 and 1527. His historical accounts are reiterated by Pedro Sancho de la Hoz, in his La Conquista de Peru (The Conquest of Peru), also of 1534. Another official Spanish chronicler was Fray Gaspar de Carvajal, who produced the Relacion del descubrimiento del famoso r√≠o grande de las Amazonas (The Narrative of the Discovery of the Famous Great River of the Amazons) of 1541‚Äì1542, which described the first expedition and cartography of the Peruvian amazon territory, and of its towns and indigenous inhabitants. Other Spanish chroniclers worth mentioning are: # Miguel de Estete - Noticia del Per√∫ (News from Peru), 1535 # Cristobal de Molina ‚Äî a Chilean who was the first to write of the Indigenous inhabitants of the region in hisRelaci√≥n de muchas cosas acaesidas en el Per√∫, en suma para atender a la letra la manera que se tuvo la conquista y poblazon destos reinos... (Narrative of Many Events Taken Place in Peru, Aiming to Correctly Record its Conquest and Inhabitants), 1552 # Pedro Cieza de Le√≥n -Cr√≥nica del Per√∫ (Chronicle of Peru), published in 4 volumes: Parte primera de la Chr√≥nica del Per√∫ (First Volume of the Chronicle of Peru), 1550;El se√±or√≠o de los Incas (The Lordship of the Incas), first published in 1873 but composed between 1548 and 1550; Descubrimiento y Conquista del Per√∫ (The Discovery and Conquest of Peru), 1946; and the fourth volume, divided into five books: La guerra de las salinas (The Battle of the Salt Mines), La guerra de Chupas (The Battle of Chupas), La guerra de Quito (The Battle of Quito), La guerra de la Huarina (The Battle of Huarina) and La guerra de Jaquijaguana (The Battle of Jaquijaguan), published in 1877, 1881 and 1877 respectively.  Indigenous Chroniclers  First page of the Primer nueva cor√≥nica y buen gobierno of Guam√°n Poma de Ayala. There were a number of indigenous and mestizo chroniclers in Peru. Many of the indigenous chroniclers, such as Titu Cusi Yupanqui, were of royal Incan bloodlines. After familiarizing himself with Spanish culture, Yupanqui wrote Relaci√≥n de c√≥mo los espa√±oles entraron en Pir√∫ y el subceso que tuvo Mango Inca en el tiempo en que entre ellos vivi√≥ (The Narrative of How the Spaniards Entered Piru and Mango Inca's Experiences while Living Among Them) in 1570. In it, he presents a vision of his own history, and presents Incan creation myths, traditions and customs, historical memories and impressions regarding the conquest and colonial dominance. Other similar works are Juan de Santa Cruz Pachacuti Yamqui Salcamaygua's Relaci√≥n de antiguedades deste reyno del Piru (Narrative of the Antiquity of this Kingdom of Piru) 1613, and Felipe Guam√°n Poma de Ayala's El primer nvueva cor√≥nica y bven govierno (First New Chronicle and Good Government) written between 1585 and 1615, but first published in 1936, in which the author details the devastation of the Andean world and tries to make sense of the chaotic reality in which the indigenous peoples find themselves. Juan de Santa Cruz Pachacuti also writes a chronicle in which he crudely attempts to explain the Inca cosmogony in rudimentary Spanish. Guam√°n Poma, wrote an extensive 1179-page letter to the king of Spain, Philip III, in which he narrates the history of his universe and ends with a proposal for a utopic society. He embarks on a harsh criticism of the authorities, of the abusive priesthood, of the Spanish envoys and landed gentry, and of \\"mestizo\\" and creole society. In the words of Luis Alberto S√°nchez, this long and futile letter constitutes an indictment of the colonial system. Modern Literature = Neoclassical Peruvian Literature = Adolfo Vienrich writer of Tarmap Pacha Huaray. The hegemony of Creole oligarchy in Peruvian society favored the abandonment of indigenous forms in favor of European ones. Particularly successful among these were the imitation of Petrarch and the use of Greek and Roman mythological allusions, as practiced by the Academia Ant√°rtica literary group in Lima in the 16th and 17th Centuries. Early writers associated with the Academia include Francisco de Figueroa, Diego Mex√≠a de Fernangil, and the anonymous poets remembered only as \\"Clarinda\\" and \\"Amarilis\\". Later Neoclassicists, such as Manuel Asencio y Segura and Felipe Pardo y Aliaga, arose, too, and the genre dominated until the end of the 19th century. = 19th-Century Literary Currents = The 19th-Century brought Romanticism to Peru, with the works of Carlos Augusto Salaverry and Jos√© Arnaldo M√°rquez. Narrative prose developed away from the pastoral works of Manuel Ascensio Segura and Ricardo Palma) (see Costumbrismo) toward Modernism, with the works of Manuel Gonz√°lez Prada and Jos√© Santos Chocano. There were also literary women who wrote in the romantic and modernista style but who also cultivated works that gravited toward [realism] and [naturalism]. These included Juana Manuela Gorriti, Teresa Gonz√°lez de Fanning, Clorinda Matto de Turner, and Mercedes Cabellero de Carbonera. = Modernism in Peruvian Literature = Cesar Vallejo, modernist in Los Heraldos Negros and vanguardist in Trilce The general crisis following the War of the Pacific gave rise to Modernism in Peru. Its best-known exponents were Jos√© Santos Chocano and Jos√© Mar√≠a Eguren. Also notable but who has not received the critical attention she desrves is Aurora C√°ceres, the author of two novels and a dozen works of non-fiction prose. The Avant-garde movement was encouraged by the magazines Col√≥nida and Amauta. Amauta was founded in 1926 by the prominent socialist essyainst Jos√© Carlos Mari√°tegui. The influential poet C√©sar Vallejo was one of its collaborators. There were various splinter groups among the Avant-Gardist poets, whose major exponents were Xavier Abril, Alberto Hidalgo, Sebasti√°n Salazar Bondy and Carlos Germ√°n Belli. Interest in indigenous poetry was resurrected by the work of Luis Fabio Xammar. Others who brought Indigenism to the fore were Ciro Alegr√≠a, Jos√© Mar√≠a Arguedas, and Manuel Scorza. During the 1950s urban realism developed with the works of Julio Ram√≥n Ribeyro and the playwright Sebasti√°n Salazar Bondy. Realism is also the province of the major luminary Mario Vargas Llosa, while Alfredo Bryce Echenique incorporated new narrative techniques within the genre. Some of the most notable names in poetry are Emilio Adolfo Westphalen, Jorge Eduardo Eielson, Carlos Germ√°n Belli, Antonio Cisneros, W√°shington Delgado, Marco Martos, Carmen Oll√©. Noteworthy in narrative prose are: Miguel Guti√©rrez, Gregorio Mart√≠nez, Alonso Cueto and Guillermo Ni√±o de Guzm√°n, among others. = Contemporary Peruvian Literature = Jaime Bayly is a noteworthy contemporary Peruvian writer. His work No se lo digas a nadie (Tell No One) has been adapted for the screen. In the list of young writers we can highlight the work of Fernando Iwasaki, Iv√°n Thays, Oscar Malca, Peter Elmore, Enrique Planas, C√©sar Silva Santisteban, Carlos D√°valos, Diego Trelles-Paz, Carlos Yushimito, Santiago Roncagliolo and Daniel Alarc√≥n (finalist of PEN/Hemingway 2006 award). Also, it is relevant the work of new Peruvian authors as Jose Pancorvo, Jorge Eslava, Rossella di Paolo, Domingo de Ramos, Rocio Silva Santisteban, Odi Gonz√°lez, Ana Varela, Rodrigo Quijano, Jorge Frisancho, Mariela Dreyfus, Gonzalo Portals, Gunter Silva Passuni, Pedro F√©lix Novoa, F√©lix Terrones, Lorenzo Helguero, Jos√© Carlos Yrigoyen, Montserrat √Ålvarez, Ericka Ghersi, Roxana Cris√≥logo, Rafael Espinosa, Miguel Ildefonso, Ana Mar√≠a Garc√≠a, Alberto Valdivia Baselli, Grecia C√°ceres, Xavier Echarri, among others. Literature for children Two seminal writers in the creation of children's literature in Peru are Francisco Izquierdo R√≠os, the founder of Peruvian children's stories and Carlota Carvallo de N√∫√±ez. They both belong to the a post-Second World war generation and devoted themselves entirely to literature for children. Earlier authors had certainly occasionally written children's fables, stories and poetry, but only sporadically and as an annex to their main literary work. In children's poetry, without a doubt, Mario Flori√°n was the most important poet creating an entire and beautiful tradition dedicated to the Peruvian children. Among the many authors who write for Peruvian children are: Oscar Colchado Lucio, with his classic series of Andean adventures Cholito; Marcos Yauri Montero, with his Adventures of the Fox (), and Carlota Flores de Naveda, with Muki, the Little Bull (). It is also necessary to note the Peruvian researchers into literature for children including: the historian Mar√≠a Rostworowski with\\" Peruvian Legends for children\\" a work which rescues the Incan children's literature; professor Jos√© Respaldiza Rojas extensive work Jitanj√°foras, the only book which on this topic; the journalists and researcher brothers Juan y Victor Ataucuri Garc√≠a, with Peruvian Fables, where they analyse more than fifty fables; the professor and songwriter Edgard Bendez√∫ \\"Fabulinka\\", with his vast series Fabulinka, poems composed with an ingineous flavour; the researcher and poet Danilo S√°nchez Lih√≥n, the premier critic in the children's literature in Peruvian; professor and critic Jesus Cabel; the poet Rosa Cerna; the former president of the APLIJ (Peruvian Association of Children and Juvenile Literature) Eduardo de la Cruz Yataco; the teacher and poet Ruth Barrios, Roberto Rosario and others.

Cognitive imitation, is contrasted with motor and vocal or oral imitation. As with all forms of imitation, cognitive imitation involves learning and copying specific rules or responses done by another. The principal difference between motor and cognitive imitation is the type of rule (and stimulus) that is learned and copied by the observer. So, whereas in the typical imitation learning experiment subjects must copy novel actions on objects or novel sequences of specific actions (novel motor imitation), in a novel cognitive imitation paradigm subjects have to copy novel rules, independently of specific actions or movement patterns. The following example illustrates the difference between cognitive and motor-spatial imitation: Imagine someone overlooking someone's shoulder and stealing their automated teller machine (ATM) password. As with all forms of imitation, the individual learns and successfully reproduces the observed sequence. The observer in our example, like most of us, presumably knows how to operate an ATM (namely, that you have to push X number of buttons on the ATM screen in a specific sequence), so the specific motor responses of touching the screen isn't what the thief is learning. Instead, the thief could learn two types of abstract rules. On the one hand, the thief can learn a spatial rule: touch item in the top right, followed by item on the top left, then the item in the middle of the screen, and finally the one on lower right. This would be an example of motor-spatial imitation because the thief's response is guided by an abstract motor-spatial rule. On the other, the thief could ignore the spatial patterning of the observed responses and instead focus on the particular items that were touched, generating an abstract numerical rule, independently of where they are in space: 3-1-5-9. This would constitute an example of cognitive imitation because the individuals is copying an abstract serial rule without copying specific motor-responses. In this example, the thief's responses match those he observed only because the numbers are in the same location. If the numbers were in a different location‚Äîthat is, if the numbers on the ATM's keypad were scrambled with every attempt to enter a password‚Äîthe thief would, nonetheless, reproduce the target password because they learned a cognitive (i.e., an abstract, item-specific serial rule), rather than a spatial rule (i.e., an observable motor-spatial pattern).  In rhesus monkeys  The term \\"cognitive imitation\\" was first introduced by Subiaul and his colleagues (Subiaul, Cantlon, et al., 2004), defining it as \\"a type of observational learning in which a na√Øve student copies an expert's use of a rule\\". To isolate cognitive from motor imitation, Subiaul and colleagues trained two rhesus macaques to respond, in a prescribed order, to different sets of photographs that were displayed simultaneously on a touch-sensitive monitor. Because the position of the photographs varied randomly from trial to trial, sequences could not be learned by motor imitation. Both monkeys learned new sequences more rapidly after observing an expert execute those sequences than when they had to learn new sequences entirely by trial and error. A mircro-analysis of each monkeys' performance showed that each monkey learned the order of two of the four photographs faster than baseline levels. A second experiment ruled out social facilitation as an explanation for this result. A third experiment, however, demonstrated that monkeys did not learn when the computer highlighted each picture in the correct sequence in the absence of a monkey (\\"ghost control\\").  Dissociating cognitive and motor-spatial imitation Subiaul and colleagues, using two computerized tasks that measure the learning of two abstract rules: cognitive‚Äîitem-based‚Äîrules (e.g., apple-boy-cat;video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzwOMF8W5Wc) and motor-spatial-based rules (e.g., up-down-rightvideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8pjTME_ugY) have shown that there are important dissociations between the imitation of these two types of rules. Specifically, results have shown that while 3-year-olds successfully imitate item-specific rules (i.e., cognitive imitation), these same 3-year-olds fail to imitate motor-spatial rules (i.e., motor-spatial imitation).Subiaul, Anderson et al. 2012, Subiaul, Patterson et al. 2014 This dissociation isn't because there's something inherently harder about learning spatial versus cognitive rules. Follow-up studies have shown that 3-year olds easily learn new spatial rules by trial and error, correctly recalling such rules after a 30s delay,Subiaul, Anderson et al. 2012 (Exp. 2). This result excludes the possibility that 3-year olds' motor-spatial imitation problems are due to difficulty learning (i.e., encoding and recalling) novel spatial rules in general. In another study, 3-year olds observed a model correctly touch the first item (e.g., Top Right) in the sequence, but then skip the middle item (e.g., Top Left picture) and, instead, touch the last item in the sequence (e.g., Bottom Left picture), resulting in an error, marked as unintentional by the model who said, \\"Whoops! That's not right!\\". This is a goal emulation learning condition, as the child had to copy the model's intended goal (Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Top-Left), rather than the observed (incorrect) response (Top-Right, Top-Left), similar to Meltzoff's \\"re- enactment\\" paradigm.Meltzoff 1995, Bellagamba, Camaioni et al. 2006 When given an opportunity to respond, 3-year olds generated the intended (i.e., correct) sequence (Exp. 3.) 3-year old's success in the goal emulation condition excludes the possibility that 3-year olds' motor-spatial imitation problem is due to difficulty vicariously learning (i.e., because of a lack of interest, failure to attend, problems inferring goals, etc.) a novel spatial rule from a model. Children's success in the goal emulation condition shows that social learning may be achieved by social reasoning (inferring goals) and causal inferences (error detection), independently of any domain-specific imitation learning mechanism.Subiaul, Patterson et al. 2015 To further explore this dissociation between cognitive- and motor-spatial imitation Subiaul and colleagues conducted a large-scale cross-sectional, within-subject study with preschoolers (2‚Äì6 years) using the same two tasks: cognitive (item-specific) and motor-spatial (spatial-specific). Results showed that children's cognitive imitation performance did not predict their motor-spatial imitation learning, and vice versa. Importantly, while age predicted improved cognitive and motor- spatial imitation performance, children's ability to individually learn each type of rule via trial and error did not predict their ability to imitate those same rules. Subiaul and colleagues have argued that these results are consistent with the hypothesis that imitation learning is domain-specific, not domain-general. A critical caveat may be that the imitation of NOVEL rules and responses is domain-specific while the imitation of FAMILIAR responses is likely to be mediated by domain-general, non-specialized mechanisms, as Heyes and others have argued.

The precise definition is found below. Empirical measures are relevant to mathematical statistics. The motivation for studying empirical measures is that it is often impossible to know the true underlying probability measure P. We collect observations X_1, X_2, \\\\dots , X_n and compute relative frequencies. We can estimate P, or a related distribution function F by means of the empirical measure or empirical distribution function, respectively. These are uniformly good estimates under certain conditions. Theorems in the area of empirical processes provide rates of this convergence. Definition Let X_1, X_2, \\\\dots be a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables with values in the state space S with probability distribution P. Definition :The empirical measure Pn is defined for measurable subsets of S and given by ::P_n(A) = {1 \\\\over n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n I_A(X_i)=\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\delta_{X_i}(A) ::where I_A is the indicator function and \\\\delta_X is the Dirac measure. Properties *For a fixed measurable set A, nPn(A) is a binomial random variable with mean nP(A) and variance nP(A)(1 ‚àí P(A)). **In particular, Pn(A) is an unbiased estimator of P(A). *For a fixed partition A_i of S, random variables X_i=nP_n(A_i) form a multinomial distribution with event probabilities P(A_i) **The covariance matrix of this multinomial distribution is Cov(X_i,X_j)=nP(A_i)(\\\\delta_{ij}-P(A_j)). Definition :\\\\bigl(P_n(c)\\\\bigr)_{c\\\\in\\\\mathcal{C}} is the empirical measure indexed by \\\\mathcal{C}, a collection of measurable subsets of S. To generalize this notion further, observe that the empirical measure P_n maps measurable functions f:S\\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} to their empirical mean, :f\\\\mapsto P_n f=\\\\int_S f \\\\, dP_n=\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n f(X_i) In particular, the empirical measure of A is simply the empirical mean of the indicator function, Pn(A) = Pn IA. For a fixed measurable function f, P_nf is a random variable with mean \\\\mathbb{E}f and variance \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\mathbb{E}(f -\\\\mathbb{E} f)^2. By the strong law of large numbers, Pn(A) converges to P(A) almost surely for fixed A. Similarly P_nf converges to \\\\mathbb{E} f almost surely for a fixed measurable function f. The problem of uniform convergence of Pn to P was open until Vapnik and Chervonenkis solved it in 1968. If the class \\\\mathcal{C} (or \\\\mathcal{F}) is Glivenko‚ÄìCantelli with respect to P then Pn converges to P uniformly over c\\\\in\\\\mathcal{C} (or f\\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}). In other words, with probability 1 we have :\\\\P_n-P\\\\_\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\sup_{c\\\\in\\\\mathcal{C}}P_n(c)-P(c)\\\\to 0, :\\\\P_n-P\\\\_\\\\mathcal{F}=\\\\sup_{f\\\\in\\\\mathcal{F}}P_nf-\\\\mathbb{E}f\\\\to 0. Empirical distribution function The empirical distribution function provides an example of empirical measures. For real-valued iid random variables X_1,\\\\dots,X_n it is given by :F_n(x)=P_n((-\\\\infty,x])=P_nI_{(-\\\\infty,x]}. In this case, empirical measures are indexed by a class \\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\\\\\{(-\\\\infty,x]:x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\\\\\}. It has been shown that \\\\mathcal{C} is a uniform Glivenko‚ÄìCantelli class, in particular, :\\\\sup_F\\\\F_n(x)-F(x)\\\\_\\\\infty\\\\to 0 with probability 1.

Rubens Barrichello's #2 status at Ferrari was made obvious after he moved over to let Michael Schumacher win just a few metres before the finish line. In motor racing, team orders is the practice of teams issuing instructions to drivers to deviate from the normal practice of racing against each other as they would against other teams' drivers. This can be accomplished either in advance, simply by establishing a pecking order between the drivers within the team, or instructing a driver to let their teammate overtake or to hold position without the risk of collision. This is generally done when one driver is behind in a particular race but ahead overall in a championship season. The team will then order their drivers to rearrange themselves on the track so as to give more championship points to a driver who is ahead in the championship. Another reason for team orders is where multiple drivers are in a position far ahead of the field, being all but assured of the win. Team orders are issued to prevent the drivers from racing each other; the aim is to have them drive cautiously to save fuel, reduce the chance of mechanical problems, and avoid a collision. This has happened on countless occasions in the history of motorsport, sometimes causing great acrimony between the team and the disadvantaged driver. Team orders in Formula One =Early examples= Such orders were legal and accepted historically in motor racing. In the early years of the Formula One World Championship, it was even legal for a driver to give up his car during the race to the team leader if the latter's car had broken down. In 1955, the Mercedes team asked Juan Manuel Fangio to let his teammate Stirling Moss win his home Grand Prix at Aintree. Fangio obliged, refusing to attack Moss in the closing stages of the race, and came home in second place, less than a second behind Moss. The 1964 season saw a dramatic finale in which Lorenzo Bandini moved over to John Surtees during the Mexican Grand Prix, allowing Surtees to get the necessary points to beat Graham Hill to the World Championship. In the 1979 German Grand Prix Clay Regazzoni was instructed by the Williams pits not to attack his teammate Alan Jones for the lead, despite Regazzoni being ahead in the championship.Christian Bounay and Clay Regazzoni, Le Combat, Solar, 1982 The status of Jones as number one driver at Williams lasted until 1981, when Carlos Reutemann deliberately ignored team orders at the 1981 Brazilian Grand Prix and did not allow him to pass. This resulted in a long feud between the two that eventually led to Jones' retirement at the end of the season, with Reutemann missing out on the World Championship for one single point. At the 1982 French Grand Prix, Ren√© Arnoux enraged Renault by refusing to give way to his teammate Alain Prost, who at the time was ahead in the championship. However, those three points had no impact, as Prost finished fourth in the championship that year, ten points behind eventual champion Keke Rosberg. During the 1983 South African Grand Prix, the Brabham-BMW team asked driver Riccardo Patrese to cede Nelson Piquet the race win if it ensured Piquet would win the driver's championship. However, this did not prove to be necessary as Patrese won the race while Piquet came third, enough to secure him the championship.ESPN coverage of the South African Grand Prix. Patrese was asked \\"If there was a situation where you had to give up the victory for Nelson to win the championship, what would you have done?\\", Patrese's response was \\"Yes, that was already planned. ... Nelson started with less fuel and my role was to slow the field to give him a big lead.\\" Available on YouTube. =Negative media reception= At the 1991 Japanese Grand Prix, Ayrton Senna, who had already secured the championship title that year, conceded the race win to Gerhard Berger, saying after the race that he had done so because \\"he had been very helpful\\". Riccardo Patrese found himself in a similar situation to what he did in 1983 again in 1992, when he blatantly waved his Williams teammate Nigel Mansell through during the 1992 French Grand Prix, which Mansell went on to win ahead of Patrese in second. In the late 1990s, incidents of team orders began to be reported more prominently by the media, and public reaction to the more blatant examples became extremely negative. At the 1997 European Grand Prix, Jacques Villeneuve, already with the title in the bag (after the controversial collision with Schumacher, which Villeneuve's Williams survived), was asked by his engineer via radio to let the McLaren cars pass as \\"They've been very helpful\\",Timothy Collings, The Piranha Club: Power and Influence in Formula One, Virgin Books, 2004 while at the 1998 Australian Grand Prix, the McLaren drivers David Coulthard and Mika H√§kkinen caused a stir by switching position at the end of the race in order to respect a previous agreement. In contrast to prior examples, the 1997 Japanese Grand Prix saw a more sophisticated use of team orders, where Ferrari driver Eddie Irvine began the race light on fuel, allowing him to get ahead of the superior Williams-Renault cars and hold them up, to the benefit of teammate Michael Schumacher. At the 1998 Belgian Grand Prix, the two Jordans of Damon Hill and Ralf Schumacher found themselves unexpectedly in the lead after a collision between Michael Schumacher and David Coulthard. Ralf was subsequently ordered not to overtake Hill, to assure Jordan of a 1-2 finish. At the 1999 German Grand Prix, Mika Salo, driving for Ferrari in place of the injured Michael Schumacher, was leading the race when he was told to allow teammate Eddie Irvine to pass. Salo complied, giving up what would have been his only Formula One victory in 109 career races. Irvine ultimately failed to win the championship that year, losing out to Mika H√§kkinen. At the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix, Rubens Barrichello was ordered to allow Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher to pass to obtain the win. This received huge amounts of negative attention from the media, as the order was issued shortly before both drivers crossed the finish line. Both drivers were unhappy about the situation. Schumacher refused to take the top step of the podium and the centre seat, normally reserved to the winner, during the post-race press conference, and the team was punished for breach of podium procedure. At the United States Grand Prix the same year, Schumacher appeared to have returned the favour by giving Barrichello the win by the record smallest margin of 0.011 seconds on the finishing line, though it is assumed Schumacher was trying to trigger a dead-heat finish. =Team orders ban= After the 2002 season, FIA announced that \\"Team Orders that could influence the outcome of a race\\" were banned, although they were sometimes still implemented discreetly. For example, this has sometimes been achieved as easily as a team getting on the radio to the slower driver and pointing out that his teammate is quicker. The slower driver then lets the quicker driver through without the need for an overt \\"directive\\" from the team. This happened, for example, at the 2010 Turkish Grand Prix, where Mark Webber was asked to slow down when his Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel was closing in. Webber disregarded the order, and the pair collided, each refusing to accept blame for the accident. Similarly, at the 2010 German Grand Prix, Felipe Massa's race engineer Rob Smedley was heard to say to his driver \\"Fernando (Alonso) is faster than you. Can you confirm you understand that message?\\". Moments later, Massa eased back and allowed Alonso past. Crashgate Perhaps the most controversial use of team orders, occurring during the period where team orders were explicitly banned, was the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, where the Renault F1 team used team orders to cause Nelson Piquet, Jr to crash deliberately on the fourteenth lap of the race in order to bring out the safety car, allowing his team-mate Alonso to win the race. Subsequent investigation the following year resulted in Renault receiving a two-year suspended disqualification (expired in 2011) and Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds, two major figures involved with the team, being banned from the sport, although this was later appealed and reversed under a settlement that forbade them from working in any FIA-sanctioned events for a time. =Ban repealed= At the end of the 2010 season, the FIA conceded that the team orders rule was not working and needed to be reviewed. As of 2011, the team orders rule no longer appeared in the sporting regulations. At the 2012 United States Grand Prix, Ferrari broke the FIA seal on the gearbox of Felipe Massa's car in order to trigger a 5-place grid penalty. This moved him behind Fernando Alonso and shifted both cars onto the \\"clean\\" side of the race track, to ensure Alonso the fastest start possible on the slippery asphalt of the brand-new Circuit of the Americas. At the 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix, Red Bull Racing driver Sebastian Vettel was criticised for passing his team-mate Mark Webber to win the race against \\"Multi 21\\", an order from his team to hold position. At the 2017 Hungarian Grand Prix, the Mercedes team ordered Valtteri Bottas to yield his third position for Lewis Hamilton, who had a better chance to attack second-placed Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen. When it was clear that Hamilton was not able to overcome R√§ikk√∂nen, Hamilton gave back the position to Bottas in the last corner of the race, costing him three points in the Drivers' Championship. Those three points did not matter in the end, as Hamilton won the title by 46 points. At the 2018 German Grand Prix, after Vettel (now at Ferrari) crashed and brought out the safety car, Hamilton inherited the lead, with team-mate Bottas behind him on fresher tyres. When the safety car period ended, Bottas initially attacked Hamilton for the lead, before being told by Mercedes' team strategist James Vowles to hold his position, handing Hamilton the win. Bottas continued to play second fiddle to Hamilton at the 2018 Russian Grand Prix, where he qualified on pole and subsequently led the race until being ordered to yield the lead to his teammate, who was ahead in the Drivers' Championship. At the 2019 Australian Grand Prix, Ferrari ordered Charles Leclerc to hold position after he attempted to overtake team-mate Vettel. Two races later, at the Chinese Grand Prix, Leclerc was ordered by Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto to let Vettel pass him. Binotto later said the team made the ‚Äúright choice‚Äù by making the call, as Vettel finished on the podium in third whilst Leclerc finished fifth.  Team orders in NASCAR  = 2013 Federated Auto Parts 400 = Team orders became a serious issue during the 2013 Federated Auto Parts 400 on 7 September 2013, when an elaborate scheme involving the last race of the regular season before the Chase for the Sprint Cup erupted, causing officials to make serious rule changes. With five teams involved in the race for the final two regular and both wild card slots -- Richard Childress Racing satellite Furniture Row Racing, Hendrick Motorsports and its respective satellite Stewart-Haas Racing, Michael Waltrip Racing, and Penske Racing‚Äîfor the ten-race playoff, an elaborate scheme erupted in the waning stages of the race. Ryan Newman (Stewart-Haas) was leading the race with less than ten laps remaining, and the standings had Kurt Busch (Furniture Row) in ninth, Jeff Gordon (Hendrick) in tenth by two points, with the two wild cards being Kasey Kahne (Hendrick) and Newman, both of which would have two race wins. This would shut out Joey Logano (Penske), who was in the top ten prior to the race but struggling and now trailing Gordon by two points, and Martin Truex, Jr. (Michael Waltrip), who also has one win. Logano, down two laps, talked with fellow Ford team Front Row Motorsports driver David Gilliland about allowing Logano to pass him to gain points, as he was two points behind Gordon for tenth place in the points. With Newman leading, Logano had to be in tenth or Logano would be out of a Chase position. Truex's teammate Clint Bowyer intentionally spun and caused a caution in an effort to assist his teammate. Ensuing pit stops knocked Newman to third. Logano, who was two laps behind, did not pit and was able to advance ahead one lap as the leader must be the first car on the restart. In order to allow the team orders for Michael Waltrip Racing to succeed, the elaborate scheme, which was independent of each other, took place. Bowyer pitted after the restart to go down laps in order to allow Logano to have one point, and teammate Brian Vickers did the same thing, and go very slow in the final lap, possibly below NASCAR's minimum speed requirement. This would allow Logano to pass Gordon, who without a win loses a tiebreaker to Logano. Logano then passes Gilliland. Truex races hard and ties Newman, tying Newman on the first count (most wins, one), and the second count (points), winning the third count (most second-place finishes). Immediately after the race, the ESPN television broadcast aired Bowyer's radio transmission in the laps leading to the safety car situation, before signing off the broadcast. This led to an immediate investigation where NASCAR uncovered via team radios the complex team orders scheme, suspending Michael Waltrip Racing officials, stripping Truex of his playoff position, a $100,000 fine per car on the team, and a 50-point penalty each on all three teams (driver and owner except the #55 of Vickers, a Nationwide Series driver ineligible for Sprint Cup points, which was penalised as owner only). Probations were assessed on Front Row and Penske teams after NASCAR uncovered the radio chatter for that team orders scheme. Gordon and Newman were each reinstated to the twelve-car playoff, which increased to thirteen after Gordon was added. A complex series of rules were announced on 14 September 2013 by NASCAR to prevent such team orders from taking place. Among the rules to prevent team orders include different teams on the spotter's stand brokering deals in exchange for the concession of a position, private team communication that cannot be detected by officials on digital radios (teams must use analog channels that can be accessed by spectators at the circuit, audio and visual media broadcasts, and officials - in previous years some teams had scrambled signals), and a limit of one spotter per spotter's stand at the circuit. At circuits where there are multiple spotters' stands used (mainly the road courses and Talladega Superspeedway), the rule will only limit one spotter to being in each post (there are often multiple posts at road courses and Talladega because it is impossible for the entire track to be seen by one spotter). NASCAR will also mandate a video camera on the stand, which will observe radio chatter among spotters (networks may also install a camera on the spotter's stand for broadcast positioning). NASCAR also added Section 12, Rule 4, Article L in the NASCAR rule book, with the rule indirectly referencing a ban on team orders. =2019 Ford EcoBoost 400= Team orders would also play a role in another controversy at the season-ending 2019 Ford EcoBoost 400 on 17 November 2019 amongst smaller teams without active Race Team Alliance charters, Premium Motorsports and Rick Ware Racing; the scheme also involved a small chartered team in Spire Motorsports. The incident occurred as Premium Motorsports' No. 27 car (driven by Ross Chastain for the race) raced for the top-placed non-chartered team against Gaunt Brothers Racing's No. 96 (driven by Drew Herring); the top-placed non-chartered team (referred as Open teams by NASCAR) in the owner's points standings would earn higher bonuses. NASCAR's investigation, which involved access to team radio channels, was published on 27 November 2019, which revealed that the Nos. 27, 52 (Rick Ware Racing, driven by Josh Bilicki), 77 (Spire Motorsports, driven by Reed Sorenson) and 15 (Premium Motorsports, driven by Joe Nemechek) were found to have manipulated the outcome of the race, by means of inter-team exchanges asking the latter three cars to park (retire) out of the race within a 15-lap span for the benefit of No. 27 in the point standings. NASCAR subsequently fined crew members Scott Egglestone (Premium Motorsports) and Kenneth Evans (Rick Ware Racing) $25,000 each and suspended both indefinitely. All three team owners were fined $50,000, and all four cars were assessed a fifty-point penalty. Spire Motorsports did not appeal their penalties, while Premium and RWR remained quiet on the incident. Sorenson, who initially repeatedly refused to pit in according to radio communications, was the only driver to have points deducted from driver's point standings, as none of the other drivers were eligible to score points in the Cup series whilst mainly participating in lower NASCAR touring series; thus, the penalties primarily affected owner's point standings.

It provides information about the use of deposit accounts by consumers.  History  In 1991, the agency was owned by Deluxe Corporation, and it was part of the spin-off from Deluxe that formed eFunds in 1999. Fidelity National Information Services acquired eFunds in 2007.Reuters.com \\"Fidelity National to buy eFunds for $1.8 billion\\" The number of \\"bank and thrift branches\\" served in 1991 was 59,000.  Services  Eighty percent of commercial banks and credit unions in the United States use ChexSystems to screen applicants for checking and savings accounts.BankRate.com Checking Basics tutorial eFunds claims that their services are used in over 9,000 banks, including over 100,000 individual bank branches in the United States. As of 1991, ChexSystems held 7.3 million names of consumers whose bank accounts had been closed \\"for cause\\". Services include verification of identity, reports on account history, and transaction monitoring.eFunds Service Offerings  Reporting  A ChexSystems report examines data submitted by banks in the past five years. A report may describe banking irregularities such as check overdrafts, unsettled balances, depositing fraudulent checks, or suspicious account handling. Banks may refuse to open a new deposit account for a consumer that has a negative item reported. In 1999, ChexSystems was classified as a consumer reporting agency governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Therefore, consumers may retrieve a ChexSystems report annually, free of cost. They may dispute negative items and demand proof of the data contained in the report.Banks.org \\"Banks That Don‚Äôt Use ChexSystems\\"  Criticism  Credit bureaus report both negative and positive information about a consumer's use of credit; a ChexSystems report specifies only negative information, if any, about a consumer's use of deposit accounts. Thus, if two customers have both made the same banking errors in the past, while one of them has maintained a number of positive banking relationships as well, both customers might be declined when applying for a new account. A 1991 survey conducted by Consumer Action showed that ‚Öî of California's largest financial institutions banned customers from opening accounts if they were listed with ChexSystems. The Greenlining Institute has published a report indicating wide disparities in the criteria banks have used when deciding whether to report negative items to ChexSystems. = Response from banks = Beginning in August 2000, the Greenlining Institute, a public policy center headquartered in San Francisco, and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco held four meetings to discuss possible reform in the treatment of individuals reported to ChexSystems. These meetings included a discussion of potential best practices which a financial institution could implement to reduce its dependence on ChexSystems data in its decision process on opening accounts. Practices identified include: * Training staff to use judgment to assess risk when opening accounts * Setting minimum limits to activate the use of ChexSystems * Considering the possible override of a customer denial for situations that are beyond the customer‚Äôs control, such as a prolonged illness Since the meetings at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, all participating financial institutions have announced that they will implement positive changes in the way they use ChexSystems. In September 2000, Bank of America was the first financial institution to announce specific changes in its use of ChexSystems. Revised practices include: * Disregarding all entries greater than three years old provided the entry is not fraud-related * Disregarding all entries greater than one year old if the consumer has repaid the debt * Disregarding certain other entries if the consumer has repaid the debt and completes a course in financial responsibility * Increasing the loss threshold for reporting closed accounts from $50 to $100 in overdrafts * Increasing the length of time a customer has to repay the debt During a December 2000 meeting, Bank of America reported that in the first two months under the revised standards, its new ChexSystems policies had resulted in approximately 1,800 \\"overrides\\". This allowed 1,800 individuals to open deposit accounts that would have been denied under the bank's former policies. Best practices to address the barriers ChexSystems reports may create for low-and moderate-income individuals include: * Increasing the negative balance threshold for reporting customers from $25 to $100 * Increasing the length of time customers have to repay a negative balance from 30 days to 90 days * Improving the overdraft notification process to include more visible language that explains how the institution uses ChexSystems and the consequences of being reported * Refraining from reporting customers until numerous attempts have been made to contact them and providing ample opportunity to settle their accounts before a report is submitted to ChexSystemsChicago Office of Education Some banks that use ChexSystems also utilize the services of Early Warning Services, LLC, a fraud prevention and consumer reporting agency owned by Bank of America, BB&T;, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.Early Warning Services, LLC  References  Category:FIS (company) Category:Retail financial services Category:Financial services companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Delaware Category:Non-sufficient funds ","title":"ChexSystems"},{"id":"5647783","text":"Eve () is a South Korean glam rock band. The band is still active, despite all members of the band having changed with the exception of vocalist Seheon. History =Formation= Eve was founded by Kim Seheon on 24 December 1997, taking its name from Christmas Eve. With Seheon as main vocalist and G.Gorilla as the band's backing vocalist and composer, they released their first album, Eve, in August 1998, including their debut single, \\"Whenever You Feel\\". In May 1999 they released a second album, Eros, using guitarist Park Woong and bassist Kim Gun as session musicians, who joined the band officially a year later. In April 2000 the band released a third album, Fly To You. The band reached the peak of their popularity in April 2001 with their fourth album, Swear, which featured romantic ballads as well as the more typical rock songs. =Eve as Seheon solo= After the release of the fourth album, all members except Seheon left the band due to musical differences, despite which Seheon released a fifth album, Ever in November 2002 under Eve's name. The album was without Eve's harder elements, including softer tracks such as \\"Leaning On Time\\". By April 2003, two separate greatest hits collections were released. =Reformation= In October 2003, the band reformed as a full lineup, with guitarists Jung Yuhwa and Ha Sebin, Kim Seungjoo on bass and Choi Minchang on keyboard joining Seheon. Their sixth album, Welcome to Planet Eve, had a darker metal sound. The band also released a DVD, The History of Eve, featuring live performances recorded in Seoul in 2004, along with a live album of the same name. =Second reformation= Following a two-year hiatus, Eve again reorganized its members in May 2006, with Seheon and Sebin as the central figures. Their seventh album, Seventh Evening, featured a new version of \\"Whenever You Feel\\". In September 2007, Sebin was replaced by Choi Kiho as Eve's guitarist, and Ikki joined the band as a bassist, and Eve's first female member. The trio released Play Me, the eighth album, with a punk edge. Soon afterwards Seheon again became the only official member of the band, with Seungjoo and Yuhwa from the Planet Eve era occasionally supporting him during live performances. From 2007, Eve released a couple of singles, \\"Guy In Revolution\\" (March 2010) and \\"Gloria\\" (November 2010). =Reunion= After a long hiatus, Eve returned in 2016 with the original four-piece lineup of Seheon, G.Gorilla, Park Woong and Kim Gun, releasing a music video for their first post-reunion song \\"Melody\\" (featuring Heechul) on Christmas Eve. In January 2017, Eve released the album Romantic Show, the eleventh under the name Eve. 11 March 2017 saw Eve make their debut appearance on the KBS program Immortal Songs: Singing the Legend, performing their rendition of ÎèÑÏãúÏùò Í±∞Î¶¨ (City Streets) for the Kim Myung-gon special.

This term usually refers to \`?:\` as in C, C++, C#, Python, and JavaScript. However, in Java, this term can also refer to \`&&\` and \`\`.  && and   In some programming languages, e.g. Java, the term conditional operator refers to short circuit boolean operators \`&&\` and \`\`. The second expression is evaluated only when the first expression is not sufficient to determine the value of the whole expression. = Difference from bitwise operator = \`&\` and \`\` are bitwise operators that occurs in many programming languages. The major difference is that bitwise operations operate on the individual bits of a binary numeral, whereas conditional operators operate on logical operations. Additionally, expressions before and after a bitwise operator will always be evaluated. if (expression1  expression2  expression3) If expression 1 is true, expression 2 and 3 will NOT be checked. if (expression1  expression2  expression3) This will check expression 2 and 3, even if 1 is already true. Short circuit operators can reduce run-time by avoid calling later functions. They can also avoid Null Exception if expression 1 check whether an object is valid. = Usage in Java = class ConditionalDemo1 { public static void main(String[] args) { int value1 = 1; int value2 = 2; if ((value1  1) && (value2  2)) System.out.println(\\"value1 is 1 AND value2 is 2\\"); if ((value1  1)  (value2  1)) System.out.println(\\"value1 is 1 OR value2 is 1\\"); } }  ?  In most programming languages, ?: is called the conditional operator. It is a type of ternary operator, while ternary operator in most situation means specifically to ?: , because it is the only operator that takes three operands. = Regular usage of \\"?:\\" = \`?:\` is used in conditional expressions. Programmers can rewrite an if-then-else expression in a more concise way by using the conditional operator.  Syntax  condition ? expression 1 : expression 2 condition: An expression which is evaluated as a boolean value. expression 1, expression 2: Expressions with values of any type. If the condition is evaluated to true, the expression 1 will be evaluated. If the condition is evaluated to false, the expression 2 will be evaluated. It should be read as: \\"If condition is true, assign the value of expression 1 to result. Otherwise, assign the value of expression 2 to result.\\"  Association property  The conditional operator is right- associative, meaning that operations are grouped from right to left. For example, an expression of the form a ? b : c ? d : e is evaluated as a ? b : (c ? d : e).  Examples by languages  = Java = class ConditionalDemo2 { public static void main(String[] args) { int value1 = 1; int value2 = 2; int result; boolean someCondition = true; result = someCondition ? value1 : value2; System.out.println(result); } } In this example, because someCondition is true, this program prints \\"1\\" to the screen. Use the ?: operator instead of an if-then-else statement if it makes your code more readable; for example, when the expressions are compact and without side- effects (such as assignments). = C++ = #include int main() { int x = 1; int y = 2; std::cout << ( x > y ? x : y ) << \\" is the greater of the two.\\" << std::endl; } There are several rules that apply to the second and third operands in C++: * If both operands are of the same type, the result is of that type * If both operands are of arithmetic or enumeration types, the usual arithmetic conversions (covered in Standard Conversions) are performed to convert them to a common type * If both operands are of pointer types or if one is a pointer type and the other is a constant expression that evaluates to 0, pointer conversions are performed to convert them to a common type * If both operands are of reference types, reference conversions are performed to convert them to a common type * If both operands are of type void, the common type is type void * If both operands are of the same user-defined type, the common type is that type. = C# = // condition ? first_expression : second_expression; static double sinc(double x) { return x != 0.0 ?

The Atlas of North American English. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter. pp. 141, 148. It is composed of Maritime English (or Maritimer English, described in this article) and Newfoundland English. It is mostly influenced by British and Irish English, Irish and Scottish Gaelic, and some Acadian French. Atlantic Canada is the easternmost region of Canada, comprising four provinces located on the Atlantic coast ‚Äì the three Maritime provinces: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, as well as Newfoundland and Labrador. The population of the Atlantic Provinces in 2016 was about 2,300,000 on a land area of approximately half a million square kilometres, with Nova Scotia being the most populous province, and its capital, Halifax, the most populous city. Regions such as Miramichi and Cape Breton have a wide variety of phrases and words not spoken outside of their respected regions.  History  Canadian English owes its very existence to important historical events, especially the Treaty of Paris of 1763. English was first spoken in Canada in the 17th century, in seasonal fishing communities along the Atlantic coast, including the island of Newfoundland, and at fur trade posts around Hudson Bay. Treated as a marker of upper-class prestige in the 19th century and the early part of the 20th, Canadian dainty was marked by the use of some features of British English pronunciation, resulting in an accent similar to the Trans-Atlantic accent known in the United States. Students in school were not permitted to use Gaelic, upon threat of punishment for not using the King's English, and thus Gaelic fell into disuse. This accent faded in prominence following World War II, when it became stigmatized as pretentious, and is now almost never heard in contemporary Canadian life outside of archival recordings used in film, television or radio documentaries. Phonology The Atlas of North American English (2006) revealed many of the sound changes active within Atlantic Canadian English, including the fronting of and mild Canadian raising, but notably a lack of the Canadian Shift of the short front vowels that exists in the rest of English-speaking Canada. Canadian raising means that the diphthongs and are raised to, respectively, and before voiceless consonants like , , , , . In all Atlantic Canadian English, (the \\"short a sound\\") is raised before nasal consonants. This is strongly true in Nova Scotia's Sydney English specifically, which also features a merger of and (e.g. making haggle sound like Hagel). This merger, typical of Standard Canadian English as well, is not typical however of the rest of Atlantic Canadian English. Nova Scotia's Halifax English and New Brunswick's Saint John English show /√¶/ raising before a few consonants, somewhat reminiscent of a New York accent, though nowhere near as defined (thus, bad has a different vowel sound than bat and back), though Charles Boberg suspects this is an older, recessive feature.Boberg, Charles (2011). \\"Regional variation in the allophones of CANADIAN ENGLISH\\". Canadian Acoustics, [S.l.], v. 39, n. 3, p. 170-171, sep. 2011. ISSN 2291-1391. Available at: . Nova Scotia's Lunenburg English may show non-rhotic behaviour, and Nova Scotia English generally has a conservatively back compared with other Canadian English dialects. Certain Atlantic Canadian English dialects have been recognized by both popular and scholarly publications for distinctly sounding like Irish English dialects.Hertz, Kayla (2020). \\"This Canadian woman‚Äôs Irish accent sounds straight out of Ireland\\". IrishCentral. Irish Studio LLC. Due to Irish immigration patterns, a strong influence of Irish English features is documented in Newfoundland English, Cape Breton English, and some Halifax English, including a fronting of ~, a slit fricative realization of , and a rounded realization of . Newfoundland English further shows the cheer‚Äìchair merger, the line‚Äìloin merger, and a distinct lack of the marry‚Äìmerry merger. The flapping of intervocalic and to an alveolar tap between vowels, as well as pronouncing it as a glottal stop , is less common in the Maritimes than elsewhere in Canada, so that \\"battery\\" is pronounced instead of with a glottal stop. The varied, but similar, Maritimer accents are influenced by an overwhelming majority of early Scottish and Irish immigration namely in the regions of Saint John, Miramichi, Cape Breton and parts of Halifax. =Maritimes= In addition to the above, the English of the Maritime Provinces (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island) additionally has some unique phonological features: * Like most Canadian English, Maritimer English usually contains Canadian raising, though to a less extreme degree than the rest of the nation. Also, both variants of can have notably rounded realizations. * A merger of coach and couch is possible, due to the raised variant of being rounded. * The flapping of intervocalic and to alveolar tap between vowels, as well as pronouncing it as a glottal stop , is less common in the Maritimes than in the rest of North America. Therefore, battery is pronounced instead of . * Especially among the older generation, and are not merged; that is, the beginning sound of why, white, and which is different from that of witch, with, wear. * A devoiced and retracted is traditionally common. Lexicon The interrogative \\"right?\\" is raised to and is also used as an adverb, as in \\"It was right foggy today!\\" That sense may be influenced by Welsh word \\"reit\\" , which means \\"very, rather, or considerably.\\" \\"Right\\" is often but less today than before used with that meaning in the American South, too. \\"Some\\" is used as an adverb as well, especially in Nova Scotia, as in \\"This cake is some good!\\" Another example is \\"s'pose\\" or \\"s'poseda\\" for \\"suppose\\" or \\"supposed to.\\" Such expressions tend to be widely used in the rural Maritimes but are less common in urban areas. Terminal hard consonants are often dropped from pronunciation when found in sentences. \\"Ol'\\" rather than \\"old\\", \\"col'\\" rather than \\"cold\\", \\"tha'\\" rather than \\"that\\", \\"suppose'\\" rather than \\"supposed\\" (with the -s pronounced softly, rather than as a -z). When it is pronounced it is softly, almost imperceptibly. Common in New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, but also found in downeast Maine, is aspirated speech; i.e., \\"Yeah\\" or \\"No\\", spoken while inhaling (colloquial pronunciation). This speech pattern bears no particular significance, other than its unusual nature. Competitive aspirated speech has been observed, with the intensity of aspiration increasing as conversation passes from one person to the next. The speaker is generally unaware of using this technique, and will frequently deny using it, when confronted. This is often referred to as a \\"Gaelic Gasp\\". Individual words and dialects may vary between provinces, and indeed, will vary between towns. On Prince Edward Island or Nova Scotia, \\"mouth\\" may be pronounced \\"mewth\\". In Newfoundland, \\"Mouth\\" may be pronounced as \\"Mout\\". Either province may also pronounce \\"Look\\" as simply \\"Luh\\", but only if the word was not used as part of a bigger sentence, such as pointing in a direction and saying \\"luh!\\", otherwise the letter \\"k\\" is pronounced, \\"Look here!\\". The phrase (for eating) \\"get it into you\\" is spoken quickly and almost as one word, \\"giggit-inta-ya\\". The phrase \\"Go away with you\\" (a phrase of disbelief) would be pronounced \\"go-way-with- ya\\" or \\"go-wee-witch-ya\\" spoken quickly as if all of one word. Having a big meal may be called \\"having a big feed\\" or \\"having a big scoff\\". Slang terms that would otherwise be considered insults in other parts of Canada are almost terms of endearment within Atlantic Canada. Terms of British origin are very much still a part of Maritime English, depending on dialects. Chesterfield, front room, gob, and parlour are examples of this. Another is the use of the somewhat vulgar \\"arse\\" in place of the American and central and western Canadian form, \\"ass\\". Other examples of British terms that may be heard in the rest of Canada, but less frequently than in the Maritimes, include \\"holiday\\" for vacation, \\"sweets\\" for candy, \\"Mum\\" for Mom and \\"cellar\\" for basement. Prince Edward Islanders often use more British terms than any other Maritimers, due to the overwhelming homogeneity of the province's Scottish and Irish ethnicity. Examples include referring to the hood of a car as an \\"engine bonnet\\" and a barn as a \\"byre\\". The latter is much more common amongst older speakers. The arse end of a car may also be referred to as the \\"boot\\". \\"Go to the arse end of the car, lift the bonnet, and check inside the boot. Luh! I found the tire iron! Right where it's s'poseda be!\\". Going for a \\"ramble\\" would refer to going for a long walk for pleasure. Truancy is often referred to as playing hookey, skipping, ditching, or jigging. Some Maritimers, particularly Prince Edward Islanders, will describe treacherous winter roads as \\"slippy\\" rather than \\"slippery\\". Some Maritimers will also add an /s/ to the end of \\"somewhere\\" and \\"anywhere\\", producing \\"somewheres\\" and \\"anywheres\\". The names of meals are not always used in the same way as in other parts of the country: \\"dinner\\" may refer to the meal eaten at midday; \\"supper\\" is the evening meal; and occasionally, particularly with older speakers, \\"lunch\\" refers to a snack eaten outside of regular meal times (for example, a \\"bed lunch\\" is a bedtime snack). \\"Breakfast\\" is used for the morning meal, as it is elsewhere in Canada. Many terms and phrases that are derived from the region's nautical background and are often shared with Britain, Ireland and New England. Examples of this include terms such as \\"reef\\" in place of \\"pull\\" and a deckhand on a boat being referred to as a \\"cork\\". A common way to describe drunkenness is to state that someone is \\"three sheets to the wind\\", which is a phrase used to describe a ship swaying in the wind due to loose sheets (ropes) in the rigging. A \\"jigger\\" can refer to any object, \\"I can't change the TV channel without the jigger!\\" The phrase \\"I like the cut of your jib\\" (a jib is a forward sail which cuts or draws into the wind) means to understand or agree what someone is talking about in a conversation, or to approve of ones actions. It is not uncommon to hear one use the word \\"downstream\\" to refer to any location being a distance or direction to head to; such as \\"Im heading downstream into town\\". The word \\"Landed\\" (a boat landing on shore) can refer to arriving at a location by any means; \\"I landed at my neighbour's house last night\\". Some speakers make liberal use of profanity, with varying degrees of creativity. A couple of commonly heard phrases elsewhere unused are \\"Jeezlus\\" and \\"un-fuckin-real\\". In jest, friends will often inquire to their peers as to whether or not they \\"are fucked\\", usually when chirping. Profanity is commonly used to indicated the intensity of an opinion; many Maritime English speakers would be quick to understand that the sentence \\"Some jeezlus hot, wha?\\" means \\"It is currently very hot outside\\". In common with Australian and New Zealand English, Atlantic Canadians use the term \\"sook\\" (pronounced like \\"book\\") to mean a cry-baby or whinger.  Spelling  International English Spelling Chart Canadian English shows a more balanced mixture of American and British standards in spelling. * Words such as realize and paralyze are usually spelled with -ize or -yze rather than -ise or -yse. (The etymological convention that verbs derived from Greek roots are spelled with -ize and those from Latin with -ise is preserved in that practice.Sir Ernest Gowers, ed., Fowler's Modern English Usage, 2nd ed. (Oxford: OUP, 1965), 314.) * French- derived words that in American English end with -or and -er, such as color or center, often retain British spellings (colour and centre). * While the United States uses the Anglo-French spelling defense and offense (noun), most Canadians use the British spellings defence and offence. (Note that defensive and offensive are universal.) * Some nouns, as in British English, take -ice while matching verbs take -ise ‚Äì for example, practice and licence are nouns while practise and license are the respective corresponding verbs.

Based at the Estes Kefauver Federal Building and United States Courthouse in Nashville, it was created in 1839 when Congress added a third district to the state. Tennessee‚Äîalong with Kentucky, Ohio, and Michigan‚Äîis located within the area covered by United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, and appeals are taken to that court (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit). Donald Q. Cochran is the United States Attorney. The Middle District has three divisions. (1) The Columbia Division comprises the counties of Giles, Hickman, Lawrence, Lewis, Marshall, Maury, and Wayne. (2) The Northeastern Division comprises the counties of Clay, Cumberland, DeKalb, Fentress, Jackson, Macon, Overton, Pickett, Putnam, Smith, and White. (3) The Nashville Division comprises the counties of Cannon, Cheatham, Davidson, Dickson, Houston, Humphreys, Montgomery, Robertson, Rutherford, Stewart, Sumner, Trousdale, Williamson, and Wilson.  History  The United States District Court for the District of Tennessee was established with one judgeship on January 31, 1797, by .Asbury Dickens, A Synoptical Index to the Laws and Treaties of the United States of America (1852), p. 391.U.S. District Courts of Tennessee, Legislative history, Federal Judicial Center. The judgeship was filled by President George Washington's appointment of John McNairy. Since Congress failed to assign the district to a circuit, the court had the jurisdiction of both a district court and a circuit court. Appeals from this one district court went directly to the United States Supreme Court. On February 13, 1801, in the famous \\"Midnight Judges\\" Act of 1801, , Congress abolished the U.S. district court in Tennessee, and expanded the number of circuits to six, provided for independent circuit court judgeships, and abolished the necessity of Supreme Court Justices riding the circuits. It was this legislation which created the grandfather of the present Sixth Circuit. The act provided for a \\"Sixth Circuit\\" comprising two districts in the State of Tennessee, one district in the State of Kentucky and one district, called the Ohio District, composed of the Ohio and Indiana territories (the latter including the present State of Michigan). The new Sixth Circuit Court was to be held at \\"Bairdstown\\" in the District of Kentucky, at Knoxville in the District of East Tennessee, at Nashville in the District of West Tennessee, and at Cincinnati in the District of Ohio. Unlike the other circuits which were provided with three circuit judges, the Sixth Circuit was to have only one circuit judge with district judges from Kentucky and Tennessee comprising the rest of the court. Any two judges constituted a quorum. New circuit judgeships were to be created as district judgeships in Kentucky and Tennessee became vacant.The Honorable Harry Phillips, \\"History of the Sixth Circuit \\". The repeal of this Act restored the District on March 8, 1802, . The District was divided into the Eastern and Western Districts on April 29, 1802. On February 24, 1807, Congress again abolished the two districts and created the United States Circuit for the District of Tennessee. On March 3, 1837, Congress assigned the judicial district of Tennessee to the Eighth Circuit. On June 18, 1839, by , Congress divided Tennessee into three districts, Eastern, Middle, and Western.Alfred Conkling, A Treatise on the Organization, Jurisdiction and Practice of the Courts of the United States (1842), p. 42. Again, only one judgeship was allotted for all three districts. On July 15, 1862, Congress reassigned appellate jurisdiction to the Sixth Circuit. Finally, on June 14, 1878, Congress authorized a separate judgeship for the Western District of Tennessee, at which time President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed David M. Key as judge for the Eastern and Middle Districts of Tennessee. The first judge to serve only the Middle District of Tennessee was John J. Gore, appointed by Warren G. Harding.

Johan Frederik Thaulow was born in Christiania, the son of a wealthy chemist, Harald Conrad Thaulow (1815‚Äì1881), and Nicoline (\\"Nina\\") Louise Munch (1821‚Äì1894). Thaulow was educated at the Academy of Art in Copenhagen in 1870‚Äì1872, and from 1873 until 1875 he studied with Hans Gude at the Baden School of Art in Karlsruhe.Harald Thaulow (Store norske leksikon)Frits Thaulow (Kulturnett.no) Thaulow was one of the earliest artists to paint in Skagen in the north of Jutland, soon to become famous for its Skagen Painters. He arrived there in 1879 with his friend Christian Krohg, who persuaded him to spend the summer and autumn there. They arrived from Norway in Thaulow's little boat. Thaulow, who had specialized in marine painting, turned to Skagen's favourite subjects, the fishermen and the boats on the shore.\\"Frits Thaulow: 'Fra Skagen' 1879\\", Blomqvist. Retrieved 25 October 2013. After his stay in Skagen, Thaulow returned to Norway in 1880. He became one of the leading young figures in the Norwegian art scene, together with Christian Krohg and Erik Werenskiold, and he helped establish the first National Art Exhibit (also known as H√∏stutstillingen or Autumn Exhibit) in 1882. Many of Thaulow's best known Norwegian scenes are from √Ösg√•rdstrand, which had become an important center for artists and painters dating from the 1880s.Impressionism: Frits Thaulow (Allpaintings Art Portal) Thaulow moved to France in 1892, living there until his death in 1906. He soon discovered that the cityscapes of Paris did not suit him. His best paintings were made in small towns such as Montreuil-sur- Mer (1892‚Äì94), Dieppe and surrounding villages (1894‚Äì98), Quimperle in Brittany (1901) and Beaulieu-sur-Dordogne in the Corr√®ze d√©partement (1903). One of his most famous works once he moved to france was A village street in France. Norwegian painter and engraver Frits Thaulow (GoNorway) In Dieppe Thaulow and his wife Alexandra made themselves popular: they were friends with artist Charles Conder, and they met Aubrey Beardsley.Simona Pakenham, Sixty Miles from England, p.148-149 Thaulow received a number of honors for his artistic activity, including his appointment as commander of the 2nd Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1905. He received the French Legion of Honor, the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus from Italy and the Order of Nichan Iftikhar from Tunisia. He died in Volendam, in The Netherlands. The National Gallery of Norway features 37 of his works. Other prominent displays include the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Busch-Reisinger Museum at Harvard University. Personal life Thaulow was married twice. In 1874 he married Ingeborg Charlotte Gad (1852‚Äì1908). The marriage dissolved in 1886. In 1886, he married Alexandra Lasson (1862‚Äì1955), the daughter of Carl Lasson (1830‚Äì1893), a noted Norwegian attorney.

His early poetry concerned a desire to be united with a beloved in death. Achterberg was born in Nederlangbroek in the Netherlands as the third son of a family of eight children. He was raised as a Protestant within the Calvinist tradition. His father was a coachman until the automobile gained popularity. Achterberg was a very good student, and in 1924 he embarked on a career as a teacher. In the same year, he made his literary debut together with Arie Dekkers, who had encouraged him to write, together publishing De Zangen van Twee Twintigers (English: The Songs of Two Twenty-Somethings). Meanwhile, Achterberg became more withdrawn and introverted. After he was turned down by the military due to \\"sickness of the soul\\", he threatened to kill himself. Achterberg's literary career began to take off when presented himself as his mentor. Achterberg published his collection \\"Afvaart\\" in 1931, in which his famous theme, of a love irrevocably lost, was already strongly present. After the publication of \\"Afvaart\\", Achterberg suffered a mental breakdown and was committed to a psychiatric institution several times. His mental instability caused occasional violent outbursts. These eruptions of violence escalated in 1937. At that time, Achterberg was living in Utrecht and was again engaged to be married. On December 15, 1937, he tried to force himself on Bep van Es, the 16 year old daughter of his landlady. When the latter tried to stop him, he shot and killed her, and wounded her daughter. After the shooting, he turned himself in and was sentenced to involuntary commitment. He was committed until 1943. During this commitment and the period following (between 1939 and 1953), he published 22 collections of poetry. In 1946 he married his childhood friend Cathrien van Baak, with whom he lived in Leusden until he died from a heart attack in 1962. In 1959, Achterberg received the Constantijn Huygens Prize for his entire body of work. Achterberg's most famous work is the Ballad Reiziger doet Golgotha (A Tourist Does Golgotha)and the sonnet sequence Ballade van de gasfitter (1953;Ballad of the gasfitter). J.M. Coetzee included this sonnet sequence in an anthology of his English translations of Dutch poetry entitled Landscape with Rowers (2004).J.M. Coetzee, Landscape with Rowers, Princeton University Press 2004, . Earlier in his career, Coetzee also wrote an essay on this sonnet sequence, titled: 'Achterberg's \\"Ballade van de gasfitter\\": The Mystery of I and You' (1977),in which he discusses the shifting point of view in relation the main character of the poem. The essay is included in: J.M. Coetzee, Doubling the Point, Harvard University Press 1992, p.69-90.

She made her London debut in 1883. She played many Shakespearean roles, but is best known as a pioneer of major roles in the works of Ibsen and George Bernard Shaw. Her most notable role was as Nora in the first English production of A Doll's House (1889). She was married to actor Charles Charrington. Background Born as Janet Sharp on 17 January 1864 in Chorlton-on-Medlock, Manchester, her mother died during childbirth and she was reared by her father William Prior Sharp, an insurance agent. Her maternal grandparents, James and Mary Achurch, managed the Theatre Royal in Manchester. She became an actress after ending her education in 1881 and joining Sarah Thorne's stock company in Margate. Career Janet Achurch's first appearance on stage was in 1883 at the Olympic Theatre in London in the farcical Betsy Baker. From 1883 to her retirement in 1913, she appeared in a wide range of roles, in London, touring England, as well as Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, India, and Egypt. In 1889 she took over management of the Novelty Theatre in London. That year she played one of her most notable roles as Nora in the English premiere of Ibsen's A Doll's House. This enhanced her own fame as well as Ibsen's standing in England. George Bernard Shaw wrote the title role of his play Candida with her in mind and would only allow the play to be performed if Achurch played the title role, which took place in 1897 at Her Majesty's Theatre. In 1889, during her tour with her actor husband Charles Charrington in Egypt, she gave birth to a stillborn child in Cairo, almost dying herself during the birth. The lingering pains increased her addiction to morphine. Retirement and death Her last performance was in 1913 as Merete Bery in Wiers-Jenssen's The Witch. Due to exhaustion and illness, she declared her retirement as soon as the production closed. She died of \\"morphine poisoning\\" on 11 September 1916, aged 52, at Ventnor, Isle of Wight.

The Icebird's maiden voyage to Antarctica began when she departed from Cape Town, South Africa in November 1984. In 1996, the vessel was renamed Polar Bird. Specifications Billed by her builders as the world's first purpose-built polar resupply vessel, the Icebird was custom made for Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE) by Antarktis und Spezialfahrt Schiffartsgesellschaft GmbH (GSS) in Germany. Due to the large-scale rebuilding program underway at Australia's stations, the Australian Antarctic Division needed to increase the cargo space available to transport building materials. Icebird's ability to carry containers enabled the rebuilding program to switch over to the AANBUS modular construction that is so characteristic of ANARE's continental stations today. Icebird's bow was constructed to the latest ice-breaking design, which its owners claimed would allow it to break one-year old ice with continuous speed, and so avoid the constant threat to Antarctic shipping: besetment (being surrounded by ice without helm control). The vessel was also equipped with a temperature- controlled double skin for both the cargo holds and engine room, maintained by circulating heated fuel around the ship. It carried a helicopter and specially strengthened flight deck. The 'tween-deck hatch covers doubled as pontoons, accompanied by an ice-strengthened pusher barge, features which would permit offloading cargo in remote areas. \\"It was a standard box construction, superstructure aft with side cranes. But it gave you tremendous capability - you just opened the top of the ship ... and dropped everything in and closed it up and off you went,\\" said John Whitelaw, the Acting Assistant Director of Operations, describing the ship's unique cargo facilities. \\"Icebird was fitted with a detachable accommodation module that could carry 100 passengers. It was clamped to the ship in front of the bridge and was secured with bolts,\\" according to an interview with John Whitelaw and Annie Rushton, ANARE Jubilee Project, 21 August 1995. Fitout Icebird fitments include: * dishwashers * videos * bar * two-bed hospital and surgery * air-conditioning * laundry service Master The master for many years in the 1980s was Captain Ewald Brune (1951-) from Germany. He achieved 88 voyages and 25 years of Polar Maritime activity in all regions of Antarctica.http://www.ewald- brune.com/cv.html Captain Ewald Brune Icebreaking Icebreaking class: Germanischer Lloyd 2002 Pt. 1, Sec. 15-A,Bhttp://meeting.helcom.fi/c/document_library/get_file?p_l_id=18816&folderId;=75218&name;=DLFE-30261.pdf Nella Dan rescue The Icebird participated in the rescue of over 100 expeditioners and crew from the Nella Dan, which was wrecked on Macquarie Island on the evening of 3 December 1987, during resupply operations at Macquarie Island. At the time the Icebird was returning to Hobart from Davis Station in Antarctica. She arrived at Buckles Bay on 8 December 1987. Decommissioning and revival The Icebird remained on charter to ANARE until 1994, when it was decided that Australia's Antarctic program should revert to a one ship option as a cost-cutting measure, one which aroused considerable concern within the ANARE community. Only two years later, during the 1998-99 season, the Aurora Australis was temporarily out of service, and a replacement ship was hired - the Icebird. Reborn under the new name of Polar Bird, and now with Norwegian owners, the Polar Bird has been chartered several years since by ANARE.

Systems for co-located audiences combine wireless hardware with presentation software, and systems for remote audiences may use telephones or web polls for audiences watching through television or the Internet. Various names are used for this technology, including real time response, the worm, dial testing, and audience response meters. In educational settings, such systems are often called \\"student response systems\\" or \\"personal response systems.\\" The hand-held remote control that students use to convey their responses to questions is often called a \\"clicker.\\" More recent entrants into the market do not require specialized hardware. There are commercial and open- source, cloud-based tools that allow responses from the audience using a range of personal computing devices such as cell phones, smartphones, and laptops. These types of systems have added new types of functionality as well, such as free text responses that are aggregated into sortable word clouds, as well as the more traditional true/false and multiple choice style questions. This type of system also mitigates some of the concerns articulated below in the \\"Challenges of audience response\\" section.  Co-located audiences  Hardware Based Audience Response: The presenter uses a computer and a video projector to project a presentation for the audience to see. In the most common use of such audience response systems, presentation slides built with the audience response software display questions with several possible answers, more commonly referred to as multiple choice questions. The audience participates by selecting the answer they believe to be correct and pushing the corresponding key on their individual wireless keypad. Their answer is then sent to a base station ‚Äì or receiver ‚Äì that is also attached to the presenter's computer. The audience response software collects the results, and the aggregate data is graphically displayed within the presentation for all to see. Some clickers also have additional keys, allowing the presenter to ask (and audience members to answer) True/False questions or even questions calling for particular numerical answers. Depending on the presenter's requirements, the data can either be collected anonymously (e.g., in the case of voting) or it can be traced to individual participants in circumstances where tracking is required (e.g., classroom quizzes, homework, or questions that ultimately count towards a student's course grade). Incoming data may also be stored in a database that resides on the host computer, and data reports can be created after the presentation for further analysis. Software/Cloud Based Audience Response: The presenter uses a computer to create the questions, sometimes called polls. In this case however, those questions can be open ended, dial testing, and votable open ended as well as multiple choice. Those questions are then downloaded into the presenter's presentation program of choice. During the presentation, the questions automatically display within the presentation program, or from a web browser, and can in some cases even be displayed only on the participant's tablet computer or smartphone. Results are instantly tabulated via the internet, and presented on screen in real time, including grading the \\"correct\\" answer if desired. Some services offer presenters real time moderation for open ended responses or questions prior to displaying them on screen. Depending on the presenter's requirements, the data can be collected anonymously, or it can be traced to individual participants who have created accounts in advance of the poll. This method is commonly used on corporate training where attendance must be verified, and in classrooms, where grades must be assigned. Data from both methods can be saved and analyzed by the presenter and loaded manually or via API into learning management systems.  Distributed, virtual, or hybrid  Only software or cloud based audience response systems can accommodate distributed audiences, due to the inconveniences and costs of hardware devices.  Benefits  There are many reasons for the use of audience response systems (ARS). The tendency to answer based on crowd psychology is reduced because, unlike hand raising, it is difficult to see which selection others are making. The ARS also allows for faster tabulation of answers for large groups than manual methods. Additionally, many college professors use ARS systems to take attendance or grade answers in large lecture halls, which would be highly time-consuming without the system. Audience response offers many potential benefits to those who use it in group settings. * Improve attentiveness: In a study done at four University of Wisconsin campuses (University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìEau Claire, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìOshkosh, and University of Wisconsin‚ÄìWhitewater), faculty members and students in courses using clickers were given a survey that assessed their attitudes about clicker use in Fall 2005 and its effect on teaching and learning. Of the 27 faculty members who responded to the survey, 94 percent either agreed or strongly agreed with the claim \\"Clickers increased student engagement in the classroom,\\" with the remaining six percent responding that they were neutral about that claim. (None of the faculty respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed with the claim.) Similarly, 69 percent of the 2,684 student respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the claim \\"Clickers led me to become engaged in class,\\" with only 13 percent disagreeing or strongly disagreeing with that claim.Kaleta, Robert, and Joosten, Tanya. \\"Student Response Systems: A University of Wisconsin System Study of Clickers,\\" Educause Center for Applied Research Research Bulletin. Vol. 2007, Issue 10, May 8, 2007, pp. 4‚Äì6. A public version of the information, in the form of a PowerPoint presentation about the findings, is available at: http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/EDU06283.pdf. * Increase knowledge retention: In the same University of Wisconsin study, 74 percent of the faculty respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the claim \\"Clickers have been beneficial to my students' learning,\\" with the remaining 26 percent choosing a \\"neutral\\" response. (No faculty respondent disagreed or strongly disagreed with the claim.) Similarly, 53 percent of the student respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the claim \\"Clickers have been beneficial to my learning,\\" with only 19 percent disagreeing or strongly disagreeing with that claim.Kaleta, Robert, and Joosten, Tanya. \\"Student Response Systems: A University of Wisconsin System Study of Clickers,\\" Educause Center for Applied Research Research Bulletin.

A public version of the information, in the form of a PowerPoint presentation about the findings, is available at: http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/EDU06283.pdf. In a different but related study, Catherine Crouch and Eric Mazur more directly measured the results of Peer Instruction and \\"ConcepTests\\" on student learning and retention of information at the end of a semester. Faculty members using this \\"Peer Instruction\\" pedagogical technique present information to students, then ask the students a question that tests their understanding of a key concept. Students indicate their answer to the instructor using an audience response system, and then they discuss with their fellow students why they chose a particular answer, trying to explain to one another their underlying thinking. The instructor then asks the question again to see the new student results.Crouch, Catherine H., and Mazur, Eric. \\"Peer Instruction: Ten years of experience and results.\\" Am. J. Phys.

The study authors used scanned forms and hand-raising for audience response in the initial year of the study, and then they switched to a computer-based audience response system in the following years. The \\"clicker\\" use was only part of a multi-pronged attempt to introduce peer instruction, but overall they found that \\"the students taught with P[eer] I[instruction] (Spring 2000, N = 155) significantly outperformed the students taught traditionally (Spring 1999, N = 178)\\" on two standard tests ‚Äì the \\"Force Concept Inventory and the Mechanics Baseline Test\\" ‚Äì and on traditional course exams as well.Crouch, Catherine H., and Mazur, Eric. \\"Peer Instruction: Ten years of experience and results.\\" Am.

A Johns Hopkins study on the use of audience response systems in Continuing Medical Education (CME) for physicians and other health personnel found no significant difference in knowledge scores between ARS and non-ARS participants in a clinical round table trial involving 42 programs across the United States.Miller, Redonda G., Ashar, Bimal H. and Getz, Kelly J. \\"Evaluation of an audience response system for the continuing education of health professionals.\\" Journal of Continuing Education in the Health Professions. Vol. 23, No. 2, 2003. pp.109‚Äì115. Abstract at http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/110478084/abstract * Poll anonymously: Unlike a show of hands or a raising of cards with letters on them, sending responses by hand-held remotes is much more anonymous. Except perhaps for a student (our audience member) who watches what the person next to him/her submits, the other students (or audience members) can't really see what response his/her fellow audience members are giving, and the software that summarizes the results aggregates the responses, listing what percent of respondents chose a particular answer, but not what individual respondents said. With some audience response systems, the software allows you to ask questions in truly anonymous mode, so that the database (or \\"gradebook\\") is not even associating answers with individual respondents. * Track individual responses: The \\"clickers\\" that audience members use to send their responses to the receiver (and thus to the presenter's computer) are often registered to a particular user, with some kind of identifying number. When a user sends his/her response, the information is stored in a database (sometimes called the \\"Gradebook\\" in academic models of audience response systems) associated with each particular number, and presenters have access to that information after the end of the interactive session. Audience response systems can often be linked to a Learning management system, which increases the ability to keep track of individual student performance in an academic setting. * Display polling results immediately: The audience response system includes software that runs on the presenter's computer that records and tabulates the responses by audience members. Generally, once a question has ended (polling from the audience has ceased), the software displays a bar chart indicating what percent of audience members chose the various possible responses. For questions with right/wrong answers, audience members can get immediate feedback about whether they chose the correct answer, since it can be indicated on the bar chart. For survey-type polling questions, audience members can see from the summary how many other audience members chose the same response, along with how many audience members (or what percent of the audience) chose different responses. * Create an interactive and fun learning environment: Clickers are in many ways novel devices, so the novelty itself can add interest to the learning environment. More important, though, is the interactive nature of audience response systems. Having been asked a particular question about a concept or opinion, students are genuinely interested in seeing the results. They want to learn if they answered the question correctly, and they want to see how their response compares to the responses of their fellow audience members.Beatty, Ian. \\"Transforming Student Learning with Classroom Communication Systems,\\" Educause Center for Applied Research Research Bulletin. Volume 2004, Issue 3 (February 3, 2004), p. 5. Available online at http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ERB0403.pdf. The increased student engagement cited in the University of Wisconsin study (see footnote 1 below) attests to the ability of audience response systems to improve the learning environment. * Confirm audience understanding of key points immediately: In the University of Wisconsin study previously cited, faculty members were unanimous in their recognition of this key advantage of audience response systems. In other words, 100% of the faculty respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with the claim \\"Clickers allowed me to assess student knowledge on a particular concept.\\". Students also recognized this benefit for their own self-assessment. 75% of student respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the claim, \\"Clickers helped me get instant feedback on what I knew and didn't know.\\" In a published article, a member of the University of Massachusetts Amherst Physics Education Research Group (UMPERG)articulated this advantage in more detail, using the term \\"Classroom Communication System (CCS)\\" for what we have been calling an audience response system: ::By providing feedback to an instructor about students' background knowledge and preconceptions, CCS-based pedagogy can help the instructor design learning and experiences appropriate to student's state of knowledge and explicitly confront and resolve misconceptions. By providing frequent feedback about students' ongoing learning and confusions, it can help an instructor dynamically adjust her teaching to students' real, immediate, changing needs. * Gather data for reporting and analysis: Unlike other forms of audience participation (such as a show of hands or holding up of response cards), audience response systems use software to record audience responses, and those responses are stored in a database. Database entries are linked to a particular user, based on some ID number entered into the handheld remote device or based on a registration between the user and the company that manufactures the handheld device. Answers can be analyzed over time, and the data can be used for educational research or other forms of analysis.  Challenges  Audience response systems may present some difficulties in both their deployment and use. * The per-unit purchase price of ARS devices, typically 10 times the cost of a software only solution * The maintenance and repair of devices when owned by a central unit or organization * The configuration, troubleshooting and support of the related presentation software (which may or may not work well with ARS devices) * The reliability and performance of the devices under non-optimal conditions of the room in which the devices are used * For hardware only applications: a Lack of open ended questions, dial testing capabilities, and other non standard question formats.  Applications  Audience response is utilized across a broad range of industries and organizations. A few examples include: * Political Campaigns * Political news events * Corporate training * Control self-assessment * Delegate voting * Public participation in municipal or environmental planning * Market research * Decision support * Game shows e.g. Ask the audience on Who Wants to be a Millionaire? * Conferences and events * Executive decision making * Continuing medical education * ROI measurement and assessment * Sales Effectiveness Training * Hospital patient exit surveys  Audience response systems  An audience response system (ARS), or personal response system (PRS), allow large groups of people to vote on a topic or answer a question. Depending on the solution chosen, each person has a device with which selections can be made, or a mobile device that they can use to respond. In a hardware solution, each remote communicates with a computer via receivers located around the room or via a single receiver connected to the presenter's computer using a USB connector. In a software solution, each device communicates with the question via SMS or the internet. After a set time ‚Äì or after all participants have answered ‚Äì the system ends the polling for that particular question and tabulates the results. Typically, the results are instantly made available to the participants via a bar graph displayed on the projector but can also be viewed in a web browser for some systems. In situations where tracking is required, the serial number of each remote control or the students identity number is entered beforehand in the control computer's database. In this way the answer of each individual can later be identified. In addition to the presenter's computer and projector, the typical audience response system has the following components: * base station (receiver)--for hardware based solutions only * wireless keypads (one for each participant)--or mobile devices for software/cloud based solutions * audience response system software = History = Since the 1960s, a number of companies have offered Response Systems, several of whom are now defunct or changed their business model. Circa 1966, Audience Studies Institute of Hollywood, California developed a proprietary analog ARS system for evaluating the response of a theater audience to unreleased motion pictures, television shows and commercials. This early ARS was used by ASI's clients ‚Äì major motion picture and television studios and advertising agencies ‚Äì to evaluate the effectiveness of whatever it was they wanted to accomplish: for example, selling more products, increasing movie ticket sales, and achieving a higher fee per commercial slot. Often, a client would show different versions to different audiences, e.g. different movie endings, to gauge their relative effectiveness. ASI would give out free tickets on the street to bring people into the theater, called the \\"Preview House,\\" for particular showings where each attendee would fill out a questionnaire and then be placed in a seat with a \\"dial\\" handset outfitted with a single knob that each attendee would turn to a position to indicate his or her level of interest. Turning the knob all the way left for \\"dull\\" to turning all the way to the right for \\"great.\\" In 1976, ASI upgraded their system to become fully digital, have Yes/No buttons and, in some cases, numeric keys for entering in numbers, choices and monetary amounts. Another of the industry‚Äôs very earliest systems was the Consensor. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, William W. (Bill) Simmons, an IBM executive, reflected on how unproductive most meetings were. Simmons had become essentially a nonacademic futurist in building up IBM's long-range planning operations.. He was one of the pioneers of applied future studies in the private sector, that is, future studies applied to corporate planning. Through this work he had met Theodore J. (Ted) Gordon of The Futures Group (now part of Palladium International).. Gordon had conceived and partially developed what would today be called an audience response system, and Simmons immediately saw practical applications for it in large corporate meetings, to allow people to air their true opinions in anonymous fashion, so that each individual's Likert scale answer value for a question would remain secret, but the group's average, weighted with weighting factors, would be instantly displayed. Thus (something approximating) the group's true consensus would be known, even though individual middle managers or aspiring junior executives would not have to jeopardize their conformity to effect this result. (IBM's organizational culture was famous for its valuing of conformity; and this was common at other firms, too..) Simmons retired from IBM in January 1972,. and soon after he formed a startup company with Gordon, called Applied Futures, Inc.,. to develop and market the system, which they called the Consensor [connoting consensus + sensor]. Applied Futures was one of the first audience response companies. In 1972, while Gordon and his assistant Harold S. (Hal) Becker were still working on development, Applied Futures filed for a patent (), which was granted in 1973 with Gordon and Becker as inventors. Another patent, filed for in 1974 and granted in 1976 (), lists Simmons and James A. Marquis. Sales began in 1974.. The Consensor was a system of dials, wires, and three lights; red, yellow, and green. A question was asked verbally and people would turn their dials anywhere from 0 to 10. If the majority agreed, the green lamp would light. If not, either the yellow or red lamp would light, depending on the level of disagreement. Although business was strong for this fledgling company,. the command-and-control management style of the day proved a formidable opponent to this new tool, which promoted consensus building.. In his memoir Simmons describes how junior-executive sales prospects tended to like the idea, imagining themselves heroically speaking truth to power (but not paying any price for being a maverick), while their senior-executive bosses tended to see the Consensor as \\"a blatant attempt to impose democratic procedures into a corporate hierarchy that is anything but democratic.\\" Simmons observed that \\"A majority of corporations are run as fiefdoms, with the CEO playing the role of Supreme Power; he may be a benevolent dictator, but nonetheless still a dictator.\\" He described this type of senior executives, with ironic tone, as \\"secure in the knowledge of their own infallibility.\\" Nonetheless, Applied Futures sold plenty of units to business firms and government agencies. In October 1984, it became a subsidiary of Brooks International Corporation, a management consulting firm.. One of the early educational uses of an audience response system occurred at Rice University.Lane, David, and Atlas, Robert. \\"The Networked Classroom,\\" Paper presented at the 1996 meeting of Computers and Psychology, York, UK, March 1996. Abstract available at: \\"http://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/78034/networked_classroom_%28Audience_Response_System%29-1.pdf?sequence=1 \\" Students in a computer-equipped classroom were able to rate how well they understood portions of a lecture, answer multiple choice questions, and answer short essay questions. Results could be tallied and displayed to the class. Audience response technology has evolved over time, moving away from hardware that required extensive wiring towards hand held wireless devices and small, portable receivers. In the 1980s, the Consensor product line evolved toward peripherals that could be plugged into a PC, and a software application to run thereon. Wireless LANs allow today's peripherals to be cordless. Another example of this is Microsoft's Mouse Mischief, a PowerPoint add-in, which has made it easier for teachers, professors, and office professionals to integrate audience response into their presentations. The advent of smartphones has made possible systems in which audience members download an app (or run it as SaaS in their web browser) which then communicates with the audience response system (which is itself just software running on someone's device, whether desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone) via the local wireless network, the cellular telephone network, or both. In this model, the entire audience response system is a software product; all of the hardware is what the users brought with them.. = Experts = There are two books that have been written specifically about audience response systems by people who are considered experts in the use of audience response technology. In 2009, Derek Bruff, a professor at Vanderbilt University, published Teaching with Classroom Response Systems: Creating Active Learning Environments. In 2015, David Campt, a meeting strategist and civic engagement consultant, released Read the Room for Real: How a Simple Technology Creates Better Meetings was published; this book focused on using audience response technology in non-academic environments. = Hardware = The majority of current audience response systems use wireless hardware. Two primary technologies exist to transmit data from the keypads to the base stations: infrared (IR) and radio frequency (RF). A few companies also offer Web-based software that routes the data over the Internet (sometimes in a unified system with IR and RF equipment). Cell phone-based systems are also becoming available.  Infrared  The oldest of these technologies, IR audience response systems are better suited for smaller groups. IR uses the same technology as a TV remote, and is therefore the only one of the four technologies that requires line-of-sight between the keypad and receiver. This works well for a single keypad but can fail due to interference when signals from multiple keypads arrive simultaneously at the receiver. IR systems are typically more affordable than RF systems, but do not provide information back to the keypad.  Use in educational settings  Audience response systems can be used as a way of incorporating active learning in a lecture or other classroom-type setting, for example by quizzing students, taking a quick survey, etc. They can also be used for taking attendance. They can be used effectively by students as young as 9 or 10, depending on their maturity level. An educator is able to generate worksheets and let students enter their answer choices at their own pace. After each question, the educator is able to instantly show the results of any quiz, for example in the form of histogram thus creating rapid 2-way feedback about how well learners are doing. The fact that students can send responses anonymously means that sensitive topics can be included more readily than would otherwise be the case. An example of this is in helping students to learn about plagiarism.http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/12132/1/Using_technology_to_prevent_plagiarism_Draft_submission.pdf Audience response systems can also be used in classroom settings to simulate randomized controlled trials (RCT) such as 'Live the Trial', a mock RCT used to teach the concepts of clinical research. The mock trial answered the question 'Do red smarties make you happier?\\". = Radio frequency (RF) = Ideal for large group environments, RF systems can accommodate hundreds of voters on a single base station. Using some systems, multiple base stations can be linked together in order to handle audiences that number in thousands. Other systems allow over a thousand on just one base. Because the data travels via radio frequency, the participant merely needs to be within range of the base station (300 ‚Äì 500 feet). Some advanced models can accommodate additional features, such as short word answers, user log-in capabilities, and even multi-site polling. = Internet = Web-based audience response systems work with the participants' existing computing devices. These include notebook computers, smartphones and PDAs, which are typically connected to the Internet via Wi-Fi, as well as classroom desktop computers. If the facilitator's computer is also Wi-Fi-enabled, they can even create their own IP network, allowing a closed system that doesn't depend on a separate base station. The web server resides on or is accessible to the facilitator's computer, letting them control a set of web pages presenting questions. Participants log into the server using web browsers and see the questions with forms to input their responses. The summarized responses are available on a different set of pages, which can be displayed through the projector and also on each participant's device. Internet has also made it possible to gather audience responses in massive scale. Various implementations of the concept exist. For example, Microsoft featured Bing PulseState of the Union ‚Äì Bing Politics , Retrieved on 27 April 2013 during the 2013 State of The Union (US) address by president Barack Obama. The system allowed registered users to input their responses (positive, negative, neutral) to the address and visualized the results as a trending graph in real time. Bing Pulse has since been used to cast over 35 million votes during national news broadcasts and other live meetings. Over 10,000 viewers powered the iPowow Viewer Vote which tracked live viewer emotional response for Channel 7 during the 2013 Australian Federal Election debates and displayed as a live \\"worm\\" graph on the broadcast screen. For advertising and media research, online \\"dial testing\\" using an onscreen scale slider that is controlled by a mouse (or finger swipe on a touchscreen) is being used in conjunction with surveys and online communities to gather continuous feedback on video or audio files. = Cell phone = The familiarity and widespread use of cell phones and text messaging has now given rise to systems that collect SMS responses and display them through a web page. These solutions don't require specialized voting hardware, but they do require telecom hardware (such as a mobile phone) and software, along with a web server, and therefore tend to be operated by dedicated vendors selling usage. They are typically favored by traveling speaking professionals and large conference halls that don't want to distribute, rent, or purchase proprietary ARS hardware. Computing devices with web browsers can also use these serviceLLs through SMS gateways, if a separate web interface isn't provided. Cell Phone enabled response systems, such as SMS Response System, are able to take text inputs from the audience and receive multiple responses to questions per SMS. This allows a new pedagogical approach to teaching and learning, such as the work by Derek Bruff and an initiative on SMSRS. The advantage of using such SMS type of response system is not limited to the logistical advantage of the presenter keeping no device inventory, it comes with an associated range of pedagogical advantages, such as agile learning, peer instruction (as possible with all types of response systems), it affords additional educational features like MCQ-Reasoning ‚Äì a feature developed in a SMSRS system in Singapore that allows respondents to tag a reason to their choice of options in an MCQ, thus eliminating potential case of \\"guessing-the- correct-answer\\" syndrome, and text mining of SMS responses (to provide the gist of the messages collectively in a visual map). Interactive SMS Forum is another feature that is proprietary to SMS-type response systems where audiences not only post their questions, but can also answer the questions posted by others via SMS. = Smartphone / HTTP voting = With increasing penetration of smartphones with permanent internet connections, live audience response/voting can be achieved over the HTTP protocol. SMS is still a solid solution because of its penetration and stability, but won't easily allow multi-voting support and might cause problem with multi-country audiences. The issue with SMS not supporting multi-country audiences is projected to be solved with SMS hubbing. In classrooms and conferences with Wi-Fi support or anywhere with GPRS coverage, software systems can be used for live audience feedback, mood measurement or live polling. These systems frequently support voting with both mobile apps as well as mobile browsers. These apps invoke available local area networks (LAN) and provide a charge-free and cuts the needs to devoted hardware. With mobile apps and browser enabled voting, there aren't any setup costs for hardware since the audience uses their own phones as voting devices and the result is often presented in any browser controlled by the lecturer. With a standard mobile browser solution these are click and go solutions without additional installations. Therefore, live audiences can be reached, and smartphone voting can be used ‚Äì as with SMS ‚Äì in any number of different locations. With the GPRS solution the audience does not necessary need to be in the same area as the lecturer as with radio frequency, infrared or Bluetooth-based response systems. = Software = Audience response software enables the presenter to collect participant data, display graphical polling results, and export the data to be used in reporting and analysis. Usually the presenter can create and deliver her entire presentation with the ARS software, either as a stand-alone presentation platform or as a plug-in to PowerPoint or Keynote.

It is famous for its Licchavi stupa, called the Dhando Chaitya considered by many historians to be the oldest Buddhist Stupa in the valley. Currently, Chabahil has become a thriving residential and commercial area of Kathmandu. Apart from the large temples, there are many more small temples around them. Two of the most important temples in Kathmandu, Pashupatinath and Guhyeswari are situated very close to Chabahil. These two temples, dedicated to Lord Shiva and his consort Sati are considered to be more than a thousand years old. Charumati Vihara The stupa has attracted Buddhist monks and other pilgrims over the centuries. According to the inscriptions found within it, it was built by the Indian princess Charumati, daughter of Indian Emperor Ashoka, who was married to a Nepalese prince in Kathmandu.Dhanavajra Vajracharya', Licchavikalin Abhilekha, Kathmandu : Nepal Asiali Adyayan Sansthan, 2030 B.S. p-392 Near the Charumati Vihara, there is a beautiful stone statue of Buddha that is a meter high.

In chocolate, compound chocolate and similar coatings, PGPR is mainly used with another substance like lecithin to reduce viscosity. It is used at low levels (below 0.5%), and works by decreasing the friction between the solid particles (e.g. cacao, sugar, milk) in molten chocolate, reducing the yield stress so that it flows more easily, approaching the behaviour of a Newtonian fluid. It can also be used as an emulsifier in spreads and in salad dressings, or to improve the texture of baked goods. It is made up of a short chain of glycerol molecules connected by ether bonds, with ricinoleic acid side chains connected by ester bonds. PGPR is a yellowish, viscous liquid, and is strongly lipophilic: it is soluble in fats and oils and insoluble in water and ethanol. Manufacture Glycerol is heated to above 200 ¬∞C in a reactor in the presence of an alkaline catalyst to create polyglycerol. Castor oil fatty acids are separately heated to above 200 ¬∞C, to create interesterified ricinoleic fatty acids. The polyglycerol and the interesterified ricinoleic fatty acids are then mixed to create PGPR.  Use in chocolate  Because PGPR improves the flow characteristics of chocolate and compound chocolate, especially near the melting point, it can improve the efficiency of chocolate coating processes: chocolate coatings with PGPR flow better around shapes of enrobed and dipped products, and it also improves the performance of equipment used to produce solid molded products: the chocolate flows better into the mold, and surrounds inclusions and releases trapped air more easily. PGPR can also be used to reduce the quantity of cocoa butter needed in chocolate formulations: the solid particles in chocolate are suspended in the cocoa butter, and by reducing the viscosity of the chocolate, less cocoa butter is required, which saves costs, because cocoa butter is an expensive ingredient, and also leads to a lower-fat product.  Safety  The FDA has deemed PGPR to be generally recognized as safe for human consumption, and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) has also deemed it safe. Both of these organisations set the acceptable daily intake at 7.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. In Europe, PGPR is allowed in chocolate up to a level of 0.5%. Short-term studies on rats and chickens showed reversible liver enlargement as a result of higher doses of PGPR, which were deemed a result of increased hepatic (liver) workload alone. In a 1998 review funded by Unilever of safety evaluations from the late 1950s and early 1960s, \\"PGPR was found to be 98% digested by rats and utilized as a source of energy superior to starch and nearly equivalent to peanut oil.\\" Additionally, no evidence was found of interference with normal fat metabolism, nor with growth, reproduction, and maintenance of tissue. Overall, it did not \\"constitute a human health hazard\\". A study published in the European Food Safety Authority in 2017 re-evaluated the safety of the additive and recommended to revise the acceptable daily intake and increase it to 25 milligrams per kilogram of body weight.https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/4743  References   External links * PGPR replacing cocoa butter in chocolate Category:Food additives Category:Non-ionic surfactants Category:Organic polymers Category:Fatty acid esters Category:E-number additives ","title":"Polyglycerol polyricinoleate"},{"id":"5648113","title":"Tigrinya grammar"},{"id":"5648119","text":"The Young Riders is an American western television series created by Ed Spielman that presents a fictionalized account of a group of young Pony Express riders (some of whom are young versions of legendary figures in Old West history) based at the Sweetwater Station in the Nebraska Territory during the years leading up to the American Civil War. The series premiered on ABC on September 20, 1989 and ran for three seasons until the final episode aired on July 23, 1992. Production Filming of the original pilot for the series took place in California. After the ABC network picked it up, the series production moved to Tucson, Arizona, with filming in \\"Mescal\\", a western- themed movie town operated by Old Tucson Studios. Before the series premiere, producers of the 1988 film Young Guns filed a lawsuit against ABC and the series producers, claiming the series title combined with its plot infringed on their trademark. In the second season, Don Franklin joined the cast to portray the character Noah Dixon. In doing so, he became the third African- American actor to hold a starring role in a television western ‚Äì after Raymond St. Jacques, who had co-starred on the final season of Rawhide as cattle drover Simon Blake (1965) and Otis Young, who co-starred with Don Murray on the short-lived (1968‚Äì69) TV series The Outcasts. Having never ridden a horse before, Franklin was sent to \\"Cowboy Camp\\" for 3‚Äì4 days where he learned how to mount and dismount, and the basics of riding. Desiring to also work behind the cameras, Franklin talked with producers about writing and directing an episode for the series. In an interview, he noted that the series producers were very receptive and was regularly encouraging the cast to not only make suggestions, but also follow through with them. When the cast noted that they didn't like the series becoming a \\"guest-villain-of-the-week\\", it was changed to refocus back on the individual characters and their relationships with each other. Franklin himself also encouraged that more black characters be included in the series. Characters Aloysius \\"Teaspoon\\" Hunter (Anthony Zerbe) A former Texas Ranger and one of the few survivors of the Battle of the Alamo. A colorful yet immensely wise character, Teaspoon can be a tough task master but he cares about all of his riders. The Kid (Ty Miller) A soft-spoken southerner. He loves his horse, Katy, whom he purchased by winning the money to buy her in a boxing match. He is the first of the riders to learn that Lou is a girl, and he falls in love with her. William F. Cody (Stephen Baldwin) Buffalo Bill is arrogant, brash, and a bit on the goofy side, but also devoted to his friends. He is an excellent shot with long arms such as rifles. James Butler Hickok (Josh Brolin) Wild Bill is hot-tempered and quick to go for his gun. He is a fast draw and gains a reputation as a gunslinger that he doesn't particularly want as it causes people to come challenge him. His temper frequently gets him in trouble, though Teaspoon and Sam try to help him learn to control it. Buck Cross (Running Buck) (Gregg Rainwater) A half-Kiowa who is close friends with Ike. Buck helps break down stereotypes that the townsfolk have of Indians in the area. Louise \\"Lou\\" McCloud (Yvonne Suhor) Lou presents herself as a man so that she can join the riders. The Kid finds Lou out in the first episode, and the other riders when they help her rescue her brother and sister from their abusive outlaw father. She eventually falls in love with and marries The Kid. Sam Cain (Brett Cullen) Season 1 The current marshal of Sweetwater, and a former gunslinger. He is in love with Emma and she finally marries him at the end of Season 1. Because of his own past, Sam tries to help Hickok deal with his growing gunslinger reputation. Ike McSwain (Travis Fine) Ike is mute and bald, but that doesn't keep him from being an excellent rider. He is particularly close to Buck, who taught him sign language. Ike can be very passionate about protecting people. Noah Dixon (Don Franklin) Seasons 2-3 A free-born black man who joins the Riders in the second season. Emma Shannon (Melissa Leo) Season 1 The caretaker of the station and the riders. Though she can be just as tough as Teaspoon when the riders do wrong, she tries to be a mother to them all. She is in love with Marshal Cain, but because of her past, she hesitated to marry him until the end of the first season. Jesse James (Christopher Pettiet) Season 3 A young boy who joins the riders in the third season. Rachel Dunn (Clare Wren) Seasons 2-3 Rachel takes on the role of station caretaker after Emma leaves. =Guest stars= Many prominent actors guest-starred on the show, including Mitchell Ryan, Rob Estes, Chris Penn, Lloyd Bochner, Jay O.

In November 1989, it ranked 60th out of 84 programs for its time slot in the Nielsen ratings. In its second season, the series was given a new timeslot and made a dramatic turn around, winning its time slot five out of its first seven weeks, and consistently outperformed the other critically acclaimed shows on the night China Beach and Twin Peaks. Though still only ranked 57th in the Nielsen Ratings, it began building a \\"small, but loyal\\" following among teens and young adults. Diane Holloway of the Austin American-Statesman felt it offered a new take on the standard Western, and praised the series for its \\"beautiful\\" cinematography. The Philadelphia Inquirers Ken Tucker heavily criticized the series when it premiered considering it \\"one of the season's most pretentious bombs\\" and feeling \\"everything about [it] is overdone\\" including the acting. Considering it a rip off of the films Young Guns and The Long Riders, Tucker considered the series failed at period authenticity and thought the riders dressed no different from 1980s young adults. Writing for The Atlanta Journal, Phil Kloer agreed with Tucker, also calling the series a rip off of Young Guns. Kloer considered the pilot to be \\"not particularly good or bad\\", and felt the series was doomed to fail quickly. He did, however, praise the series cinematography as being \\"more like a film than a TV series, very beautiful with lots of soft light\\". Ron Miller of TV Weekly, however, praised the series when it was released. As it entered its second season, he renewed his praise, noting the more successful series was now \\"thumbing its nose at all the prognosticators\\" who had considered it unlikely to succeed. Home media MGM released the first season of The Young Riders as a single Region 1 DVD box set on March 21, 2006. The season 1 set was released to Region 2 (Europe) on January 15, 2007. TGG Direct released season 3 on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time on January 29, 2013. They also re-released the first season on the same day. Season 2 was released on October 22, 2013. However, due to clearance issues, the episodes \\"Born to Hang,\\" \\"Bad Company,\\" \\"Blood Money,\\" and \\"Littlest Cowboy\\" were excluded. Another Season 2 set was released in 2014. In addition to the four episodes excluded from the 2013 release, the 2014 set also excludes the episodes \\"Dead Ringer\\" and \\"The Play's the Thing\\".

Sieg was born in Marshalltown, Iowa. Sieg received his masters in physics in 1901 and his doctorate in philosophy in 1910 from the University of Iowa. Prior to his arrival at the University of Washington in 1934, he served as the Dean of the School of Education at the University of Pittsburgh. As university president, he oversaw the University of Washington during World War II. The war froze much of the school's physical expansion, but after the war the university launched a $31.5 million building binge to accommodate the influx of new students. Prior to Sieg's retirement, the university opened its school of dentistry in 1945. The medical school opened in October 1946. To the great credit of Sieg and his administration, the University of Washington was particularly responsive to the plight of its Nisei students during the months leading up to the internment of Japanese Americans. With the internment looming, Sieg took an active leadership role in advocating for the transfer of Nisei students to universities and colleges outside the West Coast to help them avoid the mass incarceration authorized by the signing of Executive Order 9066.

First appearing in The Eternals #9 (March 1977), and was created by Jack Kirby. Although physically a child, Sprite is an Eternal, a member of an ancient and extremely powerful immortal race. In 2019, it was announced that Lia McHugh would be playing a female Sprite in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, debuting in Eternals (2021). Publication history Sprite first appeared in The Eternals #9 (March 1977), and was created by Jack Kirby. Fictional character biography Sprite is an incorrigible trickster and practical joker, and has been for centuries. It is rumored that in Marvel continuity, he was the inspiration for William Shakespeare to write the character of Puck in A Midsummer Night's Dream. Reveling in what he sees as \\"playful\\" behavior, he is seemingly unmindful of the sometimes deadly consequences of their pranks, especially to fragile \\"mortal\\" Humans. Though punished time and again for their actions, he always returns to his preferred way of life after a while. During the Fourth Host of the Celestials, when Zuras calls for the Uni-Mind to examine the Celestials' Mothership, Sprite remains behind with Domo's Central Processor. There, he convinces the imprisoned Forgotten Eternal to help stop an attack to the Celestial ship. While trying to improve Olympia's systems, Sprite accidentally sends Olympia into the Negative Zone once, but the Eternals are able to restore it to its proper place. Sprite later advocates the appointment of the Black Knight as Sersi's Gann Josin (sharing a mental bond) as compromise with Ikaris, who wants her killed. =Eternals (2006)= In the new Eternals series by Neil Gaiman, Sprite, under the \\"real name\\" of Col√≠n, is the star of \\"It's Just So Sprite\\", a sitcom on the Tweenie Channel. Although he seems to be unaware of his past or abilities, he is also a spokesman for Hero Registration (as the series is set during the Civil War event). Ikaris, who seemed to be the only Eternal with any memory of their past, sees Sprite on television and informs Makkari that Sprite was another Eternal. Later, after Ikaris disappeared and the remaining Eternals started to recover their powers, Curry contacted Sprite, seeking advice. Sprite reveals that he has always known who he is and takes them to the Dreaming Celestial, their creator. There Sprite informs Curry that it was Sprite himself who made all the Eternals forget who they were, took away their powers, and removed all record of them from reality, as revenge for a million years of them treating him like a child - to the extent that they created him as the Eternal 'who would never grow up', trapped in the form of a prepubescent child. Using the Uni-Mind powered by the Dreaming Celestial, Sprite uses his powers to warp reality to his will, making himself a normal human, so that he can finally age. Sprite and Makkari are subsequently attacked by Deviants, but Sprite escapes. He is later seen in Issue 7, boarding a train to run away from the problems he caused that led to the awakening of the Dreaming Celestial, and was ultimately found by Zuras. Sprite has no apologies for causing the current situation, and, satisfied with the life he lived, allows Zuras to kill him by snapping his neck. Powers and abilities Sprite, like all Eternals, has total control over his body's life force and molecular structure, making him virtually immortal; in addition to not aging, he is immune to all known diseases and toxins, radiation, and extremes of temperature. His old Eternal body had the appearance of a pre- adolescent child (and against his will, according to him), but he is in fact hundreds of thousands of years old. Sprite is able to channel cosmic radiation into blasts of heat or force, levitate himself and others, and create illusions. He has superhuman strength, though because of his small size and childlike anatomy it is less than that of most Eternals. He is capable of rearranging atoms and molecules in such a way as to radically restructure objects (he once created a working ground-to-orbit spacecraft in seconds), and in fact is second only to Sersi in the art of molecular reconstruction. Sprite successfully used the reality-warping powers of the Dreaming Celestial to provide himself with a human body that would have aged to adulthood normally, if not for his demise.

Tilden High School, Abraham Lincoln High School, John Adams High School, Walton High School, Andrew Jackson High School, and Grover Cleveland High School were all built during the Great Depression from one set of blueprints, in order to save money. Bayside and Andrew Jackson HS were the final two schools to be completed. The design was based on Kirby Hall in Gretton, Northamptonshire, England. The schools were designed as small campuses to provide a \\"somewhat collegiate atmosphere\\". The design of Bayside High School and the other schools, created by architect Walter C. Martin, was considered to be \\"a modern adaptation of the Adams, Lincoln, and Tilden High Schools\\", which had all been completed by 1929. Bayside High School was also the first school building in the city to be constructed using Federal funds, built by the Public Works Administration from 1934 to 1936 at the cost of $2.5 million. Bayside opened its doors on March 16, 1936, taking in 2,300 students from Flushing High School.

They are commonly found between sections of buildings, bridges, sidewalks, railway tracks, piping systems, ships, and other structures. Building faces, concrete slabs, and pipelines expand and contract due to warming and cooling from seasonal variation, or due to other heat sources. Before expansion joint gaps were built into these structures, they would crack under the stress induced. Bridge expansion joints Bridge expansion joints are designed to allow for continuous traffic between structures while accommodating movement, shrinkage, and temperature variations on reinforced and prestressed concrete, composite, and steel structures. They stop the bridge from bending out of place in extreme conditions, and also allow enough vertical movement to permit bearing replacement Freyssinet: Bearing Replacement , Freyssinet Ltd. (retrieved 22 December 2011) without the need to dismantle the bridge expansion joint. There are various types, which can accommodate movement from {{co Modular expansion joints are used when the movements of a bridge exceed the capacity of a single gap joint or a finger type joint. A watertight system, invented by the Swiss company Mageba, is designed on a modular basis and can be tailored to satisfy the specific requirements of almost any structure.Freyssinet: CIPEC Bridge Expansion Joints , Freyssinet Ltd. (retrieved 21 December 2011)EMSEAL: BEJS Expansion Joint System, EMSEAL Joint Systems. (retrieved 8 August 2013)Britflex BEJ Expansion Joint, Universal Sealants UK Ltd. (retrieved 27 April 2015) Modular multiple-gap expansion joints can accommodate movements in every direction and rotations about every axis. They can be used for longitudinal movements of as little as 160 mm, or for very large movements of well over 3000 mm. The total movement of the bridge deck is divided among a number of individual gaps which are created by horizontal surface beams. The individual gaps are sealed by watertight elastomeric profiles, and surface beam movements are regulated by an elastic control system. The drainage of the joint is via the drainage system of the bridge deck. Certain joints feature so-called ‚Äúsinus plates‚Äù on their surface, which reduce noise from over- passing traffic by up to 80%.Modular expansion joint See also masonry control joints, which are sometimes used in bridge slabs.  Masonry  Clay bricks expand as they absorb heat and moisture. This places compression stress on the bricks and mortar, encouraging bulging or flaking. A joint replacing mortar with elastomeric sealant will absorb the compressive forces without damage. Concrete decking (most typically in sidewalks) can suffer similar horizontal issues, which is usually relieved by adding a wooden spacer between the slabs. The wooden expansion joint compresses as the concrete expands. Dry, rot- resistant cedar is typically used, with a row of nails sticking out that will embed into the concrete and hold the spacer in place. =Comparison to control joints= Saw cut control joints in concrete Control joints, or contraction joints, are sometimes confused with expansion joints, but have a different purpose and function. Concrete and asphalt have relatively weak tensile strength, and typically form random cracks as they age, shrink, and are exposed to environmental stresses (including stresses of thermal expansion and contraction). Control joints attempt to attenuate cracking by designating lines for stress relief. They are cut into pavement at regular intervals. Cracks tend to form along the cuts, rather than in random fashion elsewhere. This is primarily an aesthetic issue; the appearance of even, regular cracking, which may be hidden in the joint‚Äôs crevice, is often preferred over random cracking. Thus, expansion joints reduce cracks, including in the overall structure, while control joints manage cracks, primarily along the visual surface. Roadway control joints may be sealed with hot tar, cold sealant (such as silicone), or compression sealant (such as rubber or polymers based crossed linked foams).Expansion Joint Filler boards' properties/features and applications Mortar with a breakaway bond may be used to fill some control joints. Control joints must have adequate depth and not exceed maximum spacing for them to be effective. Typical specifications for a four-inch-thick slab are: * 25% depth of material * spacing at 24x to 36x of slab depth (some specification call for a maximum of 30x) * special care for inside corners Railway expansion joints An expansion joint on the Cornish Main Line, England If a railway track runs over a bridge which has expansion joints that move more than a few millimeters, the track must be able to compensate this longer expansion or contraction. On the other hand, the track must always provide a continuous surface for the wheels traveling over it. These conflicting requirements are served by special expansion joints, where two rails glide along each other at a very acute angle during expansion or contraction. They are typically seen near one or both ends of large steel bridges. Such an expansion joint looks somewhat like the tongue of a railroad switch, but with a different purpose and operation. Ducted air systems Expansion joints are required in large ducted air systems to allow fixed pieces of piping to be largely free of stress as thermal expansion occurs. Bends in elbows also can accommodate this. Expansion joints also isolate pieces of equipment such as fans from the rigid ductwork thereby reducing vibration to the ductwork as well as allowing the fan to ‚Äúgrow‚Äù as it comes up to the operating air system temperature without putting stress on the fan or the fixed portions of ductwork. An expansion joint is designed to allow deflection in the axial (compressive), lateral (shear), or angular (bending) deflections. Expansion joints can be non-metallic or metallic (often called bellows type). Non-metallic can be a single ply of rubberized material or a composite made of multiple layers of heat and erosion resistant flexible material. Typical layers are: outer cover to act a gas seal, a corrosion- resistant material such as Teflon, a layer of fiberglass to act as an insulator and to add durability, several layers of insulation to ensure that the heat transfer from the flue gas is reduced to the required temperature and an inside layer. A bellows is made up of a series of one or more convolutions of metal to allow the axial, lateral, or angular deflection. Pipe expansion joints Single sphere rubber bellows expansion joint, with flanges. Stainless steel pipe expansion joint, with control rods. Pipe expansion joints are necessary in systems that convey high temperature substances such as steam or exhaust gases, or to absorb movement and vibration. A typical joint is a bellows of metal (most commonly stainless steel), plastic (such as PTFE), fabric (such as glass fibre) or an elastomer such as rubber. A bellows is made up of a series of convolutions, with the shape of the convolution designed to withstand the internal pressures of the pipe, but flexible enough to accept axial, lateral, and angular deflections. Expansion joints are also designed for other criteria, such as noise absorption, anti-vibration, earthquake movement, and building settlement. Metal expansion joints have to be designed according to rules laid out by EJMA, for fabric expansion joints there are guidelines and a state-of-the-art description by the Quality Association for Fabric Expansion Joints. Pipe expansion joints are also known as \\"compensators\\", as they compensate for the thermal movement. =Pressure balanced expansion joints= Expansion joints are often included in industrial piping systems to accommodate movement due to thermal and mechanical changes in the system. When the process requires large changes in temperature, metal components change size. Expansion joints with metal bellows are designed to accommodate certain movements while minimizing the transfer of forces to sensitive components in the system. Pressure created by pumps or gravity is used to move fluids through the piping system. Fluids under pressure occupy the volume of their container. The unique concept of pressure balanced expansion joints is they are designed to maintain a constant volume by having balancing bellows compensate for volume changes in the bellows (line bellows) which is moved by the pipe. An early name for these devices was ‚Äúpressure- volumetric compensator‚Äù.Technical Bulletin: Pressure Balanced Expansion Joints, U.S. Bellows, Inc. (retrieved 31 August 2010) Manufacturing of rubber expansion joints =Wrapping fabric reinforced rubber sheets= Rubber expansion joints are mainly manufactured by manual wrapping of rubber sheets and fabric reinforced rubber sheets around a bellows-shaped product mandrel. Besides rubber and fabric, reinforced rubber and/or steel wires or metal rings are added for additional reinforcement. After the entire product is built up on the mandrel, it is covered with a winding of (nylon) peel ply to pressurize all layers together. Because of the labor-intensive production process, a large part of the production has moved to eastern Europe and Asian countries. =Molded rubber expansion joints= Some types of rubber expansion joints are made with a molding process. Typical joints that are molded are medium-sized expansion joints with bead rings, which are produced in large quantities. These rubber expansion joints are manufactured on a cylindrical mandrel, which is wrapped with bias cut fabric ply. At the end the bead rings are positioned and the end sections are folded inwards over the bead rings. This part is finally placed in a mold and molded into shape and vulcanized. This is a highly automated solution for large quantities of the same type of joint. =Automated winding of rubber expansion joints= New technology has been developed to wind rubber and reinforcement layers on the (cylindrical or bellows-shaped) mandrel automatically using industrial robots instead of manual wrapping. This is fast and accurate and provides repeatable high quality. Another aspect of using industrial robots for the production of rubber expansion joints is the possibility to apply an individual reinforcement layer instead of using pre-woven fabric. The fabric reinforcement is pre-woven and cut at the preferred bias angle. With individual reinforcement it is possible to add more or less fiber material at different sections of the product by changing the fiber angles over the length of the product.TANIQ: automated winding of rubber joints , TANIQ(retrieved 6 December 2010) Expansion joint accessories =Liners= Internal liners can be used to either protect the metallic bellows from erosion or reduce turbulence across the bellows. They must be used when purge connectors are included in the design. In order to provide enough clearance in the liner design, appropriate lateral and angular movements must be specified by the designer. When designing an expansion joint with combination ends, flow direction must be specified as well.U.S. Bellows Catalog: Internal Liner, U.S. Bellows, Inc. (retrieved 31 August 2010) =Covers= External covers or shrouds should be used to protect the internal bellows from being damaged. They also serve a purpose as insulation of the bellows. Covers can either be designed as removable or permanent accessories.U.S. Bellows Catalog: Protective Cover, U.S. Bellows, Inc. (retrieved 31 August 2010) =Particulate barriers/purge connectors= In systems that have a media with significant particulate content (i.e. flash or catalyst), a barrier of ceramic fiber can be utilized to prevent corrosion and restricted bellows flexibility resulting from the accumulation of the particulate. Purge connectors may also be utilized to perform this same function. Internal liners must also be included in the design if the expansion joint includes purge connectors or particulate barriers.U.S. Bellows Catalog: Purge Connector, U.S. Bellows, Inc. (retrieved 31 August 2010) =Limit rods= Limit rods may be used in an expansion joint design to limit the axial compression or expansion. They allow the expansion joint to move over a range according to where the nut stops are placed along the rods. Limit rods are used to prevent bellows over-extension while restraining the full pressure thrust of the system. Failure modes Expansion joint failure can occur for various reasons, but experience shows that failures falls into several distinct categories. This list includes, but is not limited to: shipping and handling damage, improper installation/insufficient protection, during/after installation, improper anchoring, guiding, and supporting of the system, anchor failure in service, corrosion, system over-pressure, excessive bellows deflection, torsion, bellows erosion, and particulate matter in bellows convolutions restricting proper movement.Typical Causes of Expansion Joint Failure U.S. Bellows, (retrieved February 2012) There are various actions that can be taken to prevent and minimize expansion joint failure. During installation, prevent any damage to the bellows by carefully following the instructions furnished by the manufacturer.Installation U.S. Bellows, (retrieved February 2012) After installation, carefully inspect the entire piping system to see if any damage occurred during installation, if the expansion joint is in the proper location, and if the expansion joint flow direction and positioning is correct.Post Installation Inspection Prior to System Pressure Test U.S. Bellows, (retrieved February 2012) Also, periodically inspect the expansion joint throughout the operating life of the system in order to check for external corrosion, loosening of threaded fasteners and deterioration of anchors, guides, and other hardware.Periodic In-Service Inspection U.S. Bellows, (retrieved February 2012)] Other expansion joint types Other types of expansion joints can include: fabric expansion joint, metal expansion joint (Pressure balanced expansion joints are a type of Metal expansion joints), toroidal expansion joint, gimbal expansion joint, universal expansion joint, in-line expansion joint, refractory lined expansion joint, hinged expansion joint, reinforced expansion joint and more.

Created during the 1926 Arkansas state highway numbering, the original alignment remains between Bradford and Pleasant Plains, though it has been revised and extended over the years. The three remaining segments are former county roads, connecting rural communities to local points of interest and other state highways. All three were added to the state highway system in 1973 during a period of system expansion. All segments are maintained by the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ArDOT). No segment of Highway 87 has been listed as part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. Higginson to Kensett Highway 87 (AR 87, Ark. 87, and Hwy. 87) is a north‚Äìsouth state highway in central White County. The highway straddles the border of the Arkansas Grand Prairie and the Arkansas Valley Hills ecoregions. =Route description= The highway begins in Higginson, a small rural city, at Highway 11 (Baker Street). It runs due northeast paralleling the Union Pacific Railway tracks through downtown, passing a city park before bridging Glade Creek. On the north side of the bridge, Highway 87 exits the community, continuing to parallel the railroad tracks through a sparsely populated agricultural area. The highway enters the small city of Kensett at the southeast corner, with state maintenance ending just across the city limits at an intersection with Central Avenue. The roadway continues northeast as Morris Avenue under city maintenance. The ArDOT maintains Highway 87 like all other parts of the state highway system. As a part of these responsibilities, the Department tracks the volume of traffic using its roads in surveys using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). ArDOT estimates the traffic level for a segment of roadway for any average day of the year in these surveys. As of 2017, the only location estimated was near the southern terminus in Higginson, with 440 vehicles per day (VPD). =Major intersections= =History= The highway was created by the Arkansas State Highway Commission on May 23, 1973 during a period of highway system expansion following the Arkansas General Assembly passing Act 9 of 1973. The act directed county judges and legislators to designate up to of county roads as state highways in each county. The alignment has remained unchanged since designation. Bradford to Concord Highway 87 (AR 87, Ark. 87, and Hwy. 87) is a north‚Äìsouth state highway in Northeast Arkansas. The route begins at US Highway 67 (US 67) in the floodplain and lowlands along the White River, and runs uphill through small towns and concurrent with US Highway 167 (US 167) to Concord in the Lower Boston Mountains. =Route description= Highway 87 begins at the eastern side of a diamond interchange with US Highway 67 (US 67) (Future Interstate 57 {I-57}) in northeastern White County, a sparsely populated rural area. It runs west across the Controlled-access highway before entering the small town of Bradford. In Bradford, the highway becomes Main Street, passing historic properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP): the Ward-Stout House, U.L. Hickmon Hardware Store, and the Dr. Lovell House. The highway crosses the Union Pacific Railway tracks in downtown Bradford just east of an intersection with Highway 367 (2nd Street). West of downtown, Highway 87 passes Bradford High School before exiting the city heading west. Highway 87 becomes a rural highway, passing farmsteads like the NRHP-listed Marshall Hickmon Homestead, and briefly entering Jackson County before returning to White County. Near Denmark, the highway intersects US 167, forming a concurrency heading north. US 167/AR 87 run together into Independence County to the small town of Pleasant Plains in the southern part of the county. Highway 87 turns from US 167 at a junction with Highway 157\\\\. Highway 157 and Highway 87 form a concurrency westward into Pleasant Plains for as Blackland Road before Highway 157 turns south as Batesville Boulevard, leaving Highway 87 to continue west as Floral Road. West of Pleasant Plains, Highway 87 passes through a rural area dotted with residences and passes through two unincorporated communities, Cedar Grove and Floral, before entering Cleburne County. In northeastern Cleburne County, Highway 87 passes through a sparsely populated area, and the community of Banner before entering Concord. The route terminates in the small town at Highway 25 (Heber Springs Road). =Major intersections= =History= Highway 87 between Bradford and Pleasant Plains was an original Arkansas state highway, created on April 1, 1926. On the September 1928 map, State Road 11 supplanted State Road 87 between Pleasant Plains and Denmark, with State Road 11 continuing due south from Denmark to Bald Knob on an \\"impassible road\\" (the present-day alignment of US 167). The remaining route was replaced by State Road 11 on the September 1929 map, with the route between Denmark and Bald Knob disappearing from the map. On the 1937 Official Highway Service Map, Highway 87 was redesignated along the \\"impassible road\\", now marked as \\"graded earth\\" in White County and \\"gravel or stone surfaced\\" in Jackson County. On the 1945 state highway map, the Highway 11 designation was assigned to the roadway between Denmark and Bald Knob, with Highway 87 running along its present alignment between Bradford and Denmark as a gravel road. The segment from Pleasant Plains to Concord was added on July 10, 1957, during a period of expansion in the state highway system. The Arkansas General Assembly passed the Act 148 of 1957, the Milum Road Act, creating of new state highways in each county. The highway was extended east from downtown Bradford to the present-day freeway alignment of US 67 on April 17, 1986. It was realigned around US 167 in 1998, including adopting a former segment of US 167 to connect to the new US 167 alignment. Mountain View to Fifty Six Highway 87 (AR 87, Ark. 87, and Hwy. 87) is a north‚Äìsouth state highway in Stone County, Arkansas. =Route description= Highway 87 southern terminus Mountain View is established in a small outcropping of the relatively flat Springfield Plateau, which quickly gives rise to the steeper Ozark Highlands as the route runs north. Highway 87 begins at Highway 66 (Main Street) in Mountain View, the small-town county seat of Stone County in the Ozark Mountains. It begins west of downtown Mountain View across the street from the historic Brewer's Mill and runs north as Lancaster Avenue before turning left. The highway passes the Stone County Fairgrounds and a city park before exiting the city northbound, entering a sparsely populated, forested area. Highway 87 winds and curves, crossing Sylamore Creek and entering the Ozark National Forest just north of the unincorporated community of Gayler. Shortly after entering the National Forest, Highway terminates at Highway 14, the Sylamore Scenic Byway, near the entrance to Blanchard Springs Caverns, a cave system owned by the United States Forest Service. ArDOT estimates average daily traffic on the route ranges from 1100 vehicles per day (VPD) near the southern terminus in Mountain Home, to 360 VPD near the northern terminus. =Major intersections= =History= The highway was designated on March 28, 1973 pursuant to Act 9 of 1973 by the Arkansas General Assembly. The act directed county judges and legislators to designate up to of county roads as state highways in each county. The alignment has not changed since designation. Elizabeth to Missouri Highway 87 (AR 87, Ark. 87, and Hwy. 87) is a north‚Äìsouth state highway in Fulton County, Arkansas. =Route description= First Highway 87 reassurance marker north of the US62/US 412 intersection Highway 87 begins at Elizabeth, an unincorporated community in western Fulton County. The southern terminus is an intersection with Elizabeth Road, a paved road continuing east toward Mitchell and Salem. The intersection also includes the eastern terminus of Boggy Point Cove, also paved, which runs southwest toward Norfork Lake. Both other roadways at the southern terminus are under the jurisdiction of the Fulton County Road Department. Highway 87 runs north from Elizabeth through a very sparsely populated area of the Central Plateau of the Ozark Highlands. The highway crosses Big Creek before an intersection with US 62/US 412 just west of Gepp. Continuing north, Highway 87 remains rural in character. The highway crosses Bennett's River near Vidette, and Poor Hollow Branch and Little Creek in the northwest corner of the county. Highway 87 also intersects Sparrow Road, the county road leading to the County Line School and Lodge, a historic school, Freemason lodge, and community building listed on the NRHP. North of the intersection, Highway 87 continues toward the Missouri state line, where it continues as Missouri Supplemental Route AR. The highway is a low traffic roadway. North of US 62/US 412, the route saw an average of 370 vehicles per day (VPD), with a count of 540 just south of the intersection. =Major intersections= =History= The route was created on May 23, 1973 by the Arkansas State Highway Commission pursuant to Act 9 of 1973 by the Arkansas General Assembly. The act directed county judges and legislators to designate up to 12 miles (19 km) of county roads as state highways in each county. The following year, the highway was extended to the Missouri state line to align with the proposed addition of Supplemental Route AR to the Missouri State Highway System..

Athol Morrison has served for 20 years, and heads back to Earth for a brief vacation. There, he runs into old friends, and finds it easy to give into his old feelings with his childhood girlfriend, Alexandra (Alix) Moreno. However, Alix and the rest of Athol‚Äôs friends are involved in a rebellion against Earth‚Äôs Master. They ask Athol to help and to join them, and so he helps to train them. However, concerned that any rebellion will provoke a genocidal response from the Masters, he betrays the rebellion to the local government, making sure that Alix and Davy Int√§ke are spared.

This group exists in Marvel's shared universe, known as the Marvel Universe. The team was created as a retcon to explain some events in the history of the Marvel Universe that were no longer plausible due to previous retcons. Their adventures are set during the late 1940s and 50's, a time when (in real life) Marvel/Atlas was mostly printing stories about strange monsters and alien invaders. Publication history The Monster Hunters first appeared in Marvel Universe #4 (September 1998) and consisted of Ulysses Bloodstone, Makkari the Eternal (who organized the group using the alias Hurricane), the psychic and mystic known as Doctor Druid, and Zawadi, a skilled huntress and warrior from Wakanda. They were later joined by Namora, cousin of the Sub-Mariner, in Marvel: The Lost Generation #2 (January 2001). Fictional team history When countless monsters began appearing around the world, suspicion turned to curiosity. Makkari, under the identities of Jake Curtiss and Mac Curry, encountered a monster of his own and then gathered Dr. Anthony Ludgate Druid and Ulysses Bloodstone when they too did the same. Bloodstone, while investigating where the alien Grottu had come from, was saved by Zawadi and decided to bring her along also.Marvel Universe #4 Their first meeting was at the Explorer's Club in New York City owned by Stanley Hathaway. This club would become the public front for the team. They identified themselves, and Druid revealed the origin of his powers. The group exchanged stories of their monster battles, and developed suspicions of one another, which they kept secret for the time being. Their meeting was cut short by a mysterious man waking a sleeping Gorgilla (a giant ape-like monster) on a boat in New York harbor. The battle with Gorgilla takes place in many areas of New York and finally ends at the Statue of Liberty with Dr. Druid calming the creature with telepathy. It is revealed during this time that Adam Clayton is the \\"real\\" name of Jake Curtiss, and that a \\"mystery man\\" was controlling Gorgilla. This was done to have Gorgilla divert a police escort of an African Premier to a bridge where a bomb was underneath, thus assassinating him.Marvel Universe #5 The Monster Hunters agree that Gorgilla should be taken back to the wild where he originated. While doing this, the team is attacked in their plane via an alien-looking craft. They are saved, though, with quick thinking from Clayton, who is now revealed to be the superhero Hurricane, sometimes called Mercury. When they arrive at Midnight Mountain in Borneo, they are again attacked by the Lizard Men, who succeed in capturing Hurricane.Marvel Universe #6 During the battle, Bloodstone's secrets and origin are revealed. The three remaining members of the team then go on a rescue mission to free Hurricane from the mystery villain that has caused all this. Battling monster after monster on an island in the Sea of Japan, the team finally rescues the now revealed Makkari from his nemesis, Kro of the Deviants, who had created most or all the monsters that they have encountered. After a fierce battle, the team causes Kro to retreat and they all escape the island heading toward Tokyo, their adventures only beginning.Marvel Universe #7 (NOTE: Harvey Elder (the future Mole Man) is also present in the storyline. It is because of his defiant nature and constantly being in a thorn in the side of the Monster Hunters that he is left behind at \\"Monster Island\\".Marvel Universe #4-7) In 1958, the Monster Hunters are joined by Namora. When Dr. Druid picked up strange psychic emissions coming from a warehouse it led the team into a direct conflict with heroes from the First Line. After the misunderstanding, the two teams battle a Skrull-created monster.Marvel: The Lost Generation #2 After this, not much is known about the further adventures of the Monster Hunters, who started drifting apart over time and eventually disbanded. Since then Bloodstone and Druid have died, while Zawadi disappeared. Until recently, Makkari was the only member of the original team that was still active.Marvel Monsters: From The Files Of Ulysses Bloodstone And The Monster Hunters This changed, though, when the Agents of Atlas found a coffin at the ocean's bottom containing a very alive Namora. She has since joined that team.Agents of Atlas #4 Notes References * External links * * Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone and the Monster Hunters, at the Marvel Database Project * The Monster Hunters at The UnOfficial Handbook of the Marvel: The Lost Generation Universe Category:Fictional organizations in Marvel Comics ","title":"Monster Hunters"},{"id":"5648365","text":"In sports, a prospect is any player whose rights are owned by a professional team, but who has yet to surpass a threshold where they achieve rookie status (as defined by their respective league), or is not established with the team yet. Prospects can sometimes be assigned to farm teams, or loaned to lower ranked teams. They may also decide to go back to college to play. Major-league professional sports teams also trade prospects, by themselves, with draft picks, or with current major-leaguers, in order to acquire another prospect or an established major league player. Teams that trade away several of their star players for other teams' prospects are sometimes said to be having a fire sale.

Cook murdered his family, including his father, step- mother, and five half-siblings at their home in Stettler, but was only charged for his father's murder, for which he was convicted and sentenced to death. Cook was executed in 1960, the last man to be executed by the province of Alberta.Alberta Law Source  Murders and execution  On 28 June 1959, police discovered Raymond Cook, his wife Daisy Cook and their 5 children shot and bludgeoned to death in the grease pit of their garage in Stettler, Alberta. Raymond Cook's son by his first marriage, Robert Cook, had been arrested in Stettler the day before and charged with obtaining goods under false pretenses, after he had traded the family's 1958 Chevrolet station wagon for a '59 Impala convertible. Robert was arrested for the murders, and despite being implicated in the deaths of all of his family members, was only charged with the murder of his father in order to speed up the trial process. At just after midnight on July 11, 1959, Cook escaped from the Ponoka Mental Institution he was detained in, for a psychiatric assessment, after he had been denied permission to attend the funerals of the family members he had killed, and was found several days later hiding at a pig farm near Bashaw, Alberta. It took two trials and just under 16 months for Cook to be convicted of murder, where he maintained his innocence up until his execution. While awaiting his execution at the Fort Saskatchewan Provincial Gaol, Robert authored a poem as part of a last-minute plea for clemency sent to the Solicitor General of Canada, and Prime Minister John G. Diefenbaker. > I sit here in my death cell, I know not why, For the evidence proved me > innocent, and that is no lie Seven members of my family, murdered to date, > The jury on a guess would make it number eight, Was it planned that way or > was it just fate.

While my > family's killer is on the loose.

Cook was sent to the gallows at the Fort Saskatchewan Provincial Gaol at midnight, November 14, 1960, and pronounced dead at 12:19AM on November 15, 1960.

Plot  The player takes the role of the manga hero Cobra, who after walking into a bar, learns that a bounty has been placed on his head by the Galaxy Patrol and that he is being hunted by a bounty hunter named Jane Royal. After it is discovered that Cobra's archenemy Crystal Boy is after a treasure hidden by Jane's father, the location of which he encoded in the form of tattoos on his triplet daughters, Cobra and Jane agree to join forces to locate her sisters and defeat Crystal Boy. Reception GamePro panned the game, comparing it unfavorably to Snatcher. They criticized the poorly illustrated story sequences and shortage of voice overs, and remarked, \\"Clues appear randomly and usually make no sense.\\" Next Generation reviewed the Sega CD version of the game, rating it one star out of five, and stated, \\"If you're much past puberty, it's pretty damn dull.\\" References  External links  * Category:1991 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Cobra (manga) Category:Hudson Soft games Category:Sega CD games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Single-player video games Category:TurboGrafx-CD games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"The Space Adventure (video game)"},{"id":"5648436","text":"Susquehanna Trail marker Older Susquehanna Trail marker The Susquehanna Trail was an auto trail in the United States linking Washington, D.C. with Niagara Falls, New York.

The duties of a meat cutter largely overlap those of the butcher, but butchers tend to specialize in pre-sale processing (reducing carcasses to primal cuts), whereas meat cutters further cut and process the primal cuts per individual customer request. The job title of \\"butcher\\" has been mostly replaced in corporate storefronts in the last two decades after customer trends showed that modern (particularly urban) customers increasingly associated the term with animal slaughter and unsanitary conditions (regardless of the condition of the store). With the advent of off-premises pre-packaged supermarket meat, many supermarkets now avoid mention of either cutting or butchering and simply call their meat cutters \\"Meat Department Associates\\" or similar. In the UK the term butcher is still used to describe a person, who offers for retail sale, meat ready for cooking by the customer. They will also prepare cuts, joints etc, for the customer. Most corporate retailers still use the term butcher for their meat department operatives Overview A meat cutter is responsible to prepare standard cuts of meat (including poultry and fish) to be sold in either a self-serve or specialty counter. In the UK the term used for retail meat cutter, is still butcher. Retail meat cutters are found in a customer- oriented, retail environment. This can be anything from a small family-owned meat shop to a large international supermarket chain. Meat cutters are a registered trade. Industrial meat cutters are found in production-oriented facilities, and generally perform fewer tasks, but repeatedly. The term \\"meat cutters\\" typically deal with \\"primal\\" cuts - segments of the carcass broken down into smaller (but still unfinished) pieces to make them easier to handle. Working conditions Retail meat cutters traditionally work indoors, in large, refrigerated rooms, with temperatures ranging between 2 and ‚Äì4 degrees Celsius. These environments are kept sanitary, and are washed every day with powerful antibacterial cleaners. In larger retail outlets or plant-facilities, working environments are generally equipped with power tools such as band saws and circular slicers. Meat cutters are also generally required to be in good physical shape; the duties of a meat cutter include standing for long periods of time, regularly lifting over 50 lbs, and working in cold conditions. Retail meat cutters also often have to deal with customers. Duties The duties of a retail meat cutter often include the trimming of primal cuts, making ground meat out of trimmings from the primal cuts, ensuring meat cuts are displayed in an eye-catching manner and are of sufficient quality, and serving customized orders to customers. Retail meat cutters are also responsible to keep their working areas clean, and ensure that proper sanitization procedures are followed.

The route crosses into Haskell County about three miles north of Quinton. The road continues north in Haskell County until it veers northeast and crosses Longtown Creek. The road then turns back north, passing through rural parts of the county. SH-71 intersects SH-9 in the unincorporated community of Enterprise, just over five miles (8 km) north of the Pittsburg‚ÄìHaskell county line.

The land was granted van der Donck by controversial Director General of New Netherlands Willem Kieft in 1646 in return for van der Donck's role as an interpreter and peacemaker in conflicts between Dutch colonists and Native Americans. It is unclear whether van der Donck subsequently purchased the land from its Native American holders, a requirement of the West India Company before granting a patroonship. Van der Donck's parcel began on the mainland directly to the north of the island (Manhattan), continued along the river for twelve miles, and carried eastward as far as the Bronx River, becoming much of what is today the Bronx and southwestern Westchester County. He named his estate Colen Donck (or \\"Colendonck\\"; spellings vary, the latter being more consistent with Dutch construction) and built several mills along what is now called the Saw Mill River.

It was first introduced briefly at the end of the second novel The Return of the Condor Heroes. It plays a significant role in the third novel The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber after Zhang Wuji discovers it and masters the skills in the book.Condor Trilogy: Jiu Yang Zhen Jing Origin The manual's origin is dubious, as opposed to that of its counterpart Nine Yin Manual. Rumours in Shaolin Sect say that the book was written by the Shaolin Sect's founder Bodhidharma as it was written amidst between the lines of the Lankavatara Sutra one of the many various Buddhist scriptures in the Shaolin library, but these claims have never been verified but the novel clearly mentioned clear speculation that the manual could have been written by a Chinese as Shaolin Sect founder was from India and Wudang Sect founder Zhang Sanfeng believed that the manual had connection to Taoism contradicting the common belief that it was of Buddhist origins. The Nine Yang Manual is also never published as a single book, in contrast to the Nine Yin Manual, which comes in two volumes. The manual's origin was later retconned in the new revised edition of The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber. In the past, Wang Chongyang lent Nine Yin Manual to his wise drinking buddy to study. Feeling Nine Yin Manual results in too much yin qi, he crafted the Nine Yang Manual after seeking refuge in Shaolin Sect. The Return of the Condor Heroes The manual's existence is not known to the jianghu until it was stolen by Yinkexi and Xiaoxiangzi at the end of The Return of the Condor Heroes. The Shaolin librarian Jueyuan monk and his young apprentice Zhang Junbao pursued the thieves to Mount Hua to retrieve the stolen book. They encountered the new Five Greats (Huang Yaoshi, Yang Guo, Guo Jing, Yideng and Zhou Botong), who were just departing from the summit after paying their respects to the late Hong Qigong and Ouyang Feng.9yin9yang Zhang Junbao defeated Yinkexi and Xiaoxiangzi with Yang Guo's help but had not found the missing book yet. In fact, Yinkexi had already hidden the manual in the abdomen of a white gorilla. He and Xiaoxiangzi later suspected that each other was intending to keep the manual for himself. They fought to seize possession of the book and ultimately Yinkexi killed Xiaoxiangzi but he was also fatally wounded and remained in a moribund state. Yinkexi met the Kunlun Sect founder He Zudao and made a dying confession to He, telling him to inform the Shaolin Sect where the manual is. He Zudao misheard \\"The manual is in the ape\\" as \\"The manual is in the oil\\" and passed on the wrong message to others. The mystery of the whereabouts of the manual baffled martial artists in the jianghu for nearly a century. He Zudao also disappeared mysteriously after being defeated by Jueyuan in a fight.The Jin Yong Phenomenon: Chinese Martial Arts Fiction and Modern Chinese ... - Google Books The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber =Jueyuan passes on his knowledge of the manual= Jueyuan is unable to recover the lost manual as the only people who know its whereabouts are either missing or dead and he returns to Shaolin Monastery after his futile attempt. However, Jueyuan had already read the entire text of the manual and had practised martial arts based on its principles before. He is unaware of the book's true value and cultivated strong inner energy from his practice. He imparts sections of the book he learnt to his apprentice Zhang Junbao. Zhang builds up a strong inner energy foundation, which later becomes useful when he proceeds to train in more advanced martial arts.ScholarBank@NUS: Terms of Use Three years later, a powerful martial artist travels to Shaolin to challenge the sect and no one is able to defeat him. Jueyuan takes up the challenge and he defeats the aggressor. The Shaolin monks are surprised when they see Jueyuan, who has been forbidden by the sect's rules to practise any form of martial arts, exhibit such powerful skills during the fight. According to Shaolin's regulations, Jueyuan must be put to death for violating the code. Zhang Junbao is also to be killed. Jueyuan expresses his willingness to accept the punishment and begs for Zhang's life to be spared but is denied.Wuxiapedia At the critical moment, Jueyuan breaks loose and escapes with his apprentice. They run into Guo Xiang at the foot of Mount Song. Guo Xiang defends them from the pursuing Shaolin monks and they engage in a fierce battle. The three of them decide to retreat as they are no match for the full force of Shaolin and also because they do not wish to develop feuds with Shaolin. Jueyuan carries Zhang and Guo to safety but he overexerts himself and coughs blood later. Jueyuan is on the verge of death and he recites the text of the Nine Yang Manual from memory amidst the Lanvakatara Sutra and passes on soon after he finished reciting. Guo Xiang, Zhang Junbao and Wuse (a senior Shaolin monk) As the three of them have significant differences in their levels of understanding of martial arts, and Zhang Junbao having learnt it straight from Jueyuan had learnt more than the latter, while Wuse came on sight later and so each individual's interpretations of the verses vary.36 Great Lessons From Jade Dragon Series The Shaolin, Wudang and Emei sects have their own versions of the Nine Yang Manual after Wuse, Zhang Junbao and Guo Xiang pass on their knowledge to their respective sects. As Guo has the best memory of the three of them, Emei's version is the longest. However, Shaolin's version is the most powerful because Wuse is superior to Guo and Zhang in martial arts prowess and he integrates the manual's skills with his own. As for Zhang, who spent the longest time with Jueyuan, he recalls the most original and purest version. The three simplified versions of the manual eventually become known as 'Shaolin Nine Yang Skill' (Â∞ëÊûó‰πùÈôΩÂäü), 'Wudang Nine Yang Skill' (Ê≠¶Áï∂‰πùÈôΩÂäü), and 'Emei Nine Yang Skill' (Â≥®Âµã‰πùÈôΩÂäü).Heaven Sword And Dragon Sabre - Television Tropes & Idioms =The manual's influence on various sects= Zhang Junbao and Guo Xiang incorporate various principles of the Nine Yang Manual into their own martial arts and become more powerful martial artists as they grow older. Zhang Junbao (later renamed to \\"Zhang Sanfeng\\") and Guo Xiang founded the Wudang and Emei sects respectively decades later. Their skills are passed on to their disciples and later become infused into their sects' martial arts. Wuse returns to Shaolin and passes on his knowledge of the manual to his fellows. The book's skills find their way into the martial arts of three of the leading sects in the wulin (martial artists' community).Heavenly Sword and Dragon Saber ‚Äì Episode 12  Ancient Chinese Series, Heaven Sword & Dragon Saber, Recaps Despite the common belief that the Nine Yang Manual has Buddhist origins, Zhang Sanfeng begins to doubt this claim as he delves further into the text. He notices that the principles and philosophy of the skills depicted in the manual are very much Taoist in nature. He also points out that the manual was written in Chinese instead of Sanskrit, the language that the manual's alleged creator Bodhidharma would have used. Zhang develops the Taiji Fist based on the principles in the book.Heavenly Sword and Dragon Saber 2009 ep 1 (2/4) - YouTube =Zhang Wuji finds the manual= No one had ever possessed the complete version of the Nine Yang Manual ever since it was stolen from Shaolin. Zhang Sanfeng, Guo Xiang and Wuse only grasped parts of the book from Jueyuan's incomplete recitation of the text. Zhang Wuji discovers the white gorilla by chance. He uses his medical knowledge to remove the book from the ape's abdomen, which was placed inside by Yinkexi after he stole it from Shaolin nearly a century ago. As Zhang had previously learned Wudang's simplified version of the manual, he is able to understand its content and spends five years mastering the skills in the book. He develops the Nine Yang Divine Skill (‰πùÈôΩÁ•ûÂäü) from his study and uses it to heal himself of his wounds caused by the Xuanming Elders' 'Xuanming Divine Palm'. Zhang later buries the manual, along with the books about medicine and toxicology (written by Hu Qingniu and Wang Nangu), in an unknown valley in the Kunlun Mountains. Zhang integrates his knowledge of the manual's skills with other martial arts he learnt and becomes a formidable martial artist.

Beefeater remained in the Burrough's family control until 1987. It is a 47% or 44% alcohol product (94 proof) in the US, and a 40% alcohol product (80 proof) elsewhere in the world (including the UK). The Beefeater distillery is one of 24 in London. The name refers to the Yeomen Warders who are the ceremonial guards of the Tower of London. Production This gin is distilled from \\"100% grain spirit\\". The manufacturer has been in business since 1863 and is currently located in Kennington, London. According to the Beefeater website, Beefeater Gin contains nine different botanicals: juniper, angelica root, angelica seeds, coriander seeds, liquorice, almonds, orris root, seville oranges, and lemon peel. Unique to Beefeater's production is the steeping of the peel of lemons and Seville oranges, whole juniper berries and other natural botanicals for a full 24 hours prior to distillation. This long process allows for a full extraction of flavour from the botanicals, capturing a wide range of volatile oils. The distillation itself takes around eight hours to complete, overseen by master distiller Desmond Payne ‚Äì with the spirit then taken to Scotland where it is blended and bottled at 40% ABV. 47% ABV is common in the USA. A super premium version of Beefeater was launched in Syon House on 30 October 2009. Beefeater '24' with its additional botanicals of Chinese Green tea and rare Japanese Sencha was the creation of master distiller Desmond Payne. Beefeater is exported to over 100 countries across the globe, with annual sales of over 2.3 million nine-litre cases. There are fewer than 10 employees at the Kennington Distillery in London. A classic G&T; should use a ratio of 3:1, says Beefeater Gin‚Äôs master distiller and global brand ambassador, Desmond Payne OBE: ‚ÄúThe measurements are up to you, but the ratio I use is 3:1. That‚Äôs three parts tonic, one part gin,‚Äù he says. History Beefeater's history can be traced back to 1862, when James Burrough, born 1835, bought the Cale Street-based Chelsea distillery from Rectifier & Compounder, John Taylor, for the sum of ¬£400 and started to produce his own distinctive style of gin by 1863. At first, the distillery continued with the production of liqueurs started by its previous owners, further establishing its reputation and extending its customer base. The 1876 company stock lists showed an increasing portfolio of gins with brand names such as Ye Old Chelsea and James Bourrough London Dry, as well as Old Tom styles. By spending time experimenting, inventing and using new processes he discovered that blending a particular recipe of botanicals produced a bold, full-flavoured gin, which he named Beefeater Gin. After the almost instant success of the gin, it was soon made the James Burrough Company's flagship product. The original Beefeater recipe book dated 1895, specifies that nine botanicals are essential (juniper, angelica root, angelica seeds, coriander seeds, liquorice, almonds, orris root, seville oranges and lemon peel) to create the full-bodied and robust flavour so distinct in this gin. =Lambeth= As the James Burrough's Company went into rapid expansion, there was a requirement to increase distilling capacity and in 1908 a new larger Beefeater distillery was built in Lambeth. =Kennington Distillery= The Beefeater production moved in 1958 to Kennington, London. English still manufacturer John Dore was commissioned to create a new larger set of copper stills mimicking those of the former Chelsea Distillery. In February, 2013, Pernod Ricard announced that the company would begin construction of a visitor centre at the existing Beefeater Distillery site. The method of steeping and distilling devised by James Burrough in the 1860s along with the secret recipe he created remains virtually unchanged.  Reviews  Typically considered a mid range gin, Beefeater's basic London Dry Gin has generally performed well at international spirit ratings competitions. The London Dry earned one double gold, two gold, two silver and two bronze medals from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition between 2006 and 2012. It received scores of 93 and 94 from the Beverage Testing Institute in 2005, 2008, and 2009. The higher-end \\"24\\" gin has also earned accolades, including a gold medal from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition in 2010 and silver medals in 2011 and 2012.

La Dolorosa premiered at the Teatro Apolo in Valencia on 23 May 1930 with text by J.J.Lorente. Before this, Serrano suffered the tragedy of losing a child and, in some moments, the work hinted at the grandeur that strengthened the pain. Plot summary =Act One= The first act introduces us to Rafael, a monk recently arrived at a convent where he seeks to create his work of art: a painting of La Dolorosa that brings him so many rich memories that even the convent's Prior and Brother Lucas begin to notice and doubt the spiritual serenity of their new brother. The convent‚Äôs orchard turns out to be an ideal place for the inspiration Rafael seeks. Perico, his helper, wants to learn to paint and begs Rafael to explain the painting to him; he consents, singing a painful love song. In the next scene, Perico is standing alone trying to copy his teacher. Nicasia arrives and declares her love openly. Perico does not want to lose the girl, nor fall under her spell, but her ends up yielding to his amorous desires. As they celebrate their love, the dance is interrupted by Bienvenido, the girl‚Äôs father, who forbids his daughter from entering a relationship. Jos√©, Perico‚Äôs father, tries to keep the peace, and everyone ends up acquiescing to the young couple‚Äôs desires. During the afternoon, Jose arrives at the convent asking for help for a woman who he found carrying a very small child in her arms. Upon seeing them, Perico recognizes in them the features of La Dolorosa that Rafael is painting. When he arrives later to administer medications, he learns from the woman that another man had loved her. =Act Two= The second act continues to follow the two couples. Nicasia and Perico are eagerly preparing for their wedding. Meanwhile, Rafael and Dolores find themselves alone with a free moment to explain themselves. Dolores, who had left Rafael for another man, has been left in turn and is living unhappily with the consequences of her choices. Rafael, for his part, is confused about his feelings toward Dolores and his spiritual obligations. The scene moves to the interior of the convent. It is the hour for matins and the prior is pondering Rafael's situation when he hears the song of a group of minstrels singing outside. Since Rafael still has not appeared in the chapel, the prior goes in search of him, and upon finding him, Rafael begs for confession and reveals his feelings: he doesn't want to leave Dolores alone in the world. The final scene is the joyous wedding of Nicasia and Perico. Rafael, having obtained permission from the prior to leave the convent and renounce his oaths, is with Dolores as the two reconciled lovers sing of their joy.

It refers to a traditional Buddhist meditation whereby thirty-one parts of the body are contemplated in a variety of ways. In addition to developing sati (mindfulness) and samƒÅdhi (concentration), this form of meditation is considered conducive to overcoming desire and lust. Along with cemetery contemplations, this type of meditation is one of the two meditations on \\"the foul\\"/unattractiveness (PƒÅli: asubha).Nanamoli (1998), p. 110, n. 16, which references the Anapanasati Sutta and the Visuddhimagga, Ch. VI, VIII. Translation Paikk≈´la (PƒÅli) literally means \\"against\\" (pai) \\"the slope\\" or \\"embankment\\" (k≈´la) and has been translated adjectivally as \\"averse, objectionable, contrary, disagreeable\\" and, in its nounal form, as \\"loathsomeness, impurity\\".See, e.g., Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-5), p. 393, entry for \\"Paikk≈´la\\" (retrieved 2008-02-02 at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi- bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:1052.pali). ManasikƒÅra (PƒÅli), derived from manasi (locative of mana thus, loosely, \\"in mind\\" or \\"in thought\\") and karoti (\\"to make\\" or \\"to bring into\\") and has been translated as \\"attention\\" or \\"pondering\\" or \\"fixed thought\\".See, e.g., Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-5), p. 521, entry \\"Mano & Mana(s)\\" (retrieved 2008-02-02 at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:3860.pali), and pp. 197-8, entry for \\"Karoti\\" (retrieved 2008-02-03 at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:367.pali). Similarly, the core Buddhist notion of yoniso manasikƒÅra has been translated as \\"careful attention\\". In contemporary translations, the compound term paikk≈´la-manasikƒÅra is generally translated as \\"reflections on repulsiveness\\" or, adding contextual clarity at the expense of literal accuracy, \\"reflections on repulsiveness of the body\\".See, e.g., Nyanasatta (1994); Soma (2003), pp. 3, 100; VRI (1996), pp. 10, 11. Alternate translations include \\"attention directed to repulsiveness\\"Buddhaghosa (1999), pp. 235 (Vism. VIII, 42), 236 (Vism. VIII, 43). On p. 243 (Vism. VIII, 80), Nanmoli uses a variant translation: \\"giving attention to repulsivenes\\". and \\"realisation of the impurity of the body\\".Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-5), p. 393, entry for \\"Paikk≈´la\\" (retrieved 2008-02-02 at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi- bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:1052.pali). Benefits This type of meditation is traditionally mentioned as an \\"antidote\\" to sensual passion.See, for instance, UdƒÅyi Sutta (AN 6.39) (SLTP, n.d.) where contemplation of the 31 body parts is said to \\"remove sensual passion\\" (kƒÅmarƒÅgassa pahƒÅnƒÅya). In addition, in Thanissaro (1994), \\"Translator's Introduction\\", Thanissaro states: \\"[Khuddakapatha] Passage 3 [which enumerates 32 body parts] gives preliminary guidance [to monastic novices] in the contemplation of the body, a meditation exercise designed to overcome lust.\\" This is also one of the \\"four protective meditations\\", along with anussati (recollection of the Buddha), mettƒÅ (benevolence) practice and recollection of death.Bodhi (2002), p.6. In individual discourses, this type of contemplation is identified as a contributor to a variety of mundane and transcendental goals. For instance, in the Girimananda Sutta (AN 10.60), Ananda's recitation of this and other contemplations immediately cures an ailing monk.Piyadassi (1997a). In the Sampasadaniya Sutta (DN 28), Ven. Sariputta declares that meditating on these 31 body parts leads to \\"the attainment of vision, in four ways\\", and briefly outlines how this method can be used as a springboard by which one \\"comes to know the unbroken stream of human consciousness that is not established either in this world or in the next\\".Walshe (1995), pp. 419-20. In addition, in the IddhipƒÅda-samyutta's Vibhanga Sutta (SN 51.20), this meditation subject is used to develop the four bases of power (iddhipƒÅda) by which one is able to achieve liberation from suffering.Bodhi (2000), pp. 1736-40; Thanissaro (1997b). While the Pali Canon invariably includes this form of contemplation in its various lists of mindfulness meditation techniques,E.g., see DN 22, MN 10, MN 119. the compendious fifth-century Visuddhimagga identifies this type of contemplation (along with anapanasati) as one of the few body-directed meditations particularly suited to the development of samƒÅdhi (Vism. VIII, 43).Buddhaghosa (1999), p. 235. That this form of meditation is particularly useful for what is known as \\"access concentration\\" is perhaps indirectly reflected in the comments of contemporary vipassana master S.N. Goenka who suggests that, unlike true vipassana, this type of contemplation deals with \\"imagination or intellectualisation\\". Goenka thus reserves its use for \\"some cases, when the mind is very dull or agitated\\" and thus the mind is unable to follow the breath or more refined sensations. He concludes: \\"Of course, when the actual practice of Vipassana starts, there should be no aversion towards this ugly body. It is just observed as it is - yathƒÅbh≈´ta. It is observed as body, with sensations arising and passing. The meditator is now on the path.\\" (Goenka, n.d.). Practice Internal organs viewed from front: lungs (grey), heart (white), liver (purple), stomach (yellow), large intestine (yellow) and small intestine (pink), from Gray's Anatomy. Internal organs viewed from back: spleen (green), kidneys (purple), right lower lung (purple) and pleura (blue), from Gray's Anatomy. In Buddhist scriptures, this practice involves mentally identifying 31 parts of the body, contemplated upon in various ways. =Objects of contemplation= This meditation involves meditating on 31 different body parts: :head hairs (Pali: kesƒÅ), body hairs (lomƒÅ), nails (nakhƒÅ), teeth (dantƒÅ), skin (taco), :flesh (masa), tendons (nahƒÅru), bones (ahi), bone marrow (ahimi√±ja), kidneys (vakka), :heart (hadaya), liver (yakana), pleura (kilomaka), spleen (pihaka), lungs (papphƒÅsa), :large intestines (anta), small intestines (antagu), undigested food (udariya), feces (karƒ´sa), :bile (pitta), phlegm (semha), pus (pubbo), blood (lohita), sweat (sedo), fat (medo), :tears (assu), skin-oil (vasƒÅ), saliva (kheo), mucus (si·πÖghƒÅnikƒÅ), fluid in the joints (lasikƒÅ), urine (mutta).English is from the Thanissaro (2000) translation of Mahasatipatthana Sutta (DN 22). Note that, in Thanissaro (1994), some words are translated differently, e.g., \\"muscle\\" instead of \\"flesh\\", and \\"lymph\\" instead of \\"pus\\". Also, Thanissaro (1994) translates vakka as \\"spleen\\" and pihaka as \\"kidney\\"; thus, compared to Thanissaro (2000), effectively inverting these anatomical objects in the English translations. The Pali is from La Trobe University (n.d.)'s SLTP version of DN 22, BJT page 446, at http://www.chaf.lib.latrobe.edu.au/dcd/tipitika.php?title=&record;=2612. These 31 body parts are grouped onto six lines consistent with their traditional representation in Pali as shown in MettaNet-Lanka (n.d.) Sinhala SLTP text at http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/5Khuddaka- Nikaya/01Khuddakapatha/01-Khuddakapatha-p1.html#Three and VRI (n.d.) Burmese CSCD text at http://www.tipitaka.org/romn/cscd/s0501m.mul2.xml. In a few discourses, these 31 body parts are contextualized within the framework of the mahƒÅbh≈´ta (the elements) so that the earth element is exemplified by the body parts from head hair to feces, and the water element is exemplified by bile through urine.See MN 28, MN 62 and MN 140. See below for more information regarding these discourses. A few other discourses preface contemplation of these 31 body parts in the following manner: \\"Herein ... a monk contemplates this body upward from the soles of the feet, downward from the top of the hair, enclosed in skin, as being full of many impurities.\\"Piyadassi (1999a) translation of AN 10.60. This preface can also be found, e.g., in SN 51.20 (Thanissaro, 1997b). The 31 identified body parts in pƒÅtik≈´lamanasikƒÅra contemplation are the same as the first 31 body parts identified in the \\"Dvattimsakara\\" (\\"32 Parts [of the Body]\\") verse (Khp. 3) regularly recited by monks.Piyadassi (1999b). This is consistent with on-line Sinhala SLTP texts. The on-line Burmese CSCD includes the brain after \\"feces\\" (karƒ´sa). The thirty-second body part identified in the latter verse is the brain (matthaluga).According to Hamilton (2001), pp. 23-4, in the Sutta Pitaka, the brain is added to the traditional list of 31 body parts only in the Khuddaka Nikaya and there only twice: in the aforementioned Khp. 3 and in Pais I.6. Hamilton also identifies a similar, abbreviated, differently ordered list that includes the brain in Sn 199 (see, e.g., Thanissaro, 1996); Hamilton attributes the differences between the traditional list of 31 or 32 body parts and the Sutta Nipata text to the latter being in verse. The Visuddhimagga suggests the enumeration of the 31 body parts implicitly includes the brain in ahimi√±ja, which is traditionally translated as \\"bone marrow\\".Buddhaghosa (1999), Vism. VIII, 44. Given Buddhaghosa's inclusion of the brain in ahimi√±ja could lead one to infer that this Pali term might refer to something other than bone marrow in some contexts (e.g., the nervous system). =Methods of contemplation= A canonical formulation of how to meditate on these is: :\\"Just as if a sack with openings at both ends were full of various kinds of grain ‚Äì wheat, rice, mung beans, kidney beans, sesame seeds, husked rice ‚Äì and a man with good eyesight, pouring it out, were to reflect, 'This is wheat. This is rice. These are mung beans. These are kidney beans. These are sesame seeds. This is husked rice'; in the same way, the monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up, from the crown of the head on down, surrounded by skin and full of various kinds of unclean things [as identified in the above enumeration of bodily organs and fluids]....\\"Thanissaro (1997c). In regards to this and other body-centered meditation objects, the Satipatthana Sutta (DN 22) provides the following additional context and expected results: According to the post-canonical Pali atthakatha (commentary) on the Satipatthana Sutta, one can develop \\"seven kinds of skill in study\\" regarding these meditation objects through: # repetition of the body parts verbally # repetition of the body parts mentally # discerning the body parts individually in terms of each one's color # discerning the body parts individually in terms of each one's shape # discerning if a body part is above or below the navel (or both) # discerning the body part's spatial location # spatially and functionally juxtaposing two body partsSoma (2003), pp. 101-2. The commentary mentioned here is the Papa√±casudani, attributed to Buddhaghosa and thus presumably written in the 5th century CE. This is similar to what is found in Vism. VIII, 48-60 (Buddhaghosa, 1999, pp. 237-9). Traditional sources The name for this type of meditation is found in the sectional titles used in the Mahasatipatthana Sutta (Dƒ´gha NikƒÅya 22) and the Satipatthana Sutta (MN 10), where the contemplation of the 32 body parts is entitled, Paikk≈´la-manasikƒÅra-pabba (which, word-for-word, can be translated as \\"repulsiveness-reflection-section\\"). Subsequently, in the post-canonical Visuddhimagga and other atthakatha works, paikk≈´lamanasikƒÅra is explicitly used when referring to this technique.Buddhaghosa (1999), pp. 235, 236, 243 (Vism. VIII, 42, 43 83). This form of meditation is mentioned in the following suttas in the PƒÅli Canon (listed in order of nikƒÅya and then sutta number within nikaya):These suttas were found in part through a search of the SLTP canon using a search engine from La Trobe University at .Three of these discourses ‚Äì MN 28, MN 62 and MN 140 ‚Äì mention the 31 bodily organs in the context of either four or five great elements (mahƒÅbh≈´ta), which, strictly speaking, in the (MahƒÅ)SatipahƒÅna Sutta is the basis for a separate meditation from pa·π≠ikk≈´la-manasikƒÅra contemplation. For example, based on commentarial statements, pa·π≠ikk≈´la-manasikƒÅra contemplation could entail spatial awareness of each of the bodily organs or fluids, and is traditionally used as an antidote to lust; on the other hand, contemplation on the elements emphasizes the tactile experiences of solidity, liquidity, heat and air, and serves as a basis for developing equanimity and insight into not-self (anatta) (e.g., see MN 28). * Mahasatipatthana Sutta (\\"The Great Frames of Reference\\", Dƒ´gha NikƒÅya 22)Thanissaro (2000). * Sampasadaniya Sutta (\\"Serene Faith\\", DN 28)Walshe (1995), pp. 417-25. * Satipatthana Sutta (\\"Frames of References\\", Majjhima Nikaya 10).Nyanasatta (1994). This discourse is virtually the same as the Mahasatipatthana Sutta (Thanissaro, 2000) except that the latter's extended exposition on the Four Noble Truths is absent from the Satipatthana Sutta. * Mahahattipadopama Sutta (\\"The Great Elephant Footprint Simile\\", MN 28)Thanissaro (2003). * Maharahulovada Sutta (\\"The Greater Exhortation to Rahula\\", MN 62)Thanissaro (2006). * Kayagatasati Sutta (\\"Mindfulness Immersed in the Body\\", MN 119) * Dhatu-vibhanga Sutta (\\"An Analysis of the Properties\\", MN 140)Thanissaro (1997a). * In the Sa·πÉyutta NikƒÅyas collection regarding the four bases of power (iddhipada), in a sutta called Vibhanga (\\"Analysis\\", Sa·πÉyutta NikƒÅya 51.20) * Udayi Sutta (\\"To Udayi\\", A·πÖguttara NikƒÅya 6.29)SLTP (n.d.). * Girimananda Sutta (\\"To Girimananda\\", AN 10.60)Piyadassi (1999a). Elsewhere in Pali literature, this type of meditation is discussed extensively in the post-canonical Visuddhimagga (Vism. VIII, 44-145).Buddhaghosa (1999), pp. 236-59. In several of these sources, this meditation is identified as one of a variety of meditations on the body along with, for instance, the mindfulness of breathing (see Anapanasati Sutta).E.g., DN 22, MN 10, MN 119, Vism.

His paintings are intimate and appealing, often with an element of fantasy, with simple outlines and accessible subject matter in two-dimensional stylised representations. He worked primarily in ink or pastel and watercolour. He also illustrated children's books and wrote short stories and verse. He has been the subject of a documentary by Mumbai All India Radio, and received numerous awards, including the Padma Shri in 1987 and the Maharashtra Gourav Puruskar in 1990.

Margaret Wilson (c. 1667 ‚Äì 11 May 1685) was a young Scottish Covenanter, from Wigtown in Scotland executed by drowning for refusing to swear an oath declaring James VII (James II of England) as head of the church. She died along with Margaret McLachlan. The two Margarets were known as the Wigtown Martyrs. Wilson became the more famous of the two because of her youth. As a teenager, her faith unto death became celebrated as part of the martyrology of Presbyterian churches. Background and arrest Millais' illustration of Wilson's martyrdom, published in Once A Week, July 1862 The Covenanter movement to maintain the reforms of the Scottish Reformation came to the fore with signing of the National Covenant of 1638 in opposition to royal control of the church, promoting Presbyterianism as a form of church government instead of an Episcopal polity governed by bishops appointed by the Crown. The dispute led to the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and the overthrow of the monarchy. With the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 the Covenants were declared treasonable and Episcopacy was restored. Particularly in the south- west of Scotland, ministers refused to submit. Barred from their churches, they held open air field assemblies called conventicles which the authorities suppressed using military force. Margaret Wilson was born at Glenvernoch, a farm near Newton Stewart in Wigtownshire. Her parents were dutiful Episcopalians, but her older brothers were Covenanters. By 1684 Covenanters were hiding from the authorities in the hills, and increasingly draconian action had ended the large conventicles. There were still small gatherings held indoors, but now failure to take a test of allegiance to the king, which required renouncing the Covenant, met with the death penalty, as did even attending a conventicle or harbouring Covenanters. Despite the risks, Margaret began attending conventicles with her younger brother Thomas, possibly beginning when there was an opportunity at a local conventicle to see the charismatic James Renwick who had newly become leader of the more extreme Covenanters known as the Cameronians. On occasion they also took along their young sister Agnes. In February 1685 the sixteen-year-old Thomas Wilson left to join other Covenanters in the hills. The girls went on a secret visit to Wigtown to visit friends, including an elderly widow Margaret McLachlan (there are various spellings of her second name). The young sisters Margaret and Agnes were taken prisoner, possibly after declining to drink the King's health, and put into the \\"thieves' hole\\". They refused to take the Abjuration Oath renouncing the Covenant. On the following Sunday Margaret McLachlan was arrested, and also put into the \\"thieves' hole\\" with the Wilson girls, along with a servant woman. They were taken before the \\"local assizes\\" of the Government Commissioners for Wigtownshire. On 13 April 1685 they were indicted as being guilty of the Rebellion of Bothwell Bridge, Aird's Moss, 20 Field Conventicles and 20 House Conventicles. The Assizes session took place and a guilty verdict was brought.A History of Dumfries and Galloway. by Sir Herbert Maxwell. p. 282. https://archive.org/stream/ahistorydumfrie00unkngoog#page/n302/mode/2up The three main protagonists were found guilty on all charges, and sentenced to be \\"tied to palisades fixed in the sand, within the floodmark of the sea, and there to stand till the flood o'erflowed them\\". Privy Council of Scotland The father of the girls, Gilbert Wilson, went to Edinburgh and made a plea to the Privy Council of Scotland for clemency for all three, presenting a petition which claimed that Margaret McLachlan had recanted. Agnes was granted freedom on a bond of 100 Pounds Scots, and \\"reprieves were written out for the two Margarets with a date of 30 April 1685\\". Reprieve and execution Martyrs' Grave, Wigtown parish church, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland The Martyrs' Grave, Wigtown parish church, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland A reprieve was granted for Margaret Wilson and Margaret McLachlan. It stated, \\"The Lords of his Majesties Privy Council doe hereby reprove the execution of the sentence of death pronounced by the Justices against Margret Wilson and Margret Lauchlison until the ..... day of ..... and discharges the magistrats of Edinburgh for putting of the said sentence to execution against them until the forsaid day; and recommends the saids Margret Wilson and Margret Lauchlison to the \\"Lords Secretaries of State\\" to interpose with his most sacred Majestie for his Royall remission to them.\\" Urging that Margaret Wilson and Margaret McLachlan were officially reprieved by the Privy Council of Scotland, Mark Napier insisted that its agents should not have dared flout the Council's decree.Sir Herbert Maxwell, A History of Dumfries and Galloway, p. 282. https://archive.org/stream/ahistorydumfrie00unkngoog#page/n302/mode/2up Grierson of Lag, brother-in-law of Queensberry, nevertheless chose to do so. G. F. Crosbie writes that \\"over-zeal was no crime in 1685 - the year when Lag received his baronetcy in the pitiless James's coronation honour's list.\\"G. F. Crosbie, \\"Sir Robert Redgauntlet\\", The Glasgow Herald, 1934, 6 January, p. 4. On 11 May 1685, 11 days after the signing of the reprieve, Margaret Wilson and Margaret McLachlan were chained to stakes on the Solway Firth. At the last moment, choking on the salt water, Margaret Wilson was allowed to offer a prayer for the King, which she did, but she continued to refuse to abjure the covenant. This was not good enough for her accusers, and she was forcibly thrust beneath the waves. It is said that, as the tide rose, she defiantly quoted from the psalms and the epistles and sang until she drowned. Robert Wodrow later wrote that the killers should have been prosecuted for ignoring the reprieve. About 18 years of age at the time of her death, Margaret Wilson was buried, together with her friend Margaret McLachlan, in the churchyard of Wigtown. Witness statements Approach to the Martyrs' Stake Kirkinner Kirk Session record Martyrs' Memorial Wigtown Twenty years after the date of the execution, Kirkinner and Penninghame Kirk Session prepared two accounts that drew on stories collected from individuals who claimed to have witnessed the events: McLachlan's daughter's own account about the drowning of her mother was employed,Kirkinner Session minutes, 1702-1714, Ms CH2/228/1, National Archive of Scotland and the records of the Penninghame Kirk Session included a statement referring toPenninghame Session minutes, 1696-1729, Ms CH2/1387/1, National Archive of Scotland Wilson's brother Thomas, that he \\"lives to certifie the truth of these things, with many others who knew them too weel.\\" The story of the Wigtown Martyrs was among those collected by Robert Wodrow and published in his History of the Sufferings of the Church of Scotland from the Restoration to the Revolution. The Church of Scotland synod had decided in the year of the attempted Jacobite invasion, 1708, to collect accounts of persecution under the Stuart monarchs, and commissioned Wodrow to take on the research. He wrote that Thomas Wilson \\"lives now in his father's room, and is ready to attest all I am writing.\\"Galloway and the Covenanters. p. 409 Wodrow's narrative. https://archive.org/stream/cu31924029476003#page/n411/mode/2up The account was published in 1721, and had a considerable effect on public perception despite being attacked by royalists and supporters of the Scottish Episcopal Church. Scottish lawyer and historian Mark Napier in his three-volume Memorials of Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee, 1859‚Äì62, included letters of Claverhouse and other documents not previously in print. Its publication led to a small storm of controversy about the supposed drowning of the \\"Wigtown Martyrs\\". Napier raised doubts as to whether the executions as depicted ever took place, and critiqued the writings of Robert Wodrow and his defenders. Napier replied in detail to his objectors in the Case for the Crown in re the Wigtown Martyrs proved to be Myths versus Wodrow and Lord Macaulay, Patrick the Pedlar and Principal Tulloch, 1863; and once more in History Rescued, in Reply to History Vindicated (by the Rev. Archibald Stewart), 1870. Art and literature The death of Margaret Wilson was depicted in 1862 by the Pre- Raphaelite artist John Everett Millais in an illustration (shown above) for the magazine Once A Week. The magazine also reproduced the verses describing her death which are inscribed on her grave in Wigtown. The story of Wilson's death is discussed in Josephine Tey's 1951 novel The Daughter of Time, in which a modern detective criticises versions of historical events created to serve political agendas. Following Mark Napier, Tey portrays the death of Wilson as a myth, referring to the existence of the reprieve, held by the Scottish Privy Council \\"to this day\\". She claims that \\"the original collector of the material, canvassing the Wigtown district only forty years after the supposed martyrdom and at the height of the Presbyterian triumph, complains that 'many deny that this happened'; and couldn't find any eyewitnesses at all\\".Tey, J. (2002), The Daughter of Time, Arrow Books Ltd, In fact, Robert Wodrow, the original collector of the material published in The History and Sufferings of the Church 36 years after the event, wrote that \\"our jacobites have the impudence, some of them to deny, and others to extenuate this matter of fact which can be fully evinced by many living witnesses.\\"Robert Wodrow, The History and Sufferings of the Church of Scotland, Book III, Chap. XI, pp. 248‚Äì9. Kirk Session records written out twenty years after the events provide detailed accounts compiled from the narratives of individuals who claimed to have witnessed the events.

The texts were most often written upon statuettes of bound foreigners, bowls, or blocks of clay or stone, which were subsequently destroyed. The ceremonial process of breaking the names and burying them was intended to be a sort of sympathetic magic that would affect the persons or entities named in the texts. The fragments were usually placed near tombs or ritual sites. This practice was most common during times of conflict with the Asiatic neighbors of Egypt.Edwards, Gadd, and Hammond (1971), p. 508 Historical periods of execration texts Execration texts are attested from the late Old Kingdom ( 2686‚Äì2160 BCE) up into the New Kingdom (c. 1550‚Äì1069). The earliest execration texts date to the 6th dynasty (24th‚Äì22nd century BCE) during Egypt's Old Kingdom. They are statuettes made from unbaked clay and fashioned into the shape of bound foreigners with name labels inscribed on their chests, sometimes in red ink.; and Christoffer Theis, Magie und Raum.

Over 400 of these statuettes were excavated from the cemetery at Giza, while a few others have been unearthed at the settlements of Elephantine and Balat. In the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055‚Äì1650), Egyptians continued to use statuettes as execration texts. For example, a group of both large and small figurines dating to the end of the 12th dynasty was excavated at the necropolis of Saqqara. Middle Kingdom Egyptians also began to use pottery vessels for execration texts, which is evidenced by an excavation of over 175 vessels outside the Egyptian fortress at Mirgissa in Lower Nubia. These vessels, dating to the middle of the 12th dynasty, were inscribed with lengthy execration texts and appear to have been deliberately broken, likely as part of the execration ritual. Only a few examples of execration texts dating to the Second Intermediate Period (c. 1700‚Äì1550) and New Kingdom (c. 1550‚Äì1069) have been found. Sites where execration texts were found Execration figurines from the Brussels Collection (Royal Museums of Art and History) There have been over 1,000 execration deposits found, with sites at Semna, Uronarti, Mirgissa, Elephantine, Thebes, Balat, Abydos, Helwan, Saqqara, and Giza.Muhlestein, Kerry. 2008, Execration Ritual. In Willeke Wendrich, Jacco Dieleman (eds.). UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology, Los Angeles. Because the execration jars, figurines, vases, and statues were almost destroyed during the rituals, archaeologists have to put all the pieces they find from execration pits back together to learn about the rituals. Four deposits have been uncovered at Giza, which contained figurines packed into pottery jars.Abu Bakr, Abdel Moneim, and J√ºrgen Osing, \\"√Ñchtungstexte aus dem Alten Reich\\", MDAIK 29, 1973, 97‚Äì133; Osing, \\"√Ñchtungstexte aus dem Alten Reich (II)\\", pp. 133‚Äì85; Hermann Junder, Giza VIII, Vienna: Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1947, pp. 30‚Äì38; and Stephan J.

At the Middle Kingdom fortress of Mirgissa, execration remains included 200 broken inscribed red vases, over 400 broken uninscribed red vases, nearly 350 mud figurines, four limestone figures, small traces of beeswax dyed red-probably the remnants of melted figurines, and one human-whose head was ritually severed.Ritner, Robert. 1993.

Two execration pits were found: one containing skulls and fingers while the other had two full male skeletons. Georges Posener published his findings from Saqqara in 1940, which later became known as the Brussels texts. Figurines there name over 60 enemy cities, people, and tribes.Amnon Ben-Tor. \\"Do the Execration texts Reflect an Accurate Picture of the Contemporary Settlement Map of Palestine?\\". Essays on Ancient Israel in Its Near Eastern Context: A tribute to Nadav Na'aman. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Edited by Yaira Amit. The execration ritual The execration ritual was the process by which one could thwart or eradicate one's enemies. Usually the ritual object(s) would be bound (usually a small figurine, but sometimes human sacrifice was practiced), then the object was smashed, stomped on, stabbed, cut, speared, spat on, locked in a box, burned, saturated in urine, and finally buried. But not every execration included all of the previous components. A full rite could use any of these actions numerous times with numerous figures. One recorded rite gave instructions to \\"spit on him four times ... trample on him with the left foot ... smite him with a spear ... slaughter him with a knife ... place him on the fire ... spit on him in the fire many times\\"Schott, Siegfried. 1929 Urkunden mythologischen Inhalts. Urkunden des aegyptischen Altertums 6, ed. Georg Steindorff. Leipzig: J. C. Hinrichs. Places mentioned The presence of foreign names of cities and tribes has long been a source for researchers to learn more about the dates and influence of these sites. The first two groups of execration texts published, the Berlin and Brussels texts, contain numerous mentions of Canaanite and Phoenician cities. The Berlin and Brussels texts date approximately from the end of the 20th century BCE to midway through the 18th century BCE. From an archaeological standpoint, these execration texts range from MB I to MB IIB. Archaeological remains from this period have not been found in all of the sites mentioned on Egyptian execration texts.Ben-Tor, Amnon (2006), pp. 63‚Äì87; see the last references and maps by Christoffer Theis, Magie und Raum.

Byblos was mentioned as the name of a tribe in execration texts, but not as a site.Ben-Tor, Amnon (2006), 68 Most scholars claim that the ≈†u-tu mentioned in execration texts and other Egyptian texts may refer to the land and people of Moab due to the text in Numbers 24:17 which refers to the \\"sons of Sheth\\" as the Moabites. However, it is also possible that the term ≈†u-tu may refer to all people living in eastern Palestine, an area ranging from Wadi al-Hassa to Nahr ez-Zerqa, instead of exclusively referring to Moab.Worschech (1997), pp. 229‚Äì230 The Kingdom of Kush in Nubia is also mentioned in execration texts. Research The execration texts are an important resource for researchers in the field of ancient Near Eastern history of the 20th‚Äì18th centuries BCE and Bible studies. The first group of execration texts were published by Kurt Sethe in 1926, known as the Berlin texts. Georges Posener published a second group of texts in 1957, known as the Brussels texts. The first collection are inscribed on pottery sherds, and contain the names of approximately 20 places in Canaan and Phoenicia, and over 30 rulers of the period. These texts contain what is possibly the first known mention of Jerusalem, from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE, the end of the 11th Dynasty to the 12th Dynasty. The second group of texts are inscribed on figurines of bound prisoners discovered in Saqqara. This group contains the names of 64 places, usually listing one or two rulers. Seven known Asian countries are listed. This group has been dated to the end of the 12th Dynasty. An additional group of texts, the Mirgissa texts, was published by Yvan Koenig in 1990. Historical interpretation The interpretation of historians as to the meaning of execration texts has been well established thanks to documents that detail the ritual creation of the texts and the manner in which they were to be destroyedFran√ßoise Dunand, Christiane Zivie- Coche, Gods and Men in Egypt: 3000 BCE To 395 CE, Cornell University Press, 2005, pg. 126 in order to invoke a form of magic to protect Egypt and the pharaoh, in earlier cases, but especially in the Ptolemaic period they began to be utilized by more and more Egyptians for their own personal use.Paul Allan Mirecki, Marvin W. Meyer, Magic and Ritual in the Ancient World, Brill 2002, Part 4, p. 440 Because many of the early execration texts are found on pottery, some historians believe that the ritual smashing of execration figures originated from the smashing of clay vessels used in funerary preparations so as to prevent their use for other purposes and to relinquish any magical power that may have resided in the vessel after having been used for funerary washings.Jacobus Van Dijk, The New Kingdom Necropolis of Memphis, Groningen, 1993, p. 185f Beyond Egyptian borders Execration texts deal with kings and cities who the Egyptians felt threatened by; some of whom lived in the Canaanite and Syrian lands. Execration texts including the Berlin, Brussels, and Migrissa groups contain curses targeting over 100 Syro- Palestinian kings and villages.(Egyptian Relations with Palestine in the Middle Kingdom James M. Weinstein Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 217 (Feb. 1975), pp. 1‚Äì16) Nubian kings such as Segersenti were mentioned in execration texts, as well as over 200 other Nubian kings.(Three Rulers in Nubia and the Early Middle Kingdom in Egypt Bruce Williams Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 72, No. 1 (April 2013), pp. 1‚Äì10) Biblical connections to execration texts: Egyptian sources are important when wanting to understand the history of Canaan. Their relationship with Egyptian pharaohs is brought to life by some execration texts.(Hebrew Books and Papers Israel Exploration Journal, Vol. 10, No. 3 (1960), pp. 184‚Äì189) Some execration texts refer to the people living on both sides of the Jordan River as su-tu. Scholars make a connection with the su-tu and the \\"sons of Sheth\\" or \\"bene- set\\", referred to in the book of Numbers 24:17 of the Bible: \\"I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.\\" ( b…ôn√™-≈†√™·πØ) It is widely accepted that the \\"sons of Sheth\\" are those who dwelt in Moab, or the Moabites, on the borders of the Hebrews' lands.(Egypt and Moab Udo Worschech The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 60, No. 4, The Archaeology of Moab (Dec., 1997), pp. 229‚Äì236) Dr. A. Bentzen in the 1950s advanced his thesis that the first and second chapters of the book of Amos in the Old Testament \\"is modelled on cultic patterns, resembling the ritual behind the Egyptian Execration Texts.\\" Many have taken this theory and interpreted it wrongly by saying there is evidence that Amos' speech is influenced by Egyptian execration texts. Bentzen is simply stating that the influences for Amos' speech resemble (are not influenced by) Egyptian execration texts. They are similar, but there is no connection. Other books of the Bible share this same similarity; Daniel 11:41; Isaiah 11:14; Jeremiah 48-49; Zephaniah 2:8-9; Ezekiel 25:1-14 and Nehemiah 13:1-2:23.(The Pattern of the 'Execration Texts' in the Prophetic Literature M.

Different versions of the show were seen in the U.S. and France because the satellite connection between the two countries kept cutting out, leaving each side to improvise to fill the gaps. At one point, a performer in New York attempted a \\"space yodel\\"; the host explained that his voice would be bounced back and forth over the satellite link to produce an echo, but no echoes were actually heard.

Development and test of the distributed HBV-96 hydrological model. Journal of Hydrology, 201, 272-288. It comprises the following routines: * Snow routine * Soil moisture routine * Response function * Routing routine The HBV model is a lumped conceptual catchment model that has relatively few model parameters and minimal forcing input requirement, usually the daily temperature and the daily precipitation. First the snow is calculated after defining a threshold melting temperature (TT usually 0 ¬∞C) and a parameter CMELT that reflects the equivalent melted snow for the difference of temperature. The result is divided into a liquid part that is the surface runoff and a second part that infiltrates. Second the soil moisture is calculated after defining an initial value and the field capacity (FC). Third calculation of the actual Evapotranspiration (ETPa), first by using an external model (ex: Penman) for finding the potential ETP and then fitting the result to the temperatures and the permanent wilting point(PWP) of the catchment in question. A parameter C which reflects the increase in the ETP with the differences in temperatures ( Actual Temperature and Monthly mean Temperature). The model consists of considering the catchment as 2 reservoirs (S1 and S2) connected together by a percolation flow, the inflow to the first reservoir is calculated as the surface runoff which is what remains from the initial precipitations after calculating the infiltration and the evapotranspiration. The outflow from the first reservoir is divided into two separate flows (Q1 and Q2) where Q1 represents the fast flow which is triggered after a certain threshold L to be defined by the user and Q2 the intermediate flow. A constant K1 is used to find the outflows as a function of the storage in S1. To consider the percolation rate a constant Kd is used as along as the storage is S1. The outflow from the second reservoir is considered to be the groundwater flow (Q3) function of a constant K2 and the storage in S2. The total flow generated from a certain rain event is the sum of the 3 flows. The result of the model are later compared to the actual measured flow values and Nasch parameter is used to calibrate the model by changing the different parameters. The model has in total 9 parameters : TT,Cmelt,FC,C,PWP,L,K1,K2,Kd ; For a good calibration of the model it is better to use Monte-Carlo simulation or the GLUE-Method to properly define the parameters and the uncertainty in the model. The model is fairly reliable but as usual the need of good input data is essential for good results. The sensitivity of the HBV model to parameter uncertainty was explored Abebe, N.A., F.L.

It extends inland almost to Mullewa. First collected and grown by early settler James Drummond in Western Australia, it was described by Swiss botanist Carl Meissner in 1855. In nature, B. sceptrum grows in deep yellow or pale red sand in tall shrubland, commonly on dunes, being found as a shrub to high, though often smaller in exposed areas. It is killed by fire and regenerates by seed, the woody follicles opening with fire. B. sceptrum is one of the most striking yellow-flowered banksias of all. Its tall bright yellow spikes, known as inflorescences, are terminal and well displayed. Flowering is in summer, mainly December and January, though flowers are occasionally seen at other times. Description Banksia sceptrum generally grows as a shrub up to high, pp. 208‚Äì09. though sometimes it reaches . It is many-branched and can reach in diameter. The stocky trunk has smooth or mildly tessellated pale grey bark. New growth has been recorded in spring and autumn, and may possibly occur over the summer. New branchlets are covered in fine greenish-brown fur and become smooth and pale grey after around two years. The leaves are roughly oblong-shaped with truncate or emarginate ends and measure long and wide. They are on long petioles. The flat leaf margins have short blunt teeth. The upper and lower surfaces of the leaf are covered in dense fur, but become smooth with age. The tall flower spikes, known as inflorescences, arise at the ends of vertical branches over November to January, and can be striking in appearance. They take 6‚Äì7 months to develop‚Äîlonger than other members of the genus. Between high and wide, they are bright yellow and highly prominent. Flower opening (anthesis) takes place over 1‚Äì2 weeks, and proceeds up the flower spike. The ageing flowers turn grey and remain on the spike as the woody oval follicles develop. The infructescence‚Äîan old spike bearing follicles‚Äîis bulky with a diameter. There are up to 50 follicles on each spike, each long, high and wide. When new they are covered with dense grey fur, which wears off exposed areas. The obovate (egg-shaped) seed is long and fairly flattened. It is composed of the obovate seed body (containing the embryonic plant), measuring long by wide, and a papery wing. One side, termed the outer surface, is brown and slightly wrinkled and the other is brown-black and sparkles slightly. The seeds are separated by a sturdy dark brown seed separator that is roughly the same shape as the seeds with a depression where the seed body sits adjacent to it in the follicle. The first pair of leaves produced by seedlings, known as cotyledons, are obovate and measure long by wide. The upper leaf margin of the wedge is crinkled. The auricle at the base of the cotyledon leaf is pointed and measures long. Taxonomy Swiss botanist Carl Meissner described Banksia sceptrum in 1855, based on a specimen collected by James Drummond north of the Hutt River sometime during 1850 or 1851. The species name sceptrum \\"sceptre\\" refers to the prominent flower spikes. In his 1856 arrangement of the genus, there were 58 described Banksia species. Meissner divided Brown's Banksia verae, which had been renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847, into four series based on leaf properties. He placed B. sceptrum in the series Quercinae. George Bentham published a thorough revision of Banksia in his landmark publication Flora Australiensis in 1870. In Bentham's arrangement, the number of recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined four sections based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters. Banksia sceptrum was placed in section Orthostylis. In his 1891 work Revisio Generum Plantarum, German botanist Otto Kuntze challenged the generic name Banksia L.f., on the grounds that the name Banksia had previously been published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B. sceptrum as Sirmuellera sceptrum. The challenge failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved in 1940. In his 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae), Australian botanist Alex George placed B. sceptrum in B. subg. Banksia because its inflorescence is a typical Banksia flower spike shape, in B. sect. Banksia because of its straight styles, and in B. ser. Banksia because of its robust inflorescence and hairy pistil that is prominently curved before anthesis. He added that its follicles resembled those of Banksia ornata, while the muricate seed body resembled those of B. speciosa and B. baxteri, though its obovate, crinkled cotyledons suggested an affinity with the series Cyrtostylis. Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published a new arrangement for the genus in 1996; their morphological cladistic analysis yielded a cladogram significantly different from George's arrangement. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement retained B. sceptrum in series Banksia, placing it in B. subser. Cratistylis along with eight other Western Australian species. It was placed as an early offshoot within the group. This arrangement stood until 1999, when George effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the Flora of Australia series. B. spectrum's placement within Banksia according to Flora of Australia is as follows: Growing as a gnarled shrub in exposed low shrubland in north of its range :Genus Banksia ::Subgenus Banksia :::Section Banksia ::::Series Banksia :::::B. serrata :::::B. aemula :::::B. ornata :::::B. baxteri :::::B. speciosa :::::B. menziesii :::::B. candolleana :::::B. sceptrum In 2002, a molecular study by Austin Mast showed Banksia sceptrum and B. ashbyi to be each other's closest relatives, the two lying in a larger group made up of the members of the subseries Cratistylis plus Banksia lindleyana. This was reinforced in a 2013 molecular study by Marcel Cardillo and colleagues using chloroplast DNA and combining it with earlier results. Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery published the results of their cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for Banksia in 2005. They inferred a phylogeny greatly different from the accepted taxonomic arrangement, including finding Banksia to be paraphyletic with respect to Dryandra. A new taxonomic arrangement was not published at the time, but early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring Dryandra to Banksia, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon- shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the autonym B. subg. Banksia. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete. In the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. sceptrum is placed in B. subg. Banksia. Distribution and habitat In bud, used in cut flower industry Banksia sceptrum is found from Hamelin Pool south to around east of Geraldton and near Mullewa and east to Wandana Nature Reserve. The annual rainfall is . The soils it grows on are deep yellow or pale red sands, often on dunes. It is also found on flat areas. Found in tall shrubland, it grows in association with B. ashbyi, mallee gums, sandplain cypress (Actinostrobus arenarius) and sandplain woody pear (Xylomelum angustifolium). Ecology Like many plants in Australia's southwest, Banksia sceptrum is adapted to an environment in which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Banksia sceptrum is a reseeder‚Äîkilled by bushfire and regenerating by seed. The follicles on the old flower spikes remain closed until burnt by fire, after which they open and release the seed. New plants take three to five years to flower again. If bushfires are too frequent‚Äîoccurring less than four years apart‚Äîthey risk eradicating local populations of reseeders. B. sceptrum has been shown to be highly susceptible to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, like many Western Australian banksias. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is unlikely to contract and may actually grow, depending on how effectively it migrates into newly habitable areas. Cultivation B. sceptrum is principally used in the cut flower industry, with the immature spikes being commonly sold in florists around Australia. It is occasionally grown in gardens as its bright flower spikes are prominent, but requires a Mediterranean (dry summer) climate and good drainage as it is sensitive to dieback. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 26 to 47 days to germinate. A dwarf form is in cultivation.

For example, a person from India is Indian. Indian is a proper adjective. These terms are inform only, and not generally used by grammarians or linguists.. Origin of the terms The term proper noun denotes a noun that, grammatically speaking, identifies a specific unique entity; for example, England is a proper noun, because it is a name for a specific country, whereas dog is not a proper noun; it is, rather, a common noun because it refers to any one member of a group of dog animals. In English orthography, most proper nouns are capitalized and most common nouns are not. As a result, the term proper noun has come to mean, in lay usage, a noun that is capitalized, and common noun to mean a noun that is not capitalized. Furthermore, English adjectives that derive from proper nouns are usually capitalized. This has led to the use of the terms proper adjective and common adjective, with meanings analogous to the lay meanings of proper noun and common noun. Proper adjectives are just capitalized adjectives. Description of proper adjectives In general, an adjective is capitalized if it means \\"pertaining to X\\" where X is some specific person, place, language, or organized group. Most capitalized adjectives derive from proper nouns; for example, the proper adjective American derives from the proper noun America. Sometimes, an adjective is capitalized because it designates an ethnic group with a shared culture, heritage, or ancestry. This usage asserts the existence of a unified group with common goals. For example, in Canadian government documents, Native and Aboriginal are capitalized. An adjective can lose its capitalization when it takes on new meanings, such as chauvinistic. In addition, over time, an adjective can lose its capitalization by convention, generally when the word has overshadowed its original reference, such as gargantuan, quixotic, titanic, or roman in the term roman numerals. Proper adverbs An adverb formed from a capitalized adjective is itself capitalized. For example: *We have regularly received enquiries regarding the availability of Islamic finance products, in particular Islamically compatible finance to purchase both residential and commercial properties. *There are people who express themselves 'Germanly,' while others have forms of life that are expressed 'Frenchly', 'Koreanly' or 'Icelandicly'.Margalit, A., 1997, \\"The Moral Psychology of Nationalism,\\" in McKim and McMahan (eds.), 1997, The Morality of Nationalism Oxford University Press: Oxford, as quoted by Other parts of speech Verbs such as Canadianize are written with a capital letter, though not generally described as proper verbs.

Conchubor, the aging High King of Ulster, has charged Lavarcham to raise the child Deirdre to be his queen when she comes of age. Lavarcham finds that the now-beautiful Deirdre is a willful young woman, without interest in marrying an old man. Conchubor comes to Slieve Fuadh to bring Deirdre to his palace, Emain Macha, ignoring her pleas to remain in the countryside for another year. After he leaves, Naoise, son of Usna, and his brothers come to the cottage seeking Deirdre, and she tells them of her summons. Deirdre is aware of a prophecy that she will be the doom of the sons of Usna; nonetheless she asks Naoise to take her away from Ulster. He agrees, and Ainnle weds them in an impromptu ceremony. Act II: Alban. Deirdre and the sons of Usna have lived happily on a remote island for seven years. Fergus arrives bearing an offer of peace from Conchubor, and asks Deirdre and Naoise to return with him to Emain Macha. Lavarcham warns Deirdre not to accept, and Owen, a spy in the service of Conchubor, intimidates Deirdre with suggestions that death awaits Naoise in Ulster. Naoise tells Fergus that he plans to live the rest of his life with Deirdre in Alban, but Deirdre convinces him to accept Conchubor's offer, reasoning that it is better to die young, at the peak of their love, than to grow old and live in the shadow of their past happiness. Act III: A tent near Emain. Lavarcham arrives at Conchubor's tent and tries to convince him to give up his pursuit of Deirdre, claiming that she has grown old and lost her beauty. His soldiers arrive and contradict her claims, and he leaves just before Deirdre and Naoise enter. They discuss the possibility of their impending deaths until Conchubor returns. Deirdre nearly convinces him to put aside past grievances and let them live in peace when the sound of a battle between Conchubor's men and Naoise's brothers reaches them. Conchubor and Naoise go to join the fray and Naoise is killed. Fergus and his men arrive, enraged by the king's treachery, and set Emain Macha ablaze. Lavarcham tries to convince Deirdre to flee Ulster, and Conchubor tries to take her to a different castle, but she stays and mourns her dead lover and his brothers. In the end, Deirdre takes Naoise's dagger, stabs herself, and falls into his open grave, leaving Conchubor with nothing.

However, due to the dominance of the Meads brothers (Colin and Stan) and stiff competition from Sam Strahan of Manawatu, Smith couldn't get a look-in for the test matches. In 1968 Smith was omitted from the All Black team which toured Australia and played France at home, but after a good 1969 trial, and stellar performance leading Taranaki to a 9‚Äì9 draw with Wales, Smith was recalled in favour of Strahan. He made his test debut against Wales on 31 May 1969, in Christchurch, and went on to play the second test as well, both of which the All Blacks won resoundingly. Smith played the first test match of the All Black tour of South Africa in 1970, but missed out on selection for the remaining matches. He played four more games while in South Africa, but these proved to be his last for the All Blacks. In four years Smith played 18 matches for the All Blacks, 3 of which were test matches. He scored 1 try against South African Country in East London. Smith's 1971 season was plagued by injury, but he managed an appearance for Taranaki against the touring British Lions. This was his last match for Taranaki, retiring after 9 years and 82 games for the \\"Amber & Blacks\\". As well as being a top-level rugby player Smith excelled in cricket. After retiring from rugby he focused on his pace bowling and played for the Taranaki cricket team in the late 1970s. Apart from sport, Smith has carried on the management of the family farm in Douglas where he lives with his wife Christine.

Early life and education  Haley was the son of noted surfing pioneer Jack Haley, Sr. A 6'10\\" forward/center from Huntington Beach High School and UCLA, Haley spent nine seasons (1988-1992; 1993-1998) in the National Basketball Association as a member of the Chicago Bulls, New Jersey Nets, Los Angeles Lakers, and San Antonio Spurs.  Chicago Bulls tenure  Haley was drafted in 1987 by the Chicago Bulls and made his NBA debut on November 9, 1988. After several years playing elsewhere, Haley returned to the Bulls as a free agent in October 1995 and was a member of the 1995‚Äì96 Bulls team that won a league record 72 games and the NBA Championship. However, Haley spent almost the entire season on the injured list with tendinitis in his left knee. As a result, he only played in one game during the regular season and did not participate in the playoffs. At one point, another unidentified team complained to the league office, which sent out a doctor to examine Haley's knee. At the same time, Haley developed a reputation for his enthusiastic cheering of his teammates on the Bulls' bench all season long, compared to what one newspaper described as a more somber Bulls' bench. On Sunday, April 21, 1996, Haley played in the Bulls' final regular-season game, drawing what the Chicago Tribune called \\"polite‚Äîalbeit sarcastic‚Äîreception from the crowd.\\" Haley ended up with five points. \\"It felt good to finally get in a game,\\" he told the paper. \\"I was real excited and my adrenaline was pumping. I haven't played in a year. I missed some easy shots. I guess I was aggressive. I took almost a shot per minute played.\\" Haley was mainly known for his friendship with Dennis Rodman, and was sometimes referred to as Rodman's \\"babysitter\\". However, Haley bristled at the label, and argued that he had legitimately earned his spot on the team.  Post-playing career  Following his playing career, Haley served as an assistant coach for the New Jersey Nets and as a television broadcaster for the Lakers, co-hosting the Lakers Live pre-game show with Bill Macdonald for Fox Sports Net West/Prime Ticket. Haley also acted, appearing in the films Eddie and Rebound, as well as the music video for Aerosmith's \\"Love in an Elevator.\\"  Death  Haley died on March 16, 2015, of heart disease at age 51. On April 16, 2015, a memorial service at the Walter Pyramid in Long Beach was attended by family and friends, including notable NBA players and coaches.

She works in many media, including gouache, oil, ceramic and weaving. Her works usually have women as their subject, and many of her paintings have a fantastical element that still comments on the female condition. Her early works were more realistic, but over time she has moved to simpler, more stylized paintings that have considerable impact. She has a diploma in painting from the College of Art in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. Over the years she has had nearly 30 solo shows and won a number of awards including the National Award of the Lalit Kala Akademi. She also participated in a large number of group shows both in India and overseas: Yugoslavia, Germany, France, Cuba and Japan among others. Education For two years, she studied at the College of Art in Banasthali, Rajasthan from 1961-1962 and then studied at the Government College of Arts and Crafts in Lucknow for a full 5 year graduate course. She chose painting as the main subject in the rigors of academic realism. She also did a full graduate course of art in College of Art in Delhi in 1968. She knew what she wanted and was willing to work hard as much as required so she didn't pay much heed to the people who were scoffing at the amount of time she had spent in studying. She realized early in life that she wanted to become an artist. Her uncle being a famous writer she was exposed to the literary world and the arts. Her family was skeptical about her becoming an artist as in that era there were very few artists and almost no female artists. She knew that to become an artist, she would have to enroll in an art school. Personal life She married a fellow artist and friend Ved Nayar who is a sculptor. In Delhi, she was working as a freelance artist and also taught at art institutions. She suffered from various forms of illnesses, including getting her hip joint replaced. The replacement left her incapacitated as the muscles couldn't cope the replacement for a long time, leaving her in excruciating pain. In an interview she said that it was her art which helped her get through the pain and the difficult time.  Commentary on her style  According to the authors in the book- 'Gogi Saroj Pal: the feminine unbound', Gogi's women appeared to be feminine, sensuous, coquettish but they could equally be bovine, obdurate and slovenly. There was an element of dressing up but not with ornamentation or apparel. The nudity of her feminine figures, 'Nayikas' was fiercely commented on and debated over- was it part of the country's spiritual tradition or was she continuing to be the quintessential rebel? Gogi herself gave no explanations as the work speaks for itself. She is most interested in exploring how myth influences and reflects society. Art critic Richard Bartholomew would see in them 'lonely people'. In 1990, in an art catalogue, Art writer Shamim Hanfi described her work as having a 'quiet restlessness' that creates 'a feeling of unexpressed sadness'. In the initial stages of her experimentation with her work and her early works in lithography in 1979, Bartholomew would sense the solitariness of her 'faces, portraits, images, children with legs crossed, arms folded, recumbent figures, groups of people staring quietly, privately, personally into some past or future' Of specific interest are 'the suggestive eyes and delicate mouth, the posture, the placement of the hand, the unselfconscious attitude- 'all create a sense of intimacy', a trait that would mark her entire career as an artist. Her work suggested two things to Bartholomew, firstly, that 'humanity is life in Gogi's work; and life is an assortment of human beings, and life is thought', which was prescient of the manner in which she would continue to develop, and second, that hers is a 'poignant world of real people but the reality of the world and of the personae has been made an abstract principle'.  Artworks  = Being Women = According to Seema Bawa : Gogi Saroj Pal‚Äôs Being a Woman series focus on her concern of the place women have in society. In this evocative painting, the women has been rendered in a likeness of Christ‚Äôs crucifixion, but without a cross. The outstretched hands, the slight slumping of the head and the way in which the legs seems pinned together are reminiscent of Christ‚Äôs torment. ‚ÄòThere is so much celebration of pain, we are reminded of how much he suffered on our account.‚Äô the artist says, ‚Äòbut what of the anguish of women.‚Äô Gogi Saroj pal finds it ironic that people shed tears on Christ‚Äôs suffering, but are unmoved by our overlook of sorrows of the women in their own surroundings- weather mother, sister, wife, partner, friend or daughter. This painted sisterhood of grief gives this work a powerful poignancy.

He is known as one of the pioneers of crowdsourcing. He is the founder of the company reCAPTCHA, which was sold to Google in 2009, and the co-founder and CEO of Duolingo, the world's most popular language-learning platform.  Biography  Luis von Ahn was born in and grew up in Guatemala City. Von Ahn grew up in an upper-middle class household with both of his parents working as physicians. He attended a private English language school in Guatemala City, an experience he cites as a great privilege. When von Ahn was eight years old, his mother bought him a Commodore 64 computer, beginning his fascination with technology and computer science. He is of German Guatemalan descent. At age 18, von Ahn began studying at Duke University, where he would go on to receive a BS in Mathematics (summa cum laude) in 2000. He later earned his PhD in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University in 2005.https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/LuisvonAhn_CV.pdf In 2006, Von Ahn became a faculty member at the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. Work Von Ahn's early research was in the field of cryptography. With Nicholas J. Hopper and John Langford, he was the first to provide rigorous definitions of steganography and to prove that private-key steganography is possible. In 2000, he did early pioneering work with Manuel Blum on CAPTCHAs,Von Ahn, Luis; Blum, Manuel; Hopper, Nicholas J.; Langford, John (May 2003). \\"CAPTCHA: Using Hard AI Problems for Security\\". Proceedings of the International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques (EUROCRYPT 2003). computer-generated tests that humans are routinely able to pass but that computers have not yet mastered. These devices are used by web sites to prevent automated programs, or bots, from perpetrating large-scale abuse, such as automatically registering for large numbers of accounts or purchasing huge numbers of tickets for resale by scalpers. CAPTCHAs brought von Ahn his first widespread fame among the general public due to their coverage in the New York Times and USA Today and on the Discovery Channel, NOVA scienceNOW, and other mainstream outlets. Von Ahn's Ph.D. thesis, completed in 2005, was the first publication to use the term \\"human computation\\" that he had coined, referring to methods that combine human brainpower with computers to solve problems that neither could solve alone. Von Ahn's Ph.D. thesis is also the first work on Games With A Purpose, or GWAPs, which are games played by humans that produce useful computation as a side effect. The most famous example is the ESP Game, an online game in which two randomly paired people are simultaneously shown the same picture, with no way to communicate. Each then lists a number of words or phrases that describe the picture within a time limit, and are rewarded with points for a match. This match turns out to be an accurate description of the picture, and can be successfully used in a database for more accurate image search technology. The ESP Game was licensed by Google in the form of the Google Image Labeler, and is used to improve the accuracy of the Google Image Search. Von Ahn's games brought him further coverage in the mainstream media. His thesis won the Best Doctoral Dissertation Award from Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science. In July 2006, von Ahn gave a tech talk at Google on \\"Human Computation\\" (i.e., crowdsourcing) which was watched by over one million viewers.Google Tech Talk on human computation by Luis von Ahn. youtube.com (2006-07-26). Retrieved on 2015-06-12. In 2007, von Ahn invented reCAPTCHA, a new form of CAPTCHA that also helps digitize books. In reCAPTCHA, the images of words displayed to the user come directly from old books that are being digitized; they are words that optical character recognition could not identify and are sent to people throughout the web to be identified. ReCAPTCHA is currently in use by over 100,000 web sites and is transcribing over 40 million words per day. In 2009, von Ahn and his graduate student Severin Hacker began to develop Duolingo, a language education platform. They founded a company of the same name, with von Ahn as chief executive officer and Hacker as chief technology officer. In November 2011, a private beta test of Duolingo was launched and the app was released to the public in June 2012. Awards His research on CAPTCHAs and human computation has earned him international recognition and numerous honors. He was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2006, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation Fellowship in 2009, a Sloan Fellowship in 2009, and a Microsoft New Faculty Fellowship in 2007, and the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2012.

Biography  He was born at Pescia, now in the Province of Pistoia, Italy. He was related to the Piccolomini of Siena. He acquired his literary and theological education in Florence. Under Pope Nicholas V he went to Rome, where, for a while, he lived in extreme penury. In 1450, he became private secretary to Cardinal Domenico Capranica; later Pope Callixtus III appointed him Secretary of Briefs. He was retained in this office by Pope Pius II, who also made him a member of the pontifical household, on which occasion he assumed the family name of Piccolomini. In 1460 he was made Bishop of Pavia by Pius II, and was Pius's most trusted confidant and adviser throughout his pontificate. Ammannati exhibited paternal solicitude in the government of his diocese, and during his prolonged absences entrusted its affairs to able vicars, with whom he remained in constant touch. On 18 December 1461, Ammannati was made a cardinal, and was commonly known as the Cardinal of Pavia. He accompanied Pius II to Ancona and attended him in his last illness. In the subsequent conclave he favored the election of Pope Paul II, whose displeasure he afterward incurred by insisting on the full observance of the ante-election capitulations that the pope had signed. The imprisonment of his private secretary by Paul II on a charge of complicity in the Conspiracy of the Roman Academy offended Ammannati still more, and his open defense of the secretary aggravated the pope's ill-will. The disfavor in which he was held by Paul II did not exempt his episcopal revenues from sequestration by the Duke of Milan, Galeazzo Maria. It was due to his insistence that Paul II took energetic measures against King George Podiebrad of Bohemia. Pope Sixtus IV was scarcely more favorable towards Ammannati than was Paul II. In 1470, he was transferred to the bishopric of Lucca and was named papal envoy to Umbria. Ammannati was the friend of students and scholars, and protected Jacopo de Volterra. He enjoyed the friendship of noted prelates and humanists, such as Cardinal Carvajal and Cardinal Bartolomeo Roverella. Cardinal Bessarion (Pastor, Geschichte der P√§pste, II, 731), praises his executive ability and readiness, charity and zeal. He wrote a continuation in seven books of Pius II's Commentarii. His style is elegant, but he is not always impartial, especially apropos of Pope Paul II or Pope Sixtus IV. His Commentaries, nevertheless, remain an important source for contemporary history; and his valuable letters have been collected and published. Ammannati died from malaria at San Lorenzo alle Grotte near Bolsena.

It was the first digital subscriber line (DSL) technology to use a higher frequency spectrum over copper, twisted pair cables. HDSL was developed to transport DS1 services at 1.544 Mbit/s and 2.048 Mbit/s over telephone local loops without a need for repeaters. Successor technology to HDSL includes HDSL2 and HDSL4, proprietary SDSL, and G.SHDSL.  Standardization  HDSL was developed for T1 service at 1.544 Mbit/s by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Committee T1E1.4 and published in February 1994 as ANSI Technical Report TR-28. This American variant uses two wire pairs with at a rate of 784 kbit/s each, using the 2B1Q line code, which is also used in the American variant of the ISDN U interface. First products were developed in 1993. A European version of the standard for E1 service at 2.048 Mbit/s was published in February 1995 by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) as ETSI ETR 152. The first edition of ETR 152 specified the line code 2B1Q on either three pairs at 784 kbit/s each or two pairs at 1,168 kbit/s each. A second edition of ETR 152, published in June 1995, specified trellis coded carrierless amplitude/phase modulation (CAP) as an alternative modulation scheme, running on two pairs at 1,168 kbit/s each. A third version of ETR 152, published in December 1996, added the possibility of using a single CAP-modulated pair at 2,320 kbit/s. Later, an international HDSL standard was published by Study Group 15 of the Telecommunication Standardization Sector of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) on 26 August 1998 and adopted as recommendation ITU-T G.991.1 on 13 October 1998.  Comparison to legacy T1  Legacy T1 carriers operated using the alternate mark inversion (AMI) line code, more recently also B8ZS, on two wire pairs. Each wire pair was operated in simplex, that is, one wire pair was used for transmission in each direction. The Nyquist frequency of a 1.544 megabaud signal is 772 kHz. Higher frequencies are attenuated more strongly than lower frequencies, motivating the use of technologies that reduce the signal bandwidth. In HDSL, full duplex by means of echo cancellation is used, enabling simultaneous transmission in both directions on each of the two wire pairs, effectively reducing the symbol rate by a factor two. Through the use of 2B1Q encoding, two bits are combined to one symbol, further reducing the symbol rate by a factor of two. For this two-pair 2B1Q variant of HDSL, framing increases the bitrate from 1.544 Mbit/s to 1.568 Mbit/s, resulting in a symbol rate of 392 kilobaud and a Nyquist frequency of 196 kHz. Legacy T1 required repeaters every 35 dB of attenuation, equivalent to , depending on conductor gauge and other circumstances. Originally marketed as \\"non-repeated T1\\", HDSL increased the reach to on an AWG24 local loop. To enable longer HDSL lines, up to four repeaters can be used for a reach of .  Comparison to other DSL variants  Unlike ADSL, HDSL operates in the baseband and does not allow POTS or ISDN to coexist on the wire same pairs. Unlike ADSL, the proprietary SDSL, and G.SHDSL, HDSL is not rate adaptive: the line rate is always 1.544 Mbit/s or 2.048 Mbit/s. Lower rates at multiples of 64 kbit/s are offered to customers by using only a portion of the DS0 channels in the DS1 signal, referred to as channelized T1/E1. HDSL gave way to new symmetric DSL technologies, HDSL2 and HDSL4, the proprietary SDSL, and G.SHDSL. HDSL2 offers the same data rate over a single pair of copper; it also offers longer reach, and can work over copper of lower gauge or quality. SDSL is a multi-rate technology, offering speeds ranging from 192 kbit/s to 2.3 Mbit/s, using a single pair of copper.

Conversely, a patient is said to be \\"tolerating\\" a drug when they can tolerate its adverse effects. It is not to be confused with a drug allergy, which is a form of drug intolerance, but requires an immune-mediated component. It is also not to be confused with drug tolerance (\\"drug resistance,\\" or tachyphylaxis) which refers to a lack of adverse effects even at higher than average doses. Some instances of drug intolerance are known to result from genetic variations in drug metabolism. Venn Diagram for Drug Intolerance Pathophysiology Drugs in systemic circulation have a certain concentration in the blood, which serves as a surrogate marker for how much drug will be delivered throughout the body (how much drug the rest of the body will \\"see\\"). There exists a minimum concentration of drug within the blood that will give rise to the intended therapeutic effect (minimum effective concentration, MEC), as well as a minimum concentration of drug that will give rise to an unintended adverse drug event (minimum toxic concentration, MTC). The difference between these two values is generally referred to as the therapeutic window. Different drugs have different therapeutic windows, and different people will have different MECs and MTCs for a given drug. If someone has a very low MTC for a drug, they are likely to experience adverse effects at drug concentrations lower than what it would take to produce the same adverse effects in the general populace; thus, the individual will experience significant toxicity at a dose that is otherwise considered \\"normal\\" for the average person. This individual will be considered \\"intolerant\\" to that drug. There are a variety of factors that can affect the MTC, which is often the subject of clinical pharmacokinetics. Variations in MTC can occur at any point in the ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) process. For example, a patient could possess a genetic defect in a drug metabolizing enzyme in the cytochrome P450 superfamily. While most individuals will possess the effective metabolizing machinery, a person with a defect will have a difficult time trying to clear the drug from their system. Thus, the drug will accumulate within the blood to higher-than-expected concentrations, reaching a MTC at a dose that would otherwise be considered normal for the average person. In other words, in a person that is intolerant to a medication, it is possible for a dose of 10 mg to \\"feel\\" like a dose of 100 mg, resulting in an overdose‚Äîa \\"normal\\" dose can be a \\"toxic\\" dose in these individuals, leading to clinically significant effects. There is also an aspect of drug intolerance that is subjective. Just as different people have different pain tolerances, so too do people have different tolerances for dealing with the adverse effects from their medications. For example, while opioid-induced constipation may be tolerable to some individuals, other people may stop taking an opioid due to the unpleasantness of the constipation even if it brings them significant pain relief. Examples of drug sensitivity * Tinnitus after a normal dose of aspirin * Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease * Liver failure (possibly also kidney failure) after a normal dose of acetaminophen Fatal poisoning can be caused to a breastfed newborn baby due to normal use of codeine by the mother. * Fatal poisoning in a breastfed newborn baby due to normal use of codeine by the mother. * Muscle pain or weakness due to statin therapy Analgesic intolerance Intolerance to analgesics, particularly NSAIDs, is relatively common.

He has previously played for Rennes, Internazionale, Vicenza, Parma, Monaco, Atalanta, Lazio, Manchester City and New England Revolution. He has represented France three times at full international level. Football career =Early career= Born in Laval, Mayenne, Dabo started his career at Stade Rennais, before he and team-mate Mika√´l Silvestre were signed by Internazionale in 1998. Dabo was not a regular first team player for Inter, and a few months later he was loaned out to Vicenza, where he made 13 Serie A appearances. Dabo spent the following season at Parma under Arrigo Sacchi, making sixteen appearances. In June 2000, Inter stated Silvestre and Dabo were bought for only ‚Ç§3 million and sold for ‚Ç§30 million. In June 2000 he changed clubs again, returning to the French league with Monaco in an exchange deal involving Sabri Lamouchi. Six months later he returned to Vicenza on loan, and in the close season made a permanent move to Atalanta. At the Bergamo club he secured regular first team football, and in 2003 he gained a call-up to the France national team for the FIFA Confederations Cup, which Dabo described as \\"a surprise\\". =Lazio= In summer of 2003 Dabo joined Lazio, along with team-mate Luciano Zauri, at first a co-ownership deal but raised to a total of ‚Ç¨3.225 million and ‚Ç¨5.65 million transfer fees after Lazio bought duo remain rights in June 2004. Dabo became an important and popular part of the Lazio midfield due to his organised style of play, making 79 appearances for the club. =Manchester City= After interest from a variety of Premier League clubs in 2006, Dabo joined Manchester City on a Bosman transfer, signing a three-year contract. Dabo cited a positive impression of the club arising from a friendly between Manchester City and Lazio at the City of Manchester Stadium as one of his main reasons for joining Manchester City. His debut for the club came in the opening match of the season, a 3‚Äì0 Premier League defeat to Chelsea. On his third City appearance he received a red card for an aerial challenge with Reading's Steve Sidwell, and was suspended for three matches. However, a knee ligament injury sustained in training resulted in a much longer absence, and he did not make another appearance until mid-December. He then had a run of thirteen consecutive appearances, but was sidelined by injury. Upon his return to fitness he struggled to regain his place in the team, making only one further appearance in the 2006‚Äì07 season. Confrontation with Joey Barton On 1 May 2007, Dabo was assaulted by his team mate Joey Barton at City's training ground. Dabo stated that he had been hit several times, and had to go to hospital after suffering injuries to his head during the incident, including a suspected detached retina.Barton branded a 'coward' by Dabo, The Telegraph.

After Barton signed for Marseille on 1 September 2012 on a season-long loan, Dabo questioned the arrival of the Englishman at the Rhone club and called his former teammate a coward for constantly hitting him when he was face down on the floor. =Return to Lazio= He was put on the transfer list by Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson along with team mates Danny Mills and Paul Dickov. Mills and Dickov both ended up going out on loans, but Dabo remained at the club. After just playing the League Cup game on 29 August 2007, he finally re- signed for Lazio on 30 January 2008, cost only ‚Ç¨263,000. He signed a contract until 30 June 2010.

As an academic, she remained a professor and the Head of Rabindra Sangeet Department at the Rabindra Bharati University for many years. Mitra was a playback singer in Bengali films (and acted in some as well) and was associated for many years with the Indian People's Theatre Association. Mitra studied at the Scottish Church College, the University of Calcutta and at Visva-Bharati University in West Bengal, India. She was also the Sheriff of Kolkata (2001). After prolonged illness Mitra died of a cardiac ailment on 3 January 2011, in Kolkata. Early life Mitra's father, the celebrated litt√©rateur, Saurindra Mohan Mukherjee, was a close associate of the Tagore family of Jorasanko. Suchitra Mitra's natural aptitude in music was recognised by Pankaj Mullick, who gave her a first lesson in Rabindra Sangeet. From her childhood, as the youngest member of her family, Suchitra cultivated her love for the songs and poetry of Tagore. She had an unerring ear for music and a natural gift of voice and expression. She was born in a running train near station Gujhandi, so her nickname was Goju. Musical career In 1941, Suchitra Mitra received a scholarship to Sangit Bhavana in Santiniketan, where she learnt Rabindra Sangeet from some of the greatest teachers - Indira Devi Chaudhurani, Santidev Ghosh, and Sailajaranjan Majumdar. Having obtained her diploma from Santiniketan, Suchitra Mitra returned to Calcutta in 1945. In 1946, she earned her degree from Scottish Church College of the University of Calcutta. In the same year, she co-founded Rabitirtha along with Dwijen Chowdhury (the name Rabitirtha was coined by renowned historian and Tagore scholar Professor Kalidas Nag). Under Suchitra's leadership, Rabitirtha emerged as one of the leading schools of Rabindra Sangeet (in Kolkata). Founder and Principal, Suchitra Mitra was an active figure and inspiration behind this establishment. Her dedication, sincerity and comprehension of the subtle nuances underlying Tagore's songs is indeed praiseworthy.Cultural profiles, by Rekha Menon. Published by Inter-National Cultural Centre, 1961. Page 20 Suchitra was an exponent and an interpreter of Tagore's musical compositions. Her other interests included performing arts, including theatrical performances, film-acting, painting, etc. Mitra produced Rabindra Nritya Natyas (or Tagore's dance dramas); she had acted and danced in many of them. She also acted in stage-plays/dance-drama like Valmiki Pratibha and in films like Dahan directed by Rituparno Ghosh. Her other intellectual pursuits included: reciting poetry, writing short stories, poems and children's rhymes, publishing essays and books on more thought-provoking subjects, such as the grammar and techniques involved in rendering Rabindra Sangeet or on the aesthetics of the music of Tagore. Her greatest achievements may have been her ability to immortalise Tagore's songs both at home and abroad to people of all ages. Invited to the USSR and Hungary, Mitra spread the message of Tagore to the western audience. With the Rabitirtha troupe, she performed Tagore's dance dramas in the USA and Canada. She was the author of many books in Bengali on Rabindra Sangeet, and had recently directed her efforts towards compiling an encyclopaedia of Tagore's songs for students and researchers. Suchitra Mitra's repertoire and expertise, coupled with her ability to inculcate in others the love of Rabindra Sangeet, establishes her as one of the notable names in the world of performing arts in India. Ustad Amjad Ali Khan recognises her as his guide into the world of Rabindrasangeet.Suchitra Mitra at Stanford University Suchitra was considered to be one of the most versatile exponents of Rabindra Sangeet, and in recognition thereof she was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 1974. Together with Kanika Bandopadhyay, Debabrata Biswas and Hemanta Mukhopadhyay, she formed the Golden Quartet of Rabindrasangeet who popularised the compositions of Rabindranath Tagore and left an indelible impression in the fields of arts and culture. Recognition Her reputation as a successful artiste resulted in her appointment as lecturer in Rabindra Bharati University, where she held the prestigious office of Head of the Department of Music. She also succeeded Pankaj Mullick in Sangeet Sikshar Asar - a very popular programme of Akashvani - a tutorial on Rabindrasangeet that was broadcast live. In recognition of her creative talents, Suchitra Mitra received numerous accolades. Some of Mitra's notable awards included. *Tagore Hymn Prize in 1945 from London Tagore Hymn Society. *Padma Shri in 1974 from the Government of India *Sangeet Natak Academy Award in 1986 from the Government of India *HMV Golden Disc Award, *Shiromoni Puraskar from Asian Paints, *Desikottama from Visva-Bharati, *Allauddin Puraskar from the Government of West Bengal, among numerous others. She was conferred 3 honorary D.Litt. degrees by the Rabindra Bharati University, the University of Burdwan and Jadavpur University. As aforementioned, Mitra was also the recipient of the Desikottama (or honorary D.Litt) of the Visva-Bharati University, which is regarded as the pinnacle of recognition in the genre of Rabindra Sangeet. She retired in 1984 from Rabindra Bharati University as a professor and the Head of Rabindra Sangeet Department.\\"Suchitra Mitra\\", Stanford University, www.stanford.edu. Her presence has been an inspiration to younger generations of artists who wish to master the art of Tagore. In popular culture She has been the subject of multiple biographic documentary films.

The hypervariable domain in the DNA sequence is shaded gray. The highly conserved AGC RNA sequence including the branch G is shaded pink. An RNA cleavage site between precursor and product forms of msDNA is indicated by a red triangle. Redrawn from Dhundale et al. Multicopy single- stranded DNA (msDNA) is a type of extrachromosomal satellite DNA that consists of a single-stranded DNA molecule covalently linked via a 2'-5'phosphodiester bond to an internal guanosine of an RNA molecule. The resultant DNA/RNA chimera possesses two stem-loops joined by a branch similar to the branches found in RNA splicing intermediates. The coding region for msDNA, called a \\"retron\\", also encodes a type of reverse transcriptase, which is essential for msDNA synthesis.  Discovery  Before the discovery of msDNA in myxobacteria, a group of swarming, soil-dwelling bacteria, it was thought that the enzymes known as reverse transcriptases (RT) existed only in eukaryotes and viruses. The discovery led to an increase in research of the area. As a result, msDNA has been found to be widely distributed among bacteria, including various strains of Escherichia coli and pathogenic bacteria. Further research discovered similarities between HIV-encoded reverse transcriptase and an open reading frame (ORF) found in the msDNA coding region. Tests confirmed the presence of reverse transcriptase activity in crude lysates of retron- containing strains. Although an RNase H domain was tentatively identified in the retron ORF, it was later found that the RNase H activity required for msDNA synthesis is actually supplied by the host.  Retrons  The discovery of msDNA has led to broader questions regarding where reverse transcriptase originated, as genes encoding for reverse transcriptase (not necessarily associated with msDNA) have been found in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, viruses and even archaea. After a DNA fragment coding for the production of msDNA in E. coli was discovered, it was conjectured that bacteriophages might have been responsible for the introduction of the RT gene into E. coli. These discoveries suggest that reverse transcriptase played a role in the evolution of viruses from bacteria, with one hypothesis stating that, with the help of reverse transcriptase, viruses may have arisen as a breakaway msDNA gene that acquired a protein coat. Since nearly all RT genes function in retrovirus replication and/or the movement of transposable elements, it is reasonable to imagine that retrons might be mobile genetic elements, but there has been little supporting evidence for such a hypothesis, save for the observed fact that msDNA is widely yet sporadically dispersed among bacterial species in a manner suggestive of both horizontal and vertical transfer. Since it is not known whether retron sequences per se represent mobile elements, retrons are functionally defined by their ability to produce msDNA while deliberately avoiding speculation about other possible activities.  Function  The function of msDNA remains unknown even though many copies are present within cells. Knockout mutations that do not express msDNA are viable, so the production of msDNA is not essential to life under laboratory conditions. Over-expression of msDNA is mutagenic, apparently as a result of titrating out repair proteins by the mismatched base pairs that are typical of their structure. It has been suggested that msDNA may have some role in pathogenicity or the adaptation to stressful conditions. Sequence comparison of msDNAs from Myxococcus xanthus, Stigmatella aurantiaca, and many other bacteria reveal conserved and hypervariable domains reminiscent of conserved and hypervariable sequences found in allorecognition molecules. The major msDNAs of M. xanthus and S. aurantiaca, for instance, share 94% sequence homology except within a 19 base-pair domain that shares sequence homology of only 42%. The presence of such domains is significant because myxobacteria exhibit complex cooperative social behaviors including swarming and formation of fruiting bodies, while E. coli and other pathogenic bacteria form biofilms that exhibit enhanced antibiotic and detergent resistance. The sustainability of social assemblies that require significant individual investment of energy is generally dependent on the evolution of allorecognition mechanisms that enable groups to distinguish self versus non-self.  Biosynthesis  left Biosynthesis of msDNA is purported to follow a unique pathway found nowhere else in DNA/RNA biochemistry. Because of the similarity of the 2'-5' branch junction to the branch junctions found in RNA splicing intermediates, it might at first have been expected that branch formation would be via spliceosome- or ribozyme-mediated ligation. Surprisingly, however, experiments in cell-free systems using purified retron reverse transcriptase indicate that cDNA synthesis is directly primed from the 2'-OH group of the specific internal G residue of the primer RNA. The RT recognizes specific stem-loop structures in the precursor RNA, rendering synthesis of msDNA by the RT highly specific to its own retron. The priming of msDNA synthesis offers a fascinating challenge to our understanding of DNA synthesis. DNA polymerases (which include RT) share highly conserved structural features, which means that their active catalytic sites vary little from species to species, or even between DNA polymerases using DNA as a template, versus DNA polymerases using RNA as a template. The catalytic region of eukaryotic reverse transcriptase comprises three domains termed the \\"fingers\\", \\"palm\\", and \\"thumb\\" which hold the double- stranded primer-template in a right-hand grip with the 3'-OH of the primer buried in the active site of the polymerase, a cluster of highly conserved acidic and polar residues situated on the palm between what would be the index and middle fingers. In eukaryotic RTs, the RNase H domain lies on the wrist below the base of the thumb, but retron RTs lack RNase H activity. The nucleic acid binding cleft, extending from the polymerase active site to the RNase H active site, is about 60 √Ö in length in eukaryotic RTs, corresponding to nearly two helical turns. When eukaryotic RT extends a conventional primer, the growing DNA/RNA double helix spirals along the cleft, and as the double helix passes the RNase H domain, the template RNA is digested to release the nascent strand of cDNA. In the case of msDNA primer extension, however, a long strand of RNA remains attached to the 3'-OH of the priming G. Although it is possible to model an RT-primer template complex which would make the 2'-OH accessible for the priming reaction, further extension of the DNA strand presents a problem: as DNA synthesis progresses, the bulky RNA strand extending from the 3'-OH needs somehow to spiral down the binding cleft without being blocked by steric hindrance. To overcome this issue, the msDNA reverse transcriptase clearly would require special features not shared by other RTs.

The memoirs of Keitetsi, a former child soldier herself, have been translated into French, German, Japanese, Chinese and other languages. Biography China Keitetsi was born in 1976 in the west of Uganda. Without her mother she spent her first years with her father and his new girlfriend. In 1984, at the age of nine, China ran off with her sister and tried to find her mother but she fell into the hands of the National Resistance Army. Kampala fell on 26 January 1986, and Museveni was proclaimed as president, but Uganda remained haunted by civil war. Several armed groups fought against the new government. China, like many other children recruited by the NRA to fight in the battle against the Obote government, remained in the ranks of the new government's army, the Ugandan People's Defence Forces (UPDF). Between 1986 and 1995 she made some short returns to civilian life but spent most of her time in the new governmental army. She lost many of her friends in battle and, like many other girls, was raped several times by her superior officers. After spending ten years in the army of Museveni, China escaped from the army in 1995. She fled with a friend through Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe to South Africa where she applied for refugee status. Four years later, China continued to fear for her safety and sought help from the Department of Home Affairs. She was referred to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and was offered relocation in Denmark. She now lives in Denmark and has published her memoirs in a book entitled Child Soldier: Fighting for my life. She has become an international spokeswoman for the plight of child soldiers worldwide. China's book has been published in Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Africa, England, France, Spain, the Czech Republic, Japan and China. She recorded an intro to the song \\"Blood\\" of The Kelly Family (sung by Jimmy Kelly on the 2003 album Homerun).

The film features a dystopic future in which vampires are a marginalized race living in formerly Jewish ghettos, often shot in actual abandoned Jewish ghettos. Another major influence in the look of the film is Terry Gilliam's Brazil.audio commentary, The Breed Plot In an unidentified, vaguely totalitarian future, Detective Stephen Grant (Bokeem Woodbine) investigates a series of strange murders; his partner is killed by a pale man in black who can survive bullet wounds, tosses Grant through a window, and climb up walls like a reptile. After Grant reports the incident, his superiors introduce him to another officer, Aaron Gray (Adrian Paul). Grant learns that vampires exist‚ÄîGray is one of them‚Äîand plan to gradually integrate themselves with the rest of humanity. One of these vampires is responsible for the murders and the other vampires want to help catch the perpetrator. Aiding the officers is a female vampire named Lucy Westenra (played by Bai Ling). Lucy Westenra and Detective Grant eventually become lovers and this complicates the lives of the police officer and the beautiful female vampire as later circumstances seem to implicate everyone's hidden agenda, betrayal, and deception. All the various human and vampire characters seem to be up to something sneaky and questionable as the movie progresses. In absolute secrecy, humans have created a virus that is capable of killing only vampires while leaving humanity unharmed. The virus is made as a failsafe device, in case the plan to coexist between vampires and humans fails. Hidden in a veil of deceit, the elder vampire makes a cynical plan to eradicate humanity if they won't take the cure made from vampire blood and become vampire themselves. The vampire leader believed that as long as humans and vampires remain separate races, there will always be conflict and warfare. He forces the creator of the vampire virus to alter the nature of the virus, making it deadly to humans and not to vampires. The virus creator, Dr. Fleming, doesn't seem to need all that much coercion to make a human biological weapon, as he wanted immortality and the Elder vampire was all too happy to manipulate him. Dr. Fleming pulls a gun and tries to eliminate the police officers when they discover his collaboration with the vampire leader. The vampire leader kills Fleming to silence him when the plot starts to unravel. A renegade vampire resistance leader mistrusts human- vampire cooperation and would use any excuse to start his human-vampire war to determine who would control the world. On the government side, Seward also mistrusts coexistence and would later order government troops to set up an ambush to attack the vampire migrants, and the vampire police force escorting them. Only due to the trust between the human police officers and their vampire allies is the deadly virus plot brought to an end. The subplot of the vampire renegade leader and the overly zealous government agent Seward were also resolved without a bloody war. The high-ranking government director ordered Seward to stand down his troops. It's also implied that the surviving vampire leadership reined in the wild vampire renegades with vampire police forces. Human Detective Grant and Vampire Officer Grey become permanent police partners at the end of the movie. Grant and Lucy Westenra seem to have become a romantic couple, and he even moves into her luxurious mansion.

Pyongyang declaration was initiated with the goal of creating diplomacy between the two nations where previously this was non-existent due to historic hostility. The aim of the declaration was to provide low-interest long term loans to North Korea as well as economic assistance (including humanitarian aid) in accordance with the moratorium of nuclear missile development which has been in place since 1999 . However, in current developments this category of the agreement has been breached. (See North Korea and weapons of mass destruction).The Japanese government was aiming to achieve the return of Japanese abducted citizens which prior to the declaration was unacknowledged. The Pyongyang Declaration named after the North Korean capital, was a pinnacle motion in order to create an effective and fair relationship between the two countries. The declaration resulted in a temporary restraint on nuclear programs from North Korea, the return of 5 Japanese abductees occurring in the 1970s and 1980s and the pledge of economic assistance once the abductees were returned. From 2017, there have been consistent follow-up summit meetings due to breaches within the declaration leading to the requirement of mediators to maintain a mutually beneficial declaration for the respective countries.  History of Japan - North Korea Relations  1904-1905 Japanese army during the Russo-Japanese War ending in their victory in the year 1905. Following the end of the Russo-Japanese war led to the Japanese troops defeating Russia despite being inferior in numbers and resources and led to the 1910 annexation of Korea. For over thirty five years the Korean peninsula was ruled mercilessly by the Japanese colonisation. 1945 The conclusion of World War II ended in a loss for Japan and therefore were unanimously removed of all their colonial possessions which Korea was a part of. Korea was under temporary ally control; this led to the pinnacle hostility and the Korean War (1950-1953). Once separated into South and North Korea the anti-japan tendencies within North Korea escalated. 1991-1992 North Korean National Flag adopted following liberation As there was an unstable relationship between the two countries between 1991 and 1992, there were approximately eight bilateral discussions with the aim of creating diplomatic relations between Japan and North Korea.The basis of the declaration is built on the expectation of maintaining goodwill and cooperation between the two countries. The main agenda of this meeting was Japan wanting a resolution to key incidents including the abduction of Japanese citizens housing in North Korea. These ‚ÄúZainichi Koreans‚Äù experienced systematic prejudice within Japan, to the point of loss of nationalism and barriers to future employment . Following this incident in September 2002, North Korea publicly apologised to the Japanese government leading to the initial summit meeting. Japan has been the instigator of diplomacy attempts with North Korea in order to meet mutually beneficial terms particularly due to the sensitivity the North Korean regime has on human-rights related criticism.  Pyongyang Declaration  = Economic Assistance, Loans, Nuclear Missile Development = Declaration signing between Japan Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and North Korea Supreme leader Kim Jong IL in 2002. The first visit of Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to North Korea occurred in 2002. Prior to this summit meeting there was no acknowledgement of the Japanese abductees on the North Korean government‚Äôs behalf. This visit resulted in a formal apology by General Secretary Kim Jong-il and the official return of the abductees based in North Korea to Japanese soil. Additionally, the Japanese government made their first statement of apology to the North Korean government and their predecessors for the turmoil and suffering endured by their citizens during their colonial rule between 19010-1945. Through this meeting the details of the declaration were discussed and agendas set. The four subcategories of the Pyongyang Declaration included a pledge of economic assistance by Japan for their North Korean comrades. This would only be introduced after bilateral diplomatic relations were normalised and the abductees were returned. Stated by the Japanese Government there were approximately thirteen Japanese citizens abducted under predecessor Kim Jong Il‚Äôs reign, following the agreement five of these abductees were acknowledged and returned. Through this pledge, North Korea agreed to extend its moratorium on their missile testing which was becoming an international issue and threat of warfare. In correspondence with this there is a mutual responsibility of neutralising and maintaining positive relations without the involvement of the United States. This was a large factor within the declarations and played a key role in maintaining positive relations. There were two main agendas that mutually benefited both parties, with North Korea‚Äôs need for economic assistance and the possibility of long-term loans outweighed the interest of nuclear progression, therefore they signed. With the agreement of nuclear progression indefinitely ceasing the declaration created mutually benefited parties with an equal level of compromise. The declaration included mutual cessation of military hostility in areas on confrontation, agreed to actively promote south-north environment cooperation, strengthen cooperation in the areas of prevention of future epidemics and the public health system through providing safety measures in which was equally available for the entirety of the population and mainly to find a form of resolution of separated families. There was a key agreement that the Korean Peninsula must be turned into a land of peace free from nuclear weapons and nuclear threats.This was a particular essential point as Japan would not introduce the aid until normalisation and neutrality of the missile programs was certain.  North Korea Missile Testing  2005 In 2005, Pyongyang declared they were producing nuclear weapons and thus the food aid pledged by the prime minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan led to the suspension of this pledge. 2006 North Korea Ballistic Missile launch 2006 In January of 2006 North Korean leader Kim Jong-un announced the indefinite suspension of all missile testing and nuclear programs. However, in July of 2006 North Korea launched long-range missiles leading to the United Nations and their affiliations passing a worldwide resolution ordering the state to dismantle their nuclear programme including the US government dismantling their oil delivery alliance. The Japanese government further imposed sanctions including the unilateral ban of North Korean imports and the prohibition of the Man Gyong Bong 92 ferry entering Japan. This resulted in several meetings titled the six party talks involving representatives from North and South Korea, China, Russia, Japan and the United States. These talks aimed to reach a peaceful middle ground and re- uphold the initial agreements of the Pyongyang declaration for both respective parties Japan and North Korea. Following the July launch, in October representatives from North Korea announced on behalf of their government the further success of their nuclear testing leading to the United Nations to impose further sanctions including suspension of economic aid from the US government. 2007 Following mulitaral discussion within the six party talks the three initial meetings were unsuccessful in negotiations. In February North Korea shut down their largest nuclear power station for an aid package from the United Nations at the value of over $400 million USD . 2009 There was another announcement of a secondary nuclear test by the North Korean government with an approximate earthquake magnitude of 4.5 in their north east Kilju country. The president of the United States Barack Obama following the nuclear launch stated: > North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the international > community. The sanctions previously set by the United Nations were imposed with further additions following an emergency meeting. North Korea responded by removing their participation in the six party talks . 2012 The diplomatic relations and meetings with incentives with the United States, Russia, Japan and China led to a conclusive moratorium by the DPRK state on all missile launches and nuclear programming for further aid including food. 2013 North Korea carried out a nuclear testing in February 2013 with rocket launches and violated the security of UN resolutions in both 2014 and 2015 through short-fire rocket launches and short-range projectiles of North Korea‚Äôs east-coast. Despite the goodwill attempt from The US states and South Korea towards the North Korean Regime through postponing their respective drills and pledging humanitarian assistance the North Korean government has had minimal motivation to reinstate diplomacy. 2017 Following a three year hiatus, the government of DPRK announced they were carrying out their sixth nuclear test leading to further six party talks which North Korea re-joined.  Current Developments  North Korea and Japan current diplomatic relations are neutral with sections of the Pyongyang declaration being upheld by the two parties. Due to the continuity of the Nuclear programme in North Korea, the United States introduced financial sanctions. Following these financial sanctions‚Äô North Korea reintroduced provocations in July 2006 through firing ballistic missiles. Following an additional nuclear test conducted by North Korea and an initiation of negotiations between Japan and North Korea. In order to help the tense relations between Japan and North Korea, the United States government interceded by removing Pyongyang from its list of state sponsors of terror as a move of good faith on behalf of North Korea as they played a key role in the deteriorating relationship between the two respective countries. Following the death of Kim Jong Il, his successor supreme leader Kim Jong Un took over relations. The first initial two years under Kim Jong Un‚Äôs ( 2011-2013) reign there were hostile relations between the two countries, in particular Japan condemning their satellite launch. Stockholm Agreement A Japanese and North Korean consultation occurred in May 2014, titled the Stockholm agreement due to the location of the meeting. Following this meeting, negotiations officially reached an agreement where Kim Jong Un and the North Korean government dedicated a special investigation committee on the remaining abductees. In addition they pledged a full-scale investigation in regards to the abductees families and the location of current missing Japanese citizens. Following this initiative Japan lifted various sanctions including their importing ban of North Korean goods. Currently under Kim Jong Un, North Korea missile testing and nuclear programs have expanded at a rapid rate and leaving the bilateral negotiations created under King Jong Il at a stall. Whilst there are discussions for a comprehensive solution to finalise the abduction, nuclear and missile issues negotiations are currently still underway between the two respective countries.This is a particular issue as Chairman Kim Jong-un has stated that they will continue launches and nuclear testing indefinitely. In response, the Japanese Government will maintain the sanctions they currently hold on the DPRK‚Äôs economic assistance. 2019 Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the 2019 UN Summit Meeting. Recently, in 2019 North Korea re-started Nuclear testing with a series of short-range missile testing leading to the January Summit Meeting which resulted in Kim Jong Un announcing the separation of the ‚Äúunilaterally bound‚Äù Pyongyang declaration including the nuclear test moratorium . In March 2019, for the first time in over a decade the Japanese government decided to withdraw their participation in the motion condemning North Korea‚Äôs record in regards to their Human Rights with the remaining UN human rights council. This statement coincided with the trend that North Korea was meeting with representatives of the six-party countries from 2018 while excluding the Japanese representatives. This motion was deemed an olive branch by the Japanese government to the North Korean government as their main concern is to have a face-to-face meeting with current Chairman Kim Jong-un to establish an agreement on the remaining abductees who North Korea have announced are deceased or never entered the country, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has stated: > In order to resolve this abductions‚Äô issue, we should not miss out on any > single opportunity and I, myself, have to meet face-to-face with Chairman > Kim Jong Un, and meet with him without attaching any conditions. I intend to > work to resolve this issue, with the determination that we will not miss out > any single opportunity. Shinzo Abe, May 6, 2019. As there have been steps taken to reignite diplomatic relations between the two respective parties there is the potential for further summit meetings to create a unilateral relationship which benefits both parties.

He formerly co-hosted the daily breakfast program on Sydney radio station 2UE with Peter FitzSimons and later Sandy Aloisi. Carlton frequently criticises conservative public figures such as former Prime Minister John Howard, former Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, radio personality Alan Jones, and conservative governments, including the United States' Bush administration. Family Carlton's father, Jim Carlton, was an athlete who competed in the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. In 1930, he set an Australian national record for the 100 yards, which was not broken until 1953. He would have been selected for the 1932 Olympics but left sport to become a Catholic priest. During World War II, Mike Carlton's mother was engaged to another man, who was a Catholic but she was not. She took instruction in the Catholic faith, and Father Jim Carlton was assigned to her. They fell in love, he left the priesthood, and they married. They had two sons, Mike and Peter. Jim Carlton died in 1951.Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 22 May 2016 Mike Carlton has been married twice; to Kerri (two children) and Morag (one child). Early career Carlton began his career as a cadet journalist with the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) in 1963, aged 17. His file reports as an ABC war correspondent in Vietnam earned him great admiration within the industry and a promotion to chief of the ABC's news bureau in Jakarta, Indonesia. Garnering further accolades on his return with the pioneering 1970s ABC-TV current affairs program This Day Tonight, he moved to his first radio program as host at Sydney commercial station 2GB in the early 1980s, this is where \\"Friday News Review\\" was born. Carlton dominated morning radio for a number of years until Alan Jones was moved into the breakfast slot at 2UE in March 1998, and Carlton's ratings started to falter. In the early 1990s he was a presenter for London's LBC Newstalk 97.3FM, then under Australian ownership. At first he presented the drivetime programme, but it was as presenter of The Morning Report breakfast programme that he came to prominence, winning a prestigious Sony Radio Academy Award. This programme helped to change the station's financial fortunes. He later wrote a novel set at a London talk radio station called Off the Air, which became a best-seller in Australia in the late 1990s. Talk show host In 1994 Carlton returned to Sydney to host a morning program on music station Mix 106.5. He then moved to the drive slot at 702 ABC Sydney. Building a reasonable following and establishing a format that he has largely retained in the years since, he was then poached by commercial broadcaster 2UE. Carlton hosted 2UE's drivetime (3pm-6pm) program for a number of years, before moving to the breakfast timeslot (5:30 am ‚Äì 9 am). In a move to improve ratings, 2UE management teamed Carlton with media personality, fellow Sydney Morning Herald columnist and longtime friend of Carlton's, Peter FitzSimons on the breakfast show in 2006. The ratings for the show gradually improved, however in mid-2007 they remained well behind the top two AM talk stations for the breakfast period. Peter FitzSimons left the show at the end of 2007, replaced by Sandy Aloisi from 2008. Carlton's former workmate, now rival, Alan Jones continued to dominate Sydney radio talkback. A long-running feud with fellow 2UE broadcaster Stan Zemanek, noted for his conservative views, had become a feature of Carlton's recent career prior to Zemanek's death in mid-2007. On 17 July 2007, Carlton made comments regarding his late rival. Responding to a listener's question as to why he wouldn't attend Zemanek's funeral, Carlton replied that it would be \\"an act of sheer hypocrisy ... I loathed him.\\" He continued: \\"I'd only go to check that he was actually dead.\\" Carlton later apologised for the remarks, which had been the subject of criticism from fellow radio presenters and 2UE staff. A highly popular feature of Carlton's long-running radio program (and indeed his previous radio career before he joined 2UE), was the weekly political satire segment, Friday News Review. The segment was well known for its fast-paced sketches, topical skewering of high- profile politicians, celebrities and sportspeople across the nation and around the world, and its extremely accurate voice-impersonations of the leading characters. Most of the characters in the segment not portrayed by Carlton were portrayed by Australian actor and television personality Josh Zepps. Friday News Review was one of the last political satire programs on mainstream commercial media in Australia. On 18 September 2009, Carlton retired from his long-running 2UE Breakfast show after over 26 years on Australian morning radio citing an unwillingness to continue with early morning hours and a desire to spend more time with his family and newborn son. Newspaper columnist Carlton was a columnist for The Sydney Morning Herald, initially being sacked from the position on 29 August 2008, for refusing to write his column during a strike by journalists at Fairfax Media. After a lengthy campaign by Herald readers and the appointment of a new editor he was invited to rejoin the newspaper in 2009. He resigned from the paper when disciplinary action was taken against him by the Sydney Morning Herald for using offensive language in several responses to emails received from readers after criticism in his column of Israel's 2014 Gaza offensive.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-06/smh-columnist-mike-carlton- resigns-following-gaza-column-furore/5651470 Author Carlton has published three books on Australian naval history: * Cruiser: The Life And Loss Of HMAS Perth And Her Crew (William Heinemann Australia, 2011) * First Victory (William Heinemann Australia, 2013) * Flagship: The Cruiser HMAS Australia II and the Pacific War on Japan (William Heinemann Australia, 2016) Memoir: * On Air, William Heinemann Book published by Penguin Random House Australia, 2018, Co-authored: * The Great Australian Writer's Collection 2013 (RHA eBooks Adult, 2013) Awards In the 2020 Queen's Birthday Honours, Carlton was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for \\"significant service to the print and broadcast media, and to naval history\\".

Before the Russian Army liberated Holocaust survivors from the Auschwitz death camp in January 1945, he was forced to go on a death march. During the march he suffered frostbite. Using scissors, nurses cut off his numb, frostbitten toes to save his life at the Dora-Nordhausen camp. Speaking to students, he got angry often, and often cried as well. But sharing his Holocaust story with students became his mission in life. Early life Wynschenk was the youngest of four children whose father was a wholesale dealer in fruits and vegetables. When the Nazis occupied the Netherlands in 1940, Wynschenk‚Äôs father lost his business. Wynschenk was separated from the rest of his family after they were arrested in 1943. His two sisters were in hiding, but they turned themselves in after learning their younger brother was without his parents. His sisters did not survive. He arrived in the Westerbork transit camp in the Netherlands, alone, and then was deported to Auschwitz. Wynschenk never again saw any of his immediate family. Wynschenk was put to work in Birkenau, the killing facility of Auschwitz. In a speech to the Holocaust Center of Northern California, Wynschenk later described how he was selected to work on the train platform where the Jews first arrived. After large transports of Hungarian Jews were forced off the trains, Wynschenk had to go aboard the cattle cars and empty them of whatever possessions the Jews had left behind, then load what was left behind onto trucks. Afterwards, he was selected to work in a coal mine in Furstengrubbe, an Auschwitz sub-camp. As World War II drew to a close and Allied liberators closed in upon Auschwitz, Wynschenk was among thousands of prisoners forced from the camp and into a death march by the Nazis. The prisoners wended their way westward. After three days of trudging through freezing mud on their forced death march, and ten more days cramped among many other prisoners in an open convoy, the teenage Wynschenk's toes turned black from gangrene. He was not yet eighteen years old -and weighed a mere 75 pounds- at the end of World War II in 1945, when two nurses cut off his toes. No anesthetic was used, but Wynschenk was so numb that he did not feel anything. His toes were thrown into a fire. Afterwards, his unique gait became easily recognizable. After liberation from the death camp, Wynschenk returned to the Netherlands, by which time his entire immediate family had been killed. He never graduated from high school. He married four years later, in 1949. Coming to America In 1956, Wynschenk and his wife immigrated to the United States, first to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he worked in a leather factory. The Wynschenks moved to the San Francisco Peninsula in 1957, had two children, and subsequently divorced. Wynschenk remarried, to a survivor of a Japanese concentration camp in Indonesia. Wynschenk worked in the insurance business. On a mission Wynschenk never talked about his past, until after receiving a phone call in 1972 from a religious-school teacher. The teacher had discovered that Wynschenk was a Holocaust survivor from his son, Mike. Few Holocaust survivors were making their stories known at the time. The teacher asked the elder Wynschenk to speak to the class about his story, but he became angry instead, and promptly refused. But then he reconsidered. ‚ÄúHe became determined for people to know his story and spoke to many, many schoolchildren over the years,‚Äù said Adrian Schrek, of the Holocaust Center of Northern California, ‚ÄúHe touched many children over the years.‚Äù Wynshenk received numerous letters from appreciative students who heard him, and many inviting him to speak. ‚ÄúI get goosebumps when I read them. I cry. The kids open up from deep inside. They touch me with their love, power, their strength.‚Äù In 1988, he was invited to a middle school in Galt, California, after a student there brought in a newspaper article about him. ‚ÄúUsually I get letters after I talk to schools,‚Äù he then told the Jewish Bulletin of Northern California, but the students had already written him more than a hundred letters. When he and his wife went to Galt, they were welcomed with a banner that said ‚ÄúWelcome, We Love You.‚Äù Wynshenk was awarded an honorary high school diploma in 1989, from Earl Wooster High School in Reno, Nevada, where a month earlier his talk had held students spellbound for two hours. In 1997, Wynschenk went to tell his story at a church in San Bruno, California, but was confronted by five Holocaust deniers who insisted his story was a hoax. But the audience would have none of it. ‚ÄúThe kids stood up roaring, roaring, roaring. Eighty kids, as if on cue, stood up and said ‚ÄòShut up, get out of here,‚Äô\\" according to Wynshenk. The crowd then began to chant, ‚ÄúEddy, Eddy, Eddy,‚Äù Survivor's guilt Wynschenk was haunted by survivor‚Äôs guilt, according to Louis de Groot of the Holocaust Center, who described him as ‚Äúvery scarred from his wartime experiences. There were very few people who understood him. He never was able to really conquer the damage that had been inflicted on him. He lived with a lot of guilt.‚Äù That his sisters came out of hiding on his account, only to be killed themselves, ‚Äúwas a very big burden that he carried,‚Äù de Groot said. Quote ‚ÄúWhenever I talk about the Holocaust, I look to the sky, because that‚Äôs where the six million went.‚Äù See also * American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors * United States Holocaust Memorial Museum External links * Alexandra J.

A posterior urethral valve is an obstructing membrane in the posterior male urethra as a result of abnormal in utero development. It is the most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns. The disorder varies in degree, with mild cases presenting late due to milder symptoms. More severe cases can have renal and respiratory failure from lung underdevelopment as result of low amniotic fluid volumes, requiring intensive care and close monitoring. It occurs in about one in 8000 babies. Presentation =Complications= *Incontinence *Urinary tract infection *Renal failure *Vesicoureteral reflux *Chronic kidney disease Diagnosis Postvesicular obstruction due to urethral valves. Abdominal ultrasound is of some benefit, but not diagnostic. Features that suggest posterior urethral valves are bilateral hydronephrosis, a thickened bladder wall with thickened smooth muscle trabeculations, and bladder diverticula. Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is more specific for the diagnosis. Normal plicae circularis are variable in appearance and often not seen on normal VCUGs. PUV on voiding cystourethrogram is characterized by an abrupt tapering of urethral caliber near the verumontanum, with the specific level depending on the developmental variant. Vesicoureteral reflux is also seen in over 50% of cases. Very often the posterior urethra maybe dilated thus making the abrupt narrowing more obvious. the bladder wall may show trabeculations or sacculations or even diverticuli. Diagnosis can also be made by cystoscopy, where a small camera is inserted into the urethra for direct visualization of the posteriorly positioned valve. A limitation of this technique is that posterior valve tissue is translucent and can be pushed against the wall of the urethra by inflowing irrigation fluid, making it difficult to visualize. Cystoscopy may also demonstrate the bladder changes. Centers in Europe and Japan have also had excellent results with cystosonography, although it has not been approved for use in the United States yet. =Classification= The male urethra laid open on its anterior (upper) surface. Posterior valves are usually fusion of the plicae colliculi between the entrance of the seminal vesicles at the veromontanum, and extend to the membranous urethra. Posterior urethral obstruction was first classified by H. H. Young in 1919. The verumontanum, or mountain ridge, is a distinctive landmark in the prostatic urethra, important in the systemic division of posterior valve disorders: * Type I - Most common type; due to anterior fusing of the plicae colliculi, mucosal fins extending from the bottom of the verumontanum distally along the prostatic and membranous urethra * Type II - Least common variant; vertical or longitudinal folds between the verumontanum and proximal prostatic urethra and bladder neck * Type III - Less common variant; a disc of tissue distal to verumontanum, also theorized to be a developmental anomaly of congenital urogenital remnants in the bulbar urethra Dewan has suggested that obstruction in the posterior urethra is more appropriately termed congenital obstructions of the posterior urethral membrane (COPUMs), a concept that has come from an in-depth analysis of the historical papers, and evaluation of patients with a prenatal diagnosis that has facilitated video recording of the uninstrumented obstructed urethra. The congenital obstructive lesions in the bulbar urethra, named Type III Valves by Young in 1919, have been eponymously referred to as Cobb's collar or Moorman's ring. For each of the COPUM (Posterior Urethra) and Cobb's (Bulbar Urethra) lesions, the degree of obstruction can be variable, consistent with a variable expression of the embryopathy. The now nearly one hundred year old nomenclature of posterior urethral valves was based on limited radiology and primitive endoscopy, thus a change COPUM or Cobb's has been appropriate. Treatment If suspected antenatally, a consultation with a paediatric surgeon/ paediatric urologist maybe indicated to evaluate the risk and consider treatment options. Treatment is by endoscopic valve ablation. Fetal surgery is a high risk procedure reserved for cases with severe oligohydramnios, to try to limit the associated lung underdevelopment, or pulmonary hypoplasia, that is seen at birth in these patients. The risks of fetal surgery are significant and include limb entrapment, abdominal injury, and fetal or maternal death. Specific procedures for in utero intervention include infusions of amniotic fluid, serial bladder aspiration, and creating a connection between the amniotic sac and the fetal bladder, or vesicoamniotic shunt. There are three specific endoscopic treatments of posterior urethral valves: *Vesicostomy followed by valve ablation - a stoma, or hole, is made in the urinary bladder, also known as low diversion, after which the valve is ablated and the stoma is closed. *Pyelostomy followed by valve ablation - stoma is made in the pelvis of the kidney as a slightly high diversion, after which the valve is ablated and the stoma is closed *Primary (transurethral) valve ablation - the valve is removed through the urethra without creation of a stoma The standard treatment is primary (transurethral) ablation of the valves. Urinary diversion is used in selected cases, and its benefit is disputed. Following surgery, the follow-up in patients with posterior urethral valve syndrome is long term, and often requires a multidisciplinary effort between paediatric surgeons/ paediatric urologists, paediatric nephrologists, pulmonologists, neonatologists, radiologists and the family of the patient. Care must be taken to promote proper bladder compliance and renal function, as well as to monitor and treat the significant lung underdevelopment that can accompany the disorder. Definitive treatment may also be indicated for the vesico-ureteral reflux.

Its ts≈´sh≈çg≈ç code name was the , and its military symbol was 15D. The 15th Division was one of four new infantry divisions raised by the Imperial Japanese Army in the closing stages of the Russo-Japanese War (1904‚Äì1905). With Japan's limited resources towards the end of that conflict, the entire IJA was committed to combat in Manchuria, leaving not a single division to guard the Japanese home islands from attack. The 15th Division was initially raised from men in the area surrounding Nagoya under the command of Lieutenant General Okihara Kofu. Action =Interwar period= The Treaty of Portsmouth was concluded before the 15th division could be deployed to Manchuria, and it was sent instead to Korea as a garrison force. 24 March 1907, the logistics battalion was transferred to the military school in Ushigome, and entire division has moved to Narashino, Chiba on 28 March 1907. The division was re-assembled 15 November 1908 in its original divisional headquarters located in Toyohashi, Aichi prefecture. However, on 1 May 1925, it was dissolved by Minister of War Ugaki Kazushige as part of a cost-saving measure during the Kato Takaaki administration, together with the 13th, 17th and 18th divisions. =Second Sino-Japanese War= In July 1937, open hostilities broke out against China and the Second Sino-Japanese War commenced. The 15th Division was re- established in Kyoto on 4 April 1938 as a triangular division, from the reserve forces of the IJA 16th Division. Under the command of Lieutenant General Yoshio Iwamatsu, it was assigned to the Chinese mainland as a garrison force around Nanjing and to maintain public safety over Japanese-occupied areas. =Battle of Imphal= On 17 June 1943 the 15th division was reassigned to the IJA 15th Army in Burma as part of an impending offensive against British India, with Nanjing garrison taken by newly formed 61st division. The division was delayed with road-building in Thailand for several months. Arriving in Burma, the division took part in the attack on Imphal as part of the Operation U-Go along with the IJA 31st and 33rd Divisions, followed by the Battle of Meiktila and Mandalay. During these operations, the division lost more than half of its men in combat or due to disease, and was forced out of Burma into Thailand in August 1945 days before the end of the war, where it was officially disbanded. Operation U-Go was planned to start in the beginning of March 1944, but because of 15th Division's slow arrival start of the offensive was postponed to 15 March. The 15th Division formed the central position of the three attacking divisions, and its primary objective was to cut the road between Imphal and Kohima at Kangpokpi. On the map this was the shortest and most direct route towards Imphal, but the division had to cross difficult terrain with only poor tracks. Because of the difficult terrain, the division‚Äôs field artillery was replaced with mountain guns and the anti-tank equipment was left behind. Of the division‚Äôs nine battalions, one had been detached to the force dealing with the second Chindits operation, and most of its 67th Regiment was still in Thailand. Thus, the 15th Division started the campaign with 6 battalions, 18 guns and a commander, Lieutenant-General Masafumi Yamauchi, who mortally ill with tuberculosis. Soon it had to be urged onwards by the commander of 15th Army, General Renya Mutaguchi A British force at Sangshak was within 15th Division‚Äôs operational area, but because of its slow speed, units from the 31st Division assaulted this position on 23 March. The 60th Regiment arrived soon after, but was not allowed to take part in the final assault 27 March. The 15th Division cut the Imphal-Kohima road at Kangpokpi on 3 April. Soon the division occupied Nunshigum Ridge, which overlooked Imphal. From here the Japanese could threaten the headquarters of the IV Corps; this also marked the closest they would come to Imphal. The British counterattack on this ridge included M3 Lee tanks, which came as a shock to the Japanese as they had considered the terrain to be completely impassable to armored vehicles. The tanks proved decisive - although the British suffered heavy losses, the defending Japanese battalion was almost annihilated. Despite this setback Yamauchi continued his encirclement of Imphal from the north. The British commander, General Geoffry Scoones drew the conclusion that the 15th Division was the weakest link in the Japanese front and ordered Indian 23rd Infantry Division and Indian 5th Infantry Division to destroy it. In the following months the British with their superiority in numbers and almost unstoppable tanks drove the Japanese off one hill after another. In the middle of June the Japanese 31st Division began retreating from Kohima after suffering heavy casualties. This left the 60th Regiment blocking the Imphal-Kohima road in an impossible situation and the British broke through and reopened the road on 22 June. The next day saw a change in command, with Yamauchi replaced by Lieutenant-General Ryuichi Shibata. On 7 July the division received orders for a last-ditch attack on Pallel, but by now it had been shattered as a military formation; its remnants retreated back across the Chindwin River to safety. =Battle of Meiktila and Mandalay= After the defeat at Imphal and Allied advances in the north, the Japanese forces in Burma were forced on the defensive to try to stop the Allies from crossing the Irrawaddy. In January 1945 the 15th Division, together with the 53rd Division, was thrown into the defense of Mandalay. The division had received some reinforcements, but at 4500 men it was still less than half of nominal strength. The opposing, Indian 19th Infantry Division, established its first bridgeheads on the eastern side of the Irrawaddy on 14 January and all attempts to dislodge them failed. After a rapid build-up, the British commander, General Thomas Wynford Rees ordered his men forward. Brushing aside all opposition, its forward elements were within sight of Mandalay 7 March. The 15th Division, now under the command of Major-General Kyoe Yamamoto, had received orders to defend the former Burmese capital to the last man. Of the two main positions, the Japanese were driven off Mandalay Hill by 12 March, but the thick walls of Fort Dufferin withstood artillery and air bombardment. On 18 March the division received new orders allowing its withdrawal, which it did through the sewers on the night of 19 March. By this time the Japanese position in Burma had completely collapsed. The survivors of the 15th Division (less than half its original strength of 15,000 men) retreated via the territory of the hostile Karen people and through the Southern Shan States, back into Kachanaburi, Thailand, where it remained at the time of the surrender of Japan 15 August 1945.

It is oil on canvas and measures by . The painting depicts Dr. Samuel D. Gross, a seventy-year-old professor dressed in a black frock coat, lecturing a group of Jefferson Medical College students. Included among the group is a self-portrait of Eakins, who is seen at the left-hand side of the painting, next to the tunnel railing, with a white cuffed sleeve sketching or writing. Seen over Dr. Gross's right shoulder is the clinic clerk, Dr. Franklin West, taking notes on the operation. Eakins's signature is painted on the front of the surgical table. Description Admired for its uncompromising realism, The Gross Clinic has an important place documenting the history of medicine‚Äîboth because it honors the emergence of surgery as a healing profession (in previous years surgery was associated primarily with Amputation, which caused severe medical complications, later killing the person) , and because it shows what an surgical theater looked like in the nineteenth century. The painting is based on a surgery witnessed by Eakins, in which Gross treated a young man for osteomyelitis of the femur. Gross is pictured here performing a conservative operation, as opposed to the amputation normally carried out. Here, surgeons crowd around the anesthetized patient in their frock coats‚Äîthis is just prior to the adoption of a hygienic surgical environment (see asepsis). The Gross Clinic is thus often contrasted with Eakins's later painting The Agnew Clinic (1889), which depicts a cleaner, brighter, surgical theater, with the participants in \\"white coats\\".Hardy, Susan and Corones, Anthony, \\"Dressed to Heal: The Changing Semiotics of Surgical Dress\\", Fashion Theory, (2015), pp.1-23. doi=10.1080/1362704X.2015.1077653 In comparing the two, the advance in understanding of the prevention of infection is seen. Another noteworthy difference in the later painting is the presence of a professional nurse, Mary Clymer, in the operating theater. It is assumed that the patient depicted in The Gross Clinic was a teenage boy, although the exposed body is not entirely discernible as male or female; the painting is shocking for both the odd presentation of this figure and the matter-of-fact goriness of the procedure.Kimmelman, Michael (June 21, 2002). Art Review: A Fire Stoking Realism. The New York Times Adding to the drama is the lone woman in the painting seen in the middle ground, possibly the patient's mother, cringing in distress. Her dramatic figure functions as a strong contrast to the calm, professional demeanor of the men who surround the patient. This bloody and very blunt depiction of surgery was shocking at the time it was first exhibited. Eakins' painting also shows the use of General anesthesia (as it had not been invented centuries prior) to make the operation easier, and the use of gloves (They weren't used in surgery years before, and operations were carried out with unsterilized hands, causing the wound to be infected afterwards). Critical reception The Gross Clinic on display in the U.S. Army Post Hospital at the 1876 Centennial Exposition. The painting was submitted for the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, but was rejected by the Committee of Selection. When it was eventually displayed in Ward One of the U.S. Army Post Hospital, a critic for the New York Tribune wrote that it was: > ...one of the most powerful, horrible, yet fascinating pictures that has > been painted anywhere in this century...but the more one praises it, the > more one must condemn its admission to a gallery where men and women of weak > nerves must be compelled to look at it, for not to look at it is impossible. Another critic, writing in 1885, said: These assessments were not universal. The critic for Philadelphia's The Evening Telegraph, who may have been aware of the personal politics involved in the advisory group of artists who rejected it, wrote: > There is nothing so fine in the American section of the Art Department of > the Exhibition, and it is a great pity that the squeamishness of the > Selecting Committee compelled the artist to find a place for it in the > United States Hospital building. It is rumored that the blood on Dr. Gross' > fingers made some of the members of the committee sick, but, judging from > the quality of the work exhibited by them we fear that it was not the blood > alone that made them sick. Artists have before now been known to sicken at > the sight of pictures by younger men which they in their souls were > compelled to acknowledge were beyond their emulation.William J. Clark, The > Evening Telegraph, June 16, 1876. Controversy about the painting has centered on its violence, and on the melodramatic presence of the woman. Modern scholars have suggested that the painting may be read in terms of castration anxiety and fantasies of mastery over the body (e.g. Michael Fried), and that it documents Eakins's ambivalence about representing sex difference (e.g. Jennifer Doyle). The painting has also been understood to be drawing an analogy between painting and surgery and as identifying the work of the artist with the emergence of surgery as a respected profession. In 2002, Michael Kimmelman of The New York Times called it \\"hands down, the finest 19th-century American painting.\\" In 2006, in response to the impending sale of this painting, The New York Times published a \\"close reading\\" which sketches some of the different critical perspectives on this work of art.Shattuck, Kathryn (November 17, 2006). \\"Got Medicare? A $68 Million Operation\\". The New York Times Provenance After its purchase for US$200 at the time of the Centennial Exhibition, the painting was housed in the College Building of Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia until it was moved in the mid-1980s to Jefferson Alumni Hall. Although undocumented, in the late-1970s there was a rumor of a substantial offer by a collector who wished to donate the painting to the National Gallery of Art. On November 11, 2006, the Thomas Jefferson University Board voted to sell the painting for US$68 million to the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the new Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, then under construction in Bentonville, Arkansas. The sale would represent a record price for an artwork made in the United States prior to World War II.Vogel, Carol (November 11, 2006). Eakins Masterwork Is to Be Sold to Museums. The New York Times The proposed sale was seen as a secretive act.Salisbury, Stephan (November 14, 2006), A divisive deal, The Philadelphia Inquirer http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/16005417.htm In late November 2006, efforts began to keep the painting in Philadelphia, including a fund with a December 26 deadline to raise money to purchase it and a plan to invoke a clause regarding \\"historic objects\\" in the city's historic preservation code. In a matter of weeks the fund raised $30 million, and on December 21, 2006, Wachovia Bank agreed to lend the difference until the rest of the money had been raised, keeping the painting in town at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Pledges alone were not enough to cover the US$68 million purchase price. The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts was forced to deaccession Eakins's The Cello Player to an unidentified private buyer; and the Philadelphia Museum of Art deaccessioned Eakins's Cowboy Singing, along with two oil sketches for Cowboys in the Badlands, to the Anschutz collection and the Denver Art Museum. The Denver-based Anschutz collection purchased Cowboys in the Badlands at a May 22, 2003 auction at Christie's New York for $5,383,500, which was the previous record for an Eakins painting.Antiques and the Arts Online (May 27, 2003).

Restorations The painting has been restored three times. The first restoration between 1917 and 1925 substantially damaged the painting, rendering secondary figures in the composition inconsistently bright or reddish in color.Kennedy, Randy \\"Shedding Darkness on an Eakins Painting\\", The New York Times, July 18, 2010 In 1929, Susan Macdowell Eakins, the artist's widow, wrote a letter of complaint regarding the \\"fancy red light\\" that had falsified the painting's intended tones. The painting's backing was reinforced with plywood by H. Stevenson in 1915. This was replaced in 1940 by Hannah Mee Horner, who glued the painting to a plywood backing. Within two decades this backing began to warp and threatened to tear the painting in half. In 1961, at the request of Jefferson Medical College, the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA) undertook another restoration, under conservator Theodor Siegl.Theodor Siegl. The Thomas Eakins Collection. Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1978. . Page 9 Mark Tucker, a later PMA conservator, described the work as \\"a rescue mission... They were saving the painting from tearing itself in half. These were the nail heads that were starting to work forward into the canvas and show as bumps on the front... Yeah. It was just hair-raising.\\"'Gross Clinic' painting undergoes its own public surgery. Stephan Salisbury. The Seattle Times, May 14, 2010. Siegl used a power plane to remove the plywood down to the last, thin ply. The rest of the wood and the tenacious glue were painstakingly removed by hand. Siegl and his colleagues also restored, to some extent, the faces in the upper right of the canvas. In 2009, in response to long term concerns regarding inconsistencies in the painting's disposition of darkness and light, conservators at the Philadelphia Museum of Art undertook restoration of The Gross Clinic from July 2009 to July 2010, during which time the painting was not publicly visible. The restoration sought to revert changes that had been made by the Jefferson Medical College during the 1917 restoration. Definition of parts, including Eakins' self-portrayal, was restored, using as reference an ink wash copy of the painting made by the artist, as well as a photograph taken by the Metropolitan Museum of Art previous to the Medical College's changes in 1917.

The American V8-powered versions were marketed as Laforza and were built from 1989 until 2003. The Magnum began life intended for military and police use, but the Tom Tjaarda designed car, fitted with a sumptuous Italian leather interior in the spirit of the Maserati Biturbo and a range of 4-, 6-, and 8-cylinder engines was marketed as a \\"luxury 4x4.\\" It was intended as a competitor for the Range Rover and was designed to meet those needs the Range Rover left unfulfilled at the time, such as a more luxurious interior and more fuel-efficient smaller engines - including turbodiesels. Better fuel efficiency was essential to European market conditions. The vehicle was refreshed in 1998 with a facelifted design to include more modern amenities, but still used the same basic body and drivetrain. Rayton-Fissore The origin of the Laforza is the Rayton-Fissore Magnum 4x4, presented in July 1984. This vehicle was based on the shortened and lowered chassis of a projected medium-weight military off- roader called the Iveco \\"40 PM 10\\" (this project ended up being adopted as the Iveco VM 90). While the original Magnum prototype used the same turbodiesel engine as does the Iveco Turbodaily, the 2,445 cc Sofim turbodiesel which ended up being installed in most of the Rayton-Fissore Magnums was projected from an early stage. The front and rear differentials, suspension, and brakes were carried over from the Iveco truck, which was based on the four-wheel drive version of the Iveco Daily. 1986 Rayton-Fissore Magnum Turbo D The steel body shell added additional strength to the chassis through a construction technique developed by Rayton Fissore called \\"UNIVIS.\\" The body consisted of a square tubular structure bolted to the subframe with 10 rubber mounts (Silentbloc). Pre-series cars (built before March 1985) have fiberglass bodywork; the steel-bodied production cars retained the plastic bonnet and bootlid. Most of the Magnum bodies were built by Golden Car of Caramagna Piemonte and then sent to Rayton-Fissore in Cherasco to be finished. Many details such as the lamps came from Italian mass-market automobiles. The four- wheel-drive system was part-time with front and rear differentials, with the rear axle always being engaged. A BorgWarner transfer case provided a low set of gears for off-road use. The rear axle is a leaf-sprung live unit from the Iveco Daily. The standard power steering came from ZF.Meurer, p. 49 About 6,000 Magnums were produced in 18 years of production, of which around 1,200 were the US-market Laforzas. Approximately 1,000 Magnums fitted with the VM turbodiesel were sold to various Italian law enforcement agencies up until the late nineties. Other institutional purchasers included Italy's Guardia di Finanza, the State Forestry Corps, and other, lesser entities. Rayton-Fissore did not have a strong enough sales network to properly market the car and also lacked the financial resources to update it. =Engines= The Magnum was originally available with two petrol engine and one diesel engine. The 2.4 liter (2393 cc) Sofim turbo diesel produces . The 2.0-litre four-cylinder supercharged petrol engine from Fiat/Lancia produces and the 2.5-litre (2492 cc) Alfa Romeo sourced V6 produces , with the V6 being marketed as the Magnum VIP.Automobil Revue 1987, p. 482 Only about 120 of the V6-engined version were built. With an updated version shown at the 1988 Turin Motor Show, the Fiat and Alfa Romeo engines were replaced with VM Motori turbodiesels and a BMW 3.4 liter inline-six as well as a BMW turbodiesel. Laforza The first Laforza arrived in the United States between 1988-89 with some modifications to the Magnum 4x4 base frame. The major differences included: reinforced and modified cross members, (transmission) and other details to use the Ford V8 (more commonly known as the \\"5.0\\") EFI engine and the AOD transmission, coupled with a \\"2wd high, 4wd high, 4wd low\\" Newprocess 229 transfer case (Selec-Trac). The body underwent some minor restyling, bumpers and tail lights were different, as well as the headlights and grille. The Magnum 4x4's leather interior was retained in the American version, but upgraded with a new type of dash and seats as well as the center tunnel and the door panels. = 1989 to 1993 = The original Laforza 5-liter was updated by Pininfarina who also did the final assembly. This model features Ford 5.0 EFI V8 (truck version) with automatic overdrive transmission (AOD) and a high/low gear transfer case (Newprocess model 229). = 1995 to 1998 = The Laforza GT was equipped with a Ford V8 5.0 SEFI V8 (from the Mustang GT) and a few fitted with the 5.8 SEFI V8 (truck version) with the same transmission and transfer case as above. Some of these versions were fitted with an optional Kenne Bell supercharger. In 1996 production was transferred to Rayton-Fissore's successor company Magnum Industriale. = 1998 to 2003 = The company went through another restructuring in 1998, becoming \\"Laforza SpA.\\" The updated Laforza Prima was fitted with the Ford V8 5.0 SEFI found on The Ford Explorer and an electronic automatic transmission (AODE) as well as a full-time 4WD transfer case (without low gears) with an Eaton Supercharger as optional. The Prima was renamed Laforza Magnum edition in 1999 when the Ford V8 model was joined by a General Motors 6.0-liter V8 with Eaton supercharger and a 4-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission (Hydra-Matic 4L65-E) coupled with a 2wd/4wd high/4wd low transfer case was also offered. Laforza also planned a version for Europe, using a 3.9-liter Iveco direct injection turbodiesel inline-four engine or Alfa Romeo's 3-liter V6, but this model remained a prototype. Golden Car owner Alessandro Festa acquired the rights to the Magnum/Laforza in 2004 but was unable to bring it back to the market.

Miller and starring Steve Guttenberg, Kathleen Quinlan, and Miko Hughes. It revolves around the friendship between the title characters Zeus and Roxanne, a dog and a dolphin, respectively. Plot One morning, a dog named Zeus goes to the pier, spots a dolphin, and becomes fascinated by its movements. Afterwards, he returns home to his owner, Terry Barnett, an aspiring musician, and his son, Jordan, who appears to be taking care of him. Later that morning, Zeus chases a cat and subsequently destroys the outdoor garden of Mary Beth Dunhill, a marine biologist and the Barnetts' next-door neighbor. Terry calms Zeus down and apologizes to Mary Beth, although she is agitated by him. Mary Beth later goes to her workplace and is followed by Zeus, who notices her photo of the same dolphin from earlier. Upon arriving, she is met by her research partner, Becky, and her rival, Claude Carver. Mary Beth and Becky travel out to the ocean on a boat to follow the dolphin they are researching, whom they name Roxanne, and Zeus stows away with them. However, while in the middle of the ocean, he slips off. Roxanne saves him from a shark and gives him a ride back to the boat on her back, which surprises and fascinates Mary Beth and Becky, who find that Zeus and Roxanne can do \\"inter-species communication\\". While stopping over on the way home with Zeus, Mary Beth spots her two impossible daughters, Judith and Nora, skating against her wishes. Arriving home, she asks Jordan if she could borrow Zeus for her research on Roxanne, who she hopes to release back into the wild. Jordan agrees, and he and Terry accompany her on her research. During the following days, Terry begins to fall in love with Mary Beth as he manages to find inspiration for his music, while Jordan bonds with Judith and Nora. After Terry saves Judith and Nora while they are skating in a factory, Mary Beth asks him out on a date. After spending the night at a local beachside resort, they awkwardly kiss. Meanwhile, Claude, wanting research grant money to come to his research and not Mary Beth's, tries to steal hers, but winds up getting comically thwarted by Zeus. Then, he tries gaining the lead in her interspecies communication study, although his attempts to have one of his research dolphins bond with another animal fail one after another. Through the conniving of Jordan, Judith, and Nora, Terry decides to move into Mary Beth's house with Jordan and Zeus, but after seeing a photo of his late wife, he decides to pursue his original plan of traveling to another town to continue writing his music. This causes both Zeus and Roxanne distress. While staying at a hotel with his owners, Zeus runs away back to Mary Beth's research center. Noticing his disappearance and realizing where he was going, Terry and Jordan return to town, while Mary Beth uses a submersible to go down and investigate the seabed after Claude claims Roxanne was caught in an illegal fishing net and killed. Zeus returns to the research center, where he is captured by Claude, who intends to use him as bait to lure out Roxanne, who is in fact alive, and capture her. However, Zeus and Roxanne work together to trap him and his assistant in a net, where they are arrested by police. While exploring the seabed, Mary Beth's submersible's propeller is tangled in the fishing nets, and when she opens the main hatch thinking she'd escape through it, water begins flooding the interior. Roxanne leads Terry to Mary Beth, and he manages to free her from the trapped submersible. Afterwards, Jordan, Judith, and Nora convince him to marry her. During the wedding, she is given a grant for her research on Zeus and Roxanne. Immediately afterwards, a pod of dolphins appears, and Zeus convinces Roxanne to join them. Zeus watches happily with Terry, Mary Beth, Jordan, Judith, and Nora as Roxanne leaps into the air with the pod.

The krone ( / ') was a short-lived, provisional currency used in parts of the then newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, parts of which had previously been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (Austria-Hungary). History After World War I, Austria-Hungary was disintegrated into a number of states with its southeastern portion becoming the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. It and Kingdom of Serbia soon after merged to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was later renamed Yugoslavia. The krone replaced the Austro-Hungarian krone at par on November 12, 1918. It circulated alongside the Serbian dinar in State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs with an exchange rate of 1 dinar = 4 kronen in the intermediate time before the adoption of the Yugoslav dinar. The exact date at which the krone ceased to circulate is unclear, with one source indicating that the krone was still in circulation at the end of 1922.Global Financial Data Banknotes The 1919 First Provisional Issue of the Yugoslav krone was (very similar to the Banknotes of the Czechoslovak koruna (1919) issued on 1912 Austro-Hungarian banknotes (with a black validating oval overprint) in 10, 20, 50, 100, and 1,000 Kronen denominations.Cuhaj, 2010, 1252.

She is the founder of charities Road to Peace and Save a Child. She is credited with saving hundreds of lives through her actions in the Balkans, and was frequently referred to in the British media as the \\"Angel of Mostar\\".  Activism  = Bosnia and Herzegovina = Moved by the images of suffering in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Becker travelled there to deliver aid to people living close to the front line in west Mostar, driving into and out of the city in an old Renault. As one of the only foreign aid workers able to travel freely in the area, she was asked by a UN officer to try and gain access to the east side of the city, where 50,000 Bosniaks were trapped. With permission from the Croatian Ministry of Defence, she crossed the front line to evacuate wounded children and their families from the besieged hospital. The mission was successful and she became known as the Angel of Mostar. On 10 December 1993, she led a convoy of 57 ambulances and trucks from the United Kingdom to deliver medical aid to besieged hospitals on all sides of the conflict. She managed to arrange ceasefires, and is credited with saving hundreds of lives. The mission was dubbed Operation Angel and later became a registered charity. In February 1994, aid convoys were grounded due to snow, leaving 28 injured children and their families trapped in a monastery serving as a makeshift hospital in Nova Bila. Becker reached the area by helicopter and flew them to safety. = Kosovo = When Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá ordered his troops into Kosovo as part of the Kosovo War, Becker led a humanitarian aid convoy to the region. When the borders were closed, she brought the convoys to northern Albania where thousands of refugees had escaped from the fighting. Led by a soldier from the Kosovo Liberation Army, she crossed the mountains into Kosovo on foot to bring pediatric medicines to a besieged hospital in Junik. While she was there, she was asked to take 25 children and their mothers across the mountains to safety. They were ambushed by Serb paramilitaries and Becker was captured and imprisoned. The families made it across the border and, when Becker was eventually released, she traced them to a refugee camp in northern Albania. She arranged for them to travel to the United Kingdom for medical treatment but on 13 November 1998, the day the Hellenic Air Force was supposed to fly them to Britain, Home Office Minister, Jack Straw, refused to issue their visas. Two days later, Becker was shot in the leg by masked gunmen as she returned to her hotel with a colleague. The President of Albania sent his Minister of Health to evacuate her but she refused to leave without the children, remaining in the area until they were accepted for treatment in other countries. On 27 November 1998, Becker resigned from her position as leader of Operation Angel, citing a lack of support from the press and the British government. = Other countries = In August 2006, she brought humanitarian aid to families trapped in shelters during the conflict between Israel and Lebanon. Becker was appointed as a goodwill ambassador for Children of Peace, a multi-faith charity dedicated to building friendship, trust and reconciliation between Israeli and Palestinian children. In 2014, Becker founded Road to Peace, a British charity helping children in areas of conflict. She and her volunteers provided medical treatment for thousands of children fleeing from ISIL in Syria and northern Iraq, and in 2016 attempted to negotiate asylum in the United Kingdom for more than 1,400 Yazidis in the region. in 2018 they established an emergency medical facility for Yazidi children in Sinjar.

The monk Iryeon consulted the work some half a century later when compiling his Samguk Yusa. It was long thought that the work was lost, until portions of it were rediscovered at a Buddhist temple in Seongju in the early twentieth century. Only two of probably more than ten volumes survive. The extant volumes include biographies of eighteen famous and not‚Äìso‚Äìfamous Buddhist monks from Goguryeo and Silla, as well as India and China. Unfortunately, some of the most famous of Three Kingdoms period Buddhist figures are not included (namely Wonhyo), though they were presumably included in the missing volumes.

It is used in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux (kidney reflux), among other disorders. The technique consists of catheterizing the person in order to fill the bladder with a radiocontrast agent, typically diatrizoic acid. Under fluoroscopy (real time x-rays) the radiologist watches the contrast enter the bladder and looks at the anatomy of the patient. If the contrast moves into the ureters and back into the kidneys, the radiologist makes the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux, and gives the degree of severity a score. The exam ends when the person voids while the radiologist is watching under fluoroscopy. Consumption of fluid promotes excretion of contrast media after the procedure. It is important to watch the contrast during voiding, because this is when the bladder has the most pressure, and it is most likely this is when reflux will occur. Despite this detailed description of the procedure, the technique had not been standardized across practices.

One thousand and one were made between 1954 and 1956. The Scenicruiser became an icon of the American way of life due to its presence throughout the US in cities and along highways and popularity with the traveling public. The name was a portmanteau of the words \\"scenic\\" and \\"cruiser\\". The high-level design concept of Scenicruiser resembles some of the rolling stock of the passenger-carrying railroads of the United States and Canada, particularly their popular stainless steel dome cars. This type of two-level motorcoach body was common in the late forties in Western Europe, including Great Britain where it was known as Observation coach.Whitson RC35C built on Maudslay, Leyland, AEC, and Foden chassis between 1949 and 1952 (accessed March 10, 2013) The concept of two-level monocoque body had been used earlier in the Spanish Pegaso Z-403 two-axle coach, designed in 1949 and entered production in 1951.Pegaso Monocasco (monocoque) brochure 1951 accessed March 10, 2013 Overview The Model PD-4501 as GMC called it was the most distinctive American parlor bus design of the modern era. It was the result of seven years of effort by Greyhound and GM Truck and Coach Division. The first GX1 prototype was based on a design by Raymond Loewy as . Originally conceived as a bus, Greyhound later used a tandem-axle prototype by Loewy called the GX-2 to lobby for the lifting of length restrictions of buses longer than 35 feet in most states at the time. Power for the production models was originally provided by a pair of GM Diesel 4-71 four cylinder engines of 160 HP each connected by a fluid coupling. Two engines were necessary because GM had not yet built a V8 version of its Series 71 diesel engine. Each coach had a single three-speed transmission with a manual two-speed clutch for six forward speeds. There were some problems when the coaches were new because all of Greyhound's other models had four-speed manual transmissions that shifted differently than those in the Scenicruiser. This meant additional training for drivers, who mostly disliked the new system. This installation proved to be less than successful, and the 979 buses remaining in 1961-62 were rebuilt with 8V-71 engines and four-speed manual Spicer transmissions by the Marmon- Herrington Company. A preserved Scenicruiser on display in 2013 The first design prototype for the Scenicruiser, the GX1, was a double decker with access from the lower deck and the driver seated on the upper deck. It was soon decided that a split-level design would be better because the GX1 was too tall for many Greyhound garages and lacked luggage space for 50 people. The GX-2 had a lower level containing the driver's area and entrance with ten seats plus a restroom on the passenger's side and an upper level with 33 more seats. This arrangement also allowed a large baggage compartment underneath the second level. This design was called the GX-2. Both the GX1 and GX-2 were actually built by Greyhound from 1947 to 1949 with help from GMC. In late 1951, GMC started work on its first prototype, called the EXP 331. It was completed in 1954 and had some unique features that were not used on the production versions. After the last PD 4501 prototype was built, it was rebuilt as a production model with serial number PD 4501-1001. The Scenicruiser was equipped with air-ride suspension and air conditioning. The coaches were unusual in having ten wheels. Each of the two rear axles had four wheels but only the forward axle was powered. The Scenicruiser's popularity with the public inspired GM's later PD 4107 and PD 4903 Buffalo bus 35- and 40-foot models, which arrived nearly a decade later. They had a less obvious \\"second level\\" which ran most of the length of the coach, side windows from GMC's line of transit coaches and a smaller upper windshield in the front because the driver and first passenger seats were positioned higher. Unlike the Scenicruiser, these models were available for sale to all operators. Impact on the North American bus industry 1955 Flxible VistaLiner (VL100) =Problems= As introduced, the Scenicruiser had some significant problems, particularly the drivetrain and cracking of the frame structure around the side windows in the rear quarter of the coach. GMC was not about to put a non- GM engine into its flagship coach nor did it have a V8 version of its Series 71 diesel engine at the time. Therefore GM's solution was to use a pair of 4-71 engines. One Greyhound historian wrote of the Scenicruiser's early technical issues: > \\"Maintenance on the Scenicruiser was a constant headache ‚Äì partly because of > the complicated nature of some of the new systems (in the manner of Rube > Goldberg, some of the critics suggested), partly because some of the > components were too new and unimproved (using new, unproved, and unimproved > technology), partly because the diagnostic tools and techniques were > inadequate, partly because the training and availability of mechanics (and > maintenance supervisors and managers) for the new model were less than > optimum, partly because the technical support and repair-parts support were > less than optimum, and largely because of a combination of several of those > factors ‚Äì along with a few other explanations ‚Äì including, sadly, occasional > incidents of careless or intentional abuse of the new coaches by disgusted > drivers or mechanics.\\" GMC solved one major problem in the factory as the 1955 models were being produced. The original clutch was electrically operated. That meant the drivers could not make the clutch smoothly engage; it was either in or out. This caused lurches and jolts every time the driver started from a stop or changed gears. Both the passengers and drivers didn't like it. The electrical clutch linkage was replaced by a mechanical one which solved the problem. GMC gave Greyhound enough sets of parts to convert all of the previously made coaches. At the same time the windshield wipers were changed to a pantograph design which kept them in full contact with the glass at all times and this was also retrofitted to older coaches. The other problems were mostly solved starting in 1961 when all 979 Scenicruisers were rebuilt, costing Greyhound over $13 million. =Effects= The Scenicruiser caused GMC's top competitors, Flxible and Beck, to bring out similar offerings. Flxible introduced the semi deck and a half Vista-Liner 100, a 35-foot coach (208 produced between 1955 and 1959) and Beck produced three similar 35 foot coach models for a total of 29 coaches. Beck also built twelve 40 foot Scenicruiser lookalikes in 1955 powered by the 300 HP Cummins NHRBS diesel engine. They were Beck's model DH1040 and some were delivered new to Queen City Trailways (later Continental Southeastern Lines). Most of Beck's 40 foot coaches were sold to operators in Cuba and Mexico. Beck had to repossess several of them and they later returned to the United States and were resold as used buses. A number of Vista-Liner 100's and at least one of the later Becks have been converted to motorhomes and are still on the road. Mack Truck and Bus also produced a single model MV-620-D prototype in 1957 that was also 40 feet long but it found no takers even though Greyhound leased it for several months. This coach still exists in private hands in Ohio. Other two-level models introduced after the Scenicruiser were the Western Flyer T-36-2L,and the impressive four-axle twin- steer Sultana Crucero Imperial. The problems with the Scenicruisers greatly soured relations between Greyhound and GMC. Greyhound continued to buy GMC coaches with the PD 4104 up through 1960 and the PD 4106 from 1961 to 1964. Given the problems with the PD 4501, Greyhound had no interest in asking GMC to produce a second version of its signature coach based on the PD 4106's mechanicals and styling. Greyhound also bought some PD 4107 buses from GMC which were known as the \\"Buffalo\\" model. Greyhound purchased 362 of these buses in two orders (162 in 1966 and 200 more in 1967, with the 1966 units being trouble prone). The company never bought another GMC coach afterwards. In 1958 The Greyhound Corporation acquired a controlling interest in Motor Coach Industries (MCI), Limited, of Canada and by 1961 had full ownership of it. This led to the end of its need for GMC coaches by 1968. GMC's sales soon went into terminal decline as both Greyhound and Trailways were building their own coaches. Beck left the bus and coach market in 1957, a year after being taken over by Mack. In 1960 Mack left the market except for a short time as an importer of rebadged Renault FR1 coaches between 1986 and 1989. Flxible built its last intercity coach in 1969 and their final transit coach in 1995. GMC exited the new coach market after producing the 1980 models and continued transit coach manufacturing until 1987. Companion model GMC also introduced its model PD 4901 in 1954 so as to have a 40-foot model for non- Greyhound operators. It was mechanically identical to the Scenicruiser, but the driver and passengers were all at nearly the same high level as the Scenicruiser's upper deck. Like the PD 4104, the PD 4901 had a flat floor so the seats were a few inches lower than in the PD 4501 which allowed larger overhead baggage racks. The only one produced was clad in gold anodized aluminum and GMC called it the Golden Chariot. No American operators in the country wanted to take on the additional complexity and fuel consumption of this dual engine model. Greyhound's troubles with its Scenicruisers were already well known, keeping potential buyers away and none were ordered. GMC leased it to Greyhound and then to several other smaller carriers in the northeast and finally sold it as a used bus. This coach is currently owned by Wilson Bus Lines in Massachusetts who plan to restore it to its former glory. Super Scenicruiser In 1961 and 1962, Marmon-Herrington rebuilt the existing Scenicruiser fleet for Greyhound, 22 having already been totaled in accidents. The rebuild included installing the newly-available Detroit Diesel 8V-71 engine and a 4-speed unsynchronized Spicer manual transmission in place of the twin 4-71 engines and 3-speed transmission with 2-speed splitter. Side reinforcement plates above the rear wheels and below the upper deck windows under the skin were added. The interiors were also freshened up, but this was done by Greyhound. After the rebuilding the Super Scenicruiser name replaced the Scenicruiser name on the sides of each coach. In spite of the reinforcements, structural problems continued and the Scenicruisers that made it into the 1970s again had some external panels removed and further reinforcements added.

As of 2015, some of these remain, many converted to motorhomes. Other owners are committed bus enthusiasts who have restored their buses to like-new condition. A number of them were bought as used buses and ran in the colors of their new owners for some years after leaving Greyhound. A few even ended up wearing Trailways red and white as they were bought by Trailways affiliate carriers. The influence of the Scenicruiser may be seen in General Motors' 1964 Buick Sport Wagon and Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser station wagons, both of which had stepped-up roofs and a raised skylight over the second row of seats.HowStuffWorks.com article mentioning possibility of 1960s GM station wagons being inspired by Scenicruiser Retrieved 2011-06-18Eric Peters Autos page citing possible Scenicruiser heritage for the Vista Cruiser Retrieved 2011-06-18 Art, music and literature The Pulitzer Prize-winning novel A Confederacy of Dunces, by John Kennedy Toole, includes many obsessively sarcastic references by his main character to a trip in a Scenicruiser coach, which he recounts as a traumatic ordeal.

Scenicruiser 472, a 1955 model, gained regional fame as the tour bus for the Mission Mountain Wood Band from the mid-1970s to 1987. It was said to have traveled over two million miles and as of 2014, was still roadworthy.

The campaign was carried out by the armed forces of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) between 8 February and 25 March 1971, during the Vietnam War. The United States provided logistical, aerial, and artillery support to the operation, but its ground forces were prohibited by law from entering Laotian territory. The objective of the campaign was the disruption of a possible future offensive by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN), whose logistical system within Laos was known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail (the Truong Son Road to North Vietnam). By launching such a spoiling attack against PAVN's long-established logistical system, the American and South Vietnamese high commands hoped to resolve several pressing issues. A quick victory in Laos would bolster the morale and confidence of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), which was already high in the wake of the successful Cambodian Campaign of 1970. It would also serve as proof positive that South Vietnamese forces could defend their nation in the face of the continuing withdrawal of U.S. ground combat forces from the theater. The operation would be, therefore, a test of that policy and ARVN's capability to operate effectively by itself. Because of the South Vietnamese need for security which precluded thorough planning, an inability by the political and military leaders of the U.S. and South Vietnam to face military realities, and poor execution, Operation Lam Son 719 collapsed when faced by the determined resistance of a skillful foe. The campaign was a disaster for the ARVN, demonstrating deficiencies in ARVN military leaders and that the best units of the ARVN could be defeated by PAVNSpencer C. Tucker , p.2471 and destroying the confidence that had been built up over the previous three years. Background Between 1959 and 1970, the Ho Chi Minh Trail had become the key logistical artery for PAVN and the Viet Cong (VC), in their effort to conduct military operations to topple the U.S.-supported government of South Vietnam and create a unified nation. Running from the southwestern corner of North Vietnam through southeastern Laos and into the western portions of South Vietnam, the trail system had been the target of continuous U.S. aerial interdiction efforts that had begun in 1966. Only small-scale covert operations in support of the air campaigns had, however, been conducted on the ground inside Laos to halt the flow of men and supplies on the trail. Since 1966, over 630,000 men, 100,000 tons of foodstuffs, 400,000 weapons, and 50,000 tons of ammunition had traveled through the maze of gravel and dirt roads, paths, and river transportation systems that crisscrossed southeastern Laos. The trail also linked up with a similar logistical system in neighboring Cambodia known as the Sihanouk Trail. However, following the overthrow of Prince Norodom Sihanouk in 1970, the pro-American Lon Nol regime had denied the use of the port of Sihanoukville to communist shipping. Strategically, this was an enormous blow to the North Vietnamese effort, since 70 percent of all military supplies that supported its effort in the far south had moved through the port. A further blow to the logistical system in Cambodia had come in the spring and summer of 1970, when U.S. and ARVN forces had crossed the border and attacked PAVN/VC Base Areas during the Cambodian Campaign. With the partial destruction of the North Vietnamese logistical system in Cambodia, the U.S. headquarters in Saigon determined that the time was propitious for a similar campaign in Laos. If such an operation were to be carried out, the U.S. command believed, it would be best to do it quickly, while American military assets were still available in South Vietnam. Such an operation would create supply shortages that would be felt by PAVN/VC forces 12‚Äì18 months later, as the last U.S. troops were leaving South Vietnam and thereby give the U.S. and its ally a respite from a possible communist offensive in the northern provinces for one year, possibly even two. There were increasing signs of heavy communist logistical activity in southeastern Laos, activity which heralded just such a North Vietnamese offensive. Communist offensives usually took place near the conclusion of the Laotian dry season (from October through March) and, for PAVN logistical forces, the push to move supplies through the system came during the height of the season. One U.S. intelligence report estimated that 90 percent of PAVN materiel coming down the Ho Chi Minh Trail was being funneled into the three northernmost provinces of South Vietnam, indicating forward stockpiling in preparation for offensive action. This build-up was alarming to both Washington and the American command, and prompted the perceived necessity for a spoiling attack to derail future communist objectives. =Planning= Map showing the Ho Chi Minh Trail On 8 December 1970, in response to a request from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a highly secret meeting was held at the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam's (MACV) Saigon headquarters to discuss the possibility of an ARVN cross-border attack into southeastern Laos. According to General Creighton W. Abrams, the American commander in Vietnam, the main impetus for the offensive came from Colonel Alexander M. Haig, an aide to National Security Advisor Dr. Henry Kissinger. MACV had been disturbed by intelligence of a PAVN logistical build- up in southeastern Laos but was reluctant to let the ARVN go it alone against the North Vietnamese. The group's findings were then sent on to the Joint Chiefs in Washington, D.C. By mid-December, President Richard M. Nixon had also become intrigued by possible offensive actions in Laos and had begun efforts to convince both General Abrams and the members of his cabinet of the efficacy of a cross-border attack. Abrams felt that undue pressure was being exerted on Nixon by Haig, but Haig later wrote that the military was lacking in enthusiasm for such an operation and that \\"prodded remorselessly by Nixon and Kissinger, the Pentagon finally devised a plan\\" for the Laotian operation. Other possible benefits which might accrue from such an operation were also being discussed. Admiral John S. McCain Jr (CINCPAC) communicated with Admiral Thomas Moorer, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, that an offensive against the Ho Chi Minh Trail might compel Prince Souvanna Phouma, prime minister of Laos, \\"to abandon the guise of neutrality and enter the war openly.\\" Although technically neutral, the Laotian government had allowed the CIA and U.S. Air Force to conduct a covert war against an indigenous guerrilla insurgency (the Pathet Lao), that was, in turn, heavily supported by regular North Vietnamese forces. On 7 January 1971 MACV was authorized to begin detailed planning for an attack against PAVN Base Areas 604 and 611. The task was given to the commander of XXIV Corps, Lieutenant General James W. Sutherland, who had only nine days to submit it to MACV for approval. The operation would consist of four phases. During the first phase U.S. forces inside South Vietnam would seize the border approaches and conduct diversionary operations. Next would come an ARVN armored/infantry attack along Route 9 toward the Laotian town of Tchepone, the perceived nexus of Base Area 604. The village was estimated to have had about 1,500 inhabitants in 1960; five years later, half of the residents had fled due to war; Operation Lam Son 719 then destroyed the village and left it deserted. This advance would be protected by a series of leap-frogging aerial infantry assaults to cover the northern and southern flanks of the main column. During the third phase, search and destroy operations within Base Area 604 would be carried out and finally, the South Vietnamese force would retire either back along Route 9 or through Base Area 611 and exit through the A Shau Valley. It was hoped that the force could remain in Laos until the rainy season was underway at the beginning of May. U.S. planners had previously estimated that such an operation would require the commitment of four U.S. divisions (60,000 men), while Saigon would only commit a force half that size. Because of the notorious laxity of the South Vietnamese military when it came to security precautions and the uncanny ability of communist agents to uncover operational information, the planning phase lasted only a few weeks and was divided between the American and Vietnamese high commands. At the lower levels, it was limited to the intelligence and operational staffs of ARVN's I Corps, under Lieutenant General Ho√†ng Xu√¢n L√£m, who was to command the operation, and the XXIV Corps, headed by General Sutherland. When L√£m was finally briefed by MACV and the South Vietnamese Joint General Staff in Saigon, his chief of operations was forbidden to attend the meeting, even though he had helped to write the very plan under discussion. At this meeting, L√£m's operational area was restricted to a corridor no wider than on either side of Route 9 and a penetration no deeper than Tchepone. Command, control, and coordination of the operation was going to be problematic, especially in the highly politicized South Vietnamese command structure, where the support of key political figures was of paramount importance in promotion to and retention of command positions. Lieutenant General L√™ Nguy√™n Khang, the Vietnamese Marine Corps commander and protege of Vice President Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥, whose troops were scheduled to participate in the operation, actually outranked General L√£m, who had the support of President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu. The same situation applied to Lieutenant General D∆∞ Qu·ªëc ƒê·ªëng, commander of ARVN Airborne forces also scheduled to participate in the operation. After the incursion began, both men remained in Saigon and delegated their command authority to junior officers rather than take orders from L√£m. This did not bode well for the success of the operation. Individual units did not learn about their planned participation until 17 January. The Airborne Division that was to lead the operation received no detailed plans until 2 February, less than a week before the campaign was to begin. This was of crucial importance, since many of the units, particularly the Airborne and the Marines, had worked as separate battalions and brigades and had no experience maneuvering or cooperating in adjoining areas. According to the assistant commander of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division, \\"Planning was rushed, handicapped by security restrictions, and conducted separately and in isolation by the Vietnamese and the Americans.\\" The U.S. portion of the operation was to bear the title Dewey Canyon II, named for Operation Dewey Canyon conducted by U.S. Marines in the northwestern South Vietnam in 1969. It was hoped that the reference to the previous operation would confuse Hanoi as to the actual target of the proposed incursion. The ARVN's portion was given the title Lam Son 719, after the village of Lam Son, birthplace of the legendary Vietnamese patriot L√™ L·ª£i, who had defeated an invading Chinese army in 1427. The numerical designation came from the year, 1971, and the main axis of the attack, Route 9. The decisions had been made at the highest levels and planning had been completed, but valuable time had been lost. The South Vietnamese were about to begin their largest, most complex, and most important operation of the war. The lack of time for adequate planning and preparation, as well as the absence of any real questioning about military realities and the capabilities of the ARVN were going to prove decisive. On 29 January President Nixon gave his final approval for the operation. On the following day, Operation Dewey Canyon II was under way. Operations =Dewey Canyon II= Any offensive planning by the U.S. was, however, limited by the passage on 29 December 1970 of the Cooper-Church Amendment, which prohibited U.S. ground forces and advisors from entering Laos. Dewey Canyon II would, therefore, be conducted within territorial South Vietnam in order to reopen Route 9 all the way to the old Khe Sanh Combat Base, which had been abandoned by U.S. forces in 1968. The base would be reopened and would then serve as the logistical hub and airhead of the ARVN incursion. U.S. combat engineers were tasked with clearing Route 9 and rehabilitating Khe Sanh while infantry and mechanized units secured a line of communications along the length of the road. U.S. artillery units would support the ARVN effort within Laos from the South Vietnamese side of the border while Army logisticians coordinated the entire supply effort for the South Vietnamese. Air support for the incursion would be provided by the aircraft of the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, and U.S. Army aviation units were tasked with providing complete helicopter support for the ARVN. U.S. forces earmarked for these missions included: four battalions of the 108th Artillery Group; two battalions of the 45th Engineer Group; the 101st Airborne Division; six battalions of the 101st Aviation Group; the 1st Brigade of the 5th (Mechanized) Infantry Division (reinforced by two mechanized, one cavalry, one tank, and one airmobile infantry battalions; and the two battalions of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 23rd Infantry Division. Helicopters and supply vehicles at Khe Sanh, 12 February 1971 On the morning of 30 January, armor/engineer elements of the 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division headed west on Route 9 while the brigade's infantry elements were helilifted directly into the Khe Sanh area. By 5 February, Route 9 had been secured up to the Laotian frontier. Simultaneously, the 101st Airborne Division began a feint into the A Shau Valley in order to draw PAVN attention away from Khe Sanh. At the combat base, poor weather, obstacles, land mines, and unexploded ordnance pushed the rehabilitation of the airstrip (estimated by U.S. engineers at four days) a week behind schedule. As a response, a completely new airstrip had to be built and the first aircraft arrived on 15 February. PAVN resistance was almost nonexistent and American casualties were light; with no previous allied presence around Khe Sanh, the North Vietnamese had seen no need to maintain large forces in the area. However, General Sutherland believed that the advance to Khe Sanh had been a race between American and PAVN forces, and the U.S. had won. In order to preserve the security of the upcoming South Vietnamese operation, General Abrams had imposed a rare press embargo on the reporting of troop movements, but it was to no avail. Communist and non-American news agencies released reports of the build-up and even before the lifting of the embargo on 4 February, speculation concerning the offensive was front page news in the U.S. As had been the case during the Cambodian campaign, the government of Laos was not notified in advance of the intended operation. Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma would learn of the invasion of the PAVN occupied portions of his supposedly \\"neutral\\" nation only after it was under way. =Offensive= By early 1971, North Vietnamese troop strength in the Base Area 604 area was estimated by U.S. intelligence at 22,000 men: 7,000 combat troops, 10,000 personnel in logistical and support units, and 5,000 Pathet Lao, all under the command of the newly created 70th Front. There were differing views on what the expected reaction of PAVN to the offensive might be. General Abrams believed that unlike Cambodia, the North Vietnamese would stand and fight for the Laotian Base Areas. As early as 11 December he had reported to Admiral McCain that: > strong infantry, armor, and artillery formations were in southern > Laos...formidable air defenses were deployed...the mountainous, jungle- > covered terrain was an added liability. Natural clearings for helicopter > landing zones were scarce and likely to be heavily defended. The bulk of the > enemy's combat units were in the vicinity of Tchepone and PAVN could be > expected to defend his base areas and logistics centers against any allied > operation. A prescient CIA study released in December 1970 echoed Abrams' concerns and was supported by a 21 January memorandum which \\"was remarkably accurate with respect to the nature, pattern, and all-out intensity of [PAVN] reactions.\\" MACV intelligence, on the other hand was convinced that the incursion would be only lightly opposed. Tactical air strikes and artillery preparations would neutralize the estimated 170 to 200 anti-aircraft artillery weapons believed to be in the area, and the threat posed by PAVN armored units was considered minimal. North Vietnamese reinforcement capability was set at 14 days by two divisions north of the DMZ, and it was hoped that diversionary operations would occupy them for the duration of the operation. Unfortunately, when North Vietnamese reinforcements did arrive, they did not come from the north as expected, but from Base Area 611 and the A Shau Valley to the south, where eight regiments, all supported by organic artillery units, were within two weeks marching range. The North Vietnamese were expecting some sort of operation as early as 26 January when the text of an intercepted radio message read \\"It has been determined that the enemy may strike into our cargo carrier system in order to cut it off...Prepare to mobilize and strike the enemy hard. Be vigilant.\\" The tactical air strikes that were to precede the incursion and suppress known anti-aircraft positions were suspended two days prior to the operation due to poor flying weather. After a massive preliminary artillery bombardment and 11 B-52 Stratofortress missions, the incursion began on 8 February, when a 4,000-man ARVN armor/infantry task force consisting of the 3rd Armored Brigade and the 1st and 8th Airborne Battalions, advanced west unopposed along Route 9. To cover the northern flank, ARVN Airborne and Ranger elements were deployed to the north of the main advance. The 39th Ranger Battalion was helilifted into a Landing Zone (LZ) known as Ranger North () while the 21st Ranger Battalion moved into Ranger South (). These outposts were to serve as tripwires for any communist advance into the zone of the ARVN incursion. Meanwhile, the 2nd Airborne Battalion occupied Fire Support Base (FSB) 30 () while the 3rd Airborne Brigade Headquarters and the 3rd Airborne Battalion went into FSB 31 (). Troops of the 1st Infantry Division simultaneously combat assaulted into LZs Blue, Don, White, and Brown and FSBs Hotel, Delta and Delta 1, covering the southern flank of the main advance. The mission of the ARVN central column was to advance down the valley of the Se Pone River, a relatively flat area of brush interspersed with patches of jungle and dominated by heights to its north and the river and more mountains to the south. Almost immediately, supporting helicopters began to take fire from the heights, which allowed PAVN gunners to fire down on the aircraft from pre-registered machine gun and mortar positions. Making matters worse for the advance, Route 9 was in poor condition, so poor in fact that only tracked vehicles and jeeps could make the westward journey. This threw the burden of reinforcement and resupply onto the aviation assets. The helicopter units then became the essential mode of logistical support, a role that was made increasingly more dangerous due to low cloud cover and incessant anti-aircraft fire. M41 Walker Bulldog, the main battle tank of the ARVN The armored task force secured Route 9 all the way to Ban Dong (known to the Americans as A Luoi), 20 kilometers inside Laos and approximately halfway to Tchepone. By 11 February A Luoi had become the central fire base and command center for the operation. The plan then called for a quick ground thrust to secure the main objective, but South Vietnamese forces had stalled at A Loui while awaiting orders to proceed from General L√£m. Two days later, Generals Abrams and Sutherland flew to Lam's forward command post at ƒê√¥ng H√† in order to speed up the timetable. At the meeting of the generals, it was instead decided to extend the 1st Division's line of outposts south of Route 9 westward to cover the projected advance. This would take an additional five days. Back in Washington, Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird and the Joint Chiefs tried to refute claims by reporters that the South Vietnamese advance had stalled. At a press conference, Laird claimed that the halt at A Luoi was simply a \\"pause\\" that was giving ARVN commanders a chance to \\"watch and assess enemy movements...The operation is going according to plan.\\"\\"Indochina: Tough Times on the Trail\\"', Time Magazine, 8 March 1971. Response =Counteroffensive= The North Vietnamese response to the incursion was gradual. Hanoi's attention was riveted on another diversionary maneuver being conducted by a U.S. naval task force off the coast of the North Vietnam. This force conducted all of the maneuvers necessary for the carrying out of an amphibious landing only 20 kilometers off the city of Vinh. Hanoi's preoccupation with a possible invasion did not last long. Its B-70 Corps commanded three divisions in the incursion area, the 304th, 308th and 320th. The 2nd Division had also moved up from the south to the Tchepone area and then began to move east to meet the ARVN threat. By early March, Hanoi had massed 36,000 troops in the area, outnumbering the South Vietnamese force by two-to-one. The method chosen by PAVN to defeat the invasion was to first isolate the northern firebases by utilizing anti-aircraft artillery. The outposts would then be pounded by round-the-clock mortar, artillery, and rocket fire. Although the ARVN firebases were themselves equipped with artillery, their guns were quickly outranged by PAVN's Soviet-supplied 122mm and 130mm pieces, which simply stood off and pounded the positions at will. The defensive edge that could have been provided by the utilization of tactical B-52 bomber strikes was nullified by the close-in tactics of the PAVN. Massed ground attacks, supported by artillery and armor, would then finish the job. As early as 18 February, PAVN forces had begun attacks by fire on bases Ranger North and South. A UH-1H medevac helicopter from the 237th Medical Detachment was hit by PAVN fire and crash-landed at Ranger North: two of its crew were rescued by another helicopter while the crew chief Sp4c. Dennis J. Fuji was unable to reach the rescue helicopter due to fire and stayed at the base to assist the Rangers, providing medical assistance and directing US airstrikes. On 19 February, the attacks commenced against Ranger North conducted by the 102nd Regiment, 308th Division, supported by Soviet- built PT-76 and T-54 tanks. The ARVN held on tenaciously throughout the night. President Thieu, oblivious to the previous nights attacks, and who was visiting I Corps headquarters at the time, advised General L√£m to postpone the advance on Tchepone and to shift the focus of the operation toward the southwest. By the afternoon of the 20th, the 39th Ranger Battalion had been reduced from 500 to 323 men and its commander ordered a retreat toward Ranger South, six kilometers away.\\"Indochina: The Soft Sell Invasion\\", Time Magazine, 22 February 1971. Fuji and several Rangers were evacuated by helicopter but it was hit by PAVN fire and autorotated onto Ranger South. The crew was rescued but Fuji was again stranded on the ground. Only 109 survivors reached Ranger South by nightfall. Although more than 600 PAVN troops were estimated as killed during the action, casualties in the three-day fight totaled 75 percent of the ARVN battalion. North Vietnamese attention then shifted to Ranger South, where 400 ARVN troops, including the 109 survivors of Ranger North, held the outpost for another two days before General L√£m ordered them to fight their way five kilometers southeast to FSB 30. Fuji was evacuated from Ranger South on 22 February together with 122 wounded Rangers: he would later be awarded the Silver Star, later upgraded to a Distinguished Service Cross. Another casualty of the battle, although an indirect one, was South Vietnamese General ƒê·ªó Cao Tr√≠, commander of III Corps and hero of the Cambodian campaign. Ordered by President Thieu to take over for the outclassed L√£m, Tr√≠ died in a helicopter crash on 23 February while en route to his new command. That same day FSB Hotel 2 (), south of Route 9, also came under an intense artillery/infantry attack. It was evacuated on the following day. FSB 31 was the next ARVN position to fall under the hammer. Airborne Division commander General ƒê·ªëng had opposed stationing his elite paratroopers in static defensive positions and felt that his men's usual aggressiveness had been stifled. Vicious PAVN anti-aircraft fire made reinforcement and resupply of the firebase impossible. General ƒê·ªëng then ordered elements of the 17th Armored Squadron to advance north from A Luoi to reinforce the base. The armored force never arrived, due to conflicting orders from Generals L√£m and ƒê·ªëng that halted the armored advance several kilometers south of FSB 31. On 25 February the PAVN deluged the base with artillery fire and then launched a conventional armored/infantry assault. Smoke, dust and haze precluded observation by an American forward air control (FAC) aircraft, which was flying above to avoid anti-aircraft fire. When a U.S. Air Force F-4 Phantom jet was shot down in the area, the FAC left the area of the battle to direct a rescue effort for the downed aircraft crew, sealing the fate of the base. Ironically, the two pilots were not recovered by the search and rescue effort that had abandoned the firebase; instead, they wandered in the jungle for two more days before being picked up. At a meeting held at ƒê√¥ng H√† between Generals Sutherland and ƒê·ªëng, the Airborne commander railed against L√£m and the Americans for not supporting his forces adequately. He was supported in his allegations by Colonel Arthur Pence, the senior U.S. advisor to the Airborne Division. Sutherland, infuriated by Pence's open support of ƒê·ªëng, relieved him of his duties. PAVN troops and tanks then overran the position, capturing the ARVN brigade commander in the process. FSB 31 was secured by the PAVN at an estimated cost of 250 killed, and 11 PT-76 and T-54 tanks destroyed. The Airborne had suffered 155 killed and over 100 captured. T-55 tank FSB 30 lasted only about one week longer. Although the steepness of the hill on which the base was situated precluded armored attack, the PAVN artillery bombardment was very effective. By 3 March, the base's six 105mm and six 155mm howitzers had been put out of action. In an attempt to relieve the firebase, ARVN armor and infantry of the 17th Cavalry moved out to save their comrades. In the five days between 25 February, the day FSB 31 fell, and 1 March, three major engagements took place. With the help of air strikes, ARVN destroyed 17 PT-76 and six T-54 tanks at a loss of three of its five M41 tanks and 25 armored personnel carriers (APC)s. On 3 March, the South Vietnamese column encountered a PAVN battalion without supporting armor and, with the assistance of B-52 strikes, killed 400 PAVN. U.S. Army Bell AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters over Laos During each of the above mentioned attacks on the firebases and relief column, PAVN forces suffered horrendous numbers of casualties from aircraft and armed helicopter attacks, artillery bombardment, and small arms fire. In each instance, however, the attacks were pressed home with a professional competence and determination that both impressed and shocked those that observed them. William D. Morrow, Jr., an advisor with the ARVN Airborne Division during the incursion, was succinct in his appraisal of North Vietnamese forces ‚Äì \\"they would have defeated any army that tried the invasion.\\" According to the official PAVN history, by March the North Vietnamese had managed to amass three infantry divisions (2nd, 304th, 308th), the 64th Regiment of the 320th Division and two independent infantry regiments (27th and 28th), eight regiments of artillery, three engineer regiments, three tank battalions, six anti-aircraft battalions, and eight sapper battalions ‚Äì approximately 35,000 troops, in the battle area. =On to Tchepone= While the main South Vietnamese column stalled at A Luoi for three weeks and the Ranger and Airborne elements were fighting for their lives, President Thieu and General L√£m decided to launch a face-saving airborne assault on Tchepone itself. Although American leaders and news correspondents had focused on the town as one of Lam Son 719's main objectives, the PAVN logistical network actually bypassed the ruined town to the west. If South Vietnamese forces could at least occupy Tchepone, however, Thieu would have a political excuse for declaring \\"victory\\" and withdrawing his forces to South Vietnam. Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu, President of the Republic of Vietnam There has been some historical speculation as to Thieu's original intentions for Lam Son 719. Some believed that he may have originally ordered his commanders to halt the operation when casualties reached 3,000 and that he had always wanted to pull out at the moment of \\"victory\\", presumably the taking of Tchepone, in order to gain political capital for the upcoming fall general and presidential elections. Regardless, the decision was made to conduct the assault not with the armored task force, but with elements of the 1st Division. That meant that the occupation of the firebases south of Route 9 had to be taken over by Marine Corps forces, which lost even more valuable time. Both Abrams and Sutherland wanted the South Vietnamese to remain in Laos, reinforce the embattled units, and fight a major battle then and there. General Alexander Haig, Nixon's personal military adviser, visited Sutherland in the field and noted Washington's agreement on this point as American fire support might not be available in some later battle, but the Vietnamese were hesitant. The assault began on 3 March, when elements of the 1st Division were helilifted into two firebases (Lolo and Sophia) and LZ Liz, all south of Route 9. Eleven helicopters were shot down and another 44 were damaged as they carried one battalion into FSB Lolo () Three days later, 276 UH-1 helicopters protected by Cobra gunships and fighter aircraft, lifted the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 2nd Regiment from Khe Sanh to Tchepone ‚Äì the largest helicopter assault of the Vietnam War. Only one helicopter was downed by anti-aircraft fire as the troops combat assaulted into LZ Hope, four kilometers northeast of Tchepone.The new bases were named for actresses whose names American aviators would be familiar with: Gina Lollobrigida, Sophia Loren, Elizabeth Taylor, and Hope Lang. For two days the two battalions searched Tchepone and the immediate vicinity, but found little but the bodies of PAVN soldiers killed by air strikes. PAVN responded by increasing its daily artillery bombardments of the firebases, notably Lolo and Hope. =Retreat= Their goal in Laos seemingly achieved, President Thieu and General L√£m ordered a withdrawal of ARVN forces beginning on 9 March that was to continue through the rest of the month, destroying Base Area 604 and any supplies discovered in their path. General Abrams implored Thieu to reinforce the troops in Laos and that they keep disrupting the area until the beginning of the rainy season. By the time this request was made, South Vietnam possessed only one Marine brigade in its entire national reserve. Thieu responded to Abrams by requesting that U.S. forces be deployed to Laos, knowing that such an option was impossible. The battle was shifting to Hanoi's advantage. Anti-aircraft fire remained devastating and the PAVN had no trouble resupplying or reinforcing their troops in the battle area. As soon as it became evident that ARVN forces had begun a withdrawal, the PAVN increased its efforts to destroy them before they could reach South Vietnam. Anti-aircraft fire was increased to halt or slow helicopter resupply or evacuation efforts, the undermanned firebases were attacked, and ARVN ground forces had to run a gauntlet of ambushes along Route 9. Fire Support Base Lolo falls to PAVN forces Only a well-disciplined and coordinated army could have executed an orderly withdrawal in the face of such a determined enemy and the South Vietnamese force in Laos was neither. The retreat quickly devolved into a rout. One by one, the isolated firebases were closed out or overrun by the PAVN and each withdrawal was costly. On 21 March, South Vietnamese Marines at FSB Delta (), south of Route 9, came under intense ground and artillery attacks. During an attempted extraction of the force, seven helicopters were shot down and another 50 were damaged, ending the evacuation attempt. The Marines finally broke out of the encirclement and marched to the safety of FSB Hotel, which was then hastily abandoned. During the extraction of the 2nd ARVN Regiment, 28 of the 40 helicopters participating were damaged. The armored task force fared little better, losing many of its vehicles to breakdowns or ambushes. During the retreat, the task force lost 60 percent of its tanks and half of its APCs. It also abandoned 54 105mm and 28 155mm howitzers. This equipment then had to be destroyed by U.S. aircraft in order to prevent its capture and reuse by the PAVN. Covering the retreat on Route 9 was the 1st Armored Brigade, which had been assigned to the ARVN Airborne Division. When informed by a prisoner that two PAVN regiments waited in ambush ahead, the commander of the brigade, Colonel Nguyen Trong Luat, notified General ƒê·ªëng of the situation. The Airborne commander airmobiled forces in and cleared the road, but never bothered to inform Colonel Luat. In order to avoid destruction on Route 9, Luat then ordered the column to abandon the road only from the South Vietnamese border and plunged onto a jungle trail looking for an unguarded way back. Mortar impacts near two AH-1G Cobra helicopters from HMLA-367, Khe Sanh Combat Base The trail came to a dead end at the steep banks of the Se Pone River and the force was trapped. The PAVN closed in and savage rearguard actions ensued. Two bulldozers were finally helilifted into the ARVN perimeter to create a ford, and the survivors of the force crossed into South Vietnam on 23 March. On the night of 23 March, a PAVN sapper attack on Khe Sanh resulted in 3 Americans killed and several aircraft and 2 ammunition dumps destroyed, PAVN losses were 14 killed and 1 captured. By the 25th, 45 days after the beginning of the operation, the remainder of the South Vietnamese force that had survived had left Laos. The forward base at Khe Sanh had also come under increasing artillery bombardment and, by 6 April, it was abandoned and Operation Lam Son 719 was over.DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY ‚Äì HEADQUARTERS ‚Äì 8TH BTTALI0N (17MM/8 Inch) (SP), 4TH ARTILLERY, May 9th 1971Narrative of Events of Company B, 2nd Battalion, 506th Infantry, 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile) During LAM SON 719 Aftermath During a 7 April televised speech, President Nixon claimed that \\"Tonight I can report that Vietnamization has succeeded.\\" At ƒê√¥ng H√†, South Vietnam, President Thieu addressed the survivors of the incursion and claimed that the operation in Laos was \\"the biggest victory ever.\\" Although Lam Son 719 had set back North Vietnamese logistical operations in southeastern Laos,, \\"Lam Son 719, though it was less than a signal success, forestalled a Communist offensive in the spring of 1971.\\" truck traffic on the trail system increased immediately after the conclusion of the operation. Truck sightings in the Route 9 area reached 2,500 per month post the offensive, numbers usually seen only during peak periods. The American command's claims of success were more limited in scope: MACV claimed that 88 PAVN tanks had been destroyed during the operation (59 by tactical air power), plus 670 anti- aircraft guns and 600 trucks. It also fully understood that the operation had exposed grave deficiencies in South Vietnamese \\"planning, organization, leadership, motivation, and operational expertise.\\" For the North Vietnamese, the Route 9 ‚Äì Southern Laos Victory, was viewed as a complete success. The PAVN claimed to have eliminated 20,000 enemy, destroyed 1,100 vehicles (including 528 tanks and APCs) and more than 100 artillery pieces, shot down 505 helicopters and captured over 1,000 prisoners, 3,000 weapons, six tanks and APCs and large quantities of radios, ammunition and other equipment. The military expansion of the Ho Chi Minh Trail to the west which had begun in 1970 at the expense of Laotian forces, was quickly accelerated. Laotian troops were soon withdrawing toward the Mekong River and a logistical artery in width was soon expanded to . Another result of the operation was a firm decision by the Politburo to launch a major conventional invasion of South Vietnam in early 1972, paving the way for the Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá Offensive, known in the west as the Easter Offensive. During Lam Son 719, the U.S. planners had believed that any North Vietnamese forces that opposed the incursion would be caught in the open and decimated by the application of American aerial might, either in the form of tactical airstrikes or airmobility, which would provide ARVN troops with superior battlefield maneuvering capability. Firepower, as it turned out, was decisive, but \\"it went in favor of the enemy... Airpower played an important, but not decisive role, in that it prevented a defeat from becoming a disaster that might have been so complete as to encourage the North Vietnamese army to keep moving right into Quang Tri Province.\\" The number of helicopters destroyed or damaged during the operation shocked the proponents of U.S. Army aviation and prompted a reevaluation of basic airmobile doctrine. The 101st Airborne Division alone, for example, had 84 of its aircraft destroyed and another 430 damaged. During Lam Son 719 American helicopters had flown more than 160,000 sorties and 19 U.S. Army aviators had been killed, 59 were wounded, and 11 were missing at its conclusion. South Vietnamese helicopters had flown an additional 5,500 missions. U.S. Air Force tactical aircraft had flown more than 8,000 sorties during the incursion and had dropped 20,000 tons of bombs and napalm. B-52 bombers had flown another 1,358 sorties and dropped 32,000 tons of ordnance. Seven U.S. fixed-wing aircraft were shot down over southern Laos: six from the Air Force (two dead/two missing) and one from the Navy (one aviator killed).

He had a profound impact on the development of psychological personality testing, and was an important pioneer and innovator in the development, scoring and popularization of projective techniques, especially the Rorschach inkblot test. Career He was awarded a Ph.D. from the University of Munich in 1923.His dissertation was entitled The Psychology of Inhibition. Klopfer, a Jew, left Germany in 1933; and on his way to the USA, spent a year in Switzerland where he studied with Carl Jung at the Zurich Psychotechnic Institute (this was where he first encountered the Rorschach test). His first job in the USA was at Columbia University where he conducted research with the famous anthropologist Franz Boas. He was founding editor of the Rorschach Research Exchange and Journal of Projective Techniques in 1936. This Journal became the \\"Journal of Projective Techniques\\" in 1950, The Journal of Projective Techniques & Personality Assessment in 1963, and eventually became the Journal of Personality Assessment in 1971. He was the Director of the Rorschach Institute from 1939 to 1947, and was the President of the Society of Projective Techniques from 1947 until his death in 1971. In 1947, he was appointed Clinical Professor of Psychology at the University of California at Los Angeles. He remained at UCLA until he retired in 1963. Klopfer performed workshops on the interpretation of the Rorschach test. Mary Ainsworth, a major contributor to the development of attachment theory, attended one of these workshops. The meeting led to Klopfer and Ainsworth collaborating to coauthor a book on the Rorschach technique Bretherton, 1992.

The game was released on 22 September 2015 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4 and on 1 December 2017 on Xbox One. Soma takes place on an underwater remote research facility that contains machinery which are exhibiting human characteristics, such as consciousness. Simon Jarrett, a fish-out-of-water protagonist, finds himself there under mysterious circumstances and embarks upon discovering its history, while trying to make sense of his predicament and potential future. Somas gameplay builds on the conventions established in the previous horror titles of Frictional Games, including an emphasis on stealthy evasion of threats, puzzle-solving and immersion. However, in a break with this tradition, it also de-emphasizes aspects such as inventory management in favour of a tighter focus on narrative. Soma received positive reviews from critics, who applauded its story and voice acting, although its enemy design and encounters received some criticism.  Gameplay  Soma is a survival horror video game played from a first-person perspective. The player will encounter a number of creatures, which each embody an aspect of the game's themes. Soma primarily utilizes elements of psychological horror instead of conventional scares found in most video games within the genre. Throughout the game, the player will find a large array of clues, such as notes and audio tapes, which builds atmosphere and furthers the plot. Similar to most titles by Frictional Games, the player progresses through puzzle-solving, exploration, and the use of stealth; the player may die if they fail to avoid monsters, although two years after the initial release, a \\"Safe Mode\\" has been added that keeps the monsters but stops them from killing the player. Plot =Setting= Soma takes place in an underwater research facility known as PATHOS-II in the year 2104. While the station itself has fallen into disrepair by the start of the game, PATHOS-II was a sophisticated research outpost located in the North Atlantic Ocean. Originally established as a thermal mining operation in the 2060s by Japanese conglomerate Haimatsu and European conglomerate Carthage Industries, the facility‚Äôs primary purpose shifted to space technology and operation of the Omega Space Gun ‚Äì an electromagnetic railgun designed to launch satellites and other small equipment into orbit without the cost or risks of traditional rockets. All operations and maintenance on PATHOS-II are overseen by the Warden Unit (WAU), an artificial general intelligence integrated with all computer systems in the facility. The crew of PATHOS-II unexpectedly became the last people to exist on Earth after a major extinction event caused by a comet striking the planet. There, the last humans survived on a day-to-day basis, attempting to fight the negative effects of their collective isolation, as well as other issues that began to pose a credible threat to their well-being. =Story= In 2015, protagonist Simon Jarrett survives a car accident, but sustains severe brain damage and cranial bleeding. Due to his injuries, Simon agrees to undergo an experimental brain scan under the control of graduate student David Munshi. During the scan, Simon appears to black out, and regains consciousness on Site Upsilon of PATHOS-II, an apparently-abandoned submarine research center. Exploring Upsilon, Simon establishes a connection with a woman named Catherine Chun, who invites him to Site Lambda and reveals that he has awoken in the year 2104, one year after a comet devastated the Earth and left PATHOS-II as the final outpost of humanity. Along the way, Simon encounters robots that believe they are human and bypasses hostile robots and mutants. Arriving at Site Lambda, Simon discovers that Catherine is not human, but a brain scan of a PATHOS-II employee downloaded into a storage unit. Simon himself is the result of his brain scan from 2015 being uploaded into the modified corpse of another PATHOS-II employee by an artificial intelligence named the Warden Unit (WAU), which took control of the center and turned all the surviving humans into bio- mechanical mutants to fulfill its task of preserving humanity. The sole means of anything of human origin escaping Earth is the ARK, a digital black box designed by Catherine that houses a simulated world in which the brain scans of all the PATHOS-II personnel have been preserved. Despite its completion, the ARK has not yet been sent into space. Simon agrees to aid Catherine in recovering the ARK and completing her mission. As the ARK is kept in the Tau site at the absolute depths of the Atlantic Ocean, Simon heads toward the Theta site to retrieve a submarine named DUNBAT that can withstand the abyssal pressure. Unfortunately, the WAU has preemptively tampered with the DUNBAT, forcing Simon to move to the Omicron site to create a new body capable of traveling through the seabed. While searching for the essential components at Omicron, Simon receives mental messages from PATHOS-II's artificial intelligence specialist Johan Ross, who begs him to destroy the WAU. Upon the completion of Simon's new body, Catherine copies Simon's consciousness into it, resulting in Simon having to choose between euthanizing the Simon in his old body or leaving him to whatever fate befalls him. Descending into the abyss, Simon retrieves the ARK from the Tau site and takes it toward the Phi site, where the Omega space cannon is located. However, he is forced to take a detour through the Alpha site, where the WAU's core is hidden. Here, Ross reveals to Simon that the structural gel with which he created his new body was designed by Ross to poison and destroy the WAU, and that his colleagues refused to use it in time. Ross gives Simon the opportunity to eliminate the WAU, while secretly planning to kill him to prevent the WAU from adapting to Simon's immunity. Before he can do so, Ross is devoured by an aquatic leviathan, from which Simon escapes by reaching the Phi site. At the Phi site, Catherine copies Simon's and her brain scans into the ARK at the last moment before it is launched into space. When Simon is confused as to why the two remained on Earth despite their accomplishment, Catherine explains that it is their copies that inhabit the ARK. The two of them argue about the nature of their mission until Catherine's cortex chip short-circuits from exertion, effectively killing her. Simon is left helpless and alone in the darkness of the abyss. In a post-credits scene, the version of Simon copied to the ARK awakes and reunites with Catherine in an idyllic landscape. Meanwhile, the ARK drifts off into space and leaves the devastated Earth behind.  Development  Thomas Grip of Frictional Games presents Soma at the 2016 Game Developers Conference. Soma was in the making since 2010, beginning with the advancement of new technology for the game engine. Setting the game at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean was an idea decided on a \\"whim\\" by Frictional Games co-founders Thomas Grip and Jens Nilsson, which Grip said they had wanted to try for a long time. The storytelling was designed to rely on the player's actions rather than serve as a guide for the player to adhere to, so as to allow those who ignore exposition material, such as audio logs and notes, to follow the plot. Somas underlying theme is consciousness, and was developed in order to explore the nature of free will and the self. The game's atmosphere was inspired by the work of Philip K. Dick, China Mi√©ville and Greg Egan. Achieving a realistic sound to fit the mood required audio director Samuel Justice to utilise what he called \\"the room size system\\". Instead of processing sounds to make an effect possible, recordings were made of environments that complemented such needs, like the reverb of a large hall. With this system, over 2,000 footstep sounds were captured.  Marketing  A teaser trailer featuring gameplay footage of Soma was released on 11 October 2013. The official website's info page displays a quote by author Philip K. Dick. Another trailer of the game was released on 3 April 2014. Two live action shorts, \\"Vivarium\\" and \\"Mockingbird\\" were shot back-to-back at LeftJet Studios in Seattle, over the course of nine days. The films were produced by Imagos Films, an independent film company based in Seattle. Imagos Films also completed for Frictional Games a set of live action clips that were set to release in 2015 in monthly installments and would connect to the story of the upcoming game. Due to production problems the release date was delayed and on 28 September 2015, shortly after the release of the game, Frictional Games announced they had made available the first clip on their YouTube channel under the title \\"SOMA - Transmission #1\\", with seven more to follow in each coming day. The live action miniseries acts a prequel to the events of the game, albeit one which is inspired by its plot and characters rather than being strictly canonical to it. In collaboration with Frictional Games, a feature film tentatively called \\"DEPTH\\" was filmed by Imagos Films under the code name \\"Project Apophis\\". The film's director is Don Thacker and clips from it were used for Soma's marketing campaign such as the \\"Transmissions\\" webseries. The film was expected to release in 2016.  Reception  Soma received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to review aggregator website Metacritic. In 2018, GamesRadar ranked the game 9th in their list of \\"the 20 best horror games of all time\\". Richard Wakeling from GameSpot gave the game a 9 out of 10, and praised the \\"engaging and thought-provoking\\" story, the \\"impressive\\" writing and voice acting, and the atmosphere and sound design, which together, fills the game with \\"dread\\" and provides a \\"chilling\\", \\"edge of your seat\\" feeling. However, Wakeling disliked the sections in which the player walks on the ocean floor, calling them \\"dull, plodding affairs\\" and \\"incredibly linear\\". Philip Kollar of Polygon also gave the game a 9/10 and wrote: \\"I don't know if SOMA will scare people as much as Amnesia did, but it is without a doubt a stronger game, with better pacing, smarter writing and more powerful subject matter. This isn't a horror game about obfuscation; events aren't building to a huge, shocking twist. More than anything, it's about the process of dealing with the horror of reality.\\" Caitlin Cooke from Destructoid awarded the game a 9/10 as well. She stated \\"SOMA gets everything right about the survival horror genre. It‚Äôs like someone created the perfect video game mixtape -- a little bit of abandoned underwater atmosphere from BioShock, detailed environments a la Gone Home, and (of course) the frenzied monster mechanics from Amnesia. Even if you dislike non-combat-oriented games, I dare you to give it a try.\\" Tim Turi from Game Informer awarded the game an 8.5 out of 10. He commended the sound for convincingly immersing the player in the game, as well as the \\"eerie\\" environments, the \\"simple\\", \\"reliable\\" controls, and the \\"intriguing\\" narrative. In his review for GamesRadar, Leon Hurley wrote: \\"A disturbingly different take on interesting sci-fi concepts let down by a slow start ... but worth it overall.\\" Hurley praised the \\"great\\" story, \\"likeable\\" characters, and the \\"interesting and unpredictable\\" locations. He also commended the game for its ability to pull the player through the story by providing rewarding situations, although Hurley did feel \\"lost\\" at times, as there are no distinct directions. IGN's Daniel Krupa scored the game an 8.1/10 and wrote: \\"SOMA is a sustained exploration of an original and thought-provoking idea. The concept of artificial intelligence has been explored by lots of science fiction, so it isn‚Äôt unique in that regard, but it makes particularly intelligent use of video game conventions to present those familiar ideas in new and surprising ways.\\" Criticism of Soma focused on the implementation and design of its enemies. While Cooke generally enjoyed the monster encounters and their \\"unique and frightening\\" designs, she felt disappointed that there were only a few different types, most of which only made one appearance in the game. Turi found that the game's cat and mouse gameplay of stealthily evading monsters now felt \\"formulaic\\" in the genre and \\"required patience\\". Wakeling wrote that while the encounters were necessary to provide adversity, he felt they were otherwise \\"tedious\\" and found himself \\"clambering to get back to the story.\\" Hurley wrote that the monsters lacked \\"threat\\" and \\"never really deliver ... they‚Äôre little more than dumb ambulatory obstacles\\", being overcome by the player \\"looping around behind them, or slipping past while they obediently investigate thrown objects.\\" Alex Avard of GamesRadar praised the game's \\"Safe Mode\\" update from 2017 that decreased the threat of the monsters, having felt they were originally \\"unwelcome interruptions to an otherwise enthralling mystery\\", but instead in Safe Mode gave the \\"high minded story the space it always needed to breath\\". He wrote that the enemies' typically passive behavior and discernible forms improved the game's atmosphere and themes while allowing him to fully engage in the narrative, writing \\"I‚Äôm no longer beset with frustrated paranoia or constantly distracted by my own survival instincts. Instead, my attention is entirely focused on engaging with Simon‚Äôs personal journey and learning more about the history of PATHOS-II.\\" After ten days of release, Soma had sold 92,000 copies, exceeding the 20,000 copies made by the developer's previous game Amnesia: The Dark Descent in its first week. In March 2016, Frictional Games announced that the game had sold more than 250,000 copies and that the company was close to breaking even, which required them to sell 276,000 units. In a blog post commemorating one year of release, Frictional Games estimated that the sales figures had exceeded 450,000 copies. At the 2016 Golden Joystick Awards, Soma was nominated for three categories: Best Original Game, Best Story Telling and Best Visual Design.

Playing career After two abortive attempts at Lincoln City, Cockerill had a spell in the Royal Air Force and as a lorry driver, whilst continuing to play non- league football. In 1988, he was signed by Grimsby from Stafford Rangers for ¬£21,500.Electronic Fishcake Player Profile The highlight of his playing career with Grimsby, was the two goals he scored in 1991 against Exeter City in the last game of the season to secure promotion to Division Two. The end of his career came with a broken leg in 1991 against Bristol City; despite trying to regain full fitness, Cockerill never played another game. Coaching career Cockerill remained with Grimsby Town following his retirement and spent time at the club in various positions such as the Community Coach, Youth Coach and Reserve Team Manager. In 1994 he became caretaker manager following the resignation of Alan Buckley who had joined West Bromwich Albion.

At this site the remains of the Elamite city of Kabnak were discovered in 1908, and excavations are still carried out.  History  The city of Kabnak is mentioned as an important political centre during the reign of the Elamite king Tepti-Ahar, the last king of the Kidinuid dynasty ruling in the 15th century BC. He may also have been buried in the city. After his death the centre of power returned to the old capital Susa, although there is no clear evidence that Kabnak ever held real power at all. Due to the turmoil of this era it is possible the construction of Kabnak was necessary after Tepti-Ahar lost control over Susa, however this theory has not been completely confirmed by solid proof.Van De Mieroop, Marc: \\"A History of the Ancient Near East, ca. 3000-323 BC\\", page 185. Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Some centuries later another city was built at the nearby site of Choqa Zanbil. Excavations at Haft Tepe revealed a large temple founded by Tepti-Ahar where the god Kirwashir was worshiped. Beneath the temple lay a subterranean funerary complex intended for the king and his family. Skeletal remains were found in the tomb, though it is not certain they belong to royalty.

The temple complex was decorated with bronze plates and wall paintings. Administrative texts belonging to the reigns of Tepti-Ahar and Inshushinak- zunkir-nappipir were also found at the site. Recently some clay statuettes of fertility goddesses have been unearthed at the site.  Archaeology  The site is around 1.5 km by 800 meters made up of 14 mounds with the highest being 17 meters high.

He owned half of the company's 6,000 shares. Konsojaya was a shell company cofounded by Riduan Isamuddin, better known as \\"Hambali\\", in June 1994. As of January 2002, Shabana's whereabouts were still unknown. Hambali, now in U.S. custody since 2003, was the leader of the southeast Asia terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah, which later became associated with al-Qaeda, along with Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines. Hambali was also a close friend of the later al-Qaeda 9/11 mastermind, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, also now in U.S. custody since 2003. Mohammed in turn had become one of the original 22 FBI Most Wanted Terrorists, indicted for his role in the planning of the 1995 terrorist plot named Operation Bojinka, to bomb eleven U.S. airliners. It was accidentally discovered and foiled in Manila, Philippines. The Bojinka bombs were in the process of being constructed by Mohammed's nephew, Ramzi Yousef, who was, by then, already wanted by the United States Department of Justice as one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives for his own earlier role in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Another Afghan named Wali Khan Amin Shah was also one of the board of directors of the Konsojaya company. He owned the other half (3,000) of the company's 6,000 shares. Another member was 30-year-old Hemeid H. Algamdi, of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The Yemeni man Amein Mohamed was the managing director of Konsojaya. Konsojaya stated in its incorporation papers that it was an \\"import/export\\" company that shipped palm oil to Afghanistan from Malaysia. The organization also dealt with the export of Sudanese honey. Konsojaya actually funneled money and material assistance to several regional militant Islamic plots. The organization also funneled money to an account owned by Omar Abu Omar, an employee of the International Relations and Information Centre, an organization run by Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, who is married to one of Osama bin Laden's sisters. The money was then be siphoned into an account under the name of \\"Adam Salih\\", an alias of Ramzi Yousef, who was at the time planning the Bojinka attack. According to corporate records in Kuala Lumpur, Konsojaya no longer exists. Rodolfo Mendoza, the former head of Philippine counter-terrorism who led the Bojinka investigation, said in a telephone interview in January 2002 that \\"Konsojaya was the nerve center not only for business but also for operational supervision [of the Bojinka plot],\\" and \\"was formed for the purpose of terrorist activity.\\" \\"The most important was Wali Khan and the board of directors in Malaysia,\\" he claimed, although \\"Ramzi Yousef was considered the most important,\\" Mendoza said. \\"But it is the other way around.\\" Shabana's co-owner of Konsojaya, Wali Khan Amin Shah, in U.S. custody, went on trial in 1996, and is serving a life sentence. As of January 2002, the other Konsojaya directors, including Shabana, were still at large.

The club was founded in 1893 and currently play in the Championnat National 3, the fifth level of French football. Mulhouse plays its home matches at the Stade de l'Ill located within the city. Mulhouse was founded under the name Fussball-Club M√ºlhausen in what was then M√ºlhausen, Alsace-Lorraine in Germany. The club's location has been dependent on the control of the Alsace region between France and Germany. Mulhouse has played in French football since the re-acquisition of the region after World War II and is the second-oldest football club in France after Le Havre AC. The club has achieved minimal honours in its history having spent most of its existence playing in the amateur divisions of France. However, Mulhouse have spent seven seasons in Ligue 1 and 27 seasons in Ligue 2. The club's highest honour to date in France was winning the Division d'Honneur in 1928. Regionally, Mulhouse has won the Alsace Division d'Honneur seven times. During the club's stint in Germany, it won the Gauliga Elsa√ü three times. Mulhouse has served as a springboard for several football players and managers, most notably Ars√®ne Wenger and Raymond Domenech. Wenger started his playing career at the club before becoming a manager. In the managerial role he is known for his time at English club Arsenal, but prior to that had successful stints at Nancy, AS Monaco, and Nagoya Grampus. Domenech also played for Mulhouse, and he had his first managerial spell there. He later went on to manage the France national team from 2004 to 2010.  History  Football Club de Mulhouse was founded in 1893 under the name Fussball Club M√ºlhausen by two young Englishmen enrolled at the Mulhouse Chemistry School in M√ºlhausen, Alsace-Lorraine, in Germany. The students introduced the sport to their fellow students, and a club was subsequently formed. In 1901, they were joined by a group of footballers known as the \\"Young Boys\\" from the Oberrealschule Gymnasium. The club was a member of the VSFV (German: Verband S√ºddeutscher Fussball Vereine or Federation of South German Football Clubs) by 1904; it suffered a financial crisis in 1905‚Äì06, but survived. France reclaimed the territory of Alsace from Germany after World War I, and FC M√ºlhausen became part of the regional top flight Division d'Honneur ‚Äì Alsace as FC Mulhouse (FCM) where the club captured the division title in 1921 and finished as vice-champions in 1926. FCM then put together a string of five consecutive division titles from 1928 to 1932. The 1932 regional title was parlayed into a win in the Coupe Sochaux, also known as the Challenge Peugeot, one of the predecessors of the national championship competition first staged the following season. After the re-organization of French football into a national system, FCM played a single season in the First Division/Group A before being relegated. They played their way back to the top flight in 1934 until again being relegated in 1937. With the onset of World War II and the re-conquest of Alsace by Germany, FCM returned to that country's football competition in the regional first division Gauliga Elsa√ü in 1941. They quickly became the dominant side there capturing titles in 1941, 1943, and 1944, but were not able to follow up with any success in the German national championship playoff rounds, being eliminated in the early going on each occasion. Play in the Gauliga was suspended part-way through the 1944‚Äì45 season as Allied armies advanced into Germany. Following the war, FCM was once again returned to French football to play a single season in the second division before slipping to amateur level play, where they would remain until 1970. The club struggled through six seasons in the second division over the course of the decade. However, its performance improved in the 1980s, and FCM became a solid second division side, earning single-season turns in the top flight in 1982‚Äì83 and 1989‚Äì90. Through the early 1990s the club played as FC Mulhouse Sud-Alsace and continued to play second-tier football until relegated in 1998. A financial crisis followed and the club was bankrupted in 1999; it re-organised as an amateur side the following season. In 2005 the club was promoted from the CFA 2 (V) to the third division CFA (Championnat de France), the country's highest class. In 2020, the club was administratively relegated from Championnat National 2 due to financial issues, despite finishing 12th in its group. Stadium Since 1979, FC Mulhouse has played its home games at the Stade de l'Ill. Between 1906 and the end of World War I the team played in the Stade V√©lodrome and, after the war, in the Stade de Bourtzwiller.

Released to cinemas in the United States on December 22, 1939 by Paramount Pictures, the story is a very loose adaptation of Jonathan Swift's 1726 novel of the same name, specifically the first part which tells the story of Lilliput and Blefuscu, and centers around an explorer who helps a small kingdom who declared war after an argument over a wedding song. The film was the Fleischer Studios' first feature-length animated film, as well as the second animated feature film produced by an American studio after Walt Disney Productions' Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, as Paramount had commissioned the feature in response to the success of that film. The sequences for the film were directed by Seymour Kneitel, Willard Bowsky, Tom Palmer, Grim Natwick, William Henning, Roland Crandall, Thomas Johnson, Robert Leffingwell, Frank Kelling, Winfield Hoskins, and Orestes Calpini. Plot On November 5, 1699, Lemuel Gulliver washes onto the beach of Lilliput after a storm at sea and ultimate shipwreck. Following the calm of the storm, the town crier Gabby stumbles across Gulliver in terror (\\"All's Well\\") and rushes back to Lilliput to warn King Little of a \\"giant on the beach\\". As this is happening, King Little of Lilliput and King Bombo of Blefescu are signing a wedding contract between their children, Princess Glory and Prince David of Blefuscu, respectively. All is fine until an argument starts over which national anthem is to be played at the wedding; the anthem of Lilliput (\\"Faithful\\") or the anthem of Blefuscu (\\"Forever).\\" In fury, King Bombo cancels the wedding and declares war against Liliput. He quickly regrets this decision and decides that he should apologize and call off the war, until Gabby finally makes his way to warn King Little and one of the Lilliputian guards accidentally grabs King Bombo. Gabby tells King Little of the \\"giant\\", and leads a mob to the beach to capture him. There, the Lilliputians tie Gulliver to a wagon on which they convey him to the town. The next morning, Gulliver awakens and breaks himself free. The Lilliputians are terrified until the Blefuscuian forces arrive in Lilliput, and they hesitate to attack due to his size. Realizing that they can use Gulliver as a weapon against the Lilliputians, they start to treat him with hospitality and they even make him a new set of clothes. (It's A Hap-Hap Happy Day) Back in Blefuscu, King Bombo is embarrassed by the defeat, and orders his three spies in Lilliput, Sneak, Snoop and Snitch, to get rid of that Giant \\"or else.\\" Meanwhile, in celebration of the defeat, the Lilliputians treat Gulliver to dinner and a show (Bluebirds in the Moonlight). When the Lilliputians fall asleep after the show, Gulliver walks to the shore when he notices that his pistol has been taken. When he arrives at the shore, Gulliver feels homesick of his life as a sailor while singing \\"I Hear A Dream (Come Home)\\" After some horseplay with Gabby, the hideout where the three Blefuscuian spies are positioned catches on fire, and Gulliver rushes to put it out. Afterward, Gabby overhears Prince David singing a reprise of \\"Forever\\" to Princess Glory, and orders his guards to attack the \\"spy\\". Noticing this, Gulliver picks up David and Glory in his hand and they tell him of the war's cause. Gulliver suggests that they combine \\"Faithful\\" and \\"Forever\\" into one song. In Blefuscu, Bombo receives a message from his spies assuring that Gulliver will soon be a \\"dead duck\\", and announces by carrier pigeon he will attack at dawn. Gabby intercepts this message and warns the Lilliputians. Because of this, the spies aren't aware of the attack until they capture Gabby as the Lilliputians are marching to the beach (We're All Together Now) and they hastily prepare Gulliver's pistol. As the Blefuscuian fleet approaches Lilliput, Gulliver demands they lay down their arms and settle their matters peacefully. When they continue shooting, he ties the Blefuscuian together using their anchors and draws them disarmed to shore. The spies aim and fire at Gulliver from a cliff, but Prince David diverts the shot and, while doing so, falls to his apparent death. Using David's body to illustrate his point, Gulliver scolds both Lilliput and Blefuscu for their futile fighting when they solemnize a truce. Gulliver reveals that David is unharmed, whereupon David and Glory sing their combined song for everyone to hear. (\\"Faithful Forever\\") The spies release Gabby from the sack. Both sides thereafter build a new ship for Gulliver on which he departs, and he sails off into the sunset on the ocean.

But Paramount vetoed the idea based largely on their interests in maintaining financial solvency following their series of bankruptcy reorganizations. However, after the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Paramount wanted to duplicate the Disney success and ordered a feature for a 1939 Christmas release. When the story was first written in New York, Popeye the Sailor had originally been cast as Gulliver. This was scrapped, however, and the story was restructured once the West Coast team of Cal Howard, Tedd Pierce, and Edmond Seward came aboard (although Popeye would later be cast as a Gulliver-like character in an abridged version of the story called \\"Popeye's Travels\\", made for the 1960s Popeye the Sailor television show). One of the major challenges for Fleischer Studios was the 18 month delivery envelope, coming at a time when Fleischer Studios was relocating to Miami, Florida. While Snow White was in production for 18 months, it had been in development for just as long, allowing for a total of three years to reach the screen. To meet this deadline, the Fleischer staff was greatly expanded to some 800 employees. Animation training classes were set up with Miami art schools as a conduit for additional workers. Experienced lead animators were lured from Hollywood studios, including Nelson Demorest, Joe D'Igalo, and former Fleischer Animators Grim Natwick, Al Eugster, and Shamus Culhane, who returned after working for the Walt Disney Studios. Several West Coast techniques were introduced in order to provide better animation and greater personality in the characters. Some animators adapted while others did not. Pencil tests were unheard of in New York but were soon embraced as a tool for improving production methods. And while the majority of the characters were animated through conventional animation techniques, rotoscoping was used to animate Gulliver, Glory, and David. Sam Parker, the voice of Gulliver, also modeled for the live-action reference. The rushed schedule seemed to take precedence over quality, and overtime was the order of the day. Even with the rush, deadlines were compromised with Paramount considering canceling the film. Relations with the Technicolor lab were strained due to these constant delays largely associated with the remote location of Miami. Fleischer Studios delivered Gulliver for Paramount's planned Christmas release schedule, opening in New York on December 20, 1939, going into general release two days later. Considering the potential demonstrated in the two Popeye specials, Gulliver‚Äôs Travels lacked the built-in brand recognition of those shorts. This much- anticipated feature produced by Max Fleischer was still met with by an eager public and started out well, breaking box-office records in spite of the inevitable comparisons to Snow White. Based on the overwhelming business success of Gulliver‚Äôs Travels in its opening run, Barney Balaban immediately ordered another feature for a 1941 Christmas release. In spite of running over the original budget, Paramount made a profit of at least $1,000,000 domestically.Pointer, Ray (2016). The Art and Inventions of Max Fleischer: American Animation Pioneer, McFarland & Co. Publishers. Pg.248-264 Vocal talent The voice cast consisted of a variety of performers. The voice of Gabby was provided by Pinto Colvig, who had previously worked at Disney's. Colvig had previously been the voice of Goofy, provided vocal effects for Pluto, was the stern Practical Pig in The Three Little Pigs, and voiced Grumpy and Sleepy in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Jack Mercer, who portrayed King Little of Lilliput, was a story man for Fleischer's who lent his voice the gruff Popeye the Sailor. In addition to voicing King Little, Mercer was also the voice behind Bombo's spies, Sneak, Snoop, and Snitch. Mercer was a regular voice heard in Fleischer and Famous Studios cartoons, and worked for Paramount until Famous Studios was dissolved. Jessica Dragonette and Lanny Ross were both popular singers of the day, and were hired to sing for Princess Glory and Prince David, respectively. Sam Parker was a radio announcer in the 1930s who won the role of Gulliver in a radio contest. When the Fleischers met Parker, they felt that his appearance was suitable for him to also perform in the live action footage that would be rotoscoped to create Gulliver's movement.Sam Parker (I) - Biography Tedd Pierce was a story man hired away from Leon Schlesinger Productions to join Fleischer in their trip to Miami. Pierce, who would occasionally do voices for some of the characters in the cartoons, played King Bombo. Release Like Snow White before it, Gulliver was a success at the box-office, earning $3.27 million in the United States during its original run, even as it was limited to fifty theaters during the 1939 Christmas season.Top Grossing Movies of 1939Ultimate Movie Rankings This box- office success prompted a second feature to be ordered for a Christmas 1941 release Mr. Bug Goes to Town. Following its domestic run, Gulliver's Travels went into foreign release starting in February 1940. In spite of the profits earned domestically and internationally, Paramount held Fleischer Studios to a $350,000 penalty for going over budget. This was the beginning of the financial difficulties Fleischer Studios encountered as it entered the 1940s. When the Fleischer film library was sold to television in 1955, Gulliver's Travels was included and became a local television station holiday film shown during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. It was also re-released theatrically in Technicolor prints for Saturday matinee children's programs well into the mid 1960s. Home media Due to the film's public domain status, it has been released by many distributors in various home video formats. E1 Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray Disc on March 10, 2009, but received strong criticism for presenting the movie in a stretched and cropped 1.75:1 format, as well as applying heavy noise reduction.DVD BeaverDVD Verdict Animated Views In March 2014, Thunderbean Animation released a superior restored version of the film with several Fleischer Studios shorts in a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack titled Fleischer Classics Featuring Gulliver's Travels.\\"Gulliver\\" Comes To BluRayCartoon ResearchBlu-ray.com Awards The film was nominated for two Academy Awards: * Victor Young for Best Music, Original Score * Ralph Rainger (music) and Leo Robin (lyrics) for Best Music, Original Song (\\"Faithful Forever\\") Each lost both to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's The Wizard of Oz.1940Oscars.org Spin-off cartoons The film was spun off into two short-lived Fleischer cartoon short series: the Gabby series and the Animated Antics cartoons starring the three spies, Sneak, Snoop and Snitch and Twinkletoes (the carrier pigeon).

It was developed by Sonalysts Inc. and published by Electronic Arts (EA). The game licensed parts of Jane's Information Group's military information database, which was used as an in-game \\"Jane's Library\\", reference material that the player could refer to while in-game. Jane's also licensed to EA the \\"Jane's\\" name and the \\"Jane's Combat Simulations\\" logo, and the game was marketed under the \\"Jane's\\" name, much like the previous \\"Jane's Fighters Anthology\\", also published by Electronic Arts.  Gameplay  In terms of gameplay, as a real- time tactics game it is a realistic military simulator and only involves resource management of weapons and the fuel of airborne aircraft. The scenario defines the units that a player has at the beginning of the scenario, and the player can never have more than what they started with until the scenario ends. Like other real-time tactics games, losses cannot be replaced, which emphasises the value of units and the judicious use of them (though some scenarios make it impossible to save a particular unit). The military realism is emphasised further by such means as using some authentic NTDS symbology on the 2D tactical planning map. Much of the game and mission events are presented in the form of full-motion video sequences. Gameplay can be chosen from one of three different options. First is a series of preset missions that contain certain objectives. These missions contain specific goals that must be accomplished in order to be graded successfully. They vary in difficulty from one star to four with four stars being the most difficult. A second game play theme is to play one of four provided scenarios. These are generally \\"wars\\" verses \\"battles\\" that require the player to win each successive challenge before continuing. The last type of game play is using a feature called \\"mission editing,\\" where a player can input their own configurations and force strength and objectives. Preset mission objectives and goals can be input into the editor and displayed to the player at various intervals throughout game play. Input objectives can be configured in such a way that they must be completed in predetermined orders for the overall mission to be successful. The programming skills necessary are quite basic and are a credit to the ingenuity of the software designers. The \\"mission editor\\" feature is simple to use and relatively uncommon in other game play software. The feature enables players to interface directly with the software and provide a relatively limitless amount of possible combat scenarios.  Setting  The game is set in the late 1990s. The game focused exclusively on contemporary units. Units that were in service when the game was released were featured, and units that were out of service or not yet in service were not featured. The game reflects that some of the world's military forces are more advanced than others.  Realism  The game is a naval combat strategic training simulator. It covers the full spectrum of modern naval operations, including submarine warfare, surface warfare, naval aviation, and electronic warfare. Air Force, Marine Corps and Army units are also modelled in the game, although the Army units are generally static. Although the initial release focused mainly on the U.S. Military, it did include a wide variety of forces from nations around the world including the U.K., India, Russia, China, and others. The actual forces under a player's command can include units from several nations (a multi- national force), or it may be limited to a selection of forces from just the one nation's military Arsenal. The game includes both aircraft carriers and land-based air bases. It maintains a level of realism in that aircraft that are limited to land-based operations in real life are similarly limited to land-based operations in the game. This prevents the player from having heavy bombers (like the B-52) taking off or landing from aircraft carriers, something that never happens in the real world. Moreover, only aircraft that are actually assigned to a particular class of aircraft carrier in real life are available on in-game carriers. This concept of realism in units carries through to the weaponry, ordnance, speed, accuracy, radar coverage, level of detection, and survivability of all of the units and weapons in the game. One feature that was deliberately kept out of the game was nuclear weapons.  Game dynamics  In a single-player game, the player starts by selecting a stand-alone scenario or a campaign scenario. Campaign scenarios are linked in that if the player successfully completes a scenario in the campaign, this unlocks the next scenario in that campaign for play. However, the game is limited in that it can only ever have the one campaign available to the player at any one time. In fact, the original version of the game only included one campaign (since then, several replacement campaigns have been made by FC and NWP-FC enthusiasts). A stand-alone scenario is not linked to other scenarios like the campaign scenarios are, although they may be related in terms of setting, theater-of-war, combatants, alliances, fictitious or historical conflicts, etc. Once the player is in the scenario, a 2-D representation of the forces available is presented. This display also shows a representation of the sensor (radar, visual, sonar, etc.) ranges that any of his units have. Individual units are shown in a 3D rendering. If the player has selected the EMCON option, none of his units start the game with active sensors on; only passive sensors will be engaged. This can be an effective strategy for keeping the player's ships undetected, but it also blinds their GCI and leaves them \\"groping in the dark\\", so to speak. If the player has AWACS aircraft and/or fighter jets available, these are often the first units deployed. =Release= The game was released the first time in 1999 by EA. EA licensed also from Jane's the \\"Jane's\\" name and the \\"Jane's Combat Simulations\\" logo, and the game was marketed under the \\"Jane's\\" name, much like the previous \\"Jane's Fighters Anthology\\", also published by EA. On October 26, 2006 Strategy First re-released Fleet Command as SCS-Fleet Command, without the \\"Jane's\\" branding. It was released as part of a three-game retail package called Naval Combat Pack, which also included 688(I) Hunter/Killer and Sub Command and also includes a video CD A Century of Silent Service. The 2006 version of Fleet Command was also released on GameTap as of Thursday, March 20, 2008.  Reception  The United States Naval Academy had the game installed in computer labs and used it to introduce prospective students to the concepts of fleet level decision making during its Summer Seminar program. The editors of PC Gamer US nominated Fleet Command for their 1999 \\"Best Wargame\\" award, which ultimately went to Close Combat III: The Russian Front. They called Fleet Command \\"the perfect modern naval game for thousands of PWSHFOHTPH ('People Who Still Haven't Figured Out How to Play Harpoon).\\" Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"if the game turns slow and your ship is in no immediate danger, hook onto a Harpoon or Sidewinder and follow the streaking missile to its target. You'll get some satisfying kabooms.\\"  See also  * Command: Modern Air Naval Operations References  External links  * * Category:1999 video games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Jane's Combat Simulations Category:Naval video games Category:Real-time tactics video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Strategy First games Category:Ship simulation games ","title":"Fleet Command"},{"id":"5649741","text":"FC3 may refer to: * Far Cry 3, a 2012 video game. * Release 3 of the Fedora Core Linux distribution. * 1982 FC3, an alternative name for the asteroid 4172 Rochefort * FC3: an EEG electrode site according to the 10-20 system ","title":"FC3"},{"id":"5649757","text":"Sailortown is a working-class dockland community located in the Docks area of Belfast, Northern Ireland.

The Valenciennes tramway is integrated into the wider local multimodal public transport network and its commercial brand \\"Transvilles\\". It is owned by the Syndicat intercommunal de mobilit√© et d'organisation urbaine du Valenciennois (SIMOUV), the Transvilles network's organising authority. Since 1 January 2015, the RATP Group, through its subsidiary Compagnie des Transports du Valenciennois et du Hainaut (CTVH), is in charge of operation and maintenance.  Background  The former Valenciennes tram network was opened in 1881, and at the peak of its development during the early 20th century, it reached the Belgian border. The region suffered from a steep decline in several of the local industries, these being mining, steel production and textiles; it was amid this climate that the original tram network was closed in July 1966.\\"Valenciennes Tram System.\\" railway-technology.com, Retrieved: 27 May 2018. Despite the tram network's closure, the road infrastructure of the region was not heavily developed to take over its role. Officially, buses had been adopted as the replacement for the region's former tram system. However, there was a chronic lack of a coherent road network for such services to be operated upon, the development of which having been reportedly hindered by the region's post-industrial infrastructure, and road congestion had risen to concerning levels over the years. As such, there was some level of demand for a suitable regional commuter system be deployed. During the late 1980s onwards, there was a wider revival of interest in the topic of tramways and their potential deployment, the planning authorities in Valenciennes soon became keen to embrace this notion themselves. Opting for a revival of the tramway was not a clear-cut option; a study performed in 1991 concluded that Valenciennes could benefit from the adoption of a structuring Public Transport system, and that trams were likely to be the most suitable option. Jules Chevalier, the President of SITURV, was also personally convinced of the usefulness of a modern tramway. A project, known as Transvilles, involved a major reorganization of the public transport network across the urban area of Valenciennes, centred around the adoption of a modern tram network and a redeployment of bus lines.Richer, Cyprien and Sophie Hasiak. \\"Territorial opportunities of tram-based systems.\\" halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr, 6 March 2015. It would take nearly a full decade between the official proposal for the modern tramway being released and its adoption as an active policy; this delay has been attributed to have been the result of the various bureaucratic steps required for its authorisation, including the multiple local councils that had consent to its construction. The light rail scheme was primarily sponsored by Syndicat Intercommunal des Transports Urbains de la R√©gion de Valenciennes (SITURV) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) emerged as an important source of financing for the relaunched tram system. There was considerable anti-railway lobbying from some members of the community as well. According to railway publication Rail Technology, the automotive industry was a key source of support for the re- launch of tram services, both Peugeot Citro√´n (PSA) and Toyota have manufacturing plants in the area. During 2000, approval was given to proceed with the construction of the first phase of the network, which had an estimated cost of ‚Ç¨242.8 million. A consortium, led by French rolling stock manufacturer Alstom, was awarded the contract to build the system.  Network  = Phase I = The first section of line A (Universit√© - Dutemple, 19 stations) opened on 3 July 2006 under the name of line 1. It is 9.5 km long, services five cities or villages of the Valenciennes area. Citadis 302, produced by Alstom, was adopted as the network's rolling stock and used to transport the first passengers. The line starts in a nearly rural area in the grounds of the University of Valenciennes and Hainaut-Cambresis, then goes north through a commercial mall and the poorer housing areas of La Briquette. It runs through the center of Valenciennes, from Porte de Paris stop to the railway station. Originally the line was to go through the Place d'Armes in front of the city hall, but instead it uses the nearby Rue de la Vieille- Poissonnerie. Beyond the railway station, the line reaches the suburban city of Anzin, where it runs through former industrial areas, now abandoned, and then reuses the former Abscon - Saint-Waast railway line from St-Waast stop to Dutemple terminus. A study on a single-track extension from St-Waast stop to Valenciennes hospital was carried out; however, this option was ultimately dropped in favour of an electric shuttle bus alternative. = Phase II = Line A crosses some countryside areas between H√©rin and Denain During this phase, Line A was extended during Phase II from Valenciennes to Denain (Dutemple - Espace Villars, eight stations) and this extension was formally opened on 31 August 2007. Commercial services began three days later. It is 8.8 km long. The second largest city of the Valenciennes area, Denain has historically sought to improve its transportation capabilities. The line reuses a 6.5 km long section of the former railway alignment from Denain to Valenciennes, which was one of the oldest railways in France (line Abscon - Saint-Waast: opened in 1838). The cost of the Phase II extension is ‚Ç¨69 million. One additional intermediate station, Les Gr√©monts, could be added in a second phase. The station Solange Tonini was added in September 2008 and the Allende station was renamed Jean Dulieu. In July 2009, the station La Plaine was added north of Dutemple. In August 2010, the line 1 was re-designated, becoming line A. = Phase III = Phase III opened in February 2014. Known as line C, this route runs between Anzin and Vieux-Cond√©. Construction commenced in September 2011 and was completed in December 2013. In October 2010, Alstom won a contract to supply seven Citadis trams for use on line 2. Ultimately, Alstom delivered nine additional Citadis vehicles for used upon the second line of Valenciennes tram network during December 2013. = Phase IV = Phase IV, line D Valenciennes - Crespin, study under way, scheduled later.  Operations  In advance of each journey on the tramway, passengers purchase tickets via purpose-built ticket machines that are present at each tram stop; these tickets are checked by onboard revenue protection inspectors. All tram stops feature real-time display units which provide travellers with up-to-date service information. Auditory and visual service alerts are routinely given onboard the tram vehicles as well; onboard CCTV systems also allows for the activities onboard each tram to be inspected. The Citadis tram vehicles, manufactured by Alstom, feature low-floors and double doors, which are claimed to enabled rapid boarding and disembarking of passengers. In their usual service configuration, each vehicle comprises five sections and is capable of holding up to 295 passengers; additional sections can be added should additional capacity be required at a later date. For reasons of driver comfort, the cabs are air conditioned. To date, all tram vehicles are identically configured, later-built units have no demonstrable difference in fittings or operational practice from the original vehicles purchased for the network. The signalling and control systems are completely integrated. Signalling has been provisioned for on the trams, despite the fact that the vehicles are run upon entirely reserved tracks and absolute priority is granted to the tramway over all other forms of transport at any crossing; signs and warning signals to this affect have been installed at each of the network's multiple road intersections. As a rule of thumb, akin to many of France's other tramways, the routes of the Valencienne tramway has intentionally mad use of dedicated alignments wherever reasonably possible; as such, lines often run over grassed areas and minimal contact with the road network is made. Deliberate efforts have been made by the region's transport planners to integrate the tram network with other transport facilities distributed across the area, such as the stops for the regional bus networks and the heavy rail station operated by SNCF. In line with this practice, many of the tram network's stops have been intentionally aligned to be located alongside these other services, along with several park-and-ride sites to encourage commuters to transition from their cars to public transport. Both maintenance and management operations of the tramway is centered around a purpose-built combined depot and control centre, which is located close to the Saint Waast stop. Transvilles has developed several marketing strategies for the purpose of increasing passengers, including active customer relationship management via their own website and personalised messages on social media. It has issued various scholarships, bursaries and mentoring to students at the ENSIAME school of engineering. The organisation has also given concessions to various local, cultural and charitable concerns. In one case, jobseekers registered with the P√¥le Emploi unemployment agency are given a free monthly transit pass upon securing a new job; Anne-Lise Dufour, president of SITURV, stated of this policy: \\"It's a priceless help that first month before the first paycheck rolls in\\".\\"Metropolis of Valenciennes - France.\\" ratpdev.com, Retrieved: 27 May 2018.  Future extensions  Beyond lines C and D, the following extensions are envisaged: * from Denain to Douchy-les-Mines: the terminus of line A at Espace Villars in Denain provides the right orientation towards the city of Douchy-les-Mines. * towards Raismes: along avenue Anatole- France to place de Raismes. The three-way junction in Anzin may be difficult, so it will be necessary to use either the Raismes branch or the Vieux-Cond√© branch (Line C) as a shuttle.

It is Rapp's directorial debut. The film premiered in 2005 to mixed reviews, and was not released in the United Kingdom until 2013, when it was released under the new title Happy Endings. Plot Reese Holdin (Deschanel) is a depressed bartender/actress living in New York City. She regularly engages in casual sex, cocaine use and self-harm. When a publishing agent (Amy Madigan) approaches her, we learn that Reese is the daughter of a famous author named Don Holdin (Harris) and that her mother, Mary, recently died. Reese did not attend the funeral. The publisher offers Reese $100,000 for a series of letters written between her mother and father at the height of their careers. When Reese learns that the kitten she rescued from the streets is dying of feline leukemia, she drowns it and buys a bus ticket to Michigan's Upper Peninsula to retrieve the letters. Returning to her childhood home, she finds it occupied by Corbit (Ferrell), a down-and-out Christian musician, and Shelly (Warner), a 23-year-old former student of Don's. Reese's father now lives, writes and drinks in his garage. Reese initially clashes with the doting Shelly (whom she accuses of sleeping with her father) but eventually accepts her after learning of the death of her parents and of Don's support of her during a near-fatal illness endometriosis. She also bonds with the idiosyncratic Corbit, who spurns her sexual advances and has trouble playing guitar and singing at the same time. She feels out of place at home and fights with her father over childhood neglect, stating that her parents gave their typewriters more attention. She eventually finds the box of letters and, reading the emotional communiques, learns to empathize with her estranged parents. Shelly has also read the letters and asks Reese if she intends to publish them. Reese expresses ambiguity over the matter. Don is still grieving over his wife's death. He keeps the tie she hanged herself with in a dresser in the backyard along with the rest of their bedroom suite, including their bed. He sometimes sleeps in the bed despite the bitter cold of winter. Reese starts to connect with Corbit and Shelly and is honest with her father about her reasons for staying away from the funeral. Soon after, Don overdoses on sleeping pills and Reese finds him unconscious. He recovers in the hospital, where Reese sits by his bed and reads his latest manuscript, Golf, which he had Corbit bury in the yard. The experience helps the father and daughter find closure, and Reese buries the box of letters in place of the novel before returning to New York.

The parish includes the hamlets of Andersfield and Huntstile. The village is on the route of the Samaritans Way South West. History Goathurst was part of the hundred of Andersfield. Originally part of the Royal Forest of North Petherton, its first squire owned Goathurst's St Edward's church, a Grade I listed building which includes a 19th-century monument to three-year-old Isabella Kemeys, showing the child lying on a pillow holding a broken flower. Goathurst was the location of a 300-person prisoner of war camp during World War II, initially housing Italian prisoners from the Western Desert Campaign, and later German prisoners following the Battle of Normandy. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Bridgwater Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

Oaksterdam is located between downtown proper, the Lakeside, and the financial district. It is roughly bordered by 14th Street on the southwest, Harrison Street on the southeast, 19th Street on the northeast, and Telegraph Avenue on the northwest. The name is a portmanteau of \\"Oakland\\" and \\"Amsterdam,\\" due to the Dutch city's cannabis coffee shops and the drug policy of the Netherlands. Since 2005, cannabis has been available to patients with patient identification and physician recommendation at a busy dispensary in the neighborhood, one of Oakland's four officially licensed dispensaries under the current municipal ordinance. According to Proposition 215, a statewide voter initiative which amended the California Health and Safety Code, marijuana used for medical purposes is legal to possess and cultivate.California NORML. Text of California Prop 215 Dispensaries require a doctor's note in order to obtain medical cannabis, which is legal under California Law but still illegal under the federal Controlled Substances Act. History The name Oaksterdam is a combination of Oakland and Amsterdam, the Dutch city that is famously tolerant towards cannabis use. The term was coined by the late Jim McClelland, an AIDS patient who was a founding member of the Oakland Cannabis Buyers Club and the Berkeley Patients Group after prompting by Andrew Glazier, a fellow activist, that the neighborhood needed a name.MarijuanaLogues #1 The history of Oaksterdam started with Oakland Buyers Cooperative Distributing to Prop 215 patients with acts of courage mixed with legal wrangling they stayed open until the federal authorities became an issue. After the federal authorities ordered the Oakland Cannabis Buyers Cooperative (OCBC) to shut down, a few OCBC members (like the late Jim McClelland and late Tim Sidwell) went around the corner and opened up The Zoo. The Zoo was a well stocked dispensary with deals that had clones as well as advice on how to cultivate. Soon after that a proliferation of clubs opened like The Bulldog, Compassionate Caregivers, The Lemon Drop, Oakland Patients Group, and 420 Cafe. Dan Lundgren went on a political warpath after Prop 215 was passed. Dennis Peron was arrested and San Francisco's safe source of medical cannabis was shut down. The Oakland City Council made a few proclamations then promptly made a few patients official medical cannabis officers like Jeff Jones and Ed Rosenthal as well as approve the distribution of medical cannabis as per Proposition 215. The Oakland Politicians were pro cannabis before Prop 215 and allowed a couple of groups to distribute. The Federal authorities however have continued to harass even though the Attorney General Eric Holder has stated publicly that the prosecution of medical cannabis is the federal authorities last priority. On April 2, 2012 the IRS raided Oaksterdam University. Oaksterdam University continued to put on classes less than 2 days later. Incorrect reports often cite that the event was conducted by the DEA. No charges have been filed. Harborside has been also threatened as well. Steve DeAngelo spoke out against the raids and the IRS threats and vowed to serve the patients and reminded us about the patients locked up in jail. The DEA is systematically trying to destroy the medical cannabis community. Melinda Haag the DEA prosecutor has been threatening the city sanctioned dispensaries with closure. The IRS has taken away the standard deduction claiming that the medical cannabis community is a criminal enterprise. Richard Lee dissolved his interest in his businesses, paving the way for a new generation of leadership. Location and character Oaksterdam is located on the north end of downtown Oakland, between downtown proper, the Lakeside and the Financial District. It is roughly bordered by 14th Street on the southwest, Harrison Street on the southeast, 19th Street on the northeast, and Telegraph Ave on the northwest. It is characterized by mixed-use office and residential buildings with unique historic architecture that is older than some of the more modern skyscrapers south of 14th Street, and an abundance of ground floor retail shop spaces, restaurants and cafes. A Julia Morgan- designed building is located at the northwest corner of 15th and Webster Streets, which was the original location of the Oakland YWCA. The neighborhood also features the Cathedral Building, an ornate, historic Flatiron Building at Latham Square at the intersection of Broadway and Telegraph. Educational institutions The district features at least two institutions of higher learning, Lincoln University at 15th and Franklin, a small business school catering mainly to international students, and Oaksterdam University located at 1734 Telegraph Avenue, a business college which prepares students for careers in the cannabis industry. Oaksterdam University was raided by the DEA on April 2, 2012. Transportation infrastructure =Mass transit= The 19th Street BART metrorail station is located beneath Oaksterdam on Broadway between 17th and 20th Streets. The station has entrances on Broadway and on a pedestrian plaza that opens onto Telegraph Avenue. AC Transit also recently opened the Uptown regional transit center nearby on Thomas L. Berkley Way (20th Street), which features multiple bus shelters with seating, NextBus arrival prediction signs, and Rapid Bus service. =Bicycle rental= A bicycle rental service has opened in the neighborhood on 15th Street, serving one of the only bicycle rental stores in the area. The bike shop incorporates a glass-blowing school. =Pedicab service= Recently a pedi-cab service (Oaksterkabs) was opened, staffed by a single cycle rickshaw. Now dubbed \\"The Cannabis Cruiser\\", the pedicab offers its services around the downtown area to students of Oaksterdam University, Oaksterdam employees and to pedestrians in general. Neighborhood retail The district is home to a number of coffee shops, a tea shop and hydroponic supply store, cafes, restaurants open into the evenings, a gift shop, two musical instrument stores and specialty stores. These shops and services also are attractive to cannabis tourists and enjoy a superior central location next to the 19th Street BART station and AC Transit connections. =Medical cannabis dispensation= Since legislative changes passed by the Oakland City Council in 2005, there is no longer a proliferation of cannabis dispensaries in the neighborhood as was the case for several years previously. Most of these dispensaries had the chance to obtain non-profit status; some chose to remain for-profit and were no longer permitted to dispense cannabis. Under current legislation, there are four officially permitted dispensaries in the City of Oakland. One of the four permits is held by a dispensary cafe in the neighborhood. =\\"Measure Z clubs\\"= \\"Measure Z\\" (as of 2014, Measure Z referred to a new Oakland public safety ballot measure instead) clubs are businesses that sell cannabis to people over the age of 18. One private club in Oaksterdam sells cannabis and food containing cannabis to adults who do not hold valid physician recommendations for medical marijuana, which are needed to obtain county-issued patient identification cards in California. One such club is named after Oakland's Measure Z, a city ballot initiative which makes the private sales, cultivation, and possession of cannabis the lowest police priority and mandates that the City of Oakland tax and regulate cannabis as soon as possible under state law. The Oaksterdam News From 2005 to 2007, Oaksterdam University founder Richard Lee published the Oaksterdam News, a quarterly newsprint periodical covering news in the California cannabis movement, with a circulation of 100,000. In 2008, Lee went on to found West Coast Cannabis (edited by author and activist Ngaio Bealum), which covers similar news stories as the Oaksterdam News in magazine format; Oaksterdam News editor Chris Conrad went on to found the West Coast Leaf that same year, with his wife Mikki Norris, which ran with a circulation of 175,000 until 2013.

It was originally an overnight train operated by the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada and its successors the Canadian National Railway and Grand Trunk Western Railroad, running as far as Montreal. The train was cut back to Port Huron, Michigan, in 1970 and discontinued in 1971. In 1982, Amtrak and Via Rail revived the route by extending Amtrak's Blue Water Limited from Port Huron to Toronto. It was renamed as the International the next year. The service was initially successful but encountered numerous funding crises in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Substantial delays crossing the international border after the September 11th attacks, combined with freight congestion and the 2003 SARS outbreak, drastically reduced ridership. In 2004, the train was replaced with the Blue Water, which offered a better interstate schedule and higher reliability.  History  = CN/GTW operation = alt=Steam locomotive with coaches on a raised embankment The Grand Trunk Railway opened its St. Clair Tunnel between Sarnia, Ontario and Port Huron, Michigan in 1891, completing the first direct all-rail route from Chicago to Toronto and Montreal. The Canadian National Railway (CN) and Grand Trunk Western Railroad (GTW) introduced the International Limited on May 25, 1900. The train operated between Chicago's Dearborn Station and Montreal's Bonaventure Station via Port Huron, with the overnight section between Chicago and Toronto. The trip was originally scheduled for 22 hours and 52 minutes (an average speed of ). The \\"premier train of the Grand Trunk Railway System\\", it was assigned numbers 1/2. The Grand Trunk dropped all train names in 1907. In 1912, the Chicago‚ÄìMontreal service was changed to numbers 14/15 to allow the Montreal‚ÄìPrince Rupert Continental Limited to receive numbers 1/2. The International Limited name was restored in March 1919‚Äîthe first GTW train to have a name since 1907. It remained the premier GTW train and received new equipment in 1929. After 1931, westbound train 15 was as much as 4.5 hours faster than its eastbound counterpart, which made local stops between Toronto and Montreal. The CN and the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) began pooling equipment for their competing Montreal‚ÄìToronto services in 1933. The eastern half of the International Limited was jointly operated between the CN and CP; it included a CP through car, and train No. 15 departed from the CP Windsor Station. The train was split into Montreal‚ÄìToronto and Chicago‚ÄìToronto services - both carrying the same numbers - during pre-war service changes in 1939. Montreal Central Station replaced Bonaventure Station as the CN terminus in 1943. In the 1940s, a typical International Limited had three sleeping cars, a buffet lounge, a dining car, and three or more coach cars. By the 1960s, the lounge only operated west of Port Huron, and the dining car only to the east. The International Limited was always the fastest Chicago‚ÄìMontreal service; the westbound train made connections in Chicago to southern, western, and southwestern trains. Until 1964, the International Limited was one of three daily Chicago-Toronto trips on the GTW, along with the Inter-City Limited and La Salle/Maple Leaf. GTW and parent company CN used aggressive marketing, inexpensive fares, and on-board perks like free meals to attract riders. East Lansing station opened as an experimental stop for Michigan State University and proved successful. However, the Grand Trunk was still losing \\"staggering amounts of money\\" running the service. The eastbound Inter-City Limited was cut to Port Huron in November 1964, and cut entirely on October 29, 1967, along with the La Salle when the Chicago-Detroit Mohawk was added. In 1965, the pooling arrangement was terminated; in the ensuing rearrangements, only the Chicago‚ÄìToronto section (renumbered 155/156) retained the International Limited name. The International Limited was cut back to Port Huron on June 12, 1970, leaving the Maple Leaf (the westbound a 1966-renamed Inter-City Limited) as the railroad's only Toronto train. The CN added local trains between Toronto and London, Ontario approximating the former schedule. The Interstate Commerce Commission approved GTW plans in September 1970 to terminate the no- longer-international International, but a judicial order and the pending takeover of intercity rail service in the United States by Amtrak kept the service operating. Amtrak did not retain any of the six GTW trains (the International Limited, Maple Leaf, and Mohawk). They made their last runs on April 30, 1971; the International Limited was the last intercity train to depart from Dearborn Station. = Amtrak/Via operation= alt=Yellow, blue, and white diesel locomotive with coaches in the snow In 1974, Amtrak restored service over the GTW to Port Huron with the Blue Water (renamed the Blue Water Limited in 1975). After Via Rail took over Canadian intercity passenger services in 1978, Amtrak saw a chance to improve the Blue Water Limiteds financial performance by extending it to Toronto. Talks between the agencies began in late 1981. Negotiations soon reached a stalemate; Michigan desired a later Sunday schedule so that weekend travelers to Toronto could return late in the evening, but Via did not. Michigan was also worried about losing day trips to Chicago; supported primarily by ridership west of East Lansing, the Blue Water Limited was Amtrak's most-used state-supported route with only one daily round trip. The New York-Toronto Maple Leaf, introduced in April 1981, had proved an immediate success, and Amtrak and Via soon reached an agreement to extend the Blue Water Limited to Toronto as well. Via accepted the later Sunday train and agreed to share equipment for the route. Michigan funded a Flint-Battle Creek bus, which connected with the westbound Wolverine and eastbound Twilight Limited, to preserve Flint-Chicago day trips. The International Limited began operations on October 31, 1982, replacing the Blue Water Limited. In contrast to its predecessor, it used ex-Penn Central trackage west of Battle Creek, Michigan‚Äîin common with Amtrak's other Michigan trains‚Äîand ran on a daylight schedule. On June 13, 1983, Amtrak renamed the train the International, which it carried until its discontinuance. alt=Blue and silver diesel locomotive in snow On January 15, 1990, Via moved the International off its original CN route to a more northerly route between London and Toronto. The new route enabled it to service Kitchener, Ontario, but added an hour to its running time. There were also several never-enacted proposals to reroute the train within Michigan. A 1984 state plan would have run the International through Grand Rapids; instead, the independent Pere Marquette was started using funds saved by the startup of the International Limited and the discontinuance of the Michigan Executive. In 1995, during a funding crunch, Amtrak proposed routing the International through Durand, Pontiac, and Detroit, thus dropping Flint and Port Huron. In 2000, Amtrak proposed moving the train entirely to the Chicago‚ÄìDetroit line later that year as part of the Network Growth Strategy. Detroit station would have been skipped entirely; Amtrak would no longer have used state funds for the International, though they may have been used for a replacement Port Huron train instead. Neither proposal was ultimately enacted. =Decline and discontinuance= alt=Blue sign attached to chain-link fence Beginning in the late 1990s, Amtrak services in Michigan suffered a series of funding crises. The Pere Marquette was reduced to four times a week in April 1995; that September, a state commission voted to reduce the International to quad-weekly to restore daily operation on the Pere Marquette. The commission elected to keep the daily International in January 1996; in 1997, the state and Amtrak agreed to an 18-month contract lasting through March 31, 1999. Despite an extension, Amtrak proposed to end the train on October 2, 2000. After negotiations proceeded well, the state approved $6.7 million on January 17, 2001, to continue funding for the International. With ridership falling, state officials were reluctant to pursue a long-term funding solution, instead opting for small extensions often by diverting other rail funds. Until 2001, the International had a customs stop of about one hour, with U.S. officials conducting screenings on the train at Port Huron. After the September 11 attacks, security personnel were redeployed to the Blue Water Bridge, and U.S. Customs refused to continue on-board screenings. (On-board screenings continued on Amtrak's two of the three other border-crossing routes; Amtrak Cascades uses preclearance instead) Westbound passengers had to be bussed with their luggage from Sarnia to Port Huron, costing Amtrak $27,000 a month. The security issues caused massive delays, even after on-board screening resumed on February 19, 2002, amid complaints from the state and both railroads. By this time, just 8 to 15 passengers crossed the border on a typical day. Delays caused by the border crossing and freight congestion continued to erode ridership, as did the 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto. Ridership plunged from 125,126 in 1997 to just 88,045 in 2003. Amtrak suggested to Michigan that the International be truncated to Port Huron, which would allow for a more reliable trip on the former Blue Water Limited schedule, restore connections in Chicago, and allow day trips to Chicago. With state agreement, the final International ran eastbound on April 22, 2004, and westbound the next day (along with a Port Huron eastbound on the International schedule). On April 24, 2004, the Port Huron-Chicago Blue Water began operation. Via retained a single daily Toronto-Sarnia round trip that was merged into its Corridor service, but a planned Port Huron-Sarnia bus was never implemented.  Equipment  alt=Yellow-nosed locomotive with silver coaches In its early years, the train usually consisted of two or three coaches and a food-service / custom-class car combination. Amtrak and Via alternated equipment: Amtrak used diesel locomotives and Amfleet coaches, while Via used LRCs and Tempo coaches. Equipment assignments and allocations frequently changed; after the Via equipment was sidelined due to winter conditions in 1985, only Amtrak cars were used. On August 10, 1988, Via began using nine LRC passenger cars with the tilt mechanism removed (making them compatible with Amtrak cafe cars) pulled by F40PH locomotives. In November 1995, all trains began using four or five Amtrak Superliner and Hi-Level cars, pulled by Via F40PH locomotives. The F40PHs were not compatible with the newly installed Incremental Train Control System, so they were replaced with Amtrak P32-8WH locomotives late in 1999. The Horizon Fleet was substituted beginning in 2000 to allow the Superliners to add capacity to western trains, and Genesis locomotives were used in the final years.

Raw data storage, electronic transfer, and the management of electronic business information comprise the basic activities of an office automation system. Office automation helps in optimizing or automating existing office procedures. The backbone of office automation is a LAN, which allows users to transfer data, mail and even voice across the network. All office functions, including dictation, typing, filing, copying, fax, Telex, microfilm and records management, telephone and telephone switchboard operations, fall into this category. Office automation was a popular term in the 1970s and 1980s as the desktop computer exploded onto the scene. Advantages are: # Office automation can get many tasks accomplished faster. # It eliminates the need for a large staff. # Less storage is required to store data. # Multiple people can update data simultaneously in the event of changes in schedule.Computing Dictionary Outline Businesses can easily purchase and stock their wares with the aid of technology. Many of the manual tasks that used to be done by hand can now be done through hand held devices and UPC and SKU coding. In the retail setting, automation also increases choice. Customers can easily process their payments through automated credit card machines and no longer have to wait in line for an employee to process and manually type in the credit card numbers. Office payrolls have been automated which means no one has to manually cut checks, and those checks that are cut can be printed through computer programs. Direct deposit can be automatically set up and this further reduces the manual process and most employees who participate in direct deposit often find their paychecks come earlier than if they'd have to wait for their checks to be written and then cleared by the bank. Other ways automation has reduced employee manpower on tasks is automated voice direction. Through the use of prompts, automated phone menus and directed calls, the need for employees to be dedicated to answer the phones has been reduced, and in some cases, eliminated.

There are seven isoforms of the protein created by alternate splicing. Function BMP1 belongs to the peptidase M12A family of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). It induces bone and cartilage development. Unlike other BMPs, it does not belong to the TGFŒ≤ superfamily. It was initially discovered to work like other BMPs by inducing bone and cartilage development. It however, is a metalloprotease that cleaves the C-terminus of procollagen I, II and III. It has an astacin-like protease domain. It has been shown to cleave laminin 5 and is localized in the basal epithelial layer of bovine skin. The BMP1 locus encodes a protein that is capable of inducing formation of cartilage in vivo. Although other bone morphogenetic proteins are members of the TGF-beta superfamily, BMP1 encodes a protein that is not closely related to other known growth factors. BMP1 protein and procollagen C proteinase (PCP), a secreted metalloprotease requiring calcium and needed for cartilage and bone formation, are identical. PCP or BMP1 protein cleaves the C-terminal propeptides of procollagen I, II, and III and its activity is increased by the procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer protein. The BMP1 gene is expressed as alternatively spliced variants that share an N-terminal protease domain but differ in their C-terminal region Structure The structure of BMP1 was determined through X-Ray diffraction with a resolution of 1.27 √Ö.; Crystallization experiments were done by vapor diffusion at a pH of 7.5. This is important because it is close to the pH of the human body, where BMP1 resides in vivo. BMP1 is 202 residues in length. Its secondary structure is made up of 30% helices, or 10 helices, 61 residues in length, and 15% beta sheets, or 11 strands, 32 residues in length. It contains ligands of an acetyl group and a Zinc ion. A Ramachandran plot was constructed for BMP. This plot shows that BMP1 most prefers Phi and Psi angles (Phi, Psi) of around (-60¬∞,-45¬∞) and (-60¬∞, 140¬∞). These preferred angles are an estimate of the most clustered data of the Ramachandran plot. The preferred region is much greater in range. 97% of the residues were in preferred regions and 100% of the residues were in the allowed region, with no outliers.

In the 2020‚Äì21 season they will compete in Ligue 2, the second tier of French football. They were founded in 1920 as Bleuets de Notre-Dame de Pau, although their official founding date is 1959 which is when Football-Club de Pau were first formed. In the early years after the club's formation in its original home of Pau, capital of B√©arn they played their home games at many different grounds, until finally the club settled into its current location at the Nouste Camp. The club's achievements include winning the Championnat National in 2020, twice winning the National 2 title in 1998 & 2016 and winning the French South-West League in 1958 and 1968. Pau FC have long- standing rivalries with several other clubs in Southern France, in the Adour river basin. The most notable of these are Aviron Bayonnais FC, Stade Montois & Tarbes Pyr√©n√©es Football. History = Football in Pau & South-West France = Football has always had the status of third sport in Pau, behind basketball and especially Rugby union. Nowadays, the popularity of both Pau's Basketball and Rugby union's clubs - Section Paloise & √âlan B√©arnais Pau-Lacq- Orthez respectively - remain greater than that of Pau FC. Historically and culturally, rugby was probably closer to the values of the place (Gascony), replacing the Bearnese & Basque rural sports - or even the La soule - in the hearts of the people of Bearn and Gascony. Moreover, the antagonism between secular patronage, widely represented in the South-West and Catholic patronage which were the driving forces leading to the adoption of English sports, certainly contributed to favoring the practice of rugby, a sport that was despised by the Catholic Church, due to the frequent contacts between players, focusing instead on football or basketball. Catholics, through the action of the Gymnastics and Sports Federation of the Patronage of France (FGSPF), made football their flagship sport, rugby being considered too elitist. After 1905, in opposition, the region's republicans and anticlerical rank behind the oval ball. Rugby thus represented perhaps some form of resistance to the Church and to the \\"French spirit\\" in a long independent land, retaining a strong sense of regional identity and pride, in which the republican tradition is strongly implanted. Thus, despite the very strong British and English historical presence in Pau, especially during the Belle Epoque, since the troops of General Wellington remained posted in Pau after his defeat at the Battle of Orthez (1814), football arrived relatively late compared to other French regions. At that time, many rich English people flocked to Pau to enjoy the healing virtues of the Pau climate and Pyrenean waters, attracted by Dr. Alexander Taylor and his essayon medicine, \\"On the Curative Influence of the Climate of Pau, and the Mineral Waters of the Pyrenees On Diseases \\" which washugely successful in England at the time. These expatriates, including Henry Russell's father, launched the fashion of Pyreneism and also regularly attended Bill√®re's golf course. Thus, in November 1856, Major Pontifex, Colonels Anstruther and Hutchinson, Archdeacon Sapte and Lord Hamilton formally founded in Pau the first continental golf course in France and Europe, outside of the British Isles, the Pau Golf Club. Patrice O'Quin (FR), of Irish descent became mayor of Pau in 1860. In the region in the nineteenth century, a Scotsman called J. J. Shearer contributed to the establishment of rugby in Bordeaux and Welshman Owen Roe to rowing and rugby in Bayonne. At the beginning of the 20th century, however, formal teams appeared in B√©arn and French Basque Country under the patronage of the parishes of the districts of towns and villages. A first championship was organized by the Pyrenean Union, local body of the Gymnastics and Sports Federation of the patronages of France (FGSPF). Ten patronages participate in this original edition: seven located around Bayonne and three patronages of the region of Pau: Alerte de S√©gure (patronage of the Lyc√©e which would later be renamed Louis-Barthou Pau), FA Bourbaki of Pau and Avenir Salisien. Football has officially been practiced in Pau since 1902 and the first season of Football at the JAB Pau. This club, from the Saint Martin patronage, has trained many professional players like Jean-Michel Larqu√©, Jean-Fran√ßois Larios or Dominique V√©sir. Like many other football clubs in South West France and B√©arn, this club is originally a Catholic patronage. In 1904 took place the first season of the Football Association Bourbaki, whose colors are gray and purple. This patronage was founded in 1888 by the abbot Lafourcade, of the parish Saint-Jacques de Pau. The patronage is named after Charles-Denis Bourbaki, French general born in Pau in 1816 and known to have commanded the Arm√©e de l'Est during the War of 1870. = Bleuets de Notre-Dame de Pau (1920-1959) = The Catholic patronage of the Bleuets de Notre-Dame de Pau was officially founded in 1920 - even though the first mentions of the patronage date back to 1904- by the parish priest Jean-Paul Ramonguilhem, with the help of local entrepreneur Gaston Sant√© and mailman Louis Delnaz. The Bleuets de Notre-Dame de Pau, founded in the aftermath of World War I, are so named because Bleuets or cornflower in English for this flower is the first to grow (along with poppies) after bombings on battle fields. The club was therefore meant to be a symbol of renaissance and reconstruction. In France the bleuet de France also happens to be the symbol of the 11 November 1918 armistice and, as such, a common symbol for veterans (especially the now defunct poilus of World War I), similar to the Remembrance poppies worn in the United Kingdom and in Canada. This is the patronage of the parish Notre-Dame de Pau, attended by all the youth of the Mayolis district, which was then a popular district of the city of Pau. This district is nowadays called the Triangle, famous for its festive nightlife. At that time, the patronage enabled the local youth to practice many sports activities such as football, but also music, theater, gymnastics, athletics, or roller skating. The practice of football dates back to from 1923, although the first meaningful season of a football team of Bleuets would take place in 1935‚Äì1936, at the creation of the District of the Pyrenees in 1936. The Pau Football Club is the result of the split with Bleuets de Notre-Dame de Pau in 1959.  Rise in power (1950 to 1956)  Albert Lille (1899 - 1979), nicknamed \\"The sorcerer\\" was a firefighter and deputy secretary general of the city of Pau. He became vice-president of the Bleuets football section of Notre Dame de Pau in 1945 and would remain until 1958. He had previously left in 1932 the Bourbaki Football Association to join Bleuets . The patronage of the Blueberries had acquired in 1941 a ground of 12 000 m2, located road of Buros, in order to build its Stade des Bleuets, equipped with two lateral stands. It was originally a cowshed with a farm, the Bern√®s farm, where players would wash after matches. Albert Lille played a vital role for the club and football in B√©arn. Under his direction, the patro structured and progressed through the amateur league system. Lille is notably responsible for the constitution of a youth team with players from the district that would go on to help the club experience nine promotions in ten years and reach the highest amateur division, at a time when the leagues were closed. Taking care of training, Albert Lille devoted himself more specifically to youth teams. Thus, he leads his group, championship titles of the Pyrenean Union in several age categories. This team would soon confirm by becoming champions of the League cadets and champions of France F.S.C.F. juniors in April 1950 against the \\"Vigilante de Saint-√âtienne\\" in Montpellier on the score of 4 to 1, on the ground of the SOM. Having started life in the lower leagues of the Pyrenees District in 1950‚Äì51, the Bleuets, seven years later in 1958, reached the highest amateur league in France, with a team made up of players largely coming from the Mayolis district of Pau. At that time the Bleuets took the ascendancy over the JAB of Pau, FA Bourbaki and Union Juran√ßonnaise.  Golden Age in Division Nationale (1956 to 1958)  The Bleuets are promoted to the Division Nationale, managing an honorable 6th place in the Southwest group for their first season at this level, confirming their status as \\"Pioneers\\" of football in Southwest France. In 1958, the patronage of vice- president Albert Lille and coach Bela Herczecg won the South West Division Division Champion title. The football on display was English, physical and committed, more about strength and playing the ball forward as quickly as possible, reflecting the character of a rugby mad city. The 1958-59 National Division season was the 11th edition of the championship, which was the first level in French amateur football. The competition was won that season by AS Saint-√âtienne. Therefore, Pau, still known under the name Bleuets de Notre- Dame de Pau reached the highest level of the French South-West regional football league for the first time in 1956. Under the guidance of coach Albert Lille at the beginning of the 50s, the Bleuets de Notre-Dame de Pau are growing as a football club with a Champion of France youth title in 1951. This was the foundation of their run in the 1958 Coupe de France, when the first team played in the French third tier. The Round of 64 of the 1957/1958 edition of the Coupe de France against FC Girondins de Bordeaux, then in the Division 2, that was lost 4‚Äì1 after extra-time in front of more than 6000 spectators at the stade de l'avenue de Buros is still one of the greatest matches of the club's history. There was a split at the club in 1959, which resulted in the creation of Football Club de Pau, focused on the first team and Bleuets de Notre-Dame de Pau, which continued with the youth team. Indeed, the club was not willing to shed their amateur status and start remunerating their players, as the parsons argued that training professional players was not part of their attributions. = Football Club de Pau =  Creation of the club - Jos√© Bidegain era (1959 to 1965)  Thanks to the Bleuets' run in 1957/1958 edition of the Coupe de France and this memorable match against the Girondins, the local demand for high-level football in Pau, B√©arn and the South West was really at an all-time high. The Bishop, responsible for the patronage of the Bleuets de Notre Dame de Pau felt it had reached the limits and looked for a new group of local leaders able to manage a senior team able to represent the city of Pau at the national level. Indeed, the French Championship of amateur football requires the implementation of means that exceed the possibilities and competence of the normal organization of a patronage, whose work is essentially educational. The first team of the Bleuets Notre-Dame de Pau split and gave birth to the Football Club de Pau on 19 May 1959 with the motto \\"Vaincre ou Sourire\\", meaning \\"To win or smile\\", at the initiative of the young and dynamic local entrepreneur Jos√© Bidegain, in order to endow Pau, in full economic expansion thanks to the exploitation of the Lacq gas field since 1956, of an amateur football team worthy of its reputation as \\"Queen of Sports\\" City. The creation was announced at a press conference held at the Caf√© Majestic, an emblematic place located on the Place Royale. The club's Affiliation Number at the French Football Federation is 50168130 and it chose to retain the original colors worn by the Bleuets, Blue and White. The club has since its foundation had the concern to limit as much as possible the number of matches overlapping with those of the local rugby club. The headquarters were established at the Hotel Beaus√©jour, while the club would play its home matches either at the Stade Des Bleuets or at the newly built Stade du Hameau from 13 February 1960. An emblematic leftist industrialist, Jos√© Bidegain was the CEO of Bidegain SA, a company created in 1936 famous for the Babybottes. He embodied the modernist wing of the National Council of French Patronage of which he was vice-president, and pushed for a better dialogue with the unions. A figure of social Christianity, Bidegain went on to become President of Action Against Hunger from 1991 until his death and joined the Ministry of Industry, under the second Rocard government. At the time of his death in 1999 following a car accident, Serge July devoted a stirring hommage to him in Lib√©ration. An enthusiastic speleologist, Bidegain was one of the rescuers during the tragedy of 14 August 1952 of the Gouffre de Pierre Saint-Martin where Marcel Loubens died during a large-scale expedition in which Haroun Tazieff participated. He is also the father of screenwriter Thomas Bidegain. Right from the beginning, Football Club de Pau was meant to keep on building on what the Bleuets and other patronages of the city has achieved. FC Pau became de facto the only club in the South West, with the exception of Toulouse and Bordeaux, to play in the national divisions. The local press often refers to the club as FC Palois. The club was ambitious, playing friendly matches against its Spanish neighbors of Real Sociedad and Club F√∫tbol Jacetano in 1959, in order to get prepared and more competitive before the start of the season. The Palois lost to Andoni Elizondo's Real Sociedad on the score of 6‚Äì2. For this inaugural season, FC Pau finished 7th in the South-West Group Amateur Football Championship Group. The new club's start to the season wasindeed difficult, but the Palois finally recovered in the second part of the season. They began the season with an inaugural defeat at the Stade de la Route de Buros against the outgoing champion Brive on 26 August 1959, and then recovered against Limoges the following week, winning on the score of 2 to 1. The club slowly built on this promising season and began consolidating while attracting experienced players, such as midfielder Joseph Brotons - who would later play in Division 1 at OM. In addition, the young Andr√© Altuzarra built a solid reputation and became international junior in 196045 before leaving to try his luck at Girondins de Bordeaux. Les Palois settled at the Stade du Hameau on 21 February 1960, winning the inaugural match against the Athletic Sport Rochefortais on the score of 5 to 1, thanks to a tactic in 2-3-5 and the confirmation of the form of Altuzarra. However, recurrent infrastructure problems and the lack of a proper stadium, would continue to hinder the development of this young football club fighting for recognition and survival in the heartland of a Rugby union land, Bearn, and South-Western France as a whole. = Pau Football Club =  New start (1995)  The club was renamed Pau Football Club during the 1995 - 1996 season when Football Cclub de Pau when it went to administration. Two projects were then in competition for the takeover: that of a former player in the person of Bernard Laporte-Fray132 and that of the former president of FC Pau from 1975 to 1991: Pierre Cl√®de. Mayor Andr√© Labarr√®re believes that the city of Pau could host three professional sport clubs \\"There is room for three top clubs in Pau. On the condition that they are well managed. \\"The decision was finally taken to save top-level football in Pau under the name \\"Pau Football Club\\" and not \\"Pau-Pyr√©n√©es Football Club\\", a name championned by the Clede team. Bernard Laporte-Fray, the 1983 goalkeeper, became president of the Pau Football Club twelve years after his debut ofr the club. All that remained was to obtain the approval of the liquidator and that of the FFF. Laporte-Fray was the goalkeeper during the 1982-1983 Division 4 season when FC Pau won his place in Division 3 1983‚Äì1984, and was the first to play at this level in Blois. From now on, the emphasis is clearly on training young players and ending the star system. The former captain of the 1980s, Robert P√©r√©-Escamps, who played for the club for thirteen seasons, was appointed to the position of coach with the task of maintaining the club in National 2 for the 1995‚Äì1996 season, the club having been relegated administratively the previous season. The wage bill was halved, from 375,000 francs to 175,000 francs. Fr√©d√©ric Viseux, Jos√© Dalmao, Bob Senoussi and Pascal Plancque left the club. The club's sporting policy was profoundly changed. No more high salaries, and the emphasis was placed on developing academy players so that they do not hesitate to hand them their first team debut in their teenage years. Pau FC made the first page of their new history at the Hameau stadium against Dijon FCO, winning 1‚Äì0. In 1997, the Pau FC offered Ren√© Girard his first coaching opportunity, whose mission was to obtain promotion to the National and eventually to League 2.  Stabilization, development and failure Ren√© Girard (1997‚Äì2001)  Pau FC entered the newly created national championship at the beginning of the 1998‚Äì1999 season under the leadership of Ren√© Girard, after having been promoted from the CFA. It was under Ren√© Girard's orders that Edouard Ciss√© made his debut, before being transferred to PSG in December 1997 for 35,000 francs. Unfortunately, the results did not follow at the National level and Girard was dismissed in December 1997, complaining about Richard Allenda's influence behind the scenes and not having had a hand in recruitment, in order to keep Michel Sanchez, the team's star striker. He sued the club afterwards. Jo√´l Lopez and Richard Allenda took over the interim and gave the Capbourruts a victory over the Association sportive de Saint-√âtienne in the eighth round of the Coupe de France in . Pascal Plancque, former player of the club who had finished his career with the Basque club Arin luzien in the regional leagues, took over from Allenda in January 1998. During the same 1997‚Äì98 season, Pascal Plancque guided the club to the 8th rounfd of the Coupe de France, when they were eliminated by Paris Saint-Germain. Jo√´l Bats, the PSG coach, had previously warned his troops, not at best at that time, against the \\"temperament of the South-West\\", considering that it was \\"a trap match \\". Some spectators had queued up to 4 hours to obtain seats. The match against PSG was played in a packed Stade du Hameau in front of a then capacity crowd of 15,000 spectators. The only goal of the match was scored by the Sele√ßao captain Ra√≠. The club's prodiugal son, Edouard Ciss√© came on as a sub, replacing Laurent Fournier. The match was physical and ended with a massive brawl that continued in the dressing rooms. Despite the defeat to a better team, the Palois were able to use \\"grinta\\" to thwart the plans of PSG coaches Ricardo Gomes and Jo√´l Bats, who graduated at the acamedy of Pau FC's rivals Stade Montois. Two chances from Girardot and Baylac could have even allowed him to win. The Capbourruts had three players sent off that day: Jacques R√©my, 73rd; Xavier B√©cas, 113th and Laurent Vacher, 119th and consider that the referee was not up to the task144. On that day, the PSG fielded an experienced team against amateurs (only Vacher and R√©my benefited from federal contracts) but only managed to win on the smallest of margins after extra time: 8th round of the 1997‚Äì98 Coupe de France _Pau FC (4-4-2)_ Goalkeeper Christophe Baiocco Defenders Laurent B√©dani - Laurent Vacher (Cap) - Arthur Demirdjian - David Jaur√©guiberry Eddy Bathie (Richard Goyet, 117th) Normand (Jean-Jacques B√©cas, 66th), Alexandre Sallabery, Jacques R√©my Forwards Rapha√´l Girardot (Gilles Guerri, 86th) - Denis Baylac _Paris SG (4-4-2)_ Goalkeeper Vincent Fernandez Defenders Jimmy Alg√©rino, Bruno Ngotty, Alain Roche, Paul Le Guen Milieux Laurent Fournier (√âdouard Ciss√©, 68th), Pierre Ducrocq, Ra√≠ J√©r√¥me Leroy Forwards Marco Simone, James Debbah (Patrice Loko, 80th). In 1998, Pau Football Club mourned the sudden death of the club's legend Paul Escud√©. A stadium now bears his name in Pau, inaugurated by his two sons: Julien Escud√© and Nicolas Escud√©. At the beginning of the 1999‚Äì2000 season, Pau FC now has a budget of 6.5 million francs, allowing the club to compete with National's big guns and generating growing interest. Bernard Laporte Fray, then a young president, who after the past escapades, was part of this new management team that has given back credibility to a club that was sorely lacking. But by regaining their discipline, the Palois have not lost their ambitions. The club is at the gates of Division 2 and the professional world the club had been wanting to join for years. The club is struggling, but lacks structure since the Capbourruts cannot effectively offer young locals a training centre, a preserve of professional structures. Moreover, the partnership with the Girondins de Bordeaux was not very productive, and Pau FC turned to the Toulouse Football Club at that time, with the arrival of Avezac. Julien Poueys, alocal lad, who had worked hiw way up at Montpellier HSC, came back at the club in 1991.  Dark Times and relegation to the Fourth Division (2001‚Äì2008)  In 2001, the club went through a new troubled period following the conditional sentence of its president Bernard Laporte-Fray and its sports director Richard Allenda to prison for possession of cocaine. The presidency was for a time held by Jacques le Coadou, before a former player, Joel Lopez, took over. During the 2005‚Äì06 season, Pau FC, led by Marc L√©vy, returned to the club in a coaching role and was loaned by Lorient FC a young player named Andr√©-Pierre Gignac. At the age of 21, \\"D√©d√© Gignac\\" had scored eight goals in twenty games for the Capbourruts. The B√©arnais club had finished 15th. He built his reputation as a bon vivant, quickly becoming part of the team and sharing local food sausages on the team bus. In 2002, the club continued to structure itself and appointed Jean-Marc Ferratge as head of the club's training unit153, before taking over the reins of the first team in 2003. The average attendance was around 1,500 that season. Behind the scenes, Jacques Le Coadou handed over the presidency of the club, a position he had held since 2001 to Jo√´l Lopez. The club is in a poor state of repair in terms of training and no longer includes many regional players. Pau Football Club remained at National level until the 2007‚Äì08 season, when it finished at the 17th place and was relegated to Group C of the 2008‚Äì09 French Amateur Football Championship. The following season, the club finished third, narrowly missing immediate promotion back to the Third Division. That season, David Vignes was appointed coach on 8 October 2007, in place of Jean-Luc Girard, of whom he was the assistant. h During this last National season, Jo√´l Lopez made an uncompromising assessment of the state of football in B√©arn, which, despite 6,000 licence holders, lacks \\"football culture\\", while regional competitions and levels of play are low, which hinders the club's ability to detect regional talent155. Thus, following Tino Costa's signature, Pau FC forged links with the Argentine training centre in Las Flores, the city where Costa originated. Pau Football Club (1998‚Äì99 to 2007‚Äì08) and AS Cannes (2001‚Äì02 to 2010‚Äì11) still co-host the record for longevity in National, with 10 consecutive seasons played. Pau Football Club stayed in National until the 2007‚Äì2008 season when they finished 17th and were relegated to CFA. Pau Football Club (from 1998 to 1999 to 2007‚Äì2008) and AS Cannes (from 2001 to 2002 to 2010‚Äì2011) are the record holding clubs for the number of seasons spent in the French third tier, with 10 consecutive seasons Pau FC is again promoted to National for the 2016‚Äì2017 season from the CFA after finishing first in the 2015‚Äì16 season. They entered the season and did not win any of their first 5 games (drawn 3, lost 2). However they steadily pulled themselves out of the relegation zone and after 22 games, appeared safe from relegation in 12th position. However, Pau went on a 10 match winless run (drawn 5, lost 5) and found themselves sitting in 17th position with 2 games remaining. However, victories over SAS √âpinal and US Concarneau saved them from relegation and finished in 14th position, just 1 point out of the relegation zone. When the 2019‚Äì20 Championnat National season was prematurely ended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Pau were top of the table, and were declared promoted to Ligue 2 by the FFF executive committee. = Key moments = 1920: Foundation of Bleuets Notre-Dame de Pau. 1923: First Football season at Bleuets Notre-Dame de Pau. 1951: French Champion ‚Äì youth team 1956: Reached the top level of the French South-West Regional football league. 1958: Champion of the French South-West Regional football league.

Colours and badge  In FC Pau's first years, the club kit was blue and white shirts, white shorts and blue socks, thus echoing the original Bleuets de Notre Dame strip.. The club soon switched to yellow shirts with blue sleeves and collars. In 1991, Pau due to then president Alain Pitoun, switched back to blue and white shirts, white shorts and blue socks. In 1995, Pau changed again to yellow shirts with blue sleeves and collars. Badge The traditional badge of the club, revealed in 1959 at the creation of FC Pau during a press conference held at the Majestic on the Place Royale, is inspired by that of the town of Pau. The slogan, inherited from Bleuets de Pau, has been Vaincre ou Sourire ie, \\"Win or Smile\\" since 1920. With the exception of some very unfortunate adventures in the 1990s and until 2009, with logos taking up that of the town and highlighting the Alfred de Vigny fountain located on the Boulevard des Pyr√©n√©es, Les Palois have remained faithful to the original logo. The current coat of arms refers to the crown of Henri IV and the B√®th C√®u de Pau (Beautiful sky of Pau in Bearnese language). This logo highlights the attachment to the Pyrenees of mountains, and more particularly to the Pic du Midi d'Ossau as seen from the famous Boulevard des Pyr√©n√©es in the town of Pau. This unique panorama made Lamartine, a major figure of Romanticism in France: Pau is the most beautiful land view in the world as Naples is the most beautiful sea view. The crown on top of the badge highlights the city's nickname of \\"Royal City\\" since Pau was the birthplace of Henry IV, or Nouste Henric for the people of B√©arn. The city was the capital of B√©arn, a former sovereign state, then a former French province following its attachment to the kingdom of France in 1620 after Louis XIII, Henry IV' son, imposed the union of the two crowns of France and Navarre by organising a military expedition to B√©arn. The club's supporters maintain a clear preference for the historical logo and its 2009 derivative, and continue to use this logo in their communications. In a Facebook post, the Community Manager of the club said in 2011 \\"I do not understand the logo change\\".  Stadium  The club's new football-specific stadium is named Nouste Camp. The historic ground of the Bleuets Notre-Dame de Pau is the Stade des Bleuets, located at avenue de Buros in Pau, Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques. Pau FC's ground has long been the Stade du Hameau, completely renovated for the 2017 season, with a 18426 seating capacity.

The duo are most famous for representing Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest 1976, performing the song My Little World, where they recorded a 5th- place finish with 80 points.

This caused some controversy when Waterloo & Robinson protested that Tie Break's song (Du Bist) was longer than the 3 minutes allowed under Contest rules - clocking in at between 3:09 and 3:11 depending on the stereo used. The duo were quoted as saying \\"If skiers battle over the tenth part of a second, we must be allowed to go to court because of a time exceeding of 5%\\" as well as filing a legal challenge to Tie Break's performance .

It is a form of lysosomal storage disease. Hunter syndrome is caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S). The lack of this enzyme causes heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate to accumulate in all body tissues. Hunter syndrome is the only MPS syndrome to exhibit X-linked recessive inheritance. The symptoms of Hunter syndrome are comparable to those of MPS I. It causes abnormalities in many organs, including the skeleton, heart, and respiratory system. In severe cases, this leads to death during the teenaged years. Unlike MPS I, corneal clouding is not associated with this disease. Signs and symptoms Hunter syndrome may present with a wide variety of phenotypes. It has traditionally been categorized as either \\"mild\\" or \\"severe\\" depending on the presence of central nervous system symptoms, but this is an oversimplification. Patients with \\"attenuated\\" or \\"mild\\" forms of the disease may still suffer from significant health issues. For severely affected patients, the clinical course is relatively predictable; patients will normally die at an early age. For those with milder forms of the disease, a wider variety of outcomes exist. Many live into their 20s and 30s, but some may have near-normal life expectancies and may even have children. Cardiac and respiratory abnormalities are the usual cause of death for patients with milder forms of the disease. The symptoms of Hunter syndrome (MPS II) are generally not apparent at birth. Often, the first symptoms may include abdominal hernias, ear infections, runny noses, and colds. As the buildup of GAGs continues throughout the cells of the body, signs of MPS II become more visible. Physical appearances of many children with the syndrome include a distinctive coarseness in their facial features, including a prominent forehead, a nose with a flattened bridge, and an enlarged tongue. They may also have a large head, as well as an enlarged abdomen. For severe cases of MPS II, a diagnosis is often made between the ages of 18 and 36 months. In milder cases, patients present similarly to children with Hurler‚ÄìScheie syndrome, and a diagnosis is usually made between the ages of 4 and 8 years. The continued storage of GAGs leads to abnormalities in multiple organ systems. After 18 months, children with severe MPS II may suffer from developmental decline and progressive loss of skills. The thickening of the heart valves and walls of the heart can result in progressive decline in cardiac function. The walls of the airway may become thickened, as well, leading to obstructive airway disease. As the liver and spleen grow larger with time, the abdomen may become distended, making hernias more noticeable. All major joints may be affected by MPS II, leading to joint stiffness and limited motion. Progressive involvement of the finger and thumb joints results in decreased ability to pick up small objects. The effects on other joints, such as hips and knees, can make walking normally increasingly difficult. If carpal tunnel syndrome develops, a further decrease in hand function can occur. The bones themselves may be affected, resulting in short stature. In addition, pebbly, ivory-colored skin lesions may be found on the upper arms, legs, and upper back of some people with it. These skin lesions are considered pathognomic for the disease. Finally, the storage of GAGs in the brain can lead to delayed development with subsequent intellectual disability and progressive loss of function. The age at onset of symptoms and the presence or absence of behavioral disturbances are predictive factors of ultimate disease severity in very young patients. Behavioral disturbances can often mimic combinations of symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, obsessive compulsive disorder, and/or sensory processing disorder, although the existence and level of symptoms differ in each affected child. They often also include a lack of an appropriate sense of danger, and aggression. The behavioral symptoms of MPS II generally precede neurodegeneration and often increase in severity until the mental handicaps become more pronounced. By the time of death, most children with severe MPS II have severe mental disabilities and are completely dependent on their caretakers. Genetics MPS II has an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. Since Hunter syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder, it preferentially affects male patients. The IDS gene is located on the X chromosome. The IDS gene encodes for an enzyme called iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S). A lack of this enzyme leads to a buildup of GAGs, which cause the symptoms of MPS II. Females generally have two X chromosomes, whereas males generally have one X chromosome that they inherit from their mother and one Y chromosome that they inherit from their father. If a female inherits one copy of the mutant allele for MPS II, she will usually have a normal copy of the IDS gene which can compensate for the mutant allele. This is known as being a genetic carrier. A male who inherits a defective X chromosome, though, usually does not have another X chromosome to compensate for the mutant gene. Thus, a female would need to inherit two mutant genes to develop MPS II, while a male patient only needs to inherit one mutant gene. A female carrier can be affected due to X-inactivation, which is a random process. Pathophysiology Dermatan sulfate is one of the GAGs that build up in the tissues of people with MPS II. The human body depends on a vast array of biochemical reactions to support critical functions. One of these functions is the breakdown of large biomolecules. The failure of this process is the underlying problem in Hunter syndrome and related storage disorders. The biochemistry of Hunter syndrome is related to a problem in a part of the connective tissue known as the extracellular matrix, which is made up of a variety of sugars and proteins. It helps to form the architectural framework of the body. The matrix surrounds the cells of the body in an organized meshwork and functions as the glue that holds the cells of the body together. One of the parts of the extracellular matrix is a molecule called a proteoglycan. Like many components of the body, proteoglycans need to be broken down and replaced. When the body breaks down proteoglycans, one of the resulting products is mucopolysaccharides (GAGs). In MPS II, the problem concerns the breakdown of two GAGs: dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. The first step in the breakdown of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate requires the lysosomal enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase, or I2S. In people with MPS II, this enzyme is either partially or completely inactive. As a result, GAGs build up in cells throughout the body, particularly in tissues that contain large amounts of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. The rate of GAGs buildup is not the same for all people with MPS II, resulting in a wide spectrum of medical problems. Diagnosis The first laboratory screening test for an MPS disorder is a urine test for GAGs. Abnormal values indicate that an MPS disorder is likely. The urine test can occasionally be normal even if the child actually has an MPS disorder. A definitive diagnosis of MPS II is made by measuring I2S activity in serum, white blood cells, or fibroblasts from skin biopsy. In some people with MPS II, analysis of the I2S gene can determine clinical severity. Prenatal diagnosis is routinely available by measuring I2S enzymatic activity in amniotic fluid or in chorionic villus tissue. If a specific mutation is known to run in the family, prenatal molecular genetic testing can be performed. DNA sequencing can reveal if someone is a carrier for the disease. Treatment Because of the wide variety of phenotypes, the treatment for this disorder is specifically determined for each patient. Until recently, no effective therapy for MPS II was available, so palliative care was used. Recent advances, though, have led to medications that can improve survival and well-being in people with MPS II. =Enzyme replacement therapy= Idursulfase, a purified form of the missing lysosomal enzyme, underwent clinical trial in 2006 and was subsequently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as an enzyme replacement treatment for MPS II. Idursulfase beta, another enzyme replacement treatment, was approved in Korea by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. Recent advances in enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with idursulfase have been proven to improve many signs and symptoms of MPS II, especially if started early in the disease. After administration, it can be transported into cells to break down GAGs, but as the medication cannot cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, it is not expected to lead to cognitive improvement in patients with severe central nervous system symptoms. Even with ERT, treatment of various organ problems from a wide variety of medical specialists is necessary. =Bone-marrow and stem-cell transplantation= Bone-marrow transplantation and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) have been used as treatments in some studies. While transplantation has provided benefits for many organ systems, it has not been shown to improve the neurological symptoms of the disease. Although HSCT has shown promise in the treatment of other MPS disorders, its results have been unsatisfactory so far in the treatment of MPS II. ERT has been shown to lead to better outcomes in MPS II patients. =Gene editing therapy= In February 2019, medical scientists working with Sangamo Therapeutics, headquartered in Richmond, California, announced the first \\"in body\\" human gene editing therapy to permanently alter DNA - in a patient with MPS II. Clinical trials by Sangamo involving gene editing using zinc finger nuclease are ongoing as of February 2019. Prognosis Earlier onset of symptoms is linked to a worse prognosis. For children who exhibit symptoms between the ages of 2 and 4, death usually occurs by the age of 15 to 20 years. The cause of death is usually due to neurological complications, obstructive airway disease, and cardiac failure. If patients have minimal neurologic involvement, they may survive into their 50s or beyond. Epidemiology An estimated 2,000 people are afflicted with MPS II worldwide, 500 of whom live in the United States.LaTercera.com (in Spanish) A study in the United Kingdom indicated an incidence among males around one in 130,000 male live births. History The syndrome is named after physician Charles A. Hunter (1873‚Äì1955), who first described it in 1917. Research Beginning in 2010, a phase I/II clinical trial evaluated intrathecal injections of a more concentrated dose of idursulfase than the intravenous formulation used in enzyme replacement therapy infusions, in hopes of preventing the cognitive decline associated with the severe form of the condition. Results were reported in October 2013. A phase II/III clinical trial began in 2014. In 2017, a 44-year-old patient with MPS II was treated with gene therapy in an attempt to prevent further damage by the disease. This is the first case of gene therapy being used in vivo in humans. The study was extended to six patients in 2018. Society On 24 July 2004, Andrew Wragg, 38, of Worthing, West Sussex, England, suffocated his 10-year-old son Jacob with a pillow, because of the boy's disabilities related to MPS II. A military security specialist, Wragg also claimed that he was under stress after returning from the war in Iraq. He denied murdering Jacob, but pleaded guilty to manslaughter by reason of diminished capacity. Mrs. Justice Anne Rafferty, called the case \\"exceptional\\", gave Wragg a two-year prison sentence for manslaughter, then suspended his sentence for two years.

The player uses a handlebar controller to move a skier down a course situated on a snow- covered mountain, the objective being to make it to the end of the course without falling off the slope or colliding with obstacles. It features three different courses to select, alongside a standard race mode and a time-attack mode where the player must pass through gates to replenish a time limit. It ran on the Namco System 22 arcade hardware. Gameplay In-game screenshot Alpine Racer is a racing video game based on the sport of alpine skiing. It uses a handlebar controller for movement with rotating foot pedals to simulate real skis. The player moves the on-screen skier down a course, while avoiding collision with obstacles, such as trees and rocks, or falling off the edge of the slope. Three different courses are selectable, each increasing in difficulty with the addition of fast-moving obstacles and sharper turns, alongside three difficulty levels: \\"Novice\\", \\"Intermediate\\", and \\"Expert\\". Two gamemodes are present: \\"Race Mode\\" and \\"Time Trial Mode\\". In Race Mode, the player is pitted against five computer-controlled opponents to try and make it to the bottom of the course, the goal being to finish in first place. Finishing in first place will show the player a replay of their performance in the game. Time Trial Mode has the player going down a course solo; this mode adds a time limit that counts down as the game progresses, and will cause the game to end if it fully depletes. A second of time can be restored by passing through large gates found scattered across the course. In one of the courses, Pac-Man can be seen on a billboard sporting a Santa hat. Reception At the 1995 Amusement and Music Operators Association (AMOA) exposition in Illinois, Alpine Racer was given the \\"Best New Equipment\\" in the \\"Coin-Operated Arcade/Redemption Game\\" category based on executive vote. In Japan, Game Machine listed it on their August 15, 1995 issue as being the most-successful dedicated arcade game of the year. The game sold an estimated 2,000 arcade units worldwide, making it a highly sought-after cabinet by arcade collectors. In 1996, Leisure Line reported it was the most-successful arcade game in Japan, topping Namco's own Tekken 2 and Sega's Virtua Cop 2. Alpine Racer was critically acclaimed by critics. Play magazine called it a \\"superb\\" skiing simulator, while Hobby Hi-Tech greatly appreciated its hardware and realism. Many publications applauded the control style for being heavily unique compared to other games, with Play saying that alongside its accurate portrayal of alpine skiing it made for a \\"brilliant\\" video game experience. Next Generation, who gave the game a perfect score, identified the controls as being its strong point, saying that it gave a true sense of realism and was an accurate portrayal of actual skiing. Next Generation also stated that the \\"atypical approach and its success in execution\\" made Alpine Racer one of Namco's best coin-op games of the era, adding that its premise could also help attract players of both genders into arcades. The graphics were also the subject of praise, with GameFan describing them as \\"nothing short of shocking\\" and Next Generation liking their attention to detail. Allgame appreciated the game's concept for making it stand out among other racing games. The Spanish magazine Ultima Generacion found the game to be far superior than many of Sega's racing games, such as Sega Rally, which they criticized for being based on pre-existing ideas with little attempt towards an original concept. They commended Alpine Racer for its bizarre yet unique game idea, saying it could help attract more women and children into arcades for its appealing and interesting premise. Ultima Generacion also commended Namco's efforts at using the game to help break the common consensus at the time that arcades housed mostly violent titles unsuitable for younger players, which they said was thanks to its impressive arcade hardware and realism. In an interview for Financial Times, Pac-Man creator Toru Iwatani stated that games such as Alpine Racer helped bring players into the \\"heart\\" of arcade games with unique controls instead of what he described as a \\"complex set of controls\\". Legacy Alpine Racer spawned a series of sequels and remakes. Alpine Racer 2 was released in 1996 for arcades, featuring three selectable skiers, new courses to race on, and a multiplayer mode made possible through linking multiple cabinets together. A snowboard-themed spin-off game, Alpine Surfer, was released the same year. A PlayStation 2 sequel was released in 2002, Alpine Racer 3, adding new gamemodes, selectable characters and other additions to the core gameplay. A sequel for Japanese mobile phones, Alpine Racer EX, was released in 2007, followed by a \\"widescreen\\" version the same year. Namco Networks produced an iOS remake of the original Alpine Racer in 2009, which was subsequently ported to the Zeebo the same year. A second arcade sequel, Super Alpine Racer, was released by Namco Bandai Games in 2014. In 2004, Harvard University sleep scientist Robert Stickgold used Tetris and Alpine Racer to study the relationship between learning and sleep. He determined that patients who played Alpine Racer before sleeping, including those who suffered from Anterograde amnesia, dreamed of skiing.

Biography  = Early life and Family = Zundel was born on the first day of Rosh Hashana in 1786 in Salantai, Lithuania. Little is known of his early years. He descended from Rabbi Faivush Ashkenazi of Vilna (late 17th-early 18th century) and his father was Rabbi Benyamin Beinush, who was a shochet and hazzan in Salant. As a young man, Zundel studied in the Volozhin Yeshiva under Rabbi Chaim Volozhin. Following Rabbi Chaim's death in 1821, Zundel would make trips to study with Rabbi Akiva Eiger. Salant's wife was Rochel Rivkah, and they had three children, two daughters, Tziviah and Heniah, and an only son, Aryeh Leib. Rabbi Yosef Zundel of Salant refused to accept any rabbinical positions. He ran a small business which produced only a meager living. He chose to spend much of his time immersed in Torah studies and musar. = Later life and impact = Zundel provided the spiritual inspiration for his most famous student, Rabbi Yisrael Salanter, the founder of the Musar movement. During the early years of the Musar movement, Reb Zundel was seen in the marketplace on Friday afternoons reminding the merchants that the Jewish Sabbath was approaching so they had time to close their stalls and avoid its desecration. Rabbi Yosef Zundel, who was a student of the Vilna Gaon in every sense of the word, longed to settle in the Land of Israel. Finally, in 1838-39, despite the hardships of such a trip due to the ongoing war between the Ottoman Empire and Egypt, Rabbi Zundel nevertheless took his family and traveled to Jerusalem. The Ashkenazi community in Jerusalem at that time was under the leadership and financial support of the Kollel Vilna, whose headquarters were in Amsterdam. It was led by a committee under a wealthy Dutch Jewish banker, Rabbi Avraham Zvi Hirsch Lehren (1784‚Äì1853). Rabbi Lehren had, in 1817, assumed the mantle of leadership of an organization founded in 1809 known as Pekidim and Amarkalim of Eretz Yisrael (\\"Officials and Administrators of the Land of Israel\\"). This charitable organization was in charge of the collection, administration, and disbursement of all the monies collected in Western Europe on behalf of the Ashkenazi Jewish community in the Land of Israel. Although Rabbi Zundel was an extremely unpretentious individual, Rabbi Lehren was keenly aware of his greatness and had tremendous respect for him. Rabbi Zundel's knowledge of Torah was extraordinary, and the entire scope of Torah was clearly engraved on his heart and mind. He was also a Tzadik extraordinaire. In 1837, Zundel settled in Jerusalem, where, at the urging of Rabbi Lehren, he served as the rabbi of the Ashkenazi community. For centuries, all halachic disputes and queries in Jerusalem were brought to the Sephardi rabbinical court, which adjudicated them. Due to the recent growth of the Ashkenazi community, Rabbi Lehren wanted Ashkenazim to have independence and to adjudicate disputes in their own rabbinical court. Rabbi Yosef Zundel agreed on the condition that he would not be paid a salary for his services. Throughout his life he had worked to support himself in a manner that did not cause him to benefit from Torah, and he wanted to maintain that practice. Furthermore, he had always shunned all positions of honor and distinction. He also stipulated that as soon as he would find a suitable replacement, he would relinquish his position to the other person. Rabbi Zundel opened the Beis Din, albeit as a temporary court. In time though, both the Ashkenazi and Sephardi communities in Jerusalem recognized Rabbi Zundel's greatness and brought him all their halachic questions and issues. In 1841, when his son-in-law Rabbi Shmuel Salant arrived in Jerusalem, Rabbi Zundel asked him to join the Beis Din. Not long afterwards, Rabbi Zundel, realizing the vast greatness of his son-in-law, appointed him as the official head of the rabbinical court, a position that Rabbi Shmuel held for almost seventy years until his death in 1909. Rabbi Shmuel held the title of \\"first Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem.\\" Rabbi Zundel lived in a small one-room apartment in the Hurva Synagogue complex in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City. Rabbi Zundel sustained himself and his family by selling vinegar, but spent most of the day and night in the Menachem Zion Synagogue, which was completed in 1837. Built by the Perushim (students of the Vilna Gaon), it was named after their leader Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Shklov. Rabbi Zundel lived an esoteric lifestyle and radiated spirituality to the entire community. Rabbi Zundel was instrumental in the founding of the famed Etz Chaim Yeshiva, the Bikur Cholim Hospital and Hevrah Kadisha, and aided in the absorption of new immigrants in Jerusalem. Rabbi Zundel and Rabbi Shmuel worked together tirelessly for the benefit of the community. In 1860 they founded the Rabbi Meir Baal Haness charity, which became the foundation of support for the entire community at large, and saved it from sinking into a financial abyss. Unfortunately, Rabbi Zundel lived for only a few years after its establishment. However, during the final years of his life, he devoted himself wholly to bringing this monumental undertaking to fruition; upon his passing the Rabbi Meir Baal Haness charity had already become a lifeline for hundreds of poor and destitute families. During the 1860s, the water supply to Jerusalem was very poor, despite several attempts by the Ottoman authorities to repair the ancient conduit from A'yn Arrub and Solomon's Pools. The stone pipes were regularly sabotaged by the Arab farmers who earned a nice living selling water that they brought in unhygienic animal-skin bags from A'yn Rogel and the Gihon Spring through the Dung Gate. The water was sold at a high price, even though it was of poor taste, smelled foul and was dangerous to consume without boiling it first. This water supply depended mainly on the cisterns dug near or even under the houses, in which rainwater collected. In the 1860s there were almost a thousand of these. This water was only fit for drinking as long as it was not contaminated by sewage water. There was no sewage system in Jerusalem at the time, and sewage often ran in the street, seeping into the wells. The pollution of the drinking water brought about a severe plague, which claimed hundreds of victims, and led to the city being placed under quarantine for four months. Sir Moses Montefiore came to the aid of the inhabitants by contributing money for improving the water supply. = Death = Rabbi Yosef Zundel Salant died due to the plague on Friday, October 12, (3rd Cheshvan) 1866 and was buried on the Mount of Olives. Among the many instructions that Rabbi Zundel mentioned in his will was that no eulogies be held for him, and no titles should be added to his name on the tombstone. Rabbi Yisrael Salanter, the founder of the ethical Musar movement and prime student of Rabbi Zundel, is recorded as having said: \\"I have not found a true servant of God like my mentor Rabbi Zundel!\\".

Built in 1767, it is a replica of the 1st-century Temple of Fortuna Virilis in Rome. The Temple stands in Mill Wood, a 17-acre (7 ha) pleasure garden in the grounds of Halswell House, and was built for Sir Charles Kemeys-Tynte in 1767 to designs by Thomas Prowse, with features by Robert Adam and Thomas Stocking. The Temple was dedicated to the memory of a mutual friend, Peregrine Palmer, formerly MP for Oxford University (d 1762). The Temple has a slate roof and pedimental end gables, and is surrounded with Ionic columns and pilasters. It is aligned north-west/south- east, with the portico at the south-east end, facing Halswell House which lies some distant. The Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust (SBPT) acquired the Temple in 1993 in a derelict condition, having been used for many years as a cattle shelter. It has now been restored, with grants from English Heritage and others, and is a Grade II* listed building. Its dimensions at its base are approximately , and it now has the addition of a tie bar, a long retaining bolt that runs through the structure from one side to the other, helping to keep it together. John Walsh's marble statue in the temple depicting Terpsichore, the Muse of joy in the dance and lyric poetry, was dedicated to the memory of Thomas Prowse after his death in 1767. This was copied in 1999 and the copy is now located here. The original is in the Museum of Somerset, Taunton. The Temple is owned and managed by the Halswell Park Trust and is occasionally opened to the public. It has recently been surrounded with unsightly deer fencing.

Shown are the entry (green), the holding fix (red) and the holding pattern itself (blue) In aviation, holding (or flying a hold) is a maneuver designed to delay an aircraft already in flight while keeping it within a specified airspace.Instrument Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-15A), Chapter 10. Implementation A holding pattern for instrument flight rules (IFR) aircraft is usually a racetrack pattern based on a holding fix. This fix can be a radio beacon such as a non-directional beacon (NDB) or VHF omnidirectional range (VOR). The fix is the start of the first turn of the racetrack pattern. Aircraft will fly towards the fix, and once there will enter a predefined racetrack pattern. A standard holding pattern uses right- hand turns and takes approximately 4 minutes to complete (one minute for each 180-degree turn, and two one-minute straight ahead sections). Deviations from this pattern can happen if long delays are expected; longer legs (usually two or three minutes) may be used, or aircraft with distance measuring equipment (DME) may be assigned patterns with legs defined in nautical miles rather than minutes. Less frequent turns are more comfortable for passengers and crew. Additionally, left-hand turns may be assigned to some holding patterns if there are airspace or traffic restrictions nearby. In the absence of a radio beacon, the holding fix can be any fixed point in the air, and can be created using two crossing VHF omnidirectional range radials (also called intersection), or it can be at a specific distance from a VOR using a coupled distance measuring equipment. When DME is used, the inbound turn of the racetrack may be permanently defined by distance limits rather than in minutes. Furthermore, in appropriately equipped aircraft, GPS waypoints may be used to define the holding pattern, eliminating the need for ground-based navigational aids entirely. A hold for visual flight rules aircraft is usually a (smaller) racetrack pattern flown over something easily recognizable on the ground, such as a bridge, highway intersection or lake. Usage The primary use of a holding is delaying aircraft that have arrived at their destination but cannot land yet because of traffic congestion, poor weather, or runway unavailability (for instance, during snow removal or emergencies). Several aircraft may fly the same holding pattern at the same time, separated vertically by or more. This is generally described as a stack or holding stack. As a rule, new arrivals will be added at the top. The aircraft at the bottom of the stack will be taken out and allowed to make an approach first, after which all aircraft in the stack move down one level, and so on. Air traffic control (ATC) will control the whole process, in some cases using a dedicated controller (called a stack controller) for each individual pattern. One airport may have several holding patterns; depending on where aircraft arrive from or which runway is in use, or because of vertical airspace limitations. Since an aircraft with an emergency has priority over all other air traffic, it will always be allowed to bypass the holding pattern and go directly to the airport (if possible). This causes more delays for other aircraft already in the stack.14 CFR 91.3 ‚Äì Responsibility and authority of the pilot in command. http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_01/14cfr91_01.html Limiting usage of holdings Aircraft flying in circles is an inefficient (and hence costly) usage of time and fuel, so measures are taken to limit the amount of holding necessary. Air traffic flow management is used to delay aircraft while grounded at their departure points when delays are expected at their destinations. Flying a holding pattern Many aircraft have a specific holding speed published by the manufacturer; this is a lower speed at which the aircraft uses less fuel per hour than normal cruise speeds. Typical holding speeds for transport category aircraft are . Holding speeds are a function of aircraft weight at the point of holding. If possible, a holding pattern is flown with flaps and landing gear up to save fuel. Entry procedures and accurate flying of the holding procedure are essential parts of IFR pilot training, and will always be tested on examination flights. Modern autopilots, coupled with flight management systems, can enter and fly holding patterns automatically. Entry procedures The entry to a holding pattern is often the hardest part for a novice pilot to grasp, and determining and executing the proper entry while simultaneously controlling the aircraft, navigating and communicating with ATC requires practice. There are three standard types of entries: direct, parallel, and offset (teardrop). The proper entry procedure is determined by the angle difference between the direction the aircraft flies to arrive at the beacon and the direction of the inbound leg of the holding pattern.Instrument Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-15A), Standard Entry Procedures, page 10-12. * A direct entry is performed just as its name would suggest: the aircraft flies directly to the holding fix, and immediately begins the first turn outbound. * In a parallel entry, the aircraft flies to the holding fix, parallels the inbound course for one minute outbound, and then turns back, re-intercepting the inbound track, and continues in the hold from there. * In an offset or teardrop entry, the aircraft flies to the holding fix, turns into the protected area, flies for one minute, and then turns back inbound, proceeding to the fix and continuing from there. File:HoldDirectEntry.svgDirect entry (Sector 3) File:HoldParallelEntry.svgParallel entry (Sector 1) File:HoldTeardropEntry.svgTeardrop entry (Sector 2) The parallel and teardrop entry are mirrored in case of a left-hand holding pattern. Speed limits Maximum holding speeds are established to keep aircraft within the protected holding area during their one-minute (one-minute and a half above MSL) inbound and outbound legs. For civil aircraft (not military) in the United States, these airspeeds are: * Up to MSL: 200 KIAS * From MSL: 230 KIAS * MSL and above: 265 KIAS The ICAO Maximum holding speeds:ICAO Doc 8168 Vol. I, Aircraft Operations, Volume I Flight Procedures, Part I ‚Äî Section 6, Chapter 1. http://dcaa.slv.dk:8000/icaodocs/Doc%208168%20-%20Aircraft%20Operations/Volume%201%20Flight%20Procedures,%205th%20ed..pdf * Up to : * : * : * Above : M0.83 With their higher performance characteristics, military aircraft have higher holding speed limits.

If the inbound time is more than one minute, subtract the same number of seconds from the outbound leg. **E.g., inbound time is 0:55 ‚Üí outbound time is 1:05. **E.g., inbound time is 1:06 ‚Üí outbound time is 0:54. *More precise method: Subtract 2/3 of the error (in seconds) for inbound legs more than one minute, and add 3/2 of the error (in seconds) for inbound legs of less than one minute. **E.g., inbound time is 0:56 ‚Üí error is 4 seconds. Thus +3/2*4=+6. 1:00+0:06=1:06. Fly 1:06 outbound. **E.g., inbound time is 1:06 ‚Üí error is 6 seconds. Thus ‚àí2/3*6=‚àí4. 1:00‚àí0:04=0:56. Fly 0:56 outbound. *Additionally, for an initial estimate, add the headwind or subtract the tailwind component's speed in knots. **E.g., initial outbound with a tailwind component of 7 knots ‚Üí initial outbound time is 0:53. **E.g., initial outbound with a headwind component of 20 knots ‚Üí initial outbound time is 1:20.

He captained the national team, the All Blacks, 17 times in tests. He is a second-generation All Black; his father Ray Dalton played in two All Blacks tests in the late 1940s.  Early years  Although born in Dunedin, he was schooled at Selwyn College in Auckland (not to be confused with Selwyn College at the University of Otago), playing for the school's first team in 1968 and 1969 as a prop. He then returned to the South Island, enrolling at Lincoln College (then a part of the University of Canterbury) to study for a Bachelor of Agricultural Science. While there, he converted to hooker, and represented Canterbury at under-20 and senior reserve level. After graduating, he returned to Auckland, playing for the senior B side at the Eastern club. In 1975, he moved to Bombay to start a career as a farm adviser, and won representative selection for the first time at Counties. The following year, which was the first of the National Provincial Championship (the predecessor to today's Air New Zealand Cup), he was named captain at Counties.  All Blacks  Dalton earned his first All Blacks cap during their 1977 tour of France. He also played all four tests on their successful Grand Slam tour of Great Britain and Ireland in 1978, scoring the only try in their encounter with . By 1981, he had become the regular All Blacks hooker, and captained the side for the first time when Graham Mourie was unavailable for the series against . Dalton became the full-time captain upon Mourie's 1982 retirement, most notably leading the All Blacks against the Lions during their 1983 tour. He was chosen as captain for their aborted 1985 tour of South Africa, and went on to captain the unofficial Cavaliers tour of South Africa in 1986. He suffered a broken jaw In the second match of the tour and played no more rugby that season. Dalton was one of the most successful All Blacks captains in history, victorious in 15 of his 17 tests as captain. He was named captain of the side that would go on to win the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup, but suffered an injury in a practice session that ruled him out of the tournament, leaving the honour of lifting the Webb Ellis Cup to David Kirk.  After rugby  After his retirement from rugby immediately after the 1987 World Cup, he continued his career in agriculture for a time, but later became a corporate manager. He coached Counties from 1989 to 1991, and was president of the New Zealand Rugby Union from 1999 to 2000. He is now the CEO of the Auckland Rugby Football Union, having also been CEO of the Auckland Blues until those roles were separated in 2014, and operates a farm in the Bombay Hills south of Auckland.

The barrage is 287.5m long and has water throughout the year which is fed from the river Asan and the discharge channel of the river Yamuna. Recently declared as Uttarakhand's first Ramsar site.So added in the list of internationally important wetlands. Directly behind the barrage on its eastern flank, water reenters the Eastern Yamuna Canal on the west side of the Yamuna River. At a distance of from the barrage on the canal, water reaches the 30 MW Kulhal Power Plant at . The power plant contains three 10 MW Kaplan turbine-generators and has a design hydraulic head of . Once discharged from the power station, the water is conducted by the canal to the 72 MW Khara Power Station at in Uttar Pradesh. The Khara Power Station contains three 24 MW Francis turbine-generators and a has a net head of . The dam creates the Asan Reservoir, also called Dhalipur Lake. The lake is popular for bird watching and 53 species are known to make a habitat there, 19 species are migratory from Eurasia. Asan River The Asan river is a river fed by the streams of the western part of the Doon valley. The northern section of the river is known locally as the 'Tons nadi' (a misnomer, the actual Tons nadi is much larger and flows into the Yamuna in the Jaunsar Bawar region at Kalsi); originates from the southern slopes of Mussorie. There are several streams here, that gradually merge into one river that emerges from Robber's cave. The river here is in a U-shaped valley meandering slightly in a south-westerly direction. The river flows through Bijapur canal; a major water pumping site of Dehradun that provides water to houses in the western part of the town through two water canals. It then moves on to Tapkeshwar Mahadev, a popular Shiva shrine before becoming a more shallow, broad valley near Premnagar. The river proceeds south-west, receiving the waters of several streams flowing southward from the northern range spanning Vikas Nagar - Mussorie; and northward from the lower Shiwalik forest hills that separate The Doon valley from Saharanpur district. In the lower section it is known as the 'Asan'. It flows into a relatively flat section which feeds the Asan barrage, the waters of which drain into the Yamuna at Poanta Sahib. The Asan River has been identified with the Asmanvati of the Rigveda.  Assan Barrage Bird Sanctuary  The Bird Sanctuary was established in 1967 as a manmade wetland where rivers Yamuna and Asan converged. This area attracts a large number of migratory birds, including birds that are extremely endangered and in the IUCN Red list. The best time to visit the Barrage is between October and December, and between mid-March to the end of April. The barrage is open all days of the week, from 8am to 6pm. Boating and bird- watching are two activities that tourists enjoy here.

Ko has won various Korean poetry prizes as well as the Lucian Blaga International Poetry Festival Grand Prize in Romania. Some of his poetry has also been translated into Spanish. He also has won the Modern Korean Literature Translation Award. Much of Ko's poetry reflects his knowledge of Western culture and literature, as seen in such poems as \\"To Marc Chagall.\\" Other poems examine and reflect on his experience in Korea (e.g., \\"In a Remote Korean Village\\") and other places around the world (e.g., his long poem, \\"Mohenjo-Daro\\"). Many, though not all, of his poems are set out-of-doors. Some of these place the poet in the setting. Publications * What the Spider Said: Poems of Chang Soo Ko. Translated by the poet.

Location  Airport City Airport City is located in New Belgrade's Block 65, in the area previously known as Dojno Polje. To the east and northeast it borders the neighborhoods of Be≈æanija and Be≈æanijska Kosa. The To≈°in Bunar Street marks the east border of the neighborhood, Omladinskih Brigada the northeast and Djordja Stojanoviƒáa the south. On the north there are other facilities in the Block 65, including the residential complex West 65 and the headquarters of the N1 Television. Southwest from Airport City is the vast, former industrial complex, which includes the factories like the Industry of Machinery and Tractors and the Industry of Metal Castings.

Dojno Polje Airport  West of Be≈æanija and south of Zemun, between the village and the Sava river, is the location of the old Belgrade airport which was finished in March 1927. The locality was called Dojno Polje. As it is located along the To≈°in Bunar Street, though administratively part of the village of Be≈æanija at the time, the airport is often referred to as both the Be≈æanija Airport and Airport on To≈°in Bunar. Construction of an airfield began in 1923. An initiative asked for the creation of the airline company in 1926 which was approved by the government on 23 March 1926. Then the initial public offering began but largely failed as only 10% of the planned amount was gathered. According to the existing laws, the airline company was to be closed even before it was officially formed. In order to boost the sale of the shares, pilot Tadija Sondermajer decided to conduct the promotional flight Paris-Bombay-Belgrade. With his colleague , he started the journey on 20 April 1927 from Paris, arriving back to Belgrade after 11 days and , on 8 May. They were awaited as heroes by the crowd of 30,000.

The Luftwaffe had an instrument flying school here for more than 2 years and fighters and bombers were based here for short periods, primarily to fly support for anti-partisan operations. New administrative building was constructed in 1931 and to celebrate the occasion, a big air show of the biplanes was held. It was destroyed by the Germans in 1944, and became defunct in 1962 when the new airport near the village of Surƒçin was finished (today's Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport). In April 2016 works began on the construction of the access road to the Ada Bridge. During works on the new boulevard, remnants of the old airport's runway, hangars and warehouses were discovered.  History  Construction of Airport City began on 4 May 2005. In the first phase, a total of 4 buildings, out of planned 14, has been built (2 were finished by April, and 2 by June 2006).

It was later spun off into the television series Heartbreak High. Plot Christina Papadopoulos (Claudia Karvan) is a sweet and well-meaning 22-year-old school teacher, engaged to ambitious lawyer Dimitri (Steve Bastoni). Christina's entire future seems planned out for her‚Äîalbeit planned by her fianc√©, her father and her priest. Lively 17-year-old Nick Polides (Alex Dimitriades) is a student in Christina's Greek class. Nick finds himself attracted to Christina and makes numerous passes at her which she rebuffs off. But her resistance begins to crumble as both begin to rebel against the constricting Greek-Australian cultural restraints put upon them. When Christina becomes the manager of the school's newly formed soccer team, she and Nick begin to spend more time together outside of school hours. Though Christina is initially hesitant at Nick's continuous advances, she soon gives into impulses and engages in an illicit consensual relationship with Nick. She uses the house left by her friend for rendezvous with Nick outside school hours. Their amorous relationship progresses fast as they fall in love with each other. But as the news of their relationship leaks out, Christina faces severe shaming at her workplace. She is further berated by Nick's father for breaking the trust placed upon her as a teacher. Her fian‚Äå‚Äå‚Äå‚Äåce comes to know of the relationship and gives her a choice that he's willing to let the matter slide if she promises to act as if her past with Nick never occurred. But Christina,by then very much in love with Nick and tired of her overbearing fianc√©, breaks off the engagement and leaves to meet up with Nick. She tells Nick of her decision to leave Dimitri and mentions that she would be pursuing degree for a year until Nick graduates. An overjoyed Nick readily agrees and promises to meet up after a year. The film ends on a positive note with their kiss and soccer-play under the sun.

The village is located north of Sydney and the nearest major centres are Singleton some southwest and Maitland to the south. In the , it had a population of 289. History The traditional owners of the area are the Gringai clan of the Wonnarua people, a group of Indigenous Australians. The town is probably named for Gresford in Wales. Location There are actually two small villages with the name 'Gresford'. There is Gresford (or West Gresford) on the Singleton side and East Gresford on the Maitland side. It appears that Gresford is the original township, as it is older and the location of the school and local Anglican church. But East Gresford is much larger and has the main shopping area. It is also home to the Gresford Scorpions Soccer Club. The Gresford & District Community Group produces the Gresford News, a monthly four colour production which reports on activities in the district. It has a circulation of 800. The Community Group is also responsible for the creation of an arboretum featuring endangered and local native trees. Now in its third year of development there is increasing interest by groups to visit and learn about these important shrubs and trees. East Gresford is close to the Barrington Tops National Park, which includes the highest peak in the Hunter Valley and is a World Heritage site. It also snows in the area each winter. In 2020 the annual Gresford Show was held in March. The highly successful Gresford Billycart Derby is held on Easter Saturday. The showground is used a camping site as it located beside the Allyn River. However, the 2020 event has been cancelled due to the restrictions on public movements following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. More information and updates on activities can also be obtained from the monthly publication of the Gresford News which is also available on-line. Climate The areas surrounding East Gresford have a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) with hot summers and cool drier winters, similar to the Greater Western Sydney region.

Early career 118 New Walk, Leicester: Gimson's childhood home Ernest Gimson was born in Leicester, in the East Midlands of England, in 1864, the son of Josiah Gimson, engineer and iron founder, founder of Gimson and Company, owner of the Vulcan Works. Ernest was articled to the Leicester architect, Isaac Barradale, and worked at his offices on Grey Friars between 1881 and 1885. Aged 19, he attended a lecture on 'Art and Socialism' at the Leicester Secular Society given by the leader of the Arts and Crafts revival in Victorian England, William Morris, and, greatly inspired, talked with him until two in the morning, after the lecture.Ernest's brother Sidney provides a vivid account of this meeting, in a 1932 account of the Leicester Secular Society, now in the Leicestershire Records Office and quoted at length in Comino (1980), p,13-15 Sidney's recollections can be read at http://leicestersecularsociety.org.uk/PHP_redirected/gimson.php#ernest Two years later, aged 21, Gimson had both architectural experience and a first class result from classes at Leicester School of Art. He moved to London to gain wider experience, and William Morris wrote him letters of recommendation. The first architectural practice he approached was John Dando Sedding, where he was taken on, and stayed for two years. From Sedding, Gimson derived his interest in craft techniques, the stress on textures and surfaces, naturalistic detail of flowers, leaves and animals, always drawn from life, the close involvement of the architect in the simple processes of building and in the supervision of a team of craftsmen employed direct. Seddings offices were next door to the showrooms of Morris & Co., providing opportunity to see first hand the first flourishing of Arts and Crafts design. He met Ernest Barnsley at Sedding‚Äôs studio, and through him, Sidney Barnsley, a friendship that was to last the rest of his life. After a brief period traveling in both Britain and Europe, Gimson settled in London again and in 1889 he joined Morris‚Äôs Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB). In 1890, he was a founder member of the short-lived furniture company, Kenton and Co., with Sidney Barnsley, Alfred Hoare Powell, W.R. Lethaby, Mervyn Macartney, Col. Mallet and Reginald Blomfield. Here they acted as designers rather than craftsmen and explored inventive ways of articulating traditional crafts, \\"the common facts of traditional building\\", as Philip Webb, \\"their particular prophet\\", had taught. Gimson had also, through the Art Workers' Guild, become interested in a more hands on approach to traditional crafts, and in 1890 spent time with Philip Clissett in Bosbury, Herefordshire, learning to make rush-seated ladderback chairs. He also began experimenting with plaster work. Sapperton, Gloucestershire Gimson and the Barnsley brothers moved to the rural region of the Cotswolds in Gloucestershire in 1893 \\"to live near to nature\\". They soon settled at Pinbury Park, near Sapperton, on the Cirencester estate, under the patronage of the Bathurst family. In 1900, he set up a small furniture workshop in Cirencester, moving to larger workshops at Daneway House, a small medieval manor house at Sapperton, where he stayed until his death in 1919. He strove to invigorate the village community and, encouraged by his success, planned to found a Utopian craft village. He concentrated on designing furniture, made by craftsmen, under his chief cabinet-maker, Peter van der Waals, whom he engaged in 1901. Architectural work Inglewood (1892), Ratcliffe Road, Leicester The White House (1898), North Avenue, Leicester His architectural commissions include ;Inglewood and The White House: (1892 & 1898) in the prosperous Leicester suburb of Stoneygate; ;Lea, Stoneywell and Rockyfield Cottages: in Ulverscroft, Charnwood Forest, Leicestershire (with Detmar Blow in 1897/9; Rockyfield 1909), all as summer retreats for his siblings. In February 2013 the National Trust bought Stoneywell; it opened to the public in February 2015;, Stoneywell blog, 2013. ;The Leasowes: his own cottage, at Sapperton (1903, with a thatched roof, since burnt); ;alterations to Pinbury Park (with plasterwork) and Waterlane House: (1908), both in Gloucestershire; ;Kelmscott: cottages and the village hall (completed under Norman Jewson in 1933), Oxfordshire; ;Coxen: at Budleigh Salterton, Devon, constructed in cob; the work was done a year or two before the war; this is Mr. Gimson‚Äôs own description of the manner of its building: ‚ÄúThe cob was made of the stiff sand found on the site; this was mixed with water and a great quantity of long wheat straw trodden into it. The walls were built 3 ft. thick, pared down to 2 ft. 6 in., and were placed on a plinth standing 18 in. above the ground floor, and built of cobble stones found among the sand. The walls were given a coat of plaster and a coat of rough-cast, which was gently trowelled over to smooth the surface slightly. I believe eight men were engaged on the cobwork, some preparing the material, and others treading in on to the top of the walls. It took them about three months to reach the wall plate; the cost was 6s. a cubic yard, exclusive of the plastering. No centring was used. The joists rested on plates, and above them the walls were reduced to 2 ft. 2 in. in thickness to leave the ends of the joists free. The beams also rested on wide plates and the ends were built round with stone, leaving space for ventilation. Tile or slate lintels were used over all openings. The cost of the whole house was 6¬Ωd. a cubic foot. Building with cob is soon learnt‚Äîof the eight men, only one of them had had any previous experience, and, I believe, he had not built with it for thirty years. This is the only house I have built of cob.‚Äù ;Whaplode Church window: Lincolnshire. ;Competition designs: His competition 'Design for the Federal Capital of Australia' (1908) is an original project in town planning for the city which was to become Canberra. He also submitted a design for new offices for the Port of London Authority.leicester.gov.uk Gimson's architectural work Leicester Arts and Museums Service 2007. Accessed 14 October 2012 ;Bedales: His last major project was the Memorial Library (1918‚Äì1919) built next to the 1911 Lupton Hall (also a Gimson design) at Bedales School, near Petersfield, Hampshire (where his brother was a teacher) (built at his request by Geoffrey Lupton under Sidney Barnsley's supervision and completed in 1921). Legacy The Sapperton workshop was closed after Gimson's death, but many of the craftsmen went with Peter van der Waals to his new premises in Chalford. His architectural style is \\"solid and lasting as the pyramids‚Ä¶ yet gracious and homelike\\" (H. Wilson, 1899). Lethaby described him as an idealist individualist: \\"Work not words, things not designs, life not rewards were his aims.\\" Norman Jewson was his foremost student, who carried his design principles into the next generation and described his studio practices in his classic memoir By Chance I did Rove (1951). Today his furniture and craft work is regarded as a supreme achievement of its period and is well represented in the principal collections of the decorative arts in Britain and the United States of America. Specialist collections of his work may be seen in England at the Leicester Museum & Art Gallery, and in Gloucestershire at the Cheltenham Art Gallery and Museum, Rodmarton Manor and Owlpen Manor.

It is approximately long. It has a maximum (regulated) depth of 47.2 m, with a surface elevation of 357 m above sea level. Its level is raised in the summer and then drawn down in the winter months to reach points of as low as 16 feet below the maximum level. It is the second largest body of water entirely within the province of Ontario (Lake Nipigon being first). The lake consists of open water bays, narrow channels, and islands. It is a relatively shallow lake with many rock shoals. This provides a good habitat for Walleye aka yellow pickerel and Northern pike as well as Yellow Perch. During the Lac Seul project of 1968-1972 no muskelunge aka masquinonge were noted in the catches of research nets set over those years. Significant numbers of whitefish, tullibee, burbot and cisco were noted as well although they infrequently were noted in the sport fishery. Lac Seul is noted for offering some of the best fishing in Ontario. Lac Seul is located on the former lake bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz. Owing to this previous lake, much of the bottom of Lac Seul is covered with thick deposits of lacustrine silts and varved clay of varying thickness. The water of Lac Seul is tea colored. In clear water Walleye only feed at dusk and dawn because of their light-sensitive eyes, but because of the tea color of Lac Seul, it provides excellent Walleye and Northern Pike angling opportunities throughout the day. Lac Seul provides some of the finest trophy Northern Pike and Walleye and also provides access to the vast, practically untouched wilderness surrounding it. The numerous islands on Lac Seul are considered regionally significant calving habitat for the rare boreal woodland caribou. The natural capacity of Lac Seul is augmented by the diversion of water from the Albany River drainage basin at Lake St. Joseph, allowing hydroelectric stations at Ear Falls where the English River leaves the lake, and Manitou Falls, 30 km downstream, to generate 90600 kW of electricity.

There is good view of Pawana lake from the summit. History Steps leading up to the ramparts of the fort. Little is known about the origins of this fort. There is a vihara on the fort datable to circa seventh-eight centuries A.D. Malik Ahmad Nizam Shah I of the Nizam Shahi dynasty conquered the fort in 1585 and annexed it to the Nizam territory. In 1657, Shivaji Maharaj brought the whole of Konkan, which had been Nizam territory, under his control when he conquered Tikona along with the forts of Karnala, Lohgad, Mahuli, Songad, Tala, and Visapur.http://trekshitiz.com/ trekshitiz/Ei/Tikona-Trek-Pune-District.html This fort was a strategic nexus: the centre of control for the entire Pawana Mawal region. In 1660, Dhamale family, the Deshmukhs from Maval region were charged with ensuring the security of fort Tikona.It was under the Dhamale Deshmukh family for long time. Jaysingh invaded the region in 1665 and attacked the local villages but the forts held out. Tikona fort was surrendered to the Mughal warrior Kubadkhan, who had attacked the region together with Halal Khan and others, according to the Treaty of Purandar signed on 12 June 1665. Kubad Khan took over the fort on 18 June but it was later recaptured by the Marathas. In 1682 King Sambhaji met Aurangzeb's son Akbar. After the meeting the Akbar was offered to stay on Tikona fort, however he was shifted to Jaitapur as the climate didn't suit him. A small battle was fought by Maratha army with British in 1818, before it was captured by the latter. How to reach The nearest town is Kamshet which is 51;km from Pune. The base village of the fort is Tikona peth which is 26 km from Kamshet. There are good hotels at Kamshet, now tea and snacks are also available in small hotels at Tikonapeth and Kale colony. The trekking path starts from the hillock south of the parking area near Tikonapeth. The route is very safe and wide. There are few trees on the trekking route. It takes about an hour to reach the entrance gate of the fort. There are very steep and high, which makes the climb a thrilling experience. There is very less space on the fort. It is advisable not to accompany large groups for climbing the fort. The steps are so narrow that only a single person can climb at a time. The night stay on the fort can be made in the caves either near the entrance of the fort or on the top of the fort.

Ni√±o de Cebu in Southwoods Interchange Bi√±an City, Laguna, Philippines. Its primary and secondary education programs are accredited Level III by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities. While it is not the oldest Augustinian school in the Philippines named Colegio San Agust√≠n (that distinction belongs to Colegio San Agustin-Bacolod), it is the second most prominent next to CSA-Makati among its sister schools. And like the students of its sister schools (Colegio San Agustin-Bacolod, Colegio San Agustin- Makati, & Colegio San Agustin-Bulacan), the students of CSA-Southwoods are also called Augustinians (Filipino: Agustino). History The school began as a preparatory school for boys and girls attending preschool through third grade. Incorporated on November 16, 1984, it is located on a five-hectare site donated by a private land developer to the Augustinian Province of Santo Ni√±o de Cebu. The first faculty and staff consisted of twenty personnel and three priest-administrators catering to the needs of 646 students. The founding administrators included Rev. Rodolfo P. Sicio, OSA as Rector and Principal, Rev. Alfredo Jubac, OSA as treasurer, and Rev. Marcelino Malana, OSA as a guidance counselor and sports coordinator. Miss Doris S. Calog serves as the school Registrar, Assistant Principal, and Academic Coordinator of all departments. Three of the pioneer personnel still connected/works at present namely: Nelia O. Villodres (Grade School Faculty), Adelfa Tamayo-Lira (Canteen-In-Charge), and Bernard G. Miranda (Digital Printing In-Charge). The Preschool Department was part of the Colegio San Agustin since it started the operation in June 1985. There were 290 pupils in its first year of operation. The department continued to expand its structure as more pupils were added each year. Improving the curriculum was done in response to the needs of the pupils. Total enrollment peaked at 790 in the academic year 1992-1993. Appropriate measures were introduced to effectively manage the growing pupils' populace and sustain the upgraded standard of instruction. Strict screening procedures were also implemented both for the admission of pupils and for the hiring of faculty. =Present status= Colegio San Agustin-Bi√±an features modern and air-conditioned classrooms and facilities, including a multi- purpose gymnasium. The PAASCU, an accrediting entity that oversees strict compliance with educational standards, has awarded the school the Level III- accredited status. Patron saint St. Augustine of Hippo as pictured during the Renaissance The school is named in honor of St. Augustine of Hippo, a key figure in the doctrinal development of Western Christianity and a \\"Doctor of the Church\\" Two of his surviving works, namely, \\"The Confessions\\" (his autobiography) and \\"The City of God,\\" are regarded as Western classics. Augustine is often considered to be one of the theological fountainheads of the Reformation because of his teaching on salvation and grace. Martin Luther, perhaps the greatest figure of the Reformation, was himself an Augustinian friar. Other English speaking Augustinian Schools with the same patron include Colegio San Agustin-Makati, Colegio del Santo Ni√±o (Cebu), Colegio San Agustin-Bacolod, St. Augustine's College, Brookvale in Sydney, Australia, St. Augustine College Preparatory School, Richland, New Jersey; St. Augustine High School, San Diego, California; and Austin Preparatory School in Reading, Massachusetts - all three in the United States; and St. Augustine College in Malta.

Fraser was born in on the isle of Burra. He never released any recordings while he was alive, choosing to play his cover versions of American folk, country and western and rhythm and blues songs to close friends and family. He rarely even played live before paying audiences. During his lifetime he made a number of recordings on a reel to reel tape recorder, and family members circulated these as a keepsake of him after his death. After a few years, these tapes began to circulate to a wider audience (Shetland, whilst isolated, has numerous folk and blues festivals, and is well connected in terms of international musicians). In the late 1990s some of these tapes were eventually transferred to CD, originally, again, simply as a more permanent record of his songs, but the greatly increased number of CDs pressed meant that Fraser's audience again increased. Finally in 2002, Nel Records put out a small pressing of Long Gone Lonesome Blues a selection of some of the original tapes. To their great surprise this turned out to be a commercial success, and soon Fraser had fans in Japan, Europe, and, not least, the United States, who responded to Fraser as a \\"genuine\\" country and western singer, as opposed to what some see as the over-sophisticated sound of contemporary Nashville. Two more CDs followed (You & My Old Guitar (2003) and Treasure Untold (2005)), and a yearly Thomas Fraser memorial festival was begun in Shetland in 2002. Fraser's work is attracting increasing international attention, and there are plans for an American release of his best work. A fourth CD release of unreleased material That Far Away Land was released in November 2008. The following month, BBC Scotland aired a 30-minute documentary on the life of Thomas Fraser entitled Shetland Lone Star. A DVD featuring this programme and highlights of the annual Thomas Fraser Festival was released in October 2009. The National Theatre of Scotland also toured Scotland during October with a full theatrical production on the life of Thomas Fraser, entitled Long Gone Lonesome. The production was revived for a 2012 tour of the United States of America. A fifth CD of unreleased material is due out in November 2010.

Hater After leaving Monster Magnet, McBain moved to Washington State to create the garage-rock group Hater, along with Matt Cameron (Soundgarden, Pearl Jam), Ben Shepherd (Soundgarden) and Brian Wood (brother of Mother Love Bone vocalist Andrew Wood). The band released two albums of their brand of garage/psychedelic rock: their self-titled debut in 1993 and their follow-up, The 2nd, which was recorded in 1995 but released in 2005. In 1997, after Hater broke up, McBain participated in the first Desert Sessions, a musical project led by Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme. There he befriended ex-Kyuss/Fu Manchu drummer Brant Bjork. He was a live member of the Queens of the Stone Age for their first three shows, and co-wrote the song \\"Regular John\\" which appears on their self-titled debut album. Wellwater Conspiracy In 1997, McBain and Matt Cameron created the Wellwater Conspiracy along with Ben Shepherd. Their debut release was Declaration of Conformity, released in 1997 on the Third Gear label. Shortly after the release, Cameron was chosen to replace Jack Irons as drummer for rock group Pearl Jam. However, Cameron maintained both groups, contributing to a further three Wellwater Conspiracy albums. Notable appearances include keyboardist Glenn Slater of folk rock group The Walkabouts, Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam and Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age and Kyuss.

The Argentine cockade () is one of the national symbols of Argentina, instituted by decree on February 18, 1812 by the First Triumvirate, who determined that \\"the national cockade of the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata shall be of colours white and light blue [...]\\". The National Cockade Day is on May 18, the date on which it is assumed that the cockade was first used by the ladies of Buenos Aires during the events of the 1810 May Revolution. Origin The origin of the colours of the cockade and the reasons for their election cannot be accurately established. Among the several versions, one states that the colours white and light blue were first adopted during the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata in 1806 and 1807 by the Regiment of Patricians, the first urban militia regiment of the R√≠o de la Plata. Supposedly, a group of ladies from Buenos Aires first wore the cockade on May 19, 1810, in a visit to then-Colonel Cornelio Saavedra, head of the regiment. Between May 22 and 25 of the same year, it is known that the ', or patriots, identified adherents to the May Revolution by giving them ribbons with those colours. An anonymous manuscript quoted by historian Marfany expresses that on May 21, a Monday, revolutionaries presented themselves as such with white ribbons on their clothes and hats. In Juan Manuel Beruti's memoirs, ', it is commented on the use of white ribbons on clothes and cockades with olive branches on hats. It was also documented by Spanish functionary Faustino Ansay that when news of the revolution arrived to Mendoza, its supporters started to wear white stripes. A report attributed to Ram√≥n Manuel de Pazos says that on May 21, 1810, Domingo French and Antonio Beruti distributed said stripes as a sign of peace and unity between patriots and supporters of the Spanish government, but given the hostility of the latter, on May 25 they began spreading red stripes as a reference to the Jacobins. Both colours were later adopted by the members of the cabildo of Tarija as they joined the revolution. A version by Bartolom√© Mitre affirmed that French \\"entered in one of the shops of the ' and took several tracks of white and light blue stripes. [He] also placed pickets with orders of letting only patriots in and make them put on the distinctive [stripes]\\", although his statement might be biased due to the fact that blue was one of the colours of the party he was a member of, and which would be later known as the Unitarian Party. Mitre's words are perhaps what originated the erroneous belief that attributes the creation of the Argentine cockade to French and Beruti. In any case, it is known that in March 1811 the Patriotic Society created by people from Mariano Moreno's circle wore the white and light blue ribbons. Relation with the Argentine flag The Argentine cockade in 1810 (white and blue), 1811 (red), and 1812 (blue, white, and blue). In a note dated February 13, 1812, Manuel Belgrano solicited the triumvirate the use of the white and light blue national cockade, having to omit red since the Spanish troops and the royalists had been using it as a distinctive colour against the revolution. A legend says Belgrano was inspired by the sky and the clouds when choosing such colours, but he took them from the ribbons and cockades that were already being used. On February 18, 1812, the government decided to create the national cockade of the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata with light blue at its outer border and centre, and white between both. Belgrano then used the same colours to design the national flag, to which his men first took oath on February 27. That day the triumvirate ordered Belgrano to take charge of the Northern Army (') and as a result of his immediate departure, he did not become aware that the government had rejected the new flag.

This was the last Congress for Brezhnev, who died in 1982. Brezhnev proposed another round of arms control talks. At a time when an aging Soviet leadership faced a decline in economic growth, severe food problems at home, grave uncertainties about its future relationship with the United States, and unsettling events in Poland, the congress ended its week of speeches by unanimously confirming the existing leadership. The congress elected the 26th Central Committee. The 1st Plenary Session of the 26th Central Committee elected the 26th Politburo. The members of the 26th Politburo were all members of the 25th Politburo. The 14 voting members, whose average age was 69, and eight non-voting members (average age 65) were all reelected.

Among Communist-ruled nations, only the People's Republic of China and Albania did not send representatives. The congress itself produced few surprises, with the main emphasis placed on the stability of the political and economic situation and the prospects of continued success in the future. Brezhnev declared that the USSR would not invade or fight other countries, but also stated that he would support national liberation movements, despite d√©tente. Little mention was made of fundamental problems facing the Soviet Union‚Äî the slowdown of the rate of economic growth, the low output of agriculture despite heavy investment. The only critical voices raised were those of foreign Communists. French Communist leader Georges Marchais boycotted the congress after criticizing the Soviet Union's suppression of dissidents. A major problem that faced Soviet leaders, and one that was continually evaded, was the need to rejuvenate the Politburo, which was elected at the 1st Plenary Session of the 25th Central Committee. The membership of the 25th Politburo remained virtually unchanged from the 24th Politburo, as did the members' average age of 66. Brezhnev himself was 69. Two new members were elevated to the Politburo, Dmitriy Ustinov and Gregory Romanov, bringing its total number to 16.

A key member of the Bulldogs during the 'entertainers' era, one of his finest moments was kicking six conversions from six attempts in Canterbury's 1980 Grand Final victory. He was the top point scorer in the NSWRL in 1980 and 1984. On the 9th day of February 2020, he was inducted into the Bulldogs Club as a life member. Career Canterbury Bulldogs Gearin was spotted by Canterbury-Bankstown CEO Peter Moore when he was playing for Christian Brothers Lewisham in the Commonwealth Bank Cup Schoolboys rugby league competition in 1974. He joined Canterbury-Bankstown in 1975. He made his first grade d√©but for the Berries during the 1976 NSWRFL season in Canterbury's 23-20 win against the Newtown Jets at Belmore Sports Ground. At the end of his first year of first grade his stat ended up playing 6 games, scoring 2 tries for 6 points. In 1977 he scored 5 tries in a Pre- Season trial match against the Queanbeyan Blues. His 1977 season was interrupted by injury. He became a regular first grader in 1978. Steve played in Canterbury's Heartbreaking 22-15 loss in the 1978 NSWRFL season's Qualifying Final against the Parramatta Eels. In 1979 he broke George Taylforth's 1967 goal kicking record of 204 points in the process. He played in Canterbury's 17 - 13 1979 NSWRFL season's Grand Final loss to the St. George Dragons where he scored 1 try and booted 2 goals. He scored 7 points on Grand Final day.

Whittacker/Hudosn: The Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players. 1995 Later career Gearin returned to Canterbury in 1985. In the 1985 NSWRL season he scored 1 try against the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and scored 1 try and booted 3 goals against the Eastern Suburbs Roosters. Steve missed out in Canterbury's 7-6 1985 Grand Final win over former club St. George, but he was still in attendance at the Sydney Cricket Ground and was part of the lap of honor with the squad after winning the premiership on Grand Final day. At the end of the 1985 season he played 13 games, scoring 7 tries and booting 32 goals for 92 points. In 1986 he didn't play any First Grade for the Bulldogs and overall since returning to Belmore, he didnt see eye to eye with first grade coach Warren Ryan as he was a very defensive-minded tactician of a coach and defending was not one of Gearin's strengths. His last ever game for the Bulldogs was at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Reserve Grade in round 8 in their 26-16 win over the South Sydney Rabbitohs. After 9 Rounds of the 1986 NSWRL season Gearin lost patience as he was fed up playing in Reserve Grade and he realized that under Warren Ryan and competing for a starting spot on the wing with young, talented and hungry players like Steve O'Brien, Matthew Callinan and Sandy Campbell, he was not part of the club's future plans in first grade and as a result, the next week he requested a release from the club which was accepted by club CEO Peter Moore and Gearin decided to join the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles in search for any opportunity to revive his First Grade career and for geographical reasons as he lives and works in the Manly area. He only ended up playing a few first-grade games for Manly and played the rest of the 1986 season in Reserve Grade. His last ever game of his Career was at the Sydney Cricket Ground in the 1986 Reserve Grade Semi Final for Manly against the North Sydney Bears where Manly lost 36-20. At the end of the 1986 season he decided to Retire due to a mixture of falling out of love and interest with the game and wanting to focus on his School-teaching career and his family. He never played International Rugby League or State Of Origin. He only played for NSW City Seconds in 1981. To this day, Gearin is still a School teacher at St Luke's Grammar School on the Northern Beaches of Sydney.

It was Sidney Stringer School and Community College from 1972 until 1994, then Sidney Stringer Community Technology College until and Sidney Stringer School to 2010 when it became Sidney Stringer Academy. History Sidney Stringer first opened as a School and Community College in 1972 as the first urban community school in England. The school was formed from the merger of two secondary modern schools ‚Äì Frederick Bird on Swan Lane (subsequently became a primary school) and Broad Heath on Broad Street. It was one of the first Community Colleges in the 1970s and one of the first Technology Colleges in the 1990s. The school was named after Alderman Sidney Stringer, a former mayor of Coventry who dedicated himself to the rebuilding of the city after the devastation of the Second World War. The Community college is in the Swanswell area close to the city centre, a 5-minute walk from the central bus station. In 2006, controversial plans to merge Sidney Stringer School with Barr's Hill School to form a city academy were dropped. =Fire= On 25 September 2007, a fire destroyed 40% of the old 1972 school buildings. The school, however, was operating as normal, albeit in temporary classrooms, by February 2008. The school was rebuilt at a cost of ¬£28 million and reopened in 2012 with an official opening ceremony on 4 October 2012 conducted by the Duke of York. =Academy= Coventry City Council applied for Sidney Stringer to become an Academy, opening in existing buildings in September 2010 and new buildings the following year. The City Council is itself a major sponsor, together with the City (FE) College with Coventry University and Jaguar Cars. It formed part of the city's Swanswell Regeneration Initiative in Hillfields. The formal consultation exercise undertaken in February 2008 revealed the support for the school from the local community, with over 80% of respondents demanding that the name of the school remain the same. The specialisms of the new school would be Mathematics, and Design and Technology. Amongst changes made on Academy formation was the remodelling of the house system, five houses each with ten vertical tutor groups. There was uniform change from green sweatshirts to black blazers, the introduction of Head boy and girl along with a prefect system (year 10, 11 and 16+ students). The academy also has an academy council for years 7‚Äì11. Sidney Stringer Academy had a positive Ofsted on 2013 and has gone on to lead a multi-academy trust, a shared sixth form, a cooperative continual professional development (CPD) centre and Coventry SCITT, the centre that organises in school initial teacher training. Academics The curriculum is pupil-centred focusing on their needs. Different pathways ensure pupils can deepen their understanding and enjoyment of topics As well as traditional GCSEs and A-Levels, pathways can include functional skills qualifications and work- related learning in conjunction with local colleges and universities. The school uses immersion and cross-curricular integration of topics. At Key Stage three topics are carouselled in four-hour blocks, rather than the traditional one-hour blocks. At key stage four, students have six hours a week to immerse themselves in a subject and then sit the examination at the end of the year rather than doing a course on three hours a week over two or three years. In Key Stage 4, all students study GCSE English Language, English Literature, GCSE Maths, GCSE Science plus three option subjects over one or three years. In Year 11, there will be an opportunity to study one more option subject, in one year, or catch up. When choosing their option students must study at least one of these five subjects: French, Spanish, History, Geography or Computer Science. To achieve an EBacc pass, they must have level 4 passes in GCSE English (Language or Literature), GCSE Maths, GCSE Science (double or triple award Science or Computer Science), a humanity that is GCSE History or Geography. and GCSE French, Spanish or other GCSE Language. Students take the first one of these exams in year 9, and do an alternative option in year 10 and year 11. In 2020, students were using the online software Google Classroom, and the school is experimenting with Knowledge Organisers. Ofsted The 2013 Ofsted report gave Sidney Stringer Academy a Grade 1 \\"Outstanding\\" in all areas. The academy was praised for the quality of its teaching, describing it to be \\"consistently good or better and students relish the imaginatively planned, vibrant lessons provided.\\" The Ofsted report reads: \\"Behaviour is outstanding. Students from different backgrounds work very well together, have a very positive attitude to learning and feel safe. They are courteous and immensely proud of their academy noting that the academy allows them ‚Äòto be leaders of their learning.\\" Student support was also highlighted as a strength \\"The academy looks after the students exceptionally well, particularly those who find learning difficult. Support and challenge are highly personalised.\\" The report goes on to praise leadership stating that \\"Outstanding leadership exists at every level. The leadership team has driven forward every aspect of academy life with vision, shared values and remorseless energy. The Governing Body offers an effective challenge because of the clarity of the high-quality information provided by the leadership team.\\"30px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0. ¬© Crown copyright Pastoral =Vertical tutor groups= The house system of the school serves many purposes inside the school, mostly relating to organisation, competitions and rewards. Each house has a name inspired by a certain event, person and/or sponsors. Each of the 5 houses has ten tutor groups; they have 240 students with 48 students in each year. Pupils are assigned a house on admission. Each House is led by a Head of House and overseen by an Assistant Principal. Also, all Houses have House Assistants. Vertical tutor groups with students from each year are shown to enhance achievement, and makes the group more like a family, with the older and younger students giving each other support and advice. In addition to peer-mentoring, it allows students to form a friendship in other year groups and bullying is reduced. Each house has its charity week (some have a selected charity), has its colour, and their motto. ; Lanchester The inspiration of the house name is Frederick W. Lanchester and the house encourages the students to be passionate and driven in their studies as Lanchester. Their house colour is blue. Their mottos are \\"Discover the blue in you.\\" and \\"Driving to success.\\" ; Jaguar The house's name comes from the transport company Jaguar Cars, as does the motto, and logo, although the logo is a green silhouette of the actual Jaguar silver logo. The company is the only prominent luxury vehicle manufacturer in Coventry, and amongst few that exist in the UK. Jaguar sponsored Sidney Stringer Academy for their reconstruction after the 2007 fire. Their house colour is green. Their mottos are \\"Born to perform, unleash a Jaguar. Don't dream it. Drive it.\\" and \\"Driven by passion.\\" They have two chosen charities: MS Mercia Therapy Centre in Coventry, and Myton Hospice in Coventry. ; Swanswell The house's name has two major inspirations, the Swanswell Lake which is opposite the road from the school, and the Swanswell Initiative multi-million pound funds that were dedicated to improving a designated 160 acres of Coventry, which Sidney Stringer Academy was inside causing them to receive funds to improve the school on a vast scale. Their logo is symbolic of the swans in the Swanswell Lake. Their house colour is purple. Their motto is \\"Serenity, Strength, Aspiration, Pride.\\" They also have two chosen charities, Teenage Cancer Trust and Wychbold Swan Rescue. ; Da Vinci The inspiration for the house's name comes from Leonardo da Vinci. The students are encouraged to be creative like da Vinci himself. Their logo is a human, who seems either to be doing star jumps or making a snow angel. Their house colour is orange. Their motto is \\"Our future is bright, your future is bright!\\" Their chosen charity is Myton Hospice. ; Phoenix The name Phoenix was used by popular demands. This house's symbolism is to rise from the ashes, much like a phoenix in mythology, but mainly this means to tackle difficulty and to succeed, becoming better than before. Phoenix is a reference to the fire which occurred in 2007, causing great damage to the school, but which allowed renovations to occur to the school. Their house colour is red. Their mottos are \\"In charge of our destiny.\\" and \\"If we fall, we shall rise again.\\" Their chosen charity is Cancer Research UK. Charity work The school holds displays to raise awareness of World Refugee Day and in 2006 participated in the Motiv8 project. 16+ also holds an annual charity week in which they raise as much money as possible for an international charity and a charity more closer to home.

Zoroastrianism in Azerbaijan goes back to the first millennium BC.or earlier and was the predominant religion of Greater Iran before the conversion to Islam. The name Azerbaijan is Persian and means \\"protect(or) of Fire\\",Persian Lexicons:Dehkhoda, Moin, etc. which is said to have a direct link with Zoroastrianism. Today the religion, culture and traditions of Zoroastrianism remaim highly respected in Azerbaijan, and the new year Nowruz continues to be the main holiday in the country. Zoroastrianism has left a deep mark in the history of Azerbaijan. Traces of the religion are still visible in Surakhany, Khinalyg, and Yanar Dag.  History  One of the world's oldest religions, Zoroastrianism was also practiced in the territory of Azerbaijan in ancient times. Zoroastrianism, sharing its name with its founder Iranian prophet Zoroaster (also known as Zarathustra), was the first monotheistic belief in the world and the official religion in Persia from 600 BCE to 650 CE. Zoroastrians believe in one God, they call Ahura Mazda created the universe. The Avesta, the sacred book of Zoroastrianism, consists of two main sections: the oldest section contains the Gathas, including seventeen hymns, and the younger Avesta, containing commentaries to the older one. It also includes myths, stories and details of ritual observances. Fire is the most important symbol of purity in Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrians are wrongly believed to worship fire, but they believe fire represents the symbol of Ahura Mazda.https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/zoroastrian/worship/worship.shtml Regarding the date of birth of Zoroaster, historians mostly agree upon the dates of 660-583 BCE, with his birthplace being in the lands of Azerbaijan. According to the local legends, Zoroaster was born in Caucasian Albania. But this idea is also found in other regions under influence of Zoroastrianism. Around 550 BCE, Cyrus II integrated the area of southern Azerbaijan into the Achaemenid Empire. During his reign, Zoroastrianism was the dominant religion in the Empire, but he did not made any attempt to impose Zoroastrianism on the people of his subject territories. During the rule of Darius I, Zoroastrianism was the official religion of the Achaemenid Empire, including Azerbaijan. Darius I also allowed moderate religious freedom in the satrapies. Alexander the Great defeated Darius III in 331 BCE. During this period Zoroastrianism began to weaken. Many priests were killed and many sacred texts of Zoroastrianism were destroyed and lost forever. = Ancient states in the territory of Azerbaijan =  Atropatena  Around 328 BC, Satrap of Media and Atropates formed an independent entity Atropatena. The state was situated in Azarbaijan (historic Azerbaijan, i.e. Iranian Azerbaijan), and also included a minor part of the present-day Republic of Azerbaijan (i.e. Arran). As Zoroastrianism was the dominant religion in Atropatena, the capital of Atropatena, Ganzak, became a religious center. Zoroastrian temples were fueled by region's rich oil deposits. In accordance with many historian sources, the name ‚ÄúAzerbaijan‚Äù is attributed to the Persian word for fire ‚ÄúAzar‚Äù, because of the popularity of Zoroastrianism in the region.  Albania  In the IV century BC, in the north of present-day Azerbaijan Republic and partially southern Dagestan, the entity of Caucasian Albania was established. Under Achaemenid, Parthian and especially Sassanid influence, Zoroastrianism was the dominant religion in the country. Armenians historian Movses Kaghankatvatsi investigating the political line of Yazdegerd II (438-457) in Albania noted that ‚ÄúDuring the reign of sinner Yezdeghird, devil instigated him to destroy Christian religion‚Äù, so he ordered to reject Christianity in Albania and obey fire-worshippers-magicians (Zoroastrianism).\\" As a result of excavations on the territory of Caucasian Albania many cultural finds, indicating the spreading of Zoroastrianism in the region were found.  Zoroastrian architecture  Zoroastrianism's traces can be found in Baku, Shamakha, Nakhchivan, Mingechaur, Talysh-Mugan areas. The Absheron Peninsula and Baku were centers of Zoroastrianism in ancient times. The Absheron Peninsula was rich in natural undamped torches of natural gas on the shore and in the sea. In the Sassanid era (3rd-7th centuries), when Zoroastrianism had risen to the level of state religion, Baku entered a new stage in its urban development. The most popular architectural monument of the city the Maiden's Tower and ancient city walls and towers that are being preserved as historian monuments, belong to that time. = Ateshgah‚ÄìBaku = Ateshgah, one of the popular ancient monuments in Azerbaijan belonging to the seventeenth century CE is located in village of Surakhani, fifteen km west of the capital Baku on the coast of the Caspian Sea. In some sources this monument is called the fire worshippers' temple. The Ateshgah monument traces its origins to Zoroastrianism, which was dominant religion in ancient Azerbaijan. Ateshgah temple has been designated as world heritage site by UNESCO. The temple is not used since 1883 CE. Atashgah Fire Temple = Khinalig = The village of Khinalig (Khinalug, Khinalyg) located in the west of Guba district of Azerbaijan is also famous for its Zoroastrian temples. Burj sanctuary, reflecting Zoroastrian traces was built in the 7th century in the oldest part of Khinalig. There are many caves, pirs ('a holy place' or a 'shrine' in Azerbaijani) around the district.  Zoroastrianism after Islam arrived in Azerbaijan  In the 7th century the Arabs conquered Persia including Azerbaijan. During this period many Zoroastrian temples, libraries were destroyed and burned. Many Zoroastrian texts were lost. Zoroastrians were treated as dhimmis (People of the Book) as well as Jews and Christians by the Arabs. It means that they could retain their religious practices, but must pay extra taxes. Despite all the difficulties Iranians did convert, Zoroastrianism became a minority religion in Iran.  Novruz  The six Gahambar festivals and Novruz are the seven important Zoroastrian festivals. All Novruz traditions are rooted in Zoroastrianism. These festivals occur at the spring equinox. According to Mary Boyce \\"It seems a reasonable surmise that Novruz, the holiest of them all, with deep doctrinal significance, was founded by Zoroaster himself\\". The Persian historian Gardizi, in his work titled Zayn al- AkhbƒÅr, mentions Novruz among Zoroastrians festivals and points out that Zoroaster highly emphasized the celebration of Novruz. Usually preparation begins a month prior to Novruz holiday in Azerbaijan. People celebrate the last four Tuesdays prior to the festival being the day of one of the four elements ‚Äì water, fire, earth and wind. As a tribute to Zoroastrianism beliefs, every Tuesday during four weeks children jump over small bonfires.

Historian Archie Brown wrote that the program was \\"the last authoritative document produced by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to take entirely seriously the building of a communist society.\\" Nikita Khrushchev also proposed to revise CPSU's statutes and implement a \\"systematic renewal of cadres\\" that would limit terms of individuals in elected party posts and rules for turnover in other Party bodies, worrying that \\"a gradual freezing of personnel policy would block up the system, and stagnation would occur.\\" However, the proposal was opposed by other Party members. It is believed that Khrushchev's proposal contributed to his later oust from power.

He was Count in Keldachgau, Count in the Z√ºlpichgau (942), in the Bonngau (945), in Hubbelrath (950). Possibly he was also the Count of this name in the Hattuariergau (947) and in the neighbouring Tubalgau (Duffelgau) (948), and also count in the Belgian county of Huy, and Vogt of the Stavelot Abbey.

On 19 January 1995, the AS 332L Super Puma helicopter operating the route, registered G-TIGK and named Cullen, was struck by lightning. The flight was carrying 16 oil workers from Aberdeen to an oil platform at the Brae oilfield. All 18 people on board survived. Crew The commander of the flight was Cedric Roberts (44). He had been with Bristow Helicopters Ltd since 1974. He was a very experienced pilot with more than 9,600 hours of flying time under his belt. The first officer was Lionel Sole (39). Sole had been with Bristow Helicopters Ltd since 1990. He had more than 3,100 hours of flying time to his credit.Aircraft Accident Report Accident En route, the helicopter ran into poor weather and was then struck by lightning. This caused severe damage to the tail rotor. Though the helicopter managed to limp for a few more minutes, the tail rotor eventually failed completely and the pilot was forced to perform an emergency autorotation onto the rough seas. Emergency floaters on the helicopter allowed the passengers and crew to be evacuated onto a life raft. Despite the high waves and bad weather, all the people on board the flight were rescued by the ship Grampian Freedom. The lightning strike was an isolated one in the storm, and may have been induced by the helicopter flying through the cloud. The accident investigation also revealed potential troubles with the composite material with brass strip design of the rotors which made the rotorblades prone to explosion and damage from lightning strikes.

His league and championship career with the Kerry senior team spanned fourteen seasons from 1988 to 2001. Born in Cahersiveen, County Kerry, Fitzgerald was born into a strong Gaelic football family. His father, Ned Fitzgerald, was an All-Ireland medal winner with Kerry in 1955 before later captaining the side in 1957. Fitzgerald's brother-in-law Colm O'Neill is a two-time All-Ireland medal winner with Cork, while his nephew, Shane O'Neill is a soccer player with Orlando City SC. Fitzgerald played competitive Gaelic football during his schooling at Cahersiveen CBS and won several county championship medals in various grades. He later played with University College Cork, winning a Sigerson Cup medal in 1987. By this stage Fitzgerald had become a regular member of the St. Mary's club team, beginning a four-decade association with the team. He won numerous South Kerry championship titles before claiming a county intermediate championship medal in 2001. With divisional side South Kerry he won three successive county senior championship medals from 2004 to 2006. Fitzgerald made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he was added to the Kerry minor team. He enjoyed two championship seasons with the minor team, however, he was a Munster runner-up on both occasions. Fitzgerald subsequently joined the Kerry under-21 team, winning an All-Ireland medal in his final year on the team in 1990. By this stage he had also joined the Kerry senior team, making his debut during the 1987-88 league. Over the course of the next fourteen seasons, Fitzgerald won two All-Ireland medals in 1997 and 2000. He also won six Munster medals and one National Football League medal. He played his last game for Kerry in August 2001. After being chosen on the Munster inter-provincial team for the first time in 1988, Fitzgerald was an automatic choice on the starting fifteen on a number of occasions. He ended his career without a Railway Cup medal. During his career, Fitzgerald won three All Star awards, was named Footballer of the Year in 1997 and was selected on a list of the 125 greatest Gaelic footballers of all time in a 2009 poll. After scoring 12-205, Fitzgerald is the all-time third highest scorer for Kerry. He is also the all-time top scorer in the Munster Championship. In retirement from playing Fitzgerald became involved in team management and coaching. He is heavily involved as a coach with the Col√°iste na Sceilge senior team, while at club level he has served as manager of the St. Mary's team, guiding them to an All-Ireland title in 2016. Later that year Fitzgerald became a selector with the Kerry senior team. Biography Fitzgerald was born near Cahersiveen, County Kerry in 1969. He was born into a family that had a strong link to football in Kerry. His father Ned was a Kerry footballer of note back in the late 1950s while his uncle, S√©amus O‚ÄôConnor, is the holder of a record ten South Kerry Senior Football Championship medals. Fitzgerald was educated at the local national school and later attended Cahersiveen CBS. It was here that his football talents were further developed and he won numerous county medals. Fitzgerald later studied at University College, Cork, however, he also became a key member of the UCC football team. In 1988 he won a Sigerson Cup medal following an 0‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì5 defeat of University College, Galway in the inter-varsities series of games. As of 2009, Fitzgerald was working as a property auctioneer with Fitzgerald & O'Connor Ltd's Auctioneering firm, a family run business established in 1979. He is the uncle of Shane O'Neill. In 2018 Fitzgerald was appointed principal of Col√°iste na Sceilge in Caherciveen. Playing career =Club= Fitzgerald played club football with his local club called St. Mary's in Cahersiveen; however, it is with divisional side South Kerry that he had his greatest successes at club level. In 2004 South Kerry qualified for the final of the county football championship for the first time in twenty years. Laune Rangers provided the opposition; however, the divisional side never looked troubled at any stage of the match. At the full-time whistle victory went to South Kerry by 1‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì5 and Fitzgerald added a county winners' medal to his collection. The following year South Kerry continued their domination of club football and reached the final of the county championship for the second year in succession. On this occasion Killarney- based club Dr. Croke's provided the opposition. A close game developed; however, Fitzgerald's side were to the fore once again. A 0‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì6 victory resulted in a second consecutive club winners' medal for Fitzgerald. He also picked up the man-of-the-match award. In 2006, for the third year in succession, the South Kerry team reached the final of the club championship. Dr. Croke's provided the opposition for the second time in-a-row. In a low- scoring contest South Kerry retained their title giving Fitzgerald a third consecutive county winners‚Äô medal. The game was not without incident. Fitzgerald was involved in an accidental clash with his captain Paul O'Connor, and worried supporters saw him lay still for over eight minutes before being stretchered from the field. He was immediately transferred to Kerry General Hospital, and it was later reported that he had been concussed. In 2007 South Kerry set out on the four-in-a-row trail. All went to plan as Fitzgerald's side reached a fourth county championship final in succession. Feale Rangers provided the opposition. A low-scoring game followed; however, Fitzgerald's side narrowly lost out by 1‚Äì4 to 0‚Äì6. =Senior= By this stage Fitzgerald had joined the Kerry senior football team. He made his senior championship debut in a provincial game against Waterford in 1988. It was a difficult time for Kerry as the team was adjusting to the decline of the team of the 1970s and 1980s, a team regarded by many as the greatest of all-time. In Fitzgerald's debut season Kerry reached the provincial decider and faced reigning Munster title-holders Cork. The game proved to be a close affair, however, a goal for ‚Äòthe Rebels‚Äô proved the key in securing a 1-14 to 0-16 victory. Fitzgerald's performances in the provincial championship saw him pick up an All Star award. In 1989 Fitzgerald lined out in his second Munster final. Once again it was near neighbours Cork who provided the opposition. On this occasion ‚Äòthe Rebels‚Äô had a more emphatic victory as Fitzgerald's side lost out by 1‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì9. 1990 saw Kerry face Cork in the Munster final for the twenty-fifth successive year. It was Fitzgerald's third provincial decider in succession. However, ‚Äòthe Rebels‚Äô recorded a surprise 2‚Äì23 to 1‚Äì11 victory. It was ‚Äòthe Kingdom‚Äôs‚Äô biggest ever defeat by Cork. The following year Kerry regrouped and Fitzgerald lined out in a fourth successive Munster final. Limerick broke the provincial duopoly and provided the opposition in the county's first Munster final since 1965. Kerry's point-scoring ability was just enough to counteract Limerick's goal-scoring prowess. A 0‚Äì23 to 3‚Äì12 victory gave Fitzgerald his first Munster winners' medal in the senior grade. This proved to be the highlight of the year as Kerry were defeated by eventual champions Down in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final. In 1992 Kerry reached the Munster final for the thirty-fifth year in-a-row. The traditional provincial duopoly remained broken as minnows Clare provided the opposition. Kerry were the red-hot favourites. However Clare emerged victorious by 2‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì12. Kerry continued with their decline over the next few years when the team failed to even reach the provincial decider. In 1995 Fitzgerald lined out in his sixth Munster final; however, he had only been successful on one occasion. It was a ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô final as Cork provided the opposition. ‚ÄòThe Rebels‚Äô, however, had too much firepower for ‚Äòthe Kingdom‚Äô, and Fitzgerald's side lost out by 0‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì9. In 1996 Kerry regrouped under new manager P√°id√≠ √ì S√© and Fitzgerald lined out in his seventh provincial decider. Cork provided the opposition once again; however, on this occasion Kerry were a different team. A 0‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì11 victory gave Fitzgerald his second Munster winners‚Äô medal in the senior grade and kick-started the Kerry football revival. Kerry's next assignment was an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Mayo. In spite of claiming the provincial title, Kerry were still not the finished article. Fitzgerald's side were eventually defeated by 2‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì10. In spite of falling short again Fitzgerald was later presented with a second All Star award. 1997 saw Kerry throw down an early marker with regard to their All- Ireland ambitions. The team reached the final of the National Football League that year with Cork providing the opposition in P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh. A 3‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì8 victory gave Fitzgerald a winners' medal in the inter-county game's secondary competition. Later that summer Kerry reached the Munster final once again. Clare provided the opposition on this occasion; however, in spite of shocking the Kerry men five years earlier, there was no shock this time. A 1‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì11 victory saw Fitzgerald add a third Munster winners' medal to his collection. A subsequent defeat of Cavan saw Kerry qualify for their first All-Ireland final in eleven years. Mayo, the defeated finalists of the previous year, provided the opposition. Mayo went on a scoring spree during the match, capturing 1‚Äì2 inside two minutes. Fitzgerald was the star player for Kerry. He scored nine points throughout the game while Mayo froze and were held scoreless for the last twenty minutes. A 0‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì7 score line gave Kerry the title and gave Fitzgerald an All-Ireland winners‚Äô medal. His performances throughout the championship and in the so-called ‚ÄòMaurice Fitzgerald final‚Äô earned him a third All Star award. Kerry continued their march again in 1998 with a Munster final showdown with Tipperary. For the third year in succession ‚Äòthe Kingdom‚Äô proved the provincial masters, and a 0‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì10 win gave Fitzgerald a fourth Munster title. Kerry were the favourites to retain their All-Ireland title; however, a narrow 0‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì9 defeat by Kildare in the All-Ireland semi-final brought an end to their All-Ireland quest. In 1999 Kerry were attempting to secure a fourth provincial title in succession. Cork put an end to this dream with a 2‚Äì10 to 2‚Äì4 win over their great rivals in the Munster final. With that Kerry were dumped out of the championship. After a low point the previous year, Kerry were back in the provincial decider again in 2000. By this stage Fitzgerald was relegated to the substitutes' bench and was used more as an impact sub. That year he lined out in yet another Munster final, his third with Clare as opposition. Kerry walloped ‚Äòthe Banner men‚Äô by 3‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì8. It was Fitzgerald's fifth Munster medal. Kerry had firmly established their All- Ireland contender credentials, however, the All-Ireland series proved difficult. Fitzgerald's side drew with Armagh in the semi-final, while the replay proved just as tense. Both sides finished level after seventy minutes once again and it took a period of extra-time to find a winner. Kerry won narrowly 2‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì15 and booked a place in the Millennium All-Ireland final against Galway, who were playing their second final in three years. In a game to forget both sides missed easy chances and seemed apprehensive about taking a lead. Galway trailed by seven points at one stage, but clawed their way back to secure a 0‚Äì14 apiece draw. The replay was a much more conclusive affair. Galway worked the ball the length of the field to Declan Meehan who scored a goal to give the westerners a boost. A disputed free with seventeen minutes left in the game gave Kerry a lead which they would not relinquish. At the full-time whistle Kerry were the champions by 0‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì10. It was Fitzgerald's second All-Ireland winners' medal. After some early season rumblings of disquiet between Fitzgerald and the Kerry management, Kerry swept through the provincial series with ease again in 2001. A 0‚Äì19 to 1‚Äì13 defeat of Cork gave Fitzgerald a sixth Munster winners‚Äô medal and gave Kerry a boost in their All-Ireland ambitions. In a new innovation called the All-Ireland qualifiers series, Kerry's provincial victory allowed them to advance to the All-Ireland quarter-final against Dublin. Kerry were cruising but had lost their concentration and had allowed ‚Äòthe Dubs‚Äô to lead in the last minute. A poor kick-out resulted in a line-ball being awarded to Kerry on the 45-metre line. With Dublin manager Tommy Carr shouting in his ear and the deafening roar of the crowd, Fitzgerald, with his first touch of the ball -- he had only been introduced a few minutes earlier --, kicked the ball with the outside of his boot on his bad side over the bar to level the match and force a replay. This point was listed as one of RT√â's Top 20 GAA Moments in a 2005 poll. Kerry won the replay at Semple Stadium giving Fitzgerald's side the right to advance to an All-Ireland semi-final showdown with Meath. In one of the lowest points ever for Kerry football, ‚Äòthe Kingdom‚Äô were demolished by ‚Äòthe Royals‚Äô on a score line of 2‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì5. This defeat proved too much for some and Fitzgerald, tired of being confined to the bench, retired from inter-county football. In spite of this he was asked to return to the Kerry panel in 2004 at the age of 35. However, he declined Jack O'Connor's invitation. =Inter- provincial= Fitzgerald also lined out with his province in the inter- provincial series of games; however, he enjoyed little success. In 1989 he was listed among the substitutes when Munster faced Ulster in the final of the competition. That game was played at P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh and a close encounter developed. Fitzgerald entered the game as a substitute; however, Munster were defeated by 1‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì8. A lack of success for Kerry meant that it was 1994 before Fitzgerald played in his second Railway Cup final. Ulster provided the opposition once again, however, victory went to the northerners by 1‚Äì6 to 1‚Äì4.

Biography George Potter was born in Kenilworth. He was educated for a short time at a local dame school, but left to work at a young age to supplement his father's income of three shillings a day. He worked as a farm labourer until he was sixteen, when he moved to Coventry where he became an apprentice joiner and cabinet-maker. In 1854 he moved to London to work as a carpenter. In London, he joined a small trade union, the Progressive Society of Carpenters and Joiners, to which he was elected secretary in 1854, and chairman in 1858. He believed that progress could be made if all trade unions representing the building trades were united in one society, so in 1859 organised the Building Trades Conference. At the conference, the unions agreed to demand a maximum working day of nine hours from their employers. The employers refused, resulting in strike action and a lockout. Eventually the unions conceded, but due to his actions Potter became a prominent figure in the New Model Unions movement. He was regarded as a more intellectual, 'respectable' trade unionist, due in part to his smart appearance and restrained public speaking style. He was made an executive member of the London Trades Council (LTC). Potter established a weekly trade unionist journal, the Bee-Hive in 1861 edited by the journalist George Troup. It was adopted as the official journal of the LTC, but by 1862 only had a circulation of 2700, while Potter had debts of ¬£827. Some members of the LTC complained that the Bee-Hive gave its support too unreservedly to strike action, with Robert Applegarth accusing Potter of being a \\"manufacturer of strikes\\". Potter defended the policy by arguing that each strike had been judged as necessary by a trade union, and therefore deserved the full support of the LTC. Applegarth lead an investigation into the Bee-Hive's reporting in 1865, and accused Potter of personal dishonesty and maladministration regarding the journal's coverage of an industrial dispute in North Staffordshire. As a result, the Bee-Hive ceased to be the LTC's official journal and Potter lost his seat on the executive board. John Bedford Leno noted that in 1867 Robert Hartwell was the real editor of the Bee-Hive, and that Potter had assumed the credit for it. Potter went on to establish the London Working Men's Association (LWMA), with the Bee-Hive as its official journal. The journal continued to advocate rights for trade unions and supported the more radical members of the Liberal Party. Potter took up editing of the Bee-Hive, but it sold poorly and he was only saved from bankruptcy when Samuel Morley (a Liberal MP) and Daniel Platt bought up shares in the newspaper in June 1868. In March 1871 Potter was elected first President of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), and made chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Trade Unions. He also joined (along with Applegarth and Howell) the Working Men's Committee for Promoting the Separation of Church and State. In 1873 Potter was elected to the London School Board. He represented Westminster on the school board until 1882, being re-elected on two occasions. At the 1882 school board election he was unseated, coming last of seven candidates. In 1878 the Bee-Hive was declared bankrupt, with debts of over ¬£2000. Potter attempted to continue his business by publishing political pamphlets and biographies but this too ended in failure. He twice contested parliamentary elections for the Liberal Party, but failed to win a seat. He was a candidate at Peterborough in 1874 and at Preston in 1886. On 8 April 1893 Potter took part in a demonstration in Trafalgar Square against the Direct Veto Bill, a piece of proposed legislation controlling the opening hours of public houses. The demonstration descended into violence with police clearing the square. Potter became ill at the event, and never returned to work. He died at his home at Marney Road, Clapham Common from \\"paralysis of the brain\\" on 3 June 1893.

Designed in 1914, the building was completed in 1916 and fully furnished by 1917. Its architecture and fittings are representative of the Celtic revival movement which evoked the aesthetic style found in Ireland and Britain between the 7th and 12th centuries. Its construction was initiated and supervised by a Dublin solicitor, John O'Connell, a leading member of the Celtic revival and Arts and Crafts movements. He was funded by Isabella Honan (18611913), the last member of a wealthy Cork family, who provided large donations towards the build of the chapel. O'Connell oversaw both the architectural design and the commissioning of its exterior carvings and interior statuettes, floor, furniture and liturgical collection. He closely guided the architect James F. McMullen and the builders John Sisk and Sons, and hired the craftsmen and artists involved in its artwork, many of whom incorporated elements of the Art Nouveau style. In 1986, the sculptor Imogen Stuart was commissioned to oversee the building and installation of a new altar and other carvings, furnishings and fittings. The Honan Chapel is internationally known for its interior which is designed and fitted in a traditionally Irish style, but with an appreciation of contemporary trends in international art. Its furnishings include the mosaic flooring, altar plates, metal work and enamels, liturgical textiles and sanctuary furnishings, and nineteen stained glass windows; fifteen show Irish saints, the remainder show Jesus, Mary, St. Joseph and St. John. Eleven were designed and installed by Harry Clarke. The other eight were designed by A. E. Child, Catherine O'Brien and Ethel Rhind of An T√∫r Gloine (\\"The Glass Tower\\") cooperative studio. Background and construction The Honan Hostel. Both it and the chapel were built adjacent to Donovans road, outside UCC's grounds at the time, but have been within the university's bounds since its expansion in the mid 20th century. Population growth and migration in the early 20th century led to the development of a number of suburbs around Cork, which necessitated the building of churches to serve these new areas; the Honan Chapel was the first church to be built in Cork in the new century. Its genesis was rooted in a longstanding educational disagreement between the Protestant and Catholic hierarchies. Queens College Cork (today known as University College Cork, or UCC) was incorporated in 1845 as part of a nationwide series of new universities known as the Queen's Colleges, under a charter that excluded Catholic students. In 1911, the Queen's Colleges ceased as legal entities and Catholics were thereafter eligible to attend. A few years previously, the Irish Universities Act of 1908 forbade government funding for any \\"church, chapel, or other place of religious worship or observance\\"; thus any centre for Catholic students would have to be built with private funding. Isabella Honan (born Isabella Cunningham in 1861) was the sister-in-law of Robert Honan, the last male heir of a wealthy Catholic family of butter merchants. Robert and his brother Matthew had both died by 1909, and Robert had left his estate to Isabella. When she died in 1913, she left ¬£40,000 to the city of Cork, including ¬£10,000 which her executor, a Dublin solicitor John O'Connell, was instructed to use to establish a centre of worship for Catholic students in UCC, along with other charitable and educational purposes. These monies became known as the Honan Fund. O'Connell used part of the funds to provide scholarships for Catholic students at UCC and acquired the site of St. Anthony's Hall (also known as Berkley Hall) from the Franciscan order to develop an accommodation block for male Catholic students known as the Honan Hostel. O'Connell was assisted in the chapel project by the University president, Sir Bertram Windle. The art historian Virginia Teehan describes O'Connell and Windle as not only devout Catholics, but especially single-minded, creative and energetic. The Honan Chapel was one of the first modern Irish churches conceived with a thematic design not directed by the clergy. O'Connell, who in 1929, after the death of his wife, became a priest, was an active member of the Celtic revival movement, a member of both the Irish Arts and Crafts Committees and the Royal Irish Academy, a fellow of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, and chairman of the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland in 1917. He was deeply interested in ecclesiastical archaeology and was acquainted with several members of the Irish Arts and Crafts and Celtic revival movements. O'Connell thus sought to construct a chapel that was \\"something more than merely sufficient... a church designed and fashioned on the same lines and on the same plan as those which their forefathers had built for their priests and missioners all over Ireland nearly a thousand years ago.\\" He disliked the contemporary, international approach to church buildingwhich he described as \\"machine made\\"preferring a localised and uniquely Irish approach to style and form, which he sought from the most skilled local craftsmen available. He wanted work on the chapel to be \\"carried out in Cork, by Cork labour and with materials obtained from the City or County of Cork\\". O'Connell employed the firm of Cork architects James Finbarre McMullen and Associates which had overseen the construction of the Eye, Ear & Throat Hospital. The building's plans were drawn up in 1914. The contractor John Sisk, also from Cork, was the principal builder and completed the work at a cost of ¬£8,000. The foundation stone, laid on 18 May 1915 by Thomas A. O'Callaghan D.D., Bishop of Cork, records that the chapel was built \\"by the charity of Isabella Honan for the scholars and students of Munster\\". It was consecrated on 5 November 1916 and dedicated to Saint Finbarr, patron saint of Cork city and of the Diocese of Cork; on grounds believed to be close to an early Christian monastic site founded by the saint. Architecture The nave, looking west from the chancel towards the main entrance, with pipe organ in view O'Connell was mainly inspired by medieval architecture, and the Honan Chapel's architectural style is Celtic-Romanesque. Compared to the decorative and sculpted elements of the interior, its architecture, austere and modest, has been described by architectural historian and conservationist Frank Keohane as \\"a little too commonplace and formulaic\\". The site is located on a hillside overlooking the valley of the River Lee, on a site once thought to contain one of Finbarr's original churches. The building is listed as a protected structure under Section 51 of the Irish Planning and Development Act. The western entrance is approached through double-hinged wrought iron gates. Its fa√ßade was influenced by the 12th-century St. Cronan's Church, Roscrea and features an arcade and gabled wall. The side walls project slightly beyond the gables to form antaes, described by Keohane as \\"surmounted by improbable pinnacles...and probably better regarded as clasping buttresses\\". The chapel's interior is given a simple layout, consisting of a main entrance, a six-bay nave, two-bay square chancel and a nunnery. It does not contain either lateral aisles or transepts. The oblong nave is relatively simple and measures 72 by 28 feet (22 by 8.5 m). It is contained within a timber barrel vaulted ceiling that ends at the chancel which is 26 by 18 feet (7.9 by 5.5 m). The nave lacks shrines where worshippers normally light candles or place flowers near devotional images; in this sense, it is similar to a Protestant church. The plain, round bell tower is based on the 12th- century Irish round tower on Teampull Finghin (Fineen's church) in Clonmacnoise, County Offaly. Moulding at the chapel's entrance The western doorway's moldings were carved from lozenge and pellets. The doorway at one point had an iron grille which has since been removed. It is capped by three limestone ribbed vaults, supported by capitals carrying reliefs of the heads of six Munster saints: Finnbarr of Cork, Coleman of Cloyne; St. Gobnait of Ballyvourney; Brendan of Kerry, Decl√°n of Ardmore and √çte of Killeedy. The reliefs were sculpted by Henry Emery, assisted by students at the nearby Cork School of Art. The tympanum over the door was designed by the sculptor Oliver Sheppard and is dominated by the figure of St. Finbarr, dressed in bishop's vestments. The timber doors hang on wrought-iron strap-work hinges designed by the architect William Scott in (according to the writer Paul Larmour) a \\"Celticized art nouveau\\" style. The sacristy is on the north side (left, looking towards the altar) under the bell tower. Altar Wooden carvings by Imogen Stuart, c.1986 The chapel has had two altars. The original altar table was built from a slab of local limestone, chosen as a reaction against the ornately carved Italian marble then in fashion with church builders. It contained silver ornaments fitted by the Dublin gold and silversmith Edmond Johnson and William Egan and Sons of St Patrick's Street, Cork. It was positioned on a five-legged table, each leg of which was embedded with an Irish crucifix formed from simple geometric designs, including zig-zag patterns in lozenge and saltire, continuous dots and chevrons. The chapel's original design contravened the requirements of the Second Vatican Council in several ways: it was based on medieval churches and the old rites; it was built with a large spatial divide between the nave and chancel; and the altar was positioned at the very back of the chancel with the priest facing away from the congregation. In 1986, in response to the changed liturgical requirements, the chapel authorities commissioned the architect Richard Hurley to redesign elements of its fixtures. He in turn employed the German-Irish sculptor Imogen Stuart, aided by John and Teresa Murphy, to undertake a redevelopment, including replacement of the altar, pulpit, ceremonial chairs and baptismal font. Stuart works with other materials but favours wooden carvings, as exemplified by those at the front of the Honan altar. Her replacement altar, constructed in oak, depicts two of the Evangelists. Being movable, it allowed clergy and attendants to be closer to the congregation. Although the altar was first intended for the centre of the chancel at the focal point of the mosaic floor, this arrangement proved to be too far back and was impractical during ceremonies. Tabernacle enamel panel of the tabernacle The tabernacle is positioned at the far end of the chancel and is the chapel's focal point. It is formed from carved stone and shaped in a manner reminiscent of the arched roofs and entrances of medieval Irish churches. Its upper, triangular panel is set in the gable of the \\"entrance\\" and shows the Trinity of God the Father, Jesus crucified, the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove; around them, two angels carry the sun, moon and other symbols of creation. The lower, rectangular panel represents the doorway and is set against a background of branches and leaves attached in silver-gilt; it shows the Adoration of the Lamb, with the lamb standing on a brightly coloured altar decorated with three-ringed crosses and two angels acting as servers kneeling before it. The dove is surrounded by what Teehan describes as \\"the deep blue void of Heaven\\". Here, he is accompanied by flights of angels, carrying instruments of the Passion. The enamel embellishments are by the Irish craftsman and stained glass specialist Oswald Reeves and have been described as the best of his work. Mosaic floor The mosaic flooring was designed and installed by the UK-based mosaic artist Ludwig Oppenheimer. It contains symbols of the zodiac; images based on the mythological \\"River of Life\\"; and depictions of flora, fauna and river scenes. These designs celebrate the Genesis creation narrative and illustrate passages from the Old Testament including the \\"Benedicite\\" (also known as \\"A Song of Creation\\") from the Book of Daniel, which was sung during the office of lauds on Sundays and feast days. The pattern at the entrance contains a verse from Psalm 148 (\\"Praise to the Lord from Creation\\"). Sea creature The floor consists of four sections. The main entrance on the west side is dominated by a sunburst and stars surrounded by signs of the zodiac, while the imagery on the aisle depicts the head of a beast, his jaws open to form a river in which fish swim toward the chancel. The east side of the nave shows a large coiled sea creature which is part serpent, part dragon and part whale. There are stags, deer, sheep and other animals, drinking from a river in a forest, while exotic birds fly around them. The section inside the chancel shows a globe and symbols of creation, including animals, plants and planets. The four sections are unified by interlaced Celtic and zoomorphic border designs. The representations of the sun and night stars at the entrance signify both the new day and the resurrection, as Jesus is traditionally believed to have risen at dawn. Reflecting 12th-century Christian art, the presence of signs of the zodiac symbolises God's dominion over time. The beast's head in the aisle contains a series of tripartite motifs representing the Trinity: spirals, trefoil knots and interlace containing three saltire crosses. The sea creature at the east end of the nave is mentioned in the verse on the floor by the entrance dracones et omnes abyssi (\\"Dragons and all the depths\\"); alongside are the words cete et omnia quae moventur in aquis (\\"whales and all that move in the water\\"), which in medieval exegesis conjured images of death and reference the Biblical story of Jonah. The colouring on the floor by and inside the chancel is more subdued and the imagery more restrained. The imagery depicts a paradise which can be interpreted both as the garden of Eden and the eternal paradise promised at the end of time. The imagery includes the seasons, the classical elements and symbols of the Resurrection. A similar representation on a 5th-century sarcophagus in the Lateran Museum shows Jonah swimming towards the open jaws of a whale with horned ears and a long, coiled tail. In both examples the imagery emphasises how Jesus overcame death. This connection is further made by the inclusion of trees in reference to the tree of life, which in mythology grows in paradise and represents Christ, and the surrounding animals at rest, presented as symbols of Christ‚Äôs followers. Stained glass windows Sarah Purser O'Connell planned that Sarah Purser's studio, An T√∫r Gloine, at that time the leading proponent in the production of stained glass in Ireland, would produce all of the windows for the chapel. However, he also commissioned designs by the emerging stained glass artist Harry Clarke, and eventually set him and Purser's studio in competition against each other. When O'Connell viewed Clarke's cartoon for the Brigid window, he commissioned him to produce five for the chapel. Later, having viewed the design for St. Gobnait, he requested a further six from him. Although Purser was upset with the younger artist being awarded the majority of windows, An T√∫r Gloine ended up producing the original eight planned for them. Both studios were asked to depict Gaelic saints from the early-medieval, so called \\"golden age\\", of Christianity in Ireland. The nineteen stained glass windows in the chapel are: Our Lord (or \\"Christ in Majesty\\") (Child), Our Lady of Sorrows (Clarke), St. John (O'Brien) and St. Joseph (Clarke). To the right of the chancel looking down are: St. Finnbar (Clarke), St. Albert (Clarke), St. Declan (Clarke), St. Ailbe (Child), St. Fauchtna (Child) and St. Munchin (O'Brien). To the left are: St. Ita (Clarke), St. Coleman (Child), St. Brendan (Clarke), St. Gobnait (Clarke), St. Flannan (O'Brien) and St. Carthage (Rhind). The windows in the west gable are all by Clarke and represent St. Patrick, St. Brigid and St. Columcille. Six are on each side of the nave; four are within the chancel and three are above the west gable. Eleven were designed by Harry Clarke, and eight by An T√∫r Gloine. Of the latter, four are by A. E. Child, three by Catherine O'Brien, and one by Ethel Rhind. Four windows depict female saints, each in a deep royal blue colour scheme. Although the windows from each studio contain comparable imagery, their styles differ greatly. Clarke's are highly detailed while An T√∫r Gloine's are deliberately simple. Each studio displayed their cartoons in Dublin before they were transferred to glass and installed in Cork; both shows were highly praised, and critics debated which group was superior. Following the Honan's opening, the collector Thomas Bodkin wrote that \\"nothing like Mr Clarke's windows had been seen before in Ireland\\" and praised their \\"sustained magnificence of colour... intricate drawing [and] lavish and mysterious symbolism.\\" =Harry Clarke= Harry Clarke Clarke was 21 years old and working in his father's studio when commissioned by O'Connell. The Honan windows became his first works for a public space and went on to established his reputation as a significant international artist. A contemporary reviewer, comparing the windows to French medieval glass, including those in the Gothic royal chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, described them as \\"remarkable\\" and a \\"distinct advance on anything which has been heretofore done in Ireland in stained glass. Clarke's windows are all single light, each consisting of nine separate panels. They contain simplified, often whimsical forms which are nevertheless highly stylised. The windows contain Celtic designs and motifs, as well as figures and incidents from the life of each saint. The most obvious Celtic embellishments are Mary's red hair and green halo, and Brendan's pampooties. The writer M. J. O'Kelly suggests they evoke \\"the spirit of the ancient Celt\\". His designs blend Catholic iconography with motifs from Celtic mythology in a style that draws heavily from Art Nouveau, in particular the darker, fin de si√®cle works of Gustav Klimt, Aubrey Beardsley and Egon Schiele. In particular, his blending of bold and dark colours has been praised, especially for the effects they achieve in morning light. The designer Percy Oswald Reeves highlighted Clarkes' windows for their \\"beauty of... colour, quality and treatment of each piece of glass.\\" His individualised depictions of saints and merging of Catholic and early medieval imagery in a modern and individualised style was at odds with prevailing trends in Irish church art, which were still favoring soft, Raphael like imagery. According to scholar Luke Gibbons, Clarke's break \\"from episcopal interference... enabled [him] to exploit vernacular traditions of local saints... that belonged more to legend and folklore... and whose popular appeal lay outside the highly centralised power of post-famine ultramontane Catholicism.\\" Patrick, Brigid and Columcille Judas Iscariot, lower register of the St. Brendan window Designed in 1915 and the first of Clarke's designs to be completed, the Trias Thaumaturga windows of Ireland's three patron saints, Brigid, Patrick and Columcille, are positioned on the west wall above the main entrance door. The Patrick window was the first of Clarke‚Äôs windows. He worked on it for two months beginning on 18 March 1915, the day after his 21st birthday. The window, at 11.6 x 2.10 inches the largest in the chapel, is positioned on a base of five lilies, and the deep blue and green hues in the window were achieved using sheets of \\"antique\\" pot metal glass which were specially ordered from Chance's in Birmingham. Patrick wears a bishop's mitre and holds a crozier in one hand and a shamrock in the other. The upper panel shows the saint's birth, the lower panel his death. The borders are decorated with what O'Connell described as \\"symbols of his learning, his justice, his kingly dignity, of truth, of spiritual fire, of light overcoming darkness, of the serpent typical of the reptiles which he banished from Ireland.\\" Brigid, known as \\"The Mary of Ireland\\", is shown dressed in a blue cloak and robe and wears a white headdress decorated with spirals. A large angel wearing a multi-coloured robe is positioned above her, while another four hover at her feet. She holds a representation of Kildare Cathedral, which she is said to have founded. The lamb alongside her represents faith, while the calf signifies innocence. The window was well received by critics when first shown in Clarke's studio in Dublin and led to the original commission for five windows. Columcille, whose name translates as \\"Church Dove\\" (Colm Cille), lived in the 6th century and is said to have founded Iona Abbey. Clarke shows him as accompanied by the dove O'Connell describes as his \\"daily adviser and companion\\", and the white horse said to have \\"comforted him in his last days\\". He is dressed in red, green and blue vestments, and holds a sliver and gold mitre. Brendan, Declan and Gobnait St. Declan facing St. Patrick, lower panel The Brendan, Declan and Gobnait windows were completed as a group in the late summer and autumn of 1916. Following the Easter Rising that year, Clarke and his wife, Margaret Quincey, left Dublin to move into a cottage in Mount Merrion, Blackrock. Clarke was under considerable pressure to complete and install the three windows in time for the chapel's 5 November consecration. St. Brendan's window illustrates episodes from the \\"Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot\\", first recorded c.900AD. Brendan wears a robe of blue, purple, greens and gold hues, and fishnet gloves. In his left hand he holds a paddle as a references to his reputation as a seaman and voyager. In the lower panel a grotesque, claw- limbed Judas Iscariot appears as a \\"devilish figure surrounded by red and yellow flames\\", his lower body transformed into that of a goat. According to legend, Brendan found Judas abandoned on a rock in the ocean, condemned to be tormented for eternity by demons. In another traditional recounting, he arrives at an island referred to as the \\"Paradise of Birds\\", where birds sing psalms \\"as if with one voice\\" in praise of God; Clarke depicts this in the depictions of birds on the window's borders. As with several of Clarke‚Äôs windows at Honan, Brendan's panels reflect the artist's taste for the macabre, especially in what Costigan describes as \\"the woefully metamorphosed fallen angels from the Paradise of Birds island\\" and \\"Brendan's sore-tired contemporaries\\" lining the window's borders. Gobnait window, 1916 Declan of Ardmore lived in the 5th century and is the patron saint of the Decii clan of County Waterford. In the main image, Declan wears a hooded cloak in red and gold, holds a long cross and is surrounded by a patchwork of red, purple, gold and black glass shards. The upper panels concerns Declan‚Äôs return to Ireland from Wales and shows the saint carrying a bell, one of his attributes. According to legend, the bell, sent to Declan as a gift from heaven, was inadvertently left behind on a rock, but in response to Declan‚Äôs prayers, it miraculously reappeared in Ardmore. In the lower panel Declan, his assistant Ruamus, and followers are shown meeting St. Patrick on their return from Rome where Declan had studied and been consecrated bishop. Declan wears a red and gold cloak, and opposite him, Patrick is dressed in green, purple and fawn. On either side of them are Ruamus, holding the bell, and an unidentified attendant, holding a candle. The Saint Gobnait window has been described as the \\"most remarkable\\" of the Honan windows and a high point of Clarke's career. While number of the early Honan windows were completed by assistants working from his designs, Clarke solely designed the cartoon, transferred it to glass, and oversaw its installation in Cork. It is located on the north side of the chapel, and depicts scenes from the life of Gobnait, a healer who established a convent in Ballyvourney and became the patron saint of bees. In the main panel, Gobnait is shown in half-profile with a pale, thin and ascetic face and individualistic, unmistakably Irish features. She wears royal blue and purple robes adorned with lozenged jewels, a veil and a silver cloak. Her clothing draws on L√©on Bakst's costume for Ida Rubinstein's 1911 performance of \\"Le Martyre de saint S√©bastien\\". Her right arm is outstretched in a pose influenced by Beardsley's facial and figurative types, Alesso Baldovinetti's c.1465 Portrait of a Lady in Yellow, and portraits by Donatello. In the upper panel, the victims of a plague flee to her for sanctuary and protection. The image shows her drawing the sign of the cross on the road and marking a line around her church with her crosier. According to O'Connell, the line represents the point beyond which \\"the infection did not come, so that none of those who lived and served with her suffered from the plague.\\" Detail of Clarke's original modello, 1914. Pencil, pen, inks and watercolor on board. Corning Museum of Glass, New York. Clarke and his assistant Kathleen Quigly completed the window's modello under considerable time pressure over five weeks in 1914, during the offer period for the commission. A monochrome study was made in pencil, pen, inks, and watercolour on board, before the cartoon, now at the Corning Museum of Glass, was completed and eventually transferred to glass. During this process, each panel was cut up, waxed and painted. This was an expensive process for the largely unknown artist, and was funded both by both his father and his friend Augtin Malloy. The window is described by Teehan as \\"kaleidoscopically sumptuous\\" and \\"filled with a wealth of art historical allusions, often unexpected\\". According to the Irish novelist E. ≈í. Somerville, it evokes late 19th century decadence in its resemblance to an Beardsleytype female face, which \\"though horrible [is] so modern and conventionally unconventional... [Clarke's] windows have a kind of hellish splendour.\\" Finnbarr and Ita St. Finbarr, central panel The chapel is dedicated to Finbarr, patron saint of Cork. His window was completed in 1916 alongside Ita's, and is located on the north wall of the nave. Its colour scheme is dominated by a series of red hues. The upper panel depicts his parents who, by legend, were sentenced to death by burning after his mother refused to marry the chieftain Tyagerlach of Rathluin. The panel shows them rescued by the divine hurricane said to have put out the fire about to engulf them. Finbarr, like his mother in the upper panel, has blond hair. He wears a chasuble coloured in a variety of red and rosepink colours. He holds an ornately decorated crosier in his left hand, and on his right hand is the glove he is said to have worn continuously since the day he is said to have met with Christ, who, according to O'Connell \\"raised the kneeling saint by his right hand, after which it ever glowed with a celestial radiance which could not be obscured, and which was only to be borne if the hand were kept covered with a glove.\\" In the lower register, Finbarr prays along side bishop Maccuirp, under whom he studied in Macroom. The little known ascetic St. Ita was born as either Deirdre or Dorothy in the sixth-century to a local chieftain, probably in Decies-within-Drum in County Waterford, and is said to have been a descendant of Fedlimid Rechtmar and Conn of the Hundred Battles. She is sometimes referred to as Ita the Wise, and having changed her name to Ita due to her \\"extraordinary thirst for divine love\\", later becoming the patron saint of Killeedy in County Limerick. Ita is sometimes known as the \\"The Brigid of Munster\\"; her window is dominated by shades of blue, a colour usually associated with Brigid. St. Ita, lower register She wears royal blue clothes and her facial features are based on representations of Theodora, who died in 548. The white glass surrounding her head is intended to represent a halo. The upper register shows Mary enthroned as Queen of Heaven. She is dressed in red, gold and blue robes, and shards of white glass, interwoven with painted oak colours radiating for her head, represent, as with Ita, a halo. which according to O'Connell, \\"symbolizes the spiritual fire which Ita spent her life in enkindling and keeping burning.\\" Clarke left notes on the window frame how \\"in the border and wherever possible emblems are introduced symbolising Ita's great devotion to the Holy Trinity.\\" Three jewels representing the Trinity are sown into her gown. The lower panel shows her, alongside her maids, in prayer to the Trinity, with, according to O'Connell, shows their \\"prayers ascending through the firmament to the Throne of God.\\" Clarke's preparatory notes describe the lower register as depicting \\"St. Ita with her with her holy maids [who pray] with St. Coleman and St. Brendan\\", while the borders show \\"the heads of four Irish saints over whom St. Ita exercised spiritual influence.\\" Albert of Cashel Albert of Cashel, central panel The window of the little known eighth century missionary saint Albert of Cashel was designed immediately after the Finnbar and Ita windows. It was installed in 1916 and is located on the chapel's north wall. Albert is shown preaching in the upper panel, with red hair and a purple chasuble, crimson stole and a mitre. He sits on an elaborately decorated green, blue and golden throne, which is positioned underneath a large cross. His shoes are decorated with blue and grey diamonds, while the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven are shown at his feet. The window is adorned with Celtic motifs, including the bronze spirals around his beard. The lower register shows Albert in the act of blessing as he walks in a procession with a number of followers, including St. Erhard and St. Hildulph, both of whom he is said to have met while in Regensburg in Bavaria, Germany. Our Lady of Sorrows and St. Joseph The last two of Clarke's windows depict Mary and Joseph, and were installed in Cork in April 1917, a year after the chapel's openening. Both were favourably reviewed when previewed in his Dublin studio. Mary's window is located to the right of the altar. Due to its mournful tone, it is said to depict Our Lady of Sorrows. She is shown as \\"Mary of the Irish\\", with red hair and an emerald halo. She wears a deep royal blue and turquoise robe, and is shown holding a pink rose. The uppermost panel contains a star representing of the Holy Family, below which is the Holy Spirit indicated by tongues of fire. In the lower panel, St. Cronan of Roscrea holds a scroll inscribed with notation and lyrics from \\"Cronan na Magdine\\", an Irish lullaby. He is surrounded by four early Christian martyrs, each bearing emblems. Around these figures are four Japanese seals, which were influenced by work from Henry Payne's students at the Birmingham School of Art. The upper panel of Joseph's window shows the saint wearing a crown of fire, and standing beside the Holy Family and four angels. In the main panel, he wears a gold and red cloak, and is given a blue and green halo. Clarke's depiction of Joseph is based on a 14th century representation of the prophet Zephaniah now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. In contrast to contemporary Catholic representations of Joseph which depict him as a healthy and strong middle aged man, Clarke shows him in the medieval tradition, as an old and frail man. The lower panel illustrates a scene from Joseph's death, with Mary, Jesus, Finnbarr, Columcille and a number of other saints kneeling in prayer at his deathbed. =An T√∫r Gloine= Honan window, An T√∫r Gloine, c.1916 Sarah Purser and Edward Martyn formed An T√∫r Gloine (\\"The Glass Tower\\") in 1902 as a workshop to advance the artistic quality of stained-glass production in Ireland. The workshop was managed by Sarah Purser‚Äôs pupil A. E. Child, who was then teaching at the Metropolitan School of Art in Dublin. The studio's eight windows are attributed to Child (St. Ailbe, St. Fachtna and St. Coleman), O'Brien (St. John, St. Flannan and St. Munchin) and Ethel Rhind (St. Carthagh). The cartoons, like those from Clarke's studio, were designed and realised in Dublin before installation in Cork. Although their subject matter is similar to Clarke's, An T√∫r Gloine window's are very different in style and not of the same quality, being somewhat conventional by comparison. They are minimalist in line and colour, consisting of a dominating but simply rendered and naturalistic central figure in pale hues, surrounded by uncomplicated, largely empty opaque sub-panels. The most prominently placed window is Child's \\"Our Lord\\" on the east gable above the altar. Child depicts the risen Christ in simple forms, subdued colours and with a strong but dignified facial expression. O'Kelly's describes the portrait of Christ's eyes \\"as look[ing] out on humanity with a welcoming and understanding sympathy.\\" Our Lord (Child) The central single-light window was designed by Alfred Child and is located directly above the altar. It is set in pale and subdued tones, and shows the risen Christ holding the banner of the Resurrection. He is set off from the other saints by the window's tone frame the splendour of his crown, his crimson robe and his royal jewels. O'Connell described the window as a \\"touching and appealing figure marked apart in its frame of stone [which] forms the centre of such rich but restrained decoration as the chapel contains.\\" O'Kelly writes that his \\"bearded countenance is calm and dignified and the eyes look out on humanity with a welcoming and understanding sympathy.\\" St. John (O'Brien) \\"St. Fachtna\\", Child c.1916 Catherine O'Brien, who came from an Anglo-Irish and devout Church of Ireland family, joined An T√∫r Gloine in 1904 and is credited with three of the chapel's windows. Her \\"St. John\\" window in the only in the chapel to portray a biblical narrative and is usually considered the strongest of An T√∫r Gloine's windows. It is divided into three registers, each containing pairs of medallions. Its imagery mostly concerns the life of Christ as told in the Gospel of John and draws more from close readings of scripture than traditions of iconography. The upper register is based on Revelations 1:1, and shows a vision of the glorified Christ in Majesty, with the Alpha and Omega symbols and the seven candles. The crucifixion scene in the central register is more richly coloured that the other panels and per tradition shows Mary and St. John at the foot of the cross. More characteristic of Protestant than Catholic iconography is the depiction of a serpent with its mouth open, coiled around the cross below Jesus' feet; the serpent probably refers to Genesis 3:15: \\"And I will put enmity between thee (the serpent) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\\" The medallions below the crucifixion reflect two accounts of John's brother James. The lowest register is again in bright colours and shows the calling of James and John. The images stays with scriptural tradition; James and John are accompanied by their father, and are the second pair to be called, after St. Peter and St. Andrew, who are already at Jesus' side. The eagle at the foot of the window is John's usual symbol. Furnishings, textiles and objects O'Connell was keen that the chapel's artwork would draw from Ireland's ancient culture and was heavily influenced by 19th century antiquarian research into early Christian and early medieval art, in particular early medieval metal and stone works and illuminated manuscripts. He wanted the chapel to reflect the earlier period's influence on Irish culture, while maintaining a relatively simple physical outlay, comprising what Teehan describes as a \\"peaceful, dignified space.\\" The chapel's furniture includes circular iron ventilation ceiling panels and the oak chair and kneeler reserved for the president. The majority of the of the fittings were designed by McMullen or Sisk & Sons. The furnishings and oak pews were designed to blend into the chapel's Celtic Revival style and (according to Teehan) create \\"a way that represented the spirit and skill of earlier times [that] could nonetheless be fully appreciated by contemporary society. The overall effect is one of simplicity and restfulness.\\" Changes in liturgy following Vatican II meant that a number of furnishings had to be replaced, a project overseen by the chapel's then dean, Gear√≥id √ì S√∫illeabh√°in. The Honan has a large collection of metalwork and enamel pieces built by Edmond Johnson's and Egan & Sons, all in the Celtic Revival style. The most well- known piece is a large processional cross, a replica of the 12th-century Cross of Cong, which contains a number of inscriptions, including a remembrance for the chapel's benefactors, Mathew, Robert and Isabella Honan; and for John and Mary O'Connell. Other items include further processional crosses, chalices, candlesticks, dishes, bells, hinges, and the iron gates at the entrance. O'Connell commissioned Egan & Sons for the altar plate and vestments. Most of the textile collection was designed by the Durn Emer guild formed in Dublin by Evelyn Gleeson and Elizabeth and Lily Yeats. Their additions include vestments, chasubles, burses, veils, stoles, maniples, altar cloths, wall hangings and altar fronts. The tapestry dossal on the east wall, designed and woven by Gleeson, contains Celtic symbols borrowed from the Book of Durrow. Materials vary from silk embroidery, gold braid, gold thread, linen, poplin and cotton. In general the textiles are coloured in line with changes in the seasons of the liturgical year. Most of the designs are centred around the Life of Mary, or the Passion, or Crucifixion, with black and white being the predominant colours. The pipe organ is on the west wall in a timber frame. It was built by Wicklow native Kenneth Jones and installed in 1996. Michael Barry Egan's firm designed and sewed many of the vestments. A highlight is the Y-shaped, silver threaded chasuble in black poplin cloth, made for use at funerals. Covering the altar is a violet altar cloth with a frontlet that is decorated with Celtic interlacing, realised in shades of purple silk with orange and yellow highlights, and a border of lemon and violet cotton satin. The altar also has candlesticks. The \\"Black set\\" of Honan textiles includes an altar frontal with a Celtic cross based on a grave stone from Tullylease Church in Cork, and a black hooded cope with a crown-of-thorns design, and a black chasuble designed for funeral masses containing Celtic interlace patterns. Administration and liturgical services The chapel's day-to-day operations are run in conjunction with UCC's chaplaincy department, while management and funding is provided by the Honan Trust, established in 1915. The Honan is a separate legal identity from the university and holds the title for its demise, bounded by its back wall and chapel gates. Its dean is secretary to the Board of Governors of the trust, manages the staff and finances, and is responsible for the chapel's conservation and maintenance. The Honan holds daily and Sunday masses as well as memorial services for deceased students and staff. Morning prayers are held each Monday and daily during Advent and Lent. It hosts an average of 150 wedding services per year for graduates, which are a funding source for the chapel. It also holds a number of musical and other cultural events.

The region is described in common folklore as lush region flanked by six forests in which is said to have resided a myriad of sages and seers. The district was also famous for its missionary, the Arcot Mission of the Reformed Church.  Under the British Raj  During the British Raj, the North Arcot district formed a key province in the then Madras Presidency, under the control of the Nawabs of Arcot. The region of Arcot under the control of the Mughal regime in India was under the jagir or fiefdom of the Subah of Arcot. The famous Palar river intersects the region and the portion of Arcot to the north of the Palar came to be known as North Arcot. It is described as an inland district on the eastern side of the Madras Presidency, lying between 12 degrees 20 mins and 13 degrees and 55 mins North and 78 degrees and 14 mins and 79 degrees and 59 minutes E, with an area of . On the north the district is separated from Cuddapah by a portion of the Eastern Ghats and locally known as the Tirupati Hills, form the town of that name which lies at their foot. The range is broken by a long valley running northwards into the Cuddapah District. Advantage has been taken of this gap by the north-west line of the Southern Railway which passes up in through the ghats on its way to Mumbai. On the west of the District runs up to the Mysore plateau. In the south-west, separated from the eastern ghats by the fertile valley of the Palar, is the detached group of the Javadi Hills, well wooded and containing much game which divides the district from Salem and part of South Arcot. Along the southern and eastern borders, adjoining South Arcot and Chingleput, the terrain is flat and uninspiring. In the north-east, the Nagari Hills are conspicuous with the high precipitous cliffs, the most important peak being the Nagari Nose (2,824 feet), in the Karvetnagar zamindari over- looking the railway line. From all the hill ranges, numerous small boulder- covered spurs branch off towards the center of the district and combine to render it one of the most varied and picturesque areas in the region. None of the hills is particularly lofty, the general elevation of the Eastern Ghats and the Javadis being about 2,500 and respectively. The highest peak is Avalapalle Drug (3,829 feet) in the Punganuru Zamindari. Carnatikgarh (3,124 feet) in the Polur taluk and Kailasagarh (2,743) feet in Vellore, both on the Javadis, are other peaks of importance. Each has a small bungalow on its summit which forms a pleasant retreat in the hot season. Except the Javadis, the hills are generally uninhabited. The chief rivers of the district are the Palar and its tributaries, the Cheyyar and the Poini. Except for a few days, the beds of these are dry, sandy wastes. The Cheyyar river rises in the Javadis. It first flows southwards into the South Arcot District, then bending to the east and north-east and enters the southern taluks of North Arcot, flows eastward across them and finally joins the Palar river near Walajabad in Chingleput District.

Pokolbin lies within the Hunter Valley Important Bird Area.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Hunter Valley. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2011-07-11. History The Darkinjung people (specifically the Wonarua tribe) originally inhabited the Cessnock area, including Pokolbin, for more than 3000 years. They were the major inhabitants at the time of European contact. This contact was disastrous for the Darkinjung people. Many were murdered or died as a result of European diseases. Others were forced onto neighbouring tribal territory and killed. Many lost the will to live and occupied shanty ghettos on the edge of white settlements. Settler pressure on land also constricted traditional tribal and clannish domains, often leading to tribal fighting. Viticulture in the Hunter Valley is often considered to have commenced with James Busby. In the 1820s he studied oenology, wrote a treatise and guidance manual on the subject and briefly taught viticulture at a Liverpool farm school. In 1831 he undertook a tour of French and Spanish vineyards which resulted in two published journals of the trip.http://www.smh.com.au/news/New-South- Wales/Pokolbin/2005/02/17/1108500198424.html He returned with 570 cuttings of which 363 survived carefully wrapped in moss, sand and soil.http://www.winecompanion.com.au/wines/1001-wines-under-20/james-busbys- vinous-ark Half went to the newly established Royal Botanical Gardens in Sydney.

Also in 1828 George Wyndam planted vines at his Dalwood estate with the first shiraz being planted there in 1830.http://www.wyndhamestate.com/Our- Story/History The Drayton family established a vineyard at Pokolbin around the late 1850s and the Tyrrells Estate was set up in 1859 with Frederick Wilkinson planting vines at Oakdale in 1866. After the Robertson Land Act was introduced in 1861 the way was opened for small landholders and more people began to settle in the Rothbury/Pokolbin area. The main farming activities were wheat, tobacco, dairy and grapes. By the 1930s the area was known for producing quality wines. Wine Pokolbin is surrounded by the Pokolbin subregion of the Hunter wine region, which includes numerous wineries, ranging from large multi-national to small family run operations, many of which are popular tourist destinations. Tourism A vineyard in Pokolbin Tourist accommodation in the area is plentiful due to the wine industry and Pokolbin's proximity to Sydney, which is to the south, reached via the Pacific Motorway.

Harburg. The comic number is sung by the Cowardly Lion played by Bert Lahr during the scene at the Emerald City, when the Lion, Dorothy (with Toto), Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow are waiting to learn whether the Wizard will grant them an audience. Lahr employs a spoken interlude during the number, in which the rest of the group ask him how he would deal with other powerful animals if he were king, for example: :Supposin‚Äô you met an elephant? :I'd wrap him up in cellophant! The song contains the line \\"What makes the Hottentot so Hot?\\" a phrase that is now considered an offensive term for the Khoikhoi tribe of Africa. The term is not censored for broadcast or in reproductions, though, as it is accepted as an anachronism. Two portions of the song were cut for reasons of time: a brief middle stanza in which the other characters echo the verse that preceded it and Lahr first proclaims himself \\"Monarch of all I survey\\" (a line repeated later in the song), and the final stanza which ended with the Lion proclaiming \\"If I...were...king!\\" (two versions were recorded: one where Lahr himself unsuccessfully tries to hit the high note on the final word, and instead does so in his character's trademark growl; the other has the final high note powerfully delivered by soprano Georgia Stark, who was paid $25 for her involvement). The complete version of the song can be heard on the deluxe 1995 soundtrack release from Rhino Records, along with the less extensive single- disc release. Additionally, the complete version was used for the 1996 soundtrack recording of The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True, also from Rhino. In this version, Nathan Lane (who performs as the Lion) has an addition to the lyrics which is \\"Not queen, not duke, not prince...or the Artist Formerly known as Prince\\". The song has been used in several of the stage versions of The Wizard of Oz. In addition, Tom Hardy sings it while playing the title role of Al Capone in the 2020 biopic film Capone.

The Council's remit, is to do this by: *developing theological, ethical and spiritual perspectives on issues; *representing the Church in offering on its behalf appropriate and informed comment on political and social issues; *building, establishing and maintaining networks and relationships with leaders in society, and engaging in long-term dialogue with them; *supporting local congregations by offering resources on contemporary issues; *conducting of an annual review of progress and reporting to the Council of Assembly. The Council was formed on 1 June 2005. Its current convener (2012-2016) is the Rev Sally Foster Fulton. The previous conveners were Rev Ian Galloway, minister of Gorbals Parish Church, Glasgow (2008-2012) and Mrs Morag Mylne (2005-2008), an advocate based in Edinburgh. The Council Secretary (since 2015) is the Rev Dr Martin Johnstone. He succeeded the Rev Ewan Aitken (who served 2008-2014). Mr Aitken was formerly minister at St Margaret's Parish Church in Restalrig, Edinburgh; he is also an Edinburgh city councillor and was Labour Party group leader on the City of Edinburgh Council.

The Education Committee, SRT Project and the Parliamentary Office continue to exist under the umbrella of the Council. The Church and Nation Committee was founded in 1919. In its early days, the Committee promoted an anti-Roman Catholic agenda. Under the leadership of the Rev John White in 1923, the Committee published a highly-controversial (and since- repudiated) report entitled \\"The Menace of the Irish Race to our Scottish Nationality.\\" The report accused Roman Catholics of Irish birth or descent of being part of a conspiracy to subvert Presbyterian values and of being the principal cause of drunkenness, crime and financial imprudence. In 2002, however, the General Assembly passed a resolution that \\"regrets any part played in sectarianism by our church in the past and affirm our support for future moves towards a more tolerant society\\". The Assembly also received a report from the Church and Nation Committee entitled \\"The Demon in our Society: Sectarianism in Scotland.\\" The Convener of the Church and Nation Committee in 2002 was the Rev. Alan McDonald, who became Moderator in 2006. The Church and Nation Committee had one of the highest profiles in the Church of Scotland. It took a lead in campaigns, such as opposing nuclear weapons and promoting devolution for Scotland.

The Bee- Hive was established in 1861 by George Potter, with professional journalist George Troup as editor and Robert Hartwell as the main contributor. Cooperative Society activist Lloyd Jones was a leader writer for the Bee-hive. It advocated strike action and supported the New Model Trade Unions of the 1860s and had been set up to support the builders' struggle which had started in 1858. It was swiftly adopted as the official journal of the London Trades Council (LTC), but by 1862 only had a circulation of 2700, and had led to Potter accumulating debts of ¬£827. Some members of the LTC complained that the Bee-Hive gave its support too unreservedly to strike action, with Robert Applegarth accusing Potter of being a \\"manufacturer of strikes\\". Potter defended the policy by arguing that each strike had been judged as necessary by a trade union, and therefore deserved the full support of the Bee-Hive. The support of London labour groups was split between the London Trades Council leadership (known as the Junta) and Potter's supporters who feuded furiously. In particular there was great animosity between George Howell and Potter which resulted in the exclusion of supporters of the Bee-Hive from the early meetings of the Reform League and frequent outbursts in the Bee-Hive against the Reform League and Howell. Howell wrote about Potter and Hartwell in a letter to Edmond Beales:- \\"They live on slander and falsehood. They slandered good Mr. Lincoln. They slandered Mr. Gladstone. They have inserted the Trade slanders against Mr. Bright. In fact, who have they not slandered? I leave them in contempt and disgust.\\" Beales became exasperated by the disruptive effect the scurrilous attacks were having on the Reform movement and resented the need to refute Hartwell's misrepresentation of the facts. Applegarth lead an investigation into the Bee-Hives reporting in 1865, and accused Potter of personal dishonesty and maladministration regarding the journal's coverage of an industrial dispute in North Staffordshire. As a result, the Bee-Hive ceased to be the LTC's official journal and Potter lost his seat on the executive board. Potter went on to establish the London Working Men's Association (LWMA), with the Bee-Hive as its official journal. The journal continued to advocate rights for trade unions and supported the more radical members of the Liberal Party. Potter took up editing of the Bee-Hive, but it sold poorly and was only saved from bankruptcy when Samuel Morley (a Liberal MP) and Daniel Platt bought up shares in the newspaper in June 1868. During 1870 Rev. Henry Solly, the veteran founder of working men's clubs and institutes, took over as editor and introduced a less radical tone. Articles such as \\"Men who have Risen\\", \\"The Origin of Prussian Greatness\\" and the ultra-submissive \\"Letters to Statesman\\" were typical of this time. In early 1871 Platt ran into financial difficulties and Solly departed as editor. Potter returned, albeit in a more sober guise. A thawing between Potter and Howell took place and from 1871 Howell became a frequent contributor to the Bee-Hive. In 1877 the Bee- Hive changed its name to the Industrial Review. In late 1878 it was on the verge of collapse and Potter offered Howell co-partnership and full editorial control if he could raise ¬£150. The Bee-Hive had been a losing proposition for nearly a decade so no-one could be found who was willing to put up the money. It was subsequently declared bankrupt, with debts of over ¬£2000. Potter attempted to continue his business by publishing political pamphlets and biographies but this too ended in failure. The natural successor to the Bee- Hive was the Labour Standard which was published from 1881 to 1885.

History The station signed on the air in October 1948 as WCMI-FM in Ashland as a simulcast of its AM sister station WCMI's broadcast schedule. The call letters were said to refer to the steel industry of Ashland as \\"Where Coal Meets Iron\\". On November 20, 1970, the call letters were changed to WAMX- FM and ownership was transferred to W. Richard Martin and Stereo 94, Inc. The station broadcast with an adult contemporary music format and experimented with an album oriented rock format at night during the early 1970s. In the mid-1970s, WAMX-FM (also known as 94X) adopted a contemporary hit radio (CHR) format until its sale to Storer broadcasting in 1983. With the sale, the studios moved to nearby Huntington, and the station adopted an album oriented rock format (AOR).

In 1987, he started contacts with pro-Iran sources, and eventually he created contacts between them and the rest of the leadership of Amal. He was expelled from Amal and he established his own organization, the \\"Believing Resistance\\".  Biography  Captured by Israeli commandos in 1994, he was held in administrative detention and was offered in exchange for Israeli servicemen held by Hezbollah. At the time, Israeli forces were in control of the southern Lebanon security buffer, in order to prevent the region from being used as a launching ground on attacks on Israel's Galilee region. Israel believed that Dirani had exclusive knowledge to the whereabouts of Israel Air Force navigator Ron Arad, who was captured by Dirani's armed men in 1986, and has been unheard of since then. During his interrogation by military officers, Dirani reportedly disclosed that Arad had been turned over first to a Hezbollah militia unit and then to Iranian Revolutionary Guards, who were in Lebanon at the time aiding Hezbollah guerrillas. But neither Iran nor any guerrilla group has ever offered any useful information about his fate. Allegedly, Dirani received $300,000 for transferring Ron Arad to the Iranians. Dirani alleges that he was sodomized and tortured by his Israeli captors. He testified in an Israeli court to this abuse. These allegations were reported by the Associated Press, Al Jazeera, and the Jerusalem Post. Initially the International Red Cross was denied permission to see Dirani, but a court order forced Israeli prison authorities to comply with legal rules. In January 2004, in a German-mediated prisoner swap, Dirani along with 22 other Lebanese detainees, about 400 Palestinians, and 12 Israeli-Arab prisoners was released in exchange for the bodies of three Israeli soldiers and Israeli businessman Elchanan Tannenbaum.

HMP Jamestown Established in 1826 and due for replacement in 2017 relocating to the Half Tree Hollow area HMP Jamestown provides accommodation for convicted and remanded prisoners and also provides a police custody facility for arrested persons. Located in the centre of Jamestown adjacent to the police headquarters at Ogborne House, HMP Jamestown is also home to the Offender Management Service. The service, which started in 2011, delivers pre sentence reports to the courts, community sentencing and probation. In addition it is responsible for supervising those serving parole or life licence. Due to the remote nature of Saint Helena, its prison must be capable of managing all categories of prisoner locally, at least for short periods following arrest or conviction.

He was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia in 1807, the son of a British consul, and studied in England. He was called to the bar in 1835 and subsequently came to Upper Canada where he was admitted to the bar in 1838. In 1836, he married Emma Robinson, the daughter of D'Arcy Boulton. He opened a practice in Toronto, later partnering with Matthew Crooks Cameron. In 1845, he was chosen as Inspector General, a post in the Executive Council, and elected to the Legislative Assembly in a by-election held in Huron in 1846 and was reelected in 1848. He was defeated in the 1851 election, but elected again in Huron and Bruce in 1854, serving on the Board of Railway Commissioners and once again as Inspector General. In 1855, Cayley introduced the Audit Act which established an auditor of public accounts and the Audit Board, a new government department. He was elected one more time in an 1858 by-election for Renfrew; he retired from politics in 1861. He served as a director of the Bank of Upper Canada and was president in 1861. He served as Auditor General for the province of Ontario from 1870 to 1877. Cayley died in Toronto in 1890.

Wilder had personally ensured that his \\"Lightning Brigade\\" of mounted infantry was equipped with the new Spencer repeating rifle, though he initially had to appeal to his men to pay for these weapons themselves, before the government agreed to carry the cost. The victory at Hoover's Gap was attributed largely to Wilder's persistence in procuring the new rifles, which totally disoriented the enemy. Early life and career Wilder was born in the Catskill Mountains in Hunter, Greene County, New York, the son of Reuben and Mary (Merritt) Wilder. He was a descendant of a long line of soldiers. His grandfather and great-grandfather, both named Seth Wilder, fought in the American Revolutionary War. After the great-grandfather lost a leg in the Battle of Bunker Hill, Seth, Jr. took his place. Wilder's father Reuben fought in the War of 1812. Wilder spent his younger years in Hunter, where he attended school. When he turned nineteen, his school days over, he decided to head west to make it on his own. Wilder soon arrived in Columbus, Ohio, nearly penniless, and found employment as draftsman and then as an apprentice millwright at a local foundry. This training would lay the groundwork for his career. In 1857, eight years after he arrived in Columbus, Wilder moved to Indiana, first to Lawrenceburg and then to Greensburg, where he married Martha Jane Stewart and raised a large family. He established a small foundry of his own, which rapidly became a success. Wilder invented many hydraulic machines that he patented, and he sold equipment, as well as building mills and hydraulic works in many of the surrounding states. He also became nationally renowned as an expert in the field of hydraulics, patenting a unique water wheel in 1859. Civil War At the outbreak of the Civil War, Wilder organized a light artillery company in the Greensburg area, even going so far as to cast two six-pounder cannons at his foundry. Wilder's company was mustered into state service but the Federal government declined to accept it, as Indiana had already met its quota of artillery units. Instead, Wilder was commissioned as a captain, and his men were organized as Company A, 17th Indiana Infantry Regiment at Indianapolis. When the 17th Indiana left for western Virginia in July 1861, Company A took along the two cannons. Once in Virginia, the old Company A was permanently detached and eventually reorganized as the 26th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery but was commonly known as the \\"Wilder Battery\\" in recognition of its first commander. Meanwhile, Captain Wilder was quickly promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 17th Indiana on 4 June 1861, serving where he remained during the early campaigns in Virginia and garrison duty in Kentucky. In March 1862 Wilder was promoted to colonel, becoming the commander of the 17th Indiana. During the campaign to take Corinth, Mississippi, Wilder quickly earned a reputation as a competent, and even gifted, regimental commander. In the 1862 Confederate offensive into Kentucky, Gen. Braxton Bragg's army left Chattanooga, Tennessee, in late August. Bragg approached Munfordville, a station on the Louisville & Nashville Railroad where Wilder commanded the Union garrison, which consisted of three regiments with extensive fortifications. Wilder refused Brig. Gen. James R. Chalmers's demand to surrender on September 14, telling him, \\"I think we'll fight for a while\\", and his men repulsed Chalmers's attacks that day, inflicting 283 casualties with a loss of only 37. This forced the Confederates to conduct siege operations September 15‚Äì16. By this time, Wilder's 4,000 men were almost completely surrounded by 22,000 Confederates with 100 artillery pieces. Realizing that Union reinforcements were nearby and not wanting to kill or injure innocent civilians, the Confederates communicated still another demand for surrender. Wilder personally entered enemy lines blindfolded under a flag of truce, and Maj. Gen. Simon B. Buckner escorted him to view all the Confederate troops and to convince him of the futility of resisting. Impressed, Wilder surrendered his garrison. The formal ceremony occurred on September 17. Wilder spent two months as a prisoner of war before being exchanged.Cozzens, pp. 14-15. Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park Wilder received wide attention for his performance in the Tullahoma Campaign. He mounted his brigade on horses and mules that his men appropriated from the local area and moved into the battle with such rapidity that his men soon became known as the \\"Lightning Brigade\\", comprising the 17th Indiana Infantry Regiment, the 72nd Indiana Infantry Regiment, the 98th Illinois Infantry Regiment, the 123rd Illinois Infantry Regiment, and the 18th Independent Battery Indiana Light ArtilleryBaumgartner, Richard A. (2007). Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga. Huntington WV: Blue Acorn Press. p. 70. .. (They were also known as the \\"Hatchet Brigade\\" because Wilder issued them long-handled hatchets to carry instead of cavalry sabers.) His men also carried Spencer repeating rifles, which were capable of a rate of fire far greater than their Confederate adversaries. Bypassing Army red tape, Wilder had asked his men to vote on purchasing the rifles and they agreed unanimously. He obtained a loan from his hometown bank and each man of the brigade co-signed a personal loan of $35 ($713 in 2019) for his rifle. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21. On June 24, the Lightning Brigade seized and held Hoover's Gap. Despite orders from general Joseph J. Reynolds to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to hold the position, defeating repeated attempts to dislodge his force until the infantry arrived and winning the most significant battle in the Tullahoma Campaign. The Army of the Cumberland's commanding officer, William Rosecrans soon arrived on the scene. Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it. Wilder was the principal commander of a diversion launched against Chattanooga - artillery bombardments known as the Second Battle of Chattanooga - deceiving the Confederates into thinking the Union army would approach Chattanooga from the north in conjunction with Union forces at Knoxville.Woodworth, p. 54. Just before the start of the Battle of Chickamauga, Wilder's brigade played a crucial role at Alexander's Bridge on September 18, 1863, defending the crossing of West Chickamauga Creek and helping to prevent the Confederates from flanking the Union army.Woodworth, pp. 83-84. On the second day at Chickamauga, September 20, Wilder's brigade with its superior firepower was one of the few units that was not immediately routed by the Confederate onslaught against the Union right flank. Advancing from its reserve position, the brigade launched a strong counterattack, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \\"Bloody Pond\\". Wilder decided to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of the main Confederate column. However, just then Assistant Secretary of War Charles A. Dana found Wilder and excitedly proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to calm down the secretary and arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19. Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas formally commended Colonel Wilder for his performance at Chickamauga. Wilder did not directly participate in the main Battles for Chattanooga in November, but he led the brigade during much of the Atlanta Campaign in the spring and summer of 1864. He was promoted to brevet brigadier general of volunteers on August 7, 1864. Throughout much of 1863 and 1864, Wilder suffered from bouts of dysentery brought on by a case of typhoid fever in 1862. For health reasons, he resigned from the Army in October 1864 and returned home.Eicher, p. 569; Cox, p. 11. Postbellum career After the war, Wilder settled in Rockwood, Tennessee, and later in Chattanooga. In 1867, he founded an ironworks in the Chattanooga region, then built and operated the first two blast furnaces in the South at Rockwood, Tennessee. In 1870, he established a company in Chattanooga to manufacture rails for the railroads. From 1884 to 1892, he helped promote and construct the Charleston, Cincinnati & Chicago Railroad while living in Johnson City, Tennessee. While in Johnson City, he developed the booming industrial suburb of Carnegie, named in honor of fellow industrialist, Andrew Carnegie, and a host of iron making and railroad-related manufacturing facilities. Iron ore was brought to Johnson City via the East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad, and Wilder constructed a popular 166-room hotel near Johnson City named the Cloudland Hotel near the summit of Roan Mountain to serve tourists via this scenic narrow gauge railway line. Wilder entered politics and was elected mayor of Chattanooga in 1871. He resigned a year later to pursue his business interests. He unsuccessfully ran for the United States Congress in 1876. In 1877, he accepted the position of city postmaster, serving until 1882. He moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1897 after receiving an appointment from President William McKinley as a Federal pension agent, then was commissioner of the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park. He died in Jacksonville, Florida, aged 87, while on his annual winter vacation with his second wife, Dora Lee, and was returned for burial in Forest Hills Cemetery in Chattanooga with his first wife, Martha Jane Stewart. Two of Wilder's homes in Tennessee, the General John T. Wilder House in Knoxville and the John T. Wilder House in Roan Mountain, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Another that he built in Greensburg, Indiana is commemorated by a historic marker. Notes References * Baumgartner, Richard A.

An animation depicting the orbits of GPS satellites in medium earth orbit. Scenarios The TTFF is commonly broken down into three more specific scenarios, as defined in the GPS equipment guide: * Cold or factory: The receiver is missing, or has inaccurate estimates of, its position, velocity, the time, or the visibility of any of the GPS satellites. As such, the receiver must systematically search for all possible satellites. After acquiring a satellite signal, the receiver can begin to obtain approximate information on all the other satellites, called the almanac. This almanac is transmitted repeatedly over 12.5 minutes. Almanac data can be received from any of the GPS satellites and is considered valid for up to 180 days. Manufacturers typically claim the factory TTFF to be 15 minutes. * Warm or normal: The receiver has estimates of the current time within 20 seconds, the current position within 100 kilometers, and its velocity within 25 m/s, and it has valid almanac data. It must acquire each satellite signal and obtain that satellite's detailed orbital information, called ephemeris data. Each satellite broadcasts its ephemeris data every 30 seconds, and is valid for up to four hours. * Hot or standby: The receiver has valid time, position, almanac, and ephemeris data, enabling a rapid acquisition of satellite signals. The time required of a receiver in this state to calculate a position fix may also be termed Time to Subsequent fix (TTSF) Many receivers can use as many as twelve channels simultaneously, allowing quicker fixes.GPS information site Why twelve channels? Many cell phones reduce the time to first fix by using assisted GPS (A-GPS): they acquire almanac and ephemeris data over a fast network connection from the cell phone operator rather than over the slow radio connection from the satellites.

The house, which is also known as Newton House, was built between 1608 and 1612, on the site of an earlier building, originally owned by the Norman de Salmonville family from the 1200s. The site was purchased by clothier Robert Harbin, who arranged to have the house removed and the new building erected.https://www.countrylife.co.uk/property/ancient-grade-listed-manor- house-exhaustively-restored-now-equipped-luxurious-21st-century- living-205868#YiJDOBxmv0HqDjHb.99, An ancient, Grade I-listed manor house, exhaustively restored and now equipped for luxurious 21st century living The mansion was extensively altered and enhanced in the 1870s; at the time, it still contained much of its original furniture and an eclectic library of many thousands of volumes. There were also 17th-century tapestries, portraying scenes of \\"Elijah Rising into Heaven and the Melting of the Golden Calf\\" in sculpted gold frames, and collections of antique pewter and pistols and swords. Some of the contents were given to the Museum of Somerset, the Somerset Military Museum and auctioned at Sothebys in London. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. The Surmaville part of the name comes from the de Salmonville family. A 2007 report stated tat there were various outbuildings including the stables, gardeners cottage, and barn.

The gardens were also improved and expanded. A report with photographs in 2019 stated that the Newton House provided over 15,000 square ft of living space; the property also included a renovated three-bedroom gardener's cottage that was rented to holiday-makers, two large garages and several outbuildings that housed a gin manufacturing business.  Grounds  The gardens and pleasure grounds cover around two hectares, and slope down to the River Yeo. They were laid out in the mid 18th century, with further landscaping in the 19th. The pleasure gardens included five ponds, a boathouse, a curving lime avenue canter, a walled kitchen garden, a rose garden and herbaceous borders to the east of the pond accessed via circa 1700 gates. The summerhouse dates from 1750, and was built as a 3-storey octagon with 2-storey flanking wings. It has since been converted into a holiday-let cottage.

Domestic warrens are artificial, enclosed establishment of animal husbandry dedicated to the raising of rabbits for meat and fur. The term evolved from the medieval Anglo-Norman concept of free warren, which had been, essentially, the equivalent of a hunting license for a given woodland. Architecture of the domestic warren The cunicularia of the monasteries may have more closely resembled hutches or pens, than the open enclosures with specialized structures which the domestic warren eventually became. Such an enclosure or close was called a cony-garth, or sometimes conegar, coneygree or \\"bury\\" (from \\"burrow\\"). =Moat and pale= To keep the rabbits from escaping, domestic warrens were usually provided with a fairly substantive moat, or ditch filled with water. Rabbits generally do not swim and avoid water. A pale, or fence, was provided to exclude predators. =Pillow mounds= A modern view of a medieval pillow mound at Stoke Poges, England The most characteristic structure of the \\"cony-garth\\" (\\"rabbit- yard\\")English Garth \\"small, enclosed plot\\" is from Old Norse gar√∞r \\"yard, courtyard, fence\\". is the pillow mound. These were \\"pillow-like\\", oblong mounds with flat tops, frequently described as being \\"cigar-shaped\\", and sometimes arranged like the letter ‚ü®E‚ü© or into more extensive, interconnected rows. Often these were provided with pre-built, stone-lined tunnels. The preferred orientation was on a gentle slope, with the arms extending downhill, to facilitate drainage. The soil needed to be soft, to accommodate further burrowing.See Schematic diagram of a pillow mound. This type of architecture and animal husbandry has become obsolete, but numerous pillow mounds are still to be found in Britain, some of them maintained by English Heritage, with the greatest density being found on Dartmoor.The One Show, BBC One news programme.

Further evolution of the term Ultimately, the term \\"warren\\" was generalized to include wild burrows: see also > The word thus became used of a piece of ground preserved for these beasts of > warren. It is now applied loosely to any piece of ground, whether preserved > or not, where rabbits breed. The use is further extended to any system of burrows, e.g., \\"prairie dog warren\\". By 1649, the term was applied to inferior, crowded human accommodations and meant \\"cluster of densely populated living spaces\\" (OED). Contemporarily, the leading use seems to be in the stock phrase \\"warren of cubicles\\" in the workplace.

They attained prominence only in the eleventh century, through marriage with the Ottonian dynasty of Holy Roman Emperors. Named after Ezzo, Count Palatine of Lotharingia from 1015 to 1034, they dominated the politics of the middle and lower Rhine and usually represented the royal interests. Under the Salian Emperors, they even briefly held the dukedoms of Swabia, Carinthia, and Bavaria. The Ezzonids first appear with Erenfried I (866904), count of the Bliesgau, , and , and perhaps also of the Charmois. He may have had Carolingian ancestors, although some historians prefer to link him to the former Thuringian kings. The political ascent of the Ezzonid dynasty becomes historically visible with the number of counties they acquired in the second half of the tenth century. They ruled most of the Rhenish counties and were eventually granted Palatine status over the other counts of the district. In spite of their military accomplishments in the service of the Emperors, the Ezzonids did not succeed in building a territorial entity in Lotharingia.  Counts Palatine of Lotharingia  The Abbey of Brauweiler was founded by Ezzo, Count Palatine of Lotharingia. * Hermann I, Count Palatine of Lotharingia. * Ezzo, Count Palatine of Lotharingia (1015‚Äì1034). According to the Brauweiler chronicle, he failed to succeed to the monarchy after the death of emperor Otto III (983‚Äì1002) in a rivalry with duke Henry II of Bavaria (1002‚Äì1024). The succession war between Ezzo and Henry II continued for over ten years. The two men came to an agreement after a battle at Odernheim in 1011. Kaiserswerth, Duisburg and the surrounding imperial territories were granted as a fief to Ezzo for renouncing the throne (after 1016). When the German crown passed from the Ottonians to the Salians in 1024, the Ezzonids remained neutral, apparently after an agreement between Ezzo and Konrad II (1024‚Äì1039). * Otto I, Count Palatine of Lotharingia (1035‚Äì1045) and Duke of Swabia (1045‚Äì1047). In 1045, after a successful campaign against the rebel count of Flanders, the margrave of Valenciennes and Ename, Otto received the duchy of Swabia, in exchange however for the cities of Kaiserswerth and Duisburg, which went back to the crown. At the same time, the palatinate of Lotharingia was passed to his nephew. *Heinrich I, Count Palatine of Lotharingia (1045‚Äì1060, ‚Ä†1061), son of Count Hezzelin I (1020‚Äì1033), who was a brother of Ezzo. *Hermann II, Count Palatine of Lotharingia (1064‚Äì1085), Count of the Ruhrgau, Zulpichgau and Brabant. His territorial power was importantly reduced by his guardian, Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne. Hermann is assumed to be the last of the Ezzonids. After his death at Dalhem on September 20, 1085, the Palatinate of Lotharingia was suspended. His widow remarried the first count palatine of the Rhine, Henry of Laach.

The Witch Is Dead\\" is the centerpiece of several individual songs in an extended set-piece performed by the Munchkins, Glinda (Billie Burke) and Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. It was also sung by studio singers and represented as being sung by the Winkie soldiers. It was composed by Harold Arlen, with the lyrics written by E.Y. Harburg. The group of songs celebrate the death of the Wicked Witch of the East when Dorothy's house is dropped on her by the tornado and the death of the Wicked Witch of the West after being splashed with water. In 2004 \\"Ding-Dong! The Witch is Dead\\" finished at #82 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of the top tunes in American cinema. In 2013, the song charted to #2 on the UK Singles Chart in the aftermath of the death of former Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. Scenario The sequence starts with Glinda encouraging the fearful Munchkins to \\"Come Out, Come Out, Wherever You Are\\" and meet Dorothy, who \\"fell from a star\\" named Kansas, so that \\"a miracle occurred.\\" Dorothy begins singing, modestly explaining through descriptive phrasing that it \\"It Really Was No Miracle\\"; it was the wind that brought the apparent miracle. The Munchkins soon join in and sing joyfully, perhaps not really understanding how she got there, but happy at the result. Like several of the songs on the film's soundtrack, this one makes extensive use of rhyming wordplay, containing as many Hays Office-approved words rhyming with \\"witch\\" as the composers could think of: \\"itch\\", \\"which\\", \\"sitch\\"-uation, \\"rich\\", etc. After a short interval in which two Munchkins present a bouquet to Dorothy, Glinda tells the Munchkins to \\"let the joyous news be spread\\" that \\"the wicked old witch at last is dead!\\" The Munchkins then sing the march-style number \\"Ding- Dong! The Witch Is Dead.\\" After its one verse, there is another interruption, as the city officials need to determine if the witch is \\"undeniably and reliably dead.\\" The coroner (Meinhardt Raabe) avers that she is, and the mayor reiterates Glinda's advice to the Munchkins to spread the news. The Munchkins oblige, and sing \\"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\\" again. As the Munchkin soldiers march, looking vaguely like toys, some trumpeters issue a fanfare very similar to the fanfare at the beginning of the \\"March of the Toys\\" from Babes in Toyland. This has a notable though perhaps unintended subtlety. In 1903, the operetta had been written to compete with an early and successful Broadway rendition of The Wizard of Oz. In addition, in 1934, there had been a film version of Babes in Toyland, which was presumably still recent in the memories of the audience. In the next interval, three Munchkin girls in ballet outfits and dancing en pointe sing \\"We Represent the Lullaby League,\\" and welcome Dorothy to Munchkinland. Immediately after, three tough-looking Munchkin boys sing \\"We Represent the Lollipop Guild,\\" actually the same tune as \\"Lullaby League,\\" and they similarly welcome Dorothy to Munchkinland, the center Munchkin (Jerry Maren) giving her a large round all-day sucker. The boys fade back into the crowd as they all come forward and begin singing and dancing \\"We Welcome You to Munchkinland.\\" The Munchkins sing and dance merrily, with \\"Tra-la-la-la-la-la-las,\\" until the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton), the other witch's sister, bursts onto the scene in fire and brimstone, putting a sudden stop to the Munchkins' revelry, as her own well-known, sinister-sounding instrumental theme plays on the track. Cutting room floor There was to have been a reprise of the song, beginning \\"Hail Hail! The Witch is Dead\\", sung by the leader of the Winkies (the witch's guards) after the Wicked Witch of the West had been melted and the spell over them was broken, and the lead Winkie had given Dorothy the witch's broomstick. It was to be continued by the townspeople of the Emerald City, who would sing it in a medley along with a reprise of \\"The Merry Old Land Of Oz\\". This song and its scenes were cut from the film, which instead jumps directly from the witch's castle (minus the singing Winkie) to the Wizard's throne room. Parts of the song's recording survived and were included in the Deluxe CD soundtrack. The film footage of the celebration is lost, with the exception of a short clip that was actually in the film's original theatrical trailer, though it had been cut from the film. It was re-staged in the 1995 television stage production The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True, and also in the 2011 Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. Voices Nearly all of the Munchkin voices were dubbed in by uncredited voice actors, who sang in their normal voices at a specific tempo, and the recordings were electronically pitched up to create the Munchkin \\"voices\\" that the audience hears during playback. The Deluxe CD includes the actual voices of the three \\"Lollipop Guild\\" on-screen performers for contrast. According to the CD liner notes, the uncredited voice actors for certain segments were: *\\"The Lullaby League\\": Lorraine Bridges, Betty Rome and Carol Tevis. *\\"The Lollipop Guild\\": Billy Bletcher, Pinto Colvig, and Harry Stanton. *\\"Hail Hail the Witch Is Dead\\": Ken Darby (the arranger) Bletcher and Colvig had previously performed voice work notably in Three Little Pigs, and would go on to do a significant amount of voice work for the Warner and Disney cartoon studios. Bletcher himself was a short man, at 5 feet 2 inches, though notably taller than the Munchkins he voiced.

In the season 3 premiere of the Fox TV series Glee, cast members Lea Michele and Chris Colfer sing a duet version. In Brooklyn Nine-Nine, the season 7 episode, aptly titled Ding Dong, depicts Captain Raymond Holt celebrating the death of his rival Commissioner Madeleine Wuntch by chanting ‚ÄúDing Dong, the Wuntch is Dead!‚Äù  Usage as a meme in politics  Following the death of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 2013, a social media campaign, whose Facebook page had been set up in 2007, emerged among anti-Conservative activists to encourage sales of the song so that it would chart on the UK Singles Chart; the song reached #2 on the chart and peaked atop the Scottish Singles Chart. Ruth Duccini and Jerry Maren, who portrayed Munchkins in the 1939 film, reacted negatively. Duccini stated: When it did chart, BBC Radio 1 did not broadcast the song in its entirety during its countdown programme The Official Chart, instead playing a Newsbeat report about the campaign. The BBC justified the decision due to its context as a celebration of Thatcher's death. The campaign was countered by one involving \\"I'm in Love with Margaret Thatcher\\" (led by the lead singer of its performers, Notsensibles), which charted alongside \\"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\\".

Airport capacity Because only one aircraft can land or depart from a runway at a given time, and because aircraft must be separated by a certain distance or time to avoid collisions, every airport has a finite capacity; it can safely handle only so many aircraft per hour. This capacity depends on many factors, such as the number of runways available, layout of taxi tracks, availability of air traffic control, and current or anticipated weather. The weather can cause large variations in capacity; strong winds may limit the number of runways available, and poor visibility may necessitate increases in separation between aircraft. When an air traffic control unit that will control a flight reaches capacity, arriving aircraft are directed towards holding patterns where they circle until it is their turn to land. However, aircraft flying in circles is an inefficient and costly way of delaying aircraft, so it is preferable to keep them on the ground at their place of departure, called a ground delay program. This way, the delay can be waited out on the ground with engines off, saving considerable amounts of fuel. The careful calculation of en route time for each flight and traffic flow as a whole, which aims to minimize overall delays in the air traffic system, is highly dependent on computers. Operation in Europe All IFR flight plans are tracked by the Central Flow Management Unit (CFMU). Every airport and air traffic control sector has a published maximum capacity. When capacity is exceeded, measures are taken to reduce the traffic. This is termed regulation. The aim is to use capacity effectively, keeping the average delay as low as possible, while ensuring capacity is not exceeded. For example, if two flights are scheduled to arrive at an airport at exactly the same time, and the airport can handle one aircraft every five minutes, the aircraft may be assigned delays to ensure that the second aircraft arrives five minutes after the first. Similarly, the first aircraft will be required to depart on schedule and not allowed to depart late. This way, the second aircraft will not need to enter a holding pattern before landing.

In 2016 the population was 34,469. History Wandsbek was once part of the county Stormarn. Its villages were first mentioned in the middle of the 13th century. The name Wandsbek, Wandsbeck or (older) Wantesbeke derives from old Low Saxon (\\"Low German\\") for \\"border river\\" and the river Wandse was a natural territorial border. An old Danish phrase for stating that something is a fraud / unreliable is to claim that \\"det g√¶lder ad Wandsbek[/Vandsb√¶k] til\\" (i.e. \\"this is valid in Wandsbeck.\\"). Wandsbek was one of the three locations in the Danish monarchy where the first lottery drew its numbers, and this expression dates from the early years of this lottery's life where a number of people tried to claim prizes in Copenhagen with tickets from Wandsbeck. Since each of the three towns drew its own set of numbers, a ticket from one town was worthless in the two others. Until 1864 Wandsbek was a part of the Duchy of Holstein and under the rule of the King of Denmark. Afterwards, it became part of the Prussian province Schleswig-Holstein. In 1937 the still Prussian city of Wandsbek joined the city of Hamburg through the Greater Hamburg Act. Geography The quarter Wandsbek has an area of 6 km2. The western border is to the quarter Dulsberg in the borough Hamburg-Nord. The northern border to Bramfeld is the small river Osterbek. In the east are the quarters Farmsen- Berne and Tonndorf. The southern border to the quarter Marienthal is mostly the railway tracks of the city train. Demographics In 2006, 32,350 people were living in the quarter Wandsbek. The population density was 5,397 people per km2. 11.7% were children under the age of 18, and 21.9% were 65 years of age or older. 14.5% were immigrants. 1,754 people were registered as unemployed.Residents registration office, source: statistical office Nord of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein (2006) In 1999 there were 19,083 households, out of which 14.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them and 54.1% of all households were made up of individuals.

Characters can also throw their opponents, and items can be collected from chests, as well as some enemies, to give extra points, restore health and grant the character their special attack. The game uses sprite scaling techniques to allow characters to move to the far back of the screen and give a feeling of perspective. The game also makes use of the foreground, something rarely done at this time, as characters perform special attacks very close to the screen, some so close that only their torso and head will fit; likewise enemies can jump from the foreground to fight (characters cannot be hit while in these animations). Plot The corrupt Sheikh Sazabiss has abducted Princess Lurana, and he is utilizing every unscrupulous means of power he has at his disposal to achieve his ultimate ambition of conquering the world. The quartet of valiant and fearless warriors bravely come face-to-face with Sazabiss. As they battle to save Lurana, the foursome, freely using magic, their most prized possession, journey to the castle of Sazabiss to save the princess and the planet.

It was the last car to be launched by Daimler before its parent company, the Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA), sold it to Jaguar Cars in 1960. Concept, design and engineering Shortly after being appointed Managing Director (Chief Executive) of BSA's Automotive Division in 1956, Edward Turner was asked to design a saloon car powered by a V8 engine. The engine drawings were finalised by March 1958, but the saloon prototype, project number DN250, was not available for examination by the committee formed in 1958 to report on the feasibility of the V8 cars. The committee's evaluation centred on the prototypes being tested at the time, which were for the SP250 sports car project. According to the feasibility study conducted by the committee, the SP250 would generate a profit of more than ¬£700,000 based on a projection of 1,500 cars being sold in the first year of production and 3,000 cars per year for the second and third years of production. Two-thirds of the sales of the car were expected to be in the United States. The study also determined that the body should be made from fibreglass, with shorter time to the beginning of production, tooling costs of ¬£16,000 as opposed to ¬£120,000 for steel bodies, and lower cost to change the styling. The original version, later called the A-spec, could reach a speed of , but the chassis, a \\"14-gauge ladder frame with cruciform bracing\\" based on the Triumph TR3, flexed so much that doors occasionally came open, marring its reputation. Bumpers were originally an optional extra. With the basic specification not including full bumpers, the A-spec. cars have two short, chromium-plated 'whiskers' on the body on either side of the front grille and two short, vertical bumpers, or \\"overriders\\" at the rear, which were not included if the rear bumper was optioned. Early A-spec. cars had recesses behind the door handles, but these were phased out. The manual gearbox, the first of the type used by Daimler since they started using the pre-selector type across their range in the 1930s, was reverse- engineered from the Standard gearbox used in the Triumph TR3A.

The car was described as a 2+2, but the bench-like rear seat offered very limited leg-room unless the front seats were pushed fully forward. *Engine: V 8 iron block, water cooled, OHV, bore 76 mm x stroke 70 mm, capacity 2547 cc.

Chrysler, whose Dodge division owned the trademark for the \\"Dart\\" model name, ordered Daimler to change the name under threat of legal action. With little time to come up with a new name, Daimler used the project number, SP250, as the model number. Daimler Dart SP250 =Police use= Between twenty-six and thirty black SP250s were used by the British Metropolitan Police in London. These were used by the Traffic Department to catch up with speeders, especially caf√© racers. The police cars used the Borg-Warner Model 8 3-speed automatic, which the Metropolitan Police found to be better for town work and high speed chases, and was also found to be more economical, avoiding the clutch wear that a manual car would develop with usage between 18 and 24 hours a day. Traffic police in Bristol, Cambridge, Liverpool, Manchester, Southend and Surrey also used the SP250 for speed enforcement, as did police forces in Australia and New Zealand. After the opening of the first section of the M1 in 1959, the Bedfordshire police used the SP250 for motorway patrol. Development =B-spec= Later version with front bumper, no quarter flashes, and no recess behind the door handle Jaguar bought Daimler in 1960, and were immediately concerned about the chassis flex. They brought out the B-spec. version with extra outriggers on the chassis and a strengthening hoop between the A-posts. There were also other detail improvements, including an adjustable steering column. B-spec. and C-spec. cars do not have the 'whiskers' that A-spec. have and some do not have the optional front bumper, so there is very little front protection for these cars. =C-spec= The C-spec. version, introduced in April 1963, included a trickle charger socket, a heater/demister unit, and a cigarette lighter as standard equipment. =Prototypes= DP250 The DP250 was a sports saloon based on the SP250's chassis. A DP250, built on chassis no. 100571, was exhibited in 1959 at Hooper's stand during the coachbuilder's last appearance at the Earls Court Motor Show. Daimler had prepared a sales brochure for the DP250, but it did not enter production. Between two and seven prototypes were made. The show car had a steel body, but some of the prototypes may have been made from fibreglass. After Jaguar Cars bought the Daimler Company from BSA, William Lyons ordered a fibreglass-bodied DP250 prototype to be completed. Upon seeing the finished car he had it scrapped immediately and ended the project. None of the prototypes survive; the show car is believed to have been destroyed while being tested at MIRA. SX250 Ogle Design produced a coup√© version called the SX250. It was shown at the 1962 Earls Court Motor Show, but it was not taken up by Daimler and the body design was later used for the Reliant Scimitar. Performance A car with hard top tested by The Motor magazine in 1960 had a top speed of and accelerated from 0‚Äì in 8.9 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£1,489 including taxes. Legacy 2,654 SP250s were produced in five years of production, far short of the projection of 3,000 per year by the second year of production. Jaguar built a prototype replacement under project number SP252 with a neater body style but decided not to proceed with production. According to former Jaguar chairman Lofty England, the cost to build the SP252 would have been greater than that of Jaguar's popular and more expensive E-Type, thereby creating internal competition from a product with no practical profit margin and with uncertain market acceptance. The 2¬Ω litre V8 engine used in the SP250 was used by Jaguar to power the smaller saloon Daimler had wanted from the start. This was basically a Jaguar Mark 2 with the V8 engine from the SP250 modified to fit in the Mark 2 engine bay and revised interior, trim, and suspension settings. Sold between 1962 and 1967 as the Daimler 2¬Ω-litre V8 and from 1967 to 1969 as the Daimler V8-250, this was, as at 1995, the Daimler car with the highest production figures. =Die-cast models= * Spot-on produced a model of the SP250 in the 1960s, available in a number of colours including red and light blue. * Crossway models introduced a model in 2007, available in various colours and with or without the hood up. * NOREV produced an open top SP2520 model in BRG and possibly other colours. * Oxford Diecasts produced several versions of the SP250 with wire or steel wheels in Police and civilian versions both open, side windows raised and with top closed. =Media appearances= * Modesty Blaise had an ivory-coloured SP250 in the early book versions of her adventures, and it also appeared occasionally in the comic strip. * An SP250 features briefly in the film The Fast Lady. * A green SP250 was used in the ITV Series Heartbeat in 2005. * Other film appearances can be found at : http://www.imcdb.org/vehicles.php?make=Daimler&model;=SP+250&modelMatch;=1&modelInclModel;=on * A red Daimler SP250 appears in the opening sequence of the BBC Antiques Roadshow Antiques Roadshow Series 33 \\"Meanwhile, Fiona takes a spin in the car that stars in the programme's opening sequence - the classic Daimler Dart.\\" * In the movie \\"Viva Las Vegas\\", a Daimler Dart can be seen on screen as Elvis Presley and Cesare Danova are inspecting Ann-Margret's car.

It runs from Farmingdale in the Nassau County town of Oyster Bay to the village of Babylon in Suffolk County. It runs mainly west-to-east in a northwest to southeast direction. Unusually, the mileage count on the reference markers on the highway begins at the route's eastern terminus at NY 27A in Babylon and increases as the route heads west and north toward Farmingdale. This runs contrary to the New York State Department of Transportation's standard practice of inventorying an east-west route from west to east. Route description NY 109 running west from NY 27A in Babylon NY 109 begins at a fork in the road from NY 24's western segment (Conklin Street) in the Nassau County village of Farmingdale. It proceeds eastward as Fulton Street in Farmingdale, a four-lane commercial arterial through the town, passing multiple apartment buildings. At Main Street, a median starts developing in the center, dividing NY 109 as it crosses through a residential section of Farmingdale. Soon crossing back into the town of Oyster Bay, the route parallels the Central Branch of the Long Island Rail Road as it heads through town. After crossing into another large commercial district, this time in the village of East Farmingdale in the town of Babylon, Suffolk County, NY 109 enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with NY 110 (Broad Hollow Road). NY 109 westbound at the junction with CR 2 (Straight Path) in Babylon Now known as Farmingdale Road, the route passes a jughandle for Republic Airport. NY 109 crosses into an interchange with the Southern State Parkway and the Corporal Tony Casamento Highway. NY 109 changes names to Babylon-Farmingdale Road, passing south of Mount Ararat Cemetery. The four-lane arterial crosses through a large industrial section of Babylon, entering an intersection with County Route 3 (CR 3; North Wellwood Avenue). Changing over to a commercial neighborhood of Babylon, NY 109 remains four lanes, crossing an intersection with CR 2 (Straight Path). A short distance later, NY 109 enters an interchange with NY 27 (the Sunrise Highway) right where the boulevard form converts over to a limited access freeway. NY 109 continues east through Babylon, crossing between a commercial and residential neighborhood. Proceeding southeast, the route enters an intersection with Little East Neck Road North and CR 96 (Great East Neck Road). NY 109 changes names to Little East Neck Road North and turns southeast through Babylon. The four lane boulevard crosses into Argyle Park, crossing under the Long Island Rail Road Babylon Branch and into an intersection with CR 12 (South Railroad Avenue). NY 109 bends southward through Argyle Park, remaining four lanes into Deer Park, where it meets an intersection with NY 27A (West Main Street), the eastern terminus of NY 109. History NY 109 was assigned to its current alignment in the early 1930s and has not been altered since.

It has also been called paleo-karst collapse.A CASE HISTORY OF A LARGE KARST INVESTIGATION: Lynn Yuhr, Richard C. Benson, Ronald D. Kaufmann, Daniel Casto and John JenningsPaleokarst in Iowa by Robert M. McKay This has the effect of collapsing the formerly intact rock above, forming extensive fractures, debris pipes, and open caverns. Normally, the process was started and completed in the geologic past. Illustration of the mechanism of paleocollapse The mechanism of its formation is relatively simple. As in the illustration, a deeper layer of salt (or other evaporite) is dissolved, through some process. The support for the upper rock vanishes, and starts the collapse process. This is much like the subsidence associated with old coal mines. Eventually, the caving process reaches the surface, and can be associated with debris pipes, rock fractures, and open caverns. At some later date, undisturbed sediments, or glacial till may fill the collapse zone. Paleocollapse geology can be remarkably stable (unlike karst), but poses some serious challenges to engineering or environmental geology. Primarily, the collapse zone is extremely permeable. This can provide a conduit for groundwater, or contaminant transport.Paleocollapse structure as a passageway for groundwater flow and contaminant transport: W.F. Zhou As well, these zones may only be marginally stable, in that they can be reactivated by human activity, or events such as earthquakes. In China, underground mines have become suddenly flooded, due to paleocollapse features. In order to fully characterize the hazard, investigations may be undertaken, using dye tracers, or exploration geophysics. Of particular importance is understanding the true stability of the region. The paleocollapse process may continue at some future date, due to deep groundwater flow changes. Or perhaps, the reason that a certain evaporite zone has dissolved, is because of underlying faults in the bedrock.

Description  Prosqualodon was related to and looked like modern toothed whales. It was about long and resembled a dolphin. It had long jaws with interlocking teeth that jutted to the outside, remaining visible when the jaws were closed, like those of a gharial. In the back of the mouth it had triangular teeth similar to those of earlier cetaceans, but in most other respects, it was relatively advanced. It had developed the body form of modern whales, with a short neck and simple jaw structure, and like modern cetaceans, it also had a blowhole. The olfactory apparatus was reduced compared with earlier forms, suggesting that it had already lost much of its sense of smell, presumably relying on sound to catch its prey.

Prior to 2011, when district reforms were made in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, it was the capital of the now bygone Nordvorpommern district, which was abolished and merged to create the district of Vorpommern-R√ºgen. Geography Stralsund gate Mill's gate Greifswald gate Town hall Grimmen is located in southeastern Nordvorpommern on the banks of the river Trebel, about 30 km south of Stralsund and 30 km west of Greifswald. The town is connected to the Stralsund- Neustrelitz-Berlin railways, and to Autobahn A 20. Adjacent to the city limits are Amt Franzburg-Richtenberg in the West, Amt Miltzow in the North, and the S√ºderholz municipality in the Southeast. =Villages within Grimmen's city limits= In addition to the town of Grimmen, the following villages are also within Grimmen's city limits: * Appelshof * Gerlachsruh * Grellenberg * Gro√ü Lehmhagen * Heidebrink * Hohenwarth * Hohenwieden * Jessin * Klein Lehmhagen * Stoltenhagen * Vietlipp =Neighbouring municipalities= Neighbouring municipalities, listed clockwise beginning in the North, are Wittenhagen, Wilmshagen, S√ºderholz, Wendisch Baggendorf, Splietsdorf, Papenhagen. History Grimmen was founded during the Ostsiedlung, when about 1250 merchants and craftsman from Lower Saxony, Westphalia and the Lower Rhine settled the site which then was part of the Principality of R√ºgen. The first document mentioning Grimmens is of 1267. In 1287, a report mentions Vogt Berthold taking office in the town, and further mentions that Grimmen had already been granted L√ºbeck law before. The actual charter is lost, thus the exact date when the town received L√ºbeck law remains uncertain. Accordingly, the 700th anniversary was celebrated in 1987. Since 1325, Grimmen belonged to the Duchy of Pomerania. During the Thirty Years' War, the town was looted several times. After the war, Grimmen became part of Swedish Pomerania, a dominion of the Swedish Empire. From 1695 to 1697, mayor Johannes Flittner cruelly pursued alleged witches; at least seven were executed. In 1797, a large fire destroyed almost the entire town. In 1800, Swedish king Gustav IV Adolph visited Grimmen and resided in the so- called king's house. Following the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Swedish Pomerania with Grimmen became part of the Prussian Province of Pomerania. An administrative reform of 1816 made the town capital of a Kreis. In 1853, cholera broke out. At the end Second World War, Grimmen surrendered to the Red Army without fighting in April 1945. In the 1960s, numerous new factories and agricultural enterprises were set up, resulting in prosperity and physical growth of the city. After East Germany's Communist regime collapsed following Die Wende movement of 1989, the town's old buildings were reconstructed. After a reorganization of the Kreis districts in 1994, Grimmen became capital of newly created Vorpommern-R√ºgen. =Demography= *1600 - approx. 1,000 inhabitants *1712 - approx. 850 inhabitants *1809 - 1,840 inhabitants *1900 - 3,616 inhabitants *1946 - 8,298 inhabitants *1986 - approx. 15,000 inhabitants *1990 - of 14,242 inhabitants *1993 - 13,376 inhabitants *2003 - 10,892 inhabitants *2004 - 11,201 inhabitants =Twin cities= #Chateaulin #Czaplinek #Kamie≈Ñ Pomorski (Cammin) #Osterholz-Scharmbeck #Staffanstorp Sights =Buildings= The oldest building of the town is St. Mary's church, built in 1267.

History The Order of Hermes was founded by the wizards Trianoma and Bonisagus. Trianoma had the desire to unite the disparate Magi of Europe into a single group, who could learn from one another. She did not know how to accomplish this goal until she met Bonisagus. He had created a consistent theory of magic which would allow magi to share information, using a common frame of reference. Also, he had invented the ritual Parma Magica, a personal, protective, magical shield. Having Parma Magica would allow magi to meet face to face without fear of magical attack. Trianoma became Bonisagus' student, learned his theory and the Parma, then traveled throughout Europe recruiting other wizards. Eleven Magi joined her. Bonisagus and the eleven Magi established twelve Houses in a fellowship called the Hermetic Order of Hermes. The Order quickly recruited like-minded wizards, teaching the protective Parma Magica to Magi, who would take the Order's Oath of mutual cooperation. The wizards who refused to take the Oath were not taught the Parma Magica. Instead, they were hunted down and destroyed. Houses Every member of the Order belongs to one of the twelve Houses. The Houses were established by and named after Bonisagus and eleven of the twelve other Founders. Each House is led by a Primus (Latin = \\"the first\\", female Prima, general plural Primi). The Primi's authority and duties vary greatly between the Houses, ranging from absolute authority (House Tremere) to mere representation (House Verditius). The Primus lives in the domus magna (Latin = \\"Great House\\"), the headquarters of each House. Bonisagus, Guernicus, Mercere, and Tremere Houses are the True Lineages. This means that each Magus was taught by a Magus of that House, and that master-apprentice relationship goes back to their founding Magus. These Houses are the backbone of the Order of Hermes. Houses Bjorn√¶r, Criamon, Merinita, and Verditius are the Mystery Cults of the Order. They are groups of Magi who have been initiated into at least one of their household's Mysteries. Ex Miscellanea, Flambeau, Jerbiton, and Tytalus are social Houses. These Magi are brought together by shared interests, common philosophies, and camaraderie. ;Bjorn√¶r:Shapeshifters and beast Magi belonging to a Germanic tradition, instead of the Roman or Latinate Tradition. They venerate animal ancestors and strive to perfect the Heartbeast. Each Bjorn√¶r has a Heartbeast--an animal, rarely a plant--which is their true form. This House is a Mystery Cult, a gathering of Magi initiated into the same Mysteries. The Outer Mystery opens the Heartbeast and the Inner Mysteries allow the Magi to unlock mythic forms. The Magi are divided into six clans, descending from the House‚Äôs six original apprentices. These fierce Magi shun the civilized lands and embrace the wilderness. The domus magna is Crintera in the Stubnitz Forest, on the Isle of Rugen in the Rhine Tribunal, which was the first established Tribunal. ;Bonisagus:Masters of magical knowledge and theory. Most Magi seek knowledge through scholarship. This House is the most revered True Lineage, continuing to supply knowledge and leadership to the Order. They explore the theoretical applications of magic, delving deep into its arcane secrets. Some Magi follow the example of Trianoma, sharing of knowledge through diplomacy. The Oath of the Order allows the Bonisagi to claim any apprentices from the other Magi, but they are legally required to share all their discoveries. The domus magna is Durenmar, in the Black Forest, in the Rhine Tribunal. ;Criamon:Cryptic seers and prophets. They are the mystics of the Order, walking spiritual paths to answer the question posed by their founder, \\"How do we escape time?\\" The many paths that they walk may grant powers, which can include immortality. The domus magna is the Cave of Twisting Shadows in the Greater Alps Tribunal. ;Ex Miscellanea: Magi from other traditions, who answered the Order's \\"join us or die\\" policy by joining the Order. This House was established by Pralix, formerly of House Tytalus, to replace House Diedne. This House gathers Magi who do not fit into any other House. Such Magi may be tied to elements of pre- Hermetic Traditions, or may embrace an eclectic mix of traditions. This House embodies unity in diversity, but the emphasis is on diversity. The domus magna is Cad Gadu in the Stonehenge Tribunal. ;Flambeau: Masters of fire magic and combat. They are the champions of the Order, who fight for glory and honor, both their own and that of the Order. The House revels in bold adventurers who seek out and overcome fearsome opponents. Ironically, many of the Oath- breaking Magi are from House Flambeau, as are the Order's law-enforcing Hoplites, who hunt them down. There is one Flambeau lineage that studies magical destruction, Perdo, in lieu of fire. And, a secret lineage is dedicated to the extermination of all Bjorn√¶r Horse Magi. The domus magna is Val Negra in the Provence tribunal. The Fifth Edition changed this to Castra Solis, though the Tribunal remains unchanged. Most of the members of this house come from France and Spain. ;Guernicus: The Quaesitores are the official judges and criminal investigators of the Order. By force of law, these Magi have held the basic structures of the Hermetic Order of Hermes intact for over four hundred years. Some act as the Order's historians, having traced their rituals to as far back as the cults of Mercury in Rome and Thoth in Egypt. The domus magna is Magvillus in the Roman Tribunal. ;Jerbiton: Experts in the use of Mentem and Imaginem, these Magi live for the pursuit of beauty. They interact with the mundane world beyond the Order, for the sake of beauty, and to avoid the stunted lives that result from living in a closed community. The members are often writers, artists, philosophers, doctors, or other professionals. Some Magi are recruited from the nobility for their diplomatic leverage and aristocratic connections. The domus magna is Valnastium in the Greater Alps Tribunal. ;Mercere: The couriers of the Order hold the Magi of Mythic Europe together by facilitating communication, encouraging trade, and aiding the Magi. House membership is not restricted to those \\"Gifted\\" with magical abilities, out of respect for the House founder, who lost his Gift. Even those incapable of magic are considered to be full Magi by anyone, who wishes to continue receiving mail. The heralds, heroes, mercenaries, and merchants reflect the contradictions of their House: it is exotic, but traditional; loyal, but self-centered; proud, but humble. The domus magna is Harco in the Roman Tribunal. ;Merinita: Nature Magi of a non-Latinate tradition. After their founder disappeared, they reorganized as students of the Faeries under the Primus Quendalon. They move among the Fay, ultimately joining them. Their spells can draw on Faerie glamor, awakening the Fay around them, or inflicting curses upon those who cross them. The domus magna is Irencilia in the Rhine Tribunal ;Tremere: Magi who believe in order, obedience, hierarchy, and coordination. Their founder was weak in magic relative to the other founders of the Order, but he created certamen, the magical duel, as a means of dispute resolution, and as a rite of passage for Tremere Magi. The House tries to control events, by gathering influence and resources to respond to crises as they draw near. They are pragmatic, dutiful, and courageous Magi, who know that Mythic Europe is a chaotic and dangerous place. The domus magna is Coeris in the Transylvanian Tribunal. ;Tytalus: Magi who strive to improve themselves through conflict. They believe the main conflict is between an individual's nature and the rules imposed by society. They are famous for their long-term in-House rivalries, convoluted political schemes, and activities that skirt the edge of legality. The domus magna is Fudarus in the Normandy Tribunal. ;Verditius: Artificers and enchanters who cannot perform magic without tools. They craft great items, putting a little of themselves into their finest creations. Pride in their creations is often their downfall, making these Magi prone to the most deadly sin. The domus magna is Verdi in the Roman Tribunal. ;Diedne: This extinct, non-Latinate House practiced Druidic magic. It was destroyed in the Schism War by Tremere, Flambeau, and Tytalus, supported by the other Latinate Houses. The non- Latinate Houses Bjorn√¶r and Merinita ran for cover, re-emerging decades after the War. Tribunals The Order is divided into 13 Tribunals, each of which administers a region of Mythic Europe. Once every seven years, the Magi within a Tribunal hold a meeting, called a Tribunal, where new Magi are presented, new Masters are recognized, and new Archmagi are honored. The Quaesitores judge disputes, which cannot be resolved within a covenant, a magical community. The Tribunal is presided over by a Praeco, usually the eldest Magus or Maga present. The legality of the Tribunal is supervised by the ruling Quaesitor, who determines whether a quorum is present to legitimize the proceedings. Once every 33 years, each Tribunal sends a representative to a Grand Tribunal, which takes place in Durenmar, the domus magna of House Bonisagus. The Grand Tribunal proceeds much like a regional Tribunal, but the Primus of House Bonisagus is always the Praeco, and the Primus of House Guernicus is the ruling Quaesitor.

Once in Paris, Berger took part in the charitable works of the Abb√© Peter-Victor Braun, who chose her in 1866 to lead the new religious congregation of Sisters Servants of the Sacred Heart he founded to give continuity to their work. She had to flee Paris, however, when the city was besieged during the Franco-Prussian War. Forced to return to her homeland, she tried to start a new community in Elberfeld in the Rhineland but was forbidden to do so by the government during the Kulturkampf, a period when religious communities feared that they would be abolished by the government. In 1872 she got permission to emigrate to St. Louis, Missouri in the United States through the sponsorship of a family member she had nursed in Elberfield, who had later emigrated to Missouri. She left Germany with four companions from her small religious community.\\"Berger, Mother Mary Odilia\\", St. Louis Historic Preservation St. Louis The women arrived in St. Louis on 16 November of that same year. They were given hospitality at the Ursuline monastery of the city. After two weeks, they were able to rent a second-story attic in a building attached to St. Mary of Victories Church in the center of the city. They quickly began to carry out their mission through visiting the homes of poor to provide nursing care. Berger soon became a familiar sight on the streets of the city, carrying a large basket in which she carried nursing supplies and into which she would slip any donations given to her. It later became of a symbol of the origins for the congregation she founded.Franciscan Sisters of Mary \\"Heritage: Our Story of the Basket\\" The Sisters had gained nursing experience of the battlefronts of the war with France. This experience was to be of great use as an outbreak of smallpox hit the city a few months after their arrival. They nursed the sick and dying during this plague, even in their own residence. They became known in the area as the \\"Smallpox Sisters\\" as a result of their labors.\\"Our History & Heritage of Healing\\", SSM Health Foundress The Sisters organized themselves formally in 1874 as the Sisters of St. Mary, under the Rule of the Franciscan Third Order Regular. They took their name from the church, which shared a door with their living quarters. Mother Odilia was then canonically elected as the Superior General of the new congregation, of which she formally was acknowledged as the foundress. In 1877 the congregation made the decision to move from home care to institutional nursing. To this end, they borrowed the then-enormous sum of $16,000 to open their first hospital, St. Mary's Infirmary, in St. Louis. The Sisters of St. Mary became the city¬¥s primary providers of public health care. In 1878 Mother Odilia sent thirteen sisters, a third of the congregation, to Canton, Mississippi and Memphis, Tennessee during a Yellow Fever outbreak. Five of the sisters died of the disease; all of them under thirty years of age. Her congregation was officially recognized by the Archdiocese of St. Louis in October 1880, just days before Mother Odilia's death. She was buried in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis. In 1894, a group of seven Sisters were sent to Maryville, Missouri, under the leadership of Mother Mary Augustine Giesen, where they established one of the first hospitals in the region. They chose to separate from their congregation and formed the Sisters of St. Francis of Maryville.\\"Franciscan Sisters of Mary\\", The Sarah Community That congregation further expanded medical care, establishing the first hospital in the Oklahoma Territory. Today In May 1985 the two congregations voted to merge as a new religious institute. This took place in August 1987, with the new congregation taking the name of Franciscan Sisters of Mary. In 1997, Franciscan Sisters of Mary and four other communities: the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, Society of the Sacred Heart, School Sisters of Notre Dame, and the Sisters of Loretto formed the Sarah Community to address retirement needs and providing long-term care to their members and to the general public. The congregation, through SSM Health Care, today operates in Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma and Wisconsin. They administer 20 hospitals, two nursing homes, as well as a rehabilitation center. It also provides home care and a host of additional health-related services.\\"About us\\", Monroe Clinic References Category:1823 births Category:1880 deaths Category:People from Regen (district) Category:Founders of Catholic religious communities Category:German emigrants to the United States Category:German Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Category:American Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Category:Third Order Regular Franciscans Category:Burials at Calvary Cemetery (St. Louis) ","title":"Mary Odilia Berger"},{"id":"5651662","text":"Robert Antony Hayward, Baron Hayward, (born 11 March 1949) is a British Conservative Party politician.

He received the Japan Prize in 2006,The Science and Technology Foundation of Japan. Japan Prize official release , accessed 21 June 2006 the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in 2008,Lasker~DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award, 2008: Akira Endo the Canada Gairdner International Award in 2017.  Biography  Endo was born on a farm in Northern Japan and had an interest in fungi even when young, being an admirer of Alexander Fleming. He obtained a BA at Tohoku University (Faculty of Agriculture) in Sendai in 1957 and a PhD in biochemistry at the same university in 1966. From 1957 to 1978 he worked as a research fellow at chemical company Sankyo Co.; initially he worked on fungal enzymes for processing fruit juice. Successful discoveries in this field gained him the credit to spend two years at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine as a research associate (1966-1968), working on cholesterol. His most important work in the 1970s was on fungal extrolites and their influence on cholesterol synthesis. He hypothesised that fungi used chemicals to ward off parasitic organisms by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis. The cell membranes of fungi contain ergosterol in place of cholesterol, allowing them to produce compounds that inhibit cholesterol. Endo studied 6,000 compounds, of which three extrolites from Penicillium citrinum mold showed an effect. One of them, mevastatin, was the first member of the statin class of drugs. Soon after, lovastatin, the first commercial statin, was found in the Aspergillus mold. Although mevastatin never became an approved drug, the mevastatin derivative pravastatin did. He was an associate professor and later a full professor (1986-) at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology between 1979 and 1997, and after his official retirement became the president of Biopharm Research Laboratories.  Recognition  He was awarded several other prizes during his career: * Young Investigator Award in agricultural chemistry (Japan), 1966 * Heinrich Wieland Prize for the discovery of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (West Germany), 1987 * Toray Science and Technology Prize (Japan), 1988 * Warren Alpert Foundation Prize (Harvard Medical School, U.S.A), 2000 * Massry Prize from the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California in 2006 * Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award, 2008 * Inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, Alexandria, VA 2012 * Gairdner Foundation International Award, 2017 Apart from the recognition, Endo never derived financial benefit from his discovery, despite the fact that statins are amongst the most widely prescribed medications. \\"The millions of people whose lives will be extended through statin therapy owe it all to Akira Endo,\\" according to Michael S. Brown and Joseph Goldstein, who won the Nobel Prize for related work on cholesterol.

Since 2017, restoration of the railway and restarting the system has been sought.https://nation.com.pk/10-Aug-2020/chairman-railways-visits-kcr- trackhttps://tribune.com.pk/story/2260409/supreme-court-gives-four-more- months-to-overhaul-railways With its hub at Karachi City station on I. I. Chundrigar Road, KCR's revived operations would extend north to Gadap, east to Dhabeji, south to Kiamari and west to Hub. The revived KCR operation is intended to become an inter-regional public transit system in Karachi, with an aim to connect the city centre with several industrial and commercial districts within the city and the outlying suburbs. The revival effort of KCR have been proposed several times since becoming defunct, though remained unfulfilled due to lack of financial and political backing. In May 2017, the federal government approved a restoration package for the KCR,, however delays and disputes with the Sindh provincial government ultimately led to the cancellation of the funding. In August 2020, the federal government approved a rehabilitation package for the KCR restoration. The funding is slated to cover only phase one and phase two of KCR's restoration project, similar to the restoration of the Karachi-Peshawar Railway Line, according to Ameer Muhammad Daudpota.https://tribune.com.pk/story/2261296/rs105b-allotted-for-kcr- rehabilitation-in-ml-1-style History Karachi Circular Railway came into being during President Ayub Khan's tenure, who in 1962 suggested the use of trains as a means for short travel in Karachi. Operations began in 1969 under the administration of Pakistan Railways, with the aims to provide better transportation facilities to Karachi's growing population and outlying surrounding suburban communities. The original KCR line extended from Karachi City station and ended at Drigh Road station and carried 6 million passengers that year.Karachi Urban Transport Corporation, Official website Retrieved on 4 October 2012 Its instant success made Pakistan Railways a significant profit in its first year of operation. In 1970, KCR was expanded further east to Landhi Junction station while new track was extended westwards, thus opening Karachi Port Trust Halt station and Wazir Mansion station in 1970. Throughout the 1970s, track was further extended westwards and northwards towards North Nazimabad, forming a \\"loop line\\" which circled around several of Karachi's residential and industrial areas. At its peak, KCR ran 104 daily trains, of which 80 trains ran on the main line, while the remaining 24 trains ran on the loop line. During the 1990s, private transporters of Karachi contracted KCR staff and indulged in corruption. By 1994, KCR was in incurring major losses due to mismanagement. As a result, the vast majority of trains were discontinued with only a few running on the loop. By 1999, KCR operations had been discontinued. The official reason for the discontinuation was that the Pakistan Railways was said to be making a loss by running the trains all over the city with few passengers taking advantage of the facility. Another version suggests that private transporters conspired with some corrupt staffers in the railways to fulfill their desire to bag the bulk of passengers for themselveshttp://www.dawn.com/news/1310150/encroachments-major-obstacle-to- kcr-revival The result caused instant gridlock on Karachi's streets. Severe criticisms were lodged at Pakistan Railways mismanagement as well as Karachi's \\"road transport mafia\\". In 2005, revival plans for the KCR were initiated to fulfill the growing transportation needs of Karachi, but never fully materialized. In 2009, the Karachi Urban Transport Corporation was proposed http://www.dawn.com/news/880159 in which KCR would be operated as a semi- autonomous body. Pakistan Railways would have 60% share in the corporation, Sindh government 25% and Karachi 15%. Route The KCR will consist of a loop line from Karachi City to Drigh Road via Liaquatabad. 29 kilometres will be revived with an additional 21 kilometre dual track from Karachi City to Jinnah International Airport, allowing the KCR to connect to the Pakistan Railway main line. The KCR is expected to hold carry on average of 700,000 passengers on 246 trains daily when completed.

Description Reconstructions of Macrodelphinus and E. longirostris Eurhinodelphis was around in length. In most respects, it would have looked like a modern dolphin or porpoise, but its upper jaw was elongated into a sharp tip similar to that of a swordfish. Most likely, Eurhinodelphis used it in a similar manner to swordfish, hitting or stabbing prey. It also had long, sharp teeth. Compared with earlier fossil species, Eurhinodelphis had complex ears, suggesting that it already hunted by echolocation like modern whales. Its brain was also asymmetrical, a trait found in modern dolphins, and possibly associated with the complexities of navigating its environment. History Eurhinodelphis was first described by B. Du Bus in a paper read before the Royal Academy of Sciences of Belgium on 17 December 1867. O. Abel studied and illustrated the European species in a series of articles published in 1901, 1902 and 1905; subsequently, fossil skulls found in the Calvert Formation in Maryland and Virginia could be attributed to this genus.

He attended a Roman Catholic seminary but did not take a religious vocation. =Teaching career= In 1969 Hughes began work as a trainee personnel manager at the Unilever plant in Port Sunlight. However he was very interested in the subject of history; and obtained a Certificate of Education from Liverpool University. In 1970 he joined the staff of Ruffwood Comprehensive School as a history teacher and from 1973 he was head of the history department. Initially a member of the National Association of Schoolmasters, he was later a member of the National Union of Teachers. Politics After joining the Labour Party in 1966, Hughes was elected to Huyton-with-Roby Urban District Council in 1969 and served until the council was abolished in local government reform in 1974. Hughes chaired the Housing Committee of the council, in charge of its council housing:\\"The Times Guide to the House of Commons 1983\\", Times Books, Revised and Updated edition 1984, p. 148. he found he had the power to decide whether a family would be housed.Gerry Harrison, \\"Appreciation: Sean Hughes\\", The Guardian, 27 June 1990, p. 39. In 1972 he was selected as prospective Parliamentary candidate for Crosby,F.W.S. Craig, \\"Political Companion\\" No. 11 (April/June 1972), p. 110. Hughes' name does not appear as a prospective Parliamentary candidate in No. 10 (January/March 1972) indicating his selection took place in the early months of 1972. then a safe Conservative seat. At the February 1974 general election Hughes came second in Crosby, with 27.2% of the vote and 15,570 votes behind the Conservative winner. He was shortlisted for the Labour candidacy in Wallasey, which was a marginal constituency, before the October 1974 general election, although he was not selected. He was chairman of Labour Party Young Socialists in the Northern Region for 1970‚Äì71. Hughes had in 1973 been elected to Merseyside County Council, serving one term until 1977. He became chairman of Huyton Constituency Labour Party in 1974, an office which had additional significance because the local Labour MP was Harold Wilson who was then Prime Minister. In later years Hughes was able to regale friends with anecdotes about Wilson's time in the constituency. He managed to prevent the Militant tendency infiltrating the constituency party, explaining that \\"I'm known as a good Catholic who doesn't want trouble\\". Election to Parliament During the 1979 election campaign, Sir Harold Wilson (who had resigned as Prime Minister in 1976) intimated that it would be his last contest. On 27 February 1981, Huyton Labour Party formally announced that Wilson would not seek renomination for the constituency at the next general election.\\"Sir Harold not to stand again\\", The Times, 28 February 1981, p. 1. Hughes put his name forward for the new selection, and on 17 May he was selected as prospective Parliamentary candidate for Huyton. Hughes was immediately identified as a moderate within the Labour Party,\\"Huyton candidate\\", The Times, 18 May 1981, p. 3. which was in the middle of an intense internal struggle between left-wingers and moderates. He was duly endorsed by the National Executive Committee in the same month. Sir Harold Wilson wrote in April 1983 that Huyton CLP had \\"consistently kept the extreme left-wing faction in check\\" and stated that Hughes had twice been responsible for proposing motions which defeated left- wing manoeuvring intended to take over the party ‚Äì including one quite recent attempt.\\"Sir Harold and 'Trots'\\" (letter), The Times, 23 April 1983, p. 9. Boundary changes enacted shortly before the election abolished the Huyton constituency, and Hughes transferred to the new constituency of Knowsley South which was based on Huyton and Roby. At the 1983 general election Hughes was elected with a majority of 11,769. Although there was a national swing to the Conservatives, in Knowsley South the swing was to Labour and Hughes had a higher majority than there would have been for a Labour candidate in 1979.Ivor Crewe, Anthony Fox, \\"British Parliamentary Constituencies: A Statistical Compendium\\", , Faber & Faber, 1984, p. 205. In Parliament Making his maiden speech on 27 June 1983, Hughes referred to the council estates that made up most of his constituency as \\"monotonous labyrinths, bleak, grimly regimented and dehumanising\\".Hansard HC 6ser vol 44 col 418. He complained that the resources to improve the estates were being withheld and that parts of the constituency had unemployment problems even more severe than elsewhere on Merseyside.\\"Fowler defends record on health service spending\\", The Times, 28 June 1983, p. 4. Later that year he deplored the closure of the Huntley & Palmers biscuits plant at Huyton, and pledged to raise the issue with the Government although he was sure they would refuse to intervene.\\"1,300 jobs go in biscuit factory closures\\", The Times, 7 September 1983, p. 2. Hughes quickly grew disillusioned about some of the routine work of a \\"voting fodder\\" Member of Parliament, and began suffering what he called \\"backbencher blues\\"; where once he had been able to decide housing allocations, he now felt he could do very little for the same families. He did get on well with the catering staff of the Houses of Parliament; they nicknamed him 'Yosser', while he noted that they had trained at a catering college in his constituency. His Parliamentary speeches were often enlivened by historical allusions, and were often scathing of the Thatcher Government but also for good humour, which won him friends on both sides of the Commons. Hughes' good humour was said to desert him only on Monday mornings if Everton F.C. had been defeated at the weekend.Ron Davies, \\"Sean Hughes - The radical loyalist\\" (obituary), The Guardian, 26 June 1990, p. 39. He was particularly passionate about improving education, serving on the Select Committee on Education from 1983. He also spoke forcefully on unemployment in his constituency, and was interested in the politics of Ireland, where he opposed extremist nationalism partly due to his understanding of European history. Opposition whip In 1984 Hughes was appointed as an opposition whip;\\"Dod's Parliamentary Companion 1988\\", p. 440. it was said that he would regard being called a \\"loyalist\\" as an accolade. When Robert Kilroy-Silk resigned as MP for the next door constituency of Knowsley North, Hughes was chosen as the organiser for the campaign of his successor George Howarth who had been imposed on a Militant dominated CLP by the Labour Party headquarters. Militant had hoped to see one of their members selected, and some of their fury was taken out on Hughes. Howarth was comfortably elected in the by-election. Hughes' skill as an organiser was also seen earlier that year when the FA Cup was a Merseyside derby played between Everton F.C. (which he supported) and their great local rivals, Liverpool F.C.. Hughes realised that Scottish MPs were given two free tickets to the English FA Cup in which few were interested; he lobbied nearly all the 72 Scots asking if they wanted the tickets or would give them to his constituents. The response was said to be good.\\"Scouse nous\\", The Times, 23 April 1986. Shadow Defence minister Re-elected in the 1987 general election with a majority nearly doubled on 1983,Robert Waller. The Almanac of British Politics\\" 4th Edition, 1991, , Routledge, pp. 147-48. Hughes was appointed as a member of the defence shadow ministerial team to speak on issues relating to the Army. His historical knowledge came to be very helpful and Hughes established a strong reputation for being able to spot weaknesses in Government policy; Ministers were said to have made sure they were well briefed when facing him. A report in the Conservative supporting Daily Telegraph described him as \\"the sort of MP that Labour doesn't deserve to have\\", a joke which Hughes himself reportedly enjoyed. He had been a lifelong supporter of unilateral nuclear disarmament and CND, but the Labour Party was embarking on a policy review. When Denzil Davies resigned as Shadow Secretary of State for Defence and was replaced by Martin O'Neill in 1988, Hughes assisted the team in helping to draft a new defence policy which would not lose votes for the party (as the policy in 1987 was thought to have done). He organised a referendum in his constituency party which appeared to repudiate unilateralism: 68% of party members thought that Britain should give up nuclear weapons only if other countries did so too. The Labour Party adopted a policy of multilateral disarmament at its 1989 conference. Death Hughes had been suffering from cancer for some time before his death in June 1990, one of three Labour MPs on Merseyside to have died in their 40s that year. He left a wife and young daughter.

The fortress was of great strategic importance for the control of the Left Bank of the Rhine, the Low Countries, and the border area between France and Germany. The fortifications were built gradually over nine centuries, from soon after the city's foundation in the tenth century until 1867. By the end of the Renaissance, Luxembourg was already one of Europe's strongest fortresses, but it was the period of great construction in the 17th and 18th centuries that gave it its fearsome reputation. Due to its strategic location, it became caught up in Europe-wide conflicts between the major powers such as the Habsburg‚ÄìValois wars, the War of the Reunions, and the French Revolutionary Wars, and underwent changes in ownership, sieges, and major alterations, as each new occupier‚Äîthe Burgundians, French, Austrian and Spanish Habsburgs, and Prussians‚Äîmade their own improvements and additions. Luxembourg took pride in the flattering historical epithet of the \\"Gibraltar of the North\\" as a result of its alleged impregnability. By 1443 it had only been taken by surprise by Philip the Good. In 1795, the city, expecting imminent defeat and for fear of the following pillages and massacres, surrendered after a seven-month blockade and siege by the French, with most of its walls still unbreached. On this occasion, advocating to extend the revolutionary wars across the French borders, the French politician and engineer Lazare Carnot explained to the French House of Representatives, that in taking Luxembourg, France had deprived its enemies of \\"...the best fortress in Europe after Gibraltar, and the most dangerous for France\\", which had put any French movement across the border at a risk.Kreins, Jean-Marie. Histoire du Luxembourg. 3rd edition. Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 2003. . p. 64. Thus, the surrender of Luxembourg made it possible for France to take control of the southern parts of the Low Countries and to annex them to her territory. The city's great significance for the frontier between the Second French Empire and the German Confederation led to the 1866 Luxembourg Crisis, almost resulting in a war between France and Prussia over possession of the German Confederation's main western fortress. The 1867 Treaty of London required Luxembourg's fortress to be torn down and for Luxembourg to be placed in perpetual neutrality, signalling the end of the city's use as a military site. Since then, the remains of the fortifications have become a major tourist attraction for the city. In 1994, the fortress remains and the city's old quarter were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  History  = From Roman fortification to medieval castle = In Roman times, two roads crossed on the plateau above the Alzette and P√©trusse rivers, one from Arlon to Trier, and another leading to Thionville. A circular wooden palisade was built around this crossing, which could provide protection to the farmers of the region in case of danger. Not far from this, on the Bock promontory, was the small Roman fortification Lucilinburhuc ‚Äì this name later turned into L√ºtzelburg, and later still into Luxembourg. After the Romans had left, the fortification fell into disrepair, until in 963 Count Siegfried of the House of Ardennes, acquired the land in exchange for his territories in Feulen near Ettelbr√ºck from St. Maximin's Abbey in Trier. On the Bock promontory, he built a small castle, which was connected to the plateau through a drawbridge. In time, a settlement grew on the plateau. Knights and soldiers were billeted here on the rocky outcrop, while artisans and traders settled in the area beneath it, creating the long-standing social distinction between the upper and the lower city. The settlement had grown to a city by the 12th century, when it was protected by a city wall adjacent to the current Rue du Foss√©. In the 14th century, a second city wall was built, which also incorporated the land of the Rham Plateau. A third one later incorporated the urban area as far as today's Boulevard Royal.\\"History of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg\\" , Grand Duch√© de Luxembourg. Retrieved 29 October 2013. =Development and use as fortress= The reinforcement of the fortifications which had begun in 1320 under John the Blind continued until the end of the 14th century. In 1443 Philip the Good and his Burgundian troops took the city in a surprise attack by night. This started a period of foreign occupation for Luxembourg, which had been elevated from a County to a Duchy in 1354. Integrated into the territory of the Netherlands, it would be drawn into the duel between Valois- Bourbons and Habsburgs over the next few centuries, and was ruled by the Burgundians, the French, and the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs. During this time the fortress was continually expanded and extended, and fitted to the military requirements of the day. The casemates, constructed by the Spanish and Austrians, are of particular note.\\"Du ch√¢teau √† la forteresse\\", Ville de Luxembourg. (in French) Retrieved 29 October 2013. By marriage, the fortress passed in 1447 to the Austrian Habsburgs along with all Burgundian possessions. In 1542, the French troops of Francis I took the fortress, which was soon retaken by troops of the Holy Roman Empire. Around 1545, Italian and Dutch engineers under Holy Roman Emperor Charles V built the first bastions, linked by curtain walls, on the site of the current Boulevard Roosevelt and Boulevard Royal. The ditch was enlarged from 13 to 31 metres. Ravelins were also added. =Spanish occupation= Later, when the Spanish occupied the city, the aggressive policy of French King Louis XIV from 1670 led to the construction of additional fortifications. With a French attack seeming imminent, the Spanish engineer Louvigny constructed several fortified towers in front of the Glacis from 1672, such as the Redoubts Peter, Louvigny, Marie and Berlaimont; he also built the first barracks in the city. This formed a second line of defence around the city. Louvigny also envisaged constructing works on the other side of the P√©trusse and Alzette valleys, but the Spaniards lacked the funds for this. He had, however, anticipated what the French would do after 1684. =Expansion under Vauban= The Bock After the successful siege by Louis XIV in 1683-1684, French troops regained the fortress under the renowned commander and military engineer S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban. From 1684 to 1688, Vauban immediately started a massive re-building and expansion project for the fortifications, using more than 3,000 men. Advance fortifications were placed on the heights around the city: the crownwork on Niedergr√ºnewald, the hornwork on Obergr√ºnewald, the \\"Cornichon de Verlorenkost\\", the Fort Bourbon and several redoubts. He greatly expanded the military's hold over the urban space by integrating Pfaffenthal into the defences, and large barracks were built on the Rham and Saint-Esprit plateaux. After the War of the Spanish Succession and the Peace of Ryswick, the fortress came under Spanish control from 1698,\\"Treaty of Ryswick\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1911. then passed to French administration again in 1701. =Austrian period= After the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the Dutch replaced the French for two years, after which Austrian troops regained it in 1715, remaining there for 80 years. The fortress of Luxembourg now formed one of the main strategic pillars in the defence of the Austrian Netherlands against French expansion. For this reason, Vauban's fortifications were reinforced and extended. It was under Charles VI and Maria Theresa that the fortress expanded the most in terms of surface area: the Austrian engineers added lunettes and several exterior forts (Olizy, Th√ºngen, Rubamprez, Rumigny, Neipperg, Wallis, Rheinsheim, Charles), closed off the valley with locks, and dug casemates into the rock. The fortress now had a triple line of defences on all sides. =French Revolution and Prussian garrison= After an 11-month blockade, the city of Luxembourg was taken by French Revolutionary troops in 1795. The Duchy of Luxembourg was now integrated as the \\"D√©partement des For√™ts\\" into the French Republic and later the French Empire. In 1815, after Napoleon's final defeat, the Congress of Vienna elevated Luxembourg to a Grand Duchy, now ruled in personal union by the King of the Netherlands. At the same time, Luxembourg became a member of the German Confederation, and the Luxembourgish fortress became a \\"federal fortress\\". To this effect, the Dutch King-Grand Duke essentially agreed to share responsibility for the fortress with Prussia, one of two major German powers. While the Dutch King remained fully sovereign, Prussia received the right to appoint the fortress governor, and the garrison would be made up of 1/4 Dutch troops and 3/4 Prussian troops.Engelhardt, Friedrich Wilhelm. Geschichte der Stadt und Festung Luxemburg: Seit ihrer ersten Entstehung bis auf unsere Tage. Luxembourg: Rehm, 1830. p. 284-285 As a result, until 1867 around 4,000 Prussian officers, NCOs and men were stationed amongst a community of about 10,000 civilian residents. The fortress had already been garrisoned by Prussia since 8 July 1814, before the Congress of Vienna.Mus√©e d'Histoire de la Ville de Luxembourg (ed.). Das Leben in der Bundesfestung Luxemburg (1815-1867). Luxembourg: Imprimerie Centrale, 1993. The Prussians modernised the existing defences and added yet more advance forts, Fort Wedell and Fort Dumoulin. There were even plans to build a fourth line of defences, several kilometres from the city, to keep potential attackers even further at bay. This was not to take place, however. Officially, the Prussian garrison in Luxembourg operated as an instrument of the German Confederation. Yet since Austria, the other major German power, had given up its possessions in the Low Countries, Prussia had taken over the defence of the Western German states, and it was able to defend its own geopolitical interests as well as those of the Confederation. The timeline of its occupation of the fortress shows that Prussia was advancing its own agenda: it occupied the Luxembourg Fortress from 8 July 1814, before the Congress of Vienna had made it a federal fortress on 9 June 1815, and before the German Confederation even existed. Only after 11 years of the Prussian garrison was the fortress formally taken over by the Confederation on 13 March 1826, and it was not until one year after the Confederation dissolved (in 1866) that Prussian troops left the fortress, on 9 September 1867. Whether it was a federal fortress or not, Luxembourg was \\"the most Westerly bulwark of Prussia\\". According to Article 5 of the military convention signed in Frankfurt am Main on 8 November 1816 between the Kings of the Netherlands and of Prussia, the Fortress of Luxembourg was to be garrisoned by 1/4 Dutch troops and 3/4 Prussian troops. Article 9 stipulated that in times of peace the garrison should number 6,000 men, though this was temporarily lowered to 4,000 as the Allies were occupying France. In practice, the level of 6,000 men was never reached. In fact, the garrison consisted exclusively of Prussian troops: the Netherlands never provided their one-quarter of the garrison. Later, the Luxembourg-Prussian Treaty of 17 November 1856 gave Prussia the exclusive right to garrison troops in Luxembourg. In the 1830, the southern provinces of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands broke off to form the Kingdom of Belgium. At the outbreak of this Belgian Revolution, most Luxembourgers joined the rebels, and from 1830 to 1839 almost all of Luxembourg was administered as part of Belgium. The fortress and city of Luxembourg, held by the Dutch and Prussian troops, was the only part of the country still loyal to the Dutch King William I. The stand-off was resolved in 1839, when the Treaty of London awarded the western part of Luxembourg to Belgium, while the rest (including the fortress) remained under William I.Fyffe, Charles Alan.

Retrieved 1 November 2013. = Luxembourg crisis and demolition = \\"Huelen Zant\\" (Hollow tooth), the remains a tower of one of the fortress gates, on the Bock rock. During the demolition works, after 1871, the tower was only half destroyed and transformed to look like the ruins of a medieval castle.After the Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the German Confederation was dissolved. In its place, under Prussian leadership, the North German Confederation was founded, which did not include Luxembourg. Nevertheless, Prussian troops remained in the fortress. Before the war, the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck had signalled to the French government of Napoleon III that Prussia would not object to French hegemony in Luxembourg, if France stayed out of Prussia's conflict with Austria, to which Napoleon agreed. After the war, the French offered King William III 5,000,000 guilder for his personal possession of Luxembourg, which the cash-strapped Dutch monarch accepted in March 1867. Prussian objections to what was now portrayed as French expansionism provoked the Luxembourg Crisis, and the threat of a war between the major powers was averted only by the London Conference and the Second Treaty of London. This declared Luxembourg to be a neutral state, and required the fortress to be torn down, and the Prussian garrison to leave within three months. Prussian troops finally left on 9 September 1867. Generally, it was usual for decommissioned fortresses to pass into the ownership of the cities concerned. In Luxembourg, however, an eagerness to comply with the Treaty of London and a fear of being caught up in a future Franco-German war caused the government to undertake the project on behalf of the city. The sale of the land of the fortress would fund the costs of demolition and of the urban development of the city. An international commission inspected the demolition work in 1883, bringing to light the government's inexperience with such work. The state had to decide between \\"keeping everything\\" and \\"razing everything\\". Military defensive works had to be interrupted by roads; military remains converted into cellars or warehouses had to be destroyed.Philippart, Robert. \\"La Ville de Luxembourg: De la ville forteresse √† la ville ouverte entre 1867 et 1920.\\" (in French) In:Emile Haag. Une r√©ussite originale - Le Luxembourg au fil des si√®cles. Luxembourg: Binsfeld, 2011. The demolition of the fortress, with its casemates, batteries, barracks, and so on, took 16 years, from 1867 to 1883, and cost 1.5 million francs. The process was somewhat chaotic: often parts of the fortress were simply blown up, the usable materials carried off by local residents, and the rest was covered up with earth. Social concerns were not absent from the enterprise. The old barracks served as lodgings for the workers employed in the demolition work. No qualification was required to participate in this work: during times of economic downturn, additional demolition projects on the fortress gave work to the unemployed. The dismantling became a grandiose spectacle, and a celebration of new technologies and ambitious projects. Some buildings, however, were preserved for future generations (see below). Luxembourg achieved full independence in 1890 after the death of the Dutch king William III. He was succeeded in the Netherlands by his daughter Wilhelmina but as the succession laws of Luxembourg allowed only male heirs, the personal union came to an end. The Luxembourgers chose the German Duke Adolphe of the House of Nassau-Weilburg as their Grand Duke. =Expansion of the city= This demolition work, which might be seen today as the destruction of a historic monument, was seen at the time as an act of liberation. The fortress was the very visible symbol of foreign domination, and additionally the various masters of the fortress forbade the building of new houses, so as not to influence the defensive military strategy at the heart of the fortress. When the corset of the fortifications had disappeared, the city could expand for the first time since the 14th century. In the West the Boulevard Royal was built, adjacent to the Municipal Park. In the south, the new Adolphe Bridge opened up the Bourbon Plateau for development, with its Avenue de la Libert√©. Here, a harmonious blend of houses, imposing edifices (the Banque et Caisse d'√âpargne de l'√âtat, the ARBED building, the central railway station) and squares such as the Place de Paris were built. Additionally, the residential quarters of Limpertsberg and Belair were created. Layout In its final form, the fortress of Luxembourg consisted of three fortress walls, taking up about at a time when the city covered only . Inside, there were a large number of bastions, with 15 forts in the centre, and another nine on the outside. A web of of underground passages (casemates) connected over of bomb-proof space. The epithet \\"Gibraltar of the North\\" compared the fortified city to the impregnable rock of Gibraltar. The fortress of Luxembourg was in fact never taken by force: in 1443, Philip the Good had taken it without opposition while subsequently the fortress was taken by siege leading to starvation. The state of the fortress as of 1867 was as follows, in clockwise order: the Gr√ºnewald Front, facing north-east; the Trier Front, facing east; the Thionville Front, facing south, and the Longwy Front, facing west and north. These contained the following works: ;Gr√ºnewald Front * Interior works: ** Fort Berlaimont ** Chanclos Battery ** 3 Pigeons Battery ** Government Bastion ** Castle Bastion ** Altm√ºnster Battery * Exterior works ** Fort Niedergr√ºnewald ** Fort Obergr√ºnewald ** Weimershof Battery ** Malakoff Tower * Detached works ** Fort Olizy ** Fort Th√ºngen ** Fort Parkh√∂he ;Trier Front * Interior works ** Bock fortifications ** Altm√ºnster Battery ** Holy Ghost Citadel * Exterior works ** Rham fortifications ** Redoubt Beamont * Detached works ** Fort Parkh√∂he ** Fort Dumoulin ** Fort Rubamprez ** Fort Rumigny ;Thionville Front * Interior works ** Holy Ghost Citadel ** Bastion Louis ** Bastion Beck ** Bastion Jost * Exterior works ** Fort Verlorenkost ** Railway Battery ** Fort Wallis ** Fort Bourbon ** Thionville Overhang ** Fort Elisabeth ** Fort Peter * Detached works ** Fort Neipperg ** Fort Wedell ** Fort Rheinsheim ;Longwy Front * Interior works ** Bastion Jost ** Bastion Camus ** Bastion Marie ** New gate fortifications ** Bastion Berlaimont * Exterior works ** Fort Peter ** Lampert Battery ** Fort Lampert ** Fort Louvigny ** Fort Vauban ** Fort Marie ** Fort Royal **Ravelins I‚ÄìVI * Detached works ** Fort Rheinsheim ** Fort Daun ** Fort Charles ** Redoubt Marlborough =Land usage= Map of the fortress (Bundeswehr Military History Museum) In the Middle Ages, Luxembourg had been a relatively open city, with easy access through 23 gates. The ramparts delimited the urban space but allowed both people and goods to move between the town and the countryside without hindrance. This changed drastically from the mid-16th century, when fortifications cut the city off from the surrounding area.Thewes, Guy. \\"Le ¬´grand renfermement¬ª: La ville √† l'√¢ge de la forteresse.\\" (in French) Ons Stad, No. 99, 2012. p. 10-13 The defensive buildings, spread out over a large distance, rendered access to the city increasingly difficult: the fortress became a straitjacket for its inhabitants. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the gaps in the old medieval defences were closed off. The Marie gate was buried under Bastion Marie in 1548. The Lampert, Orvis, Beckerich and Jost gates disappeared in the early 17th century under the Berlaimont, Louis, Beck and Jost bastions. The military logic behind the need for an inaccessible fortress contrasted with that in favour of a merchant city, open to the outside. The 1644 closure of the Jews' gate, the city's main access from the West which had facilitated trade with the Netherlands, was a key date in this process. Traffic was obliged to bypass the plain, and enter by the New Gate (Porte-Neuve) built from 1626 to 1636. A traveller coming from France now had to descend into the Grund and come up through the Fishmarket, passing through several gates on the way. The Spanish government fully recognised that sealing off the city would stifle the economy and result in depopulation at a time when large numbers of civilians were needed to provide for the supply and lodging of the troops. Louvigny in 1671 drew up plans for a new gate on the rue Philippe and a bridge over the P√©trusse valley, both of which would have brought about a considerable increase in trade and transportation. The plans, however, were never realized, probably owing to lack of funds. The fortress also came to be encircled by a kind of no man's land: the Austrians introduced a security perimeter in 1749, inside of which no permanent construction was allowed. This was in order to keep a clear field of fire, to keep the view unobstructed, and so as not to provide cover to attackers. Under the Prussians, the perimeter was extended to from the external lines of fortification. Luxembourg's first railway station, built in 1859 on the Plateau Bourbon, fell within the perimeter, and therefore had to be constructed out of wood. The growth of the fortress also meant the loss of agricultural land: from the Middle Ages, gardens, orchards, fields and meadows had formed a green belt around the city, and these disappeared progressively to make way for fortifications. The urban population, however, depended on this area for the city's supply of vegetables, fruit and fodder. The swallowing-up of agricultural fields accelerated when the Austrians extended the Glacis. Commander Neipperg had the earth removed down to the rock, a distance of from the fortress, so that attackers laying siege would have no opportunity to dig trenches. The rocky desert that surrounded the city was now called the \\"bare fields\\" (champs pel√©s). Expropriations of land were often executed without discussion: the military would invoke the threat of war and a state of emergency, seizing plots of land without any compensation. In 1744, the garrison confiscated a plot of land close to the Eich gate in order to extend the defences. This land, and its garden of 48 fruit trees, belonged to three orphaned sisters, aged 9, 15 and 20, for whom the orchard was the only means of subsistence. The confiscation plunged them into destitution: when the soldiers chopped down the trees and the girls attempted to at least collect the firewood, they were chased off. It was not until the late 18th century that the authorities changed their attitude: the government in Brussels decided that compensation should be paid for confiscated property. The Austrians started to compensate for the previous decades' injustices by making payments to those who had been expropriated, or to their descendants. Military rule Entering or exiting the city meant passing under the watchful eye of the soldiers on guard duty. At dusk, the gates would be shut, not to be re-opened until sunrise. Fear of an attack was not the only reason for closing the gates at night. In fact, for extended periods, especially in the late 18th century, there was little likelihood of being attacked. Yet even in times of good relations with the neighbouring French, the doors were shut: above all the military authorities feared their troops deserting. This was a constant plague for the Austrian army, as for all Ancien R√©gime garrisons. Each year, a tenth of the troops would be lost to desertion, often escaping under the cover of darkness. In 1765, barbed wire was placed on the ramparts, to make night-time escapes more difficult. Paradoxically, the gate closure became more a matter of keeping the garrison inside than of protecting the city itself. However, those still outside the walls would have to hurry home when they heard the Zapestreech‚Äîsignalling the imminent gate closure‚Äîif they wanted to avoid being locked out for the night. The Luxembourgish legend of Saint Nicholas (see below) refers to this. =Living conditions and relations between garrison and inhabitants = Lodging among civilians Cliff battery on the Rham plateau In 1787, the citizens of Luxembourg stated in a petition that they had \\"the sad privilege of living in a fortress, a privilege that is inseparable from the lodging of soldiers\\". Living in a fortress city had serious disadvantages: the ramparts set serious limits on the amount of space available while the inhabitants had to share this small area with large numbers of troops. The further back one goes in history, the more difficult it is to locate exact numbers of both inhabitants and garrisoned soldiers.Thewes, Guy. \\"Le logement des soldats dans la forteresse de Luxembourg.\\" (in French) Ons Stad, No. 102, 2013. p. 14-17 For the Spanish period, in 1684 the Prince of Chimay had 2,600 soldiers under his command (1,700 infantry and 900 cavalry). The military population was not limited to troops: many soldiers and officers also had wives and children. In 1655, in the upper town alone, a third of the 660 soldiers were listed as married, and about half of these families had children. Then there were also the servants employed by the officers. The total military population of the upper town was therefore 1,170, almost twice as many as the number of actual troops. Under the Austrian occupation, some 2,700 troops were stationed in the fortress in 1722, as compared to 4,400 in 1741 and 3,700 in 1790. In times of crisis or war, the garrison might be increased dramatically, as in 1727-1732 when the Austrians feared a French attack and 10,000 soldiers were stationed inside the fortress or in camps in the surroundings (while the civilian population was only 8,000). In the 19th century, there were 4,000 Prussian troops garrisoned in a city of about 10,000-13,000 residents. All of these had to be housed somewhere. Until 1672, when the first barracks were constructed, all officers, troops, and their wives and children, lived with the civilian inhabitants, leading to drastic overpopulation. A magistrate in 1679 noted that there were only 290 houses in the city, many of them tiny, owned by poor artisans with large families. These people, who barely eked out a living from one week to the next, only just had enough beds to sleep in themselves, never mind providing accommodation for a large number of soldiers who were \\"crammed one on top of the other, experiencing first-hand the poverty and misery of their landlords\\". The military's lists of billets give an idea of the cramped conditions in which troops and civilians co-existed: the butcher Jacques Nehr (listed in 1681) had a wife and five children. A room on the first floor of his house contained two married sergeants and three children. A second room housed a married soldier with his child, two gunners, and an infantryman. A dragoon lived above the stables. This was not an isolated case, and the justiciar and aldermen (√©chevins) repeatedly protested to the government about the intolerable living arrangements. Living in such close proximity caused numerous frictions between soldiers and residents. In 1679, a magistrate complained that citizens had to give over \\"three, four, five or six beds, along with linen and blankets\\" to \\"soldiers who were most often violent, drunk, and difficult, who mistreated them [...] stole their linen and furniture, and chased them from their own homes\\". Ruffian soldiers would come home at night drunk, leaving the house doors open being noisy. The Spanish troops were apparently particularly undisciplined. When lodging in barracks was introduced, discipline improved considerably, though conflicts with residents did not disappear entirely. In the 18th century, there were still examples of Austrian officers who moved into rooms more spacious than the ones they had been assigned; others would bring girls of low repute to their house at night, to the alarm of their civilian landlords. This was all the more galling given that, under the Spaniards and Austrians, the city's inhabitants received no compensation for all this: they were to provide housing to the soldiers free of charge. The government claimed that since the garrison's presence brought trade and business which benefited the city's merchants and artisans, it was only fair for citizens to contribute by lodging the troops. Nor was the burden of quartering troops shared equally, by any means: there were many exemptions, reflecting the social inequality of the Ancien R√©gime society. The justiciar, the aldermen, lawyers, members of the provincial council, and the nobility were exempt. The magistrates assigned soldiers to houses, and to this effect made lists with very detailed descriptions of houses' interiors. Abuses of power could not be prevented: the authorities were known to assign an excessive number of soldiers to the houses of residents who had been involved in disputes with the city. Citizens tried to wriggle out of these obligations by deliberately not keeping all rooms in their house fit for habitation; the wealthier inhabitants were able to avoid taking in soldiers by paying their way out. Introduction of barracks Casemates inside the Bock promontory Purpose-built military accommodation was built in Luxembourg from 1672 onwards, with the barracks of Piquet and Porte- Neuve, as well as some huts on the Rham and Saint-Esprit plateaux. The barracks were enlarged and multiplied by Vauban after 1684, and by the Austrians and Prussians over the next two centuries. In 1774, the six barracks housed 7,900 troops, while the military hospital in Pfaffenthal had room for another 200 men. From the late 17th century, it became the norm for troops to reside in barracks; officers, on the other hand, continued to be quartered among civilians right up until the fortress's demolition in 1867. Even in Prussian times in the 19th century, most officers rented a room with their \\"servis\\", their accommodation allowance: as a result, the house-owners could at least receive payment. By this point, under the Prussian garrison, most of the soldiers were only in Luxembourg for short periods in connection with their military service. The aristocratic officers, on the other hand, were under strict social rules, and therefore intermarriages between the civilian population and the garrison soldiers were uncommon, except for non- commissioned officers, who were career soldiers. There was a love-hate relationship between inhabitants and garrison: on the one hand, there was jealousy over the soldiers' exemption from certain taxes and levies; on the other, the soldiers spent their wages in the city, and many businessmen and shopkeepers depended on the military for their livelihood, as did the craftsmen and day labourers who worked on improving or repairing the fortifications.Jungblut, Marie-Paule. \\"Das Leben in der Bundesfestung Luxemburg 1815-1867.\\" (in German) Ons Stad, No. 43, 1993. p. 6-7 Both groups suffered the same poor living conditions in the city, such as the lack of a clean water supply and of sanitation, leading to outbreaks of cholera and typhus. The barracks were so cramped that often two soldiers had to share a bed; the officers, quartered in the houses of the upper classes, did not experience such problems. Among the inhabitants, there was similar stratification: there was a marked difference between the dark, cramped housing of the poor in the lower town and the fine accommodation enjoyed by the rich who lived in housing in the upper town built by the nobility or the clergy. =Animals= The heavily reconstructed Fort Th√ºngen (\\"Three Acorns\\") Animals were indispensable in order to maintain and run a fortress, and to feed its garrison. Riding horses, draught horses and workhorses were required while cattle, sheep or other animals were needed for slaughter.Bruns, Andr√©. \\"Tiere in der Festung.\\" (in German) Ons Stad, No. 97, 2011. p. 48-49 In 1814, the ground floors of the Rham Barracks, the Maria Theresa Barracks, and the riding barracks were renovated for use as stables. Out of the five storage buildings for grain and flour which had been built by 1795, the one in the upper town was used as a stable. Together, these had a capacity of 386 horses. By late 1819, the artillery required a new riding arena to train a large number of new horses that were being delivered. For this, they wanted to use the garden of an old monastery on the Saint-Esprit Plateau. By 1835, an indoor riding arena in the lower yard of the plateau had been completed. This had enough room to train a squadron, and in war time could be used as a livestock shed or as a fodder store. Apart from the riding horses of the cavalry detachment and officers, a large number of draught horses belonged to the artillery and military engineers for ensuring supplies. In case of emergency or when large-scale transport was necessary, contracts were signed with private haulage companies. The mill in the Cavalier Camus alone, which made enough flour daily for 1,500 portions of bread, required 24 horses to operate. Horsed units of artillery were ready for the rapid reinforcement of endangered fortress sections or to support a breakout. In 1859, Luxembourg had eight horse guns with 38 horses. There was also a need for additional horses to transport ammunition, as well as for riding and as reserves. Storage space for the animals' fodder had to be found. Oats were stored in the remaining churches after 1814. Straw posed a problem, due to the danger of its catching fire. It was to be stored either in the trenches of the Front of the plain, in Pfaffenthal, or in the lower quarters of the Grund and Clausen. The livestock intended for slaughter were to be accommodated among the inhabitants, with the gardens in the Grund and Pfaffenthal being reserved for cattle. Animals could also be a source of income for the military: already under the French, the fortress authorities sold off the grazing rights on the grassy areas of the Glacis. Due to lax supervision of grazing, however, by 1814, some of the folds were no longer recognisable as such. Legacy =Remains and later use= View from the casemates Parts of the fortress were not destroyed, but simply rendered unfit for military use. Many old walls and towers still survive, and still heavily influence the view of the city. Some of the remaining elements of the fortress are the Bock promontory,\\"Bock Promontory\\".

Three boys were playing outside, and were far away from the city when the curfew was sounded: it was too late for them to return home. They sought refuge with a butcher who lived outside the city. At night-time, however, the butcher killed them to turn them into aspic. Luckily, a few days later, Saint Nicholas also found himself shut out of the city, and went to the same butcher's house. He found the children, and was able to bring them back to life. Jean Racine, the famous French dramatist, was in Luxembourg in 1687 as the historiographer of Louis XIV and inspector of the fortress.\\"Arts et culture au Luxembourg: Une culture ouverte sur le monde.\\" Service information et presse du gouvernement luxembourgeois, 2009. There are several elaborate maps and views of the fortress made before 1700. In 1598, Georg Braun and Franz Hogenberg published the oldest known view of Luxembourg City, a copper engraving that appeared in Civitates orbis terrarum (Cologne, 1598). Half a century later, the Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu, drawing on Braun's work, published his \\"Luxemburgum\\" in the second volume of his Stedeboek (Amsterdam, 1649). Van der Meulen provides another view of Luxembourg from Limpertsberg where he depicts French troops taking the city in 1649.Mersch, Jacques. \\"Luxembourg: vues ancienne\\". Luxembourg: Editions Paul Bruck, 1977. (in French) In more modern times, the British Romantic landscape artist J. M. W. Turner (1775-1851) painted several scenes of the fortress, both paintings and sketches, after visiting in 1824 and 1839. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe visited the city in 1792, and left a number of sketches of the fortress. Christoph Wilhelm Selig, a member of the Hessian garrison (1814-1815), painted several watercolours. Later, the fortress served as a model for the Luxembourgers Michel Engels and Nicolas Liez and Jean-Baptiste Fresez. Even after the dismantling of (most of) the fortifications in 1867, the spectacular remains have still been used as motifs by artists such as Joseph Kutter or Sosth√®ne Weis.

Early life and education James G. Fulton was born in Dormont, Pennsylvania. He attended the Fine Arts Department of the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Pennsylvania State College at State College, Pennsylvania in 1924 and from Harvard Law School as a Doctor of Laws in 1927. He was a member of the Allegheny County Board of Law Examiners from 1934 to 1942. He served in the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1939 and 1940. He was solicitor for Dormont Borough in 1942. He worked as publisher of the Mount Lebanon News and several other newspapers. He was a member of the American Judicature Society, United World Federalists, American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars. =Military service= During the Second World War he enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve in 1942 and served in the South Pacific as a lieutenant until discharged in 1945. United States House of Representatives Representative Fulton and other members of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics visit the Marshall Space Flight Center on March 9, 1962 to gather first-hand information of the nation's space exploration program. In 1944, while still in the service, Fulton was elected as a Republican to the 79th United States Congress, and reelected to the 13 succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1945, until his death from a heart attack in Washington, D.C. on October 6, 1971. While in Congress he was delegated to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment at Havana in 1947 and 1948, and to the 14th General Assembly of United Nations in 1959. He was a delegate to 1956 Republican National Convention. In addition he served as an adviser on space to the United States Mission at the United Nations from 1960 to 1969. Fulton voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. =Space Shuttle= Fulton is credited with saving the Space Shuttle program.

In life, members of the genus would have looked something like a kinkajou or binturong, though they were not closely related to any living mammal. Well preserved fossils allow clear information on what they looked like. They were about long including a long, robust tail, which may or may not have been prehensile. Other features include a light build, weighing approximately 7 kg (15 lb), and many adaptations typical of animals that live in trees. These include walking on the soles of their five-toed feet, and having long, curved, compressed claws. The powerfully built limbs had flexible joints, especially the ankles, an adaptation that allows an animal to turn its hind feet behind it, like modern tree squirrels, in order to climb downward. They were probably omnivores, eating fruit, eggs, insects and small mammals. Analysis of casts of the brain and inner ear from Chriacus pelvidens and C. baldwini suggest these animals depended more on their sense of smell than sight, may have been able to hear about as well as a modern aardvark, and were slow-moving to moderately agile. The encephalization quotient (EQ) had a range of 0.12‚Äì0.41 (1.0=average brain size compared with modern mammals of a similar body size) and the neocortex was less developed than later mammals. By the standards of modern mammals, they would have been neither especially quick nor intelligent, but their brains were comparable to many mammals of their time. Derived features of the inner ear were shared with fossils that are assigned to Euungulata (artiodactyls+perissodactyls), suggesting the genus may be close to the origin of ungulates, though it is too different in form to be a direct ancestor.  Classification  There are nine species currently recognized in the genus. Like most early placental mammals, the classification of Chriacus in relation to other groups is disputed. Halliday et al. (2015) consider it a member of the family Oxyclaenidae, a sister group to Palaeoryctids and Creodonts, while Tabuce et al. (2011) classify it as an arctocyonid, most closely related to Loxolophus, then Arctocyon, and allied to the mesonychids. This difference mirrors the history of the mammals classified as arctocyonids. They were first considered creodonts (imagined to be the ancestors of modern carnivores), and then \\"condylarths,\\" (imagined to be the ancestors of hoofed mammals). Modern studies suggest the confusion is due to the fact that ungulates, carnivores, and creodonts are related groups, and flesh-eating lineages and adaptations evolved within each of them. Chriacus lies somewhere within the range of their early relatives.

The purpose of GAYA is similar to that of GWA itself: to recognize and acknowledge Georgia's wealth of outstanding writers and to acquaint them with the public and one another, thus continuing the literary heritage. GWA was established in 1964 by the founders of the Dixie Council of Authors and Journalists. In 1984, that organization became the Council of Authors and Journalists (CAJ). Ten years later in 1994, the CAJ had diminished, having lost its drive and its leadership. Five months after GWA was created, responsibility for GAYA was accepted as an integral part. GAYA has the distinction of being the oldest literary award in the Southeastern United States while reflecting the current publishing world. =Yearly award winners= *Georgia Author of the Year Awards 1997 *Georgia Author of the Year Awards 2004 * Archive of Winners * Pamela Jackson - 2006 winner See also * Literature of Georgia (U.S. state) External links * Georgia Writers Association homepage * Georgia Author of the Year Awards * Red Clay Writers Conference Category:American literary awards Category:American writers' organizations Category:Non-profit organizations based in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Kennesaw State University ","title":"Georgia Writers Association"},{"id":"5651793","text":"MKB may refer to:  Business  * MKB Bank, the third-biggest commercial bank in Hungary * MKB Raduga, a Russian aerospace company * MKB Fakel, a Russian government-owned aerospace defense corporation Community *Moogooru Karnataka Brahmin, a sect of Kannada speaking Smartha Brahmins and follow Advaita Vedanta *MKB Nagar, residential locality in northern part of the metropolitan city of Chennai, Tamil Nadu state, India * MKB Veszpr√©m, a handball club from Hungary *M.

Together with Josef Frank he was instrumental in creating the distinctive character of the Wiener Schule der Architektur (\\"Vienna School of Architecture\\"). He stood for a modern concept of \\"living\\" for all people, planned and built private dwelling-houses, designed furniture, created ceramics and watercolours and designed sets and props for stage plays and films. Biography Grave of Strnad at Vienna Central Cemetery Strnad was born in Vienna on 26 October 1879 into a family of Jewish descent.Architekturzentrum Wien Architektenlexikon From 1909 to 1935 he was a professor in the Wiener Kunstgewerbeschule (\\"School of Applied Arts in Vienna\\") along with Josef Hoffmann. From 1918 he created designs for a \\"round theatre\\" (Rundtheater) in collaboration with his pupil Margarete Lihotzky (later Margarete Sch√ºtte-Lihotzky). Among his other pupils were the later film architects and set designers Artur Berger and Harry Horner. In 1923 Strnad constructed the Drei-Szenen-Theater (\\"three-scene- theatre\\"), a three-part stage within a circular auditorium. From 1919 he was stage designer for the Wiener Volkstheater. Later Strnad designed many highly acclaimed sets for the Wiener Staatsoper, including sets for Berg's Wozzeck and for the premiere of Jonny spielt auf by Ernst Krenek. He also designed interiors for the lavish masterpieces of the \\"Wiener Film\\" such as Maskerade (1934) and Episode (1935). He died in Bad Aussee on 3 September 1935.

Coryphodon was a pantodont, a member of the world's first group of large browsing mammals. It migrated across what is now northern North America, replacing Barylambda, an earlier pantodont. It is regarded as the ancestor of the genus Hypercoryphodon of Late Eocene Mongolia. Coryphodon is known from many specimens in North America and considerably fewer in Europe, Mongolia, and China. It is a small to medium-sized coryphodontid who differs from other members of the family in dental characteristics. Description Restoration by Heinrich Harder At about at shoulder height and in body length, Coryphodon is one of the largest- known mammals of its time. The creature was very slow, with long upper limbs and short lower limbs, which were needed to support its weight. Coryphodon does not seem to have been in need of much in the way of defences, however, since most known predators of the time seem to have been much smaller than Coryphodon. Coryphodon had one of the smallest brain/body ratios of any mammal, living or extinct, possessing a brain weighing just and a body weight of around . Estimates of Coryphodon's body mass have varied considerably. Based on a regression analysis of ungulates, estimated the mean body mass for the type species C. eocaenus to , for C. radians, and possibly as much as for C. proterus and C. lobatus. Taxonomy and systematics Since the first fossil was found in Wyoming, the taxonomy of Coryphodon and its family have been in disarray ‚Äì five described genera have been synonymized with Coryphodon and thirty-five proposed species have been declared invalid. =Species= C. lobatus skull Coryphodon skull * C. anax was named by Cope (1882); it was synonymized with Coryphodon lobatus by Osborn (1898) and Uhen and Gingerich (1995). * C. anthracoideus was named by de Blainville (1846). * C. armatus was named by Cope (1872). * C. dabuensis was named by Zhai (1978). * C. eocaenus was named by Owen (1846); it was reassigned to Lophiodon eocaenum by Blainville (1846); it was revalidated by Cope (1877), Lucas (1984) and Uhen and Gingerich (1995). * C. gosseleti (=C. grosseleti [lapsus calami?]) was named by Malaquin (1899). * C. hamatus was named by Marsh (1876); it was synonymized with Coryphodon anthracoideus by Lucas (1984) and Lucas and Schoch (1990); it was synonymized with Coryphodon radians by Uhen and Gingerich (1995). * C. lobatus was named by Cope (1877). * C. marginatus was named by Cope (1882); it was synonymized with Coryphodon eocaenus by Lucas (1984) and Uhen and Gingerich (1995). * C. oweni was named by Hebert (1856). * C. pisuqti * C. proterus was named by Simons (1960). * C. repandus was named by Cope (1882); it was synonymized with Coryphodon radians by Uhen and Gingerich (1995). * C. radians was named by Cope (1872). * C. singularis? was named by Osborn (1898); it is a nomen dubium due pathology. * C. subquadratus? was named by Cope (1882); it was synonymized with Manteodon. * C. tsaganensis was named by Reshetov (1976) * C. ventanus was named by Osborn (1898); it was synonymized with Coryphodon lobatus by Uhen and Gingerich (1995). =Synonyms= Skull of C. elephantopus * Bathmodon radians was named by Cope (1872); it was synonymized with Coryphodon anthracoideus by Lucas (1998b); it was reassigned to Coryphodon radians by Cope (1877), Simpson (1948a), Simpson (1951), Simpson (1981) and Uhen and Gingerich (1995). * Bathmodon semicinctus was named by Cope (1872); it was reassigned to Loxolophodon semicinctus by Cope (1872); it was revalidated by Cope (1873); it was reassigned to Coryphodon semicinctus by Wheeler (1961); it was synonymized with Coryphodon radians by Gazin (1962); it was considered a nomen dubium by Uhen and Gingerich (1995). * Ectacodon cinctus was named by Cope (1882); it was reassigned to Coryphodon cinctus by Osborn (1898); it was synonymized with Coryphodon radians by Uhen and Gingerich (1995). * Letalophodon? * Loxolophodon? was named by Cope, (1872) * Manteodon subquadratus was named by Cope (1882); it was reassigned to Coryphodon subquadratus by Lucas (1984); it was synonymized with Coryphodon radians by Uhen and Gingerich (1995). * Metalophodon testis was named by Cope (1882); it was reassigned to Coryphodon testis by Osborn (1898); it was synonymized with Coryphodon radians by Uhen and Gingerich (1995). =Size evolution= Coryphodon evolved from the Late Paleocene C. proterus, one of the largest species found and the only one known from the Clarkforkian NALMA. The body size then decreased until C. eocaenus appears at the Clarkforkian-Wasatchian transition (55.4 Ma, near the PETM), from where Coryphodon evolved into the large species C. radians. C. radians in its turn evolved into two contemporaneous species that appear in the Early Eocene, the small C. armatus and the very large C. lobatus. These changes in size are thought to be linked to global climate change, with the size minimum in the Coryphodon lineage occurring shortly after Paleocene-Eocene boundary. Paleobiology Individual walking towards a swamp, Robert Bruce Horsfall Restoration by Charles R. Knight =Feeding and diet= Coryphodon had a semi- aquatic lifestyle, likely living in swamps and marshes like a hippopotamus, although it was not closely related to modern hippos or any other animal known today. Coryphodon had very strong neck muscles and short tusks that were probably used to uproot swamp plants. The other teeth in the mouth were suited for processing plants that had been grabbed by browsing. Fossils found on Ellesmere Island, near Greenland, show that Coryphodon once lived there in warm swamp forests of huge trees, similar to the modern cypress swamps of the American South. Though the climate of the Eocene was much warmer than today, plants and animals living north of the Arctic Circle still experienced months of complete darkness and 24-hour summer days. Isotopic studies of tooth enamel revealed that during the summer period of extended daylight Coryphodon would eat soft vegetation such as flowering plants, aquatic plants and leaves. However during the extended periods of darkness when plant photosynthesis was impossible, Coryphodon would switch to a diet of leaf litter, twigs, evergreen needles and most revealingly fungi, an organism and food source that does not require light to grow. Not only does this study reveal the dietary range of Coryphodon, but it also reveals the behaviour of the northern populations living within the Arctic Circle. In this respect, Coryphodon did not migrate south or hibernate, it simply switched between two seasonal food sources. =Sexual dimorphism= noticed a sexual dimorphism in Coryphodon: the canines tend to be either very large or very small compared to cheek teeth, and, comparing to modern hippos, there is reason to assume males had larger canines than females.

It is situated on the river Kinzig, 32 km southwest of Fulda. Its name, meaning \\"on the road\\", refers to the historic trade route Via Regia from Leipzig to Frankfurt on which it was located. Steinau is best known for the Brothers Grimm who spent part of their childhood here. Geography =Location= Steinau is located at an elevation of around 175 m above NHN in the valley of the Kinzig river which divides the hills of the Spessart (to the south) from the Vogelsberg (to the north). The municipal territory extends into both ranges. =Subdivisions= Steinau consists of the following Stadtteile: , , Klesberg, , , , , , , , Steinau proper, and . =Neighbouring communities= The neighbouring communities are from the north (clockwise): Freiensteinau, Neuhof, Flieden, Schl√ºchtern, the unincorporated area Gutsbezirk Spessart which completely surrounds the Stadtteil of Marjo√ü, Bad Soden-Salm√ºnster and Birstein. Name The name Steinau likely is derived from Steinaha, Alemannic for \\"water flowing over rocks\\". History Schloss Steinau Archaeological evidence indicates that there was a small settlement in this area in the 8th century. The first church was built in the 9th century. In the mid-13th century, St. Catherine's Church was big enough to accommodate burials on its grounds. On 4 July 1290, Emperor Rudolf von Habsburg granted a charter awarding Steinau the status of town and permitting it to hold a weekly market. This may have been motivated in part by Steinau's position on the Via Regia connecting Frankfurt and Leipzig. This charter is considered the municipality's founding document. The town's heyday was in the 16th century, when the town church was rebuilt in Gothic style and increased in size. In 1528-55 the castle, since the 13th century a residence of the Counts of Hanau was rebuilt as a Renaissance palace. Schloss Steinau with its 35 m high bergfried remains the town's landmark. In 1561, the town hall was built, followed a year later by the Amtshaus, seat of the Amtsmann, the local representative of the ruler. Like many other towns, Steinau suffered severely during the Thirty Years' War which brought plundering, fire and the plague. Another setback followed in the 18th century during the Seven Years' War. Only in the later part of that century did an economic upturn set in. The Brothers (Jacob and Wilhelm) Grimm, famous for their collections of fairy tales and folklore, lived in Steinau during their childhood. Their grandfather, Friedrich Grimm (1730-1777) had been a Protestant minister in Steinau, and their father, Phillip Grimm, returned to his boyhood home as Amtmann (clerk) in 1791. The family lived in his official residence (Amtshaus) until 1796, when Phillip died. Jacob and Wilhelm went to live with their aunt in Hanau to finish their education, and the rest of the family remained in Steinau until 1805 in a house, Die Alte Kellerei, that still stands today at Br√ºckentor. It is one of many half-timbered buildings that can be found throughout the town.  Transportation  Steinau lies on the Kinzig Valley Railway (Hesse) and offers hourly connections to Frankfurt and Fulda.

Biography Reisinger was born in Kanji≈æa, Serbia, into a family of painters and decorators active in Austria- Hungary and the Balkans. Most family members died in the Holocaust, including his father. As a teenager, he became active in the Partisan Pioneer Brigade and, with his mother and stepfather, immigrated to Israel in 1949. Reisinger initially lived in a transit camp and then worked as a house painter in order to earn money from almost any source. In 1950 at age 16, he was accepted as a student‚Äîits youngest up to the time‚Äîat the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem, there to 1954. During mandatory service in the Israeli Air Force from 1954, he was the art director of its books and other publications. While there, he attended a class on postage-stamp design taught by Abram Games, who became his mentor and friend. Subsequently, he traveled, studied, and worked in Europe: from 1957 in Brussels and then onto London where, 1964‚Äì66, studied stage and three-dimensional design at the Central School of Art and Design, designed posters for Britain's Royal Mail, and worked for other clients while making intermittent visits to Israel. Then in 1966, he returned permanently to Israel and established a studio in Tel Aviv and later in Giv'atayim. His work has been included in numerous international group and one-person exhibitions. A large number of social-, political-, and cultural-theme posters and other graphic design, such as calendars, packaging, and more than 150 logos are superior to much of his fine art. He designed a new logo for El Al airlines (1972), and the 50-meter-long aluminum-cast relief (1978) of a biblical quotation in Hebrew on the exterior of the Yad Vashem, Israel's official museum/memorial to Holocaust victims, in Jerusalem. He has also designed logos for the Tel Aviv Museum of Arts, Tefen Museum of Arts, and Habima Theater (◊î◊ë◊ô◊û◊î - ◊î◊™◊ô◊ê◊ò◊®◊ï◊ü ◊î◊ú◊ê◊ï◊û◊ô) and the symbol and posters of the 9th-15th Maccabiah Games (◊û÷∑◊õ÷∑÷º◊ë÷¥÷º◊ô÷∏÷º◊î). His widely published self-produced ‚ÄúAgain?‚Äù poster (1993) features a Nazi swastika (which Reisinger incorrectly made to face left) breaks apart to 5 pointed red Star of soviet union in reference to the possible dreaded repeat of the Holocaust. The influences on his work‚Äîitself more widely focused than solely on social and political issues‚Äîhave come from colorists, Minimalists, Constructivists, and humorists. He claims one of his more significant contributions has been to stretch the visual and communicative possibilities of Hebrew letters through his symbols and logos. Reisinger is one of Israel's most-accomplished graphic designers; the others include Franz Kraus (1905‚Äì98), Gabriel and Maxim Shamir (1909‚Äì92, 1910‚Äì90), and David Tartakover (b. 1944). Reisinger designed the three IDF decorations the Medal of Valor, the Medal of Courage and the Medal of Distinguished Service.https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israel-prize-winning- designer-behind-iconic-logos-of-el-al-habima-dies-at-85-1.8193267 Recent exhibitions * 2004 A traveling exhibition of posters, Hungary \\"Ways,\\" a traveling exhibition of selected design works, prints, drawings, and paintings: * 2005 Museum of Applied Arts, Budapest * 2005 Cvijeta Zuzoric Pavilion, Belgrade * 2006 Ion Mincu Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism, University of Bucharest * 2007 Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA), Beijing * 2008 Taipei Fine Arts Museum (TFAM), Taiwan (‚ÄúThe Art of Design‚Äù retitled from ‚ÄúWays‚Äù) Awards 1954 Herman Struck Prize for poster design, Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, Jerusalem 1957 - First prize for the poster of the Palais International de la Science, Expo 58, Brussels 1974 Nordau Prize for Design 1981 Herzl Prize for Contribution to Design in Israel 1984 First Alumni Prize, Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, Jerusalem 1998 Israel Prize for design, the first award of such prize to a designer Knights' Cross of the Order of Merit, Republic of Hungary Bibliography * Goldfine, Gil. \\"Dan Reisinger.\\" Graphis magazine (vol. 47, 1991, pp. 80‚Äì91) * Leu, Olaf. \\"Dan Resinger: A Champion of Visual Culture.\\" Novum magazine (1996, pp. 60‚Äì67) * Tszorf, Maurice. \\"Color, Form, Function: Dan Reisinger's New Residence in Caeserea,\\" Graphis magazine (vol. 56, no. 329, 2000, pp. 66‚Äì75) * Bing'nan, Yu (introduction).

Rare animals are the osprey (Pandion haliaetus), the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), the common painted frog (Discoglossus pictus), as well as the insect species Bucherillo littoralis, Stenoniscus carinatus, Pterolepis elymica, Cicindela circumdata imperialis, Cicindela littorea goudati, Teia dubia and Aphanius fasciatus. The salt works are an important stopover for many European migratory birds before they fly across the Strait of Sicily to Africa. 170 bird species have been counted here. Salt Museum Located in an old mill, the Salt Museum is a private structure with tools and an exhibition of the traditional activity of the artisanal production of salt. Nearby is the \\"Salina Culcasi\\", with Torre di Nubia ( ), part of the ancient Torri costiere della Sicilia system to prevent the theft of salt by Barbary pirates from Maghreb.

He is believed to have been a hermit. His feast day is August 20. In 1162, an ancient tomb containing an unidentified body was found at Rocamadour. Shortly thereafter, the legend of Amadour developed greatly. He was now described as having been a servant of Mary, the mother of Jesus, and to have later married Saint Veronica and become a missionary to Gaul. He was also subsequently identified as Zacchaeus from the Gospel of Luke. Amadour is said to have been born in 388. He is said to have witnessed the martyrdom of St. Paul. It is considered probable that the story of Amadour is completely unfounded, and that he himself may be a wholly imaginary person. There is no factual foundation for identifying him with Saint Amator, a bishop of Auxerre. References *Holweck, F. G. A Biographical Dictionary of the Saints. St. Louis, MO: B.

He is the first person to hold that position, which was established by a new charter for county government that voters approved in 2008. He was elected to a four-year term in 2010 and strongly re- elected in 2014 and 2018. During this period, he and the Board of County Commissioners have sometimes disagreed about the relative limits of their authorities under the new charter. In 2012 he sued the Board after it overrode his veto on a contract, and was upheld by the Circuit County Court. But the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the Board, saying it clearly had \\"the discretionary authority to approve contracts\\" under the County Charter. While Hackel has run successfully as a Democratic Party candidate for each of his elected positions, he has had ambivalent relations with the party and its other candidates. In 2013 he asked not to be listed as a Democrat in the Macomb County register of elected officeholders. In 2014 he initially declined to endorse Democratic former US Congressman Mark Schauer as the party's candidate for governor. In addition, since being elected as County Executive, Hackel has sometimes crossed party lines in supporting Republican candidates for county offices when there were Democratic candidates also running. He has suggested he might run for governor as an independent. Prior to serving as County Executive, Hackel served 10 years as Macomb County Sheriff, from 2001‚Äì2010, being elected to four-year terms in 2000, 2004 and 2008. He had served in the sheriff's department since 1981, part of his father's long tenure as elected sheriff of the county. During this time, Hackel also completed a master's in public administration at Central Michigan University, and advanced law enforcement training at both FBI and US Secret Service facilities. He resigned as Sheriff on December 31, 2010 to begin his term as County Executive. Background Born in Detroit, Michigan, to Ada and William H. Hackel, Mark Hackel is the second of two sons. He attended public schools. By high school his family had moved to Sterling Heights, Michigan, where he graduated from the high school. He followed his father into a career in law enforcement. Hackel's brother, William Hackel III, became an attorney. In July 2009 he was appointed as judge of the second division Michigan's 42nd District Court by Governor Jennifer Granholm. After years as an officer, his father William H. Hackel was elected as Sheriff of Macomb County in 1976. He was repeatedly re-elected and served six consecutive terms, from 1977 to 2000. Mark Hackel earned a Bachelor of Arts Degree from Wayne State University in Criminal Justice, and joined the sheriff's department in Macomb County in 1981. He later earned a master's degree in Public Administration from Central Michigan University. While working at the sheriff's department, he also received training at the FBI National Academy and the U.S. Secret Service's dignitary protection school. Hackel has taught classes in criminal justice and leadership at Macomb Community College, where he met his future wife, Tracie Damschroder. He also taught at Wayne State University. Since being elected as county executive, he has hosted a local cable show called Executive Focus. Macomb County Sheriff Hackel's father, William H. Hackel, resigned from the sheriff's position on April 27, 2000, after a jury in the Isabella County Court convicted him of rape: two counts of third-degree criminal-sexual conduct from an incident the previous year. He was succeeded by Undersheriff Ronald P. Tuscany, who served as interim Sheriff for the final seven months of Hackel's term. William H. Hackel was sentenced to 3 to 15 years in prison by Isabella County Circuit Court Judge Paul Chamberlain. He was paroled and released from prison on April 24, 2003. Mark Hackel, his son, was one of 15 candidates to run in the primary on August 8, 2000 for the Democratic Party nomination for Macomb County Sheriff. Likely benefiting from name recognition, Hackel captured 46% of the vote. He defeated Republican Steve Thomas in the general election for Sheriff in November 2000, winning 52% of the vote to become County Sheriff. Hackel won re-election in 2004 and 2008, defeating Republican candidate Kristi Dean both times. In his 2008 victory, Hackel received 78.4 percent of the vote and set a new record of 314,778 total votes for a county-wide elected office. In early 2007 Hackel and his office received national attention during their investigation of the homicide death of Tara Grant, whose body was found dismembered. Her husband, Stephen Grant, confessed to police and was charged with murder. Grant was convicted of second-degree murder in his wife's death in December 2007 and was sentenced to 50 to 80 years in prison by Macomb County Circuit Court Judge Diane Druzinski in February 2008. County Executive On December 3, 2008, Hackel announced that he had formed an exploratory committee looking at the possibility of a run for Governor of Michigan in 2010. He later decided to run instead for the new position of Macomb County Executive, which had been approved by voters in 2008. Unopposed in the Democratic primary, Hackel won the nomination. On November 2, 2010 he was elected as the first Macomb County Executive, receiving 66 percent of the vote and defeating Republican Randell Shaffer, who had 31 percent, and Libertarian Erin Stahl, who had 3 percent. Hackel resigned his position as sheriff on December 31, 2010 and took office as County Executive for a four-year term starting on January 1, 2011. On December 7, 2010 Hackel named Mark Deldin, Chippewa Valley Schools Superintendent, as his Deputy County Executive. In November 2014, Hackel defeated Republican David Novak to win a second-term as County Executive, taking 69 percent of almost 260,000 votes. He easily won a third term in November 2018. =Clashes with Macomb Board of Commissioners= Hackel and the members of the Macomb County Board of Commissioners each had new roles to define under the 2008 county charter, and have sometimes disagreed over the extent of their relative authorities. In October 2011 they disagreed on whether the Board or Hackel had the final authority to approve contracts for the county. On February 29, 2012, Hackel sued the Board in Macomb County Circuit over its override of one of his vetoes of a series of contracts. Hackel said of the lawsuit > \\"...the (Hackel) administration argues that the board's definition of > contracts and purchases, including multiple expenditures related to the same > item or project, violates the \\"clear separation of powers\\" that voters > embraced in the charter. For example, the commissioners want to approve or > reject a series of related contracts that add up to $35,000 over a 1-year > period.\\". On May 14, 2012, Circuit Court Judge John Foster ruled in Hackel's favor, saying, \\"the power to make expenditures following an appropriation is an executive function which is properly exercised by the County Executive.\\" Hackel said of the ruling, \\"I think it's going to finally get them (the Board) to understand the relationship. They do not run county government. They should just allow me to do my job according to the charter.\\" The Board, led by Chairwoman Kathy Vosburg, R-Chesterfield, appealed the decision to the Michigan Court of Appeals. In a unanimous decision announced on October 30, 2012, the court reversed the lower court decision, ruling against Hackel, saying, \\"The Macomb County Charter unambiguously grants to the Commission the discretionary authority to approve contracts.\\" Hackel said, \\"We don't see this as an unfavorable ruling even though the terminology is it's overturning the ruling of the circuit court.\\" The Hackel administration did not appeal the ruling to the Michigan Supreme Court. In 2013, Hackel told reporters that his New Year's resolution was to communicate with the Board on a one-on-one basis. He said, \\"I am here looking to work with you. There are tremendous opportunities in Macomb County to take advantage of, and I hope to engage all of you in working toward that progress.\\" Relations with the Democratic Party While Hackel has been successful in winning Democratic Party nominations and general elections, his relations with the Party and other candidates has been at best ambivalent at times. He has crossed party lines to endorse Republican candidates for some county and state offices, offending some party regulars. In addition, some fellow Democrats in Macomb County have said that he is too willing to work with Republicans, including Gov. Rick Snyder. In 2013, Hackel instructed the County Clerk's office not to identify him as a Democrat in the county directory of elected officials. During Michigan's gubernatorial election in 2014, Hackel originally said that he would stay neutral, rather than endorsing the presumptive Democratic nominee, former US Congressman Mark Schauer. Hackel eventually \\"reluctantly\\" endorsed Schauer, who was defeated by the incumbent Snyder. In 2016, Hackel crossed party lines by endorsing Republican U.S. Representative Candice Miller, a former Macomb County Treasurer with whom he had worked, in her bid to unseat 6-term Democratic incumbent Anthony Marrocco in the race for Macomb County Public Works Commissioner. He said, \\"The point is to endorse people that you believe are the ones that are going to be the most effective in making things happen. The working relationship I would get with a person like Candice Miller would far exceed any expectations the public would have or that I would have.\\" In 2018, despite having endorsed the statewide Democratic ticket, Hackel refused to back Fred Miller, the Democratic nominee for the 2018 special election for Macomb County Clerk. Hackel initially backed state senator Steve Bieda in the Democratic primary. After Miller won the nomination, Hackel supported Miller's Republican opponent, Lisa Sinclair, although they had never met. Hackel said that he felt Miller and County Clerk Carmella Sabaugh had conspired to \\"rig\\" the 2016 clerk election. Miller filed to run minutes before Michigan's deadline, in order to appear on the August primary ballot; while at the same time, Sabaugh withdrew from the race minutes before Michigan's deadline to be removed from the ballot, essentially leaving the Democratic nomination open to Miller. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Hackel expressed support for a citizen-backed initiative to repeal a 1945 law that gives Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer powers to declare a state of emergency without the consent of the state legislature. Whitmer has used the emergency powers to keep many sections of the Michigan economy completely or partially closed during the pandemic. Political future Hackel has three times flirted with running for Governor of Michigan, considering running in the 2010, 2014, and 2018 elections. He put out early feelers In 2008 and in 2012. Hackel eventually decided to run for and was elected as Macomb County Executive in 2010. The Republican candidate, Rick Snyder, won the governorship. In October 2012, Hackel was reportedly considering a run at the governorship in 2014. But in January 2013, Hackel announced that he would not run for governor in 2014, but would instead focus on running for re-election as County Executive. Again in May 2017, Hackel suggested he might run for governor, either as a Democrat or independent. He eventually ran for a third term as County Executive, and again won the primary and general elections by a wide margin.

Since 1914, it has been sold in a small cobalt blue jar. Noxzema contains camphor, menthol, phenol and eucalyptus, among other ingredients. Originally developed as a sunburn remedy, it is frequently used as a facial cleanser and make-up remover. It can also be used for soothing chapped, sunburned, or otherwise irritated skin. Since the introduction of Noxzema, the brand name has appeared on shaving cream, razors, and skin-cleansing cloths. History The original formula for Noxzema was invented by Dr. Francis J. Townsend (1875-?), a physician/druggist by 1900, in Snow Hill, Maryland; by 1910, in Berlin, Maryland; and by 1920, in Ocean City, Maryland.1900,1910,1920 U.S. Census Records The formula was called \\"Townsend R22\\" and referred to commonly as \\"no-eczema\\". Dr. Townsend, who practiced near the beaches of the Atlantic Ocean, prescribed it as a remedy, mainly to beach resort vacationers who were severely burned by ultraviolet sun rays. Townsend later gave the formula to druggist, George Avery Bunting (1870-1959), who for many years denied the transaction. In about 1917, Bunting began producing and selling \\"Dr. Bunting's Sunburn Remedy\\", marketing the product as an alternative to the greasy, tallow-based medicating creams in use during the period. For the first 3 years, George A. Bunting and Elizabeth Buck mixed, heated and poured the product themselves. The name was changed to Noxzema, supposedly because a satisfied customer who exclaimed, \\"Sure knocked my eczema!.\\" An early slogan was ‚ÄúThe miracle cream of Baltimore‚Äù. Beginning in 1920, the cream was produced by Bunting. In 1926, Noxzema Chemical Company broke ground and built a small factory in Baltimore, Maryland at the corner of W. 32 St. & Falls Cliff Rd.The Anglo American 1938 Yearbook In 1926(Dec.14), N.C.C. applied for a trade-mark with the U.S. Patent Office.1926 Index of Patents Issued from the United States Patent Office By 1937, 15 million bottles were being sold yearly.Life Magazine, Nov.29,1937 By the 1940s the product was being sold throughout the United States, and was promoted by radio and print advertisements. Noxzema continued to be produced by the Noxzema Chemical Company, which was reorganized in 1966 as Noxell Corporation, and was still under the ownership of the Bunting family. In 1989 Procter & Gamble acquired the brand as part of the acquisition of Noxell. Alberto-Culver bought the rights to the brand in 2008 from Procter & Gamble and operated the line of skin-care products until Alberto-Culver was acquired by Unilever in 2010. In October 2014, the Noxzema brand in Greece changed its ownership from Procter & Gamble to a domestic company, Sarantis, for ‚Ç¨8.7 million.

It was written by Lou Reed and John Cale. In a footnote to the lyrics, Lou Reed wrote: \\"The idea here was to string words together for the sheer fun of their sound, not any particular meaning.\\" Lou Reed, Between Thought and Expression: Selected Lyrics of Lou Reed (Viking, 1992), , p. 7. According to Cale, Sterling Morrison refused to play bass on the song because he disliked having to play it on \\"Venus in Furs\\", hence, Cale overdubbed the bassline while Morrison stuck to his usual guitar. In late 1965 Al Aronowitz arranged for the Velvets to play at the Caf√© Bizarre in Greenwich Village for a fortnight in December 1965; while there they played a \\"furious\\" version of \\"Black Angel's Death Song\\"; the manager ordered them not to play that song again, to which the band responded by playing it again \\"with a vengeance\\", and were sacked. Recording The song was recorded in April 1966 at Scepter Studios in Manhattan. The music is dominated by the piercing sound of John Cale's electric viola, creating dissonance throughout the song. Also throughout the song are loud bursts of audio feedback, primarily from Cale hissing into the microphone. Reed and Morrison's guitars in the song are downtuned a whole step (as is common with a handful of other songs on The Velvet Underground & Nico).
