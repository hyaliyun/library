They have released three studio albums, two of which are the official scores for live stage shows by the group Jabbawockeez, who were named MTV’s America’s Best Dance Crew Champions in 2008. The Bangerz have collaborated with groups as diverse as San Jose Taiko, a Japanese drumming ensemble, and have toured with groups such as Afrika Bambaataa, Clipse, ?uestlove (of The Roots), Raekwon, Ghostface, Carlos Mencia and DJ Z-Trip. History =Founding= The Bangerz were founded as a six-person production and DJ supergroup in San Jose, California. All the members, including Goldenchyld, Replay, Nick Ngo, Cutso, Squareweezy, and G-Wrex, had attended Silver Creek High School together. All six members had previously been parts of different DJ collectives. DJ Cutso, for example, had started mixing after learning from his uncle at eight years old, and based a lot of his early music on Depeche Mode, Kraftwerk, OMD, and Pet Shop Boys. According to Cutso, \\"Growing up in San Jose, there was a strong presence of mobile DJs, dance groups and mix-shows on the radio. So growing up in that environment really struck a nerve with me, and I decided to get a little more serious about it when my friends started taking an interest in it.\\" On October 24, 1998, Cutso invited a number of DJ friends to his 17th birthday party. According to Cutso, \\"We had a bit of an impromptu showcase that night. We jammed in front of the whole party and everyone was super juiced on it. That following Monday at school, we assembled what would eventually become the Fingerbangerz Crew.\\" =Battling= Backstage picture of the Bangerz with members of Jabbawockeez. Both groups collaborated in the San Jose party scene as early as 2003. The Fingerbangerz originally formed \\"for the sake of battling,\\" and later began to DJ parties. As the only 6-person DJ and production team to make and perform music, they were the first DJ group to utilize a 12-turntable team routine in 1999. They've stated, \\"we entered every local record store, high school and car show battle under that name. Our plan was to just dominate the battle scene, and that’s exactly what we did.\\" The Bangerz were named the 2001 DMC Regional Champions and 2000 International Turntablist Federation Western Hemisphere Team Champions, also winning the Red Bull 3-Style Bay Area DJ Competition. The group came out with a mixtape called Robot Remains, which debuted at #7 on the electronic charts on iTunes. After releasing several mixtapes and winning various DJ battles, they started \\"producing our own brand of scratch-infused experimental music.\\" After 2003, the \\"finger\\" aspect of the name was dropped to make the group more accessible to a younger crowd. =VI-R-US (2003)= The group released their first album, VI-R-US, in 2003. Released independently, it widened their fanbase as far as Japan and brought them more fully to the attention of Jabbawockeez, a hip-hop dance crew who had started dancing to Bangerz tracks in 2003. According to Cutso, \\"We grew up with one of the Jabbawockeez’ former members, Wish One. They were forming the Jabbawockeez around the same time we released our first album, VI.R.US, in 2003. He showed it to them, and they used it for some of their routines. They built their signature style around all of the chaos and intricacies of our music.\\" Their official connection with the dance group started around 2007, when they were about to be named MTV’s America's Best Dance Crew (season 1) Champions,. The Jabbawockeez commissioned the Bangerz to create all their original music, and after winning ABDC, they began collaborating on a Vegas dance show. =MÜS.I.C. (2008)= The Jabbawockeez performing to Bangerz music in 2008 On March 1st, 2011 the Bangerz released the LP Müs.I.C. It charted directly behind Daft Punk’s Tron on iTunes upon its release. The first single from the 14 tracks, \\"Robot Remains,\\" had climbed to the number seven electronic song on iTunes after its release in October 2010. The tracks had been used as a live soundtrack for over a year by the JabbaWockeez at the Monte Carlo Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, and the overall album was three years in the making. =PRiSM (2013)= After MÜS.I.C., the Bangerz began collaborating on the new stage show PRiSM with the Jabbawockeez in Las Vegas. It became the third largest show in the city, only behind the Blue Man Group and Cirque du Soleil. The score to the show, also titled PRiSM, was released as an LP on June 25, 2013. The single from the album, \\"Beam,\\" premiered several weeks earlier. =Collaborations= DJ Squareweezy of The Bangerz DJing live in 2010 As of 2011, everyone in the crew are full-time musicians and DJs. Group member Replay, for example, has produced tracks for Diplo, Kelis and Chris Brown on his single \\"Look At Me Now.\\" Their music has appeared in advertisements for McDonald's, Sprint, The Sims, The Simpsons Game, the 2009 NBA All Star Game, America's Best Dance Crew (season 1), and Pepsi. As of June 2013, their music was being featured in two Microsoft commercials. The Bangerz have toured with and opened for artists such as Afrika Bambaataa, The Clipse, ?uestlove (of The Roots), Raekwon, Ghostface, Kid Koala, The Rapture, and Little Dragon, also touring with Carlos Mencia and DJ Z-Trip both nationally and internationally. The New Orleans’ Voodoo Fest was their first festival, and they also performed at the first Fader Fest. They've also worked with artists out of San Jose like rappers Rey Resurreccion and Don Prahfit, as well as American born, Japan based rapper Paulie Rhyme. In early 2013 the group was solicited by the director of the film Project X to produce a track for their party soundtrack. The Bangerz held a collaborative show at the Montgomery Theater on June 15, 2013 with the Japanese-American drumming group San Jose Taiko, after first performing with them at the 2010 SubZERO festival. Kumi daiko, a new style that evolved to include American and Japanese drumming techniques and genres, originated in San Francisco in 1968. Started in 1973, San Jose Taiko is the third-oldest American taiko group. Style About their method, \\"It's a lot of experimenting,\\" says Bello, \\"We record everything, and then if something cool comes from it, we'll expand on it and make it a song.\\" According to the group, \\"Nick Ngo loves aggressive sounds, bringing harder, meaner sounds and throwing in production tricks and off-kilter sounds. Cutso’s crates go deeper and weirder; he’s a master of beat-juggling and unexpected flips. Goldenchyld‘s vision harmonizes the group’s sound with futuristic ideas. Squareweezy is an experimentalist and a showman, heavy into where hip-hop and electronica meet and takes notes from genre figureheads like J Dilla and FlyLo. G-Wrex makes sure the music has depth, his love of RnB and soul automatically serves him in grounding the group. And Replay [brings] a glossy pop sheen to every track. Starting around 2009, the group have done most of their performing on Serato and Ableton, with much of their production work on Ableton. Squareweezy uses an Akai MPC (an MPC2000XL) and the Roland SP-404 in live shows. They also use Native Instruments products.

A devout Buddhist, she was the youngest daughter of Kertanegara, king of Singhasari. She was an influential figure within Majapahit inner palace and later in her life acted as the matriarch of Majapahit's Rajasa Dynasty. Tradition mentioned her as a woman of extraordinary beauty with exceptional charm, wisdom and intelligence. Early life Gayatri was raised as a princess in Tumapel palace, Kutaraja, the capital of Singhasari kingdom, East Java. Her name derived from Gayatri, the Hindu goddess personification of hymn and mantras. She was the youngest daughter of King Kertanegara. Her siblings are Tribhuwaneswari the oldest, Prajnaparamitha, and Narendra Duhita. Kertanegara did not have any son as his heir, instead he has four daughters, dubbed as the four Princesses of Singhasari. King Kertanegara was well known as a pious adherent of Tantric Buddhism, it is highly possible that Gayatri also exposed to Buddhism ideas and subsequently adhered the religion. Gayatri's eldest sibling, Tribhuwaneswari was betrothed to Prince Nararya Sangramawijaya (Raden Wijaya), still a relative of Kertanegara's extended family, and probably groomed to be his successor. According to tradition, Gayatri was mentioned as a keen and bright student in literature, social, political and religious matters. In 1292 Gayatri witnessed the destruction of her home, the Singhasari kingdom, under the unsuspected attack of Jayakatwang, Duke of Gelang-gelang (Kediri). Yet she survived and escaped unharmed from the burning palace, immediately discarding her identity, hiding and blending herself among the captured servants and slaves. His eldest sister, Tribhuwana, managed to escape and reunited with her husband, Raden Wijaya, while her other sisters, Prajnaparamitha, and Narendra Duhita, were captured by enemy forces and held hostage in Kediri. For about a year she hid herself in Kediri palace posing as a servant. George Coedes contends Raden Vijaya and Gayatri Rajapatni were married before the Jayakatwang revolt, during which she was killed. Raden Wijaya in 1293 cunningly using the aid of invading Mongol forces manage to destroy Jayakatwang forces in Kediri, and finally liberated Gayatri and rescued her captured sisters. Prince Nararya Sangrama Wijaya ascended to the throne in regnal name as King Kertarajasa Jayawardhana in November 1293, and established Majapahit kingdom. He took Gayatri as his wife, also Gayatri's sisters; Prajnaparamitha, and Narendra Duhita, concluding all of Kertanegara's daughters as his consorts. This action was probably motivated to strengthen his claim to the throne as the sole successor of Kertanegara by removing possible contests of the princesses suitors. Another opinion suggested that his marriage to Prajnaparamita and Narendra Duhita was just a formality, an act of compassion to save the family's reputation, since it is probably during their captivity in Kediri, the two princesses suffered severe abuses and harassment that physically and psychologically scarred them beyond marriage. Life as queen consort and queen dowager Gayatri was one of King Kertarajasa's five wives. Other than Gayatri's three sisters, the Kertanegara's daughters princesses of Singhasari, Kertarajasa also took Dara Petak, the princess of Malayu Dharmasraya kingdom as his wife and named her Indreswari. Among these queens, only she and Indreswari bore Kertarajasa's children, while Tribhuwaneswari, Kertarajasa's first wife and other wives seems to be barren. Indreswari bore Kertarajasa a son and thus an heir, Jayanegara, while Gayatri bore him two daughters, princess Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi and Rajadewi. Tradition mentioned that Gayatri is Kertarajasa's favourite, thus earned her a new name \\"Rajapatni\\" or \\"Raja's (king's) consort or companion\\", praised the couple as a perfect match, as far as comparing the couple as the incarnation of celestial couple; Shiva and Parvati. She seems to take interest in Adityawarman, Jayanegara's cousin of Malayu Dharmasraya lineage. She carefully see through Adityawarman's education and career development, and became his sponsor and patron. During the reign of her step son Jayanegara, Gayatri seems to take the role as dowager queen, as an influential matriarch figure of Majapahit inner circle within the palace. During this years she oversaw the rise of capable Gajah Mada's career, and probably become his sponsor, patron and protector, recruiting Gajah Mada into her daughter, Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi's side as a trusted officer. Later life At a certain point of time during the last years of Jayanegara's reign, Gayatri renounced her worldly affairs and retired as a Bhikkuni (Buddhist nun). After the death of Jayanegara in 1328, she was then the sole surviving elder of Majapahit royal family since her sisters and Indreswari all already died. Responsible for the succession of Majapahit throne, Gayatri appointed her daughter Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi to rule the kingdom on her behalf in 1329. In 1350, Gayatri Rajapatni died in her vihara (monastery), subsequently Queen regnant Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi abdicated her throne in favor to her son Hayam Wuruk that ascended the throne in the same year. Her death marked the ascend of Hayam Wuruk to the throne since Tribhuwana Tunggadewi was only become queen regnant on behalf of Gayatri. The Nagarakretagama written in 1365 by Prapanca during the reign of Hayam Wuruk, Gayatri's grandson, describe the elaborate and solemn Sraddha ceremony dedicated for the departed spirit of revered Gayatri Rajapatni. She was enshrined in several temples and posthumously portrayed as Prajnaparamita, the Mahayana Buddhist female boddhisattva of transcendental wisdom. Some inscription mentions the lofty offering and ceremony performed by Adityawarman and Gajah Mada to honor the spirit of late Gayatri Rajapatni, suggested that both men owed their career to Gayatri Rajapatni's patronage.

Andersens Boulevard is the most densely trafficated artery in central Copenhagen, Denmark. The 1.3 km long six-lane street passes City Hall Square on its way from Jarmers Plads, a junction just south of Nørreport station, to Lange Bridge which connects it to Amager Boulevard on Amager. From Jarmers Plads traffic continues along Gyldenløvegade which on the far side of The Lakes splits into Aaboulevard and Rosenørns Allé. History Franz Šedivý: The boulevard in 1894 H. C. Andersens Boulevard, originally known as Vestre Boulevard, was planned after Copenhagen's fortifications had been decommissioned and roughly follows the course of the moat which ran outside the West Rampart. It was inspired by Vienna's Ringstraße as well as Haussmann's wide boulevards in Paris. Its final course was determined in a plan from 1872. As it was not intended for through traffic, most traffic to and from Lange Bridge still used Vester Voldgade. In 1890, Vestre Boulevard was laid out as a green promenade with an abundance of trees and flowers where the city's bourgeoisie would stroll in peaceful surroundings. When Lange Bridge was replaced with a new bridge in 1903, it was built as a direct continuation of Vestre Boulevard. The Dante Column was installed in front of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in 1922 and the surrounding section of the street was renamed Dantes Plads. During World War II, the broad central reservation was used for construction of bunkers. Soon after the war, the lanes were widened in response to increasing car traffic. In 1954, a new Lange Bridge opened as a direct continuation of Vestre Boulevard to release the pressure on the more narrow Vester Voldgade.

Its line ran from Ithaca, New York to Owego, New York. It was founded in 1829 and began operations in 1834. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (Lackawanna) leased the company in 1855 but it remained in existence as a non-operating subsidiary. It was conveyed to Conrail on the bankruptcy of the Erie Lackawanna Railway, successor to the Lackawanna, in 1976.  History  The railroad was chartered on January 28, 1828, as the Ithaca and Owego Railroad. It was the third railroad built in North America, and the longest of the three. It connected the town of Ithaca, on the southern shore of Cayuga Lake with the town of Owego on the Susquehanna River to the south. By 1818 the Cayuga–Seneca Canal connected the Erie Canal to the north end of Cayuga Lake. The Ithaca and Owego was planned to provide a missing link connecting the Erie Canal and the Great Lakes to the coal fields of Pennsylvania and the Chesapeake Bay. Little construction was done until the Chemung Canal was built along a similar course in 1833 via Seneca Lake and Elmira, diverting trade from Ithaca and Owego. At this point construction was started and the work was completed by 1834. The chief engineer for the construction was John Randel Jr. The track was standard gauge strap-iron rails-- strips of cast iron attached to wooden rails. The line covered a distance of approximately . It comprised an ascent from Cayuga Lake of in followed by a descent to Owego of . Two inclined planes accomplished the lift from Ithaca, one driven by a stationary engine and the second by a horse-drawn windlass. Originally the cars were pulled by horse power, An engine, \\"The Pioneer\\", built by Walter McQueen of Albany, was purchased in 1840. This engine was in service for a few years before crashing through a bridge killing the engineer and fireman, and the railroad returned to horse power. In 1842 the railroad defaulted on its debts, and was foreclosed and sold to Henry Yates and Archibald McIntyre who reorganized the company as the Cayuga and Susquehanna Railroad. At this time the track was changed to broad gauge. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad leased the company in 1855 and operated the line thereafter as part of its Cayuga Division. The DL&W; reconstructed the line with \\"heavy T rails\\" cand converted it back to standard gauge, facilitating a connection to the Erie in Owego. In 1956 the physical right-of-way was abandoned; it would later be incorporated into the South Hill Recreation Way in Ithaca. The company remained in existence as a non-operating subsidiary through the merger with the Erie Railroad in 1960 to form the Erie Lackawanna Railway. It was conveyed to Conrail in 1976 on the Erie Lackawanna's bankruptcy.

Only two similar jugs are known in the UK. The Wenlok jug is the smallest of the three, but bears the earliest maker's mark for the English founder - possibly a bell founder - who cast it. The other examples are the Asante Ewer, which retains its lid and is held by the British Museum having been found at Kumasi in the Gold Coast in 1896 during the Anglo-Ashanti wars, and the Robinson jug, which was found in a farmhouse in Norfolk in the 1879 and is now in the collection of the Victoria & Albert Museum. All bear inscriptions in English and were made from leaded bronze, an alloy of copper, tin and lead, cast in a two-part mould in a similar manner using bronze spacers to separate the inner and outer moulds, with similar decorative motifs. The Wenlok jug stands high and weighs . It is decorated with the words \\"My Lord Wenlok\\", and several heraldic emblems, including the Royal Arms of England used from 1340 to 1405, and the three crowns of East Anglia associated with St Edmund (who was King of East Anglia) and St Etheldreda. Hinges indicate a lid was once present, but it is now missing. It is thought to have been made for William Wenlock (d. 1391), Canon of St Paul's Cathedral from 1362, Archdeacon of Rochester from 1376, and Canon of the King's Chapel, Westminster in 1381, who is buried at St Mary's Church, Luton, or his great-nephew John Wenlock, 1st Baron Wenlock, whose brick-built manor house Someries Castle is near Luton. By 1831 it was in the collection of Thomas William Fermor, 4th Earl of Pomfret, possibly acquired by antiquarian Henrietta Louisa Fermor. The jug was sold by Alexander Fermor-Hesketh, 3rd Baron Hesketh at Sotheby's in 2005 along with other articles from Easton Neston in Northamptonshire. It reached £568,000, six times the top auctioneer's estimate of £60,000 to £80,000. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York tried to buy the jug from the buyer, but a temporary export ban in October 2005 allowed Luton Museum to raise £750,000 to match the price and acquire it instead, funded by £137,500 from the National Art Collections Fund, £500,000 from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, and donations from the Headley Trust, the Pilgrim Trust, the Worshipful Company of Founders, the Friends of Luton Museums, and others. The jug was displayed in Luton at Wardown Park Museum and then at the Stockwood Discovery Centre in Stockwood Park. It was stolen from a high-security cabinet at Stockwood Discovery Centre on 12 May 2012. After appearing on the BBC's Crimewatch programme, the jug was recovered in Tadworth, Surrey in September 2012. It has also been suggestedFRAY, Adrian F.; The Mystery of Lord Wenlock and His Glastonbury Treasure; Austen Macauley, 2016; . that all three ewers were made in, or near, Bruges during the first week of July 1468, and given by the Charles the Bold, Count of Burgundy, to the travelling companions of his bride, Margaret of York (King Edward IV's sister). Her companions were Sir Anthony Woodville (Asante Ewer), the Duchess of Norfolk (the Robinson Jug), and Lord John Wenlock (the Wenlock Jug). The English texts were devised by the new countess, and the out- of-date coat of arms were in the household of the count's aunt, who had married the Duke of Bedford in 1423. The three jugs/ewers would therefore be examples of mid-fifteenth century Burgundian workmanship.

Riggs (March 2, 1875 – August 17, 1943) was a Christian missionary stationed in Kharpert during the Armenian Genocide. In his book Days of Tragedy in Armenia: Personal Experiences in Harpoot, 1915-1917, Riggs provides an important eyewitness account of the Genocide and concluded that the deportation of Armenians was part of an extermination program organized by the Ottoman government. The book is considered to be one of the most detailed accounts of the Armenian Genocide in the English language. Early life Henry Harrison Riggs was born to a family of Christian missionaries in Sivas, Ottoman Empire on March 2, 1875 and was the son of Edward Riggs. He joined the church of Marsovan in 1889. After growing up in the area, Riggs traveled to the United States where he acquired his education at the Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, and the Auburn Theological Seminary, and graduated from 1902. The same year, Riggs was appointed missionary to Turkey by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Upon arrival in the Ottoman Empire, Riggs studied at the Talas American College near Kayseri. Riggs eventually became the president of the Euphrates College from 1903 to 1910. After his presidency, he began his Evangelist work in the Kharpert province. Armenian Genocide Armenian civilians, escorted by armed Ottoman soldiers, are marched through Harput (known as Kharpert by Armenians, the kaza of the Mamuret-ul Aziz), to a prison in the nearby Mezireh as reported by Riggs Henry Riggs first wrote about the propaganda that was initiated by the government prior in entering World War I. He recalls that \\"the Turkish authorities began a systematic build-up of hostility,\\" dispensing \\"a great deal of fiction to prove that the Armenians were a disloyal element menacing the safety of the Turks.\\" He declared that the case brought up against the Armenians was ultimately \\"in the minds of the common Turkish people, in preparation of atrocities which were to follow.\\" Riggs further noted concerning self-defense measures Armenians had taken in response to being massacred: > The loss of Van to the Russians, through the activity and bravery of the > Armenians, produced a tremendous impression. Of course it was not then > generally known that the Armenians had only acted in self-defense after the > Turks had massacred many of them. Outbreaks were reported in various places, > and some of these, notably in the region of Diarbekir, were real enough, > though the Armenians were the victims not the aggressors in these > disturbances. When the Armenian Genocide started, deportations and arrests of prominent Armenians were planned for the Kharpert Armenians. Riggs writes: > It was evident that some terrible fate was being planned for the Armenians, > though as yet no hint had been given as to what that fate should be. By June > 20th several hundred of the leading Armenians had been put in prison, and on > that day one hundred and fifty from the prison in Harpoot were sent to > Mezireh, and three days later were sent out to their death. On June 26 came > the reply to the Vali's perfidious representations. The edict was posted in > public places, and announced by street criers throughout the Armenian > quarters of the city. All the Armenians and Syrians of Harpoot and vicinity > must go into exile to a destination in Mesopotamia. The announcement was > made on Saturday, and all the people were commanded to be ready to start on > the following Thursday. Riggs described in detail the procession out of the prison and how it ended: During the summer of 1915, Riggs observed the transit camps of the deportees using a telescope and wrote that \\"for most of the women and children was reserved the long and lingering suffering that massacre seemed to them a merciful fate—suffering such as was foreseen and planned by the perpetrators of this horror. I speak guardedly and state as a fact this horrid indictment of the Young Turks by whom the crime was committed.\\" As the deportations took place, Riggs remarked about the deportations and subsequent wholesale massacre of Armenians in the deserts of Syria: > Very good evidence exists for the belief that both there and Ras-ul-Ain, > also in the same desert, the people were massacred wholesale as soon as they > left the villages where they had been quartered. At the beginning of the > period under discussion, that is, at the beginning of 1916, there were in > exile in that district something like 485,000 Armenians. Fifteen months > later, after the last deportation had been completed, not more than 113,000 > out of that throng could be located. Out of the 372,000 who had perished > most had died from starvation and disease, but many thousands were also > massacred at the last moment, when apparently the Turkish government had > tired of the pretense of carrying out the theory of deportation. Riggs believed that the deportation of Armenians was part of an extermination program organized by the Ottoman government and concluded that: > The abuses and murder of ordinary Armenians during these \\"deportations\\" were > too persistent to be dismissed as simple aberrations of a purportedly benign > official policy of population transfer. Riggs further added that \\"the attack on the Armenian people, which soon developed into a systematic attempt to exterminate the race, was a cold- blooded, unprovoked, deliberate act, planned and carried out without popular approval, by the military masters of Turkey.\\" Riggs also wrote in July about the measures taken of confiscating Armenian assets by saying, \\"you could not look out of the window without seeing someone walking down the street carrying some sort of load of booty, bought or stolen from Armenian houses.\\" After the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, Henry Riggs believed that \\"Turkey re- established herself on a basis excluding the Christian races\\" and continued to maintain in 1943, decades after the Armenian Genocide ended, that: > During the preceding decade the Turkish people, and again especially their > leaders, had been guilty, before God and man, of one of the most revolting > crimes in history [1915]. The triumphant reestablishment of the Turkish > sovereignty not only left that crime unpunished, but, in the mind of > probably a majority of the Turks, the horrid course which they had pursued > had been gloriously vindicated. Later life Henry's brother Ernest Wilson Riggs succeeded Henry as president of Euphrates College 1910 to 1921 and participated in Near East Relief Work and then joined James Levi Barton as associate secretary and corresponding secretary of the ABCFM from 1921 to 1932.

In 1940 the family moved to Auburndale, Massachusetts for the education of their two daughters. He returned to Beirut in 1943 and eventually became ill in Jerusalem and died there on August 17, 1943 at the age of 68.

This was against their believes. They arrived and established a community in California. Some of these families, among them the Tomachoffs and the Popoffs moved to Glendale, and established a Russian Village. One of the factors which benefited them was the sugar beet factory of that town. The Sugar Beet Factory closed in 1913 and the demand for their agricultural products declined, that and the climate of the area convinced many families to return to California.

Most were varieties of Klubnikinisty, Maksimisty, Obshchei, Pryguny, and Sionisty. In 1918-19 about a dozen children died of influenza and were buried in unmarked graves along the east edge. Such unnatural deaths were believed to be \\"unclean\\" (nechistyy), and not marked. Traditional old Russian wood grave planks called golubez, pointed with a small roof, represented the \\"house\\" (dom) of the deceased. No crosses or images were used because Spiritual Christians are not Orthodox. No records of the early graves exist because the most zealous Spiritual Christians feared the government. In 1920 this cemetery served about 200 families (1000+ people) of mixed Spiritual Christian faiths from Russia, living in four adjacent villages. In the 1920s, most families could not pay their debts and moved to California, some to Mexico. About 1922, Popoff sold the property to a trustee to prevent it from being controlled by his zealous Tolmachoff in-laws. The collection of funds raised to pay for the land was recorded and shows that people who moved to California paid the most, and the entire Tolmachoff contribution was about 2%. In 2016 one gang of Tolmachoff brothers illegally forged documents, lied to police, stole the bank account, and claimed they \\"inherited\\" the meeting hall and cemetery property, changed locks and prevented anyone else from using the properties.

Background A native of Livonia in Pointe Coupee Parish, Ward attended Bethany Christian School in Baker, Louisiana before attending Louisiana State University and Southern University Law Center, both in Baton Rouge. He and his wife, the former Dawn White, reside in Maringouin in Iberville Parish with their three children, Reese, Hayes and Hudson. The Ward family attends Bethany World Prayer Center. Political career In July 2013, Ward left the Democratic Party and became a Republican. He became the twenty-sixth Republican senator, with thirteen remaining Democrats. Ward's District 17 encompasses all or parts of several parishes, including Assumption, East Baton Rouge, East Feliciana, Iberville, Pointe Coupee, St. Helena, St. Martin, West Baton Rouge, and West Feliciana. Ward handily won the nonpartisan blanket primary in the fall of 2011 over another Democrat, Larry Thomas, 25,645 (70 percent) to 11,000 (30 percent). He succeeded the term-limited Senator Robert M. Marionneaux, also of Maringouin. Ward has a 62 percent rating from the interest group, the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. However, he only scored a 33% in 2013, which ranked him 29th out of 39 state senators. In 2013, he also scored 30 with the Louisiana Legislative Log's conservative index. Congressional race abandoned After becoming a Republican, Ward was criticized for switching parties to enhance his chances of winning Louisiana's 6th congressional district seat in 2014. The incumbent, Bill Cassidy, was leaving the United States House of Representatives to challenge U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu. Scott McKay, writer for conservative Louisiana politics blog The Hayride, stated that Ward had voted \\"to expand Medicaid, push a Lilly Ledbetter Junior bill in the state legislature and oppose term limits for school board hacks, is a pretty dubious proposition.\\". However, Ward decided not to seek the U.S. House seat after he determined that a congressional race and service if elected would take too much time from the formative years of his young children. At the end of the special legislative session in June 2017, Ward introduced a resolution calling upon lawmakers to act in a more civil fashion toward one another, not to let partisanship and political views sour personal relations with colleagues. \\"There are always a lot of heated discussions, but it seems to me like we're moving away from philosophical disagreements on issues and getting personal,\\" Ward said. State Representative Chris Broadwater, a Republican from Hammond, introduced Ward's resolution in the House, where it passed without opposition. U.S. Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana's 4th congressional district, who is a former member of the state House of Representatives, expressed a similar view in a document which he wrote as a congressional freshman.

Founded in 2009, the company’s oil and gas recovery efforts are focused on the Illinois Basin, an area that encompasses Western Kentucky, Southern Illinois, and Southwestern Indiana. History President and CEO Daniel Williams founded Navitas Land and Mineral in 2009 on the premise that “oil is where oil was” and began reworking fields that had once been productive. In April 2011 the company drilled its first new oil well on the Oakley lease located in Hopkins County, Kentucky. By the fall of 2011, Navitas had drilled 13 additional wells nearby. Navitas Land and Mineral also reopened an oil field in Poole, Kentucky that had once been owned and operated by the Sinclair Oil Corporation. Navitas employed Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) techniques that included carbon dioxide injection (CO2) and water flooding to capture previously untapped resources near wells that had been plugged and closed off for more than thirty years. By June 2013, Navitas Land and Mineral had drilled 54 new wells. The company’s deepest well, the Otho Babb #2, was drilled to a total depth of 7008 feet and has the distinction of being the deepest producible well ever drilled in Webster County, Kentucky. Deeper wells previously drilled in the area were dry and abandoned, according to the Kentucky Geological Survey. Operations Navitas Land and Mineral’s oil and gas recovery efforts are focused on the Illinois Basin, an interior Cratonic basin with estimates for future recoverable reserves at 4.1 billion barrels. Navitas begins developing a new field by implementing a work-over and drilling program that may involve water removal or pump maintenance. Navitas also uses new technologies to access oil and natural gas reserves that were missed in the original production of a well. In less than ten percent of its recovery efforts, the company may employ fracturing of formation structures to create better channels of oil and gas flow. Navitas Land and Mineral seeks to acquire oil and gas assets of merit and develops them to their full potential through both conventional drilling and enhancement methods as well as low-cost, non- conventional processes to dramatically improve oil and gas recovery.

It was the sixth named storm of the season, having developed on January 24, 1989 in the south-west Indian Ocean. Given the name Firinga, it moved generally southwestward for much of its duration. While the cyclone was approaching Mauritius late on January 28, it attained peak winds of 135 km/h (85 mph). Firinga passed 50 km (31 mi) west of the island, producing wind gusts that destroyed 844 homes. Heavy crop damage occurred on the island, and damage nationwide was estimated at $60 million (1989 USD). One person was killed in Mauritius. After passing Mauritius, Firinga struck Réunion early on January 29 with wind gusts as strong as . The storm dropped torrential rainfall in the southern portion of the island, including 24‑hour totals of at Pas de Bellecombe and at Casabois, both of which set records for the locations. The rains caused widespread river flooding and resulted in 32 mudslides. Firinga isolated several towns due to flooding and left power and water outages. A total of 2,746 houses were damaged or destroyed, leaving 6,200 people homeless. Damage was estimated at around ₣1 billion (1989 francs, $157 million 1989 USD), and there were 10 deaths on the island. Firinga later dissipated on February 7 after having weakened and executed a loop to the southeast. Meteorological history On January 24, both the Météo France office in Réunion (MFR) and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began tracking a tropical disturbance in the south-west Indian Ocean, about halfway between the east coast of Madagascar and Diego Garcia; the latter agency designated it as Tropical Cyclone 08S. After initially moving to the southeast, the system later turned to the southwest and gradually intensified. Given the name Firinga, the system intensified into a moderate tropical storm on January 26\\\\. Two days later, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane while Firinga was approaching Mauritius. Late on January 28, the cyclone passed about northwest of the island. Shortly thereafter, MFR upgraded Firinga to tropical cyclone status, estimating 10 minute maximum sustained winds of 135 km/h (85 mph). At the same time, the JTWC estimated 1 minute winds of 165 mph (105 mph). Shortly after 0600 UTC on January 29, Firinga made landfall on Réunion while at peak intensity. It quickly crossed the island and began weakening; MFR downgraded the storm below cyclone status at 1200 UTC that day. The JTWC followed suit on January 30, and the next day Firinga began turning to the south. On February 1, the JTWC discontinued advisories, although MFR continued tracking the storm. After turning to the east and executing a loop to the southwest, Firinga was last observed on February 7. Preparations and impact On January 28 while Firinga was approaching Réunion, officials on the island issued a level 1 tropical cyclone alert on the Organisation de la Réponse de SÉcurité Civile (ORSEC) plan. By the next day, this was raised to a level 3 when landfall was imminent. The government of Mauritius also warned the citizens of the approach of the storm. Before affecting Réunion, the cyclone passed near Mauritius with wind gusts up to . Much of the island lost power, water, and telephone access; the water system was disrupted when cleaning systems were damaged. The storm destroyed over 70% of the island's crops, including wrecking 5,000 metric tons (5,500 tons) of sugar. In addition, Firinga destroyed 844 houses in Mauritius. Throughout the island, the cyclone killed one person, injured 507, and left about $60 million (1989 USD) in damage. While in the vicinity of Réunion, Firinga produced a minimum pressure of at Pointe des Galets. Sustained winds throughout the island reached at least with gusts of over . The peak gust was at Saint-Pierre, and the capital Saint-Denis reported gusts of . In addition to the winds, Firinga dropped record heavy rainfall on Réunion, including a report of that broke the record for an hour total at Plaine des Cafres, and that broke the record for a six-hour total at Saint-Joseph. Totals from 7am January 29th to 7am January 30th included at Pas de Bellecombe, and at Casabois, both of which set 24-hour rainfall records for those locations. Rainfall was lighter along the east and west coasts of the island, but highest in the central plains and in the south, where totals were 1 in 50 year events. Due to the strong winds possibly disrupting instruments, rainfall totals may have been higher than what were recorded. Firinga also produced high waves along the island, reaching along the eastern coast. The high rainfall resulted in the Rivière Langevin to overflow its banks, causing significant flooding in Saint-Denis. The highest flow rate was 1,100 m3/s/s (38,846 ft3/s/s) along the Rivière des Remparts. Several rivers changed their courses due to the high volume of water, and high sediment carried by rivers disrupted lagoon systems. The high rainfall caused 32 landslides throughout Réunion, most of which were small; however, one in La Plaine-des-Palmistes damaged a road. The floods damaged roads, buildings, and farmlands along their path. At Salazie, the storm destroyed a bridge, which restricted traffic to Cilaos. Coastal roads were damaged, with several washed out near Saint-Pierre; one road had a cut in length. The Rivière Langevin destroyed a bridge, and flooding near Bras-Piton wrecked of roads. Road damage alone was estimated at ₣137 million (1989 francs, US$26 million). At least four towns were isolated due to storm damage. High winds left 60% of the island without power, mostly in the southern portion including Saint-Joseph and Cilaos. The latter town also lost telephone service. Widespread areas lost water access due to flooding washing out two main water lines, affecting about 60,000 people. High winds left heavy crop damage, mostly to banana trees and vegetables. In L'Étang-Salé, all of the fruit trees were knocked down, and in Entre-Deux, 5,000 hens and several livestock died. In Sainte-Marie, a landslide wrecked about half of the sugar crop. Island-wide, Firinga destroyed 970 houses and damaged 1,776 others, leaving 6,200 people homeless. Most of the damaged houses were in Saint- Pierre, and the heaviest damage generally occurred in towns along floodplains. During the storm, 10 people died throughout Réunion, four of whom in the town of Le Tampon. There were also 62 injuries. Overall damage was initially estimated at around ₣1 billion (1989 francs, $157 million 1989 USD). On the island, Firinga was the third significant cyclone of the 1980s, after Cyclone Hyacinthe in 1980 and Cyclone Clotilda in 1987. Aftermath On Mauritius, power and water were gradually restored following the storm, and people without power used generators. The United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs provided $10,000 (1989 USD) to the country to purchase water tanks and saws. After the storm, officials in Réunion declared a disaster area for the island. The government started an emergency relief fund to provide assistance to the affected families. The European Economic Community donated ₣1.42 million francs ($222,000 1989 USD) due to the storm. Residents on the island assisted each other by providing lodging and donating clothing. France sent 15,000 ration kits, 1,500 beds and blankets, and 20 cisterns to the island in the aftermath of Firinga. In addition, 400 troops and 50 vehicles were dispatched from an insular military base in order to assist the affected populations. Within two days, crews in Réunion restored water access to about 20,000 people. Conditions returned to normal in northern Réunion within about a day. In the southern portion, however, it took up to four weeks for life to return to normal. The significant amount of flooding damaged the coral reef system due to excessive runoff. Due to dead animals being washed into the ocean, diving at the reefs was banned for several weeks. The waves had damaged the coral reef system to such extent that there was no regrowth after seven years.

It is also known by the synonym Cyriopagopus schioedtei. Description Omothymus schioedtei is a large and colourful arboreal tarantula from the subfamily Ornithoctoninae. It is a very large spider with a leg span of 22 cm and a carapace length above 3 cm. There is a distinct sexual dimorphism. The male is olive green with faint yellow leg striation. The male has a blunt tibial apophysis and long slender legs. Subadult males can be easily sexed by the epigynal fusillae method, as well as turning greener and greener for each molt until maturity. This is especially easy to see by the ventral coloration as subadult males are green and subadult females are black. Taxonomy Omothymus schioedtei was first described by Tamerlan Thorell in 1891, the type species of his new genus Omothymus. In 1903, Eugène Simon synonymized Omothymus with Cyriopagopus, hence Omothymus schioedtei became Cyriopagopus schioedtei. The relationship between a number of genera of East Asian spiders was unclear . In 2014, Ngamniyom and colleagues found in a phylogenetic study that Cyriopagopus schioedtei nested within three Haplopelma species. A. M. Smith and M. A. Jacobi in 2015 restored the species to its original name of Omothymus schioedtei, on the grounds that the type species of the genus Cyriopagopus, C. paganus, was not distinct from the genus Haplopelma, unlike C. schioedtei. They also synonymized Haplopelma with Cyriopagopus. Distribution and habitat The species is found in Malaysia. It lives in primary lowland and foothill monsoon forest in hollow trees many meters up. Adult females are almost entirely found in large mature trees, but younger animals can be found behind loose bark, in rock crevices and in man made structures like bridges and board walks.

CommonBond also provides in-school loans to MBA students at 20 programs in the United States. The company launched nationally in September 2013. History  CommonBond was founded in November 2012 by David Klein, Michael Taormina, and Jessup Shean, who met at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School MBA program. The impetus was the founders' frustration with the lack of affordable loan options to fund their own graduate school education. For their business proposal, the trio was accepted to the Wharton Venture Initiation Program, which serves as a start-up incubator. After deciding to pilot their model at Wharton, the group focused on fundraising during 2012. By the company's launch in November 2012, $2.5 million had been invested by Wharton alumni and $1 million of seed funding was provided by a Wharton alumnus in return for a stake in the company. CommonBond's first fund lent to 40 MBA students and recent graduates at Wharton. CommonBond expanded to 20 MBA programs across the United States in September 2013, after announcing it had raised over $100 million in equity and debt financing. In March 2014, CommonBond expanded its student loan refinancing and consolidation programs to graduates of law, medical, and engineering programs across the US. In February 2015, CommonBond expanded its student loan refinancing program to 14 graduate degree programs. At that time, the company also announced a financing partnership with Nelnet (NYSE: NNI). Nelnet committed $150 million to fund CommonBond loan volume and made an equity investment in the company. In September 2015, CommonBond raised $35 million in Series B funding from August Capital, Nyca Partners, and Victory Park Capital, in a round led by August Capital. Shortly thereafter, the company announced the expansion of its student loan refinancing program to graduates of over 2,000 universities, as well as the introduction of its Parent PLUS Loan refinancing program.  Products and services  In September 2015, CommonBond introduced a new Parent PLUS loan refinancing program, whereby parents who borrowed federal Parent PLUS loans to finance their children’s undergraduate education can refinance those loans through CommonBond. CommonBond announced a partnership with Prodigy Finance, an international post-graduate student lender, in July 2015. The partnership allows international post-graduate students to secure funding for their business school education in the US through Prodigy Finance, which determines the terms and conditions of the student loans.

It was first described by Eugène Louis Simon in 1887. Description The species formerly placed in Haplopelma are medium to large spiders; for example, Cyriopagopus schmidti females have a total body length, including chelicerae, up to , with the longest leg, the first, being about long. The carapace (upper surface of the cephalothorax) is generally dark brown. They have eight eyes grouped on a distinctly raised portion of the cephalothorax, forming a \\"tubercle\\". The forward-facing (prolateral) sides of the maxillae have \\"thorns\\", which act as a stridulating organ. The first leg is usually the longest, followed by the fourth, second, and third. Mature females have an M-shaped spermatheca. Mature males have a spur on the forward-facing sides of the tibiae of the first pair of legs and a pear-shaped palpal bulb with a wide, curved embolus. Taxonomy The nomenclature of a group of theraphosid genera from South and Southeast Asia, including Cyriopagopus, Haplopelma, Lampropelma, Omothymus, and Phormingochilus, is somewhat confused. The status of the genera has changed several times recently, and species have been moved from one genus to another. Currently, Haplopelma is considered to be a junior synonym of Cyriopagopus, and Melopoeus of Haplopelma, hence of Cyriopagopus, but this may change. The genus Cyriopagopus was erected by Eugène Simon in 1887 for the species Cyriopagopus paganus from Burma. In 1985, Robert Raven made Cyriopagopus the senior synonym of Melognathus Chamberlin, 1917. In 1890, Tamerlan Thorell described a species of spider under the name Selenocosmia doriae. In 1892, Eugène Simon decided that this species was sufficiently different from others placed in the genus Selenocosmia to warrant a new genus, Haplopelma, with one species, Haplopelma doriae. Raven in 1985 also decided that Haplopelma was the senior synonym of Melopoeus Pocock, 1895. A. M. Smith studied the type specimen of Cyriopagopus paganus (the type species of Cyriopagopus) and decided that it had the key characteristics of Haplopelma, making Cyriopagopus the senior synonym of Haplopelma. This analysis is accepted by the World Spider Catalog , with the comment that \\"Haplopelma, Cyriopagopus, Melopoeus, and other ornithoctonine genera are in urgent need of revision\\". Distribution and habitat The genus is found in Southeast Asia (China, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Singapore), Borneo, and the Philippines. Species that have been studied live in underground, silk-lined tubes, often with a surrounding web of radiating signal threads. They may be found in small colonies at the base of trees or bamboos. Some species favour steep, south-facing slopes.  Toxicity  Like all Old World tarantulas, spiders in the genus Cyriopagopus lack the urticating hairs found in their New World counterparts, hence use biting as a primary means of both attack and defence. Some Cyriopagopus species are among those reported to have more toxic venom. Although bites may cause severe pain and a range of other effects, no fatalities are known. Cyriopagopus lividus, C. hainanus, and C. schmidti (under its synonym Selenocosmia huwena) have had their venom characterized. The last two produce hainantoxins and huwentoxins, respectively. The large fangs can produce puncture wounds which are susceptible to bacterial infection if not treated properly. Species Cyriopagopus schioedtei in Borneo it contains nine species, found in Asia: *Cyriopagopus albostriatus (Simon, 1886) – Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia *Cyriopagopus doriae (Thorell, 1890) – Malaysia (Borneo) *Cyriopagopus hainanus (Liang, Peng, Huang & Chen, 1999) – China *Cyriopagopus lividus (Smith, 1996) – Myanmar, Thailand *Cyriopagopus longipes (von Wirth & Striffler, 2005) – Thailand, Laos, Cambodia (Vietnam Tiger) *Cyriopagopus minax (Thorell, 1897) – Myanmar, Thailand (Thailand Black) *Cyriopagopus paganus Simon, 1887 (type) – Myanmar *Cyriopagopus schmidti (von Wirth, 1991) – China, Vietnam *Cyriopagopus vonwirthi (Schmidt, 2005) – Southeast Asia In synonymy: *C. huwenus (Wang, Peng & Xie, 1993) = Cyriopagopus schmidti (von Wirth, 1991) Transferred to other genera: * Cyriopagopus dromeus (Chamberlin, 1917) → Melognathus * Cyriopagopus schioedtei (Thorell, 1891) → Omothymus * Cyriopagopus thorelli (Simon, 1901) → Omothymus See also * List of Theraphosidae species References Category:Theraphosidae Category:Mygalomorphae genera Category:Spiders of Asia ","title":"Cyriopagopus"},{"id":"39997879","text":"is a Japanese real estate developer. History Mori Trust was founded in 1970 as Mori Building Development, a subsidiary of the Mori Building group founded by Taikichiro Mori. Following his death in 1993, his two sons Minoru Mori and Akira Mori disagreed as to how to continue the business, with Minoru wishing to continue the company's focus on existing properties and new large- scale urban projects, and Akira wishing to expand the company's portfolio into more small-scale office and leisure properties. This led to a split of the Mori Building group, with Akira Mori taking over the Mori Building Development entity and renaming it \\"Mori Trust\\" in 1999. Mori Trust properties that predated the 1999 schism were originally named \\"Hills\\" or \\"Mori Building\\" but were renamed to \\"Trust Tower\\" or \\"MT Building\\" around 2002. Mori Building, which spent years planning and completing the Roppongi Hills complex in central Tokyo, focuses on multibillion-dollar complexes; Mori Trust sticks to single or twin structures. Mori Trust announced in December 2015 that it would begin investing in the United States, starting with the $658 million acquisition of two office buildings in Boston from Liberty Mutual. The company was also reportedly examining potential investments in New York, Washington and other East Coast cities, with a total budget of 100 to 200 billion yen.

He was born in 1892 to the Daouk Family. He was the younger brother of Omar Bey Daouk, the Head of Beirut Vilayet that time (pre- Greater Lebanon) before the French Mandate of Lebanon. Daouk was known for being one of few men to ever serve as prime minister of Lebanon in the French Mandate of Lebanon and the First Republic of Lebanon (1943-1991). Sami Solh also served within these two periods.  Early life and education  Daouk was born in Ras Beirut in 1892. After completing his secondary studies in a French school in Beirut in 1910, Daouk went to France to continue his studies where he obtained a diploma in engineering from the National School of Arts and Crafts of Aix-en-Provence in 1914.  Early career  Daouk's notable career began in 1915 where he worked as an engineer at the Société Générale des Sucreries within the refinery industry of Egypt. In 1919 he was assigned personally by His Majesty King Hussein I of Hejaz, as his technical adviser and he was put in charge of the mining industry in Hejaz. Upon returning from Hejaz to Lebanon, Daouk was appointed by His Excellency Charles Debbas as both the Mayor of Beirut and Aley. This was of course just 8 years after Omar Bey Daouk was the Mayor of Beirut and the head of Beirut Vilayet in 1918 before the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Daouk was Mayor until 1941 until he was appointed as Prime Minister of Lebanon. In 1927 Daouk became an influential philanthropist in Beirut. Throughout this period Daouk was influential along other political figures in visioning Lebanon's independence carving the path towards it.  First Mandate  Daouk's first mandate was during the French Mandate when, after having served as Secretary of State for Public Works and Post Telephone and Telegraph earlier in 1941, he was appointed Prime Minister 1941 to 1942 during the rule of President Alfred Naqqache by the President of Lebanon. His first mandate was renowned for helping pave the way for Lebanon's independence, after he had stepped down from his role in 1942 increasing the pressure asserted on France's actions by the United Kingdom and the western powers. Although he had very close ties with France on the political sphere, Daouk was known for fully supporting the idea of a free and independent Lebanese republic. Upon resignation, as Sunni Muslim judge from Sidon known as Sami Solh was appointed as Daouk's successor  Diplomatic career  In 1943, Daouk became the President of the National Congress of Lebanon right after he completed his term as Prime Minister, or what was called the President of Councils before 1943. In 1944 Daouk was chosen as the consul of Lebanon to France he would become an ambassador in 1953 and remain at that position within his diplomatic mission for another five years until his return in 1958. His diplomatic mission was widely supported by the Lebanese as he severely re- strengthened Lebanon's ties with France, while Camile Chamoun was shifting Lebanon's ties towards the United States. In 1958 Daouk was appointed ambassador to Spain where he strengthened the ties between Lebanon and Spain and promoted economic and political cooperation in various projects within Lebanon. A program was also launched to attract and re-invite the Lebanese diaspora that had left Lebanon earlier to Latin America. Daouk has also been a delegate of Lebanon in many conferences within the United Nations, Arab League and UNESCO. After his second mandate, Daouk became a director of the OGERO group, Lebanon's telecommunications company, he also had an intuitive role in real estate.  Second Mandate  Upon the election of Fuad Chehab as President of Lebanon, he dissolved the Lebanese parliament on the 5th of May 1960. This forced Prime Minister Karami to resign later on the 14th of May 1960. On the 15th of May 1960, Daouk took initiative and formed an interim government while heading it as Prime Minister to hold back the increasing tensions in Lebanon during the political vacuum of the early 60s. The Lebanese Parliamentary elections were held and finalized by the 3rd of July 1960. Daouk's interim government granted 11 seats to Karami's party in the Chamber of Deputies whereas the independent politicians (of whom Daouk was one) were granted 41 out of 99 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. This paved the way for Saeb Salam's election later that year. In addition, Daouk was also Minister of National Defense and Minister of Finance during the initial 1960's. His policies were credible as they contributed to Lebanon's booming economy in the 1960s where the Lebanese were among the wealthiest 30 nations in the world.  Diplomatic career  In 1944 Daouk was chosen as the consul of Lebanon to France he would become an ambassador in 1953 and remain at that position within his diplomatic mission for another five years until his return in 1958. In 1958 Daouk was appointed ambassador to Spain where he strengthened the ties between Lebanon and Spain and promoted economic and political cooperation in various projects within Lebanon. A program was also launched to attract and re-invite the Lebanese diaspora that had left Lebanon earlier to Latin America. Daouk has also been a delegate of Lebanon in many conferences within the United Nations, Arab League and UNESCO. After his second mandate, Daouk became a director of the OGERO group, Lebanon's telecommunications company, he also had an intuitive role in real estate.  Personal life  Outside Parliament, Daouk was noted by others to be very similar to his iconic brother Omar. Omar Bey Daouk was quoted by Michel Chiha's personal observations: “…My recently departed friend had all the characteristics of a sage. Both in private and in public, he was an upstanding citizen. We were both members of the first committee that saw to the birth of our nation’s Constitution. He was known for his quiet discernment, his respect for the rights of others, for his perfect understanding of the country’s multiplicity, his sense of harmony and his recognition of the political and social benefits that Greater Lebanon offered all its citizens. He saw in it the possibilities of a multi-communal society. More at home behind the scenes, his advice was often called upon in matters of state or business. The nation will always remember what he stood for and will always be grateful for the public contributions of this exemplary man…” ‘Omar Bey Daouk’, M.C., Le Jour, November 1949.

It is still active, though the original tower has been replaced with an automated beacon on a skeleton tower. History Sabine Bank cuts across the channel leading into the river and thence up to Port Arthur, Texas, an important port. Although its depth represented a hazard only to larger vessels, concern was sufficient to prompt a request in 1888 by Rep. William H. Crain for a lightship to mark the shoal. This request was dismissed by the district engineers, but at the turn of the century the matter was raised again, and $40,000 was appropriated for construction of a fixed light. A caisson light was designed, with the \\"sparkplug\\" form typical of the era. Construction began in June 1904 but was halted due to a lack of funding, leaving the caisson in place but with naught but a temporary light on the base. Construction resumed the following summer but was interrupted again by a storm in early October, during which workers took refuge in the incomplete structure. The structure was finally completed the next spring and was lit for the first time on March 15, 1906. The light was equipped with a third order Fresnel lens with a Daboll trumpet provided for a fog signal. The station sits in open water, and its isolation was a frequent cause for complaint by keepers. Staffing was difficult. A hurricane in 1915 damaged the light and forced the keepers to abandon the station after waves breaking over the structure contaminated the water supply; they were able to return several days later. The station fared better in a subsequent storm in 1920, after much of the gallery was enclosed in iron plates, but the many issues led to early automation with an acetylene beacon in 1923, though the Fresnel lens was retained until 1971 (when the beacon was converted to solar power), the lamp having been converted to electricity in 1960. The house was used as an observation post during World War II but was unmanned thereafter. The exposed location and lack of staffing caused the structure to decay rapidly, and in 2001 the Coast Guard requested bids for removal of the tower and its replacement with a skeleton tower. This was carried out the following year, but the lantern of the tower was preserved and is now on display in a park in Sabine Pass. The lens is now on display at the Museum of the Gulf Coast in Port Arthur. The skeleton tower light remains in service, standing on the old caisson foundation.

Upon airing, the episode was watched by 11.60 million viewers, with an 18-49 rating of 2.8, presenting an increase in ratings from the previous episode. Plot Despite finding Angie in the shelter, Jim leaves her locked up, unable to believe his son would do such a thing. Meanwhile, the military has scheduled a \\"visitors' day\\" for the residents of Chester's Mill, where family members and friends of people trapped in the dome can come and visit their loved ones. During the event, Linda tells her fiancé about his brother's death, Norrie meets her estranged biological father (Gary Weeks), who her parents had led her to believe she would never be able to find, and Barbie finds out from a soldier stationed outside the dome that the military plans to attempt to destroy the dome with a missile (MOAB), which will likely kill everyone inside. When Barbie relays this to Big Jim, he orders everyone to take shelter in the tunnels underneath the city. He then releases Angie from her captivity, but when Junior finds out, he sets off after her while everyone else takes shelter in the tunnels. As most of the town prepares for the inevitable in the tunnels, Joe and Norrie search for Angie, Junior finds Angie at her house and they spend what they believe will be their last moments together, and Barbie and Julia search for Norrie at the request of her parents.

The movie was directed and written by Marc Fafard, and stars Max von Sydow as a dream therapist trying to help a young woman who has frequent nightmares about dragons. Dragons 3D is filmed in a docu-fictional approach and utilizes computer-generated imagery to explore the legends and science surrounding dragons from countries such as China, Japan, Mesopotamia, and the United Kingdom. Of the film, Leboeuf commented that she found the cultural differences between the various depictions of dragons interesting, especially as she saw that many anthropologists didn't have a fully satisfactory answer as to their ongoing popularity in modern-day society. Max von Sydow echoed these statements and added that he had been interested in dragons and mythology since childhood, as he learned about various different folklores from his father, who worked as an ethnologist.  Synopsis  Skye Ingram (Laurence Leboeuf) has had frequent nightmares about dragons, to the point where it's interfering with her daily life. Because of this, she decides to seek help from Dr. Alistair Conis (Max von Sydow), an eccentric dream therapist and expert on dragons. As the pair works together to uncover what is triggering Skye's distress, they recount the various stories about dragons and their connections to various facets of human and natural society, such as history, literature, national identity, and art. Their work is eventually discovered by Dr. Vulnet Grazinar (Serge Houde), Dr. Conis' nemesis.  Cast  *Max von Sydow as Dr. Alistair Conis *Laurence Leboeuf as Skye Ingram *Serge Houde as Dr. Vulnet Grazinar  Reception  La Presse gave Dragons 3D three stars, praising it for its visual aspects while commenting that the film did not work as well on the narrative level, while stating that it was overall a good film with \\"several spectacular sequences\\". The Metro News gave an overall favorable review, stating that it would be a good film for younger viewers. In contrast, The Davis Clipper gave it one and a half stars, also praising the movie's visuals while criticizing the film for not making more of an effort to tie in the dragons' mythology into their historical context or provide an analysis or sociological framework.

On December 26, 1944, a Nazi counter-partisan unit named \\"Edelweiss\\" stormed a log cabin high on Homolka Mountain in today's Slovakia which housed 15 Allied intelligence officers, a Slovak officer, a Slovak-American interpreter, two Slovak civilian resistance fighters, and Morton himself, covering an OSS operation in the country for a story. Although the Allied officers were duly uniformed and Morton had a war correspondent ID in order to be treated as prisoners of war according to the Geneva Convention (1929), the SS headquarters, in compliance with Commando Order—which stated that all Allied commandos should be killed immediately without trial, even those in proper uniforms—ordered the summary execution of Allied officers and others caught in the act. On January 24, 1945, Joseph Morton, along with 13 Allied officers, was executed at the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. He was the only Allied correspondent to be executed by the Axis during World War II. Career Joseph Morton joined the Associated Press (AP) at Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1937. He worked in AP bureaus in Lincoln, Omaha, Cleveland, and New York then was assigned to be a war correspondent in May 1942 overseas. He covered French West Africa, Algeria, and the Allied Air Forces in North Africa during the North African Campaign and eventually the invasion of Sicily. Following the fall of Rome on June 1, 1944, Morton was encouraged by the AP to expand his coverage in the Balkans. He became the first American correspondent to report the entry of Soviet troops into Bucharest and obtained an exclusive interview with King Mihai on September 7, 1944. He also followed the OSS and the 15th USAAF in three secret missions in the Balkans to cover the rescue of American aircrews and the support of anti- Nazi partisans. Morton was remembered by some officers as \\"gentle, ever smiling Joe\\" although his charm and friendly character disguised an aggressive reporter who would go anywhere and do anything for a story. Joining the mission In the summer of 1944, the OSS, British SOE, and the 15th USAAF in Bari teamed up to land agents in Slovakia to expedite the rescue of Allied aircrew shot down in Slovakia. These were to be the first OSS units to operate in central Europe. In July 1944, Moscow reluctantly approved a U.S. military mission to fly into German-occupied Czechoslovakia to evacuate a number of downed Allied aviators being harbored by British intelligence units and Slovakian partisans. The mission became the OSS cover story to support a Slovak partisan uprising against Nazi rule with guns, ammunition, and sabotage, while gathering military intelligence deep inside Hitler's occupied Europe. Planning for operations into Slovakia was soon underway. A team of OSS agents, led by Navy Lt. Holt Green, formed the Dawes mission in response to the Slovak National Uprising, a Slovak resistance movement launched against the Nazis in August 1944. They also recruited 23-year-old Maria Gulovich as a translator since she was a Slovakian schoolteacher that worked with the underground Slovak resistance and had spoken five languages including Russian, Hungarian, Slovak, German, and a little English. After rescuing 14 American and two Australian aviators on September 17, 1944, in Slovakia, and due to the bad weather, the next rescue and supply mission for the Dawes team was delayed until October 7, 1944, that continued on rescuing downed Allied aviators in the country and assisting the Slovak resistance against the Nazis. Green, while stationing in a rebel capital of Banska Bystrica, Slovakia, reported to the OSS headquarters in Bari that the German Army offensive was closing in and \\"would probably be successful. Situation here is considered hopeless.\\" Green advised against sending in more agents to the rebel capital which was ignored by Bari. Joe Morton had heard of an intelligence mission slated to begin on October 7 and persuaded the Dawes team to let him join them. Since Morton was a popular reporter and had earlier flown with the 15th USAAF and also accompanied the OSS team into Bucharest in August led by his friend, Major Walter Ross, OSS Chief of Special Operations, who was also going with the Dawes team on the morning of October 7, the OSS agents agreed to let them join the secret mission. This time, six B-17s would fly the mission with OSS and SOE agents bringing in tons of arms and ammunition for the partisans. Before leaving Bari, Morton send a message to the AP, saying that he was leaving to cover the \\"greatest story of his life.\\" After landing on an airport in Banska Bystrica where the areas was occupied by partisans and 28 American and two New Zealand fliers were brought aboard the planes that morning, Joe Morton asked Ross to take his story of the airmen's rescue story back to Italy which Ross agreed. Unfortunately, the censors snatched his story for being too revealing and never passed on to the AP. The outside world never heard from him directly again. =Retreating from the Nazis= As the Germans advanced on the rebel capital, Green requested to send most of the Dawes team, including journalist Morton, back to Italy but bad weather prevented the 15th USAAF from taking them back, although every night the Russians were flying dozens of C-47s out of Tri Duby. The Russians promised to fly the Americans out as well but the Russian flights stopped suddenly. The uprising against the Nazis in Slovakia faltered and on October 27, the Nazis entered Banksa Bystrica. Realizing that escaping into the hills was the only option left, Joe Morton, Lt. Holt Green, and the Dawes team, joined long columns of soldiers, partisans, and civilians fleeing into the mountains while encountering German planes strafing and bombing, artillery fire, as well as German units with dogs in hot pursuit. Many partisans died in the grueling march due to the bad weather. While enduring the march, Joe became friends with Maria Gulovich. Maria said that Joe shared his sulfa powder with her. \\"Many times others could walk much better than we did, so we kind of stayed together,\\" Gulovich said. \\"That powder helped....our wounds started healing after application.\\" On December 14, Morton, the Dawes men, and Maria reached and hid the Homolka cabin above the village of Polomka in the mountains as the blizzard closed in. Eleven days on, the officers celebrated Christmas by singing carols and enjoying a ham that young Slovak partisan Rudolf Hruska had carried up from the village.War reporter remembered for strength in final days =Capture= On the early morning of December 25, Gulovich made a decision that saved her life. She, along with two American and two British fugitives, took off for a mountain hotel, another partisan hideout some two hours away, seeking food and shelter and medical supplies at a resort hotel farther up the mountain. Gulovich said that the Associated Press reporter Joe Morton \\"walked with us half an hour or longer, and then he said, \\"Well, I have to go back\\" and we hugged. She also recalled that, \\"Joe wore a hat, a green knitted cap. I turned back after he left me. I can see it even now. He was walking alone with that green hat on top of his head.\\" The next morning, a 300-man strong Nazi counter-partisan named \\"Edelweiss\\", under Commander Ladislav Niznansky, stormed and surrounded the cabin. Morton, who was wearing an American uniform, and the others were captured in the act. Morton's translator Josef Piontek, wrote in his diary that he watched the Nazis burn down the cabin and the flames swallowing a thick stack of notes belonging to Morton who he noted \\"fed on the news more than on food.\\"JOSEPH MORTON, ASSOCIATED PRESS, FOLLOWED THE DAWES MISSION TO MAUTHAUSEN =Death= On January 7, 1945, Morton, 12 American OSS agents, including Lt. Holt Green, leader of the Dawes team, and four British SOE agents were taken to the Mauthausen concentration camps run by Standartenführer commandant Franz Ziereis, in Austria from Linz. At the time, Mauthausen was the fifth largest of the Nazi extermination camps. Two Gestapo officers, Werner Mueller (one of Berlin's best linguists) and Dr. Hans Thost (an interceptor for the Reich Security Main Office) were ordered to go to Mauthausen to interrogate a group of English and American officers who had been taken prisoner in the sector held by Slovak rebels. Thost testified after the war that Ziereis got an intense pleasure of torturing the prisoners of war for information. A civilian translator at the camp later reported that Morton was questioned but not tortured. Morton made clear that he was not a soldier or officially part of the intelligence group, even showing the Germans his war correspondent insignia or ID to prove that he was a journalist. Along with the duly uniformed Allied officers, he and others should have been treated as prisoners of war according to the Geneva Convention (1929).OSS Operations End With Agents' Executions in Mauthausen However, the Germans saw little to no difference between spies and journalists and following a telegram from SS General Ernst Kaltenbrunner ordering the execution in implementation of Hitler's secret Commando Order of 1942, Morton and 13 Allied intelligence agents were led separately into the execution bunker to face a fake camera and told they would be photographed. An SS guard then stepped forward and shot each man in the nape of the neck. All were executed at Mauthausen in the presence of Franz Ziereis and camp chief Adolph Zutter on orders from SS General Ernst Kaltenbrunner. Morton was the only American and Allied correspondent to be executed by the Axis during World War II. Morton left behind his wife, Letty Morton, and a 5-month-old daughter, Melinda Ann (now renamed Mimi Gosney), at the time of his death. Morton's fate Morton's colleagues from AP and his family had no clue to his whereabouts. The AP maintained strict silence about his disappearance in order to not jeopardize his safety if he had survived. However, London received an alarming news from a German radio that said 17 Anglo-American agents who had been captured in Slovakia had been tried by a military tribunal and executed by shooting on January 24, 1945 that same day. In April 1945, the first information leading to Morton's fate when a German interpreter was captured and interrogated by the OSS. Finally, in June 1945, a month after the liberation of Mauthausen camp by Patton's Third U.S. Army, AP's correspondent and Morton's friend Lynne Hientzerling was allowed to fly to Mauthausen to investigate, including the interview of a Polish prisoner, Wilhelm Ornstein. On July 9, 1945, the investigation by the AP stated that Morton was indeed executed by the Germans on January 24, 1945, and also found that there were no evidence of any trials for Morton and the Dawes men before their execution. Legacy Years later, declassified U.S. government files claimed that the OSS had no idea Morton would be aboard the aircraft flying the rescue mission to Slovakia for downed airmen. The file noted that Morton had no clandestine training and that he was actually a guest of the 15th USAAF, not the OSS, and also mentioned that he intended to leave Slovakia when the aircraft returned to Italy, but on the arrival at Banska Bystrica, he changed his mind. However, the OSS files stated that Morton told OSS agents he had elected to wait for the next incoming aircraft. Both the OSS and 15th USAAF denied approving Morton's trip and continued to point fingers at each other. On July 17, 1945, Morton's wife Letty wrote a letter to AP General Manager Kent Cooper in response to a letter of condolence: > That it was intended to be an assignment into eternity was unknown to Joe > when he messaged the AP to cover the 'greatest story of his life.' He was > eager to go and the recent reports state that his enthusiasm did not wane > throughout the bleak moments. Joe always championed the underprivileged—the > little man who was not getting his due in the world. From early days when he > had a pop stand on the curb and gave away the pop to thirsty children who > had no nickels, to his last days when he joined the partisans to right the > grievous wrong inflicted upon Slovakia. He was living his credo to help the > man who was battling against odds. I cannot end this letter without writing > of Joe's deep love for the Associated Press. Its name was synonymous with > the best reporting and it was always with pride that Joe said, 'I am with > the AP.' I am proud that Joe contributed to the history of AP. I do not > profess to understand why he had to be taken from us. My heart will always > ask and always long for him. Some day I hope that we may read the stories > which Lynn had heard Joe buried when the Germans were near at hand.

Some of his lectures are preserved as student notes by the library at the University of Western Ontario. His resignation after 27 years as Professor of Clinical Surgery may have been due to Flexner's negative comments about the school. Wishart was a founding fellow of the American College of Surgeons.

Services Its hospitality network delivered digital music, way finding, coupons, social media, third party content, and advertising options to more than 10,000 venues at its peak, including bars, nightclubs, taverns, resorts, hotels, restaurants, retail stores, event pavilions, and arenas. =SmartSolution= Touchscreen software that served advertising and social media impressions, as well as direct marketing associations operating on 3rd party hardware platforms. =SmartMall= An interactive media service that provided shopping customers with up-to-date information on the latest style and trends with editorialized content and coupons/offers. =SmartTransit= An advertising and content service that connected users to advertisers. =SmartConcierge= System that displays interactive images/movies showcasing the amenities of a client's hotel/resort. =Jukebox= An interactive place-based broadband enabled interactive media service for the bar and nightclub market. History The company was founded in 1999 and was headquartered in San Francisco, California. Ecast merged with RioPort in October 2002. Rioport was a digital music download service precursor to iTunes and was the first service to sign digital download agreements with all 5 of the major music labels. Ecast, Inc. ceased operations when it closed its Jukebox network on March 1, 2012. The company's board of directors voted for an immediate shutdown after the company failed to raise enough capital to continue operating. Ecast's phones and email were turned off shortly after. AMI Entertainment Network Inc. and TouchTunes Interactive Networks indicated they would accommodate customers no longer able to access the company's services. Controversies =TouchTunes patent dispute= In late 2001, Ecast filed a lawsuit against TouchTunes Music Corporation claiming the company resorted to unfair trade practices by notifying Ecast and its customers that they were infringing TouchTunes' patent. On October 15, 2003, Ecast voluntarily dismissed its own claims against TouchTunes for interference with contracts and unfair competition. In January 2004, TouchTunes filed a counterclaim that Ecast infringed on their patent rights by incorporating Touchtunes’ technology into their systems. Ecast also had a separate patent infringement case against TouchTunes, charging the company with infringement by selling its jukeboxes within the U.S. Ultimately TouchTunes and Ecast agreed to cross-license TouchTunes' U.S. Patent No. 6,308,204 and Ecast's U.S. Patent No. 5,341,350, which it licensed from NSM Music Group Limited. =Civil antitrust action= In September 2005, the Attorney General of the United States filed a civil antitrust action against Ecast, Inc. and NSM Music Group, Ltd. The lawsuit alleged that a February 2003 agreement between the companies was in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Specifically that the negotiations which eventually led to NSM Music Group manufacturing Ecast's hardware, after their previous manufacturer terminated the supply agreement, included an agreement by NSM to abandon its plans to enter the U.S. market in return for an upfront payment by Ecast. The Attorney General contended that NSM's agreement caused them to abandon their plan to incorporate their own distinctive digital jukebox platform into their physical jukeboxes and enter the United States market. The Department of Justice simultaneously announced alongside the lawsuit that it had reached a settlement with NSM and Ecast under which the two companies terminated their non-compete agreement. =Samuel \\"Mouli\\" Cohen= In 2009, Ecast co-founder and one-time CEO and Executive Chairman, Samuel \\"Mouli\\" Cohen defrauded 55 investors, including actor Danny Glover and the Vanguard Public Foundation, of more than $28 million and two lawsuits were filed. Cohen told investors that Ecast, Inc. was about to be acquired by Microsoft. Based on those false representations, victims purchased some of Cohen's founders’ shares in Ecast. A federal grand jury in 2010 indicted Cohen on 32 felony counts of fraud and money laundering and was arrested in August 2010. In November 2011, Cohen was found guilty of 15 counts of wire fraud, 11 counts of money laundering, and three counts of tax evasion. He was acquitted of six additional charges. At the courthouse, he was taken into custody.

The production of cotton requires huge amounts of water in dry climates, drying the Lake Chad, in the same way as the Aral Sea cotton land. Background Cotton is an indigenous crop to southern Chad. In 1910 the French colonial administration organized market production on a limited scale under the direction of the military governor. By 1920 the colonial administration was promoting the large-scale production of cotton for export. The French saw cotton as the only exploitable resource for the colony and as an effective means of introducing a cash economy into the area. Indeed, the elaboration of colonial administration went hand in hand with the extension of cotton production throughout the region. France's motives were clear: it sought to ensure a source of raw materials for its home industries and a protected market for its exports abroad. France also intended that taxes derived from commercial ventures within the colonies would offset the expenses of the colonial administration. Therefore, customs duties on cotton exports from Chad, then a part of French Equatorial Africa, were paid to the governor general at Brazzaville (in contemporary Congo), as were duties on exports from other colonies under regional administration. Revenues from a head tax were paid in cash locally and went directly to the lieutenant governor of the colony. Not surprisingly, virtually the only means of earning the money to pay the tax was by the sale of cotton to the French. In 1928, exploitation of cotton within the colony was placed in the hands of Cotonfran, a private company. Under the terms of the contract between the colonial administration and Cotonfran, the administration maintained a certain quantity of production by the villages, and Cotonfran bought at least 80% of that production. The cotton was ginned locally, but no further transformation was permitted; all the cotton fiber was then exported to France. The colonial administration fixed the quantity of cotton produced and the price paid to the peasant producer on the basis of calculations furnished by Cotonfran of costs and expectations for the price of cotton on the world market. France reorganized village administration by replacing traditional chiefs with individuals more amenable to the colonial power, which assured the proper cultivation of the cotton crop and the collection of taxes. This system included forced labor and the subordination of growing food crops to cotton. Production In 1988, the entirety of Chad's cotton was produced in the five soudanian prefectures of Mayo-Kebbi, Tandjilé, Logone Occidental, Logone Oriental, and Moyen-Chari, plus the Bousso region of Chari-Baguirmi Prefecture, which juts down into the soudanian zone (see fig. 1). Few regions outside these prefectures offered sufficient water and population to sustain cotton production. Moreover, in this land of difficult transport, areas producing a cash crop also needed to be able to grow enough food for their people. Typically, the cultivation of cotton and food crops was carried on side by side. Efforts to extend the cultivation of cotton to the neighboring sahelian prefectures of Salamat and Guéra have had little success. In 1983 and 1984, with production at its highest in a decade, these two prefectures represented only .005% of total production. Suggestions also have been made from time to time to bring cotton production to the fertile borders of Lake Chad. Trials have shown the high yields possible there, estitil 1982 Chad's crop yields did not significantly exceed 500 kilograms per hectare; from 1983 to 1987, yields averaged almost 750 kilograms per hectare. Area under cotton cultivation reached a peak in 1963 of 3,389 square kilometres. From 1963 until the end of the 1970s, the area under cotton cultivation averaged 2,750 square kilometres. In the 1980s, however, the area has been consistently less than 2,000 square kilometres. By 1983 the area of land under cotton cultivation had dropped by 36% from the average during the 1960s and 1970s. Several sources estimated the area in southern Chad under cotton cultivation at 30 to 40% of all land in cultivation, and in some areas of Mayo-Kebbi Prefecture, it may have been higher (see table 3, Appendix A). Cotton production has exhibited wide swings. Factors such as climatic conditions, production prices, and civil strife have influenced production. The first crop to exceed 100,000 tons came in 1963, but the 1970s were the best years for production, which from 1971 to 1978 remained well above 100,000 tons per year. Chad reached its all-time record production in 1975. Production suffered from 1979 to 1982 because of the Chadian Civil War and hit a twenty-year low in 1981. In 1983, with the return of some political stability and higher market prices, production improved but then fell from 1984 to 1987, a reflection of declining world cotton prices. Once the crop is harvested, the producers must sort the cotton to separate lower quality yellow cotton from higher quality white cotton. Since the late 1970s, the proportion of white cotton generally has been 90% or more of total production. Going back to the 1960s, the quality of Chadian cotton had been consistently high, except for 1972 and 1973, when the proportion of yellow cotton rose to 18%. Since 1980 the quality has remained high at initial sorting, with white cotton representing more than 95% of the crop and accounting for 98% of production in 1984. Cotton production was 142.000 ton in 2014, 180.000 ton in 2015, 150.000 in 2016. Administration In 1989, the official structure responsible for the production and marketing of cotton was composed of the ONDR under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, of Cotontchad, and of the Cotton Price Stabilization Board (Caisse de Stabilisation des Prix du Coton—CSPC). Founded in 1965, the ONDR was originally given responsibility to monitor, improve, and assist all agricultural production. By the mid-1980s, however, the government's emphasis on cotton production made the ONDR an important factor for the cotton industry only. Cotontchad, successor to Cotonfran, was founded as a parastatal company in 1971 to collect, buy, gin, transport, and export the cotton crop. The company also had responsibility for elements of the small national textile, soap, and edible oil industries. The CSPC's task was to stabilize prices paid to peasant producers by funding operating losses incurred by Cotontchad. Assuring a constant price to the producer not only helped maintain a certain level of production for Cotontchad but also limited costs to the company by holding down producer prices. The ONDR, the CSPC, Cotontchad, and the government itself were involved in determining producer prices. In addition, the CSPC supported the program to improve yields. Between 1971 and 1983, an estimated 57% of all payments by the CSPC were made in conjunction with the program to improve cotton production. Other major actors in the cotton industry were the private banks, the French Textile Development Company (Compagnie Française pour le Développement des Textiles--CFDT), and French and EC institutions, as well as the World Bank. Private banks provided the credits necessary to Cotontchad and to the peasants to finance the opening of each planting season and especially to provide capital for the import and distribution of fertilizers and insecticides. The CFDT marketed Chad's cotton on the world market. The CFDT also contributed to the smooth operation of Cotontchad through technical agreements to maintain equipment and to provide expertise in improving cropping methods through the ONDR. In addition, the CFDT supported research carried out by the Cotton and Textile Research Institute (Institut de Recherche sur le Coton et les Textiles—IRCT), a small public research facility located near Doba. Subsidies to Chad's cotton production under the Lomé Convention were paid through the Stabex system (see Glossary) of the EEC. Those funds were channeled to the CSPC for price support to the producers. The CSPC also received portions of funds needed to assure payments to producers from Cotontchad as well as from the central government. Between 1971 and 1983, virtually all income to the CSPC derived from rebates paid by Cotontchad into the system. After 1984, the system became far more dependent on external sources of funds (such as Stabex) because of sharply reduced income to Cotontchad. In addition to Stabex, the EC's European Development Fund (EDF) contributed directly to the program of improving yields. French assistance remained crucial to the system. The Central Fund for Economic Cooperation (Caisse Centrale de Coopération Economique—CCCE) was a shareholder in Cotontchad, and the other arm of French foreign aid, the Cooperation and Aid Fund (Fonds d'Aide et de la Coopération—FAC), directed assistance to the southern zone in support of the cotton complex. FAC also provided direct assistance to the government, which, among other things, helped pay the salaries of officials and functionaries, especially those in the ONDR. Pricing Prices paid to Chad's cotton producers, the peasants of the southern soudanian zone, have risen slowly over the years. The structure included separate prices for white cotton and for yellow cotton. From 1971, when the distinction arose, to 1978, the price for white cotton was CFA F50 per kilogram (for value of the CFA F--see Glossary) and stayed at this level during much of the period of heavy civil conflict until 1982. From 1982 to 1985, the price increased steeply to CFA F100 per kilogram, at which point it had leveled by 1987, despite downward pressure because of the fall in world prices and a new program of cost reductions by Cotontchad under World Bank direction. The price paid for yellow cotton has not kept pace with this rise, reaching only CFA F40 per kilogram in 1983, where it remained through 1987. The price paid to the producer traditionally has not covered actual production costs, either for the peasant or for Cotontchad. As much as 50% of the costs of production has been borne by outside donors, primarily from the EDF, through the Stabex system. Between 1981 and 1984, the EDF financed between 70 and 80% of the costs of the program to improve yields, largely through subsidies to the CSPC for price support and subsidies for Cotontchad in the initial purchase of insecticides and fertilizers. The costs of improvements have been reimbursed only partially from payments made by producers through the ONDR. Restructuring the system By 1987, because world prices were still insufficient to recoup costs, Cotontchad was rapidly going broke. In the mid-1980s, annual net losses were estimated at CFA F18 billion. Net losses per kilogram of ginned cotton were estimated at CFA F453 in 1985 and CFA F298 in 1987. These figures stood in contrast to 1984, when there was a net profit of CFA F193 per kilogram. Cotontchad's position was not expected to improve unless the world price of cotton reached the CFA F600-per-kilogram range. With World Bank backing and support from France, the Netherlands, and the EC, restructuring of Cotontchad began in 1986 with government implementation of the Emergency Cotton Program. At the producer level, the program called for freezing the price paid producers at the CFA F100-per-kilogram level through 1988 and studying new methods of fixing producer prices to reflect world market conditions. Subsidies on improved inputs, such as fertilizer and insecticides, were eliminated as of 1987, with producers assuming the costs. Cotton production was to be limited to about 100,000 tons by restricting the area under production to 750 square kilometres during the program period. At the company level, Cotontchad sold nonessential assets to the private sector (including two aircraft and about 150 vehicles), closed its branch office in Bangui, Central African Republic, and laid off administrative staff. It also closed six ginneries and reduced the number of cotton collection centers in accordance with the production target of 100,000 tons. For its part, the government exempted Cotontchad from taxes, particularly export duties, and suspended its contributions to the CSPC, the ONDR, and the Debt Amortization Fund (Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement—CAA). Staffs at the CSPC and the ONDR were reduced, and the roles of both organizations were reviewed.

He was born in the town of Belalcázar, in the Department of Cauca, Colombia on August 10, 1908. He painted in several genres and techniques but mostly an impressionism style was seen in his works. Among his most important achievements was the creation of the first Visual Arts School of Painting in the city of Cali, Colombia. This school is currently part of the 'Instituto Departamental de Bellas Artes'. Biography Jesús María was a descendant of José María Espinosa (1796–1883), a painter and miniaturist known for his portraits of Antonio Nariño and of Simón Bolivar. As a youngster, Espinosa's paternal grandfather taught him how to paint; supported by him, Espinosa figured out a way to extract pigments from vegetables in order to give color to his first paintings. He was educated in the city of Popayán, Colombia and then began his formal study of painting at the Escuela de Bellas Artes, in the capital Bogotá. He took lessons from art teacher Roberto Pizano (1896–1929). In 1929, he was awarded a scholarship by the Colombian government and traveled to Paris to continue his studies in painting at the prestigious Académie Julian, under the direction of Paul Albert Laurens (1870–1934). When he returned to Colombia, he set up a small academy in the city of Cali. He met composer Antonio Maria Valencia (1902–1952) who suggested that Espinosa move his small academy of painting to the newly founded Cali's School of Fine Arts; then Espinosa founded the Visual Arts School in 1934. He died in the city of Cali, Colombia in 1995 at the age of 86. In 1933 Antonio María Valencia Zamorano, pianist and composer, who directed the Conservatory of Music in Cali, created by Resolution No 32 of the City Council, aims to start a School of Fine Arts and decides to call the young teacher Jesus Maria Espinosa, who was returning from Paris, after further studies art at one of the famous French art centers of the period: \\"The Academy JULIAN\\" conducted by Maestro Paul Albert Laurent. Before traveling to Paris, Espinosa studied painting in Fine Arts in Bogotá, under the direction of maestro Roberto Pizano. While there, in 1929 he won a government scholarship contest, which took him to Europe. In the opposite street of the Municipal Theater, now occupied by Pro- Arts, the art school was officially founded by Decree No. 98 of 1934 from the Government of Valle. It is named as founder and director of the same, Jesus Maria Espinosa Fernandez. He started painting classes and later brought Gerardo Navia a sculptor from Palmira. Shortly after, Matjasic Roko a Yugoslav artist moves from Chile to our school to teach the classes of mural and color theory. In the year 1939 the Fine Arts School of Music and Painting moved to the current location at the Centennial neighborhood. Espinosa is recognized nationally and internationally as an artist that mastered the technique of oil painting, and watercolor mural. Several of his disciples have emerged as important artists, including: Edgar Negret, Hernando Tejada, Otilia Hernandez, Labrada Bernardino, Hernando Polo, Daniel Romero, Luis Aragon, Gustavo Rojas, Marino Tenorio among others.

Upon returning to the United States in March 2013, Harroun was detained from March 28, 2013 to September 20, 2013 and charged with various offenses, before being released under a secret plea deal. Harroun died of an accidental drug overdose on 8 April 2014.  Early life and education  Eric Harroun was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado to Shirley Ann and Darryl Harroun. According to a Fox News article, while Harroun was a student at Pima Community College in Tucson in the fall of 2010, he began to identify himself as a Muslim, allegedly after becoming close to two Iraqi-American brothers he knew. However, Harroun denied this and said that his conversion to Islam was the result of studying the Middle East in general while he was in the 6th grade.  Career  Harroun joined the United States Army for three years, serving in the U.S. Army's 586th Engineering Company from 2000 to 2003, where he attained the rank of private first class,Fox News: US-born former Army vet known as 'The American' fights alongside Al Qaeda. March 11, 2013. but was never deployed overseas. He was discharged after a jeep crash at his base in Fort Riley, Kansas, which left him with a serious head injury, resulting in a metal plate being inserted into his head by doctors. According to his father Darryl, this caused his son to have exacerbated depression, mood swings, and other side effects. \\"He was already suffering from depression before that, and the accident just kind of multiplied it.\\" He visited Lebanon in May 2010, Prague in August 2010, and Egypt and Lebanon again during December 2010. In 2011, while still in Egypt, he took part in the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tahrir Square (allegedly being arrested and held at gunpoint by Hosni Mubarak's security forces), and finally visited Turkey in November 2012.  Activities in Syria  On January 7, 2013, Harroun crossed into Syria and made his way to the town of Azaz. He alleged he joined the 'Amr ibn al-'As brigade, a faction of the Free Syrian Army. On January 10, 2013 he was then sent on an attack on a Syrian army camp with a group of fellow fighters. In the confusion of the fighting he was separated from his group, most of whom he believes were killed. In the retreat, he jumped on the back of an Al-Nusra truck (unaware of which faction it belonged to) and was taken back to their base. Harroun later stated: : \\"I was separated from my unit in the fighting. I found these guys. I didn't even know they were al-Nusra until later. I said, 'I need a ride back to my commander.' It took 25 days to get them to give me a ride.\\" He alleges the Nusra front fighters initially treated him as a captive, although he later gained their trust and joined them in attacking Syrian army units, in which he may have killed as many as ten soldiers. However, he denied willingly fighting for the Al-Nusra Front (an offshoot of Al-Qaeda in Iraq), claiming it was done out of expediency. He posted many photographs and videos of his actions to social media sites (especially Facebook) showing himself handling various weapons (including RPGs and AK-47 assault rifles) and wearing military gear. In one video posted online, he addresses Syrian president Bashar al-Assad directly, telling him his \\"days are numbered\\". In another, he and his group of fighters claim victory for downing a helicopter. Many of these videos were swiftly picked up by the media and those following the conflict. After eventually getting back to the FSA base on February 6 (after nearly a month of fighting with the al-Nusra front) he discovered that his passport had been destroyed in a mortar attack. After posting photographs to Facebook showing he and several of his FSA comrades on February 6, he left Syria on February 10th, his commander requesting that he fetch weapons from Turkey and bring them back. However, he chose to remain in Turkey and to go back to Istanbul.  Aftermath  A pro-government YouTube channel claimed he had been killed, incorrectly identifying a fighter seen with him in a previous video as Harroun. However, in reply to an email sent to him by the Mail Online, Harroun stated: “Syrian Media must be smoking something because I am alive and well chilling in Istanbul having a martini at the moment.” He later claimed that “Getting into al-Nusra is not rocket science, it just takes brains.” He later did an interview around March 2, 2014 with two journalists working with FoxNews. However, the article later published on FOX (on March 11) about him stated he had descended into \\"Islamic fanaticism\\" and selectively used quotes from his Facebook page. A follow-up article was published three weeks later. He then visited the US consulate in Istanbul, worried that he would be labelled as a terrorist and in need of a new passport. When he went in, the FBI official had the first FOX news story printed on his desk. Harroun was interrogated for periods of several hours (by both an FBI and CIA official) over the course of two days. He later claimed that he had been set up by FOX News and that he would have to \\"hire a fucking Jewish lawyer to sue their asses when I get back\\". He denied he was affiliated with al-Qaeda in any way whatsoever: “I’m not Al-Qaeda. I like my beer and my smoke and I like my women. I’m not about the praying five times a day and all that shit.” = Arrest and charges = He later flew back into the United States on March 27, to Dulles Airport in Virginia, where he voluntarily had another discussion with FBI agents. He was later arrested on March 28 at a hotel. A ten-page criminal complaint was filed against him by the FBI, charging him with using a weapon of mass destruction outside of the United States. This charge carries the penalty of either death or life imprisonment if convicted. He appeared in court with his public defender in a hearing on April 8 in Alexandria (Virginia) and was denied bail. At the hearing, prosecutor Carter Burwell said it would be illegal for an American to travel to Syria and take up arms against Assad's government with any opposition group. This echoes what he was previously told by the FBI officer at the US consulate - which had led Harroun to previously remark that it was \\"bullshit\\" that an American couldn't fight in Syria. He was indicted by a federal grand jury on the additional charge of conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist group (which carries the maximum penalty of 15 years in prison) on June 20. He appeared in court again on July 8, and was ordered by the judge to remain in detention, pending trial. In court, Harroun's lawyer Geremy Kamens claimed he was confused when he claimed to have joined al-Nusra, wanted to avoid extremists, spoke little Arabic, and actually joined the al Nasser (Victory) brigade (an associate of Jabhat al-Nusra which is not classed as a terrorist organisation). However the prosecution successfully argued that the four confessions Harroun had made to journalists were sufficient evidence due to the fact that they corroborated factual information, stating that the towns Harroun said he had been in were also strongholds of the al-Nusra front. The magistrate also maintained that he saw the confession as legitimate.  Reception and reactions in the media  He had been compared to former US fighter Aukai Collins, who fought with the Chechen rebels, John Walker Lindh, who fought with the Taliban, and Matthew VanDyke, who fought with the Free Libyan Army. While some on social media sites set up Facebook pages designed to show support for Harroun and claiming his arrest is/was unjust, in the mainstream media Harroun was routinely referred to as having 'joined al- Qaeda', and some of his quotes were selectively used, as were photographs and videos posted by Harroun onto social media sites. However some writers such as Harold Maass emphasised the fact that Harroun had never been known to voice any anti-American or extremist sentiments (and had actually stated a hatred of al-Qaeda and extremism) and stated a belief that Harroun's error was to end up fighting with the wrong people, in a way which was ironically aligned with US government interests. Robert M. Chesney of the New York Times also shares the belief that Harroun was \\"fighting on the U.S. side, but with the wrong people.\\" James Joyner at Outside the Beltway also supported this narrative. He claimed that the charges were not sufficient to warrant Harroun's imprisonment for life. He described Harroun as being possibly \\"wacko\\", but also conceded that \\"based only on the reporting I've seen — he doesn't appear to be an al Qaeda sympathizer, much less a terrorist\\" and that \\"there's no evidence in the news reports that Harroun has engaged in terrorism or any anti-American activities. Harroun's father Darryl claims that his son was \\"100 percent American\\" and alleged that his son was working with the CIA during his time in Syria. He described him as \\"definitely not Al-Qaeda\\" and \\"very patriotic\\". He also stated that he didn't understand the charges, but believes his son would never ally himself with a group which was against the United States. He was unaware his son was in Syria from January to February. He alleged his son was always adventurous, to the extent that family and friends called him \\"Arizona Jones\\". According to the first FOX News article, Harroun's sister Sarah left an encouraging message on his Facebook wall, urging him to \\"keep fighting\\", and showing solidarity with both her brother and the Syrian people. Robert Young Pelton (founder of Dangerous magazine) stated in an article for Foreign Policy Magazine that Harroun was effectively \\"duped by the FBI into incriminating himself\\" due to his various postings about his activities on social media sites, and statements made to journalists and federal agents. Andrew J. Tabler, a specialist on Syria at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, stated that he had seen Harroun's online postings and also expressed concern at the time that they could cause problems for Harroun later on. He described Harroun as a war tourist and as pretty well-known to those following the Syrian war. “I saw those videos and thought, ‘Buddy, you better watch out” he said. In regard to his arrest and former charges, Harroun's federal public defender Geremy Kamens said Harroun's case is \\"unique in American law\\" in that, “Never, to my knowledge, has the U.S. government charged a U.S. citizen for fighting with a group aligned with U.S. interests.\\"  Release  On September 20, 2013, Harroun, under a plea deal, pleaded guilty to \\"an obscure law regulating munition exports\\" and was released from jail. He was sentenced to time served, under this secret plea bargain, in a move which generated surprise in the media. He later agreed to an interview with ABC15 Arizona, in which he defended himself against the charges he had faced and spoke at length about his time in Syria. Following his release from prison, Harroun reportedly suffered from depression and began drinking and using heroin. He was admitted into a hospital in December 2013 after being found in his bathroom with a syringe on the counter and having stopped breathing. Death On April 9, 2014, Eric's family posted on his Facebook page announcing his death a day earlier from an accidental overdose. Harroun’s autopsy revealed acute levels of heroin and sertraline, an antidepressant, in his body. Methamphetamine, amphetamine, codeine, and trazodone were also detected. The medical examiner ruled his death an accident. Harroun was looking forward to getting off of probation early and was planning to return to Syria once he was able to do so. He is survived by his father, mother, and sister.

Following the touring cycle for their 2011 release Hope, the band began writing material for their next album. They recorded Start the Party with A frontman Jason Perry acting as producer. Classed as a post-hardcore album, it revolves around party-going and was compared to the output of the Beastie Boys and the guitar work of the Foo Fighters and Papa Roach. Start the Party, which was preceded by a brief UK tour and the release of music videos for the title-track and \\"Running Scared\\", was eleased by independent label Cooking Vinyl on 21 January 2013. The artwork shows Dirty Sanchez stunt performer Matthew Pritchard crowd-surfing. Initial promotion consisted of a headlining UK tour, a European support slot for Yellowcard and appearances at the Soundwave festival in Australia. Music videos for \\"Radio\\" and \\"Take Away the Misery\\" were later released and The Blackout embarked upon a UK tour at the end of 2013. Background and production Independent record label Cooking Vinyl released The Blackout's third album Hope, which was crowd-funded through PledgeMusic, in April 2011. While writing it, the band had no funds, management or label to support them. They chose to continue working with Cooking Vinyl for Start the Party, which allowed them to focus on writing rather than on business issues. The band promoted Hope with two UK tours and appearances at the Reading & Leeds and Merthyr Rock festivals in late 2011. * First UK tour: * Second UK tour: * Reading and Leeds Festival: * Merthyr Rock festival: Shortly after the touring concluded, the band started writing new material. Spurred on by the positive reception of their previous tours, the group decided to incorporate this sensation into their new music. They aimed to release another album by September or October 2012. They recorded with A frontman Jason Perry and engineer Michael Morgan. John Mitchell mixed the recordings and Tom Baker mastered them at Precision. The group initially planned to feature musicians Andrew W.K. and Wes Borland of Limp Bizkit on the album. Vocalist Sean Smith said W.K. \\"doesn't party hard enough for The Blackout\\" while Borland's guitar solo was not required when they group realised they could use vocals instead. Composition Start the Party has been described as post-hardcore; its lyrics are about partying; according to Smith, \\"We just went 'What do we need right now, what does the world need?' and it’s just a party album because everyone is so fucking miserable at the moment\\". It was compared to a hip-hop- less version of the Beastie Boys, while the guitar work drew comparison to the music of Lostprophets, Papa Roach and A, and the early work of Foo Fighters. The record had less of an emphasis on screaming than the band's previous releases. The title track, which is also the album's opening track, is about enjoying life and having fun. Partway through the song, the band yell out each letter of the word \\"party\\". \\"Radio\\" is about musicians stealing the songs of other artists and passing them off as their own. \\"We Live On\\" talks about continuing through difficult times in one's life and never giving up. Butler and Smith said \\"Let Me Go\\" is about women being angry. \\"Take Away the Misery\\" leans on the group's hardcore punk roots with its guitar riffs and screaming vocals. \\"Keep Singing\\" is about fighting through life and enjoying things one likes; its melody and lyrics recall the work of Jimmy Eat World. The pop punk track \\"Running Scared\\" showcases Smith's vocal ability and is one of the album's most upbeat tracks. It is followed by the ballad \\"You\\", which is reminiscent of Brand New's music . \\"Free Yourself\\" returns to the Lostprophets-indebted guitar riffs that can be heard throughout the album; it talks about people living their own lives and not worrying about those of others. This is followed by \\"Sleep When You're Dead\\", which has an introduction that is similar to the work of AC/DC; Butler said the song is a homage to Dirty Sanchez stunt performer Matthew Pritchard and is named after a party boat he owned. The closing track \\"Throw It All Away\\" is about having and maintaining a positive outlook on life. Release The Blackout performing live in 2013. In August 2012, The Blackout performed at the Reading and Leeds Festivals, before headlining the Merthyr Rock Festival. On 17 September, Start the Party was announced for release the following January. As part of the announcement, the track listing and artwork were revealed, and a music video for \\"Start the Party\\" was released. The clip was filmed in Ibiza; Pritchard organized party boats to the island and invited the group to film there. The following day, the track was made available for free download through the group's website. The Blackout played a few shows in the UK in October. A music video for \\"Running Scared\\", which was directed by Sitcom Soldiers, was released on 22 November. It was also filmed in Ibiza and stars Smith, who is shown travelling around trying to find his bandmates. Start the Party was released through Cooking Vinyl on 21 January 2013; its artwork is an image of Pritchard crowd surfing. Vocalist Gavin Butler said he was looking through his Instagram feed and came across a photograph of Pritchard \\"in a thong drinking champagne out of a bottle on a snowmobile in the middle of Norway\\" and felt he embodied the spirit of partying. The physical deluxe edition included a DVD on the making of the album and live performances from their Reading & Leeds and Merthyr Rock appearances. The iTunes deluxe edition includes covers of \\"Boom! Shake the Room\\", \\"Super Freak\\" and \\"Sorry for Party Rocking\\" as bonus tracks. In January 2013, The Blackout went on a headlining UK tour, with support from Sonic Boom Six and Proxies. The band planned a series of acoustic performances at HMV record shops but HMV went into administration and the performances were later moved to the respective venues on the same day. The Blackout supported Yellowcard on their European tour in January and February before touring Australia in February and March as part of the Soundwave festival. Following this, the group headlined the Radstock and Takedown festivals. A music video for \\"Radio\\" on 2 April the same year. In August 2013, The Blackout performed at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. Footage from these appearances was used for the music video for \\"Take Away the Misery\\", which was released on 20 September. In October, the group went on the Final Party tour in the UK with support from Framing Hanley. Blitz Kids were due to support The Blackout but were replaced by Rat Attack. The tour was due to last into November but vocalist Gavin Butler had a recurrence of a hemiplegic migraine, which resulted in the cancellation of several dates. The dates were rescheduled for January and February 2014, and had LostAlone and Rat Attack as the supporting acts. Reception Start the Party received generally positive reviews from music critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Rock Hard editor Jens Peters noted the two vocalists \\"cover[ed] the entire range from nasty hardcore shouting to melodic rock\\" with \\"a knack for catchy melodies and singable hooks\\". Islington Gazette writer Stephen Moore found it \\"a surprisingly sustained set\\" with its \\"well-used combo of pop structures, catchy melodies, [and] heart-on-sleeve lyrics\\". Butler's \\"accessible mid- Atlantic vocals and this clutch of fist-pumping tunes could turn The Blackout into stars\\". South Wales Argus reviewer Andy Howells said the band \\"get 2013 off to a cracking start with a throat blistering, mosh moving collection\\". Renee Jones of The Music said the group \\"shift away from their previous work to create a combination of catchy choruses and cheesy, fairly generic ... sounds\\" with every song \\"aiming for the obvious – a party-rock vibe\\". Dead Press! writer Laurence Kellett noted the \\"refined change\\", resulting in a \\"fine-tuned, polished album\\", which he said could \\"greatly benefit from the party rock ... attitude\\" of their prior material. The Crack RM said The Blackout come across as \\"the Scrappy Doo of rock: relentless and yappy with it\\", and added the album \\"sounds like The Beastie Boys ... with the hip-hop and bratty humour surgically removed\\". DIY contributor Greg Inglis said if the group removed all of the expletives \\"then there would be more potential singles here than a David Guetta and Calvin Harris combined Greatest Hits LP\\". According to Inglis, the record's \\"crux\\" lies in the \\"many individually solid tracks that are hummable in isolation but blend into uniformity over the course of an album\\". Cherwell Isabel Stoppani De Berrie criticised the album as being for teenagers who would \\"probably best enjoy this live and drunken, before they’re old enough to realise how very insincere it all sounds\\". Andy Baber of musicOMH found it difficult to figure out what the members were \\"doing most of the time\\" and said \\"the album just sounds like the same guitar riffs recycled, with the distortion merging them all into one\\". Thrash Hits writer Tom Doyle wrote it \\"feels like an album made by a band rehashing ideas from their youth to appeal to their indefatigable but relentlessly young fanbase\\".

Copyright Office, p1861 Plot summary The story is set in July 1966. The US Treasury is concerned about the enormous extent of counterfeit $5 bills in circulation. A minor operative in the counterfeiting group based in Mexico steals $500,000 worth of counterfeit money [~$3.6 million in 2013] and flies to a pre-arranged meeting with gang members on the US side of the border with Mexico. He is killed as his plane crashes before he makes contact and the wreckage is discovered by US police. AXE chief, David Hawk, summons US secret agent, Nick Carter, to a meeting with the CIA in San Diego. They discuss the Serpent Party – a new political party in Mexico – whose manifesto calls for the return of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California to Mexico which is suspected of printing and distributing counterfeit money to support their activities. CIA surveillance of the Chinese nuclear submarine fleet reveals that one of them is missing; it is suspected of bringing in supplies of quality printing paper to the counterfeiters. Immediately after the briefing Carter embarks on a US Navy submarine (USS Homer S. Jones) to take him to the Mexican coast with orders to smash the counterfeiting operation. He makes his way on foot inland toward Durango. Posing as an itinerant gold miner he stops at a deserted gold mine near Cosala and discovers the body of a recently killed former SS member. Continuing his cover as a gold panner Carter is approached by Gerda von Rothe. She is expecting to meet the SS man whom she intends to hire to murder several of her business acquaintances in her nearby castle. Believing Carter to be an itinerant she hires him instead and tells him to come secretly to the castle at midnight. Shortly afterwards, Carter is captured by El Tigre – a Mexican bandit covertly funded by the CIA. El Tigre informs Carter that his men saw Maxwell Harper (Gerda's business partner) kill the SS man. Carter persuades El Tigre to help him enter and destroy the castle. Gerda tells Carter that he must kill Harper and Hurtado (a Chinese spy working for Harper) who are using her castle as the base for printing the counterfeit money. She hides Carter in a secret passage in the library and sets up a fake meeting with Harper and Hurtado. At an arranged time, Gerda will leave the library allowing Carter to emerge from the secret hiding place and shoot the two men. During the meeting, Hurtado reveals that he knows Harper is a double agent – working for China and Russia, which is why the Serpent Party and counterfeit distribution are not doing as well as expected. Harper shoots Hurtado. Instead of killing Harper, Carter escapes down the secret passage into the depths of the castle. Carter discovers the rat-eaten skeletons of four men chained up in the castle dungeons – the remains of the former lovers of Gerda van Rothe. Nearby Carter finds the printing presses for the counterfeit banknotes. He destroys the printing plates and frees the captive print workers. Gerda's private guards kill all of the Chinese soldiers running the counterfeiting operation. Carter destroys two Chinese mini submarines used to distribute the counterfeit notes and calls for support from the USS Homer S. Jones. Unable to escape, Carter is captured. Gerda ties Carter to her bed while Erma tortures him. Gerda cuts Carter free and forces herself on him. Gerda explains that she used to be a member of the Hitler Youth. She and her parents escaped to Mexico after World War II with genuine printing plates for US banknotes secretly obtained by the Abwehr. Unable to use them for years due to a lack of proper paper, she recently teamed up with Chinese spies to produce counterfeit money to support the Serpent Party and destabilize the US economy. In the throes of passion Carter slips his cyanide suicide pill into Gerda's mouth. Gerda dies. A wounded Harper bursts into the bedroom and is shot by Erma. Carter fights Erma and she falls to her death from the bedroom window. El Tigre and his men attack the castle as pre-arranged with Carter. Carter allows the bandits to loot the castle. Carter returns to the USS Homer S. Jones which rams and sinks the Chinese nuclear submarine Sea Dragon before returning to San Diego.

The type of level and choice of units indicate the scaling of the logarithm of the ratio between the quantity and it reference value, though a logarithm may be considered to be a dimensionless quantity. The reference values for each type of quantity are often specified by international standards. Power and field levels are used in electronic engineering, telecommunications, acoustics and related disciplines. Power levels are used for signal power, noise power, sound power, sound exposure, etc. Field levels are used for voltage, current, sound pressure. Power level Level of a power quantity, denoted LP, is defined by :L_P = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\log_{\\\\mathrm{e}}\\\\\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\frac{P}{P_0}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\!~\\\\mathrm{Np} = \\\\log_{10}\\\\\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\frac{P}{P_0}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\!~\\\\mathrm{B} = 10 \\\\log_{10}\\\\\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\frac{P}{P_0}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\!~\\\\mathrm{dB}. where *P is the power quantity; *P0 is the reference value of P.

If the power quantity P is proportional to F2, and if the reference value of the power quantity, P0, is in the same proportion to F02, the levels LF and LP are equal. The neper, bel, and decibel (one tenth of a bel) are units of level that are often applied to such quantities as power, intensity, or gain. The neper, bel, and decibel are related by *; *. Standards Level and its units are defined in ISO 80000-3. The ISO standard defines each of the quantities power level and field level to be dimensionless, with . This is motivated by simplifying the expressions involved, as in systems of natural units. Related quantities =Logarithmic ratio quantity= Power and field quantities are part of a larger class, logarithmic ratio quantities. ANSI/ASA S1.1-2013 defines a class of quantities it calls levels. It defines a level of a quantity Q, denoted LQ, as :L_Q = \\\\log_r\\\\\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\frac{Q}{Q_0}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\!, where *r is the base of the logarithm; *Q is the quantity; *Q0 is the reference value of Q. For the level of a root-power quantity, the base of the logarithm is . For the level of a power quantity, the base of the logarithm is . =Frequency level= Frequency level of a frequency f is the logarithm of a ratio of the frequency f to a reference frequency f. The reference frequency is C, four octaves below middle C. In electronics, the octave (oct) is used as a unit with logarithm base 2, and the decade (dec) is used as a unit with logarithm base 10: : L_f = \\\\log_2 \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\frac{f}{f_0} \\\\right) ~\\\\text{oct} = \\\\log_{10} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\frac{f}{f_0} \\\\right) ~\\\\text{dec}. In music theory, the octave is a unit used with logarithm base 2 (called interval). A semitone is one twelfth of an octave. A cent is one hundredth of a semitone.

He was president of the Chinese Medical Association from 2005 to 2009 and is currently the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Thoracic Disease. He is a recipient of Order of the Republic, the highest order of honor of China. Zhong earned international fame for managing the SARS outbreak and was renowned for refuting the official line which downplayed the severity of the crisis. He was voted one of China's top 10 scientists in 2010. During the COVID-19 pandemic which originated in Wuhan, Hubei, he was an advisor in managing the crisis. Zhong was included on Times list of the world's 100 most influential people in 2020.  Early life and education  Zhong was born on 20 October 1936 at the Central Hospital in Nanjing, though his family was from Xiamen, Fujian. He was educated at Beijing Medical University, where he finished his residency training in internal medicine. Zhong completed further training at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London and the University of Edinburgh Medical School between 1979 and 1981, graduating from the University of Edinburgh Medical School with an MD in 1981.  Career  Zhong became president of the Chinese Thoracic Society in 2000 and became president of the Chinese Medical Association in 2005. He is currently the director of the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases and editor-in-chief of the Journal of Thoracic Disease. Zhong discovered the relationship between protein malnutrition and COPD, and has developed a calibrated formula on energy consumption for patients with COPD. = SARS outbreak = When Zhong directed the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases, they received the second case of a SARS patient as early as 20 December 2002. Over the next month, 28 similar cases were reported in Zhongshan alone, and on 21 January 2003, Zhong and other doctors and researchers in related fields reported this disease at an emergency meeting and gave it the name atypical pneumonia. On 28 January 2003, Zhong felt sick and discovered that he had caught pneumonia. Concerned that the news that a leading researcher and doctor for respiratory diseases falling ill during the SARS outbreak would cause fear and panic for the general public, Zhong decided to not receive treatment in the hospital. Instead he returned home, hoping that it was not caused by SARS and that he could recover without treatment. With care from his wife, Li Shaofen, he managed to recover after eight days. After recovery he immediately returned to the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases to direct the fight against SARS. On 11 February 2003, at a press conference held by the Guangdong Department of Health, Zhong explained the disease and its symptoms, and calmed the public by asserting that it was \\"preventable\\" and \\"curable\\". Zhong, for the first time while treating SARS patients, employed non-invasive ventilation methods that increased the amount of oxygen that the patients could take in and alleviated pain. Zhong also insisted on proposing the use of cortisone for the treating of patients experiencing severe conditions, which significantly lowered the death rate of severe patients to 13% and decreased the total treatment time. The decision to use cortisone was politically controversial at the time. In February 2003 the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention had already published the authoritative view that normal Chlamydiae was the direct cause of atypical pneumonia and, as a result, the only legally prescribed way of treating SARS patients was to use antibiotics. Based on observations of hundreds of patients in Guangdong, Zhong was determined to advocate for the moderate usage of cortisone. Zhong said later in an interview that he knew this might bring dishonor and defamation, but he persisted because he trusted in his observations and scientific judgements regarding the disease. With the support of the Guangdong government and the positive results in Guangdong in the treating of SARS disease, Zhong's method was later used as the standard protocol for treating all SARS patients in China. When delegates led by Dr. Evans from the World Health Organization visited China in early April, Zhong presented the characteristics of SARS as well as the treatment and prevention method in China. Zhong's presentation was well-received and his methods were adopted around the world. = COVID-19 = In early January 2020, Zhong visited Wuhan, in response to a growing cluster of then-unidentified pneumonia cases, and was reassured by city health officials that the disease was controllable and preventable. On January 20, however, he returned to Wuhan, to re-evaluate the situation, and came to the conclusion that the novel coronavirus was more transmissible than previously identified, and warned the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Partyhttps://www.npr.org/2020/04/15/835308147/meet-dr-zhong-nanshan-the- public-face-of-the-covid-19-fight-in-china that authorities in Wuhan were likely understating the severity of the outbreak, and on the same day, publicly announced on state television the same. In later reporting of his state TV broadcast he recommended that \\"a quarantine period of 10 days to two weeks is very effective, so there will not be a large-scale infection as people travel back from their holidays.\\" but also concluded with the prediction that \\"the virus outbreak may recede in a week to 10 days.\\"  Honors  ; Awards and Prizes :* 2020: Order of the Republic :* 2016: Guanghua Engineering Science and Technology Prize :* National Award for Advances in Science and Technology, China (1997)Curriculum Vitae of Nan-Shan ZHONG (PDF). 澳門科技大學. 2013 [2020-02-09]. :* National Role Model of Labors (2005) :* WAO Awards for Distinguished Recognition (2007) ; Paper of the Year :*The Lancet; 2008: The editorial board praised Zhong and his team, as they \\"clarified that carbocisteine can prevent the worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and can improve life at an affordable price, which is of great significance to developing countries.\\" (Note: The editorial board selected six papers for readers to vote, and announced two winners, one selected by the editorial board and one with the highest reader votes.

Due to the nature of the high-energy beam of electrons used to image a sample in an electron microscope, microscopists have long observed that specimens are routinely changed or damaged by the electron beam. Starting in the 1960s, and using transmission electron microscopes (TEMs), scientists made deliberate attempts to modify materials while the sample was in the specimen chamber, and to capture images through time of the induced damages. Also in the 1960s, materials scientists using TEMs began to study the response of electron- transparent metal samples to irradiation by the electron beam. This was in order to understand more about metal fatigue during aviation and space flight. The experiments were performed on instruments with high accelerating voltages; the image resolution was low compared to the sub-nanometer resolution available with modern TEMs. Improvements in electron microscopy from the 1960s onwards focused on increasing the spatial resolution. This required increased stability for the entire imaging platform, but particularly for the area around the specimen stage. Improved image-capture systems using charge-coupled device cameras and advances in specimen stages coupled with the higher resolution led to creating systems devoted to applying stimuli to samples in specialized holders, and capturing multiple frames or videos of the samples' responses. In addition to materials samples, in situ electron microscopy is performed on biological specimens, and is used to conduct experiments involving mechanical, chemical, thermal, and electrical responses. Early experiments mostly used TEMs, because the image is captured in a single frame, whereas the scanning electron microscope must move or scan across the sample while the stimuli is being applied, altering the sample. Early problems that limited in situ electron microscopy included mechanical vibration at all scales (from the microscope itself to the sample), and thermal and electrical interference, particularly at the specimen holder. These problems all required fast capture times. However a fast capture time creates an image with a low signal-to-noise ratio, limits the resolution of the image, and also limits the amount of time available for conducting the experiment.

The book was originally published by Mars Productions in 1993 and republished by Simon & Schuster for adults in 1996. The novel is regarded to be the genesis of the modern urban-fiction/street-lit movement that would later gain momentum in 1999 with the publication of Sister Souljah's The Coldest Winter Ever. Summary Flyy Girl is African-American coming-of-age story that follows Tracy Ellison from her sixth-birthday party in 1977 to her 17th birthday. Tracy grows up in the middle-class Philadelphia suburb of Germantown. The daughter of a dietitian and pharmacist, Tracy is beautiful, intelligent, and armed with self-esteem and a sassy mouth. Tracy is also boy crazy, which leads to sex in the indulgent, hip-hop 1980s and the effects of the cocaine economy flourishing in black communities.  Sequels  Tyree wrote two sequels to Flyy Girl: For the Love of Money (2001) and Boss Lady (2006). Both were published by Simon & Schuster.  Film adaptation  In July 2013, Lionsgate Entertainment's CodeBlack Films had acquired the rights to Flyy Girl with hopes of transforming the novel into a feature film. In February 2015, CodeBlack Films announced that Dear White People producer Effie Brown was hired to produce a film adaptation of the novel. Brown and her company, Duly Noted Inc., will oversee the film's development alongside Codeblack Films' Jeff Clanagan and Quincy Newell.

Roger Boutet de Monvel (4 December 1879 – 25 December 1951) was a French writer of historical studies and magazine articles on fashion and other topics.  Biography  Born in the 4th arrondissement of Paris, Roger Boutet de Monvel was the oldest son of Maurice Boutet de Monvel (1850–1913), a painter and illustrator of children's books. His brother was Bernard was also an artist. He was raised in Paris and in Nemours, where his maternal grandparents owned a house. He often served as a model for his father; for example, his silhouette appears in his father's illustrations for Anatole France's Nos enfants, which also has an entire chapter about him. After he finished his education, Boutet de Monvel took a position as secretary to the director of the Imprimerie nationale. He began publishing articles in the early 1900s, at first usually in collaboration with his father or brother. His first major work, a historical study entitled Les variétés (The Variety Shows), was published in 1905 by Plon, which would remain his publisher for most of his career. Later historical studies took as their themes the upper social classes of France, the life of St. Francis of Assisi, and the writers Lord Byron and Miguel de Cervantes. In 1911, he took a job at the Carnavalet Museum in conservation. He joined the armed forces during the First World War but was discharged early on due to a leg injury. Beginning in 1917, he published several books with war-related themes, including Carnet d'un permissionnaire (Notebook from a Soldier on Leave, 1917), Le bon anglais (The Good Englishman, 1918) and Nos frères d'Amériques (Our American Brothers, 1918). Something of a dandy, Boutet de Monvel was engaged with the fashion industry in various ways. In 1912, he began writing for the Gazette du Bon Ton, a leading fashion magazine of the day, and shortly became a regular contributor. In 1915 he attended the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco as a representative from the French fashion industry. The following year, he wrote promotional copy for designer Paul Poiret. After the war, he returned to writing about fashion in Gazette du Bon Ton as well as in magazines like Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, and Monsieur. He died in the 8th arrondissement of Paris on Christmas Day 1951. He left a set of unpublished memoirs that he had been working on since the late 1930s.

An Irish immigrant living in 1920s Atlantic City, New Jersey, she is the mistress and eventual wife of Atlantic County treasurer and crime boss Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Thompson (Steve Buscemi). Fictional character biography Born Margaret Catherine Sheila Rohan circa 1893 in County Kerry, Ireland, she was raised in a poor Catholic family, headed by her alcoholic father. She lived in Templenoe and was nicknamed \\"Peg.\\" She becomes pregnant as a teenager by her employer's son, and her family sends her to the Magdalene Asylum. Desperate to escape, she steals her brother Eamonn's (Tony Curran) inheritance and uses it to emigrate to America. She departed from Galway on 27 September 1909 and landed in America on 12 October. She miscarried during the voyage. Some time afterwards, she married Hans Schroeder (Joseph Sikora), with whom she had two children, Teddy and Emily. Schroeder is an abusive alcoholic who beats her, which motivates her to join the Woman's Christian Temperance League and campaign for the passage of the Volstead Act, which ushers in Prohibition. =Season one= In the pilot episode, Margaret is pregnant with her third child. Fearing that Hans will drink their family into poverty, she goes to Nucky and asks him to give Hans a job. Nucky is immediately taken with her and promises to help, and gives her some money. Hans finds the money, gambles it away, and subsequently beats her so badly that she has a miscarriage. Angered, Nucky orders his brother Eli (Shea Whigham) and his deputy Ray Halloran (Adam Mucci) to kill Hans. They abduct him off the street and escort him into a boat that is then piloted out to sea, whereupon they beat him to death and dump his body in the ocean. When it is recovered the following day by fishermen, he is posthumously framed for a hijacking committed by Nucky's protegé Jimmy Darmody (Michael Pitt) and Al Capone (Stephen Graham). After Margaret recovers, Nucky gets her a job as a salesgirl at a boutique. Margaret and Nucky become close, with Nucky particularly impressed by her willingness to stand up to his associate Senator Walter Edge (Geoff Pierson) during a discussion about women's suffrage. One night, she notices Nucky's alderman Jim Neary (Robert Clohessy) supervising the unloading of a beer truck nearby her house and, when Nucky brushes aside her request for help to the Temperance League, tells Prohibition officer Nelson Van Alden (Michael Shannon) where the beer is being delivered. Nucky is struck by her courage, and they become lovers. Following a tense exchange at the boutique with Nucky's former mistress, Lucy Danziger (Paz de la Huerta), Margaret quits her job. Margaret enjoys her newfound affluence and appreciates having a father figure for her children, but is troubled by Nucky's corruption. One night, when Eli gets shot during a robbery of one of Nucky's illegal casinos, Nucky asks Margaret to retrieve a ledger from a safe; the ledger details Nucky's profits from bootlegging. Shortly thereafter, she is with Nucky when two of the D'Alessio brothers attempt to assassinate him on the boardwalk. While Eddie deflects the would-be shooter's gun away from Nucky, the gun goes off and mortally wounds another woman who collapses onto Margaret, the blood staining Margaret's new dress. A few days later, Van Alden visits her home and tells her that Nucky had her husband killed, and that she is risking her soul by being with him. This revelation leaves her unsure of Nucky's true feelings for her; her doubts grow worse when she realizes that he is using her connection to the Temperance League to shore up political support among female voters, and sees him talking to a former mistress. She ends the relationship after she and Nucky have an intense argument, in which he tacitly admits having her husband killed. Margaret learns that, years before, Nucky's infant son had died of pneumonia and that his wife had committed suicide. She meets with him and expresses her sympathy, and he tells her that his time with her and the children had been the happiest of his life. Moved by Nucky's sincerity – and realizing that her family would likely starve without his support – Margaret renews the relationship, and rings in the new year at his side. =Season two= A few months later, Margaret and her children are living with Nucky in a palatial house in Margate, New Jersey. Nucky has informally adopted Teddy and Emily, asking them to call him Dad. Their idyll is threatened when Nucky is arrested for electoral fraud, with bribery and murder charges on the horizon. Margaret goes to Nucky's office, which is being searched by the New Jersey State Police, and steals the incriminating ledger to protect Nucky. She also accepts temporary guardianship of his real estate holdings to keep it out of the government's reach. When Nucky and Eli get into a violent argument at Nucky's house, Margaret forces Eli out at gunpoint. Margaret learns that her brother and sisters are living in Brooklyn. She visits and tries to reconnect with them, but her brother forbids her to contact them again. She returns home deeply depressed, and sleeps with Nucky's right hand man Owen Sleater (Charlie Cox) to numb the pain. When Emily contracts polio, Margaret blames herself, believing that her daughter's illness is divine retribution. She is subpoenaed by Assistant US Attorney Esther Randolph (Julianne Nicholson) to testify against Nucky, and considers doing so to atone for her sins, even if it means sending Nucky to the electric chair. Nucky tells her that he wants to marry her and become a better man, while admitting that the marriage would benefit him by making her ineligible to testify against him. She is unsure of what to do until she sees him teaching Emily to walk in her leg braces; she realizes that he loves her and her children, and marries him the following day after making a full confession to her parish priest. Her protection from testifying – and the sudden murders of the witnesses against Nucky – destroys Randolph's case, and the US Attorney's Office is forced to drop the charges. The next morning at breakfast, Nucky tells her that he had \\"run into\\" Jimmy, with whom he had been feuding, and reconciled with him. When he tells her that Jimmy had re-enlisted in the Army, Margaret reads between the lines and realizes that Nucky personally killed him. To punish him, Margaret deeds the real estate Nucky had given her – which he had planned to use for a lucrative construction deal – to her parish. =Season three= By the third season, set 16 months later, Margaret and Nucky's marriage has fallen apart; the rare occasions in which they spend time together are spent arguing. The already tense situation worsens when Margaret sees Nucky with his mistress, Billie Kent (Meg Chambers Steedle). When she, Nucky and the children spend Easter Sunday with Eli and his family, she confides in her sister-in-law June (Nisi Sturgis) that she is unhappy. Margaret busies herself with philanthropic causes, having funded an entire new wing of a hospital with the land she donated to the church. When one patient miscarries right in front of her, Margaret appeals to the chief of medicine to provide better prenatal care, but he dismisses her concerns. She shows him up in front of the Bishop in charge of the Catholic hospital, and forces the chief of medicine to set up a class on reproductive health. However, Margaret faces difficulty from the head nun, who tries to censor the information the doctor teaching the class gives to patients. Ultimately, the hospital board orders the classes cancelled. Nucky's war with New York gangster Gyp Rosetti (Bobby Cannavale) and an impending indictment from the Attorney General's Office frequently keep him away from home, and he tells Owen to watch over Margaret and the children. She and Owen renew their affair, and he tells her that he wants to run away with her. When Margaret learns that she is pregnant with Owen's child, she tells him she will leave with him when the time is right. Soon afterward, however, Owen is sent to New York in an attempt to kill Rosetti's boss, Joe Masseria (Ivo Nandi). The hit fails and Owen's dead body is shipped back to Nucky's hotel suite in a box. Margaret bursts into tears at the sight of Owen's body, leading Nucky to realize the affair the two had been having, but nevertheless arranges for her and the children to hide from Masseria's men. Margaret leaves Atlantic City with the children and moves to Brooklyn under her maiden name. There, she has an abortion. Nucky tracks her down and tries to convince her to come back home where they can have a fresh start. Margaret declines his offer, and refuses to accept any money from him. =Season four= By season four, set in 1924, Margaret is working as a secretary in an investment office. She earns extra money by helping her boss trick customers into investing in worthless properties. She has an awkward reunion with Nucky, who gives her a present for Teddy and tells her that his butler, Eddie Kessler (Anthony Laciura), has committed suicide. She is badly shaken to find Nucky's associate Arnold Rothstein (Michael Stuhlbarg) in her boss' office, investing under another name. He pays her $100 to keep quiet. When Rothstein learns that Margaret's boss is conning him, he arranges to set her up in a new apartment in return for inside information on the deal. =Season five= Season five opens in 1931, with Margaret still working at the investment office, which has been hit hard by the Great Depression. After her boss commits suicide, the company's owners find evidence of her deal with Rothstein, putting her job in jeopardy. She goes to Rothstein's widow, Carolyn (Shae D'lyn), to ask for help; Carolyn instead threatens to publicly reveal Margaret's ties to Nucky unless she gives her the profits from Rothstein's illegal stock trade. Desperate, Margaret goes to see Nucky for the first time in years. He agrees to help, but she suspects that he is up to something. Sure enough, Nucky gives her the money to pay Carolyn off - on the condition that she set up an account for him for use in driving down the stock price of a competitor, Mayflower Grain Inc. When Mayflower's stock plunges, one of the firm's partners, Joseph Kennedy (Matt Letscher), shows up at her office demanding answers. She advises Kennedy to short sell the stock, thus making a huge profit for himself and Nucky. Impressed, Kennedy gives her a share of the profits and offers to start a partnership with her. Newly rich, she meets one last time with Nucky, slow dancing with him as they say goodbye.

Brian (2008) \\"Paul-Henry Chombart De Lauwe: Catholicism, Social Science, and Democratic Planning\\" in French Politics, Culture and Society, Vol. 26, No. 3 Biography In the 1930s, Paul-Henry Chombart de Lauwe studied sculpture and philosophy at the École des Beaux-Arts, where he also became interested in ethnology and sociology. After graduating in philosophy, he first worked in Cameroun, but in 1937 returned to France to absolve the compulsory military service. After the defeat of the French army in 1940, he first fled to North Africa but returned to France after the armistice, where he cooperated with the Resistance. In 1942 he fled again via Spain to North Africa, and joined the Allied air force as a fighter pilot. The postwar housing shortage raised Chombart de Lauwe's interest in urban sociology. In 1950 he established the Groupe d'ethnologie sociale to study the social history of Paris. Based on this research, he proposed significant changes to the planning of Paris, including public access to the city's monuments, avoiding the segregation of residential and industrial land uses - a mantra of modernist urban planning at the time, and public engagement in urban renewal projects.

It includes five species which are all obligate commensals of sea urchins. They are found in the southern Atlantic and Antarctic Oceans, with the exception of Waldo arthuri which is found in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Taxonomy A live adult brooding Waldo arthuri shown among the spines of its host, the sea urchin Brisaster latifrons. Embryos are visible as the white mass within the transparent shell. The genus Waldo belongs to the family Galeommatidae in the order Veneroida. It was named in honor of Waldo L. Schmitt, a prominent American carcinologist. The genus was first established by the American malacologist David Nicol in 1966 based on the type species Lepton parasiticus recovered from Antarctica and first described in 1876 by the American malacologist William Healey Dall. The genus was revived and revised in 2002 by the Argentinean malacologists Diego G. Zelaya and Cristián F. Ituarte. Description Members of the genus Waldo have small shells (less than in length) that are ovate to trapezoidal in shape. The shells are extremely thin and fragile and can be translucent or opaque. The shell sculpture consists of commarginal grooves (striae), though weakly to moderately-defined radial ribs may also be present. The hinges of the shells have narrow plates that lack teeth (edentate) with internal ligaments. The outer organic layer of the shell (the periostracum) can be thin to thick, and translucent to white in coloration. The mantle covers most of the outer shell surface and possesses small rounded protuberances (papillae). The mantle also has long, slender tentacles that extend well past the shell margin. The foot is elongated and thin, and triangular to cylindrical in shape. The heel of the foot may be strong to absent, with one demibranch (gill plate) on each side. Ecology and life cycle All members of the genus Waldo are believed to be obligate commensal epibionts of echinoids (sea urchins). Adults are actively mobile, crawling freely about the external surfaces of their hosts with their large feet, much like snails. They use their tentacles to grasp and navigate between the spines of heir hosts. Like most clams, Waldo species are hermaphroditic. And like other galeommatoideans, they brood their young, protecting them within their gills. When they are old enough to fend for themselves, the parents will deposit them on the same sea urchin they are currently living in. They lack a free-swimming pelagic larval phase. Species and distribution With the exception of Waldo arthuri, all members of the genus are found in the southern Atlantic and Antarctic Oceans. Waldo arthuri is found in an entirely separate oceanic basin, the northeastern Pacific Ocean, where it lives in a commensal relationship with the heart urchin Brisaster latifrons. This widely disparate distribution range is unusual for the genus because of the aforementioned lack of a pelagic larval phase for members of the genus. The genus includes five species. They are the following: *Waldo arthuri Valentich- Scott, Ó Foighil, & Li, 2013 *Waldo digitatus Zelaya & Ituarte, 2013 *Waldo parasiticus (Dall, 1876) *Waldo paucitentaculatus Zelaya & Ituarte, 2013 *Waldo trapezialis Zelaya & Ituarte, 2002 References External links Category:Galeommatidae Category:Molluscs described in 2013 Category:Bivalve genera ","title":"Waldo (bivalve)"},{"id":"40000271","text":"Qunb is a cloud-based internet service startup which provides a data visualization service.

Function  SLX4 interacting protein (SLX4IP) exists in a monomeric form, and interacts with the SLX4-XPF-ERCC1 multiprotein complex, which is responsible for the assembly of a Holliday junction resolvase in the role of DNA repair and maintenance. SLX4IP has been shown to directly interact with the N-terminal end of the SLX4 protein, which plays a role in the coordination of multiple different DNA structure-specific endonucleases. SLX4IP has also been shown to be involved in the control of alternative lengthening of telomeres, through its accumulation and interactions with the SLX4, BLM and XPF proteins.  Location and expression  The SLX4IP gene is located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 20 at position 12.2 (20p12.2). The human SLX4IP gene contains 14 exons, with the cDNA being 204,000 base pairs orientated on the plus strand. This codes for a protein of 408 amino acids with a molecular mass of 45,552 Daltons. Homologs of the SLX4IP gene have been found to be conserved in several non-human species including mice, rats, frogs, chickens, dogs, rhesus monkeys and chimpanzees. Orthologs for the human SLX4IP gene have also been identified in 283 other organisms. The SLX4IP protein is expressed at its highest level in the skin and the testis, along with being expressed in 26 other tissues.  Clinical significance  = Cancer =  Acute lymphoblastic leukemia  Somatic and monoallelic deletions of the 5’ region of SLX4IP was shown to occur in 30% of patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and in cases of ETV6/RUNX1-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia, deletions were found in greater than 60% of cases. By analyzing the breakpoints of SLX4IP, characteristic illegitimate V(D)J mediated recombination was revealed. These deletions were found to be significantly biased towards the male gender.  Alternative lengthening of telomeres  In order for cancer cells to retain their ability to proliferate without limitations, they can regulate the telomeres of their chromosomes by recombination via a process known as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). This recombination has been shown to require the accumulation of SLX4IP at ALT telomeres due to its antagonization of promiscuous BLM activity. BLM is responsible for the extension of telomeres as it is a RecQ helicase vital to homologous recombination and DNA replication. = Interstrand crosslink repair = In DNA, Interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are required to be repaired due to their high toxicity, often leading to diseases such as Fanconi anaemia. SLX4IP plays a role in the ICL repair functionality of the SLX4-XPF-ERCC1 complex, due to its simultaneous binding of both SLX4 and XPF-ERCC1, which maintains the stability of the complex and promotes interaction between the SLX4 and the XPF-ERCC1 regions. When SLX4IP was depleted from treated cells, they were found to accumulate in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle where the resolution of holiday junctions during ICL repair regularly occurs. = HIV-1 = The HIV-1 auxiliary protein Vpr potently stops the host cells progression through its natural cycle at the G2/M transition stage. This arrest was found to be caused from its premature activation of the SLX4 structure-specific endonuclease complex, which SLX4IP directly interacts with. Through this research the SLX4 complex was also discovered to be involved with the regulation of innate immunity, due to its negative regulation of type 1 interferon production, both when induced spontaneously and HIV-1-mediated.

Early years He was born in 1916 in Adapazarı to Yusuf Efendi, a third generation Circassian immigrant from Caucasus, and Emine Hanım. He had two elder brothers, Fuat and İsmail Hakkı. After finishing the junior high school in Adapazarı in 1930, he enrolled at Şişli Terakki High School in Nişantaşı, Istanbul as a boarding student. In 1934, Ekrem Alican graduated from the high school, and entered the higher education institute named (), where he studied Finance. (Although this institute was in İstanbul, 1936 it moved to Ankara to be named Faculty of Political Science, Ankara University. ) He completed his higher education in 1937, and was sent to London School of Economics for further studies on scholarship by the Ministry of Finance. Due to the outbreak of World War II, he had to return home one and half years later. Ekrem Alican entered the service of Ministry of Finance as an assistant inspector. Between 1940-41, he fulfilled the compulsory military service as a lieutenant of artillery at Çanakkale. After the end of the World War II, the Ministry wanted to send him again to London, however he could not convince his father, who was happy with his son's employment at the Ministry. Some time later, he was promoted to the post of an inspector. In 1946, he was called to the military service again for a short time. On May 29, 1946 he and Naciye Güler, an 18-year-old native of his hometown, got engaged. The couple married on May 19, 1947. The family had three children, daughters Emine Nilüfer (born in 1948), Canan (born in 1951) and son Yusuf (born in 1958). Right after completion of his second military time, Ekrem Alican resigned from his post at the Ministry after seven years of service, and returned to his hometown. He and his three other relatives established a firm in the trade of agricultural products. The firm was short- living because unsuccessful.  Political life At the age of 34, Ekrem Alican entered Democrat Party (DP), and was elected deputy of Kocaeli in the 1950 general elections. The family moved then to Ankara. In 1951, Alican stood up for the building of a sugar refinery in Adapazarı, which was highly needed in the region. It was completed and went in production in 1953. Even though he developed inner-party controversies that began already in 1952, he ran for the 1954 elections and kept his seat in the parliament. In 1955, following the Istanbul riots that took place on September 6–7, some leading party members expressed harsh criticism on the government, and demanded the implementation of the \\"right to prove\\" () into the criminal law regarding suppression of press freedom that led to growing inner-party opposition. The disciplinary board of the party expelled then nine members. Ten members followed their colleagues discharged and resigned. The 19 politicians decided to establish a political party, which was realized on December 20, 1955 under the name Liberty Party) (). Ekrem Alican, among the co-founders, became the third party leader after Ekrem Hayri Üstündağ and Fevzi Lütfi Karaosmanoğlu. The outcome of the advanced 1957 elections held on October 27 was a disappointment for the HP, which could secure four seats in the parliament only while Alican was not elected. At the party congress on November 24, 1958,the party dissolved itself. While most of the members joined the main opposition Republican People's Party, Ekrem Alican did not go with. Right after the military coup of 1960 on May 27 that overturned the government of Democrat Party, he was appointed Minister of Finance by the National Unity Committee, the junta on May 30. Alican resigned from the cabinet on December 26, 1960 due to disputes over financial politics with the militaries. He founded the New Turkey Party () on February 13, 1961 as one of the two newly established major parties, which aimed to attract the votes of the banned Democratic Party. Alican became leader of the party. In the 1961 general elections held on October 15, the YTP could achieve only a modest 13.73% of the votes resulting in 65 seats of the total 450 in the parliament, and in the 1961 senate elections on the same day, Alican's party sent 27 senators of the 150 to the Senate by 13,0% of the total votes. He was elected deputy of Sakarya Province, incorporating his hometown Adapazarı. Ekrem Alican was appointed deputy prime minister in the coalition cabinet of Republican Perty's leader İsmet İnönü serving from June 25, 1962 to December 25, 1963. He was re-elected deputy of Sakarya in the 1965 elections held on October 10. The YTP sent 19 deputies into the 450-seat parliament. On October 17, 1966, he resigned from his position as party leader, and stepped back from active politics in 1969. Later years and death Between 1970 and 1980, Ekrem Alican served as the chairman of the board at the Yapı ve Kredi Bankası, one of the major private banks in Turkey. He died on June 18, 2000 at the age of 84 in his home at Yeniköy, Istanbul. Following a religious ceremony at the Teşvikiye Mosque, he was laid to rest in the family cemetery at İkice Müslim village in Adapazarı. He was survived by his wife and three children.

According to Reece Winstone, writing in 1970, this is the only privately owned thatched house in Bristol. The house was built around 1810 and was formerly one of two former lodge houses to Henleaze Park, the residence of Samuel and Walter Derham. Henleaze Park later became St Margaret's School before being demolished in 1962. It is a few miles from Blaise Hamlet, John Nash's collection of picturesque cottages. Although this cottage is very similar in character and was built around the same time, it has never been verified that John Nash also built this property. The lodge's most unusual feature is the spy window on the ground floor that would have enabled the lodge keeper to view passing coaches from either the sitting or dining room.

Airing in two parts in 2013, the episode was the third and final episode of the specially-commissioned seventh season intended to bring the series to a close, and the final episode of the series. While in its initial six-year run Skins was a teen drama about the lives of Bristolian teenagers, Skins Rise like the two previous episodes, Skins Fire and Skins Pure, is a filmically and tonally distinct drama which revisits one of the show's characters as they face adulthood. Rise focuses on the character of James Cook (Jack O'Connell). A womaniser, regular drug user and troublemaker in third and fourth series of Skins, Cook was last seen attacking his friend's killer. In the present, Cook is noticeably more subdued and serious, and clearly harrowed by the events of his past as he makes his living peddling drugs in Manchester's criminal underworld. Synopsis =Part 1= Cook, now aged 21, is living in Manchester, and works as a drug peddler for Louie, a wealthy nightclub owner and drug baron, along with Louie's other employee, Jason, and his bodyguard, Rob. Having spent years on the run after killing John Foster, his friend Freddie's murderer, Cook sleeps in his car, and routinely has sex with Emma, his friend-with-benefits. He is called to Louie's flat where Louie asks him to drive his girlfriend, Charlie, house hunting. Charlie jumps into the swimming pool of a house they inspect, but Cook refuses to join. Charlie frustratedly questions his behaviour. As he continues to drive Charlie around, however, she flirts with him more, and continues to press him to reveal more details of his past to her, but he refuses. She later requests him to drop her off at a housing develop and not disclose this to Louie. He discusses this with Jason, who appears likewise confused. Louie throws a party and Cook attends with Emma. After consuming a pill given to Emma by Jason, Cook spots Charlie dancing in the crowd. Perplexed, he breaks away from Emma and walks away from the scene. Cook exits the venue throwing up and comes across Jason having sex with Charlie. Jason violently beats Cook up, and threatens him to keep quiet. Emma finds Cook in a state, and takes him back to her flat to clean him up. While there, they discuss the possibility of packing up and leaving Manchester for good. Cook receives a call for Charlie and subsequently leaves to meet her. Charlie demands he tell her what has happened to him, and he admits that he has killed someone. They then proceed to have sex but are interrupted by Louie calling Cook, telling him to bring Charlie to their new house for a house warming party. As Cook, Rob, Jason, Charlie and Louie talk at the house, Louie reveals that he knows that Charlie has been cheating on him. He states he is planning to \\"streamline\\" his operation and Rob brutally drowns Jason in the swimming pool. Charlie watches in horrified silence and is then led to another room by Louie. Horrified, Cook goes to Emma's and tells her to pack. As they are driving out of Manchester, Cook gets a call from a traumatised Charlie, who begs him to pick her up from the nearby bus station. He turns his car around against Emma's wishes. =Part 2= Cook, Emma and Charlie flee Manchester, to a country manor owned by Emma's parents in the Midlands. They get in with the spare key, but are confronted by Emma's parents who have not seen her in two years. They are allowed to stay. Emma realises Charlie has had sex with Cook, and confronts him. Cook apologises and initiates sex with her but she leaves. The next day, Cook causes a scene at their local pub. Louie is at the manor when they return, having tracked Cook's car electronically. He tries to persuade Charlie to come home with him, but she coldly refuses. Seemingly dejected, he leaves, as do Emma's parents. Cook instructs the girls to pack up and they leave by foot. Cook, Emma and Charlie find Emma's parent's car pushed off the road. It is empty of Emma's parents and her father's shotgun. Cook realises that Louie has taken it, and they run into the woods, Emma hysterical. Cook explores the woods and hears two gun shots near Louie's car. He flees and the three find an abandoned wooden bunker for shelter. Charlie gives Emma sedatives to calm her. As they wait for morning, Charlie resolves to kill Louie but Cook refuses. Charlie urges him to choose her over Emma, and they kiss. Unbeknownst to them, Emma wakes up and sees them. Cook wakes up and discovers that Emma has left. Cook and Charlie's search leads them to an empty field where Louie is waiting for them with a gun, with Emma's dead body hanging by a noose from a nearby tree. Charlie remains in the woods while Cook confronts Louie. Cook provokes Louie by revealing he had sex with Charlie and they attack each other. Cook knocks Louie unconscious. He picks the gun up and fires into the air. Later, Cook rouses Louie and informs him that the police are on their way. Charlie is in Louie's car and Cook tells her to disappear. He says they will never see each other again and she drives away. Cook crouches over Emma's body mournfully, then walks off into the distance. Reception Part 1 received favourable reviews, with Caroline Preece of Den of Geek commenting that \\"those who loved the character are still going to find Rise a compelling watch. It’s grim, but in an entirely different way to Effy or Cassie’s stories, and it somehow makes perfect sense to find him in this heightened world a million miles away from the ordinary world of Skins.\\" Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy, meanwhile, noted that the episode \\"thrills in a way that its predecessors didn't - it's plenty dark in places, but also engaging and outlandish in all the ways that classic Skins was.\\" James T. Cornish of WhatCulture praised Liam Boyle's performance, describing him as \\"a decent villain\\" and that Boyle \\"really helps to flesh out the character and make him feel like a potent threat.\\" References Category:Skins (British TV series) episodes Category:2013 television films Category:Manchester in fiction ","title":"Skins Rise"},{"id":"40000633","text":"Russell Easton Havenstrite (1896-1958) was an American wildcatter and polo player.

However, Harold L. Ickes (1874–1952), who served as United States Secretary of the Interior from 1933 to 1946, had blocked him from drilling. In 1946, he flew the Andersons, the Disneys and the Zanucks on his private Douglas DC-3 plane to see his jade mine in Kotzebue, Alaska and his gold mine in Candle, Alaska.Michael Barrier, The Animated Man: A Life of Walt Disney, University of California Press, 2007, p. 207 In 1954, he drilled a second well at Iniskin, but he stopped sometime in 1955.

It was a major surprise in the world of martial arts as the K-1 WGP Final had never been held outside Japan before.

It was decided that the final event of the prestigious tournament would be officially titled “Fight Channel presents: K-1 WGP Final”. On March 15, 2013, the K-1 WGP Final was held in Arena Zagreb, in front of approximately 15,500 people.

It led to numerous deaths and a huge population migration out of the territory and into the neighboring Belgian Congo and surrounding areas. The famine is considered to have begun in October 1943 and ended in December 1944. The principal cause of the famine was several prolonged periods of drought in the region in early 1943. However, the problem was exacerbated by attempts of the colonial authorities to send agricultural produce to the Belgian Congo, as part of the Allied war effort, in World War II. The colonial administration, together with Christian missionaries, began to transport food to a supply point in Usumbura (presently Bujumbura). The Rwandan king, Mutara III Rudahigwa, sent aid to the affected region. By the time the famine ended in December 1944, between 36,000Belgian 1946 estimate, cited in and 50,000United Nations 1948 estimate, cited in people (between one-fifth and one-third of the total regional population) died of hunger in the territory. Several hundred thousand people emigrated away from Ruanda-Urundi, most to the Belgian Congo but also to Uganda as well. The migration also served to create further political instability in the areas affected by the mass influx of Rwandans.

SACOM monitors and publicizes the misconducts of multinational corporations (e.g. Apple Inc., Disney) through first-hand investigations in supplier factories.  Major campaigns  =Toys and gifts= SACOM's protest in Oct 2010 against the Disney sweatshop practice. In August 2005, SACOM launched the debut campaign called Looking For Mickey Mouse's Conscience amid the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland. It aimed to advocate conscience consumption against sweatshop products such as Disney toys and gifts. SACOM's follow-up investigations exposed the frequent labour rights violations in Disney's supplier factories, and there has been little improvement over years. In August 2009, SACOM and Stop Toying Around jointly published the report titled Exploitations of Toy Factory Workers at the Bottom of Global Supply Chain. The report highlighted the poor working conditions within Chinese supplier factories of famous brands such as Disney, Mattel and Walmart. These factories adopted the ICTI Care Process, a so-called ethical manufacturing certification programme. It was found that the certification process non-transparent and unaccountable to the public, workers and civil society, becoming a de facto cover for labour rights infringement for global toy brands. In January 2012, SACOM released its investigative findings regarding to the production of Wenlock and Mandeville, the official mascots of 2012 London Olympics and Paralympics, and pointed out the production process violated the Sustainable Sourcing Code of London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG). SACOM protests at the opening of the first Apple Store in Hong Kong against the serious labour rights abuse in its supplier factories such as Foxconn and Wintek. =Electronics= In 2010, SACOM launched investigative reports on Apple in response to the serial suicides in Foxconn and the mass n-hexane poisoning in Wintek (Suzhou), both of which are Apple's major suppliers. SACOM urged Apple to take responsibility for the poisoning and suicides, for its ethical codes were violated in the production of iPhones and iPads. Subsequent investigations of SACOM in Apple's Chinese supplier factories made the shocking discoveries that Foxconn treated its workers as machines and enforced military management. In February 2011, SACOM released the report Game console and music player production in China jointly with makeITfair”’,“SOMO” and “Finnwatch”, which investigated the supplier factories of Apple, Microsoft, Motorola, Phillips and Sony. The study revealed that their workers’ working hours exceeded the statutory limit while being paid far below the living wage. In addition, the workers were unable to form genuine unions Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China to protect their own rights. =Clothing= In December 2005, SACOM's report on Giordano revealed the alleged labour right abuses in its supplier factories, and demanded Giordano to fulfill its monitoring responsibilities. In July 2012, SACOM jointly published the investigation results with IHLO Hong Kong Liaison Office, War on Want (WoW) and Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) concerning the use of sandblasting for distressing jeans, which can cause workers fatal silicosis disease. Sandblasting was found to be still commonly used in the Chinese suppliers of Western brands including Abercrombie & Fitch and H&M;, despite many brands announced during 2010-2011 to ban the practice.  Support programmes  SACOM supported the Coke Concerned Student Group in Mainland China, which aims to improve the working conditions of bottling plants in China. SACOM also collaborated with other Hong Kong NGOs to train the employees of all levels in two HP supplier factories in Dongguan, China, to enhance their understanding of labour rights.

Location  The reserve is near St Martin's north of Oswestry at . Some parking is available, but the Arriva Midlands bus route 53 to St Martins and a short walk of half a mile will also lead to the site.  Wildlife  Ifton Meadows was once a colliery spoil, but over time has become a valuable wildlife habitat. As a result, in 2005 the site was designated as a Local Nature Reserve. The site includes many different habitats such as woodland, streams, grassland and pools. The site supports includes woodland wildflowers, birds such as skylarks and woodpeckers, bats, dragonflies, adders and the grizzled skipper butterfly. Because of this wildlife, visitors are told to keep dogs on leads and to stick to the pathway, particularly during the skylark breeding season in April to July.  History  For 400 years this area was mined for coal, but in 1968 the Ifton Colliery closed, and the spoil tips were covered, reopening to the public in 1978.  Recreational activities  Walking routes provided range from an easy pathway suitable for wheelchairs and pushchairs, to steeper pathways through the woodland. For some pathways good footwear is recommended as it can get muddy. For wheelchair users, a radar key is needed to open the entrance gate to gain access.

The bag was redesigned several times before it was popularized by and then named after the American actress and Monégasque princess Grace Kelly. The bag is now an expensive status symbol.  Design  The Kelly bag is a trapezium closed with two straps. Four studs on the bottom, itself made of three layers of leather, enable it to stand on the ground. It is sold in eight sizes, ranging from to . The padlock, keys and hardware are made of white or yellow gold. The current model Kelly bag, the Kelly II, comes in two distinct styles, as did its predecessor, the Kelly I. The sellier style is a rigid construction including a stiffening layer between the outer leather and inner lining, with the side and bottom stitching clearly visible; the retourné style is a softer construction, wherein the bag is sewn and then turned inside-out, hiding the exterior side stitching. The Kelly II, released in 2000 as an update to the original Kelly, has a double ring at the top handle, designed to attach to a shoulder strap; the original Kelly, while often sold with a shoulder strap, features a single-ring design. The construction of each Kelly bag requires 18 to 25 hours of handicraft, with each item being created by a single artisan, resulting in high retail prices. By the mid-1990s, a Kelly bag was priced at , and as of 2019, prices range from to , with exotic leathers priced higher.  History  In 1923, Émile- Maurice Hermès and Ettore Bugatti designed a thoroughly simple and plain bag for Hermès's wife Julie, named after Bugatti. The Bugatti was the first bag designed by Hermès specifically as a women's handbag and is notable for being the first handbag to utilize a zipper pull. In the 1930s, Hermès's son-in-law Robert Dumas redesigned it as a spacious travel bag called Sac à dépêches. It was a sharp contrast to the dominant purses of the time, which were simple, small and flat, resembling envelopes. = Association with Grace Kelly = Red crocodile leather Kelly bag Alfred Hitchcock has been credited with bringing the handbag into the limelight. In 1954, Hitchcock allowed the costume designer Edith Head to purchase Hermès accessories for the film To Catch a Thief, starring Grace Kelly. According to Head, Kelly \\"fell in love\\" with the bag. In 1956 she became princess of Monaco and was photographed using the handbag to shield her growing belly from the paparazzi during her first pregnancy. That photograph was featured in Life magazine. Princess Grace was a fashion icon, and the handbag immediately achieved great popularity. Although the handbag instantly became known as the Kelly bag, it was not officially renamed until 1977. The handbag with which Princess Grace was photographed was loaned from the palace archives of Monaco and displayed in the Victoria and Albert Museum in April 2010, along with other notable wardrobe items owned by the princess. The \\"star exhibit\\" of the show contains scuffs and marks, as the wardrobe thrifty princess carried it for many years. Hermès now creates 32 styles of handbags, but the Kelly persists as the manufacturer's best-seller.

They released six singles between 1978 and 1980, and one album in 1980, Sooner Than You Think, on the Dureco label. The band consisted of Justin Ward (vocals), Matthew Flowers (keyboards), Danny Flowers (bass), Reid Savage (guitars), Greg Mason (sax) and Robin Knapp (drums). Soon after, Knapp was replaced by Clive Kirby from the band Landslide. History In the early 1970s, Reid Savage, Dan Flowers and Greg Mason were schoolmates at the William Ellis School in Highgate and formed Sore Throat in 1975. Matthew Flowers, Dan's brother joined the band as keyboardist; prior to this, he was involved in helping out in their mother's art gallery business. By 1976, the band were enjoying five gig bookings a week and were well-known faces at Camden's live music venues, earning them a loyal following. Sore Throat released several singles and an album in 1980 which failed to make much of an impact on the charts and the band eventually split, with its members pursuing other careers and projects. After Sore Throat split, Matthew Flowers went on to join new wave band Blue Zoo on keyboards for a couple of years, while still involved in running his art gallery which he successfully continued to do so after his music career. Reid Savage went on to join Way of the West, later to be joined by Greg Mason. In 2011, Reid Savage, Dan Flowers and Greg Mason reformed under the name Groovy Dad, along with friend Neil McCormick. Justin Ward continues to perform, record and play harmonica and fiddle professionally in Glasgow, Scotland.

Contents  = Life and work = Shwafaty is an artist and researcher based in Brazil. He has a bachelor's degree from UNICAMP (Campinas, 2001), obtained a master's degree in visual arts and curatorial studies from Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti–NABA (Milano, 2010) and attended Simon Starling's classes at the Staedelschule (Frankfurt am Main, 2010–2011). Shwafaty has been involved with collective, research-based, curatorial and spatial practices since early 2000s, and as a result, his own practice explores the converging spheres of critical design, spatial politics, knowledge economy, and visual culture in ways that assume art as a productive system able to stimulate changes and reflections on social behavior and cognition when related to historical, interdisciplinary, and public issues. His concerns pass through diverse issues regarding public space, conviviality and visual culture in specific sociocultural and political contexts. Using diverse methods and languages – that ranges from installations, sculptural and spatial situations, design and printed matter to research-based and docu- fictional strategies – he aims to explore the possibilities of being at same time a productive agent, a reflexive and critical actor. In this sense, art production becomes a way to approach the real as at the same time an opportunity to question pre-assumed positions. The materialization of his projects can be considered as hybrid units of information, assumed as possibilities to generate (or recover) specific sets of knowledge. Through notions and acts of critique, appropriation and translation he intends to create situations where issues and debates about the functions and communicative qualities of art may emerge and be articulated within certain levels of society and the public sphere. = Exhibitions = Among past and forthcoming exhibitions, his work has been exhibited at 9th Mercosul Biennial (Porto Alegre, 2013); Mythologies, MAM SP (São Paulo, 2013); 33rd Panorama of Brazilian Art, MAM SP (São Paulo, 2013); X São Paulo Architecture Biennial (2013); Contra Escambos (Belo Horizonte and Recife, 2013); Eternal Tour, SESC (São Paulo, 2012); Mythologies, Cité des Arts (Paris, 2011); Shadowed by the future, Instituto Cervantes (São Paulo, 2010); 4th IABR - Rotterdam Architecture Biennial: Urbaninform (Netherlands, 2009); 3rd Utrecht Manifest (Netherlands, 2009); Public Turbulence, Isola Art Center (Milan, 2009); Utopia for Sale, Akademie der Künste (Berlin, 2009); The Building: E-flux, Berlin, 2009; Rumos Artes Visuais, Itaú Cultural (São Paulo, 2006). = Critical texts = Shwafaty has written in recent years, diverse critical art reviews and critical reports.

He is sometimes known as James Gordon Huntly, to distinguish him from James Gordon (1553–1641), another Jesuit. Life He was the fifth son of George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly, by Elizabeth Keith, Countess of Huntly, eldest daughter of Robert, Lord Keith, and sister of William Keith, 4th Earl Marischal. He entered the Society of Jesus at Rome on 20 September 1563, and taught philosophy, theology, sacred scripture, and Hebrew in the colleges of the order at Pont-à-Mousson, Paris, and Bordeaux. In 1584 William Crichton and Gordon were sent on a mission to Scotland. Their vessel was seized on the high seas by the Dutch. The ship was released; but the merchant who had hired her for the voyage, having discovered that his two passengers were priests, accused them as enemies, and the Dutch detained them. The merchant was concerned about the attitude of the Earl of Huntly, Gordon's nephew, and Gordon was set free after the substitution of a secular priest in his place. On arriving in Scotland Gordon, as a kinsman of King James VI, had influence among the nobility; and he engaged in public discussions with Protestant ministers. For two months he followed the king everywhere else in hope of finding an opportunity to convert him to Catholicism. He then went to the north of Scotland, where he held a public discussion on matters of faith with George Hay and made converts including Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll. In 1585 other Jesuits arrived, Edmund Hay and John Durie. Reporting to Francis Walsingham on 18 October 1585, Thomas Rogers wrote that the Jesuits were announcing progress on conversions, and were still aiming to make the king a Catholic. The situation changed with the return of the exiled lords to power. In February 1588 Gordon held a conference with Protestant ministers in the presence of James at Holyrood Palace. The king determined in 1592 to raise Catholics to power. On the advice of his councillors of state he sent Gordon and Crichton to Rome to arrange with the Pope means of restoring the Catholic religion in Scotland. They areturned to Scotland in company with the legate George Sampiretti, landing at Aberdeen on 16 July 1594. As the popular agitation increased, James changed his mind and resolved that laws against Catholics should be enforced. Gordon was sent into exile in 1595; but he subsequently paid two visits to Scotland in June 1597 and December 1598, still with the object of bringing about the conversion of the king. Gordon died at the Jesuit college in Paris on 16 April 1620. Works Gordon's works are: * Controversiarum Epitomes, in qua de quæstionibus theologicis hac nostra ætate controversis, breviter disputatur: idque ex sacris præsertim literis, Poitiers, 1612. The second volume, In quo de augustissimo Eucharistiæ Sacramento contra Calvinianos breviter disputatur, appeared at Paris, 1618. They were reprinted by John Kinchius, with a third part, at Cologne, 1620, under the title of Controversiarum Christianæ Fidei adversus hujus temporis Hæreticos Epitome.

She is a curator, professor, writer, and painter awarded the American Academy of Arts and Letters coveted John Koch Award for best young figurative painter in 2012. She is professor in the Critical Theory Department at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. Wittenberg was born in San Francisco, CA, and received her BFA from the San Francisco Art Institute in 2003. Her work is featured in several prominent collections. From 2011-2014 she served as a teacher at the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture and the Bruce High Quality Foundation University Exhibitions include The Female Gaze, Part Two: Women Look at Men at Cheim Read Gallery, Look! New Acquisitions at the Albertina Museum in Vienna, Nowhere But Here, curated by Alex Katz at Colby College Museum of Art, also featuring Chantal Joffe, Elizabeth Peyton and Chuck Close. Work Starting each of her works from a combination of drawings from slow-motion video, models in the studio and photographic images, Wittenberg primarily uses sex as subject mater. But her love of sexual material goes deeper than politics or even lust. She's looking for fresh ways to engage art's long history of sexual imagery. Wittenberg’s style can be classified as figurative, but also in opposition to the cannon of figurative painting. Her decision to portray sexually aroused men is a subject that is \\"actually underrepresented in Western painting in any century.” None of her paintings are representational of a discrete event or viewpoint, David Salle praises her commitment to reinventing realism. She builds and often repeats images from drawings, monotypes, painting and collages. Wittenberg spends days distancing herself from the material and living it, until the direction of the “emotional content” sinks in. She describes, “repetition touches upon the question of engagement, which is a big question in painting. My engagement with the image over the course of repetition heightens my own imagination about it.” She is a very active printmaker and works with Lococo Fine Art Publisher in St. Louis.

It is located on the southern side, in the central part of the island, east of Sørlaguna, and defines the northeastern extension of the bay Rekvedbukta. To the west of the peninsula is the bay Eggøybukta, and to the east is the bay Jamesonbukta. The highest peak at the peninsula has a height of 217 m.a.s.l.

Life and career Dérivis was born in Albi, a town in southern France and entered the Paris Conservatory in December 1799. He made his debut at the Paris Opéra on 11 February 1803 as Sarastro in Les Mystères d'lsis (the French version of Mozart's The Magic Flute). The same year he was also appointed a singer at Napoleon's court. During the course of his 25-year career at the Opéra, he performed all the leading bass roles and sang in many world premieres, including Spontini's La vestale and Rossini's Le siège de Corinthe. His last appearance there was on 5 May 1828 as Œdipe in Sacchini's Œdipe à Colone, a role he had sung to great success many times in his career. After retiring from the company, he continued to perform in French provincial theatres for several more years. Dérivis died in Livry-Gargan, a suburb of Paris, in 1856 at the age of 75. His wife died in 1819. She had had a very brief career as a soprano at the Paris Opéra where she performed under her maiden name, Naudet.

Formerly a reporter for the National Geographic Channel, Istvan now writes futurist, transhumanist, secular and political-themed articles for major media, including The New York Times, Vice's Motherboard, Wired, The Huffington Post, TechCrunch and Newsweek. Istvan regularly appears on television and video channels discussing futurist topics. He is widely perceived as one of the world's most influential transhumanists and believes transhumanism will grow into a mainstream social movement in the next decade. Istvan is the author of The Transhumanist Wager, a philosophical science fiction novel. In late 2014, Istvan announced he was running for President of the United States in the 2016 election. He ran for his own Transhumanist Party to raise awareness for transhumanist politics issues. Later, in 2017, Istvan ran for Governor of California in the 2018 election as a member of the Libertarian Party. In 2019 Istvan ran for the Republican Party's nomination in the 2020 United States presidential election, hoping to win the Republican Party's nomination against President Donald Trump. Early life and education Zoltan Istvan was born in Los Angeles in 1973 to his Hungarian immigrant parents Ilona and Steven (István) Gyurko. He was a nationally ranked swimmer and waterpolo player in his youth. Istvan later graduated from Columbia University in New York City with a degree in philosophy and religion. During his freshman year, Istvan was arrested by undercover cops for selling $80 worth of marijuana to fellow students. His arrest and subsequent felony conviction influenced how he views the U.S. government's war on drugs. Career =Early career= Istvan was an online and on-camera reporter for the National Geographic Channel. His writings have appeared in a blog of the San Francisco Chronicle, and Outside. His work has been covered in publications such as The Huffington Post. Istvan's coverage of the war in Kashmir was made into a documentary, Pawns of Paradise, distributed by Janson Media. Australia's The Age has acquired non-exclusive Australian rights to the show. According to Istvan, he invented, pioneered and popularized the extreme sport of volcano boarding. Istvan is an entrepreneur who works in real estate. He also owns vineyard properties in Mendoza, Argentina and California's Napa Valley. =Futurist career= After publishing The Transhumanist Wager, Istvan began actively promoting transhumanism and other futurist issues via speeches, media interviews, activism and his writings. Istvan's writings and ideas on transhumanism, philosophy, atheism and futurist issues have been featured in Yahoo! News, The Daily Telegraph, The Huffington Post UK, The Daily Beast, Business Insider\\"Jamie Bartlett On Transhumanism - Business Insider\\". Business Insider. November 25, 2014. and other media sites. Istvan and his ideas have been featured on Fox News channel's Stossel show, CNN's Inside Man, RT's television show Desde La Sombra, Ryan O'Shea's Future Grind podcast and The Joe Rogan Experience.The Uprising Creative. \\"Joe Rogan (Podcast Site)\\". Joe Rogan (Podcast Site). Istvan has also written for Gizmodo, New Scientist, Salon, TechCrunch, The Daily Dot, International Business Times Singularity University's Singularity Hub, TechInsider, Newsweek, Futurism and Slate. Istvan is a member of the World Future Society, a volunteer Ambassador for The Seasteading Institute, an advisory board member of the India Future Society, a member of the Young Professionals, an advisory board member of A-Team for Wildlife and is on the Futurist and Space Settlement boards of the Lifeboat Foundation. Istvan has regularly given talks on futurist and transhumanist topics, which include speeches at the World Bank, World Economic Forum (Global Future Council), Congreso Futuro, Moogfest, the World Future Society's annual conference, Transhuman Visions in San Francisco, Brighter Brain's Future of Emotional Health and Intelligence Conference at University of California, Berkeley, TEDxTransmedia in Geneva, Switzerland\\"A TEDx Talk on Beauty and Life Extension Science\\". The Huffington Post.\\"A TEDx Talk Celebrating Scientists and Exploring the Technological Future of Beauty\\". The Huffington Post. and being the opening keynote speaker at the Financial Times Camp Alphaville conference. He appeared in the 2016 documentary The Future of Work and Death. =2016 presidential campaign= In October 2014, Istvan announced that he was \\"in the very early stages of preparing a campaign to try to run\\" for U.S. President in 2016. He stated that his goals would be to support scientists in \\"overcoming human death and aging within 15–20 years\\" to encourage Americans to embrace \\"radical technology and science\\" and to set up safeguards against dangers including potential abuse of such technology. In October and November 2014 interviews, Istvan explained that he aimed to unify the transhumanist community, which otherwise was splintered, and to establish a single voice. He said great changes in society could happen and that Transhumanism could provide ideas, safeguards and policies. He said the aim for a Transhumanist Party would be to get onto as many state ballots as possible. In March 2015, Istvan reported progress in organizing a campaign and explained his wish to get major candidates to address issues. He hoped to be included in some debates, at least with third parties. He himself had funded nearly all of his campaign's expenses to date and he noted donations were needed. Istvan helped to publicize his campaign in late 2015 by driving a bus shaped like a casket—the \\"Immortality Bus\\"—across the United States. Istvan planned the bus tour to raise awareness of life extension. At the end of the Immortality Bus tour, Istvan delivered a \\"Transhumanist Bill of Rights\\" to the U.S. Capitol. His 20-point platform includes a universal basic income, increased funding for space travel and taking money from the military and putting it into science and medicine. In February 2016, it was reported that Istvan was likely to vote Democrat, placing himself \\"somewhere between Bernie and Hillary in terms of political ideologies\\", but later in 2016 he also wrote articles supporting Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson. On October 15, 2016, Istvan stated on his social media accounts that he would be voting for himself. Istvan was not on the ballot in any state, though he claimed to have substantial potential write-in backers. =2018 California gubernatorial campaign= Istvan emphasized science, technology, longevity, transhumanism and Libertarian values in his California gubernatorial run, along with support for basic income. He suggested basic income could be paid for without raising taxes through a \\"Federal Land Dividend\\". Under this program, the government would allocate monthly payments to households by leasing out federal land. In his debut editorial for Reason magazine, he argued that reparations for harm caused to marijuana users during the federal government's War on Drugs may be appropriate. He suggested reparations could be paid as tax credits or through the sale of federal lands, so as not to put further burden associated with the drug war on taxpayers. =2020 presidential campaign= In December 2017, Istvan announced he was considering running for the Libertarian Party's Presidential nomination. In March 2019 during an interview on the Bread and Circuses podcast, Istvan told Caleb Salvatore and Nick Koehler that he was again considering a run for President. Istvan announced a run for the Republican nomination on November 19th. =Philosophy= Istvan states that in the 21st century, as modern man confronts the finitude of life, everyone faces a Transhumanist Wager, a concept that is explored in his science fiction novel of the same name. The Transhumanist Wager follows from a life philosophy Istvan calls Teleological Egocentric Functionalism (TEF). Istvan summarizes the Transhumanist Wager as follows: Istvan is the creator of the concepts of Theistcideism, Omnipotism, the AI Imperative, the Singularity Disparity, Speciation Syndrome, Delayed Fertility Advantage, and Jethro's Window, a possible solution to the Fermi Paradox. Istvan is also a populizer of AI Day, the Jesus Singularity, cryothanasia and a robot AI President. Istvan proposed and developed the concept of a Longevity Peace Prize at the XPRIZE Foundation in 2019. Writing for The New York Times opinion section, Istvan argued conservatives should consider supporting artificial wombs to move the abortion debate forward. Istvan authored an article entitled \\"Transhumanism and Theistcideism\\" for publication in Pandeism: An Anthology (2017).Amazon.com page for Pandeism: An Anthology; Amazon.com page for Zoltan Istvan showing Pandeism: An Anthology. Istvan wrote the short fictional story \\"The Jesus Singularity\\" on a religious AI that goes rogue and destroys the world. It was published in Vice magazine. Istvan has a chip implanted in his hand and consulted with the U.S. Navy on broad about the use of the implant in humans. According to Istvan's novel, the three laws of Transhumanism are: #A transhumanist must safeguard one's own existence above all else. #A transhumanist must strive to achieve omnipotence as expediently as possible—so long as one's actions do not conflict with the First Law. #A transhumanist must safeguard value in the universe—so long as one's actions do not conflict with the First and Second Laws. Transhumanist community reception Within the transhumanist community, reactions to Istvan's U.S. Transhumanist Party have ranged from enthusiastic to sharply critical. Some transhumanist critics, such as Peter Rothman, have questioned whether the Transhumanist Party adds value to the overall goals of transhumanism. Personal life Istvan resides in Mill Valley, California with his daughters and physician wife. He identifies as an atheist. In February 2015, he helped launch BiZoHa, the world's first free-thinker orphanage, in Mukhoya, Kasese district, western Uganda. Istvan's promotional article on the topic in Vice's Motherboard, helped a GoFundMe campaign to achieve success in raising $5,820 to provide funding for the orphanage.

A month prior to its release, the album was preceded by The Pimpire Strikes Back, a mixtape which serves as its precursor. Roc Marciano began working on the album in 2012 before the release of his second LP Reloaded. While the latter features contributions from Q-Tip and The Alchemist on the beats, Marci Beaucoup focuses on Marciano's own production with vocal performances from various artists while Marciano also performs on every song. Guest appearances includes Evidence, Guilty Simpson, Action Bronson, Freeway, Gangrene, Blu and Cormega, among others, along with frequent collaborators Ka and Knowledge the Pirate. Critical reception Upon its release, Marci Beaucoup received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received a 77 score based on 6 reviews. Phillip Mlynar of Spin gave the album an eight out of ten, saying \\"Instead of reaching that precipice and seeming to over-stretch for some sort of tipping point into the mainstream, [Roc Marciano]'s forged his own world, on his own terms, and invited like-minded artists to flourish there as well. Long may his principality prosper.\\" HipHopDX reviewer Marcus J. Moore gave the album four exes out of five, saying \\"Marci Beaucoup is a nice victory lap that falls just short of Reloaded. There are standouts here—'Drug Lords', 'Psych Ward' and 'Soul Music' to name a few—but the overall product isn't as spectacular. Like its predecessor, Marci Beaucoup follows a standard formula of dope beats and dope rhymes, which works fine for an emcee of Marciano's caliber. With Beaucoup, Marciano and his friends just wanna rap and talk shit. That's fine. Marciano is a benevolent leader.\\" David Inkeles of XXL gave the album an XL, saying \\"Marciano adroitly finesses Marci Beaucoup, with the sort of smug, witty, stream of conscious brilliance that is one of his more endearing attributes on the mic. Couple that with his own tremendous production, and the bevy of talented guest-spots on here, and Marci Beaucoup is the perfect gift for any hip-hop connoisseur.\\" Grant Jones of RapReviews gave the album a seven out of ten saying, \\"If you felt Roc's previous albums were too Roc-heavy, this is the ideal album to ease you in to his brand of excess rap. Yet for somebody that held his previous two albums in such high regard, it's a little bit disjointed, unpolished and dare I say it, scruffy.\\" Pitchfork reviewer Renato Pagnani gave the album a 6.8 out of ten, saying \\"As a proper third album, Marci Beaucoup doesn't stack up to its precursors, but as an advertisement for Marciano's services as a beatsmith, it's much more successful.\\" Olivia Arezes of Exclaim! gave the album a seven out of ten, saying \\"Though not his most cohesive work, Marci Beaucoup is undoubtedly a solid addition to Roc Marciano's impressive and rapidly expanding catalogue.\\" Track listing *All tracks are produced by Roc Marciano.

It has been described in 2010 and comprises two species, that were formerly included in genus Atriplex. They are restricted to the California Floristic Province.  Description  The species of Extriplex are annuals or perennial herbs up to 1 m high, growing erect or spreading to decumbent. Young plant parts are farinose, older ones glabrescent or scurfy. The sparsely or much branched stems are striate when young, later stramineous. The green to grayish leaves are alternate, the lowest sometimes nearly opposite, petiolated or not. Their leaf blades are 4–70 mm long and 2–40 mm wide, deltoid to ovate-rhombic (to subhastate) or lanceolate to elliptic, with irregularly sinuate-dentate or entire margins. The leaf anatomy is of the \\"normal\\" (non-Kranz) type of C3-plants. The plants are monoecious. The inflorescences stand axillary or form dense or interrupted spikes or panicles of male and/or female flowers at the tips of the branches. Male flowers (with a bracteole) consist of 4 rounded-triangular perianth lobes, ca. 1 mm long, with cucullate tips, and 4 non-exserting stamens inserting on a disc. Female flowers are sitting within 2 opposite bracteoles, without perianth, consisting just of an ovary with 2 filiform, exserted stigmas. In fruit, the bracteoles enclosing the fruit become accrescent, 3–4.5 × 2–3 mm, free or connate to the lower half. Their shape can be ovate, nearly round, or deltate with entire margins and acute to acuminate apices. Their surface is densely scurfy, smooth or ribbed. The subglobose or laterally compressed fruit (utricle) is not spongy, and does not fall at maturity. The membranous pericarp is free or slightly adheres to the seed. The vertically orientated seed has a black to dark-brown, smooth and shiny, hard seed coat. The annular embryo surrounds the copious farinaceous perisperm. The flowering time is April to November. The chromosome numbers are n = 9 (haploid) and 2n = 18 (diploid).  Distribution  The genus Extriplex occurs only in the California Floristic Province and in the coastal desert of Baja California. It is known from the Central Valley and the valleys of the inner coast ranges, and from slightly north of San Francisco to Cedros Island, Baja California, where is grows on sandy coasts, in shrubland and salt marshes. The two species differ in their habitats: Extriplex californica can be found in monotypic stands in coastal habitats (like sea bluffs, sandy coasts, crevices in sea cliffs, coastal strands, coastal salt marsh, coastal sage scrub), often on sandy soils. Extriplex joaquinana grows in inland alkali sink scrub or in alkaline grasslands.  Systematics  The genus Extriplex has been first described in 2010 by Elizabeth H. Zacharias (In: A Molecular Phylogeny of North American Atripliceae (Chenopodiaceae), with Implications for Floral and Photosynthetic Pathway Evolution. In: Systematic Botany 35 (4), p. 839-857). It was established to separate two species from genus Atriplex, that revealed to be phylogenetically distinct. The genus name was derived from the Latin prefix \\"ex\\" (= on the outside) plus the genus name Atriplex. The type species is Extriplex joaquinana. Extriplex belongs to the tribe Atripliceae in the subfamily Chenopodioideae of the family Amaranthaceae. The genus comprises two species: * Extriplex californica (Moq.) E.H.Zacharias (Syn.: Atriplex californica Moq.) - California saltbush, California orach * Extriplex joaquinana (A.Nelson) E.H.Zacharias (Syn.: Atriplex joaquinana A.Nelson) - San Joaquin saltbush, San Joaquin orach  References  Stanley L.

The village is located in the belt of the irrigated green land that surrounds the Orange River, as it flows North-West through the Kalahari toward the Namibian border and the Richtersveld area of Namaqualand.

Scottish land surveyor, Roger Jackson, gave Askham its name when he surveyed farms in the Kuruman river in 1919. There are numerous varying explanations given for Roger Jackson’s choice in naming the settlement ‘Askham’. It is believed that Jackson named the town after a town on the Irish coast. Many others believe that Jackson derived the name from a farmer’s words: “Ask him”, or from the message he sent to request ingredients for his breakfast: “Ask ham!”. There is no general consensus on the choice of naming the village. The police station was built in 1931 and was a breeding station for camels used for police patrols in the Kalahari. At one stage, the police station kept over 400 camels and supplied them to police stations in Rietfontein, Obobogorag, Kuruman, Van Zylsrus, Deben and Olifantshoek.https://www.sa- venues.com/attractionsnc/askham.php Accessed 12 January 2018 Attractions Askham provides activities such as dune boarding, guided walks, game drives and bird exhibitions. =Kalahari Red Dune Route= The village of Askham is the starting point of the Kalahari Red Dune.

The documentary traces the path of Muslim scholar and political theorist Muhammad Asad, which led to his conversion to Islam.  Synopsis  In the early 1920s Leopold Weiss, a Jew born in Lemberg, traveled to the Middle East. The desert fascinated him, and Islam became his new spiritual home. He left his Jewish roots behind, converted to Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Asad. He became one of the most important Muslims of the 20th century, first as an adviser at the royal court of Saudi Arabia, and later translating the Quran into English. Asad also played an important role in the creation of Pakistan and served as its envoy to the United Nations. The director follows his fading footsteps, leading from the Arabian desert to Ground Zero. He finds a man who was not looking for adventures but rather wanted to act as a mediator between East and West. “A Road To Mecca” takes this opportunity to deal with a heated debate which is currently becoming more and more important.  Reception  The documentary received positive reviews from many magazines and newspapers e.g. Dox Magazine, Kleine Zeitung and Der Standard.

Subsequently, those theories cast doubt upon the necessity of materiality itself as conceptual artists \\"de- materialized\\" the art object and began to produce time-based and ephemeral artworks.

The lake reaches a maximum depth of and it lies at an elevation of above sea level. The lake flows out through a small stream that runs through underground culverts to the lake Breiavatnet before emptying into the nearby Byfjorden. Reservoir Mosvatnet was Stavanger's water source between 1863 and 1931. The Great Fire of Holmen in Stavanger in 1860 showed that the city had a weak water supply. In 1863, the city initiated the building of a new waterworks at Mosvatnet that both would give residents proper drinking water and better access to water for fire crews. A pump house was erected and water pipes were laid along the road Madlaveien (Rv 509). The water level of the pond was increased significantly, and several small islets and rocks disappeared. The city took over several properties along the lake to prevent contamination of drinking water source and it make the surrounding areas into parkland. After a short time it was realized that Mosvatnet did not have enough capacity to supply the growing city with drinking water for the long term. In 1903, the city of Stavanger bought water rights for the lake Store Stokkavatn and in 1930 that lake became the city's new water reservoir.

It is an essential laboratory procedure in the molecular cloning of DNA whereby DNA fragments are joined together to create recombinant DNA molecules, such as when a foreign DNA fragment is inserted into a plasmid. The ends of DNA fragments are joined together by the formation of phosphodiester bonds between the 3'-hydroxyl of one DNA terminus with the 5'-phosphoryl of another. RNA may also be ligated similarly. A co-factor is generally involved in the reaction, and this is usually ATP or NAD+. Ligation in the laboratory is normally performed using T4 DNA ligase, however, procedures for ligation without the use of standard DNA ligase are also popular. Ligation reaction The mechanism of the ligation reaction was first elucidated in the laboratory of I. Robert Lehman. Two fragments of DNA may be joined together by DNA ligase which catalyzes the formation of a phosphodiester bond between the 3'-OH at one end of a strand of DNA and the 5'-phosphate group of another. In animals and bacteriophage, ATP is used as the energy source for the ligation, while In bacteria, NAD+ is used. The DNA ligase first reacts with ATP or NAD+, forming a ligase-AMP intermediate with the AMP linked to the ε-amino group of lysine in the active site of the ligase via a phosphoamide bond. This adenylyl group is then transferred to the phosphate group at the 5' end of a DNA chain, forming a DNA-adenylate complex. Finally, a phosphodiester bond between the two DNA ends is formed via the nucleophilic attack of the 3'-hydroxyl at the end of a DNA strand on the activated 5′-phosphoryl group of another. A nick in the DNA (i.e. a break in one strand of a double-stranded DNA) can be repaired very efficiently by the ligase. However, a complicating feature of ligation presents itself when ligating two separate DNA ends as the two ends need to come together before the ligation reaction can proceed. In the ligation of DNA with sticky or cohesive ends, the protruding strands of DNA may be annealed together already, therefore it is a relatively efficient process as it is equivalent to repairing two nicks in the DNA. However, in the ligation of blunt-ends, which lack protruding ends for the DNA to anneal together, the process is dependent on random collision for the ends to align together before they can be ligated, and is consequently a much less efficient process. The DNA ligase from E. coli cannot ligate blunt-ended DNA except under conditions of molecular crowding, and it is therefore not normally used for ligation in the laboratory. Instead the DNA ligase from phage T4 is used as it can ligate blunt-ended DNA as well as single-stranded DNA. Factors affecting ligation Factors that affect an enzyme-mediated chemical reaction would naturally affect a ligation reaction, such as the concentration of enzyme and the reactants, as well as the temperature of reaction and the length of time of incubation. Ligation is complicated by the fact that the desired ligation products for most ligation reactions should be between two different DNA molecules and the reaction involves both inter- and intra-molecular reactions, and that an additional annealing step is necessary for efficient ligation. The three steps to form a new phosphodiester bond during ligation are: enzyme adenylylation, adenylyl transfer to DNA, and nick sealing. Mg(2+) is a cofactor for catalysis, therefore at high concentration of Mg(2+) the ligation efficiency is high. If the concentration of Mg(2+) is limited, the nick- sealing is the rate- limiting reaction of the process, and adenylylated DNA intermediate stays in the solution. Such adenylylation of the enzyme restrains the rebinding to the adenylylated DNA intermediate comparison of an Achilles' heel of LIG1, and represents a risk if they are not fixed. =DNA concentration= The concentration of DNA can affect the rate of ligation, and whether the ligation is an inter-molecular or intra-molecular reaction. Ligation involves joining up the ends of a DNA with other ends, however, each DNA fragment has two ends, and if the ends are compatible, a DNA molecule can circularize by joining its own ends. At high DNA concentration, there is a greater chance of one end of a DNA molecule meeting the end of another DNA, thereby forming intermolecular ligation. At a lower DNA concentration, the chance that one end of a DNA molecule would meet the other end of the same molecule increases, therefore intramolecular reaction that circularizes the DNA is more likely. The transformation efficiency of linear DNA is also much lower than circular DNA, and for the DNA to circularize, the DNA concentration should not be too high. As a general rule, the total DNA concentration should be less than 10 μg/ml. The relative concentration of the DNA fragments, their length, as well as buffer conditions are also factors that can affect whether intermolecular or intramolecular reactions are favored. The concentration of DNA can be artificially increased by adding condensing agents such as cobalt hexamine and biogenic polyamines such as spermidine, or by using crowding agents such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) which also increase the effective concentration of enzymes. Note however that additives such as cobalt hexamine can produce exclusively intermolecular reaction, resulting in linear concatemers rather than the circular DNA more suitable for transformation of plasmid DNA, and is therefore undesirable for plasmid ligation. If it is necessary to use additives in plasmid ligation, the use of PEG is preferable as it can promote intramolecular as well as intermolecular ligation. =Ligase concentration= The higher the ligase concentration, the faster the rate of ligation. Blunt-end ligation is much less efficient than sticky end ligation, so a higher concentration of ligase is used in blunt-end ligations. High DNA ligase concentration may be used in conjunction with PEG for a faster ligation, and they are the components often found in commercial kits designed for rapid ligation. =Temperature= Two issues are involved when considering the temperature of a ligation reaction. First, the optimum temperature for DNA ligase activity which is 37°C, and second, the melting temperature (Tm) of the DNA ends to be ligated. The melting temperature is dependent on length and base composition of the DNA overhang—the greater the number of G and C, the higher the Tm since there are three hydrogen bonds formed between G-C base pair compared to two for A-T base pair—with some contribution from the stacking of the bases between fragments. For the ligation reaction to proceed efficiently, the ends should be stably annealed, and in ligation experiments, the Tm of the DNA ends is generally much lower than 37°C. The optimal temperature for ligating cohesive ends is therefore a compromise between the best temperature for DNA ligase activity and the Tm where the ends can associate. However, different restriction enzymes generates different ends, and the base composition of the ends produced by these enzymes may also differ, the melting temperature and therefore the optimal temperature can vary widely depending on the restriction enzymes used, and the optimum temperature for ligation may be between 4-15°C depending on the ends. Ligations also often involve ligating ends generated from different restriction enzymes in the same reaction mixture, therefore it may not be practical to select optimal temperature for a particular ligation reaction and most protocols simply choose 12-16°C, room temperature, or 4°C. =Buffer composition= The ionic strength of the buffer used can affect the ligation. The kinds of cations presence can also influence the ligation reaction, for example, excess amount of Na+ can cause the DNA to become more rigid and increase the likelihood of intermolecular ligation. At high concentration of monovalent cation (>200 mM) ligation can also be almost completely inhibited. The standard buffer used for ligation is designed to minimize ionic effects. Sticky-end ligation Restriction enzymes can generate a wide variety of ends in the DNA they digest, but in cloning experiments most commonly-used restriction enzymes generate a 4-base single-stranded overhang called the sticky or cohesive end (exceptions include NdeI which generates a 2-base overhang, and those that generate blunt ends). These sticky ends can anneal to other compatible ends and become ligated in a sticky-end (or cohesive end) ligation. EcoRI for example generates an AATT end, and since A and T have lower melting temperature than C and G, its melting temperature Tm is low at around 6°C. For most restriction enzymes, the overhangs generated have a Tm that is around 15°C. For practical purposes, sticky end ligations are performed at 12-16°C, or at room temperature, or alternatively at 4°C for a longer period. For the insertion of a DNA fragment into a plasmid vector, it is preferable to use two different restriction enzymes to digest the DNA so that different ends are generated. The two different ends can prevent the religation of the vector without any insert, and it also allows the fragment to be inserted in a directional manner. When it is not possible to use two different sites, then the vector DNA may need to be dephosphorylated to avoid a high background of recircularized vector DNA with no insert. Without a phosphate group at the ends the vector cannot ligate to itself, but can be ligated to an insert with a phosphate group. Dephosphorylation is commonly done using calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) which removes the phosphate group from the 5′ end of digested DNA, but note that CIAP is not easy to inactivate and can interfere with ligation without an additional step to remove the CIAP, thereby resulting in failure of ligation. CIAP should not be used in excessive amount and should only be used when necessary. Shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) or Antarctic phosphatase (AP) are suitable alternative as they can be easily inactivated. Blunt-end ligation Blunt end ligation does not involve base- pairing of the protruding ends, so any blunt end may be ligated to another blunt end. Blunt ends may be generated by restriction enzymes such as SmaI and EcoRV. A major advantage of blunt-end cloning is that the desired insert does not require any restriction sites in its sequence as blunt-ends are usually generated in a PCR, and the PCR generated blunt-ended DNA fragment may then be ligated into a blunt-ended vector generated from restriction digest. Blunt-end ligation, however, is much less efficient than sticky end ligation, typically the reaction is 100X slower than sticky-end ligation. Since blunt-end does not have protruding ends, the ligation reaction depends on random collisions between the blunt-ends and is consequently much less efficient. To compensate for the lower efficiency, the concentration of ligase used is higher than sticky end ligation (10x or more). The concentration of DNA used in blunt-end ligation is also higher to increase the likelihood of collisions between ends, and longer incubation time may also be used for blunt-end ligations. If both ends needed to be ligated into a vector are blunt-ended, then the vector needs to be dephosphorylated to minimize self-ligation. This may be done using CIAP, but caution in its use is necessary as noted previously. Since the vector has been dephosphorylated, and ligation requires the presence of a 5'-phosphate, the insert must be phosphorylated. Blunt-ended PCR product normally lacks a 5'-phosphate, therefore it needs to be phosphorylated by treatment with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Blunt-end ligation is also reversibly inhibited by high concentration of ATP. PCR usually generates blunt-ended PCR products, but note that PCR using Taq polymerase can add an extra adenine (A) to the 3' end of the PCR product. This property may be exploited in TA cloning where the ends of the PCR product can anneal to the T end of a vector. TA ligation is therefore a form of sticky end ligation. Blunt-ended vectors may be turned into vector for TA ligation with dideoxythymidine triphosphate (ddTTP) using terminal transferase. General guidelines For the cloning of an insert into a circular plasmid: * The total DNA concentration used should be less than 10 μg/ml as the plasmid needs to recircularize. * The molar ratio of insert to vector is usually used at around 3:1. Very high ratio may produce multiple inserts. The ratio may be adjusted depending on the size of the insert, and other ratios may be used, such as 1:1. Trouble-shooting Sometimes ligation fail to produce the desired ligated products, and some of the possible reasons may be: * Damaged DNA – Over-exposure to UV radiation during preparation of DNA for ligation can damage the DNA and significantly reduce transformation efficiency. A higher-wavelength UV radiation (365 nm) which cause less damage to DNA should be used if it is necessary work for work on the DNA on a UV transilluminator for an extended period of time. Addition of cytidine or guanosine to the electrophoresis buffer at 1 mM concentration however may protect the DNA from damage. * Incorrect usage of CIAP or its inefficient inactivation or removal. * Excessive amount of DNA used. * Incomplete DNA digest – The vector DNA that is incompletely digested will give rise to a high background, and this may be checked by doing a ligation without insert as a control. Insert that is not completely digested will also not ligate properly and circularize. When digesting a PCR product, make sure that sufficient extra bases have been added to the 5'-ends of the oligonucleotides used for PCR as many restriction enzymes require a minimum number of extra basepairs for efficient digest. The information on the minimum basepair required is available from restriction enzyme suppliers such as in the catalog of New England Biolabs. * Incomplete ligation – Blunt-ends DNA (e.g. SmaI) and some sticky-ends DNA (e.g. NdeI) that have low-melting temperature require more ligase and longer incubation time. (Note that this paper has an error describing NdeI as a four-base cutter.) * Protein expressed from ligated gene insert is toxic to cells. * Homologous sequence in insert to sequence in plasmid DNA resulting in deletion. Other methods of DNA ligation A number of commercially available DNA cloning kits use other methods of ligation that do not require the use of the usual DNA ligases. These methods allow cloning to be done much more rapidly, as well as allowing for simpler transfer of cloned DNA insert to different vectors. These methods however require the use of specially designed vectors and components, and may lack flexibility. =Topoisomerase-mediated ligation= Topoisomerase can be used instead of ligase for ligation, and the cloning may be done more rapidly without the need for restriction digest of the vector or insert. In this TOPO cloning method a linearized vector is activated by attaching topoisomerase I to its ends, and this \\"TOPO-activated\\" vector may then accept a PCR product by ligating to both of the 5' ends of the PCR product, the topoisomerase is released and a circular vector is formed in the process. =Homologous recombination= Another method of cloning without the use of ligase is by DNA recombination, for example as used in the Gateway cloning system. The gene, once cloned into the cloning vector (called entry clone in this method), may be conveniently introduced into a variety of expression vectors by recombination.

Turner Power Plant in Enterprise, Florida. Viewed from Lake Monroe looking toward the northeast. March 11, 2006. The George E. Turner Power Plant was a coal-burning, and later oil-burning, electrical power plant constructed on the north shore of Lake Monroe, in Enterprise, Florida, United States in 1926. The plant operated as an oil-burning power plant until 1994 providing electrical power to more than 300,000 homes during its peak. The plant was decommissioned in 1994 and occasionally used as a filming location for several television productions. The plant was razed in 2007 and its site remains an ecological buffer zone. Description The Turner Power Plant was located in Enterprise, Florida on the north shore of Lake Monroe, about one half mile east of Interstate 4. The facility consisted of an eight-story main building with horizontal windows and smoke stacks. The building was known to locals as the \\"birthday cake\\". History The Florida Public Service Company built the Benson Springs Power Plant in what is now Enterprise, Florida, in 1926, to provide power for southwest Volusia County residents. The plant was equipped with a single, coal-fired generator capable of producing 11.5 kilowatts of electrical power. After World War II, the Florida Public Service Company was merged with other companies and became Florida Power Company and renamed it the plant George E. Turner Power Plant, in honor of a long-time Florida Power Company executive. Additional generators were added, including a 25 megawatt generating unit. In 1947, the plant was acquired by Florida Power Corporation and converted to an oil-fired plant. During its peak year in the 1960s and 1970s, the Turner plant provided electrical power to as many as 314,000 customers in Central Florida and consumed 5,000 barrels of oil per day. =Decommissioning= Florida Power Corporation announced a consolidation plan in 1993, resulting in the loss of 200 jobs and the closing of two power plants, including the Turner plant. The plant ceased operation in 1994 and was decommissioned two years later. Following a series of mergers, the plant came under the ownership of Progress Energy in 2000. Following its decommissioning, the plant was used as a filming location for several television productions including Fox series Fortune Hunter, Thunder in Paradise, and seaQuest DSV. In 2006, the abandoned plant was used for fire department search-and-rescue training. =Demolition= Demolition of the George E. Turner Power Plan. Portions of a turbine or fan are in the foreground. November 21, 2007. As early as 2003, Progress Energy had begun discussions about dismantling the plant. In May 2007, they began demolishing the abandoned power plant, with plans to salvage 6,000 tons of metal. The demolition was completed in February 2008. The 120-acre site has been retained by Progress Energy as an ecological buffer area, separating Lake Monroe from a peak generation station across the street from the site.

He was credited with establishing the first psychiatric ward within the organization of a general hospital. Mosher was born in Albany, New York, the son of a physician. In 1876, he entered The Albany Academy. In 1882, he entered the Union College in New York and graduated in 1866. During his senior year, he served as an apothecary at the Utica State Hospital. He studied medicine at the Albany Medical College, receiving his M.D. in 1889. His thesis was “General Paralysis of the Insane.” He visited the Willard State Hospital and the Willard Asylum for the Insane in New York in 1883 when he spent summer vacations in the area. After receiving his medical degree, he entered employment at Willard as a junior physician and then second assistant physician. When the then Superintendent of Willard transferred to the St. Lawrence State Hospital in 1890, Mosher followed him. He stayed for five years there as first assistant physician. He resigned because of political interference. Preparing to enter medical practice in Albany, Mosher spent six months in Europe visiting medical and psychiatric clinics in Vienna, Berlin, London, and Edinburgh. On his return, the Albany Medical College and Hospital appointed him clinical professor of psychiatry and provided a clinic. The hospital, which had opened in 1849, opened new facilities in 1898, which included several connected buildings. With the support of local physicians, Mosher persuaded the hospital authorities to include a separate pavilion for psychiatric patients since the nearest state mental hospital was 75 miles away. The purpose of the ward was transient accommodation for insane patients committed to the state hospital, treatment of mild cases of insanity who may recover in general hospital, alcoholic and drug addicted patients, and patients in the course of treatment for medical and surgical illnesses who develop mental disorders. From 1902 to 1904, the ward admitted 331 patients: 24 transferred from other wards, 24 with acute delirium, 20% with melancholy or mania, 20% alcoholics, and others with dementia, uremia, and eclampsia. Recovered patients numbered 110: 96 improved while 25 died. In 1908, Mosher was named Clinical Professor of Insanity, Nervous Disease and Electro- Therapeutics at the Albany Medical College, a position he held until his death in 1922. He became a joint editor of the Albany Medical Annals and held the position for 25 years until his death. For many years, he served on the editorial board of the American Journal of Insanity, later the Journal of the American Psychiatric Association (JAPA). He was a member of the American Neurological Association, and was affiliated with the Brady Memorial Hospital in Albany, the Albany Hospital for Incurables, and the Children’s Hospital in Albany. He was active in civic organizations including the Albany Academy, the Albany Hospital, and the Advisory Selective Service Board for New York during World War I. Mosher is credited with establishing the first psychiatric ward as part of a general hospital, a practice later adopted throughout the United States. By 1931, 122 of 420 general hospitals reported building special facilities for psychiatric patients. He died of heart disease in December 1922. Works Mosher, Jesse Montgomery.

History For a long time the main focus of the BME was on its lines through the Bergisches Land (the Witten/Dortmund–Oberhausen/Duisburg railway) and along the Ruhr (the Ruhr Valley Railway), which connected to local factories and coal mines. With the migration of the coal mining industry north from the vicinity of the Ruhr to the Emscher, the area between the two rivers became more of interest to the BME. This area had previously only been served by the Rhenish Railway Company (RhE) and the Cologne-Minden Railway Company (CME) with its more northerly Ruhr lines. Already in 1847, the CME had built its main line between Duisburg and Dortmund, which roughly followed the course of the Emscher. Some twenty years later, it built its Emscher Valley Railway parallel to its main line and generally close to the Emscher. Thus, the CME had a virtual monopoly in this area. Around the same time in the early 1870s, the RhE established the Rhenish Ruhr line, between Mülheim and Langendreer, also north of the BME’s Ruhr line. In the late 1870s, another company, the Royal Westphalian Railway Company (KWE), built its own Emscher Valley Railway. In order not to leave the lucrative area on both sides of the Emscher completely to its three competitors, the BME then began the construction of three sections of line, starting from the stations in Bochum, Essen and Oberhausen on its Ruhr line, that ultimately formed a continuous connection from Herne-Rottbruch to Oberhausen-Osterfeld Süd along the Emscher (hence it was also called the \\"Märkische Emscher Valley Railway\\"). =Essen–Bochum–Herne= In 1867, the BME began building a siding from Bochum BME station to the north, mostly to connect to mines. It reached Gußstahlwerk (literally “cast steel works”, now Bochum West) on 16 November 1867, Riemke (now Bochum-Riemke) on 1 March 1869 and Herne on 28 May 1870. At the time this was the northernmost line of the BME. On 1 November 1874, it officially opened a section that initially ran parallel with the Witten/Dortmund–Oberhausen/Duisburg railway from Essen BME via Wattenscheid BME and Bochum BME to Herne BME for freight, exactly two months later passenger services started. =Essen–Schalke= Starting from Essen BME station (now Essen Hbf) a siding ran in a wide arc north to the Königin Elisabeth colliery in what is now Essen-Frillendorf. A triangle of lines formed by this line, the Essen RhE–Kray RhE line built in 1868 (now the Essen Nord–Essen-Kray Nord line) and the Essen BME–Kray RhE line built in 1905 (now the Essen Hbf–Essen-Kray Nord line); a nearby street in Frillendorf is still called Gleisdreieck (“rail track triangle”). The siding was extended as a line via Caternberg BME (now Essen-Katernberg Nord) to Schalke BME (now Gelsenkirchen-Schalke Nord), including a branch line from Helene junction to Essen CME (now Essen-Altenessen); both lines were opened for freight traffic on 27 April 1874. As well as the section between Essen and Herne opened on 1 January 1875, passenger traffic ran regularly from Essen BME to Schalke BME and Essen CME, but at first non-stop. In 1880 passenger trains stopped for the first time at Caternberg BME and in 1889 this was followed by a passenger stop at Hessler (which was previously only a junction). Finally Stoppenberg station was inaugurated by the mayor of Stoppenberg, Carl Meyer on 8 August 1901. During the French occupation of the Ruhr in 1923, this station was the only free station in all of Essen. The station building was demolished in 1984 after the entire section was closed for passenger operations in 1969. The line was mostly closed in 1970, only the section between Essen-Stoppenberg and Essen-Altenessen remained opened as a station track to a mining-test facility until 1978. =Schalke–Herne-Rottbruch= Just over a year later, the opening of the section from Schalke BME via Bismarck (now Gelsenkirchen-Bismarck) station to Herne crossing station (Kreuzungsstation Herne, now Herne- Rottbruch) closed the gap between the two branches and the first freight trains ran over the entire line on 10 January 1876. There were no continuous passenger services, however, as only the western section between Schalke and Bismarck was used by passenger trains, starting on 21 June 1880. After the Winterswijk–Gelsenkirchen-Bismarck railway, built by the Dutch Westphalian Railway Company (Niederländisch-Westfälische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) was opened for passenger traffic one week earlier, the BME took over its operations and ran its trains through to Essen, which meant that these trains had to reverse in Bismarck. =Caternberg–Oberhausen= This section also emerged from a coal mine siding, connecting the Carl colliery in Essen- Altenessen with Caternberg BME station. The line from there to Oberhausen BME station (now Oberhausen Central Station, then still the terminus of its Witten/Dortmund–Oberhausen/Duisburg line) was dismantled by the BME on 23 May 1879. It started at the location of platform tracks 1-3, which no longer exist, and went along the route now used by the Oberhausen combined tram/bus line, running to the north of the Emscher. Here the line turned in a tight curve to the east towards Osterfeld BME station, which was located in the area of the modern Märkischen Straße. On 29 September 1879, the first short section from Caternberg BME to Vogelheim was inaugurated. This was followed on 1 June 1880 by the remaining section via Essen-Horl (formerly a freight yard, later a junction, now disused) and Osterfeld BME (now fully incorporated into the Oberhausen-Osterfeld Süd marshalling yard and located in the Märkischen Straße area). Current situation Since the line, apart from the sections mentioned above, never had great significance for passenger traffic, it was connected with the other lines in the region and optimised for the transport of freight after the BME's nationalisation and integration into the Prussian state railways. The Osterath–Dortmund Süd railway of the RhE was closed to the west of Bochum Präsident and instead traffic ran via route 2152 through Bochum- Riemke station connecting to the Bochum–Herne line. Freight traffic follows the historic route to Gelsenkirchen-Schalke nord and then runs over a curve to Nordstern junction to connect with the CME Emscher Valley Railway, which it then follows to Oberhausen-Osterfeld Süd. The BME route to Oberhausen- Osterfeld Süd Swo signal box is largely closed, except for two sections that serve only as sidings. The street of Helenendamm was built in 1969/70 on a section of the disused line between Burggrafenstraße junction and the former Essen-Katernberg Nord station in Essen-Altenessen. The entire route of the abandoned section of line would be used for an expressway under plans for the closure of a gap of autobahn 52. Services The following sections are now served by passenger services: ;Bochum Hbf–Herne Rottbruch This section is served by the Glückauf-Bahn (\\"Good Luck Railway\\") Regionalbahn service (RB 46) operated by Abellio Rail NRW. From Herne-Rottbruch the line runs over a link (VzG number 2202) to the Cologne-Minden Emscher Valley Railway to Wanne-Eickel Central Station. The former Herne-Rottbruch halt is not served. ;Wanne Unser Fritz–Gelsenkirchen Zoo This two-kilometre section is served by Regionalbahn service RB 43 (Emschertal-Bahn) currently operated by NordWestBahn to the Cologne-Minden Emscher Valley Railway and from Wanne-Eickel over the link (VzG number 2204) to Gelsenkirchen-Bismarck on the line to Dorsten. ;Oberhausen- Osterfeld Süd–Oberhausen Hbf The last part of the line is now intensively used as a public transport route as a combined tram/bus line. The parallel line from Osterfeld to Oberhausen station, built by the Prussian state railways, is used by Regionalbahn service RB 44 (Der Dorstener), also operated by NordWestBahn, from Oberhausen to near Oberhausen-Osterfeld Süd station, where it connects with the Oberhausen-Osterfeld Süd–Hamm railway.

It starts from Kellyville, New South Wales and ends at Northmead, New South Wales. The northern end links with Windsor Road while the southern end links with Cumberland Highway and James Ruse Drive. The North-West T-way runs alongside the entire length of Old Windsor Road. Windsor is connected to Parramatta via the Windsor Road cycleway, with much of its route via the North-West T-way, adjacent to the Old Windsor Road. Description and history Old Windsor Road was part of the original Windsor Road, which opened in 1794.Old Windsor Road and Windsor Road Heritage Precincts, Roads and Transport Authority, Published on 16 November 2010, Retrieved on 16 July 2013 This was the second main road built for the colony of Sydney to connect Parramatta and Windsor—a distance of 23 miles and 16 chains (37.33 km). The northern section of Windsor Road and Old Windsor Road used to be continuous until 1812 when the new Windsor Road from to was completed. As a result, the southern section of the original Windsor Road was renamed Old Windsor Road, and the northern section and the new Windsor Road become continuous, with Old Windsor Road meeting Windsor Road at a T-junction. With the opening of M2 Hills Motorway in 1997, Metroad 2 was realigned to run along Old Windsor Road from the M2 terminus at Winston Hills to Kellyville, and then continuing along the alignment of Windsor Road to Windsor. The junction at Kellyville was reconstructed so that the northern section of Windsor Road became continuous with Old Windsor Road again at a T-junction. In 2007, the junction at Bella Vista was upgraded so that an underpass for Old Windsor Road could be constructed. Recently, State Route 40 was realigned to Old Windsor Road instead of Windsor Road from Kellyville to Northmead. Almost all of its original concrete markers have disappeared with the extensive road widening.

Stafford in the estate records of his parents, chancery court records, and the census. Transcribed records for Baltimore show his name variously as William Josephus Stafford, William J. Stafford, William S. Stafford, and William L. Stafford. Historical reports of the Battle of the Rappahannock refer to him as William S. Stafford, but the research of Feliciano Gamez Duarte shows that he used that as an alias, as well as Joseph Stafford and Jose Guillermo Estifano. After his father died in 1808, William administered the estate and purchased 6 steers and a black boy from it.Richard Stafford Estate, p. 7 Thomas W. Griffith filed a mortgage foreclosure on a piece of property in Baltimore City in Chancery County against William J. & Mary Stafford in 1817.MD Chancery Court In 1820, he was named as a defendant with his brothers and sister in a lawsuit filed by their brother Joseph S. Stafford in the Frederick County, Virginia, Chancery Court.VA Chancery Court Court proceedings continued through at least 1834, with no resolution given in court papers. William J. Stafford was recorded in the 1820 Census for Baltimore, Maryland.1820 Census  War of 1812  William J. Stafford was the first of four generations of Stafford men to become a seaman, attained the rank of captain as commander of the privateer , a 12-gun schooner renowned for outsailing its foes during the War of 1812. Stafford and Dolphin carried Baltimore's privateering commission No. 2, and Stafford was responsible for the first prize captured on 26 July 1812, a British schooner valued at $18,000.Mayer Dolphin operated in the sea lanes from Baltimore to Buenos Aires and across the Atlantic to the coast of Portugal. She captured 11 British ships, nine of which were brought home to Baltimore. On 25 January 1813, Captain Stafford captured the British ships Three Brothers and Hebe. Captain W. A. Brigham of Hebe was taken prisoner and treated by Dolphin's surgeon. He later attributed his recovery to the doctor's attentions and Captain Stafford's tender sympathy and goodness. Brigham actually published a statement in Baltimore acknowledging the kind and humane treatment received by him and his men. They were all given back their clothing and personal possessions, and all the wounded were diligently attended to. Captain Brigham made the statement: \\"Should the fortune of war ever throw Captain Stafford or any of his crew into the hands of the British it is sincerely hoped he will meet a similar treatment\\".Maclay Captain Stafford was well known for his kindness of manner toward prisoners. On 1 April 1813, Stafford was engaged by a British squadron commanded by Lieutenant James Polkinghorne blockading the Rappahannock River, in what is known as Battle of Rappahannock River. After a stubborn fight of fifteen minutes, Captain Stafford surrendered Dolphin and was taken captive, but on April 7 and his surgeon were paroled and sent ashore. The British took Dolphin into service as HMS Dolphin. By November 1813, Stafford commanded another privateer that was attacked by the British in Charleston Harbor.  South American Venture  Following the end of hostilities with the British in 1814, Stafford and other privateers sailed for Cartagena where they were arrested by Spanish forces who confiscated their ships and cargoes. The Spaniards stripped and beat the men with rifle butts before throwing them into prison. This led to the privateers siding with the Venezuelan rebels following their release and plundering Spanish interests.Wikipedia Charges were leveled specifically against Stafford in 1817 and 1818, including piracy of Spanish ships and smuggling of Spanish goods into the United States by various means. Commanding the new brigantine Patriota, built and outfitted in Baltimore, Captain Stafford sailed from Baltimore in early 1817.Head Privateering in the Spanish waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, he adopted a Spanish name—Jose Guillermo Estifano, a rough equivalent of his English name. Records show that he used several aliases and had several ships at his disposal. His brother James Bruce Stafford sailed with him in the period 1818–1819, and commanded one of their prizes on the voyage to Baltimore and Savannah. George Coggeshall, author of History of American Privateers and Letters-of-Marque wrote of his personal acquaintance with Captain Stafford and said that he was \\"a modest, unassuming, gentlemanly man; no one can, for a moment, doubt his unflinching bravery and gallant bearing, when he reflects on the many battles he has gained over the enemies of his country.\\" Coggeshall T.S. Currier, author of The Cruise of the General San Martin, said of Captain Stafford that he was a man who had all the features of the seasoned and unscrupulous privateer, though able to impose his personality upon a crew that was diverse in language and nationality, obsessed with booty, rebellious and often mutinous.Currier Feliciano Gamez Duarte wrote in his doctoral thesis at the University of Cadiz that Stafford must have been a man of great courage with a strong personality and the ability to control his riotous crew by the power of his own will. Such was his confidence that Stafford often had his wife traveling with him.

Adela operated from 1965 to 1980 and was dissolved in 1994. During that period, Adela financed over a thousand private ventures throughout the region. Its model for development was replicated in Africa and Asia. Its investment policies were later adapted by hundreds of investment funds operating throughout the developing world. Origin In 1962, President John F. Kennedy proposed the Alliance for Progress between the United States and the developing countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. The idea was to encourage Latin America to undertake economic and social reforms. In exchange, the United States and the international aid agencies would provide the funding to support the reforms. A Republican Senator from New York, Jacob Javits, proposed that the world's business community join together to form a new corporation that would underwrite private sector investments throughout Latin America. He wanted the private sector to complement governmental programs under the Alliance for Progress. He presented his ideas to a NATO parliamentary meeting in Paris in November 1963. His proposal was endorsed by the delegates, who passed a resolution recommending that the Secretary Generals of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) give their support. A task force was created and funded by the Ford Foundation, led by George S. Moore, President of the First National City Bank (now Citibank), Hermann Abs of Germany's Deutsche Bank and Gianni Agnelli of Fiat, among others. The group proposed to create the Atlantic Development Group for Latin America, or ‘Adela’ for short. They were joined by Senator Javits in inviting private corporations from Europe, North America and Japan to capitalize this new venture. Adela was incorporated in Luxembourg on September 24, 1964. It hired a Swiss engineer, Ernst Keller, as its first Managing Director and opened its operations center in Lima, Peru in early 1965. Adela's founders set out five objectives: # To make a significant contribution to the economic development of Latin America. # To encourage local and foreign investment throughout the region. # To earn a reasonable return on its investments. # To encourage Latin American countries to maintain a favorable climate for foreign investment. # To work closely with its shareholders. Shareholders, directors and advisers A total of 242 private banks and companies invested in Adela. No one shareholder was allowed to own more than 1% of the company so that no single investor could exert excessive influence over its operations. As a bloc, Europe provided the largest number of shareholders, although the United States was the most important single country. Shareholders also came from Japan and six Latin American nations. The combined net worth of Adela's shareholders was the highest of any private corporation ever. Adela's founders included many of the best known company presidents and chairmen, including men such as Marcus Wallenburg Sr., Chairman of Stockholms Enskilda Bank, Mogens Pagh, Chairman of Denmark's East Asiatic Company, Friederick Philips, Chairman of Gloeilampen Fabrieken of Eindhoven of the Netherlands, W. Earle McLaughlin, Chairman of the Royal Bank of Canada. Henry Ford II of the Ford Motor Company, William Blackie of Caterpillar, Sam Carpenter III of du Pont, Max Eisenring, Chairman of Swiss Reinsurance, Thomas J. Watson Jr. of International Business Machines, Yoshinzane Miki of The Fuji Bank, Oskar Nathan of Dresdner Bank and Samuel Schweiser of Swiss Bank Corporation. Adela's Managing Director, Ernst Keller, was advised on business issues by Peter Drucker of the United States, on political matters by Alejandro Orfila of Argentina, a two time Secretary General of the Organization of American States, and on shareholder relations with Marcus Wallenburg Sr. of Sweden. Investment Policies Adela was designed to make minority investments in private corporations in the developing countries of Latin America. The company sought to divest its holdings once they became profitable and would then reinvest the proceeds in a new business. The company also made medium term loans for specific projects, but its primary function was to provide risk capital to Latin American businesses. On occasion, Adela acted as an entrepreneur by taking the lead in creating a new business. Adela worked closely with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The IDB and the IFC both made long term loans to Adela, while USAID provided long-term funding to financial institutions created by Adela with local Latin American investors. Investments and Impact Adela funded over 1,000 private companies for a total amount of $2.5 billion. The size of these investments varied from small printing companies to large steel mills, pulp and paper, hotels, resorts and chemicals. It helped start local development finance companies, which themselves financed even more businesses. At its peak, assets reached half a billion dollars. The Adela model was replicated in Asia (PICA-the Private Investment Company for Asia) originally based in Tokyo, in Africa (SIFIDA-the Societé Internationale Financière pour les Investissements et le Développement en Afrique) based in Geneva and in agriculture (LAAD-Latin American Agribusiness Development Corporation) based in Miami. All were capitalized by multinational corporations and funded investments in private enterprise. Dissolution Adela earned a profit in its first year of operations and continued posting strong earnings for its first decade. However, a growing number of its investments were failing, which forced the company to cease writing new business in 1980. Control of the company was taken over by a creditors committee, management spent 15 years recovering assets and Adela was finally dissolved on September 24, 1994.

It naturally is occurs in the tropical rain forests of tropical Asia and Australia and is often sighted along rain forest margins such as roads. Some common names include October Glory, Glory Vine, Potato Vine and Fragrant Faradaya. Australian indigenous names for F. splendida include Garanggal used from Cairns to Yarrabah, Buku used in the Tully River area, Koie-yan used at Dunk Island and Djungeen used by the Girramay clan.  Description  The woody, twining, evergreen, Liana vine can grow up to 15 cm in diameter. The ovate, glossy green leaves can grow to 24 cm long and 13 cm wide. The leaves are attached to the vine in pairs or triples with stems, petioles, up to 8 cm long. F. splendida flowers and fruits in the warmer months from August to April. The white, fragrant flowers are abundant but short lived, sometimes lasting only a single day. Each flower measures about 4.5 cm in diameter. The fruit is white and fleshy with a single large seed. The fruit resembles a potato or large egg which is 8 cm long and 5 cm in diameter. The rough and brown seed coating is 1 to 3mm thick and covers a smooth seed. File:Faradaya splendida leaf top side.jpgLeaf top side File:Young Faradaya splendida vine with a pair of leaves.jpgYoung petioles File:Faradaya splendida F.Muell., family Lamiaceae, Queensland, 1891? Ellis Rowan 2.jpgArtistic painting  Taxonomy  The species was formally described in 1865 by Victorian government botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae based on plant material collected by John Dallachy near Rockingham Bay. This was the first species to be included in the family Faradaya. The name of the genus, Faradaya, pays tribute to the late scientist Michael Faraday. The species name, splendida, refers to the glossy sheen of its dark green leaves. Many species in the genus Faradaya have found to be synonymous with F. splendida. For example, F. albertisii, F. splendida and F. dimorpha var. cauliflora were considered different species based only on whether the inflorescence was lateral, terminal or cauliflorous. Newer observations found that the different types of inflorescence is found at different stages of the flowering event.  Distribution and habitat  F. splendida occurs in Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Queensland in Australia. It can be found in rain forest, hill forest and swamp forest from sea level to 2000m. The tolerant vine can grow in clay and humus, and can inhabit both undisturbed, primary forest and previously disturbed, secondary forests. It is common to see the white fruited vine along rain forest margins such as roads. Ecology For several Australian butterflies, F. splendida is a larval food plant. Those butterflies include Pseudodipsas eone, Hypochrysops miskini, Shining Oak-blue, Hypolycaena phorbas and Pale ciliate blue. For at least P. eone, this butterfly will seek out F. splendida leaves specifically for the extrafloral nectaries. The nectaries found on the leaves produce nectare and P. eone will only feed one leaves with this characteristic. The Spectacled flying fox is a frugivore that eats F. splendida but is too small to consume and disperse the seed internally. It may disperse the fruit short distances by carrying the fruit. The much larger Southern cassowary also feeds on F. splendida and the seed is one of the largest that the cassowary can ingest. This can disperse the seed over large distances. The fruit and seed of F. splendida are both consumed by the Musky rat-kangaroo. The rat-kangaroo is too small to swallow the seed but will still eat it. F. splendida is one of the prominent vine species that thrive in heavily cyclone damaged forest, otherwise known as cyclone scrub. These areas of forest tend to have a low, uneven canopy level due to damage from local intensification of cyclonic winds where several vine species will grow into the canopy.  Uses  F. splendida is grown as a decorative plant in gardens. Its flowers are attractive and have a pleasant fragrance. When provided with plenty of sunlight and water, the vine is hardy and grows vigorously. For the Australian Aboriginal Girramay clan, the Djungeen vine is an indicator plant. When the egg-like fruit falls to the ground in October, Bush Turkey nests will have eggs in them. Another aboriginal use of F. splendida is to poison fish. The outer bark is removed and the middle layer of the bark is scraped off, then rubbed onto a hot stone. When the stone is thrown into a creek or small lagoon, all marine animals in the water are poisoned and death occurs within an hour. A sapotoxin is found in the leaves, stems and roots of F. splendida which is an effective fish poison. It will readily dissolve in water and is effective even in low concentrations. Based on a word of mouth report, the fruit is said to be edible but is not desired.

He represented the East Pakistan cricket team in four first-class matches during the 1950s. Career Mazhar made his 1st class debut against Vinoo Mankad's Indian team at Chittagong in December 1954. He opened the batting for the East Pakistan side, but the under-prepared pitch at Chittagong meant that batsmen from both sides badly struggled to get runs. The highest score of the match was 51 by the Indian WK batsman M. Mantri (uncle of Sunil Gavaskar). Mazhar made only 3 and 8 in the match. Things only marginally improved for Mazhar in his next 1st class match in January 1956, against MCC. He made 9 and 20 in the match before falling to Tony Lock on both occasions. Lock appeared unplayable to the local batsmen, with figures of 8/17 and 3/0. In January 1958, Mazhar played in two Quaid-e-Azam Trophy matches in Dacca. He also produced his highest 1st class score while playing for East Pakistan against East Pakistan 'A' at Dacca. His score of 35 with 12 wickets helped the East Pakistan side to an easy innings victory, but they were beaten by Dacca University later in the week. Damal had a disappointing match against Dacca University, scoring just 6 & 11\\\\. This was his last 1st class match.

Despite its name, the building has no connection with Canute the Great, nor was it a palace. Name The antiquarian, Sir Henry Englefield suggested that the building had been a palace of Canute the Great, but in fact the house is unconnected with him. In April 1801, Englefield presented a very detailed paper to The Society of Antiquaries of London describing the building, in which he said: > Perhaps I indulge but a fond conjecture, when I consider it possibly the > hall from which Canute, surrounded by his courtiers, viewed the rising tide; > and from whence he descended to the beach, according to that most > interesting narrative of our old historians, to repress by a striking and > impressive lesson, their impious flattery. In 1833, the building was described in The Gentleman's Magazine in which the author, \\"An Architectural Antiquary\\", says: \\"The remains of a very magnificent Norman mansion, improperly called Canute's Palace at Southampton, furnishes the best examples of the elliptical arch with which I am acquainted\\". Description Northern wall of the building Formerly known as the 'Long House', the building was constructed between 1170 and 1200 with walls of uncoursed rubble, and faced the waterfront before the southern section of the town walls was built. The house had two storeys and was built in the hall house style; the room at the eastern end of the upper storey may have been the merchant's counting house. The remains include a window with two round heads which is not original but was added later in the Norman period. Although the gable at the western end is at full height, it has been mostly reconstructed. The gable has a further round-headed window. Canute's Palace is a scheduled monument and a grade I listed building, having obtained the latter status on 14 July 1953. The building is now part of Town Quay Park, which includes the remains of many historical properties in the southern section of the city.

She is best known for her photographs and installations, many focusing on the theme of urban landscape and suburban culture. According to the artist: \\"If you have driven through the streets of most suburbs, you have seen the row houses of equivalent design, decoration, and setback. Such standardization seems depressing to you, but the important thing is that it seems even more depressing to the suburbanite. As a consequence, an enormous amount of effort has been spent by suburbanites to make their homes different from those on either side and across the street. The more identical things are, the more he seeks some distinctive touch to symbolize and validate any particular tract house as his house.\\" Dobson's work has been exhibited worldwide, in countries including: Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Belgium, China, Germany, Spain, and Mexico. She was a contributing artist to the Vancouver 2010 Cultural Olympiad and her work was presented on billboards in Vancouver as part of the exhibition Endlessly Traversed Landscapes.http://www.susandobson.com/cv.html  Biography  Susan Dobson was born in Moncton, New Brunswick, on September 19, 1965. She spent her early years in Canada, eventually moving to Germany due to her father's career change from a land developer to an Opera singer. Although growing up in Germany, she spent summers in Nova Scotia visiting her grandfather. Dobson developed interest in photography when she took her first image at age of 9 or 10 with her mother's Brownie camera. It was a photograph of a poinsettia plant on a windowsill which, due to lighting, appeared as a silhouette in a final print. When Dobson was a teenager, she sought career advice from a nature photographer Freeman Patterson, who provided a perspective on the challenges with pursuing arts, but also practical advice on how to approach it. Dobson pursued a Bachelor of Applied Arts at Ryerson University in Toronto, graduating in 1988, followed by an early career as an editorial photographer in multiple engagements, including Toronto Life and Saturday Night. Dobson received an M.F.A from the University of Guelph in 1997, completed under the mentorship of Suzy Lake. She has been an associate professor at the University of Guelph from 2004 – present (Tenure 2006; Promotion to Associate Professor 2009). =Collections= The Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography, an affiliate of the National Gallery of Canada Macdonald Stewart Art Centre Portland Art Museum BMO Financial Group Accenture Art Gallery of Windsor Frommer Lawrence, Haug, New York Oakville Galleries State Street Trust Company Private Collections =Solo exhibitions= 2016 Come Up to My Room, the Gladstone Hotel, a collaboration with Simone Ferkul, curated by Jana Macalik & Nuria Montblanch. 2015 Viewfinder, Orleans Campus Gallery, Ottawa School of Art, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. 2014 Viewfinder, Michael Gibson Gallery, London, Ontario, Canada. 2012 Transmission, Cambridge Galleries, Cambridge, Ontario, Canada. 11/12 By Design, Robert McLaughlin Gallery, Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. 2010 Dislocation, The Department, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 2010 Endlessly Traversed Landscapes, a site specific billboard installation in conjunction with the Vancouver 2010 Cultural Olympiad.

Generally they are grey with brown polyps. Colour intensity is dependent on light intensity, the higher the intensity of light, the lighter colour of the coral. They form thick trunks with branches that closely resemble trees. In stronger currents they form flatter colonies with shorter branches.  Distribution and habitats  Kenya Tree corals are widespread throughout the Indo-pacific region, from the African coast to the Western Pacific. They are found on coral reef slopes in clear water from deep to the shallows with strong tidal currents. Sometimes found in shadier places and on coral rubble in shallow water close to the shore.  Biology  They have symbiotic algae from which they obtain most of their nutrients. Asexual reproduction has been observed. They form distinctive swellings at bottom of a branch which then drops off by fission at the swelling. The branch then secures to a new hold and forms a new colony. They can stick very quickly and will be firmly rooted within a day. Colonies can bend and reattach to the rock or by “creeping” and division at the base.

He is known for having ventured into the then little known city of Musardu and published an account of it. Early life Benjamin Joseph Knight Anderson was born 1834 in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. His father was named Israel, his mother Henrietta. In December 1851, when he was still a teenager, his family, except for his father, relocated to Liberia on board the Liberia-Packet. Liberia was where he received his education. Career Anderson was a member of Liberia's original military unit. His highest rank was Colonel. From 1864 to 1866, he served as the Liberian Treasury's Comptroller and Secretary. However, in 1879 he was deemed guilty of embezzling money from the treasury. On February 14, 1868, he embarked on a journey to Musardu, a city in what is now found in Republic of Guinea in the western part of the Mandingo region; this made him one of the first people to explore that area. He is written to have convinced the Liberian government to focus on and develop the area more, because many natural resources could be found there and it was strategic for trading. After ending the exploration a year later, he went there again some time later. His accounts of Musardu were published in Narrative of a journey to Musardu: the capital of the Western Mandingoes (1870), which was reprinted a decade and one year later. In his later life, he stopped exploring and settled down as a mathematics teacher at an educational institution in Liberia. He retired in \\"the late 1890s\\". Personal life and death Anderson was married with one child, a son named Benjamin John Knight. According to one source, he died during the middle of December 1910, while another states that he died on June 27, 1910.

Pharmacy2U has been involved in piloting the electronic transfer of prescriptions in the UK. They manage NHS repeat prescriptions on behalf of patients. Pharmacy2U was founded by pharmacist Daniel Lee in November 1999. It launched to the public in June 2000. History The British Medical Association initially had concerns about the use of internet prescribing and wanted to know more about Pharmacy2U's service. The chairman of the BMA's prescribing committee, George Rae, said \\"I would advise against getting private prescriptions over the internet because the patient's GP is not involved\\". By July 2000, the council of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society had established the standards of professional practice for those who wished to provide pharmaceutical services via the internet. By August 2000, Pharmacy2U was one of the founding members of the European Association of Mail Service Pharmacies. Pharmacy2U was involved in the first pilots to trial the electronic transfer of prescriptions (EPS) which went live in June 2002. With EPS, patients could request prescriptions electronically, and receive their medication by a postal delivery rather than picking it up in person. By 2003, Pharmacy2U had incorporated 142 surgeries into its program. In October 2015, Pharmacy2U were fined £130,000 by the Information Commissioner's Office for selling the names and addresses of patients without their permission. A spokesman apologised and said that Pharmacy2U would no longer sell patient data. During the opening of their £3.5 million Leeds-based dispensary in 2015, Pharmacy2U stopped providing medication for several weeks due to a failure in their automated dispensing system. A Pharmacy2U spokesman apologised, saying that \\"unforeseen difficulties\\" had led to \\"unexpected delays for some orders\\". In January 2016, Pharmacy2U merged with ChemistDirect.co.uk who specialise in over-the-counter remedies. ChemistDirect.co.uk's Mark Livingstone took on the role of CEO for the newly formed group with Daniel Lee moving to chief pharmacy officer. In July 2017, Pharmacy2U's direct mail was criticised for leaving patients confused about their repeat prescriptions. The company was in a legal dispute in late 2018 over the rights of the contact details of members of the National Pharmacy Association. The presiding judge expressed concerns over the company's ability to \\"pick off\\" individual members. As of May 2019, Pharmacy2U has over 350,000 nominated EPS patients. In November 2019, Pharmacy2U dispensed over 621,128 prescription items. Pharmacy2U was named no.91 in 2019's Sunday Times Tech Track 100. The company made a loss of £16 million in 2018/19, although it added 330,000 new NHS patients and dispensed more than 5.3 million NHS prescriptions. In 2020, Pharmacy2U is opening a new state-of-the-art dispensary in Leicester. It will be almost completely automated and capable of dispensing up to 6.5 million prescription items a month.

Cilmi explained, \\"If you've ever experienced any type of 'Vicious Love' you will know that sometimes despite all the arrows pointing to a dead end there is just no way out, there is no way back. But then again don't all roads lead to dead ends?

I wanted it to sound the way Italian neo-realist photographs look, that post-war, ruined glamour which is really gritty and heart-breaking. I was listening to a lot of Trip Hop, that 90s Bristol sound, Portishead and Tricky. But also singer- songwriters I had always loved, Neil Young, John Martyn. And old soul records, Bessie Smith, Otis Redding. It all went in there.\\" In an interview with Billboard about the process of making 'The Sting', Gabriella stated, \\"The whole idea of 'The Sting' came as an aftermath to breaking-up with my label, and management and boyfriend at the time.

His sister María de Padilla was the mistress of King Peter of Castile, the Cruel. Padilla fought for Peter of Castile in the wars against Aragon and Granada. In the Castilian Civil War (1366–69) he went over to the side of Henry of Trastámara. Early years Diego García de Padilla y Villágera was the son of Juan Diego García de Padilla and María Gómez de Hinestrosa. He belonged to a collateral branch of the Padilla family, the lords of Villágera. His sister was María Díaz de Padilla (1333-1361), who became the King's lover. His brother, Juan García de Padilla, was made nominal Master of the Order of Santiago by the King. Diego García de Padilla was elected Master of Calatrava in 1355 at the request of Peter of Castile. Padilla had his predecessor, Juan Núñez de Prado, put to death. The \\"War of the Two Pedros\\", a struggle between Pere III of Aragon and Peter of Castile, began in 1356 and would last until 1366. On the southern frontier of Aragon, forces led by Padilla sacked Jinosa and Monòver in August 1356. In 1357 Padilla was made mayordomo mayor to Peter of Castile, replacing Juan Fernández de Henestrosa as the head of the king's household. In this influential position he was in charge of all activities at the court, and kept the kings's accounts. Granadan campaign In 1361 the deposed Emir of Granada, Muhammad V, obtained the support of Peter of Castille in regaining his throne. Padilla defeated a Moorish army of 2000 foot and 600 cavalry in the Battle of Linuesa on the eve of St. Thomas, 1361. In January 1362, as Master of the Order of Calatrava and adelantado mayor of the Frontier, he was one of the leaders of the Castilian forces at the Battle of Guadix, along with Enrique Enríquez the Younger, commanding the forces of the Bishop of Jaén, Men Rodríguez de Biedma and other noblemen. The chronicler Pero López de Ayala said the Castilians had low morale because the king had unjustly taken valuable Moorish prisoners from them that they had captured the previous year. The Castilians were decisively defeated by troops of the Emirate of Granada. Padilla was wounded in one arm and taken prisoner with eight of his fellow knights. He was released soon after the battle. Later career In the spring of 1362 Diego García de Padilla was among the notables who said they had witnessed a private marriage between Pedro and Padilla's sister María. For this reason, the King's later marriage to Blanche of Bourbon had been illegal, and María's children were legitimate. Padilla remained mayordomo until 1363. In 1366 the Castilian Civil War began when Henry of Trastámara, natural son of King Alfonso XI of Castile, fought his older half brother Peter of Castile to usurp the throne. After being crowned at Burgos, Henry made his way to Toledo. Padilla came over to Henry's side at this time. After the Battle of Nájera (3 April 1367), Peter sent him as a prisoner to Alcalá de Guadaíra Castle near Seville, where he died in 1368.

After the death of Ali Birru, Yejju was ruled by Dejazmach Zegeye Birru, who consolidated his rule of Yejju and at the same time extended it as far as River Ubuye, near the border with Tigray. However, the relationship between Dejazmach Zegeye and that of Emperor Yohannes IV became strained, when the emperor detached the land beyond Alla Wuha and gave it to Ras Gebre Medhin of Tigray as a sign of affection. Apparently this was a time when the Dervishes were moving towards Metema. To defend the motherland from the Dervishes, the emperor ordered Zegeye to mobilize an expeditionary force to Metema. Zegeye pretended that he was ill, but was forced to maneuver his soldiers against the invaders. Still under the pretense of illness, Zegeye went on a stretcher from Yejju to Metema. In Metema, Emperor Yohannes IV died and when Zegaye saw the death of the emperor, he jumped off the stretcher and came back to Yejju. After his release from Maqdala, Ras Welle Betul, who was the brother of Menelik's wife Empress Taytu Betul, went to Shewa to visit Menelik II whom he knew while in prison in Maqdala under Emperor Tewodros II. After a brief stay, Menelik II bestowed on Welle the title of Ras and appointed him governor of Yejju. This, however, led Dejazmach Zegeye to take up arms against Welle in Lasta. They met at battle, which is sometimes called Dengobat and at other times Gelesoi. There, Dejazmach Zegeye was killed.

Coming to Yale Law School in 1982, he was immersed in that institution's distinctive problem- oriented approach to law, saw it as a liberation from the straitjacket of positivism, and redefined the role of the lawyer as leader and problem solver in society, a \\"doctor of the social order.\\" By taking into account conflicting claims, past trends in decision and evaluating past decisions in light of a public order of human dignity, he suggests developing decisions best suited to maximize access by all to all things humans value.

I have S1, Illmind and a group of guys from Virginia that goes by the name of Profound Sounds who actually did the title cut \\"Hear Ye Him.\\" They also did \\"Bury That\\" as well. There's also a young lady here from Virginia named Bri and she's on a song called \\"Different.\\" She's a young 19-year-old with an incredible voice. John Bibbs, he's from Richmond, also on \\"Bury That.\\" Cam Calloway. He produced a song called \\"Blasphemy,\\" that's featuring Famlay. I definitely kept the spotlight on Virginia.\\" On July 17, 2013, it was announced the intended released on August 18, 2013. On July 29, 2013, the final track listing and album cover were revealed, revealing 17 tracks and guest appearances on the album from Ab-Liva, Fam-Lay, Life Dutchee, Pusha T, Jon Bibbs, Eric David, PK Oneday, Bri and Jaeson Ma. Release and promotion On June 19, 2012, the first song from the album \\"June\\" featuring Eric David was released. On July 11, 2012, the music video was released for \\"June\\". On July 24, 2012, the second song from the album \\"Unforgettable\\" featuring Life Dutchee was released, with the music video for the song following on September 18, 2012. On January 15, 2013, the third song from the album \\"Smoke & Mirrors\\" featuring Ab-Liva was released. On January 23, 2013, the music video was released for \\"Smoke & Mirrors\\". On June 4, 2013, the fourth song from the album, \\"Bury That\\" featuring Jon Bibbs, debuted. On August 13, 2013, Funkmaster Flex released the song \\"Shame the Devil\\" featuring Pusha T. On November 26, 2013, the music video was released for \\"Bury That\\" featuring Jon Bibbs. On February 16, 2014, the music video was released for \\"Blasphemy\\" featuring Fam-Lay. Critical response Hear Ye Him was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Matthew Sanderson of AllHipHop gave the album a nine out of ten, saying \\"Hear Ye Him isn’t too far removed for the old Malice, introspective flows on the drug game, and its repercussions on one’s self and family. There are no filler hooks here. Rhymes are intelligent and concise, and they cut like a knife. The same high caliber raps The Clipse were known for are on this album. On “Shame The Devil”, No Malice spits “I too was a derelict, but the truth raised me from the dead when I became aware of it”. Hear Ye Him has quotables for days. Only downside here, too many interludes! I want more bars. No Malice did not disappoint here. An excellent solo effort and I hope it is not the last.\\" Reed Jackson of XXL gave the album an L, saying \\"Hear Ye Him is also hurt by its production. The beats, no longer full of the synth-laced bounce of Pharrell, are mostly carbon copy affairs. The lurking keys heard on “Bow Down No Mo” sound like they were ripped directly from an old Lex Luger beat, and the lively rhythms of “Unforgettable” sound too much like the material electronic duo Ratatat released years ago. The album’s most impressive instrumental, a dancehall-influenced thumper, comes on “Shame The Devil,” which features the album’s only appearance from Pusha T. On it, the brothers sound just like old times, and No Malice delivers his sharpest line, ironically about coke, when he spits, “Mozart never tickled this many keys.” But moments like these are only brief lightning strikes of nostalgia. On “Still Got Love,” No Malice talks directly to all his former cohorts—Pusha, Pharrell and even Sandman—and announces with confidence that “everything must come to an end.” Unfortunately, this also could signify the end of the witty punch lines and captivating storytelling that drew listeners to Clipse in the first place.\\" Ronald Grant of HipHopDX gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying \\"Hear Ye Him would be all the better if No Malice could rekindle the burning secular lyrical embers of the past more steadily instead of sometimes dismissively, albeit not completely, leaving them in the dust. And even though No Malice’s candor in owning up to his past as well as pretty much remaining the same guy is commendable and energizing, he hasn’t quite found the perfect equilibrium between the brash, self-assured passion in lyrical delivery of his former self and the more reflective and topical nature of his new Rap persona. Still, with a renewed focus and an ambitious new musical direction, No Malice has created in Hear Ye Him a viable contender for at the least being honorably mentioned as a notable Hip Hop album of 2013. And unlike many of its contemporaries, both fans of Christian Hip Hop and those that steer towards more worldly fare, contradictions and all, can appreciate it.\\" Craig Jenkins of Spin gave the album a five out of ten, saying \\"The album flashes vital signs only when he eases up on the proselytizing to examine the fallout from a life spent in and around the drug game. The lingering pride that haunts \\"Bury That\\" and \\"Unforgettable\\" undercuts his moralizing by positing the reborn rapper as a work in progress who maybe misses the trap. Jeremiads about Gonzalez' shattered family illuminate the impetus for Malice's rapid shift from coke-rap menace to Christian-rap luminary; \\"Still Got Love,\\" the album's masterstroke, employs a clutch sample of the O'Jays' \\"Loving You\\" to address the question of whether his family and friends are cool with the conversion. The answer is a resounding yes, though it's really the staid, affable charm of the telling that's the true revelation. It's one of only a few reminders throughout Hear Ye Him that the humble, genteel No Malice still has some juice left.\\" Track listing References Category:2013 debut albums Category:Albums produced by Illmind Category:Albums produced by Chad Hugo Category:Albums produced by Symbolyc One ","title":"Hear Ye Him"},{"id":"40003189","text":"Tom Craig is a British documentary photographer.TOM CRAIG\\" F2 FREELANCE+DIGITAL.

It lies in the historic county of Hampshire. It borders with Mudeford and is intersected by the Somerford Road (B3059). On the north side is an area of residential housing, originally developed as a council estate in the 1950s.http://www.dorsetforyou.com/media.jsp?mediaid=155711&filetype;=pdf The district has three schools: Somerford Infants, Somerford Junior and The Grange School. The present day biggest employer is BAE Systems (previously as Plessey). Historically, the biggest employers were Airspeed, de Havilland and Gardner's. Origin of name Somerford was named after a ford over the River Mude which was only passable in summertime. Its approximate site is that of the current day Somerford Roundabout.Christchurch Historic Urban Character Area 18 Somerford Housing Estates & Former Airfield Manor, grange, fishpond and farm Historically, Somerford was a manor extending from the east side of Christchurch Harbour in the west to Chewton in the east. It is first mentioned in a document dated AD 1140 which confirmed the grant of the estate to Christchurch Priory. The manor included the hamlets of Bure, Chewton, Street, Stanpit, Hoburne and Clive (Highcliffe). The manor formed the grange of the Priory and was also the residence of the Abbot. The medieval settlement of Somerford was probably situated close to the grange which was itself probably located approximately 250m south of the current day Somerford Roundabout. The 1st edition OS map shows a fishpond which may represent a medieval monastic feature. Somerford Grange and Somerford Farm were held separate from each other following the dissolution of Christchurch Priory and survived until 1935 when they were demolished to make way for the airfield.Somerford Grange, HampshireHistory of the Somerford estate, ChristchurchChristchurch (Christchurch Twyneham) Christchurch Airfield Christchurch Airfield was located southeast of the A337/B3059 intersection in Somerford. It was a civil airfield starting from 1926, then it was used during World War II by the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces Ninth Air Force. After the war the airfield returned to civilian use and the airfield complex was then demolished in 1966. Gardner's Cecil Gardner had already made a name for himself manufacturing radio sets, recharging accumulators and ac/dc transformers from a small factory in Southbourne; when in 1939 he moved into a purpose built factory in Somerford Road, Christchurch. He soon had plenty of business making transformers for American pilots who needed to convert the British 240 volt supply to the 110 volt they were using, and lighting transformers for air raid shelters. Gardner's also won contracts with the Telecommunications Research Establishment and the Ministry of Aircraft Production. After the war, contracts from the Admiralty and the Atomic Energy Research Establishment allowed the business to grow and Gardner's were soon employing around 300 people. Gardner's contributed to the local economy not just because it was a major employer but also because it attracted others to the area such as Penny and Giles (potentiometers) and Plessey Defence Systems who came to take advantage of the local skilled workforce. The factory closed in the late 1990s partly due to an increase in cheap imports. Ashrama Hall and Christchurch Garden Theatre A local group of the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship was formed in Christchurch in 1930. The local group’s headquarters was a wooden building named the Ashrama Hall, completed in 1936 in the garden of a house owned by Catherine Emily Chalk on the corner of Somerford Way and Somerford Road. In 1938, on the same land, the group built the Christchurch Garden Theatre in Somerford Way. It was capable of seating 360 people. At the theatre’s official opening it was described not only as the first Rosicrucian theatre in England but the first theatre in the borough of Christchurch. It presented mystically-themed plays, written by George Alexander Sullivan under his journalistic pen-name Alex Matthews. Among the Rosicrucian Players was a small group who formed a coven of witches (New Forest coven). Gerald Gardner, a retired colonial civil servant, joined them after moving to Highcliffe in 1938. Gardner went on to take a leading role in the modern revival of witchcraft - often referred to as Wicca. The theatre was never popular and closed shortly after Sullivan’s death in 1942. It was then used as a training centre for de Havilland. The theatre was destroyed by fire in 1975.Christchurch Garden TheatreRosicrucian Collection (Special Collections) References External links * Category:Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole ","title":"Somerford, Dorset"},{"id":"40003233","text":"Man wearing a zamarra A zamarra is a sheepskin coat worn by Spanish shepherds.

The work, composed of copper and steel, is tall and weighs . From May 2010 to February 2011, the sculpture was installed at the Joseph L. Alioto Performing Arts Piazza in San Francisco's Civic Center, before moving to Hong Kong later that year from May to July. A slightly modified version was exhibited in Florence in 2013. The copper sculpture is the artist's largest work to date. Three Heads Six Arms is part of a larger series of monumental works by Zhang depicting the arms, legs, feet, hands, and heads of Buddhist sculptures. History and reception Three Heads Six Arms was completed in 2008 and kept initially at Zhang Huan's studio near Shanghai, China. The San Francisco Arts Commission (SFAC) contacted Zhang in 2009 to enquire if he would be willing to loan the piece to San Francisco in honor of the 30-year sister city relationship between Shanghai and San Francisco, which was to be celebrated during 2010. The Shanghai–San Francisco agreement commenced on January 28, 1980, and is one of the oldest sister-city relationships between the United States and China. The sculpture's installation would also coincided with the 2010 World Expo, hosted by Shanghai and complement the Asian Art Museum's Shanghai exhibition, which was one of the cornerstones of the sister-city anniversary celebration. The Asian Art Museum is housed in the former main branch building of the city's public library, adjacent to Civic Center Plaza, where the sculpture was eventually installed. The piece was part of an art exchange: California artist Chase Chen (the older brother of actress Joan Chen) loaned The Sprout to Shanghai indefinitely, where it was installed in front of the former No. 3 Steel Factory. The Sprout was recycled from a cauldron. The artist and Pace Gallery (his New York representative) agreed to loan the piece at no charge; the first official announcements were made in mid-January 2010, under the name Three-Headed, Six-Armed Buddha. At the time, the cost of shipping the statue to San Francisco was expected to reach $100,000, and funding for the shipment was uncertain. Formal plans were announced within a week. Senator Dianne Feinstein intervened to lift a hold that Customs had placed on the sculpture during its entry at Long Beach. Shipping services were donated, and the National Endowment for the Arts provided a $70,000 public arts grant to help cover installation costs. Atthowe Fine Art Services (based in Oakland) designed the transportation and installed the piece, carefully choosing the site so the statue was supported sufficiently, since Civic Center Plaza lies atop an underground parking garage and exhibition hall. Three Heads Six Arms was formally dedicated by Mayor Gavin Newsom on May 12, 2010, before a crowd of 200. Early public impressions of the sculpture were favorable, although staff writers for the San Francisco Examiner called it \\"striking, bizarre and fairly overwhelming.\\" Later that night, the SFAC and the Asian Art Museum hosted a public program featuring a conversation between Zhang Huan and the Museum's Michael Knight, senior curator of Chinese art and deputy director of strategic programs and partnerships. It was fenced off for three weeks in June 2010 after it had attracted graffiti declaring \\"Jesus is the one\\", in anticipation that future crowds and parade-goers might also damage the statue. Although at least one attempt was made to extend the loan, the temporary installation and sculpture were dismantled on February 15, 2011, after its one-year lease from the Chinese government expired. After its tenure in San Francisco, the sculpture was exhibited at 1881 Heritage by the Edouard Malingue Gallery in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong, from May 23 to July 17, 2011, coinciding with Zhang's first solo exhibition there. The sculpture was honored at the annual Americans for the Arts convention in June 2011. The sculpture was acquired by 2012 for the permanent collection of the art and retail campus in Beijing; it has since been displayed at the outdoor garden there, with a temporary loan from July 8 to October 13, 2013, to Forte di Belvedere in Florence, Italy, as part of Zhang's Soul and Matter exhibition. By 2013, when it was exhibited in Florence, the appearance was updated by highlighting the weld joints between plates with bright copper. Design and construction The Buddhist sculpture- inspired series was sparked by several fragments of Buddhist statues that had been purchased by the artist in a Tibetan market; they were remnants from larger works that were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Zhang retired from performance art shortly after moving from New York City to Shanghai and acquiring the first fragments. Three Heads Six Arms, completed in 2008, was the largest piece in the series to date, measuring . Zhang started with draft sketches in ink. Based on these drafts, his assistants created a scale model in clay measuring approximately , which was used to build another model in steel and glass. The hands and body of the steel and glass model were used by the copper workshop to build the sculpture. For shipping, the sculpture can be broken into nine pieces; it took three days to assemble the sculpture on Civic Center Plaza using a team of eight to ten people, a forklift, and a crane. The sculpture is assembled from the inside; the arms are used as exits until the last arm is attached, and a hidden trapdoor in one head allows the technicians to leave the completed piece. The faces were created by adding clay over a welded steel armature; the clay-and-steel buck was used as a form to shape the hammered copper skin. After the copper skin was formed, the pieces were welded together to form the head. The sculpture was inspired by Zhang's connection of the Chinese folk religion protection deity Nezha with Tibetan Buddhist sculptures; of the three faces, two used human features (including a self- portrait of the artist) and the other one retained the Buddha's features. The weld joints were deliberately left unfinished. According to Zhang: \\"When using pieces of copper to make Buddhist images, I like to keep the original character of the copper and the traces of the welding. For me, pieces of copper are like stitched skin after an operation.\\" Derivative works A smaller version entitled Small Three Heads Six Arms () was completed in 2011, measuring ; it was shown at the Storm King Art Center near Mountainville, New York, in 2014. For the 2014 Taoyuan Land Art Festival in Taoyuan, Taiwan, a similar copper and steel sculpture with multiple heads and arms entitled The Six Paths of Transmigration () was on display at the decommissioned Taoyuan Air Base between September 4 and September 14, 2014. This sculpture was slightly smaller than the earlier Three Heads Six Arms (2008) at .

The bill deals with education policy and would alter parts of both the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the No Child Left Behind Act. The Student Success Act passed in a House vote of 221-207 on July 19, 2013. Background The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 had specific requirements for schools to pass increasingly high standards on state tests. The Obama administration waived some of the requirements of the NCLB. Republicans argued that waivers are only a temporary fix, thus the necessity of a reform bill. They also criticized these waivers, arguing that the Obama Administration was using them to control the states. It was sponsored by House Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline (R-Minn.) and Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education Chairman Todd Rokita (R-Ind.). Provisions of the bill The Student Success Act would \\"end more than 70 federal education programs and the federal government's metrics for measuring school performance.\\" * The bill gives individual states more control over their own education systems. * The bill promotes charter schools. * An amendment to the bill, adopted on July 18, 2013 by a vote of 239-187, would forbid the federal government from imposing additional requirements on the states unless those requirements are specifically authorized by law. * Elimination of federal mandated actions and interventions currently required of poor performing schools. * Allow Title I schools to receive funds to promote the academic achievement of students in need. * The bill waives State rights for any state approving the grant program. The state must comply with any requirement. This nullifies school board and parental rights as well. Bill Text: Student Success Act page: 553 http://edworkforce.house.gov/uploadedfiles/student_success_act_- _introduction.pdf \\"...the state legislature is expressly approving the grant program and, in doing so,waiving the State's rights and authorities to act inconsistently with any requirement that might be imposed by the Secretary as a condition of receiving that assistance.\\" Procedural history =House= The Student Success Act was introduced into the House of Representatives on June 6, 2013 by Rep. John Kline (R-MN). It was referred to both the United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce and the United States House Committee on Financial Services. On June 19, 2013, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce ordered the bill to be reported (amended) by a vote of 23-16. Both committees discharged the bill on July 11, 2013 and it was placed on the Union Calendar, Calendar No. 108. A rule about the bill from the United States House Committee on Rules allows 26 different amendments to be discussed – 15 are from Republicans, seven are from Democrats, and the remaining four are considered to be bipartisan. The House passed this bill 230-190, with only three Democrats voting in favor of the rule. On July 19, 2013, the House voted to pass the Student Success Act in Roll Call 374 221-207. All of the Democrats and 12 of the Republicans voted against the bill. House Report 113-150 part 1 The Student Success Act was reported on July 11, 2013 alongside House Report 113-150 pt 1. This 973 page long report contains the full text of the bill (the first 133 pages), followed by information about the purpose of the bill, a history of committee hearings on the subject (dating back to September 2003), information about amendments that were adopted, and so forth. According to the report, the purpose of the bill is: \\"H.R. 5, the Student Success Act, amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to support state and local accountability for public education, provide important information to parents on their schools’ and students’ performance, enhance local flexibility, protect taxpayers’ investments in education, strengthen state and local autonomy, support more effective teachers in the classroom, and provide state and local leaders with the freedom to direct federal resources to the programs that best serve their student populations. The Student Success Act reflects the four principles for reform outlined by the Committee on Education and the Workforce: reducing the federal footprint, restoring local control, supporting effective teachers, and empowering parents.\\" A summary of the bill is found from page 169 to page 1798. =Senate= The United States Senate was expected to ignore the bill, instead working on its own bill about education reform. =Presidential reaction= The White House said that President of the United States Barack Obama would veto the bill. Congressional Budget office report This summary is primarily taken from a report published by the Congressional Budget Office on July 19, 2013, a public domain source. H.R. 5 would amend and reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (the ESEA, commonly referred to, in its most recently reauthorized form, as No Child Left Behind). The underlying authorizations for those programs have expired, although most have received appropriations since their authorizations have expired. This bill would authorize funding through fiscal year 2019 for various grant programs; those authorizations would automatically be extended one year, through 2020, under the General Education Provisions Act. The bill also would amend and reauthorize the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act, which authorizes grants to assist in the education of homeless children. CBO estimates that H.R. 5 would authorize the appropriation of $22.9 billion in 2014 and $114.3 billion over the 2014–2018 period. Implementing the bill would have discretionary costs of $85.6 billion over the 2014–2018 period, assuming appropriation of the estimated amounts. Debate and discussion The Student Success Act was primarily supported by Republicans. The Republicans argued that the reduction of federal programs and government metrics are necessary to give the states more control over their own education systems. Republicans contended that state and local officials are in a better position than the federal government to decide what their students need. They also argued that parents would take better care of their children than bureaucrats from the United States Department of Education. The Student Success Act did not receive very much support from Democrats. Although many Democrats concurred with Republicans that the No Child Left Behind Act needed to be reformed, they thought that the Student Success Act loosen the standards too much. Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO) argued against the bill, because if the Student Success Act becomes law, \\"state's wouldn't even be required to set performance targets based on student growth, proficiency or graduation rates... Effectively, it would allow states to define success down simply to make themselves of their districts look good. Some Democrats also argued against the bill because they feared it would give the states freedom to ignore special needs students, as well as those just starting to learn English. The bill is opposed by some teachers unions because it promotes charter schools. It is also opposed by some conservatives who fear that the bill will ultimately reduce parental control of their children's education and will impair religious freedom by giving states more control over private schools.https://whatiscommoncore.wordpress.com/2015/02/21/student-success-act- to-crush-religious-freedom-private-school-autonomy-parental-rights-no-on-hr5/ See also * List of bills in the 113th United States Congress * Elementary and Secondary Education Act * No Child Left Behind Act Notes/references External links * Library of Congress – Thomas H.R. 5 * beta.congress.gov H.R. 5 * GovTrack.us H.R. 5 * OpenCongress.org H.R. 5 * WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 5 * House Republicans' Legislative Digest on H.R. 5 * House Report 113-150 part 1 on H.R. 5 * Committee on Education and the Workforce's webpage on H.R. 5 * Article contains a partial list of amendments offered on H.R. 5 and whether they passed * Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 5 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:United States proposed federal education legislation ","title":"Student Success Act"},{"id":"40003260","text":"The men's team portion of Table tennis at the 2013 Summer Universiade was held between July 7–12.

It stars Jared Harris as a university professor attempting to prove poltergeists are manifestations of the human psyche and not supernatural beings. The film was released on April 10th, 2014, in the United Kingdom and April 25th, 2014, in the United States. Plot In 1974 a student attends the class of Oxford University Professor Coupland, who wishes to prove that the supernatural does not exist. Coupland shows a video of a possessed boy and explains that research will be done to find a cure for this kind of disorder. One of his students, Brian McNeil, is invited to film the experiment process and joins Coupland, his two assistants Krissi and Harry, and their subject Jane Harper, a young woman who generates strange phenomena and has been abandoned. Jane is generally kept locked in a room with loud rock music playing during the daytime to prevent her from sleeping in the hopes that the regime of sleep deprivation will result in increased activity. Once his funding is taken away by an exasperated College Board that is both annoyed about the disturbances he makes and his lack of results, Coupland and his assistants settle in an isolated house in the countryside to keep experimenting on Jane. Her negative energy takes the form of \\"Evey\\", an infant doll-like creature only Jane sees. Coupland instructs Jane to transfer her negative energy into a physical doll so they can destroy it. The further the researchers drive Jane to insanity with their methods, the stranger things get around the house. Brian is upset by the way Jane is treated and the lack of ethics in the experiment. Evey's apparitions become increasingly aggressive, and Jane begins to harm herself. There are also indicators that any attempt to harm Evey harms Jane. Coupland refuses to stop the inhumane experimentation. He is irrevocably convinced that \\"Evey\\" is merely a conventionally treatable, parapsychological disorder in Jane's head, but the others become convinced over time that Evey is a true malevolent, supernatural force. Brian and Jane become closer and share a kiss. When the group experience another attack by Evey, Brian goes to Oxford, where he discovers that a symbol that was marked into Jane is from a cult who worshiped a Sumerian demon. They performed experiments on a young girl a few years ago; their leader believed that Evey Dwyer, a girl with clairvoyant abilities, was the one to bring their \\"idol\\" into the physical world. Everybody in the cult died in a house fire that Evey set, including Evey herself. Brian returns and tells them about the cult, certain that Evey is a demonic presence who is possessing Jane. He convinces Harry and Krissi, but Coupland denies his theory and responds that Evey must be a figment from Jane's past rather than a demonic force. After a heated argument, the group are marked with the same symbol Jane had. An unknown force murders Krissi and Harry. Jane realizes that she was the little girl that supposedly died in the house fire; she was born with clairvoyant powers and had set the house on fire to kill everyone. The authorities changed her name to Jane to give her a normal life, which is why negative energy is manifesting; Evey is not a demon, she is Jane's real identity (one who can't escape the trauma of her past life). Evey then attacks Brian, only for them both to be knocked out by Coupland. When Brian wakes up, he sees Coupland give Jane a lethal injection, as he thinks stopping her heart long enough for the negative energy to dissipate will permanently cure her. However, before Coupland can prove his theory, Brian subdues Coupland and brings Jane back to life. Once revived, Jane locks him out of the room and commits suicide by setting herself on fire. The screen cuts few months later likely December in the form of a film footage where Brian in what appears to be an interrogation room is holding the camera. Somebody asks him what happened and how everybody died. Brian explains that everything that happened was captured on film. The person says that there is nothing on the film, and that everything in the house, including the films, were destroyed by the fire and ask what really happened and if he is responsible for all this.Brian gestures his hand and emits smoke from it just as Jane's did.

The group aimed to take control of the country from president Heydar Aliyev and reinstall former president Abulfaz Elchibey. The coup was foiled when the Turkish President Süleyman Demirel became aware of elements in Turkey supporting the plot, and called Aliyev to warn him. On 17 March 1995, units of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces surrounded the insurgents' camp and assaulted it, killing Colonel Javadov. Reports in Turkey following the 1996 Susurluk scandal elaborated on support for the coup from elements in Turkey.  Events  On 12 December 1994 a team of people, including Korkut Eken (Turkish National Intelligence Organization, MİT), İbrahim Şahin and Ayhan Çarkın (Turkish Police Special Operations Department) and Abdullah Çatlı (contract killer), traveled from Turkey to Azerbaijan in order to train a unit of 60 OMON police officers for the coup. They were invited by OMON commander Rovshan Javadov, a KGB defector to the CIA, who also directed the abortive coup. The KGB/FSB and CIA closely monitored events. According to the newspaper Yeni Şafak, the coup was directed by Turkish colonel Necabettin Ergenekon, while he was allegedly the commander of the Adıyaman Gendarmerie Regiment. However, other newspapers report that he retired in 1982 from the Adıyaman Martial Law Command (). Yeni Şafak also alleged that Elchibey is related to Turkish General Veli Küçük. The coup was foiled after the MİT tipped off President Süleyman Demirel on 10 March 1995 and he called Aliyev. On 17 March 1995, units of Azerbaijani Armed Forces surrounded the insurgents in their camp and assaulted it, killing Javadov.Los Angeles Times, 18 March 1995, Azerbaijan Coup Attempt Crushed Caucasus: Loyal forces storm a building and overcome mutinous police units, president reports.  Motivations  According to a 1996 MİT report, Turkish prime minister Tansu Çiller gave minister Ayvaz Gökdemir, police chief Mehmet Ağar, İbrahim Şahin, and Korkut Eken the green light to install Elçibey as president. Elçibey was an ideological ally of Turkish Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) politician Alparslan Türkeş, who harbored aspirations of creating a Turkic state stretching across the Caucasus. Türkeş' support of the coup attempt also provoked a diplomatic crisis between Turkey and Azerbaijan, and the latter country officially requested a statement refuting the section of the report dealing with the attempted coup. The 1996 Susurluk report (following the Susurluk scandal) said that Prime Minister Çiller's chief counselors, Acar Okan and Süleyman Kamil Yüceoral, were involved in the coup attempt. Susurluk Commission member Fikri Sağlar argued that the purpose of the coup was to secure the narcotics route, which started in Afghanistan. Sağlar pointed out that Yüceoral was involved in paying general Rashid Dostum in Afghanistan from a slush fund. Later press reports claimed that the Ergenekon gang, of which General Veli Küçük is a suspected member, was responsible for the coup attempt, indicating a relationship between Susurluk and Ergenekon.

Its holdings include various apparel, athletics, and entertainment brands, for which it partners with other companies to license and merchandise. ABG owns more than 50 consumer brands, as well as the likeness rights and/or estates to a number of celebrities, including Muhammad Ali, Elvis Presley, Shaquille O'Neal, and Marilyn Monroe. History The company was founded in 2010 by Jamie Salter, after he stepped down from his role as CEO of Hilco Consumer Capital—a company that was involved in the restructuring of struggling consumer brands (such as Bombay Company and Polaroid Corporation). Salter invested $250 million in the new venture, and the majority of the equity was sold to Leonard Green & Partners. Two of ABG's first major purchases were the clothing brands Silver Star and Tapout. In January 2011, Authentic Brands Group acquired rights to the likeness of Marilyn Monroe. On October 7, 2013, Authentic Brands Group announced the purchase of Juicy Couture from Fifth & Pacific for $195 million. The following month, ABG acquired the estate of Muhammad Ali, and CORE Media Group's 85% stake in Elvis Presley Enterprises (which includes the estate of Elvis Presley, likeness rights, and music publishing assets). In December 2015, basketball player Shaquille O'Neal signed with ABG to manage his likeness and marketing rights. In September 2016, Julius Erving also sold his name and licensing rights to ABG, and Aéropostale was purchased out of bankruptcy by a consortium that included ABG and other investors. In March 2017, ABG became the controlling partner of Greg Norman's consumer products business. In March 2018, ABG announced that they would acquire Nautica from VF Corporation. On June 10, 2018, ABG announced that it was the winning bidder for the intellectual property of Nine West Holdings. The acquisition was completed on July 3, 2018. On October 10, 2018, ABG announced that it had entered into an agreement to purchase a majority stake in the intellectual property of the Camuto Group's proprietary brands in partnership with DSW Inc. On May 27, 2019, ABG announced its acquisition of sports magazine Sports Illustrated from Meredith Corporation for $110 million. The company stated it planned to leverage its trademarks and other non-core assets in new ventures. Meredith will continue to publish the Sports Illustrated magazine and digital properties under license for at least two years. On June 18, 2019, it was announced that rights to publish the Sports Illustrated editorial operations would be licensed to The Maven under a 10-year deal, with Ross Levinsohn as CEO. In August 2019, BlackRock became the largest shareholder in Authentic Brands. In May 2020, Authentic Brands Group and David Glasser’s 101 Studios formed a joint venture, Sports Illustrated Studios, for feature film and television projects. The joint venture would have a slate of several TV series and films per year. The first announced project was the Covers two-hour docuseries based on the magazine's cover stories.

The title refers to a fictional political scandal enacted on \\"Master Pictures Studios\\", a fictional movie company that is actually a cover for arms trading. The title of the play also references other real-life political scandals, such as Watergate and others subsequently given the suffix -gate. Plot summary The play is set in the Sherman Adams Room at the John Mitchell Building in Washington, D.C.. The \\"Select Joint Congressional Committee Investigating Alleged Covert Arms Assistance to Alleged Other Americas\\" investigates the CIA's attempt to divert arms to Central American guerrillas through a motion picture company's high-budget action film, entitled \\"Tet.\\" (a reference to the Tet Offensive) Mastergate is a satire on congressional investigative committee hearings that took place during the McCarthy Era, on the Watergate investigation, and on the Iran-Contra affair. In his opening address, the chairman explains that the purpose of the hearings is to find out what the president knew and if he had any idea of the affair. The satire employs many aspects of rhetoric and word-play, including puns, malapropism, mixed metaphors, tautology and Washington double-speak. The playwright said of his work that it is \\"First and foremost...a play about language. It's not for me to discover that politicians are corrupt or full of hot air. It's really about what they and television have done to the way we speak and the way we listen.\\" The play uncovers aspects of the absurd in the working life of government employees; for example, it portrays a non-meeting, a non-discussion, and people being present in the minutes of the meeting despite not attending. It has been argued that several of the characters have real-life counterparts, for example, Major Manley Battle may be based on Oliver North.

The production used the Emerald Room of the Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles as a backdrop to the hearings. The play was recorded by L.A. Theatre Works during their 1991-1992 season with a cast including Walter Matthau and Harold Gould.  Reviews of Mastergate  Positive reviews included that of Jack Kroll in Newsweek, who wrote, \\"If George Orwell were a gag writer, he could have written Mastergate. Larry Gelbart's scathingly funny takeoff on the Iran- Contra hearings is a spiky cactus flower in the desert of American political theatre.\\" Similarly, Frank Rich of The New York Times wrote, \\"When Mastergate is funny, it is very funny. When it is not, it still stands up for a patriotic integrity beyond the understanding of the clowns who parade across its national stage.\\" By contrast, Howard Kissel of the Daily News, wrote \\"If you think the title is funny, you'll probably enjoy Mastergate. If you find it adolescent, which I'm afraid I do, stay home and read Mark Twain on politics.\\" Likewise, Linda Winer of Newsday wrote, \\"Mastergate is a one-joke extended sketch that, unfortunately, never manages the leap to dramatic - much less philosophical - revelation of much we didn't already know.

Struck in two varieties, the coins were designed by United States Bureau of the Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber. The pieces were issued to commemorate the Louisiana Purchase Exposition held in 1904 in St. Louis; one variety depicted former president Thomas Jefferson, and the other, the recently assassinated president William McKinley. Although not the first American commemorative coins, they were the first in gold. Promoters of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, originally scheduled to open in 1903, sought a commemorative coin for fundraising purposes. Congress authorized an issue in 1902, and exposition authorities, including numismatic promoter Farran Zerbe, sought to have the coin issued with two designs, to aid sales. The price for each variety was $3, the same cost whether sold as a coin, or mounted in jewelry or on a spoon. The coins did not sell well, and most were later melted down. Zerbe, who had promised to support the issue price of the coins, did not do so as prices dropped once the fair (rescheduled for 1904) closed. This drop, however, did not greatly affect Zerbe's career, as he went on to promote other commemorative coins and become president of the American Numismatic Association. The coins also recovered, regaining their issue price by 1915; they are now worth between a few hundred and several thousand dollars, depending on condition.  Background  Much of the area near the Mississippi River was explored by French explorers in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1682, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, claimed the entire area drained by the river for France, naming it Louisiana for Louis XIV. Although most French territory in the Western Hemisphere was lost in the French and Indian War (1756–1763), the Mississippi basin did not pass to the victors in that war (primarily the British) as it had been secretly transferred to Spain by the 1762 Treaty of Fontainebleau. Napoleon came to power in 1799. Dreaming of a renewed French empire, he secured the return of the Louisiana territory from Spain via the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso the following year, and through other agreements. These pacts were initially secret, and newly inaugurated American President Thomas Jefferson learned of them in 1801. Fearing that the port of New Orleans would be closed to American shipping, he sent former Virginia senator James Monroe to France to assist American Minister Robert Livingston in purchasing the lower Mississippi; Congress appropriated $2 million for the purpose. Ten-cent stamp issued for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition showing the part of the United States that came from the Louisiana Purchase When the Americans met with Napoleon, they found that the emperor desired to sell the entire territory, much of which was unmapped and unexplored by white men; Napoleon was faced with defeat in revolting Haiti and feared that the British would attempt to capture New Orleans, meaning he would lose Louisiana with no compensation. After some haggling, they agreed on a price of 60 million francs, plus 20 million more to pay claims by American citizens against France—a total of some $15 million, which paid for some of land. The treaty was signed on April 30, 1803, and, although there was some question as to whether there was constitutional power for such a purchase, the American Senate ratified the treaty on October 20, 1803. The United States took formal possession two months later. The Louisiana Purchase doubled the size of the United States, and today forms much of the center of the country. Desirous of honoring the centennial of the purchase, Congress passed authorizing legislation for an exposition; the bill was signed by President William McKinley on March 3, 1901. McKinley was assassinated in September of that year.  Preparation  The Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar was authorized by Congress on June 28, 1902, when President Theodore Roosevelt signed an appropriations bill that included a $5,000,000 rider to subsidize the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. The bill in question authorized 250,000 gold one-dollar pieces to be paid over to the exposition organizers as part of the appropriation, upon their posting a bond that they would fulfill the requirements of the legislation. The bill did not specify the wording or design to be placed on the coins, leaving that to the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury. pattern versions of the gold dollars. The reverse shows the olive branch larger than on the issued coins. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their encyclopedia of commemorative coins, suggested that the decision to have multiple designs was \\"through some unrecorded agreement\\". The legislation was ambiguous enough to permit such an interpretation, and numismatist Farran Zerbe urged the Mint to strike more than one type of coin, stating that sales would be increased if this was done. Zerbe was not only a collector (he would serve as president of the American Numismatic Association from 1908 to 1910), but he also promoted numismatics with his traveling exhibition, \\"Money of the World\\". He was involved in the distribution of commemorative coins from the Columbian half dollar of 1892 to the Panama- Pacific issue of 1915, and would be the sole distributor of Louisiana Purchase dollars. This McKinley medal by Chief Engraver Barber was used as the basis of the McKinley variety of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar. On August 12, 1902, Treasury Secretary Leslie M. Shaw wrote to former Missouri governor David R. Francis, one of the promoters of the exposition, enquiring what design exposition officials would like to see on the reverse of the coins. Although Francis's response is not extant, Mint authorities originally determined upon an olive branch surrounding a numeral \\"1\\". This was apparently disliked by the Director of the Mint, George E. Roberts, for on October 2, 1902, Philadelphia Mint Superintendent John Landis wrote to him, enclosing cardboard impressions of the original and revised proposed reverses. The new design had the value spelled out and the letter stated that the changes were being made at Roberts's suggestion. On October 13, Barber went to Washington (where the director's office was located) to confer with Roberts about the design. Roberts considered the olive branch \\"too conspicuous\\", given the size of the coin and the lettering, and asked that the branch be reduced in size. This apparently was done. By September 1902, work upon the dies for the obverses, showing the heads of McKinley and Jefferson, being worked upon by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber, was well-advanced. In December 1902, the Philadelphia Mint struck 75,080 gold dollars. These were dated 1903, a violation of normal Mint practice to have the date of striking on the coin. This was not unprecedented; the 1900-dated Lafayette dollar had been struck in December 1899. It is not known which gold dollar was first struck. In January 1903, an additional 175,178 pieces were coined; the excess of 258 over the authorized mintage was set aside for testing by the annual Assay Commission. There is no difference between those pieces struck in 1902 and those minted in 1903. Fifty thousand pieces were sent to the St. Louis sub-treasury on December 22, 1902, to await the organizing committee's compliance with other parts of the law, most likely relating to the required posting of a bond. The first 100 specimens of each design were struck in a proof finish. These were mounted on cardboard with presentation certificates and presented to favored insiders and Mint officials; they were not available to the public. The certificates were signed by Superintendent Landis, and by Rhine R. Freed, Chief Coiner of the Philadelphia Mint. The coin was placed inside a holder with wax paper window, secured into place with heavy string with that mint's seal. These were the first commemorative gold coins struck by the United States.  Design  John Reich's Indian Peace Medal for Thomas Jefferson served as the basis for the Jefferson obverse of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition issue. Barber took the design for the Jefferson obverse from the former president's Indian Peace Medal, created by engraver John Reich, who used a bust by Jean-Antoine Houdon as his model. The chief engraver modeled the McKinley obverse after his own design for the fallen president's medal issued by the Mint. Barber's medal had been modeled from life; McKinley had sat for the chief engraver. The reverse, for both coins, contains the denomination, a commemorative inscription, and an olive branch above the anniversary dates. Coin dealer B. Max Mehl deemed the issue \\"the most attractive of all of our commemorative gold dollars\\". Others disagreed; Swiatek and Breen criticized the pieces, stating that Jefferson's \\"facial features, inaccurately rendered by Charles E. Barber, have acquired a resemblance to Napoleon Bonaparte, the other party in the Louisiana Purchase transaction.\\" Stating that McKinley was recognizable by his bow tie, they note of the reverse, \\"the olive branch—if that is the plant intended—may refer to this 828,000 square mile territory's acquisition by peaceful means\\". Numismatic historian Don Taxay criticized Reich's medal, stating that it \\"is hardly elegant, with Jefferson hunched unpleasantly in the circle as though placed there by a modern Procrustes\\". Taxay noted that Barber's rendition of McKinley for that medal had attracted the insult of \\"deadly\\" from the chief engraver's longtime enemy, sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Art historian Cornelius Vermeule considered the Panama-Pacific gold dollar more beautiful than the Louisiana Purchase Exposition issue. Art historian Cornelius Vermeule criticized the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar and the Lewis and Clark Exposition dollar issued in 1904–1905: \\"the lack of spark in these coins, as in so many designs by Barber or [Assistant Engraver George T.] Morgan, stems from the fact that the faces, hair, and drapery are flat and the lettering is small, crowded, and even.\\" He did not believe that the problems he saw were due to the small size of the dollar, stating that the gold dollar of the Panama-Pacific issue, by Charles Keck, is far more beautiful. Vermeule noted that contemporary accounts saw the 1903 issue as an innovation; a 1904 article in the American Journal of Numismatics stated that they \\"indicate a popular desire for a new departure from the somewhat monotonous types of Liberty which have characterized our money ... If this tendency could make itself felt on the regular coinage, it would give a new zeal to collectors.\\" Beginning in 1909 with the Lincoln cent, the Mint would depict an actual person on the circulating coinage; this would become more common with the 1932 Washington quarter.  Distribution, aftermath, and collecting  Numismatist Farran Zerbe The fair at St. Louis opened on April 30, 1904, a year later than originally planned. It was one of the largest World's Fairs in area, set over in Forest Park. There were 15 major buildings and a host of smaller exhibits, and it is doubtful if many attendees saw more than a fraction of the attractions—seeing everything in the Agricultural Building alone required a walk of . Twenty million people attended the exposition, which inspired the popular song, \\"Meet Me in St. Louis\\". The coins were sold at $3 each. They were available in a case of issue, or could be purchased mounted in spoons and various sorts of jewelry. Some were mounted with solder, which has impaired their present-day numismatic value; others were sold with mountings that did not damage the coin. Zerbe had thought of these varied ways of selling the coin, and many of the sales at the fair were in this manner. No additional charge was made for these adornments. Zerbe also promoted the pieces to the numismatic community. Although the $3 price was not high by later standards, triple face value was considered excessive by many coin collectors, and the coins did not sell well. Efforts by Zerbe to promote the pieces included proposing that the government produce a billion-dollar gold piece to be exhibited at the fair, and co-ordinating sales with the vendors of near- worthless replicas of tiny gold pieces struck privately in California in pioneer days, which were half price with the purchase of a dollar coin. Thomas L. Elder, a dealer coming into prominence at that time, spoke out against Zerbe, calling him a huckster whose advertising was misleading and who was bringing discredit upon coin dealers. The organizers, including Zerbe, promised to support the $3 issue price against the possibility of price drops on the secondary market. Prices of the Columbian half dollar and Lafayette dollar had fallen and remained below their issue prices. By November 1903, only about 10,000 of the gold pieces had been sold, including sales to the fair's promoters and others interested in it. According to numismatist Q. David Bowers, fairgoers likely accounted for several thousand coins, but the bulk of the distribution was to coin dealers and collectors. Zerbe sold them at his coin exhibit for years afterwards; coin dealer B. Max Mehl bought thousands from Zerbe at just over face value. These were sold in Mehl's mail order sales through the 1920s. Despite efforts by Zerbe which Bowers finds \\"enthusiastic or even heroic\\", only about 35,000 were sold to the public; the remaining 215,000 were returned to the Mint and melted around 1914. Numismatist David M. Bullowa in 1938 noted that the Mint kept no records of how many of each variety was melted, but that he thought that about 10% more of the McKinley issue was sold. Bowers, writing about a half century later, opined to the contrary; that in his experience and in grading service reports, the Jefferson coin was slightly more prevalent. Swiatek, in his 2012 book, prints statistics showing the number of pieces examined by the numismatic grading services, indicating more Jefferson dollars than McKinley. Despite Zerbe's statement that he would support the issue price of the coins at $3, he did not do so and the price of the dollars fell to about $2 by late 1905. Their market price again reached $3 by about 1915, and thereafter continued to rise. The 2014 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins (the Red Book) lists both the Jefferson and the McKinley variety at prices ranging from $500 in Almost Uncirculated (AU-50) condition to $2,150 in near pristine MS-66 condition, though the Jefferson is more expensive in some intermediate grades. Zerbe stated in 1905 that he \\"was the only man to sell 50,000 dollars at $3 apiece\\". In 1923, he wrote in an article that the Louisiana Purchase dollars had always sold for $3 or more \\"for the particular reason that the one in charge of their sale felt a price protection obligation to every purchaser.\\" He did not, however, identify himself as \\"the one in charge of their sale\\".

Dalelv appealed the conviction and had a hearing scheduled for September 2013, but she was pardoned on 22 July, a few days after Norwegian media reported the news and after it had drawn extensive international media attention, which caused an uproar on both social media and traditional Western media outlets. Human rights activists and politicians expressed strong criticism of the Dubai justice system's handling of the incident. In Norway the criticism, as first expressed by professor in religious studies, Dag Øistein Endsjø, was mainly against the initial lack of official Norwegian reaction against what was considered a human rights violation against a Norwegian citizen. The incident occurred in March 2013 and was first reported by Norwegian media on 17 July 2013.\\"Norsk kvinne anmeldte voldtekt i Dubai: – Dømt forsex utenfor ekteskap\\", vg.no, 17 July 2013. Dalelv had worked as an interior designer in Qatar since 2011 until this incident.\\"Vergewaltigte Norwegerin von ihrer Firma 'The One' im Stich gelassen\\", focus.de; accessed 15 November 2014. Allegations of rape and investigation =Dalelv's account= Dalelv was in Dubai for a business meeting and joined colleagues from her company in Qatar for a night out on 6 March at a hotel nightclub on Sheikh Zayed Road. She reported that it was a long evening where everyone drank a lot. She asked a colleague, a Sudanese man named Hawari (alternatively reported as HM in some reports) to help her back into her room, because she was drunk. But he brought her into his room and said to her that he would sleep on the sofa and she could sleep in the bed.Knast für Sex vor der EheJetzt spricht das Vergewaltigungsopfer von Dubai, blick.ch; accessed 15 November 2014. In her account, she then removed her clothes except for her underwear and slept in the bed with HM on a sofa. Later she described presumably more details to the press. In Sky News was to read: \\"She said that she wanted to calm this situation down and that she sat down and wanted to drink her bottle of water and after it she wanted to go, to find her room by herself, but this was the last thing she remembered\\".Sky News: Disbelief At Jail Term After 'Rape' To the day after this situation she reported, that she had woken up in the morning and realised she was being raped. She claimed she had tried to resist the man, but he pushed her head down; room-service then knocked on the doorNorwegerin schildert Details ihrer \\"Unzucht\\", welt.de; accessed 15 November 2014. and she escaped. She stated that she had gone down to the lobby and asked the people in the lobby to call the police for her.Im Gefängnis in Dubai„Wir tranken viel“ – Norwegerin spricht über Vergewaltigung, focus.de; accessed 15 November 2014. =Police investigation= Dalelv made the initial complaint of rape early on 7 March. According to the police transcripts, she told the questioning police officer: \\"I had three glasses of vodka, one mojito and a beer while we were at the club, and I asked [the person] to protect me from molestation attempts\\". In the same account, she reported taking a cab with colleagues, including the alleged attacker, to the hotel where they were staying and that she had forgotten where her room was located. Images from the hotel's closed-circuit TV camera, which were produced in court, show Dalelv entering her colleague's room with her arm placed around his waist in one snapshot, and resting her head on his shoulder in another. Prosecution records cited Dalelv admitting she initiated the sexual activity with H.A. and he responded. Dalelv said a medical examination seeking evidence of the alleged rape and a blood test for alcohol were taken as a standard procedure. The Dubai police forensic report confirmed the woman had had sex but there was no mention of any physical violence. She claims she was then held in custody for three days and that both her money and her passport were confiscated. After four days, she was loaned a phone card and contacted her stepfather in Norway. =Retraction= Six days later, on 12 March, Dalelv returned to the police and retracted her allegation, saying that she had made the initial complaint \\"because I was under the influence of alcohol\\". She told the public prosecutor's office, in one of the many hearings, that she had had consensual sex. According to the prosecution records, Dalelv said \\"I confirm that he did not rape me, but had sex with me with my consent\\". In an interview with the media, she says she began to suspect that the police did not believe her story after her first interview and says she was initially advised by her manager to claim the sex was consensual in order to avoid a drawn-out court case. According to The National, an employee of her company had told her it would be a difficult case to prove, and withdrawing it would help her leave the UAE. Dalelv's employers in Qatar, Al Mana Interiors, claim the advice to retract the allegations came from the police and that her manager only translated the advice into English. Other sources quote the spokesman denying that she was advised to change her report to police. \\"This was not true\\", the spokesman said. Dalelv reportedly regretted following that advice: \\"I can't blame anyone else here but me, because nobody forced me to say it. I just wish I hadn't taken that advice\\". In an interview with the CNN, she said \\"That was my biggest regret... I just thought it would all go away\\". She added: \\"I took their advice but after I left the public prosecutor's office I was crying. I felt it was almost as bad as what had happened because I had to go against everything I believed and I believed in telling the truth\\". When the case did go to court, she reverted to her initial allegation of having been raped. Sentence In July 2013, the Dubai Misdemeanour Court convicted Dalelv of falsely reporting to the police that she was raped, for which they sentenced her to three months' imprisonment, and of drinking alcohol, for which they sentenced her to one month's imprisonment. The court also convicted her of having consensual extramarital sex, for which they sentenced her to 12 months imprisonment, since extramarital sex (zina) is outlawed in the UAE. Dalelv admitted to drinking alcohol, but she denied having consensual sex and making a false report to the police that she had been raped on 6 March. She appealed the conviction and had a hearing scheduled for 5 September 2013. Her advocate in court asked the court to refer the case to the public prosecution for a re- investigation into her rape claim, arguing: > [A]ccording to the forensic examiner's testimony before the court, she did > not completely eliminate the probability of rape claiming that Dalelv could > have been raped while she slept. Although the forensic report did not > confirm any rape, the examiner's probability matched my client's claim that > H.A. raped her while she slept. Dalelv's Sudanese boss pleaded guilty and confessed to having consensual sex. He was jailed for 13 months for alcohol consumption and having consensual sex. Termination of work contract Dalelv was fired from her job at THE One Total Home Experience in April on the ground of \\"unacceptable and improper behaviour during your last business trip in Dubai, which has resulted in your arrest by the Police Authorities in UAE\\" and \\"that was in direct violation of the company policy\\". Her colleague was also fired. The local franchise in Doha is owned by Janet Jackson's husband, Wissam al-Mana. Officials from Norwegian colleges, including Westerdals College and the Idefag School in Tønsberg, expressed outrage at the actions of The One and indicated that they would cease cooperation with the firm in their recruitment drives. On 21 July 2013, the company claimed they were working to secure her release, would provide legal support and that she was terminated because she \\"ceased communication\\" with them, not because of the rape allegations. The statement said: > We are sympathetic to Marte Dalelv during this very difficult situation. Al > Mana Interiors has repeatedly offered Marte support and company > representatives were by her side throughout the initial investigation and > police interviews, and spent days at both the police station and the > prosecutor's office to help win her release.\\"Statement on Marte Dalelv by Al > Mana Interiors, W.L.L. Spokesperson Hani El Korek\\", Yahoo! Finance; > retrieved 20 July 2013. On 22 July 2013, Thomas Lundgren, head of THE One, said in an interview that it had been a mistake to fire Dalelv during the trial and that the company would offer both Dalelv and the man she accused their jobs back.Courtney Trenwith (22 July 2013): \\"Dubai boss says sacking rape case woman was wrong\\", ArabianBusiness.com; retrieved 4 August 2013. Reactions After her arrest, Dalelv initially received only \\"consular assistance\\" from the Norwegian embassy, as is usual when Norwegian citizens are charged with criminal acts abroad. The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also \\"advised people to look into the legal situation of the country they travel to because what they consider innocent may be illegal in a conservative country.\\"The Norwegian Department of Foreign Affairs to NRK, nrk.no, 18 July 2013. Her family and the Norwegian consulate negotiated her release and she took refuge at the Norwegian Seamans' Centre in Dubai. On 18 July 2013, professor and human rights activist Dag Øistein Endsjø strongly criticized the official Norwegian reactions, slamming the Department of Foreign Affairs for their failure to understand that the incident is a human rights issue involving the right to privacy. He further criticised their silence towards the Emirate government despite the violation of the basic human rights of a Norwegian citizen, instead treating Dalelv as if she were just another Norwegian abroad being charged with a common crime.Endsjø, Dag Øistein. \\"Norsk velsignelse av menneskerettighetsbrudd\\" on nrk.no 18 July 2013, 10:34, and on Radio Norge Nyheter 18 July 2013, 14:00, Dagsnytt on NRK Radio P1-P3 18 July 2013, 15:00 and later, NRK Alltid Nyheter, 18 July 2013, 15:05, Dagsnytt Atten on NRK Radio P2 18 July 2013, 18:00 and Dagsrevyen on NRK TV1, 18 July 2013, 19:00 and 21:00.

The serious reaction against the Norwegian government led to an official turnaround, after which Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs Espen Barth Eide criticised the conviction, first saying \\"this is clearly in conflict with our sense of justice\\" and admitting that it was \\"problematic from a human rights perspective.\\"\\"UD tar sterk avstand fra Dubai- dommen\\", NRK.no, 18 July 2013 . The lack of initial official reactions from the Norwegian government was later criticized by the Norwegian chapter of Amnesty International.\\"Amnesty: – Umenneskelig behandling av Marte (24)\\", TV2.no, 19 July 2013. On 19 July 2013, Barth Eide finally took the same clear human rights principal position as originally argued by Endsjø: \\"One shall respect different cultures but not violate human rights. The right to sexual freedom and the control over one's own body are among these\\".\\"Barth Eide: 'Tydeligere reaksjoner kunne forverret Martes situasjon'\\", Aftenposten, 19 July 2013. Ministry of Foreign Affairs consultant Kathrine Raadim indicated that Norway would not recall its ambassador to the UAE. The incident also caused an uproar on social media, as people were leaving comments on the Facebook pages of both the employer, THE One Total Home Experience and the Dubai Tourist Office. THE One Total Home Experience closed their Facebook page to comments from Norway, Sweden, and Denmark on 19 July 2013. The affair also received international attention outside Norway. German news magazine Spiegel and the tabloid newspaper Bild also reported on the incident.„Boykottiert Dubai!“ – Die Welt ist empört, bild.de; accessed 15 November 2014.

Michelsen Institute, declared on 21 July 2013 that the matter will be resolved quickly, because for Dubai and the United Arab Emirates such negative worldwide media attention is something which is completely unusual, and that they spend enormous resources on getting businesses and tourists to Dubai, so that it would be very likely that diplomacy will work in this case.Tror på positiv løsning for Marte i Dubai, dagbladet.no, 21 July 2013 Norwegerin schildert Details ihrer \\"Unzucht\\", welt.de; accessed 15 November 2014.

Biography Wade was born at the Prospect Hill Plantation in Jefferson County near Fayette, Mississippi, to Isaac Ross Wade (1814-1891) and the former Catherine Elizabeth Dunbar (1820-1865). Of Scottish descent, Wade was affiliated with the Clan Gregor Society. From 1888 to 1904, he served as a Democrat in the Louisiana House of Representatives. During part of his legislative tenure, Wade served alongside Robert H. Snyder of St. Joseph, who was a House Speaker. Two years after Wade left the House, Samuel W. Martien, a large cotton planter from Waterproof in southern Tensas Parish, began a 14-year tenure in the House.Obituary of Samuel W. Martien, Tensas Gazette, June 7, 1946, p. 6 Wade was a delegate to the 1898 Louisiana Constitutional Convention. He served on the Louisiana State Board of Education from 1896 to 1900 during the second administration of Governor Murphy J. Foster, Sr. Such dual office-holding is no longer permitted in Louisiana. Wade also served on the Tensas Parish School Board and, he was thereafter appointed and served for at least twenty years as the Tensas school superintendent, long one of the most important positions in the small parish nestled along oxbow lakes next to the Mississippi River. In 1883, Wade married his third cousin, Anna Thomas Magruder (1862-1918). Both he and his wife had lost their mothers in early childhood. Anna's husband was named for her father, Dr. Thomas Baldwin Magruder (1800-1885), of Port Gibson in Claiborne County in southwestern Mississippi. Anna Magruder Wade was seriously injured in a horse- and-buggy accident in 1912. After weeks of therapy, she recovered from her wounds though she had been at the point of death on several occasions. She was treated in Chattanooga, Tennessee, by her husband's nephew, Dr. Edward D. Newell, Jr., son of Edward D. Newell, for whom Newellton is named. Anna Wade also spent time in a sanitarium in New Orleans. Nevertheless, she died in Newellton in 1918 at the age of fifty-six of a different problem, toxiema. A biographical sketch of his parents by Thomas Wade, II, reveals their Christian commitment through the Episcopal Church. Thomas Wade was a widower for the remaining decade of his life. Thomas and Anna Wade and other family members are interred at Winter Green Cemetery in Port Gibson, Mississippi. Family legacy The Wades had one child, Thomas Wade, II (1889-1971), a lawyer in the Tensas parish seat of St. Joseph, who later lived in Missoula, Montana, and El Dorado, Arkansas, where he died at the age of eighty-two. From his first marriage in 1913 to the former Kate Burton LaCour of Shreveport in far northwestern Louisiana, he had two children, namesake sons, Thomas Wade, III (1914-2012), and Burton LaCour Wade, I (1923-1998). From a second marriage to his then surviving widow, the former Mary Gwendolyn Webb, he had a daughter, Miss Anna Wade of El Dorado. Grandson Thomas Wade, III, was first an attorney and from 1940 to 1942 the mayor of St. Joseph before he enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II. Thereafter, he graduated from the theological seminary of the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, and became an ordained Episcopal priest with service between 1957 and 1979 in DeRidder, Minden, Baton Rouge, and Pineville, Louisiana. After he retired from the ministry, he spent his last years in St. Joseph. He and his wife of sixty-six years, Alma Fluitt Wade, originally from Haynesville, Louisiana, had two children.

General description The traditional Palatine cuisine is in parts very hearty and substantial mainly because the recipes were developed by the physically hard- working population or in times of poverty. In comparison to other regional German cuisines its dishes are also hotter and spicier. A typical spice used for sausage and potatoes is marjoram. Meat Flääschknepp (meat balls) with horse radish sauce The most renowned dish from the Palatinate is Saumagen (meaning pig stomach) which is a mixture of lean pork, sausage meat, potatoes, onions, marjoram, cloves and pepper in a casing, traditionally a pig stomach, in which the mixture is simmered. As with most traditional dishes there are variations with additional ingredients and spices. The finished product is cooled, cut into finger-thick slices and sold at all butchers in the Palatinate region. The slices are fried and usually served with sauerkraut and bread or mashed potatoes, sometimes with brown sauce. Coarse Bratwürste, liverwurst and blood sausage, liver Knödel and meat balls, the latter most commonly served with a horseradish sauce, are integral parts of the Palatinate cuisine. Like in neighbouring Alsace, sauerkraut is a typical side dish in all seasons but especially in winter. Other very common additions to the main dish are mashed potato and brown sauce although many restaurants serve typical rye bread instead of the mashed potato. Another very famous dish which is of eminent cultural importance is Pfälzer Dreifaltigkeit (\\"Palatinate Trinity\\"): it is a combination of the above described Saumagen, the typical Bratwurst and liver Knödel. Fish In the Middle Ages numerous little streams running from the Palatinate Forest to the Rhine were impounded by monasteries or peasants in order to create little fish ponds. Although many of these have gone, there are still many traditional restaurants in the middle of the forest whose menus feature a variety of fish. Nowadays many \\"modern\\" varieties of fish are served alongside traditional species like trout, roach, zander, pike and carp. A second very notable tradition of fish dishes beside the one that was nurtured by fish ponds existed along the river Rhine which was very rich in fish especially before industrialization. Many men were fishermen and in the city of Speyer there was even a guild for this occupation which caught a variety of fish species, but especially salmon and eel were very important. Unfortunately in the course of the industrialization the Rhine became polluted and many species could not live there or the fish was no longer edible. But even after the loss of their own fishing grounds, the population retained its fondness for fish and nowadays there are still many restaurants along the Rhine and the Rhine valley that specialize in fish dishes and many villages still celebrate the traditional fishermen's feasts on which a diverse selection of fish are offered. Miscellaneous Dampfnudle Grumbeersupp und Quetschekuche Plum cake A very famous dish from the Palatinate is Dampfnudeln (\\"steamed noodles\\") with a salty crust. It is traditionally a main dish and enjoyed either with sweet side dishes such as wine sauce, vanilla sauce or fruit preserves such as mirabelle, plums or pear or with hearty side dishes like potato soup, vegetable soup or goulash. In some parts of the Palatinate it is even common to eat them as an appetizer with a hearty soup and then with sweet side dishes as the main dish. During plum season a common main dish is \\"Grumbeersupp und Quetschekuche\\" which is potato soup and plum cake and for dessert Kerscheplotzer is served. Another seasonal dish is Zwiebelkuchen which is commonly served with Federweisser in autumn. Also very frequently eaten are Gebreedelde which is the Palatinate version of baked potatoes with diced bacon or liverwurst. But also boiled potatoes with quark, onions, caraway, pepper or chive are very popular. A traditional snack which exists mainly because of the working men in vineyards is Weck, Worscht un Woi (bun, meat and wine). Weck, Worscht un Woi  Regional differences  = Anterior and South Palatinate = The most important product of the agriculture there and also one of the most popular export articles is the wine. It is grown mainly along the Weinstraße where because of its situation at the western edge of the Rhine valley and next to the range of mountains Haardt a very mild climate guarantees optimal conditions. Traditionally white wines are particularly Riesling, Müller-Thurgau, Silvaner and Kerner. Famous red wines are Blauer Portugieser and Dornfelder. The wines are not only important for drinking with meals but are also frequently used as an ingredient in sauces or desserts. As many chestnut trees are growing in the Haardt the cuisine of this region features many chestnut dishes especially during autumn and Christmastime. They are preferably served with game, duck or rabbit which is also the traditional way of eating them but in recent years the cooks of sophisticated restaurants adapted many chestnut dishes from Italy and France. Important cultivars are vegetables and potatoes in the Vorderpfalz and asparagus in the Rhine valley. Due to the Mediterranean climate there are also almonds, kiwis, citron fruit and figs growing there and therefore the cuisine resembles the cuisines of the Mediterranean states like Italy, Spain and especially France. The Palatine people's love of good food resembles that of the French and is especially visible in the public festivals and funfairs whose themes are frequently about food or drink. Beside the many wine feasts there are also other culinary specialties highlighted and celebrated such as asparagus in Dudenhofen, pretzel in Speyer, radish in Schifferstadt, Handkäse in Lustadt, cherry in Grünstadt-Sausenheim, potato in Bellheim or the dish Saumagen in Kallstadt. = West Palatinate = This region's cuisine is even heartier and traditional dishes include: *Hooriche (meaning \\"hairy\\"), little potato balls served with a cream-bacon-sauce *Schales, large potato pancakes whose dough also contains bacon, onion, a lot of nutmeg and baked in a bread pan *Lakzervelat, a kind of sausage made from cured meat, especially common between Christmas and New Year's Eve *Anduddel, also a very spicy sausage for stewing. =Border to France= In the region bordering France, the neighbouring influence is notable. Dishes such as Flammkuchen are very popular and even escargots are common. Literature *Anna Bergner: Pfälzer Kochbuch.

The lens is detached from the camera and held in front of the lens mount by hand during exposure. So the camera and lens don't have to be the same Brand, you can mix match brands, use vintage lenses. Any lens will work but if you want more depth of field use a lens that has a manual aperture ring. This allows the lens to be tilted or shifted creating a similar effect to a perspective control or \\"Tilt-Shift\\" lens, only with a lower degree of fidelity. The result is a combination of selective focus and light leakage which are used creatively to create surreal imagery. Because of the increase in flange focal distance, this technique is most successful with closeup or macro photography, where infinity focus is not essential. The lens used does not necessarily have to be native to the brand of camera, since it is not physically attached to it. In addition, the lens may also be reversed for macro photography. By shooting through a normal to wide-angle lens backwards, increased magnification can be achieved. One of the by-products of freelensing is the introduction of \\"light leaks\\" which can be controlled to some degree and produce toy-camera like effects similar to those achieved with a Holga or Diana camera. The process is facilitated by use of an SLR, DSLR or MILC, in which the focus, and to a lesser degree the composition of the image, can be previewed prior to capture. In the case of a rangefinder or similar non-reflex or non live-view camera, the resulting focus would be unpredictable enough to be impractical, and yet not impossible to achieve. Freelensing is best accomplished in a relatively dry, dust-free environment due to exposure of the mirror box, and the dust-attracting sensor, to the elements. Once the photos have been captured, the lens should be remounted or a body cap installed to protect the mirror and sensor from dust or moisture. Frequent use of a bulb blower or electronic cleaning are recommended. Sensor cleaning requires special care so as to not damage components.

While the exact origins of the pearl are unknown it first appears among the royal Crown Jewels of Bavaria, who were the ruling family of the Palatinate, which gaves its name to the pearl (and possibly its origin).

The island is southernmost of the Yokatsu Islands, and is located south south-east of the Katsuren Peninsula off Okinawa Island at the entrance of Nakagusuku Bay. Tsuken covers and has a population of 487 residents. The only settlement on Tsuken is located in the southwest of the island. The settlement includes the Port of Tsuken, a post office, and a medical clinic attached to the Okinawa Prefectural Chubu Hospital in Uruma. The island is home to Tsuken Elementary School (19 students) and Tsuken Junior High School (11 students). The island has no high school; students must leave the island after junior high school to continue their education. While residents of Tsuken speak standard Japanese, usage of the Okinawan language remains strong on the island, specifically the South-Central dialect of the language. Geography Map of the Okinawa Islands, showing the location of Tsuken Island to the south of Okinawa Island Tsuken runs from north to south and to east to west. Its highest point is in the southwest of the island at . Tsuken was once covered with a dense forest of fountain palms, but the middle portion of Tsuken was entirely burned during World War II, and palm groves remain only at the north of the island. Thick belts of vegetation that now exist around coastal areas of the island protect the settlement and agricultural land from sea breeze. The central and northern parts of Tsuken are used for the production of carrots, a noted agricultural product of the island. History Nakabaru Site, Ikei Island Tsuken is historically linked to Kudaka Island to the south. Safe passage between the islands was possible at low tide via small boats, and there was considerable cultural exchange between the islands. Tsuken was settled early in the history of the Ryukyu Islands, as evidenced by its numerous shell mounds, of which three have been excavated. Tsuken was home to the ruins of a small castle, the Kubō Gusuku. Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry recorded the island as \\"Taking Island\\" in his narrative on travel to the Ryukyu Islands. The areas of present-day Uruma were affected in World War II during the initial part of the Battle of Okinawa. L-Day, the initial land invasion of Okinawa Island, occurred on April 1, 1945. American forces swept across the island quickly, and by April 5 had secured the entirety of the Katsuren Peninsula. A smaller invasion force invaded the Yokatsu Islands on L-Day, and encountered stiff resistance from the Japanese military. Tsuken Island was completely devastated by fire in the battle. Casualties for Japanese troops were 234 killed; for the US battalion of the 27th infantry division:11 killed and 3 MIA; 80 wounded. After the capture of Tsuken, American forces swept north and reached Ikei Island on April 11, thus securing all the Yokatsu Islands. Tsuken is in a period of population decline. In 1970 the island had 1,172 residents and 245 households; by 2005 the population was at 485 residents and 210 households. Economy Tsuken is noted for its production of carrots, and is known by the nickname \\"Carrot Island\\". With white sandy beaches and a broad coral reef, tourism is an important part of the economy. The island has three small hotels and a campground, and also sees numerous day visitors from Okinawa Island. In contrast to its population decline, tourism is growing on Tsuken: in 1975, shortly after the reversion of Okinawa Prefecture to Japan, only 3,000 tourists visited the island. In 2007 the number had grown to 48,887. Transportation Tsuken is accessible only by ferry. The Kamiya Tourism Company operates a ferry service fives times a day between the pier at Heshikiya on the Katsuren Peninsula in Uruma City. Tsuken is reached by high-speed ferry in 12 minutes, and regular ferry in 30 minutes. The island has no bus, taxi, or rental car service; all locations on the island are reached by foot.

De Miranda was the first Prime Minister of Suriname  Biography  De Miranda was a descendant of an old established family of planters. He went to the gymnasium in The Hague, Netherlands and then studied law at the University of Amsterdam. On 20 December 1928 he passed his state examination in law. After returning to Suriname he worked as a lawyer in Paramaribo from 1929 to 1946. In 1946, he traveled to the Netherlands once again. He received a doctorate in legal science from the University of Amsterdam on 18 December 1946. His thesis was a plea for democratisation and self governance for Suriname. He was appointed to the Court of Paramaribo in the same year and was in the year of his death, even for a short time its president. De Miranda was from 1932 to 1938 a member of the Colonial States. As an elected representative, he delivered open criticism of the official leadership of Governor Kielstra (1933-1944) and became vigorously for a change of authority. De Miranda was of the opinion that the governor should no longer be the subject of the Dutch Minister for the Overseas territory parts, but responsible with his administration over the Surinamese community. Between 1942 to 1946 he returned as a member of the Colonial States. He was also Minister of Justice and Police, Education and Finance. In addition, he was Prime Minister from 1949 to 1951. On 17 June 1949, De Miranda passed the law that the word colony was no longer allowed to be used in combination with Suriname in legal documents. The government fell over the Hospital Question in which Lou Lichtveld as Minister of Health had fired doctor Henk van Ommeren over alleged irregularities which were later proven false. In 1955 he moved to the Netherlands, because of health reasons, but recovered and decided to return to Suriname. In 12 April 1956 he became President of the High Court of Justice which he remained until he died eight months later at the age of 50, on 28 November 1956 about 2 o'clock in the morning, to a coronary thrombosis. Julius Caesar de Miranda was not only an exceptional Surinamese, but also an authoritative jurist who has contributed much to the legal science in Suriname, and a mentor and teacher to Jagernath Lachmon. In 28 November 1961 a statue created by Leo Braat was unveiled by his widow. The statue shows him in robe and stands at the Mr. de Mirandastraat in the center of Paramaribo.

Wayback serves typical hamburger restaurant foods such as hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken sandwiches, milkshakes and salads along with a variety of regional selections. Originally created in Newark, Delaware, Wayback began expansion in the late 2000s; in 2013, it was announced that the chain was expanding internationally to an additional 28 countries, with locations in the Middle East and North Africa slated to open in early 2014. The second international agreement signed is with Argentina. As of October, 2016, 133 locations were in operation worldwide.  History  The first Wayback Burgers location was opened in 1991 in Delaware under the name Jake's Hamburgers. Several more locations were opened, leading to the beginning of franchising in the early 2000s where the name was changed to Jake's Wayback Burgers in 2010. To date, the chain has expanded to 95 locations, with an additional 75 currently in development. They are spread throughout the United States, ranging from New England, New York, Florida, Texas, Ohio, and California. Wayback is similar to other 'better burger' brands such as Five Guys, Shake Shack, and Fuddruckers. The first location in the state of Ohio was opened in Wadsworth in June 2011. The first location in the state of Indiana was opened in Evansville in March 2012. The 50th location was opened in Brooklyn, New York City in July 2012. The first location in the state of New Hampshire was opened in Salem in August 2012. The first location in the state of South Carolina was opened in Spartanburg in January 2013. In August 2013, the first location in the state of Texas was opened in Waxahachie and the first location in the state of Minnesota was opened in Woodbury. The first location in the state of Colorado was opened in Colorado Springs in November 2013. During the summer of 2014 the chain announced the drop of \\"Jake's\\" from the title in order to deter confusion with a smaller competitor based in the southern United States. Many locations will keep existing signage with the name \\"Jake's\\" on store fronts, but all new franchises will be known as \\"Wayback Burgers\\". The first location in the state of Georgia was opened in Savannah in January 2015. As part of a publicity stunt, Wayback offered milkshakes made with protein powder derived from crickets in June 2015 as part of a limited time offer. As a bug-free alternative during the same promotional period, Wayback also offered a beef flavored shake that was garnished with a Slim Jim. The first location in the state of Illinois was opened in Naperville in May 2016. In 2016, Wayback Burgers investigated the possibility of an initial public offering, IPO, but did not proceed further at that time. =International expansion= The first location outside the United States was opened in Palermo, Buenos Aires in Argentina in February 2015. Nine months later, the first location in Saudi Arabia was opened in Al Khobar in November 2015 on the other side of the planet. This was the second location to open outside the United States. The first location in the Southeast Asian country of Brunei was opened in the Setia Kenangan area in Kiulap in May 2016, making this the third location outside the United States.

Life and works Little is known about van der Heide's personal life. He was trained in the workshop of Bernt Notke (and worked with him on his famous Saint George and the Dragon statue in Stockholm) and seems to have lived and worked in Lübeck, present-day Germany. In 1485 he married, and in 1487 he purchased a house in Königstraße street of Lübeck. In 1513 he was made alderman at the guild of painters. He seems to have retired in 1519, when his workshop passed to his oldest son. For a craftsman of his age he appears to have been unusually wealthy as he managed to purchase three houses, one for each of his sons. His works are often confusingly similar to those of Notke, and scholars debate about what works should be assigned to which artist. As a rule, however, van der Heide seem to have added more individuality to his portraits and less emotionally overstated. Works attributable to van der Heide include altarpieces in Brændekilde church, Denmark and in Saaremaa Museum, Estonia (previously in Kaarma church); the Saint George and the Dragon group currently in the St. Anne's Museum, Lübeck; a sculpture of St. Jerome in Vadstena Abbey, Sweden; a sculpted head of St. John the Baptist currently in the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities, and others.

Life and work The son of a Berlin banker, Badt studied art history and philosophy first at the universities of Berlin and Munich and then in Freiburg, where he was a student of Wilhelm Vöge. Among his fellow students was the young Erwin Panofsky. Badt completed his doctoral dissertation on Andrea Solario in 1914. He started his career as an assistant at the Kunsthalle Bremen, but most of his life he was an independent scholar teaching privately, as his family was wealthy and he did not need an academic job in order to earn a living. According to Alfons Rosenberg, he lived the life of a Renaissance humanist.Alfons Rosenberg, \\"In Memory of Dr Kurt Badt\\". AJR Information, volume XXIX, no. 2, February 1974, p. 5. In 1939 he left Germany gaining a research position at the newly founded Warburg Institute in London. He returned to Germany in 1950, where he became a German citizen in 1952 and helped to reorganize the university system. His writings include studies on Wilhelm Lehmbruck, Eugène Delacroix, Nicolas Poussin, Jan Vermeer, John Constable, Paul Cézanne, Raphael, Vincent van Gogh, Paolo Veronese, Ernst Barlach and attacks on the methodology of the \\"second Vienna school\\" of art history dominated by Hans Sedlmayr. He considered \\"masterpieces\\" to be the only works of art worth studying. Badt radically separated works of art from the deeds in history: the first are what artists have in mind, their works interest and currently attract the viewer as such, whereas the historical deeds intend effects and are related to their consequences and therefore tend to be absorbed by them. Furthermore, Badt explained his new fundamental approach to interpretation with the difference between historical action and artistic making: he differentiated the artistic work process from the distinct plans and designs, seeing it in each stage to be identical with the work as a draft. Therefore, he was able to understand and explain the finished work out of its work process. He did not see the artistic process as a mere fabrication technique, but as a method making visible to our general understanding the essence of what is to be represented.RUDOLF KUHN, \\"KURT BADT (1979)\\". His first marriage with Ella C. Wollheim dissolved in 1937, Badt married Helen \\"Leni\\" Arnheim (1906-1973), the sister of Rudolf Arnheim.Die wahre Schönheit der Dinge: Kurt Badt. Galerie Bodenseekreis Meersburg, 2013. Aged 83, Badt committed suicide together with his second wife.Die wahre Schönheit der Dinge: Kurt Badt. Ein Leben für die Kunst. Influence Badt was one of the most influential art historians of his time.Rudolf Kuhn, \\"Kurt Badt\\" His work influenced the German art historians Gertrude Berthold, Lorenz Dittmann, , , and Max ImdahlDictionary of Art Historians: Badt, Kurt (Ludwig). and he is frequently quoted by English and American art historians. For instance, Geoffrey Grigson said, \\"Painting is a difficult subject to write about, and searching books on particular painters are as rare as unicorns... One of them, and how welcome, is Dr Kurt Badt's The Art of Cézanne.Country Life, vol. 137, 1965, p. 1042. According to Robert Hobbs, \\"Badt's study is particularly helpful in articulating certain aspects of [Malcolm] Morley's overall program that has definite affinities with Cézanne's.\\"Robert Hobbs, \\"Malcolm Morley: The Art of Painting\\". In Malcolm Morley. New York: Sperone, Westwater, 2005. Mary Jacobus calls Badt a \\"pioneering writer on Constable's clouds\\".Mary Jacobus, Romantic Things: A Tree, a Rock, a Cloud. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2012, p. 25. The Times Literary Supplement called Constable's Clouds the best book on Constable since Leslie's Life.Alfons Rosenberg, \\"In Memory of Dr Kurt Badt\\". AJR Information, volume XXIX, no. 2, February 1974, p. 5. Rudolf Arnheim often cites Badt in his widely read Art and Visual Perception. He writes: \\"It may seem paradoxical for Kurt Badt to say that Rubens is one of the simplest of all artists. He explains, 'It is true that in order to grasp his simplicity, one must be able to understand an order that dominates an enormous world of active forces.' Badt defines artistic simplicity as 'the wisest ordering of means based on insight into the essentials, to which everything else must be subservient.' \\"Rudolf Arnheim, Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye. 50th Anniversary Printing. Berkeley: The University of California Press, 2004, p. 60. When Arnheim asked Badt what he meant by \\"intelligent\\" art, he answered with the following list: \\"Artistic intelligence: Michelangelo, Poussin, Delacroix. Lack of it: Memling, Riemenschneider, Ingres, Kandinsky.\\"Rudolf Arnheim, Parables of Sun Light: Observations on Psychology, the Arts, and the Rest.

In 1115, Jurchen tribes rebelled against their overlords, the Khitan Liao dynasty (907–1125), and declared the formation of the Jin. Allying with the Song against their common enemy the Liao dynasty, the Jin promised to return to the Song the Sixteen Prefectures that had fallen under Liao control since 938. The Chinese agreed but the Jurchens' quick defeat of the Liao combined with Song military failures made the Jin reluctant to cede territory. After a series of negotiations that embittered both sides, the Jurchens attacked the Song in 1125, dispatching one army to Taiyuan and the other to Bianjing (modern Kaifeng), the Song capital. Surprised by news of an invasion, Song general Tong Guan retreated from Taiyuan, which was besieged and later captured. As the second Jin army approached the capital, Song emperor Huizong abdicated and fled south. Qinzong, his eldest son, was enthroned. The Jurchens laid siege to Kaifeng in 1126, but Qinzong negotiated their retreat from the capital by agreeing to a large annual indemnity. Qinzong reneged on the deal and ordered Song forces to defend the prefectures instead of fortifying the capital. The Jin resumed war and again besieged Kaifeng in 1127. They captured Qinzong, many members of the imperial family and high officials of the Song imperial court in an event known as the Jingkang Incident. This separated north and south China between Jin and Song. Remnants of the Song imperial family retreated to southern China and, after brief stays in several temporary capitals, eventually relocated to Lin'an (modern Hangzhou). The retreat divided the dynasty into two distinct periods, Northern Song and Southern Song. The Jurchens tried to conquer southern China in the 1130s but were bogged down by a pro-Song insurgency in the north and a counteroffensive by Song generals, including Yue Fei and Han Shizhong. The Song generals regained some territories but retreated on the orders of Southern Song emperor Gaozong, who supported a peaceful resolution to the war. The Treaty of Shaoxing (1142) set the boundary of the two empires along the Huai River, but conflicts between the two dynasties continued until the fall of Jin in 1234. A war against the Song begun by the 4th Jin emperor, Wanyan Liang, was unsuccessful. He lost the Battle of Caishi (1161) and was later assassinated by his own disaffected officers. An invasion of Jin territory motivated by Song revanchism (1206–1208) was also unsuccessful. A decade later, Jin launched an abortive military campaign against the Song in 1217 to replace territory they had lost to the invading Mongols. The Song allied with the Mongols in 1233, and in the next year jointly captured Caizhou, the last refuge of the Jin emperor. The Jin dynasty collapsed that year. After the demise of Jin, the Song became a target of the Mongols, and collapsed in 1279. The wars engendered an era of swift technological, cultural, and demographic changes in China. Battles between the Song and Jin brought about the introduction of various gunpowder weapons. The siege of De'an in 1132 was the first recorded use of the fire lance, an early ancestor of firearms. There were also reports of incendiary huopao or the exploding tiehuopao, incendiary arrows, and other related weapons. In northern China, Jurchens were the ruling minority of an empire predominantly inhabited by former subjects of the Song. Jurchen migrants settled in the conquered territories and assimilated with the local culture. Jin, a conquest dynasty, instituted a centralized imperial bureaucracy modeled on previous Chinese dynasties, basing their legitimacy on Confucian philosophy. Song refugees from the north resettled in southern China. The north was the cultural center of China, and its conquest by Jin diminished the regional stature of the Song dynasty. The Southern Song, however, quickly returned to economic prosperity, and trade with Jin was lucrative despite decades of warfare. Lin'an, the Southern Song capital, expanded into a major city for commerce. Fragile Song–Jin alliance The Song and Jin were allies against the Khitan Liao. Painting of Khitan hunters, from the alt=Khitan hunters on horseback with one rider holding an eagle The Jurchens were a Tungusic-speaking group of semi-agrarian tribes inhabiting areas of northeast Asia that are now part of Northeast China. Many of the Jurchen tribes were vassals of the Liao dynasty (907–1125), an empire ruled by the nomadic Khitans that included most of modern Mongolia, a portion of North China, Northeast China, northern Korea, and parts of the Russian Far East. To the south of the Liao lay the Han Chinese Song Empire (960–1276). The Song and Liao were at peace, but since a military defeat to the Liao in 1005, the Song paid its northern neighbor an annual indemnity of 200,000 bolts of silk and 100,000 ounces of silver. Before the Jurchens overthrew the Khitan, married Jurchen women and Jurchen girls were raped by Liao Khitan envoys as a custom which caused resentment by the Jurchens against the Khitan. Song princesses committed suicide to avoid rape or were killed for resisting rape by the Jin. In 1114, the chieftain Wanyan Aguda (1068–1123) united the disparate Jurchen tribes and led a revolt against the Liao. In 1115 he named himself emperor of the Jin \\"golden\\" dynasty (1115–1234). Informed by a Liao defector of the success of the Jurchen uprising, the Song emperor Huizong (r. 1100–1127) and his highest military commander the eunuch Tong Guan saw the Liao weakness as an opportunity to recover the Sixteen Prefectures, a line of fortified cities and passes that the Liao had annexed from the Shatuo Turk Later Jin in 938, and that the Song had repeatedly but unsuccessfully tried to reconquer. The Song thus sought an alliance with the Jin against their common enemy the Liao. Jurchen chieftain Wanyan Aguda, who in 1115 became first emperor of the Jin dynasty Because the land routes between the Song and Jin were controlled by the Liao, diplomatic exchanges had to occur by traveling across the Bohai Sea. Negotiations for an alliance began secretly under the pretense that the Song wanted to acquire horses from the Khitans. Song diplomats traveled to the Jin court to meet Aguda in 1118, while Jurchen envoys arrived in the Song capital Kaifeng the next year. At the beginning, the two sides agreed to keep whatever Liao territory they would seize in combat. In 1120, Aguda agreed to cede the Sixteen Prefectures to the Song in exchange for transfer to the Jin of the annual tributary payments that the Song had been giving the Liao. By the end of 1120, however, the Jurchens had seized the Liao Supreme Capital, and offered the Song only parts of the Sixteen Prefectures. Among other things, Jin would keep the Liao Western Capital of Datong at the western end of the Sixteen Prefectures. The two sides agreed that the Jin would now attack the Liao Central Capital, whereas the Song would seize the Liao Southern Capital, Yanjing (modern-day Beijing). The joint attack against the Liao had been planned for 1121, but it was rescheduled for 1122. On February 23 of that year, Jin captured the Liao Central Capital as promised. The Song delayed their entry into the war because it diverted resources to fighting the Western Xia in the northwest and suppressing a large popular rebellion led by Fang La in the south. When a Song army under Tong Guan's command finally attacked Yanjing in May 1122, the smaller forces of the weakened Liao repelled the invaders with ease. Another attack failed in the fall. Both times, Tong was forced to retreat back to Kaifeng. After the first attack, Aguda changed the terms of the agreement and only promised Yanjing and six other prefectures to the Song. In early 1123 it was Jurchen forces that easily took the Liao Southern Capital. They sacked it and enslaved its population. The quick collapse of the Liao led to more negotiations between the Song and Jin. Jurchen military success and their effective control over the Sixteen Prefectures gave them more leverage. Aguda grew increasingly frustrated as he realized that despite their military failures the Song still intended to seize most of the prefectures. In the spring of 1123 the two sides finally set the terms of the first Song–Jin treaty. Only seven prefectures (including Yanjing) would be returned to the Song, and the Song would pay an annual indemnity of 300,000 packs of silk and 200,000 taels of silver to the Jin, as well as a one-time payment of one million strings of copper coins to compensate the Jurchens for the tax revenue they would have earned had they not returned the prefectures. In May 1123 Tong Guan and the Song armies entered the looted Yanjing. War against the Northern Song Jin emperor Taizong at the Museum of the First Capital of Jin. Taizong ordered military campaigns that led to the fall of the northern Song in 1127.alt=Modern statue of Jin emperor Taizong on horseback holding a weapon =Collapse of the Song–Jin alliance= Barely one month after the Song had recovered Yanjing, Zhang Jue (), who had served as military governor of the Liao prefecture of Pingzhou about east of Yanjing, killed the main Jin official in that city and turned it over to the Song. The Jurchens defeated his armies a few months later and Zhang took refuge in Yanjing. Even though the Song agreed to execute him in late 1123, this incident put tension between the two states, because the 1123 treaty had explicitly forbidden both sides from harboring defectors. In 1124, Song officials further angered Jin by asking for the cession of nine more border prefectures. The new Jin emperor Taizong (r. 1123–1135), Aguda's brother and successor, hesitated, but warrior princes Wanyan Zonghan and Wanyan Zongwang () vehemently refused to give them any more territory. Taizong eventually granted two prefectures, but by then the Jin leaders were ready to attack their southern neighbor. Before they could invade the Song, the Jurchens reached a peace agreement with their western neighbors the Tangut Western Xia in 1124. The following year near the Ordos Desert, they captured Tianzuo, the last emperor of the Liao, putting an end to the Liao dynasty for good. Ready to end their alliance with the Song, the Jurchens began preparations for an invasion. =First campaign= In November 1125 Taizong ordered his armies to attack the Song. The defection of Zhang Jue two years earlier served as the casus belli. Two armies were sent to capture the major cities of the Song. Siege of Taiyuan The western army, led by Wanyan Zonghan, departed from Datong and headed towards Taiyuan through the mountains of Shanxi, on its way to the Song western capital Luoyang. The Song forces were not expecting an invasion and were caught off guard. The Chinese general Tong Guan was informed of the military expedition by an envoy he had sent to the Jin to obtain the cession of two prefectures. The returning envoy reported that the Jurchens were willing to forgo an invasion if the Song ceded control of Hebei and Shanxi to the Jin. Tong Guan retreated from Taiyuan and left command of his troops to Wang Bing. Jin armies besieged the city in mid January 1126. Under Wang Bing's command, Taiyuan held on long enough to stop the Jurchen troops from advancing to Luoyang. First siege of Kaifeng Jin invasions of Song, 1125–1126 Emperor Huizong left Kaifeng on January 28, 1126 as the Jurchen army approached the city.alt=Emperor Huizong sitting on his throne Meanwhile, the eastern army, commanded by Wanyan Zongwang, was dispatched towards Yanjing (modern Beijing) and eventually the Song capital Kaifeng. It did not face much armed opposition. Zongwang easily took Yanjing, where Song general and former Liao governor Guo Yaoshi () switched his allegiances to the Jin. When the Song had tried to reclaim the Sixteen Prefectures, they had faced fierce resistance from the Han Chinese population, yet when the Jurchens invaded that area, the Han Chinese did not oppose them at all. By the end of December 1125, the Jin army had seized control of two prefectures and re-established Jurchen rule over the Sixteen Prefectures. The eastern army was nearing Kaifeng by early 1126. Fearing the approaching Jin army, Song emperor Huizong planned to retreat south. The emperor deserting the capital would have been viewed as an act of capitulation, so court officials convinced him to abdicate. There were few objections. Rescuing an empire in crisis from destruction was more important than preserving the rituals of imperial inheritance. In January 1126, a few days before the New Year, Huizong abdicated in favor of his son and was demoted to the ceremonial role of Retired Emperor. The Jurchen forces reached the Yellow River on January 27, 1126, two days after the New Year. Huizong fled Kaifeng the next day, escaping south and leaving the newly enthroned emperor Qinzong (r. 1126–1127) in charge of the capital. Kaifeng was besieged on January 31, 1126. The commander of the Jurchen army promised to spare the city if the Song submitted to Jin as a vassal; forfeited the prime minister and an imperial prince as prisoners; ceded the Chinese prefectures of Hejian, Taiyuan, and Zhongshan; and offered an indemnity of 50 million taels of silver, 5 million taels of gold, 1 million packs of silk, 1 million packs of satin, 10,000 horses, 10,000 mules, 10,000 cattle, and 1,000 camels. This indemnity was worth about 180 years of the annual tribute the Song had been paying to the Jin since 1123. With little prospect of help from afar arriving, infighting broke out in the Song court between the officials who supported the Jin offer and those who opposed it. Opponents of the treaty like Li Gang (; 1083–1140) rallied around the proposal of remaining in defensive positions until reinforcements arrived and Jurchen supplies ran out. They botched an ambush against the Jin that was carried out at night, and were replaced by officials who supported peace negotiations. The failed attack pushed Qinzong into meeting the Jurchen demands, and his officials convinced him to go through with the deal. The Song recognized Jin control over the three prefectures. The Jurchen army ended the siege in March after 33 days. =Second campaign= Almost as soon as the Jin armies had left Kaifeng, Emperor Qinzong reneged on the deal and dispatched two armies to repel the Jurchen troops attacking Taiyuan and bolster the defenses of Zhongshan and Hejian. An army of 90,000 soldiers and another of 60,000 were defeated by Jin forces by June. A second expedition to rescue Taiyuan was also unsuccessful. Accusing the Song of violating the agreement and realizing the weakness of the Song, the Jin generals launched a second punitive campaign, again dividing their troops into two armies. Wanyan Zonghan, who had withdrawn from Taiyuan after the Kaifeng agreement and left a small force in charge of the siege, came back with his western army. Overwhelmed, Taiyuan fell in September 1126, after 260 days of siege. When the Song court received news of the fall of Taiyuan, the officials who had advocated defending the empire militarily fell from favor again and were replaced by counselors who favored appeasement. In mid-December the two Jurchen armies converged on Kaifeng for the second time that year. Second siege of Kaifeng After the defeat of several Song armies in the north, Emperor Qinzong wanted to negotiate a truce with the Jin, but he committed a massive strategic blunder when he commanded his remaining armies to protect prefectural cities instead of Kaifeng. Neglecting the importance of the capital, he left Kaifeng defended with fewer than 100,000 soldiers. The Song forces were dispersed throughout China, powerless to stop the second Jurchen siege of the city. The Jin assault commenced in mid-December 1126. Even as fighting raged on, Qinzong continued to sue for peace, but Jin demands for territory were enormous: they wanted all provinces north of the Yellow River. After more than twenty days of heavy combat against the besieging forces, Song defenses were decimated and the morale of Song soldiers was on the decline. On January 9, 1127, the Jurchens broke through and started to loot the conquered city. Emperor Qinzong tried to appease the victors by offering the remaining wealth of the capital. The royal treasury was emptied and the belongings of the city's residents were seized. The Song emperor offered his unconditional surrender a few days later. Qigong, the former emperor Huizong, and members of the Song court were captured by the Jurchens as hostages. They were taken north to Huining (modern Harbin), where they were stripped of their royal privileges and reduced to commoners. The former emperors were humiliated by their captors. They were mocked with disparaging titles like \\"Muddled Virtue\\" and \\"Double Muddled\\". In 1128 Jin made them perform a ritual meant for war criminals. The harsh treatment of the Song royalty softened after the death of Huizong in 1135. Titles were granted to the deceased monarch, and his son Qinzong was promoted to Duke, a position with a salary. =Reasons for Song failure= alt=Painting of a bearded Chinese man playing the zither, with another man sitting on a stone listening to the music Many factors contributed to the Song's repeated military blunders and subsequent loss of northern China to the Jurchens. Traditional accounts of Song history held the venality of Huizong's imperial court responsible for the decline of the dynasty. These narratives condemned Huizong and his officials for their moral failures. Early Song emperors were eager to enact political reforms and revive the ethical framework of Confucianism, but the enthusiasm for reforms gradually died after the reformist Wang Anshi's expulsion as chancellor in 1076. Corruption marred the reign of Huizong, who was more skilled as a painter than as a ruler. Huizong was known for his extravagance, and funded the costly construction of gardens and temples while rebellions threatened the state's grip on power. A modern analysis by Ari Daniel Levine places more of the blame on deficiencies in the military and bureaucratic leadership. The loss of northern China was not inevitable. The military was overextended by a government too assured of its own military prowess. Huizong diverted the state's resources to failed wars against the Western Xia. The Song insistence on a greater share of Liao territory only succeeded in provoking their Jin allies. Song diplomatic oversights underestimated Jin and allowed the unimpeded rise of Jurchen military power. The state had plentiful resources, with the exception of horses, but managed its assets poorly during battles. Unlike the expansive Han and Tang empires that preceded the Song, the Song did not have a significant foothold in Central Asia where a large proportion of its horses could be bred or procured. As Song general Li Gang noted, without a consistent supply of horses the dynasty was at a significant disadvantage against Jurchen cavalry: \\"Jin were victorious only because they used iron-shielded cavalry, while we opposed them with foot soldiers. It is only to be expected that [our soldiers] were scattered and dispersed.\\" Wars with the Southern Song Jin invasions of Song, 1126–1130 =Southern retreat of the Song court= The enthronement of Emperor Gaozong The Jin leadership had not expected or desired the fall of the Song dynasty. Their intention was to weaken the Song in order to demand more tribute, and they were unprepared for the magnitude of their victory. The Jurchens were preoccupied with strengthening their rule over the areas once controlled by Liao. Instead of continuing their invasion of the Song, an empire with a military that outnumbered their own, they adopted the strategy of \\"using Chinese to control the Chinese\\". The Jin hoped a proxy state would be capable of administering northern China and collecting the annual indemnity without requiring Jurchen interventions to quell anti-Jin uprisings. In 1127, the Jurchens installed a former Song official, Zhang Bangchang (張邦昌; 1081–1127), as puppet emperor of the newly established \\"Da Chu\\" (Great Chu) dynasty. The puppet government did not deter the resistance in northern China, but the insurgents were motivated by their anger towards the Jurchens' looting rather than by a sense of loyalty towards the inept Song court. A number of Song commanders, stationed in towns scattered across northern China, retained their allegiance to the Song, and armed volunteers organized militias opposed to the Jurchen military presence. The insurgency hampered the ability of the Jin to exert control over the north. Meanwhile, one Song prince, Zhao Gou, had escaped capture. He had been held up in Cizhou while on a diplomatic mission, and never made it back to Kaifeng. He was not present in the capital when the city fell to the Jurchens. The future Emperor Gaozong managed to evade the Jurchen troops tailing him by moving from one province to the next, traveling across Hebei, Henan, and Shandong. The Jurchens tried to lure him back to Kaifeng where they could finally capture him, but did not succeed. Zhao Gou finally arrived in the Song Southern Capital at Yingtianfu (; modern Shangqiu) in early June 1127. For Gaozong (r. 1127–1162), Yingtianfu was the first in a series of temporary capitals called xingzai . The court moved to Yingtianfu because of its historical importance to Emperor Taizu of Song, the founder of the dynasty, who had previously served in that city as a military governor. The symbolism of the city was meant to secure the political legitimacy of the new emperor, who was enthroned there on June 12. After reigning for barely one month, Zhang Bangchang was persuaded by the Song to step down as emperor of the Great Chu and to recognize the legitimacy of the Song imperial line. Li Gang pressured Gaozong to execute Zhang for betraying the Song. The emperor relented and Zhang was coerced into suicide. The killing of Zhang showed that the Song was willing to provoke the Jin, and that the Jin had yet to solidify their control over the newly conquered territories. The submission and abolition of Chu meant that Kaifeng was now back under Song control. Zong Ze (; 1059–1128), the Song general responsible for fortifying Kaifeng, entreated Gaozong to move the court back to the city, but Gaozong refused and retreated south. The southward move marked the end of the Northern Song and the beginning of the Southern Song era of Chinese history. The descendant of Confucius at Qufu, the Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou fled south with the Song Emperor to Quzhou, while the newly established Jin dynasty (1115–1234) in the north appointed Kong Duanyou's brother Kong Duancao who remained in Qufu as Duke Yansheng. Zhang Xuan 張選, a great-grandson of Zhang Zai, also fled south with Gaozong. The move south The Song disbandment of the Great Chu and execution of Zhang Bangchang antagonized the Jurchens and violated the treaty that the two parties had negotiated. The Jin renewed their attacks on the Song and quickly reconquered much of northern China. In late 1127 Gaozong moved his court further south from Yingtianfu to Yangzhou, south of the Huai River and north of the Yangtze River, by sailing down the Grand Canal. The court spent over a year in the city. When the Jurchens advanced to the Huai River, the court was partially evacuated to Hangzhou in 1129. Days later, Gaozong narrowly escaped on horseback, just a few hours ahead of Jurchen vanguard troops. After a coup in Hangzhou almost dethroned him, in May 1129 he moved his capital back north to Jiankang (modern Nanjing) on the south bank of the Yangtze. One month later, however, Zong Ze's successor Du Chong () vacated his forces from Kaifeng, exposing Jiankang to attack. The emperor moved back to Hangzhou in September, leaving Jiankang in Du Chong's hands. The Jin eventually captured Kaifeng in early 1130. From 1127 to 1129, the Song sent thirteen embassies to the Jin to discuss peace terms and to negotiate the release of Gaozong's mother and Huizong, but the Jin court ignored them. In December 1129, the Jin started a new military offensive, dispatching two armies across the Huai River in the east and west. On the western front, an army invaded Jiangxi, the area where the Song dowager empress resided, and captured Hongzhou (, present-day Nanchang). They were ordered to retreat a few months later when the eastern army withdrew. Meanwhile, on the eastern front, Wuzhu commanded the main Jin army. He crossed the Yangtze southwest of Jiankang and took that city when Du Chong surrendered. Wuzhu set out from Jiankang and advanced rapidly to try to capture Gaozong. The Jin seized Hangzhou (January 22, 1130) and then Shaoxing further south (February 4), but general Zhang Jun's (1086–1154) battle with Wuzhu near Ningbo gave Gaozong time to escape. By the time Wuzhu resumed pursuit, the Song court was fleeing on ships to islands off the coast of Zhejiang, and then further south to Wenzhou. The Jin sent ships to chase after Gaozong, but failed to catch him. They gave up the pursuit and the Jurchens retreated north. After they plundered the undefended cities of Hangzhou and Suzhou, they finally started to face resistance from Song armies led by Yue Fei and Han Shizhong. The latter even inflicted a major defeat on Jurchen forces and tried to prevent Wuzhu from crossing back to the north bank of the Yangtze. The small boats of the Jin army were outmatched by Han Shizhong's fleet of seagoing vessels. Wuzhu eventually managed to cross the river when he had his troops use incendiary arrows to neutralize Han's ships by burning their sails. Wuzhu's troops came back south of the Yangtze one last time to Jiankang, which they pillaged, and then headed north. Yet the Jin had been caught off guard by the strength of the Song navy, and Wuzhu never tried to cross the Yangtze River again. In early 1131, Jin armies between the Huai and the Yangtze were repelled by bandits loyal to the Song. Zhang Rong (), the leader of the bandits, was given a government position for his victory against the Jin. After the Jin incursion that almost captured Gaozong, the sovereign ordered pacification commissioner Zhang Jun (1097–1164), who was in charge of Shaanxi and Sichuan in the far west, to attack the Jin there to relieve pressure on the court. Zhang put together a large army, but was defeated by Wuzhu near Xi'an in late 1130. Wuzhu advanced further west into Gansu, and drove as far south as Jiezhou (, modern Wudu). The most important battles between Jin and Song in 1131 and 1132 took place in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan. The Jin lost two battles at Heshang Yuan in 1131. After failing to enter Sichuan, Wuzhu retreated to Yanjing. He returned to the western front again from 1132 to 1134. The Jin attacked Hubei and Shaanxi in 1132. Wuzhu captured Heshang Yuan in 1133, but his advance was halted by a defeat at Xianren Pass. He gave up on taking Sichuan, and no more major battles were fought between the Jin and Song for the rest of the decade. The Song court returned to Hangzhou in 1133, and the city was renamed Lin'an. The imperial ancestral temple was built in Lin'an later that same year, a sign that the court had in practice established Lin'an as the Song capital without a formal declaration. It was treated as a temporary capital. Between 1130 and 1137, the court would sporadically move to Jiankang, and back to Lin'an. There were proposals to make Jiankang the new capital, but Lin'an won out because the court considered it a more secure city. The natural barriers that surrounded Lin'an, including lakes and rice paddies, made it more difficult for the Jurchen cavalry to breach its fortifications. Access to the sea made it easier to retreat from the city. In 1138, Gaozong officially declared Lin'an the capital of the dynasty, but the label of temporary capital would still be in place. Lin'an would remain the capital of the Southern Song for the next 150 years, growing into a major commercial and cultural center. =Da Qi invades the Song= Qin Hui, an official of the Song court, recommended a peaceful solution to the conflict in 1130, saying that, \\"If it is desirable that there will be no more conflicts under Heaven, it is necessary for the southerners to stay in the south and the northerners in the north.\\" Gaozong, who considered himself a northerner, initially rejected the proposal. There were gestures toward peace in 1132, when the Jin freed an imprisoned Song diplomat, and in 1133, when the Song offered to become a Jin vassal, but a treaty never materialized. The Jin requirement that the border between the two states be moved south from the Huai River to the Yangtze was too large of a hurdle for the two sides to reach an agreement. The continuing insurgency of anti-Jin forces in northern China hampered the Jurchen campaigns south of the Yangtze. Reluctant to let the war drag on, the Jin decided to create Da Qi (the \\"Great Qi\\"), their second attempt at a puppet state in northern China. The Jurchens believed that this state, nominally ruled by someone of Han Chinese descent, would be able to attract the allegiance of disaffected members of the insurgency. The Jurchens also suffered from a shortage of skilled manpower, and controlling the entirety of northern China was not administratively feasible. In the final months of 1129, Liu Yu (; 1073–1143) won the favor of the Jin emperor Taizong. Liu was a Song official from Hebei who had been a prefect of Jinan in Shandong before his defection to the Jin in 1128. Da Qi was formed late in 1130, and the Jin enthroned Liu as its emperor. Daming in Hebei was the first capital of Qi, before its move to Kaifeng, former capital of the Northern Song. The Qi government instituted military conscription, made an attempt at reforming the bureaucracy, and enacted laws that enforced the collection of high taxes. It was also responsible for supplying a large portion of the troops that fought the Song in the seven years following its creation.

Yue Fei (1103–1142) is second from left, the general Zhang Jun (1086–1154) fourth, and Han Shizhong (1089–1151) fifth. The Jin granted Qi more autonomy than the first puppet government of Chu, but Liu Yu was obligated to obey the orders of the Jurchen generals. With Jin support, Da Qi invaded the Song in November 1133. Li Cheng, a Song turncoat who had joined the Qi, led the campaign. Xiangyang and nearby prefectures fell to his army. The capture of Xiangyang on the Han River gave the Jurchens a passage into the central valley of the Yangtze River. Their southward push was halted by the general Yue Fei. In 1134, Yue Fei defeated Li and retook Xiangyang and its surrounding prefectures. Later that year, however, Qi and Jin initiated a new offensive further east along the Huai River. For the first time, Gaozong issued an edict officially condemning Da Qi. The armies of Qi and Jin won a series of victories in the Huai valley, but were repelled by Han Shizhong near Yangzhou and by Yue Fei at Luzhou (, modern Hefei). Their sudden withdrawal in 1135 in response to the death of Jin Emperor Taizong gave the Song time to regroup. The war recommenced in late 1136 when Da Qi attacked the Huainan circuits of the Song. Qi lost a battle at Outang (), in modern Anhui, against a Song army led by Yang Qizhong (; 1102–1166). The victory boosted Song morale, and the military commissioner Zhang Jun (1097–1164) convinced Gaozong to begin plans for a counterattack. Gaozong first agreed, but he abandoned the counteroffensive when an officer named Li Qiong () killed his superior official and defected to the Jin with tens of thousands of soldiers. Meanwhile, Emperor Xizong (r. 1135–1150) inherited the Jin throne from Taizong, and pushed for peace. He and his generals were disappointed with Liu Yu's military failures and believed that Liu was secretly conspiring with Yue Fei. In late 1137, the Jin reduced Liu Yu's title to that of a prince and abolished the state of Qi. The Jin and Song renewed the negotiations towards peace. =Song counteroffensive and the peace process= Gaozong promoted Qin Hui in 1138 and put him in charge of deliberations with the Jin. Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and a large number of officials at court criticized the peace overtures. Aided by his control of the Censorate, Qin purged his enemies and continued negotiations. In 1138 the Jin and Song agreed to a treaty that designated the Yellow River as border between the two states and recognized Gaozong as a \\"subject\\" of the Jin. But because there remained opposition to the treaty in both the courts of the Jin and Song, the treaty never came into effect. A Jurchen army led by Wuzhu invaded in early 1140. The Song counteroffensive that followed achieved large territorial gains. Song general Liu Qi () won a battle against Wuzhu at Shunchang (modern Fuyang in Anhui). Yue Fei was assigned to head the Song forces defending the Huainan region. Instead of advancing to Huainan, however, Wuzhu retreated to Kaifeng and Yue's army followed him into Jin territory, disobeying an order by Gaozong that forbade Yue from going on the offensive. Yue captured Zhengzhou and sent soldiers across the Yellow River to stir up a peasant rebellion against the Jin. On July 8, 1140, at the Battle of Yancheng, Wuzhu launched a surprise attack on Song forces with an army of 100,000 infantry and 15,000 horsemen. Yue Fei directed his cavalry to attack the Jurchen soldiers and won a decisive victory. He continued on to Henan, where he recaptured Zhengzhou and Luoyang. Later in 1140, Yue was forced to withdraw after the emperor ordered him to return to the Song court. Mural in the alt=Mural of Yue Fei fighting in a battle between the Song and Jin armies Emperor Gaozong supported settling a peace treaty with the Jurchens and sought to rein in the assertiveness of the military. The military expeditions of Yue Fei and other generals were an obstacle to peace negotiations. The government weakened the military by rewarding Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and Zhang Jun (1086–1154) with titles that relieved them of their command over the Song armies. Han Shizhong, a critic of the treaty, retired. Yue Fei also announced his resignation as an act of protest. In 1141 Qin Hui had him imprisoned for insubordination. Charged with treason, Yue Fei was poisoned in jail on Qin's orders in early 1142. Jurchen diplomatic pressure during the peace talks may have played a role, but Qin Hui's alleged collusion with the Jin has never been proven. After his execution, Yue Fei's reputation for defending the Southern Song grew to that of a national folk hero. Qin Hui was denigrated by later historians, who accused him of betraying the Song. The real Yue Fei differed from the later myths based on his exploits. Contrary to traditional legends, Yue was only one of many generals who fought against the Jin in northern China. Traditional accounts have also blamed Gaozong for Yue Fei's execution and submitting to the Jin. Qin Hui, in a reply to Gaozong's gratitude for the success of the peace negotiations, told the emperor that \\"the decision to make peace was entirely Your Majesty's. Your servant only carried it out; what achievement was there in this for me?\\" =Treaty of Shaoxing= alt=Emperor Gaozong's portrait On October 11, 1142, after about a year of negotiations, the Treaty of Shaoxing was ratified, ending the conflict between the Jin and the Song. By the terms of the treaty, the Huai River, north of the Yangtze, was designated as the boundary between the two states. The Song agreed to pay a yearly tribute of 250,000 taels of silver and 250,000 packs of silk to the Jin. The treaty reduced the Southern Song Dynasty status to that of a Jin vassal. The document designated the Song as the \\"insignificant state\\", while the Jin was recognized as the \\"superior state\\". The text of the treaty has not survived in Chinese records, a clear sign of its humiliating reputation. The contents of the agreement were recovered from a Jurchen biography. Once the treaty had been settled, the Jurchens retreated north and trade resumed between the two empires. The peace ensured by the Treaty of Shaoxing lasted for the next 70 years, but was interrupted twice. One military campaign was initiated by the Song and the other by the Jin. =Further campaigns= Wanyan Liang's war Wanyan Liang led a coup against Emperor Xizong and became fourth emperor of the Jin dynasty in 1150. Wanyan Liang presented himself as a Chinese emperor, and planned to unite China by conquering the Song. In 1158, Wanyan Liang provided a casus belli by announcing that the Song had broken the 1142 peace treaty by acquiring horses. He instituted an unpopular draft that was the source of widespread unrest in the empire. Anti-Jin revolts erupted among the Khitans and in Jin provinces bordering the Song. Wanyan Liang did not allow dissent, and opposition to the war was severely punished. The Song had been notified beforehand of Wanyan Liang's plan. They prepared by securing their defenses along the border, mainly near the Yangtze River, but were hampered by Emperor Gaozong's indecisiveness. Gaozong's desire for peace made him averse to provoking the Jin. Wanyan Liang began the invasion in 1161 without formally declaring war. Jurchen armies personally led by Wanyan Liang left Kaifeng on October 15, reached the Huai River border on October 28, and marched in the direction of the Yangtze. The Song lost the Huai to the Jurchens but captured a few Jin prefectures in the west, slowing the Jurchen advance. A group of Jurchen generals were sent to cross the Yangtze near the city of Caishi (south of Ma'anshan in modern Anhui) while Wanyan Liang established a base near Yangzhou. Song dynasty river ship armed with a trebuchet catapult on its top deck, from the Wujing Zongyao The Song official Yu Yunwen was in command of the army defending the river. The Jurchen army was defeated while attacking Caishi between November 26 and 27 during the Battle of Caishi. The paddle-wheel ships of the Song navy, armed with trebuchets that fired gunpowder bombs, overwhelmed the light ships of the Jin fleet. Jin ships were unable to compete because they were smaller and hastily constructed. The bombs launched by the Song contained mixtures of gunpowder, lime, scraps of iron, and a poison that was likely arsenic. Traditional Chinese accounts consider this the turning point of the war, characterizing it as a military upset that secured southern China from the northern invaders. The significance of the battle is said to have rivaled a similarly revered victory at the Battle of Fei River in the 4th century. Contemporaneous Song accounts claimed that the 18,000 Song soldiers commanded by Yu Yunwen and tasked with defending Caishi were able to defeat the invading Jurchen army of 400,000 soldiers. Modern historians are more skeptical and consider the Jurchen numbers an exaggeration. Song historians may have confused the number of Jurchen soldiers at the Battle of Caishi with the total number of soldiers under the command of Wanyan Liang. The conflict was not the one-sided battle that traditional accounts imply, and the Song had numerous advantages over the Jin. The Song fleet was larger than the Jin's, and the Jin were unable to use their greatest asset, cavalry, in a naval battle. A modern analysis of the battlefield has shown that it was a minor battle, although the victory did boost Song morale. The Jin lost, but only suffered about 4,000 casualties and the battle was not fatal to the Jurchen war effort. It was Wanyan Liang's poor relationships with the Jurchen generals, who despised him, that doomed the chances of a Jin victory. On December 15, Wanyan Liang was assassinated in his military camp by disaffected officers. He was succeeded by Emperor Shizong (r. 1161–1189). Shizong was pressured into ending the unpopular war with the Song, and ordered the withdrawal of Jin forces in 1162. Emperor Gaozong retired from the throne that same year. His mishandling of the war with Wanyan Liang was one of many reasons for his abdication. Skirmishes between the Song and Jin continued along the border, but subsided in 1165 after the negotiation of a peace treaty. There were no major territorial changes. The treaty dictated that the Song still had to pay the annual indemnity, but the indemnity was renamed from \\"tribute\\", which had implied a subordinate relationship, to \\"payment\\". Song revanchism alt=Jurchen warrior standing, carrying a bow The Jin were weakened by the pressure of the rising Mongols to the north, a series of floods culminating in a Yellow River flood in 1194 that devastated Hebei and Shandong in northern China, and the droughts and swarming locusts that plagued the south near the Huai. The Song were informed of the Jurchen predicament by their ambassadors, who traveled twice a year to the Jin capital, and started provoking their northern neighbor. The hostilities were instigated by chancellor Han Tuozhou. The Song Emperor Ningzong (r. 1194–1224) took little interest in the war effort. Under Han Tuozhou's supervision, preparations for the war proceeded gradually and cautiously. The court venerated the irredentist hero Yue Fei and Han orchestrated the publishing of historical records that justified war with the Jin. From 1204 onwards, Chinese armed groups raided Jurchen settlements. Han Tuozhou was designated the head of national security in 1205. The Song funded insurgents in the north that professed loyalist sympathies. These early clashes continued to escalate, partly abetted by revanchist Song officials, and war against the Jin was officially declared on June 14, 1206. The document that announced the war claimed the Jin lost the Mandate of Heaven, a sign that they were unfit to rule, and called for an insurrection of Han Chinese against the Jin state. Song armies led by general Bi Zaiyu (; d. 1217) captured the barely defended border city of Sizhou (on the north bank of the Huai River across from modern Xuyi County) but suffered large losses against the Jurchens in Hebei. The Jin repelled the Song and moved south to besiege the Song town of Chuzhou on the Grand Canal just south of the Huai River. Bi defended the town, and the Jurchens withdrew from the siege after three months. By the fall of 1206, however, the Jurchens had captured multiple towns and military bases. The Jin initiated an offensive against Song prefectures in the central front of the war, capturing Zaoyang and Guanghua (; on the Han River near modern Laohekou). By the fall of 1206, the Song offensive had already failed disastrously. Soldier morale sank as weather conditions worsened, supplies ran out, and hunger spread, forcing many to desert. The massive defections of Han Chinese in northern China that the Song had expected never materialized. A notable betrayal did occur on the Song side, however: Wu Xi (; d. 1207), the governor- general of Sichuan, defected to the Jin in December 1206. The Song had depended on Wu's success in the west to divert Jin soldiers away from the eastern front. He had attacked Jin positions earlier in 1206, but his army of about 50,000 men had been repelled. Wu's defection could have meant the loss of the entire western front of the war, but Song loyalists assassinated Wu on March 29, 1207, before Jin troops could take control of the surrendered territories. An Bing (; d. 1221) was given Wu Xi's position, but the cohesion of Song forces in the west fell apart after Wu's demise and commanders turned on each other in the ensuing infighting. Fighting continued in 1207, but by the end of that year the war was at a stalemate. The Song was now on the defensive, while the Jin failed to make gains in Song territory. The failure of Han Tuozhou's aggressive policies led to his demise. On December 15, 1207, Han was beaten to death by the Imperial Palace Guards. His accomplice Su Shidan () was executed, and other officials connected to Han were dismissed or exiled. Since neither combatant was eager to continue the war, they returned to negotiations. A peace treaty was signed on November 2, 1208, and the Song tribute to the Jin was reinstated. The Song annual indemnity increased by 50,000 taels of silver and 50,000 packs of fabric. The treaty also stipulated that the Song had to present to the Jin the head of Han Tuozhou, who the Jin held responsible for starting the war. The heads of Han and Su were severed from their exhumed corpses, exhibited to the public, then delivered to the Jin. Jin–Song war during the rise of the Mongols Battle between the Jin and Mongols in 1211, from the alt=Jin cavalry fighting a battle against Mongol cavalry The Mongols, a nomadic confederation, had unified in the middle of the twelfth century. They and other steppe nomads occasionally raided the Jin empire from the northwest. The Jin shied away from punitive expeditions and was content with appeasement, similar to the practices of the Song. The Mongols, formerly a Jin tributary, ended their Jurchen vassalage in 1210 and attacked the Jin in 1211. In light of this event, the Song court debated ending tributary payments to the weakened Jin, but they again chose to avoid antagonizing the Jin. They refused Western Xia's offers of allying against the Jin in 1214 and willingly complied when in 1215 the Jin rejected a request to lower the annual indemnity. Meanwhile, in 1214, the Jin retreated from the besieged capital of Zhongdu to Kaifeng, which became the new capital of the dynasty. As the Mongols expanded, the Jin suffered territorial losses and attacked the Song in 1217 to compensate for their shrinking territory. Periodic Song raids against the Jin were the official justification for the war. Another likely motive was that the conquest of the Song would have given the Jin a place to escape should the Mongols succeed in taking control of the north. Shi Miyuan (; 1164–1233), the chancellor of Song Emperor Lizong (r. 1224–1264), was hesitant to fight the Jin and delayed the declaration of war for two months. Song generals were largely autonomous, allowing Shi to evade blame for their military blunders. The Jin advanced across the border from the center and western fronts. Jurchen military successes were limited, and the Jin faced repeated raids from the neighboring state of Western Xia. In 1217, the Song generals Meng Zongzheng () and Hu Zaixing () defeated the Jin and prevented them from capturing Zaoyang and Suizhou. A second Jin campaign in late 1217 did marginally better than the first. In the east, the Jin made little headway in the Huai River valley, but in the west they captured Xihezhou and Dasan Pass (; modern Shaanxi) in late 1217. The Jin tried to captured Suizhou in Jingxi South circuit again in 1218 and 1219, but failed. A Song counteroffensive in early 1218 captured Sizhou and in 1219 the Jin cities of Dengzhou and Tangzhou were pillaged twice by a Song army commanded by Zhao Fang (; d. 1221). In the west, command of the Song forces in Sichuan was given to An Bing, who had previously been dismissed from this position. He successfully defended the western front, but was unable to advance further because of local uprisings in the area. The Jin tried to extort an indemnity from the Song but never received it. In the last of the three campaigns, in early 1221, the Jin captured the city of Qizhou (; in Huainan West) deep in Song territory. Song armies led by Hu Zaixing and Li Quan (; d. 1231) defeated the Jin, who then withdrew. In 1224 both sides agreed on a peace treaty that ended the annual tributes to the Jin. Diplomatic missions between the Jin and Song were also cut off. Mongol–Song alliance Mongol–Song conquest of Jurchen Jin In February 1233, the Mongols took Kaifeng after a siege of more than 10 months and the Jin court retreated to the town of Caizhou. In 1233 Emperor Aizong (r. 1224–1234) of the Jin dispatched diplomats to implore the Song for supplies. Jin envoys reported to the Song that the Mongols would invade the Song after they were done with the Jin—a forecast that would later be proven true—but the Song ignored the warning and rebuffed the request. They instead formed an alliance with the Mongols against the Jin. The Song provided supplies to the Mongols in return for parts of Henan. The Jin dynasty collapsed when Mongol and Song troops defeated the Jurchens at the siege of Caizhou in 1234. General Meng Gong () led the Song army against Caizhou. The penultimate emperor of the Jin, Emperor Aizong, took his own life. His short- lived successor, Emperor Mo, was killed in the town a few days later. The Mongols later turned their sights towards the Song. After decades of war, the Song dynasty also fell in 1279, when the remaining Song loyalists lost to the Mongols in a naval battle near Guangdong. Historical significance =Cultural and demographic changes= Jurchen migrants from the northeastern reaches of Jin territory settled in the Jin-controlled lands of northern China. Constituting less than ten percent of the total population, the two to three million ruling Jurchens were a minority in a region that was still dominated by 30 million Han Chinese. The southward expansion of the Jurchens caused the Jin to transition their decentralized government of semi-agrarian tribes to a bureaucratic Chinese-style dynasty. A medallion with writing in the alt=A medallion inscribed with Jurchen script The Jin government initially promoted an independent Jurchen culture alongside their adoption of the centralized Chinese imperial bureaucracy, but the empire was gradually sinicized over time. The Jurchens became fluent in the Chinese language, and the philosophy of Confucianism was used to legitimize the ruling government. Confucian state rituals were adopted during the reign of Emperor Xizong (1135–1150). The Jin implemented imperial exams on the Confucian Classics, first regionally and then for the entire empire. The Classics and other works of Chinese literature were translated into Jurchen and studied by Jin intellectuals, but very few Jurchens actively contributed to the classical literature of the Jin. The Khitan script, from the Chinese family of scripts, formed the basis of a national writing system for the empire, the Jurchen script. All three scripts were working languages of the government. Jurchen clans adopted Chinese personal names with their Jurchen names. Wanyan Liang (Prince of Hailing; r. 1150–1161) was an enthusiastic proponent of Jurchen sinicization and enacted policies to encourage it. Wanyan Liang had been acculturated by Song diplomats from childhood, and his emulation of Song practices earned him the Jurchen nickname of \\"aping the Chinese\\". He studied the Chinese classics, drank tea, and played Chinese chess for recreation. Under his reign, the administrative core of the Jin state was moved south from Huining. He instated Beijing as the Jin main capital in 1153. Palaces were erected in Beijing and Kaifeng, while the original, more northerly residences of Jurchen chieftains were demolished. The emperor's political reforms were connected with his desire to conquer all of China and to legitimize himself as a Chinese emperor. The prospect of conquering southern China was cut short by Wanyan Liang's assassination. Wanyan Liang's successor, Emperor Shizong, was less enthusiastic about sinicization and reversed several of Wanyan Liang's edicts. He sanctioned new policies with the intent to slow the assimilation of the Jurchens. Shizong's prohibitions were abandoned by Emperor Zhangzong (r. 1189–1208), who promoted reforms that transformed the political structure of the dynasty closer to that of the Song and Tang dynasties. Despite cultural and demographic changes, military hostilities between the Jin and the Song persisted until the fall of the Jin. In the south, the retreat of the Song dynasty led to major demographic changes. The population of refugees from the north that resettled in Lin'an and Jiankang (modern Hangzhou and Nanjing) eventually grew greater than the population of original residents, whose numbers had dwindled from repeated Jurchen raids. The government encouraged the resettlement of peasant migrants from the southern provinces of the Song to the underpopulated territories between the Yangtze and the Huai rivers. The new capital Lin'an grew into a major commercial and cultural center. It rose from a middling city of no special importance to one of the world's largest and most prosperous. During his stay in Lin'an in the Yuan dynasty (1260–1368), when the city was not as wealthy as it had been under the Song, Marco Polo remarked that \\"this city is greater than any in the world\\". Once retaking northern China became less plausible and Lin'an grew into a significant trading city, the government buildings were extended and renovated to better befit its status as an imperial capital. The modestly sized imperial palace was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls. The loss of northern China, the cultural center of Chinese civilization, diminished the regional status of the Song dynasty. After the Jurchen conquest of the north, Korea recognized the Jin, not the Song, as the legitimate dynasty of China. The Song's military failures reduced it to a subordinate of the Jin, turning it into a \\"China among equals\\". The Song economy, however, recovered quickly after the move south. Government revenues earned from taxing foreign trade nearly doubled between the closing of the Northern Song era in 1127 and the final years of Gaozong's reign in the early 1160s. The recovery was not uniform, and areas like Huainan and Hubei that had been directly affected by the war took decades to return to their pre-war levels. In spite of multiple wars, the Jin remained one of the main trading partners of the Song. Song demand for foreign products like fur and horses went unabated. Historian believes that Song commerce with the north was profitable enough that it compensated for the silver delivered annually as an indemnity to the Jin. The Jin–Song Wars were one of several wars in northern China along with the Uprising of the Five Barbarians, An Lushan Rebellion, Huang Chao Rebellion and the wars of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms which caused a mass migration of Han Chinese from northern China to southern China called 衣冠南渡(yì guān nán dù).衣冠南渡 ．在线新华字典[引用日期2013-08-09唐宋时期的北人南迁 ．内蒙古教育出版社官网．2008-01-15[引用日期2013-08-09]六朝时期北人南迁及蛮族的流布 ．内蒙古教育出版社官网．2008-01-15[引用日期2013-08-09]东晋建康的开始—永嘉南渡 ．通南京网．2012-10-10[引用日期2013-08-09]从衣冠南渡到西部大开发 ．中国期刊网．2011-4-26 [引用日期2013-08-12]中华书局编辑部．全唐诗．北京：中华书局，1999-01-1 ：761 In 1126–1127 over half a million fled from northern China to southern China including Li Qingzhao. One section of the Confucius family led by Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou moved south to Quzhou with Southern Song emperor Gaozong while his brother Kong Duancao remained behind in Qufu and became the Duke Yansheng for the Jin dynasty. A section of the Zengzi family also moved south with the Southern Song while the other part of the Zengzi family stayed in the north. However, there was also a reverse migration when the war was over of Han Chinese from the Southern Song towards Jin ruled northern China leading southern China's population to shrink and northern China's population to grow. =Gunpowder warfare= De'an in 1132, shown in the Ming dynasty Huolongjing firing pellets as projectilesalt=Fire lance firing pellets The battles between the Song and the Jin spurred the invention and use of gunpowder weapons. There are reports that the fire lance, one of the earliest ancestors of the firearm, was used by the Song against the Jurchens besieging De'an (; modern Anlu in eastern Hubei) in 1132, during the Jin invasion of Hubei and Shaanxi. The weapon consisted of a spear attached with a flamethrower capable of firing projectiles from a barrel constructed of bamboo or paper. They were built by soldiers under the command of Chen Gui (), who led the Song army defending De'an. The fire lances with which Song soldiers were equipped at De'an were built for destroying the wooden siege engines of the Jin and not for combat against the Jin infantry. Song soldiers compensated for the limited range and mobility of the weapon by timing their attacks on the Jin siege engines, waiting until they were within range of the fire lances. Later fire lances used metal barrels, fired projectiles farther and with greater force, and could be used against infantry. The pili huoqiu bombs at Caishi contained mixtures of lime and gunpowder. This huoqiu is from the earlier Wujing Zongyao Early rudimentary bombs like the huopao fire bomb () and the huopao () bombs propelled by trebuchet were also in use as incendiary weapons. The defending Song army used huopao () during the first Jin siege of Kaifeng in 1126. On the opposing side, the Jin launched incendiary bombs from siege towers down onto the city below. In 1127, huopao () were employed by the Song troops defending De'an and by the Jin soldiers besieging the city. The government official Lin Zhiping () proposed to make incendiary bombs and arrows mandatory for all warships in the Song navy. At the battle of Caishi in 1161, Song ships fired pili huoqiu (), also called pili huopao bombs (), from trebuchets against the ships of the Jin fleet commanded by Wanyan Liang. The gunpowder mixture of the bomb contained powdered lime, which produced blinding smoke once the casing of the bomb shattered. The Song also deployed incendiary weapons at the battle of Tangdao during the same year. Gunpowder was also applied to arrows in 1206 by a Song army stationed in Xiangyang. The arrows were most likely an incendiary weapon, but its function may also have resembled that of an early rocket. At the Jin siege of Qizhou () in 1221, the Jurchens fought the Song with gunpowder bombs and arrows. The Jin tiehuopao (, \\"iron huopao\\"), which had cast iron casings, are the first known bombs that could explode. The bomb needed to be capable of detonating in order to penetrate the iron casing. The Song army had a large supply of incendiary bombs, but there are no reports of them having a weapon similar to the Jin's detonating bombs. A participant in the siege recounted in the Xinsi Qi Qi Lu (辛巳泣蘄錄) that the Song army at Qizhou had an arsenal of 3000 huopao (), 7000 incendiary gunpowder arrows for crossbows and 10000 for bows, as well as 20000 pidapao (), probably leather bags filled with gunpowder.

The two hectares property is situated between Manchester and Colombo Streets. The mansion was initially known as 'Holly Lea', but later became known as McLean's Mansion after its initial owner. It was the largest wooden residence in New Zealand. The mansion, designed by Robert England, architect of Christchurch, is a fusion of styles of Jacobean architecture and Victorian features, akin to the Mentmore Towers (1852–54) of Sir Joseph Paxton in Buckinghamshire in England. It was built between April 1899 and September 1900. The house is registered as a Category I heritage building by Heritage New Zealand. After the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the owners applied to demolish the earthquake-damaged buildings, but their request was denied by the heritage body and the courts. In December 2016, the building sold to a trust that will restore it for use as a gallery. History Designed by Robert England, it was built of kauri by Rennie and Pearce builders between April 1899 and September 1900. It was the largest wooden residential structure in New Zealand at that time. It was constructed for the Scottish philanthropist and immigrant, Allan McLean, when he was 78 years old and he lived in it for the remaining seven years of his life. The building was registered on 7 April 1983 as a Category 1 heritage building. Interior design =Architecture and fittings= The mansion is built to a rectangular plan in Jacobean style, with three stories. The structure's concrete foundation is to a depth of over a pile foundation of . It has a floor area of . The 53 rooms include 19 bedrooms, nine bathrooms, and six servant rooms. The wall frames are of kauri wood fixed with wall plates. The floor is made of wooden joists and sleepers. The dwangs are fixed in an angular direction to give a wavy appearance. The roof domes are made of iron sheets and the pinnacles are of cast-iron crestings, a French design feature. Corrugated iron sheets are used for the roof. The water gutter heads and pipes for draining rain water from the roof are also made of cast iron, though the pipes probably were fitted later, in 1915. The chimneys are also provided but their heights were curtailed at some later stage. The interior fittings are elaborate and ornamental, typical of a Jacobean house. The crafting of the interior ceilings, plasters, mouldings and balustrades is the handiwork of Christchurch artisans. The ceiling depicts roses with mouldings of simple design at the wall corners. The two rooms on the ground floor near the entrance have elaborate coffered ceilings with a well-carved, gilded, central decorative. The top part of the doors in each of the main rooms has a well-ornamented wooden typanium. The balustrades of the staircase and the newel post have been featured with thistles and flowers, an emblem of Scotland (a reminder of the owner's homeland). The newel posts in particular have carvings of acanthus leaves and beading; brass lights which decorate the posts are also fitted over them. The furnishings were of an exclusive design chosen specially by the housekeeper and a fabric expert from Paris. The wall fabrics are of satin brocade in apricot cream colour; they were also fitted under the expert's guidance. The walls of the drawing hall, next to the outer hall, were very elegantly furnished with satin fabrics featuring \\"buttoned braiding at the skirting boards\\". Numerous lights, elegantly designed, were fitted on the walls and ceilings. The white marble fitted fireplace, fixed with ornate brass, completed the scene. The staircase in the hall was fitted with a red carpet and the walls of the hall were embellished with coloured velvet fabrics. The dining room walls were covered with curtains made with satin fabrics which added to the grandeur of the dining room along with an elaborate chandelier and a fireplace fitted with black marble. The silver room was fitted with shelves, from flooring to the roof, filled with \\"tureens, entry dishes, epergnes, teapots and cutlery\\". The fittings in the bathroom were all made of brass, and the bathtubs were of porcelain. =Furniture= At the entrance stood two elaborately carved hat stands. These were in the form of a mahogany tree trunk with branches embossed with a traditional design of bear and cub. The drawing room displayed a mirror bordered with polished mahogany which was fitted with bronze and marble statues. The grandfather clock was a display item in the room. The settees, high backed and in a wing shape were upholstered in a burgundy colour. The ornamental chairs were fitted with regency brocade fabrics while a Persian carpet was a striking feature of the room. A retractable table was also part of the drawing room furnishings. Paintings of Victorian, Flemish and Scottish landscapes were hung from rods in the main rooms on the ground floor and also in the gallery on the first floor. The dining room was fitted with a large table made of oak to seat 14 people, with all related fittings in the room also made in oak. The green and gold dinner service with monogram of A.L. formed part of the dining room cutlery, and the crockery consisted of large dishes to serve turkey and trout. The foyer and the inner hall had high mirrors and velvet curtains. Greenery was added to the setting of the halls and main rooms in the form of potted plants. After the mansion was sold to the government in 1955, most of the furniture and furnishings were carted away, though some were kept at the McLean Institute. Recent history =Threat of demolition= The building suffered significant damage in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake and on 13 July 2013, The Press announced that the building was to be demolished. Just like the last time a Category I heritage building was proposed for demolition (Cranmer Court), this caused an immediate outcry by the community. The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) was criticised for having issued a section 38 (demolition) notice, given that the building is set back from the road by a long distance is thus not posing a threat to the public; a section 38 notice overrides the requirement for a heritage building to go through a public consultation process before it can be demolished. CERA was satisfied that the owners had exhausted all funding options for repair, which was disputed by the Canterbury Earthquake Historic Buildings Fund. The organisation's chair, former Christchurch City Councillor and art historian Anna Crighton, stated that despite having given several million dollars for various projects, they have never been approached by the owners of McLean's Mansion. A strongly-worded editorial in The Press criticised the \\"scanty justification for its tearing down\\", described the proposal as \\"unnecessary destruction\\", and accused CERA of being \\"cavalier\\". CERA's CEO, Roger Sutton, defended his organisation's actions and explained that safety is its primary focus. Heritage preservation is not one of CERA's focusses, and if the community wanted to preserve buildings, then CERA would not stand in the way of that. Two days later, Sutton reconfirmed that CERA is \\"in no hurry to have the place pulled down\\". Crighton was heartened by the response and stated that she has never been contacted by so many people about preserving a building apart from the Cathedral. The owners did not manage to find a buyer for the damaged building and applied in 2013 to Heritage New Zealand for demolition consent but the organisation denied the request. The owners appealed to the Environment Court and in mid-2016, it became known that the court had upheld the Heritage New Zealand decision, stating that \\"the owners did not lack alternatives that could substantially reduce the cost of undertaking restoration\\". The court further found that McLean's Mansion has \\"very high historical and cultural heritage value that justifies protection\\". The public to see the inside of the building, and some of the earthquake damage, when a group of urban explorers took photographs inside the building, with the local newspaper The Press reporting on this, including publishing the photos. =Change of ownership= In August 2018, McLean's Mansion sold to a trust after receiving financial support from Christchurch City Council (CCC), who allocated an entire financial year's central city heritage grant funding (NZ$1.9m) towards the repair. The trust received the purchase price itself as an interest free loan from a family trust. The interior fittings removed in the 1950s are, according to the trustee Trevor Lord, in \\"jaw dropping\\" condition and have been offered for sale to the trust. Purchase and restoration will cost about NZ$12m, and the trust hopes to have the first part of the building open to the public within nine months of repair work starting. The trust intends to use the building as an art gallery and for music performances. It will show part of Sir James Wallace's private art collection. The original trustees were businessman Trevor Lord, artist Philip Trusttum, curator Warren Feeney, and architect David Sheppard; all are Christchurch residents.The current trustees are Chris Kissling, Brian Cribb, Trevor Lord and Timothy Hogan.

The crown is 26 cm high and has a diameter of 13,8 cm. Today the crown is kept at the Museum of Baden (German: Badische Landesmuseum), which itself was built within the old walls of the former Karlsruhe Palace. Grand Duke Karl II of Baden was promoted from margrave to grand duke by Napoleon I, the cousin by marriage of his wife, Stéphanie Louise Adrienne de Beauharnais. Having come into a large amount of jewels and precious metals during the secularisation of many churches Karl II ordered a crown, befitting his new title on the 20th of May 1808. The design of the crown follows the general pattern typical of a European royal crown, but is unique in that the circlet and the arches of the crown are made of gold fabric rather than of a precious metal such as gold or silver-gilt. Karl II died in 1811 before the crown was completed; the persons in charge hurried production of the crown in time for the funeral. The rush is evidenced by the relative simplicity of the crown, and the use of cheap materials in the production such as steel and even paper mache! http://leo-bw.de/highlights/die-badische-krone The aforementioned precious stones which ornament this crown are in metal settings which are attached to this circlet and these arches much like brooches pinned to fabric. At the intersection of the four arches of this crown is a blue enameled orb and a cross both set with diamonds.

He is best remembered for his runner-up performances in the $200,000 93rd running of The Preakness Stakes to Kentucky Derby winner Forward Pass. Background Out of the Way was bred in Kentucky by breeders King Ranch. Out of the Way was sired by Mamboreta and was a grandson of Gulf Stream. He was foaled out of a mare named Way Out who was the progeny of Alibhai.Out Of The Way's pedigree and partial racing stats Racing career =Early racing career= Trained by Max Hirsch, Out of the Way was very slow to develop, winning only his maiden and one allowance race during his two-year-old season. In April 1968, the owner of Out of the Way, King Ranch, decided to run him in the mile and one eighth Wood Memorial Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack. He finished fourth to the eventual Kentucky Derby Champion Dancer's Image, who later became the only winner of the Derby to be disqualified. Then in the Withers Stakes, Out of the Way again finished fourth, this time to Call Me Prince, his entry-mate owned by Mrs. Adele L. Rand, also trained by Max Hirsch. =1968 Preakness Stakes= On May 18, 1968 Out of the Way was entered into the second jewel of the American Triple Crown, the $200,000 Preakness Stakes, run at a mile and three sixteenths on dirt at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. Out of the Way was listed on the morning line as a long shot at 15-1 in a field of ten colts. The official Derby winner, Forward Pass, was the even money favorite at 1-1 with the disqualified Derby winner, Dancer's Image, slightly higher but also listed at even money at 1-1. Out of the Way broke ninth out of ten under jockey John L. Rotz. He lost ground around both turns by in the middle of the track. Going into Pimlico's famous \\"Clubhouse Turn,\\" he moved up slightly into seventh. Out of the Way continued in the outside paths while improving to fifth going down the backstretch. Fractions on the front end of the race were fast. The leaders finished the first quarter in :23 seconds flat and the half in :471/5. After 3/4 of a mile, Nodouble led the race by a head in front of Forward Pass, who was a head in front of 88-1 long shot Martin's Jig. The top three were within half a length of each other. Out of the Way was on the outside around the final turn, within striking distance of the leaders. At the top of the stretch, he closed steadily with every stride but could not catch the leader, Forward Pass, who won by six lengths Out of the Way came in second by a head over Dancer's Image to take home 20% of the purse, which equaled $30,000. Dancer's Image was again disqualified, here, from third to eighth place for bothering Martin's Jig. =Late three-year-old season= In his next start, Out Of The Way won the Jersey Derby at a mile and one eighth at Garden State Park Racetrack in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, beating Captain's Gig and Iron Ruler. Out Of The Way then beat older horses winning the Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs over Big rock Candy and King's Palace at a mile and a quarter. He followed that up with two runner-up performances to Stage Door Johnny in the mile Saranac Stakes at Saratoga Race Course in upstate New York and in the mile and a quarter Dwyer Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack in South Ozone Park in Queens, New York. He then was out of the money in the Travers Stakes to 14-1 Chompion who upset Forward Pass by one and three-quarter lengths on the sloppy track. His fortunes declined thereafter and was winless at 4 and 5 (8 starts).

Alternatively known as the HTC M4, HTC 601e or HTC 601s,http://www.phonearena.com/phones/HTC-One-mini_id7702 the One Mini is a mid-range variant of HTC's 2013 flagship high-end smartphone, the HTC One. As such, the One Mini was designed to provide an overall experience as similar to its high-end counterpart as possible, while still being competitively priced in comparison to other smartphones in its range. Officially unveiled on 18 July 2013, the One Mini was released in selected markets in August 2013 followed by a global release in September 2013.  Development and release  With the successful launch of the HTC One, HTC made plans to extend its design and technology into a \\"family of devices\\". In particular, HTC North America's president Mike Woodward indicated that consumers had requested a smaller version of the HTC One since its launch. HTC designed the One Mini to provide \\"exactly the same experience\\" as the One with \\"no compromises\\", at a mid-range price. In December 2013, the One Mini was banned from sale in the United Kingdom as the result of a patent infringement lawsuit by Nokia. While the HTC One was also affected by the ruling, its sales ban was stayed by the court pending an appeal; the judge indicated that banning HTC One sales would have a negative effect on the company in preparation for the release of its successor.  Specifications  The HTC One Mini uses an almost identical unibody design to the HTC One, and incorporates hardware features first introduced with the HTC One, such as front-facing dual BoomSound stereo speakers and a 4-megapixel rear-facing camera with an UltraPixel image sensor. Internally, the One Mini features a 1.4 GHz dual-core Snapdragon 400 processor with 1 GB of RAM, a 4.3 inch 720p screen with a pixel density of 341 ppi, lacks an infra-red emitter and NFC, uses a smaller 1800 mAh battery, and contains 16 GB of non-expandable storage. The One Mini ships with a version of Android 4.2.2 and HTC Sense 5.0 nearly identical to that of the HTC One.  Reception  Early reviews of the HTC One Mini were positive and praised HTC's adaptation of the HTC One's premium design to a smaller form factor, and also praised the One Mini's display and overall performance that was almost indistinguishable from that of its high-end counterpart. While PC Magazine experienced issues with image quality on the rear camera on a pre-production model, the One Mini was considered a good competitor to the similar Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini due to the One Mini's higher quality build and high-definition screen.

It was cancelled after Challenger was destroyed earlier that year.  Crew   Mission objectives  The main objective of STS-61-F was to deploy the Ulysses solar probe, which would travel to Jupiter and use it as a gravitational slingshot in order to be placed into polar orbit around the Sun. This mission would have marked the first use of the Centaur-G liquid- fueled payload booster, which would also be used on the subsequent mission to send the Galileo probe in orbit around Jupiter. Due to the use of the Centaur-G and its volatile propellants, this mission was considered to be one of the most dangerous Space Shuttle flights attempted, with Chief Astronaut John Young referring to the two Centaur flights as the \\"Death Star\\" flights. The flight was risky enough that Commander Hauck gave his crewmates an option to leave the crew if they considered the mission to be too unsafe. After the loss of Challenger, most of the crew (sans Bridges, who left NASA in 1986) would fly as the crew of the first post-Challenger mission, STS-26. Bridges was replaced by Dick Covey and a third Mission Specialist (George Nelson) was added to the crew. Ulysses was eventually deployed from Discovery on STS-41, using the solid-fueled Inertial Upper Stage and PAM-S instead of the Centaur, which had been cancelled after the Challenger disaster.
