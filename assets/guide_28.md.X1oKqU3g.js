Plot Jocelin, the Dean of the cathedral, directs the construction of a towering spire funded by his aunt, Lady Alison, a mistress of the former King. The project is carried on against the advice of many, and in particular the warnings of the master builder, Roger Mason. The cathedral has insufficient foundations to support a spire of the magnificence demanded by Jocelin, but he believes he has been chosen by God and given a vision to erect a great spire to exalt the town and to bring its people closer to God. As the novel progresses, Golding explores Jocelin's growing obsession with the completion of the spire, during which he is increasingly afflicted by pain in his spine (which the reader gradually comes to realise is the result of tuberculosis). Jocelin interprets the burning heat in his back as an angel, alternately comforting or punishing him depending on the warmth or pain he feels. Jocelin's obsession blinds him to reality as he neglects his duties as Dean, fails to pray and ignores the people who need him the most. The pit dug to explore the foundations at the Cathedral crossing becomes a place where chthonic forces surge, as the four tower pillars begin to 'sing'. Jocelin also struggles with his unacknowledged lust for Goody Pangall, the wife of the crippled and impotent cathedral servant, Pangall. Jocelin seems at first to see Goody as his daughter in God. However, as the novel progresses, and Goody's husband is tormented and ridiculed as their 'fool' by the bullying workmen, Jocelin becomes tormented by sexual desire, usually triggered by the sight of Goody's red hair. Comparisons between Goody and Rachel, Roger Mason's wife, are made throughout the novel. Jocelin believes Goody sets an example to Rachel, whom he dislikes for her garrulousness and for revealing that her marriage to Roger remains unconsummated. However, Jocelin overestimates Goody's purity, and is horrified when he discovers Goody is embarking upon an affair with Roger Mason. Tortured by envy and guilt, Jocelin finds himself unable to pray. He is repulsed by his sexual thoughts, referred to as \\"the devil\\" during his dreams. The Cathedral building, its ordered life, and the lives of the people around Jocelin are disrupted because of the intractable problems arising from the construction of the spire, but Jocelin continues to drive his dream to its conclusion. His visions and hallucinations, hence his denial of the reality of the situation, mark his descent into irrationality. As the true costs, financial and spiritual, of the endeavour become apparent, the story moves to its tragic conclusion. Pangall disappears; although his fate is never made explicit, it is clear from the clue of the mistletoe that he was a pagan sacrifice buried at the Crossing by the builders to secure their luck against the stupidity of continuing the work. Goody Pangall dies in childbirth, bearing Roger Mason's child. Roger becomes a drunkard and at the end Jocelin dies of his illness, though only after first hearing from his aunt that his appointment was due only to her sexual influence, not to his merits. Before he dies, the phallic imagery of the Spire is displaced by the mysterious symbol of the tree. The spire is incomplete at the end of the story, and there is a growing sense of impending disaster due to the instability of the over-ambitious structure. Characters =Jocelin= Dean Jocelin is the character through whom the novel is presented. Golding utilises the stream of consciousness technique to show his Lear-like descent into madness. The novel charts the destruction of his self-confidence and ambition. As the construction of the spire draws to an end, Jocelin is removed from his position as Dean and his abandonment of his religious duties is denounced by the church Council. Ultimately, he succumbs to his illness which he had personified as his guardian angel. Jocelin may have been named after Josceline de Bohon, Bishop of Salisbury from 1142 to 1184, who is buried in Salisbury Cathedral. =Roger Mason= Roger Mason, a medieval Master Mason is, in direct contrast to Jocelin, physically powerful and a rationalist. He is associated with the imagery of a bull and a stallion. Roger contends with Jocelin, arguing that the cathedral foundations are insufficient to support the spire. He is forced to continue with the project because Jocelin makes it impossible for him to work elsewhere. After the death of Goody, Roger becomes an alcoholic. In a moment of clarity, Jocelin visits Roger and we eventually learn of his suicide attempt. =Rachel= Rachel Mason is Roger's wife. She reveals to Jocelin the reason why they cannot have children as attempts at sex result in fits of giggles. =Pangall= Pangall is the crippled and impotent cathedral servant. He is mocked because of his impotency by the workmen. =Goody= Goody, who acts as an important object of love and lust, ultimately dies while giving birth. Jocelin initially sees her as the perfect woman. =Father Anselm= Anselm is largely critical of the developments concerning the spire, arguing that it is destruction of the church. Jocelin had been prepared to lose his friendship with Anselm as part of the cost of the spire, but we learn by the end of the novel that they appeared not to have had a friendship in the first place. =Father Adam= Father Adam is dubbed by Jocelin as \\"Father Anonymous\\", indicating Jocelin's feelings of superiority. Until the end of the novel, when Father Adam becomes Jocelin's caretaker, he is largely a minor character who is surprised by how Jocelin was never taught to pray, doing his best to help him to heaven. =Lady Alison= A wealthy mistress of the late King, we learn how the money funding the spire was a result of this affair. With the appearance of a \\"tiny woman ‚Äì not much larger than a child\\", she is plump and pale, wearing a black dress, black hair, eyes and make-up, with mainly small features. Her wealth and sexuality is presented through her pearls and perfume and she takes care of her appearance, having smooth skin with fine lines, despite her age. Symbolism =Paganism= The workmen are referred to as \\"an army\\" and Jocelin is confronted numerous times by those who disagree with the disruption they cause. Pangall is their eventual sacrifice, buried \\"beneath the crossways\\" with mistletoe between his ribs. The mistletoe can be viewed as a metaphor in terms of horror and the word ‚Äúobscene‚Äù occurs several times (the Druids' idea that the berries were the semen of the Gods may well contribute to Jocelin's revulsion). \\"The riotous confusion of its branches\\" is alarming as well as is Jocelin's disgust at the berry on his shoe. Golding weaves the mistletoe as a pagan symbol into the naturalistic treatment of it as a sign of a physical threat to the spire. Mistletoe grows on living oak trees ‚Äì if the wood used in the building is unseasoned, the mistletoe will continue to grow on it, revealing a scientifically explicable danger. =Imagery= Goody's red hair can be seen as symbolic for a number of things. Sexual dreams, female sexuality, the devil, lust and desire being some of the possible ideas around it. Constant animal symbolism between Roger and Goody (referred to as a bear, a bull and a stallion or a stag at various points in the novel) are also a possible indication of Jocelin's lack of social awareness, his childlike qualities and his naivety. However, Goody is said to wear a green dress, which contrasts Rachel Mason's red dress ‚Äì the green can perhaps symbolise nature (a recurring paganistic theme in the novel) and the red represents Rachel's undesirable \\"fiery\\" personality. Goody is portrayed as a quiet \\"good woman\\" by Jocelin (whose view is the platform for this novel) and Rachel is not. The irony being that Goody's unfaithfulness is hidden by her hat, and only occasionally do we spot her flame red hair (and infidelity). The spire Jocelin wishes to raise in itself can be seen as a phallic symbol, as Jocelin initially views the model of it as a man lying on his back. Religious imagery is used towards the end of the novel, where Jocelin lies dying. Jocelin declares \\"it's like the apple-tree!\\", making a reference to the Garden of Eden and Humanity's first sin of temptation but also perhaps the pagan ideas that have been constantly threaded into Jocelin's mind as he spends more and more time up in the Spire, raised above the ground (and further away from his church and his role as God's voice on earth). =Spire/Spine= Jocelin's degrading spine can be seen as a micro-macro analogy to the unstable spire. He believes the former manifests as the presence of his angel on his back whereas the latter is the will of God. His narcissism is belied by these failing structures he reinterprets to maintain his worldview.

Notable games Dameo Dameo is a draughts/checkers variant inspired by International draughts and a variant of Turkish draughts called Croda invented by Ljuban Dediƒá. Dameo utilizes all 64 squares of the checkerboard and uses both orthogonal and diagonal movement, although capture is orthogonal only. It also introduces linear movement of men where lines of men of any length may move forward together, similar to Epaminondas or Bushka.

Volunteers from the Union Army, led by civilian scout James J. Andrews, commandeered a train, The General, and took it northward toward Chattanooga, Tennessee, doing as much damage as possible to the vital Western and Atlantic Railroad (W&A;) line from Atlanta to Chattanooga as they went. They were pursued by Confederate forces at first on foot, and later on a succession of locomotives, including The Texas, for . Because the Union men had cut the telegraph wires, the Confederates could not send warnings ahead to forces along the railway. Confederates eventually captured the raiders and quickly executed some as spies, including Andrews; some others were able to flee. Some of the raiders were the first to be awarded the Medal of Honor by the US Congress for their actions. As a civilian, Andrews was not eligible. Military situation The strategic situation in March and April 1862. After the Union capture of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in February, Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston withdrew his forces from central Tennessee to reorganize. As part of this withdrawal, Johnston evacuated Nashville on February 23, surrendering this important industrial center to Union Brig. Gen. Don Carlos Buell's Department of the Ohio army and making it the first Confederate state capital to fall to the Union. After taking Nashville, Buell showed little inclination for further offensive operations, especially towards the pro-Union region of East Tennessee. On March 11, Buell's army was merged into the new Department of the Mississippi under General Henry Halleck. In late March, Halleck ordered Buell southwest to reinforce Grant's army near Pittsburgh Landing on the Tennessee River. Buell departed, leaving a 7,000-man garrison in Nashville along with Maj. Gen. Ormsby Mitchel's 10,000-man 3rd Division. Mitchel had earlier assisted in the capture of Nashville and accepted the surrender of the city. With the withdrawal of both Confederate and Union forces towards western Tennessee, central Tennessee became an economy of force operation. Facing minimal Confederate resistance, Mitchel moved his division southeast out of Nashville on March 18 towards Murfreesboro, arriving on March 20. The first raid: March James J. Andrews James J. Andrews was a Kentucky-born civilian serving as a secret agent and scout in Tennessee, for Major General Don Carlos Buell in the spring of 1862. Sometime before Buell departed Nashville in late March, Andrews presented him with a plan to take eight men to steal a train in Georgia, and drive it north. Buell would later confirm in August 1863 that he authorized this expedition. According to Andrews, a train engineer in Atlanta was willing to defect to the Union with his train, if Andrews could supply a volunteer train crew to assist running the training, tearing up track, and burning bridges. The main target was the railway bridge at Bridgeport, Alabama, although future Andrews Raider William Pittenger believed Andrews also intended to target several other bridges in Georgia and Tennessee. The volunteers for this first raid all came from General Mitchell's division, which was encamped at Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Moving south forty miles on foot to the Confederate railhead at Tullahoma, the raiders were then able to travel by train down to Marietta, Georgia. There, Andrews discovered the engineer had been pressed into service elsewhere. Andrews asked if any of the raiders knew how to operate a locomotive; when none did, he called the raid off Two raiders were also confronted by Confederate soldiers while trying to cut the telegraph lines, but successfully pretended to be overworked wiremen. The raiders then returned north to Union lines, arriving about a week after they had departed. Andrews spent several additional days conducting reconnaissance on the Western and Atlantic Railroad before also departing back north to federal lines. None of the original raiders would volunteer for the second raid. One added that \\"he felt all the time he was in the enemy‚Äôs country as though he had a rope around his neck.\\" Background Major General Ormsby M. Mitchel, commanding Federal troops in middle Tennessee, sought a way to contract or shrink the extent of the northern and western borders of the Confederacy by pushing them permanently away from and out of contact with the Ohio and Mississippi valleys. This could be done by first a southward and then an eastward penetration from the Union base at Nashville, which would seize and sever the Memphis & Charleston Railroad between Memphis and Chattanooga (at the time there were no other railway links between the Mississippi river and the east) and then capture the water and railway junction of Chattanooga, Tennessee, thereby severing the Western Confederacy's contact with both the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys. At the time, the standard means of capturing a city was by encirclement to cut it off from supplies and reinforcements, then would follow artillery bombardment and direct assault by massed infantry. However, Chattanooga's natural water and mountain barriers to its east and south made this nearly impossible with the forces that Mitchel had available. When the Union Army threatened Chattanooga, the Confederate States Army would (from its naturally protected rear) first reinforce Chattanooga's garrison from Atlanta. When sufficient forces had been deployed to Chattanooga to stabilize the situation and hold the line, the Confederates would then launch a counterattack from Chattanooga with the advantage of a local superiority of men and materiel. It was this process that the Andrews raid sought to disrupt. If he could somehow block railroad reinforcement of the city from Atlanta to the southeast, Mitchel could take Chattanooga. The Union Army would then have rail reinforcement and supply lines to its rear, leading west to the Union- held stronghold and supply depot of Nashville, Tennessee. Planning Illustration of nineteen men involved in the Great Locomotive Chase‚Äîseventeen Union soldiers and two railroad employees who chased them 1888 reunion picture of the \\"Raiders\\" at a Grand Army of the Republic encampment at Columbus Ohio James J. Andrews, a civilian scout and part-time spy, proposed a daring raid to Mitchel that would destroy the Western and Atlantic Railroad as a useful reinforcement and supply link to Chattanooga from Atlanta and the rest of Georgia. He recruited the men known later as the Andrews Raiders. These were the civilian William Hunter Campbell and 22 volunteer Union soldiers from three Ohio regiments: the 2nd, 21st, and 33rd Ohio Infantry. Andrews instructed the men to arrive in Marietta, Georgia, by midnight of April 10, but heavy rain caused a one-day delay. They traveled in small parties in civilian attire to avoid arousing suspicion. All but two (Samuel Llewellyn and James Smith) reached the designated rendezvous point at the appointed time. Llewellyn and Smith joined a Confederate artillery unit, as they had been instructed to do in such circumstances. Andrews' proposal was a combined operation; General Mitchel and his forces would first move on Chattanooga; then, the Andrews‚Äô Raid would promptly destroy the rail line between Chattanooga and Atlanta. These essentially simultaneous actions would bring about the capture of Chattanooga. Andrews' Raid was intended to deprive the Confederates of the integrated use of the railways to respond to a Union advance, using their interior lines of communication. The plan was to steal a train on its run north towards Chattanooga, stopping to damage or destroy track, bridges, telegraph wires, and track switches behind them, so as to prevent the Confederate Army from being able to move troops and supplies from Atlanta to Chattanooga. The raiders planned to cross through the Federal siege lines on the outskirts of Chattanooga and rejoin Mitchel's army. Because railway dining cars were not yet in common use, railroad timetables included water, rest, and meal stops. They planned to steal a train just north of Atlanta at Big Shanty, Georgia (now Kennesaw). They chose Big Shanty because they thought Big Shanty did not have a telegraph office and the stop would also be used to refuel and take on water for the steep grade further north. The chase =Big Shanty to Kingston= Conductor William A. Fuller The raid began on April 12, 1862, when the regular morning passenger train from Atlanta, with the locomotive General, stopped for breakfast at the Lacy Hotel. They took the General and the train's three boxcars, which were behind the tender in front of the passenger cars. The passenger cars were left behind. Andrews had previously obtained from the work crew a crowbar for tearing up track. The train's conductor, William Allen Fuller, and two other men, chased the stolen train, first on foot, then by a handcar belonging to a work crew shortly north of Big Shanty. Locomotives of the time normally averaged , with short bursts of speed of about . In addition, the terrain north of Atlanta is very hilly, and the ruling grades are steep. Even today, average speeds are rarely greater than between Chattanooga and Atlanta. Since Andrews intended to stop periodically to perform acts of sabotage, a determined pursuer, even on foot, could conceivably have caught up with the train before it reached Chattanooga. At Etowah, the raiders passed the older and smaller locomotive Yonah which was on a siding that led to the nearby Cooper Iron Works. Andrews considered stopping to attack and destroy that locomotive so it could not be used by pursuers, but given the size of its work party (even though unarmed) relative to the size of the raiding party, he judged that any firefight would be too long and too involved, and would alert nearby troops and civilians. As the raiders had stolen a regularly scheduled train on its route, they needed to keep to that train's timetable. If they reached a siding ahead of schedule, they had to wait there until scheduled southbound trains passed them before they could continue north. Andrews claimed to the station masters he encountered that his train was a special northbound ammunition movement ordered by General Beauregard in support of his operations against the Union forces threatening Chattanooga. This story was sufficient for the isolated station masters Andrews encountered (as he had cut the telegraph wires to the south), but it had no impact upon the train dispatchers and station masters north of him, whose telegraph lines to Chattanooga were working. These dispatchers were following their orders to dispatch and control the special train movements southward at the highest priority. Map of the chase route, with locations of various events marked Thus delayed at the junction town of Kingston, as the first of the southbound freight evacuation trains approached, Andrews inquired of that train's conductor why his train was carrying a red marker flag on its rear car. Andrews was told that Confederate Railway officials in Chattanooga had been notified by Confederate Army officials that Mitchel was approaching Chattanooga from Stevenson, Alabama, intending to either capture or lay siege to the city, and as a result of this warning, the Confederate Military Railways had ordered the Special Freight movements. The red train marker flag on the southbound train meant that there was at least one additional train behind the one which Andrews had just encountered, and that Andrews had no \\"authority for movement\\" until the last train of that sectional movement had passed him. The raiders being delayed at Kingston for over an hour, this gave Fuller all the time he needed to close the distance. =Kingston to Adairsville= The raiders finally pulled out of Kingston only moments before Fuller's arrival. They still managed north of Kingston again to cut the telegraph wire and break a rail. Meanwhile, moving north on the handcar, Fuller had spotted the locomotive Yonah at Etowah and commandeered it, chasing the raiders north all the way to Kingston. There, Fuller switched to the locomotive William R. Smith, which was on a sidetrack leading west to the town of Rome, Georgia and continued north towards Adairsville. Two miles south of Adairsville, however, the pursuers were stopped by the broken track, forcing Fuller and his party to continue the pursuit on foot. Beyond the damaged section, he took command of the southbound locomotive Texas south of Calhoun, where Andrews had passed it, running it backwards. The Texas train crew had been bluffed by Andrews at Calhoun into taking the station siding, thereby allowing the General to continue northward along the single-track main line. Fuller, when he met the Texas, took command of her, picked up eleven Confederate troops at Calhoun, and continued his pursuit, tender-first, northward. =Adairsville to Ringgold= The raiders now never got far ahead of Fuller and never had enough time to stop and take up a rail to halt the Texas. Destroying the railway behind the hijacked train was a slow process. The raiders were too few in number and were too poorly equipped with the proper railway track tools and demolition equipment, and the rain that day made it difficult to burn the bridges. As well, railway officials in Chattanooga had sufficient time to evacuate engines and rolling stock to the south, hauling critical railroad supplies away from the Union threat, so as to prevent their either being captured by General Mitchel or trapped uselessly inside Chattanooga during a Union siege of the city. Andrews' men abandon the General With the Texas still chasing the General tender-first, the two trains steamed through Dalton and Tunnel Hill. The raiders continued to sever the telegraph wires, but they were unable to burn bridges or damage Tunnel Hill. The wood they had hoped to burn was soaked by rain. Just before the raiders cut the telegraph wire north of Dalton, Fuller managed to send off a message from there alerting the authorities in Chattanooga of the approaching stolen engine. Finally, at milepost 116.3, north of Ringgold, Georgia, just 18 miles from Chattanooga, with the locomotive out of fuel, Andrews' men abandoned the General and scattered. Andrews and all of his men were caught within two weeks, including the two who had missed the hijacking. And Mitchel's attack on Chattanooga ultimately failed. Aftermath =Trials and executions= Depiction of the court-martial of one of the raiders in Knoxville Confederate forces charged all the raiders with \\"acts of unlawful belligerency\\"; the civilians were charged as unlawful combatants and spies. All the prisoners were tried in military courts, or courts-martial. Tried in Chattanooga, Andrews was found guilty. He was executed by hanging on June 7 in Atlanta. On June 18, seven others who had been transported to Knoxville and convicted as spies were returned to Atlanta and also hanged; their bodies were buried unceremoniously in an unmarked grave. They were later reburied in Chattanooga National Cemetery. =Escape and exchange= Writing about the exploit, Corporal William Pittenger said that the remaining raiders worried about also being executed. They attempted to escape and eight succeeded. Traveling for hundreds of miles in pairs, they all made it back safely to Union lines, including two who were aided by slaves and Union sympathizers and two who floated down the Chattahoochee River until they were rescued by the Union blockade vessel USS Somerset in the Gulf of Mexico. The remaining six were held as prisoners of war and exchanged for Confederate prisoners on March 17, 1863. Medal of Honor Medal of Honor awarded posthumously in 1866 to raider John Morehead Scott. On March 20, the recently released raiders arrived in Washington DC, and the following day Pittenger wrote a letter to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton detailing their mission to Georgia. On March 24, they were interviewed by Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt, who was able to corroborate details of their mission with testimony from the raiders who had escaped in 1862. On March 25, they were invited to Stanton's office at the Department of War. After a brief conversation, Stanton announced that the raiders would receive the newly approved Medal of Honor. Private Jacob Parrott, who had been physically abused as a prisoner, was awarded the first. The others were Sergeant Elihu H. Mason, Corporals William Pittinger and William H. H. Reddick, and Privates William Bensinger and Robert Buffum. Stanton also offered them all commissions as First Lieutenants. After the ceremony the six raiders were taken to the White House to meet President Abraham Lincoln, which became a tradition for all Medal of Honor recipients. Later, all but three of the other soldiers who had participated in the raid also received the Medal of Honor, with posthumous awards to families for those who had been executed. As civilians, Andrews and Campbell were not eligible. In 2008, the House of Representatives passed a bill which would retroactively award the Medal of Honor to two of the three remaining raiders, Charles Perry Shadrack and George Davenport Wilson. However, as of 2020 it has not been acted upon. All the Medals of Honor presented to the Andrews Raiders used identical text. Citation: Legacy The General, the first film about The Great Locomotive Chase. Both The General and The Texas survived the war and have been preserved in museums. The General is located at the Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History, in Kennesaw, Georgia, close to where the chase began. The Texas is at the Atlanta History Center. The first account of the chase was published a year after the event in 1863 by William Pittenger, one of the Andrews Raiders, under the title of Daring and Suffering. It would be republished in 1881 as Capturing a Locomotive and 1889 as The Great Locomotive Chase. The book was a major success and was widely praised. Two decades later, one newspaper would claim it ‚Äúwas in half the old soldier households in the country.‚Äù In 1926, silent film actor Buster Keaton was given a copy of Pittenger's memoirs, and created the loosely-based silent film comedy The General. In 1956, Walt Disney Productions released the dramatic film The Great Locomotive Chase, also based on Pittenger's memoirs, starring Fess Parker as Andrews and Jeffrey Hunter as Fuller and filmed on the Tallulah Falls Railway in North Carolina. Walt Disney, who personally supervised parts of the production, also rented the 4-4-0 locomotives William Mason to play The General, the Inyo to play The Texas, and Lafayette to play The Yonah. Since at least 1979, the city of Adairsville has held The Great Locomotive Chase Festival, a three-day festival in October which commemorates the event. In 2000, composer Robert W. Smith wrote a concert piece named for and inspired by the incident. In 2019, the raid was featured on Comedy Central show Drunk History in the episode \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\", narrated by Jon Gabrus, with John Francis Daley portraying Andrews and Martin Starr as Fuller. Monument and markers The Ohio monument dedicated to the Andrews Raiders is located at the Chattanooga National Cemetery. There is a scale model of the General on top of the monument, and a brief history of the Great Locomotive Chase. The General is now in the Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History, Kennesaw, Georgia, while the Texas is on display at the Atlanta History Center. One marker indicates where the chase began, near the Big Shanty Museum (now known as Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History) in Kennesaw, while another shows where the chase ended at Milepost 116.3, north of Ringgold -- not far from the recently restored depot at Milepost 114.5. Historic sites along the 1862 chase route include the following: *marker near Big Shanty Museum *Big Shanty Village Historic District *Camp McDonald *Acworth Downtown Historic District *Tarleton Moore House *Grand Theater (Cartersville, Georgia) *Old Bartow County Courthouse, now the Bartow History Museum, built so close to the railroad that court was interrupted when any train passed, not built until 1869 *Adairsville Historic District *the Calhoun Depot, built in 1852‚Äì53, at Calhoun, 10 miles north of Adairsville. with *Calhoun Downtown Historic District *William Taylor House (Resaca, Georgia), associated with northern Georgia soldiers who fought for the Union in the Civil War, though house not built until 1913 *Masonic Lodge No. 238, not built until 1915 *Dalton Commercial Historic District *Western and Atlantic Depot, Dalton, Georgia *Crown Mill Historic District *Western and Atlantic Railroad Tunnel at Tunnel Hill *Ringgold Gap Battlefield, gap between White Oak Mountain and Taylor Ridge through which railway runs, site of November 1863 battle protecting Confederate retreat after Battle of Missionary Ridge at Chattanooga *Ringgold Depot *Ringgold Commercial Historic District *marker at milepost 116.3 Kennesaw House, 21 Depot St. (c.1845), a hotel on the L&N; railway in Marietta, Georgia, is a contributing building in the Northwest Marietta Historic District.

It is famous for Dunvegan Castle, seat of the chief of Clan MacLeod. Dunvegan is within the parish of Duirinish. Name In The Norse Influence on Gaelic Scotland (1910), George Henderson suggests that the name D√πn Bheagain derives from Old Gaelic D√πn Bhecc√°in ([the] fort of Becc√°n), Becc√°n being a Gaelic personal name. D√πn Bheagain would not mean 'little fort' as this would be D√πn Beag in Gaelic. Geography Dunvegan Castle Dunvegan sits on the shores of the large Loch Dunvegan, and the Old School Restaurant in the village is noted for its fish, caught freshly from the loch itself. Dunvegan is situated at the junction of the A850, and the A863. The B884 road also has a junction with the A863, at the eastern end of Dunvegan. Demography Dunvegan's permanent population is declining. However, numbers staying in the area during holidays have increased dramatically over the years since 2001. Economy Tourist information used to be situated in the parade of shops at Lochside, but is now available on a seasonal basis at Dunvegan Castle's St Kilda Shop.

A student publication is a media outlet such as a newspaper, magazine, television show, or radio station produced by students at an educational institution. These publications typically cover local and school related news, but they may also report on national or international news as well. Most student publications are either part of a curricular class or run as an extracurricular activity. Student publications serve as both a platform for community discussion and a place for those interested in journalism to develop their skills. These publications report news, publish opinions of students and faculty, and may run advertisements catered to the student body. Besides these purposes, student publications also serve as a watchdog to uncover problems at the school. The majority of student publications are funded through their educational institution. Some funds may be generated through sales and advertisements, but the majority usually comes from the school itself. Because of this, educational institutions have specific way in which they can influence the publications through funding.  Online student publications  Due to the rise in adoption of Internet accessible devices such as computers and smartphones, many high schools and colleges have begun offering online editions of their publications in addition to printed copies. (The very first student newspaper in the United States to completely abandon its printed issues in favor of a website was The Campus Lantern at Eastern Connecticut State University, doing so in the 2000s; however paper issues of The Lantern have since been brought back.) Due to publishing content online student publications are now able to reach a much wider audience than before. With many student publications moving to online, content is more accessible to the student body and production of the content is easier and cheaper. As printed student publications become more and more scarce and student publications move online to best fit the news needs of today's students, student newspapers will run into several issues. One of these issues is the increase in demand for new content. While an update once a day or even once a week was once acceptable for a student publication, real time information resources will soon be demanded by students who grew up with constant updates of news coverage. This shift in content demand will require more effort and more time by the student newspaper staff. One of these issues is what is called the \\"daily me.\\" Coined by Cass Sunstein in his book Republic.com, the \\"daily me\\" is the current trend of online readers looking for personalized information providers. In this way the reader deals with only the subjects they wish to deal with. In this way readers are not inconvenienced by material they have no interest in and can personalize an information product themselves, providing added value to both themselves and the provider. However, some believe this trend may not be the best for society, who is now faced with a public that chooses how well to be informed. On a campus paper, this trend will likely manifest itself in the increased number of \\"hits\\" to the common \\"sports\\" and \\"opinion\\" sections of the paper, while hard news sections go un-noticed. This new type of print culture could possibly result in drastic formatting and content changes for student newspapers.  2006 cartoon controversies  Gair rhydd, the student paper at Cardiff University, courted controversy when, on February 4, 2006, it reproduced the cartoons, originally printed in Jyllands-Posten, depicting Muhammad. The issue was withdrawn from publication within a day of being released, the editor and two other student journalists were suspended, and a public apology was published in the next issue. In the same month, two editors of the Daily Illini, the independent student newspaper of the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, were suspended after deciding to publish six of the twelve cartoons. However, student publications took a lead role in reprinting the Muhammad cartoons, often accompanying them with explanatory editorials. No fewer than 16 student newspapers and magazines in the United States, and a handful in other countries, ran one or more of the caricatures. Student press in Australia University student newspapers in the Australia are usually independent of university administration yet are connected with or run by the student representative organisation operating at the campus. Editors tend to be elected by the student body on a separate ticket to other student representatives and are paid an honorarium, although some student organisations have been known to employ unelected staff to coordinate the production of the newspaper (an example of this is the national Student View newspaper). =Controversy surrounding Australian student press= Australian student newspapers have courted controversy since their inception. One of the more notorious of these controversies involved the publication of an article which allegedly incited readers to shoplift. The July edition of the magazine was banned by the Office of Film and Literature Classication following a campaign by conservative talkback radio hosts and other media to have the material banned. The four editors of the July 1995 edition of La Trobe University student magazine Rabelais were subsequently charged with publishing, distributing and depositing an objectionable publication. An objectional publication was defined in this case, as one that incites criminal activity.Haddad, Nadya. \\"Rabble-rousing and Rabelais: fear of lawless shoplifting students\\" (1998) 8(2) Polemic, 32 at 33. The editors lodged an appeal, which led to a protracted four-year court case. The appeal was eventually defeated by the full bench of the Federal Court, who refused the editors application to appeal to the High Court of Australia.Federal Court of Australia, Annual report 1997‚Äì1998, Chapter 2, The Work of the Court, 2.2 Decisions of Interest The charges were eventually dropped in March 1999. Student press in Canada Many student newspapers in Canada are independent from their universities and student unions. Such autonomous papers are funded by student fees won by referendums, as well as advertising, and are run by their staffs, with no faculty input. About 55 of Canada's student newspapers belong to a co-operative and newswire service called the Canadian University Press, which holds conferences, has correspondents across the country, is run democratically by its member papers, and fosters a sense of community among Canadian student journalists. The oldest continually published student newspapers in Canada are The Varsity (1880), The Queen's Journal (1873), and The Dalhousie Gazette (1868). The oldest student publication in Canada is The Brunswickan, which was founded in 1867 as a monthly but then switched to a weekly newspaper. The only Canadian student newspaper that continues to print on a daily schedule is The Gazette at the University of Western Ontario. Student press in Ireland Student publications are produced at Ireland's universities and Institutes of Technology as well as to a lesser extent at Colleges of Further Education. These publications include The College Tribune and The University Observer at University College Dublin, Trinity News and The University Times at Trinity College Dublin, The College View based at Dublin City University and Sin Newspaper at NUI Galway. Other publications include The Edition (stylised as the eDITion), at Dublin Institute of Technology and the UCC Express and Motley Magazine at University College Cork. Each publication reports on affairs at its host university as well as on local, national and international news of relevance to students and many student journalists have gone on to work in Ireland's national press. All student publications in Ireland are funded by or linked to their host university or its students' union, with the exception of UCD's College Tribune which operates independently. Irish student publications are invited each year to enter the national Student Media Awards, run by a Dublin-based marketing firm Oxygen.ie under various categories. Student press in Korea Almost every university in Korea runs a student based press. Although many of these press are funded by the school, the students press has a significant amount of say amongst the student body. Student press in the Philippines The College Editorial Guild of the Philippines or (CEGP) is the oldest and broadest intercollegiate alliance of student publications in the Asia-Pacific. Since its foundation, the Guild has remained steadfast in its commitment to uphold freedom of expression, press freedom and students' democratic rights. This dedication is what continues to unite and consolidate CEGP's more than 750 member publications from different schools nationwide or worldwide. See also List of student newspapers Student press in the United Kingdom Student newspapers in the UK are often given a constitutionally guaranteed editorial independence from the universities and student unions whose students they represent, although the majority are financially dependent on their Students' Union. The most successful (in terms of student media awards) include: Orbital Magazine (Royal Holloway, University of London), The Knowledge (University of Plymouth), Nouse (University of York), York Vision (University of York), Impact (University of Nottingham), The Epinal (Loughborough University), Felix (Imperial College), Cherwell, The Oxford Student (University of Oxford), The Badger (University of Sussex), gair rhydd (Cardiff University), The Beaver (London School of Economics), Glasgow University Guardian (Glasgow University), The Boar (University of Warwick), Leeds Student (University of Leeds), Student (University of Edinburgh), Forge Press (University of Sheffield), The Courier (University of Newcastle), The Saint (University of St Andrews), Varsity, The Cambridge Student, The Tab (University of Cambridge), Epigram (University of Bristol), The Ripple (newspaper) (University of Leicester), Exepos√© (University of Exeter) Spark* (University of Reading), The Gaudie (University of Aberdeen)and LeNurb (Brunel University). Examples of British student newspapers that are financially as well as editorially independent from their respective student unions are Cherwell, Varsity, The Tab, The Saint, The Epinal, The Linc (University of Lincoln), Palatinate (Durham University), The Founder (Royal Holloway) Milk Magazine (Bath Spa University), The Gown (Queen's University, Belfast) and The Manchester Magazine (University of Manchester). Since they are not part of their Students' Union at all, their independence is given a stronger guarantee than other papers who rely on their unions for funding and consequently cover stories with that in mind. In 2003, The National Student, the UK's first independent national student newspaper was launched. Scotcampus a similar publication based in Scotland was founded in 2001. In 2009, The Student Journals was founded as an independent online magazine for students, but started allowing international writers one year after launch. Student press in the United States Front page of the first edition of The Daily Tar Heel a student newspaper of University of North Carolina from 1892. =Case law= Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District Tinker v. Des Moines concerns a group of students who wanted to wear black armbands to school in 1965 to protest United States involvement in Vietnam. After school officials heard about the planned silent protest, they suspended the students involved. A few of the students involved sued and the Supreme Court sided with the students, saying that provided that these speech acts did not distract themselves or others from academic work, the real purpose of the school, then students were free to wear and say want they liked in school. This is considered the benchmark case in issues of student free speech and contains the famous phrase \\"students do not shed their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse gate.\\"Tinker v. Des Moines at ACLU.org Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier, heard by the United States Supreme Court in 1987 concerned a public school newspaper that attempted to print two controversial stories about issues of teen pregnancy and divorced families. It was the custom of the principal to look over the proposed paper before publication. With little time left before the publication deadline, the principal decided that the two stories, though names had been changed to protect the stories' subjects, were inappropriate for the paper's younger readers; under direction of the principal, the paper was printed without the offending stories. The students filed suit, but the Supreme Court stood by the principal's ruling, that, because of time constraints, the only proper course of action was to not print the stories. It was decided that the students' First Amendment rights had not been infringed. This case is often cited by high schools and universities to support the custom of prior review.Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier, Freedom of Speech in the United States, BC.edu Kincaid v. Gibson Interaction of court rulings Hazelwood and Tinker offer conflicting versions of student free expression. Student-directed publications may indeed be considered open or limited public forums for student expression, offering students freedom of expression under both Hazelwood and Tinker. Hazelwood, for example, does not say administrators must review or censor their papers before publication. In fact, journalism education organizations, like the Journalism Education Association, argue that prior review has no legitimate educational merit and is only a tool leading to censorship. Under certain limited conditions and situations presented by Hazelwood, school administrators may be permitted prior review of (mostly high school) student publications. Until June 2005, the Hazelwood standard was not considered to apply to public college and university newspapers, a decision most recently affirmed in the 2001 appeals court decision in Kincaid v. Gibson. However, in June 2005, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, in Hosty v. Carter, that the Hazelwood standard could apply to student publications that were not \\"designated public forums,\\" and in February 2006 the Supreme Court declined to hear the students' appeal. At this time, the Hosty decision applies only in the states of Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin. In response to the Kincaid decision, the California State Legislature passed AB 2581, which extended existing state- level statutory protection of high school student journalists to college and university students. The bill was signed into law by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and took effect on January 1, 2007. Controversy over alleged censorship actions has led some student newspapers to become independent organizations, such as The Exponent of Purdue University in 1969, The Daily Californian of the University of California, Berkeley in 1971, The Daily Orange of Syracuse University in 1971, The Independent Florida Alligator of the University of Florida in 1973, The Cavalier Daily of the University of Virginia in 1979, The Paisano of the University of Texas at San Antonio in 1981, and most recently The Mountaineer Jeffersonian of West Virginia University in 2008. Some states have laws which enhance the U.S. Constitution in protecting student expression documented by the Student Press Law Center. John Silber and university newspapers University administrations have learned to get around constitutional protections and effectively diminish critical student newspapers by following the example of former Boston University President John Silber, who on the advice of Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz, eliminated all funding for student newspapers in the 1970s in an attempt to suppress on-campus criticism. Silber's policy went so far as to ban student organizations funded by the university from placing advertisements in the student press. With his hands-off policy, Silber was able to eliminate the independence of The Daily News and financially crippled the more-radical b.u. exposure. The exposure sued Silber and the university for infringement of their First Amendment rights, but the courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts eventually dismissed their case. =Issues of diversity in student newspapers= Studies by the Journal of Blacks in Higher Education (JBHE) focusing on African American students have found that as few as 2.6% of editors of all student newspapers are of African-American descent, with other minorities showing similar trending. These numbers are not much higher at schools with credited journalism schools. In these institutions, only 4.4% of editors are of African American descent. Both of these percentages are significantly below the percentage of population African- Americans make up in the total United States. Such skewed demographics in these publications could result in newspapers that only reflect the outlooks and values of a particular segment of the student population. The JBHE does not suggest any type of affirmative action program for student publications at this point in time.

Types Bago√≥ng is usually made from a variety of fish species, including the following: Bago√≥ng alam√°ng is made by fermenting krill in salt Bagoong alamang sauteed with tomatoes, garlic, and onion with pork chicharon *Anchovies - known as dilis, monamon, bolinaw, or gurayan (Stolephrus and Encrasicholina species) *Round scads - known as galungg√≥ng or tamodios (Decapterus species) *Bonnetmouths (redbait or rubyfish) - known as terong (Emmelichthys nitidus, Emmelichthys struhsakeri, and Plagiogeneion rubiginosum) *Ponyfish - known as saps√°p (Leiognathus, Photopectoralis, and Equulites species) *Rabbitfish - known as padas (Siganus species) *Bar-eyed gobies - known as ipon (Glossogobius giuris) *Herrings - Clupeoides lila *Silver perch - known as ayungin (Leiopotherapon plumbeus) Bago√≥ng made from fish is encompassed by the term bago√≥ng isd√¢ (lit. \\"fish bagoong\\") in Luzon and northern parts of the Visayas. They can be distinguished further by the type of fish they are made of. Those made from anchovies are generally known as bagoong monamon or bagoong dilis and those from bonnetmouths as bagoong terong. In the southern Visayas and Mindanao, fish bagoong made from anchovies is known as guinamos (also spelled ginamos). Larger fermented fish are known as tinabal. Bagoong can also be made from krill. This type of bagoong is known as bagoong alamang. It is called uyap or alamang in the southern Philippines, aramang in Ilocos and parts of Northern Luzon, and ginamos or dayok in western Visayas. In rarer instances, it can also be made from oysters, clams, and fish and shrimp roe. A kind of bagoong made in the town of Balayan, Batangas is also known as bagoong Balayan. Preparation Guinamos (fish bagoong) with tomatoes and onions from Cebu =Bagoong isda and bagoong alamang= Bagoong isda is prepared by mixing salt and fish usually by volume; mixture proportions are proprietary depending on the manufacturer. The salt and fish are mixed uniformly, usually by hand. The mixture is kept inside large earthen fermentation jars (known as tapayan in Tagalog and Visayan languages, and burnay in Ilocano). It is covered, to keep flies away, and left to ferment for 30‚Äì90 days with occasional stirring to make sure the salt is spread evenly. The mixture can significantly expand during the process. The preparation of bagoong alamang (shrimp or krill paste) is similar, with krill cleaned thoroughly and washed in weak brine solution (10%). As in fish bagoong, the shrimp are then mixed with salt in a 25% salt to 75% shrimp ratio by weight. The products of the fermentation process are usually pale gray to white in color. To obtain the characteristic red or pink color of some bagoong, a kind of food coloring known as angkak is added. Angkak is made from rice inoculated with a species of red mold (Monascus purpureus). High-quality salt with little mineral impurities is preferred. High metallic content in the salt used can often result in darker colors to the resulting bagoong and a less agreeable undertaste. Likewise, oversalting and undersalting also has a significant impact on the rate and quality of fermentation due to their effects on the bacteria involved in the process. Some manufacturers grind the fermented product finely and sell the resulting mixture as fish paste. Bagoong alamang from Malolos, Bulacan =Pat√≠s= Pat√≠s or fish sauce is a byproduct of the fermentation process. It is a clear, yellowish liquid that floats above the fermented mixture, and has a sharp salty or cheese-like flavor. Sauces similar to pat√≠s include n∆∞·ªõc m·∫Øm in Vietnam, nam pha (‡∫ô‡ªâ‡∫≥‡∫õ‡∫≤) in Laos, hom ha in China, nam pla in Thailand, shitsuru in Japan and saeu chot in Korea, as well as the garum of ancient Greece and the Roman empire. Indonesia has an East Javanese condiment called petis (pronounced similar to pat√≠s in Filipino): a paste made from the caramelized fermented reduction of pindang broth, a spicy and tangy herbal soup typically containing fish or shrimp (occasionally, beef or eggs). To obtain pat√≠s, fermentation is longer, usually taking six months to a year. During the longer fermentation processes, the fish or shrimp constituents disintegrate further, producing a clear yellowish liquid on top of the mixture due to hydrolysis. This is the patis; it can be harvested once it has developed its characteristic smell. It is drained, pasteurized, and bottled separately, while the residue is turned into bagoong. If the residual solids are not moist enough, brine is usually added. The rate of fermentation can vary depending on the pH levels of the mixture and the temperature. Exposure to sunlight can also reduce the amount of time required to two months.  Reputation  Over the centuries, western unfamiliarity with bagoong has given it a reputation as an \\"exotic\\" dish, portrayed in a positive or negative light depending on the point of view of the writer. For example, one early description was Spanish colonial official Antonio de Morga, whose book Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas (Events in the Philippine Isles) included a description of bagoong as \\"fish which ... has started to rot and stink.\\" This later prompted preeminent Philippine nationalist Jose Rizal to denounce the descriptions in his 1890 annotation, saying: See also *Bagoong fried rice *Bagoong monamon *Bagoong terong *Balao-balao *Binagoongan *Burong isda *Fish sauce *Garum *List of fermented foods *List of fish sauces *Shrimp paste *Taba ng talangka *Palapa References * Bagoong: Good for the brain * Filipino American, Fred Cordova, Filipinos: Forgotten Asian Americans (Dubuque, IA: Kendall/ Hunt, 1983) * Philippines Deep Sea Fishing and Refrigeration * Foods Used by Filipinos in Hawaii, Bulletin 98 - Hawaii Agricultural Experiment Station, 1946 Category:Fish sauces Category:Fermented fish Category:Philippine condiments Category:Anchovy dishes ","title":"Bagoong"},{"id":"1168980","text":"Isabel Gilberto de Oliveira (born May 12, 1966), known as Bebel Gilberto, is a Brazilian-American popular singer often associated with bossa nova. She is the daughter of Jo√£o Gilberto and singer Mi√∫cha. Her uncle is singer/composer Chico Buarque. Gilberto has been performing since her youth in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Early life Gilberto was born in New York City to Brazilian parents, bossa nova pioneer Jo√£o Gilberto and singer Mi√∫cha, who were briefly living in the city at the time of her birth. She often traveled with her father when he recorded albums in different countries; she lived in Mexico at age three and moved to Rio de Janeiro at age five. Gilberto's parents separated when she was seven, and she spent her time between Rio de Janeiro with her mother and New York with her father. Gilberto recalls that her childhood was \\"music nonstop\\"; when reflecting on her father's influence, Gilberto states, \\"He taught me to be a perfectionist. But my mother taught me how to lose it. And you can hear it in my music today, I think.\\" She grew acquainted with popular artists such as Caetano Veloso, David Byrne, and Stan Getz, who often visited her father's home to collaborate. She began singing with her mother at a young age and participated in professional musicals such as Saltimbancos and Pirlimpimpim. At the age of seven, she made her recording debut on her mother's first solo album, Mi√∫cha & Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim (1977). Two years later, she performed at Carnegie Hall with her mother and Stan Getz. Career =Beginnings: 1986‚Äì1999= Gilberto's professional solo debut came in 1986 with a self-titled EP released by WEA which included \\"Preciso dizer que te amo\\", a partnership with Cazuza and D√©, when both were in the Bar√£o Vermelho band. In 1991, Gilberto moved to Manhattan, where she continues to live, but shares her time between the U.S. and Brazil. Gilberto was a great friend of Cazuza and composed several songs with him in addition to \\"Eu preciso dizer que te amo\\", including \\"Amigos de Bar\\", \\"Mais Feliz\\", and \\"Mulher sem Raz√£o\\". Gilberto next participated in the project Red Hot + Rio, joining major music stars such as Everything but the Girl, Maxwell, George Michael, and others for the benefit CD recording. She also collaborated on Towa Tei's CD Future Listening!, singing on the hits \\"Technova\\" and \\"Batucada,\\" and also participated in Peeping Tom with Mike Patton (lead singer of Faith No More), singing \\"Caipirinha\\". =Tanto Tempo, Bebel Gilberto, and Momento: 2000‚Äì2007= Tanto Tempo, an electronic bossa nova album released in 2000, was popular at clubs around the world and positioned Gilberto as one of the best-selling Brazilian artists in the U.S. since the 1960s. With her second album, Bebel Gilberto (2004), she refined her sound to create an acoustic lounge style that showcased her strengths as a Brazilian composer. With Momento (2007), her third album in seven years, she wanted to do a fusion of both. Mixing the taste of Rio's Orquestra Imperial with the melting pot of New York's Brazilian Girls, and following the direction of the English producer Guy Sigsworth (Madonna's partner in \\"What It Feels Like for a Girl\\"), Momento reaffirmed the international character of Gilberto's music. In 2007, she was a judge for the 6th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers. =All in One: 2009‚Äìpresent= Gilberto recorded her fourth studio album, All in One, in New York, Jamaica, and the Brazilian state of Bahia. It was released worldwide on September 29, 2009 on the American jazz label Verve, and was released in Brazil by Universal Music. It is the least electronic-infused of her albums, and brings to the forefront more of Gilberto's personality and love for organic styles. All in One had a team of accomplished producers including Mark Ronson (Amy Winehouse, Lily Allen), John King (Dust Brothers, Beck), Daniel Jobim, Carlinhos Brown, Didi Gutman (Brazilian Girls) and Mario Caldato Jr (Beastie Boys, Bj√∂rk, Jack Johnson). Gilberto also provided the voice of the bird Eva in the animated film Rio (2011), an experience she called \\"amazing\\". Since the launch of Tanto Tempo in 2000, she has sold over 2.5 million records and has been featured on seven film soundtracks including Next Stop Wonderland, Bubble, Closer and most recently 2010's Eat Pray Love and 2011's Rio; and seven TV series including Sex and the City, Six Feet Under, and Nip/Tuck. In 2011, she contributed a track entitled \\"Acabou Chorare\\" to the Red Hot Organization's most recent charitable album Red Hot+Rio 2. The album is a follow-up to the 1996 Red Hot+Rio. Proceeds from the sales will be donated to raise awareness and money to fight AIDS/HIV and related health and social issues. In 2015, her song \\"Tudo\\" was nominated for the 16th Latin Grammy Awards in the Best Brazilian Song category.

History The words \\"shawl\\" and \\"pashmina\\" come from Kashmir. Sources report cashmere crafts were introduced by Sayeed Ali Hamadani, when in the 14th century he came to Ladakh. He found that the Ladakhi Kashmiri goats produced soft wool. He took some of this goat wool and made socks which he gave as a gift to the king of Kashmir, Sultan Qutabdin. Afterwards, Hamadani suggested to the king that they start a shawl weaving industry in Kashmir using this wool. That is how pashmina shawls began.Shiraz number shah Hamdan number 2004 Kashmir Academy Art and culture (edit.), Jeelani Allie kashmiri The United Nations agency UNESCO reported in 2014 that Ali Hamadani was one of the principal historical figures who shaped the culture of Kashmir, both architecturally and through the flourishing of arts and crafts, and hence economy, in Kashmir. The skills and knowledge that he brought to Kashmir gave rise to an entire industry. Kashmir was a pivotal point through which the wealth, knowledge, and products of ancient India passed to the world. Perhaps the most widely known woven textiles are the famed Kashmir shawls. The Kanikar, for instance, has intricately woven designs that are formalized imitations of Nature. The Chennai leaf (plane tree leaf), apple and cherry blossoms, the rose and tulip, the almond and pear, the nightingale‚Äîthese are done in deep mellow tones of maroon, dark red, gold yellow and browns. Yet another type of Kashmir shawl is the Jamiavr, which is a brocaded woollen fabric sometimes in pure wool and sometimes with a little cotton added. Brooklyn Museum - Do√±a Josefa de la Cotera y Calvo de la Puerta - Mexican overall The floral design appears in a heavy, close embroidery-like weave in dull silk or soft pashmina (Persian, meaning \\"woolen\\"), and usually comprises small or large flowers delicately sprayed and combined; some shawls have net- like patterns with floral ensemble motifs in them. Still another type of Kashmir shawl is the double-sided Dourukha (Persian, meaning \\"having two faces\\"), a woven shawl that is so done as to produce the same effect on both sides. This is a unique piece of craftsmanship, in which a multi-coloured schematic pattern is woven all over the surface, and after the shawl is completed, the rafugar (expert embroiderer) works the outlines of the motifs in darker shades to bring into relief the beauty of design. This attractive mode of craftsmanship not only produces a shawl which is reversible because of the perfect workmanship on both sides, but it combines the crafts of both weaving and embroidery and religious beliefs expressed in different shawls. The most expensive shawls, called shahtoosh, are made from the under-fleece of the Tibetan antelope or Chiru. These shawls are so fine that even a very tightly woven shawl can be easily pulled through a small finger ring. The naksha, a Persian device like the Jacquard loom invented centuries later, enabled Indian weavers to create sinuous floral patterns and creeper designs in brocade to rival any painted by a brush. The Kashmir shawl that evolved from this expertise in its heyday had greater fame than any other Indian textile. Always a luxury commodity, the intricate, tapestry-woven, fine wool shawl had become a fashionable wrap for the ladies of the English and French elite by the 18th century. Supply fell short of demand and manufacturers pressed to produce more, created convincing embroidered versions of the woven shawls that could be produced in half the time. As early as 1803, Kashmiri needlework production was established to increase and hasten output of these shawls, which had been imitated in England since 1784 and even in France. By 1870, the advent of the Jacquard loom in Europe destroyed the exclusivity of the original Kashmir shawl, which began to be produced in Paisley, Scotland. Even the characteristic Kashmiri motif, the mango-shape, began to be known simply as the paisley. Somali women wearing traditional shawls. The paisley motif is so ubiquitous to Indian fabrics that it is hard to realize that it is only about 250 years old. It evolved from 1600s floral and tree-of-life designs that were created in expensive, tapestry-woven Mughal textiles. The design in India originated from Persian motif called butta-jeghgha which represents a stylized cypress tree, the symbol of Iranians. Early designs depicted single plants with large flowers and thin wavy stems, small leaves and roots. As the designs became denser over time, more flowers and leaves were compacted within the shape of the tree, or issuing from vases or a pair of leaves. By the late 18th century, the archetypal curved point at the top of an elliptical outline had evolved. The elaborate paisley created on Kashmir shawls became the vogue in Europe for over a century, and it was imitations of these shawls woven in factories at Paisley, Scotland, that gave it the name paisley still commonly used in the United States and Europe. In the late 18th century and 19th century, the paisley became an important motif in a wide range of Indian textiles, perhaps because it was associated with the Mughal court. It also caught the attention of poorer and non-Muslim Indians because it resembles a mango. Cashmere Shawl is an evergreen shawl in all over india and in the world. \\"Rural Indians called an aam or mango a symbol of fertility\\". The first shawls, or \\"shals\\", were used in Assyrian times; later they went into widespread use in the Middle East.Ancient Egyptian, Assyrian, and Persian costumes and decorations, p.41. Shawls were also part of the traditional male costume in Kashmir. They were woven in extremely fine woollen twill, some such as the Orenburg shawl, were even said to be as fine as the Shatoosh. They could be in one colour only, woven in different colours (called tilikar), ornately woven or embroidered (called ameli). Ethiopian model and filmmaker Amleset Muchie wearing a traditional shawl. Kashmiri shawls were high-fashion garments in Western Europe in the early- to mid-19th century. Paisley shawls, imitation Kashmiri shawls woven in Paisley, Renfrewshire, are the origin of the name of the traditional paisley pattern. Shawls were also manufactured in the city of Norwich, Norfolk from the late 18th century (and some two decades before Paisley) until about the 1870s. Silk shawls with fringes, made in China, were available by the first decade of the 19th century. Ones with embroidery and fringes were available in Europe and the Americas by 1820. These were called China cr√™pe shawls or China shawls, and in Spain mantones de Manila because they were shipped to Spain from China via the port of Manila. The importance of these shawls in fashionable women's wardrobes declined between 1865 and 1870 in Western culture. However, they became part of folk dress in a number of places including Germany, the Near East, various parts of Latin America, and Spain where they became a part of Romani (gitana) dress especially in Andalusia and Madrid. These embroidered items were revived in the 1920s under the name of Spanish shawls. Their use as part of the costume of the lead in the opera Carmen contributed to the association of the shawls with Spain rather than China. Some cultures incorporate shawls of various types into their national folk dress, mainly because the relatively unstructured shawls were much more commonly used in earlier times. Uses Hajong Argon shawl. The wearing of shawls in early 19th-century France. Shawls are used in order to keep warm, to complement a costume, and for symbolic reasons. One famous type of shawl is the tallit, worn by Jewish men during prayers and ceremonies. Today, shawls are worn for added warmth (and fashion) at outdoor or indoor evening affairs, where the temperature is warm enough for men in suits, but not for women in dresses and where a jacket might be inappropriate. Types =The Kashmir shawls= The Kashmir shawl is a type of shawl distinctive for its Kashmiri weave, and traditionally made of shahtoosh or pashmina wool. Known for its warmth, light weight and characteristic buta design, the Kashmir shawl was originally used by Mughal royalty and nobility. In the late 18th century, it arrived in Europe, where its use by Queen Victoria and Empress Jos√©phine popularised it as a symbol of exotic luxury and status. It became a toponym for the Kashmir region itself (as cashmere), inspiring mass-produced imitation industries in India and Europe, and popularising the buta, today known as the Paisley motif. \\"The shawls made in Kashmir occupy a pre-eminent place among textile products; and it is to them and to their imitations from Western looms that specific importance attaches. The Kashmir shawl is characterized by the elaboration of its design, in which the \\"cone\\" pattern is a prominent feature, and by the glowing harmony, brilliance, depth, and enduring qualities of its colours. The basis of these excellences is found in the very fine, soft, short, flossy under-wool, called pashm or pashmina, found on the shawl-goat, a variety of Capra hircus inhabiting the elevated regions of Tibet. There are several varieties of pashm, but the finest is a strict monopoly of the maharaja of Kashmir. Inferior pashm and Kerman wool ‚Äî a fine soft Persian sheep's wool ‚Äî are used for shawl weaving at Amritsar and other places in the Punjab, where colonies of Kashmiri weavers are established. Of shawls, apart from shape and pattern, there are only two principal classes: (1) loom-woven shawls called tiliwalla, tilikar or kani kar ‚Äî sometimes woven in one piece, but more often in small segments which are sewn together with such precision that the sewing is quite imperceptible; and (2) embroidered shawls ‚Äî amlikar ‚Äî in which over a ground of plain pashmina is worked by needle a minute and elaborate pattern.\\" from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1911 =Pashmina or kar Amir= Shawl weavers in Kashmir circa 1903. The majority of the woollen fabrics of Kashmir, and particularly the best quality shawls, were and are still made of Pashm or Pashmina, which is the wool of Capra hircus, a species of the wild Asian mountain goat. Hence the shawls came to be called Pashmina. The fine fleece used for the shawls is that which grows under the rough, woolly, outer coat of the animal; that from the under-belly, which is shed on the approach of hot weather. Materials of an inferior grade were of the wool of the wild Himalayan mountain sheep or the Himalayan ibex. However, the best fleece wool is soft, silky and warm is of the wild goats, and painstakingly gathered from shrubs and rough rocks against which the animals rub off their fleece on the approach of summer. This was undoubtedly the soft fleece wool from which were made the famous and much coveted 'ring shawls' in Mughal times. Unfortunately very inferior and second rate wool taken from domesticated sheep and goats provide most of the wool used today on the looms of Kashmir. The needle-worked Amlikar or Amli, made from Pashmina wool is a shawl embroidered almost all over with the needle on a plain woven ground. The colours most commonly seen on pashmina shawls are yellow, white, black, blue, green, purple, crimson and scarlet. The design motifs are usually formalised imitations of nature like the leaf, flower and tree designs mentioned above; they are always done in rich colours. The embroidery stitch employed is rather like the parallel darning stitch and is rarely allowed to penetrate the entire fabric. The outlines of the design are further touched up and emphasized with silk or woollen thread of different colours run round the finer details; the stitch used for this is at an angle overlapping darn stitch, all the stitches used are so minute and fine that individually they can be seen with the unaided eye only with difficulty. When Pashmina wool is used for the embroidery work, it is made to blend so intimately with the texture of the basic shawl material that it would be difficult to insert even a fine needle between the embroidery stitches and the basic fabric. =Do-Shalla= The Emperor Akbar was a great admirer of the shawls of Kashmir. It was he who began the fashion of wearing them in duplicate, sewn back to back, so that the under surfaces of the shawls were never seen. During that time the most desired shawls were those worked in gold and silver thread or shawls with border ornamented with fringes of gold, silver and silk thread. The Do-shala, as the name designates (\\"two-shawl\\"), are always sold in pairs, there being many varieties of them. In the Khali- matan the central field is quite plain and without any ornamentation. The Char-bagan is made up of four pieces in different colours neatly joined together; the central fluid of the shawl is embellished with a medallion of flowers. However, when the field is ornamented with flowers in the four corners we have the Kunj. Perhaps the most characteristic of the Kashmir shawls is the one made like patchwork. The patterns are woven on the looms in long strips, about twelve to eighteen inches in length and from one half to two inches in width. These design strips, made on very simple and primitive looms, are then cut to the required lengths and very neatly and expertly hand sewn together with almost invisible stitches and finally joined by sewing to a plain central field piece. As a variation, pieces may be separately woven, cut up in various shapes of differing sizes and expertly sewn together and then further elaborated with embroidery. But there is a difference between these two types: while the patchwork loom shawls are made up from separate narrow strips, the patchwork embroidered shawls consists of a certain number of irregularly shaped pieces joined together, each one balancing the predominant colour scheme of the shawl. =Namda and Gabba= The basic material for a gubba is milled blanket dyed in plain colour. Embroidery is bold and vivid in designing and done with woollen or cotton threads. Gubbas have more of a folk flavour blankets cut and patched into geometric patterns, with limited, embroidery on joining and open space. It is more like appliqu√© work. Colours are bright and attractive. They are cheap and used for dewan covering or as floor covering‚Äînamdas. =Knit shawls= Hesquiat woman wrapped in a shawl. Triangular knit lace shawls are usually knitted from the neck down, and may or may not be shaped. In contrast, Faroese lace shawls are knitted bottom up and contain a centre back gusset. Each shawl consists of two triangular side panels, a trapezoid-shaped back gusset, an edge treatment, and usually also shoulder shaping. =Stole= Stole, designed by Mme. Jeanne Paquin (French, 1869‚Äì1936) Dorota Rabczewska with a fur collar A stole is a woman's shawl, especially a formal shawl of expensive fabric, used around the shoulders over a party dress or ball gown. A stole is narrower than a typical shawl and of simpler construction than a cape; it is a length of a quality material, wrapped and carried about the shoulders or arms. Lighter materials such as silk and chiffon are simply finished, that is, cropped, hemmed, and bound; heavier materials such as fur and brocade are often lined as well. A stole can also be a fur or set of furs, usually fox, worn as a stole with a suit or gown; the pelage or skin, of a single animal (head included) is generally used with street dress while for formal wear a finished length of fur using the skins of more than one animal is used; the word stole stands alone or is used in combination: fur stole, mink stole, the namesake of Dreamlander Mink Stole.

It marked the end of World War II in Europe and the start of a new, non-Nazi Germany. It was partly an attempt by Germany to dissociate itself from the Nazis. Denazification was encouraged by the Allied forces occupying Germany. The term implies \\"an absolute break with the past and a radical new beginning\\" or a \\"sweeping away of old traditions and customs\\". People at the time were living in a devastated country ‚Äì roughly 80 percent of its infrastructure was in need of repair or reconstruction ‚Äì which helped the idea that Germany was entering a new phase of history. Scholars say controversy erupted when families affected by World War II and the Holocaust began to accuse Germany of trying to avoid punishment or guilt after the war. Stunde Null was used to distance Germany from the Nazi regime in other ways. Over time, the culture of Stunde Null aimed to create a 'race-less' Germany, in stark contrast with the hyper-racialized society of the Nazis. However, this was ineffective because there were still problems associated with race in Germany, and institutional racism was also widespread in the countries of the occupying forces that were trying to \\"re-educate\\" Germans, seen by many as hypocritical.  History of the term  The term was first used in World War I, and it was used to say \\"a time at which some great military action has to take place\\". The term 'zero hour' appears in various sources throughout post-world war one history. It is mostly used in terms of a militaristic concept (as it was when it was first coined), Richard Freund (a journalist) used the term as a call to war, he talks of Hitler's occupation of the Rhineland, and the Spanish civil war pushing the world to the edge, and, then he says \\"The next flash may be the signal. It is Zero Hour\\". Not only was it used in militaristic terms, it also suggests a call to action, Erika Mann says \\"And one man should be forbidden to entreat you: 'Act! This is your hour, it's the final hour ‚Äì the Zero Hour!\\" she calls the American people to action (also during WWII). The term was used to illustrate the need for America to act in World War II, it was used to show the urgency for an American military intervention. Both were used in militaristic settings, displaying urgency to their respective audiences, to the need to intervene and help stop the German advances. It was not until the post-war period that the term was used to refer to the \\"new beginning\\" of Germany.  Allied occupation of Germany  During the post-war period Germany was split up into four zones controlled by the Soviet Union, the United States of America, France, and the United Kingdom. A main cultural impact of this occupation was the denazification process that each of the occupying powers put in place. The main plan to accomplish this was through 're-education', without the German people noticing the shift. This was done, because for the most part (at least on the Allies' side) the new political culture was not supposed to be imposed on Germany, for fears of the Germans rejecting these ideas if they felt they were being reeducated, but the Allies also wanted to make sure that there would not be another Nazi-like regime. The Americans used techniques developed in psychiatry during the 1930s to de-Nazify West Germany. The concept of re-education then was developed originally to change people who had severe delusionary disorders, but it was redone to try and change the German culture at the time. To do this, sociologists, anthropologists, and psychologists studied the differences between democratic and totalitarian societies, to try and find a way to make passing democratic values and traditions to the German people more effective. They encouraged a focus on human values, in favor of 'super human values', that is to say a change from focusing on the state, to instead focusing on individuals. Kurt Lewin suggested that the German people should be given training on how to organize themselves in democratic society, and that this should be done as subtly as possibly, to avoid the German people rejecting democratic ideas. In practice, this meant roughly ten policies that the U.S would enact. First 'white lists', or lists of anti-Nazis who would be entrusted with political, educational, and other positions. Second a screening process was put in to regulate who could become newspaper editors and run publishing houses. Next new political parties were allowed to form in small towns for elections. German prisoners of war were 're-educated'. Information centers were made to let Germans learn about how democracy was going to work. Exchange programs were put in place to let German people see the United States for themselves. Trade unions were formed. Denazification was started, which tried former Nazis for crimes they committed during the Nazi regime. Finally, gewerbefreiheit was put in place, which allowed Germans the freedom to practice a trade, gave freedom of economic activity. However, the Allied occupation did not go entirely as planned, one of the integration processes was to show the German people how race functioned in modern society, so there would not be a repeat of the hyper racialized society created by Nazi Germany. But this message of tolerance was possibly lost in this, because of how America at the time was dealing with race. The American military was segregated up to 1948, and from those that were trying to teach the German people tolerance this demonstrated that the intolerance was still in democratic society.  The situation in Berlin  When the Soviets (who were the first occupying power) arrived in Berlin, they saw a city devastated by the air raids and street fighting. It was described as a Geisterstadt (\\"ghost town\\"). =Extent of the devastation= * 48,000 of the 245,000 buildings in Berlin were destroyed. * 1/3 of all private apartments were totally destroyed. * 23% of industrial capacity was obliterated and the rest was dismantled for transportation by the Russians in the demontage (disassembly). * There were 75 million tons of rubble, which equated to 1/7 of all the rubble in Germany. * All electricity, gas and water supplies were destroyed: ** It was forbidden to wash one's whole body. * The transport network was badly destroyed: ** The underground stations had been flooded and over 90 of them had been bombed. ** The first buses resumed service on May 19. * 78,000 deaths: ** 50,000 victims of the air raids. ** 977 suicides. * A further 4,000 died daily in August 1945, because of the cholera and diphtheria epidemics. * The population shrank and the demographics were significantly altered: ** 4.3 million lived in Berlin before the war, but only 2.8 million afterwards. ** 1/4 of the population were over 60. ** 1 in 10 was under 30. ** There were 16 women to every 10 men. =Das Aufr√§umen (\\"The clean-up\\")= The job of cleaning up the city fell to the Soviets, as they were first (the Western Allies arrived on July 4, 1945) to enter the city. According to them, the clean-up operation would last 12 years. On May 29, all women aged between 15 and 65 were conscripted as Tr√ºmmerfrauen (rubble women). In all, 60,000 women worked to rebuild Berlin. =Rations and starvation= The biggest problem that the Berliners had to face was the threat of starvation. German war-time ration cards were no longer valid. Any remaining rations were either used to feed Russian troops or stolen by hungry Germans. On May 15, the Russians introduced a new five-tier ration-card system: The highest tier was reserved for intellectuals and artists; rubble women and Schwerarbeiter (manual workers) received the second-tier card, which was more valuable to them than the 12 Reichsmark they received for cleaning up a thousand bricks; the lowest card, nicknamed the Friedhofskarte (cemetery ticket) was issued to housewives and the elderly. During this period, the average Berliner was around underweight. Alternative sources of food Due to the meagre rations, the black market thrived, and thousands traded on it daily. Payment was either in cigarettes or by bartering. There were even rumours of cannibalism and the trading of human flesh. The word fringsen entered the German vocabulary during 1945, meaning to steal to survive. This word is etymologically based on the surname of Cardinal Josef Frings, a senior figure in the Catholic Church of Cologne, who (in accordance with long-standing Catholic traditionsee e. g. St. Thomas Aquinas, S. th. II/II 66 VII) famously gave his blessing to those who had to steal in order to feed their family. Der Elendswinter (\\"The miserable winter\\", 1945‚Äì46) The winter of 1945‚Äì46 was one of the coldest winters in Berlin. Temperatures plummeted to and there was no protection from the biting cold in the bombed-out houses. About 40,000 people suffered from hypothermia and 1,000 died as a result. The Berlin Magistrat (municipal authority) created official W√§rmer√§ume (warm rooms) for people to warm themselves in. =Crime= In 1946, Berlin was a haven of crime. There were an average of 240 robberies and five murders a day, and most criminals were the destitute and homeless in Berlin. In the areas east of the future Oder-Neisse line, Red Army soldiers committed cruelties against the German population, including countless rapes. Western Allied soldiers sometimes harassed German civilians too. Problems with law and order occurred in the areas that had still been controlled by the Wehrmacht on May 8, 1945 (e.g. western Austria, Bavaria, South Tyrol (Italy), East Frisia and Schleswig-Holstein), the date of the final German surrender.  Reconstruction and Stunde Null  Also at the time of Stunde Null, Germany lay in ruins after the destruction wrought by World War Two. Following the war was a period of massive scale reconstruction. With roughly eighty percent of the country's infrastructure now in need of repair the German people saw an opportunity to reconstruct an old infrastructure into something more modern. They traded the condensed busy interiors of cities for newer, more expansive boulevards, opting to expand outward, creating more space to live in, rather than continuing the trend of condensing as they had done before. However, this project of reconstruction was and is still so great that the process of implementing the changes is not yet complete. This seemed to be in line with the culture at the time: the fact that the devastation in Germany was so great made it easy to consider Germany new. Not only was the country now separated into east and west, but it was also almost entirely being rebuilt. So for people at the time it seemed like a new Germany.  Culture at the time of Stunde Null  Germany at the time of Stunde Null was certainly very different from its former pre-war self. After the Allies had finished the war, and the concentration camps and the inhuman practices of the Nazis were revealed to the world, and Germany was put into a difficult public relations position (people like Thomas Mann saying things such as \\"Humanity shudders in horror at Germany!\\" (published in a Munich newspaper named Bayerische Landeszeitung)). The severity of Germany's crimes was almost universally recognized by the world, including Germany itself, so a culture of trying to escape that past was created. This spurred the idea that 1945 was not only an end, but a beginning too. This thought process began to appear more and more in German culture and speech, with people like Ernst Wiechert talking about making new beginnings in his 1945 address to Germany, talking of \\"a renewal of German spiritual life\\", or Werner Richter saying \\"The only possible source for a spiritual rebirth lies in an absolute and radical new beginning\\". But there were those that did not think that there would be a possibility for Germany to escape its Nazi past. As Karl Becker said \\"the German people will have lost all right to say that the German people is [are] not Hitler.\\" This is what really created the culture that sought to wash away the wrongs of the predecessors, they wanted the respect and admiration on the world stage once again, and to do that they needed to distance themselves from this idea of Hitler and the Nazi party. The idea of Stunde Null was even in the politics at the end of the war. British diplomat Robert Gilbert Vansittart wanted to offer German \\"barren nothingness\\", an \\"empty space in which they [Germans] must fill in with their own ideas if they have any.\\" Even some of the diplomats negotiating with Germany seemed to want to honor the idea of Stunde Null, further propagating the culture of new beginnings instead of endings. As a result of this new way of thinking, Germany entered into a new period of political rhetoric. A \\"race-less\\" Germany was created, Germany began to disconnect themselves from their hyper-racialized past in favor of one that seemed to ignore the question in general. To a large extent, even scholars started to ignore questions about race, treating the end of World War II as if it solved all of these issues. But race was still very much an issue in the post-war period in Germany. Germany offered their quick acceptance of democratic ideals and customs as proof of their supposed 'race less' culture, but these same ideals were reintroducing racialization to Germany. To most in Germany racialization was still a large problem in Germany post-war. For instance, many East European Jewish Holocaust survivors who resided in post- war displaced persons camps were considered \\"parasitic foreigners\\" who were stealing resources from the German people in need of them. Germany during reconstruction also looked toward the occupying powers for guidance in regards to these matters, but what they saw was segregationist U.S. military policies. But there was also those who sought to remember Germany's past. For all the talk of new beginnings there was a movement to remember the past, and cope. This was called Vergangenheitsbew√§ltigung (coping with the past), though not much of the politics of the time was shaped by this there were many people did not want Germany to simply forget the crimes it had committed during World War II.  Controversy  In 1985, Richard von Weizs√§cker, the President of West Germany at that time, stated \\"There was no 'Stunde Null' but we had the chance for a new beginning\\" (\\"Es gab keine Stunde Null, aber wir hatten die Chance zu einem Neubeginn.\\"Dokument: Rede: Zum 40. Jahrestag der Beendigung des Krieges in Europa und der nationalsozialistischen Gewaltherrschaft. Ansprache des Bundespr√§sidenten Richard von Weizs√§cker am 8. Mai 1985 in der Gedenkstunde im Plenarsaal des Deutschen Bundestages), implying that a true and total restart never occurred in postwar Germany. The term Stunde null implies that the past is over and nothing from former times continues to exist past the Stunde Null. Experts in German culture find that this term is divisive and is a barrier to the collective German psyche and their ability to deal with the recent past. The concept of Vergangenheitsbew√§ltigung (coping with the past) is what experts allude to and Stunde null conflicts directly with this idea, necessitating its judicious use.

His primary instructors in this field were Messrs. Grant and Laing, who saw to his establishment as a Vakil, a profession which became highly profitable for the time that he held it. However, Subba Row's interest in the law paled when compared to the way he devoured philosophy, especially after an event in which he met two particular individuals. In 1882, he invited Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and Henry Steel Olcott to Madras (now Chennai), where he convinced them to make Adyar the permanent headquarters for the Theosophical Society. Prior to this meeting however, Subba Row was not known for any esoteric or mystical knowledge, even by his closest friends and parents . It was only after meeting the pair that he began to expound on metaphysics, astounding most of those who knew him. Upon this meeting and thereafter, Subba Row became able to recite whatever passage was so request of him from the Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads, and many other sacred texts of India. He had, apparently, never studied these things prior to the fateful meeting, and it is stated that when meeting Blavatsky and Damodar K. Mavalankar, all knowledge from his previous lives came flooding back. Theosophy in Adyar Subba Row had initial problems with instructing non-Hindus. It was his distinct belief at the time that Hindu knowledge should remain with India, and not be extended to foreigners. In fact, even after passing over this hurdle, he was still especially private regarding his spiritual life, even to his mother and close friends. Unless the person he was speaking to had a deep understanding of mysticism, it was a fairly mute topic for him. For many years then, Subba Row was instrumental in establishing Theosophy in India, and continued to work hard until the first draft of the Secret Doctrine was given to him. It was his initial compulsion to edit the piece when it had been proposed, but upon reading it, he utterly and completely refused to have anything to do with it. It was his opinion that the piece contained so many mistakes that he might as well be writing a completely new book were he to edit it. Decline In 1888, T. Subba Row resigned from the Theosophical Society along with J.N. Cook. Tensions between himself and many of the members, as well as with HPB, had grown too stressful to maintain. It was only slightly thereafter that he contracted a cutaneous disease, a sickness which manifested itself in an outbreak of boils in 1890 during his last visit to the Theosophical Society's headquarters in Madras. Eventually he would succumb to the disease that year, and died on June 24, 1890, saying that his guru had called him, and that it was time for his departure. He was cremated the morning after as per Hindu tradition. Memorable works Among the many memorable works he left to humanity, they include his commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita, Esoteric Writings, and his Collected Writings in two volumes. *T.

The first Red Guards were established during the 1905 general strike, but disbanded a year later. After the Russian 1917 February revolution the Red Guards were re-established and in the 1918 Finnish Civil War they formed the army of Red Finland. The combined strength of the Red Guard was about 30,000 at the beginning of the Civil War, peaking at between 90,000 and 120,000 during the course of the conflict. The number included more than 2,000 members of the Women's Guards. In May 1918, up to 80,000 Reds were captured by the victorious Whites, 12,000 to 14,000 of them died in the prison camps due to execution, disease and malnutrition. A majority of the Reds were finally pardoned in late 1918. Approximately 10,000 to 13,000 Reds managed to flee to Soviet Russia. Some of them fought in the Russian Civil War until 1920 against the Finnish Whites invading the East Karelia. The Murmansk Legion was a British organized military unit composed of the Red Guard members from Northern Finland who had fled to Russia in the early stages of the Finnish Civil War.  1905 general strike and Sveaborg rebellion  = Establishment = The Red Guards came about during a general strike in November 1905. The strike began in reaction to the Russification of Finland, and was a joint effort between the Social Democratic labour movement and the political right. The strike lasted only a week, but in the final days differing views created a deep gap between the two parties. The National Guard, which was established for law enforcement as the police began to participate, was likewise split into the working-class Red Guards and the bourgeoisie-aligned Protection Corps. Some minor incidents followed, especially in the capital Helsinki, but violent clashes were avoided. Although the general strike was over, both guards remained active. In 1906, the number of Red Guard members was estimated 25,000. Arrested Reds are taken in custody after the 1906 Sveaborg rebellion. = Hakaniemi riot = Violence between the two sides finally burst out on 2 August 1906 during the Sveaborg rebellion, a revolt of the Russian Bolshevik sailors in the Sveaborg Fortress in Helsinki. As the mutiny started, the Helsinki Red Guard, led by Johan Kock, joined the rebellions by sabotage in the mainland. In the final day of the revolt, Johan Kock declared a general strike on his own, without a permission from the Social Democratic Party which was leading the Finnish labour movement as there was no central trade union. The strike was joined by thousands of Helsinki workers. The bourgeois opposed the strike as well and sent the Protection Corps to the Hakaniemi working- class district in order to keep the city's tram traffic rolling. At the Hakaniemi Square, the Protection Corps was surrounded by an angry mob of local people throwing stones. The incident escalated into a gunfight between the Protection Corps and the Red Guards supported by a squad of Russian sailors. The riot was finally disrupted by the Russian cosacks, ending with 2 killed Reds and 7 killed Protection Corps members. 200 people were arrested, but only one Red Guard platoon leader was convicted as there was not enough evidence against the others. The funeral of the killed Reds became a mass demonstration against the violence of the bourgeois. The Protection Corps, in turn, arranged a large funeral as a protest against the Red violence. As the Sveaborg rebellion was suppressed, 900 Russian mutineers and about 100 Red Guard members were arrested. 77 Reds were convicted. = Dissolution = As a result of the Hakaniemi riot, the Senate of Finland banned both guards. The Social Democratic Party had already decided to disband the Red Guards in the party congress held in Oulu in late August. Some delegates opposed the decision and had a secret meeting where an underground organization was established to proceed the Red Guards. The organization was soon revealed to the party leaders but the underground Red Guards were active until the 1907 general election. Their task was to be prepared for the possible revolution in Russia.  1917 re-establishment  = February Revolution = Worker's Militia in the Turku suburb of Maaria during the general strike of May 1917. The Red Guards were re-established during the 1917 Russian revolution as a result of the dispute over the law enforcement and the general turmoil in the Grand Duchy of Finland. After the February revolution, the Russian controlled police force lost its status in Finland. The law enforcement was first moved to the Russian military which turned it over to the local labour organizations. The established unarmed units were temporary and had no further revolutionary goals. Finally, the new People's Militia was organized in late March in 17 largest Finnish towns. The political right did not accept the new arrangement and the Senate formed a committee to solve the dispute. On 18 July, the so- called ‚Ä≥power law‚Ä≥ was passed in the Social Democratic majority parliament. The power to enact laws was to be transferred from Saint Petersburg to Helsinki and from the Senate to the parliament. This law would have enabled a purely Social Democratic government to be formed in consequence of the position the party gained in the 1916 election. The Russian Provisional Government refused to approve the law and with the co-operation of the Finnish bourgeois parties dissolved the parliament. In the October 1917 election, the Social Democratic Party lost its majority, although it remained the largest party with 92 seats. The Senate now disbanded the People's Militia and established a police force where the left-wing and labour activists were not allowed to join. = Workers' Order Guards = The food shortage launched a large number of agricultural strikes during the summer of 1917. On 13 July, a violent clash between the striking farm workers and their employers occurred in the Western Finnish municipality of Huittinen. The incident is often seen as the beginning of the events which finally led to the Civil War in January 1918. After the Huittinen riot, the right-wing farmers in the Satakunta province started forming Protection Guards and were soon followed in other parts of the country. The labour movement responded by establishing Workers' Order Guards. By the early October, guards were formed in 17 towns and 20 rural municipalities, mostly in the industrialized areas of the Turku and Pori, Uusimaa and Viipuri provinces. These units had up to 7,000‚Äì8,000 men. On 20 October, the Finnish Trade Union Federation urged the party and trade union locals establishing Workers' Order Guards to every corner of the country. In the next three weeks, the number of guards increase to 237 with more than 30,000 members. The rules of the Guards were published in the party newspapers. The formation was very similar to a common military organization, though the commander was replaced with a five-men committee. Finland was now split in two sides; the middle and upper-classes including the wealthy farmers against the working-class, poor peasants and the landless people. First violent incidents between the Protective Guards and the Workers' Order Guards occurred during the general strike in November 1917. More workers were still joining the Order Guards, as the strike ended on 20 November, the number of members was 40,000‚Äì50,000. The newspaperman Ali Aaltonen, who had served as a lieutenant in the Imperial Russian Army, was named the first commander-in- chief of the Workers' Order Guards. A demonstration in Turku in March 1917. The general strike was the first time the Workers' Order Guards were used as a nationwide organization. In many places, they were actually leading the strike, instead of the strike committees. The guards were acting on their own, searching for food supplies and weapons from wealthy houses. As the right-wing Protection Corps were rather weak, the Order Guards could usually work without any resistance. Although, in some places the Protection Corps took up arms which resulted in violent clashes, prefiguring the oncoming Civil War. The Workers' Order Guards were most powerful in Helsinki as they were armed by the Russian troops. The Helsinki Guard captured couple of hundred people and invaded the House of the Estates, which prevented the Senate from working. The leaders of the Social Democratic Party strictly condemned this kind of action, insisting the militant guards must be taken under the party control. Soon after the general strike, the first congress of the Worker's Order Guards was held in the Tampere Workers' Hall in 16‚Äì18 December 1917. By the new rules adopted in the meeting, the guards were now under an unconditional authority of the Social Democratic Party and the Trade Union Federation. = Drift toward war = After Finland gained its independence from Soviet Russia on 6 December 1917, the disagreement and discontent were still growing. Incidents occurred across the country as the striking workers and the Order Guards clashed with the Protection Corps and right-wing bourgeoisie. The unemployed demonstrators surrounded the town hall for two days in Vyborg and in Tampere, the city council was captured by the local Workers' Order Guard. In Turku, the Order Guard occupied town officies and captured the chief of police. The Protection Corps attacked the labour activists in some places too. On 6 January, the Helsinki Workers' Order Guard declared itself independent from the Social Democratic Party. The unit was renamed the Helsinki Red Guard. Three days later, the guard occupied the residence of the Governor-General of Finland. It was now called as the Smolna, like the Bolshevik headquarters in Saint Petersburg. On the same day, the Helsinki Guard sent 200 men to Sipoo for searching guns hidden by the local Protection Corps. The operation escalated into a gunfight where two Reds were killed. Helsinki Worker's Order Guard in the fall of 1917. At the beginning of the 1918, the Workers' Order Guards still had very few guns. For example, the largest guard in Helsinki was armed with only 20‚Äì30 military rifles. In the early January, the commander-in- chief Ali Aaltonen went to Saint Petersburg to acquire weaponry from the Bolsheviks. On 13 January, Aaltonen informed the general staff of the cargo of 10,000 rifles and 10 artillery pieces which would be brought to Finland within couple of weeks. At the same time, the Protection Corps was preparing the trade of 60,000 rifles from Germany. Up to this point, many of the largest Workers' Order Guards were occupied by radicals who were pushing the Finnish labour movement towards an armed conflict. They were no longer under the authority of the Social Democratic Party or the Trade Union Federation. In order to keep the labour movement united, the party leadership was forced to negotiate with the revolutionary guards. Many of the leading Social Democrats, like V√§in√∂ Tanner, Taavi Tainio and Evert Huttunen, were moderate, they opposed the armed revolution and the acts of the Order Guards. In 19‚Äì23 January, violent clashes between the Workers' Guards and the Protection Corps occurred in eastern Finland in Vyborg and Luum√§ki and in the western part of the country in Kiikka. In Vyborg, the second largest town in Finland, the Protection Corps was trying to obtain the control but was evicted from the town. Another serious incident was in Luum√§ki, as the Protection Corps grabbed 200 rifles at the Taavetti railway station. Two days later, the Workers' Guards attacked the Protection Corps in order to take the guns back. Finally, on 25 January, the Senate declared the Protection Corps to be government troops. The Social Democrats and the labour movement interpreted this as a declaration of war against the working-class. As a result, the Workers' Order Guards and the Helsinki Red Guard were merged into the paramilitary Red Guard of Finland (Suomen Punainen Kaarti) and the revolution was proclaimed in the late evening of 26 January by lighting a red lantern as a sign to the tower of the Helsinki Workers' Hall. The order for the mobilization came on the next morning from the executive committee of the Trade Union Federation, coincided with the spontaneous clashing of Red Guards and the Protection Corps.  1918 Civil War  = Commanders = A Red Guard unit from Pertteli. The first commander-in-chief of the Red Guards was the former Russian Army lieutenant Ali Aaltonen, who was elected during the general strike in November 1917. As the Civil War started, the task was given to Eero Haapalainen, with the Russian colonel Mikhail Svechnikov as his military advisor since the end of February. Haapalainen was expelled on 20 March and replaced by Eino Rahja, Adolf Taimi and Evert Eloranta. The troika stayed at the office until 10 April, when Kullervo Manner was given the dictator's rights as a head of the Red Government and the Red Guards. August Wesley served as the chief of the Red Guards general staff from 16 February to 6 April. On 25 April, Manner fled to Soviet Russia, and for the last ten days of the war, there was no commander-in-chief. The final major battle was fought in Vyborg under the command of Edvard Gylling and Oskar Rantala. = Size = Due to incomplete and destroyed records, the exact number of men who served in the Red Guards is unknown. Historians provide estimates between 80,000 and 100,000 men. As the war started, the number was about 40,000, but by the end of the war, the total strength rose to 80,000‚Äì100,000 men and women, including 2,600 female fighters and thousands of women in the unarmed maintenance units. Approximately 40,000 were at the front at any one time. The largest single unit was the Helsinki Red Guard with a strength of 8,000‚Äì10,000 men and women. Other major units were the Red Guards of Tampere and Vyborg and the Saint Petersburg Finnish Red Guard. The Female Guards had about 2,000‚Äì2,600 members. Russian participation remained low, although 40,000 soldiers of the Imperial Russian Army and the Baltic Fleet were still in Finland. Only a few hundred joined the Red Guards, including a few dozen officers. Most of the Russian troops simply wanted to leave the country and return home. In addition to the Finland-based troops, the Saint Petersburg Bolsheviks supported the Reds in some battles on the Karelian Front. = Organization = The Red Guards were composed of industrial workers, landless rural workers and crofters. Most of them were members of the Finnish Trade Union Federation. The number of middle-class people was very small. The average age was between 20 and 30, the youngest fighters were only 15 to 16-years-old. The Red military units consisted of infantry, artillery and a small unit of cavalry. Weapons and other equipment were mostly received from the Russian troops. In the beginning of February, a train commanded by Jukka Rahja arrived from Saint Petersburg, carrying a cargo of 15,000 rifles, machine-guns, artillery pieces and 2 million cartridges, which the commander-in-chief Ali Aaltonen had purchased from the Bolsheviks. The Reds also had six armoured trains and a couple of aeroplanes which were flown by Russian pilots. Medical unit of the Pispala Red Guard. The general staff was located in Helsinki, with major subordinate staffs in Tampere and Vyborg. The infantry was divided into regiments and battalions but in practice, the largest commanded units were companies. A Red Guard company usually consisted of the men of some trade union local. For example, the Helsinki Red Guard had units composed of shoemakers, tailors, blacksmiths, sheet metal workers, plumbers, stonemasons and so on. Also some working-class sporting clubs formed their own squads. In the rural areas, the units were assembled by the men of the same locality. The Red Guard fighters received a salary that was sometimes even bigger than what they were paid for their usual work. As there was high unemployment, money was one of the reasons for joining the guards. Very few Reds had any kind of military background. The ones who had served in the Russian Imperial Army were usually voted as company leaders. The Red Guard fighters had a short military training before they were sent to the front line. The battles were usually fought like an ordinary working day. The fighting begun at the dawn and as the Sun set, the men returned to the base. On the Tavastia Front, some troops even spent the nights in Tampere, returning to the front by train in the morning. The major problems were a lack of equipment, poor leadership and training, and food shortages at the front. The practice of electing officers democratically made discipline lax. Sometimes this led to a general unwillingness to go on offensive operations or to operate outside their local areas. The Red Guards did not have a clear command structure. Local commanders developed plans of their own, which did not always coincide with the one ones composed by general staff in Helsinki. As there were very few trained officers, battlefield tactics had to be kept basic. = War = Red Guard fighters in Ruovesi. As the war started on 27 January, the Red Guards occupied the capital, Helsinki, and the largest towns of industrialized southern Finland. The front line was soon established, stretching from the Gulf of Bothnia to the Karelian Isthmus, 30‚Äì50 kilometres north of Pori, Tampere, Lahti, Lappeenranta and Vyborg. The Whites occupied rural northern Finland, where the few Red strongholds fell in less than two weeks without any strong resistance. The last Red occupied town in the north was Varkaus, which the Whites seized on 21 February. In the Ostrobothnia, Central Finland, Savonia and North Karelia regions most Reds were captured, but in Lapland many were able to flee to Sweden, Norway or Soviet Russia. The Red military operations were divided into three major theaters: the Western Front (Satakunta and H√§me provinces), the Middle Front (Savo province) and the Eastern Front (the Vyborg province). The northernmost area of the Western Front, located north of Tampere, was often known as the Northern Front. The Red Guard general staff worked in Helsinki, with major subordinate staffs in Tampere and Vyborg. As a major railway junction, Lahti was also an important town for the Red military. A large number of units were organized and trained there before they were sent to the eastern fronts in Savo and Karelia. The Reds launched three major offensives; in the beginning of February, 21 February and 10 March. The goal was to take the east‚Äìwest railways connecting Ostrobothnia, Savonia and Karelia. From there the Reds could strike at the strongest White strongholds as well as the White capital of Vaasa. However, the offensives failed and the front line remained in the same position from early February to mid-March. On 15 March, the Whites launched their major offensive against the Reds in the northern H√§me where the Red front collapsed in a couple of days. The Whites were now able to besiege Tampere, militarily the most important Red town. The Battle of Tampere was fought from 23 March to 6 April. It was the fiercest battle of the Finnish Civil War, and at the time, also the largest urban battle in the world. The Battle of Tampere ended with mass executions of capitulated Reds, 10,000‚Äì11,000 were captured, and thousands fled the surrounding areas. A refugee family captured in Lahti. At the same time, German troops landed on the south coast of Finland and launched their campaign to support the Whites. On 6 April, the Red Government and the Red Guard general staff left Helsinki for Vyborg. The Red units in the western provinces of Satakunta and Finland Proper were given the order to retreat to eastern Finland. The intention was to re-organize the troops behind the river Kymijoki, but the plan was never realized. Instead, the order caused a mass exodus of refugees as tens of thousands of Red Guard fighters, their family members and other Red supporters fled towards the east. As the Germans seized Helsinki on 13 April, up to 8,000 local Reds surrendered. Thousands of others from the Uusimaa province joined the refugee column that was coming from the west. In two weeks, more than 100,000 Red refugees headed east, in order to flee to Soviet Russia. About 12,000 managed to cross the border, while most of the remaining were captured. In late April, up to 30,000 civilians and Red fighters fell into the hands of the German and White troops in Lahti. The captured were first placed at the Fellman camp, and then transferred to various prison camps across the southern Finland. Although most of the women and children were released, 200‚Äì600 Red women were executed and hundreds of others moved into other prison camps. The last major battle took place in Vyborg, which the Whites occupied on 29 April. The last remaining Red stronghold was in the Kymenlaakso province where the Reds finally surrendered to the Germans on 6 May. Between 23 March and 18 April, some clashes also occurred in the remote eastern Lapland. The Karelian nationalist Iivo Ahava was fighting against the Whites who launched the Viena expedition in order to annex the Russian White Karelia into the newly independent Finland. Ahava formed a Red Guard unit in the Russian town of Kandalaksha of the Reds who had fled from Lapland. Two other Finnish Red Guards were formed in Knyazhaya Guba and Kem. In the mid-March, these units had up to 2,500 men. Ahava managed to stop the Whites and he was also eager to attack their rear in the northern Finland. However, the Red leaders were not interested in supporting him as they considered that the war would be determined in the populated areas of south.  After the War  A substantial number of Finnish Red Guards managed to retreat into Russian-held territories after the Whites' victory in Finland. Red Guard units served in the 7th Red Army when it fought in Estonia. There, the Finnish Reds clashed with Finnish White volunteers fighting for the Republic of Estonia.

In common usage, the term 'single' is often used to refer to someone who is not involved in any type of serious romantic relationship, including long-term dating, engagement, marriage, or someone who is 'single by choice'. Single people may participate in dating and other activities to find a long- term partner or spouse.  Reasons people remain single  People may remain single for a variety of reasons, including (but not limited to): * Financial duress * Their mental health * Pursuing educational or professional advancement * Lack of suitable partners * Changes in perceptions of the necessity of marriage * Dedication to religions orders that do not allow for marriage * In some cases, single people may be uninterested in marriage, domestic partnership, or other types of committed relationships.AFP/Discovery News, 12 January, 2010Alex Williams, \\"The New Math on Campus\\", New York Times, 5 February 2010 * Traumatic experiences including domestic violence, dysfunctional family, rape and/or sexual assault *The increasing trend of marrying later in life and cohabitation Some single people regard and appreciate solitude as an opportunity. Some people stay single by choice. In addition to choosing singleness as a preferential option, there are also those who choose not to marry for religious reasons. These religious traditions include: * The Christian monastics cultures of Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Coptism * The specific Buddhist monastic traditions Single culture in specific countries =United States= According to the United States Bureau of the Census, the fastest-growing household type since the 1980s has been the single person. Previously both socially uncommon and unaccepted due to perceived roles, public awareness, modern socioeconomic factors and increasingly available popular and lengthier education and careers have made the single lifestyle a viable option for many Americans, especially after the Vietnam War. According to the United States Bureau of the Census, in 2016 single adults counted for over 45% of the US population. Sixty-Five Percent of this group had never been married. In 2014, Pew Research Center notes that the highest percentage of never married adults between White, Black, Hispanic and Asian Americans were Black Americans. The same study also projected that about 25% of millennials may not get married. =United Kingdom= Similar to the United States, single-person households have been seen to be increasingly popular in the United Kingdom. In the 2000s, studies found that more citizens were seen to be valuing their career over personal relationships. The increase in single-person households was also partly attributed to the high self-esteem it can offer to some people.\\"Single living is the new way to find happiness\\". Times Online. 3 August 2005. Retrieved 2 June 2010. =Japan= In Japan, it is not uncommon for citizens to choose to remain single. This has been illustrated with many public figures and celebrities. Women typically value friendships over romantic relationships; many continue to have jobs and marry later, or forego marriage completely. However, people in Japan who do wish to date have reported that it is difficult to find the time to do so due to being overworked. =South Korea= In South Korea an unofficial holiday called Black Day is observed on 14 April each year by and for single people. Singles who did not receive gifts on Valentine's Day or White Day meet dressed in black and eat jajangmyeon, noodles covered in black bean paste. The dish is one of South Korea's national foods, and is considered a comfort food. = Sweden = In Stockholm, Sweden, sixty per cent of the people live by themselves. Terminology Terminology for singleness vary. The variation usually based on gender, language, and country. Generally singles can be categorized by the following terms: never married, separated, divorced, and widowed. = English = Terms used to describe single men are seldom used, and carry positive connotations. Single men are often simply referred to as bachelors. The English language has more terms for single, unwed women. These terms typically carry a negative connotation. Single women are sometimes called bachelorettes, especially in festive contexts in American English. However, the historic term for unwed women is spinster. The connotations of the word spinster have changed so much over time that it is now considered a derogatory term. The Oxford English Dictionary says in its usage notes for the word: :The development of the word spinster is a good example of the way in which a word acquires strong connotations to the extent that it can no longer be used in a neutral sense. From the 17th century the word was appended to names as the official legal description of an unmarried woman: Elizabeth Harris of London, Spinster. This type of use survives today in some legal and religious contexts. In modern everyday English, however, spinster cannot be used to mean simply ‚Äòunmarried woman‚Äô; it is now always a derogatory term, referring or alluding to a stereotype of an older woman who is unmarried, childless, prissy, and repressed. Though spinster has a long history of being negative, there are some authors, such as Katie Bolick, that are trying to change the word's connotation into something positive. Additionally, the phrase Old Maid is used to describe an unmarried women. =French= Catherinette was a traditional French label for girls of 25 years old who were still unmarried by the Feast of Saint Catherine. = Chinese = The term sheng nu is used to describe unmarried women who are in mid to late twenties in China and East Asia. = Japanese = In Japan, men that have no interest in getting married are called S≈çshoku(-kei) danshi (ËçâÈ£ü(Á≥ª)Áî∑Â≠ê ) or Herbivore men. This term also describes as young men who have lost their \\"manliness\\". Relationship status and health Being single, like being in a relationship, affects people's health. People have different perspectives on the ways in which relationship status influences health. According to researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, \\"Being single is not good for your health and lifespan\\".

(2003) Confessions of an ex-bachelor, p. 113 Also there is a Single Supplement that adds extra fees to those traveling alone. In some countries, particular laws may directly or indirectly disadvantage single persons. In the United States, for example, Social Security widow(er) benefits are only available to those persons who have been previously married, and single people in the United States pay more income taxes than married people. In many countries tour and holiday operators impose a penalty (often as much as 100%) on persons who travel alone. Older singles are also a targeted market, for much the same reasons. They are typically divorcees or widowed, perhaps reconciled to being single for the rest of their lives, and looking to make the most of what remains to them. Their children, if any, will typically be financially independent. They may, or may not, be looking for another relationship. They also are heavily targeted by marketers. There is a whole industry dedicated to making unsolicited telephone calls to this group in the hope of exploiting the ones who are unable to distinguish between the honest and the dishonest.

JIVE's mandate is to support the operations and users of the European VLBI Network (EVN), in the widest sense. Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) is a type of astronomical interferometry used in radio astronomy. It allows observations of an object that are made simultaneously by many telescopes to be combined, emulating a telescope with a size equal to the maximum separation between the telescopes. Normally the participating radio telescopes function individually, working on their own specific projects. In the case of VLBI, they all observe the same source at the same time, allowing much higher spatial resolution. There are many complex and challenging hurdles that need to be overcome to enable this effort. One challenge is the data processing requirement. JIVE operates the EVN data processor, known as the correlator - a special-purpose supercomputer for astronomical VLBI data correlation.  Organisation of JIVE  JIVE is located in Dwingeloo, the Netherlands and is hosted by the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON). JIVE has six members: * The Netherlands, represented by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON) * France, represented by the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) * Latvia, represented by the Ministry of Education and Science (IZM) * Spain, represented by the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Agenda (MITMA) * Sweden, represented by the Swedish Research Council (VR) * The United Kingdom, represented by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) JIVE is also supported by the following participating research institutes: * National Astronomical Observatories of China (NAOC), China * Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR), Germany * National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF), Italy *National Research Federation (NRF), South Africa There are currently 22 telescopes in the EVN. Observations using the EVN can also be carried out in real-time, thus earning the name of e-VLBI (electronic Very Long Baseline Interferometry). The telescopes are then linked via high-speed national research and education networks (NRENs) which overcome some of the performance drawbacks of TCP/IP and UDP/IP (networking protocols) to allow sharing large volumes of data for immediate use. Such high-speed networks eliminate the shipping of disks of data from separate observations for correlation, thus allowing astronomers to respond to events as they happen in real time. The VLBI data are streamed to JIVE, where they are correlated and the final, high-resolution image created. In a demonstration of e-VLBI as part of 100 Hours of Astronomy in 2009 14 telescopes from Australia, Chile, China, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Puerto Rico, Spain, Sweden and the UK participated in joint observations of the active galaxy 3C120. The participating telescopes included: * the 26 meter telescope at Hobart, operated by the University of Tasmania; * the 22m dish of Mopra, part of the Long Baseline Array, operated by CSIRO; * the 25m dish of Sheshan near Shanghai, operated by the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences; * the 14m Mets√§hovi dish, operated by the Aalto University; * the 32m telescope of Toru≈Ñ; * the 32m telescope at Medicina, operated by the Instituto Nazionale di Astrofisica; * the 25m telescope at the Onsala Space Observatory; * the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope; * the Yebes 40m, operated by the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional; * the 300m dish of Arecibo, located in Puerto Rico; * the 6m dish of TIGO, operated by the Geod√§tisches Observatorium Wettzell.

Clark International Ltd, trading as Clarks, is a British-based, international shoe manufacturer and retailer. It was founded in 1825 by brothers Cyrus and James Clark in Street, Somerset, England ‚Äì where it still has its headquarters. The company has over 1,000 branded stores and franchises around the world and also sells through third-party distribution. For the year ending January 2013, the company made a profit of ¬£150 million on sales of ¬£1,433m making it the 31st largest private company in the United Kingdom. More than half of its ¬£1.4bn annualised sales to January were generated abroad, and since 2010 the company has moved into India, where it now has 25 stand-alone stores, and relaunched marketing in China, where it has opened 400 outlets in partnership with local footwear retailers. It is 84% owned by the Clark family, with the remaining 16% held by employees and related institutions. The company is commonly known for its Desert Boot, a distinctive ankle height boot with crepe rubber sole, usually made out of calf suede leather traditionally supplied by Charles F Stead & Co tannery in Leeds. Officially launched in 1950 the Desert Boot was designed by Nathan Clark (great-grandson of James Clark) based on an unlined suede boot profile produced in the bazaars of Cairo and worn by British officers in the Second World War. History =1825‚Äì1862 ‚Äì Rugs, slippers and prizes= Cyrus and James Clark the founders of C&J; Clark Ltd. The Brown Petersburg Origins of C. & J. Clark can be traced back to 1821 when Cyrus Clark (1801‚Äì1866) entered into a partnership with a Quaker cousin in the trade of fellmongering, wool-stapling and tanning in Street, Somerset. By 1825, this partnership had been dissolved and Cyrus relocated to a site on the High Street in Street, utilising premises that belonged to his father-in- law to exploit his idea of making rugs out of sheepskins instead of pulling off the wool. C. & J. Clark recognise this as the beginning of their business and continue to occupy the site upon which Cyrus started to this very day. By 1828, as the business had grown, Cyrus appointed his younger brother James (1811‚Äì1906) as an apprentice. Educated away from Street, James was meant to be apprentice to a chemist in Bath, but successfully pleaded with his parents to let him stay in Street and help Cyrus. In 1828‚Äì1829, whilst serving this apprenticeship, James began utilising the offcuts that were too short for making rugs to produce slippers (known as Brown Petersburgs). The slippers were made using outworkers who collected materials from the factory, assembled footwear in workshops at home and returned the finished product for payment. This trade rapidly evolved, providing James with a legitimate claim to an equal partnership in the business when his apprenticeship was served in 1833. Thereafter, it traded as C. & J. Clark. The brothers developed national and international trade (Ireland in the 1820s, Canada by the 1830s, Australia in the 1850s) and were notably innovative, winning the Gold Medal at the Great Exhibition in 1851 for their gutta percha elongated galosh. =1863‚Äì1903 ‚Äì Riding the storm= The Tor stamp was used as a mark of provenance and quality by C&J; Clark Ltd. since the beginning. It represents the distinctive Glastonbury Tor with St. Michael's tower on its summit that dominates the landscape visible from the Clarks headquarters in Street, Somerset. Registered as a trademark since 1879. A vintage image of the sewing room in one of the Clarks factories A couple of bad years that combined volatile market conditions, a certain lack of financial rigour and questionable planning brought the business to the brink of bankruptcy in 1863. The local Quaker community stepped in and part of the bailout deal was the nomination of James‚Äô eldest son, William Stephens Clark (1839‚Äì1925) to the helm of C. & J. Clark. William Clark put in place an accelerated repayment plan that saw indebtedness drop considerably to 1873 when he became a partner in the business with his father James. For the first time in Britain, William mechanised the shoemaking process and went on to establish C. & J. Clark both as a pioneer of new technology and as a champion of footwear innovation. James withdrew from the partnership in 1889, to be replaced by his son Francis, William's younger brother. In line with the family's Quaker values, the capital was also extended beyond the factory to benefit social initiatives in Street: a school was founded so that young men and women could combine working in the factory with continuing their education, a theatre was opened, a library was built, along with an open-air swimming pool and town hall. Playing fields were established for the benefit of all and low-cost housing was provided by the company for its employees. =1904‚Äì1945 ‚Äì Style, technology and foot measuring= An employee carefully packing some of the premium Clarks Tor products In 1903 the partnership arrangement was discontinued in favour of a private limited company. This enabled the succession to the third generation of family members as children of William Stephens Clark became ‚Äòlife directors‚Äô alongside Francis and himself. Tasked with specific responsibilities, Alice Clark, John Bright Clark and Roger Clark developed distinct roles. Brothers John Bright and Roger Clark studied American making processes and techniques with a view to appointing a suitable candidate experienced in the American factory system that they might bring to Street. John Walter Bostock from Lynn, Massachusetts was recruited in 1904. The implementation was a resounding success and Bostock was made a director of the company in 1928. A London Office, opened in the West End in 1908, supplemented the shoemaking knowledge with style information. A reputation for high quality goods available in the latest fashions, was established in the early 1910s, and remained until the Second World War. A premium quality ‚ÄòTor‚Äô range was produced on the principles of standard lines, followed by a range of affordable fashionable footwear called ‚ÄòWessex‚Äô. The company had its first national press advertisement in 1934, and entered formally into retailing in 1937 through the acquisition of Abbotts chain of shops based around London and the provinces. \\"Peter Lord\\" was created by Hugh Bryan Clark as a retail brand to avoid alarming agents or alerting competitors to the company's activities. It steadily evolved into a national network of stores. Growing awareness that ‚Äòbad feet‚Äô were the product of ill-fitting shoes determined Bostock to devise a new shoe fitting system based on the detailed analysis of thousands of foot measurements taken from local school children. In line with the findings the company launched its new children's ranges in 1945 with a choice of four width fittings, simultaneously with the new Clarks footgauge that acted as a scientific measuring instrument to aid the shop assistant. =1946‚Äì1995 ‚Äì Growth and challenges= Nathan Clark holding a Desert Boot Expansion of the business post-war was largely initiated by fourth generation family members: Bancroft Clark, appointed Managing Director and Chairman in 1942 and his cousins, Anthony Clark and Peter Clothier, accountable for Sales/Marketing and Manufacturing respectively. The start-up or acquisition of additional manufacturing facilities (peaking at 17 domestic factories) across the South West and South East of England and South Wales meant that the company's volume market share in the UK increased from 1.1 percent in 1945 to 9 per cent by 1970. Foreign manufacturing was also sought through agreements with existing domestic manufacturers: Ireland in the 1930s with Australia, Canada and South Africa added in the 1940s and 1950s. Nathan Clark (younger brother of Bancroft) negotiated a number of these agreements in his capacity as Overseas Manager until 1952. Bancroft retired in 1967. His son, Daniel Clark succeeded Peter Clothier as Managing Director in 1973, with Anthony Clark remaining as Chairman. He retired in 1974, when his son, Lance Clark, was appointed Managing Director of the manufacturing and wholesaling division. In 1974 Clarks bought the fashionable Ravel, Pinet and Mondaine. The company acquired \\"K\\" Shoes, based in Kendal, Cumbria to salvage it from a hostile takeover. The closure of factories started in 1978, and continued throughout the 1980s. Daniel Clark resigned in 1986 replaced by John Clothier (son of Peter) who remained CEO throughout the turbulent buy-out negotiations with Berisford International Plc, a properties commodities group that attempted to take the troubled company public. While the proposal was defeated by shareholders at the EGM convened on May 7, 1993 it was also decided to move away from direct family management to professional managers, who would rationalise the business, and would be more comfortable with making the changes needed for its recovery. =1996‚Äìpresent: Worldwide growth and a global brand= A Clarks shoe shop in Southampton, United Kingdom The appointment of Tim Parker as CEO in 1996 was made on the initiation of the newly elected Chairman, Roger Pedder. Clarks format was radically changed with the ‚ÄòAct Your Shoe Size Not Your Age‚Äô Campaign in 1997, which contributed to a freshening of the brand. Completion of the transition from manufacturing to a wholesaling and branded retailing business was conducted by Parker's successor, Peter Bolliger, who became CEO in 2002. Closure of the company's remaining manufacturing interests meant that the last Clarks UK factory ceased production in 2005 followed by the last \\"K\\" factory in 2006. Production was relocated off-shore, using third party factories, predominantly located in Asia. Transformation of retail and investment to modernise company infrastructure and systems was also completed. Street consequently remains the epicentre for company operations, a distribution facility having been constructed in the town in 2005 with the capacity to process 1 million pairs of shoes per week. Former CEO, Melissa Potter, who was appointed in 2010, re-organized the business in four regions Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe and United Kingdom & Republic of Ireland (from February 2013), the re-launch in China, the move into India, the launch of the online business and the increased focus on building a global brand. Melissa Potter stepped down as CEO in September 2015. Non-executive chairman Thomas O‚ÄôNeill lead the business until 2017 when Mike Shearwood was appointed as the new CEO. Then following Shearwood's resignation in June 2018, Stella David was announced as In-term CEO. In February 2019 Giorgio Presca was announced as the new CEO, Stella David returned to her role on the board. In May 2018, the company announced that it would build a new production plant next to its headquarters in Street, Somerset. The ¬£3 million factory would see the latest in robot technology and create 80 jobs and produce over 300,000 pairs of Desert Shoes per year. =Clarks Companies North America (CCNA)= The history of C&J; Clark's representation in America dates back to 1950 and the formation of Clarks of England Inc. Initiated by Bronson Davis, a car salesman, who had seen the Desert Boot at the Chicago Shoe Fair in 1949. Davis established a sales organization covering 150 accounts with outlets that stocked Clarks products, predominantly Desert Boots. He also sponsored advertisements for Clarks shoes in The New Yorker and Esquire magazines. Davis established relations with some of America's most prestigious retailers; Abercrombie & Fitch, Neiman-Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue. The coverage for the Desert Boot was consolidated by advertising that targeted the ‚Äòcampus trade‚Äô of Berkeley, Cornell, Harvard, North Carolina and Yale Universities through ads in Esquire and college magazines. A young salesman named Robert (Bob) Cullerton followed Bronson Davis at the lead in America. Appointed President in April 1961, he inherited a business focussed on the provision of men's casuals and the Desert Boot. He appointed designer Nancy Knox to create a new range advertised via Playboy and Gentlemen‚Äôs Quarterly. In parallel with American developments, C&J; Clark Ltd. acquired the Blachford Shoe Manufacturing Co. Ltd. of Toronto in 1952, establishing a foothold in Canada led by Hugh Woods and Harold Hughes. Similarities between the businesses in Canada and North America meant Cullerton, Woods and Hughes quickly collaborated. They developed a clear vision of what women's sandals and shoes were required to supplement the demand for men's casual offerings. An Italian resourcing programme was started by Woods in 1960 to get more style and variety into the ranges. Offices were opened in the Empire State Building, New York in April 1964. Sales were also buoyed by the introduction of the Wallabee in the late 1960s and expansion towards the West Coast. Wholesaling interests were complemented with retail from the late 1970s through the acquisition of Hanover Shoes Inc. who owned 220 retail shops. At the same time C&J; Clark decided to bring together its North American interests under one corporation to operate Hanover, Clarks of England and Clarks Canada. The business grew further in 1979 through the acquisition of Bostonian, a well-respected men's dress shoe brand, adding 25 more shop locations as well as entry into 70 leased stores and discounting outlets. Responsibility for Clarks Canada and Clarks of England was transferred to the C&J; Clarks HQ in Street in 1986. Clarks of England and Clarks Canada officially merged in 1987 to provide more operational efficiencies and more consistency of product offering for North America. Bob Infantino became CEO of the North American operations in 1992, taking a key role consolidating the manufacturing, retailing, and wholesaling activities in America into one company: Clarks Companies North America (CCNA) from 1995. By 1998, CCNA became principally a wholesaling business, serving 170 owned retail locations and 3,600 third party wholesale accounts, representing 14,200 retail outlets. Sales increased by 57 per cent from 1995 to 2001, profits rose five- fold. Infantino left the company in 2010, replaced by Jim Salzano who was at the helm of the North American business until 2013, when CCNA officially became the Americas Region, one of the four regions resulting as part of the re-organization initiated by Melissa Potter. Since March 2016 Gary Champion has led the Americas Region as President, also serving on the Global Leadership Team. Products =School shoes= In the United Kingdom, Clarks has long been a popular choice of parents as a place to purchase school shoes for children to wear upon returning to school following the summer holidays. Clarks school shoes have long had a reputation of being robust, hard-wearing and comfortable for children to wear to school, with many parents citing that the shoes, if worn sensibly and not used for tough playground games such as football, can last the whole school year (lasting from August‚ÄìJune in Scotland, and September‚ÄìJuly in England and Wales). Clarks continue to perform well in the school shoe market, recently, however, Clarks has come up towards fierce competitions from the likes of Start-rite, Hush Puppies, Geox and cheaper alternative school shoes from supermarkets such as Asda and Tesco. The Independent UK newspaper ranked Clarks as the number one provider of school shoes in the United Kingdom in 2017, highlighting that it has been providing quality shoes for over 170 years and highlighting the fact that Clarks is one of only a few manufacturer of school shoes to be provided in half sizes. The Independent also raised their own concerns ‚Äì teenagers in the United Kingdom have tended to associate Clarks shoes with being \\"uncool\\" in recent years, meaning parents may struggle to encourage their teenage aged children to wear Clarks for school purposes. Clarks, however, continues to sell well in the school shoe market in the United Kingdom for a variety of ages and reasons. Part of the reason, despite being long lasting and durable, parents have opted for Clarks school shoes for their children is that almost every Clarks design of school shoes has been classed as \\"acceptable\\" shoes in line with most primary and secondary school uniform policies. In recent years, notably in mid‚Äì2010s, schools have reviewed their uniform policies and have instead identified a few of Clarks designs for school shoes as being \\"unacceptable\\" and not complying with the school uniform policy of the school. In 2016, nationwide attention was gathered after 12 year old Alfie Ingerfeild from Bristol was sent home from school at the beginning of the new school term in September after wearing a pair of Harlem Spin shoes from Clarks' Bootleg school shoe range. The school, Mangotsfield School, claimed that the Harlem Spin design was \\"too much like trainers\\" and therefore classed them as unacceptable and not complying with the school uniform policy, so much so to the extent that the Deputy Head Teacher of Mangotsfield School said that should the shoes be worn the following school then the pupil would be asked to remove them and forced to wear shoes from lost property. This is despite the fact that the Harlem Spin shoes were advertised by Clarks as being school shoes ‚Äì Clarks did not give a statement in regards to the incident and questions over the design of the Harlem Spin shoes. In 2017, a particular style of Mary Jane shoes called \\"Dolly Babe\\" was compared unfavourably to Clarks' own \\"Leader\\" school shoe for boys, with parents and ministers both accusing the company of sexism and gender stereotypes ‚Äì the Mary Janes in question being viewed as flimsy and stereotypically feminine with a heart- print insole and a heart-shaped charm on the toebox while the boys' shoe was seen as sturdier. The company soon apologised over the matter and withdrew the shoe from sale. Clarks also issued a statement saying it would commit to designing \\"gender-neutral\\" footwear following customer feedback. In March 2018, two pupils from Kearsley Academy were sent home from school due to their school shoes, both purchased from Clarks, for \\"looking too much like trainers\\". The shoes in question were both purchased from Clarks' Bootleg range, a designated brand of school shoes from Clarks marketed for older children and teenagers.

During the 20th century, Clarks established a reputation for quality children's footwear. The crepe rubber soled Joyance T-bar sandal for both boys and girls was one of their most popular designs. Launched in 1933, it continued in production until 1972.Meridith, Gillian (2008), Buckles Shire Publications Ltd (p. 23) =Desert Boot= The Clarks Desert Boot The company's best known product is the Desert Boot ‚Äì a distinctive ankle height boot with crepe sole usually made out of calf suede leather traditionally supplied by Charles F Stead & Co tannery in Leeds. Officially launched in 1950 the Desert Boot was designed by Nathan Clark (great-grandson of James Clark). Nathan Clark was an officer in the Royal Army Service Corps posted to Burma in 1941 with orders to help establish a supply route from Rangoon to the Chinese forces at Chongqing whilst also launching a series of offensives throughout South East Asia. Before leaving home his brother Bancroft had given him the mission to gather any information on footwear that might be of use to the company whilst he was travelling the world. The Desert Boot was the result of this mission. His discovery of the Desert Boot was made either at Staff College in 1944 or on leave in Kashmir where three divisions of the old Eighth Army (transferred to the Far East from North Africa) were wearing ankle high suede boots manufactured in the bazaars of Cairo. Nathan sent sketches and rough patterns back to Bancroft, but no trials were made until after he returned to Street and cut the patterns himself. The Desert Boot was cut on the men's Guernsey Sandal last and sampled in a neutral beige-grey 2mm chrome bend split suede. The company's Stock Committee reacted badly to the sample and dismissed the idea as it ‚Äòwould never sell‚Äô. It was only in his capacity as Overseas Development Manager that Nathan had any success with the shoe after introducing it to Oskar Schoefler (Fashion Editor, Esquire Magazine) at the Chicago Shoe Fair in 1949. He gave them substantial editorial credits with colour photographs in Esquire in early 1950. Bronson Davies subsequently saw these articles and applied to represent the company in selling them across the US, long before they were available in the UK. The Desert Boot was initially sold in Britain through shops in Regent Street, featuring a Union Jack sewn into the label, targeted at tourists. Lance Clark is widely credited with popularising them in Europe during the 1960s. The Desert Boot have been manufactured at Shepton Mallet, small scale production having initially occurred at Street. During the course of time, Whitecross factory in Weston- Super-Mare was subcontracted to relieve Shepton factory of the manufacture of the Desert Boot, before the Bushacre factory at Locking Road, Weston-Super- Mare was constructed in 1958. The Desert Boot was manufactured there until closure of the factory in 2001. Clarks announced in July 2017, it was restarting manufacturing Desert Boots, using a new manufacturing unit featuring \\"robot-assisted\\" technology, at its headquarters in Street, Somerset. Up to 300,000 pairs a year of desert boots were to be made at the unit, creating up to eighty technical and managerial jobs. However, in January 2019 the company announced that this unit was to be closed, after failing to meet production targets.Beth Wright, Clarks to close cutting edge footwear factory dated 18 January 2019 at just-style.com The Clarks Wallabee =Wallabee= A pair of Clarks Wallabies. This particular pair was used as school shoes Produced by Clarks from 1967 and based on a moccasin called the Grashopper, launched in 1964, by the German company Sioux, the Wallabee brand was manufactured at the Padmore and Barnes factory based in Kilkenny, Ireland, which Clarks had acquired in 1963 and continued to operate until its closure in 1987, when it was the subject of a management buy-out. Managed by Lance Clark who was responsible for having negotiated the licence to produce the shoes in Kilkenny and arranged for the factory staff to be trained in the production of moccasin shoes, the product took off once the decision was taken to market it in North America in 1968. As General Manager of the factory, Paddy Roberts took the shoe to a trade fair in New York in the same year, whereupon he quickly learnt that the trademark Grasshopper had been licensed. In conjunction with Jack Rose-Smith (Clarks Overseas Shoes Export Manager), Bob Cullerton (the President for Clarks in America/Clarks of England), Hugh Woods (Managing Director of Clarks Canada), Roberts trademarked the name Wallabee. =Desert Trek= Another style associated with the Lance Clark who had seen a Zwartjes version of the shoe on the feet of artist, Sonja Landweer in the late 1960s. An artist in residence at the Kilkenny Design Workshops, where she had come into contact with Lance Clark, Landweer's shoes became the basis for production of the Trek which was first attempted at Clarks factory in Dundalk. This was more attuned to the construction of stitch-down footwear. The shoe was initially launched in North America in 1971 as Trek, before featuring in the UK range in 1972 where it was renamed Hike, owing to an existing footwear trademark. The ‚ÄòTrek man‚Äô that first featured on the shoe was drafted by Lance Clark and refined by the advertising manager in Dundalk, Bob Patten. Popular culture Some Clarks styles (particularly the Desert Boot, Wallabee & Desert Trek) were widely adopted as cultural icons by different subcultures and featured in songs as well as popular films and TV series. =Jamaica= The most referenced is the popularity of the Clarks shoes in Jamaica and the association with the Jamaican \\"rude boys\\" movement. According to DJ, producer and cultural historian Al Fingers in his book, Clarks in Jamaica, this trend started in the late 1960s when the emerging youth culture of the recently independent Jamaica adopted the Clarks shoes as part of their \\"uniform.\\" \\"The original gangster rude boy dem, a Clarks dem wear,\\" producer Jah Thomas tells Fingers in the book. \\"And in Jamaica a rude boy him nah wear cheap ting.\\" Writes Fingers, \\"In the early 70s, the rude boy/desert boot association became so strong that young males risked a beating by police simply for wearing a pair. 'You must be a thief,' the police would say. 'How else would you afford such expensive Clarks?'\\" He tells the story of an infamous Kingston police officer called Joe Williams, who carried out a raid on a dance being run by producer and label boss \\"Sir Coxsone\\" Dodd. The DJ Dennis Alcapone recalls the arrival of Superintendent Williams: \\"He tell the DJ to turn the sound down, and he say: 'All who's wearing Clarks booty, stand on that side of the dance. And who's not wearing Clarks booty stand on this side.' Because he knows that rude boys wear them, so that is a way of identifying them.\\" Reggae and dancehall stars Dillinger, Trinity, Ranking Joe, Scorcher, Little John, Super Cat and countless others had sung about Clarks in the past. Some of the most famous songs written about the Clarks shoes in Jamaica are Little John's \\"Clarks Booty\\" and Vybz Kartel‚Äôs \\"Clarks\\" (over 2.6 million hits on YouTube). =Mods= While the Clarks Desert Boots became fashionable in the Beatnik Culture in the US, they became popular with youth in the UK after being adopted by Sixties Mods who wore them as part of both smart and casual clothing outfits. While the shoes are appropriate for a unisex look, they were particularly popular with male mods who wore them with military parkas, tailor-made suits with narrow lapels (sometimes made of mohair), thin ties, button-down collar shirts, and wool or cashmere jumpers. =Paris riots= The joint influences of the Beatniks and Mods made the Clarks Desert Boots (\\"Les Clarks\\") popular among the Parisian students who wore them during the 1968 riots. The Clarks Desert Boots carried on through to the Mod Revival era of the Seventies and Eighties becoming a true Retro Mod Classic. They famously featured quite heavily in the 1979 \\"Quadrophenia\\", Franc Roddam‚Äôs film adaptation of the Who‚Äôs rock opera influencing in turn the Britpop movement of the 1990s. =Rappers= The Clarks Wallabees in particular were adopted in recent times by the American rapper community. Their appeal can be traced to a wave of Jamaican immigrants who came to New York in the 1970s and paired Clarks shoes with suits. \\"African-Americans saw it as an alternative to sneakers and jeans and incorporated it into their look,\\" said Slick Rick, a rapper, whose parents were born in Jamaica and later moved to the Bronx. \\"It's a way to be casual but not look like a scrub. The ladies like that.\\" The shoe was long a staple of fashionable West Indians in New York City but towards the 1990s had fallen out of favor in hip-hop circles who tended to gravitate toward Timberland boots or sneakers. The rebirth of the Clarks Wallabees as a cool staple from mid-late 1990s is linked with New York-based hip-hop group the Wu-Tang Clan. Wu members (RZA, GZA, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, U-God, Masta Killa, and the late Ol' Dirty Bastard) and in particular Raekwon and Ghostface Killah wore Wallabees because not only they found them aesthetically pleasing but also since no other rapper was wearing them, they showed that they weren't victims of the trends. They even featured the name of the shoe in the lyrics of several songs, engendering a revival of the Wallabees as a hip-hop staple by the mid-late 1990s. This justified Ghostface Killah to call himself Wally Champ and feature custom-dyed Wallabee shoes on the cover of his 1996 \\"Ironman\\" album. His 2008 compilation album was also called \\"The Wallabee Champ\\". =Breaking Bad= In the cult TV series, Breaking Bad, lead character Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston) morphs from a bland high school chemistry teacher into an all-powerful drug kingpin with trademark pork pie hat, black sunglasses and goatee, but he still wears Wallabees, just about the only shoe he wears from the beginning of the five-season series until its completion. Heritage The Shoe Museum in Street, Somerset. The Shoe Museum was established in 1950 by Laurence Barber at 40 High Street near the Clark's headquarters in Street, Somerset. Today the museum displays some 1,500 shoes as well as related exhibits, describing the development of shoes from Roman times and especially detailing the growth of Clarks shoes and shoemaking in Somerset. In 2002, a charity called the Alfred Gillett Trust was established to care for the archives and collections of C&J; Clark Ltd and the Clark family. Working closely with The Shoe Museum, the trust's collections include family and business archives, catalogues and sale materials, artwork and furniture, costume, film and sound archives, historic shoes and shoe making machinery. The trust is named after Alfred Gillett, a cousin of the company's founders and an amateur paleontologist; some of his fossils are included in the trust's collection. The trust is based at The Grange, a Grade II listed building close to the museum in Street.

It was the final section of the Great Eastern Railway branch line, later the London Underground's Central line from Loughton via Epping to Ongar, with intermediate stations at North Weald and Blake Hall. The line was closed by London Underground in 1994 and sold in 1998. It reopened between 2004 and 2007 as a preserved railway, offering a volunteer-run Class 117 DMU service between Ongar and Coopersale. A change of ownership in 2007 led to the line being closed for restoration to a heritage steam railway, which opened on 25 May 2012.  Early workings  The line to Ongar was opened in 1865 by the Great Eastern Railway, as an extension to its line from Stratford to Loughton that had been opened in 1856 by its predecessor, the Eastern Counties Railway. The extension was single-track, but whereas the Loughton to Epping section was doubled in the 1890s, the section between Epping and Ongar always remained single, apart from a passing loop at North Weald on opening. The eastern end of the loop was severed in 1888, converting it into a siding. About 14 trains each day went to Ongar; the rest terminated at Loughton or Epping. This remained the case until 1949, when the London Passenger Transport Board's New Works scheme extended the Central line to Epping using electric trains, taking over the railway from British Railways. The Epping-Ongar branch lost its through trains to London, and there was a shuttle service between Epping (to connect with trains to London) and Ongar; for eight years, there was the unusual sight of steam trains and London Underground electric multiple units side by side at Epping. The steam shuttle was hired by London Transport from British Railways, as it was felt there was no justification for electrification to Ongar unless patronage of the branch rose. Upon taking over the branch in 1949, London Transport re-converted the siding at North Weald into a passing loop and built a second platform to serve a new westbound track. In the 1950s, there were attempts to improve the service on the branch, and it was electrified in 1957.Taylor & Green 2002, p. 281. Due to the low- cost electrification, although the branch could support eight-car trains as far as North Weald, a maximum of four cars could run to Ongar. The voltage drop along the end-fed line was too great to support full-length trains, and the short platforms were not long enough to support eight-car trains. Hence the Epping to Ongar branch was normally operated as an isolated extension of the Central line, with a few through workings south to Loughton. However, for two days every year there were through trains from London to North Weald, for the North Weald airshow, on the Saturday and Sunday of its opening at the aerodrome almost adjacent to the station. The normal Epping to Ongar shuttle dovetailed with this service, passing the terminating trains on the adjacent line during its westbound journey. The through trains were operated as extra trains on the normal weekend Central line timetables, only four cars long due to the restricted platform length at North Weald.  Cutbacks and closure  Blake Hall station, rumoured to be used by only six customers a day at the time, was closed in 1981 and converted into a private residence. From the late 1960s, it became clear that the line's patronage was not growing as had been expected, mainly due to restriction of development in what was now designated Metropolitan Green Belt land. Even at its peak in 1971, the 650 passengers daily hardly made the line an economic proposition. London Underground tried to close the entire line in 1980, but a reduced service was implemented instead, along with the closing of Blake Hall on Sundays. North Weald's platform one was closed in 1976; then the passing loop/westbound track was lifted in 1978. Until that time, the station was controlled from the original Eastern Counties Railway signal box, which is still sited on the westbound platform, now fully restored. North Weald was the last section of the London Underground to be signalled with mechanical semaphore signals.Epping Ongar Railway Ltd. When Blake Hall was closed in 1981, it was said to be handling only six customers a day. The station building survives, without the platform, as a private dwelling. On 30 September 1994, the line was closed. It was making a loss of ¬£7 for each passenger journey and was in need of some expensive maintenance work. At the time of closure the line was carrying a mere 80 passengers a day. Local lore had it that the line was being kept open in case the Cabinet needed to be evacuated to the Kelvedon Hatch Secret Nuclear Bunker at Doddinghurst. The track was left intact along with the stations, but not maintained. The last Underground train used on the branch, a three-car unit of 1960 stock, has been preserved by Cravens Heritage Trains. It made a return to the reopened heritage railway in 2014, to mark the 20th anniversary of the line's closure by London Underground. One unusual feature of the line is its continuing nominal importance to the London Underground. In 1971/72 the London Underground was remeasured in kilometres. The then most easterly point, Ongar, was chosen as the zero point, and remains so to the present.  Purchase and reopening  The line was purchased by Pilot Developments (later Epping Ongar Railway Ltd) in 1998. The Ongar Railway Preservation Society entered a ¬£325,000 offer for the line, but Pilot Developments convinced London Underground to accept its slightly higher offer after the bidding deadline. Independent politician Martin Bell described the deal as \\"the most controversial land deal in the constituency for years\\", alleging a conflict of interest with local politicians. The line was reopened by the Epping Ongar Railway Volunteer Society on Sunday 10 October 2004, providing an hourly service between Ongar and North Weald. The line was shortly after extended to Coopersale, although there are no boarding or alighting facilities there. Between 22 January and 9 April 2006 the line was shut down for engineering works. This involved general station maintenance, rolling stock maintenance and track maintenance. Ongar station remained closed for engineering works and general maintenance and reopened on 28 May 2006 without the use of the station buildings. On Easter weekend 2007, the railway had the most visitors on a single day since reopening, on the Sunday and Monday. The Teddy Bears' Picnic, Anniversary of Reopening and Halloween events are also popular. At the end of 2007, as a result of the awarding of planning permission for the Ongar residential development, the railway was sold to a new private owner who was committed to bringing steam back to the line. Following the change of ownership in 2007, it was decided to suspend train operations and to concentrate on improving the track. This was done in order to undertake the major engineering works to secure its long-term future and facilitate the return of steam to the line, including restoration of station buildings, run-round loops, full signalling, and coal and water facilities. There have been major changes to the Ongar and North Weald stations. =Ongar= The station building at Ongar The booking office at Ongar Station The goods yard area (derelict since the 1960s) was purchased by David Wilson Homes, which has built a small collection of houses. The Cattle Dock remains, as does the main station building, which has been repainted in GER colours (1900‚Äì1930s). Ongar is the only operational GER station in GER colours. Shop and refreshment facilities are available in the main building. The milk dock is being restored into a bay platform, which will become Platform 2. All the track has been lowered to accommodate British Rail mainline rolling stock, and a new signal box has been installed at the end of platform 2 in the style of the original and incorporating the original signal frame, which was saved when the original box was demolished. Most of the points and signals are now connected to this. =North Weald= The station building at North Weald North Weald has been repainted in LNER/BR (E) (1940s‚Äì1960s) colours, Brunswick green and cream. The track height has been lowered to accommodate UK standard stock, and the track has been relaid through the loop and into the bay platform, making three operational platforms; the new signalling allows bi-directional working, gives access to improved siding facilities, and enables safer shunting. =Epping Forest= Railway track close to Epping tube station (Epping Forest Halt). Passengers cannot yet alight here due to the absence of a platform. The rail service has been extended from Coopersale to within a few hundred metres of the London Underground station.http://www.brentwoodgazette.co.uk/Heritage-line- extended-100m-Tube/story-26330101-detail/story.html It is impossible to alight at Epping, but the EOR intends to build a platform at the site. Resumption of passenger services In March 2012 Epping Ongar Railway announced a resumption of services from 25 May 2012, coinciding with the 150th year since the Great Eastern Railway was formed. On the weekend starting 25 May the railway operated a special service. It now runs train services every weekend and bank holiday in the summer; during the Olympics in July‚ÄìAugust 2012 at nearby Stratford, the line operated daily. EOR runs steam- and diesel-hauled trains between Ongar and North Weald, a diesel shuttle from North Weald to Coopersale Lane, and heritage bus services connecting with surrounding towns and the Central line at Epping.  Heritage railway operations  GNR 0-6-2T Class N2 No. 1744 runs round the train at Ongar During 2004‚Äì07 the line ran an hourly service on Sundays and Bank Holidays, on the hour from Ongar, arriving at North Weald at 13 minutes past the hour before departing for Coopersale, and returning to North Weald at 33 minutes past the hour, then leaving for Ongar. The first train left Ongar at 11:00, with the last returning at 15:50 (16:50 between April and September). Since reopening in 2012 there have been trains on Saturdays, Sundays, Bank Holidays and some school holiday weekdays. The summer timetable has trains until approximately 17:30, though from late October the last trains run at around 15:30. Current rolling stock Reference:  Plans of the EOR  Map of the London Underground, including the Epping Ongar Railway with the proposed interchange at Epping *Epping Glade: It is intended to extend trains to a new platform called Epping Glade near the London Underground's Epping tube station. This will require significant investment and discussions on this project are ongoing. *Coopersale Halt: The possibility of building a halt at Coopersale village is under consideration, subject to securing sufficient investment from outside sources and consultation with residents. *North Weald: As part of the infrastructure works the railway is restoring the former goods yard, giving much-needed siding space, and putting back full signalling with both semaphore and colour-light signals. This enables locomotive-hauled trains and gives operational flexibility, enabling increased service frequency. The former Woodford GER latticework footbridge has been completed, replacing the condemned LU concrete structure, which has been demolished and removed. *Ongar: With the track now relaid, works are progressing to restore the station and install signalling. Focus has turned to helping increase flexibility and service frequency, restoring the former cattle and milk platforms, all as part of the works towards running passenger trains to Epping. *Steam: The EOR is likely to be home for the new-build F5 for some time after completion, being a prototypical engine of the former Great Eastern branch. Guest locomotives, both steam and diesel, have appeared (with the reopening of the EOR in May 2012) from time to time.

He was born in his maternal home at Chetla in Alipore, a locality on the bank of Adi Ganga creek. When he was in Class IX, at around 15 years age, he became involved in secret revolutionary Indian independence movement. He also became involved in Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's Salt Satygraha movement which hampered his formal education. However he passed Matriculation Examination in 1930, and I.A. in 1932 from the South Suburban College (now Asutosh College). In 1933, he was admitted to B.A. in Scottish Church College. In 1934, first poem \\"Sraboney\\" was published in Desh. However he could not complete his B.A. due to his revolutionary and literary activities. In 1935, he took a job at Khayerbari Tea Estate and moved to Kurseong. There he became disillusioned with Gandhism and on return to Calcutta next year, he became inspired by communism and read writings of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Ralph Fox. In 1937, he created a stir with his poem Kaste (Sickle). He immortalized Kolkata's Clive Street in one of his poems: Here, in a hundred snake-like veins, Streams of people come and go. Through these shrunken veins the blood, Of the country must flow. O Mighty City's beating heart, O Clive Street of Bengal, A thousand dumb veins freeze to make, The cornerstone of your high hall.

He was governor of Britain between 52 and 57 AD. Career The career of Aulus Didius Gallus up to 51 can be partly reconstructed from an inscription from Olympia ( + ). He was quaestor under Tiberius, probably in 19\\\\. He served as a legate of the proconsul of Asia, as prefect of cavalry, and as proconsul of Sicily, although the dates of these appointments are unknown. He was curator aquarum (superintendent of aqueducts) from 38 to 49, consul in 39, and a member of the XVviri. He received triumphal regalia as an imperial legate under Claudius, probably in Bosporus: Tacitus records that he commanded forces there that were withdrawn in 49\\\\. After this he appears to have taken up another proconsular appointment, possibly in Asia or Africa. His later career is described by Tacitus. In 52 he was made governor of Britain, following the death in office of Ostorius Scapula, at a time when the situation was deteriorating as a result of a string of rebellions. The south-east was securely held, but despite the defeat of Caratacus the previous year, the tribes of what is now Wales, particularly the Silures, continued to hold out. Venutius' first insurrection against Queen Cartimandua of the Brigantes occurred during Didius' rule and he despatched troops under Caesius Nasica to aid her. Didius acted to quell the rebels rather than enlarge the empire during his rule, which lasted until AD 57\\\\. Although criticised by Tacitus as being reactive and defensive, he was probably acting on instructions from Claudius who did not consider the benefits of further conquest in difficult terrain to be great enough to warrant the risk. Instead, Didius built roads and forts at the borders such as those at Usk to contain the native population. After five years in the post, covering the last two years of the reign of Claudius and the first three of Nero, Didius was replaced by Quintus Veranius. Quintilian tells us that, after several years of campaigning for a provincial governorship, Didius complained at the province he was offered, although whether this refers to Sicily or Britain is unknown. The orator Domitius Afer sarcastically advised him to think of his country. The next governor of Britain, Quintus Veranius, says on his tombstone that he took the job \\"although he did not seek it\\", which has been interpreted as a barbed comment on Didius. Eponym of Cardiff The modern city of Cardiff in Wales is often stated to be named for Didius. The earliest Welsh name for the city, Caerdyf combines the elements Caer (fort) which refers to the Roman fort established around 75 AD, and a second element which is less certain. The antiquarian William Camden recorded the origin of the name as \\"Caer-Didi\\" (Didius' Fort). This derives from local beliefs that Didius had built the fort before the arrival of Frontinus in Britain and his construction of numerous supplementary fortifications in South Wales. Though most modern linguists dismiss this derivation, the Didius connection has remained popular throughout the centuries, appearing in Camden's Britannia (1586), The Beauties of England and Wales (1815), and the writings of Iolo Morganwg and Taliesin Williams. Relatives Aulus Didius Gallus Fabricius Veiento, who was praetor in 62, is almost certainly a relative, and likely to have been his son or grandson.

It is based in Dublin, New Hampshire and has a year-round office in San Francisco, California. Since its founding in 1972, the Walden School has operated the Young Musicians Program, a 5-week long summer camp and concert series, which is the only summer program dedicated specifically to young composers in the United States. Students aged 9 to 18 study musical composition, along with a unique curriculum of music theory, specialty electives, and chorus. In 2011 the Walden School began running the Creative Musicians Retreat, an 8-day long program for adult musicians from all backgrounds to study choral music, composition, performance, and pedagogy. Both programs take place on the campus of the Dublin School, and they both feature visiting professional ensembles who help to perform new music written by participants, as well as composers-in-residence who inspire and mentor the participants. The Young Musicians Program also puts on a choral concert at the conclusion of the program. Along with participants from the United States, in recent years attendees have come from countries such as Cyprus, Israel, Mexico, China, India, Estonia, Canada, Serbia, and Venezuela. History The Walden School was co-founded in 1972 by David Hogan, Pamela Layman Quist, and Lynn Taylor Hebden following the death of Grace Newsom Cushman, the founder of the Junior Conservatory Camp (also commonly referred to as the \\"JCC\\"). The JCC was founded in the 1940s in Baltimore, Maryland, and was considered the spiritual predecessor camp of The Walden School. The Walden School, which began in Reisterstown, Maryland, was situated on the campus of the Mountain School from 1976 to 1982, a small rural private boarding school in Vershire, Vermont. In 1983, due to the impending sale of the Mountain School, Walden moved to the Dublin School in Dublin, New Hampshire, where it has been held ever since. On July 17, 1996, David Hogan was one of the victims of the TWA Flight 800 crash. Methodology =Philosophy= The Walden academic curriculum and teaching methodology is based on a core philosophy which employs a comprehensive and organic approach to learning music, emphasizing creativity in all aspects of the curriculum. The Walden School's general philosophy defines music as \\"sound organized in time.\\" =Musicianship= In the Walden School's Musicianship Course students simultaneously learn singing, playing, writing, and improvising music. The Musicianship course teaches the elements of music more or less in the order that they were developed, and starts with the existential question of \\"what is music?\\" Students then proceed through a process of discovery beginning with the overtone series and improvisations inside the piano. This method of teaching musicianship breaks with conventional methods of music education, most notably in The Walden School's teaching of intervals and modes before teaching functional harmony. The Walden School has recently published a textbook titled The Walden School Musicianship Course: A Manual for Teachers about its methodology. =Composition = Walden School alumni see Walden as a \\"composition camp\\", although technically composition is not at the core of the Walden curriculum. The method employed by composition teachers depends on the level of the student. In beginner classes comprising new and inexperienced students, a more improvisation-oriented approach is taken. More advanced classes take an open- ended approach, in that students are encouraged to compose any style they please while simultaneously receiving guidance from their composition teacher on orchestration and notation techniques. =Computer music= Computer music was added to the Walden School Musicianship and Composition curriculum in 2000, when a computer lab was first installed. The lab uses Apple Power Mac computers, each supplied with Digidesign Mbox hardware and Reaper software. Students use a Digital Audio Tape (DAT) recorder with a stereo microphone to record sounds, and then later upload these recordings to the Power Macs and begin composing electronic pieces primarily using Reaper software. Other popular pieces of software used among Walden School students to manipulate the sounds they record are Soundhack. Max/MSP is a more sophisticated digital audio signal processing application and is used exclusively among the Walden School faculty. = Faculty Commissioning Project = The Walden School Faculty are active composers, performers and educators.

A graduate of Harvard College and Yale Law School, he served as Dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School from 1979 to 1982,In Memoriam: James O. Freedman1935-2006 before becoming the 16th president of the University of Iowa from 1982 to 1987, and then the 15th president of Dartmouth College, from 1987 to 1998. At both Iowa and Dartmouth, Freedman sought to create as The New York Times described it, \\"a haven for intellectuals,\\" with mixed results.  University of Iowa Presidency  Freedman's tenure at the University of Iowa was marked by his support for a $25 million laser research center. In his words, \\"The University of Iowa can grasp the opportunity for national and world leadership in laser science.\\"https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50715F9355E0C708CDDAB0994DE484D81 Freedman argued that the laser would become a magnet for research grants from Federal and International agencies, and the Iowa legislature appropriated the $25 million necessary to build the center. The center was unable to attract significant research funding, however, after it was completed.  Dartmouth Presidency  His administration was marked by numerous academic initiatives, a growth of the physical campus, and a strengthening of Dartmouth's graduate programs and professional schools. A small but vocal number of alumni viewed the initiatives the \\"Harvardization of Dartmouth.\\" President Freedman established or revitalized programs in Latin American, Latino, and Caribbean Studies; Environmental Studies; Jewish Studies; and Linguistics and Cognitive Science. He introduced or restored the teaching of the Arabic, Hebrew, and Japanese languages, founded the Institute of Arctic Studies, and incorporated into the curriculum majors in Women's Studies and African and African-American Studies. During his administration, Dartmouth achieved gender parity in the student body. In the professorial ranks the College led the Ivy League with the highest proportion of women among tenured and tenure-track faculty. Freedman also presided over the largest capital campaign in Dartmouth's history, the \\"Will to Excel\\" campaign, which raised $568 million, exceeding the original $425 million goal. His administration saw the addition of state- of-the-art buildings for the Computer Sciences, Chemistry, and Psychology, as well as The Roth Center for Jewish Life and the Rauner Special Collections Library. Shortly before he stepped down in 1998, ground was broken for the Baker-Berry Library project, a pioneering model for access to books and electronic information in the 21st century. The author of Idealism and Liberal Education, Freedman became a spokesman for the importance of the liberal arts. President Freedman died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on March 21, 2006.  Criticism  The one event in Freedman's presidency that garnered the most press was the so-called \\"Hitler Quote\\" scandal of The Dartmouth Review in 1990. A member of the staff of the controversial conservative weekly paper inserted a quote from Mein Kampf into the masthead of one edition of the paper. This edition of the Review was dated on Yom Kippor, the holiest day in the Jewish year. In the same edition, the paper also printed a drawing of Freedman as Hitler. The paper's editor discovered the quote three days after the paper was distributed, pulled available copies, and issued a campus-wide apology, but the quotation was seen as the latest in a series of attention- getting stunts that were either provocative or offensive depending on the reader's point of view. Freedman's administration undertook the building of the \\"second Green\\" in an attempt to create a genuine sense of intellectual community at the College. George Mason law professor Todd Zywicki, a Dartmouth alum (and trustee) later referred to Freedman as a \\"truly evil man\\" whose \\"agenda was to turn Dartmouth into Harvard.\\"Todd Zywicki, Speech to Pope Institute, Raleigh, N.C., October 2, 2007 Former Dartmouth Senior Fellow William C. Dowling, noting that the danger of Dartmouth's ever becoming like Harvard was exceedingly remote, characterized Zywicki's remark as typical of a \\"brutal philistinism too often associated with the Dartmouth name.\\" Dartmouth's Board of Trustees publicly repudiated any association with Zywicki's sentiments. On December 18, 2007, head of the Board Ed Haldeman (Dartmouth '70) issued a statement noting that \\"Mr. Zywicki has a apologized to members of the Freedman family and indicated that he would like to retract other parts of his speech.\\" Statement on Zywicki.PDF Zywicki was not reelected to the Board.

The district is located in the eastern part of the city, directly east of downtown Wiesbaden, and has about 12,300 inhabitants. Formerly an independent municipality, the town was incorporated into Wiesbaden on April 1, 1928. While Bierstadt can be translated Beer Town, the name is actually derived from Saint Brigid of Kildare, Ireland (Birgid in German). History 200px The earliest traces of settlement in the Bierstadt area date to the Stone Age. However, Bierstadt was first mentioned in historical records, as \\"Birgidestad\\", in a deed of gift on March 12, 927. The town was founded by Irish monks, who named it after the Irish national saint, St. Brigid. In the 11th‚Äì12th centuries, the (now Protestant) Church of St. Nicholas was built. The church is not only the oldest existing church in Wiesbaden, but, after the Roman-era Heathens' Wall in downtown Wiesbaden, is the second oldest building of any kind in the city. In the Middle Ages, Bierstadt came under the dominion of Nassau, but was subject to strong influences from the Archdiocese of Mainz. In the wake of the Reformation, Bierstadt came fully under the control of Nassau. After the Thirty Years' War, the town had only 17 inhabitants. Efforts at reconstruction were set back through a fire in 1691. By the middle of the 18th century, Bierstadt had about 500 residents. The remains of a medieval watchtower, the Bierstadter Warte, are located on a height between Wiesbaden and the district. The Warte is now part of the coat of arms. In 1898, a large observation tower, the Wiesbaden Bismarck Tower, was planned to be built at this site. A temporary wooden tower was constructed in 1910, but funding for the permanent structure could not be obtained. The temporary tower was demolished in 1918. During the Third Reich, Nazism dominated in Bierstadt. On November 9, 1938, the Bierstadt synagogue, dating to 1827, was destroyed. After World War II, about 1800 homes were built in Bierstadt for occupation forces of the United States Army. The Aukamm and Crestview developments are located on the northwest and west side of Bierstadt, respectively. Infrastructure Bierstadt has a library and two schools, including one primary school - Grundschule Bierstadt, and a gymnasium named Theodor-Fliedner-Schule which was formerly a middle school. Bierstadt is next to the Aukammtal and has access to the German Federal Route 455. Bierstadt has two churches. In addition to the Protestant church (formerly the church of St. Nicholas), there is the Roman Catholic church of St. Birgid. Twinning Since 1991, Bierstadt has had a partnership with the French commune of Terrasson-Lavilledieu. The town of Terrasson is located on the banks of the V√©z√®re in southwestern France, about 150 km east of Bordeaux in the heart of Aquitaine, with which Hesse maintains a regional partnership.

It was incorporated into Wiesbaden on April 10, 1928. The population is around 9,000..Official homepage of the city Wiesbaden (in German). Erbenheim has a tower named Erbenheimer Warte, part of a series of watchtowers built in the late 15th Century. Lucius D. Clay Kaserne, a United States Army installation, is located just south of Erbenheim and is also known as Milit√§rflugplatz-Erbenheim. Adjoining districts and characteristics Adjoining districts are Biebrich, Bierstadt, Igstadt, Mainz-Kastel, Nordenstadt und S√ºdost. The nearby U.S. Army airfield Clay Kaserne is situated towards the districts Delkenheim and Nordenstadt. In the Middle Ages Erbenheim was an autonomous city. The Erbenheimer Warte, which is located already in the area of Mainz-Kastel, was in medieval times a watchtower of the Territorial Army of Mainz.Erbenheimer Warte The former race track of Wiesbaden is barely to perceive, you just can imagine it based on the remaining street Rennbahnstra√üe. Close to the townhall a public scale is situated, which is still in use. Erbenheim is the starting point of a road network for bikers. Additionally all the country lanes are almost car-free. A trip on this country lanes is worth seeing. A certain route passes Dom√§ne Mechthildshausen and the military airport up to the Nassau meadow with scattered fruit trees. Starting from this point a road network for bikers is extended towards Hochheim, Kostheim and Kloppenheim. These facilities are regularly used by cyclists, inline-skaters and walkers. In the village itself several catering businesses are established, covering a wide range of products in very different price segments. In the village there are several small shops, several butchers and bakeries, but also big supermarkets and bottle shops. The commercial area Kreuzberger Ring provides a direct freeway connection. Here are many service providers located, so that Erbenheim also offers a lot of attractive jobs. History Erbenheim stands on a historic ground. Especially the archaeological excavations have shown how densely populated the area around the stream W√§schbach was already early in its history respectively 5000 years before Christ. From the 2nd to the 4th century after Christ, the Romans finally settled down in the area of Erbenheim. Many Roman finds and Roman estates along the W√§schbach suggest that the Romans lived there until the late 4th century after Christ. 927 Erbenheim is first mentioned in the document for St. Ursula in Cologne, which is also meaningful for some suburbs of Wiesbaden. 1423 Emperor Sigismund vests the town charter in Erbenheim. After the Thirty years war Erbenheim develops itself to an important agricultural community, in which wine-growing and sheep farming is very common. The large taverns in Erbenheim were not only for the inhabitants, but also for the citizens of the surrounding towns always great attractions - not least because the visitors of the famous horse racings in Erbenheim, which was carried out between 1907 and 1910, liked to have stopped off for a pint in one of the many taverns in Erbenheim. The race track of Erbenheim was opened in 1910 and turned into a civilian airport in 1929. The electric tram was introduced first in 1906 and available between the city center of Wiesbaden and Erbenheim. At the same time the electric light was enabled in Erbenheim, which could be turned on for the first time in October 1908. In 1937 the tram service was folded. Busses provided the passenger transport from now on. In the Medieval times the strong Saint Paul Lutheran Church was built in the old town of Erbenheim. From 1834 to 1835, today's townhall of Erbenheim was initially built as a school. First in 1926 the building became the town hall. The actual school, which is nowadays still in use and called Justus-von-Liebig-Schule, was built in 1900. 1928 follows the incorporation of the city of Wiesbaden. Besides the above- mentioned Justus-von-Liebig-Schule, which is an elementary school, the district Erbenheim has also another school, which is called Hermann-Ehlers- Schule and sees itself as an integrated comprehensive school since 1992. Traffic The train station of Erbenheim is located 400 meter West of the town hall and connects the district with the central station in Wiesbaden. Train station of Erbenheim Also Niedernhausen in the Taunus is available by this rail connection. As part of the renovation of the railway stations a relocation of the station towards the Berliner Strasse took place in order to shorten the distances from the bus stations to the town center. (in German) Furthermore, Wiesbaden-Erbenheim has a great connection to the road network. Thus, the federal highway 455 leads through the west of the district. Erbenheim has also convenient access to the Rhine-Main-expressway, a section of the national highway A66, that runs along south-east of Erbenheim and connects it with Wiesbaden and Frankfurt am Main.  Social awareness  = Old people = Since 1986, in Erbenheim exists an institution, called pluspunkt, which offers in Wiesbaden and the surrounding area a wide range of services for people, who have to deal with the aging process. This work is supported by the Protestant Paul's Community Erbenheim and the Protestant Dean of Wiesbaden. There is no denominational boundary or an age limit, everybody is welcome and can introduce his own ideas and desires and get involved. = Children = Erbenheim has had a huge daycare center for children since 1997. It provides care of 116 children.Official homepage of the city Wiesbaden (in German). at the age of 0.5 years until 12 years. The daycare center offers four different groups for the different age classes.

He served under Julius Caesar for ten years, during the Gallic Wars and the civil war of the 40s. Caesar praised him for his strategic sense and courageous integrity.Vir consilii magni et virtutis (Bellum Gallicum 3.5.2). Military service During the Gallic War Volusenus served as Tribunus Militum in the 12th Legion under the legate Servius Galba, and distinguished himself in battle when Galba was defeated by the Nantuates in 57 BC.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 3.5 In 55 BC Volusenus was sent out by Caesar in a single warship to undertake a week- long survey of the coast of south eastern Britain prior to Caesar's invasion.Commentarii de Bello Gallico 4.21 He probably examined the Kent coast between Hythe and Sandwich. When Caesar set off with his troops however he arrived at Dover and saw that landing would be impossible. Instead he travelled north and landed on an open beach, probably near Walmer. Volusenus had evidently failed to find a suitable harbour, which would have prevented the damage Caesar's exposed ships would suffer at high tide. The great natural harbour at Richborough, a little further north, was used by Claudius in his invasion just 100 years later, but we do not know whether Volusenus travelled that far, or indeed whether it existed in a suitable form at that time (our knowledge of the geomorphology of the Wantsum Channel that created that haven is limited). Volusenus later became Praefectus Equitum (cavalry commander). In 53 BC, during the revolt of Ambiorix, he was sent ahead by Caesar with cavalry to relieve Quintus Cicero, who was besieged by the Sugambri in Atuatuca, but found it difficult to convince the terrified defenders that the rest of Caesar's army was not far behind.Commentarii de Bello Gallico 6.41 When the legate Titus Labienus suspected Commius, the formerly loyal king of the Atrebates, of conspiring against them in the winter of 54 or 53 BC, he invited him to a meeting and sent Volusenus and some centurions to execute him for his treachery. Commius escaped, but sustained a wound to the head.Commentarii de Bello Gallico 8.23 In 51 BC Volusenus was serving as commander of cavalry under Mark Antony, and in the winter of that year was ordered by Antony to pursue Commius, who was conducting a campaign of agitation and guerrilla warfare. He defeated him in several skirmishes, and finally destroyed Commius's forces in a single engagement, although at the cost of a spear-wound to the thigh. S.P. Oakley sees this encounter as an unusual example of single combat in the Late Republic, echoing duels between Romans and physically superior Celts in the Early Republic.Like those in which T. Manlius Torquatus and M. Valerius Corvus earned their respective cognomina; S.P. Oakley, \\"Single Combat in the Roman Republic,\\" Classical Quarterly 35 (1985), p. 396. Commius himself escaped and later sued for peace on the condition that he never again had to meet a Roman.Commentarii de Bello Gallico 8.48 In 48 BC, during the Civil War, an attempt to assassinate Volusenus was made by Aegus and Roscillus, two noble brothers of the Celtic Allobroges who had served in Caesar's cavalry throughout the Gallic Wars. The brothers had been caught defrauding their comrades of pay and decided to defect to Pompey's side. The death of Volusenus was meant to render Pompey useful service, but the task proved too difficult, and they were forced to defect without any such token.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Civili 3.59-61 Ronald Syme noted that Volusenus's decade-long tour of duty might have been uncommon for a man of his equestrian social rank, many of whom \\"owed their commissions less to merit than to the claims of friendship and influence or the hope of procuring gain and political advancement.\\" The exemplary career of Volusenus, like that of Decidius Saxa, indicates that even in the Late Republic an equestrian might choose to excel as a career officer rather than as a publican or businessman.Ronald Syme, The Roman Revolution (Oxford University Press, 1939, reissued 2002), pp. 70‚Äì71 online and 355. Volusenus is one of only three ranking officers to whom Caesar ascribes the quality of virtus.The other two are Quintus Cicero and Titus Labienus; Myles Anthony McDonnell, Roman manliness: virtus and the Roman Republic (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 308 online. Political career? Based on a \\"hopelessly corrupt\\" readingJohn R. King, The Fourteen Philippic Orations of Marcus Tullius Cicero (Oxford, 1878), p. 262 online. of one of Cicero's speeches against Mark Antony,Cicero, Philippics 14.3. Volusenus was sometimes identified by 19th- century scholars as a tribune of the plebs in 43 BC.Orelli conjectured that the passage should read alii praetorem, tribunum Volusienum, ego. \\"It has been assumed that this man is C. Volusenus Quadratus ‚Ä¶ but this is mere guessing,\\" notes George Long, M. Tullii Ciceronis orationes (London, 1858), vol. 4, p. 704 online. The passage, and Volusenus's documented loyalty to Caesar, was thus interpreted to mean that he was a supporter of Mark Antony, but two other manuscripts indicate that the proper noun is in fact a verb (voluissent) and neither Cicero nor any other source mentions Volusenus among Antony's followers.John Richard King, The Philippic Orations of Marcus Tullius Cicero (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1878, 2nd ed.), p. 336 online. T.R.S. Broughton does not record a plebeian tribunate for Volusenus in The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, confirming only that Volusenus was a military tribune in 56Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 3.5.2. and held the rank of praefectus equitum in 52‚Äì51Aulus Hirtius, Bellum Gallicum 8.48; Cassius Dio 40.43.1. and again in 48.Broughton reassessed Volusenus's career in light of Syme's observations (see above) for the publication of volume 3 of The Magistrates of the Roman Republic (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1984), p. 224. See also MRR2 (1952), pp. 212, 239, 246 (where the nomen is incorrectly given as Volusius), and 284. Broughton originally had counted the Volusenus who was tribune in 56 and the prefect Volusenus Quadratus as two different men. He excludes the vexed passage in the Phillippics. Italian origin The name Volusenus may be Etruscan in origin (as Volasenna), but some scholars have attributed an Umbrian origin to the family, based on inscriptional evidence.Elizabeth Rawson, Roman Culture and Society: Collected Papers (Clarendon Press, 1991), p. 321.

He was mayor of Madrid between 2003 and 2011. A stalwart of the conservative People's Party (PP), he has previously been a leading figure in various local and national legislative bodies. In December 2011 Ruiz-Gallard√≥n was appointed Minister of Justice in Mariano Rajoy's inaugural cabinet. He resigned in September 2014. Early life and education Ruiz-Gallard√≥n was born in Madrid. His father, Jos√© Mar√≠a Ruiz Gallard√≥n, was a member of the leadership of the People's Alliance (AP), precursor to the present-day People's Party. He attended secondary school in Madrid at the Jesuit School Nuestra Se√±ora del Recuerdo, and then studied law at the Universidad San Pablo CEU. He is married to Mar√≠a del Mar Utrera, who is the daughter of Jos√© Utrera Molina, a former Minister of the Franco regime. They have four sons: Alberto, Jos√©, Ignacio and Rodrigo. Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon is a cousin of Trinidad Jim√©nez, the former Foreign Affairs Minister of Spain, and C√©cilia Attias, former First Lady of France. He is the great-grandchild of the composer Isaac Alb√©niz. Political life As a lawyer, Ruiz-Gallard√≥n sat for exams to begin a career as a prosecutor at the age of 23. He attained the position, ranking second in the twenty eighth year. He was given a position in the M√°laga Provincial Court, where he served for a short time until given leave to take charge of the party's legal counsel. In May 1983 he was elected to Madrid city council. In February 1986, at the party's Seventh National Congress, he joined its Executive Committee. In the same year, he ran unsuccessfully as a Senate candidate for Palencia in the general elections but finished fifth, 301 votes behind the successful PSOE candidate, in a district where four candidates were elected.Spanish Senate election results In the aftermath, the secretary general of his party, Jorge Verstrynge, retired and Ruiz-Gallard√≥n became the interim secretary general until the Party Congress could convene. His next political position was in December 1986, when the regional leadership of AP in Madrid nominated him as candidate for the presidency of the Autonomous Community of Madrid with no eventual success. In February 1987, the Eighth Extraordinary Congress of the AP appointed Antonio Hern√°ndez Mancha as chairman. Ruiz-Gallard√≥n left his interim general secretary position and was named one of the four vice-chairmen of the party. Ruiz-Gallard√≥n was elected Deputy of the Madrid Assembly on 10 June 1987. Only one month later, he was elected to the Senate in the delegation designated by the Madrid Assembly and named spokesman of the AP Parliamentary Group body. On 22 October 1988 Ruiz-Gallard√≥n resigned his party positions as the result of a misunderstanding with chairman Mancha over an agreement with the Democratic and Social Centre (Spain) regarding Assembly rules. At the party's Ninth Congress in January 1989, Mancha was replaced as chairman by Manuel Fraga. The party was re-founded as the People's Party (PP), and Ruiz-Gallard√≥n was appointed to the National Executive Committee and became president on the Committee for Conflicts and Discipline. Following the general elections on 29 October 1989, Ruiz-Gallard√≥n continued serving as a senator for Madrid and, as in the previous legislature, headed the PP Parliamentary Group in the Senate. He returned to the PP's National Executive Committee at the Tenth Congress, this time with Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar as party chairman. He also retained his position as president of the Committee on Conflicts. In April 1990, he headed an internal investigation of the Caso Naseiro. This investigation resulted in the expulsion of several party officials. First among his party's candidates for the Senate in Madrid in the general elections of June 6, 1993, Ruiz- Gallard√≥n was once again elected to the Senate. He continued as Spokesman of the PP Parliamentary Group, and subsequently resigned his corresponding position in the Madrid Assembly. President of the Community of Madrid On May 28, 1995 Ruiz Gallard√≥n ran for the presidency of the Community of Madrid on a PP ticket, securing a majority of seats in the Assembly for the first time. He was elected President of the Community of Madrid by the Madrid Assembly one month later. Ruiz Gallard√≥n ran for re-election in the 1999 elections, again securing a majority of seats. During his tenure as regional president, Ruiz Gallard√≥n garnered a high degree of popularity, because of his apparently moderate attitude, especially compared to several leaders of his party. Following Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar's announcement that he would not seek re- election as Prime Minister in 2004, Gallard√≥n was one of the PP leaders that were mentioned as a possible successor by the mainstream media. Mayor of Madrid Encouraged by the Prime Minister Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar, Gallard√≥n became the PP's candidate for the Madrid mayoral election of 2003. He was successful in his bid, obtaining a majority of the votes. One of his first decisions was to increase city taxes as a means to back his future plans for the city. Nicknamed ironically the \\"Pharaoh\\" by many locals, the mayor has created an urban renewal plan for Madrid that included the undergrounding of parts of the M30 motorway, the redevelopment of the Manzanares River bank, a push for the virtual gentrification of dwindling historic downtown areas, and a reform of the existing finance laws. In fact, the Madrid bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics figured as the most ambitious component of his plan despite being planned by his predecessor, Jos√© Mar√≠a √Ålvarez del Manzano. Several other projects, such as the four skyscrapers under construction in the old training grounds of Real Madrid, have boosted his urban plans. In May 2006, Baroness Carmen Cervera publicly demonstrated against his plan to reform Paseo del Prado, as the baroness feared for the effects on her co-managed Museo Thyssen- Bornemisza. 2008 developments Ruiz-Gallard√≥n had been considered as a leading candidate for the future leader of the PP, his moderate views making him one of the most popular politicians in the opinion polls, rivalling the President of the Community of Madrid, Esperanza Aguirre, in the leadership race. In the period leading up to the 2008 general election, Ruiz-Gallard√≥n announced his intention to be placed in the Madrid (Spanish Congress Electoral District) congressional list of the PP. Being a mayor, his inclusion in the list would have been an exceptional move as the Party by-laws ban mayors of cities with over 100,000 inhabitants from running for the Congress of Deputies. This move was not approved by Aguirre who announced her intention to resign as President of Madrid in order to run for National Deputy as well (Members of the regional legislatures are barred from the Cortes Generales). On 15 January 2008 Mr Rajoy (leader of the PP) announced that Mr. Gallard√≥n would not be included in the PP lists for General Elections. Mrs. Aguirre had won the intense internal battle with Mr. Gallard√≥n. Following this announcement, Mr. Ruiz-Gallard√≥n indicated his intention to retire from politics, although the next day he softened his response, and said he will \\"reflect\\" on his political future after the March 2008 General Elections. Gallard√≥n renunciar√° a la pol√≠tica tras ser excluido por Rajoy de las listas del 9-M, El Mundo, 16-1-2008 Third term. Mayor and deputy Alberto Ruiz- Gallard√≥n again won an absolute majority of 31 seats out of 57 in Madrid City Council in the municipal elections of 2011, defeating the socialist candidate Jaime Lissavetzky, who had been State Secretary for sports until then. IU increased its representation from 5 to 6 seats, PSOE lost 3 of its 18 seats and UPyD, that won 5 seats, become a member of the Madrid City Council for the first time in its history. Ruiz-Gallard√≥n was elected Deputy to Congress for Madrid in the Spanish general election of 2011. He was placed 4th on the People's Party list of candidates, choosing to be fourth on the list as a tribute to his father, who had occupied the same place. Alongside Ruiz- Gallard√≥n, other 18 members of that list won a seat in the Spanish Congress of Deputies. Minister of Justice On 21 December 2011 he was appointed Minister of Justice by Mariano Rajoy, to form part of the first government of the PP after its victory in the general elections held on 20 November 2011. On the same day he was appointed Minister, on 22 December 2011, he left his office as Mayor of Madrid, being replaced ad interim by the deputy Mayor, Manuel Cobo. On 27 November 2011, with 31 votes for, the Plenary of the Council elected Ana Botella as his successor. Los 31 votos del PP le bastan a Ana Botella para ser alcaldesa de Madrid At his first Parliamentary appearance as Minister of Justice, he announced his intention to reform the abortion law approved by the previous Zapatero government, a law based on time limits, the same as the ones existing in most European countries, widely criticized by the Catholic Church and by the People's Party (in particular in relation to the group comprising young people aged about 16‚Äì18 years, who could legally get an abortion despite the opposition of their parents) to return to the 1985 law, by which a woman had to invoke some reason to justify her decision. He also announced his intention to change the way the 12 judges called vocales of the General Council of the Judiciary were elected, returning to the old direct election system by the judges, dropped in 1995 (with a slight modification passed in 2001 during the former PP government, headed by Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar, thanks to the consensus reached with the PSOE, that established the election by the Courts from a list of 31 candidates submitted by the associations of judges) because the 12 vocales were filled up with only one association of judges, the prevalent and conservative Professional Association of Magistrates. As regards the Same Gender Marriage law, introduced by the former socialist government in 2004 to legalize gay and lesbian couples marriage, very criticized by the Catholic Church and by the People's Party, that join the demonstrations promoted \\"in defense of the family\\", Ruiz Gallard√≥n said that the government would await the decision of the Constitutional Court about the appeal lodged by the People's Party as soon as the law was passed by the Courts. On 30 May 2012, the government announces the approval of a draft law, developed by the Ministry of Justice, by which court fees will be raised between 50 and 750 euros. Its purpose is, according to the government, to alleviate the saturation of the courts and, at the same time, to assume the costs of legal aid, as well as to prevent conflicts that could be resolved through other means reach the courts. But, according to the opposition, this rise restricts the access of both middle-income and low-income citizens to judicial administration. The highest increases were registered in the area of the \\"second instance\\", in order, according to the government, to reduce the actions that seeks solely to prolong the procedure, as well as to reduce the burden on judicial organs. Thus, appeals in civil and contentious- administrative matters rises to 500 euros and the matching processes in those same areas are increased from 600 to 1200 euros. With respect to the Labour Court, appeal and cassation cases, which until now were free, will have charges of 500 and 700 euros, respectively. As for the complaint brought by Jos√© Manuel Ben√≠tez, member of the General Council of the Judiciary, against his president, Carlos D√≠var, for suspected misusing of public funds (he would have spent about 6000 euros on travels to Puerto Ban√∫s and hotels, fact that he did not deny, but alleged its official character) finally dismissed, Ruiz Gallard√≥n opposed the petition for the appearance of D√≠var before the Congress of Deputies, filed by IU (and also subscribed by the PSOE at the last minute), alleging that there is no reason why the president of the CGDG has to go to the Parliament, because the Parliament is not competent to exercise the political control over the government body of the judiciary, but that the responsibilities of the members of the judiciary must only be required within the General Council of the Judiciary itself. In November 2012, Gallard√≥n justified the Government's amnesty to four members of the Catalan police forces stating that \\"the right of pardon is power of the Government\\". The four policeman had previously been judged and found guilty of torturing a citizen, and sentenced to four years in prison each. On 23 September 2014 he resigned as Minister of Justice and announced his retirement from politics. His decision came after his controversial bill on abortion had been rejected by the Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy. He also renounced to his parliamentary seat at the Congress of Deputies. The vacant seat was taken by Valentina Mart√≠nez Ferro.  Lezo case  On 26 April 2018, he was imputed by the judge for his involvement in the corruption scandal Case Lezo, which involves leaders of the PP in the Community of Madrid.El juez cita a Alberto Ruiz-Gallard√≥n como investigado en el ‚Äòcaso Lezo‚Äô One year later, on 30 May 2019, he was absolved together with eight of his advisors which were also being investigated.El juez del ‚Äòcaso Lezo‚Äô levanta la imputaci√≥n de Alberto Ruiz-Gallard√≥n See also *Holmes & Watson.

Dartmouth Presidency  At the dedication of the Hopkins Center for the Arts in 1962, the speaker, then-Governor of New York Nelson A. Rockefeller, turned to the man for whom the building was named and said, \\"I came to Dartmouth because of you.\\" As a young man growing up in New Hampshire, he worked in a granite quarry and decided to attend Dartmouth for his undergraduate education over the stern objections of his father, who had attended Harvard and wanted his son to also attend Harvard. However, after graduating from Worcester Academy in 1896, Hopkins matriculated to Dartmouth. So strong were the impressions he made in Hanover during his student years that then-President William Jewett Tucker employed him as a clerk and supported him with a scholarship during the depression of the 1890s. A Dartmouth graduate himself (class of 1901), Ernest Martin Hopkins did not fit the typical mold of a college president when he was selected by the Trustees in 1916. He was not an academic, had never held a teaching position and had spent the bulk of his career in the business world. But any doubts about his leadership qualities were quickly dispelled and he showed himself to be a champion of academic freedom in an era when that basic tenet of scholarship was under attack. The administration of Ernest Martin Hopkins spanned two world wars, and he was called to serve his country on several occasions. In World War I, he was named Assistant Secretary of War for Industrial Relations and served in the Office of Production and Management at the outset of World War II. President Hopkins was the recipient of at least 15 honorary degrees, and, while president of Dartmouth, declined an invitation to serve as president of the University of Chicago in order, according to a 1964 obituary in The New York Times, \\"to continue development of his ideas of what an undergraduate liberal arts education should encompass.\\" The articulation of these ideas during the Hopkins administration has become an enduring legacy that continues at Dartmouth today.

Most are somewhat box-shaped, hence the name. The hot gases generated in the firebox are pulled through a rack of tubes running through the boiler. Steam locomotive fire tube firebox  Diagramatic section through an earlier steam locomotive boiler and firebox to the right. Note the boiler is not fitted with a superheater. In the standard steam locomotive firetube type boiler, the firebox is surrounded by water space on five sides. The bottom of the firebox is open to atmospheric pressure, but covered by fire grates (solid fuel) or a firing pan (liquid fuel). If the engine burns solid fuel, like wood or coal, there is a grate covering most of the bottom of the firebox to hold the fire. An ashpan, mounted underneath the firebox and below the grates, catches and collects hot embers, ashes, and other solid combustion waste as it falls through the grates. In a coal-burning locomotive, the grates may be shaken to clean dead ash from the bottom of the fire. They are shaken either manually or (in larger locomotives) by a powered grate shaker. Wood-burning locomotives have fixed grates that can't be shaken. Wood ash is generally powder which will fall through the grates with no more agitation required than the vibrations of the locomotive rolling down the track. The fire grates must be replaced periodically due to the extreme heat they must endure. Combustion air enters through the bottom of the firebox and airflow is usually controlled by damper doors above the ash collection pocket of the ash pan. A locomotive that burns liquid fuel - usually \\"Bunker C\\" fuel oil or similar heavy oil - does not have grates. Instead, they have a heavy metal gauge firing pan bolted tight against the bottom of the firebox. The firing pan is covered with firebrick and the firebox has a firebrick lining, usually up to the level of the firebox door, all the way around the firebox. The oil burner is a nozzle containing a slot for the oil to flow out onto a steam jet which atomizes the oil into a fine mist which ignites in the firebox. The oil burner nozzle is usually mounted in the front of the firebox, protected by a hood of firebrick, and aimed at the firebrick wall below the firebox door. Dampers control air flow to the oil fire. Schematic of a later steam locomotive firebox boiler, with firebox to the left and indicatively showing two superheater elements to the right. These elements receive saturated (wet) steam from the boiler, add more heat to the steam in the superheater elements (hence the term \\"super\\" heated) which drys the steam, then discharges the superheated (dry) steam to the engine. The colours blue and red represent cooler and hotter water respectively. The colours dark and light green represent wet and dry steam respectively. The colours orange and yellow represent hot and cooler exhaust gas respectively. In the diagram three small diameter orange\\\\yellow empty firetubes are indicated to the bottom with two larger diameter orange\\\\yellow firetubes to the top that contain the superheater elements. =Brick arch= Firebox of a GWR 6959 Class steam locomotive, showing the underside of the brick arch, constructed from specially-shaped firebricks. There is a large brick arch (made from fire brick) attached to the front wall of the firebox immediately beneath the firetubes. This extends backwards over the front third to half of the firebed. It is supported on arch tubes, thermic syphons, or circulators. The brick arch directs heat, flames, and smoke back over the fire towards the rear of the firebox. Visible smoke contains unburned combustible carbon particles and combustible gasses. The purpose of this redirection is to cause more complete combustion of these particles and gasses which make the locomotive more efficient and causes less visible smoke to be emitted from the stack. Without the arch, flames and visible smoke would be sucked straight into the firetubes without having been fully burned, causing visible smoke to be emitted at the stack. The invention of the brick arch allowed locomotives to burn cheaper coal (which contains volatiles) instead of coke, it having been a legal requirement from the outset for engines to \\"consume their own smoke\\". The brick arch and its supports (arch tubes, thermic syphons, and circulators) require periodic replacement due to the extreme heat they endure. =Firetubes= Firetubes are attached to one wall of the firebox (the front wall for a longitudinal boiler, the top for a vertical boiler) and carry the hot gaseous products of combustion through the boiler water, heating it, before they escape to the atmosphere. Firetubes serve the additional purpose of staying the flat tube (flue) sheets (front and rear) so that only the top of the front flue sheet and the bottom of the rear flue sheet must be separately braced. =Sheets and stays = Cutaway of locomotive firebox and boiler with radial stays The metal walls of the firebox are normally called sheets, which are separated and supported by stays. The stays support and brace the \\"sheets\\" (plates) against pressure. Ideally, they should be located at right angles to the sheets, but since the outer sheet (wrapper sheet) is often rounded and the top of the firebox (crown sheet) is relatively flat by comparison, such a relationship to both sheets is impossible. The actual location of the stays is a compromise. Since stay breakage is hidden, the stays have longitudinal holes, called tell-tales, drilled in them which will blow water and steam, revealing if they are broken. A boiler with more than 5 broken stays, or two next to each other, must be taken out of service and the stays replaced. The fusible plugs, usually located in the highest part of the crown sheet, have a soft metal alloy core which melts out if the water level in the boiler gets too low. Steam and water blowing into the firebox both alerts the locomotive crew to the low water condition and helps put out the fire. Not all locomotives are equipped with fusible plugs. Also, fusible plugs should be replaced at regular intervals, about every three months for a locomotive in regular service, because the soft metal alloy core will slowly melt out over time even if the boiler water is carried at proper levels. The \\"mudholes,\\" or washout plugs, allow access to the interior of the boiler for washing and scraping away boiler mud and scale. The sheets on the left and right are called \\"side sheets\\" while the sheet in the front of the firebox is the flue sheet. The \\"front flue sheet\\" is in the front of the boiler and at the rear of the smokebox. The \\"rear sheet\\" is at the back of the firebox and has the door opening in it. The crown sheet is the top of the firebox. The crown sheet must be covered by water at all times. If the water level drops below the crown sheet, it will become overheated and start to melt and deform, usually sagging between the crown stays. If the condition continues, the crown sheet will eventually be forced off the crown stays by the pressure in the boiler, resulting in a boiler explosion. This condition, usually caused by human error or inattention, is the single greatest cause of a locomotive boiler explosion. =Belpaire firebox= Normally the top of the boiler (wrapper sheet) over the firebox is radial to match the contour of the boiler; however, due to the problem of placing stays at right angles to both the wrapper sheet and the crown sheet (see above) the Belpaire firebox was developed. In the Belpaire design, the wrapper sheet is roughly parallel with the firebox sheets to allow better placement of the stays. This arrangement gives the firebox end of the boiler a more square shape and is usually made as large as possible within the loading gauge, to offer the greatest heating surface where the fire is hottest. The most notable user of the Belpaire firebox in the United States was the Pennsylvania Railroad. Other railroads, such as the Great Northern and Illinois Central, had locomotives with Belpaire fireboxes. Illinois Central 4-6-0 #382, Casey Jones' engine, had a Belpaire firebox. Steam is usually collected at the front corners of a Belpaire firebox, allowing for a domeless boiler. The top of the firebox, rather than being horizontal, is visibly higher at the front than at the rear to reduce the risk of water being carried over with the steam. =Wootten firebox= The Wootten firebox was very tall and wide to allow combustion of anthracite coal waste. Its size necessitated unusual placement of the crew, examples being camelback locomotives. =Combustion Chamber= Combustion chamber of a steam locomotive firebox, extending forwards (leftwards) of the main firebox, into the boiler barrel Some fireboxes were equipped with a so-called combustion chamber, this is a distinct component from the firebox and tubes - a large single extension of the firebox space, into the boiler barrel, and above the brick arch and separated from the grate and the fire bed, this placed additional space between the fire and the rear fire tube/flue sheet. This allowed more complete combustion (reducing fuel wastage) and increased firebox surface area for greater heat-transfer, these factors Improved both boiler efficiency and fuel economy. The improved combustion (which reduces carbon- soot ejection) reduced the carry over of ash and soot into the fire-tubes and smoke box, reducing the frequency of cleaning required. Soot buildup and scale buildup (on the water side) severely reduce heat transfer through the fire tubes/flues, reducing steam generation and boiler efficiency. Buildup of soot and scale can also lead to overheating and subsequent tube failure if not cleaned properly to remove soot (with water, compressed air and cleaning rods) and scale with boiler washouts and water treatment e.g. Porta Treatment (minimizes and virtually prevents scale buildup) is named after the Argentine locomotive engineer Livio Dante Porta, who invented it. =Fireman's duties= The fireman's role on a steam locomotive is to ensure the driver has an adequate supply of steam at his disposal at all times. This is achieved by maintaining a supply of fuel to the fire, and by maintaining the boiler water level so that it covers the firebox crown sheet at all times ‚Äì otherwise, the latter will overheat and weaken, and a boiler explosion may result. At the terminal after the day's work is done, the fireman will fill the boiler with water and either bank or dump the fire (i.e. extinguish the fire), according to company policy, and chock the driver wheels to prevent the locomotive from moving while it is unattended.Smithsonian Institution, America on the Move . =Gallery= File:PRR N1s 7246.jpgThe flat sides and square corners show the shape of the Belpaire firebox. This offers a greater heating surface, increasing the efficiency of the engine File:4-8-2.jpgLocomotive with a normal firebox. The round top of the firebox makes attaching the boiler easier File:Erie L-1 2601.jpgThe Wootten firebox can be seen as the large construction just in front of the tender. Note the unusual position of the driver's cab. The fireman was left exposed between firebox and tender Road locomotive firebox Road locomotives, such as traction engines, usually had fireboxes similar to those on railway locomotives but there were exceptions, e.g. the Sentinel steam waggon which had a vertical water tube boiler. Stationary boiler firebox There were, and are, many different designs of firebox for stationary boilers. In flue-type boilers (e.g. the Lancashire boiler) the flues themselves form the firebox. In water-tube boilers, the firebox is usually a firebrick-lined compartment below the water tubes. Marine boiler firebox In marine boilers there are also various types of firebox. The main distinction is, again, between fire-tube types (e.g. the Scotch boiler, with internal firebox) and water-tube types (e.g. the Yarrow boiler, with external firebox).

Like his predecessor Ernest Martin Hopkins, the fourteenth president in the Wheelock Succession came from a business background. President McLaughlin succeeded in carrying out an ambitious agenda for Dartmouth, striving to keep it in the forefront of liberal education. During his tenure academic and athletic facilities were improved; the Rockefeller Center, Hood Museum, and boathouse were built; classrooms were renovated; the Dartmouth Skiway was improved; and the Berry Sports Center was built. Academic initiatives included the establishment of the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding and the Institute for the Study of Applied and Professional Ethics. Faculty salaries increased 43 percent over a five-year period, the college's \\"need-blind\\" admissions policy was continued and the endowment grew to a new high of $521 million. Dartmouth's professional schools also grew under President McLaughlin's tenure: the Thayer School of Engineering received a $15 million grant to expand and improve facilities; the Tuck School of Business was strengthened; and Dartmouth Medical School was brought into financial equilibrium, greatly increasing its sponsored research and fund raising efforts. Dartmouth continued to progress under McLaughlin's leadership and his continued commitment to liberal education and undergraduate teaching.

The term has had two usages in music history: # Recently, the term has come to mean any composition at all from the Renaissance or early Baroque period for two vocal or instrumental parts. # Historically, a bicinium referred specifically to a two-part composition used as a teaching tool, most often in Protestant, German-speaking areas. The term was first used in Poland, by Jan z Lublina in a treatise of 1540. Volumes of bicinia were published in the next several decades in Germany, the Low Countries, and even in Italy, as the usefulness of bicinia as teaching aids became apparent. In addition, Martin Luther had strongly expressed that children should learn both music and the psalms: bicinia with German texts from the Psalms fulfilled his purpose. Students could be expected to master singing a single part in a duet more easily than a part in a larger ensemble. Usually a bicinium was designed to be sung or played by students of the same age and ability, rather than for a single student and a teacher. This model of moving from two-part study, writing, and singing to three parts and then more was adopted by Heinrich Glarean in his Dodecachordon (1547), one of the most influential music theory and pedagogy treatises of the Renaissance. In a similar manner, present-day music students typically learn counterpoint first by writing in two parts, and then later in three, only moving to four or more parts after mastering the earlier stages. A similar pedagogical composition for three voices is known as a tricinium (pl. tricinia).

The crusader army led by Godfrey of Bouillon defeated and drove off a Fatimid army, securing the safety of Jerusalem. The Crusaders completed their primary objective of capturing Jerusalem on 15 July 1099. In early August, they learned of the approach of a 20,000-strong Fatimid army under vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah. Under Godfrey's command the 10,200-strong Crusader army took the offensive, leaving the city on 10 August to risk everything on a great battle against the approaching Muslims. The Crusaders marched barefoot, carrying the relic of the True Cross with them, accompanied by patriarch Arnulf of Chocques. The army marched south from Jerusalem, approaching the vicinity of Ascalon on the 11th and capturing Egyptian spies who revealed al-Afdal's dispositions and strength.(The distance from Jerusalem to Ascalon is ca 77 Km) At dawn on 12 August, the Crusader army launched a surprise attack on the Fatimid army still sleeping in its camp outside the defensive walls of Ascalon. The Fatimids had failed to post enough guards, leaving only a part of their army capable of fighting. The Crusaders quickly defeated the half-ready Fatimid infantry, while the Fatimid cavalry barely fought at all. The battle was over in less than an hour. The Crusader knights reached the center of the camp, capturing the vizier's standard and personal baggage, including his sword. Some Fatimids fled into the trees and were killed by Crusader arrows and lances, while others begged for mercy at the Crusaders' feet and were butchered en masse. The terrified vizier fled by ship to Egypt, leaving the Crusaders to kill any survivors and gather up a vast amount of loot. Ibn al- Qalanisi estimated 12,700 Fatimid dead. The first Muslim attempt to recapture Jerusalem ended in complete defeat, but Godfrey failed to exploit the victory and take Ascalon, whose Fatimid garrison was willing to surrender only to Raymond of Toulouse, a condition Godfrey would not accept. The Fatimid base in Ascalon remained a thorn in the side of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and would not fall until 1153. Background The Discovery of the True Cross (Gustave Dor√©) The crusaders had negotiated with the Fatimids of Egypt during their march to Jerusalem, but no satisfactory compromise could be reached‚Äîthe Fatimids were willing to give up control of Syria but not the lower Levant, but this was unacceptable to the crusaders, whose goal was the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Jerusalem was captured from the Fatimids on July 15, 1099, after a long siege, and immediately the crusaders learned that a Fatimid army was on its way to besiege them. The crusaders acted quickly. Godfrey of Bouillon was named Defender of the Holy Sepulchre on July 22, and Arnulf of Chocques, named patriarch of Jerusalem on August 1, discovered a relic of the True Cross on August 5. Fatimid ambassadors arrived to order the crusaders to leave Jerusalem, but they were ignored. On August 10 Godfrey led the remaining crusaders out of Jerusalem towards Ascalon, a day's march away, while Peter the Hermit led both the Catholic and Greek Orthodox clergy in prayers and a procession from the Holy Sepulchre to the Temple. Robert II of Flanders and Arnulf accompanied Godfrey, but Raymond IV of Toulouse and Robert of Normandy stayed behind, either out of a quarrel with Godfrey or because they preferred to hear about the Egyptian army from their own scouts. When the Egyptian presence was confirmed, they marched out as well the next day. Near Ramla, they met Tancred and Godfrey's brother Eustace, who had left to capture Nablus earlier in the month. At the head of the army, Arnulf carried the relic of the Cross, while Raymond of Aguilers carried the relic of the Holy Lance that had been discovered at Antioch the previous year. Battle The Fatimids were led by vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah, who commanded perhaps as many as 20,000 troops (other estimates include the exaggerated 200,000 of the Gesta Francorum). His army consisted of Seljuk Turks, Arabs, Persians, Armenians, Kurds, and Ethiopians. He was intending to besiege the crusaders in Jerusalem, although he had brought no siege machinery with him; he did however have a fleet, also assembling in the port of Ascalon. The precise number of crusaders is unknown, but the number given by Raymond of Aguilers is 1,200 knights and 9,000 infantry. The highest estimate is 20,000 men but this is surely impossible at this stage of the crusade. Al-Afdal camped in the plain of al-Majdal in a valley outside Ascalon, preparing to continue on to Jerusalem and besiege the crusaders there, apparently unaware that the crusaders had already left to meet him. On August 11 the crusaders found oxen, sheep, camels, and goats, gathered there to feed the Fatimid camp, grazing outside the city. According to captives taken by Tancred in a skirmish near Ramla, the animals were there to encourage the crusaders to disperse and pillage the land, making it easier for the Fatimids to attack. However, al-Afdal did not yet know the crusaders were in the area and was apparently not expecting them. In any case, these animals marched with them the next morning exaggerating the appearance of their army. On the morning of the 12th, crusader scouts reported the location of the Fatimid camp and the army marched towards it. During the march the crusaders had been organized into nine divisions: Godfrey led the left wing, Raymond the right, and Tancred, Eustace, Robert of Normandy and Gaston IV of B√©arn made up the centre; they were further divided into two smaller divisions, and a division of foot-soldiers marched ahead of each. This arrangement was also used as the line of battle outside Ascalon, with the center of the army between the Jerusalem and Jaffa Gates, the right aligned with the Mediterranean coast, and the left facing the Jaffa Gate. According to most accounts (both Crusader and Muslim), the Fatimids were caught unprepared and the battle was short, but Albert of Aix states that the battle went on for some time with a fairly well prepared Egyptian army. The two main lines of battle fought each other with arrows until they were close enough to fight hand-to-hand with spears and other hand weapons. The Ethiopians attacked the centre of the crusader line, and the Fatimid vanguard was able to outflank the crusaders and surround their rearguard, until Godfrey arrived to rescue them. Despite his numerical superiority, al-Afdal's army was hardly as strong or dangerous as the Seljuk armies that the crusaders had encountered previously. The battle seems to have been over before the Fatimid heavy cavalry was prepared to join it. Al-Afdal and his panicked troops fled back to the safety of the heavily fortified city; Raymond chased some of them into the sea, others climbed trees and were killed with arrows, while others were crushed in the retreat back into the gates of Ascalon. Al-Afdal left behind his camp and its treasures, which were captured by Robert and Tancred. Crusader losses are unknown, but the Egyptians lost 10,000 infantry and 2,700 residents of Ascalon, including militia, killed.

W. Sharpe, based on a painting of the same title by Gustave Dor√©) Aftermath The crusaders spent the night in the abandoned camp, preparing for another attack, but in the morning they learned that the Fatimids were retreating to Egypt. Al-Afdal fled by ship. They took as much plunder as they could, including the Standard and al-Afdal's personal tent, and burned the rest. They returned to Jerusalem on August 13, and after much celebration Godfrey and Raymond both claimed Ascalon. When the garrison learned of the dispute they refused to surrender. After the battle, almost all of the remaining crusaders returned to their homes in Europe, their vows of pilgrimage having been fulfilled. There were perhaps only a few hundred knights left in Jerusalem by the end of the year, but they were gradually reinforced by new crusaders, inspired by the success of the original crusade. Although the battle of Ascalon was a crusader victory the city itself remained under Fatimid control, and it was eventually re-garrisoned. It became the base of operations for invasions of the Kingdom of Jerusalem every year afterwards, and numerous battles were fought there in the following years, until 1153 when it was finally captured by the crusaders in the Siege of Ascalon.

Dartmouth presidency  The New York City American, in a September 30, 1926 obituary notice, wrote of William Jewett Tucker that he \\"was known in New England as 'the great president,' who brought Dartmouth from the position of a small New Hampshire college to that of a great national educational institution.\\" One of the college's most beloved leaders, William Jewett Tucker was said to have \\"refounded Dartmouth,\\" bringing its facilities, its curriculum and every aspect of its organization into the modern era. When he assumed the presidency in 1893, the college was in debt, there were only slightly over 300 students and there was no central physical facilities plant. When he stepped down in 1909 more than 20 new buildings had been erected, including a central steam plant; the student body had grown to over 1,100 students from across the country and around the world; the faculty had increased from 26 to 81; and the curriculum had been broadened. Tireless in his efforts to build the physical college, President Tucker was also equally devoted to articulating a moral and spiritual dimension for Dartmouth and for higher education nationwide. In numerous books and essays he called for a liberalization of American theology and commitment to public service. William Jewett Tucker graduated from Dartmouth in 1861 and studied for the ministry at Andover Theological Seminary. Ordained in 1867, he was a Congregational pastor in Manchester, New Hampshire, and, later, in New York City. He returned to Andover in 1879 as professor of sacred rhetoric and became an editor of the Andover Review and a founder of The South End House, one of Boston's first settlement houses for the poor. At Andover, he was a central figure in the \\"Andover controversy\\" of 1886‚Äì92, when charges were filed against five professors calling for a liberalization of Congregational views. In 1890, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts declared the proceedings \\"faulty\\"; in 1892, all five professors, Tucker included, were \\"acquitted.\\" William Jewett Tucker retired from the Dartmouth presidency in 1909 and became president emeritus.

Spectacled bears are the only surviving species of bear native to South America, and the only surviving member of the subfamily Tremarctinae. The species is classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN because of habitat loss. Description At the Cincinnati Zoo The spectacled bear is the only bear native to South America and is the largest land carnivoran on that part of the continent, although as little as 5% of its diet is composed of meat. South America's largest obligate carnivorous mammal is the jaguar (Panthera onca). Among South America's extant, native land animals, only the Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii), South American tapir (T. terrestris) and mountain tapir (T. pinchaque) are heavier than this species. The spectacled bear is a mid-sized species of bear. Overall, its fur is blackish in colour, though bears may vary from jet black to dark brown and to even a reddish hue. The species typically has distinctive beige or ginger-coloured markings across its face and upper chest, though not all spectacled bears have \\"spectacle\\" markings. The pattern and extent of pale markings are slightly different on each individual bear, and bears can be readily distinguished by this.

Distribution and habitat Despite some rare spilling-over into eastern Panama, spectacled bears are mostly restricted to certain areas of northern and western South America. They can range in western Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, western Bolivia, and northwestern Argentina. The species is found almost entirely in the Andes Mountains. Before spectacled bear populations became fragmented during the last 500 years, the species had a reputation for being adaptable, as it is found in a wide variety of habitats and altitudes throughout its range, including cloud forests, high-altitude grasslands, dry forests and scrub deserts. A single spectacled bear population on the border of Peru and Ecuador inhabited as great a range of habitat types as the world's brown bears (Ursus arctos) now occupy. The best habitats for spectacled bears are humid to very humid montane forests. These cloud forests typically occupy a elevational band between depending on latitude. Generally, the wetter these forests are the more food species there are that can support bears. Occasionally, they may reach altitudes as low as , but are not typically found below in the foothills. They can even range up to the mountain snow line at over in elevation.Nowak, R.M. (1991). Walker‚Äôs Mammals of the World.'.

Lincoln Park Zoological Gardens, Chicago Park District Press, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. Naming and etymology Tremarctos ornatus is commonly referred to in English as the \\"spectacled bear\\", a reference to the light colouring on its chest, neck and face, which may resemble eyeglasses in some individuals, or the \\"Andean bear\\" for its distribution along the Andes. The root trem- comes from a Greek word meaning \\"hole;\\" arctos is the Greek word for \\"bear.\\" Tremarctos is a reference to an unusual hole on the animal's humerus. Ornatus, Latin for \\"decorated\\", is a reference to the markings that give the bear its common English name. Behaviour and diet Skull At a zoo in Venezuela Spectacled bears are one of four extant bear species that are habitually arboreal, alongside the American black bear (Ursus americanus) and Asian black bear (U. thibetanus), and the sun bear (Helarctos malayanus). In Andean cloud forests, spectacled bears may be active both during the day and night, but in Peruvian desert are reported to bed down under vegetative cover during the day. Their continued survival alongside humans has depended mostly on their ability to climb even the tallest trees of the Andes. They usually retreat from the presence of humans, often by climbing trees. Once up a tree, they may often build a platform, perhaps to aid in concealment, as well as to rest and store food on. Although spectacled bears are solitary and tend to isolate themselves from one another to avoid competition, they are not territorial. They have even been recorded to feed in small groups at abundant food sources. Males are reported to have an average home range of during the wet season and during the dry season. Females are reported to have an average home range of in the wet season and in the dry season.Hunter, Luke (2011) Carnivores of the World. Princeton University Press, When encountered by humans or other spectacled bears, they will react in a docile but cautious manner, unless the intruder is seen as a threat or a mother's cubs are endangered. Like other bears, mothers are protective of their young and have attacked poachers. There is only a single reported human death due to a spectacled bear, which occurred while it was being hunted and was already shot. The only predators of cubs include cougars (Puma concolor) and possibly male spectacled bears. The bears \\"appear to avoid\\" jaguars, but the jaguar has considerably different habitat preferences, does not overlap with the spectacled bear in altitude on any specific mountain slope, and only overlaps slightly (900m) in altitude if the entire Cordillera Oriental is considered based upon unpublished data. Generally, the only threat against adult bears is humans.Spectacled Bear. rosamondgiffordzoo.org The longest-lived captive bear, at the National Zoo in Washington, DC, attained a lifespan of 36 years and 8 months. Lifespan in the wild has not been studied, but bears are believed to commonly live to 20 years or more unless they run afoul of humans. Spectacled bears are more herbivorous than most other bears; normally about 5 to 7% of their diets is meat. The most common foods for these bears include cactus, bromeliads (especially Puya ssp., Tillandsia ssp. and Guzmania ssp.) palm nuts, bamboo hearts, frailejon (Espeletia spp.), orchid bulbs, fallen fruit on the forest floor, and unopened palm leaves.Jorgenson, J.P., and Rodriguez, J.S.

Much of this vegetation is very tough to open or digest for most animals, and the bear is one of the few species in its range to exploit these food sources. The spectacled bear has the largest zygomatic mandibular muscles relative to its body size and the shortest muzzle of any living bear, slightly surpassing the relative size of the giant panda's (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) morphology here. Not coincidentally, both species are known for extensively consuming tough, fibrous plants. Unlike the ursid bears whose fourth premolar has a more well- developed protoconid, an adaptation for shearing flesh, the fourth premolar of spectacled bears has blunt lophs with three pulp cavities instead of two, and can have three roots instead of the two that characterize ursid bears. The musculature and tooth characteristics are designed to support the stresses of grinding and crushing vegetation. Besides the giant panda, the spectacled bear is perhaps the most herbivorous living bear species. These bears also eat cultivated plants, such as sugarcane (Saccharum ssp.), honey (made by Apis ssp.), and corn (Zea mays), and have been known to travel above the tree line for berries and more ground-based bromeliads. When food is abundant, such as large corn fields, up to nine individual bears have fed close by each other in a single vicinity. Animal prey is usually quite small, but these bears can prey on adult deer, llama (Lama glama) and domestic cattle (Bos primigenius taurus) and horses (Equus ferus caballus).Spectacled bear Tremarctos ornatus ‚Äì Natural Diet (Literature Reports) .

The mating pair are together for one to two weeks, during which they will copulate multiple times. Births usually occur in the dry season, between December and February. The gestation period is 5.5 to 8.5 months.Rosenthal, M.A. (1987). \\"Biological management of spectacled bears (Tremarctos ornatus) in captivity\\", pp. 93‚Äì103. in: Weinhardt, D., (ed.) International studybook for the spectacled bear, 1986. Lincoln Park Zoological Gardens, Chicago Park District Press, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. From one to three cubs may be born, with four being rare and two being the average. The cubs are born with their eyes closed and weigh about each. Although this species does not give birth during the hibernation cycle as do northern bear species, births usually occur in a small den and the female waits until the cubs can see and walk before she leaves with them. The size of the litter has been positively correlated with both the weight of the female and the abundance and variety of food sources, particularly the degree to which fruiting is temporally predictable. The cubs often stay with the female for one year before striking out on their own. Breeding maturity is estimated to be reached at between four and seven years of age for both sexes, based solely on captive bears. Conservation =Threats= Spectacled bear at Tennoji Zoo in Osaka, Japan The Andean bear is threatened due to poaching and habitat loss. Poaching might have several reasons: trophy hunting, pet trade, religious or magical beliefs, natural products trade and conflicts with humans. Trophy hunting of Andean bear was apparently popular during the 19th century in some rural areas of Latin-America. In the costumbrist novel \\"Mar√≠a\\" by Colombian writer Jorge Isaacs, it was portrayed as an activity for privileged young men in Colombia. Tales regarding pet bears are also known from documents about the Ecuadorian aristocracy of that time. These threats might have diminished in recent years, but there are still isolated reports of captive bears confiscated in rural areas, which usually are unable to adapt again to their natural habitat and must be kept in zoological facilities. Religious or magical beliefs might be motivations for killing Andean bears, especially in places where bears are related to myths of disappearing women or kids, or where bear parts are related to traditional medicine or superstitions. In this context, the trade of bear parts might have commercial value. Their gall bladders appear to be valued in traditional Chinese medicine and can fetch a high price on the international market. Conflicts with humans, however, appear to be the most common cause of poaching in large portions of its distribution. Andean Bears are often suspected of attacking cattle and raiding crops, and are killed for retaliation or in order to avoid further damages. It has been argued that attacks to cattle attributed to Andean bear are partly due to other predators. Raiding of crops can be frequent in areas with diminishing natural resources and extensive crops in former bear habitat, or when problematic individuals get used to human environments. The intensity of poaching can create ecological traps for Andean bears. That is, if bears are attracted to areas of high habitat quality that are also high in poaching risk. Perhaps the most epidemic problem for the species is extensive logging and farming, which has led to habitat loss for the largely tree-dependent bears. As little as 5% of the original habitat in Andean cloud forest remains. Shortage of natural food sources might push bears to feed on crops or livestock, increasing the conflict that usually results in poaching of individual. Impacts of climate changes on bear habitat and food sources are not fully understood, but might have potential negative impact in the near future. =Conservation actions and plans= The IUCN has recommended the following courses for spectacled bear conservation: expansion and implementation of conservation land to prevent further development, greater species level research and monitoring of trends and threats, more concerted management of current conservation areas, stewardship programs for bears which engage local residents and the education of the public regarding spectacled bears, especially the benefits of conserving the species due to its effect on natural resources. National governments, NGOs and rural communities have made different commitments to conservation of this species along its distribution. Conservation actions in Venezuela date back to the early 1990s, and have been based mostly on environmental education at several levels and the establishment of protected areas. The effort of several organisations has led to a widespread recognition of the andean bear in Venezuelan society, raising it as an emblematic species of conservation efforts in the country, and to the establishment of a 10-year action plan. Evidence regarding the objective effectiveness of these programs (like reducing poaching risk, maintaining population viability, and reducing extinction risk) is subject to debate and needs to be further evaluated. Legislation against bear hunting exists, but is rarely enforced.\\"Endangered Bears\\", The Pet Wiki. This leads to persistence of the poaching problem, even inside protected areas. In 2006 the Spectacled Bear Conservation Society was established in Peru to study and protect the spectacled bear. Media The children's character Paddington Bear is a spectacled bear, famously from \\"darkest Peru\\". In the documentary Paddington Bear: The Early Years, British actor Stephen Fry encounters a spectacled bear called Yogi, which was kept in a small cage by Andean villagers. Fry bartered with the villagers to have the bear released, and it was taken to an enclosure in Machu Picchu. Fry's interest in the bears led to the follow-up documentary, Stephen Fry and the Spectacled Bears, and he also wrote and published his experiences in Rescuing the Spectacled Bear: A Peruvian Diary. In the BBC television programme Serious Andes, a team of eight teenagers built a prerelease enclosure for two spectacled bears before returning them to the wild.

Leodegrance had served Uther Pendragon, King Arthur's biological father and regnal predecessor. Leodegrance was entrusted with the keeping of the Round Table at Uther's death. When Guinevere marries Arthur, Leodegrance gives the young king the table as a wedding present. In later romance Leodegrance is one of the few kings who accept Arthur as his overlord. For this, his land is invaded by the rebel king Rience, but Arthur comes to his rescue and expels the enemy. Arthur meets Guinevere for the first time during this excursion, and they develop a love that eventually results in their fateful marriage.

Moreover, the government was very permissive of the Red Guards, and even allowed the Red Guards to inflict bodily harm on people viewed as dissidents. The movement quickly grew out of control, frequently coming into conflict with authority and threatening public security until the government made efforts to rein the youths in. The Red Guard groups also suffered from in-fighting as factions developed among them. By the end of 1968, the group as a formal movement had dissolved. Origins The first students to call themselves \\"Red Guards\\" in China were from the Tsinghua University Middle School, who were given the name to sign two big-character posters issued on 25 May ‚Äì 2 June 1966.Chesneaux, p. 141 The students believed that the criticism of the play Hai Rui Dismissed from Office was a political issue and needed greater attention. The group of students‚Äîled by Zhang Chengzhi at Tsinghua Middle School and Nie Yuanzi at Peking University‚Äîoriginally wrote the posters as a constructive criticism of Tsinghua University and Peking University's administrations, who were accused of harbouring intellectual elitism and bourgeois tendencies. Red Guards in 1966 The Red Guards were denounced as counter-revolutionaries and radicals by the school administration and by fellow students and were forced to secretly meet amongst the ruins of the Old Summer Palace. Nevertheless, Chairman Mao Zedong ordered that the manifesto of the Red Guards be broadcast on national radio and published in the People's Daily newspaper. This action gave the Red Guards political legitimacy, and student groups quickly began to appear across China.Meisner, p. 334 Due to the factionalism already emerging in the Red Guard movement, President Liu Shaoqi made the decision in early June 1966 to send in Communist Party of China (CPC) work teams. These workgroups were led by Zhang Chunqiao, head of China's Propaganda Department, in an attempt by the Party to keep the movement under control. Rival Red Guard groups led by the sons and daughters of cadres were formed by these work teams to deflect attacks from those in positions of power towards bourgeois elements in society, mainly intellectuals. In addition, these Party-backed rebel groups also attacked students with 'bad' class backgrounds, including children of former landlords and capitalists. These actions were all attempts by the CPC to preserve the existing state government and apparatus. Mao, concerned that these work teams were hindering the course of the Cultural Revolution, dispatched Chen Boda, Jiang Qing, Kang Sheng, and others to join the Red Guards and combat the work teams. In July 1966, Mao ordered the removal of the remaining work teams (against the wishes of Liu Shaoqi) and condemned their 'Fifty Days of White Terror'.Meisner, p. 335 The Red Guards were then free to organize without the restrictions of the Party and, within a few weeks, on the encouragement of Mao's supporters, Red Guard groups had appeared in almost every school in China.Meisner, p. 366  Role in the Cultural Revolution  = Red August and Red Terror = A public appearance of Chairman Mao and Lin Biao among Red Guards, in Beijing, during the Cultural Revolution (November 1966) Mao Zedong expressed personal approval and support for the Red Guards in a letter to Tsinghua University Red Guards on 1 August 1966.(Chinese) During the \\"Red August\\" of Beijing, Mao gave the movement a public boost at a massive rally on 18 August at Tiananmen Square. Mao appeared atop Tiananmen wearing an olive green military uniform, the type favored by Red Guards, but which he had not worn in many years. He personally greeted 1,500 Red Guards and waved to 800,000 Red Guards and onlookers below. A large number of members of \\"Five Black Categories\\" were persecuted and even killed. The rally was led by Chen Boda, and Lin Biao gave a keynote speech. Red Guard leaders, led by Nie Yuanzi, also gave speeches. A high school Red Guard placed a red armband inscribed with the characters for \\"Red Guard\\" on the Chairman, who stood for six hours. The 8-18 Rally, as it was known, was the first of eight receptions the Chairman gave to Red Guards in Tiananmen in the fall of 1966. It was this rally that signified the beginning of the Red Guards' involvement in implementing the aims of the Cultural Revolution.Van der Sprenkel, p. 455 A second rally, held on 31 August, was led by Kang Sheng and Lin Biao also donned a red arm band. The last rally was held on 26 November 1966. In all, the Chairman greeted eleven to twelve million Red Guards, most of whom traveled from afar to attend the ralliesMeisner, p. 340 including one held on National Day 1966, which included the usual civil-military parade. = Attacks upon the \\"Four Olds\\" = The remains of Ming dynasty Wanli Emperor at the Ming tombs. Red Guards dragged the remains of the Wanli Emperor and Empresses to the front of the tomb, where they were posthumously \\"denounced\\" and burned. In August 1966, the 11th Plenum of the CPC Central Committee had ratified the 'Sixteen Articles', a document that stated the aims of the Cultural Revolution and the role students would be asked to play in the movement. After the 18 August rally, the Cultural Revolution Group directed the Red Guards to attack the 'Four Olds' of Chinese society (i.e., old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas). For the rest of the year, Red Guards marched across China in a campaign to eradicate the 'Four Olds'. Old books and art were destroyed, museums were ransacked, and streets were renamed with new revolutionary names, adorned with pictures and the sayings of Mao.Meisner, p. 339 Many famous temples, shrines, and other heritage sites in Beijing were attacked. The Cemetery of Confucius was attacked in November 1966 by a team of Red Guards from Beijing Normal University, led by Tan Houlan. The corpse of the 76th-generation Duke Yansheng was removed from its grave and hung naked from a tree in front of the palace during the desecration of the cemetery. Attacks on other cultural and historic sites occurred between 1966 and 1967. One of the greater damages was to the Ming Dynasty Tomb of the Wanli Emperor in which his and the empress' corpses, along with a variety of artifacts from the tomb, were destroyed by student members of the Red Guard. Between the assaults on Wan Li and Confucius' tombs alone, more than 6,618 historic Chinese artifacts were destroyed in the desire to achieve the goals of the Cultural Revolution. Individual property was also targeted by Red Guard members if it was considered to represent one of the Four Olds. Commonly, religious texts and figures would be confiscated and burned. In other instances, items of historic importance would be left in place, but defaced, with examples such as Qin Dynasty scrolls having their writings partially removed, and stone and wood carvings having the faces and words carved out of them. Re-education came alongside the destruction of previous culture and history, throughout the Cultural Revolution schools were a target of Red Guard groups to teach both the new ideas of the Cultural Revolution; as well as to point out what ideas represented the previous era idealizing the Four Olds. For example, one student, Mo Bo, described a variety of the Red Guards activities taken to teach the next generation what was no longer the norms. This was done according to Bo with wall posters lining the walls of schools pointing out workers who undertook \\"bourgeois\\" lifestyles. These actions inspired other students across China to join the Red Guard as well. One of these very people, Rae Yang, described how these actions inspired students. Through authority figures, such as teachers, using their positions as a form of absolute command rather than as educators, gave students a reason to believe Red Guard messages. In Yang's case it is exemplified through a teacher using a poorly phrased statement as an excuse to shame a student to legitimize the teacher's own position. Attacks on culture quickly descended into attacks on people. Ignoring guidelines in the 'Sixteen Articles' which stipulated that persuasion rather than force were to be used to bring about the Cultural Revolution, officials in positions of authority and perceived 'bourgeois elements' were denounced and suffered physical and psychological attacks. On August 22, 1966, a central directive was issued to stop police intervention in Red Guard activities.MacFarquhar, Roderick and Schoenhals, Michael. Mao's Last Revolution. Harvard University Press, 2006. p. 124 Those in the police force who defied this notice were labeled \\"counter-revolutionaries.\\" Mao's praise for rebellion effectively endorsed the actions of the Red Guards, which grew increasingly violent.MacFarquhar & Schoenhals; pp. 515 Public security in China deteriorated rapidly as a result of central officials lifting restraints on violent behavior. Xie Fuzhi, the national police chief, said it was \\"no big deal\\" if Red Guards were beating \\"bad people\\" to death.MacFarquhar, Roderick and Schoenhals, Michael. Mao's Last Revolution. Harvard University Press, 2006. p. 125 The police relayed Xie's remarks to the Red Guards and they acted accordingly. In the course of about two weeks, the violence left some 100 teachers, school officials, and educated cadres dead in Beijing's western district alone. The number injured was \\"too large to be calculated.\\"MacFarquhar, Roderick and Schoenhals, Michael. Mao's Last Revolution. Harvard University Press, 2006. p. 126 The most gruesome aspects of the campaign included numerous incidents of torture, murder, and public humiliation. Many people who were targets of 'struggle' could no longer bear the stress and committed suicide. In August and September 1966, there were 1,772 people murdered in Beijing alone. In Shanghai there were 704 suicides and 534 deaths related to the Cultural Revolution in September. In Wuhan there were 62 suicides and 32 murders during the same period.MacFarquhar & Schoenhals; p. 124 Intellectuals were to suffer the brunt of these attacks. Many were ousted from official posts such as university teaching, and allocated manual tasks such as \\"sweeping courtyards, building walls and cleaning toilets from 7am to 5pm\\" which would encourage them to dwell on past \\"mistakes.\\"Howard, p. 169. An official report in October 1966 stated that the Red Guards had already arrested 22,000 'counterrevolutionaries'.Karnow, p. 209 The Red Guards were also tasked with rooting out 'capitalist roaders' (those with supposed 'right-wing' views) in positions of authority. This search was to extend to the very highest echelons of the CPC, with many top party officials, such as Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and Peng Dehuai, being attacked both verbally and physically by the Red Guards.Karnow, p. 232 and 244 Liu Shaoqi was especially targeted, as he had taken Mao's seat as State Chairman (Chinese President) following the Great Leap Forward. Although Mao stepped down from his post as a sign of accepting responsibility, he was angered that a capitalist roader like Liu could take the reins of communist China. = Clashes with the PLA = The Red Guards were not completely unchallenged. The Red Guards were not permitted to enter Zhongnanhai, the Forbidden City, or any military facility that was tasked with classified information (i.e. special intelligence, Nuclear Weapons development). Several times, Red Guards attempted to storm Zhongnanhai and the 8341 Special Regiment, which was responsible for Mao's security, fired upon them.Meisner, p. 339-340 Jiang Qing promoted the idea that the Red Guards should \\"crush the PLA,\\" with Lin Biao seemingly supportive of her plans (e.g., permitting Red Guards to loot barracks). At the same time, several military commanders, oblivious to the ongoing chaos that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) had to deal with, disregarded their chain of command and attacked Red Guards whenever their bases or people were threatened. When Red Guards entered factories and other areas of production, they encountered resistance in the form of worker and peasant groups who were keen to maintain the status quo. In addition, there were bitter divisions within the Red Guard movement itself, especially along social and political lines. The most radical students often found themselves in conflict with more conservative Red Guards. The leadership in Beijing also simultaneously tried to restrain and encourage the Red Guards, adding confusion to an already chaotic situation. On the one hand, the Cultural Revolution Group reiterated calls for non-violence. On the other hand, the People's Liberation Army was told to assist the Red Guards with transport and lodging, and assist in organizing rallies. By the end of 1966, most of the Cultural Revolution Group were of the opinion that the Red Guards had become a political liability. The campaign against 'capitalist-roaders' had led to anarchy, the Red Guards' actions had led to conservatism amongst China's workers, and the lack of discipline and the factionalism in the movement had made the Red Guards politically dangerous.Meisner, p. 341 1967 would see the decision to dispel the student movement. Factionalism within the Red Guards \\"Enveloped in a trance of excitement and change,\\" all student Red Guards pledged their loyalty to Chairman Mao Zedong. Many worshipped Mao above everything and this was typical of a \\"pure and innocent generation,\\" especially of a generation that was brought up under a marxist party, which discouraged religion altogether.Chan Excited youths took inspiration from Mao's often vaguely open-ended pronouncements, generally believing the inherent sanctity of his words and making serious efforts to figure out what they meant. Factions quickly formed based on individual interpretations of Mao's statements. All groups pledged loyalty to Mao and claimed to have his best interests in mind, yet they continually engaged in verbal and physical skirmishes throughout the Cultural Revolution, proving that there was no core political foundation at work. This domestic anarchy continued until the second half of the Cultural Revolution, when the 9th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China started civil policies. Youths from families with party-members and of revolutionary origin joined conservative factions. These factions focused on the socio-political status quo, keeping within their localities and working to challenge existing distributions of power and privilege.Walder Those from the countryside and without ties to the Chinese Communist Party often joined radical groups who sought to change and uproot local government leadership.Chan, pg. 143 The primary goal of the radicals was to restructure existing systems of inequality to benefit those of poorer backgrounds, as the supposed capitalist roaders who were corrupting the Socialist agenda. Primarily influenced by travel and a freer exchange of ideas from different regions of China, more joined the radical, rebel factions of the Red Guards by the second half of the Cultural Revolution. Some historians, such as Andrew Walder, argue that individuals and their political choices also influenced the development of Red Guard factions across China. Interests of individuals, interactions with authority figures, and social interactions all altered identities to forge factions that would fight for new grievances against \\"the system\\". Suppression by the PLA (1967-1968) By February 1967, political opinion at the center had decided on the removal of the Red Guards from the Cultural Revolution scene in the interest of stability.Meisner, p. 351 The People's Liberation Army (PLA) forcibly suppressed the more radical Red Guard groups in Sichuan, Anhui, Hunan, Fujian, and Hubei provinces in February and March. Students were ordered to return to schools; student radicalism was branded 'counterrevolutionary' and banned.Meisner, p. 352 These groups, as well as many of their supporters, were later branded May Sixteenth elements after an ultra-left Red Guard organization based in Beijing. There was a wide backlash in the spring against the suppression, with student attacks on any symbol of authority and PLA units, but not on Marshal Lin Biao, the Minister of National Defense and one of the Chairman's biggest allies. An order from Mao, the Cultural Revolution Group, the State Council, and the Central Military Affairs Committee of the PLA on 5 September 1967 instructed the PLA to restore order to China and end the chaos.Meisner, p. 357 The order came within months of PLA forces disobeying government and CRG orders in July, the Wuhan incident, the aftermath of which resulted in even more violence amongst the Red Guards, even targeting local level PLA formations, raising fears of a repeat of the Wuhan events. The PLA violently put down the national Red Guard movement in the year that followed, with the suppression often brutal. A radical alliance of Red Guard groups in Hunan province, called the Sheng Wu Lien, was involved in clashes with local PLA units, for example, and in the first half of 1968 was forcibly suppressed.Meisner, p. 361 At the same time the PLA carried out mass executions of Red Guards in Guangxi province that were unprecedented in the Cultural Revolution. The final remnants of the movement were defeated in Beijing in the summer of 1968. Reportedly, in an audience of the Red Guard leaders with Mao, the Chairman informed them gently of the end of the movement with a tear in his eye. The repression of the students by the PLA was not as gentle.Meisner, p. 362 After the summer of 1968 some more-radical students continued to travel across China and play an unofficial part in the Cultural Revolution, but by then the movement's official and substantial role was over.  Rustication From 1962 to 1979, 16 to 18 million youths were sent to the countryside to undergo re- education.Bramall, Chris. Industrialization of Rural China, p. 148\\\\. Oxford University Press (Oxford), 2007. . Sending city students to the countryside was also used to defuse the student fanaticism set in motion by the Red Guards. On December 22, 1968, Chairman Mao directed the People's Daily to publish a piece entitled \\"We too have two hands, let us not laze about in the city\\", which quoted Mao as saying \\"The intellectual youth must go to the country, and be educated from living in rural poverty.\\" In 1969 many youths were rusticated.Shu Jiang Lu, When Huai Flowers Bloom, p 115 Many students could not cope with this harsh life and died in the process of reeducation.  Historiography  The Red Guards and the wider Cultural Revolution are a sensitive and heavily censored chapter in the history of People's Republic of China. Official government mentions of the era are rare and brief. In popular culture *Allen Ginsberg refers to \\"Red Guards battling country workers in Nanking\\" in the first line of his poem \\"Returning North of Vortex,\\" included in the collection The Fall of America: Poems of These States (1973). *The Red Guard (1967), a Nick Carter spy novel, features scenes involving Red Guards in Shanghai during the Cultural Revolution. *In the book Son of the Revolution (1983), the protagonist, Liang Heng, becomes a Red Guard at age 12, despite the years of persecution he and his family received from them. *In The Last Emperor (1987), the Red Guard appeared near the end of the film humiliating the prison warden who treated the Emperor of China, Puyi, kindly. *Nien Cheng's memoir Life and Death in Shanghai (1987) describes Red Guard activities in Shanghai during the Cultural Revolution. *Jung Chang's autobiography, Wild Swans (1991), describes the atrocities committed by the Red Guards. *In Farewell My Concubine (1993), the Red Guards humiliate Cheng Dieyi and Duan Xiaolou as they try to overthrow the old society. *In the film The Blue Kite (1993), Tei Tou's classmates are shown wearing the red scarves of the red guards, and the film ends with the red guards denouncing his stepfather. *The film To Live (1994) has the Red Guards appearing in a few scenes, showing their various types of activity. *In Hong Kong, TVB and ATV often depicted the brutality of the Red Guards in films and television dramas. They are rarely portrayed in film and television programs produced in mainland China. *The video game Command & Conquer: Generals misleadingly named the Chinese standard infantry unit the \\"Red Guard,\\" that ensured the game's ban in China. *Ji-li Jiang's Red Scarf Girl (1997) is a novel about the Cultural Revolution that prominently features the Red Guards. The protagonist often wishes she could become one. *In his autobiography Gang of One, Fan Shen provides first hand accounts of his youth as a Red Guard. *Li Cunxin makes repeated reference to the Red Guards in his autobiography, Mao's Last Dancer (2003). *In the book Red Flower of China, Zhai Zhenhua recounts her time as a Red Guard. *Yang Rae recounts her time in the Red Guards and in the countryside in Spider Eaters. *In the novel Frog by Mo Yan, Red Guard is mentioned on several occasions, like public prosecution. *Members of the Red Guard are featured prominently in the novel The Three-Body Problem by the Chinese novelist Liu Cixin. *Two American organizations have adopted the title and ideology of the Red Guards in the United States, first being Red Guard Party, an Asian-American empowerment organization and the Red Guards, a small American collective of decentralized groups also inspired by Abimael Guzman, former leader of the Shining Path.

During its independent political history, Brazil has had seven constitutions. The most recent was ratified on October 5, 1988.  Imperial Constitution (1824)  = Background = Prior to its independence on September 7, 1822, Brazil had no formal Constitution, since Portugal only adopted its first Constitution on September 23, 1822, 16 days after Brazil proclaimed independence.http://www.arqnet.pt/portal/portugal/liberalismo/const822.html In 1823, Emperor Pedro I started the political process of writing a Constitution. The elaboration of the first Constitution of Brazil was quite difficult and the power struggle involved resulted in a long-lasting unrest that plagued the country for nearly two decades. Two major facts increased the troubles: * Large numbers of recent immigrants from Portugal (the so-called \\"Portuguese Party\\"), who wanted to keep their privileges or who were still loyal to the metropolitan government. These were found both among the wealthier parts of the population, as businessmen controlling Brazil's international trade, and the lower ones, as tradesmen and free urban workers (the Brazilian elite was mostly rural). * The majority of the population was composed of slaves, prompting the whites to fear being massacred in the event of a rebellion caused by a failing state. The first circumstance meant that despite strong support of the Crown Prince Pedro I by the Brazilian landowners (the so-called \\"Brazilian Party\\"), the opinions of the rein√≥is (name then given to recent immigrants from Portugal) should be considered. As each side had very distinct and different objectives none could prevail and a compromise was needed. There were also additional problems: the Constitutional Assembly had been elected to decide the applicability of Portuguese laws in Brazil, not to draft a new constitution. As a result, some of the Portuguese deputies refused to take part in it. On the other hand, the liberal Brazilian deputies had been persecuted: some were exiled while others were imprisoned. Thus the Constitutional Assembly did not hear an appreciable number of opinions and would reflect the objectives of the \\"Brazilian Party\\", to the detriment of the \\"Portuguese Party\\" and the liberals. As the draft constitution progressed it became clear that the deputies were trying to establish a constitution that would: * curtail the powers of the monarch, * restrict most political rights to landowners and deny them to the Portuguese, and * establish an authoritarian, but constitutional, monarchy, whose head of government would be the Emperor himself, aided by a group of ministers of his choice. Marquis of Sabar√° was among the noblemen charged with drafting Brazil's first Constitution. The emperor did not want to serve as a mere decorative figurehead, but rather to protect the interests of the Portuguese businessmen (who were the main economic base of Brazil) and prevent any further cession of his power to the Parliament. In light of the wave of conservatism led by the Holy Alliance, the Emperor used his influence over the Brazilian Army to dissolve the Constitutional Assembly, in what became known as the Night of Agony. On his own authority, he then issued a constitution that concentrated the executive power on the Emperor himself (eventually crowned \\"Constitutional Emperor and Perpetual Defender of Brazil\\"). Based on the French Constitution of 1791 and the Spanish Constitution of 1812, the Constitution endowed the Assembly with both status and authority. It created executive, legislative, judicial, and moderating branches as \\"delegations of the nation\\" with the separation of those powers envisaged as providing balances in support of the Constitution and the rights it enshrined. The Constitution of 1824 was rather less parliamentary than the draft prepared by the Constituent Assembly. In fact, it was for all purposes a peculiar and unique regime: a \\"presidential\\" monarchy. That did not mean, by any means, that the Brazilian monarch had prerogatives resembling those of a tyrant or dictator. The individual guarantees of human liberty and dignity were inserted into the articles of the Charter and were respected. The Emperor would not act in areas reserved to the legislative branch and the judiciary, such as to create laws or to judge and sentence. Even though it vested the emperor with more power than its would-be predecessor, the Imperial constitution was considered very progressive for its time. It was considered more progressive than several constitutions used by European liberal powers. = The Constitution = Pedro I, Emperor of Brazil. The new constitution, published on March 25, 1824 outlined the existence of four powers: * Executive ‚Äî The State Council * Legislative ‚Äî The General Assembly, formed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies * Judiciary ‚Äî The Courts * Moderator ‚Äî Vested in the Emperor, was supposed to resolve any incompatibilities between the other three, acting as a \\"neutral\\" power, in accordance to the theories of the Swiss thinker Benjamin Constant. The Emperor controlled the Executive by nominating the members of the State Council, influenced the Legislative by being allowed to propose motions and having the power to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies (senators sat for life, however, being individually chosen by the emperor among the top three candidates in a given province) and also influenced the Judiciary, by appointing (for life) the members of the Highest Court. This constitution established the Brazilian Empire as a Unitary state (the provinces had little autonomy, if any). The Amendment (Ato Adicional) of August 12, 1834, enacted in a period of liberal reform, authorized the provinces to create their own legislative chambers, which were empowered to legislate on financial matters, create taxes and their own corps of civil servants under a chief executive nominated by the central power; it was however revised by an \\"interpretive\\" act of May 1840, enacted in a period of conservative reaction, which allowed the central power to appoint judges and police officers in the provinces. On July 20, 1847, a Decree (number 523) established the post of Prime Minister, formally titled \\"president of the Council of Ministers\\" (not to be confused with the State Council, whose ten members sat for life and which in the late Empire functioned solely as an advising body to the Emperor). Appointed by the emperor, the Prime Minister then chose a cabinet of state secretaries, or ministers. The cabinet had to maintain the support of a majority in the General Assembly. The emperor's acts were not valid without the countersignature of the minister responsible for the issue concerned. The 1847 decree thus turned the Brazilian Empire into a standard constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system. The franchise was very limited, being censitary and indirect: no male citizen who was not head of a household and/or had a net yearly income of less than a hundred milr√©is was allowed to vote in the primary elections that chose actual electors, empowered with the right to vote for the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.On the requisites to the franchise on various levels, see Chapter VI of the Constitution, according to the text available at As a result, Brazilian legislatures had a decided conservative slant. Combined with widespread electoral frauds, no Prime Minister chosen by the Emperor ‚Äì who had the power to order the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies and new elections to it ‚Äì ever failed to win a parliamentary majority in subsequent elections. The Constitution of 1824, enacted in the name of the Holy Trinity, also instituted Catholicism as the state religion, allowing other religions to be practiced only in private: non- Catholic places of worship could not be fashioned to appear as religious buildings from the outside. It also excluded slaves from Brazilian citizenship, by extending it to all people born in Brazil who were freeborn or freed.Cf. arts. 5 and 6 of the Constitution of 1824, available at  Old Republic Constitution (1891)  = Background = On November 15, 1889, the emperor Pedro II was deposed, Brazilian monarchy abolished and the 1824 Constitution was put out of effect. No provisional constitution was used while a definitive successor document was being written. The writing process began in 1889, by a group of jurists and politicians, and the text was later amended by a Constitutional Congress on February 24, 1891. = The Constitution = Rui Barbosa had a large influence upon the text adopted as the 1891 Constitution of Brazil. In its final form, the new Constitution meant to create a federal state to promote individual liberties above all, following the basic principles of the Constitution of the United States, albeit with the adoption of a slightly different (and somewhat more centralized) form of federalism. The main traits of the constitution were: * Federalism: the provinces were turned into states whose indissoluble union was taken as forming the Body Politic of the Brazilian Federation. Governors (at the time called State Presidents) were to be elected by direct vote and a fixed term of office. * Separation of the State and Church. * Male universal suffrage (with exceptions, mostly illiterates, beggars and members of monastic orders) and basic individual rights for all citizens. Abolition of the death penalty. * Adoption of standard three-way separation of powers under a presidential republic on the American model; direct elections for all members of the Legislative and chief officers of the Executive branch. The Executive branch was headed by a President of the Republic, elected by direct voting (rather than an Electoral college in the American model) ‚Äì who had a four-year term and could not be reelected for a second, successive, term ‚Äì and his freely chosen cabinet of ministers. The Senate was reorganized as the Upper House of the Legislative branch, formed of representatives of the states (as opposed to the representatives of the people in the Chamber of Deputies) directly elected and with fixed terms of office.  Third Constitution (1934)  = Background = In 1930, after severe political problems, President Washington Lu√≠s was overthrown by a coup d'√©tat. The 1891 Constitution was annulled and the Provisional President Get√∫lio Vargas ruled as a de facto personal dictator, but the state landed elites (who had controlled the Brazilian state ever since independence) struggled to prevent this from continuing. In 1932, in S√£o Paulo, the Constitutionalist Revolution demanded a Constitution. As a result, a Constitutional Assembly was elected and the constitution was promulgated on July 16, 1934, four years after the coup d'√©tat had overthrown the Old Republic. Vargas accepted this constitution in order to legitimise his power. = The Constitution = This constitution was the shortest-lived Constitution of Brazil, lasting only three years (until 1937). Despite its short life, this constitution was important because it was the first time a Brazilian constitution was written from scratch by directly elected deputies in multi- party elections. As a consequence of this, it incorporated a number of improvements to Brazilian political, social and economical life: * Granted complete independence to the Supreme Court and subordinated all other courts to it. * Extended political rights to all adults, regardless of sex. * Introduced proportional voting for elections to the Chamber of Deputies, which included representatives of the people as well as a minority of representatives from trade unions and other professional organizations ‚Äì a corporatist device introduced under the shock of the Russian Revolution and the influence of Italian fascism. * Created a specific electoral court to supervise elections, under the control of the Supreme Court (previously the supervision of elections was under control of the Legislative Branch). * Following a trend set by the German Weimar Constitution, acknowledged a whole host of social rights alongside political and civil ones: the national minimum wage, the eight-hour workday, mandatory weekly rest, paid vacations and indemnity for unmotivated firing. * Created a labor court to supervise working conditions and codified rights and duties for both the employers and the employees. * Was the first Brazilian constitution to list all four basic freedoms (speech, religion, movement and assembly) alongside the basic rights (life, freedom and property).  \\"Estado Novo\\" Constitution (1937)  = Background = The adoption of the 1937 Constitution marked the beginning of Get√∫lio Vargas' dictatorship. On the night of November 10, 1937, Vargas announced in a nationwide radio address that he was seizing emergency powers under the pretext of suppressing a Communist-backed coup (the so-called Plano Cohen) On the same night, he promulgated a new constitution that effectively transformed his presidency into a legal dictatorship (the short interval suggesting that the self-coup had been planned well in advance). It was written by the minister of Justice, Francisco Campos, and proofread by Vargas and his minister of War (joint-commander of the Army and Air Force), Eurico Gaspar Dutra. = The Constitution = The new document was called the \\"Polaca\\", or Polish, Constitution because it was inspired by the Polish April Constitution of 1935. It was intended to consolidate the powers of the president, while substantially limiting the powers and autonomy of Congress and the judiciary. While clearly dictatorial, it was not intended to be completely totalitarian and repressive. It kept most social improvements of the previous constitution, and added more: The right to education, the right to culture preservation and guidelines for family rights, building on the Civil Code of 1917. On the other side, however, it heavily concentrated executive power: * Political parties were dissolved. * State \\"presidents\\" (elected) would be replaced by interventionists (appointed by the president of the republic). * Mayors would in turn be appointed by the interventionists. * Capital punishment was to be enforced on \\"traitors to the state\\" (a fairly broad category). * All requirements for an outright dictatorship (censorship, purges, militarism, state propaganda, cult of personality and others) were either required, allowed or not forbidden by the constitution.  Fifth Constitution (1946)  Gustavo Capanema was a member of the 1946 Constitutional Congress. = Background = When Vargas was forced to resign in 1945, a new constitution was written, once again by a directly elected Constitutional Congress. = The Constitution = This was the first Brazilian constitution to provide full political freedom (even the Brazilian Communist Party was made legal, though briefly) and the last to officially name the country Estados Unidos do Brazil (and the spelling of the country's name would change later that year). It was also the first with an additional \\"Act of Transitory Measures\\" (a set of laws that came into effect before the constitution itself and could not be changed). The key points of this constitution were: * Restore all rights and freedoms as expressed by the 1934 Constitution which had been suppressed in 1937. * Reducing the powers of the presidency. While it remained the key institution, numerous institutional safeguards were put in place to prevent a repeat of Vargas' authoritarian excesses. * Establish full equality before the law. * Created mechanisms to prevent and oppose religious prejudice and censorship (the latter with some exceptions regarding moral censorship of spectacles and public shows). * Mentioned the right to postal privacy and the inviolability of homes (until then police could enter anyone's house without a permit). * Improved federalism by extending the powers of the member states (for instance, it was the first time states were allowed to have flags and anthems). * Although it was not the first time all adults were granted full political rights, it was under this constitution that the first free and fair elections were held at all levels and for all offices. * Elections for executive offices would be held in a single round. * Voters could freely choose candidates of any party, including for vice president and vice governor. The last two would become the major problems of this constitution, as they were prone to produce and fuel both legitimacy crises (as the presidents were usually elected by less than a majority of votes) and conspiracies (as the vice-president was usually from another party).  Sixth Constitution (1967)  = Background = FM Castelo Branco. After the military coup d'√©tat of April 1, 1964 the controllers of the new regime kept the 1946 constitution and promised to restore democracy as soon as possible. However, they did not and were faced with a dilemma, as every major measure they took was strictly against that current constitution, including the coup itself. The so-called Institutional Acts sequentially issued by the military presidents were, in practice, placed higher than the Constitution and could amend it. Even under these circumstances, the first military president, Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco, was committed to restoring civilian rule in 1966. However, a large number of military and civilian extremists felt the military had to stay in power for some years. They also wanted to pass more \\"proper\\" laws to fight subversive individuals (anyone that opposed the regime). By 1965, however, the situation reached an unbearable point when opposition candidates won the governorship of Minas Gerais and Guanabara. Castelo Branco refused to annul the results. A coup was only averted when Castelo Branco agreed to support the military's reform program. By this time, the military had decided to drop all pretense of democracy. It also felt the 1946 constitution was \\"obsolete\\" as the \\"new institutions\\" were not foreseen in it. A new constitution was written by a team of lawyers commissioned by Castelo Branco and amended (under the instructions of Castelo Branco himself) by the Minister of Justice, Carlos Medeiros Silva and voted as whole by the Brazilian Parliament (already purged of most opponents of the status quo). = The Original Constitution = The main features of the new Constitution were: * Restriction of political rights: direct elections would only be held at state and county level, but not in federal territories or cities considered of interest to national security for any reason (such cities were specified as those near the international border, state capitals, \\"important\\" industrial centers, university towns, jungle towns, towns close to power plants, mining sites, etc.). About 500 cities/towns were listed--in practice, the largest and most important ones. Presidents and governors were chosen in indirect elections by the correspondent Legislative branch (the National Congress and State Legislatures). However, these \\"elections\\" were elaborate shams. In practice, the president was selected by the military command, while governors were hand- picked by the president and his advisers. The federal and state legislatures were dominated by government supporters, meaning the government candidate could not possibly be defeated. * Restriction of civil rights: any meeting, assembly or gathering of people should be formal, must be previously authorized and conducted under supervision. Unauthorized meetings would be disbanded by the police and participants sued if lucky; they were more likely imprisoned, tortured or worse. * Military (uniformed) State Police Corps acknowledged as reserve corps of the Federal Army (as well as State Fire Brigades), with the task of outdoor patrolling to \\"provide public security\\", thereby reducing the autonomy of the existing civilian (plainclothes) police, reduced to an investigative role. * Removal of all privileges of judges, allowing the president to force them to retire or to remove them (the latter was never used). * After previously disbanding of all political parties (which had existed for only twenty years), new rules were written on the formation of parties. These rules were so restrictive that only two parties were formed‚Äîthe government party, the National Renewal Alliance Party (Arena), and the controlled opposition of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB). * Limitation of states' autonomy. * Establishment of a series of controls, commissions and institutions to regulate and report a number of aspects of civil, social and economic life, thus intensifying an already existing trend towards bureaucracy, top-heavy management of the economy by the central government. * Granting the president the right to issue decrees (Decretos-Lei) that would enter in force at the moment of their publication and be inscribed in the statute-book after 30 days in the absence of Congressional deliberation on them. = Amendments of 1969 = In 1969, this already severely authoritarian document was widely amended by a provisional military junta and made even more repressive. The 1969 Amendment is sometimes regarded as a seventh Constitution, because it almost completely rewrote the text of the 1967 document. The new constitutional text brought some extra tools for the regime: * Giving the president the right to declare a state of emergency and suspend constitutional freedoms. * Broadened capital punishment. * Banishment ‚Äì with loss of citizenship ‚Äì as punishment. * Suspension of habeas corpus. * Special military courts to try members of the military accused of crimes. * Transfer of command of the military police from each federal state to the Ministry of the Army. * Restrictions on travel. From 1979 onward, however, the constitution was gradually purged of its authoritarian character. This process accelerated with the return of civilian rule in 1985, culminating in the adoption of a new constitution in 1988.  Citizen Constitution (1988‚Äìpresent)  President of the Constitutional Congress Ulysses Guimar√£es holds a copy of the 1988 Constitution. = Background = The seventh and current Brazilian Constitution was promulgated on October 5, 1988 after a two-year process in which it was written from scratch by a Constitutional Congress elected in 1986. = The Constitution = It appears as a reaction to the period of military dictatorship, seeking to guarantee all manner of rights and restricting the state's ability to limit freedom, to punish offenses and to regulate individual life. On the other hand, it did not provide clear rules for state reform and kept the economic regulation of the country intact. Among the new constitutional guarantees are the errand of injunction and the habeas data (one's right to have access to any data about him kept by the Government). It also anticipated the existence of a Consumers' Defence Code (which was brought out in 1990), of Children's and Youth Code (1990) and of a new Civil Code (2002). It was the first constitution to demand severe punishment for breaches of civil liberties and rights. Consequently, Brazil later approved a law making the propagation of prejudice against any minority or ethnic group an unbailable crime. This law provided legal redress against those who spread hate speech (like Neo-Nazis) or those who do not treat all citizens equally. This second aspect helped disabled people to have a reserved percentage of jobs in the public service (and soon in all large companies), and black people to seek reparation for prejudice in the courts. Breaking with the authoritarian logic of the Constitution of 1967, it made unbailable crimes those of torture and of actions directed against the democratic state and the constitutional order, thus creating constitutional devices to block coups d'√©tat of any kind. Constitutional congressman Bernardo Cabral wrote the final draft of the Constitution. Willing to create a truly democratic State, the Constitution has established many forms of direct popular participation besides regular voting, such as plebiscite, referendum and the possibility of ordinary citizens proposing new laws. Examples of these democratic mechanisms were the 1993 plebiscite concerning the form of government, where the Presidential system was confirmed, and the 2005 referendum concerning the prohibition of the sale of firearms and ammunition. The mention of God in the preamble of the Constitution (and later on the Brazilian currency) was opposed by most leftists as incompatible with freedom of religion because it does not recognize the rights of polytheists (like the Amerindians) or atheists, but it has not been removed so far. The only State Constitution that does not refer to God is the one of Acre. The Supreme Federal Court has ruled that this omission of the protection of God was not unconstitutional since the preamble of the constitution is simply an indication of principles that serves as an introduction to the constitutional text and reflects the ideological conceptions of the legislator, falling within the scope of political ideology and not of the Law. Therefore, the preamble which is not actually a part of the supreme law, has no judicial validity whatsoever and cannot impose obligations or create rights. = Amendments = Despite its advances concerning individual rights and freedoms and also in government control, the Constitutional text brought dispositions that resulted in severe difficulties concerning governmental efficiency. In the following years, especially from 1995 onwards, this it had to be amended many times to get rid of impractical, contradictory or unclear provisions (but also to accommodate the economic reforms conducted by the government, for which such amendments have been sometimes criticized ). As of December 2015, this Constitution has been amended 90 times.

Clear cell ovarian carcinoma is one of several subtypes of ovarian carcinoma. Clear cell is a subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer in contrast to non-epithelial cancers. According to research, most ovarian cancers start at the epithelial layer which is the lining of the ovary. Within this epithelial group clear cell ovarian carcinoma makes up about 5-10%. Clear cell ovarian carcinoma was recognized as a separate category of ovarian cancer by the World Health Organization in 1973. Its incidence rate differs across various ethnic groups. Reports from the United States show that the highest rates are among Asians with 11.1% versus whites with 4.8% and blacks at 3.1%. These numbers are consistent with the finding that although clear cell carcinomas are rare in Western countries they are much more common in parts of Asia.Fujiwara, K., Shintani, D., Nishikawa, T. (2016). Clear-cell carcinoma of the ovary. Annals of Oncology, 50i-52i. Background There are two subtypes of ovarian carcinoma - epithelial and nonepithelial; clear cell ovarian carcinoma is an epithelial ovarian cancer. The other major subtypes within this group include high-grade serous, endometrioid, mucinous, and low-grade serous. The serous type is the most common form of epithelial ovarian tumors. Cord-stromal and germ cell belong to the nonepithelial category which are much less common.Kalloger, S.E., Kobel, M., Leung, S., Mehl, E., Gao, D., Marcon, K.M. (2011). Calculator for ovarian carcinoma subtype prediction. Modern Pathology, 24, 512-521 Structure and function Clear-cell ovarian carcinoma often occurs as a pelvic mass that rarely appears bilaterally. The cells usually contain glycogen with large clear cytoplasm. It is also associated with endometriosis, a disorder of abnormal tissue growth outside of the uterus.Sugiyama, T., Kamura, T., Kigawa, J., Terakawa, N., Kikuchi, Y., Kita, T., Suzuki, M. (2000). Clinical Characteristics of Clear Cell Carcinoma of the Ovary. Cancer, 88(11), 2584-2589. The tumor cells emerge in a stepwise manner from adenofibromas which are benign endometriotic cysts. They also hold molecular genetic mutations in both ARID1A and PIK3CA, similar to other epithelial ovarian cancers. Mutations in ARID1A commonly contain phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) that are hypothesized to contribute to clear cell tumorigenesis. However, research also shows that inactivation of ARID1A alone does not lead to tumor initiation. However, clear cell tumors rarely carry p53, BRCA1, or BRCA2 mutations.Ayhan, A., Kuhn. E., Wu, R., Ogawa, H., Talbott, A., Mao. T., Sugimura, H. (2017). CCNE1 copy-number gain and overexpression identify ovarian clear cell carcinoma with a poor prognosis. Modern Pathology, 30, 297-303. In addition, they also test negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors and Wilm tumor suppressor 1.Fujiwara, K., Shintani, D., Nishikawa, T. (2016). Clear-cell carcinoma of the ovary. Annals of Oncology, 50i-52i. Studies have also suggested that clear-cell can occur with thromboembolic complications and hypercalcemia. Recurrence of tumor cells have been reported to involve lymph nodes and parenchymal organs. Research continues to look for ways to understand clear cell tumor progression. A suggested mechanism is the amplification and overexpression of CCNE1 which is thought to promote the tumor's aggressive behavior. In addition, they also test negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors and Wilm tumor suppressor 1.Fujiwara, K., Shintani, D., Nishikawa, T. (2016). Clear-cell carcinoma of the ovary. Annals of Oncology, 50i-52i. The CCNE1 gene encodes for the cyclin E1 protein which accumulates at the G1-S phase transition point of the cell cycle. Detecting the cancerous tumor progression can be difficult for pathologists. While some tumors will appear in the ovary, others spread over the outer lining of the ovary and to other organs such as the uterus, fallopian tube, and lymph glands. Clinical relevance Clear cell tumors are frequently found at an early stage and therefore can be cured with surgery. Through clinical examination or preoperative imaging techniques, tumors have been reported to range from 3-20 cm. Most ovarian tumors are benign and rarely spread past the ovary. Therefore, surgical removal of the ovary or partial removal of the ovary is sufficient for treatment for malignant tumors. When diagnosed beyond FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage 1 patients usually have a poor prognosis. If the malignant tumors metastasize and spread throughout the body then they could potentially be fatal. Clear cell tumors have been found to be resistant to conventional chemotherapy using platinum and taxane. Although the cause of this chemoresistance is unknown, there is research that provides partial explanation of this occurrence. For example, studies show that clear cell tumor cells proliferate at lower rates than serous adenocarcinomas which then could aid in a lower response from clear cell tumors to chemotherapies.Chan, J.K., Teoh, D., Hu, J.M., Shin, J.Y., Osann, K., Kapp, D.S. (2008). Do clear cell ovarian carcinomas have poorer prognosis compared to other epithelial cell types? A study of 1411 clear cell ovarian cancers. Gynecologic Oncology, 109(3), 370-376. Given that treatment options are limited for clear cell ovarian cancer patients, researchers are studying biomarkers or specific pathways that could aid in developing future treatment. These patients are good candidates for targeted therapies since the standard does not adequately help their care. Some suggested therapeutic targets include the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, VEGF, Il-6/STAT3, MET, and HNF-1beta pathways.Mabuchi, S., Sugiyama, T., Kimura, T. (2016). Clear cell carcinoma of the ovary: molecular insights and future therapeutic perspectives. Journal of Gynecologic Oncology, 27(3), 1-14. Better insight into genomic heterogeneity would also provide a personalized approach to identifying treatment targets for clear cell tumor patients that share similar phenotypes. Developing stronger options is also beneficial because ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths for women and is one of the most lethal gynecological cancers.

PTEN mutations are more frequent in low-grade endometrial endometrioid carcinomas (67%) compared with low-grade ovarian endometrioid carcinomas (17%). By contrast, CTNNB1 mutations are significantly different in low-grade ovarian endometrioid carcinomas (53%) compared with low-grade endometrial endometrioid carcinomas (28%). This difference in CTNNB1 mutation frequency may be reflective of the distinct tumoral microenvironments; the epithelial cells lining an endometriotic cyst within the ovary are exposed to a highly oxidative environment that promotes tumorigenesis.

Approximately 75% are benign, 10% are borderline and 15% are malignant. Rarely, the tumor is seen bilaterally; approximately 5% of primary mucinous tumors are bilateral. Benign mucinous tumors are typically multilocular (have several lobes), and the cysts have a smooth lining of epithelium that resembles endocervical epithelial cells with small numbers of gastrointestinal-type epithelial cells. Borderline and malignant mucinous tumors often have papillae and solid areas. There may also be hemorrhage and necrosis. Pathology sample of a mucinous tumor of the ovary. It is well documented that malignancy may be only focally present in mucinous neoplasms of the ovary, so thorough sampling is imperative. The major distinguishing features of mucinous tumors are that the tumors are filled with a mucus-like material, which gives them their name; this mucus is produced by mucus- secreting goblet cells very similar to the cells lining normal intestine. These tumors may become very large, some have been weighed as large as 25 kilograms. Cystadenocarcinomas (malignant tumors) contain a more solid growth pattern with the hallmarks of malignancy: cellular atypia and stratification, loss of the normal architecture of the tissue, and necrosis. The appearance can look similar to colonic cancer. Clear stromal invasion is used to differentiate borderline tumors from malignant tumors. Pseudomyxoma peritonei may present as a result of an ovarian mucinous tumor, however this is a rare cause of this condition, which is a rare condition. A more common cause of pseudomyxoma peritonei is a mucin-producing tumor of the appendix. Since mucinous tumors arising from the ovary usually only involve one ovary, the presence of involvement in both ovaries with a mucinous tumor suggests that the tumor may have arisen in another location, and further study is warranted. The risk of mucinous tumors is significantly associated with smoking: relative risk for current smokers 2.22 (2.22 times the risk for non-smokers) and 2.02 for past smokers. Risk is also associated with smoking duration: relative risk per 20 years was 1.44. See article by Tworoger SS in Cancer March 1, 2008 using data from the Nurses Health Study. Prognosis 10-year survival rates for mucinous tumors is excellent in the absence of invasion. In the case of borderline tumors confined to the ovary and malignant tumors without invasion, the survival rates are 90% or greater.

They are common neoplasms with a strong tendency to occur bilaterally, and they account for approximately a quarter of all ovarian tumors. Low grade  The \\"low grade\\" classification of serous tumors includes benign and borderline tumors, as well as low grade malignant tumors. Benign serous tumors are distinguished from borderline tumors by the absence of cellular stratification. Stromal invasion distinguishes borderline tumors from low grade malignant tumors. Surgery is curative for benign tumors, and likely curative for other low grade tumors. Benign serous tumors include serous cystadenomas, cystadenofibromas, and adenofibromas. Benign and borderline serous tumours are commonly unilocular. Benign tumors contain clear fluid and have a smooth lining composed of columnar epithelial cells with cilia. On gross examination, the serous tumor may present as either a cystic lesion in which the papillary epithelium is contained within a few fibrous walled cysts, or the papillary projections may be away from the surface epithelium. In borderline lesions, the cyst or surface is lined by papillary structures, which are often very complex. Microscopically, stromal papillae are covered by atypical epithelial cells, but stromal invasion is absent, and nuclear stratification is present. Approximately 15% of serous tumors are borderline. In borderline tumors and low grade carcinomas, psammoma bodies are often found. Serous psammocarcinoma is a low grade variant in which massive psammoma bodies are present. High grade  serous tumor: A. Low-magnification view shows a focal high-grade serous carcinoma developing from the papillae (square) in a background of a typical serous borderline tumor. B. Higher magnification demonstrates enlarged and atypical high-grade serous carcinoma cells that organize in a papillary architecture. C and D. Immunohistochemistry of p53 shows that high-grade serous carcinoma cells are diffusely positive for p53, a pattern consistent with a missense TP53 mutation while the adjacent epithelial cells from the background serous borderline tumor are only focally and weakly positive, a pattern consistent with a wild-type TP53 sequence. \\\\- \\"Figure 3- available via license: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\\" High grade serous tumors often involve both ovaries. The tumors are solid and cystic with haemorrhage and necrosis. They are morphologically heterogenous. Serous carcinomas often have bulky peritoneal and omental metastases, and spread to the lymph nodes is frequent. Unsurprisingly, 5-year survival decreases as the stage increases. There is a 25% survival rate with a stage III serous carcinoma. Staging: * Stage I - Tumour growth limited to ovaries. * Stage II - Growth involving one or both ovaries with pelvic extension. * Stage III - Tumour involving one or both ovaries with implants outside pelvis. * Stage IV- Tumour involving one or both ovaries with presence of distant metastasis.

Neoplasms in this group are thought to be derived from the ovarian surface epithelium (modified peritoneum) or from ectopic endometrial or Fallopian tube (tubal) tissue. Tumors of this type are also called ovarian adenocarcinoma. This group of tumors accounts for 90% to 95% of all cases of ovarian cancer.

Epithelial-stromal tumors are classified on the basis of the epithelial cell type, the relative amounts of epithelium and stroma, the presence of papillary processes, and the location of the epithelial elements. Microscopic pathological features determine whether a surface epithelial-stromal tumor is benign, a borderline tumor, or malignant (evidence of malignancy and stromal invasion). Borderline tumors are of uncertain malignant potential. This group consists of serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell, and brenner (transitional cell) tumors, though there are a few mixed, undifferentiated and unclassified types. =Serous tumors= Histopathology of lining of a benign serous tumor of the ovary. Benign serous ovarian tumors are thin walled unilocular cysts that are lined by ciliated pseudostratified cuboidal or columnar epithelium. *These tumors vary in size from small and nearly imperceptible to large, filling the abdominal cavity. *Benign, borderline, and malignant types of serous tumors account for about 30% of all ovarian tumors. *75% are benign or of borderline malignancy, and 25% are malignant *The malignant form of this tumor, serous cystadenocarcinoma, accounts for approximately 40% of all carcinomas of the ovary and are the most common malignant ovarian tumors. *Benign and borderline tumors are most common between the ages of 20 and 50 years. *Malignant serous tumors occur later in life on average, although somewhat earlier in familial cases. *20% of benign, 30% of borderline, and 66% of malignant tumors are bilateral (affect both ovaries). Components can include: #cystic areas #cystic and fibrous areas #predominantly fibrous areas The chance of malignancy of the tumor increases with the amount of solid areas present, including both papillary structures and any necrotic tissue present.

The five year survival rate of borderline tumors and malignant tumors confined to the ovaries are 100% and 70% respectively. If the peritoneum is involved, these rates become 90% and 25%. While the 5-year survival rates of borderline tumors are excellent, this should not be seen as evidence of cure, as recurrences can occur many years later. =Mucinous tumors= Histopathology of lining of a benign mucinous tumor of the ovary. Benign mucinous ovarian tumors consist of simple, nonstratified columnar epithelium with basally-located hyperchromatic nuclei and resemble gastric foveolar epithelium. \\\\- Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license Mucinous tumors: *Closely resemble their serous counterparts but unlikely to be bilateral *Somewhat less common, accounting for about 25% of all ovarian neoplasms * In some cases mucinous tumors are characterized by more cysts of variable size and a rarity of surface involvement as compared to serous tumors *Also in comparison to serous tumors, mucinous tumors are less frequently bilateral, approximately 5% of primary mucinous tumors are bilateral. *May form very large cystic masses, with recorded weights exceeding 25 kg Pathology Mucinous tumors are characterized by a lining of tall columnar epithelial cells with apical mucin and the absence of cilia, similar in appearance with benign cervical or intestinal epithelia. The appearance can look similar to colonic or ovarian cancer, but typically originates from the appendix (see mucinous adenocarcinoma with clinical condition Pseudomyxoma peritonei). Clear stromal invasion is used to differentiate borderline tumors from malignant tumors. Prognosis 10-year survival rates for borderline tumors contained within the ovary, malignant tumors without invasion, and invasive malignant tumors are greater than 95%, 90%, and 66%, respectively. One rare but noteworthy condition associated with mucinous ovarian neoplasms is pseudomyxoma peritonei. As primary ovarian mucinous tumors are usually unilateral (in one ovary), the presentation of bilateral mucinous tumors requires exclusion of a non-ovarian origin, usually the appendix. =Endometrioid tumors= Endometrioid tumors account for approximately 20% of all ovarian cancers and are mostly malignant (endometroid carcinomas). They are made of tubular glands bearing a close resemblance to benign or malignant endometrium. 15-30% of endometrioid carcinomas occur in individuals with carcinoma of the endometrium, and these patients have a better prognosis. They appear similar to other surface epithelial-stromal tumors, with solid and cystic areas. 40% of these tumors are bilateral, when bilateral, metastases is often present. Pathology *Glands bearing a strong resemblance to endometrial-type glands **Benign tumors have mature-appearing glands in a fibrous stroma **Borderline tumors have a complex branching pattern without stromal invasion **Carcinomas (malignant tumors) have invasive glands with crowded, atypical cells, frequent mitoses. With poorer differentiation, the tumor becomes more solid. Prognosis Prognosis again is dependent on the spread of the tumor, as well as how differentiated the tumor appears. The overall prognosis is somewhat worse than for serous or mucinous tumors, and the 5-year survival rate for patients with tumors confined to the ovary is approximately 75%. =Clear cell tumors= Micrograph of an ovarian clear cell carcinoma. H&E; stain. Clear cell tumors are characterized by large epithelial cells with abundant clear cytoplasm and may be seen in association with endometriosis or endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary, bearing a resemblance to clear cell carcinoma of the endometrium. They may be predominantly solid or cystic. If solid, the clear cells tend to be arranged in sheets or tubules. In the cystic variety, the neoplastic cells make up the cyst lining. Prognosis These tumors tend to be aggressive, the five year survival rate for tumors confined to the ovaries is approximately 65%. If the tumor has spread beyond the ovary at diagnosis, the prognosis is poor =Brenner tumor= Brenner tumour. H&E; stain. Brenner tumors are uncommon surface- epithelial stromal cell tumors in which the epithelial cell (which defines these tumors) is a transitional cell. These are similar in appearance to bladder epithelia. The tumors may be very small to very large, and may be solid or cystic. Histologically, the tumor consists of nests of the aforementioned transitional cells within surrounding tissue that resembles normal ovary. Brenner tumors may be benign or malignant, depending on whether the tumor cells invade the surrounding tissue. =Small cell tumors= Small cell ovarian cancer (SCCO) are generally classified into epithelial tumorsAtlas of Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncology and Haematology - Ovary: Epithelial tumors. Retrieved June 2014. By Lee-Jones, L. Atlas Genet Cytogenet Oncol Haematol. 2004;8(2):115-133. associated with distinctive endocrine features. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recognises SCCO as two distinct entities: Small Cell Ovarian Cancer of Hypercalcemic Type (SCCOHT) and Small Cell Ovarian Cancer of Pulmonary Type (SCCOPT). Small cell tumours are rare and aggressive, they contribute to less than 2% of all gynaecologic malignancies. The average age of diagnosis is 24 years old, and the majority of patients also present with hypercalcemia (62%). It typically present with a unilateral large tumor. Most women die within a year of diagnosis. Treatment For more general information, see ovarian cancer. Research suggests that in the first line treatment of Endometrial Ovarian Cancer (EOC), Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin paired with Carboplatin is a satisfactory alternative to Paclitaxel with Carboplatin. In people with platinum-sensitive relapsed EOC, research has found that Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin with Carboplatin is a better treatment than Paclitaxel with Carboplatin. For advanced cancer of this histology, the US National Cancer Institute recommends a method of chemotherapy that combines intravenous (IV) and intraperitoneal (IP) administration. Preferred chemotherapeutic agents include a platinum drug with a taxane. Metastases For surface epithelial-stromal tumors, the most common sites of metastasis are the pleural cavity (33%), the liver (26%), and the lungs (3%). Effect on fertility Fertility subsequent to treatment of surface epithelial-stromal tumors depends mainly on histology and initial staging to separate it into early borderline (or more benign) versus advanced stages of borderline (or more malignant). Conservative management (without bilateral oophorectomy) of early stage borderline tumors have been estimated to result in chance of over 50% of spontaneous pregnancy with a low risk of lethal recurrence of the tumor (0.5%). On the other hand, in cases of conservative treatment in advanced stage borderline tumors, spontaneous pregnancy rates have been estimated to be 35% and the risk of lethal recurrence 2%.

In the tradition from the Old French prose, he is associated with the Questing Beast and is the slayer of King Lot. His many children include the sons Aglovale, Lamorak and Percival, and the daughter Dindrane.  In medieval literature  Pellinor's attributed arms Pellinore is a major figure in the 13th-century Post-Vulgate prose cycle and the sections of Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur based on it. There, as son of King Pellam and brother of Kings Pelles (the Fisher King) and Alain, he is most famous for his endless hunt of the Questing Beast, which he is tracking when King Arthur first meets him. Though he claims his bloodline is destined perpetually to chase this bizarre monster, Sir Palamedes the Saracen takes up the quest, and, according to one version, slays the beast. Pellinore beats King Arthur after three jousts and breaks the sword Arthur had withdrawn from the stone (in some versions this is Excalibur, though he gets another sword of that name from the Lady of the Lake soon after). Merlin throws a spell of enchantment on Pellinore to save Arthur's life. Arthur praises Pellinore's skill, and they soon become friends, with Arthur inviting him to join the Round Table. Pellinore then helps Arthur in his early wars against rebelling vassals, but when he kills King Lot of Orkney during the Battle of Tarabel (or Dimilioc), he sparks a blood feud between his and Lot's family that results in his death by Gawain and his brothers and the deaths of many others. Pellinore was said to have been of the royal line of Joseph of Arimathea, whose dynasty guards the Holy Grail, according to Arthurian lore. In the Livre d'Artus, Pellinore is called the \\"Maimed King\\" after being wounded by a holy spear, having doubted the powers of the Grail. \\"King Pellinore and the Damsel at the Well\\", Francis Arthur Fraser's illustration for Henry Frith's King Arthur & His Knights of the Round Table (1884) Pellinore has many legitimate and illegitimate children. His sons Tor, Aglovale, Lamorak, Dornar and Percival all eventually join the Round Table as well. It is Percival, who was one of the first Grail seekers, and his grand nephew, Galahad, who finally succeeds in the quest. His daughter, Percival's sister sometimes known as Dindrane, becomes a servant of the Grail and helps them achieve the mystical objective as the \\"Grail heroine\\". Another of his daughters, Alyne, dies early when he unknowingly ignores her pleas for help during his pursuit of the Questing Beast.  In modern fiction  * In T. H. White's The Once and Future King, he is a bumbling but endearing old man who cannot give up his search for the \\"Questin' Beast\\" lest the poor creature die of loneliness. He also tends to say the word \\"what\\" after his sentences (Merlyn makes fun of him by stating: \\"‚Ä¶Or, if I were King Pellinore, I would say 'what what, what?'\\") In White's novel, Pellinore is vengefully put to death by Sir Gawain and/or his brothers, for unintentionally killing their father, King Lot of Orkney, in a jousting match. **Pellinore appears in the 1963 Walt Disney Studios film adaptation of The Sword in the Stone, where he is voiced by actor Alan Napier. A friend of Sir Ector, he announces the jousting tournament that will be held in London, with the winner being crowned king. Pellinore is mild-mannered, and wise, appalled at the idea of Kay being king due to his bitter nature. He is one of the first to recognise the sword pulled by Arthur from the stone. He, also along with another knight, Sir Bart, stands up for Arthur, and encourages the boy to successfully remove the sword from the stone. * In the musical Camelot, Pellinore (or \\"Pelly\\", as he is often called by Arthur) is a comical, much- loved, permanent guest of Arthur and Guinevere. He is however, somewhat unsure of Arthur's new ideas for a new order of chivalry, being against \\"...any new ideas\\" on principle. Pellinore is still with Arthur before Arthur fights his final battle at the end of the play/film; and when Arthur knights the young boy \\"Tom of Warwick\\". * In Bernard Cornwell's The Warlord Chronicles, Pellinore is represented as an old mad man, kept in a cage and commanding imaginary armies. After King Gundleus' sacking of the Tor at Ynys Wydryn (Avalon), Pellinore is retrieved from the Tor by Arthur's men and taken to Caer Cadarn, where he is locked in a store room. While there, Owain argues that he should be sent to the Isle of the Dead, however when Arthur decides to rebuild the Tor, Pellinore is sent back with Nimue and Morgan to continue his life as before.

Retrieved 11 December 2011 From May 2009 to 2014, he was a member of parliament of India in the 15th Lok Sabha, having been elected from the Jadavpur constituency in Kolkata from All India Trinamool Congress. He changed his name from Suman Chattopadhyay to Kabir Suman when he converted to Islam as a mark of protest against the killing of Christian missionary Graham Staines by a former member of Bajrang Dal. He shot to fame in the 1990s with albums such as Tomake Chai (I Want You) and Boshe Anko (Sit-and-Draw). Kabir Suman was the pioneer of alternative Bengali music around 1991. He advocated a new trend in Bengali Music with songs that were written, composed and sung, all by a single individual. Many contemporary solo artists like Anjan Dutta, Nachiketa Chakraborty, and Rupam Islam tried to follow this trend. He has influenced bands like Chandrabindoo. He is the first singer of Bengali music industry who is a multi-instrumentalist. He plays the piano, guitar, harmonica and the melodica in his live concerts. The majority of his concerts are entirely solo. He is the first Indian musician who has recorded a complete album, where a solo artist has written, composed, sung, recorded, mixed and mastered all the songs. Early life =Childhood and Family= Kabir Suman at his childhood Suman was born in a Bengali Hindu family on 16 March 1949 to Sudhindranath and Uma Chattopadhyay at Cuttack, Odisha. He started his training in classical music at a very young age, under the tutelage of his father. Although he learned Rabindrasangeet and Khayal since his childhood, his father did not want Suman to take up professional singing as he believed that the masses never respect a professional singer. His parents were professional singers, and had recorded a number of gramophone records. They were accomplished radio artists. He studied at St.Lawrence High School,Kolkata. Late Sudhindranath Chattopadhyay was a generous listener of Indian artists like Ustad Amir Khan, Pandit Nikhil Banerjee, Ustad Bismillah Khan, Dilip Kumar Roy, Jnan Prakash Ghosh, Sachin Dev Burman, Salil Chowdhury, Nachiketa Ghosh, Hemanta Mukherjee, Pannalal Bhattacharya and Pankaj Mullick, as well as foreign compositions of Mozart, Beethoven, Paul Robeson, The Beatles and Elvis Presley, which enriched Suman's childhood. Suman says that he could have never been able to become a musician, had he not listened to these records since his childhood. Sudhindranath got an opportunity to study music under Rabindranath Tagore in his youth although it was not possible for him to afford the costs due to financial constraints. At a very young age, Suman accompanied his father to Shantiniketan where he got the opportunity to observe Reel to real tape recording, and met Kanika Banerjee, a Rabindrasangeet maestro. Suman's elder brother Anandarup Chatterjee was also an accomplished singer and harmonica player though he never took up singing professionally. When Suman was young, Pandit Girin Chakrabarty had suggested his mother to teach him the sarod, although this idea was never materialised. Radio played an important role in his life at that time. He started playing the harmonium and harmonica around the early 1960s. For a short period, he also played the taish≈çgoto. Suman's first public performance was in 1958, as a child singer, where his father accompanied him with the harmonium. In the same year he performed at the much revered Shishumahal Auditorium. Around 1959, he learned Opera music under the guidance of Father Pinto, the man responsible for popularising opera music in India. He sang in a radio program under the direction of renowned composer Pankaj Kumar Mallik as well. Acharya Kalipada Das & Chinmoy Lahiri taught him the khayal. Suman also idolised Sukumar Ray and Abanindranath Tagore and was greatly influenced by their language form and rhythm. Suman added tune to a poem of Rabindranath Tagore, when he was just fourteen. That was his first musical creation. Along with his continuous learning of Indian Classical Music, he also listened to Western singers like Pat Boone, Jim Reeves, Nat King Cole, Nina & Frederick, The Kingston Trio and Frank Sinatra. He was deeply inspired by Ustad Amir Khan. Suman auditioned for Akashbani as a singer and received the ‚ÄòB-high‚Äô grade in Rabindrasangeet and Modern Music and‚ÄòB‚Äô grade in Nazrulgeeti from Akashbani at the tender age of 16. =Youth= When he was seventeen, he started adding tune to lyrics and poems. He graduated with an honours in English Literature from Jadavpur University and did a diploma in the French language and the German language. He read modern Bengali poems, especially those written by the Hungry Generation as well as English poems. He was highly inspired by the works of Samar Sen, Subhash Mukhopadhyay and T. S. Eliot. =Rethinking about Bengali Songs= Around 1968, while learning Himangshu Dutta compositions, he felt that in spite of their compositional strength, they did not represent the contemporary times, lyrically. He observed that the language and thinking of modern poems, story, novel, essay, journalism, drama, cinema and magazine have started changing, but not Bengali music. At that time the political environment of West Bengal started changing. It was a turbulent time in Bengal. The Naxalbari Movement was slowly gaining strength. Emergency was imposed by Indira Gandhi. Kolkata witnessed daily bombings, arrests of the common people and police atrocities on those involved in the Naxal movement. The Vietnam War, Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh and Che Guevara became icons of the Bengali youth, but this did not reflect in contemporary Bengali songs. He felt that he was not satisfied with the music he sang because those songs did not represent his time. He felt that he had to write his own songs if he had to sing. He gave up learning under Kalipada Das. He resigned from Akashbani, stopped recording for INRECO and decided to focus on writing his own songs. Early Recordings Kabir Suman's first studio recording was in 1972. It was a 7-inch single record, with one song on both sides, written and composed by Rabindranath Tagore. It was released from Hindusthan Records. He was accompanied on flute, guitar, violin and tabla by other musicians. Subinoy Roy helped him in the recording, and this recording was done under the guidance of Sudhindranath Chatterjee. His second single vinyl record was published in 1973, from the same company, this was also a two-song record of Rabindranath Tagore. Both these records were commercially unsuccessful, but he got some small scale popularity and received the opportunity to perform in live concerts. Influence of Bob Dylan and songwriting After quitting Akashbani (All India Radio) he joined a clerical post at United Bank of India. Kabir Suman shifted to France temporarily to teach the basics of Indian Classical Music in 1973. It was in France that he first listened to Bob Dylan‚Äôs \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\"‚Äô from the album The Freewheeling Bob Dylan. Dylan's simple music with an acoustic guitar and harmonica, unconventional voice, and offbeat lyrics, compositions and genre gave him a \\"shock\\". He also got the opportunity to listen to the compositions of Phil Ochs, Fados, Shanson and realized that Western music has changed a lot, and successfully represents its time and its people. This was when his will to write his own songs strengthened. He started listening to all types of music from the street side accordion to the pipe-organ in the Notre-Dame de Paris church. He also started playing the monophonic synthesizer. =Return to Kolkata= After returning to Kolkata, he stopped professional singing completely to focus on songwriting. He tried writing poems, but it was not satisfactory. His father suggested him to learn some musical instrument, and his parents inspired him not to stop singing completely. =First song= Suman's first songs was a six liner \\"E Kemon Akash Dekhale Tumi‚Äô‚Äô. This song is still unreleased. Soon after, he left for West Germany. 1975‚Äî1979: In West Germany Kabir Suman went to West Germany on 12th May, 1975 to study literature at the age of 26. He started learning the German Language for his convenience at work and worked part-time alongside his studies. At the end of 1975, Voice of Germany opened a Bengali department in Cologne, and he applied for a job there. They gave him some translation work, and he gradually became a regular freelancer for the Voice of Germany‚ÄîBengali division. In Germany, works of German & Austrian musicians like Wolf Biermann, Andr√© Heller inspired him. The stage performance, lyrics and composition of Biermann changed his earlier concept of live performance, which would later have a great impact on his own stage performances. German Cabaret also taught him some lessons. He met Bengali poet Shahid Qadri in Germany. Back in Kolkata In May 1979, Suman returned to Kolkata, with an order to send at least two articles to Voice of Germany every month. He worked as a teacher of German at Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Kolkata, and the Max Mueller Bhavan. He started working in the Bengali daily Aajkal as a part-timer, and also contributed to the Desh until 1980. He joined a band called \\"Samatan\\". However, this band was unsuccessful and the members broke up very soon. Some members of Samatan and some new members, all in their twenties and thirties joined him to establish a new band called ‚ÄòNagarik : Anya Katha Anya Gan‚Äô. Kamal Sarkar was the main lyricist and composer. During this time Suman completed his first song (written in 1975) \\"E Kemon Akash Dekhale Tumi\\". He also started playing the Melodica and the Accordion. He wrote his second song \\"Bhalo Lagchhe Na Asahya Ei Dinkal\\", which was highly appreciated by his fellow band members. He started writing songs, breaking the song structure in two or three parts by Counter Point Harmony. After this he wrote another song \\"Satchallish Noy Swadhinata\\", the tune of which was inspired from a movie My Name Is Nobody. Shahid Kadri's poem \\"Rashtra Manei Left Right‚Äô‚Äô was transcripted by him as a song \\"Rashtra‚Äô‚Äô. After this he wrote \\"Tomake Bhababoi\\"(finally released in 1994), and \\"Manusher Itihas Likhte Habe\\", which was a transcription of a Bertolt Brecht poem. At that time Nagarik performed at two concerts at Ballygunge Science College & Gorky Sadan. Nagarik used the accordion, melodica, and conga. However Suman felt that his musical talent was not being cultivated properly at Nagarik as he received limited opportunities to sing. 1980‚Äî1985: In USA Kabir Suman went to the US for a job in Voice of America, and he decided to join it. He planned with his friend that he would learn Western music and buy as many musical instruments as he can, and after five years he would return to Kolkata, to develop his musical career further. =Learning electronic keyboard= Kabir Suman practicing organ & keyboards After reaching the US, he bought a portable keyboard when he got his first salary, and started practising to play with both hands. After two months he bought a Double Deck Organ in monthly instalments and continued practicing. At this time he started fully learning keyboard instrument with theory, chord practice, notation reading and writing etc. with the help of many American books and cassettes. He also started playing Hammond Organ and Moog Synthesizer during this time. Many songs including \\"Agun Dekhechhi Ami\\"(finally published in 1993), \\"Duchokh Buje Jao\\", \\"Hazar Bachhar Dhare\\", \\"America Prabasi Bangalir Gan\\", \\"Sararat Jwelechhe\\" (finally published in 1994), \\"Bandhu Amar Ei Hat Dharo\\" etc. were created during this period. During this period Kabir Suman decided to go to Nicaragua to feel the environment of the Sandinista Revolution. He started learning Spanish, and also history, politics and literature of Latin America, and also created a song \\"Jwalbe Agun\\" (finally published in 2012) about this revolution. In the meantime he bought two synthesizers, two organs, one keyboard, one four track tape recorder, one master recorder, microphone etc., and started multi track recording. Salil Chowdhury met with him in early 1982, when Suman was living in Silver Spring, Maryland. In this period, he started sending a feature in each month for Desh magazine under the pseudonym Manab Mitra, and also started writing in the ‚ÄôFrontier‚Äô magazine. Around 1983 he took some interviews of Paul Swizi, Harry Magdoff, Leroy Jones, Amiri Baraka, Noam Chomsky, George Wald, Maxine Klein, Holly Near, Maya Angelou, Barbara Ehrenreich, Bertel Wolman, Annette Rubinstein, and Pete Seeger. During this interview period, Kabir Suman made an intimate relation as a friend, philosopher and guide with Pete Seeger. Seeger inspired Suman very much about his songwriting, composing etc. He also helped Suman to go to Nicaragua for knowing details about the revolution. Suman returned to Kolkata in early 1985. He bought many instruments, applicable for a complete recording studio, which were sent to Kolkata by ship. After returning to Kolkata, he rejoined with ‚ÄòNagarik‚Äô with some new vocalists and instrumentalists, and continued writing and composing songs, thinking mainly as group songs. After more than five years, ‚ÄòNagarik‚Äô again performed in a concert at Birla Academy Hall, where Kabir Suman played electronic keyboards. Other instruments were guitar, tabla, conga, drums and nal. After seeing the concert, Biman Ghosh, one of the officers of The Gramophone Company of India offered ‚ÄôNagarik‚Äô to record an album in both vinyl record and cassette tape format. He insisted on Suman repeatedly to sing some songs on the forthcoming album, along with playing keyboards, but ultimately the recording company did not show much interest about alternative Bengali songs, and the recording was not done. =Breakup of Nagarik= From early 1986, ‚ÄòNagarik‚Äô started swinging due to clash of personality. Kabir Suman created some songs at that time like \\"Hariye Jeo Na\\", \\"Tomake Chai\\" (finally published in 1992), \\"Aro Balo Aro Katha\\" (partially published in 1992), \\"Machhi O Mara Mukher Gan\\", \\"Najehal Akashta\\", \\"Robbar\\" (finally published in 1994), \\"Tumi Gan Gaile (finally sung by Indranil Sen and published in 2002), \\"Ganahatyar Nam Bhopal\\", \\"Tirikshi Mejajer Je Lokta\\", \\"Abhibadan\\" (finally published in 1994) etc. His efforts became mostly useless because most members of ‚ÄòNagarik‚Äô were not practising at home, so complex compositions made them troubled. Some old members departed, and some new members arrived. They planned to record some of his songs on cassette tape, the entire recording was planned domestically in his home at Baishnabghata. Kabir Suman himself had written, composed, sung and played electronic keyboard on the recording. There were some other vocalists and instrumentalists, instruments included guitar and percussions. The entire recording was done by his four track tape recorder, where live vocals and live instruments were recorded in two tracks by all vocalists, and Kabir Suman himself added more electronic sounds on the rest of the two tracks by playing synthesizer. His book \\"Mukta Nicaragua\\" about Sandinista revolution was published by K.P. Bagchi Publication at that time (republished many years later), but another book \\"Anya America\\" failed to get published. He also recorded some information and song about Sandinista Revolution at that time. During this time he constructed a recording studio named ‚ÄôSing To Live‚Äô inside an abandoned factory near Bansdroni. 1986‚Äî1989: In West Germany Kabir Suman was not sure about the future of his created songs, and also not interested to involve in a general job. He thought if he could go to a foreign country as an employee, he could buy many electronic music instruments. Thinking thus, he went to West Germany again in September 1986, and before departure he recorded another album of ‚ÄòNagarik‚Äô, following the procedure just written before, but this time in the new studio he constructed. =Learning guitar= After reaching West Germany, he started learning classical guitar. During this time he felt that guitar is a simple instrument, which could be played by a solo musician, and there is no question about any type of multi-instrument orchestra. Also a guitar makes a man moving-minded. Under an Italian teacher, he started learning guitar, with Finger-style, sight-reading, listening many guitarists‚Äô records like Andr√©s Segovia, Julian Bream etc., and also started learning jazz guitar & blues guitar. He then started song creation on guitar, like \\"Hal Chherho Na Bandhu\\" (finally published in 1992), \\"Gan-ola\\" (finally published in 1994), etc. These guitar based songs started influencing of Baul, Bhawaiya, Kirtan, Folk, Blues and also some Ragas. Suman returned to Kolkata in early 1989. He bought many instruments like before, this time both keyboard and guitar. Struggling as a newcomer musician After returning to Kolkata, he saw ‚ÄôNagarik‚Äô has almost disbanded because of ego-clash, and the studio is also in a sinking mood. He decided to be a solo professional singer-songwriter and musician, and thought to work in some advertisement business, but nothing materialized. During this time he wrote some songs like \\"Tin Shataker Shahar\\", \\"Chena Duhkha Chena Sukh\\" (finally published in 1992), \\"Pratham Sabkichhu\\" (finally published in 1994) etc. =First public performance with own song= In February 1990, a singer named Raju Bal took a gentleman Indranil Gupta to Suman's house. Indranil listened the \\"Tin Shataker Shahar\\" and liked it, and told Suman that Kolkata Festival was being held in Yuba Bharati Krirangan remembering the so-called tri-centenary celebration of Kolkata City, and that song relates with this, so he should sing this song at that festival. Kabir Suman in his rented flat at Bhabanipur He felt nervous because he was performing on stage after 17 years, and he was completely unknown, with his style. He sang \\"Tin Shataker Shahar\\" with guitar, then \\"Tomake Chai\\" and finally \\"Amader Janya\\" ‚Äì both with electronic keyboard. The audiences became highly appreciative about his songs and music after hearing three songs and started applauding seeking encore. Kabir Suman felt very happy to realize that his song got the favour of the general public, and became optimistic. He started to practise his voice with the help of electronic tanpura, continued keyboard and guitar playing, and also creating songs with some contemporary incidents. Kabir Suman performed first time as a professional singer in December 1990. He got appreciation from Dr. Barin Roy, Gour Kishor Ghosh, Ashis Chattopadhay etc. Shubhendu Maity helped him by giving him a chance to perform in some concerts. His songs have not impressed the rural people, but urban and suburban people appreciated them very much. He also sang at some political meetings of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). During this time some controversy arose over one of his songs \\"Anita Dewan\\". =Solo live performance= Kabir Suman performed his first solo live performance on 5 May 1991 at Shishir Mancha. Many magazines and newspapers were invited, like Aajkal, Desh, Business Standard, The Statesman, and they reviewed it. ‚ÄòDesh‚Äô first labeled his songs as ‚ÄòSumaner Gan‚Äô, which popularized his songs after this time and still now. But although those reviews were positive, not many invitations other from than his friend circle happened. He performed in some live programs with the help of his friends. All those were very unsure, and Kabir Suman also was not optimistic at that time about his eligibility. Many people of advertisement business got him to do jingles or theme songs including \\"Lexpo 1991\\", but some of them either gave him not a single penny, others gave him very little money, despite the fact that Kabir Suman made all this work completely alone with writing, composing, singing, playing instruments, recording, and mixing. Some advised him to go to Mumbai for some professional work, but he refused it. He went to Doordarshan Kendra Kolkata for some work, but he was refused. He went to Akashbani Bhawan Kolkata, and applied with the help of his friend and famous newsreader Tarun Chakrabarty. Ultimately he sang some of his own songs and some songs of Rabindra Nath Tagore, after 16 years, on the radio. In 1991 he went to film director Tarun Majumdar for some work in soundtrack. Tarun Majumder listened to some of his songs, and selected \\"Pratham Sabkichhu\\" to use in one of his upcoming films ‚ÄòAbhimane Anurage‚Äô, although he requested Suman to change some of his lyrics to match with the theme of that movie. The song was recorded in February 1992. Kabir Suman himself played guitar, Pratap Roy played synthesizer, and Samir Khasnabis played bass guitar. Unfortunately the film was not completed, and so the song was also not released. =First solo album= Shubhendu Maity told Mr. Somnath Chattopadhyay, one of the officials of The Gramophone Company of India about the songs of Kabir Suman, and after Shubhendu's request, Suman sent some songs to Somnath after home recording. Ravi Kichlu, the head of the product development division of that company welcomed Suman, and showed interest to record his songs. Kabir suman felt very happy and surprised after listening to this, and asked Ravi about the reason for it, Ravi Kichlu told him ‚Äì \\"I will be doing a service to Indian Music\\". The recording started after some days in early 1992. Tomake Chai Kabir Suman recorded 12 songs for his first album, named ‚ÄòTomake Chai‚Äô, which was published in April 1992. In many aspects, it was a milestone in the history of Bangla Song. It was the first Bengali Basic Song Album which was entirely written, composed, sung and musical instruments played by the artist himself. It was the first Bengali Basic Song Album which was recorded with the help of a four track tape recorder. On th√© first pressing, it did not sell well, but after the 2nd pressing, it gained a huge success, and was a big hit. With its offbeat lyric, and instrumentation, it drew a great attention of the listeners, and ultimately it got Platinum Disc. After much deliberation, Suman zeroed in on the name, Kabir Suman. According to him, \\"I wanted to keep the name my parents gave me, so I kept Suman. I took the name Kabir after Sheikh Kabir, a Bengali Muslim poet who wrote Baishnab Padabali.\\" Personal life Suman has been married five times. He is married to Sabina Yasmin, a Bangladeshi singer.Kabir Suman biodata , kabirsuman.in. Retrieved 11 December 2011. Musical life Kabir Suman, recorded a number of albums between 1992 and 1999 under the name Suman Chattopadhyay or Suman Chatterjee. He returned to the recording industry again in 2001, and this time as Kabir Suman. His contemporary urban, socially conscious songs draw upon both Bengali adhunik (modern) and Western folk and protest music. His work has been a major influence in the development of the Bengali songs. It has influenced bands like Chandrabindoo, and has grown to become a major movement in contemporary Bengali music. Most of his songs are played solo with just a Piano, electronic keyboard or a guitar. Like many other Bengali singers, Suman recorded albums of Rabindra Sangeet (Songs of Rabindranath Tagore), starting in the late-1990s. He released his first solo album, Tomake Chai, on 23 April 1992, which was immensely successful as it redefined Bengali songs. Later Suman stopped making songs for general audience and focused on more political issues.I'm lusty old man looking for carnal pleasure: Kabir Suman, The Times of India. Retrieved 17 February 2013. =Basic song albums with his own created own sung songs= In April 1992, Suman published his first album 'Tomake Chai', which had twelve songs. He sang, wrote and composed all those songs. Except three songs, all songs were accompanied by either electronic keyboard, or acoustic guitar, or both (mixed by a four track tape recorder and hardware sequencer) by him alone; those three songs were accompanied by tabla and percussion by other artists. This continued to next album 'Bosey Anko', published in March 1992 along with twelve songs again. Unlike previous album, which was mostly accompanied by electronic keyboard and multi track mixed sound electronically, 'Bosey Anko' was recorded directly without any complex mixing except one song, which was mixed with both guitar and keyboard (and also with tabla and percussion). Most songs were recorded with a simple acoustic guitar, only two songs with an electronic keyboard, and four songs were accompanied by a sarod, tabla and percussion by other artists. This second album was also a big hit, and popularized Suman so much, that he was obliged to record his third album on the same year. From his third album 'Ichchhe Holo', he started recording his basic albums annually as a 'Puja Album' like other artists during August of each year, until 1999. 'Ichchhe Holo' contained 14 songs, the first of such basic Bengali song albums. Unlike two previous albums, electronic keyboard was completely unused in this album. Most songs were completely accompanied by a simple acoustic guitar, and 4 songs were accompanied by sarod, santur, tabla and percussion by other artists. This fully acoustic music arrangement drew attention to many music- lovers, and it was such an album, which was completely electric or electronic music instrument less almost after 40 years in Bengali music history. It was also his first album which the front cover does not have a picture of himself. In 1994, Suman recorded his 4th album 'Gan-ola', which contained 15 songs. He broke his own record, and also the record of Bengali music history because it was the first of such basic Bengali song album which contains such number of songs. By this album, he returned his electronic music era again, with an updated, state-of-the art electronic keyboard with arranger facility. It was also his first album, where no other musicians played. All 15 songs were accompanied by either electronic keyboard, or acoustic guitar, among these, two songs were recorded with both guitar and harmonica. Some people believe that he was not used keyboard after 'Bosey Anko' ‚Äì because he continued to practice this new keyboard, which was finally recorded in 'Gan-ola'. It was his second album which front cover does not have any picture of himself. His electronic music supremacy developed further on his next album 'Ghumo Baundule'. Although the number of songs reduced from 15 to 13, but it was another album, which was entirely accompanied by his musical instruments. In this album, all songs were accompanied with electronic keyboard, harmonica, acoustic guitar and electric guitar combination. It was also the first time in Bengali music history. All these mixing were done by both four track tape recorder, and hardware sequencer, which was unique and very hard to do. 1996 saw a big departure of Suman's music, because, in this year, his 6th album 'Chaichhi Tomar Bondhuta' published. It contained again 15 songs like 'Gan- ola', but the main exception is that it was the first and only basic album of Suman, where a music arranger, named Amit Bandopadhyay, arranged the instrumental part. Only 3 songs were accompanied by Suman's acoustic guitar, but other songs were accompanied by session musicians, with santoor, sarod, violin, tabla, dhol, drum pad, electronic keyboard, guitar and bass guitar. Also in first time, some male and female background vocalists used in some songs. Many hardcore Suman fans were criticized and disliked this music, which was not alike with his previous albums. However, in 1997, Suman returned again to his own instrumental music by his 7th album 'Jatissor'. It contained 12 songs again after 'Bosey Anko', and also like 'Bosey Anko' ‚Äì most songs was recorded with a simple guitar, (this time with an electric guitar), only 2 songs with electronic keyboard, 1 song with keyboard, guitar and drums, another song with piano, guitar and harmonica, and 2 songs were accompanied by sarod, santoor, tabla and drums by other artists. The title song 'Jatissor' inspired then young Srijit Mukherjee, and he made a Bengali feature film with the same name in 2013. In 1998, Suman published his 8th album 'Nishiddho Istehar', which was a stark contrast with his 3rd album 'Ichchhe Holo'. Where 'Ichchhe Holo' completely omitted electronic keyboard, 'Nishiddho Istehar' was entirely accompanied by electronic keyboard. It was one of the complex electronic music recording in Bengali music industry, were all 14 songs were accompanied by complex-customized electronic sound. After 'Ghumo Baundule', it was the first album where no other musicians played. This continued to his 9th album 'Pagla Sanai', which was published in 1999. Only 2 songs were accompanied by simple acoustic guitar, and 2 were with sanai and tabla by other artists. All other songs were accompanied by electronic keyboard, and hardware drum programmer. Suman used both instruments very complexly, and created a complex orchestration alone. After this album, his next album was published again in 2001, after a long gap. =Basic song albums with his own created other's sung songs= Beside himself, some other artists have recorded his songs. It first happened in 1995, when Haimanti Shukla recorded an album 'Sobujer Pratishodh', which contained 8 songs. Amit Bandopadhyay arranged the instrumental music with many session musicians. Some female background vocalists used in some songs. It continues in next year 1996 when Suman created an album 'Chhoto Boro Miley' with 14 songs. It was his first album mainly for children. Along with Anjan Dutt, Nachiketa Chakraborty, Lopamudra Mitra & Swagatalakshmi Dasgupta, some child singers sang most songs either single or as group, or as collaborative with those famous singers. Amit Bandopadhyay was also arranger here, but in 3 songs, Kabir Suman played acoustic guitar and harmonic. In 1999, there was another children song album 'Eksathe Banchboi' with 12 songs. Unlike 'Chhoto Boro Miley', here no other famous singers sang. All songs were sung by child singers, although they were not same of those in 'Chhoto Boro Miley' (except Payel Kar, who was in both albums). Also in this album, all songs were accompanied with electronic keyboard, and hardware drum programmer by Suman. Suman used both instruments very complexly, and created a complex orchestration alone. He also sang 3 songs collaboratively with those child singers, and he says that it was his best artistic work till now. In this year, another album published named 'Achena Chhuti', which contained 14 songs, where Suman sang with Sabina Yasmin. Some songs sung by Suman, some by Sabina, and some as duet. The entire instrumentation was done by Suman. Only two songs were accompanied with guitar and harmonica, rest of the songs was by completely electronic keyboard, and sometimes with harmonica, like 'Nishiddha Istehar'. It was his first basic song album, where complete lyrics were printed in album cover. It was his last collaborative album as 'Suman Chatterjee'. Initially it was published only as cassette, but later also as CD. It was his first album which was published from a recording company other than SAREGAMA India Limited; it was published from Raga Music. =Motion picture soundtrack= In 1994, Kabir Suman debuted his Soundtrack music career. In this year, he wrote, composed, sung, and even played a cameo role in a Bengali film Mahasangram, which contained 6 songs. Amit Bandopadhyay arranged the instrumental music with many session musicians all songs but one, where Suman played his guitar and harmonica only. Here Suman sang with Indrani Sen. Some songs sung by Suman, some by Indrani, and some as duet. Background score was also done by Suman. Unfortunately the motion picture released after a long 12 years gap, in 2006, and was flop. In 1997, Suman became music director again in a Bengali film Sedin Chaitramas, which contained 7 songs. Unlike Mahasangram, Suman played all instruments like electronic keyboard, guitar and harmonica and himself was an arranger like his basic albums. It was his first soundtrack worked with own instruments. Beside Suman, other singers were Nachiketa Chakrabarty, Lopamudra Mitra & Swagata Lakshmi Das Gupta. Background score was also done by Suman. It became a hit for both the movie and soundtrack, and Kabir Suman received BFJA award as best music director. It continued to next year when he became music director again in a Bengali film Suryakanya, which contained 6 songs. Unlike two previous films, he was not directed the background score here. Suman played all instruments like electronic keyboard, guitar and harmonica and himself was an arranger like his basic albums. Beside Suman, other singers were Shrikanta Acharya, Shriradha Bandopadhyay & Swagata Lakshmi Das Gupta. This movie was a flop. =Songs created by Rabindra Nath Tagore= Kabir Suman started his music career with Rabindra Nath Tagore's song in 1972, but it was almost unsuccessful. He recorded Tagore's song again 1994, after a long gap, this time he was already a popular singer. From 1994 to 1997, he recorded Tagore's Song each year as albums. These were published as 'Tumi Sandhyar Meghamala' in 1994, 'Pathik Ami\` in 1995, 'Priyar Chhaya\` in 1996 and 'Chirabhakta\` in 1997. In first three albums, music was arranged by V Balsara, Amit Bandopadhyay and again V. Balsara respectively. In the album 'Chirabhakta', 7 songs were arranged by Amit Bandopadhyay, but rest 5 songs was sung by Suman with only a simple acoustic guitar, which was unique in the history of Tagore's song recording, and it was also permitted by Vishwa Bharati Music Board. =Songs composed by Himangshu Dutta= 1n 1995, Kabir Suman recorded an album which contained 10 songs, that were composed by Surasagar Himangshu Dutta, around 1940. All these songs were written by different lyricists. During its recording, Pete Seeger's 12 string guitar was played by renowned guitarist Buddhadeb Gangopadhyay. After 1999, he returned in recording industry again in 2001, and this time as Kabir Suman. =Concert With Pete Seeger= Kabir Suman performed with Pete Seeger at Kolkata in 1996. One of Suman's greatest critical success, was his concert in Kalamandir (in Kolkata) with American folk icon Pete Seeger, in 1996. Unfortunately, all evidences of this concert were removed and no recording was made. Such actions were taken by the then ruling CPIM government in Kolkata. This was a measure taken against Suman and was made to limit his popularity, as it was not often that Bengali musicians shared stage with a universally acclaimed icon. =Basic song albums with his own created songs from 2001= After a long gap throughout 2000, Kabir Suman returned to recording carrier again in January 2001, by publishing his 10th album 'Jabo Awchenay', which contained 10 songs. It was his first concept album about holiday, leave, vacation. Its theme contained 'leave' in many aspects like vacation, death, lost youth, holiday, break etc. After 'Nishiddho Istehar', this was his second album, which was entirely accompanied by electronic keyboard, except the last song, which was played with an acoustic piano. This was his first album, where there were some lyric reading, without any music and tune. There were such 6 lyrics. Kabir Suman had already changed his name from Suman Chattopadhyay to Kabir Suman, but the recording company still used his old name primarily, and his new name within bracket. The cover art was also a photograph of old days when he had hair, beard and moustache, where during that time, practically there were nothing to him. Next year, Kabir Suman published his 11th album 'Adab', which contained 12 songs. This was almost his back to route effort, like 'Tomake Chai' and 'Bose Anko', which also contained 6 songs on each side. 5 Songs were played with an electric guitar, and 1 song with both electronic keyboard and guitar. Rest of all songs was played with electronic keyboard. This album was remarkable with four more points‚Äî1) Here his new name were used primarily, with his old name within bracket (unlike previous album), 2) His then actual photo was used as cover photo, 3) It was his last album recorded in Saregama India Limited. 4) It was his last album which was published only as cassette. His next Bengali full solo album was published in 2005, after a long 3 years gap. In 2003, he recorded an English song album 'Reaching Out' which contained 10 songs. All songs were completely accompanied by a simple acoustic guitar. 2 songs were translation of two former Bengali songs, but the other 8 songs were directly written in English. This was Suman's first solo album which was published from a recording label other than SAREGAMA India Limited. It was published from Cosmic Harmony, which continued to publish his next few albums. It was his first album, which was marketed as his new name Kabir Suman, which is continuing after that. 2004 saw a long-awaiting incident, when Kabir Suman and Anjan Datta recorded an album collaboratively. It was named 'Onek Din Por', which contained 10 songs, 5 each were written by each artist. Suman's songs were accompanied by guitar and harmonica, where Anjan's songs were accompanied by lead guitar, bass guitar and harmonica by other musicians. Anjan himself played acoustic guitar, and Suman accompanied him by harmonica in a song. This was a milestone in Bengali Music Industry where two renowned singer- songwriters recorded an album jointly. The effort was mainly from Kabir Suman, as his 12th album. It was also his first album which was published as both cassette and CD, and his first album recorded digitally. Kabir Suman returned to his solo Bengali album in 2005 after a three-year long gap. This time he published his 13th album 'Dekhchhi Toke'. It contained only 8 songs, which was his first album with least contained song. This album was remarkable because, it was his first album where he not only recorded the entire music instrumental parts, but also mixed and finally mastered. It was first Bengali album which contained songs that were written, composed, sung, instruments played, recorded, mixed and mastered by a single person. 4 songs were accompanied by electronic keyboard, and 4 songs by electric guitar. However its recording quality was a bit unclear and hazy. His next Bengali full solo album 'Nandigram' was published in 2007, after a 2 years gap. It was his 14th album, and his 2nd concept album, and his first political album. Around this time, the political situation of West Bengal was in unrest regarding land acquisition at Singur and Nandigram. On 14 March 2007, many people were killed by police at Nandigram. At that time, Kabir Suman was a reporter of Tara TV. He went more than one time to those places, and arose high protest by both as reporter and singer-songwriter-musician. This album contained 8 songs, and one lyric. It was his second album which contained lyric reading, without any music and tune. The title song 'Nandigram\` was sung by him without any kind of instrumental, it was also his first time. Rest of all songs was accompanied by only electronic keyboard. All songs' theme was forcefully land acquisition from then state government, and brutal massacre by them. It was his third album after a long gap since 'Gan-ola\`, published in 1994, which front cover does not have any picture of himself. The royalty of this album went completely to those ordinary persons of Singur and Nandigram, who were continuing protest against forcefully land acquisition. His protest continued to the next year, when he published his 15th album and his 3rd concept album 'Rijwanur Britto\` in 2008. It was his first album which was published in Kolkata Book Fair, and the only album which was published personally, without any help from any recording company. It contained 8 songs, and except one song which was played with guitar, all other songs were played with electronic keyboard. All songs' theme was mysterious death of young multimedia designer Rizwanur Rahman, which was very controversial, and created some political unrest in West Bengal. It was his first album which was published only in CD. During this period Kabir Suman gaining popularity again in view of his many protest songs, so he obliged to publish another protest song album in the same year. His 16th album 'Protirodh', which was also a political album and his 4th concept album., which contained 8 songs. All songs were accompanied by electronic keyboard, with some songs mixed with guitar a bit. Both of these albums published in 2008 does not contained any photo of him on front cover. It is often called a sequel of 'Nandigram'. Like 'Nandigram', all songs' theme was forcefully land acquisition from then state government, and brutal massacre by them, and the royalty of this album went completely to those ordinary persons of Singur and Nandigram, Both 'Nandigram' and 'Protirodh' became very popular to the then opposition party of West Bengal All India Trinamool Congress. They played it on various meeting, distributed CD copies in very low price to voters. This album was marked by two aspects‚Äî1) It was his last album which was published as both cassette and CD, because from 2009, the cassette manufacturing was completely stopped in India. 2) It was his last album published from Cosmic Harmony. His protest-mindness helped to Trinamool Congress to stand him as an MP in then coming Lok sabha election. He sang many such songs in his election campaign. After elected as MP, he returned again to music recording in 2010. This time he published his 17th album 'Chhatradharer Gaan'. and his 5th concept album, and his 4th political album. It contained only 8 songs, and all songs were accompanied by a simple guitar. No other instruments used. It was his first Bengali album, which he recorded entirely with guitar, without any other musicians. This album was remarkable because, it was his first album after he became an MP. The main theme of this album was the forest area at western West Bengal, its people, their political situation, and some reasonless harassment from central government. During that time, Chhatradhar Mahato was arrested and imprisoned, joint paramilitary force was posted in that area, and they started harassing common people of forest area, saying that they are helping Maoists. For this sensitive reason, this album became controversial. Suman's party All India Trinamool Congress did not liked his view, and repeatedly said to ban this album, and stop saying about supporting Chhatradhar Mahato, but he has not changed his view, so the clash continued with him from other leaders, including AITC supremo, then railway minister Mamata Banerjee. This album was recorded by following an early stereo recording concept, i.e.‚Äîvocal on one side, and guitar on another side. In 2011, Suman published his 18th album 'Lalmohoner Lash'. It was his 6th and last concept album, and his 5th and last political album. It contained 9 songs, and has a stark contrast with previous album in view of instrumentation. Unlike 'Chhatradharer Gaan', which was completely accompanied by guitar, 'Lalmohaner Lash' was entirely accompanied by electronic keyboard. This album was recorded and released at that time, when due to his political view not supported by his party, the clash with his party was continuing. It is often called a sequel of 'Chhatradharer Gan'. Like 'Chhatradharer Gan', all songs were in favor of revolution of forest peoples living in western West Bengal, and protest against harassment caused by central paramilitary force, operation Green hunt etc. During that time, Lal Mohan Tudu was arrested applying UAPA, and killed by military paramilitary force. A very sharp ear can listen a humming sound in the end of some songs, it was due to 14 Kilohertz crosstalk signaling. It was caused by some earthing problem. This album also does not contain any photo of him on front cover. 2012 saw the till now last album, which is his 19th album '63te'. After some political and concept album since 2007, he returned to a standard album. It is his first standard album after 'Dekhchhi Toke', which was published in 2005. It includes 15 songs, which was after long time since 1996, when he published 'Chaichhi Tomar Bondhuta'. Instrumentation was returned again to his old style, 4 or 5 songs were played by guitar, and all other songs were played by electronic keyboard. Due to his home recording like recent albums, some outside noise were unintentionally added with final recording. The humming problem also present in some songs. =Basic song albums with his own created other's sung songs from 2002= In 2002, Indranil Sen recorded an album 'Tumi Gan Gaile', which contained 8 songs. Sanjay Das arranged the instrumental music with some session musicians. Kabir Suman said a little speech in the middle of the title song. Complete lyrics were printed in album cover.

In 2010, Sabina Yasmin recorded an album 'Suprobhat Bishonnota', which contained 10 songs. The entire instrumentation was done by Suman. Some songs were accompanied with guitar and harmonica, other songs were by electronic keyboard, and some was mixed with both electronic keyboard and guitar. It was his first and till now the only collaborative album, which was published only as CD. A very sharp ear can listen a humming sound in the end of some songs, it was due to 14 Kilohertz crosstalk signaling. In some songs, back ground noise was also born, and to depress it, over-noise-reduction happened in some tracks. =Motion picture soundtrack from 2009= In 2009, Kabir Suman returned again to Bengali film industry as a music director after a long gap. In this year, he wrote, composed, sung, and instruments played in a Bengali film Diet, which contained 3 songs.

He has organized some concerts on Bangla Khayal. Influences and legacy Suman has often been credited with creating a new genre of music in Bengal, which is deceptively simple, with lyrics that reflect common life experiences. He is sometimes referred to as the Nagorik Kobial (urban troubadour). Some people consider his songs Jibonmukhi (songs facing life), though he does not like this title and consider his work as simply adhunik bangla gaan (modern Bengali songs).‚ÄòJIBONMUKHI‚Äô? OH NO, NOT ME!, kabirsumanonline.com, 29 April 2011. Retrieved 11 December 2011 His music reflects on social mores and is often directly political. Suman draws from a very long and deep tradition of Bengali music, absorbing multiple genres including pop, light classical, film music and folk. His influences traverses a literal who's who of the Bengali music pantheon. He was also influenced by Western musicians such as Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger, Wolf Biermann etc. He transcribed (with credits) Dylan's \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" as \\"Uttoro to Jana\\" in his album Ichchhe Holo in 1993 and \\"Farewell, Angelina\\" (initially recorded by Joan Baez in 1965) as \\"Biday Porichita\\" in his 1997 album Jatismar. user account-onusondhan. Retrieved 10 December 2011 He transcribed (with credits) Paul Simon's \\"Sounds of Silence\\" as \\"Stobdhotar Gaan\\". Pete Seeger also had an influence on his music. Suman had transcribed Pete Seeger's Where Have All The Flowers Gone to his song called \\"Kothay Gelo Tara\\", which he sang on various occasions but never recorded. He had sung this in his concert with Seeger in Kalamandir 1996, right after Pete sang his original. His early albums were sparsely arranged, using primarily electronic keyboard, guitar and occasional mouth organ, all played by himself on multitrack recordings. The effect on the Bengali audience was not unlike what Bob Dylan produced on American audiences during the Beat Generation. Later albums were more elaborately arranged with full studio orchestra and often classical Hindustani accompaniment. Suman influenced a generation of singer- songwriters in Bengal after the 1990s, including Nachiketa Chakraborty, Anjan Dutt, Lopamudra Mitra, Srikanto Acharya and bands like Chandrabindoo. Political activities Suman was a journalist in Nicaragua during the Sandinista revolution and wrote Mukto Nicaragua (Liberated Nicaragua) on his experiences. During the 2002 Gujarat riots, he composed songs in protest against fundamentalism. He is also noted for his strong declamations against political opponents in public. Since 2006, when Suman was involved in the land struggle in Nandigram, he started aligning himself to All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) led by Mamata Banerjee. His songs on the Nandigram land issues have been released on two albums, Nandigram and Pratirodh. Suman participated in the Singur agitation & other TMC party programmes on a regular basis. The Trinamoool Congress nominated him for the 2009 general election from Jadavpur constituency in Kolkata, West Bengal, and won the election, defeating his nearest rival, Sujan Chakraborty of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) by 54,000 votes (by a 10% margin).Updated Election Results Details of Jadavpur, indiaelections.co.in. Retrieved 11 December 2011. In November 2009, Suman had a dispute with the Trinamool Congress. He complained that the local leaders of the party were not allowing him to work, and his views were not taken seriously in the party. However, the issue was resolved amicably in a series of closed door meetings. Suman has also been vocal in his support for the movement of tribals in Lalgarh, and has composed an album called Chhatradharer Gaan in support of the mass movement, going against the wishes of the party. Going against the party position, he has also expressed his protests against \\"Operation Green Hunt\\", the Indian Government's military operation where the Naxalites have some influence. Suman, at the end of March 2010, claimed that he is going to leave Trinamool Congress and also his membership of the Parliament. On the request of Mahasweta Devi he postponed his resignation for seven days. Within a few days, however, he made a U-turn and declared on 7 April that he does not want to resign to prevent embarrassing the party further. Currently he conveys his political opinions through his own website.

In that episode, the animated bunny Buster visits Vermont to learn about maple sugar production and meets real-life children who have lesbian parents. The children tell Buster they have a \\"mom and stepmom.\\" A child explains that one of the women is her stepmother whom she loves. No other comment is made about the family.Lisa de Moraes. \\"PBS' 'Buster' Gets An Education\\" (TV column), Washington Post, January 27, 2005.

In April 2005, on PBS's The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, she called Connecticut's resistance to the No Child Left Behind Act the \\"soft bigotry of low expectations.\\" According to the program's transcript, she said: =Controversy overseeing student loan programs= On May 10, 2007, Spellings testified before the House Education and Labor Committee responding to criticism from New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo that the Education Department had been \\"asleep at the switch\\" in overseeing student loan programs, allowing corruption and conflicts of interest to spread. Spellings has further gone on record to say that she is disregarding the suggestion by the Inspector General to hold the loan companies accountable for their graft. Altha Cravey and Robert Siegel wrote in the News & Observer that Spellings had been \\"supporting for-profit colleges who prey on students ‚Äì and then profiting off those same students when they default on their loans.\\" Spellings served on the board of directors for the Apollo Group, the parent company of the for- profit University of Phoenix, which paid her more than $300,000.Naming of Margaret Spellings as UNC system president called ‚Äòa disturbing new low‚Äô, By Valerie Strauss, Washington Post, November 14, 2015 =Commission on the Future of Higher Education= In September 2005, Spellings announced the formation of the Secretary of Education's Commission on the Future of Higher Education, which has also been referred to as the Spellings Commission. The commission was charged with recommending a national strategy for reforming post-secondary education, with a particular focus on how well colleges and universities were preparing students for the 21st-century workplace. Controversial recommendations included a call for colleges and universities to focus on training students for the workforce and supporting research with commercial applications. It had a secondary focus on how well high schools were preparing students for post-secondary education. Spellings described the work of the commission as a natural extension into higher education of the reforms carried out under No Child Left Behind, and is quoted as saying: \\"It's time we turn this elephant around and upside down and take a look at it.\\" President of the University of North Carolina Spellings at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2014 On October 23, 2015, Spellings was elected as the President of the University of North Carolina system by the Board of Governors, effective March 1, 2016. She succeeded Thomas W. Ross, who was fired by the Board of Governors in a controversial move that some believed was motivated by politics. She is the second woman to serve as President of the University of North Carolina. In her role as president, she oversaw the seventeen constituent institutions that make up the UNC system, each having its own chancellor that serves as the chief executive on the local campus. Her base salary was $775,000. Spellings' election as President of the University was controversial because of the way the secretive search process was conducted. At the Board of Governors meeting at which she was selected, several faculty attempted to read a statement before being escorted out by campus police. Over 100 faculty protestors outside the room shouted loud enough to be heard through the closed doors. According to the protestors, Spellings represented \\"everything that is troubling in the direction of public higher education in this country.\\" \\"Faculty leaders said they were ignored during the process.\\" Outgoing President Ross described the environment Spellings was entering as \\"hostile\\". On her first day, March 1, 2016, students and faculty walked out of their classes on six campuses. In Chapel Hill, demonstrators gathered on the steps of Wilson Library. Several Board of Governors members called on Board Chairman John Fennebresque to resign for what they viewed as a mishandled and secretive search process. Chairman Fennebresque resigned the next business day following Spellings' election. System-wide faculty also offered up criticism of the process, declining to prejudge the new President, but saying that she would need to work hard to overcome the distrust built by the selection process. Controversy surrounding Spellings comes on the back of controversy surrounding the unexplained firing of her predecessor, which some have accused of being politically motivated, though this has been denied by Fennebresque. On October 23, 2015, Spellings was heavily criticized for making a comment about members of the LGBT community, suggesting it was a \\"lifestyle.\\" In addition, many UNC campuses, in early 2016, were plastered with leaflets by discontented students, decrying Spellings as a \\"corporate educator\\", among other criticisms, such as her closeness to right-wing political figures. =House Bill 2= On April 7, 2016, Spellings sent instructions to all elements of the University of North Carolina system to comply with the controversial new North Carolina law, the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act (HB2), which requires transgender people to use the bathroom of their birth sex. Spellings said the next day that her instructions to comply did not imply her endorsement of the law. Students around the state protested the law.\\"Spellings: Heeding HB2 not acceptance,\\" News & Record, Greensboro, NC, April 9, 2016, p. A-4 On May 4, the U.S. Department of Justice informed Spellings that the University of North Carolina system was in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 because of her previous declaration that she would enforce HB2.\\" On May 31, the News & Observer of Raleigh reported that Spellings reversed her position and said she would not enforce HB2 to avoid a possible loss in federal funding for North Carolina. =Removal of Confederate Statue= On August 20, 2018, anti-racist protesters toppled the Silent Sam statue at University of North Carolina.

Biography  Meyer was born at Gotha, Germany, and was educated as a merchant in Frankfurt am Main. He went to London in 1816, but returned to Germany in 1820 after business adventures and stock speculations fell through. Here he invested in enterprises like textile-trade (1820‚Äì24). Soon after the first steam-hauled railway had started in December 1835, Meyer started to make business plans how to start the first railways. He also bought some concessions for iron mining. In 1845, he founded the Deutsche Eisenbahnschienen-Compagnie auf Actien (German Railway Rail joint stock company). Meyer operated very successfully as a publisher, employing a system of serial subscription to publications, which was new at that time. To this end he founded a company, Bibliographisches Institut, in Gotha in 1826. It published several editions of the Bible, works of classical literature (\\"Miniatur-Bibliothek der deutschen Classiker\\", \\"Groschen-Bibliothek\\"), atlases, the world in pictures on steel engravings (\\"Meyers Universum\\", 1833‚Äì61, 17 volumes in 12 languages with 80,000 subscribers all over Europe), and an encyclopaedia, (\\"das Grosse Conversations-Lexikon f√ºr die gebildeten St√§nde\\"; see Meyers Konversations-Lexikon, 1839‚Äì55, 52 volumes). His company grew substantially, and in 1828 he moved it from Gotha to Hildburghausen, where he died thirty years later.

Types =Hard fibroma= The hard fibroma (fibroma durum) consists of many fibres and few cells, e.g. in skin it is called dermatofibroma (fibroma simplex or nodulus cutaneous). A special form is the keloid, which derives from hyperplastic growth of scars. =Soft fibroma= The soft fibroma (fibroma molle) or fibroma with a shaft (acrochordon, skin tag, fibroma pendulans) consist of many loosely connected cells and less fibroid tissue. It mostly appears at the neck, armpits or groin. The photo shows a soft fibroma of the eyelid. =Other types of fibroma= The fibroma cavernosum or angiofibroma, consists of many often dilated vessels, it is a vasoactive tumor occurring almost exclusively in adolescent males. The cystic fibroma (fibroma cysticum) has central softening or dilated lymphatic vessels. The myxofibroma (fibroma myxomatodes) is produced by liquefaction of the underlying soft tissue. The cemento-ossifying fibroma is hard and fibrous, most frequently seen in the jaw or mouth, sometimes in connection with a fracture or another type of injury. Other fibromas: chondromyxoid fibroma, desmoplasmic fibroma, nonossifying fibroma, ossifying fibroma, nuchal fibroma, collagenous fibroma, fibroma of tendon sheath, perifollicular fibroma, pleomorphic fibroma, uterine fibroma, etc. The neurofibroma is a benign nerve-sheath tumor in the peripheral nervous system. =Ovarian fibroma= It appears in the sex cord- stromal tumour group of ovarian neoplasms. Ovary fibromas are most frequent during middle age, and rare in children. Upon gross pathological inspection, ovary fibromas are firm and white or tan. Variants with edema are especially likely to be associated with Meigs' syndrome. On microscopic examination, there are intersecting bundles of spindle cells producing collagen. There may be thecomatous areas (fibrothecoma). The presence of an ovarian fibroma can cause ovarian torsion in some cases. Treatment Benign fibromas may, but need not, be removed. Removal is usually a brief outpatient procedure or using cryotherapy in which the lesion is deep frozen (minus 89 degrees Celsius using liquid nitrogen) and thawed for two or more cycles, with full recovery within 3 to 4 weeks. The cryotherapy treatment needs no anesthetics and is painless. Another simple treatment is snip removal after injecting local anesthetic.

The tumour occurs in early adulthood (not seen in newborn), is rare, comprising less than 1% of testicular tumours. While the tumour can occur at any age, it occurs most often in young adults. Recent studies have shown that many cases of Sertoli‚ÄìLeydig cell tumor of the ovary are caused by germline mutations in the DICER1 gene. These hereditary cases tend to be younger, often have a multinodular thyroid goiter and there may be a personal or family history of other rare tumors such as pleuropulmonary blastoma, Wilms tumor and cervical rhabdomyosarcoma. Closely related terms include arrhenoblastoma and androblastoma. Both terms are classified under Sertoli‚ÄìLeydig cell tumour in MeSH. Signs and symptoms Due to excess testosterone secreted by the tumour, one-third of adult females present with a recent history of progressive masculinization. Masculinization is preceded by anovulation, oligomenorrhoea, amenorrhoea and defeminization. Additional signs include acne and hirsutism, voice deepening, clitoromegaly, temporal hair recession, and an increase in musculature. Serum testosterone level is high. Cause The exact cause of Sertoli‚ÄìLeydig cell tumour is not known. Research studies seem to indicate that certain genetic mutations (in the DICER1 gene) may play a role in many cases. Diagnosis Presence of an ovarian tumour plus hormonal disturbances suggests a Sertoli‚ÄìLeydig cell tumour. However, hormonal disturbance is present in only two-thirds of cases. A conclusive diagnosis is made via histology, as part of a pathology report made during or after surgery. See also sex cord‚Äìgonadal stromal tumour. Image:Leydig cell tumour3.jpgHigh magnification micrograph of a Leydig cell tumour. H&E; stain. Image: Sertoli cell tumour high mag.jpgHigh magnification micrograph of a Sertoli cell tumour. H&E; stain. =Classification= The tumour is subdivided into many different subtypes. The most typical is composed of tubules lined by Sertoli cells and interstitial clusters of Leydig cells. Treatment The usual treatment is surgery. The surgery usually is a fertility-sparing unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. For malignant tumours, the surgery may be radical and usually is followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, sometimes by radiation therapy. In all cases, initial treatment is followed by surveillance. Because in many cases Sertoli‚ÄìLeydig cell tumour does not produce elevated tumour markers, the focus of surveillance is on repeated physical examination and imaging. Given that many cases of Sertoli‚ÄìLeydig cell tumor of the ovary are hereditary, referral to a clinical genetics service should be considered. The prognosis is generally good as the tumour tends to grow slowly and usually is benign: 25% are malignant. For malignant tumours with undifferentiated histology, prognosis is poor.

They are estrogen secreting tumors and present as large, complex, ovarian masses. These tumours are part of the sex cord-gonadal stromal tumour or non-epithelial group of tumours. Although granulosa cells normally occur only in the ovary, granulosa cell tumours occur in both ovaries and testicles (see ovarian cancer and testicular cancer). These tumours should be considered malignant and treated in the same way as other malignant tumours of ovary. The ovarian disease has two forms, juvenile and adult, both characterized by indolent growth, and therefore has high recovery rates. The staging system for these tumours is the same as for epithelial tumours and most present as stage I.Gynaecology. 3rd Ed. 2003. Churchill Livingstone, pp. 690-691. The peak age at which they occur is 50‚Äì55 years, but they may occur at any age. Juvenile granulosa cell tumour is a similar but distinct rare tumour. It too occurs in both the ovary and testis. In the testis it is extremely rare, and has not been reported to be malignant. Although this tumour usually occurs in children (hence its name), it has been reported in adults. Presentation Estrogens are produced by functioning tumours, and the clinical presentation depends on the patient's age and sex. *Female ** If the patient is postmenopausal, she usually presents with abnormal uterine bleeding, and in some cases hemoperitoneum. ** If the patient is of reproductive age, she would present with menometrorrhagia. However, in some cases she may stop ovulating altogether. ** If the patient has not undergone puberty, early onset of puberty may be seen. ** these tumors tend to have late recurrencies ( even after 30 years ) Genetics =Adult Granulosa Cell Tumors= Ovarian tumors by incidence and risk of ovarian cancer, with adult granulosa cell tumour at right.\\\\- \\\\- Minor adjustment for mature cystic teratomas (0.17 to 2% risk of ovarian cancer): Using next generation DNA sequencing, it was discovered that 97% of adult granulosa cell tumours contain an identical mutation in the FOXL2 gene . This is a somatic mutation, meaning it is not usually transmitted to descendants. Mutation c.402C>G in the sequence of FOXL2 leads to the amino acid substitution p. C134W. It is believed that this mutation may be the cause of granulosa cell tumours. =Juvenile Granulosa Cell Tumors= Two recent studies show that the enzyme AKT1 is involved in juvenile granulosa cell tumors. In-frame duplications in the pleckstrin-homology domain of the protein were found in more than 60% of juvenile granulosa cell tumors occurring in girls under 15 years of age. The tumors without duplications carried point mutations affecting highly conserved residues. The mutated proteins carrying the duplications displayed a non-wild-type subcellular distribution, with a marked enrichment at the plasma membrane. This led to a striking degree of AKT1 activation demonstrated by a strong phosphorylation level and corroborated by reporter assays. Analysis by RNA-Seq pinpointed a series of differentially expressed genes, involved in cytokine and hormone signaling and cell division-related processes. Further analyses pointed to a possible dedifferentiation process and suggested that most of the transcriptomic dysregulations might be mediated by a limited set of transcription factors perturbed by AKT1 activation. These results incriminate somatic mutations of AKT1 as major probably driver events in the pathogenesis of juvenile granulosa cell tumors. Diagnosis =Gross appearance= Tumors vary in size, from tiny spots to large masses, with an average of 10 cm in diameter. Tumors are oval and soft in consistency. On cut-section, histology reveals reticular, trabecular areas with interstitial haemorrhage and Call-Exner bodies-small cyst like spaces interspersed within a graafian follicle. =Tumor marker= Inhibin, a hormone, has been used as tumor marker for granulosa cell tumor. Treatment In animals In the ovaries of aging squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), clusters of granulosa cells occur that resemble granulosa cell tumours in humans. These appear to be a normal change with age in this species.

Its name maybe comes from the indigenous Tupi language, where it could translate into \\"great roar\\". It could be also a Portuguese version of the term poroc-poroc, which in an indigenous' language was a way of expressing the act of destroying everything. It could be also a portmanteau of the words poroc (to take out, to tear away) and oca (house). It occurs at the mouth of the river where its waters meet the Atlantic Ocean. Explanation Map showing the M2 tidal constituent as quite high in this area, meaning greater tides During new and full moons, when the ocean tide is highest, water flows in from the Atlantic, rather than the other way around. The Amazon‚Äôs flow reverses, the distance of which depends largely on the rainwater-generated outflow of the Amazon, and a water bulge speeds upstream often with great force, forming a tidal bore with an audible noise. The tidal phenomenon is best observed on biannual equinoxes in September and March during a spring tide. On an equinoctial spring tide, the Moon and Sun fall into direct alignment with the Earth, and their gravitational pull is combined, bringing the Pororoca and others around the world to their peak.  Surfing  The wave has become popular with surfers. Since 1999, an annual championship has been held in S√£o Domingos do Capim (on the adjacent Guam√° River). However, surfing the Pororoca is especially dangerous, as the water contains a significant amount of debris from the shores of the river (often entire trees), in addition to dangerous fauna. In 2003 the Brazilian Picuruta Salazar won the event with a record ride of 12.5 km (7.8 mi) lasting 37 minutes.

Pedro Miguel became a parish in 1666. In order to protect itself from surprise attacks by pirates that roamed the Canal, a small fort Forte Baixo was constructed in the 17th century. In 1871, both a boys' and a girls' school operated from Pedro Miguel, since the community was part of a greater district that included Ribeirinha and Praia do Almoxarife. A justice of the peace operated from this district, where the electoral assembly was also situated. The population had reached 1,757 inhabitants by this time. During the 1998 earthquake, which hit affected the northern communities of the island, several houses were damaged and the parochial church was irreparably damaged.

Economy The communities economy revolved around mainly cereals and agricultural, as well as many orange orchards located closer to the center. The dairy industry was also an important contributor, and the Pedro Miguel was a major producer of local exports (most importantly butter). Culture Founded on 23 June 1977, the Grupo Folcl√≥rico e Etnogr√°fico de Pedro Miguel () was established to perpetuate some of the traditions of the community, including folklore, song, dance and ethnographic representations. Using stylized period costumes, dating to late 19th and early 20th century, the group has travelled throughout the island and archipelago to present their brand of traditional culture. The large group (in 2011 about 41 members) of varying ages (13 to 60 years) promoted their first recorded CD in 2011, entitled Ao Toque da Viola.

The roads, as well as the authority itself, are sometimes referred to as the Illinois Tollway.In reports on the authority in the press, such as those by the Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Tribune and the Daily Herald, the authority's full name is used. On some of the authority's signage, and in letters to the editor, \\"Illinois Tollway\\" is used. The authority's official website uses both. The system opened in 1958 in the Chicago area, and has subsequently expanded to include the eastern and central sections of Interstate 88 (I-88) extending into the northwestern part of the state. Beginning in 2005, the system was reconstructed to include more lanes and open road tolling, the latter of which uses I-Pass transponders to collect revenue as vehicles pass antennas at toll plazas or designated entrance or exit ramps. , ISTHA maintains and operates of tollways in 12 counties in Northern Illinois. History The original Toll Highway Authority was established in 1941. After construction of the first toll highways in Illinois was delayed by World War II, the Illinois State Toll Highway Commission was established in 1953. The first three toll highways in the Chicago area were all planned, constructed, and finally opened in 1958 under the authority of this Commission. These first three toll highways are the present day Jane Addams Memorial Tollway (I-90/I-39/US 51), the Tri-State Tollway (I-94/I-294) and the Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway (I-88, between Hillside and Sugar Grove). The first segment to open was the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway between Devon Avenue and Elgin on August 20, 1958 at 3 p.m. The Toll Highway Act, in its present form, dates from 1967, but has been amended since. Under this Act, promulgated April 1, 1968, ISTHA assumed the assets and obligations of the Illinois State Toll Highway Commission. In the 1970s, the East‚ÄìWest Tollway was extended west from Sugar Grove to Dixon with a freeway continuing to the Quad Cities. The route was later given the I-88 designation in order to obtain a higher speed limit. In 2004, ISTHA voted to rename this route the Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway. In June 1984, Republican minority leader of the Illinois House of Representatives, James \\"Pate\\" Philip, helped push through legislation authorizing the construction of the North‚ÄìSouth Tollway, then referred to as simply the DuPage Tollway. Officials at the Morton Arboretum, one of the nation's premier woodland research centers, promptly filed a federal lawsuit to block construction of the tollway. They also promised to prevent the tollway authority from obtaining environmental approval from federal officials. Ultimately, the lawsuit was settled, and I-355 was opened in 1989 as a tollway between Army Trail Road and I-55 near Bollingbrook. On November 24, 2007, a extension of I-355 opened to link I-55 to I-80. Construction of that I-355 extension began after years of delays and environmental litigation. The Illinois Tollway website officially launched on September 1, 1997. The website includes online ordering of I-Pass transponders and managing I-Pass accounts. In 2009-2010, the website underwent a $4.4 million e-commerce overhaul. In 2004, ISTHA made a strategic decision to expand and improve the tollway system instead of converting the roads to freeways. It adopted a $6.3 billion Congestion Relief Program. Under the program, the main toll plazas were rebuilt to have open road tolling, so that drivers with transponders would drive at normal speeds under toll collecting equipment instead of stopping to pay tolls. The toll plazas were relocated to the side of the road to handle vehicles without transponders. The plan also included rebuilding and widening many of the toll roads, including most of the original portion of I-88 and the northern and southern sections of I-294. I-355 was extended south of I-55 to connect to I-80 in New Lenox, a distance of , in order to serve fast-growing areas of Will County. The project also includes adding an interchange between the Tri-State Tollway and I-57. These improvements were financed by long-term revenue bonds that require the system to remain as toll roads until the bonds are repaid in 2034. The Congestion Relief Program was followed by another 15 year capital program named Move Illinois. Approved by ISTHA in 2011, the $14 billion capital program will address the remaining needs of tollway system not addressed by the Congestion Relief Program, as well as construct several new projects. The program is expected to create 120,000 jobs and add $21 billion to the economy. The projects in Move Illinois include reconstructing and widening I-90 between Rockford and the Kennedy Expressway as well as I-294 between Balmoral Ave and 95th Street; new projects include constructing the Elgin-O'Hare Western Access project as well as an interchange between I-294 and I-57 (previously, the Interstates crossed, but had no direct connection). Legislation passed in 2013 gives the authority the power to build high-speed rail lines if there is funding made available, similar to other states' High Speed Rail Aithorities. It is the only road-related authority with rail construction powers in the United States. Structure The Tollway's board of directors has eleven members. The Governor of Illinois and the head of the Illinois Department of Transportation serve as ex officio members of the Tollway Board. The remaining 9 members are named by the governor. No more than 5 appointed members may be of the same political party as the governor. The Authority has the power to collect and raise tolls, and is responsible for the maintenance and construction of tollway roads and related signage (including electronic message boards, used for driving time notices, Amber Alerts and other notifications). The Tollway also supervises and manages the seven Illinois Tollway oases. The close relationship between the governor and the near- majority of appointed board members has led to numerous allegations of endemic corruption throughout the tollway authority's lifetime. ISTHA's annual budget for fiscal year 2010 totals $696 million. ISTHA has 1,704 full-time employees, of which 754 are toll collectors. As of July 11, 2019, ISTHA has $6,248,860,000 in bond debt, maturing as late as 2044, which have been rated Aa3, AA- and AA- by Moody‚Äôs Investors Service, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's, respectively. On May 31, 2019, Moody‚Äôs Investor Service downgraded ISTHA's bond rating from Aa3 to A1, with a stable outlook. ISTHA has the power to take lands by eminent domain,Illinois Code. 605 ILCS 10/9 and ISTHA's employees are subject to conflict of interest laws enacted in 2005.Illinois Code. 605 ILCS 10/16 The Executive Director of ISTHA supervises 12 departments. The Tollway is patrolled by both police and non-police fleets. The Tollway comprises a separate Illinois State Police District 15, one of 21 districts of the Illinois State Police. ISTHA also operates a fleet of Highway Emergency Lane Patrol vehicles which assist stranded motorists with mechanical problems, flat tires or insufficient fuel. Each year, the H.E.L.P. Trucks assist more than 35,000 motorists and log nearly 1.5 million patrol miles. =Toll roads= I-55, formerly the southern terminus of I-355 , ISTHA maintains and operates of tollways in 12 counties in northern Illinois, comprising five routes: * Jane Addams Memorial Tollway (I-39/I-90/US 51) * Veterans Memorial Tollway (I-355) * Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway/Chicago‚ÄìKansas City Expressway (I-88/IL 56/IL 110) * Tri-State Tollway (I-80/I-94/I-294) * Elgin-O'Hare Tollway (IL 390) Except for the vicinity of O'Hare International Airport, none enter the city of Chicago. The Chicago Skyway, which is owned by the City of Chicago but on a 99-year lease to the Skyway Concession Company, is the only toll road in Illinois that is not operated by ISTHA. ISTHA also operates tolling for the Longmeadow Parkway toll bridge that is maintained by Kane County, Illinois. =Toll collection= ISTHA sets its tolls at a level necessary to maintain and operate the system while retiring its bond debt, and it is required to conduct public hearings on any proposed toll increase.Illinois Code. 605 ILCS 10/11(c) In 1958, the tolls were set at 25 cents at the main plazas and 10 cents at the exit ramps. In 1983, the tolls increased to 40 cents at the main plazas and 15 cents at most ramps. With the advent of the I-Pass system in 2005, the tolls for cash payments were doubled, while rates for cars equipped with I-Pass transponders remained the same. On January 1, 2012, tolls increased by 87 percent, to 75 cents at the main plazas for transponder-equipped cars, and $1.50 for those paying cash. In addition, congestion pricing is used to charge trucks a rate which is $0.50 or $1.00 higher during rush hour than during off-peak hours. Users pay tolls at designated plaza either by driving under a transponder antenna or by driving through a toll gate and paying cash. The cash price is twice the transponder price. Lesser tolls are also collected on entrance and exit ramps that are near the main toll plazas so that the average toll is about for passenger vehicles with I-Pass. Trucks and commercial vehicles pay a higher toll, with a discount for travel during non-peak hours. The current rate structure is projected to generate $850 million in annual revenue by 2012. Until the mid-1970s, the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway (then the Northwest Tollway) used a ticket system on the segment between Elgin and Beloit to collect tolls based upon the exact mileage traveled. Drivers were handed a Hollerith card when they entered the segment and paid a toll when they left. I-Pass is the Illinois Tollway‚Äôs electronic transponder toll collection system that allows drivers to pre-pay their tolls. , Tollway drivers use 3.3 million I-Pass transponders. Every toll lane on the system is equipped to accept I-Pass which can also be used on the Chicago Skyway and anywhere E-ZPass is accepted. (E-ZPass is a transponder consortium of toll road authorities on the East Coast.) A refundable deposit of $10 and $20 in pre-paid tolls is charged at the time of purchase. Illinois Tollway offers an auto-pay replenishment option by registering a credit or debit card to an I-Pass account at the time of activation. Each month, the minimum balance and replenishment amounts are recalculated based on the average usage during the previous six months. A special program for low-income motorists allows them to obtain I-Pass units with a reduced outlay of $20. Users choosing to replenish their account without auto-pay are responsible for monitoring their transactions and balance and must pay a $20 refundable deposit. There are various options for self-pay replenishment, including the Tollway Service Centers located at five oasis rest stops. Customers wishing to pay by check or cash can pay at the oasis customer service centers or can buy $20 I-Pass Gift Cards at Jewel-Osco. The Illinois Tollway has implemented open road tolling, allowing any vehicle with an I-Pass or E-ZPass transponder to continue through the toll plaza at highway speeds while those paying cash have to stop at a tollbooth. If a vehicle registered with I-Pass passes through a toll collection without the transponder, the toll amount will be automatically deducted from the respective I-Pass account. This process is called \\"V-Tolls\\" (Video Tolls). Criticism ISTHA and the toll highway system in Illinois have undergone much criticism since the 1980s. Construction of the North‚ÄìSouth Tollway (I-355) was delayed, in part, due to a dispute with the Morton Arboretum in Lisle, Illinois. Original plans for this toll highway would have seen it constructed through the middle of land belonging to the Arboretum, and closer to the existing Illinois Route 53. Construction on other projects has also been delayed, mostly through protests by area residents. Much of the criticism in the 1980s and 1990s was centered on the continued existence of ISTHA itself, and its quasi-independent status from even the Illinois General Assembly. The original decision to build the tollway was made in an era when five states used toll roads to create a superhighway between New York and Chicago. This predated the Interstate Highway System and the associated funding from federal gasoline taxes. Critics argue that Tollway users are paying twice, first by paying tolls and then by paying the same gasoline taxes that other motorists pay. Citizens' groups formed in the 1990s to try to force ISTHA to disband, and convert the toll highways in Illinois into freeways. This stems from the 1953 law that established the then Illinois State Toll Highway Commission. By 1999, Governor George Ryan began to publicly discuss the closure of ISTHA and the abolition of toll collection in Illinois, but the plans were eclipsed by Ryan's increasing scandals. After Ryan declined to run for re-election and his successor, Governor Rod Blagojevich, had been elected (but had not yet taken office), the ISTHA board publicly suggested a sudden hike in toll rates that the new Governor could simply blame on his outgoing predecessor. The previous adjustment to Illinois toll rates had taken place in 1983. ISTHA would have been able to raise rates without approval of the Illinois General Assembly because of its quasi-independent nature. However, a rate hike did not go into effect at that time. Ultimately, the toll rates for I-Pass users remained at 1983 prices while the toll rate for cash payers doubled. Practically, the I-Pass system and open road tolling appears to have removed the annoying aspect of toll collection which motivated many toll opponents, and subsequently the calls to ending the tolls have quieted. The Sierra Club criticized the capital projects as adding to urban sprawl while hurting air quality. In response, the expense of implementing Open Road Tolling has justified by claiming it significantly decreases the amount of pollution from vehicle exhaust that enters the air. This is because the old barrier style tollbooths adds to the amount of time that certain vehicles spend on the roadway by requiring them to slow down, stop, and sometimes idle for several minutes while waiting to pay their tolls. The introduction of the I-Pass system has greatly alleviated this problem since all vehicles with an I-Pass or E-Zpass can continue to travel at normal highway speeds through the toll plazas. In 2003, during Governor George Ryan's administration, ISTHA entered into a public-private partnership with Wilton Partners to renovate the oasis rest stops in exchange for a 25-year lease. That lease has been the subject of various investigations, including the political connections between food vendors in the oases with former Governor Blagojevich. Ultimately, Wilton Partners' lender foreclosed on the Oases. ISTHA experienced high leadership turnover amid controversy. On November 19, 2008, Jeffrey Dailey began serving as Executive Director of ISTHA. On December 9, 2008, Governor Blagojevich was arrested on corruption charges including allegations that he solicited campaign donations from Tollway construction contractors. On December 18, Dalley resigned claiming that Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan would not grant waivers from the state ethics law that prohibited high level ISTHA executives from being employed by contractors within a year of leaving office. In January 2009, Governor Blagojevich was impeached, tried, and removed from office for abuse of power, and was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor Pat Quinn. Following this, ISTHA Board appointed a new chief executive without consulting Quinn. On August 12, 2009, John Mitola, who was appointed the ISTHA board chairman in 2003 by Governor Blagojevich, resigned for personal reasons. The next day, Governor Quinn appointed a new chairman and two new board members. Ex-ISTHA Chairman Mitola was reported to have failed to disclose an investment in a real estate development with former state purchasing and contracting CEO Michael Rumman under ousted Governor Blagojevich. In addition, a number of top ISTHA staff members have left in 2009.

The population in 2011 was 1,899,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 14.46 km¬≤.Eurostat It occupies the southern foothills of the Cabe√ßo Gordo, along the coast. The name Feteira is derived from the Portuguese word for \\"fern\\", and indicates a \\"location of [many] ferns\\"; the name likely refers to the original colonists discovery of this area covered with ferns. History The early inhabitants colonized the area around Ribeira da Granja, along the coast near Lajinha and Ponta Furada. They built their first community along the coast, although on higher ground. The Church of Feteira, consecrated in honor of the Holy Spirit, is one of the older churches on the island. Lost to history, its date of construction is currently unknown, although the first references to the sanctuary refer to 1562. In that Year, the local residents were forced to pay higher taxes to the parish. On June 30, 1568, King D. Sebasti√£o passed a provision in favor of People of Feteira who sought the Crown's intervention. Relating to its church, the historian Gaspar Frutuoso mentioned that it had three naves, supported by five columns, with arterial chapels on either side. It was a temple of good proportions (35 m in width) with a single bell-tower. The parish also had a nearby 15th century chapel dedicated to Saint Peter. In 1597, it was sacked and burned by English pirates. The chapel was a place of pilgrimage and popular religious festivities. Due to lack of attention and care, over time it was abandoned. Because of a history of piracy, there were small forts along the rugged coastline for the protection of the residents. They were part of an overall system of defenses around the island of Fayal, which suffered most of the time from lack of sufficient manpower and artillery. These fortified outposts decayed with time and the erosive action of the sea and tempests. Today, the ruins of these defensive positions have disappeared. Following economic and social hardship in 1862, and weakness of political leaders to satisfy their demands, an uprising occurred in 1862 in several of the island's towns over the imposition of new taxes. The people of Feteirs adhered to the protests. Geography Feteira's village center, known sometimes as Feteira de Baixo, along the eastern border with Ang√∫stias Pico in the east It is located west of the center of the city of Horta, connected by the southern extension of the regional E.R.1-1¬™ roadway and a northern municipal road in the interior. Farmlands dominate the coastal plain between the neighbouring parishes of Ang√∫stias and Castelo Branco, while the coast is a rocky area formed by rugged lava stones and cliffs undercut by the Atlantic Ocean. The highest point in the parish is the peak of Cangueiro, approximately above sea level, below the crater rim of Cabe√ßo Gordo. The coastal cliffs, which mark the southern border of the town, are at most above sea level. Lava flows formed intricate geomorphological structures, highlighted by the area of Lajinha (on the eastern border). Wave motion and currents have carved this region forming coastal arches, and undercutting the E.R. 1-1¬™ at points near the Rua da Al√©m. Intermittent creeks and small seasonal streams bisect the parish., supporting the growth of various settlements and neighbourhoods, involved inagriculture, including (from west to east): Ribeira do Granjo, Ribeira do S√£o Pedro and Ribeira de Fonte do Rego. Five bridges cross these water courses at S√£o Pedro, Porceir√£o, Igreja, a second one in S√£o Pedro (at the lower part of the parish) and Ponte Nova. Bisected by these natural barriers, the parish developed in various nuclei associated with the roads and pathways that interconnected the pasturelands and woodlots along the flanks of the Cabe√ßo Gordo volcano. Consequently, small neighbourhoods or communities developed along: the regional roadway (that included Feteira de Baixo, Caminho do Meio and Alto da Lajinha), another route that connected Feteira to Flamengos (that included Cruz da Portela, Caminho das Ter√ßas and Lameiro Grande), a second lateral road that included Farrobim do Sul and intersected the interior towards Flamengos (that included Cimo de S√£o Pedro, Atalaia, Grotas, Fonte do Rego and Cimo do Granjo), and a roadway that bisected these arterials starting in Ang√∫stias (from Courelas, across Cruz da Portela, to Portela and Grotas, to Fonte do Rego). Economy Agriculture is the primary source of income. Historically, the parish has cultivated potatoes, supported orange and lemon orchards, as well as large quantities of wheat and corn. Documents for 1886 indicate a cultivation of of potatoes. Most of these crops were cultivated for export, although small itinerant banana fields were cultivated for local consumption. These continue to important crops, but currently, the cattle and dairy industry is generally accepted as the primary source of agro-business (although some lambs are raised). The fishery and paper industries have also supported the local economy. Yet, economic difficulties, in particular regional politics, have seen a decrease in people participating in these activities, since 1862.

Some, like the Imp√©rio das Grotas in Feteira, date back to the 19th century (1898 specifically), have been susceptible to a change in the islands demographics, economics and agnosticism, and slowly abandoned due to local disinterest. Culture In addition to the feast days associated with the Holy Spirit, there are other religious and secular events that mark the annual calendar, including the feast day of Our Lady of Lourdes (), which is held on the last weekend of August.

Idaho is divided into 35 legislative districts, which each elect one senator and two representatives. There are no term limits for either chamber. The crossing of upper and lower house districts into a single constituency is found in only seven U.S. state legislatures: Idaho, Arizona, Maryland, New Jersey, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Washington. Based on 2010 census data, each legislative district in the state of Idaho had approximately 44,788 residents.  History  The first Idaho legislature convened in December 1890.  Elections and composition  Members of the Idaho Legislature were originally elected by county, but in recent times districts apportioned by population have replaced representation by county. Today members of the Idaho Legislature are elected from 35 districts throughout the state. Some districts include several counties, while others are located entirely within a single county. Ada County, the state's largest by population, currently has nine legislative districts within its boundaries (as of the 2010 redistricting, Ada County has Legislative Districts 14, 15, 16 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22.) All 105 members are elected simultaneously every two years on the same day as the federal election day in early November.  Districts  Each district is represented by one senator and two representatives. Idaho has fourteen committees in the House of Representatives and ten committees in the Senate. Currently, there are thirty-five members in the Senate with twenty-six men and nine women. The House of Representatives also currently holds seventy members with forty-six men and twenty-four women. Districts are reapportioned every 10 years. The next reapportionment is expected to occur after the 2020 census and take effect as of the 2022 election. In the 1980s voters elected legislators from two districts, a smaller local district and a larger \\"floterial\\" district which often encompassed an entire region of the state. Legislative seats in floterial districts were last contested in 1990. Today floterial districts are prohibited by the Idaho Constitution.  Responsibilities  The Idaho Legislature is responsible for managing and carrying out constituent needs through public satisfaction and domain. The Idaho Legislation is mainly concerned for carrying out the public's interests and turning it into policies. The committee structure is 24 people total, divided by 10 in the Senate and 14 in the House of Representatives. The responsibilities are ideally divided throughout the day. Normally, the sessions begin in the morning and last until the job is done. In the afternoon and early in the morning meetings are scheduled so it doesn‚Äôt interfere with daily sessions.  2017 Idaho Legislature  Currently both houses of the Idaho Legislature are controlled by the Republican Party with large majorities. In the 2017 64th Legislature the Senate is composed of 6 Democrats and 29 Republicans. The House is composed of 11 Democrats and 59 Republicans. In terms of single party strength the Idaho Senate is tied with South Dakota for the third most Republican controlled senate in the nation behind Wyoming (27‚Äì3) and Utah (24‚Äì5). The Idaho House is tied with Utah as the second most Republican controlled lower house in the nation only trailing Wyoming (52‚Äì8).  Current Sessions  The 2020 legislative session will begin January 9th. The 2019 legislative session started January 7th and was later adjourned after 95 days of being in session. Which is 15 more than the previous year in 2018. During the 2019 legislative session there were 353 bills enacted into laws, 522 bills introduced, and 761 legislations drafted.

It was raised in the 1920s to serve as part of Spain's Army of Africa. The unit, which was established in January 1920 as the Spanish equivalent of the French Foreign Legion, was initially known as the Tercio de Extranjeros (\\"Tercio of foreigners\\"), the name under which it began fighting in the Rif War of 1920‚Äì1926. Although foreign recruitment spans the Spanish-speaking nations, the majority of recruits are Spaniards. Over the years, the force's name has changed from Tercio de Extranjeros to Tercio de Marruecos (when the field of operations targeted Morocco), and by the end of the Rif War it became the \\"Spanish Legion\\", with several \\"tercios\\" as sub-units. The Legion played a major role in the Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War. In post-Franco Spain, the modern Legion has undertaken tours of duty in the Yugoslav Wars, Afghanistan, Iraq and Operation Libre Hidalgo UNIFIL. History The Spanish Legion was formed by royal decree of King Alfonso XIII on 28 January 1920, with the Minister of War Jos√© Villalba Riquelme es stating, \\"With the designation of Foreigners Regiment there will be created an armed military unit, whose recruits, uniform and regulations by which they should be governed will be set by the minister of war.\\" In the 1920s the Spanish Legion's five battalions were filled primarily by native Spaniards (since foreigners were not easy to recruit) with most of its foreign members coming from the Republic of Cuba. =Predecessor= Historically there had been a \\"Spanish Foreign Legion\\" which preceded the modern Legion's formation in 1920. On 28 June 1835, the French government had decided to hand over to the Spanish government the French Foreign Legion in support of Queen Isabella's claim to the Spanish throne during the First Carlist War. The French Foreign Legion, with around 4,000 men, landed at Tarragona on 17 August 1835. This became the first Spanish Legion until it was dissolved on 8 December 1838, when it had dropped to only 500 men. The British Legion (La Legi√≥n Brit√°nica) of the Spanish Legion also fought during the First Carlist War. This Legion fought for the fortified bridge of Arrigorriaga on 11 September 1835. =The Title of Spanish Legion= The Spanish Legion was modelled on the French Foreign Legion. Its purpose was to provide a corps of professional troops to fight in Spain's colonial campaigns in North Africa, in place of conscript units that were proving ineffective. The first commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Jos√© Mill√°n- Astray Terreros, referred to his unit as ‚ÄòLa Legi√≥n‚Äô from the start but this only became part of the unit's title from 1937. In the original Tercio de Extranjeros there were, amongst others, one Chinese, three Japanese, one Maltese, one Russian, and one black American. However, soon the majority of its members were Spaniards who joined to fight outside of European Spain. Tercio (lit. 'a third') is an old Spanish military term that roughly translates as ‚Äòregiment' (originally it had enough manpower to be considered a half-brigade). In the 18th century tercios were replaced by regiments. There is no equivalent word in English. Dating from the 16th century, the name was chosen to evoke the era of Spain's military supremacy as the leading Catholic power in Europe under the Habsburg Emperors. Organised into tercios in 1534, the Spanish infantry gained a reputation for invincibility. In 1925, the unit title was changed to Tercio de Marruecos (‚ÄòTercio of Morocco‚Äô). This was soon abbreviated to ‚ÄòThe Tercio‚Äô. In 1937 at the height of the Spanish Civil War, the Tercio de Marruecos was renamed La Legi√≥n, the name by which it is still known today. =Early campaigns= The Spanish Legion's first major campaign was in Spanish North Africa. In 1920 Spain was facing a major rebellion in the Protectorate of Spanish Morocco, led by the able Rif leader Abd el-Krim. On 2 September 1920, King Alfonso XIII conferred command of the new regiment on Lieutenant Colonel of Infantry Jos√© Mill√°n-Astray, chief proponent of its establishment. Mill√°n-Astray was an able soldier but an eccentric and extreme personality. His style and attitude would become part of the mystique of the legion. On 20 September 1920 the first recruit joined the new legion, a date which is now celebrated annually. The initial make-up of the regiment was that of a headquarters unit and three battalions (known as Banderas, lit. \\"banners\\"- another archaic 16th century term). Each battalion was in turn made up of a headquarters company, two rifle companies and a machine gun company. The regiment's initial location was at the Cuartel del Rey en Ceuta on the Plaza de Col√≥n. At its height, during the Spanish Civil War, the legion consisted of 18 banderas, plus a tank bandera, an assault engineer bandera and a Special Operations Group. Banderas 12 to 18 were considered independent units and never served as part of the additional tercios into which the legion was organised. Francisco Franco was one of the leaders of the legion and the unit's second-in-command, concurrently commanding the 1st Legion Bandera. The legion fought in Morocco in the War of the Rif (to 1926). Together with the Regulares (Moorish colonial troops), the legion made up the Spanish Army of Africa. In October 1934 units of both the legion and the Regulares were brought to Spain by the Republican Government to help put down a workers revolt in the area of Asturias.Paul Preston, pp. 103-105 \\"Franco\\", Colors of the Spanish Legion. Under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Juan Yag√ºe the Army of Africa played an important part in the Spanish Civil War on the Nationalist side. The professionalism of both the legion and the Regulares gave Franco's rebel troops a significant initial advantage over the less well trained Spanish Republican forces. The Army of Africa remained an elite spearhead until the expansion of the rebel armies after April 1937 led to the legion and Moroccan units being distributed across several fronts. Following the Francoist victory in 1939, the legion was reduced in size and returned to its bases in Spanish Morocco. It was only after then that the legion attained its present composition of 4 Tercios, and the names given to them, the 4th Tercio of the legion was established later in 1950: 65px 65px 1st Tercio \\"Great Captain Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordoba\\" 65px 65px 2nd Tercio \\"Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba\\" 65px 80px 3rd Tercio \\"Don Juan de Austria\\" 65px 65px 4th Tercio \\"Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma\\" When Morocco gained its independence in 1956 the legion continued in existence as part of the garrison of the remaining Spanish enclaves and territories in North Africa. The legion fought Arab irregulars in the Ifni War in 1957‚Äì58. On 17 June 1970, Legion units opened fire and killed between two and eleven demonstrators at the Zemla neighbourhood in El Aaiun, Spanish Sahara, modern day Western Sahara. The incident, which came known as the Zemla Intifada, had a significant influence on pushing the Sahrawi anticolonial movement into embarking on an armed struggle which continues, though Spain has long since abandoned the territory and handed it over to Morocco. Through the course of the legion's history Spaniards (including natives of the colony of Spanish Guinea) have made up the majority of its members, with foreigners accounting for 25 percent or less. During the Rif War of the 1920s most of the Foreigners serving with the legion were Spanish speaking Latin Americans. Modern legion In the 2000s, after the abandonment of conscription, the Spanish Legion once again accepted foreigners into service. Male and female native Spanish speakers, mostly from Central American and South American states, were included. Today, acceptance to the Spanish Legion is based on the following criteria: *Be a Spanish citizen; although citizens from former Spanish territories also can join (foreign recruits are required to have a valid Spanish residence permit). *Be a citizen in good legal standing *Not be deprived of civil rights *Be at least 18 years of age and not be 29 on the day of joining boot camp. *Be able to pass psychological, physical and medical evaluations The Spanish Legion on the Bastille Day Military Parade in Paris (2007) In recent years, the Spanish Legion was involved in Bosnia as part of the SFOR. It also took part in the Iraq War, deploying in Najaf alongside Salvadoran troops, until the new Spanish government of Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero fulfilled its electoral promises by withdrawing Spanish troops from Iraq. The legion units deployed in Iraq were involved in several operations against the insurgency. In 2005, the legion was deployed in Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led International Stabilisation Force (ISAF). In 2006, the 10th Bandera was sent to Southern Lebanon as part of United Nations' Operation UNIFIL.La Legi√≥n asume el mando en L√≠bano tras culminar Infanter√≠a de Marina su misi√≥n, 31 October 2006, 20 Minutos. =Present role and deployment= The Spanish Legion is now mostly used in NATO peacekeeping missions. It has 5,000 soldiers in a Brigade of two Tercios (regiments) based in Ronda, M√°laga and Viator, Almer√≠a (Andalusia). Two other independent tercios are deployed in the Spanish African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla as part of their respective garrisons. The legion is directly controlled by the Spanish General Staff. Although the detachment at M√°laga was transferred away, each year a company of legionaries from one of the Tercios (regiments) returns to march in the Holy Week procession with the Christ of the Good Death, a life-size effigy of Christ Crucified, adopted by the legion as Patron in the 1920s. It also has its own confraternity with its home chapel located in this historic city, where veterans who served in this unit are counted among its membership. The Legion's detachments also take part in various Holy Week events nationwide, including its military band. Legionnaires in Iraq. Units constituting modern Spanish Legion The currently active units of the Spanish Legion are: * II Spanish Legion Brigade \\"Rey Alfonso XIII\\" in Viator ** 2nd Spanish Legion Headquarters Bandera ** 2nd Spanish Legion Light Armored Cavalry Group \\"Reyes Cat√≥licos\\" ** 3rd Spanish Legion Tercio \\"Don Juan de Austria\\" *** VII Spanish Legion Bandera \\"Valenzuela\\" *** VIII Spanish Legion Bandera \\"Col√≥n\\" ** 4th Spanish Legion Tercio \\"Alejandro Farnesio\\" *** X Spanish Legion Bandera \\"Mill√°n Astray\\" ** 2nd Spanish Legion Field Artillery Group ** 2nd Spanish Legion Engineer Battalion ** 2nd Spanish Legion Logistic Group In other commands: * 1st Spanish Legion Tercio \\"Gran Capit√°n\\" ** I Spanish Legion Bandera \\"Comandante Franco\\" * 2nd Spanish Legion Tercio \\"Duque de Alba\\" ** IV Spanish Legion Bandera \\"Cristo de Lepanto\\" =Special Forces of the Spanish Legion= The legion has a special operations unit known as the Bandera de operaciones especiales de la legi√≥n (Legion Special Operations Battalion or BOEL). The members of this unit, who were (and still mostly are) volunteers from other banderas of the legion, received training in: SCUBA/Maritime Warfare, Arctic and Mountain Warfare, Sabotage and Demolitions, Parachute and HALO techniques, Long Range Reconnaissance, Counter-terrorism and CQB, Vehicle insertion, Sniping and SERE (Survival, Escape, Resistance and Evasion). Much of the training was undertaken at Fort Bragg (USA). In 2002 the BOEL was renamed 19th Special Operations Group \\"Maderal Oleaga\\" (GOE-XIX) and was moved to Alicante, and reported directly to Army HQ as part of the Special Operations Command, with recruitment now being in a national basis, with personnel assigned from various Army units. In 2019-20, the battalion returned to the Legion Command. * 19th Special Operations Group \\"Maderal Oleaga\\" Ranks The military ranks and promotion conditions of the Spanish Legion are the same as those applicable to the remainder of the Spanish Army. Formerly the Legion had its own rank system for non-commissioned officers. The only modern difference is that soldiers (OR-1) in the Legion are referred to as \\"Caballeros Legionarios\\" (Legionnaire knights). Legionnaires consider this title as a distinction, earned through rigorous training and initiation tests. Basic training Basic training lasts four months and takes place in C√°ceres or C√°diz. It includes basic military skills, forced marches and a stringent assault course. After the second month, the recruit signs a 2 or 3-year contract. After finishing basic training the recruit joins one of the tercios, in there he receives further training, mostly focused on parading and legionary tradition. This is the same process as in the rest of units in the Spanish army. Uniforms and equipment of the legion =Uniforms= From its establishment the legion was noted for its plain and simple style of dress, in contrast to the colourful dress uniforms worn by the Peninsular regiments of the Spanish Army until the overthrow of the Monarchy in 1931. This was part of the cult of austerity favoured by a unit that considered itself on more or less continual active service. The modern legion has the same camouflage dress for active service and ordinary duties as the rest of the Spanish Army but retains the unique, sage green Tropical uniform for semi-formal barrack dress and as the basis of Legion parade uniform. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of the modern legion uniform is the khaki \\"gorrillo\\" cap or \\"chapiri\\", with red hanging tassel and piping. Contrary to usual military practice, Legionaries are allowed to sport beards and are permitted to wear their uniforms, both traditional and service, open at the chest. =Equipment= G36-E assault rifle. The basic weapons used by the Legion are the same as those used by the rest of the Spanish Army. These include the G36-E rifle, its 40mm grenade launcher modular attachment the AG36, the HK MG4 and MG3 machine guns, and the HK USP 9mm pistol. Like the rest of the Army, the Legion makes use of crew served weapons such as the M2 Browning machine gun and the SB LAG 40 automatic grenade launcher on their armoured vehicles. The Legions field artillery group mans L118 105mm Light Guns, Italian wheeled tank destroyers B1 Centauro also are used. The Legion uses Land Rovers, Spanish-made BMR and VEC-M1, VAMTAC, URO trucks and other vehicles like foreign LMV or RG31. Esprit de corps Mill√°n-Astray provided the Legion with a distinctive spirit and symbolism intended to evoke Spain's Imperial and Christian traditions. For instance, the Legion adopted the regimental designation of tercio in memory of the 16th-century Spanish infantry formations that had toppled nations and terrorized the battlefields of Europe in the days of Charles V. Mill√°n-Astray also revived the Spaniards' ancient feud with the Moors and portrayed his men first as crusaders on an extended Reconquista against Islamic civilization, and later as the saviours of Spain warding off the twin evils of Communism and democratic liberalism defeating the dangerous spectre of 'Eastern Atheism'. As a tribute to the old Tercios the Legion coat of arms features, besides the crown, weapons used by the soldiers of these units - the musket, halberd and crossbow. =Traditions= The Legion's customs and traditions include the following: Legionaries on parade. Legionnaires with effigy of Christ of the Good Death, M√°laga. * Its members, regardless of rank, are titled Caballero Legionario (\\"Legionary Gentleman\\"). When women are admitted, they are titled Dama Legionaria (\\"Legionary Lady\\"). * A \\"M√≠stica Legionaria\\" (Legionary Spirit) (condensed in a twelve-point \\":es:Credo Legionario\\" -Legionary creed-) * Legionaries consider themselves novios de la muerte (\\"bridegrooms of death\\"). The nickname is also the title of one of the two official hymns of the Spanish Legion, the other one being La Cancion del Legionario (\\"The Legionary's Song\\"). The nickname hails from the first years of the corps, when it only admitted men during those times. * When in trouble, a legionary shouts ¬°A m√≠ la Legi√≥n! (\\"To me the Legion!\\"). Those within earshot are bound to help him regardless of the circumstances. In practice, Legionaries are never supposed to abandon a comrade on the battlefield. * The legion's march step is faster than the Spanish military standard, being 160-180 steps per minute in contrast to the standard 90 steps per minute. *During the Holy Week processions in M√°laga, the Legionaries carry on their shoulders the Christ of Good Death on Holy Thursday morning. Later that same afternoon they accompany the procession through the streets of M√°laga. * Under the command of Jos√© Mill√°n-Astray, the legion's motto was ¬°Viva la muerte! (\\"Long live death!\\") It fell into disuse after the death of Francisco Franco. Mascot of the Spanish Legion (goat) * The Legion had several mascots during its history, such as monkeys, chickens, capercaillies, wild boars, barbary sheep (Spanish, arruis), bears or parrots. The modern Legion however has a goat as mascot of the unit. It usually appears at parades, wearing a Legion cap and accompanied by a Legionary, alongside the legion's marker guard (gastadores) at parades and ceremonies, leading the marching troops. * While throughout its history the legion has been an essentially infantry force it has also included armoured, artillery and engineer units. During the 1920s and early 1930s a squadron of mounted lanceros (lancers) formed part of the legion and in 1982 a mounted section of the Policia Militar de la Legion was formed to carry the traditional lances and pennants during the Holy Week Procession in M√°laga to continue the practice. * The Military bands and Bugle bands of the legion continue the musical traditions it has since the 1920s. The bugle bands of the Legion, together with the Regulares, are the only such bands in the Spanish Armed Forces to never use the valved bugle but use the plain bugle instead, and together with the Parachute Light Infantry Brigade are the only ones to use the small cornetin or the piccolo bugle, used in ordering commands and leading the bugle band in playing bugle calls, fanfares or marches. The medium cornetin is used by other Spanish Armed Forces branches. * Formerly the Legion did its marchpasts in the same way as the rest of the Spanish Armed Forces, today, all officers and the colour guards only do a hand salute and eyes right when marching past. When on the halt and giving full salutes, they only do a hand salute. Anthems and marches of the legion = Slow march = El Novio de la Muerte (Bridegroom of Death) is the unofficial hymn and regimental slow march of the Spanish Legion, composed in 1921 with words by Juan Costa set to music by Fidel Prado. =Regimental quick marches and official anthem = Composed in 1920, La Cancion del Legionario (The Legionnare's Song) is the official quick march and anthem of the Legion. It was composed by Modesto Romero and Infantry Commandant Emilio Guill√©n Pedemonti. It is played by the military bands and bugle bands of the Legion at the regulation 190 beats that it exclusively uses.http://www.lalegion.es/himnos.htm Before it became the legion's official march, Le Madelon and Tercios Heroicos (Heroic Tercios) by Francisco Calles and Antonio Soler were its official march past tunes. Some notable Legionaries The following is a list of Legionaries who have gained fame or notoriety inside or outside of the legion. * Francisco Franco - General and dictator of Spain from 1939 to 1975. Founding deputy commander of the Spanish Legion in 1920, and later commander of the legion from 1923 to 1926. * Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma (Spanish: Don Sixto Enrique de Borb√≥n-Parma y Borb√≥n-Busset), as Enrique Aranjuez in 1965. Carlist pretender to the Spanish throne. * Jos√© Mill√°n-Astray, founder and first commander of the Spanish Legion, served until 1923. * Enrique San Francisco, actor. * Jos√© Manuel Lara Hern√°ndez * Pedro Marangoni, writer and pilot * Peter Kemp British Special Operations Executive agent, MI6 agent and writer. * Pino Rauti, Italian politician * Nacho Vidal. After leaving around 1994, he became a pornographic actor and director.

It contains the localities Matriz and Dutras. History It was the second Captain-major of Faial, Joss d'Utra, son of the Flemish pioneer Josse van Huerter, that originally settled and developed the area of Matriz. The religious parish, Matriz do Santissimo Salvador, was created from successive growth of the village of Horta in 1498, by the royal decree of King Manuel I of Portugal. The primitive Church Matriz de S√£o Salvador was completed and inaugurated on June 28, 1514; it complements the Flemish church of the same name in Bruges and the S√© of Angra do Hero√≠smo. It was successively sacked in 1589, then 1597, by English privateers. In 1643, Diogo das Chagas identified that the area of the Matriz had about 1,985 inhabitants in 449 homes. It was also a centre of the faith community during the period of exploration; the home to several churches and religious sanctuaries, that include: the Jesuit Church and Convent, the Church of Miseric√≥rdia (Mercy), the Convent of S√£o Jo√£o, the Convent of Nossa Senhora da Gl√≥ria, the Convento de Santo Ant√≥nio, the Imp√©rio dos Nobres (in homage to the 1672 volcanic eruption) and the old Clock Tower (former tower of another destroyed church). Geography Matriz is buttressed between its urban neighbors Ang√∫stias (along its southern border), Concei√ß√£o (along its northern), and the landlocked parish of Flamengos (towards the west)): it fronts Horta Bay, and the island of Pico towards the east. Generally, the parish is a gently sloping tract of land that slopes towards the interior (Flamengos), that is highly urbanized and which constitutes the core the city of Horta. Most commercial, administrative and residential uses are concentrated in this parish, including the Regional Assembly, many of the historical churches (including Igreja Matriz do SS.¬∫ Salvador da Horta), convents and social services, antique farmers market, post office, archive and other public buildings.

The population in 2011 was 834,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 9.20 km¬≤.Eurostat Although it was the beachhead of early settlement on the island, its population has not grown significantly since it was settled. It has become an important summer destination and tourist center for its long black sand beach. History The front facade of the Church of Nossa Senhora da Gra√ßa Praia was originally a beachhead of settlement on Faial, first used by as a beachhead for explorers, and then by new colonists coming to settle the central group of the Azores. In 1466, Josse van Huerter and his Flemish compatriots landed on the beach in a misguided hope of discovery precious metals (in particular tin and silver). Their settlement abridged the Lomba dos Frades, where they stayed for about a year. There was a falling out between Huerter and his crew, and he narrowly escaped the island with his life. He later returned in 1466-67, with a commission from the Duchess of Burgundy to settle and populate the islands in the name of the crown of Portugal. Quickly, he discovered that the area's limitations continued, and he abandoned this settlement in favour of the adjacent valley, later known as the Vale dos Flamengos (Valley of the Flemings); some island chroniclers blamed the abandon of Praia on the lack of a potable water source.Agostinho de Mont'Alverne, 1986 Meanwhile, other settlers continued to occupy this region, where a small settlement persisted through the decades. Praia, likely, received its current toponymy (based in Moorish or Islamic origin) for being the point of settlement for the administrator of lands or royal treasurer on the island; almoxarife means treasurer, a term now in disuse in Portugal, but which refers to an agent responsible for guarding, distributing, inventorying goods or supplies. On 12 September 1597, English privateers sacked and burned down the buildings in the parish. By 1643, friar Diogo das Chagas, noted that the parish consisted of 305 inhabitants dispersed within the valley.Diogo das Chagas, 1989, pp.478 On 1 February 1718, many residents gathered at the Casa da C√¢mara (Municipal House), in Horta, following the catastrophic eruption on the island of Pico, which disturbed the parishes of Santa Luzia and Bandeiras. From here, the local residents travelled in procession to the Church of Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o (Our Lady of the Conception), with an image of Senhor Santo Cristo, which was met by another group of faithful carrying a statue of the Virgin Mary. At the church the groups prayed for \\"redemption and mercy\\". During the course of their benedictions, the community made a pledgeAnt√≥nio Louren√ßo da Silveira Macedo (1871), pp.214-215 to continue to celebrate masses of penance, devotion and thanksgiving on future anniversaries in the name of Senhor Santo Cristo; as they pledged \\"for every year as long as the earth existed...at the municipality's expense...with all officials...assisted by all communities, to be made at your church of Praia...at all expense necessary\\".Fernando Faria Ribeiro (2007), pp.37-38 Following the beginning of the First Portuguese Republic until 1926, owing to an anti-religious secularism in the political administration in Portugal (and the Azores), the masses of thanksgiving were discontinued. After the 1926 Horta earthquake which destroyed 204 houses out of 220 in Praia do Almoxarife, a new petition by citizens, to renew the tradition, was forwarded to the Minist√©rio do Interior (Ministry of the Interior), where the minister authorized the chief of the district to renew the tradition. Geography Nestled between Lomba da Espalamaca and Lomba dos Frades, the parish is primarily an agricultural settlement. Bisected by the eastern Regional Road E.R.1-1¬™, the community is divided to an eastern beach community, and western pastureland that extends westerly to the island's caldera. The parish contains the localities Caminho do Meio, Canada dos Cedros, Facho, Fenandega, Ladeira da Praia, Lomba, Praia, Ramada and Rocha Vermelha.  Sights and architecture  Close to Largo Coronel Silva Leal, the centre of the municipality, several old houses built in the traditional style of the island can be seen in the small lanes of Rua da Igreja http://www.inventario.iacultura.pt/faial/horta_fichas/71_2_4.html and Rua Padre Ant√≥nio C√¢ndido Avelar.http://www.inventario.iacultura.pt/faial/horta_fichas/71_2_2.html Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Gra√ßa, the comparatively large parish church, was mentioned in a document in 1568 for the first time. Having been burnt by privateers in 1597 it was rebuilt in a baroque style in 1758 with two side chapels and two tall towers. The church was severely damaged by an earthquake on 9 July 1998 and repaired afterwards.http://www.inventario.iacultura.pt/faial/horta_fichas/71_2_3.html A small park with a pavilion was laid out in front of the church. Opposite the church a small Holy Spirit Chapel was built, Imp√©rio da Trindade. The years 1873 and 1943 were painted onto the fa√ßade, 1873 referring to the construction and 1943 referring to the renovation of the chapel.Daniel Lu√≠s: Faial - Gu√≠a do Patrim√≥nio Cultural, S. 129. Lissabon 2004 Economy Beach of Praia do Amoxarife Public park and Imp√©rio da Trindade Central square Largo Coronel Silva Leal Due to its relative proximity to Horta, the community has become a surrogate for tourist and summer vacationers due to its beach. This has steadily become an important primary economic resource, overtaking the traditional agriculture and dairy production, which is primarily concentrated to the west of the Regional Road.

Later renamed WDCH, the station continued until the fall of 1925 when an inadvertent obscenity uttered over the air caused the college president, Ernest Martin Hopkins, to permanently shut it down. Radio finally returned to Dartmouth in 1941 due to the efforts of a group of determined students (led by Richard Krolik, class of 1941) and younger faculty who persuaded Hopkins to give the students a second chance. The new station, dubbed DBS, at first broadcast via tiny transmitters in each dormitory, each operating on a different frequency.Brooks, p. 39 In 1942 this unwieldy arrangement was changed to a \\"carrier current\\" system using the college electrical system to reach the dormitories. In 1948 the call letters were changed to WDBS, and in 1958, after considerable controversy, the station obtained a standard AM broadcast license. On March 4, 1958 the students began broadcasting to the entire Upper Valley region as WDCR at 1340 Khz on the dial.Brooks, p. 107-128. Dartmouth Broadcasting launched WFRD (FM Radio at Dartmouth) 99.3 FM on February 19, 1976.Brooks, p. 199 Student governance Throughout most of its history the two stations were completely managed by students. Even today the vast majority of the on-air personnel are students, although there are some exceptions (such as the football play-by-play announcers.) This is an unusual example of student-run commercial radio.

Current organization *WFRD is the FM portion of Dartmouth's radio program, also known as 99Rock. 99Rock broadcasts across the entire Dartmouth-Lake Sunapee Region (i.e., west-central New Hampshire), along with adjacent east-central Vermont. Though a classic rock format until the early 2000s, 99Rock now runs active rock music 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, showcasing bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Green Day, Pearl Jam, and Sublime. *Dartmouth Election Network works with Dartmouth Broadcast News to provide election coverage year round. Every four years, it offers special election-night coverage during the famous New Hampshire primary. In 1988, they made a legendary faux pas when they called the Primary for Dick Gephardt, based on stronger than expected early returns: Gephardt in fact lost to Michael S. Dukakis by 16 percentage points, 36% to 20%. However, the coverage is of high quality and is sometimes syndicated to conventional radio stations.

The school is a member of the Ivy Preparatory School League. The school serves approximately 1,700 students with 480 faculty and staff. Jessica L. Bagby has been the Head of School since June 2016.\\"ECF Announces Next Head of School, Dr. Damian J. Fernandez\\" The school consists of four divisions: Ethical Culture, Fieldston Lower, Fieldston Middle, and Fieldston Upper. Ethical Culture, located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and Fieldston Lower, located on the Fieldston campus in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, serve Pre-K through 5th grade. The two lower schools feed into Fieldston Middle (6th‚Äì8th grades) and Fieldston Upper (9th‚Äì12th grades)‚Äîalso located on the Fieldston campus in Riverdale. Ethical Culture is headed by Principal Rob Cousins, Fieldston Lower is headed by Principal Joe McCauley, Fieldston Middle is headed by Principal Chia-Chee Chiu, and Fieldston Upper is headed by Principal Nigel Furlonge. Tuition and fees for ECFS were $52,993 for the 2019‚Äì2020 school year.  History  Workingmens school, in 1893 Ethical Culture in New York City Felix Adler, circa 1913 The school opened in 1878 as a free kindergarten, founded by Felix Adler at the age of 24. In 1880, elementary grades were added, and the school was then called the Workingman's School. At that time, the idea that the children of the poor should be educated was innovative. By 1890 the school's academic reputation encouraged many more wealthy parents to seek it out, and the school was expanded to accommodate the upper-class as well, and began charging tuition; in 1895 the name changed to \\"The Ethical Culture School\\", and in 1903 the New York Society for Ethical Culture became its sponsor. Fieldston awards over $15 million in tuition-based financial aid to 22% of the student body. The school moved into its landmark Manhattan building at 33 Central Park West in 1904. The entire school was located in that building until 1928 when the high school division (Fieldston) moved to its 18-acre (73,000 m¬≤) campus on Fieldston Road in the exclusive Fieldston section of Riverdale; the Manhattan branch of the Lower School remained there, and in 1932 a second Lower School was opened on the Riverdale campus. In 2007, a new middle school was opened on the same Riverdale campus, for the 6th, 7th, and 8th grades. One of the early faculty members was the famous documentary photographer Lewis Hine. In March 1970, about 60 students occupied the administration building in protest to demand that more Black and Puerto Rican students be admitted to the school. They also aimed to have a greater number of minority courses, teachers, advisors, employees. The school agreed to some of the student demands. = Recent developments = Beginning in 2015, the school began segregating children into \\"affinity groups\\" based on their self- identified race. These \\"affinity groups\\", which are mandatory for all children beginning in third grade, meet weekly to discuss issues of race and bias. https://www.thecut.com/2015/05/can-fieldston-un-teach- racism.htmlhttps://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/pride-and- prejudice-at-fieldston In February 2019, a video that is believed to be created years previously was discovered by administrators after it was shared during a dispute between students. The students in the video use derogatory and racist language. Students involved who were still enrolled in the school were punished, however some 100 students who thought the actions were not enough staged a sit-in reminiscent of the 1970 protest. The students presented the administrators with twenty demands that included increased racial bias training, more faculty of color, the recruitment of more students of color, and a required ethnic studies course; the students' demands were agreed to and are planned to be implemented over the course of 2‚Äì3 years.Fieldston Middle The school also attracted attention in November 2019 after it hosted a guest speaker who engaged in antisemitic rhetoric.Hirsch, Ammiel and Joshua Davidson. \\"The Anti-Israel Craze Hits High School.\\" New York Times. 16 January 2020. 16 January 2020. Some parents have raised concerns about the way the school addressed this issue. U.S. Congressmen Josh Gottheimer and Max Rose also wrote its administrators condemning the incident. In January 2020, the school fired a Jewish teacher who posted tweets opposing Zionism.JTA, Ben Sales: Elite N.Y. Prep School Fires Teacher Who Posted anti-Zionist Tweets In: Haaretz, 11 January 2020. There were parents who asked for the teacher's reinstatement. Academics Fieldston dropped its participation in the Advanced Placement Program in 2002 to give its faculty the freedom to offer more innovative, challenging, and thought-provoking material. Students can take AP exams, but the school no longer officially sponsors such courses. While there was some concern that college admissions could be negatively affected, Fieldston's college office worked closely with admissions officers of schools across the country to explain the change and to assure that its students would be evaluated on the quality of its courses, even without the AP designation. Athletics Fieldston's athletic program includes 62 teams covering 23 sports. The teams, known as the \\"Fieldston Eagles,\\" play in the Ivy Preparatory School League against other private schools in the region.

Biography Born in 1917 to a peasant family in the small village of Krestovaya in northwestern Russia (present-day Novgorod Oblast), Pavlov joined the Red Army in 1938. During World War II, he fought on the Southwestern, Stalingrad, 3rd Ukrainian and 2nd Belorussian fronts. Pavlov was a commander of a machine gun unit, an artilleryman, and a commander of a reconnaissance unit with the rank of senior sergeant. During the Battle of Stalingrad, on the night of September 27, 1942, Pavlov's platoon recaptured a four-story residential building seized by the German Army, and defended it against continual attack by the Germans until relieved by advancing Soviet forces two months later.

He governed the province until 48, and during this period put down the rebellion of Cylicia Tracheotide. He was consul in 49, and elevated to patrician status by Claudius who also appointed him augur. Veranius became governor of Britain in 57 then, replacing Aulus Didius Gallus. He reversed Didius's policy of maintaining existing borders and began military operations against the troublesome Silures in what is now Wales, but died within a year. In his will he flattered Nero and claimed that, had he had another two years, he would have conquered the whole of the island. He was replaced by Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, and the speed with which Suetonius took Wales suggests that Veranius had already done much of the work.

Biography =Youth= De la Mar was born in Cuenca in what today is Ecuador. The son of Marcos de la Mar y Migura (1736-1794) and his wife Josefa Paula Cort√°zar y Lavayen (1748-1815), he spent his early childhood in Spain. =Military career in Spain, France and Peru (1794-1820)= With the help of his influential uncle, de la Mar entered the Spanish army as a sub-lieutenant of the regiment of Savoy. In 1794 he participated in the campaign of Roussillon against the French Republic, fighting under the command of Count of Conquest, after which he was promoted to captain ( 1795 ). Then participated in various military actions against revolutionary France, and was already a lieutenant colonel in the time of Spain's national war against Napoleon's invasion ( 1808 ). He participated in the defense of Zaragoza next to the Colonel Palafox ( 1808 - 1809 ). Was seriously injured, and although that city finally capitulated, earned the title of \\"Hero of the nation in a heroic\\" and promotion to colonel . In 1812 he transferred to the front of Valencia, led by General Joaqu√≠n Blake, and sent a column of 4,000 veterans grenadiers (the \\"column The Sea\\"). Again he was wounded, and was taken to hospital in Tudela, where he was captured by the French.

After a time managed to escape, accompanied by Brigadier Juan Mar√≠a Mu√±oz and Manito, crossed Switzerland and the Tyrol and reached the port of Trieste, on the Adriatic Sea, where he sailed back to Spain. In 1815, Ferdinand VII promoted him to Brigadier, awarded him the Saint Hermenegildo's Cross and appointed him Sub-Inspector of the Viceroyalty of Peru, with the title of Governor of Callao. He arrived at the city in 1816. In 1819, he was promoted to field marshal. =The War of Independence (1821‚Äì1827)= ;The Royalist Cause During the early days of the Peruvian War of Independence, he joined forces with the Royalists, taking care of the Real Felipe Fortress, in the main port of the Viceroyalty, Callao. Viceroy Jos√© de la Serna abandoned the capital on June 6, 1821, leaving him with explicit orders to resist and wait for reinforcements. He successfully stopped all attempts to capture the fort for nearly 4 months, until the arrival of General Jos√© Canterac and a powerful division sent by Viceroy de la Serna gave him the orders to surrender the fort due to the lack of supplies and troops. On September 19, the garrison surrendered, in the Baquijano Capitulation, only two days after de la Mar finally submitted his left foot to amputation, having initially refused treatment of a gangrenous toe.Vicente Villar√°n, Manuel & Jos√© Tordoya, Pedro.

It was hailed as one of Leslie Cheung's most memorable action films since A Better Tomorrow. The film was followed by two sequels, One Nite in Mongkok, released in 2004, and Triple Tap, released in 2010, both of which was directed by Derek Yee and features Fong reprising his role as Inspector Miu. Synopsis Leslie Cheung plays Rick Pang, a shooting champion who is also a gun expert who tinkers with his pistols and modified its magazine to perfect his technique known as 'double tap' which is the terminology for a shooter placing two shots in the same exact spot, to maximize marksmanship in any competition. In a shooting competition, he goes up against another experienced top cop who is just as comfortable on the pistols as Rick, named Miu. Unfortunately, the competition was marred by a depressed day trader, a friend of Miu, who lost much in the stock market and threatened the safety of the contest, wounding the shooting supervisor, another of Miu's friends. Rick was forced to kill him with his trademark double tap as the former approaches Colleen (Rick's girlfriend) and Vincent. Miu took note of this astounding technique in the post-mortem while Rick's experience from this encounter was strangely exciting to him and he discovers his lust for murdering others in cold blood. As further murders were committed by an unknown gunman with the similar 'double tap' technique, the list of possible candidates by the police was narrowed down to just a few candidates but Miu was utterly convinced that Rick was also behind all those heinous crimes and hauls him up for investigation. Although Rick was released after an interrogation (having had no solid evidence incriminating him), Miu continued to pursue him and pressurise Rick to an extent that the murderer was suddenly possessed by rage and decided to take the law in his own hands. Rick went to his favorite shooting range and lay in wait for his pursuers. Arming himself with live rounds for his modified pistol, he engaged in a fierce gunfight with the cops and escaped at the first possible opportunity. It later transpired that Rick was indeed haunted by his earlier murder at the competition but his insatiated lust for murder was further fuelled by his obsession with the 'double tap' technique as he sought to perfect it. Further, he has inadvertently discovered a new use for his pistols: to kill those who opposed him and those who pushed him to the brink.

The Utah & Northern Railway is a defunct railroad that was operated in the Utah Territory and later in the Idaho Territory and Montana Territory in the western United States during the 1870s and 1880s. It was the first railroad in Idaho and in Montana. The original of the Utah Northern Railroad (later named Utah & Northern Railway) was conceived and built by the Mormons. It was a narrow gauge spur off the Union Pacific portion of the transcontinental railroad. The labor for this railroad was largely volunteer Mormon labor as the intent of the railroad was to serve the Mormon communities in the Cache Valley that had been settled almost entirely by the Mormons. It was a case of Mormons forming a company and building their own railroad because existing railroad companies showed no interest in building such a railroad.Colorado Rail Annual No. 15, Colorado Railroad Museum, 1981, pp 9-10. The northern half of the Cache Valley is in Idaho and, due to claims and disputes by the Shoshone and Bannock Indians, was not settled by the Mormons until after the Bear River Massacre and subsequent Fort Bridger Treaty of 1868 that forced the Shoshone and Bannock onto reservations.Bd Madsen, The Northern Shoshone, Caxton Printers, 1980. pp 33-36. The original Mormon plan for the Utah Northern was to build a railroad to the communities in the Cache Valley and about into Idaho to Soda Springs, Idaho that lies in a valley beyond called the Bear River Valley. This was by dictate of Brigham Young as he owned land in Soda Springs and believed that the Bear River Valley had potential for further Mormon settlement.Colorado Rail Annual No. 15, Colorado Railroad Museum, 1981, p 14. The Mormons also believed they could break the monopoly that the anti-Mormon town of Corinne, Utah had on the wagon freight business on the Montana Trail by extending the railroad into Idaho.Colorado Rail Annual No. 15, Colorado Railroad Museum, 1981, p 12. There were tentative plans to eventually extend the Utah Northern to Montana. The road was constructed northward from the Union Pacific line at Ogden commencing construction on August 24, 1871. In three years, the largely volunteer railroad company had built of road. It reached Franklin, Idaho, across the Idaho border, in May 1874 where construction was halted. Investors had become hesitant after the panic of 1873 and the railroad was now moving into the northern half of the Cache Valley where there were fewer Mormon volunteers due to this area only recently having been relinquished by the Bannock and Shoshone. Poor decisions by the planners and the lack of business from the frugal residents of the Cache Valley led to the bankruptcy and foreclosure sale of the Utah Northern only a few years later in 1878. Utah & Northern Bridge at Eagle Rock (Idaho Falls), Idaho circa 1880 with railroad shops in background. Robber baron Jay Gould transformed the Utah Northern. He and Union Pacific acquired the Utah Northern Railroad, changing the name to the Utah & Northern Railway and infusing the railroad with capital.Colorado Rail Annual No. 15, Colorado Railroad Museum, 1981, p 31. Big business knew that an electrical age was coming and that the demand for copper products was putting pressure on copper prices.Ken Burns Presents: The West, Directed by Stephen Ives, Writers: Dayton Duncan, Geoffrey C. Ward, 2004 They knew that there were rich copper deposits at the mines near Butte, Montana. Union Pacific quickly resumed construction on the Utah & Northern Railway after purchase in April 1878. Jay Gould invested personal money to get construction started just beyond Franklin in the fall of 1877. The new plan was not to build the road to Soda Springs, but to build a longer road on a direct route through the Cache Valley, then north across eastern Idaho and north across western Montana to Butte, Montana. In the first year of construction, they reached Eagle Rock (now Idaho Falls, Idaho), north of the Utah/Idaho border, where they built a bridge across the Snake River in early 1879.Deseret News, 1879-07-17 p. article \\"Utah and Northern\\" describes the scene at Eagle Rock and describes the new railroad bridge. In the second year, they added another of track and crossed the continental divide at the Idaho/Montana border. After three and a half years of construction, before the close of 1881, they completed the additional of road to Butte, Montana. Butte became the largest copper producing city in the world and Butte's population, by some estimates, grew to nearly 100,000. This made Butte, with its \\"Copper Kings,\\" the second largest city in the West with more influence than Salt Lake City, Denver, Sacramento, Seattle, or Portland. Only San Francisco remained larger and more important. Butte, with its large- scale mining and smelting operations, was dubbed the Pittsburg of the West. The Utah & Northern was switched from narrow gauge to on July 25, 1887 Union Pacific Railroad Track Profile 11Feb2004 only six years after completing the line to Butte.Colorado Rail Annual No. 15, Colorado Railroad Museum, 1981, pp 55-56. The railroad operated successfully for several years and finally became a branch of the Union Pacific Railroad.

In over twenty-five works of fiction and poetry, Sorrentino explored the comic and formal possibilities of language and literature. His insistence on the primacy of language and his forays into metafiction mark him as a postmodernist, but he is also known for his ear for American speech and his attention to the particularities of place, especially of his native Brooklyn. Life Sorrentino was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1929. He grew up in the borough's Bay Ridge neighborhood and attended Brooklyn College before and after serving in the United States Army Medical Corps during the Korean War. In 1956, Sorrentino founded the literary magazine Neon with friends from Brooklyn College, including childhood friend Hubert Selby Jr. He edited Neon from 1956 to 1960, then served as editor for Kulchur from 1961 to 1963. After working closely with Selby on the manuscript of Last Exit to Brooklyn (1964), Sorrentino was an editor at Grove Press from 1965 to 1970, where one of his editorial projects was The Autobiography of Malcolm X. Sorrentino's first marriage, to the former Elsene Wiessner, ended in divorce. The disintegration of their marriage is fictionalized in Sorrentino's first novel, The Sky Changes. They had two children, Jesse (b. 1954) and Delia (1957‚Äì2002). In 1968, Sorrentino married Victoria Ortiz. Their son, Christopher Sorrentino, is the author of the novels Sound on Sound, Trance, and The Fugitives. He eventually took up positions at Sarah Lawrence College, Columbia University, the University of Scranton and the New School for Social Research in New York before being hired as a professor of English at Stanford University, where he taught from 1982 to 1999. Although Sorrentino never finished his degree, the head of Stanford's writing program opined that \\"Sorrentino is a very learned man ‚Äì we weren't for a second concerned about a Good Housekeeping seal of approval.\\" Sorrentino's students included the writers Ammiel Alcalay, Trey Ellis, Jeffrey Eugenides, Nicole Krauss, and Jenny Offill. Following his retirement from Stanford, Sorrentino returned to Bay Ridge, where he lived for the remainder of his life. Writing Sorrentino's first novel, The Sky Changes, was published in 1966. Notable among his many other novels are Imaginative Qualities of Actual Things, Blue Pastoral, and Mulligan Stew. The latter novel, a humorous postmodern romp, riffs on the metafictional possibilities introduced in Flann O'Brien's novel At Swim-Two-Birds, and is one of Sorrentino's most popular works. His 1999 novel, Gold Fools, is written entirely in interrogative sentences not, as critic Steven Moore says, \\"just to see if he could pull it off, but because he wanted to interrogate our cultural assumptions about the Old West.\\" In 2010 a posthumous novel, The Abyss of Human Illusion, was published by Coffee House Press with a preface by Christopher Sorrentino. Honors and awards Sorrentino was the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including Guggenheim Fellowships in Fiction in 1973 and 1987, the John Dos Passos Prize for Literature (1981), PEN/Faulkner Award finalist in 1981 and 2003, the Mildred and Harold Strauss Livings of the American Academy of Arts and Letters (declined, 1982), the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award for Literature (1985), the Lannan Literary Award for Fiction (1992), and the Lannan Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005.

History The company was started in 1979 and took its name from its founder, Roger Sadowsky, known for \\"being one of the industry's master craftsmen\\". As of 2011 the company has 10 employees involved in instrument manufacturing excluding Sadowsky himself. Sadowsky started out modifying vintage Fender basses, which were at that time inexpensive, to improve their sound by adding more noise reduction technology and replacing the passive electronics with an active preamp, which increases the bass's signal-to-noise ratio. Once the price of vintage bass guitars began to increase, Sadowsky started making new bass guitars, and then signature models.  Models  = NYC Range = The Sadowsky \\"NYC\\" line of instruments consists of four- and five-string bass guitars and six-string guitars. The bass guitars have a 34-inch scale length with no current models offered in longer or shorter scale lengths. All Sadowsky basses are available only with bolt-on necks. A weight-reducing chambered body is unique to the NYC range (including Satin series and Deluxe Satin series). The NYC series has a wide range of customisation options. The electronics of the NYC series are all hand wired. = NYC Satin = The Satin range of NYC basses are made in the same workshop as the NYC basses, with a reduction in colour options with a satin finish. There are no customisation options available. Sadowsky introduced the Verdine White signature bass in the Satin line of instruments. This bass was built as a tribute to Verdine's late brother, Maurice White. Two instruments are being donated to the Verdine White Performing Arts Center with proceeds from sales of this model being donated in addition to the instruments. The electronics of the Satin range are pre-wired, and the tuners are Korean made. The Deluxe Satin range of NYC basses follow the same cost-saving principals as the regular Satin range, but with the addition of flame maple tops at extra cost. The electronics of the Satin range are pre-wired, and the tuners are Korean made. =MetroLine= The Sadowsky Metro line are the basic models of Sadowsky NYC basses made by Sadowsky Tokyo and offers most of the same features, minus the custom options, of the NYC line at a more affordable price. These instruments are made by hand by Yoshi Kikuchi and his team. The Sadowsky Metro Express line of basses are factory- made instruments made in Japan. These models have a very limited colour choice. Sadowsky, as of 2003, also offers a line of archtop guitars. There are currently five models available, the Jim Hall model, the Jimmy Bruno model, the semi-hollow model, the LS-17 (long scale/17\\" lower bout) and the SS-15 (short scale/15\\" lower bout). Serial Numbering =NYC Instruments= Instruments manufactured in New York City are assigned as follows: * Basses, including NYC, Satin and Satin Deluxe are assigned a number, for example #1234. * Archtop guitars are assigned a number with an ‚ÄòA‚Äô prefix, for example #A1234. =Japan (Metro) Instruments= Instruments manufactured in Japan at assigned as follows: * MetroLine basses are prefixed with an ‚ÄòM‚Äô for example #M1234. * MetroExpress basses are prefixed with an ‚ÄòME‚Äô for example #ME1234.

It is bordered by the neighboring communes of Nuvolento, Caino and Botticino. History Framed by the mountains of Valle Sabbia, the municipality of Serle is located in a basin of the valley rising up from the river Chiese to Cariadeghe plateau. The etymology of the name could originate from this morphological feature, since serule means dolina. The area has been inhabited since the Mesolithic period. Being a Roman settlement, as shown by old furnace, Serle was very important in the early 11th century, when the bishop of Brescia Olderico founded the monastery of San Peter in Monte Orsino on mount San Bartolomeo. The monastery had a very strong political and religious power and significantly influenced the history of a vast territory until 1446. The town became an independent municipality in 1138 and part of the \\"quadra di Gavardo\\" during the Venetian domination. The economy was based on agriculture and cattle rearing in the past; it is now supported by marble extraction, handcrafts, trading of charcoal, and building activities. Serle played a role in the history of the Italian Risorgimento, due to the heroic acts of the Catholic priest Don Pietro Boifava (1794‚Äì1879), a protagonist of the \\"10 Giornate di Brescia\\" riot with Tito Speri. Places =San Bartolomeo's church= Th church was built during the 8th century on the ruins of the Benedictine monastery. From the old coenoby it still keeps Romanesque remains and a fresco by Paolo da Caylina il Giovane in the apse. Also the church, still existing in 1138 and become sanctuary of the Beata Vergine Annunciata in 1747, belonged to the monastery. The imposing parish church dedicated to San Pietro in Vincoli and built during the early 18th century is a rare example of 18th-century style in Lombardy and a National Monument. All churches are decorated with many marble altars made by the \\"rezzatese\\" school in Rezzato during the 17th-18th centuries. Nature The natural monument upland of Cariadeghe is very important for its environmental and speleological features. It is characterized by karstic features including dolinas, caves, and swallow holes conveying water under the ground. A large number of majestic century-old trees grow in the protected area. Politics Since 2004 the mayor of Serle has been Gianluigi Zanola. The city council has 12 seats. After the June 2009 elections, the new city council has eight seats filled by members of the Democratic Party and four filled by The People of Freedom.

It was preceded by a popular revolt against the Argentine government, rallying behind the motto \\"All of them must go!\\" (), which caused the resignation of then-president Fernando de la R√∫a, giving way to a period of political instability during which five government officials performed the duties of the Argentinian presidency. This period of instability occurred during the larger period of crisis known as the Argentine great depression, an economic, political, and social crisis that lasted from 1998 until 2002. The December 2001 crisis was a direct response to the government's imposition of \\"Corral\\" policies () at the behest of economic minister Domingo Cavallo, which restricted people's ability to withdraw cash from banks. Rioting and protests became widespread on 19 December 2001, immediately following the president's declaration of a state of emergency and his resignation on the following day. A state of extreme institutional instability continued for the next twelve days, during which the successor president Adolfo Rodr√≠guez Sa√° resigned as well. While the degree of instability subsided, the events of December 2001 would become a blow against the legitimacy of the Argentine government that would persist for the following years. The majority of the participants in the protests were unaffiliated with any political party or organization, though evidence points at Peronist organizations involved in the sacking of small business with complicity of the police, which liberated the zone (in contrast with large supermarkets chain which were protected and suffered few sackings). Over the course of the protests, 39 people were killed by police and security forces, most of them during sackings in provinces governed by the Peronists opposition. Of the 39 killed, nine were minors, which is an indication of the degree of repression ordered by the government to oppose the protests.  Background  = The Argentinian economy = Fernando de la R√∫a, as the candidate for the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education , had assumed the role of president in December 1999 in the middle of a recession, which was caused in part by the Convertibility plan () passed in 1991 which pegged the value of the Argentine peso to the United States dollar. While political reforms under the previous president Carlos Menem had succeeded in reducing inflation, the downsides of his economic policies became more and more apparent starting in 1997. Maintaining the convertibility of pesos to dollars required the government of Argentina to obtain an abundant supply of American dollars. At first, this supply was maintained by the privatization of nearly all of the Argentinian state's industries and pension funds. As the privatization process was completed, Argentina's agriculture export-based economy was unable to maintain a sufficient flow of dollars to the state, and the system began to require more and more sovereign debt. = Fernando de la R√∫a's presidency = One of the key factors leading to the victory of the Alliance in the 1999 elections was its promise to uphold the convertibility plan. One of de la R√∫a's campaign slogans declared \\"With me, one peso, one dollar\\" (). Despite a changing international economic situation (including economic downturns in Brazil, one of Argentina's key economic partners), and mounting demands for increased monetary sovereignty, the Alliance committed itself to maintain the status quo at all costs.  October 2000 Crisis  De la R√∫a's political situation was precarious. His arrival to power in 1999 had been possible thanks to the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education (), a coalition formed by the Radical Civic Union and the FrePaSo, which managed to defeat the incumbent Justicialist Party (the Peronist party) in that year's presidential elections. However, the Alliance (as it was known) failed to achieve a majority in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, and lost the provincial elections to the Peronists, who then remained in charge of large and critical districts such as the Buenos Aires, C√≥rdoba and Santa Fe provinces. The government coalition was strained from the first moment; the FrePaSo leaders resented being \\"junior members\\" of the government (being forced to that position after losing their bid to the Governorship of Buenos Aires), while the Radicals were divided between their left- and right-leaning factions (De la R√∫a was a leader of the party's conservatives), especially regarding economic policy. In late 2000 a political scandal broke out when it was reported that SIDE, Argentina's intelligence service, had paid massive bribes to a number of senators to approve a controversial Labor Reform Act. The head of SIDE, Fernando de Santiba√±es, was a personal friend of De la R√∫a. The crisis came to a head on October 2000 when Vice President Carlos √Ålvarez resigned, citing De la R√∫a's unwillingness to tackle corruption.  March 2001 Crisis  De la R√∫a's economic policies suffered a severe blow in March 2001 when Economy Minister Jos√© Luis Machinea resigned from office. He was briefly replaced by the then-Defense Minister Ricardo L√≥pez Murphy, who himself was forced to resign following negative reception to his shock program. After only two weeks in office, L√≥pez Murphy was replaced by Domingo Cavallo, who had previously served as Economy Minister between 1991 and 1996, and who was the original author of the Convertibility plan during Menem's presidency. Because of the worsening economic situation and mounting foreign debt, the government enacted two enormous campaigns of debt-expansion and refinancing under the supervision of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), named \\"The armoring\\" () and \\"The Megaexchange\\" () respectively. From the first moment, there were allegations of corruption and money laundering about the megacanje. The crisis also caused the resignation of all the FrePaSo Cabinet ministers, leaving de la R√∫a without political support. The congressional elections of October 2001 were a disaster for the government, which lost many of its seats in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies to the Peronists. The election results marked also a growing unrest within Argentina's voters, who took to cast millions of null or blank votes. The Peronists seized the opportunity to appoint Senator Ram√≥n Puerta to be President Pro-Tempore of the Argentine Senate, a situation which added to De la R√∫a's political weakness since in the Argentine system the President Pro-Tempore of the Senate is next in line for the Presidency after the Vice President. With no Vice President of its own, Puerta's designation meant that De la R√∫a had a virtual Peronist Vice President. Social unrest was also growing. Since the late 1990s, protest movements had formed in Argentina, notably the piqueteros (\\"picketeers\\"), initially made up of unemployed workers. The piqueteros blockaded major roads and highways demanding government subsidies and other welfare measures. They featured prominently during the March 2001 crisis. The crisis reached a breaking point on 29 November 2001, as major investors began to withdraw their deposits from the banks, summarily causing the collapse of the Argentinian banking system due to capital flight. This was compounded by the IMF's decision to refuse to refinance Argentina's debt. = Corralito = At the beginning of December 2001, the IMF cut off the flow of funds to Argentina and capital flight became uncontrollable, with 25% of all the money in Argentinian banks having been withdrawn since the beginning of 2001. On 2 December, Finance Minister Cavallo announced a national cash-withdrawal limit of $250/week. Popular opinion was very negative, especially amongst the middle class (bearing in mind that the weekly withdrawal limit was higher than the total savings of the majority of the Argentinian population), for whom the economic crisis caused a breach of political confidence. Protests were held throughout December, although the largest and most important protests were those held on 19 and 20 December. Although people could still use their money via credit cards, checks and other forms of non-cash payments, the enforcement of these measures caused delays and problems for the general population and especially for businesses. Massive queues at every bank and growing reports of political crisis contributed to inflame Argentina's political scenario. De la R√∫a's position had become unsustainable, and an attempt by the Catholic Church to mediate between the government and the opposition in mid-December failed. Between 16 and 19 December there were several incidents involving unemployed activists and protesters which demanded the handing-out of food bags from supermarkets. These incidents ended up with outright looting of supermarkets and convenience stores on 18 December, taking place on Rosario and the Greater Buenos Aires areas. = General strike and looting = On 13 December, the General Confederation of Labour and the Argentine Workers' Central Union declared their seventh general strike against the policies of de la R√∫a's government. The strike had a high participation rate, including strikes in sectors that rarely participated in general strikes, such as the financial sector and un-unionized workplaces. During the time of the strike, there were riots in the working class neighborhoods of some cities, largely instigated by the striking piqueteros. Looting occurred in various commercial districts in the country's interior and in Buenos Aires. Thousands of people participated in looting, truck-robbery, and street-blocking. From 13 to 19 December, seven people were killed by security forces and shopowners.  19 December  President De la R√∫a declares the state of siege throughout the country. Following the broadcast, a strong \\"cacerolazo\\" took place in Buenos Aires and other major cities of Argentina, and thousands took the streets and main plazas in protest. (video in Spanish) Throughout the day new lootings took place, and the Government believed that Peronist agitators were fueling the protests, especially in the province of Buenos Aires. This came after noting that the lootings often took place in Peronist-governed towns, and that the Buenos Aires Provincial Police (which ultimately answered to Buenos Aires Governor Carlos Ruckauf, a top Peronist) was strangely mild in restoring order. With violence mounting across Argentina's major cities, President De la R√∫a began to consider alternative measures to restore order. The first option considered was to deploy the military to contain the violence. However, Argentine legislation forbids military intervention in domestic security matters unless the police and security forces are overwhelmed, a situation quickly pointed out by the Chairman of the Joint General Staff and the Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy and Air Force. The military also pointed out that they would only intervene if their deployment was authorized by a law voted in Congress, something impossible given the Peronist majority in both Houses. The Argentine military was unwilling to take the blame if violence grew worse, learning from what had previously happened when President Isabel Per√≥n issued an executive order commanding them to fight the subversive guerrilla movements of the 1970s (see Dirty War). With military intervention no longer an option, De la R√∫a resorted to declare a state of siege (essentially a state of emergency) throughout the country, deploying the Federal Police, the National Gendarmerie (border guard) and the Naval Prefecture (coast guard) to contain the growing violence. Later that night, De la R√∫a addressed the nation to announce the state of siege and to call the Peronists to negotiate a \\"government of national unity\\". Following the broadcast, spontaneous cacerolazos (\\"pot banging\\") took place throughout Buenos Aires and other major cities, signaling the middle-class' own unrest. 19 December concluded with the resignation of Domingo Cavallo, who had lost whatever support he had within the government. Groups of protesters mobilized throughout Buenos Aires, some of them arriving to Plaza de Mayo, where there were incidents with the Federal Police forces.  20 December  Police intervention in the conflict What had begun as rioting by unemployed and leftist-leaning groups had turned into a middle-class protest with the cacerolazos, and the resignation of Cavallo did nothing to calm down the situation.Crisis grips Argentina BBC News, 20 December 2001 The De la R√∫a administration had agreed with the military to participate in an emergency handing-out of food, however, the plan failed due to lack of cooperation from the Ministry of Social Development. Throughout the morning, groups of protesters converged on Plaza de Mayo despite the state of siege.Argentina plunges into turmoil BBC News, 20 December 2001 The Federal Police, acting under orders from the government, proceeded to try to control the protests. An attempt by a federal judge to halt police operations was disregarded, and the situation worsened with the arrival of new groups of protesters. As violence expanded, President De la R√∫a tried to impose censorship on all news outlets from Buenos Aires. The idea was to use the state of siege to force the television networks to stop transmitting current events and broadcast emergency programming. This plan also failed because De la R√∫a's own Media Secretary refused to carry out his instructions. The state's repression was thus broadcast both within Argentina and abroad, causing further mobilizations toward the Plaza. Violent incidents between the police and protesters spread throughout the country. The most notorious ones took place at the Plaza de Mayo, where five people were killed. Some claim that the deaths were provoked by covert elements of the Buenos Aires Provincial Police in an attempt to further destabilize De la R√∫a. With his options steadily being reduced, De la R√∫a went onto national television at 4 p.m. to offer the Peronists to join the government and try to bring some peace to the country. At that time, a caucus of Peronist governors was taking place at a country villa in the province of San Luis. Three hours later, Humberto Roggero, head of the Peronist bloc of the House of Deputies, announced that the Peronist Party would not be a part of a \\"government of national unity\\". When he heard the Peronists' response, De la R√∫a decided to resign from office.\\"Argentine Leader, his Nation frayed, abruptly resigns\\" by Clifford Krauss. The New York Times, 21 December 2001 The situation on Plaza de Mayo (right in front of the Casa Rosada, the Presidential Palace) was still too violent for De la R√∫a to leave by car to his official residence at Olivos. Thus, the President's security detail decided to take him out of the Casa Rosada on board an Air Force helicopter. The iconic images of De la R√∫a's \\"escape\\" by helicopter were broadcast throughout the country. The violence slowly abated. By the end of the day, 26 people had died, five of them in Buenos Aires. With √Ålvarez having resigned a year earlier, the President Pro- Tempore of the Senate, Ram√≥n Puerta, took over as Interim President until Congress could appoint a successor to De la R√∫a. = Victims and criminal investigation = All told, 36 people were killed by police forces during the December riots, including 7 children. The largest incidence of violence was in the Plaza de Mayo of Buenos Aires, in what would become known in Argentina as the \\"Plaza de Mayo Massacre\\" (), where 5 people were killed and 227 were injured. These crimes were investigated and brought to court. Seventeen people were charged with murder, attempted murder, including the then-Secretary of Security Enrique Mathov and the former head of the Argentinian Federal Police, Ruben Santos. While various officials and police officers have been charged and sentenced to prison, as of 2016 the majority of cases pertaining to violence during the December riots have not moved forward.  Rodr√≠guez Sa√° Administration  Adolfo Rodr√≠guez Sa√° at his office in the Casa Rosada According to the Acephaly Act, Puerta would only be President until the Legislative Assembly (a joint session of the Senate and the House of Deputies) convened and appointed a new President from either one member of Congress or a provincial governor to complete the resigning President's period. The Peronist governors assembled at San Luis -arguably the most powerful men in Argentina at the period- were divided on whom to nominate. There were three \\"natural candidates\\", who were the governors of the three largest provinces: Carlos Ruckauf of Buenos Aires, Jos√© Manuel de la Sota of C√≥rdoba and Carlos Reutemann of Santa Fe. As a temporary arrangement, the governors decided to nominate Adolfo Rodr√≠guez Sa√°, Governor of San Luis. The Peronists' easy majority in both houses of Congress ensured that Rodr√≠guez Sa√° was elected on 22 December. While de la R√∫a's term expired in 2003, some argued that only a president legitimated by popular vote would be able to bring Argentina out of the crisis. To that end, Rodr√≠guez Sa√° was designated as interim president for only three months, until presidential elections were held on 3 March. If needed, a ballotage would be held on 17 March. The winner would take office on 5 April for the balance of de la R√∫a's term. However, Rodr√≠guez Sa√° didn't seem at all satisfied with being a caretaker president. From the first moment, Rodr√≠guez Sa√° embarked on ambitious projects aimed at giving him popularity. In his inaugural speech, he announced that Argentina would default on its foreign debt, an announcement received by rousing applause from the members of Congress. He then proceeded to announce the issuing of a \\"third currency\\" (alongside the peso and the dollar) to boost consumption. Later on, Rodr√≠guez Sa√° announced that he would extradite every former military officer charged with human rights abuses during the Dirty War who was requested by foreign courts. Another measure was to stand down the state of siege. There were also some unpopular designations to the Cabinet. The most notorious one was the appointment of former Mayor of Buenos Aires Carlos Grosso, arguably one of the most corrupt figures in Argentine politics. Rodr√≠guez Sa√° also courted the powerful Peronist trade unions in a move that was recognized as an attempt to wrestle power from the other Peronist governors. New riots and cacerolazos took place on Buenos Aires, with some protesters entering the Congress Palace and burning furniture. On 30 December, Rodr√≠guez Sa√° called for a summit of Peronist governors at the Presidential holiday retreat of Chapadmalal, south of Mar del Plata. Of the fourteen Peronist governors, only five attended. Realizing that he lacked support from his own party, Rodr√≠guez Sa√° returned to his home province to announce his own resignation to the Presidency after barely a week in office.  Designation of Eduardo Duhalde  Former President Eduardo Duhalde (2002‚Äì2003) Ram√≥n Puerta refused to take over as interim President again, resigning as President Pro-Tempore of the Senate. With no President, Vice President or President Pro-Tempore of the Senate, the Presidency of Argentina was placed in the hands of the next-in-line: Eduardo Cama√±o, who was the Speaker of the House of Deputies. Cama√±o was to take over until a new Legislative Assembly was convened. The Assembly convened on 1 January 2002, and debated extensively before designating Senator Eduardo Duhalde as President almost at midnight. Duhalde was one of the top leaders of the Peronist Party. However, many had thought that Duhalde's political career was ruined after his defeat in the 1999 presidential elections. In an ironic twist of events, Duhalde was called to complete the term of the man who beat him in the elections, Fernando de la R√∫a. This was not to be a provisional presidency, as Duhalde was designated to complete the interrupted term of De la R√∫a until the 2003 presidential elections. With regard to the economy Duhalde and his Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov decided on an even more extreme freezing of the bank deposits, which was then coupled with the so- called pesificaci√≥n (\\"peso-ification\\", a forced transformation of all dollar- denominated accounts into pesos at an arbitrary fixed exchange rate), and a regulated devaluation. The fixed exchange rate system was abandoned soon afterwards, which was followed by a large depreciation.  Social changes  During the unrest millions of people formed neighbourhood assemblies, occupied unused land and factories, created barter and mutual aid networks, implemented workers' self-management across hundreds of factories and rejected trade unionism and political parties. Around a third of the population participated in these creations and these efforts have been repeatedly praised by anarchists.

Clark worked for the American international brokerage firm Euro Brokers, which lost 61 employees that day, nearly one fifth of its New York branch. Clark was one of only 18 people in the South Tower to escape from a floor where the plane struck, escaping from his office on floor 84. No one escaped at or above the impact point in the North Tower. Clark's testimony before the 9/11 Commission, where he detailed problems with the 911 emergency call system, has been widely quoted. September 11, 2001 =First and second impacts= After the 1993 World Trade Center Bombing, Clark became a volunteer Fire Fighter for his floor and was issued a whistle, a reflective vest, and a flashlight by World Trade Center security. On September 11, 2001, when Clark saw a giant fireball in his peripheral vision, coming from the adjacent North Tower at 8:46 a.m., he quickly picked up his issued gear and began evacuation procedures for the staff on his floor of the South Tower. Clark went to his company's trading floor, which stood at the east side of his tower. When he arrived, he saw his co-workers peering out the windows, and heard them describe the sight of people jumping to their deaths from the adjacent tower. One of Clark's co- workers screamed as she witnessed this and turned away, overwhelmed by the horrific sight. She sought comfort in Clark's arms. He took her to the women's restroom so she could regain her composure. Clark would later credit this act with saving his own life, because it took him away from the east side of his building. At 9:03 a.m., United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the south side of his tower, only a few floors below the spot on the trading floor where Clark had been standing only moments before. =Rescue of Stanley Praimnath= After Flight 175 struck the South Tower, Clark and seven other employees of his floor who had survived the impact gathered together and started to descend Stairwell A. They only made it to the 81st floor when Clark and his group were met by a woman and a man coming up the stairs. The woman blocked their paths and warned them there were flames and smoke further down, and their only option was to try and go up to the roof in hope of being rescued from there. Clark and his coworkers stopped and debated on the stairwell landing about what to do next; whether to listen to the woman and go up the stairs or to ignore her warnings and go down the stairs. As the group stood there debating their next move, a faint scream for help coming from inside the 81st floor caught Clark's attention. While his group continued to debate what to do, Clark grabbed coworker Ron DiFrancesco and entered the 81st floor to look for the person screaming for help. As Clark and DiFrancesco entered the floor, Clark turned around to observe his coworkers as they started to go up the stairs to the roof instead of down. That group would all lose their lives that day, as access doors to the roof were locked, and there were no plans for helicopter rescues from the roof, as the NYPD deemed it too unsafe to attempt due to dense clouds of smoke and rooftop antennas. As Clark and DiFrancesco made their way to the voice screaming for help, DiFrancesco became overcome with smoke and returned to the stairs, which he would also ascend. Unlike the rest of his coworkers who went up the stairs, however, DiFrancesco reversed course and survived. Clark made his way to find Fuji Bank employee Stanley Praimnath, who was pinned underneath some debris behind a wall that had stood firm. Praimnath had initially evacuated the building after the first plane had hit the North Tower but was told to go back inside. Once he had arrived back at his office on the 81st floor, he was on the phone when he noticed the second plane coming right at him. He screamed and jumped under his desk as the plane was hitting the building. After the impact, Praimnath found himself alive under his desk with only minor injuries. When Clark found Praimnath, there was a wall standing between the two, and the only way for Praimnath to escape was to jump up and go over the wall. Praimnath was unsure he would be able to get over the wall but tried due to Clark's urging. Praimnath made several unsuccessful attempts to climb the wall, on one occasion injuring his hand, but he persisted, and on another attempt Clark was able to hook his arms around Praimnath and help pull him to the other side. =Descent= Clark and Praimnath's descent through the floors of the impact was impeded by some debris and smoke, but by moving the debris, they made it passable. All the internal walls were made of light metal framework holding up thick drywall panels. These panels were fractured by the initial impacts and explosions, and their twisting and shaking blocked fire doors and stairwells and then shattered to make much of the dust after the buildings collapsed. The airliner that struck the North Tower struck it perpendicular to the north face. The impact severed all the elevators and all three stairwells. The airliner that struck the South Tower struck at an angle, severing two stairwells, but it left Stairway A, the one they were using, more or less intact. A few floors below the impact, Clark and Praimnath encountered one of Clark's colleagues, Jos√© Marrero, ascending and using a walkie-talkie. Marrero had received a call from another of Clark's colleagues above, David Vera, saying his party needed help. Clark tried to convince his colleague not to ascend, but Marrero insisted on going higher to help Vera and the others. At the Skylobby on the 44th floor, Clark and Praimnath encountered a Port Authority employee who was tending to a severely injured tenant. The P.A. employee told them that all the phones were out on that floor. He asked them, when they had access to a working phone, to have someone send an EMT to care for this injured tenant. The phones were working in Oppenheimer's offices on the 31st floor. Clark was on the telephone for over three minutes and talked to three different people before his 911 call was understood. This call might have been the only chance for rescue workers to learn that there was a clear stairwell that the several hundred people trapped above the impact could try to use to escape. Clark described how he and Praimnath did not feel a sense of urgency, and before calling 911 they each made one brief personal call. At 9:55 am, they got to the ground floor where there were rescue workers. One advised them to run once they exited onto Liberty Street, at the southeast corner of the complex. At 9:56 am, Clark and Praimnath ran out of the World Trade Center complex. Clark described how, when they had gotten about two blocks away, Praimnath told him he thought the buildings were going to go down. Clark was skeptical, repeating how solidly built the towers were, but he did not finish his sentence before the South Tower (Tower Two) started to collapse. Clark and Praimnath had left the South Tower just four minutes before it collapsed; they were two of the last 25 people to exit the building; Clark was number 22. Only two other people exited the South Tower after Clark and Praimnath. =Aftermath= Praimnath thanked Clark for saving his life. Clark, in turn, also thanked Praimnath since he felt that the act of leaving his group and freeing Praimnath drew him out of a debate that might have ended with his joining the others who went up to their deaths. His Euro Brokers colleague, Ron DiFrancesco, who had initially turned around because of the smoke, mustered the strength to resume the descent and was the last person to escape the South Tower before its collapse; he awoke several days later in a hospital, suffering from extensive burns and a head laceration. They were among only four out of 18 people who managed to escape from in or above the impact zone in Tower 2. Richard Fern, a Euro Brokers IT manager, was the fourth. Sixty-one of Clark's co-workers were killed in the incident. Clark was later appointed by his company's management to be President of the Euro Brokers Relief Fund, created to help take financial care of the families of those who were lost. He retired in 2006, a year after Euro Brokers merged with another company. Since his retirement, he has been volunteering with various non-profit organisations, including serving on the board and as treasurer of the New Brunswick Theological Seminary in New Jersey.2014‚Äì15 NBTS Catalog ‚Äì New Brunswick Theological Seminary www.nbts.edu/wp- content/uploads/2016/01/2014-15-NBTS-Catalog-1.pdf In popular culture * Clark's and others' stories were told on the BBC docudrama 9/11: The Twin Towers (2006, a.k.a.

Other common names include plug pack, plug-in adapter, adapter block, domestic mains adapter, line power adapter, wall wart, power brick, and power adapter. Adapters for battery-powered equipment may be described as chargers or rechargers (see also battery charger). AC adapters are used with electrical devices that require power but do not contain internal components to derive the required voltage and power from mains power. The internal circuitry of an external power supply is very similar to the design that would be used for a built-in or internal supply. External power supplies are used both with equipment with no other source of power and with battery-powered equipment, where the supply, when plugged in, can sometimes charge the battery in addition to powering the equipment. Use of an external power supply allows portability of equipment powered either by mains or battery without the added bulk of internal power components, and makes it unnecessary to produce equipment for use only with a specified power source; the same device can be powered from 120 VAC or 230 VAC mains, vehicle or aircraft battery by using a different adapter. Another advantage of these designs can be increased safety; since the hazardous 120 or 240 volt mains power is transformed to a lower, safer voltage at the wall outlet and the appliance that is handled by the user is powered by this lower voltage. Modes of operation bridge rectifier, and an electrolytic capacitor to smooth the waveform Originally, most AC/DC adapters were linear power supplies, containing a transformer to convert the mains electricity voltage to a lower voltage, a rectifier to convert it to pulsating DC, and a filter to smooth the pulsating waveform to DC, with residual ripple variations small enough to leave the powered device unaffected. Size and weight of the device was largely determined by the transformer, which in turn was determined by the power output and mains frequency. Ratings over a few watts made the devices too large and heavy to be physically supported by a wall outlet. The output voltage of these adapters varied with load; for equipment requiring a more stable voltage, linear voltage regulator circuitry was added. Losses in the transformer and the linear regulator were considerable; efficiency was relatively low, and significant power dissipated as heat even when not driving a load. Early in the twenty-first century, switched-mode power supplies (SMPSs) became almost ubiquitous for this purpose. Mains voltage is rectified to a high direct voltage driving a switching circuit, which contains a transformer operating at a high frequency and outputs direct current at the desired voltage. The high-frequency ripple is more easily filtered out than mains-frequency. The high frequency allows the transformer to be small, which reduces its losses; and the switching regulator can be much more efficient than a linear regulator. The result is a much more efficient, smaller, and lighter device. Safety is ensured, as in the older linear circuit, because a transformer still provides galvanic isolation. A linear circuit must be designed for a specific, narrow range of input voltages (e.g., 220‚Äì240 VAC) and must use a transformer appropriate for the frequency (usually 50 or 60 Hz), but a switched-mode supply can work efficiently over a very wide range of voltages and frequencies; a single 100‚Äì240 VAC unit will handle almost any mains supply in the world. However, unless very carefully designed and using suitable components, switching adapters are more likely to fail than the older type, due in part to complex circuitry and the use of semiconductors. Unless designed well, these adapters may be easily damaged by overloads, even transient ones, which can come from lightning, brief mains overvoltage (sometimes caused by an incandescent light on the same power circuit failing), component degradation, etc. A very common mode of failure is due to the use of electrolytic capacitors whose equivalent series resistance (ESR) increases with age; switching regulators are very sensitive to high ESR (the older linear circuit also used electrolytic capacitors, but the effect of degradation is much less dramatic). Well-designed circuits pay attention to the ESR, ripple current rating, pulse operation, and temperature rating of capacitors.Article on capacitor ESR and its effects Many inexpensive switched- mode AC adapters do not implement adequate filtering and/or shielding for electromagnetic interference that they generate. The nature of these high speed, high-energy switching designs is such that when these preventative measures are not implemented, relatively high energy harmonics can be generated, and radiated, well into the radio portion of the spectrum. The amount of RF energy typically decreases with frequency; so, for instance, interference in the medium wave (US AM) broadcast band in the one megahertz region may be strong, while interference with the FM broadcast band around 100 megahertz may be considerably less. Distance is a factor; the closer the interference is to a radio receiver, the more intense it will be. Even WiFi reception in the gigahertz range can be degraded if the receiving antennae are very close to a radiating AC adapter. A determination of if interference is coming from a specific AC adaptor can be made simply by unplugging the suspect adapter while observing the amount of interference received in the problem radio band. In a modern household or business environment, there may be multiple AC adapters in use; in such a case, unplug them all, then plug them back in one by one until the culprit or culprits is found. Advantages External AC adapters are widely used to power small or portable electronic devices. The advantages include: * Safety ‚Äì External power adapters can free product designers from worrying about some safety issues. Much of this style of equipment uses only voltages low enough not to be a safety hazard internally, although the power supply must out of necessity use dangerous mains voltage. If an external power supply is used (usually via a power connector, often of coaxial type), the equipment need not be designed with concern for hazardous voltages inside the enclosure. This is particularly relevant for equipment with lightweight cases which may break and expose internal electrical parts. * Heat reduction ‚Äì Heat reduces reliability and longevity of electronic components, and can cause sensitive circuits to become inaccurate or malfunction. A separate power supply removes a source of heat from the apparatus. * Electrical noise reduction ‚Äì Because radiated electrical noise falls off with the square of the distance, it is to the manufacturer's advantage to convert potentially noisy AC line power or automotive power to \\"clean\\", filtered DC in an external adapter, at a safe distance from noise- sensitive circuitry. * Weight and size reduction ‚Äì Removing power components and the mains connection plug from equipment powered by rechargeable batteries reduces the weight and size which must be carried. * Ease of replacement ‚Äì Power supplies are more prone to failure than other circuitry due to their exposure to power spikes and their internal generation of waste heat. External power supplies can be replaced quickly by a user without the need to have the powered device repaired. AC adapter supporting four different AC plug systems * Configuration versatility ‚Äì Externally powered electronic products can be used with different power sources as needed (e.g. 120 VAC, 240 VAC, 12 VDC, or external battery pack), for convenient use in the field, or when traveling. * Simplified product inventory, distribution, and certification ‚Äì An electronic product that is sold and used internationally must be powered from a wide range of power sources, and must meet product safety regulations in many jurisdictions, usually requiring expensive certification by national or regional safety agencies such as Underwriters Laboratories or Technischer √úberwachungsverein. A single version of a device may be used in many markets, with the different power requirements met by different external power supplies, so that only one version of the device need be manufactured, stocked, and tested. If the design of the device is modified over time (a frequent occurrence), the power supply design itself need not be retested (and vice versa). *Constant voltage is produced by a specific type of adapter used for computers and laptops. These types of adapters are commonly known as eliminators. Problems detachable AC cord A survey of consumers showed widespread dissatisfaction with the cost, inconvenience, and wastefulness of the profusion of power adapters used by electronic devices. Science fiction author and satirist Douglas Adams wrote an essay bemoaning the profusion and confusion of power adapters, and calling for more standardization. Efficiency Millions of still-usable AC power adapters are thrown out annually, because of poor or unknown compatibility with new equipment. The issue of inefficiency of some power supplies has become well known, with U.S. president George W. Bush referring in 2001 to such devices as \\"Energy Vampires\\".Bush Takes Aim at \\"Wall Warts\\" Extreme Tech article Legislation is being enacted in the EU and a number of U.S. states, to reduce the level of energy wasted by some of these devices. Such initiatives include standby power and the One Watt Initiative. But others have argued that these inefficient devices are low-powered, e.g., devices that are used for small battery chargers, so even if they have a low efficiency, the amount of energy they waste is less than 1% of household consumption of electric energy. Considering the total efficiency of power supplies for small electronic equipment, the older mains-frequency linear transformer-based power supply was found in a 2002 report to have efficiencies from 20‚Äì75%, and have considerable energy loss even when powered up but not supplying power. Switched-mode power supplies (SMPSs) are much more efficient; a good design can be 80‚Äì90% efficient, and is also much smaller and lighter. In 2002 most external plug-in \\"wall wart\\" power adapters commonly used for low-power consumer electronics devices were of linear design, as well as supplies built into some equipment. External supplies are usually left plugged in even when not in use, and consume from a few watts to 35 watts of power in that state. The report concluded that about 32 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year, about 1% of total electrical energy consumption, could be saved in the United States by replacing all linear power supplies (average efficiency 40‚Äì50%) with advanced switching designs (efficiency 80‚Äì90%), by replacing older switching supplies (efficiencies of less than 70%) with advanced designs (efficiency of at least 80%), and by reducing standby consumption of supplies to not more than 1 watt.Calwell, Chris and Travis Reeder (2002), Power Supplies: A Hidden Opportunity for Energy Savings, Natural Resources Defense Council, pp. 4‚Äì9. Retrieved 2010-02-19. Since the report was published, SMPSs have indeed replaced linear supplies to a great extent, even in wall warts. The 2002 report estimated that 6% of electrical energy used in the U.S. \\"flows through\\" power supplies (not counting only the wall warts). The website where the report was published said in 2010 that despite the spread of SMPSs, \\"today's power supplies consume at least 2% of all U.S. electricity production. More efficient power supply designs could cut that usage in half\\".Efficiency of Power Supplies in the Active Mode Since wasted electrical energy is released as heat, an inefficient power supply is hot to the touch, as is one that wastes power without an electrical load. This waste heat is itself a problem in warm weather, since it may require additional air conditioning to prevent overheating, and even to remove the unwanted heat from large supplies. Universal power adapters A six-way connector on a \\"universal\\" DC power supply, consisting of a four-way X connector and two separate individual connectors (one is the nine-volt battery connector). The X-connector here provides 3.5 and 2.5 mm phone plugs and two sizes of coaxial power connector External power adapters can fail, and can become separated from the product they are intended to power. Consequently, there is a market for replacement adapters. The replacement must match input and output voltages, match or exceed current capability, and be fitted with a matching connector. Many electrical products are poorly labeled with information concerning the power supply they require, so it is prudent to record the specifications of the original power supply in advance, to ease replacement if the original is later lost. Careful labeling of power adapters can also reduce the likelihood of a mixup which could cause equipment damage. Some \\"universal\\" replacement power supplies allow output voltage and polarity to be switched to match a range of equipment.Computer Times: 2006 review of a satisfactory third-party universal AC adapter With the advent of switch-mode supplies, adapters which can work with any voltage from 110 VAC to 240 VAC became widely available; previously either 100‚Äì120 VAC or 200‚Äì240 VAC versions were used. Adapters which can also be used with motor vehicle and aircraft power (see EmPower) are available. Four-way X connectors or six-way star connectors, also known as spider connectors, with multiple plug sizes and types are common on generic power supplies. Other replacement power supplies have arrangements for changing the power connector, with four to nine different alternatives available when purchased in a set. RadioShack sells universal AC adapters of various capacities, branded as \\"Enercell Adaptaplug\\", and fitted with two-pin female sockets compatible with their Adaptaplug connector lineup. This allows many different configurations of AC adapters to be put together, without requiring soldering. Philmore and other competing brands offer similar AC adapters with interchangeable connectors. The label on a power supply may not be a reliable guide to the actual voltage it supplies under varying conditions. Many low- cost power supplies are \\"unregulated\\", in that their voltage can change considerably with load. If they are lightly loaded, they may put out much more than the nominal \\"name plate\\" voltage, which could damage the load. If they are heavily loaded, the output voltage may droop appreciably, in some cases well below the nominal label voltage even within the nominal rated current, causing the equipment being supplied to malfunction or be damaged. Supplies with linear (as against switched) regulators are heavy, bulky, and expensive. Modern switched-mode power supplies (SMPSs) are smaller, lighter, and more efficient. They put out a much more constant voltage than unregulated supplies as the input voltage and the load current vary. When introduced, their prices were high, but by the early 21st century the prices of switch-mode components had dropped to a degree which allowed even cheap supplies to use this technology, saving the cost of a larger and heavier mains-frequency transformer. =Auto-sensing adapters= Some universal adapters automatically set their output voltage and maximum current according to which of a range of interchangeable tips is fitted; tips are available to fit and supply appropriate power to many notebook computers and mobile devices. Different tips may use the same connector, but automatically supply different power; it is essential to use the right tip for the apparatus being powered, but no switch needs to be set correctly by the user. The advent of switch-mode power supplies has allowed adapters to work from any AC mains supply from 100 to 240 V with an appropriate plug; operation from standard 12 V DC vehicle and aircraft supplies can also be supported. With the appropriate adapter, accessories, and tips, a variety of equipment can be powered from almost any source of power. A \\"Green Plug\\" system has been proposed, based on USB technology, by which the consuming device would tell the external power supply what kind of power is needed.Green Plug tries to replace the worry warts Engadget May 2008 Use of USB Common sizes of USB AC adapters The USB connector (and voltage) has emerged as a de facto standard in low-power AC adapters for many portable devices. In addition to serial digital data exchange, the USB standard also provides , up to ( over USB 3.0). Numerous accessory gadgets (\\"USB decorations\\") were designed to connect to USB only for DC power and not for data interchange. The USB Implementers Forum in March, 2007 released the USB Battery Charging Specification which defines, \\"...limits as well as detection, control and reporting mechanisms to permit devices to draw current in excess of the USB 2.0 specification for charging ...\\". Electric fans, lamps, alarms, coffee warmers, battery chargers, and even toys have been designed to tap power from a USB connector. Plug-in adapters equipped with USB receptacles are widely available to convert or power or automotive power to USB power (see photo at right). The trend towards more- compact electronic devices has driven a shift towards the micro-USB and mini- USB connectors, which are electrically compatible in function to the original USB connector but physically smaller. In 2012, a USB Power Delivery Specification was proposed to standardize delivery of up to 100 watts, suitable for devices such as laptop computers that usually depend on proprietary adapters. Standards The ITU published Recommendation ITU-T L.1000, \\"Universal power adapter and charger solution for mobile terminals and other hand-held ICT devices\\", which specifies a charger similar in most respects to that of the GSMA/OMTP proposal and to the European Common external power supply. The ITU recommendation was expanded and updated in June, 2011. The hope is to markedly reduce the profusion of non-interchangeable power adapters. The European Union defined a Common external power supply for \\"hand- held data-enabled mobile phones\\" (smartphones) sold from 2010, intended to replace the many incompatible proprietary power supplies and eliminate waste by reducing the total number of supplies manufactured. Conformant supplies deliver 5 VDC via a micro-USB connector, with preferred input voltage handled ranging from 90 to 264 VAC. In 2006 Larry Page, a founder of Google, proposed a and up to standard for almost all equipment requiring an external converter, with new buildings fitted with wiring, making external AC-to-DC adapter circuitry unnecessary. IEC has created a standard for interchangeable laptop power supplies, IEC 62700 (full name \\"IEC Technical Specification 62700: DC Power supply for notebook computer\\"), which was published on February 6, 2014.

When Lombardy-Venetia was under Austrian rule, Peschiera was the northwest anchor of the four fortified towns constituting the Quadrilatero. The fortress is on an island in the river Mincio at its outlet from Lake Garda. The town is encircled by massive Venetian defensive systems that have been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 9 July 2017. History Roman Ardelica was a town of Gallia Transpadana that occupied the site of the modern Peschiera del Garda, at the southeast angle of the Lacus Benacus (Lago di Garda), just where the Mincius (modern Mincio) issued from the lake. The name is found under the corrupted form Ariolica in the Tabula Peutingeriana, which correctly places it between Brixia and Verona; the true form is preserved by inscriptions, of which one says that it was a trading place, with a corporation of ship-owners, collegium naviculariorum Ardelicensium. (Orell. Inscr. 4108.) The town is mentioned as Arilica in Pliny the Elder's Naturalis Historia. The fortress at Peschiera played a prominent part in most military campaigns conducted in northern Italy after 1400, especially during the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. At the Battle of Peschiera fought on 6 August 1796, the day after the major French victory at the Battle of Castiglione, a French force commanded by general Mass√©na drove out the Austrians. After the Siege of Peschiera, during the First Italian War of Independence, it was taken by the Piedmontese from the Austrians, following a gallant defence by general Rath lasting six weeks, on 30 May, 1848. Peschiera del Garda was also known for its military jail, which closed in 2002. The commune is part of the Associazione Citt√† del vino (\\"Association of Wine Cities\\").

Instead of rebooting the whole system, only subsets of fine- grain components are restarted. The granularity of components is typically finer than the process level (e.g., EJB-level in Java EE systems). The goal of confining the reboot to fine-grain components is threefold: to reduce the amount of time it takes for the system to return to service, to minimize the failure's disruption to the system and its users, and to preserve as much in- memory application data as possible. The concept was proposed in 2001 by George Candea and Armando Fox, while the former was a graduate student at Stanford University. It was initially reduced to practice in systems such as a satellite ground station control system and a Java EE application server; later on it formed the basis of the design of commercial systems like Aster Data Systems nCluster.

This form of torture was first described by Hippolytus De Marsiliis in Italy in the 15th or 16th century.  Origin The term \\"Chinese water torture\\" may have arisen from Chinese Water Torture Cell (a feat of escapology introduced in Berlin at Circus Busch on September 13, 1910). The escape entailed Harry Houdini being bound and suspended upside-down in a locked glass and steel cabinet full to overflowing with water, from which he escaped, together with the Fu Manchu stories of Sax Rohmer that were popular in the 1930s (in which Fu Manchu subjected his victims to various ingenious tortures, such as the wired jacket). Hippolytus de Marsiliis is credited with the invention of a form of water torture. Having observed how drops of water falling one by one on a stone gradually created a hollow, he applied the method to the human body. Other suggestions say that the term \\"Chinese water torture\\" was invented merely to grant the method a sense of ominous mystery. The victim would be stripped of their clothes, shown to the public, then tortured. They would be driven insane while bystanders watched, mocked, and laughed at them. Effectiveness There is very little evidence pertaining to the effectiveness of the method. The television series MythBusters investigated the effectiveness of Chinese water torture, and while it was found quite effective, they noted that the restraining equipment was providing most of the effect by itself, and when testing the dripping water alone on a relaxed, unrestrained subject, it was found almost negligible.Mythbusters, \\"Water Torture\\". Episode 25, Season 2. (2005) Nevertheless, in the Episode 3, Season 2 of the web television series Mind Field the MythBusters host Adam Savage said the following: \\"The creepiest thing that happened after we did this episode was that I got an email from someone from a throw away account. He said, 'We found that randomizing when the drops occurred was incredibly effective. That anything that happens on a regular periodicity can become a type of meditation, and you can then tune it out. If you couldn't predict it, he-said, 'We found, we were able to induce a psychotic break within 20 hours.'\\"Mind Field, \\"Interrogation - Mind Field S2 (Ep 3)\\". Episode 3, Season 2.

The battle was the culminating point of a naval campaign that lasted about five months in which the Chilean Navy had the sole mission of eliminating its Peruvian counterpart. In the struggle, two armored frigates, led by Commodore Galvarino Riveros and Navy Captain Juan Jos√© Latorre battered and later captured the Peruvian monitor Hu√°scar, under Rear Admiral Miguel Grau Seminario. After the loss of the frigate Independencia at Punta Gruesa, Grau sought to challenge the outnumbering Chilean fleet adopting a harassing strategy, focused in inflicting as much damage as possible while avoiding a full scale engagement. As Grau evolved along the Pacific coast, he was chased by Admiral John Williams Rebolledo, who had been ordered to catch Grau no matter what. His failure cost him his commission, and was replaced by Riveros. With a different strategy, Riveros managed to encircle Grau at Punta Angamos, about 80 kilometers north of Antofagasta. Falling in a trap set by Riveros and Latorre, Grau was forced to present battle after ordering the corvette Uni√≥n to escape to Per√∫. Latorre, aboard Almirante Cochrane, engaged first. Taking advantage of the powerful Armstrong-type batteries, Latorre shelled Hu√°scar for almost two hours, and Grau was killed in action. However, his flagship continued the fight while Riveros engaged her with the Blanco Encalada as well. After being battered for almost three hours, the Hu√°scar, unable to sustain combat, was boarded and captured and the battle ended. The result was a complete success for the Chilean Navy, and secured its dominant position for the rest of the war. It allowed to prepare the invasion of the Tarapac√° department, carried out on early November. Chilean Navy dominance off the Pacific coast contributed significantly to success in the following land campaigns across the Atacama Desert that ended with Lima's fall on January 1881. The Hu√°scar was repaired and served under the Chilean flag until its decommission, and now sits as a floating museum in the port of Talcahuano.  Background  After the naval battle of Iquique of 21 May, the Peruvian fleet lost the armored frigate Independencia to a wooden schooner, Covadonga. This obliged Rear Admiral Miguel Grau to renounce to attack and to adopt a harassing strategy, avoiding by all means a direct encounter with the bulk of the Chilean navy. Aboard the monitor Hu√°scar, Grau made several incursions into Chilean waters, successfully challenging the enemy's domination along the coast. Under his command, Hu√°scar sank or captured 14 transports, one of them carrying an entire cavalry regiment. This last setback was considered a humiliation by the Chilean public opinion, and sparked several protests against the government. Besides, the Commander of the Chilean fleet Juan Williams Rebolledo resigned on 5 August. His poor command left his ships incapable of sailing without important repairs. The Chileans lost almost a month restoring the vessels to combat condition again. Therefore, the newly appointed Commander of the Navy, Commodore Galvarino Riveros, couldn't sail until September. By 30 September, Riveros was notified that the corvette Uni√≥n was sailing to Panam√° to escort five small ships with torpedoes bought from the United States. The Chilean fleet sailed again on 1 October, now carrying War Minister Rafael Sotomayor. The preceding week, the government had ordered the fleet to hunt down the Hu√°scar at all cost.Cluny, pg. 227 In a council held aboard Riveros' flagship, the armored frigate Blanco Encalada, it was decided to set course to Arica, hoping to find Hu√°scar there. But, on 7 October, Riveros was informed that Grau had been sighted sailing north at Coquimbo, halfway between Arica and Valpara√≠so. Therefore, a new strategy was set up to capture the Peruvian monitor. Divided in two divisions, Riveros with the slower ships would move close to shore, while Latorre would sail about 35 km from shore with the faster ships. So, the fleet was divided as it follows: * 1st Division‚ÄîCommodore Galvarino Riveros. **Armored frigate Blanco Encalada: Commodore Galvarino Riveros **Wooden schooner Virgen de Covadonga: Lt. Captain Manuel Orella **Transport Matias Cousi√±o : Lt. Captain Augusto Castleton. * 2nd Division‚ÄîCommander Juan Jose Latorre **Armored frigate : Commander Juan Jose Latorre **Corvette O'Higgins : Lt. Captain Jorge Montt Alvarez **Transport Loa : Lt. Captain Javier Molinas Gacitua. = Chilean strategy = Naval Combat of Angamos by Thomas Somerscales On 1 October, Riveros gathered his officers and communicated the order of hunting down the Peruvian vessel at Arica. The same day, Grau in his flagship Hu√°scar ordered to sail along the coast as far south as Coquimbo, accompanied by the corvette Uni√≥n. Since the Chilean fleet sailed close to the shore and the Peruvians were farther out in the open sea, both formations didn't spot each other. At Mejillones, on 7 October, a plan was approved to deceive the Peruvian ships. Riveros' division would wait for Grau at Antofagasta while Latorre would set up an east-west barrier-like formation about from shore. If Riveros could spot Hu√°scar, he would follow and keep her from retreating to south until Latorre could engage. During the night the Peruvian warships were sailing off the Chilean coast to Arica, when they saw the lights of Antofagasta. Admiral Grau decided to engage any Chilean vessel at the port, intending to inflict some damage. At 01:10 h. on 8 October, Hu√°scar searched the bay without encountering any targets. She came up with Uni√≥n at 03:00 hrs, and both resumed their northward heading. At the same hour, lookouts on Blanco Encalada saw two smoke columns on the horizon. Simultaneously, Grau was informed that there were three smoke columns to north. Both enemies spotted each other and the Peruvian ships turned back south. Riveros ordered a speed reduction of his to make Grau think it was possible to turn back north and sail for Per√∫. At 05:40 h., both Peruvian ships began to slowly turn once again north. Then, Riveros increased the speed of Blanco Encalada to get closer to the Peruvians and to discourage Grau from turning back south. At 07:15 hrs, steaming northward, the two Peruvian vessels spotted smoke columns ahead; it was the incoming Latorre's division. Since the Peruvian Uni√≥n could manage 13 knots, she was able to sail northeastward and escape, but the Hu√°scar had to maintain course and fight. The Struggle Drawing of the Battle of Angamos Battle of Angamos Around 8:30 h, the gap between Hu√°scar and Blanco Encalada reduced to 3,000 meters, and after Latorre modified his route, Cochrane was closing in too.Cluny, pg. 229 Off Punta Angamos at 09:25 h. Grau opened fire over Cochrane, beginning the engagement. Latorre didn't answer, focused on approaching to Hu√°scar from its stern. About 15 minutes later, Cochrane retaliated from about 2,200 meters. Her three starboard cannons caused serious damage to the monitor right from the start. The very first shot pierced Hu√°scar's turret, wounding the twelve crew members manning the 300-pound cannons. Another shot perforated the armor just above the waterline, cutting the left rudder chain and leaving Hu√°scar temporarily adrift. Meanwhile, Cochrane sustained little damage.Cluny, pg. 230 Grau's flagship listed hard to starboard and was hampered also by a deformation in the hull acquired when she rammed Prat's Esmeralda at Iquique five months ago. However, barely ten minutes later an emergency rudder was set up by Hu√°scar's crew. At 10:00 h, a shot from Cochrane struck the bridge cabin, killing Admiral Grau and his adjutant, Diego Ferre.Meliton Carvajal's official report of the Battle of Angamos Command fell to Captain El√≠as Aguirre. By this time Hu√°scar's stern was on fire since at least two more shells penetrated from the rear and shattered the rudder wheel (Cluny, pg. 230), and the forecastle was devastated too. Lt. Captain Gaona's gunners caused heavy casualties among the Peruvian crew: the Chileans were using Palliser type armor-piercing rounds, which exploded right after penetrating the hull. At 10:10, the Hu√°scar's flag was brought down from its hoist by the intense gunfire. Latorre ordered a cease fire, thinking that the ship had surrendered. However, the monitor kept up its pace and within minutes an unidentified officer hoisted the flag again, resuming combat.La Guerra del Pac√≠fico en im√°genes, relatos, testimonios, p. 140 Meanwhile, the crew of the Huascar had again repaired the rudder wheel. At 10:22 hrs, Blanco Encalada arrived to the fray. A shot from 200 meters perforated the Huascar's turret, killing almost all of the sailors within and damaging the rightmost cannon. Another shot from Cochrane passed through the officers' quarters and wrecked the emergency rudder station, which had been disabled already twice before. The Hu√°scar now could sail only in a wide semicircle to starboard. Once rudder control was regained, Aguirre tried to ram the Cochrane.Cluny, pg. 231 Latorre was also maneuvering to ram the Hu√°scar, but the Peruvian ironclad suddenly veered to port and both ships passed by each other. Another projectile pierced Hu√°scar's turret 12 minutes later, killing everyone inside, including Captain Aguirre. Command of the ship went to Lt. Pedro Garezon, who in conference with the remaining officers decided to scuttle the ship rather than allow it to be captured. At 10:54 hrs the order was given to evacuate the wounded from the engine room and open the main condensator to scuttle the ship and to prevent its capture. At 10:55 hrs Hu√°scar's flag chain was caught (a second time) by the intense gunfire. The Chilean warships, noticing that the Hu√°scar was decreasing speed, mustered their boarding parties. At 11:08 hrs, 14 to 20 sailors boarded the Hu√°scar, without resistance. They closed the main condensator water leaks (with 1.2 meters of water in the engine room) and extinguished several fires while the prisoners were transported to the Chilean vessels. Acting commander Pedro Garezon pointed out to the Chilean officers that the flag was on deck together with the chain because they had all been cut off by the enemy shots, thus the flag was never brought down, nor had the ship been surrendered by the Peruvians. One of the Chilean officers observed that something similar happened to the Chilean ship Magallanes.  Consequences  In less than three hours, the Chilean navy eliminated the menace of the Peruvian fleet. With Hu√°scar's capture, plus the previous loss of Independencia at Punta Gruesa, the firepower of the Peruvian Navy was drastically reduced, and Chile incorporated the monitor in its fleet. The loss of both vessels, plus the death of Admiral Grau, Peruvians' best naval officer, gave the Chilean navy uncontested control of the Pacific coast of Peru bringing the naval campaign of the War of the Pacific to its end. The decisive victory at Angamos allowed the Chilean Army to freely pursue the plan to attack the Allies, and the land invasion of Peru and Bolivia began.

He led attacks against early settlers during a time of increasing strife between settlers and Native Americans. After making peace with the U.S. Government, he moved his people to their present reservation in Idaho and led the Shoshone during their struggle to survive following their deportation. The city of Pocatello is named in his honor. Biography Pocatello was born 1815. He was the leader at the time of the United States' arrival into Utah in the late 1840s. In the 1850s, he led a series of attacks against emigrant parties in the Utah Territory and along the Oregon Trail. He gained a reputation among Mormon leaders and Indian agents as a leader of a band of Native Americans. Brigham Young, the leader of the Mormons, attempted a policy of reconciliation and appeasement of the Shoshone, but the arrival of the United States Army in the Utah Territory in 1858 exacerbated tensions between the emigrants and the Shoshone. In January 1863, Pocatello received advance notice of the advance of U.S. Army troops from Fort Douglas under Colonel Patrick Edward Connor, who had set out to \\"chastise\\" the Shoshone. Pocatello was able to lead his people out of harm's way from the Army, thus avoiding the catastrophe of the Bear River Massacre. Pocatello sued for peace after pursuit from the Army. Pocatello agreed to cease his attacks on Oregon Trail emigrants and southeast Idaho settlers if the government would provide compensation for the game and land preempted by these intruders on the tribe's ancestral territory. With the Fort Bridger Treaty of 1868, the chief agreed to relocate his people to the Fort Hall Indian Reservation along the Snake River. Although the U.S. government had promised $5,000 in annual supplies, the relief rarely arrived, forcing continuing suffering and struggle among the Shoshone. In 1875, faced with starvation among his people, Pocatello led them to the Mormon missionary farm of George Hill in Corinne, Utah, with the hope that a mass conversion of his people to Mormonism would alleviate his people's suffering. Although the missionaries willingly baptized the Shoshone, the local population of white settlers did not receive the Shoshone openly and agitated for their expulsion. In response, the U.S. Army forced the Shoshone to return to the Fort Hall Reservation. In the late 1870s Pocatello granted a right-of-way to Jay Gould to extend the Utah and Northern Railway across the Fort Hall Indian Reservation. The extension of the railroad was motivated by the increasing flood of settlers into the Idaho Territory following the discovery of gold. The city of Pocatello, Idaho, founded along the railroad during this time, is named after him. After his death in 1884, Pocatello's body was interred in a deep spring in Idaho along with his clothing, guns, knives, and hunting equipment. Eighteen horses were also slaughtered and put into the spring on top of his body. Name In 1918, John E. Rees published a list of Idaho place names called Idaho Nomenclature. His derivation of Pokatello included po \\"road,\\" ka \\"not,\\" and tello \\"to follow,\\" and Rees offered the meaning \\"he does not follow the road,\\" referring to the chief's \\"stealthy habits and thieving raids.\\" An earlier reference to Pocataro occurred in 1859, when F. W. Lander, Superintendent of the U.S. Overland Wagon Road, met Chief Pocatello and arranged his release from U.S. Army custody. Linguist Sven Liljeblad believed that Lander's encounter with Chief Pocatello was the first reference to the name. Liljeblad refuted John Rees' syllabic derivation of the name, reasoning that Rees had simply connected unrelated Shoshoni roots. Liljeblad concluded that Pocatello was not even a Shoshoni word. Chief Pocatello's daughter, Jeanette Lewis, confirmed that the name had no meaning in the Shoshoni language, and that the chief referred to himself as Tondzaosha, meaning \\"buffalo robe.\\" In popular culture Pocatello appears in Sid Meier's Civilization V as the playable leader of the Shoshone Civilization.
