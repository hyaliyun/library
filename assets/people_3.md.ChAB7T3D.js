She married George Faithfull in 1917. and after his death she married, in 1943, the writer and critic Cuthbert Worsley. Evacuees Growing Cabbages (Art.IWM ART.LD 428) (1940) Faithfull studied at the Slade School of Art throughout 1923 and 1924, before going to Paris to study at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re. In 1933 she exhibited at the Salon des Artistes Francais in Paris. At the start of World War Two, Faithfull applied to work for the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC. Although not given a full-time commission by WAAC, she was given facilities and permits to work. She used these to produce paintings depicting evacuee children and, later, scenes of American servicemen playing baseball in a London park, and these pieces were purchased by WAAC. During the war, Faithfull also worked for a time as a surgical artist at the new plastic surgery unit at the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead under Sir Archibald McIndoe. At the end of the war, Faithfull produced a triptych depicting the crowds gathered around Buckingham Palace, celebrating on VE-Day.

Recorded for the duration of only one night as a live studio session at Real World Studios, Wiltshire, England in 1989, the album was one of the four albums released to establish Peter Gabriel's world music label Real World Records, and was one of the first recordings Rochereau created after exiling to France in 1988. Rochereau used the album as an opportunity to re-record highlights from the previous 20 years of his career. While the album is a soukous recording, described in its liner notes as \\"Zairean pop,\\" it also features elements from other genres, such as Latin music, jazz, rock and R&B;, as well as Congoloese dance rhythms such as madiaba and kwassa kwassa. The album also marked Rochereau's new preference for solo horns as opposed to ensemble horns. Upon release, the album received critical acclaim, with music critics acclaiming the album's vibrancy and experimentation. The recording was one of Rochereau's most successful albums and pathed the way for his later successful albums, including Muzina (1994) and Africa Worldwide (1996). Background and recording In 1988, prolific musician Tabu Ley Rochereau exiled to France to escape Mobutu Sese Seko's regime in his native Democratic Republic of the Congo. Rochereau was one of the key originators of soukous, which evolved from Congolese rumba in the 1960s; the genre was described in one review of Babeti Soukous as a \\"highly danceable modern African style\\" and a \\"Central African sound.\\" Meanwhile, English art rock musician Peter Gabriel was in the process of creating the world music record label Real World Records in collaboration with his arts festival organization WOMAD, founded in 1980 to celebrate different styles of music and dance around the world. To launch Real World Records, Rochereau, whose catalogue spans over 150 releases, agreed to record an album for the label with his band Afrisa International Orchestra, better known as Orchestre Afrisa L'International. Rochereau and the Afrisa International Orchestra had recently recorded the album Beyou Ciel Par Le Seigneur Ley Et L'Orchestre Afrisa International (1988) with singer Beyou Ciel for the Genidia label, the first album Rochereau worked on since moving to France. Babeti Soukous continues the collaboration between Rochereau and Ciel. Real World Studios in 1990. Babeti Soukous was recorded live in the main studio of Gabriel's Real World Records, Box, Wiltshire, on the night of 30 January 1989 in the attendance of friends and invitees, who danced and clapped in the studio's minstrel gallery. The decision to record the album in only one night was made to ensure that the album would capture \\"the heat of a Zairean cabaret.\\" The record label would later describe that night as Rochereau's \\"unforgettable party.\\" Rochereau's band set up during the afternoon, playing approximately 20 pieces throughout into the evening without break, achieving what Real World Records later referred to as their \\"intended blend of an authentic performed sound with the best of recording technology.\\" Several weeks after recording, Rochereau returned from Paris to Real World Studios to aid with the mixing of the album, where he adjusted the keyboard parts and solo lead guitar, leaving the rest of the mixing work engineer Dave Bottrill, \\"before heading for Chippenham railway station thoroughly satisfied with yet another smoothly professional piece of music-making.\\" Richard Chappell aided Bottrill as assistant engineer. As opposed to a producer's credit, Rochereau is credited with \\"directing\\" the album due to it being a live performance. Rochereau performs lead vocals on most tracks, although lead vocals on four tracks are performed by other singers, namely Beyou Ciel, Monoko Dodo and Faya Tess. A total of eighteen performers feature on the album, and two dancers, Apewayi Matshi and Onya Amisi, are also credited in the booklet, as is Lossikiya Maneno for \\"musical assistance.\\" Babeti Soukous was mastered at The Town Studios in West London. Music According to Phillip Sweeney in the album's liner notes, the tracks that Rochereau chose to record for Babeti Soukous comprise \\"a broad retrospective of Zairean pop of the previous 20 years,\\" and as such it has been described as a \\"live-in-the-studio best-of.\\" The music combines contemporary \\"guitar-and-snare rum numbers,\\" featuring fast, skipping rhythms and the dance-step calls of kwassa-kwassa, madiaba and tshuka, with the older style of rhumba-based soukous, which contains Latin- flavoured horn choruses and jazz-style saxophone solos that had lost popularity among many younger groups. The music is seasoned with elements from rock, R&B;, traditional Zairean rhythms and \\"French vari√©t√©.\\" Jazz Forum summed up the music on the album as \\"a sophisticated blend of local dance steps and outside influences\\" and made note of the Latin, jazz, R&B; and French elements. The Chicago Tribune echoed these sentiments, saying that while the album displays \\"a lively and fairly comprehensive overview\\" of the development of soukous music, the music does also tend towards the slower, original form of soukous that Tabu Ley is more readily associated with. Alec Foege of Spin found parallels to American funk music via the album's syncopated horn section, drum breaks and electric guitars. The percussion on the album rumbles atop the beat with precise, constantly shifting snare and cymbal patterns. The recording also displays felicities such as Rochereau's new focus on and preference for solo horns, as opposed to ensemble horns. His voice is high and caressing throughout, while also being \\"curious and questioning at times,\\" according to Folk Roots. Robert Christgau felt the album's \\"constituent parts\\" were its various guitar styles, dance beats, female vocal cameos and what he referred to as \\"the Smokey-styled ballad.\\" Release Released on 5 June 1989 in the United Kingdom, Babeti Soukous was one of the first four albums released to launch Real World Records, the others being Shanen Shah by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, La Explosion Del Momento! by Orquesta Reve and the various artists compilation Passion ‚Äì Sources, compiled by Gabriel. The Chicago Tribune felt that, among the three other launch albums, La Explosion Del Momento! was the most like Babeti Soukous, as both records hark back to a more traditional sound while also revealing contemporary ideas. The artwork was designed by Garry Mouat at Assorted Images, with Rani Charrington designing the composite image on the cover. Rather than credit himself as Tabu Ley Rochereau, Rochereau adopts the extended name of Tabu Ley Seigneur Rochereau, a respectful name given to him by his junior musicians. In the book Historical Dictionary of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, writer Emizet Francois Kisangani wrote that Babeti Soukous was one of several albums by Rochereau that found him success, alongside Exil Ley (1993), Muzina (1994) and Africa Worldwide (1996). Critical reception Babeti Soukous was released to critical acclaim; Q said that, \\"warm, tight, occasionally rollicking soukous that is about as good as a live set gets.\\" The New York Times were favourable, noting that \\"even when it was zooming along, Afrisa International's soukous had a light touch.\\" Folk Roots said: \\"This is delicious dance music of the most seductive kind - lots of rhumbas featuring Latin-inflected horn choruses and sexy sax solos.\\" In his Consumer's Guide, critic Robert Christgau rated the album \\"B+\\", saying that he initially found the \\"hectically eclectic\\" album hard to listen to, \\"but when I gave it a chance its constituent parts snuck up on me‚Äìthe procession of dance beats and guitar styles, the female vocal cameos, even the Smokey- styled/stolen ballad.\\" Option Magazine wrote that the album \\"virtually recaps\\" Rochereau's career. Chris Heim of the Chicago Tribune named Babeti Soukous the best of the four original Real World Records albums, and made note of the album's \\"excellent sound quality.\\" Retrospective reviews have also been favourable; AllMusic's John Storm Roberts called Babeti Soukous a \\"fine performance with touches probably never heard from Rochereau before,\\" and although finding the \\"DJ and 'live recording' conceit\\" to be unnecessary, he called the album \\"excellent\\". In the 1992 book World Beat: A Listener's Guide to Contemporary World Music on CD, writer Peter Spencer described Babeti Soukous as a \\"rewarding album.\\" Meanwhile, in the 1998 book The World Music CD Listeren's Guide, writer Howard J. Blumenthal called the album \\"a real crowd- pleaser.\\" Several music critics have compared Babeti Soukous to other recordings.

Overview The group released a manifesto on a Russian-registered website in which it decried \\"discrimination\\" against ethnic minorities in the region, and called for far greater autonomy in the Budjak region even while nominally rejecting separatism. Ukrainian authorities took swift action, with the SBU making two dozen arrests. This led one Ukrainian site to claim that the movement had been \\"smothered in its cradle\\". Party of Regions and Bulgarian minority leader in the Budjak, Anton Kisse, have been denying any connection to the movement and even rejected it. There have been some speculation that the organisation sought to ultimately create a \\"Bessarabian People's Republic\\" and link with separatists in Moldova's Gagauzia and Transnistria. However, the lack of a land connection between Budjak and the latter was crucial in the project's demise.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. It is one of the last remaining structures associated with the family of the Rev. Albertus C. Van Raalte, who founded Holland in 1847. (note: large pdf file) The house and surrounding property now forms the city of Holland's Van Raalte Farm Park. History In 1846, the Rev. Albertus C. Van Raalte led a group of 101 Dutch citizens to America to found a \\"colony\\" where they could practice their conservative brand of Dutch Reformed religion. In 1847, the immigrants settled in western Michigan, founding Holland. Benjamin Van Raalte, born in 1840, was Albertus van Raalte's third child. He traveled with his father to the United States in 1846. When he reached adulthood, he began farming the plot of land on this location, which had been conveyed to him by his father. Benjamin Van Raalte constructed the two barns still on the property in 1865. In 1867, Benjamin Van Raalte had this house constructed, located on a hill overlooking his land. After Van Raalte's death, his daughter Julia van Raalte and her husband, Orlando S. Reimold, lived in the house. Reimold was an author, and eventually became president and board chairman of the World Book Company. The Reimolds lived primarily in Chicago until Orlando's retirement in 1948, when they moved into this house. Following Julia's death in 1952, Orlando Reimold moved out, and the couple's children then used the house as a country retreat. In 1983 the Reimolds sold the house and the associated property to the city of Holland. In 1991-99, the city converted the property into a park, known as the Van Raalte Farm. Until 2003, the house was maintained by John and Judy Madison as caretakers. The City of Holland made improvements to the house in 2004, ant the DeGraaf Nature Center began using it for various purposes. Further rehabilitation of the house took place in 2016. On September 21st, 2019, the house was fully opened to the public for the first time during the cities annual Civil War muster. Description The Benjamin Van Raalte House is a two-story, rectangular Italian Villa house with clapboard siding sitting atop a hill. It has a low hipped roof with projecting eaves and a frieze underneath, encircling the house. Marrow pilasters are at the corners of the house. The front elevation contains an entrance on the left-hand side, with two windows on the right. On the second floor are three evenly spaced windows. Each window is a two-over-two double-hung style, with segmental-arch heads. A single-story hip-roof veranda extends across the front and wraps to one side. A single-story kitchen addition extends from one side at the rear. On the interior, the front section has a side hall and stair hall, off from which are a front parlor, a dining room, a pantry, and a modern kitchen. The upstairs contains several bedrooms. Furnishings in many of the rooms originally belonged to the Van Raalte family, the most notable of which is a secretary gowned by the Rev. Albertus Van Raalte. The kitchen addition now contains an apartment.

It was opened on 29 April 1991 as a single-track bridge and upgraded in 2000 with additional superstructure to support a second track and put into operation on 12 May 2000. The railway bridge consists of two parallel sections of welded superstructures of steel truss construction, both 292 metres long, resting on a common central pillar. The pillarless trusses have a system height of 12.00 metres and have a through truss in the longitudinal direction. As with the road bridge, the pier divides the bridge asymmetrically into two sections that are 117 metres and 175 metres long.  Earlier bridges = Pontoon bridge of 1840 = Today's bridges at Maxau are the fifth and sixth bridges to be built at this location since the first crossing of the Rhine in 1840. The first bridge over the Rhine near Maxau was opened on 25 August 1840 as a floating bridge for road traffic. It consisted of 34 hulls floating on the Rhine, supporting balks on which the road was mounted. It had a length of 276 m and a load capacity of 4 t. Individual balks could be withdrawn in order to allow the passage of ships and rafts. = Pontoon bridge of 1865 = The construction of the Maxau Railway (Maxaubahn) in 1862 made it necessary to erect a new bridge for the railway which connects the Maxau Railway between Karlsruhe and Maxau with a newly created branch of the Palatine Maximilian (Pf√§lzischen Maximiliansbahn) on the Winden‚ÄìW√∂rth‚ÄìMaximiliansau route. For the first time in Europe, this mixed railway and road bridge was constructed as a pontoon bridge. As a technical pioneer, it was awarded a gold medal in 1867 at the Paris International Exposition. The new bridge replaced the structure of 1840. Until the Germersheim Rhine Bridge took over the freight traffic in 1877, considerable quantities of the Saar coal crossed the Rhine here to reach southern Germany. This bridge had a total length of 363 m, of which 234 m was on the actual bridge and 129 m was on the two access ramps. It consisted of 34 pontoons, on which 12 balks supporting the railway were mounted. Six of the railway balks could be withdrawn for the passage of ships. The road was divided into two lanes by the central railway track. Depending on the water level of the Rhine, the height of the bridge varied at the crossing of the bank, which also changed the slope of the bridge: in low water, the bridge was lower than the shores, so that the trains on the bridge had a maximum incline of 3.5 % to climb; on the other hand, the bridge was higher than the shores at high water, so that a climb of a maximum of 3.3 % had to be overcome. The low load-bearing capacity of 101 t required the use of special, particularly light locomotives, Br√ºckenlokomotiven (bridge locomotives) with a 22 t service weight. Trains with a maximum of five wagons were hauled over the bank and across the Rhine by a bridge locomotive and returned to a normal locomotive on the other bank. Since the bridge locomotives only had limited power, problems could arise at times of low water if the bridge locomotive was unable to pull the train off the bridge over the steep incline to the bank. During the operation of trains over the bridge, it was closed for road traffic for about two hours. There were five continuous pairs of trains each day in the 1925 timetable. When there was ice on the Rhine, the pontoon bridge had to be dismantled for safety reasons and towed into the harbour. = Rhine bridge of 1938 = The technical and operational inadequacies of the pontoon bridge ‚Äì disruption of shipping, low carrying capacity and costly operation ‚Äì led to the construction of the first fixed bridge at Maxau in the 1930s. The inauguration of the new bridge was celebrated on 17 January 1938 (road bridge) and on 3 April 1938 (rail bridge). The bridge had a central pillar, the structure was divided into two spans that were 175 m and 117 m long. It had two superstructures in steel truss construction: one superstructure, which accommodated the two-track railway line, and one superstructure for the road. The new Rhine bridge was damaged in 1945 at the end of the Second World War during an air raid. On 21 March 1945, an American artillery grenade hit a detonator and thereby triggered the demolition of the bridge prepared by German troops (see Operation Undertone). = Rhine bridge of 1947 = After the destruction of the bridge of 1938, several short-term temporary structures were built in Maxau, initially in the form of a pontoon bridge built by the French armed forces for road traffic. This was replaced after a short time by another pontoon bridge, which was laid somewhat further upstream. In 1946, a low wooden bridge was added for the railway, which linked the two shores at the location of the old pontoon bridge of 1865. However, it could not be passed by shipping on the Rhine. These provisional bridges remained in operation until the 1947 bridge was put into operation. As a long-term replacement for the bridge destroyed in 1945, a new bridge was built south of the 1938 site at the end of the war. It was built on four electric pylons, which were supported by a large number of steel pipes which had been driven into the ground. Steel superstructures built on trusses carried a railway track and the roadway. After the construction of the new road bridge of 1966, the deck of the roadway was dismantled and only the deck of the railway remained until 1991. There were five spans between the four pylons of the bridge, each with a passage for river traffic to pass up and down. The very narrow width of the spans soon became an obstacle to navigation. So on 9 June 1987, there was a major shipwreck in which the pier of one of the bridges was rammed; a vessel sank. In order for the vessel to be recovered and the bridge to be tested for stability, the railway traffic on the bridge and navigation on the Rhine had to be interrupted for several weeks.  New plans There had been plans for the construction of a second road bridge across the Rhine near Maxau for several years. The increasing traffic is one reason, but there is also the expected need to rehabilitate the cable-stayed bridge built in 1966, which requires the closure of the bridge in the longer-term. Therefore, the refurbishment is expected to require the prior construction of a second Rhine bridge. In the spatial planning procedure, which was completed in June 2006, option I, which is a few kilometres north of the existing bridge site, was considered as well as option II in the immediate vicinity of the existing bridge. The decision of the Struktur- und Genehmigungsdirektion S√ºd (\\"Structure and authorisation directorate south\\", a regional body of Rhineland Palatinate) in Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe favoured a modified option I: the link to B 9 in the west would partly run over the route of today's district route 25 (W√∂rther Hafenstra√üe). A small forest area would be crossed on low pillars, in order to maintain existing animal migrations paths and biotopes. The approach on the Palatine side is problematic in both options because of the dense settlement next to the Rhine: The approach to option II would be a viaduct through the residential area of Maximiliansau. There were two proposals from the Landesbetrieb Mobilit√§t Rheinland-Pfalz (Rhineland- Palatinate state authority for mobility) for the connection from option I to the west and one produced by a citizens initiative. There was also controversy in relation to the planned Karlsruhe north tangent road as well as the connection to the existing south tangent road. On 26 April 2011, the plans were submitted for the planning approval process. and The Karlsruhe town council decided by majority to issue a negative opinion on the planning on 24 May 2011. An alliance of around 30 nature conservation associations and citizens' associations from Karlsruhe and the South Palatinate rejected the planning and identified more than 100 serious shortcomings and demanded improvements. An action plan called Per Ersatzbr√ºcke Maxau (\\"by replacement bridge Maxau\\"), on the other hand, called for replacing the old bridge with a new bridge. In order to clarify open questions and to resolve information deficits, the two new state governments agreed to carry out a fact check on 18 and 22 November 2011 in Karlsruhe and to the subsequent establishment of a working group called Leistungsf√§hige Rheinquerung (\\"Efficient Rhine crossing\\"), which ended in November 2012. Results of both exercises were published on the Internet. The discussions were held in the Rhineland- Palatinate planning approval process on 3 and 4 July 2013 in W√∂rth and for the Baden-W√ºrttemberg planning approval process in Karlsruhe on 9, 10 and 11 July 2013. The city of Karlsruhe and the nature conservation associations criticised the numerous deficiencies in nature conservation, problems of capacity and traffic safety on the Baden side, problems for bicycle traffic, inadequate variation of weightings in the assessment system and the division into two procedures with inadequate overall consideration of the traffic and nature conservation issues. This advocacy led to the separation of, on the one hand, the study of traffic issues on the Palatinate side and increased capacity and improved road safety from, on the other hand, security against the failure of the Rhine crossing in the case of road or shipping accidents. One day before the discussion, Federal Minister of Transport Peter Ramsauer visited the bridge and described it as \\"the worst bottleneck in Germany\\". The states of Baden-W√ºrttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate have approved the construction of a second Rhine bridge designated as B 293. Baden-W√ºrttemberg has also designated a replacement bridge on the route of the B 10 for the Bundesverkehrswegeplan (federal transport plan). An investigation carried out by the Landesbetrieb Mobilit√§t Speyer at the request of the government of Baden-W√ºrttemberg showed that a new bridge between the old road bridge and the railway bridge was not possible. Moreover, this option was subject to natural environmental conditions on the Baden-W√ºrttemberg side. The Federal Court of Audit has found the project to be neither necessary nor economic, because the traffic problem it seeks to resolve is the result of a bottleneck in Karlsruhe not at the Rhine bridge.

He was raised in lower-middle-class family. From an early age, Baruah was more interested in drawing and painting than becoming a student of art.  Career  He was appointed as the drawing teacher at Panbazaar Girls H. E. School, Guwahati. He started an art school within the school. He struggled to make it a fully-fledged art school, given the lack of organized state effort to support such activities. Subsequently, Baruah started a photographic business. In 1947, Baruah reopened the Art school in a single room in Don Bosco School at Paanbazar. In 1948, his art school began to receive a recurring grant of Rs. 50.00 per month from the State Government. In 1959, the school's grant was increased to Rs. 300.00 which it shared with Lalit Kala Academy in Lakhtokia. Baruah was the sectretary of the state Lalit Kala Academy. Art classes were continued in two of the first floor's three rooms. After Baruah's demise Lalit Kala Academy separated from the school of art and moved to Santipur into a rented house ghag became known as Government College of Arts and Crafts Assam. The Government College of Art and Crafts was there until 2005. Later it was moved to its own land and building in Basistha. In 1958, it held its first National exhibition in Delhi.

As vassals of the Crown the Bissetts became landlords in the 13th century, followed by the Fraser family. In 1351 Sir William Keith, Great Marischal of Scotland, took ownership, followed by the Earls of Huntly, and then Clan Farquharson of Invercauld. The silk mercer Sir James McKenzie purchased it as a sporting estate in 1863. This estate was formally incorporated into the Balmoral estate by George VI between 1947 and 1951.

Here a single-storey stalker's cottage was built in 1851 for Charles Duncan, employed as an estate gillie, and his wife.

They visited the nearby hunting lodge called Allt-na-giubhsaich near the foot of Loch Muick and in August next year they stayed overnight at this lodge ‚Äì in the meantime it had been extended and improved although Victoria still regarded it as our \\"little bothie\\". By the time they stayed at the lodge the following year John Brown had become one of the queen's attendants ‚Äì he was one of a team of four servants who rowed her party to the head of the loch. On 30 August 1849 she wrote about the location \\"The scenery is beautiful here, so wild and grand ‚Äì real severe Highland scenery, with trees in the hollow. We had various scrambles in and out of the boat and along the shore, and saw three hawks, and caught seventy trout. I wish an artist could have been there to sketch the scene; it was picturesque ‚Äì the boat, the net, and the people in their kilts in the water, and on the shore.\\" George Washington Wilson's photo of the new Glassalt, about 1870 As for the smaller and more primitive shiel, newly built for Duncan, Victoria had fallen in love with the cottage and its setting ‚Äì at the time on the Abergeldie estate which was leased by Victoria and Albert. Around 1859 Victoria arranged for the Duncans to move to the foot of Glen Muick to live at Rhebreck leaving the shiel unoccupied. By 1868 the old two- room building had been demolished, to be replaced by the present fifteen-room dressed granite residence of twin gables and bow windows looking over Loch Muick. Between 1866 and 1869 stables and a keeper's cottage and offices were added to the rear and cellars were constructed. A slipway for boats was built about 1870, between twin jetties. It is now a category B listed building owned personally by Elizabeth II. Background to Victoria's rebuilding of Glassalt Queen Victoria, only twenty-one years old and newly married to Prince Albert, visited Scotland in 1842. Except for a brief visit by George IV in 1822 this was the first royal visit since the reign of Charles I. She sailed to Edinburgh and then visited Perth, Taymouth and Stirling. Both Victoria and Albert rather quickly came to love the country and the people living there. When she departed she wrote in her diary that it had been a holiday she would never forget. Old Balmoral Castle Held back by the births of their children, they next visited in 1844 when they stayed at Blair Castle and then again in 1847 when they cruised along the Scottish west coast and spent three weeks at Ardverikie where the weather was exceptionally wet. The couple decided to buy a property in Scotland so they could visit regularly and, on account of Albert's rheumatism, were advised by the royal doctor, Sir James Clark to consider Deeside where the climate is drier. Lord Aberdeen suggested Balmoral Castle, near Ballater where an unexpired lease was available. After only seeing sketches of the estate they agreed to take over the lease. Red deer stag near Glas-allt-Shiel In September 1848 they travelled by sea to Aberdeen and when they arrived at Balmoral they immediately knew they had taken the right decision. Victoria wrote in her diary \\"All seemed to breath freedom and peace, and to make one forget the world and its sad turmoils\\". Victoria could visit the local tenants and crofters who she found were not overawed by royalty. Back in England the couple planned to purchase the estate and build a larger castle adjacent to the existing one. Albert, with deer stalking in mind, started negotiating to purchase the neighbouring estates of Abergeldie, to the east and Ballochbuie to the west. He was immediately successful in purchasing Birkhall up into the hills around Loch Muick and by 1849 was able to obtain a long-term lease on Abergeldie which has been continually renewed up to the present. Balmoral Castle, designed but not started to be built, sketch by Victoria, 1852 It was only in 1852 that the purchase of Balmoral was agreed ‚Äì 30,000 guineas for the 17,400 acres ( for ) and the plans for the new castle could commence. In this Victoria was helped by a bequest of ¬£250,000 from an eccentric barrister, John Camden Neild, who himself had been living in poverty. The purchase of the estate was made in Albert's name, however, to establish clearly that it was personal property and not that of the Crown. Albert had been introduced to deer stalking at Taymouth back in 1840 when he was rather fortunate in successfully shooting a stag and he took up this new pastime finding that the area around Loch Muick on the estate was a good location. They had rebuilt the shooting lodge of Allt-na-giubhsaich at the foot of Loch Muick and, although Victoria did not go hunting, she liked visiting there to relax away from visiting dignitaries and to do painting. Albert died of typhoid in 1861 and this was a bitter blow for Victoria. She visited Balmoral for solace but all the time she was reminded of Albert. She could escape the world at Allt-na- guibhsaich but could not bear living there because of its earlier happy associations. However, there was another lodge at the head of the loch, a smaller one, and she decided to get this extended to convert it into a \\"widow's house\\". Glassalt in Victoria's journals =Journals= Of Victoria's journals, 111 volumes survive that were transcribed (and expurgated) by her daughter Beatrice and are accessible online. In her lifetime Victoria published two books containing small selections of entries: Leaves from the Journal of our Life in the Highlands (1868) dedicated to her late husband, covering 1848 to 1861 and More Leaves from the Journal ... (1884) dealing with the years after Albert's death ‚Äì 1862 to 1882. In the second volume Victoria was in doubly deep mourning ‚Äì she dedicated this volume to \\"my loyal Highlanders and especially to the memory of my devoted personal attendant John Brown\\", who had died a few months earlier. After transcription her original manuscripts were destroyed on her instructions but a few drafts in her handwriting remain ‚Äì the one of 22 September 1855 mentions Glassalt and an image is available online. (Glassalt is mentioned five lines up from the foot of the first page), modern transcription at =Gillie's cottage= In 1851 Victoria wrote from Glas-allt-Shiel: \\"Here I am, writing in our little lovely hut. ... We rowed up to the head of the Lake & landed at the foot of the Glassalt, where a charming little lodge has been built for Duncan (now one of our Keepers), & there is a little room for us. It is nearly finished. A lovelier, milder, or more romantic spot cannot be imagined. Albert says it is quite a spot for the 'Lady of the Lake' to dwell in.\\" Dubh Loch In the entry for 16 September 1852 in Victoria's Leaves from the Journal she describes pony riding and walking from Allt-na-giubhsaich to above the loch and then descending Glas Allt past the waterfall and stopping at Glas-allt-Shiel for a packed lunch in a \\"charming room ... [with] ... a most lovely view\\". In September 1859 the Duncans moved house from Glassalt to Rhebreck and a few days later Victoria records that her son the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) stayed the night at Glassalt where a bed had been prepared for him. =Rebuilt lodge= Victoria's 12 Oct 1867 sketch of Loch Muick from Glas- allt-Shiel In October 1868, with the rebuilding of the lodge largely complete: \\"Reached the Glassalt Sheil at half past 6. It looked so cheerful & comfortable, all lit up & the little rooms are so cosy & nice. The Dining room is on the one side of the little entrance hall, my sitting room, on the other & my bedroom &c; ‚Äì beyond. In it stands the old bed & wardrobe in our former little bedroom at Alt na Guithasach. Upstairs the rooms are equally comfortable. Felt sad & lonely, thinking of the blessed happy past with dearest Albert, who always had wished to build here, in this favourite spot. I could not have lived again at Alt na Guithasach now, alone, & it is far better to have built a totally new house, but the sad thought struck me, that it was the first widow's house, ‚Äì not blessed by him.\\" With five of her children and her Lady of the Bedchamber Jane Spencer, Baroness Churchill, Victoria held a house warming party and then they stayed for the night. During her Highland sojourns Victoria visited Glas-allt-Shiel every year up to and including 1900. She and her ladies often took lunch on the grass outside and sketched, while Albert and the men went deer stalking. Rain and midges could, however, force them indoors. The gillies often were able to catch large numbers of trout from the loch which made for fine meals, and dances were held with servants and gillies joining in. There was a piano that Victoria liked to play, particularly playing duets with her youngest daughter Beatrice. Victoria's sketch of the view from her Glas-allt-Shiel sitting room window, 20 October 1876 On 3 October 1870: \\"Louise had gone with Janie, E., the Lord Chancellor, & Lord Lorne to Loch Muich & the Glassalt. They returned some time after I got home, & Louise came to speak to me & tell me, that while walking up to the Dhu Loch, Lord Lorne had told her of his feelings for her & had in fact proposed to her, & Knowing that I would approve & liked him, she had accepted him. I embraced her & gave her my blessing, but felt greatly agitated. I was not unprepared but did not expect it would come so quick. Of course nothing can be said till Lorne has heard from his Parents.\\" Falls of Glas Allt In 1874: \\"Another, if possible, still more beautiful day, after a slight frost. ‚Äî After writing started at 11 with Beatrice to try & walk up to the falls of the Glassalt, which I had not done since 20 years! There was not a breath of wind & a very powerful sun. I managed to get up & was wonderfully little out of breath. Brown helped me up the steepest parts, which are rather trying. The falls were not particularly full, but always very fine. I walked up to the very top, just above, them, & rested a little on the heather. The descent was far easier, but the path was very rough in parts & I had recourse to Brown's strong arm to steady me. It is 4 miles to the top & back, & I felt quite proud, that I could accomplish it so well. ‚Äî In the afternoon drove with Beatrice & Janie E. nearly as far as Birkhall & back, taking our tea at the Linn of Muich. A splendid frosty evening.\\" Likewise in 1877: \\"Walked with Beatrice up to the top of the Glassalt falls, where the icicles where hanging from the stones, & rocks. It was a hard pull up, but we came down quickly.\\" In time Victoria was happiest living at her remote lodge, writing from Balmoral in 1873 \\"Felt quite lost in my big sitting room, after the snug little one at the Glassalt.\\" In 1874 again from Glassalt: \\"Working, reading & writing, after coming home. Dinner as usual, then Beatrice played on the piano. Cannot bear the thought of going away & not returning for another year!\\", and in 1877: \\"We left with regret the dear little Glassalt Shiel at half past 12. The house at Balmoral felt so cold & large, after the snug warm Shiel.\\" After the death of John Brown in 1883 Victoria was not able to face living in the shiel though she still often visited it. However, in 1887 Victoria found a new companion, Abdul Karim, the Munshi, and by 1889 she was again able to stay at the cottage, with him as her attendant, despite wide disapproval. Her last visit to Glassalt before her death turned out to be on 13 September 1900: \\"Drove in the afternoon with Ir√®ne & May to the Glassalt, where we met the rest of the family, some of whom had been up Lochnagar, & we had tea together. It was a beautiful evening but became rather chilly ...\\" Open bothy Glas Allt in the foreground with the lodge behind. The bothy is reached down the passageway between the rear of the lodge and the outhouse (right).Since 1991 an outhouse at the back of the lodge was maintained by Dundee University Rucksack Club as an open bothy until in 2019 it passed to the Mountain Bothies Association‚Äì it is a good base for climbing Lochnagar. Equipped with a stove and a composting toilet (as well as a candelabra) it used to be a storeroom and is now available to anyone free of charge for overnight stays. However, there is no electricity, the water supply is from the Glas Allt very near by, and there is no fuel unless it has been left by previous users. When royal parties are visiting the lodge backpackers are still allowed to stay in the bothy but they are asked to keep discreetly out of the way.

In 1687 John Monro was ‚Äòbooked as servant in order to be prenticed‚Äô to William Borthwick, the first connection the Monro family had with surgery. Properties Borthwick owned the Pilmuir estate in East Lothian. His country home, Pilmuir House, was built in 1627. Some 300 years later it was bought by Sir Henry Wade who left it in Trust to the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. In addition to his property at Pilmuir, Borthwick owned a stone house in Edinburgh which had a dining room, \\"four bedchambers a dark closet and a kitchen\\", which had cost 6600 merks Scots (¬£330 sterling). Family and death After finishing his apprenticeship he married Marionn Brothwick, eldest daughter of his surgical master, on 12 June 1666 at Edinburgh.

Legacy Borthwick was the first Edinburgh surgeon to bring an international perspective to the Incorporation of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Having studied at Padua and Leyden, he encouraged one of his apprentices, John Monro to study in Leyden. Monro returned to Scotland, inspired and determined to set up a medical school in Edinburgh based on the Leiden model.

Detail of the Knyffs' drawing. Wanstead Hall was the manor house for the Manor of Wanstead, now in the London Borough of Redbridge but historically in the county of Essex. It was later demolished to make way for the construction of Wanstead House. History =Tudor = Welbeck portrait of Elizabeth I by Gheeraerts, c. 1580, said to show Wanstead Hall in the background. It was probably quite a small building until the 14th century, but by 1499 it was large enough to serve as a royal hunting-lodge, when it was acquired by King Henry VII, one of whose favourite resorts it was to become. Henry had developed a taste for privacy towards the end of his reign, and acquired Wanstead as a maison de retraite in the vicinity of Greenwich Palace, laying out considerable sums on it. It was valued by him especially for its park, bringing the King much needed seclusion. Henry VII used Wanstead as a location for receiving payments from what the Tudor historian David Starkey calls his \\"slush fund\\" of extra-parliamentary taxation and fines, away from the eyes of the magnates in the formal royal palaces. The young future Henry VIII lived for a while at Wanstead and at the other maison de retraite of Hanworth Manor in enforced proximity to his father Henry VII during the last years of his reign. Both kings hunted within the manor. It was during Henry VIII's reign (1509‚Äì1547) that Wanstead Park was inclosed, shortly before 1512, which probably involved the clearance of some wooded areas. At about this time neighbouring Aldersbrook became a separate manor. Wanstead remained a Royal manor for a number of years, its \\"keeper\\" being an office awarded to favoured royal courtiers, one after another. Hugh Denys (d.1511) Groom of the Stool to Henry VII was its keeper until 1511, being one of the King's key financial officers who often received the \\"slush fund\\" monies there on the King's behalf. On Denys's death in 1511 the keepership passed to Charles Brandon, later Duke of Suffolk and from 1515 Henry's brother-in-law via marriage to his sister Mary Tudor.; cf L&P; H VIII, I, p.340,cf.iii,p.479: appointment of Charles Brandon in succession to Hugh Denys Sir John Heron, another former financial officer within the Privy chamber, was keeper of the park until his death in 1521. Heron also held lands in Aldersbrook and it is said that he brought heron birds to the area, as an amusing mark of his presence. One of the lakes was historically known as \\"Herony (sic) Lake\\". (A heronry, i.e. colony of heron birds, is shown on Lincoln Island on a 1919 OS map of Wanstead Park, unless this is merely a confusion over the nomenclature of the lakes.) Lord Richard Rich, High Chancellor of England, was keeper of the park in 1543, and in 1549 Edward VI granted him the lordship of the manor of Wanstead, complete with the park. In 1577 Rich's son Robert sold it to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, who purchased the nearby manor of Stonhall in Ilford at the same time. Thereafter a succession of owners kept the manor of Wanstead combined with Stonehall. =Jacobean Wanstead= The appearance of the gardens in an image by Jan Kip and Leonard Knyff, c. 1708. In 1619 Sir Henry Mildmay was in possession, but forfeited the manor to the Crown at the end of the Civil War, in which he had fought for Parliament. Charles II granted the estate to his brother, James, Duke of York, but it was restored in about 1662 to Sir Robert Brooke, Mildmay's son in law. In 1673-4 the manor was purchased by Josiah Child, Governor of the East India Company. He spent much time and money in developing the estate according to the fashion of the time and was created 1st Baronet Child of Wanstead in 1678. When John Evelyn, the diarist, visited Wanstead in March 1683 he wrote: \\"I went to see Sir Josiah Child's prodigious cost in planting walnut trees about his seate, and making fish ponds many miles in circuit in Epping Forest, in a barren place.\\" The ponds mentioned by Evelyn still exist, though somewhat altered, forming a chain of ponds descending from the Shoulder of Mutton Pond, through Heronry Pond, Perch Pond, the Dell and into the Ornamental Waters.

Biography Shinnyo's father was a poor scholar named Sh≈çen. Sh≈çen had written a Buddhist commentary titled Rokuch≈ç no meimoku, which was the only thing of any value he possessed; after his death, Shinnyo and her sisters were able to make a living by charging scholars to view his work. The proceeds allowed Shinnyo sufficient leisure time to study Buddhism, and she became well-educated in Buddhist doctrine, composing a number of commentaries and studying under the monk Ze- Amidabutsu. In 1243, the priest S≈çji submitted a petition to his uncle Eison, the founder of the Shingon Risshu sect, requesting that the Ch≈´g≈´-ji temple be revived as a nunnery; Eison chose Shinnyo to head this project. The following year, Shinnyo decided to seek full ordination as a nun, an honour that had not been granted for several hundred years. She approached Eison's associate Kakuj≈ç requesting ordination, but was initially refused. Kakuj≈ç stated that he would only accept her request if he received a sign from Heaven, which he experienced shortly after his refusal. He therefore contacted Shinnyo and by 1249 had bestowed upon her the full precepts of a Buddhist nun (bhikkhuni). Around 1262 Shinnyo moved to Ch≈´g≈´-ji to begin the restoration work. Her initial efforts focused on the restoration of the Tenjukoku Sh≈´ch≈ç Mandala, a large embroidered artwork commemorating Prince Sh≈çtoku. Shinnyo's interest in the work stemmed from her researches into Sh≈çtoku's mother, , the patroness of Ch≈´g≈´-ji, whose date of death was included in the mandala; it was Shinnyo's intention to hold a commemorative ceremony honouring Hashihito. After obtaining the mandala, Shinnyo took it on a fund-raising tour, and by 1282 had raised enough money to create a replica of the mandala and to fund the ceremony for Hashihito. During this time, she became moderately well known at the Imperial Court, and made patrons of many highly ranked ladies of the nobility. In 1282 Shinnyo recorded her biography in a work known as the Ama Shinnyo ganmon (\\"Vows of Shinnyo\\"); this work emphasises the importance of her actions in the restoration of Ch≈´g≈´-ji, and downplays the contributions of Eison and S≈çji.

To this the hypothesis adds that great mountain massifs are leveled towards the equilibrium line altitude (ELA), which would act as a ‚Äúclimatic base level‚Äù. Starting from the hypothesis it has been predicted that local climate restricts the maximum height that mountain massifs can attain by effect of uplifting tectonic forces. It follows that as local climate is cooler at higher latitudes the highest mountains are lower there compared to the tropics where glaciation is and has been more limited. The mechanism behind the glacial buzzsaw effect would be the erosion of small glaciers that are mostly unable to erode much below the equilibrium line altitude since they do not reach these altitudes because of increased ablation. Instead, large valley glaciers may easily surpass the equilibrium line altitude and do therefore not contribute to a glacial buzzsaw effect. This is said to be the case of the Patagonian ice fields where lack of buzzsaw effect results in rapid tectonic uplift rates. Mountains massifs proposed to be subject to glacial buzzaw effect include mountains of southeast Alaska, the Teton Range of Wyoming and the Dauphin√© Alps of France. Some authors like Egholm and co-workers have claimed that the glacial buzzsaw effect can explain mountain altitudes across the globe. Some of the mountain massifs experiencing the highest uplift rates are those for which glacial buzzsaw effects are discarded. The concept has been criticized as measured erosion rates in the Pyrenees does not indicate a general drive towards certain level. In the case of Norway the elevated paleic surface has been proposed to have been shaped by a glacial buzzsaw effect. However this proposal is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the paleic surface consist of a series of steps at different levels. Further glacial cirques, that in the buzzsaw hypothesis contribute to belevel the landscape, are not associated to any paleosurface levels of the composite paleic surface, nor does the modern ELA or the Last Glacial Maximum ELA match any given level of the paleic surface. The elevated plains of West Greenland are also unrelated to any glacial buzzsaw effect.

During early 1942, as an acting Air Commodore, Wilson was part of the short-lived Allied supreme command for South East Asia and the South West Pacific, the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM). Afterwards, he was attached to the Royal Air Force (RAF) in North West Europe, and spent more than a year as a prisoner of war (POW) in Nazi Germany.  Early life & career  Wilson was the son of Ellen and Henry E. Wilson.FamilySearch, 2014, \\"\\"Australia, Sydney Branch Genealogical Library, Cemetery Inscriptions, 1800‚Äì1960\\" (18 May 2017). Wilson was born on 1 December 1898 at Lithgow, New South Wales. RAAF service record, 1923‚Äì46Registry of Births, Deaths & Marriages (NSW), Wilson, Douglas E L, no. 4276/1899. Wilson grew up at Lithgow. Shortly after graduating from Sydney Boys High School in 1916, Wilson passed the examination for entrance to the Australian Army college, Duntroon. He entered the college the following year and remained there until 1920, when he was seconded to the British Army. In the UK, Wilson underwent training with the Royal Garrison Artillery. Transferring to the RAAF when it was established in 1923, Wilson was a member of the first group to graduate from No. 1 Flying Training School. Others who graduated at the same time and later became prominent in military or civil aviation, included Joe Hewitt, Frank Bladin, and Lester Brain. As a member of this pioneering class, Wilson carried the distinctive two-digit service number 16 (sometimes A16), throughout his career. He later attended RAF Staff College, in England. By early 1939, Wilson had been appointed commanding officer (CO) of No. 6 Squadron RAAF which was using Avro Ansons for maritime patrols and joint exercises with the Royal Australian Navy. World War II \\"ABDA Area\\" in January‚ÄìFebruary 1942. In theory, RAAF North-Western Area became part of an Allied sub-command that also covered the eastern Dutch East Indies. =The Pacific = Wilson commanded RAAF stations and held staff positions in Australia for the first few years of the war. After the crash at Canberra in 1940 of an RAAF Lockheed Hudson, which killed 10 people, including three members of Cabinet and the army's Chief of General Staff (General Sir Brudenell White), Wilson was appointed technical assistant to Arthur Dean, counsel assisting the Air Court of Inquiry that followed. In late 1941, Wilson ‚Äì with the rank of acting Air Commodore ‚Äì was appointed commander of the newly formed North-West Area (NWA), which was headquartered at RAAF Darwin. On 20 January 1942, the Australian government transferred operational control of NWA to ABDACOM:Douglas Gillison, 1962, Second World War Official Histories Volume I ‚Äì Royal Australian Air Force, 1939‚Äì1942. Canberra: Australian War Memorial, pp. 301‚Äì3. an ambitious, but short-lived and shambolic supreme command, encompassing Allied forces throughout South East Asia and the South West Pacific. An ABDACOM subcommand, AUSGROUP (or sometimes \\"Darwin Command\\") was to control Allied military aviation in NWA, part of Western Area (including Onslow), the Molucca Sea and Dutch New Guinea.General Staff, India, 1942, \\"ABDACOM\\" an official account of events in the South-West Pacific Command, January‚ÄìFebruary 1942, New Delhi, Government of India, p.6, and; Louis Morton, 1962, United States Army in World War II The War in the Pacific Strategy and Command: The First Two Years, Washington D. C., Center for Military History, p. 169. Led by General Sir Archibald Wavell (British Army), the headquarters of ABDACOM was at Bandung (Bandoeng), in Java. Wilson's immediate superior was the commander of Allied air forces (ABDAIR), Air Marshal Sir Richard Peirse (RAF). Observing that any concentration of military aviation facilities, aircraft and personnel, at a relatively small airfield, made it vulnerable and attractive to enemy attack, Wilson began to consider dispersal and decentralisation. Following reports, on 27 January, that the formidable Japanese combined carrier fleet had entered the Flores Sea, Wilson ordered the dispersal of assets at RAAF Darwin. Repair and maintenance equipment and staff were moved to Daly Waters, almost further south.Timothy Hall, 2015, Darwin 1942, Australia Darkest Hour, Abingdon, UK/New York, Routledge, p. 108. However, when Wilson also ordered the transfer of obsolete aircraft (five CAC Wirraway armed trainers belonging to No. 12 Squadron RAAF) to Daly Waters, he was overruled by the Deputy Chief of Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock. (Three of the Wirraways were damaged and written-off following the first air raid on Darwin ‚Äì see below.) At around the same time, Wilson ordered the arrest of a civilian suspected of signalling enemy vessels using an improvised signal lamp, from a location near RAAF Darwin.Hall, Darwin 1942, Australia Darkest Hour, pp. 113‚Äì4. During early February, NWA was inspected by Air Commodore George Jones (soon to be appointed Chief of the Air Staff), who reported deficiencies in morale and aircraft serviceability amongst its combat units: 2, 12 and 13 squadrons.Peter Helson, 2010, The Private Air Marshal. Canberra: Air Power Development Centre, p. 145. On 19 February, while Wilson was attending to ABDACOM duties in Java, Darwin suffered a massive air raid. The Allies suffered significant losses: at least 236 civilians and military personnel were killed, 11 vessels were sunk in Darwin Harbour and 31 aircraft were destroyed. The only fighter aircraft present, a squadron of P-40E Warhawks of the United States Army Air Force, were overwhelmed and/or destroyed on the ground. By the end of March Allied resistance in the Dutch East Indies had collapsed by the end of March, and ABDA was dissolved, along with its sub-commands. Criticised regarding their preparations for and responses to the first air raids, Wilson, his deputy, Group Captain Frederick Scherger, and the station commander of RAAF Darwin, Wing Commander Sturt Griffith, were posted out of NWA. =Europe= Wilson was attached on exchange to the RAF in January 1943 and posted as a Group Captain to the UK, where he served as Officer Commanding at three RAF Bomber Command stations in rapid succession: RAF Wyton, RAF Linton-on-Ouse, and RAF Holme-on-Spalding Moor. During this period, Bomber Command was involved in a pivotal strategic bombing campaign against the Ruhr, where German war industries were concentrated. These targets were heavily defended and Allied losses were considerable. As a result, Wilson's instructions to aircrews under his command attracted the antipathy of some of them. For example, one pilot, Flight Lieutenant Ron Read (RAF), commented that :Wilson was a dry humourless Australian, who had ... had no [direct] experience ... in operations. What made him very unpopular was his attitude in his first couple of briefings, telling us, most all veterans of many ops, how we should press on ... and not be slow to attack the heavy Ruhr targets, which we were doing two or three times a week in some cases.Martin W. Bowman, 2006, Flying Into the Flames of Hell: Dramatic First Hand Accounts of British and Commonwealth Airmen in RAF Bomber Command in WW2. Barnsley UK; Pen & Sword, p. 192. According to Read, senior aircrew suggested to Wilson that perhaps he should fly on an operation himself, believing that afterwards he might not be \\"so critical\\" or \\"we slyly thought ... might go for the chop himself [i.e. be shot down].\\" Wilson flew operationally, for the first and only time, on the night of 22/23 June 1943. He was officially, second pilot of a Handley Page Halifax Mk V, DK224 (squadron code \\"MP-Q\\"), from 76 Sqn RAF, captained by Pilot Officer James Carrie (RAF). DK224 was the last bomber to reach and bomb a target at M√ºlheim, Germany that night.Alan W. Cooper, 2013, Air Battle of the Ruhr: RAF Offensive March ‚Äì July 1943, Barnsley UK; Pen & Sword, p. 361. On the return leg, at about 0158 hours, the bomber came under attack over the Netherlands, by Luftwaffe night-fighter ace, Oberleutnant Werner Baake of 1./NJG1.J. Alwyn Phillips, 1992, The Valley of the Shadow of Death: an account of the Royal Air Force Bomber Command night bombing and mine laying operations including \\"The Battle of the Ruhr\\" March 5th/6th to July 18th/19, 1943, New Malden, UK; Air Research Publications, p. 438. After the Halifax was severely damaged by Baake and the controls became unresponsive, Carrie ordered the crew to bale out. The flight engineer, Sgt Richard Huke (RAF), was killed by a parachute malfunction; the other members landed safely, close to Zuylen Castle. While several crew members were captured soon afterwards, Wilson, Carrie and wireless operator Sgt Elliott McVitie (RAF) made contact with a Dutch resistance \\"escape line\\" known as Luctor et Emergo (later Fiat Libertas), which had been organised to smuggle Allied aircrews out of occupied Europe.WWII Netherlands Escape Lines, 2015, Luctolar et Emergo/Fiat Libertas (26 May 2017).Ligne Com√®te Line ‚Äì Remembrance, n.d., fiche C135 (26 May 2017). They travelled undercover into Belgium, where they were handed over to the better-known \\"Comet line\\". However, during the first week of August, Wilson, Carrie and McVitie were apprehended in Paris, by either the Gestapo or GFP. and became prisoners of war (POW). At Stalag Luft III (SLIII), near Sagan, Silesia (now ≈ªaga≈Ñ, Poland), Wilson reportedly assisted in a successful escape, which one of the escapees, Flight Lieutenant Eric Williams (RAF), later recounted in a book that became a popular film adaptation:The Wooden Horse (1950). The even more famous \\"Great Escape\\" of March 1944, which took place in another compound at SLIII, did not involve Wilson. However, he succeeded Gp Capt. Herbert Massey as the Senior British Officer (SBO) at SLIII soon afterwards. On 17 April 1944, Wilson surreptitiously passed to an official visitor from the Swiss Red Cross a list, compiled by other POWs, giving the names of 47 Allied personnel whom POWs believed had been murdered following the Great Escape by the Gestapo.Simon Read, Human Game: Hunting the Great Escape Murderers, London, Constable & Robinson, p. 21 It was later established that 50 Allied POWs were shot on the personal orders of Adolf Hitler. (Wilson would later gave statements to war crimes prosecutors regarding these and other events.) After the camp was liberated, two former POWs who had been convicted of collaborating with German authorities made similar accusations against Wilson. He was not charged after the British Judge Advocate General found that no offence had been committed.Oliver Clutton-Brock, 2003, Footprints on the Sands of Time: RAF Bomber Command Prisoners-of-War in Germany 1939‚Äì1945, London, Grub Street Publishing, pp. 181, 504. Post-war In October 1945, after returning to Australia, Wilson was appointed commander of Western Area RAAF in Perth. He tendered his resignation from the RAAF on 1 February 1946 and was placed on the Retired List on 20 March. In 1949, Wilson was awarded the Czechoslovakian V√°leƒçn√Ω k≈ô√≠≈æ 1939‚Äì1945 (\\"War Cross 1939‚Äì1945\\"; sometimes referred to as the \\"Czechoslovakian Military Cross\\"),Supplement to the London Gazette of Friday, 7th October, 1949 (19 May 2017). for interceding on behalf of Free Czechoslovakian POWs at Stalag Luft III. He retired to a property at Glen Alvie, near Ebor in northern New South Wales. Wilson died, following an illness, at Concord Hospital, Sydney on 2 August 1950. Wilson was buried near his parents, in the Anglican section of Lithgow cemetery. Footnotes References * Wilson Douglas Ernest Lancelot (RAAF service record, 1923‚Äì46), series no.

The story begins a year before the events in the anime. Reception =Previews= The anime series' first episode garnered mixed reviews from Anime News Network's staff during the Winter 2018 season previews. Chris Farris solely reviewed the English dub version of the episode, criticizing the constant padding through \\"sparse backgrounds and needlessly overused CGI shortcuts\\" and poor explanation of the \\"overwrought terminology\\" about Toji but commended the performances from the various voice actresses. He concluded that despite the dub, the series might have difficulty to compel viewers over time. James Beckett found the introduction \\"rote and lacking-identity\\" throughout to garner viewer interest, noting how the premise and characters are filled with clich√©s and the production \\"middling at best\\" with its generic character designs, hollow backgrounds, and CG fight scenes feeling \\"stiff and blandly directed to be much fun.\\" Lynzee Loveridge repeated what both Farris and Beckett said about the episode's delivery of its religious terminology and sword fights, saying she found it \\"pretty boring for what's supposed to be a supernatural action show.\\" Rebecca Silverman said the series has potential when the episode moves away from its \\"cute young girls fight monsters\\" premise to focus on introducing its cast of characters and buildup some internal conflict towards the end of its runtime. Nick Creamer gave note of the \\"internal narrative choices\\" used throughout for raising the show's arbitrary setup, praising the establishment of the world and Kanami and Mai's characters in a tournament setting, but felt it was hampered by weak attempts at building atmosphere through \\"abominable background art\\" and action scenes being undercut by poor CG. He concluded that its \\"just short of passable - worth a look if this is your genre, otherwise a guiltless skip.\\" Theron Martin wrote that after watching the series opener twice, he said that a more thorough elaboration would've helped ease viewers into its world and terminology much better despite \\"solid visual merits\\" and the promise of \\"immediate internal conflict and intrigue\\" to help infuse life into a standard concept. =Series reception= Martin reviewed the complete anime series. He praised the camaraderie amongst its main cast for carrying dramatic weight and interest between the \\"solid action scenes\\" but was critical of the unexplored story elements in a complexly savvy but standard plot, quality control of its animation, and unremarkable soundtrack, concluding that \\"Overall, Katana Maidens is a watchable but uninspired series beyond a few featured sword fights. While many parts of its story underachieve, it does at least finish on its strongest note, so those unimpressed by earlier parts but committed to finishing will have something to look forward to.\\" Gadget Ts≈´shin listed \\"Horizon Alliance\\" in their 2019 anime buzzwords list.

He is also Benedictine monk and priest of the Roman Catholic Church in Edo state Nigeria. He founded Nigeria‚Äôs first Alternative medicine and research laboratory enterprise in Nigeria known as Pax Herbal Clinic and Research Laboratories in 1997. He started the herbal enterprise as a little herbal clinic venture in Ewu Monastery meant to offer herbal remedy to common ailments like cough and malaria to nearby villagers. Successes with treated patients meant information about the nascent herbal clinic at the monastery quickly spread to surrounding towns and beyond in a short space of time. Adodo joined the Ewu Monastery in 1987 where he continues to live, pray, work, and study as a monk and an Alternative Medicine practitioner. As a writer, he has written several books on Alternative Medicine, Nutrition and Health, and Epidemiology. Early life and career Adodo was born in his family home to a Yoruba family in Akure, Ondo state of Nigeria. His father Adebayo Adodo (1936 - 1988) is from the Oba-Ile axis of Akure, a prominent academician and wealthy entrepreneur owned one of the biggest frozen fish warehouse in Akure in the 1970s. His mother Mary Omodun Adodo (n√©e Falodun) (born 1939) is from the Falodun royal family in Akure known for their vast cocoa plantations. =Family and Personal Life= Adodo is the third of five children of his parents. Bankole Adodo, Funke Adodo, Anselm Adodo, Bandele (Dele) Adodo, and Omotola (Tola) Adodo are all siblings of same parents. Adebayo Adodo was the son of Adesida, a prominent Akure businessman. Mrs Mary Adodo (n√©e Falodun) is the daughter Peter falodun. =Education and Monastic Journey= In 1979, Adodo joined the St. Thomas Aquinas College Akure to begin his secondary school education. By the year 1985, he had successfully completed his secondary school education and was awarded a West African school certificate. When he visited Ewu Monastery in 1987, it was the peace and tranquility of the natural environment that really struck him. Finally, in November 1987, he abandoned his university admission in order to join the monastery. As a monk of Ewu Monastery, he obtained a Higher Diploma in Scholastic Philosophy from Ewu Monastery studium of Philosophy in 1992. Thereafter, Adodo went on to the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, in Enugu State Nigeria, to further his academic career and it was there he studied till 1995 before he was award a Bachelor of Art in Religious Studies. His next academic effort was with Duquesne University, Pennsylvania, USA starting in 1995 until 1997 where he was awarded a master's degree Systematic Theology. Also, from 2015 he studied at University of Benin (Nigeria) which earned him a Ph.D in Medical Sociology by 2017. Da vinci Institute, South Africa also awarded him a Ph.D (Management of Technology and Innovation systems) 2015 for his doctoral studies which he started in 2012. He is an adjunct professor at Institute of African Studies (IAS), University of Ibadan, Nigeria (where he teaches African Transformation Studies and Traditional African Medicine) and is also Chief Executive Officer at Paxherbals and director of Ofure (Pax) Integral Research and Development Initiative. Alternative Medicine =Philosophy= Adodo prefers the term \\"African Medicine\\" to \\"Traditional Medicine\\". He defines African medicine as a system of healing grounded in an African world view, culture, and accumulated beliefs and practices, which proffers solutions to physical and spiritual ailments through the use of herbs and other plants. African medicine, he believes, is founded on indigenous, biological, and medico-spiritual theories and concept of the human body; the role of the individual as a member of the community; and their relationship with the community, with the environment and with nature. =Background= In the early 1990s, Adodo undertook his first study on how people survive based on what they have: indigenous knowledge. Traveling around Nigeria at the time, he was amazed by what he observed. He saw native traditional healers and how they struggled but also how they healed and cured people. Adodo said, he felt called to preserved their knowledge. They were not documenting their knowledge and what they know was too valuable to lose. He made a commitment to start documenting herbal remedies. Adodo said he explained to the traditional healers he encountered that this was the only way their knowledge would survive. The time had come to move indigenous knowledge from implicit knowledge, passed from one generation to the next orally, to explicit knowledge that was documented and shared more widely. That in doing so, more people could build on it. Indigenous medicinal knowledge has a unique place in healing and well-being.

The business was founded in 2006, and had sales in 2019 of ¬£856.9m. It specialises in own brand fashion clothing, with over 36,000 products. The firm's shares lost 46 per cent of their value by mid-July 2020 after Sunday Times allegations about a supplier's failure to protect workers in Leicester. History Boohoo was founded in 2006 by Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane, who respectively serve as group executive chairman and an executive director and previously supplied high street chains such as Primark and New Look. Boohoo's core products include dresses and tops, with a selection of over 27,000 styles of clothing. Boohoo has been criticised for promoting fast-fashion which critics claim comes at a cost to those making the clothes and the environment. More than half of Boohoo's garments are produced in the UK, especially Leicester, London, and Manchester. Boohoo buys 75%‚Äì80% of the clothing produced in Leicester. This was made possible when other retailers such as ASOS reduced the amount they sourced from Leicester over concerns about working conditions. In 2017, Channel 4 documentary Dispatches found that factories in Leicester supplying Boohoo (along with New Look, River Island, and Missguided) were paying workers less than the minimum wage. Boohoo stated that the work had been subcontracted without their knowledge. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Boohoo reported an increase in sales. In late June, workers' rights group Labour Behind the Label produced a report that stated factories supplying Boohoo were not following to social distancing and forcing employees to work even if sick, claims that Boohoo denied. This was followed by an investigative report by The Sunday Times which claimed to have found that workers producing clothes for BooHoo were paid ¬£3.50 an hour, less than half the UK minimum wage for over 25s. Business operations According to Chief executive Carol Kane, Boohoo can differentiate itself from its closest rivals, as all their clothing ranges are own-branded with average prices of ¬£17 comprising 9000 clothing lines. With a primary focus on the 16‚Äì24 year old age group, it sells clothing to over 100 countries and had seven major markets, including the UK, the US, and France. Stock is purchased in small quantities of between 300‚Äì500 items at a time, with repeat orders typically of 25% on those that sell well. Customers can order items up to midnight for next-day delivery, including on Sunday. Customer numbers increased by 29% throughout 2016-17, up to 5.8 million. As an online retailer, Boohoo utilise social media as an integral part of their marketing strategy. A social media manager was appointed in 2012, with all employees encouraged to assist the social media team by contributing messages and imagery. boohoo had 6m Instagram followers, 1.1m Twitter followers and 2.9m likes on facebook. Corporate affairs Boohoo also owns boohooMAN, PrettyLittleThing, Nasty Gal and MissPap, all targeted at 16‚Äì24 year olds. PrettyLittleThing was acquired in December 2016, with the retailer purchasing a 66% stake in the business at a cost of ¬£3.3m, with the existing management team retaining the remaining shares. During the year up to April 2017, customer browsing from mobile devices accounted for 70% of total sessions, an increase of 4% from the previous year, with downloads of its mobile app across the United Kingdom, United States and Australia totalling around 2.2 million. =Financial performance= In the 10 months to December 2013, Boohoo had sales totalling ¬£92m, with a profit before charges of ¬£10m. By February 2014, total sales had reached ¬£110m, with profits of ¬£11m. Turnover in the year to February 2015 was ¬£139.9m, an increase of 27% from the previous year, with an increase of gross profit by 31% to ¬£85m. In April 2017, Boohoo announced that its profits had almost doubled to ¬£31 million on sales up 51% to almost ¬£300 million. When the company was floated on the stock market in 2014, it was valued at ¬£560m, and is worth about ¬£2 billion Internationally, the retailer suggests its 140% growth to revenue of almost ¬£40m has exceeded expectation, whilst growth in Europe was 44% and 42% for the rest of their international operations. Strong performance was reported in April 2018, when Boohoo announced almost double revenue from the previous year, up to ¬£580 million, a pre-tax profit of ¬£43.3 million and a 22 percent increase in customers. Boohoo has continued to experience strong performance with the last four-month period for 2019 experiencing a 44% jump in revenue to ¬£328.2m. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic Boohoo was reported to have turned a greater profit than in the previous fiscal year. Euronews Living reported at the time that \\"Boohoo has managed to capitalise on cosy clothing when its customers need comfort above all else.\\" In June 2020, Boohoo announced that it was to acquire the brand and websites of high street chains Oasis and Warehouse for ¬£5.25m, as it revealed a 45% increase in first quarter revenue.  Criticism  In July 2020 Boohoo was accused of sourcing their garments from Leicester's manufacturers who pay less than the minimum wage. Labour Behind the Label also accused Boohoo of sourcing garments from factories that did not protect staff from Covid-19 as well as general poor working conditions at their UK suppliers. Meanwhile, Standard Life Aberdeen, the big asset manager and a top 10 shareholder in the group, announced that it had sold most of its stake in the company a few days after the Sunday Times revelations. SLA said that after engaging with Boohoo's management team a number of times during the week, it found the online retailer's response to the allegations was \\"inadequate in scope, timeliness and gravity\\". On 15 July 2020 a British MP said that it was 'shameful' that it took a pandemic for Boohoo to finally be taken to task for its workplace practices. Philip Dunne, chairman of the environmental audit committee, also said that the company had not met a pledge to sign up to the Ethical Trading Initiative which brings together retailers, unions and campaign groups to improve practice in supply chains.

The last note identified which mentioned the couple comes from 1911 and refers to a common religious enterprise, see La Correspondencia de Espa√±a 23.04.11, available here Dolores‚Äô personal life is vaguely described as \\"larga serie de calamidades\\". The last of these calamities was the premature 1936 death of Carolina; Dolores passed away two months after her daughter.

Writer La roca del amor Gort√°zar wrote poetic pieces throughout all of her life. They are scattered across various periodicals from the 1890s to the 1930s, sometimes featured on front pages;El D√≠a 03.11.04, available here the only majorin 1931 she wrote collection of poems, titled Collar de flores, which remained unpublished, El Imparcial 10.12.31, available here volume she published was Nimias (1898).a collection of her 25 early poems. It is available online on Biblioteca Digital Hispanica service, available here. In 1929 Gort√°zar published also a single lengthy poem, Novena al Santo Cristo de Lego (32 pp), El Cruzado Espa√±ol 13.12.29, available here Her poetry keeps revolving around Christian virtues, advantages of family life, beauty of Spain and patriotic values; fairly conventional if not banal in terms of style, in terms of content it advances the praise of traditional orthodoxy, even if at times flavored with some melancholy. One more literary genre she followed was drama; she is known to have written two one-act comediesMargarita (1890) and En el buen retiro (1909) featuring \\"tipos y costumbres leonesas\\", played in Le√≥nLa Tradici√≥n 16.06.00, available here, El Pueblo 10.06.09, available here. Some scholars claim they were inspired by Zorilla and Campoamor, Ochoa Fuertes 1997, p. 8 and perhaps also in Madrid.Noticiero Salmantino 06.02.00, available here In terms of public and scholarly recognition Gort√°zar was first noticed as a translator; her Spanish El arte po√©tica (1901) version of Horace's Ars po√´ticain the prologue she noted that it was death of her father and husband which inspired her, Casado 1995, p. 5 won awards at the Le√≥n Juegos FloralesLa Tradici√≥n 16.06.00, available here, La Correspondencia de Valencia 13.03.25, available here and was acknowledged with praise by Real Academia Espa√±ola.ABC 17.02.23, available here. Some sources claimed the translation was allegedly rewarded by the Royal Academy, compare Mujeres espa√±olas 22.12.29, available here, or Ochoa Fuertes 1997, p. 8; in fact, it was only acknowledged in its bulletin She tried her hand in historiography, especially in paleography; entrusted with specific tasks by Real Academia de la Historia,La Correspondencia de Valencia 13.03.25, available here she published two studies on San Miguel de Escalada (1899)San Miguel de Escalada. Nuevos monumentos y documentos, [in:] Bolet√≠n de la Real Academia de Historia XXXIII (1889) and the Valvanera monastery (1907).El monasterio de Valvanera. Indices de su Becerro y Archivio √° mediados del siglo XVII, [in:] Bolet√≠n de la Real Academ√≠a de la Historia LI (1907) Other historiographic works were a mid-size biographical study on St. Frances of Rome (1911)Dolores Gort√°zar, Francisca Romana Vida de Santa Francisca Romana, viuda de Ponciano, Madrid 1911 and a piece on Incarnation (1902).Dolores Gort√°zar, El mistero de la Encarnaci√≥n del Hijo de Dios, Madrid 1902 El Correo Espa√±ol In literature Gort√°zar obtained her biggest success as a novelist, the author of El Cristo de la roca (1911) and La roca del amor (1924).both novels are available online on Biblioteca Digital Hisp√°nica service, available here Both are in fact one and the same novel, the latter slightly re-edited to provide a sense of novelty;compare e.g. \\"El marinerito es de cera y se la antoja ponerle al sol, y el pobre suda la gota gorda y se me deshace\\" (Cristo de la Roca, p. 35) v. \\"El bolchevique es de cera, y se le antoja ponerle al sol y se me derrite\\" (La roca del amor, p. 33). Some editions are purely stylistical, compare e.g. \\"Espl√©ndida comida nos dio el marino aquella noche en el lujoso comedor de su yate\\" (Cristo de la Roca, p. 74) v. \\"Una comida suculenta nos dio el marino aquella noche en el lujoso comedor de su yate\\" (La roca del amor, p. 67) the disguise proved successful, as in contemporary press La roca was acknowledged as original.ABC 12.02.25, available here The novel is a love story, vaguely set in a milieu of Valencian aristocracy; it features a complex family intrigue. The plot is about overcoming a series of mysterious tragedies and misfortunes; Christian backbone of the protagonists, one of them a Catholic priest, enabled them to succeed. Falling into the typical genre fiction of the era, El Cristo / La roca is perhaps most interesting due to its narrative technique, as the story is made of different recollective accounts. Other Gort√°zar's prosaic attempts, a shorter novel¬°Sue√±os!; the issue date is unclear but fell on the years prior to 1911, compare Dolores Gort√°zar, Cristo de la Roca, Madrid 1911, p. 267, available here and a collection of stories,Sin color; the issue date is unclear but fell on the years prior to 1911, compare Dolores Gort√°zar, Cristo de la Roca, Madrid 1911, p. 267, available here were far less successful.though herself a Carlist, she has not contributed to Carlism in literature For some 40 years Gort√°zar contributed to numerous press titles;for the first ones identified see El Porvenir de Le√≥n 30.01.95, available here, El Porvenir de Le√≥n 10.04.95, available here according to one source she published in some 35 periodicals in Spain and in America.Mujeres espa√±olas 22.12.29, available here Only some of them can be identified;the ones identified are El Album Ibero-Americano, El Campe√≥n, El Cant√°brico, El castellano, El Correo Espa√±ol (Madrid), El Correo Espa√±ol (Buenos Aires), La Correspondencia de Espa√±a, La Cr√≥nica, El Cruzado Espa√±ol, El Cuerno, El D√≠a, El diario de Murcia, El Diario de Zamora, La Gaceta del Norte, Gloria Femenina, El Guadalete de Jerez, Heraldo de Zamora, La Ilustraci√≥n Nacional, El L√°baro, El Liberal, La Libertad, Las Margaritas, El Nervi√≥n, El Noticiero, Nuevo Mundo, La Patria, El Porvenir, Revista Gallega, Revista Hispano-Lusitana, El Siglo Futuro, Renovacion Espa√±ola and Roma. Listed partially after Judith Rideout, Woman Writers' Networks in Spanish Magazines around 1900 (University of Glasgor research spreadsheet), available here the ones to be named due to her longtime collaboration are local dailies El Porvenir (Le√≥n) and El Diario de Zamora, Carlist periodicals El Correo Espa√±olin the 1900s, 1910s and early 1920s and El Cruzado Espa√±ol,in the late 1920s and early 1930s and women's reviews like Gloria Femenina. The title which stands out is Roma, her own initiative formatted as one of the first Spanish feminine reviewsit included sections on literature, hygiene, fashion, music, education, religion and others, El Salmantino 02.03.12, available here and issued in 1912-1914.there are no copies available in digital hemerotecas. Roma was launched in late 1912, as in January 1913 there was 5th issue released, see La Correspondencia de Espa√±a 12.01.13, available here. Gort√°zar was last named as its directora in 1915; the same year she started contributing to Gloria Femenina. Roma was already her second attempt to launch a feminine review; the first one occurred in 1900, when a planned review was supposed to be named Revista Madrile√±a de Se√±oras, Judith Rideout, Women‚Äôs Writing Networks in Spanish Magazines Around 1900 [PhD thesis University of Glasgow], Glasgow 2016, p. 138, El Pa√≠s 15.06.00, available here. Some scholars claim also that in an unspecified period she directed a periodical named El Cuerno, Ochoa Fuertes 1997, p. 8 Gort√°zar's contributions are mostly poems, travel correspondence.see e.g. her 1928 correspondence from Egypt, Las Provincias 26.02.28, available here, or the 1928 from France, Las Provincias 03.06.28, available here short stories,Las Provincias 16.10.28, available here pieces on literature, arts, culture and education, all invariably formatted along Catholic lines and generally steering clear of controversial topics. As she usually published under various pen-namesthe one identified is \\"Dama Duende\\", see Las Provincias 29.08.28, available here the scale of her production is yet to be assessed, though it was probably massive. Education, Catholic and feminist activist Colegio Maria Cristina, Escorial In course of the usual opposiciones contest, in 1902 Gort√°zar emerged successful and commenced teaching in an unidentified Madrid state college.its objective was to \\"difundir la cultura entre las clases sociales, inculcar, inspiradas en la doctrina de Jesucristo, al amor universal, este es, la caridad que nos ha de redimir\\", La Correspondencia de Espa√±a 06.01.02, available here The same year she floated an idea of setting up a school for poor and handicapped children in Madrid,El L√°baro 01.04.02, available here the concept which in 1904 was somewhat re-formatted to a high-quality state school for girls from middle class, daughters of \\"viudas, empleados, familias de militares y √° veces la nobleza hundida\\".La Libertad 16.08.02, available here Already at that time the queen-mother Maria Christina was envisioned as a noble patron of the enterprise. In 1905 the project took shape of Centro Nacional de Instrucci√≥n de Mar√≠a Cristina, with Gort√°zar as its directora;La Correspondencia de Espa√±a 04.07.05, available here she supervised preparation works, which in 1906 led to opening of Escuela Mar√≠a Cristina,El Guadalete 25.03.06, available here in some sources referred to as Real Colegio de Mar√≠a Cristina.La Lectura Dominical 13.10.06, available here The establishment, apparently financed by private sponsors,financed by a certain Se√±or Vincenti was hailed in the press as state-of-the-art school;the school comprised own dormitory, gimnasio and garden initially it admitted only 19 girls.El Imparcial 13.06.06, available here Its curriculum was fairly standard, though it was allegedly the first one to include cooking lessons.El Liberal 01.02.05, available here Though in 1907 Gort√°zar was still the headmaster,one more name was Real Centro de Mar√≠a Cristina, El Guadalete 24.02.07, available here, more detailed info in La Correspondencia de Espa√±a 19.09.07, available here a in 1908 and in unclear circumstances she left the establishment and returned to Le√≥n. The same year she was appointed profesora provisional of Escuela Normal de Maestras in her native city,with the salary of 1500 ptas, El Distrito Universitario 07.09.08, available here entering also the jury of Universidad de Oviedo, a body supervising the college opposiciones.El Distrito Universitario 28.12.08, available here In 1909 she was nominated profesora provisional in Escuela Normal de Maestras in Soria,La Correspondencia de Espa√±a 27.05.09, available here yet her career was rather short. In 1910 she was charged with abuse of power and sacked.namely \\"abandono de destino y venta de determinados cuadernos de Dibujo\\", Gaceta de Instrucci√≥n P√∫blica y Bellas Artes 30.07.10, available here The issue is not entirely clear; in private letters Gort√°zar claimed her problems resulted from the ministry changing formal requirements.Manuel Revuelta Sa√±udo, Pedro Sainz Rodr√≠guez (eds.), Marcelino Men√©ndez y Pelayo. Epistolario, vol. 12, April 1908 ‚Äì April 1910, Madrid 1989 , p. 314 The episode seems to have terminated Gort√°zar's teaching career,one source claims that at unspecified time she taught also in Avila, Ram√≠rez G√≥mez 2000, p. 177. In 1920 she attempted also theoretical contribution on education, compare Dolores Gort√°zar, Las Escuelas Pias de Villacrriedo: Un colegio model, [in:] Revista Calasancia 8 (1920), pp. 286-288. She seemed quite competent and discussing detailed issues, e.g. advantages of large dormitory rooms tens of pupils and the small ones, for 4-6 pupils though she was later reported as engaged in opening schools for the working class in Covadonga in 1914La Correspondencia de Espa√±a 03.07.14, available here and in Madrid in 1918.El Correo Espa√±ol 05.01.18, available here women voting in Spain for the first time ever, 1933 Since the 1910s Gort√°zar was engaged in countless organizations marked by their feminine, Catholic, educational and at times social character.

She was particularly active in 1932; for the single month of June compare La Naci√≥n 02.07.32, available here, El Siglo Futuro 30.06.32, available here, La Epoca 30.06.32, available here, La Naci√≥n 27.06.32, available here, La Naci√≥n 02.06.32, available here took part in various veladas culturalesEl magisterio espa√±ol 05.03.27, available here and was member of Asociaci√≥n de Escritores y Artistas.El Siglo Futuro 09.04.36, available here Over time her engagements assumed somewhat non-traditional tone;Traditionalist, traditional and generally orthodox conservative outlook used to be her trademark; as late as in 1930 she demanded that minors below 14 years of age are not allowed into cinemas, El Cruzado Espa√±ol 02.05.30, available here in 1931-1933 she campaigned for female suffrage.\\"fomentar las actividades pol√≠ticas y la pr√°ctica del voto de la mujer\\", Ahora 01.11.31, available here Carlist Don Jaime Gort√°zar's father was a Liberal, active republicanLa Justicia 08.03.91, available here and friend of Castelar.La Cruz 15.10.31, available here It is not clear how the young Dolores developed Traditionalist sympathies; in the 1890s she was already a declared Carlist.compare an anecdote involving herself and Salmer√≥n, La Cruz, 15.10.31, available here Initially her activity was about organizing prayersEl Porvenir de Le√≥n 14.08.95, available here and donations for the Spanish army fighting in Cuba,El Porvenir de Le√≥n 17.08.95, available here yet already in 1899 she engaged in veladas artisticas of the Le√≥n c√≠rculo carlista.El Correo Espa√±ol 13.03.99, available here Successful proselytizing in privatesee an account of a fresh Carlist convert: \\"Lo sent√≠ mucho cuando supe que dicha se√±ora era liberala y carlista. Con gran repulsion fui √° verla, y qued√© maravillado al contempar √° la distinguida dama, llena de encantos sencillos y dulzura\\". Gort√°zar is referred to as \\"joven aristocr√°tica √© ilustrada y eminent escritora carlista, de alma grande, sublime; coraz√≥n noble, sencillo y angelical; cuyo car√°cter simp√°tico y dulcisimo contrasta con la energ√≠a y fogosidad de sus ideas viriles, y entusiastas y tradicionalistas\\", La Tradici√≥n 06.01.00 she took up propaganda works also in public, commencing cooperation with the semi-official Carlist mouthpiece, El Correo Espa√±ol.and other party papers, like La Libertad, La Libertad 16.08.02, available here In 1900 rumored even to launch her own Traditionalist daily,La Correspondencia de Espa√±a 08.04.00, available here at that time she was already known as \\"ilustre dama carlista\\".El Correo Espa√±ol 17.04.00, available here Her translation of Horace was acknowledged in a 1902 congratulation letter from the Carlist heir to the throne, Don Jaime, two years her senior;Don Jaime wrote: \\"He leido con gran inter√©s y verdadero placer la traducci√≥n de usted del Arte Po√©ticode Horacio, congratul√°ndome infinito que tan hermosa traducci√≥n sea obra de una literata carlista tan entusiasta como usted.

For the time being her Carlist zeal cooled down. During the Madrid schooling episode she seemed on perfect terms with the Alfonsist royal familyduring a personal visit Gort√°zar with her daughter paid homage to queen mother, La Correspondencia de Espa√±a 02.01.04, available here Infanta Isabel acted as madrina at Gort√°zar‚Äôs second wedding, La Correspondencia de Espa√±a 09.09.10, available here. Already prior to 1899 Infanta Isabel has even earned a dedicated poem, compare Nimias, p. 13, available here and in the 1910s she published in Mauristacompare La Lealtad 17.04.15, available here and national-Catholic press.compare Renovaci√≥n Espa√±ola 11.07.18, available here However, Gort√°zar retained her Carlist link, together with the party pundits sporadically giving lectures at Traditionalism-flavored events.e.g. with Luis Hernando de Larramendi, see La Lectura Dominical 05.07.13, available here The climax of her Carlist activity fell on the years following the Mellista secession. In a huge 1919 front-page El Correo Espa√±ol article she hailed Cid-style loyalty to the king as a genuine virtue;and pointed to a \\"serpiente del odio\\", slipping into the heart of de Mella, El Correo Espa√±ol 10.04.19, available here in 1920 she was listed active on numerous Jaimista meetings;El Correo Espa√±ol 07.07.20, available here, El Correo Espa√±ol 02.03.20, available here in 1921 she became president of the Madrid Margaritas,at unspeficied time she launched and edited a dedicated Carlist feminine review, Las Margaritas, short-lived due to financial problems, Antonio Manuel Moral Roncal, La cuesti√≥n religiosa en la Segunda Rep√∫blica espa√±ola, Madrid 2009, , p. 37 the Carlist feminine organization.El Correo Espa√±ol 15.03.21, available here The same year she took part in Junta de Lourdes, a grand Carlist assembly supposed to set a new political direction; immediately afterwards she published La Regeneraci√≥n de Espa√±a,full title Dios, Patria, Rey.

She switched to other conservative periodicals,it seems that she also maintained some sort of co-operation with the Integrist El Siglo Futuro, compare El Siglo Futuro 04.12.29, available here proudly boasting her friendship with Don Jaime,Las Provincias 15.03.25, available here hailing him as \\"nuestro caudillo\\"in 1927 Gort√°zar penned perhaps the most militant piece in her career, hailing Don Jaime on his namesday. The Carlist king was presented as champion of Christian values and Spanish tradition, a saviour not only of Spain, but also of the entire Europe, covered with \\"dark clouds\\". The article ended with \\"Viva el Rey!\\", compare El Eco de Gerona 06.08.27, available here and at times taking part in Traditionalism-flavored events.e.g. in homage to Francisco de Oller, El Eco de Gerona 05.11.27, available here In the late 1920s she commenced close collaboration with a new Carlist weekly from Madrid, El Cruzado Espa√±ol,some scholars note her, among the Cruzado manager Jes√∫s Cora y Lira, as the key pen of the paper, Moral Roncal 2009, p. 37 hoping to convert it into a daily.Jos√© Luis Agud√≠n Men√©ndez, Modernidad y tradicionalismo.

Actas del XIII Congreso de la Asociaci√≥n de Historia Contemporanea, Cuenca 2017, , p. 3223 At that time she was also awarded Ord√©n de la Legitimidad Proscrita, a high Carlist honor. During late primoderiverismo and Dictablanda she resumed more active stand, opening c√≠rculos,at times with de Villores, see El Cruzado Espa√±ol 12.12.30, available here, Moral Roncal 2009, p. 37, also El Cruzado Espa√±ol 02.08.29, available here featuring in headlinesEl Cruzado Espa√±ol 15.11.29, available here and presiding over the Madrid Margaritas, mobilizing against \\"grandes privilegios a las mujeres rojas\\",El Cruzado Espa√±ol 30.05.30, available here especially after declaration of the Republic. In course of its first years she remained active in the Carlist realm, though rather in the second if not the third row:the key work discussing Carlism during the Republic days, Martin Blinkhorn, Carlism and Crisis in Spain, Cambridge 1975 [re-printed with no re-edition in 2008], , does not mention Gortazar a single time. Also the work discussing the Mellista breakout of the 1910s-1920s, Juan Ram√≥n de Andr√©s Mart√≠n, El cisma mellista. Historia de una ambici√≥n pol√≠tica, Madrid 2000, , does not list her. Finally, a key work on Carlism during the late Restoration period, Agust√≠n Fern√°ndez Escudero, El marqu√©s de Cerralbo (1845-1922): biograf√≠a politica [PhD thesis Complutense], Madrid 2012, does not note Gortazar.

The civil Mandate administration was formalized with the League of Nations' consent in 1923 following the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne. Background In anticipation of receiving the Mandate the British switched from military to civilian rule with the appointment of Herbert Samuel as High Commissioner as of 1 July 1920. The Commission did not have its first formal review of the Mandate operation until 1924 where as well as the annual report for 1923 they also considered the interim reports for the period 1920‚Äì22.League of Nations. PERMANENT MANDATES COMMISSION. Report on the Work of the Fifth (Extraordinary) Session of the Commission (held at Geneva from October 23rd to November 6th, 1924) Mandate versus Declaration The British Mandate for Palestine was the vehicle for delivering the Balfour Declaration.MINUTES OF THE THIRTY-SIXTH SESSION Held at Geneva from June 8th to 29th, 1939 Annual reporting The Commission created a questionnaire QUESTIONNAIRE INTENDED TO ASSIST THE PREPARATION OF THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MANDATORY POWERS. detailing the matters that they expected to be covered in Mandate reports. =UK representatives= 1921‚Äì2, William Ormsby-Gore, 1922‚Äì36 Lord Lugard, 1936‚Äì39 Lord Hailey and briefly in 1939 Lord Hankey and then Lord Hailey returned. =Noteworthy sessions= 1924 ‚Äì Samuel travelled to Geneva in November 1924 to explain Britain's policy, at that point being the Churchill White Paper of 1922. The Commission used the term \\"twofold duty\\" to refer to the obligations to Jew and nonJew in the Mandate. 1930 ‚Äì The phrase \\"double undertaking\\" was used by Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald in his April 1930 House of Commons speech,Prime Minister's Statement: HC Deb 03 April 1930 vol 237 cc1466-7 in his 1931 letter to Chaim Weizmann and later in the Passfield white paper. At the 9 June 1930 Permanent Mandates Commission, the British Accredited Representative, Drummond Shiels, set out the British policy to reconcile the two communities. The Permanent Mandates Commission summarized that \\"From all these statements two assertions emerge, which should be emphasised: (1) that the obligations laid down by the Mandate in regard to the two sections of the population are of equal weight; (2) that the two obligations imposed on the Mandatory are in no sense irreconcilable. The Mandates Commission has no objection to raise to these two assertions, which, in its view, accurately express what it conceives to be the essence of the Mandate for Palestine and ensure its future.\\" This was later quoted in the Passfield white paper, with the note that: \\"His Majesty's Government are fully in accord with the sense of this pronouncement and it is a source of satisfaction to them that it has been rendered authoritative by the approval of the Council of the League of Nations.\\" 1937 ‚Äì The obligation proved to be untenable; as James Renton described it in 2007: \\"The attempt to create different messages for different audiences regarding the future of the same place, as had been attempted since the fall of Jerusalem, was untenable.\\" and fifteen years after the Mandate had been confirmed, the 1937 Palestine Royal Commission report, the first official proposal for partition of the region, referred to the requirements as \\"contradictory obligations\\",Peel Commission Report, p.363 whilst the 1937 Peel Commission used the term \\"dual obligation\\".Peel Commission Report, p.218 and with respect to the wider situation that had arisen in Palestine noted that the \\"disease is so deep-rooted that, in our firm conviction, the only hope of a cure lies in a surgical operation\\".Peel Commission Report, p.368 1939 ‚Äì The Minutes of the 36th Session that ran from June 8 to 29, 1939, including the Report of the Commission to the Council, were not considered by the Council of the League owing to the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939. Of seven members present, four \\"did not feel able to state that the policy of the White Paper was in conformity with the Mandate, any contrary conclusion appearing to them to be ruled out by the very terms of the Mandate and by the fundamental intentions of its authors\\" and three \\"were unable to share this opinion; they consider that existing circumstances would justify the policy of the White Paper, provided that the Council did not oppose it\\". The Commission as a whole concluded that \\"the policy set out in the White Paper was not in accordance with the interpretation, which in agreement with the Mandatory Power, the Commission had alaways placed upon the Palestine Mandate\\". In reply to the Commission's conclusions by way of a letter of August 5, 1939 to the Council of the League, the UK explained why it disagreed with the conclusions reached by the Commission.League of Nations.

For example, she chaired a 2008 American Psychological Association task force on the subject, which found major flaws in many of the relevant studies available at the time. The same panel found that the best available evidence indicated that a single abortion did not increase the risk of mental health problems relative to giving birth. She has also studied differences in self-perception of one's abilities and performance between men and women. In 2016, she published a study showing that white Americans who identify strongly as white become more likely to support Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election if they are reminded that America's demographics are changing.

He did much to make Julian of Norwich better known in the English-speaking world: the London Times described him as \\"a much-read authority\\" who \\"introduced many thousands to her work\\".The Times (London, England), Wednesday, 30 April 2008; pg. 60; Issue 69311. (573 words)  Life  Robert Llewelyn was born in Exmouth, Devon, on 6 July 1909.Entry in Register of Births He went to Pangbourne College and King Edward VI School, Southampton, where he became head boy, before studying mathematics at Pembroke College, Cambridge (BA 1932, MA 1936). In 1932 he started to teach mathematics at Westminster School, where his pupils included the actor Peter Ustinov and the politician Tony Benn. He was ordained deacon in 1936 at St Paul's Cathedral, London, and priest the following year, but continued to teach at Westminster School, while spending time with the Society of St. John the Evangelist, which had a monastery close to the school. In the summer of 1939 he was given a year's leave of absence to go to a missionary community at Cawnpore in India. The outbreak of World War II prevented him from returning to England, and he spent several years at the co-educational Hallet War School in Nainital, where his role was to set up and run a school for children of British officials and others who were unable, because of the war, to go to public schools in England. In 1946 he returned to Westminster School as chaplain. The following year he was invited to establish a diocesan school for older children in the Bahamas, where Spence Burton, a member of the Society of St John the Evangelist, was bishop. He remained there for about five years. In 1951 he was appointed headmaster of Sherwood College, Nainital. In 1966 he again returned to England, but was almost immediately asked to go back to India as chaplain to a mission house of nuns belonging to the Community of St Mary the Virgin at Pune and priest-in-charge of St. Mary's Church, Pune. In 1969 he was made dean and provost. He stayed in Pune for six years. From 1972 to 1975 he was warden of Bede House, a convent and retreat house of the Sisters of the Love of God near Staplehurst in Kent. On his retirement in 1976 he accepted an invitation to be chaplain at the shrine of Julian of Norwich in St Julian's Church, Norwich where he offered prayer, provided spiritual counsel to visitors and gave talks. He was based there until 1990. In 1998 he was awarded the Cross of St Augustine, the second highest international award in the Anglican Communion, in recognition of the contribution his books had made to spirituality. Giving him the award, the then Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, described him as \\"one of the outstanding spiritual teachers of our age\\".  Writings  Robert Llewelyn was a prolific writer with a special interest in Julian of Norwich, whose thinking he did much to expound and popularise. As well as editing her works and writing and editing books about her, in With Pity Not with Blame he attempted to apply her theological ideas to modern day life. Love Bade Me Welcome combines an account of Julian's argument that there is no wrath in God, with a practical guide to prayer. Among his publications are: * All Shall Be Well: The Spirituality of Julian of Norwich for Today, Paulist Press, 1982 * Our Duty and Our Joy: Sacrifice of Praise, Darton, Longman and Todd, 1993 * Love Bade Me Welcome, Darton, Longman and Todd 1985 (new edition 1999) * A Doorway to Silence: Contemplative Use of the Rosary, Darton, Longman and Todd, 1986 * Memories and Reflections, Darton, Longman and Todd, 1988 * The Fountain Within: Praying St John's Gospel, Darton, Longman and Todd, 1989 * With Pity, Not with Blame: Contemplative Praying with Julian of Norwich and 'The Cloud of Unknowing', Darton, Longman and Todd, 2nd edition 1989 * Thirsting for God, Darton, Longman and Todd, new edition 2000 * Prayer and Contemplation/Distractions are for Healing, Fairacres Publications, 2000 He was general editor of a series of books containing daily readings from major spiritual writers of the past, published by Darton, Longman and Todd, and compiled three of the books himself - two of extracts from the writings of Julian of Norwich, and one of extracts from The Cloud of Unknowing. The first of these books, published in 1980, was Enfolded in Love: Daily Readings with Julian of Norwich: as at May 2017, over 120,000 copies had been sold and this book has played a considerable role in bringing Julian of Norwich to a much wider readership.

She was one of the nineteen signatories on a letter from professional female chemists to the Chemical Society (later the Royal Society of Chemistry) requesting that women be accepted as Fellows to the Society.  Biography  Gostling was the daughter of George and Sarah Gostling and was born in Stowmarket, Suffolk, in 1873, and lived on Ipswich Street, Stowmarket. Her father was a pharmaceutical chemist and dental surgeon. She attended the Royal Holloway College from 1893 to 1897, obtaining a BSc in Chemistry. She was most likely taught there by Elizabeth Eleanor Field. After graduating from Royal Holloway with a BSc (First Class), she was awarded a Bathurst Studentship, which were founded in 1882 for the encouragement of advanced work in any of the natural sciences at Newnham College, Cambridge. She completed her studentship from 1899 to 1900 working for Henry Fenton, and returned to Royal Holloway in 1901, to take up a position as Demonstrator in Chemistry. She resigned her position in 1903 and married William Hobson Mills. Mills had recently been appointed to the Chemical Department of Northern Polytechnic as a lecturer in chemistry. By 1911, the couple had 4 young children, and lived with 2 servants at their home in Crouch End, in North London.1911 Census Two of her daughters would later be students at Newnham, and a third later became a staff member there. Gostling died at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 19 February 1962. A picture of the study used by Mildred May Gostling while attending Royal Holloway College  Chemistry research  Gostling‚Äôs research with Fenton involved the study of the action of acids on carbohydrates, and in particular, cellulose. She co- published 4 papers with Fenton and a subsequent note on her own. In general terms, this work explored the nature of reaction of acids with carbohydrates, and in particular the reason for an intense purple colour observed on the action of acids with cellulose based carbohydrates. This contribution was detailed in Fenton‚Äôs obituary: > ‚ÄúWith Miss M. M. Gostling he found that various carbohydrates, in particular > fructose, gave a purple colour when dissolved in ether and treated with > hydrogen bromide, and this proved to be due to an oxonim salt of a yellow > crystalline compound which could be thus obtained in considerable quantity > and was shown to be œâ-bromoethylfurfuraldehyde.‚Äù The work was presented to the Chemical Society (London) on 7 February 1901. After her marriage, Gostling continued to research with her husband and co- authored a paper with him under her married name. This paper detailed extensive experimental studies on the synthesis of several dinaphthanthracene derivatives, which to that point had been ‚Äúexceedingly scanty‚Äù according to Mills. This work included the first synthesis of pentacene, which is of modern interest as an organic semiconductor.  Petition to the Chemical Society  Gostling‚Äôs connections to Newnham College at this time meant that she was involved with several others in arguing that women should eligible for Fellowship of the Chemical Society of London, one of the Learned Societies that would become the Royal Society of Chemistry. The Chemical Society was founded in 1841, and by 1880, thanks to the efforts of Vernon Harcourt, and later William Ramsay and Sir William Tilden, the Society was being lobbied to grant women Fellowship. However, efforts towards the end of the nineteenth century were dismissed, and the issue was raised again in 1904, after Marie Curie was admitted as a Foreign Fellow. 19 women working in professional chemistry submitted a petition to the Chemical Society. The initiative was led by the biochemist Ida Smedley (Mrs. Maclean), the microbiologist Grace Frankland, and the organic chemist, Martha Annie Whiteley. The petition was ultimately unsuccessful, and it wasn‚Äôt until 1920 that women could become Fellows of the Society.

He was considered especially successful in interpreting works by Niccol√≤ Paganini.  Life  His first public performance happened when he was only 9. Soon he went to the Leipzig Conservatory. Studied with Henry Schradieck. After completing the course and returning to Britain he performed as soloist at Covent Garden (in 1882), The Proms, Crystal Palace, Glasgow Choral Union concerts, Royal Amateur Orchestral Society, bur also in Berlin and Leipzig. In approximately 1900 he took a concert tour in America, during which he used an exotic 'Russian' pseudonym Ivan Donoiewski. In 1902 he made the first performance of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto in England. His compositions include a Violin Concerto, a Sonatina for piano and minor pieces, among others a Soliloquy and a Berceuse. He also wrote a number of cadences to Ludwig van Beethoven's Violin Concerto. The 1843 'John Dunn' violin by Giuseppe Rocca is named after him.  Compositions  ;Book * John Dunn.

The navigation station was first established in 1874 as a fog alarm only and operated as such until 1966, when the present structure was built incorporating a lighthouse. The building has been designated a heritage lighthouse under Canada's Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act. History In 1874 a steam-powered fog whistle was built at Long Eddy Point, a tree-covered cliff at the northern end of Grand Manan. It began operation on 1 July 1874. It was built half-way up the cliff overlooking the Bay of Fundy, above the high water mark. It emitted 3 blasts, four seconds long, every minute. The station's infrastructure included a keeper's house, a coal shed, storage tanks for the water used to generate the steam for the whistle, and a wharf at the bottom of the cliff for delivering supplies to the keeper. Coal was brought from the top of the cliff by a wooden chute long. In 1893 and 1897 wooden abutments were built to protect the station from falling rocks and other material. In 1905 a new fog alarm building was constructed on the beach below the original station. It began operation on 15 January 1905 with a diaphone foghorn replacing the steam whistle. In 1948 a new keeper's dwelling was built at the top of the cliff near the present lighthouse. The present building, combining a fog alarm and a lighthouse, was constructed in 1966 at the top of the cliff. The station was automated and de-staffed in 1989. The Long Eddy Point Lighthouse is also known as \\"The Whistle\\", which was the nickname given to the original 1874 steam whistle. Heritage designation The Long Eddy Point Lighthouse has been recognized under Canada's Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act. The building will become the property of the Village of Grand Manan and The Swallowtail Keepers Society, which looks after the Swallowtail Lighthouse, will manage the property.

Aged 19 she entered the Slade School of Art in London, and later is believed to have studied at the Acad√©mie Colarossi in Paris. She exhibited works in the French naturalist style in the Paris Salon and at the Society of Lady Artists and the Royal Academy in London, with some critical success. In the 1890s she became active in the Fabian Society and she made portraits of a number of prominent socialists, as well as being romantically involved with George Bernard Shaw for a while. At this time the family home ‚Äì where she had a studio ‚Äì was in Chelsea, and she became a more-or-less full- time illustrator for publishers of magazines and novels. By the time of the resurgence of the women's suffrage movement in the early years of the twentieth century she had almost completely stopped working as an artist, but campaigned for the suffragist movement in various capacities. When their father died, in 1912, Bertha and her sister Mabel inherited a sizeable estate. They moved to Hampshire and largely withdrew from public life. Early life  Bertha Newcombe was born in Lower Clapton, Hackney, London, on 17 February 1857. The family home, Priory House, had also been the schoolhouse when her father, Samuel Prout Newcombe (b. 1824), had worked as a teacher. He was also the author and editor of children‚Äôs educational books.Fireside Facts from the Great Exhibition: Being an Amusing Series of Object Lessons on the Food and Clothing of All Nations in the Year 1851 and Pleasant Pages for Young People, or Book of Home Education and Entertainment, both published by Houlston & Stoneman, London, c.1851. After the death of his first wifeMary Harriet Newcombe (n√©e White) died in 1853. ‚Äì with whom he had two children (Frederick and Mary) ‚Äì he married Hannah Hales Anderton, and Bertha (b. 1857) was the middle of the three children (Ada b. 1856 and Claude b. 1860) by this second marriage to be born in Hackney. In about 1853 Samuel Prout Newcombe had changed career and started The London School of Photography, a photographic portrait studio that soon had branches across London and beyond, exploiting the public‚Äôs appetite for carte de visite portraits.For a full account of the photography business, see Professional Photographers in Hastings. His new business venture was a great financial success, and he moved the family out to Surrey ‚Äì first to Dorking,Census 1861: Rose Hill Estate, Rose Hill, Dorking. then, two years later, to Reigate,'Westfield', Reigate, Surrey. where two further children were born: Mabel (b. 1863) and Jessie (b. 1865). Samuel Prout Newcombe took a flippant attitude to census returns ‚Äì in the 1861 return he described the occupation of the young children as 'Playing!' and gave his own occupation as 'watercolour painter', despite at this point still running the photography studios and beginning to invest in housing developments.\\"A document dated 28th December 1865 lists Samuel Prout Newcombe as one of 17 investors in a property development scheme to build houses on the Farncombe Place estate near the West Sussex seaside town of Worthing\\" ‚Äì Professional Photographers in Hastings. In 1868 he advertised in the Croydon Chronicle for a large country house (or building land) ‚Äònot more than a mile from the station‚Äô.Croydon Chronicle and East Surrey Advertiser, 21 November 1868. By 1870, when Bertha was 13 years old, he had sold the photographic businesses and the family had moved to a large property , 'Northcote', in Croydon. Census 1871: 'Northcote', Park Hill Road, Croydon, Surrey ‚Äì with four live-in servants. Bertha is shown as one of seven offspring, along with Frederick (a clerk), Mary, Ada, Claude, Mabel and Jessy (now spelt with a y). Samuel Prout Newcombe describes his occupation as ‚Äòretired solicitor‚Äô ‚Äì which appears to be a fanciful claim. Slade School of Art  The Slade School of Art life class in an illustration to accompany the article 'Slade School Revisited' in The Sketch magazine, 13 March 1895. It seems likely that Bertha Newcombe would have received artistic instruction from her father, who once he was semi- retired was pursuing his own interest in watercolour painting.Mallalieu 2002: 71. Samuel‚Äôs middle name references his uncle, Samuel Prout (1783‚Äì1852), a well-known watercolour artist.For more details of the family connection between the Newcombe and the Prout families, see Professional Photographers in Hastings. Five works by Samuel Prout were in Bertha Newcombe‚Äôs estate in 1947, presumably inherited from her father, and were gifted to Southampton Art Gallery. At the age of 19 Bertha attended the Slade School of Art in London,The University College, London, Calendar for 1878‚Äì9 records Bertha Newcombe of Croydon as having entered the Slade in the 1876‚Äì7 academic year. She does not appear in other years' calendars, so presumably attended for only one year. where the French painter Alphonse Legros (1837-1911) had recently taken over as professor of drawing, painting and sculpture. Legros was 'a gifted draughtsman and had begun to make his reputation as a realist painter in Paris, moving in the circles of Courbet, Manet, Fantin-Latour and Degas'.Herrmann 2000: 370. Almost twenty years later Bertha Newcombe returned to the Slade with the writer Alice Stronach when they were preparing an article for the magazine The Sketch.'The Slade School Revisited', The Sketch, 13 March 1895, pp. 367‚Äì9. Through Stonach‚Äôs article, Newcombe recalls that when she attended the school in the early days of Professor Legros she 'thought that she would never spend a happier time'. She noted that 'The two life-schools ‚Äì one on the first floor, the other in the basement ‚Äì were used alternately by men and women, and when the men had their turn of the upper chamber they overflowed to the nether regions and worked with the women.' Newcombe evidently enjoyed the social side and camaraderie at the Slade. This came to the fore at breaks in an improvised subterranean rest space that the students called 'The Beetles‚Äô Home'. Here 'girlish confidences concerning flirtations' were exchanged and 'a certain set, which included some of the prettiest girls in the school, was bitten with the craze for √¶sthetic dress, then a new fashion, and their taste ran riot among peacock-blues and sage- greens, peacock feathers and poke-bonnets, flowing cloaks and bead necklaces.' Paris The model, Corinne, in the life class at the Acad√©mie Colarossi. This illustration accompanied the article 'Paris Art Schools' in The Sketch magazine on 2 May 1894. A bold but logical step for Bertha Newcombe after the Slade was to move to Paris. Luke Herrmann notes that '[Legros] encouraged his abler students to go to Paris, and thus in several ways the Slade acted as a link between London and Paris, and enabled British students to make contact with the much more liberal teaching methods and atmosphere of the French capital.'Herrmann 2000: 370. The extent and nature of Bertha Newcombe‚Äôs visits to Paris are not known, but she and Alice Stronach collaborated on an article entitled 'Paris Art Schools' for The Sketch,The Sketch, 2 May 1894, pp. 25‚Äì6. and this too seems to draw on Newcombe‚Äôs personal experience. Reference is made to 'a small band of English girl artists' who pursued their quest of 'an academy where men and women might work side by side under exactly the same conditions'. Eventually 'fate, or the natural course of events, guided the footsteps of the pioneers to the Acad√©mie Colarossi', where 'To Angelo [who ran the Acad√©mie] it mattered not whether the ladies did or did not study in the same room with the men students.' Newcombe‚Äôs exposure to French culture in the broadest sense and to the 'Paris art scene' in particular would have been an immensely transformative experience for her. She would soon be described by critics as an artist working in the 'French manner'. Rural scenes in the French manner Waterlilies, exhibited at the Society of Lady Artists in 1885. In 1880 she began exhibiting with the Society of Lady Artists at rooms in Great Marlborough Street, London. The Graphic, 13 March 1880. The society‚Äôs annual exhibition was a large event ‚Äì with 700 works by over 300 artists ‚Äì and in 1881 Newcombe exhibited two oil paintings, Gossips and Lingering Footsteps, both priced at ¬£19.Baile de Laperri√®re 1996. Then the Pall Mall Gazette, looking back later, noted that 'Miss Bertha Newcombe made a great success at the [Paris] Salon' in 1881.Pall Mall Gazette, 31 October 1882. In relation to the following year‚Äôs Salon the Illustrated London News explained the recent tendency of French landscape art towards 'pictures which ‚Ä¶ have been painted entirely out of doors'. Examples referred to include Le P√®re Jacques by Jules Bastien-Lepage and The Ferryman by William Stott. In this context, the reviewer continued, 'We have marked for special approval also a very small picture of a girl resting by a stream, where she has been cutting sedges, by Mdlle. Bertha Newcombe.' 'J.F.R.' in Illustrated London News, 20 May 1882. In 1884 The Times felt that 'In the drawing \\"Home at Last\\", Miss Bertha Newcombe has given us perhaps the best piece of work that she has yet accomplished in her very French manner,'The Times, 12 March 1884. and the Morning Post the following year explained that she has 'endeavoured to follow in the footsteps of French painters of rural scenes. Her group of peasants returning through the fields in the evening twilight will strongly remind the spectator of the modern Gallic school.'Morning Post, 19 March 1885. Reviewing the Society of British Artists exhibition in Suffolk Street in 1886 ‚Äì when James McNeill Whistler had just become president ‚Äì The Times noted 'the style chiefly in vogue among the exhibitors here ‚Ä¶ [has been] picked up in France and transported to England. In the first room, for example, there are good little pictures by Miss Bertha Newcombe, Mr. P. W. Steer ‚Ä¶ 'The Times, 27 November 1886. Croydon remained her home address during the 1880s, but she used various London studios,London studio addresses include 55a Bedford Gardens in 1883 (Graves 1989), 1 Cheniston Gardens in 1884 (Baile de Laperri√®re 1996), Clareville Grove Studios, Queen‚Äôs Gate, in 1890 (Baile de Laperri√®re 2002) and Bolton Studios, London, from 1886 (Graves 1989). and throughout the decade she was often 'abroad' ‚Äì presumably in France.In a newspaper article ‚Äì 'Surrey Artists and Their Homes' ‚Äì based on an interview with the Croydon artist Miss M. E. Kindon, reference is made to a large landscape painting on the wall 'that is by a lady friend of mine who resides when she is in England, at her home in Croydon, Miss Newcombe. She is abroad now' ‚Äì Croydon Advertiser and East Surrey Reporter, 21 January 1888. Bertha Newcombe's trips abroad continued into the 1890s. On 15 May 1896 George Bernard Shaw wrote to William Archer about a proposed production of Ibsen's Peer Gynt in Paris that 'Bertha Newcombe, who is in Paris, writes to ask whether I am coming over supposing they do it, & offers me a ticket.' And on 9 November he wrote to Bertha, 'I shall start on Wednesday morning, and arrive at the Gare du Nord at seven. If you are there, well & good.' He evidently stayed at the same lodging house as her. (Shaw 1965: 628, 697, 699). The New English Art Club Newcombe had continued to exhibit with the Society of Lady Artists throughout the 1880s, Baile de Laperri√®re 1996. Twenty-three works were exhibited at the SLA: Gossips and Lingering Footsteps (1880); A Flirtation, All Alone, Les Blanchisseuses and Baby‚Äôs Breakfast (watercolour) (1882); The Gleaners, The Riverside and The Sunshine (1883); Home at Last (watercolour), The Little Knitter (watercolour) and Three Studies of French Peasants (watercolour) (1884); Evening, Through the Long Grass (watercolour), The Bridge near the Mill Shere (watercolour) and Going Fishing (1885); Waterlilies and Father‚Äôs Beer! A Disagreeable Errand (1886); A Late Spring (1887); Mending Nets (1888); In the Orchard and A Lancashire Garden (1889) and The Way of the Wood (1893). and also at the Royal Academy from 1882.Graves 1989; Royal Academy of Arts 1981. Thirteen works are listed as having been selected for the RA summer exhibitions: Cecile (1882); Fragrant Posies and Evening (1883); The Last Load (1884); A Late Spring (1886); On the Avon near Salisbury (1888); The Way in the Wood (1891); A Meadow Stream (1892); A Story of the Woods (1893); A Daffodil Field (1895); A Primrose Copse (1904); An April Moon (1905) and The Shadowed Pond (1906). Then in 1888 she began exhibiting with the New English Art Club.Baile de Laperri√®re 2002.Six works were exhibited at the NEAC: Apples (1888); Mrs. S. Prout Newcombe and Doubt (1890); Evening Primroses (1891, winter); Sweet Lilac (1894, summer) and A Blue-bell Wood (1894, winter). The NEAC had been founded two years earlier by a group of British artists who had been together in Paris ‚Äì 'many of the works [exhibited at the NEAC in 1886] were in the \\"rustic naturalist\\" manner of the short lived but influential French painter Jules Bastien-Lepage.' Herrmann 2000: 371. Stanhope Forbes (1857‚Äì1947) was one of the NEAC artists whose work shares some characteristics with Newcombe‚Äôs. As even more radical ideas of modernism in 'English' art were emerging, the NEAC‚Äôs exhibiting policy became controversial, and Forbes and the group of artists associated with him ‚Äì known as the 'Newlyn School' ‚Äì resigned from the NEAC in 1890, 'largely as a protest against the pre- dominance of \\"Impressionist\\" artists, led by Walter Sickert'. Herrmann 2000: 378. Newcombe continued exhibiting with the NEAC until 1894. A Chelsea studio While still keeping a country home in Surrey, Noble's Green, Lingfield, Surrey. Samuel Prout Newcombe in 1891 leased No. 1 Cheyne Walk, Survey of London, Vol. 2: Chelsea, Pt I (London County Council, 1909), which says, 'The ground landlord is the Earl Cadogan, the present leaseholder being S. P. Newcombe, Esq.' a recently built town house in fashionable Chelsea, London SW. It was large enough for his family, and for a few years it housed his natural history collection.The 9 February 1899 edition of Nature ‚Äì the weekly illustrated journal of science ‚Äì reported that 'Mr. S. Prout Newcombe has offered the London County Council his educational collection of natural history specimens and literature.' This collection included 'about 21,000 objects' and 'a considerable number of works on natural history subjects'. It also provided an artist‚Äôs studio for Bertha, and accommodated four live-in servants. At this point Bertha Newcombe‚Äôs career and personal life took a dramatic change. She continued to exhibit a few paintings, but channelled her interests in art into the commercial illustration of books and magazines. She also became increasingly involved in Fabian Society politics. George Bernard Shaw and the Fabian Society The Socialists at Hyde Park, published in the Windsor Magazine in 1896. The Fabian Society, founded in 1884, had attracted many prominent contemporary figures to its socialist cause, including George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, Annie Besant and Emmeline Pankhurst. By the early 1890s Sidney and Beatrice Webb were very much at the society‚Äôs core. In this context, Bertha Newcombe was commissioned to paint a portrait of George Bernard Shaw. Shaw‚Äôs biographer Michael Holroyd draws upon Beatrice Webb‚Äôs diaries to provide a description of Newcombe at this time: 'She was in her thirties and, despite her aquiline features, thin lips and a figure that put Beatrice [Webb] in mind of a wizened child, not perhaps lacking absolutely all attraction. At least she was smartly turned out, petite and dark, with neat, heavily fringed black hair. And she was devoted to Shaw.'Holroyd 1997: 239. Shaw began to sit for his portrait at her studio at Cheyne Walk on 24 February 1892. 'As the portrait progressed so, inevitably, did the painter‚Äôs fascination with the sitter. On 27 February Shaw gave her a sitting until nine-thirty in the evening and dined with her afterwards.'Peters 1980: 96. Shaw was not known as a playwright at this time, and Newcombe‚Äôs portrait ‚Äì entitled GBS ‚Äì the Platform Spellbinder ‚Äì alludes to his charismatic presence as a political speaker. Newcombe‚Äôs relationship with Shaw falteringly progressed. According to Webb, Bertha Newcombe 'spoke of her five years of devoted love [to Shaw], his cold philandering, her hopes to marry'. Eventually (in 1898) Shaw married Charlotte Payne-Townshend. With hindsight Newcombe could see that Shaw was 'a passionless man ‚Ä¶ The sight of a woman deeply in love with him annoyed him. He was not in love with me, in the usual sense, or at any rate as he said only for a very short time ‚Ä¶ ' Meyers 2005. During the time of this relationship, Newcombe provided an illustration of Beatrice and Sidney Webb for the cover of the Fabian pamphlet Problems of Trade Unionism and also an illustration for The Sketch that commemorated the 'breakfast party at Borough Farm, near Milford, Surrey, on 4 August 1894' that led to the founding of the London School of Economics.The Sketch, 17 July 1895, p. 636, where captioned 'The Extreme Left'. In 1896 Bertha worked with Alice Stronach on an article, 'Socialist Leaders of Today', for which Newcombe provided portraits of Edward Pease, Harriot Eaton Stanton Blatch, Herbert Burrows and Henry Hyndman.Stronach, Alice, 'Socialist Leaders of Today', Windsor Magazine, Vol. 3 (1896). Bertha Newcome as illustrator A Madonna of the Cells, an illustration for the article 'Women Prisoners' published in the Windsor Magazine in 1896. Although she achieved some critical success as an exhibiting artist, it is not known to what extent Bertha Newcombe sold her paintings or whether she had any patrons. From the mid-1890s she withdrew from all exhibiting groups with the exception of the Royal Academy. In the article on the Slade School referred to above Stronach, Alice, 'The Slade School Revisited', The Sketch, 13 March 1895, p. 368. it is acknowledged that, in order to earn a living as an artist, most students will have to combine fine art with work as an illustrator. In 1894 Newcombe provided four illustrations for Henry Stephens Salt‚Äôs Richard Jefferies: A Study, published by J. M. Dent, who went on to commission 30 illustrations of Cumbrian life for John Watson‚Äôs Annals of a Quiet Valley by a Country Parson. Untypically, some of these illustrations were displayed in a gallery setting alongside work by Walter Crane and Aubrey Beardsley.The Times, 18 September 1894. The exhibition of book illustrations and bindings sponsored by the publisher J. M. Dent was at the Royal Institute of Watercolour Painters in Piccadilly. Over the next ten years, the illustration of short stories and novels aimed mainly at women became a full-time occupation for Newcombe.Magazines who employed her included Sylvie‚Äôs Home Journal, English Illustrated Magazine, Windsor Magazine, The Sketch, The Graphic,Young Woman, Lady‚Äôs Realm and Home Messenger. Novels illustrated included Maureen‚Äôs Fairings and Other Stories by Jane Barlow, The Dwarf‚Äôs Chamber and Other Stories by Nora Vynne, Mrs Martin‚Äôs Company and Other Stories by Jane Barlow, The Charmer by Shan F. Bullock, My Lady Frivol by Rosa Nouchette Carey, Love in Our Village by Orme Angus, Jan Oxber by Orme Agnus, Zike Mouldom by Orme Agnus, The Unexpected by Rowland Grey, Sarah Tuldon ‚Äì a Woman Who Had Her Way by Orme Agnus, Esau & St. Issey by Joseph Hocking, The Master of Marshlands by E. Everett-Green, Hope My Wife ‚Ä¶ by Lucy Gertrude Moberly, The Mill on the Floss by George Eliot (1906 edition) and Dan ‚Äì and Another by Lucy Gertrude Maberly. The illustrations seem to have pleased both readers and publishers to the extent that she seems to have been continually in work. Promotional copy describes the illustrations as 'pretty' and 'delightful'.The Queen magazine, 19 December 1900: 'A word of praise should not be lacking for the pretty and characteristic illustrations by Bertha Newcombe.' On the whole the drawings are competent and follow the literary style of the stories in being conventional and unchallenging. On only a few occasions ‚Äì such as in relation to Alice Tronach‚Äôs assignments for The Sketch (1894‚Äì5) and the Windsor magazine (1896) and in illustrations for Major Arthur Griffiths‚Äôs article on 'Women Prisoners' for the Windsor Magazine (1896)Windsor Magazine, Vol. 4 (July‚ÄìNovember 1896), pp. 433‚Äì5. ‚Äì does an assignment seem to capture Newcombe‚Äôs artistic imagination. With an impressive output, she seems to have been virtually a staff illustrator for the publisher Ward, Lock & Co. until 1906/7. Around this time her life took another turn: she stopped taking commercial illustration work and became more involved in the women‚Äôs suffrage movement. Her mother died in 1905, and she exhibited at the Royal Academy for the last time in the following year. Women‚Äôs suffrage Bertha Newcombe‚Äôs parents had supported women‚Äôs suffrage, and her mother, Mrs Hannah Hales Newcombe, had been treasurer of the Croydon branch of the National Society of Women's Suffrage in 1873.Professional Photographers in Hastings. With the resurgence of the women's suffrage movement from 1903 and given her involvement in Fabian politics, it is not surprising that Bertha herself was active in the London Society for Women's Suffrage ‚Äì a branch of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), also known as the 'suffragists'. The NUWSS pursued 'Votes for Women' through peaceful, non- violent, constitutional means, and was critical of the aggressive methods of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) ‚Äì the 'suffragette' movement. In 1909 Bertha Newcombe was on the NUWSS‚Äôs executive committee.Common Cause, 11 November 1909. Bertha was fully committed to the unglamorous realities of political campaigning: fund-raising,An advertisement in the 8 August 1912 issue of Common Cause announces a 'Bazaar and Oriental F√™te' in aid of the London Society for Women‚Äôs Suffrage at the Royal Palace Hotel, Kensington, on 5, 6 and 7 December 1912, when Bertha Newcombe would be running the 'Art Stall' and 'The Old Curiosity Shop'. personal financial contributions,Itemised in Common Cause ‚Äì for example on 21 November 1913. propagating the NUWSS‚Äôs message through the sale of its newspaper, Common Cause, Common Cause 24 August 1911 notes Bertha Newcombe working within the newly formed East Dorset Federation ‚Äì on a stall in Wareham and selling 'our newspaper' in Corfe. and playing a role on organising committees. Perhaps her most significant intervention was her letter-writing campaign to influential men within London‚Äôs cultural elite,See letters from and to Bertha Newcombe in the Women‚Äôs Library at the London School of Economics. and a related letter published in The Times in 1909The Times, 23 March 1909; reprinted in the Daily News, 25 March 1909. to publicise the petition that the NUWSS was organising for men to support the Votes for Women campaign. Elizabeth Garrett and Emily Davis presenting the 1866 Women's Suffrage Petition to Sir John Stuart Mill in Westminster Hall, painted in 1910. That Bertha Newcombe was an artist was only of minor relevance to her activism. She is listed as being in the Artist‚Äôs Suffrage League (established in 1907)Records of the Artists' Suffrage League are in the Women‚Äôs Library at the LSE, reference 2ASL. ‚Äì the league‚Äôs organising committee were largely Chelsea-based female artists ‚Äì but no known work was produced by Newcombe under the ASL‚Äôs auspices.A draft design by Newcombe for a poster is owned by the Women‚Äôs Library (item 2LSW/E/01/2/19), but does not have 'ASL' branding. An oil painting Elizabeth Garrett and Emily Davis presenting the 1866 Women's Suffrage Petition to Sir John Stuart Mill in Westminster Hall was submitted to the Royal Academy in 1910 but was not selected for exhibition.The painting is in the Women‚Äôs Library at the LSE: item TWL.1998.60. For a further discussion of the painting, see Crawford 2018: 169‚Äì70. Papers regarding the painting are also in the Women‚Äôs Library: 2LSW/B/4/12/8. What prompted the painting is not known, and what it depicts ‚Äì in the rather pedestrian style of her illustrations for romantic fiction ‚Äì is not obvious. Retirement Bertha Newcombe and her younger sister Mabel were still living with their father at Cheyne Walk at the time of the 1911 census; however, in the following year he died,On 14 October 1912, aged 88. leaving an estate of ¬£25,629 10s. 6d. ‚Äì equivalent to about ¬£2.9 million in 2018.

Bertha was 55, Mabel 50, and by the 1920s they were living at Petersfield in Hampshire.In spring 1920 they were living at 'Ciddy Hall', Liss, Petersfield; in 1923 at Palmer‚Äôs Farm, Petersfield; and by 1927 they were at 'Redlynch', Tilmore, Petersfield, where they remained. There are few records of Bertha‚Äôs life after she left London. Apparently she donated money to the Women's Pioneer Housing Association, a not-for-profit organisation which aimed to help single women find secure, affordable housing in the 1920s, and in 1934 she supported the Shoreditch Housing Association to provide good housing for the needy.Professional Photographers in Hastings. GBS ‚Äì the Platform Spellbinder, 1892. In 1929 Bertha Newcombe and George Bernard Shaw attended a much-belated unveiling of her 1892 portrait GBS ‚Äì the Platform Spellbinder, at the National Labour Club.Daily Herald, 1 November 1929. Later the painting was thought to have been lost during the Second World War, but it was rediscovered in 2012 and moved to Labour Party headquarters in London. A 22 June 212 BBC News report estimated the painting to be worth between ¬£10,000 and ¬£20,000.

Her suitors included the Duke of Clarence, later King William IV (b. 1765) keen to pay off his great debts. She eventually chose William Wesley-Pole (b. 1788), who on 14 January 1812 assumed the additional surnames of Tylney-Long, changing his name by Royal Licence. The couple married on 14 March 1812, but his extravagance meant the marriage was an unhappy one.Geraldine Roberts, The Angel and the Cad (Macmillan: London, 2015) William gained an appointment as Gentleman Usher to George IV in 1822 (rendering him immune to arrest for debt) and left Britain to escape his creditors around 1823. Catherine implied in a letter to her sisters that her husband had given her a venereal disease. Whilst on the continent he began a relationship with Helena Paterson Bligh (d. 7 April 1869), the wife of Captain Thomas Bligh of the Coldstream Guards, eventually abandoning Catherine entirely. She died in 1825, leaving her children in the care of her two unmarried sisters, Dorothy and Emma. William had only had a life interest in Catherine's property, although he was responsible for the demolition of Wanstead House in 1825 to pay off some of his debts and also unsuccessfully tried to gain custody of their eldest child William, on whom Catherine's fortune had devolved.

A tropical depression formed on August 13 and attained tropical storm intensity later that day. Initially, Vera meandered in the monsoon trough. On August 17, however, the system abruptly re-formed to east-northeast, and subsequently began to move east and then north. Vera became a typhoon on August 20, and peaked in intensity two days later. Typhoon Vera then turned west-northwest and slowly weakened as it approached Okinawa. After passing near the island, Vera turned north as it tracked east of China. The typhoon made landfall on South Korea on August 28 as a tropical storm, and the next day, transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The typhoon was responsible for minor damage to Okinawa, where 20,000 houses lost power and one fatality was reported. Although the core remained offshore China, over 500 homes were destroyed, 7 lives were lost, and 28 people were hurt in Shanghai. Nationwide, 1,400 power lines were cut and eight fatalities were reported. Across South Korea, a total of 1,852 structures were damaged and 384 others were destroyed, which left 6,623 people without shelter. The storm also wrecked 929 boats and damaged 37 ports. A total of 9,145 ha (22,600 acres) of farmland were flooded. Damage totaled $22 million (1986 USD). Nationwide, 26 people were killed and 81 others were injured. In addition to the aforementioned casualties, 25 individuals were feared dead after the ship New Genshine went missing. Meteorological history Typhoon Vera formed from the most intense monsoon trough, which extended from the International Date Line to the Philippines, observed in the basin since 1974. Despite outflow from Tropical Storm Georgette, an area of low pressure embedded in the monsoon was first identified near Yap on August 12. Because the disturbance was one of many disturbances within the monsoon trough being tracked by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), a defined low-level circulation was difficult to spot on weather satellite imagery. At 00:00 UTC on August 13, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared the system a tropical depression, after its center had become better defined. The persistence of deep convection prompted the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert during the early morning hours of August 14\\\\. Over the next 24 hours, the disturbance became better organized, and midday on August 15, the JTWC upgraded it into a tropical depression. Six hours later, the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical storm. At 00:00 UTC on August 16, the JTWC upgraded the depression into a tropical storm, based on reports of winds from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft. Tropical Storm Vera was initially expected to move west-northwest due to a strengthening subtropical ridge to the north; however, the storm continued to meander in the monsoon trough instead. A Hurricane Hunter aircraft on the afternoon of August 16 failed to identify a low-level circulation. Satellite imagery on August 17 suggested that the storm's center became elongated. By 12:00 UTC on August 17, however, a new circulation had become evident around to the east-northeast and quickly became Vera's dominant circulation. Post-season analysis from the JTWC indicated that the development of a separate circulation represented a new tropical cyclone; however, the JMA considers the two circulations of Vera to be one continuous cyclone. Initially, the re-developed system continued to meander, while maintaining minimal tropical storm strength. Vera then began to drift eastward under the influence of a trough located to the east of the monsoonal flow. Early on August 20, both the JTWC and the JMA classified Vera as a typhoon. On August 21, a ridge began to build towards the storm's east, forcing Vera to turn north. On August 22, the JTWC estimated that Vera attained its peak intensity of while the JMA estimated a peak of . Around this time, the typhoon passed about southwest of Iwo Jima. Not long after attaining peak intensity, Typhoon Vera turned westward in the general direction of Okinawa. The storm weakened as it approached land, and late on August 25, Vera tracked directly over the island, with both the JTWC and JMA estimating winds of . Vera's motion began to slow as the storm rounded a subtropical ridge to its north, and after reaching the western periphery of the ridge at 06:00 UTC on August 26, Vera turned to the northwest, and later to the north. Meanwhile, Vera began to lose tropical characteristics and transition into an extratropical cyclone. After passing almost east of Shanghai, Vera continued to weaken due to decreased outflow that was previously aided by the storm's connection to the monsoon trough. Midday on August 28, Vera made landfall near the Kunsan Air Base in South Korea as a tropical storm. At 18:00 UTC, Vera cleared the Korean Peninsula. After accelerating towards the northeast, the JTWC estimated that Vera completed its transition on the morning of August 29, although the JMA continued to watch its remnants until September 2. Preparations and impact =Japan= The JTWC accurately predicted that the typhoon would strike Okinawa 66 hours in advance. As a result of the long lead times, authorities in the island were able to take precautions well in advance. All scheduled flights between Okinawa and the Japanese main islands were cancelled and inter-island ferry service was suspended. Due to the advance warning, damage on Okinawa was slight, although 30,000 customers lost power. The typhoon dropped heavy rains, peaking at Yabitsudake, where of rain fell. Within a 24-hour time span, Mount Yonaha received the greatest amount of rainfall, with a total of . Hongawa received of rain in an hour, the highest hourly rainfall total measured during the storm.

Offshore, high seas disrupted several ships, including the Tatong, which sent a signal of distress. A 30-year-old man was killed after being struck by a heavy rope while preparing for the storm. Throughout Okinawa, five houses were flooded and two walls beside a road collapsed. =China= Due to the impending threat of Vera to Shanghai, more than 3,000 ships were piloted into port and 120 pumping stations were readied to avert potential flooding. Furthermore, 20,000 cruise passengers were evacuated to shelter. Despite tracking east of Shanghai, seven people were killed and twenty-eight others were injured in the city. The New China News Agency reported that over 500 homes were destroyed. There were also a total of 25 accidents and the storm disrupted power supplies in 1,000 different locations across the city. A total of 3,000 emergency workers were recalled to restore electrical supplies across Shanghai. In nearby Shengshi Qunado, one person was killed, and 70 fishing boats sunk. Nationwide, 500 homes were destroyed, eight others were damaged, 1,400 power lines were cut, and eight people were killed. =South Korea= Prior to striking South Korea, a storm alert was declared for the entire country. Medical teams acquired tents, blankets, and other emergency supplies ready to hurry to stricken areas. Greater than 2,400 schools across South Korea closed, and thousands of fishing boats took shelter in ports. All domestic airline flights and ferry services were halted, stranding more than 2,000 tourists on Cheju Island alone. However, international flights out of Seoul, except those to Japan, were unaffected by Vera. For two days, the typhoon drenched South Korea, with much of the country receiving of precipitation. The highest rainfall total recorded in the country occurred in Cheju Island, where was recorded and hundreds were left homeless. At the Taegu Air Base, more than 75 trees fell, which damaged roofs of many homes and power lines. Over 100 industrial plants along the nation's southern coast were forced to stop operation for two hours after 13 transmission towers collapsed. Access to water supplies in the nearby cities of Pusan and Yosu was temporarily revoked, stranding hundreds of tourists. Six boats sunk, including three offshore Pusan. A ship, the New Genshine, went missing due to the typhoon; the vessel's 25 member crew was later presumed dead. Nationwide, a total of 1,852 structures were damaged, and 384 others were demolished, which resulted in 6,623 homeless. The storm also wrecked 929 fishing boats and damaged 37 ports. A total of of farmland were flooded. Eight people were confirmed to have been killed while eighteen others were reported missing and feared dead and 81 individuals were injured. Damage amounted to $22 million, including $4.3 million in property damage.

As Independent Counsel from 1987 to 1990, he investigated allegations of illicit lobbying and conflicts of interest during the administration of Ronald Reagan, including investigation of then-sitting U.S. Attorney Edwin Meese. Early life McKay was born in South Pasadena, California, and grew up in Washington, D.C. He received a bachelor's degree from the Cornell University Agricultural College in 1938. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Commander and commanding patrol craft in the Mediterranean Sea. After the war, he received a law degree from Georgetown University in 1947.Langer.  Early Legal Career  After serving for one year as an assistant U.S. attorney in Washington, McKay began practicing law at Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C., where he became a partner in 1957. As a specialist in antitrust law, McKay represented clients such as the National Football League and Continental Baking.Langer.  Independent Counsel for the Wedtech Investigation  In 1987, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit appointed McKay as Independent Counsel to investigate the so-called Wedtech scandal.Langer. The appointment began after the Justice Department requested a special prosecutor to investigate allegations that Lyn Nofziger had violated a prohibition on lobbying for clients such as Wedtech shortly after Nofziger's service on the White House staff of president Ronald Reagan. Under McKay's leadership, the investigation expanded to assess evidence that Edwin Meese‚Äîby then the sitting U.S. Attorney General‚Äîhad intervened on behalf of Wedtech and otherwise violated conflicts of interest standards during Meese's service as White House Counsel to President Reagan.Langer. In an 814-page report issued in 1988, McKay concluded that Meese had fallen short of ethical standards and likely violated federal conflict-of-interest and tax laws, but McKay declined to request a criminal indictment of Meese because there was no evidence that Meese had acted \\"for personal gain.\\"Langer. The independent counsel prosecuted Nofziger for illegal lobbying; the jury convicted Nofziger but the conviction was overturned on appeal.Langer.  Later Years  McKay served briefly at the age of 83 in the Professional Responsibility Advisory Office of the U.S. Department of Justice. The Washington Post reported that McKay was \\"one of the oldest Justice Department lawyers ever hired.\\"Langer. As a senior counsel associated with Covington & Burling, McKay continued to represent clients on a pro bono basis well beyond his 90th birthday.Langer. In his later years, McKay focused particularly on representing veterans seeking benefits. In 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims presented McKay with the Hart T. Mankin Distinguished Service Award. In 2011, the National Veterans Legal Services Program awarded McKay its Senator Daniel Inouye Award for his \\"unyielding support for veterans, service members and military families.\\" In 2013, Eio Books published a novel by McKay based on his World War II experience, entitled Billy's War. McKay died at his home in Chevy Chase, Maryland, in 2015, at the age of 98. His survivors included his wife of 72 years, the former Mary Anne Hunter.Langer.

In the early 17th century, there appears to have been a special local emphasis on rapier fencing in Venice, specifically associated with Nicoletto Giganti.Tom Leoni, Venetian Rapier: Nicoletto Giganti's 1606 Rapier Fencing Curriculum, FreeLance Academy Press, 2010 and Giacomo di Grassi. As elsewhere in Europe, the tradition of classical fencing persisted in Venice until the beginning of the 19th century. The Venetians were masters of the art of fencing, and shared with their colleagues of Bologna the sound principles of fencing known as Bolognese or Venetian. The earliest writings on Venetian fencing focused on the properties of different parts of the blade which were used in defense and offense. From this approach arose the concept of the \\"center of percussion\\", the ideal spot on the blade at which a blow should be struck. The blade was divided into four parts: the first two parts from the hilt should be used for protection; the third one near the \\"center of percussion\\" was used for striking; and the fourth part at the tip was used for pricking. In the beginning of the sixteenth century, French nobles earned a reputation as excellent swordsmen, however it was customary for them to go secretly to Italy to learn martial skills in the schools of Bologna or Venice. Nicoletto Giganti has been described as \\"a fruitful innovator in fencing.\\" Giganti was a 17th- century Italian rapier fencing master. The frontispiece of his 1606 work names him as \\"Nicoletto Giganti, Venetian\\", although evidence suggests he or his family moved to Venice from the town of Fossombrone, in Le Marche, Central Italy. Little is known of Giganti's life, but in the dedication to his 1606 treatise, he counts professional experience arising from 27 years work, whereas the Giganti family of Fossombrone were lesser nobility, long in the military service of Venice. Man with sword and shield from Tractate of Giacomo di Grassi Another representative of the Venetian school of fencing was Giacomo di Grassi, an Italian fencing master who wrote the fencing treatise Ragione di adoprar sicuramente l'Arme, si da offesa come da difesa in 1570. The Venetian master of fencing developed his own theory of the fencing art. His method was much simpler than the technical elements of Achille Marozzo. There are some typical examples of his systems in the works by Henry de Saint Didier and Vincentio Saviolo.  References   Further reading   Cent'anni di scherma a Venezia (1889‚Äî1989).

The game, directed by Masaya Matsuura in collaboration with Keiichi Yano, is pitched as a revival of story-based rhythm games such as PaRappa the Rapper and Gitaroo Man, and features rap battle gameplay mixed with Japanese culture. Following the game's failure to secure financing on crowdfunding website Kickstarter, the game's development has been placed on hold. Gameplay Project Rap Rabbit aims to build upon the rhythm-based gameplay of the two companies' previous games, PaRappa the Rapper and Gitaroo Man. Set in 16th Century Japan, players are put in the role of a rabbit named Toto-maru, who must used the power of rap music to battle against powerful overlords who have corrupted the land. The gameplay revolves around three phases; Listen, Respond, and Rap. During the Listen phase, in which the opponent raps, the player can pick up certain words that they themselves can use during their phase. In the Respond phase, players use an emotion wheel, inspired by dialogue wheels from games such as Mass Effect and Fallout 4, to determine how the player will respond to the opponent. Finally, the Rap phase has players press buttons in time to the music to perform some of the rap lyrics, which differ depending on what emotion was chosen. Both the player and opponent have Swag Gauges which go up and down depending on successful raps, and certain boosts may be applied depending on how the chosen emotion matches up with the situation. Toto-maru's status varies depending on how much Swag he has, and the game will end if he ran out of Swag. Development Project Rap Rabbit was first revealed through an article on Rice Digital on May 2, 2017.http://www.ricedigital.co.uk/project-rap-rabbit/ The game was officially announced on May 12, 2017http://www.ricedigital.co.uk/project-rap-rabbit- confirmed/ and a Kickstarter campaign launched on May 15, 2017. The campaign was criticised for featuring no gameplay footage and setting stretch goals at unreasonable levels. The campaign ultimately failed, with pledges only reaching ¬£161,557 of the ¬£855,000 required. As a result of this failure, work on Project Rap Rabbit was discontinued until further funding could be found.

He offered the United States's first money back guarantee for his products and is credited as the founder of the direct sales industry.  Family genealogy  The American Watkins are of Welsh descent that settled in New Jersey in the latter part of the seventeenth century. Watkins' great-grandfather was born in New Jersey in the early 18th- century and during the American Revolutionary War had contracts for furnishing food to the Continental Army. His grandfather was also from New Jersey; in 1800 he migrated to Ohio and settled at Fort Washington, where the city of Cincinnati developed.  Early life  Joseph Ray Watkins was the second son and third child of Reverend Benjamin Utter Watkins and Sophronia (Keeler) Watkins. He was born in Cincinnati on August 21, 1840. Joseph and his older brother were educated at the local public schools. Watkins' father sold their homestead in 1862 and moved the family to Minnesota. They settled at Maine Prairie in Stearns County. Watkins became a friend of one William Fox in 1864 when Fox was visiting Stearns County for health reason. Fox was originally from Cadiz, Ohio. Watkins went back with Fox in 1867 to Cadiz on the idea of obtaining some dried fruit for local Minnesotans that he would take back home. In Cadiz Watkins met his future wife, whom he communicated with by letters over the next year after he went back to Minnesota. Watkins then in August of 1868 went back to retrieve her. Watkins married twenty-three year old Mary Ellen Heberling of Cadiz on September 10, 1868 and returned with her to Minnesota.  Career  J.R. Watkins Medical Company, c. 1915 Watkins passed through Harrison, Ohio, on the way to Cadiz to retrieve his new bride. There he met one Dr. Richard Ward, the manufacturer of a popular vegetable anodyne liniment for relieving muscle pain. This medicine was well known in Minnesota already through the sales franchise of J. H. Sands established in 1856. Watkins had an interest in the product and negotiated a franchise of his own from Dr. Ward. Watkins had a special buggy sales wagon made in St Cloud, Minnesota. It was a large wooden-covered wagon with compartments and a high seat in front. It cost five hundred dollars with the horses. Watkins started to experiment with making the red liniment at his home in Plainview, Minnesota in 1868. He personally bottled the home-made medicine of Asian camphor and red pepper extract and sold it to the public. This became the founding of J. R. Watkins Medical Company. Watkins sold his product directly to the local farmers and villagers, being credited as the founder of the direct sales industry. Watkins at first pushed a cart as a one-man operation. Later he peddled his business with a horse and buggy sales wagon filled with products, developing a sales territory around his hometown. The direct door-to-door business was so successful that he brought in other wagon salesmen who sold throughout Minnesota and eventually to other states. Watkins built his business on customer satisfaction and extended the first money back guarantee in the country for his product. He had a \\"trial mark\\" molded onto each bottle ‚Äì positioned about one-third of the way down ‚Äì and promised customers that if they hadn't used the product below that point, they would receive a full refund if they were unsatisfied. Watkins moved his business to Winona, Minnesota in 1885. There it was easier to obtain the materials for his medical products. He rented a four-room house and used half for manufacture of his home remedy medical products ‚Äì liniment, extracts, and salves. These products were purchased by lumbermen for relief of sore muscles from working all day in a sawmill. After establishing in Winona, Watkins expanded into publishing in 1898 with The Morning Independent, a democratic rival to the Winona Daily Republican. Watkins sold the paper to Horace G. White and Frank J. Rucker in 1902, which was later sold to the Winona Republican-Herald in 1919.  Family  Watkins and his wife, Mary Ellen, had two children while living in Plainview. Their eldest, a son, died at 14 months of age. Their second child, Grace, was born in 1875. Grace was a respected marksman and avid hunter, having been trained by Annie Oakley, and at one time held the women's trap shooting record of 186 consecutive targets. She married typewriter salesman Ernest L. King, who eventually became president of Watkins Incorporated.  Later life and death  Watkins' wife died in 1904, which was the same year his daughter married. He then married his son-in-law's mother in September 1911, but he died in Jamaica three months later.

Starting from the same tropical landscape (named Coconut BeachSEGA Master System Out Run instruction manual, p. 34), on each trip the player is likewise presented sequentially with four junctions - each with a choice of two turns - with the goal of ending at one of five destinations before the timer runs out. The landscapes, however, differ in varying degrees to the original, and the shapes of the roads are unique. Also unlike the original title, Out Run 3-D allows the player to choose between three difficulty settings - Beginner, Average and Expert - which changes the weather as well as the road layout of each leg of the journey.

The \\"Clichy affair\\" refers to a French trial that took place in August 1891. The trial resulted from the shooting, arrest, and beating by police of three anarchists, at a confrontation in Clichy on May 1, 1891, which was the first French, and international, celebration of International Workers' Day. Two of the three anarchists arrested were convicted and given harsh sentences. Event About thirty demonstrators improvised a parade, with a red flag in front, from Levallois-Perret to Clichy. A little before three o'clock, after the flag was furled, and the demonstrators were dispersing, Police Commissioner Labussiere ordered the flag be confiscated. This is the incident which initiated the affair. Shots were exchanged and police officers were slightly injured. Three anarchists were immediately arrested, including Louis Leveille, himself wounded by a bullet. As soon as they arrived at the police station, they each suffered a violent beating. This caused a sensation among the anarchists. The three anarchists were charged with crimes for this incident. At their trial, on 28 August 1891, Advocate General Bulot demanded the death penalty against one of the defendants. A transcript of the trial: Un proc√®s d'anarchistes, La Presse, n¬∞1179, 30 ao√ªt 1891, p.3 Affair At first overshadowed by the Fourmies Shooting, which happened the same day and killed nine demonstrators, the popular press had little interest in this trial. However it was followed with intense interest by anarchist newspapers. The anarchist newspaper, \\"La R√©volte\\", highlighted the exemplary attitude of Henri Louis Decamps during his trial, as well as the violence suffered by his companions. S√©bastien Faure published a booklet about this case, and the court proceedings, entitled The Anarchist in Assize Court. Inspired The acceptance of police brutality, by the prosecutors, and courts, and the convictions of the anarchists, were seen as a provocation by anarchists. With the help of some companions, Ravachol decided to respond. He perpetrated two attacks against the magistrates (judges) who heard the case.

History  Zemun's medieval walls were built on top of the old Celtic, and then Roman town of Taurunum. The medieval walls are believed to be built by the Byzantine Empire. The first written mentions of the fortress are from the 9th century, and in the late 11th century it suffered great damage during the First Crusade. During the first half of 12th century, the town is repeatedly mentioned in relation to Byzantine‚ÄìHungarian clashes. John Kinnamos mentions that in 1127 the Hungarians captured the Belgrade Fortress, stripping its materials and using stone to build the Zemun fortress. A few decades later, Manuel I Komnenos took Zemun, and reversed the process. He took stones off the Zemun walls, transported them to the other side of the riverbank, and refortified Belgrade. The Ottomans additionally destroyed the town in 1397. In 1411, Sigismund, the Holy Roman Emperor ceded Zemun to despot Stefan Lazareviƒá. In 1441, it came under the possession of ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá. On 11 August 1456, it was here where John Hunyadi, the famous regent of Hungary, succumbed to his wounds during the Siege of Belgrade. As there were far too many unburied corpses of fighters around the tower, a plague hit the army and the regent shared the same fate as his ill soldiers. The Ottomans capture Zemun in 1521, in a fierce battle against the Serbian regiments under Marko Skobliƒá. Since the 18th century, Zemun fortress is in ruins.

Lethieullier goes on to state that in the summer of 1746 workmen showed him \\"urns\\" \\"of the coarsest earth\\" and bones they had discovered, which he believed to be the remains of Roman burials, as well as at least three coins. The exact locations of the Roman remains described by Smart Lethieullier were subsequently lost although Jack Elsden Tuffs undertook further archaeological work during the 1960s. A limited ground-penetrating radar survey was undertaken in February 2007 running north‚Äìsouth to a point just north of the refreshment hut and showed anomalies consistent with the buried foundations of a large masonry building running diagonally across the survey area. What appeared to be at least two rooms were visible which are considered likely to date from the Roman period.

It came into widespread use around 2013 and 2014 through social media and hip-hop and R&B; lyrics. It usually refers to a person's romantic partner, especially a boyfriend or girlfriend, but has also been used as a general term of affection for things, including inanimate objects. The term originated as an abbreviation of the word \\"baby\\" or \\"babe\\". It has been suggested that the term originated as an acronym for \\"before anyone else\\", but this is unlikely and this false etymology is probably an example of a backronym.  Popular usage  Several Internet memes have caused the widespread adoption of the term. \\"Bae caught me slippin featured people posting pictures of themselves pretending to be asleep that were supposedly taken by their partners. Lexicographer Grant Barrett wrote that this was \\"a kind of incompetent narcissistic guile which may capture the spirit of our age.\\" \\"Cooking for bae\\" featured people posting photos of failed dishes, often called \\"struggle meals\\", supposedly created for their partners. \\"You got a bae? Or nah?\\" originated on Vine and featured people chanting the phrase. The word's use in song lyrics dates to at least 2005, according to lyrics posted on Genius. In 2014, Pharrell Williams used it in the title of his single \\"Come Get It Bae\\". Chris Kelly of Fact wrote sarcastically that \\"nothing says timeless like a song with 'bae' in the title\\". The word was a runner-up for the Oxford Dictionaries 2014 Word of the Year. Barrett nominated it for the American Dialect Society's 2013 Word of the Year. The term has been adopted by corporate social media. The Twitter account Brands Saying Bae highlights the use of corporate Twitter accounts employing the term. The Verge labeled this use as an \\"appropriation of urban youth culture\\".

(born 21 April 1965 in Cologno al Serio, Italy) is a Catholic archbishop, the current apostolic administrator of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem and the former Franciscan Custos of the Holy Land. Pizzaballa has a reputation for personal integrity and simplicity; much of his pastoral work has been with Hebrew speakers and he has close ties to Jewish leaders while he has also been a vocal supporter of the Palestinians.  Early life and education  Pierbattista Pizzaballa was born in Cologno al Serio, Bergamo, on 21 April 1965, son of Pietro and Maria Maddalena Tadini. He entered the Franciscan minor seminary in Bologna in September 1976 and on 5 September 1984 entered their novitiate in La Verna. He made his first vows there on 7 September 1985 and his perpetual vows in Bologna on 4 October 1989. He earned his bachelor‚Äôs degree in theology at the Pontifical University Antonianum and was ordained a priest on 15 September 1990, in the Cathedral of Bologna by Cardinal Giacomo Biffi. He obtained his diploma in classical studies at the Archiepiscopal Seminary of Ferrara. He studied in Biblical Theology at the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum in Jerusalem in 1993 and then taught biblical Hebrew at the Franciscan Faculty of Biblical Science and Archeology in Jerusalem. Besides his native Italian, Pizzaballa speaks Hebrew, English, and Arabic.  Presbyterate  After completing his postgraduate studies, he taught Biblical Hebrew at the Franciscan Faculty of Biblical and archaeological sciences in Jerusalem, was responsible for the publication of the Roman Missal in Hebrew in 1995, and translated liturgical texts in Hebrew. He joined the Franciscans working at the Custody of the Holy Land in July 1999 and was responsible for the pastoral care of Hebrew-speaking Catholics. On 9 May 2001, he was appointed Superior of the Convent of Saints Simeon and Anna in Jerusalem. From 2005 to 2008 he served as Patriarchal Vicar. He was Custos of the Holy Land, that is, head of the Franciscan priory known as the Custody of the Holy Land, from May 2004 to April 2016, having been elected to a six- year term in May 2004, re-elected to a three-year term in March 2010, and reconfirmed for another three-year term in 2013. In 2008 he was appointed a Consultor in the Commission for relations with Judaism of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity. In June 2014 Pope Francis entrusted Pizzaballa with organizing the peace prayer in the Vatican gardens, which brought together Israeli President Shimon Peres and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. Episcopate On 24 June 2016, Pope Francis nominated him Apostolic Administrator sede vacante of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem and made him titular archbishop of Verbe. On 10 September 2016, he was consecrated bishop by Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, Archbishop Fouad Twal, and Bishop Francesco Beschi in the Bergamo Cathedral. The appointment of an Italian broke with tradition in that such posts are normally assigned to members of the ethnic group they predominantly serve, and his immediate predecessors had been a Palestinian and a Jordanian. In 2016 Pizzaballa joined the Order of the Holy Sepulchre and became its Pro Grand Prior. On 31 May 2017 he was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches. He heads the Board of Directors of Caritas Jerusalem.

The association aims to advocate for an EU-wide cloud-first public procurement policy and engage for a European Digital Single Market including the promotion of high-level security and data protection rules/standards as well as avoiding vendor lock-in. In June 2020, the association became one the 22 founding members of GAIA-X, announced by the German and French Ministers of Economic Affairs Peter Altmaier and Bruno Le Maire. CISPE joined forces with European cloud users and providers like BMW, EDF, Safran, Atos, Siemens, Bosch, OVHcloud, and Deutsche Telekom. The CISPE Data Protection Code of Conduct To help IaaS providers and their customers to comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which entered into force from 25 May 2018, CISPE released the CISPE Data Protection Code of Conduct. On top of the required compliance to meet with the GDPR, the code also ensures that IaaS customers can choose to have their data located and processed exclusively in Europe, and that the supplier will not re-use a customer's data. The compliance has to be declared by CISPs/IaaS providers service by service. The CISPE Code of Conduct was launched on 27 September 2016 at the European Parliament, and the first thirty services had been declared by the first CISPs/IaaS providers on 14 February 2017.

It is Indian Railways' proposed route for the Char Dham Railway to connect to the Chota Char Dham. It is geostrategic initiative of India to counter China's expansion. Railway routes The old Rishikesh railway station (RKSH) is located inside the town, so the railway line could not be extended through densely inhabited areas. Therefore, a new railway line was built from Virbhadra railway station and a new highly- facilitated Yog Nagari Rishikesh railway station (YNRK) was built in 2020. The 125 km long Rishikesh‚ÄìKarnaprayag route starts at Yog Nagari Rishikesh railway station at 385m AMSL and ends at Karnaprayag 825m AMSL. The ‚Çπ16,200 crore project will reduce Rishikesh to Karnaprayag travel time from 7 hours to 2.1 hours. It will have 16 bridges and 105 km or 85% of the project inside tunnels. A 15.1 km tunnel, reported to be the country's longest, will be built between Devprayag and Lachmoli on the route. As per the letter issued to Uttarakhand government by RVNL, the sites where railway stations will come up are ‚Äî Yog Nagari Rishikesh railway station in Rishikesh, Dehradun district, Srinagar, Tehri, Shivpuri and Byasi in Tehri district, Devprayag and Dungripanth (Dhari devi) in Pauri, Rudraprayag and Gholtir in Rudraprayag district, and Gaucher and Karanprayag in Chamoli district.

The caldera is part of the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex, a large ignimbrite province that is part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes. Pastos Grandes has erupted a number of ignimbrites through its history, some of which exceeded a volume of . After the ignimbrite phase, the lava domes of the Cerro Chascon-Runtu Jarita complex were erupted close to the caldera and along faults. The caldera is the site of a few lakes, some of which are fed by hot springs. A number of minerals, including lithium, are dissolved in the lakes.  Location  Pastos Grandes lies in the Sud Lipez Region of Bolivia. Geographically the area is part of the Altiplano, a high plateau bordered by the Cordillera Occidental and the Cordillera Oriental. The Altiplano contains two large salt pans, the Salar de Uyuni and Salar de Coipasa. The specific area of Pastos Grandes is remote and poorly accessible, the existence of the caldera was first established by satellite imagery.  Geology  = Regional = The region has been heavily affected by volcanism, including large ignimbrites and stratovolcanoes extending into Chile. Volcanic rocks include andesite, dacite and rhyodacite with the former dominating in the Chilean stratovolcanoes and the latter in the ignimbrites. The dry regional climate means that there is little erosion and that volcanic centres are well conserved. The surface covered by volcanic rocks amounts to about . Volcanic activity in the region is the consequence of the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate in the Peru-Chile Trench. This process has formed three main volcanic zones at the Andes, the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone and the Southern Volcanic Zone. Pastos Grandes is part of the Central Volcanic Zone along with about 50 volcanoes with recent activity and other ignimbrite generating volcanic centres. This ignimbritic volcanism began in the late Miocene and formed a large field known as the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex, a large volcanic province which clusters around the tripoint between Argentina, Bolivia and Chile. = Local = Pastos Grandes is a nested caldera which underwent repeated collapse in the past, most likely along defined sectors of its rim. It has been subdivided into two calderas, a larger Chuhuila caldera and the smaller Pastos Grandes caldera. The caldera is about wide and had a maximum depth of . Cerro Pastos Grandes is high and shows traces of a sector collapse. It might be a high resurgent dome and is flanked by lava domes on the north-northwestern, southwestern and southeastern side. The activity of Pastos Grandes may be associated with the ongoing development of a pluton underneath the caldera. Major regional faults running through the region have influenced the shape of the calderas, giving them an elliptic shape which is also evident at Pastos Grandes. Pastos Grandes has erupted calc-alkaline rocks which define a dacite suite. Eruption products of Pastos Grandes are rich in potassium. Minerals encountered in the rock include amphibole, biotite, plagioclase, quartz and sanidine. The magmas underwent slow evolution in the 1,000,000 years preceding each eruption. Plutonic rocks linked to Pastos Grandes were erupted from the Chascon-Runtu Jarita vents 94,000 - 85,000 years ago. = Eruption history = Three large ignimbrite-forming eruptions occurred at Pastos Grandes during its history. At first, it was assumed that large eruptions first occurred 8.1 million years ago, a second 5.6 million years and a third 2.3 million years ago. However, it is not clear which of any eruption formed the caldera. A number of ignimbrites has been attributed to Pastos Grandes, some of them may be different names for the same ignimbrite: * The 8.33 ¬± 0.15 million years old Sifon ignimbrite has a volume of over , but it is not certain that Pastos Grandes was actually the source. * The 6.2 ¬± 0.7 million years old Pastos Grandes I or Chuhuhuilla ignimbrite has with a volume of over . * The 3.3 ¬± 0.4 million years old Pastos Grandes II/Juvina ignimbrite has a volume of from the Juvina centre. * The 5.45 ¬± 0.02 million years old Chuhuilla ignimbrite with a volume of and was responsible for the first caldera-forming cycle. * The 2.89 ¬± 0.01 million years old Pastos Grandes ignimbrite that has a volume of and is part of the second caldera- forming cycle. The 6.1 million years old Carcote ignimbrite may also have originated here. The 5.22 ¬± 0.02 million years old Alota ignimbrite was also attributed to Pastos Grandes, although it originated in a centre northeast of the Pastos Grandes caldera known as Cerro Juvina. These ignimbrites crop out on the outside of the Pastos Grandes caldera, where they extend to distances of , but also cover parts of the caldera. Given the volumes involved, at least some of the eruptions are classified as 8 on the volcanic explosivity index. Pastos Grandes was volcanically active for a long time, more than many other Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex centres. Later more recent volcanic centres formed within the caldera, the youngest of these centres are relatively recent Such recent centres close to Pastos Grandes are Cerro Chao and Cerro Chascon- Runtu Jarita complex. The former of which lies on a lineament that appears to coincide with the caldera rim of Pastos Grandes, and the latter seems to rise from the ring fault of Pastos Grandes. but is apparently unrelated to the caldera. Cerro Chascon-Runtu Jarita is less than 100,000 years old according to argon-argon dating. This and ongoing geothermal manifestations suggest that volcanic activity may still occur at Pastos Grandes. Finally, Pastos Grandes and Cerro Guacha may be the heat source for the El Tatio geothermal field west of Pastos Grandes.  Lake  At an elevation of , Pastos Grandes contains a lake basin north of Cerro Pastos Grandes, which is wide and covers a surface area of about or at an elevation of .It only covers a fraction of the area of Pastos Grandes caldera. Surfaces of open water are concentrated on the eastern edge of the salt pan, in its very centre and isolated areas on the western side, these all form an intricated network. One of these open water surfaces on the western side of the lake basin is known as Laguna Caliente, while another square-shaped lake in the southern part of the caldera is known as Laguna Khara. Sometimes after heavy precipitation, these open water surfaces can join into a ring lake around the centre. Intermittent streams drain the catchment of Pastos Grandes and reach the salt pan; the longest flow through the southeastern parts of the catchment. The entire drainage basin of the lake has a surface area of . Apart from surface streams, springs contribute to the water budget of Pastos Grandes. Hot springs are active or were recently active on the western side of the salt pan, where temperatures of have been measured. On the western shore, colder springs predominate. Earlier lacustrine episodes left a layer of beige mud behind. This mud freezes during the winter months to a certain depth and cryoturbation has formed polygonal structures as well as large cracks in the crust on its surface. Salts found within the salt pan include gypsum, halite and ulexite. The brines are rich in boron, lithium and sodium chloride, the salt pan has been considered a potential site for lithium and potassium mining. Salt contents range . The salt chemistry is strongly influenced by the climate; the precipitation of mirabilite due to cold and evaporation of water cause changes in the composition of the waters. At numerous points, calcite pisoliths are found at Pastos Grandes, usually associated with active or former springs. Rimstone dams and sinter terraces are also encountered close to inactive springs. All these cave formations encountered at Pastos Grandes are caused by the precipitation of calcite from oversaturated waters at the surface. What drives the loss of carbon dioxide and thus the oversaturation is not clear but may involve photosynthesis by algae. Algae and diatoms grow within the open waters in Pastos Grandes, the diatoms being represented by oligohaline species such as some Fragilaria and Navicularia species. Different water surfaces are dominated by different diatom species, distinctions that are only partly mediated by different salinities. Animal species found within the lakes include amphipods, elmids and leeches in freshwater and by Cricotopus in saltwater. Additional animals are Euplanaria dorotocephala, Chironomidae, Corixidae, Cyclopoida, Ephydridae, Harpacticoida, Orchestidae, Ostracoda and Tipulidae species. Similar but different animal species have been found in other local lakes, indicating that they are largely separate systems. The animal flora of such Altiplano lakes is not very diverse, probably due to their relative youth and the harsh and often highly variable climates of the past in the region. Pastos Grandes is one of many endorheic lakes that cover the region. The neighbouring Altiplano was formerly covered by lakes as well during the Pleistocene. After they dried up, the Salar de Uyuni and Salar de Coipasa were left behind.  Climate  The area of Pastos Grandes has a summer wet climate, with most of the precipitation falling during a wet season in December‚ÄìMarch. An estimate for the total precipitation is about . That is, the climate is arid and evaporation rates can reach about . Insolation is high and the temperatures can vary by as much as . During winter, they can drop as far as .

The explosion was caused by a dynamite allegedly kept by Meiring inside his hotel room. Background On May 16, 2002, an explosion occurred at the Evergreen Hotel in Davao City, particularly inside the room which was stayed by American oncologist, Michael Meiring who was reportedly doing treasure hunting in the country since the 1990s. The explosion was caused by a dynamite he was allegedly keeping inside the room. Meiring was confined at the Davao Doctors Hospital after he sustained third-degree burns and had his leg amputated. On May 19, 2002 Agents from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reportedly brought Meiring out of Davao City to Manila via Subic Air through chartered flight allegedly arranged by the US Embassy in Manila. By May 22, he is already confined at the Makati Medical Center which is one of the two hospitals accredited by Meiring's medical insurance. Meiring's insurance could not cover the American's bills at the Davao Medical Center which is the reportedly the reason for his immediate transfer. =Victim= Michael Terrence Meiring is a former citizen of South Africa of British descent who reportedly fled the African country during the later years of the Apartheid era. He reportedly practiced his profession as a doctor for the South African police while being affiliated with the African National Congress of Nelson Mandela. David Hawthorn, a close friend of Meiring claimed that his friend confessed of giving of a box of old US federal notes to the Mandela government. The box was one of 12 with each estimated to contain $500 million each. Meiring secured permits from the Fidel Ramos administration to hunt for treasure in sunken American and Japanese ships. He later partnered with a powerful Manila-based group which has links to James Rowe. According to American intelligence analyst Dan Crawford, Rowe himself is linked to a Nevada white supremacist and tax revolt group which has connection the Neo-Nazi Party in the United States and the Fifth Reich group of Germany. Meiring's American friends suspected that the Manila group may have conspired against him. According to both Hawthorn and secretary Silvya Durante, Meiring was feared for his life who reportedly says \\"it has to do with the treasure\\". Legacy The explosion is attributed to President Rodrigo Duterte's hostility towards the United States. In May 2016, Duterte's spokesman Peter Lavi√±a cites the incident that involve Meiring as the reason for Duterte's negative sentiment towards the United States. Meiring was brought out of the country supposedly by US Embassy officials despite facing charges of possessing explosives which Duterte took offense against. He called the alleged act a disrespect against the sovereignty of the Philippines. Duterte says that he has received no apology from the United States for the incident. Duterte was still Mayor of Davao City at the time of the incident. At that time, Duterte said that he holds Meiring responsible for the incident saying that he refused to cooperate with the police when they made a search in his room before the explosion.

The key is to be independent so that opinions on the technical aspects of the project are not biased either in favor of the lenders or the developer/owners. In order to maintain independence, the Independent Engineer is typically selected by the lender, but paid by the developer/owner. The role of the Independent Engineer is to provide an independent technical assessment of a project or technical due diligence. The qualifications of an Independent Engineer are unusual in that in addition to understanding the engineering aspects of a project, the Independent Engineer must also be well versed in the business aspects of project financing. This includes the assessment of the technical aspects of major contracts such as EPC Contracts, Power Purchase Agreement, Off-take Agreements, Long Term Service Agreements, O&M; Agreements, etc. Furthermore, the Independent Engineer will review the technical inputs (i.e. output, efficiency, O&M; expenses, availability, etc.) to the financial model used by the lender and the developer/owner to justify the financing of the project.  Scope of work  While the role of the Independent Engineer is similar to an Owner's engineer, they are distinctly different. An Independent Engineer will deal with the lenders and legal counsel on a regular basis to evaluate the financial health of the project as well as the technical aspects. Conversely, the Owner's Engineer is more often dealing directly with the engineer of record, the constructor, and equipment suppliers with a focus on ensuring that the technical details of the project meet the specifications. Typical scopes of work for an Independent Engineer often include: * Fatal flaw and/or technology reviews * Project reviews to support project financing ** Review of the engineering design ** Assessment of project participants and the project site ** Technology review ** Contract reviews (non-legal) ** Operations and Maintenance review ** Environmental review ** Review of the technical inputs to the financial model * Construction Monitoring ** Budget tracking and draw certifications ** Monitoring of equipment and material compliance with specifications ** Schedule and Budget Analysis ** Project completion review and completion certifications * Performance Test Monitoring * Annual operational and maintenance review See also * Owner's engineer References External links Category:Construction management Category:Engineering occupations ","title":"Independent Engineer"},{"id":"54051275","text":"Davandai is an ancient percussion instrument played during the rituals in some South Indian temples, most famously the Meenakshi Temple at Madurai.It is usually accompanied with Nagaswaram and it is used instead of Tavil Davandai is a two-faced drum shaped like an hourglass.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Historical context Battle Point was the site of Fort Village and an Odawa Indian burial ground, likely used for a span of about 20 years between 1815 and 1835. The Odawa at the site were led by Chief Onamontapay. In 1836, the Treaty of Washington ceded the lands north of the Grand River to the United States. As a result, the Potawatomi Chief Shiawassee, then living upriver at the confluence of Crockery Creek and the Grand River, called a council at Battle Point, where he attempted to induce the Odawa living there and other local groups to revolt and massacre European settlers. However, the Rev. William Ferry and his Indian friends successfully defused the situation. However, Chief Shiawassee and his Potawatomi soon moved out of the area, and the village at Battle Point was abandoned by the Odawa at about the same time. However, some Odawa families continued to live in the area, and a Native American school was established on Battle Point in 1855. These families continued to live in the Battle Point area as late as 1878. Archaeological excavations The burial sites on Battle Point were forgotten for many years. However, the site was brought to the attention of amateur archaeologists in the 1950s, when erosion from the cutting action of the nearby river uncovered some of the burial sites. Five of these were excavated at that time by the Coffinberry chapter of the Michigan Archaeological Society. Nine further graves were excavated in 1971-2 by researchers from Grand Valley State University. The artifacts recovered from the burial sites were primarily American and European trade goods. These included utilitarian goods such as knives, firesteels, gunflints, axes, and kettles. Also included were decorative goods such as silver brooches and bracelets, clay pipes, and glass beads.

Such variations may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female. Intersex infants and children may be subject to stigma, discrimination and human rights violations, including in education, employment and medical settings. Human rights violations in medical settings are increasingly recognized as human rights abuses.

It questions the medical necessity of such treatments, patients' ability to consent, and a weak evidence base. The report recommends a range of guiding principles for medical treatment, including ensuring patient autonomy in decision-making, ensuring non-discrimination, accountability and access to remedies. =Council of Europe Issue Paper, 2015= In a wide-ranging first detailed analysis on intersex health and human rights issues by an international institution, the Council of Europe published an Issue Paper entitled Human rights and intersex people in May 2015. The document highlighted an historic lack of attention to intersex human rights, stating that current social and biomedical understandings of sex and gender make intersex people \\"especially vulnerable\\" to human rights breaches. The report cited previous reports from San Franscisco, the Swiss National Advisory Commission on Biomedical Ethics and the Australian Senate. The Commissioner for Human Rights made eight recommendations. For this first time, these recognized a right to not undergo sex assignment treatment. =UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights report, 2015= In 2015, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) described human rights violations against intersex people: The OHCHR acknowledged Australia and Malta as \\"the first countries to expressly prohibit discrimination against intersex persons,\\" and Malta as \\"the first State to prohibit sex-assignment surgery or treatment on intersex minors without their informed consent.\\" It called on UN member states to protect intersex persons from discrimination, and address violence by: * \\"Banning ‚Äúconversion‚Äù therapy, involuntary treatment, forced sterilization and forced genital and anal examinations;\\" * \\"Prohibiting medically unnecessary procedures on intersex children\\" =WHO report, \\"Sexual health, human rights and the law\\", 2015= In June 2015, the World Health Organization published a major report on sexual and reproductive rights and the law.

The experts also called for the investigation of human rights abuses, access to standing to file compensation claims, and the implementation of anti-discrimination measures. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights also launched a website, United Nations for Intersex Awareness. =Committee on Bioethics of the Council of Europe, 2017= In January 2017, the Committee on Bioethics of the Council of Europe published a report on children's rights entitled, \\"The Rights of Children in Biomedicine: Challenges posed by scientific advances and uncertainties\\". The report was critical of the lack of evidence for early intersex medical interventions, stating that, on \\"the scientific question of whether intervention is necessary, only three medical procedures have been identified as meeting that criteria in some infants: (1) administration of endocrine treatment to prevent fatal salt-loss in some infants, (2) early removal of streak gonads in children with gonadal dysgenesis, and (3) surgery in rare cases to allow exstrophic conditions in which organs protrude from the abdominal wall or impair excretion\\".  National and State reports and statements  =San Francisco Human Rights Investigation, 2005= The 2005 Human Rights Investigation into the Medical \\"Normalization\\" of Intersex People, by the Human Rights Commission of the City and County of San Francisco is thought \\"likely to be the first human rights report into the treatment of intersex people, certainly in the English language.\\" =Report of Swiss National Advisory Council on Biomedical Ethics, 2012= In late 2012, the Swiss National Advisory Commission on Biomedical Ethics reported on intersex. The Commission report makes a strong case against medical intervention for \\"psychosocial\\" reasons: The report is notable for making a clear apology for damage done to intersex people in the past, and up until the present. It recommends deferring all \\"non-trivial\\" surgeries which have \\"irreversible consequences\\". The report also recommended criminal sanction for non-medically necessary genital surgeries. =Senate Committee inquiry, Australia, 2013= In October 2013, the Australian Senate published a report entitled Involuntary or coerced sterilisation of intersex people in Australia. The Senate found that \\"normalising\\" surgeries are taking place in Australia, often on infants and young children, with preconceptions that it described as \\"disturbing\\": \\"Normalising appearance goes hand in hand with the stigmatisation of difference\\". They commented: \\"...normalisation surgery is more than physical reconstruction. The surgery is intended to deconstruct an intersex physiology and, in turn, construct an identity that conforms with stereotypical male and female gender categories\\" and: \\"Enormous effort has gone into assigning and 'normalising' sex: none has gone into asking whether this is necessary or beneficial. Given the extremely complex and risky medical treatments that are sometimes involved, this appears extremely unfortunate.\\" The report makes 15 recommendations, including ending cosmetic genital surgeries on infants and children and providing for legal oversight of individual cases. Organisation Intersex International Australia welcomed the report, saying that, Reports by human rights NGOs =Amnesty International report on Denmark and Germany, 2017= In 2017, Amnesty International published a report condemning \\"non-emergency, invasive and irreversible medical treatment with harmful effects\\" on children born with variations of sex characteristics in Germany and Denmark.

Amnesty International reported that \\"there are no binding guidelines for the treatment of intersex children\\". =Human Rights Watch/interACT report on U.S. children, 2017= In July 2017, Human Rights Watch and interACT published a report on medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex children, ‚ÄúI Want to Be Like Nature Made Me‚Äù, based on interviews with intersex persons, families and physicians. The report states that: The report found that intersex medical interventions persist as default advice from doctors to parents, despite some change in some regions of the U.S. and claims of improved surgical techniques, resulting in an uneven situation where care differs and a lack of standards of care, but paradigms for care are still based on socio-cultural factors including expectations of \\"normality\\" and evidence in support of surgeries remains lacking. \\"Nearly every parent\\" in the study reported pressure for their children to undergo surgery, and many reported misinformation. The report calls for a ban on \\"surgical procedures that seek to alter the gonads, genitals, or internal sex organs of children with atypical sex characteristics too young to participate in the decision, when those procedures both carry a meaningful risk of harm and can be safely deferred.\\" The report was acknowledged as an important contribution to research by the American Academy of Pediatrics, Associated Press reported on the report and opposition to a ban by CARES Foundation.

Chefs preparing ramen dishes at a ramen shop in Tokyo Japanese ramen shops specialize in ramen dishes and exist throughout Japan. Many ramen restaurants have limited seating, and some only have a bar with stools for patrons to eat at. At some ramen establishments, patrons place their order and remit payment at a ticket machine located in front of the shop, and then wait in line for their food. When a seat becomes available, patrons give the server their ticket and then wait for their food. This system can serve to keep the line moving in an expedient manner. Other ramen shops provide sit-down service whereby patrons are provided with a menu and order fare from a server.

Such false self-employment is often a way to circumvent social welfare and employment legislation, for example by avoiding employer's social security and income tax contributions.http://www.hudsoncontract.co.uk/news-resources/2016/jan/what-is- false-self-employment/ While a modern \\"gig economy\\" encourages more casual employment practices in the interests of labour flexibility, the extent to which this disguises precarious employment and denial of rights is of growing concern to authorities.Robert Booth, Ministers order HMRC crackdown on ‚Äògig economy‚Äô firms, The Guardian, Oct. 20, 2016.Vanessa Houlder and Sarah O‚ÄôConnor, Revenue cracks down on ‚Äòfalse self-employment‚Äô, Financial Times, Oct. 21, 2016. There is a grey area of self-employed persons who rely heavily on a single customer while legitimately being independent.U. Muehlberger, Dependent Self-Employment: Workers on the Border between Employment and Self- Employment (Palgrave, 2007).  Principle  A salaried-work relation hidden behind a false pretense of self-employment is in some jurisdictions a violation of and a non‚Äëcompliance with labour law. For social security, the falsely self-employed is declared not to be subject to employment law, but actually works under an employer's authority in a subordinate relationship, with the same conditions as his salaried colleagues but without any employment contract.Pierre Beyens, avocat au barreau de Bruxelles aupr√®s de van Cutsem Wittamer Marnef & Partners When a salaried-work relation is hidden under such a false pretense, there is a violation of law and both parties expose themselves to sanctions. The constitutive elements of an employment contract typically are:Pierre Beyens, avocat au barreau de Bruxelles aupr√®s de van Cutsem Wittamer Marnef & Partners * Work performed; * for remuneration; * in a subordinate relationship.  In Belgium  The (Belgian) legislator considers the following elements to define a subordinate relationship: # No worker's participation in the company's profits or losses; # No proper capital investments in the company; # No responsibility or decision‚Äëtaking power in the company; # The certainty of getting a regular payment; # The fact of having just a single and unique customer company; # The fact of having no personal workers/the fact of not being an employer; # The fact of not being able to organise one's working period; # The existence of in-house control procedures, with related sanctions; # No decision‚Äëtaking power concerning customers‚Äô invoicing. Labour law tends in a jurisprudential way to view self- employment as false when many of the above elements are present. The ministers‚Äô council (the Belgian Cabinet) on 5 May 2006 examined a legislative proposal (a bill) which no longer refers to a ‚Äúfaux ind√©pedant‚Äù (read: falsely self-employed person), but to \\"qualification adequate de la nature des relations de travail\\" (\\"appropriate qualification about the nature of relationships at work\\"), whether salaried or independent. The bill came from the minister of small business, Sabine Laruelle (MR political party ‚Äì liberal), and the minister of social affairs, Rudy Demotte (PS political party ‚Äì socialist). The governmental declaration of July 2004 already planned such a bill. The legislative proposal confirms the general principles stated by the jurisprudence and the Court of Cassation: to have an employment contract, there must be a relationship of authority and subordination; (and) to have a contract between independent actors, there must be no such relationship. This reflects the party's intention as expressed in their programme. Elements such as freedom to organise one's working time/period, freedom to organise one's work and the possibility to have a hierarchical control allow to evaluate the existence or not of any hierarchical relationship. Moreover, this establishes legal certainty: the current system of freedom of contract between parties is confirmed, the potential problems are framed either in specific sectors, or in individual situations. In Britain =Construction industry= A British trade union UCATT which specialized in the construction industry has expressed concern that false self-employment was being used by many British employers to evade taxes and engage workers without having to respect employment rights and entitlements such as holiday pay, sick pay and pensions. In their opinion, whilst the practice was immoral, it was not, in their view, necessarily illegal. The UK taxation arrangement known as the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) allowed registered companies to deduct tax at source and thus avoid employing workers directly as their regular or casual employee who would thus have acquired legal employee rights. Instead casual staff could be assumed to be sub-contractors who were falsely supposed to be self-employed, and thus responsible for paying their own tax and social security contributions. If such persons were not registered as self-employed, they would thereby be liable for unlawfully evading their legal obligations. =Offshore Oil= The British Government's HM Revenue and Customs service found in 2013 evidence that some companies and employment businesses connected with the offshore oil industry were using employment intermediaries to disguise the employment of their workers as self-employment, primarily to avoid paying employers National Insurance contributions and to reduce the costs associated with workers‚Äô employment rights.HM Revenue and Customs:Onshore employment intermediaries: false self-employment Spain The Spanish Ministry of Employment is trying (as of mid August 2017) to address commercial accounting agencies who invoice employers on behalf of regular employees falsely presented self-employed persons to evade or minimise their tax and social security obligations (Self employed people are known as aut√≥nomos in Spanish, and usually raise their own invoices for irregular work assignments themselves).

Coonrod is known for her modern adaptations of classic plays by William Shakespeare and other playwrights. She often chooses to direct plays produced from unusual sources such as lesser-known works by notable playwrights, adaptations from non-dramatic sources, and the writings of notable figures in history. Coonrod founded two theater companies: Arden Party (1987‚Äì1997) and Compagnia de' Colombari (2004‚Äìpresent). She has also directed several productions presented by Theatre for a New Audience. Her plays have been staged at several notable theaters including the Joseph Papp Public Theater, New York Theatre Workshop, Ohio Theater, American Repertory Theatre, and Folger Theatre. Early life Born to an Italian mother from Florence and an American father from Indianapolis, Coonrod grew up living between her parents' native homes in Europe and the Midwestern United States. She earned her undergraduate degree in English from Gordon College. Career Coonrod began her career as a teacher at an all-boys Catholic school in Monmouth County, New Jersey where she also ran the school's theater program. She later enrolled in a graduate theater program at Columbia University. While working on her master's degree, in 1987, she founded an experimental Shakespeare theatre company, Arden Party. First based in an old movie theater in Sandy Hook, New Jersey, Arden Party gained wider notoriety when, in 1988, the company moved to the Ohio Theater, then located in SoHo, Manhattan. By 1996, Coonrod had staged more than 20 adaptations of classic plays. In the late 1990s, Coonrod began earning critical acclaim for her productions of more obscure works by the English playwright William Shakespeare, such as Henry VI (1996) and King John (2000). She also directed other uncommon plays by lesser- known European playwrights and adaptations from atypical sources. Coonrod founded her second New York-based theater company, Compagnia de' Colombari in 2004‚Äîalso made up of a small ensemble cast of actors, musicians, and theatre crew‚Äîwith whom she produces the majority of her later plays. Her experimental theatrical style sometimes calls for the musicians and stage crew to operate in full view of the audience, serving as part of the ensemble cast. Her plays often break the fourth wall to include the audience. In her plays, the cast of actors often play multiple roles, as in Henry VI, or the same role is fractured among several actors, as in Merchant of Venice and texts&beheadings;/ElizabethR. Coonrod describes her trade as \\"staging sculpture\\" because it combines two of her artistic interests‚Äîvisual depiction and the narrative form. She frequently uses unusual seating structures like in the 2014 production of Tempest where Coonrod placed the stage between two sets of audiences facing each other, reminiscent of the school gymnasiums where she first directed plays with her young Catholic school students. Coonrod also stages her plays in unusual locales and settings that come from the script's themes. There were performances of the Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice in the piazza of the play's eponymous city in a neighborhood that once was a Jewish ghetto. Her theater company later reproduced the play at a high-security prison in Padova with \\"only actors and inmates in a bare room\\". Works = Arden Party = In 1996, Coonrod staged two plays, Victor, or Children Take Over by French surrealist playwright Roger Vitrac and Henry VI by Shakespeare. Victor, or Children Take Over was staged in Spring 1996 at the Ohio Theater and was adapted with a translation by Coonrod, Aaron Etra, Esther Sobin, and Frederic Maurin. The play was a critical success. Ben Brantley of The New York Times described it as \\"a smashing (in every sense of the word) revival\\" and \\"a subversive take on haute bourgeois chic.\\" Henry VI was staged at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, opening on December 18, 1996. Part of the New York Shakespeare Festival, Coonrod's adaptation condensed the tripartite play into two three-hour segments, \\"Part I: The Edged Sword\\" and \\"Part II: Black Storm.\\" In December 1997, Coonrod directed Christmas at the Ivanovs', a rarely performed absurdist play by Aleksandr Vvedensky from 1938 which she translated with Julia Listengarten. According to The New York Times' Peter Marks, Coonrod was \\"an excellent match\\" for the play and turned \\"the acerbic piece into an out-there fairy tale.\\" He described the rendition as \\"brisk and lighthearted even when the playwright is at his most nihilistic.\\" = 2000‚Äì2005, Theatre for a New Audience = Coonrod later directed Shakespeare's King John, presented by the Theatre for a New Audience (TFANA), which opened on January 30, 2000, at The American Place Theatre. The following year, Coonrod's 2001 dramatization of the triptych of short stories Everything That Rises Must Converge unconventionally follows the text \\"word for word.\\" This included \\"the attributions‚Äîhe said, she said‚Äîand often the [narrator]'s omniscient intrusions that reveal a character's mind.\\" The author Flannery O'Connor died in 1964, and her estate made strict adherence to the words in the text a precondition for allowing the dramatization to be staged. According to The Village Voice, \\"the constraints benefited the production, freeing the actors for more \\"conceptual interpretations of the action.\\" Bruce Weber of The New York Times was critical of the staging in the third and titular act, describing it as aggressive \\"with a tone that suggests directorial interpretation\\". Yet Weber still found the play as a whole \\"rather fascinating\\" as an experiment. Everything That Rises Must Converge was shown again at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan in 2015. Coonrod directed Julius Caesar which opened in January 2003 at the Lucille Lortel Theatre and was presented by the TFANA. She adapts the play for modern viewers and alludes to present day politics by costuming the actors in Western-style business suit and tie. According to Weber, \\"Coonrod has encouraged a weaselly aspect from the performers‚Ä¶ making the usurping senators seem like gossip mongers in the halls of Enron or lackeys in a Karl Rove strategy session\\" with \\"a conspiracy more venal than noble. And it works very well at first.\\" Weber notes, as the play approaches the assassination in the finale, it \\"very quickly descends into bombastic melodrama.\\" Coonrod directed her third play for the Theater for a New Audience when she staged a production of Coriolanus by Shakespeare at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater at John Jay College in 2005. The play was given a stripped-down industrial-chic motif on an almost bare stage. The New York Times Charles Isherwood was critical of the play's lack of vivid presentation which he asserted Coriolanus needs \\"to come fully to life\\". John Heilpern's review for The New York Observer was more receptive, crediting Coonrod for \\"refusing to talk down to Shakespeare (and therefore to audiences).\\" Heilpern noted: = Compagnia de' Colombari = For 2010's More Or Less I Am, Coonrod drew inspiration from Walt Whitman's 1855 poem \\"Song of Myself\\". The play was performed publicly at several locations in New York including Grant's Tomb and Joe's Pub at The Public Theatre. The production is a mixture of \\"dance, music, and spoken word.\\" Earlier that year, Coonrod had directed the Romanian poet Andr√°s Visky's play I Killed My Mother at Theater Y in Chicago. The play was produced again at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in New York in 2012. Coonrod returned to The Public Theater in 2011 to direct another of Shakespeare's earlier plays, Love's Labour's Lost. Trimming down some of the \\"obsolete wordplay about Latin declensions\\", Coonrod's adaptation of the play‚Äîabout four men attempting to remain celibate to focus on academic pursuits‚Äîcuts out several of the subplots and relies more on slapstick humor. In 2014, Coonrod directed one of Shakespeare's later plays, Tempest, staged at the La MaMa. The audience for this production were arranged in seats on three sides of the unadorned stage designed by Riccardo Hernandez but with \\"a layered soundscape of whistles, echoes, coos, breaths\\" coming from all around them and Christopher Akerlind's ominous lighting production. The first of three productions of the play at La MaMa that year, the play was two hours long with no intermissions. The New York Times described it as \\"a beautiful production\\" even though it takes \\"time to find a momentum it can sustain. It's not until the appearance of Stephano that things get going.\\" Coonrod's other 2014 production, Orfeo in Orvieto, based on Claudio Monteverdi's L'Orfeo, was staged in the historic courtyard of the Palazzo Simoncelli in Orvieto. The opera included American and Italian performers from the Umbrian city. In texts&beheadings;/ElizabethR (2015), Coonrod \\"deconstructs to reconstruct\\" the public image and cultural depictions of Elizabeth I of England. The script compiled by Coonrod consists of the queen's own words written \\"in personal and public letters, prayers and state speeches.\\" The play is divided into four elements: Strategy, Survival, Prayers, and Sovereignty; each representing a force of influence on the queen's life and represented by a different actress inhabiting the central role of the protagonist. Coonrod produced the play with Compagnia de' Colombari and staged it, in 2015, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Folger Theatre in Washington, D.C., and the Wesleyan University Center for the Arts. After the performance of Coonrod's The Merchant in Venice (2016) in the play's titular city, a mock trial was staged with several judges, including Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The panel heard appeals on the court case central to the plot. In 2017, The Merchant of Venice, under its original title and again with Coonrod's direction, was staged at Montclair State University's Alexander Kasser Theater. In her adaptations of this Shakespearean play, Coonrod chose to split the role of Shylock among five actors, male and female. The New York Times described the director's use of fragmentation to unravel the mystery of the controversial character as \\"surprisingly effective.\\" For the Theatre at St. Clement in New York in 2018, Coonrod directed Babette's Feast from a play by Rose Courtney based on the 1950 short story Anecdotes of Destiny written by Isak Dinesen and published in Ladies' Home Journal. According to The New York Times, the production shows how Coonrod is not particularly interested in realism. Unlike the 1987 Danish feature film Babette's Feast, the director forgoes the culinary elements of the play and lets the audience imagine the preparation for the banquet.  Personal life  Coonrod is married to Jonathan Geballe.

After earning a medical degree and practicing in Paris for seven years, she returned to Poland and practiced medicine in Warsaw. Active in the women's movement and the push for expansion of women's rights, she later served on the Warsaw City Council and was involved in social endeavors to improve both health and women's political involvement. One such initiative was opening the first birth control clinic in Poland and another was the founding of the Association of Polish Female Physicians. She participated in international feminist conventions and Congresses, including serving as president of the international Little Entente of Women. Early life Justyna Budzi≈Ñska was born on 12 September 1867 in Suwa≈Çki which at the time was part of the Russian Empire, located in the (), to Jadwiga and Alfons Budzi≈Ñski. Her father was a veterinarian who participated in the January Uprising against Russian occupation of Poland and was subsequently deported to Siberia where he died. Forced to earn her own living from an early age, Budzi≈Ñska was sent to Warsaw and attended a girls' boarding school, completing her high school education after attending as a part-time student. Career Upon receiving her degree, Budzi≈Ñska began working as a governess on a private estate in Ukraine and ran a secret school to teach village children. Saving her money, by 1892 she had earned enough to continue her studies in Paris and moved there to enroll in medical school. Like other students, she participated in a wide variety of social programs including attending lectures, distributing publications from the Polish underground, helping Polish √©migr√©s in France, and joining the Foreign Association of Polish Socialists. She did not long remain a part of the socialist movement officially, but was an adherent to their ideology for the majority of her life. Around 1894, Budzi≈Ñska married Stanis≈Çaw Tylicki and subsequently the couple had two children, Stanis≈Çaw and Wanda. Graduating with her medical degree in 1898, Budzi≈Ñska-Tylicka set up a medical practice in the village of Ebripill near Meaux. Her success allowed her to purchase the practice of a deceased physician and maintain the clients for seven years. In 1905, the couple decided to return with their family to Poland, but were barred from living anywhere except in the Grand Duchy of Cracow because of their former ties with the socialist movement. Budzi≈Ñska-Tylicka became involved in various associations aimed at social improvement, including the Society for Child Welfare, Society for Elementary Schools and women's rights issues along with . Within two years, the family moved to Warsaw, where she found work at the Hospital of the Holy Spirit, once her foreign degree had been accepted by Russian authorities. Budzi≈Ñska-Tylicka worked in the temperance movement and was active in both hygiene and tuberculosis programs. She was one of the first women physicians to work in girl's education. Between 1910 and 1912, she participated in hygiene classes at the Popielewska- Roszkowska Female Gymnasium. In addition to her hospital work and private practice, Budzi≈Ñska-Tylicka wrote pamphlets on hygiene and pedagogy, women's health, and legal protections for women. She supported women's equality and was a member of the Union for the Equal Rights of Polish Women (), which had been founded by Paulina Kuczalska-Reinschmit. In 1916, Budzi≈Ñska-Tylicka left Holy Spirit and helped establish a field hospital working with soldiers during World War I and continued her private practice, which mostly focused on respiratory ailments. She lost her son who was an officer during the conflict, which was very difficult for her, as her marriage was not a happy one and she was not close to her daughter, turning instead to social issues. Polish women gained the right to vote in 1918 and soon after the war ended Budzi≈Ñska- Tylicka co-founded, along with Teodora Mƒôczkowska and Zofia Daszy≈Ñska- Goli≈Ñska, the Progressive Women‚Äôs Political Club () with the goal of educating women in exercising their voting rights. She also served as a vice president of the Polish branch of the International Socialist Women's Committee. As part of her activities, she joined the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), attended the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA) in Geneva and three years later, in 1923 attended the IWSA Rome Conference, where she joined with Alexandrina Cantacuzino and others in forming the Little Entente of Women (LEW). In 1919, Budzi≈Ñska-Tylicka joined the Polish Society for Social Medicine. From 1919 through 1934, she served as a member of Warsaw City Council, initially as a representative of the KPKP and after 1922 as a representative of the Polish Socialist Party. In 1925‚Äì1926, she founded the Association of Polish Female Physicians ) and became its vice president. In 1927, Budzi≈Ñska-Tylicka was instrumental in establishing courses to train nurses to work in child care centers for businesses and factories and that same year, she became the president of the LEW. Between 1929 and 1931, she worked on the board of the Chamber of Medicine to promote maternal protections and fight against alcoholism and poverty. She advocated for the legalization of abortion and disapproved of punishing women who had terminated their pregnancies. On 25 October 1931, Budzi≈Ñska-Tylicka opened the first birth control center in Poland and became the director of the facility. Later that same year, she was arrested for participating in a political demonstration, but was released after filing an appeal. In 1935, she was involved in agitating for the closure of Bereza Kartuska prison, which housed political prisoners and granting them amnesty. That same year, she became the president of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Death and legacy Budzi≈Ñska-Tylicka died unexpectedly from a cerebral hemorrhage on 8 April 1936. Her writings on nutrition and hygiene were widely influential in Poland, as she advocated that a healthy diet, with less meat and more vegetables improved overall health. She also advocated that by improving the health of expectant mothers and the sanitary conditions of their surroundings the mortality of children would improve.

Legacy  Soliton double rod pendulum animation showing chaotic behavior Lakshmanan has done extensive research in the field of nonlinear dynamics, especially on solitons and chaos theory. One of the first Indian theoretical physicists to use differential geometrical methods such as Painlev√© transcendents and Lie theory for studying the integrability of chaotic systems, he demonstrated unsuspected transformations and proposed variables for exposing hidden nonlinear structures. Collaborating with K. Murali and Leon O. Chua, he developed a non-autonomous chaotic circuit, Murali‚ÄîLakshmanan-Chua (MLC) Circuit which they detailed in an article, Controlling and Synchronization of Chaos in the Simplest Dissipative Non-autonomous Circuit, published in International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos in 1995. He studied Heisenberg spin chains with respect to its solitons and elucidated the collision of optical solitons in multimode fibres as well as demonstrated the energy sharing between them. The body of his work is reported to have assisted in the development applications based on ferromagnetism and nonlinear optics. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and the online article repository of Indian Academy of Sciences has listed 256 of them. Besides, he has published nine books which include \\"Nonlinear Dynamics: Integrability, Chaos and Patterns\\", \\"Chaos in Nonlinear Oscillators: Controlling and Synchronization\\", \\"Symmetries and singularity structures\\", \\"Dynamics of Nonlinear Time-Delay Systems\\" and \\"Nonlinear Evolution Equations: Integrability and Spectral Methods\\". His work has drawn citations from other scientists and he has mentored over 25 doctoral and many master's scholars, which has helped develop a school of research on nonlinear dynamics. Lakshmanan founded the Centre for Nonlinear Dynamics of Bharathidasan University and served as the head of the centre for almost a decade and half from 1992 to 2006. He is a member of the editorial board of International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos and has been associated with many other journals such as Advances in Mathematical Physics, Physics News, Journal of Nonlinear Mathematical Physics, Indian Journal of Physics and Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A.

It depicts the Greek goddess Persephone, resting nude by a tree in a rural Midwestern setting. Benton, dressed in farmer's clothes, plays the role of Pluto and peeks from behind the tree. It was painted at the Kansas City Art Institute where Benton worked as a teacher. Several of Benton's students also made their own versions of the subject. A reporter from Life visited Benton in his studio during his work on this painting and his other famous nude painting from the same period, Susanna and the Elders. The model for Persephone was Imogene Bruton. Bruton modeled for students at the school in the 1930s but abandoned modeling after completing Persephone. She married in 1940, and was later unwilling to talk about her time as a model. The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City bought the painting in 1986. The museum paid $2,500,000, which was a new record for a Benton painting. The painting inspired Imogen and Twinka at Yosemite, a 1974 photograph by Judy Dater.

He has composed music for over 30 films and TV series as well as additional scores for Theatre and Dance pieces. In 2014, he was nominated twice at Sweden¬¥s Guldbagge Awards in which his soundtrack for the film Faro won the award. He also won a Gudbagge in 2009 for his score for the film Everlasting Moments. He has recorded and released numerous solo and collaboration records, include Hydra‚Äôs Dream, with Anna Von Hausswolff; Maailma, with cult Finnish songwriter Lau Nau; and has collaborated live with producer and musician Samuli Kosminen.  Life and career  Bye was brought up by his mother, renowned Swedish actress Birgitta Andersson, while his father was Norwegian playwright Anders Bye. At the age of 20, Stockholm‚Äôs celebrated Cinematheque Theatre contacted Bye about performing live to old silent films. ‚ÄúSilent film music was like a blank spot on the music map, but I recognised the freedom I‚Äôd have as a musician, and the force of the poetry in these forgotten images. To play piano for these films was like a dream. So I started my own ‚Äòuniversity‚Äô in the cinema, improvising directly in front of the film screen, trying new pieces and styles in front of a live audience. The beauty is that you feel the past through these beautiful films,‚Äú he says of the style that gradually developed in this environment, ‚Äúbut through the music you can add a new layer of something contemporary too.‚Äù As his reputation spread, Bye recognised that, thanks to the diversity of his interests, he‚Äôd stumbled on a singularly romantic style. ‚ÄúI started out as a piano improviser,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúand suddenly I realised I was composing, and that I‚Äôm a composer.‚Äù By the late 1990s, Bye had progressed from silent films to composing for new ones, including documentaries. Since then Bye has composed music to over 30 films not to mention a host of music to theatre and dance pieces. In 2014 he received two of the three nominations for Best Original Music Award at Sweden‚Äôs prestigious Guldbaggen ‚Äì his soundtrack for Faro took the honour (as well as a Nordic Film Music Prize) ahead of his work for The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window And Disappeared. He‚Äôs also provided new music for, among others, Victor Sj√∂str√∂m‚Äôs seminal horror The Phantom Carriage (1921) and The Saga of Gosta Berling (1924), a landmark melodrama starring Greta Garbo. He‚Äôs recorded a number of solo works, too, not least 2010‚Äôs Dr√∂mt and 2013‚Äôs Bethanien, the latter inspired by a two-year sojourn in Berlin working in Kreuzbergcultural centre of the same name. In the Fall of 2017 Bye will release a new solo record titled This Forgotten Land as well as a soundtrack to the film Superswede.

Simons is also the co-founder and a director of the Sea Change Foundation, which focuses on climate change and clean energy policy.  Early life  Nat Simons is the son of James Simons, a mathematician and the founder of Renaissance Technologies, and Barbara Simons, a computer scientist and former president of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). Nat had his bar mitzvah in 1979, later attended the University of California, Berkeley, and earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1989, followed by a master's degree in mathematics in 1994. Career Simons began his career at Cylink Corp in 1989. Since 1994, Simons has been a principal at Renaissance Technologies. At Renaissance, Simons worked as a data analyst from 1994 to 1995, then as a futures trader from 1995 to 1997. In 1997, Simons began the Meritage family of funds, which was spun off from Renaissance. Simons served as vice chairman at Renaissance from 2006 to 2020 and is senior managing director and chairman of Meritage Group. In 2009, Simons co-founded Prelude Ventures, a clean tech venture fund.

In 2009, Simons spoke along with Bill Clinton and Al Gore at the National Clean Energy Project roundtable. In discussing philanthropy‚Äôs role in combating climate change, Simons stated, ‚ÄúI think the role of philanthropy is more than anything to just facilitate the process. There are many different stakeholders, and they all have to be brought together. The grid is perhaps the best example we can think of where there are many disparate interests.

JCPP represents 13 professional associations in the field of pharmacy, developing consensus policy directives for the profession. It is well known for the 2014 development of \\"The Pharmacists‚Äô Patient Care Process,\\" which provides broad, consensus guidelines for how clinical pharmacists should practice.  History  JCPP was founded in 1977 with the purpose of bringing American pharmacists from across the field together to discuss the future of the profession and other matters of strategic importance to the profession of pharmacy as a whole.  Meetings  JCPP holds quarterly meetings of its delegates to discuss topics of relevance to the profession of pharmacy as a whole. Prior to holding quarterly meetings, JCPP held conferences for pharmacy stakeholders that lasted a few days long.  Publications  On May 29, 2014, JCPP's member organizations approved the \\"Pharmacists‚Äô Patient Care Process\\" (PCPP) with the goal of providing a unified, professional understanding of pharmacist-lead pharmaceutical care. The PCPP was drafted by representatives from ten JCPP member organizations. The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education, a member of JCPP, requires that pharmacy schools within the United States incorporate the PCPP into their curricula. The effort grew out of prior efforts to standardize \\"pharmacist workup of drug therapy,\\" which the process now provides a guideline for doing. Part of the impetus for the development of the PCPP came from the desire of pharmacists to measure the outcomes of their care. By standardizing pharmaceutical care, outcomes could be attributed to the care itself, rather than any bias introduced by differences in methodology. The PCPP emphasizes the need for pharmacists to work together with other healthcare professionals to improve medication-related outcomes. The PCPP has been covered in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Public Health Grand Rounds, and has been the subject of continuing education programs for a variety of pharmacy groups. In 2011, JCPP wrote a report to the Surgeon General of the United States, Office of the Chief Pharmacist, titled, \\"Improving Patient and Health System Outcomes through Advanced Pharmacy Practice.\\"  Delegation  As of March 2017, JCPP is composed of 13 professional pharmacy associations and their respective representatives: *Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP), represented by Susan Cantrell, CEO of AMCP *American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP), represented by Lucinda Maine, CEO of AACP *American College of Apothecaries (ACA), represented by Donnie Calhoun, Executive Vice President of ACA *American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP), represented by Michael S.

Passaic River Coalition. The coalition is an urban watershed association active since 1969 in protecting water quality and quantity of the entire Passaic River watershed of northern New Jersey and Rockland and Orange Counties, New York.  History  Established in 1969 and incorporated in 1972, the Passaic River Coalition has given valuable assistance and stewardship for the preservation and protection of over 1,000 miles of waterways. The organization has faced the challenges of a watershed beset with every conceivable environmental problem. The coalition has been involved in many topics including:What We Do. Passaic River Coalition. *Flood Management *Enlargement of Recreational and Natural Areas *Enhancement of Water Supply Management *Improvement of Water Quality *Ground Water Management In 1993, a major land trust endowment was made to the PRC to providing funding for land acquisition. With funding from the endowment and matching payments from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, the PRC has now preserved over 1,000 acres of open space. In addition to land preservation, the PRC does riverside conservation, riverfront parks, trail construction, and the creation of urban park recreation.  Flooding: The Reason for the Passaic River Coalition  For many decades, two things have been certain in the Passaic River Basin - floods and flood studies. Actual progress has been less certain. The Passaic River Coalition was formed in 1969 to address this issue and has been a major force ever since, both fending off harmful ideas and promoting effective measures to reduce flood damages without destroying the very resources we are trying to protect. The Passaic River Basin has a long history of floods. The current record flood was in 1903, when much of the basin was undeveloped but also had been subject to massive deforestation. Major floods have occurred in 1902, 1945, 1968, 1977, 1984, 1999, 2000, 2007, 2010, and 2011. Between the State and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), we have over a century of flood control studies. At various times, dry flood-storage reservoirs, dual-purpose reservoirs (for both flood control and water supply), river channelization, levees, dikes and tunnels have been proposed. Eventually, non-structural concepts were introduced, such as land preservation and floodplain development controls, but it took decades for these ideas to get far. In the late 1960s, a Corps plan (called Plan III) included large dams and reservoirs; it was that plan that triggered creation of the PRC. Problems with that plan led to Plan II-B, which led to Congressional requirements in 1976 for new studies. Right after the major flood of 1984, the state endorsed The Pompton/Passaic Dual Inlet Tunnel Diversion Plan. After lengthy debate in which the PRC played a prominent role, in 1996 Governor Whitman removed State support for this project, and the federal Water Resources Development Act of 2000 prohibited design and construction funding for the flood control tunnel. Still, the project remains authorized. Most recently, in 2011 the Corps was asked by New Jersey to reevaluate six mainstem alternatives, in response to the Passaic River Basin Flood Advisory Commission. The Corps found that three may remain economically justified, though all are very expensive and New Jersey would need to pay 35 percent: *Alternative 14A ‚Äì Levees, Floodwalls, and Non-Structural Plan ($3.1 billion) *Non-Structural Plan for areas affected by the ‚Äú10-year floods‚Äù ($1.2 billion) *Diversion Tunnel ($4.7 billion) Late this year, the Corps anticipates submitting a new evaluation to New Jersey for review. The Corps also plans to provide new reports on the lower portion of the tidal Passaic (addressing storm surge issues in Kearny, Harrison and Newark), and in the Lower Saddle River. In other words, Passaic Basin interests will need to engage with three major Corps reports very soon. Meanwhile, some smaller-scale projects have been completed by the Corps, including Molly Ann Brook in Passaic County, the Ramapo River flood control project, and wetlands purchases. The state has also been active, with improved controls over wetlands and flood plain development, and land preservation (with help from many others). The latter includes the acquisition of houses with repetitive flood damages (Blue Acres), where the houses are torn down and the land dedicated to riverside park lands. Morris County has also helped fund such work, notably in Pequannock Township, and the Passaic River Coalition has been active in Little Falls Township. We still face the fact that flooding is a major issue, no major project will be easily accepted, no solution will be cheap, New Jersey will face significant costs, and efforts to build major structures mean that many people will remain at risk in the interim. The PRC will be engaged in helping to untie this Gordian knot.  Properties  Since the Land Trust's creation in 1993, the PRC has acquired 20 properties in 6 counties (Passaic, Morris, Bergen, Essex, Sussex, and Somerset), 20 municipalities, and a total of almost 900 acres.PRC's Land Trust.

The radar became operational soon after its donation, collecting its first data in May 1971. Data was collected on magnetic tapes and processed on a NASA computer post event due to the lack of real-time capability at the time.  History  In the early 1940s, radar operators throughout Europe noticed that, when using radar to track objects otherwise concealed due to distance, haze, or otherwise, precipitation was also visible, causing issues when it came to masking and objects within cores of precipitation. Into the late-1940s, scientists from Europe and the United States began to expand on the idea of radar for meteorological applications. In the mid-1950s, the advent of Doppler radar came into light, and many radars in the United States were soon Doppler.http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/~jdduda/portfolio/HistoryPPT.pdf  Deployment  Initially, the NSSL acquired a 3 cm Doppler research radar, which, for the first time, was able to measure object motion within a thunderstorm. Using the Doppler Effect, the radar would detect a change in frequency that occurred when its signal was reflected from a moving target, such as a cluster of raindrops ‚Äî similar to the shift in frequency experienced with a passing sound. However, it was quickly found that 3 cm Wavelength radars were not sufficient for large-scale detection of severe weather. In 1969, the U.S. Air Force donated a surplus Bendix AN/FPS-18 Radar to the NSSL. This radar, equipped with Doppler capabilities, aided in the discovery of a radar phenomena known as a Tornado Vortex Signature, a small-scale Doppler velocity circulation pattern noted before or during tornadic development. After this was built, a second 10 cm Doppler Radar was built in Cimarron County, Oklahoma, establishing Dual-Doppler capabilities for the first time.

IFCWC sent delegates to represent the state at national conventions and opportunities such as \\"Colored Women's day\\" at the 1939 New York World's Fair. The IFCWC is also known for creating a black women's dormitory for the University of Iowa before the school was fully integrated. The building has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  About  The IFCWC was created in May 1902 and was at first known as the Iowa Association of Colored Women's Clubs. The first convention met in Ottumwa with only a few women and their clubs attending. The first president was Helen Downey. By 1904, there were 300 women attending the annual conference and clubs from all cities large enough to support them sent representatives. By 1914, the IFCWC represented 40 different African-American women's clubs in Iowa. Also in that year, the IFCWC created a committee dedicated to women's suffrage, which was headed by Teresa Adams. =Iowa Federation Home for Colored Girls= In 1912, it was proposed by the president of IFCWC, Mrs. J.B. Rush, that a home for black working women be established. In 1919, the IFCWC purchased a home, known later as the \\"Federation Home,\\" at 942 Iowa Avenue in Iowa City. White neighbors protested the sale of a house to African Americans, successfully demanding that the lot's price be reassessed, causing IFCWC to pay more money for their purchase. In 1934, the home was renamed \\"Sue Brown Hall\\" after a prominent member of the IFCWC. The home allowed black women who wanted to attend the University of Iowa to have a place to stay, since they were not allowed in the dorms until 1947. The home closed in 1950.

This occurred the day after Sauvage's son committed suicide. Sauvage stated that Mr Marot had physically and sexually abused his wife, daughters and possibly his son. A criminal case was then filed against Mrs. Sauvage, that resulted in her being condemned to ten years in jail by a cour d'assises. She then filed an appeal motion, but the verdict remained unchanged, pronounced on 3 December 2015. On 31 January 2016, the French president Fran√ßois Hollande announced his giving a partial presidential pardon to Mrs Sauvage. This resulted in a reduction of her jail time of two years and nine months. On 28 December 2016, M. Hollande pronounced a full pardon, announced both on his personal Twitter account and by a release made by the Elys√©e. This decision led to Mrs Sauvage‚Äôs immediate release from the detention centre of R√©au.  Specifics of the case  Jacqueline Sauvage was convicted by two different Cours d'assises, in accordance with the French judicial system. Because of this, only a motion presented to the Court of Cassation was possible. However, this court does not re-examine the facts of the case, it merely examines the application of the law within the context of the case. Therefore the verdict itself could not be questioned, but the sentence could be altered, with a presidential pardon being the only avenue to a full verdict nullification. A demand for a presidential pardon was then filed by the daughters of Mrs. Sauvage, who publicly expressed their relief at their father's death. President Hollande was known to be reluctant to use the presidential pardon, and had granted a pardon only once since his election in 2012. Nevertheless, he agreed to a meeting with Mrs Sauvage‚Äôs daughters and lawyers at the √âlys√©e Palace in January 2016.  Media coverage, who and when This case was the main topic covered by the French media, essentially after the Sauvage sisters' demand was presented to M. Hollande. The media coverage was as diverse as it was intense. Since the end of 2015, feminist associations‚Äô websites, traditional media and public channels, and French social media coverage was entirely focused on the case. A petition launched on the website Change.org to ask the French president to grant a pardon to Mrs. Sauvage garnered 435,971 signatures. On 26 February 2017, a French TV show named \\"Sept √† Huit\\" received extremely high ratings with five million viewers, due to a segment profiling Jacqueline Sauvage. In addition, the political establishment took a stand for Mrs. Sauvage to create a support committee, including Anne Hidalgo and Jean-Luc M√©lenchon. After the presidential pardon was pronounced, a major debate was launched by lawyers and specialists of criminal law on whether the State of law had been respected. Their stance was that the media had overruled two successive court decisions by influencing the public, who then pushed for the presidential pardon.  Controversies  = From the woman, guilty of murder to the wife, victim of abuses = After the Cour d'assises of first instance found Jacqueline Sauvage guilty of murder, French feminist associations such as Osez le F√©minisme released information on Mrs Sauvage‚Äôs past. These articles depicted a woman, trapped in an abusive relationship for 47 years, beaten, raped and whose three daughters were also raped. This information was meant to defend the thesis of Mrs Sauvage being a victim of domestic and sexual abuse, who acted to defend herself, instead of a cold-hearted murderer. This group also called for the definition of self- defence to be modified, as to include \\"female victims of violence\\". In addition, other outlets reported failure by authorities to help the Sauvage family. When Jacqueline Sauvage tried to kill herself, the doctor did not ask why. When one of her daughters reported being raped by her father to police, the officer called the alleged perpetrator. It was also noted that an average of 223,000 women a year in France are abused by their husbands, and that 134 (on average) are killed by them. = Controversy on the royal power of the pardon = R√©gis de Castelnau, lawyer and author of the blog Vu du Droit (In Terms of Law) mentioned a \\"cult of the innocent guilty\\" created by the public opinion through the media, with only partial information given about the case. For him, public opinion was mobilised based on a story radically different from the one constituted by a regular and contradictory procedure. He considered the presidential pardon granted to Mrs Sauvage as an insult made to the independence of the judiciary, to the legal profession and to the Republic. This was backed-up by the lawyer Florence Rault, who denounced the media treatment on this case, first on her blog and later published by the Figarovox, saying there was a will to \\"promote a victimizing feminism and to affirm the impossibility of the existence of female violence\\". These opinions were a minority voice and do not incorporate the complexity of the case, as established by the judicial system itself. In an article published by Le Figaro, the philosopher Robert Redeker also contested the pardon, which he considered to be \\"an insult to democracy motivated by a victimizing ideology\\". Another philosopher, Michel Onfray, questioned the relevance of the pardon, undermining multiple court decisions and potentially opening the way to self- defence and personal vendettas. For Marie-Jane Ody, Secretary General of the Union Syndicale of Magistrates, the whole work done during the trial is being denied by the executive power which rules only according to a support committee. She asked for the removal of the presidential pardon, \\"survival of the royal power\\", considered incompatible with democracy and the idea of a fair and independent justice.

The Chinese-Hong Kong co-production is an adaptation of the Japanese novel Kimi yo Funnu no Kawa o Watare by Juko Nishimura, which was previously adapted in a 1976 film of the same name. Woo decided to develop an adaptation to commemorate the film's star Ken Takakura, who had become a cultural icon in China after the film was the first to be released in China following the Cultural Revolution. The film was shot on-location in Osaka and Kansai, Japan, and features a mixed Chinese, Japanese, and Korean cast, with dialogue in Mandarin, Japanese, and English. It has been described by Woo as a return to his older style of films, specifically mentioning The Killer. The film premiered at the 74th Venice International Film Festival and released in China on 24 November 2017. It was released worldwide on Netflix on 4 May 2018. Plot Du Qiu is a Chinese attorney employed by Osaka-based Tenjin Pharmaceuticals, having successfully defended the company against numerous high-profile lawsuits. About to be relocated to the United States by his management, Qiu attends a party where Tenjin President Yoshihiro Sakai appoints his son, Hiroshi, as the new head of research-and-development. Qiu briefly meets a half-Chinese woman, Mayumi, but loses track of her. Sakai tells a mysterious woman to seduce Qiu into remaining in Japan. She dances with him at the party then sneaks to his house before he arrives later. Qiu awakens to find the woman dead in his bed. He calls the police and pleads his innocence, but is nonetheless taken into custody. The arresting officer, Detective Yuji Asano, suddenly knocks out another officer and tells Qiu to run. Qiu loses pursuing police by fleeing to a subway station under- construction. Veteran detective Satoshi Yamura is called in with his rookie partner Rika to track down Qiu, much to Asano's chagrin. Following his intuition, Yamura and Rika travel to the construction site. Where they find Qiu disguised as an employee. Qiu holds Rika hostage with a nail gun, but Yamura surrenders himself and his gun to save Rika. Qiu takes Yamura hostage and claims he is innocent but the two end up in a fistfight, Yamura eventually gets the upper hand but Qiu overpowers Yamura after he is distracted by white pigeons. Qiu manages to escape apprehension and seeks shelter in a nearby shanty town, where he's befriended by the Mandarin-literate local Sakaguchi. Seeking answers, Qiu contacts Sakai and demands a face-to-face meeting, suspecting that his former employers have set him up. Sakai secretly hires a pair of assassins, Rain and Dawn, to kill Qiu, and sends one of his lowers to the arranged meeting spot. He explains to Qiu that Sakai and Hiroshi have been secretly developing projects for military contractors. Aiming at Qiu with a sniper rifle, Rain is unable to carry through with the hit because Qiu had earlier shown her kindness, shooting and killing the lawyer instead. Yamura pursues Qiu in a high-speed jet ski chase and nearly catches him, but Qiu is suddenly intercepted by Mayumi, who helps him escape on a Shinkansen. Fleeing to her remote farmhouse, Mayumi explains that her fianc√© was a scientist employed by Tenjin was falsely accused by the company for stealing their classified formula, and subsequently committed suicide on their wedding day after losing the lawsuit lead by Qiu. Qiu apologizes, insisting that the information he was given in regards to the case came directly from the authorities. The two are suddenly ambushed by Rain and Dawn on motorcycles, by Yamura arrives and fends them off while they flee. Yamura pursues Qiu and saves him and Mayumi after their car wrecks before handcuffing himself to Qiu, insisting on taking him in. Mayumi tells Yamura that she was with Qiu at the time of the murder, proving his innocence. The trio hold up at the farmhouse, where they manage to fend off an assault by an army of hitmen, but not before Yamura is shot. Dawn is severely injured and injects herself with a stimulant to recover, but overdoses and dies in Rain's arms. Rika subsequently drives Yamura and Qiu to a hospital, and they let Qiu go. Blackmailed over his drug addiction, Detective Asano reveals himself to be working for Sakai and demands he be compensated for his part in framing Qiu to divert attention from the real murderer, Hiroshi. Sakai swiftly has Asano killed by Rain. Meanwhile, Rika runs an analysis on Asano's drugs, and finds they match the formula Mayumi's fianc√© had been working on. Mayumi gives Rika a secret equation necessary for decoding the formula to properly reproduce the drug, a powerful stimulant, before she is captured by Rain. Sakaguchi helps Qiu sneak onto a truck carrying Tenjin test subjects, but once at the laboratory he is separated from the others and subjected to an excruciating treatment that causes him to become an involuntarily violent, nigh-invulnerable killer. Sakaguchi tries to kill the other prisoners, but has a moment of clarity and commits suicide. Sakai recognizes Qiu among the subjects and order he be subjected to the treatment, designed to turn a person into a near-superhuman, brainwashed soldier. Yamura arrives and offers Sakai the decoding equation in exchange for Qiu. Rain, realizing that Sakai is ultimately responsible for Dawn's death, releases Mayumi and gives her a gun. Qiu is injected and forced to fight Yamura, but he manages to break his conditioning and the two turn on the guards with the help of Rain. Qiu, Yamura, Mayumi and Rain end up fighting through hordes of guards through intense firefights. Hiroshi injects himself with the updated formula, surviving several gunshot wounds before finally succumbing and dying, confessing to the murder Qiu was accused of. Sakai shoots Rain, and wounds Qiu but is cornered by Qiu and Yamura, begrieved by his son's death, Sakai commits suicide. Rain dies in Qiu's arms, and Rika arrives with police backup. Weeks later, Qiu meets Yamura at a train station, where they shake hands and exchange names in Japanese and Mandarin, respectively. Yamura bids Qin farewell as he boards the train with Mayumi, before walking off with Rika. Cast Production =Development= After the death of Japanese actor Ken Takakura, Woo searched for material to commemorate him. During this search, he was contacted by Peter Lam, the head of Media Asia, who asked if he would like to do remake of the Japanese film Manhunt. Woo's Manhunt is an adaptation of the Japanese novel Kimi yo Fundo no Kawa o Watare by Juko Nishimura which had previously been adapted into a Japanese film starring Takakura. Woo decided to make a new adaptation of the film, stating that \\"Ken Takakura is one of my favorite actors in the world. He was my idol, and he has influenced a lot of my films. [Hong Kong actor] Chow Yun-Fat's image in A Better Tomorrow was inspired by Takakura's image and style. I wanted to make a movie dedicated to Ken Takakura.\\" The original film was described by Variety as a \\"massive hit\\" when it was released in China in 1978, where it was the first foreign film to be shown in post-Cultural Revolution China. =Pre-production= Manhunt's producers include Gordon Chan and Chan Hing-kai while the film is being backed by the Hong Kong production company Media Asia on a budget ranging between 30 and 40 million. Manhunt marked the end of Woo's previous production company Lion Rock Films following the box-office disappointment of The Crossing which led to Woo and Terence Chang disbanding Lion Rock Productions. Woo stated that he had \\"got tired of making big-budget movies. I think about going back to the old times, when it wasn't so much about money but about working with a wonderful, smaller crew to make a real movie.\\" Woo expanded on this later stating that there was great pressure in enjoying the creative process when \\"being controlled by the numbers during the entire process\\" or deciding \\"decide how to shoot a scene because of the budget, not inspiration.\\" The production team includes Japanese art director Yohei Taneda and cinematographer Takuro Ishizaka. The film features a large Japanese cast including Yasuaki Kurata, Jun Kunimura, Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, Nanami Sakuraba, Naoto Takenaka and Tao Okamoto. In addition, Chinese actress Qi Wei and Korean actress Ha Ji-won were cast in key roles in the film. =Filming= Production started on Manhunt in June 2016 in Osaka. At the beginning of the production, the cast and crew and local government officials held a traditional Japanese kagami biraki ceremony. Woo stated that Manhunt would go back to his older style of filmmaking, referring to his film The Killer specifically. Manhunt was projected to finished filming in October 2016 and then later reported to be finished filming by the end of November. The China Internet Information Center stated that the film had begun post-production in January 2017. Release Manhunt was scheduled to have its world premiere at the 74th Venice International Film Festival. The film was shown out of competition. It had press and industry screenings 6 September 2017 and a public screening on 8 September 2017. Both Woo and actress Ha Ji- won were scheduled to attended the festival in Venice. The film received its North American premiere at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival as part of their special presentation program. Manhunt had its first press screening in Toronto on 7 September 2017 and was scheduled for a public screening 14 September 2017. The film was initially set for release in China on 16 February 2018. The China Internet Information Center described that waiting this long for a release is \\"unusual for a Chinese film\\". The film was released in China on 24 November 2017. Reception =Box office= Manhunt has grossed a worldwide total of $18.3 million, against a production budget of $50 million. =Critical response= On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 67% based on 27 reviews, and an average rating of 6.2/10. On Metacritic, the film was given an average score of 68 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Screen Daily declared the film \\"a breezy, handsomely mounted fun that shows that Woo has lost neither his mojo nor his sense of poetry.\\" and \\"Manhunt is a John Woo movie like he used to make ‚Äòem, before his US period including Face/Off and Mission Impossible 2, and recent Asian historical diptychs Red Cliff and The Crossing.\\" Variety described Manhunt as \\"underwhelming and undercooked\\" and that the audience who come to Woo for the action scenes would be satisfied while \\"those of us for whom the director's best work, like the brilliant Hard Boiled or the transcendently ludicrous Face/Off, is marked out not just by superior gun-fu but by the disarming sincerity with which he always sold the silliness, Manhunt is a disappointment.\\" The Hollywood Reporter referred to the film as a \\"string of sophisticated and thrilling set pieces.\\" and that \\"Production values are lavish and some of the metallic sets designed by Yohei Taneda have the complexity of an Escher puzzle. Takuro Ishizaka‚Äôs lighting gives even the silly final scenes a visually exciting veneer.\\" The review also commented on the story referring to it as \\"logic-free\\" and concluded that the film \\"isn‚Äôt going to go down in history as [Woo's] best film\\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film four stars out of five, stating that praised the films action sequences as a highlight while stating that the story is a \\"little absurd\\" but that the film \\"offers something that is never in sufficiently plentiful supply: fun.\\" References External links  Manhunt at Box Office Mojo Category:2017 films Category:Films shot in Osaka Category:Films based on Japanese novels Category:Films directed by John Woo Category:Chinese films Category:Hong Kong films Category:Films set in Japan Category:Films set in Osaka Category:English-language films Category:Japanese-language films Category:Mandarin-language films Category:2017 action thriller films Category:Chinese action thriller films Category:Hong Kong action thriller films Category:Media Asia films Category:Films about lawyers Category:Films scored by Taro Iwashiro Category:Chinese remakes of foreign films Category:Hong Kong film remakes Category:Mandarin-language Netflix original films Category:Heroic bloodshed films ","title":"Manhunt (2017 film)"},{"id":"54052485","text":"The Populars and Mayors () was an alliance of Czech political parties, consisting of the Christian and Democratic Union ‚Äì Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-ƒåSL) and Mayors and Independents.

The alliance was dissolved in July 2017, before the election took place. History The alliance was formed on 18 March 2017, with some leading members suggesting that they could win over 15% of votes.

Bƒõlobr√°dek refused to comment these reports, while Gazd√≠k denied that the parties would end the alliance, stating that if KDU-ƒåSL disbands the alliance, STAN will participate in the election independently.

G√≥ra Zyndrama) is an archaeological site located in southern Poland, in Maszkowice village, ≈ÅƒÖcko commune. It was a prehistoric defensive settlement occupied in the Early Bronze Age (1750-1550 BC), in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age (950-400 BC) and in the La T√®ne Period (200-50 BC). The hill itself is a part of the Beskid Wyspowy range, which belongs to the Northern Carpathians area. The site is located 410 meters above the sea level and its plateau is rising significantly (several dozen meters) above the ≈ÅƒÖcko Basin and the Dunajec river valley. In the 60's and 70's it was excavated by Maria Cabalska from the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w. Marcin S. Przyby≈Ça (also from JU in Krak√≥w) has undertaken new research project since 2010. The new excavations and studies brought a spectacular bunch of informations. Analysis of the artifacts proves that at first (1750-1550 BC) the settlement was inhabited most probably by a population of the Ottom√°ny culture. In this period (ca. 1750 BC) a monumental stone wall construction was built around the hillfort's plateau (the local sources of sandstone was used). This example of stone architecture is one of the oldest in Europe (excluding the Mediterranean Area) and it is the oldest in Poland. The stone wall of the Zyndram's Hill in terms of technical solutions has connections with Alpine and Mediterranean constructions. That suggests that some of the founders of the settlement were from the southern parts of Europe. Archaeologists discovered also the remains of dwellings from this period. The plateau was inhabited afresh in the Late Bronze Age after a 500-year-long hiatus. The settlement of the second phase (950-400 BC) was most probably much bigger. According to the stratigraphic observations the remains of the earliest stone construction was reused. The wooden and earthen fortifications were also built. The population of this phase was most probably related to more local societies of the Carpathian area (i.e. the Gava culture) and the tradition of the so-called Urnfield culture. The last settlement episode may be connected with the La T√®ne Period (200-50 BC). Zyndram's Hill was inhabited by the population of the Puchov culture. It is assumed that the occupied area shrunk significantly in this period. Local tradition and legends wanted to relate Zyndram's Hill with the castle of Zyndram of Maszkowice (a Polish medieval knight and royal official). This assumption was denied by the archaeologists who proved the prehistorical origin of the hillfort and its fortifications.

Plot Late one night in 1814, a young Mohawk woman named Okwaho or \\"Oak\\" (Kaniehtiio Horn) gets into an argument with her mother Wentahawi (Sheri Foster) over whether her neutral tribe, who are being violently slaughtered by new Americans, should get involved in the War of 1812. Her two lovers ‚Äî a Mohawk warrior named Calvin (Justin Rain) and a British soldier named Joshua (Eamon Farren), one of whom is the father of her unborn child ‚Äî push for retaliation, which ultimately leads to Calvin sneaking off later that same night to light a nearby American encampment on fire, killing 22 sleeping American soldiers. Six soldiers and their civilian translator Yancy (Noah Segan) escape from the fire and, seeking their own revenge, track down the trio the next morning. A skirmish occurs, which results in the death of Wentahawi and the American Commander, Colonel Charles Hawkes (Jack Gwaltney). A power-hungry and brutal subordinate, Captain Hezekiah Holt (Ezra Buzzington), takes control of the Americans and demands violent retribution. Chasing Oak and the two men, the Americans capture, torture, and kill Calvin at the cost of more Americans being killed, including Holt's son Myles (Ian Colletti). When Oak and Joshua are finally captured at a desolate French-Canadian mission (where Holt and his men have already murdered Oak's uncle and cousins), Holt kills Joshua with his sabre and shoots Oak in the chest, seemingly killing her. The remaining Americans then leave to return to their base at Fort George. Oak survives the injury, shaves her head into a bloody Mohawk, and constructs a makeshift suit of armor out of remains of a pregnant deer and its unborn fawn. She stalks the last three Americans (Holt, Yancy, and Private Lachlan Allsopp (Jonathan Huber) through the darkening forest, killing Yancy and Allsopp before revealing herself to Holt. He becomes disoriented and, through dream-like supernatural means, ends up back at his burnt-out camp. Having abandoned his pistol and sword in the forest, he and Oak fight hand to hand. She finally kills Holt by throwing him onto the burnt remains of a tree, impaling him through the heart. Oak, severely injured, walks away from his corpse and, as she leaves, is witnessed by a Mohawk family, who look upon her like a deity.

Chemically, it is a salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid.  Mechanism of action and environmental impacts  Cornu aspersum in warm regions commonly emerges in moist weather in winter. Ferric sodium EDTA works by interacting with and destroying hemocyanin, a copper based compound found in the blood of molluscs and arthropods which is used to carry oxygen, similar to hemoglobin found in vertebrates, and typically kills snails and slugs in a matter of days following exposure. The compound is much safer than Metaldehyde and does not pose a significant risk to birds, pets, or humans so long as the bait is not consumed. Snails and slugs which feed on or ingest ferric sodium EDTA stop feeding almost immediately after exposure, and die within two to three days. Ferric sodium EDTA is highly toxic to aquatic arthropods and care should be taken in applying it.  Toxicity to dogs  Reports of dogs eating large amounts of ferric sodium EDTA have resulted in abdominal pain and haemorrhagic gastroenteritis, however, in all reported cases the dogs recovered after being treated.

E. G. Arey; April 14, 1819 ‚Äì April 26, 1901) was a 19th-century American educator, author, editor, and publisher. Hailing from Vermont, she was one of the earliest young women who studied in a co-educational environment. In Cleveland, Ohio, she became a contributor to the Daily Herald and taught at a girls' school. After marriage, she moved to Wisconsin, and served as \\"Preceptress and Teacher of English Literature, French, and Drawing\\" at State Normal School in Whitewater, Wisconsin. After returning to Cleveland, she edited a monthly publication devoted to charitable work, and served on the board of the Woman's Christian Association. Arey was a cofounder and first president of the Ohio Woman's State Press Association. Her principal writings were Household Songs and Other Poems and Home and School Training. Arey died in 1901. Early years and education Harriett Ellen Grannis was born in Cavendish, Vermont, April 14, 1819. Her parents were John Grannis and Roxana Chandler Grannis. Her father was at that time a merchant and the Grannis family home was across the river in Claremont, New Hampshire. To this place, her grandfather, Timothy Grannis, had moved from New Haven, Conn., the original home of the family in America, had purchased an estate along the bank of the Connecticut and Sugar Rivers, and had married Sarah, daughter of Dr. William Sumner of Boston, Massachusetts. Her mother, Roxana Chandler, was daughter of David Chandler and Hannah Peabody, his wife. These families had settled in the earliest colonial times in Duxbury, Salem, and Boston, a branch of each being found very early in Andover, Massachusetts, from where another branch went, in the middle of the 18th century, to Amherst, New Hampshire. These ancestors were of old colonial and mainly of Puritan background‚Äîone of the early comers having married a daughter of Miles Standish,‚Äî-and another belonging to a family, one of whose members, while a student at Oxford University, was hunted down for reading Tyndale Bible and other so-called heretical works, at a time when the only purification for such heresies was by burning at the stake. Her father's family had settled in New Haven, Connecticut, previous to 1655, among the earlier immigrants to New England. A hundred years later, her grandfather moved from New Haven to Claremont, New Hampshire, taking up a section of land included between the Connecticut River and Sugar River and the township boundary on the north. Her father was the seventh child of this family. While he was studying for the ministry, the older brothers engaged in extensive business enterprises. The War of 1812 came with its ruinous effects upon the country, followed from 1815 by two or three cold seasons in New England, in which crops were cut off. The business of the country had been unsettled since the first demonstrations of war, and her father was called from his studies to assist in saving the crippled business in which his brothers were engaged. The last blow of ruined crops brought about a disastrous failure, so that Harriett was born in the midst of a depression. When she was three years of age, her father moved to Woodstock, Vermont. When she was five years of age, the family moved to Stanstead, Lower Canada, and located at Hatley, a small town on Lake Magog. The schools were unusually good, and she received some of her education here. Her father, as well as his elder brother Timothy, and, still more, a son of the latter, had been accustomed to write in measured rhyme, their poems sometimes appearing in the local papers; and perhaps it was not strange that Harriett should, as soon as she could hold a pen, make crude attempts in the same direction. She was furnished with a copy book in which she wrote slowly and laboriously; and she soon turned surreptitiously to the back of the book and werote loose rhymes that were jingling in her brain. On one occasion, the teacher passed by her desk when she was just finishing a rhymed account of some event which had occurred in the school room. Something must have attracted the teacher's attention; for he noticed her book, grabbed it, and, after running it through by himself, with a laugh, he proceeded to read it aloud to the school. When class was over, she scurried home. Thought her father soothed her ruffled mood, her copy-book confidences were discontinued. At the age of fourteen, her mother died and, as her father had in the same year been elected member of the Provincial Parliament, necessitating his presence in Quebec for a considerable portion of the year, the family was broken up. Her uncle, Timothy sent his son through Vermont and Canada to bring this niece to his home. Here and in the house of another uncle, Thomas Woolson, she spent the next four years, at Claremont, New Hampshire. At the close of this time, her father gathered his family together at a home in Oberlin, Ohio, where he afterwards held offices of trust under the United States Government. Arey joined him at that town, and entered Oberlin College, class of 1837, becoming one of the earliest young women who pursued a liberal course of education in a co-educational environment. She was then at the head of her father's family and found it necessary to do much of her studying at night. When she neared the close of her junior year, her eyesight failed, and it was many years before she regained substantial use of her eyes. In 1845, she received the degree of AB. Career After a period of rest, she became a teacher in Cleveland, at first in the public schools, and afterwards in a ladies' school. She remained there until 1848 when she married Oliver Arey. She began her literary career in Cleveland as a contributor to the Daily Herald of that city. After marriage, the couple moved to Buffalo, New York. She had been, while a student, a writer for such literary papers as then flourished in Ohio and western New York, as well as for the New York Tribune, Willis & Morris's Home Journal, and the Philadelphia magazines, and this work was continued after her removal to Buffalo. In 1856, a volume of her poems was published by James Cephas Derby, New York. She was already engaged in editing a child's magazine, The Youth's Casket, and being subsequently invited to undertake another child's magazine of higher order, she declined, thinking that the demand for such publications was already supplied, But she suggested the starting of a magazine devoted to the interests of the household, in distinction from the fashion magazines then so popular. This was accordingly undertaken, the Home Monthly with Abby Buchanan Longstreet (Mrs. C. H. Gildersleeve), and was very cordially received. As far as known, this was the first publication in the country devoted to the interests of the home. After four or five years of this work, she was obliged, from failing health, to abandon it. It was sold to a firm in Boston, coming under the editorship of the Rev, William Makepeace Thayer, with her name for two or three years more as associate editor. Not long after, her husband was called to the principalship of the State Normal School (now University at Albany, SUNY) in Albany, New York, which he held for two or three years. But, his health having been damaged by a protracted illness, he was obliged to give up for a time the duties of his position; and, through the year 1867, he took charge of the department of Natural Science in the Normal Cchool at Brockport, New York, while his wife held, at the same time, the position of lady-principal of the school. Her youngest child being then old enough to go with her into the school room, she had decided that in her husband's uncertain state of health her place was at his side. When, at the close of this year, he accepted the principalship of the second normal school of Wisconsin, (now University of Wisconsin‚ÄìWhitewater), then about to be opened at Whitewater, she took charge of the ladies' department in this school as \\"Preceptress and Teacher of English Literature, French, and Drawing\\". The dedication of the new building at Whitewater had hardly taken place, when the sudden death of their only daughter gave the family a shock. The responsibilities of a large and constantly growing school left no time for literary effort, but as the preceptress occupation suited her, for nine or ten years, she continued in the work. After nearly a decade in this field, she returned East, and, through the winter of 1876‚Äì7, was, with her husband, in charge of a ladies' school in Yonkers, New York, but in the following autumn, moved with her husband to Buffalo. A few years later, she found herself back in Cleveland, her husband having received a call to the charge of the normal school in that city. In 1884, Arey published a small volume entitled: \\"Home and School Training,\\" (Lippincott & Co., Philadelphia), and soon after, undertook the editing of The Earnest Worker, the organ of the Women's Charitable Association of Cleveland. Her principal writings were Household Songs and Other Poems (New York, 1854); and Home and School Training. Arey was one of the founders and first president of the Ohio Woman's State Press Association. For many years, she served as president of an active literary and social club. She died April 26, 1901, and was buried in Cleveland.

Career  Mewburn was a Research Fellow at RMIT University from 2006‚Äì2012, and worked with research higher degree students and their supervisors as a research education and development scholar. Since 2013, Mewburn has been Director of Research Training at the Australian National University. She undertakes research on post-graduate research within higher education, and is an influential voice on social media on this topic. In 2010, Mewburn started The Thesis Whisperer blog. Her work on this blog, grounded in her academic research, has earned her global recognition as an expert on topics in doctoral education and academic cultures. She is frequently invited to work with cohorts of research students around the world. Mewburn is committed to sharing her knowledge to help others during their thesis process. Mewburn regularly writes for and provides expert opinion on doctoral issues to peak publications and higher education forums such as Nature, The Conversation, The Guardian, Times Higher Education, Campus Review, and the London School of Economics Impact Blog. She has mentored and supported the establishment of other scholarly development blogs, which are influenced by her successful model; these include the DoctoralWritingSIG blog, Mademoiselle Scientist and The Research Whisperer. In 2015, Mewburn ran a massive open online course, How to Survive Your PhD. The bulk of the content was organised around the emotions experienced by most PhD students: Confidence; Frustration; Loneliness; Fear; Curiosity; Confusion; Boredom and Love. The course was designed to cater for students' families and supervisors, as well as the students themselves. Mewburn said that it was \\"... really heartening to see mums, dads, partners and even children of Ph.D. students are so interested in learning about the emotional parts of the journey.\\"  Research  = Academic identity and workload = Mewburn's research has focused on the process of becoming an academic. In 2010, Robyn Barnacle and Mewburn published an influential paper showing that scholarly identity is distributed and is performed through both traditional and non‚Äêtraditional sites of learning. In 2011, she built on this work, and on material published on her Thesis Whisperer blog, to argue that PhD student ‚Äòtroubles talk‚Äô in everyday interactions form an important aspect of identity formation. In 2013, Mewburn and Pat Thomson published an influential paper on why academics blog. They positioned this activity as a community of practice primarily written for other academics. In 2017, Deborah Lupton, Mewburn and Pat Thomson edited a book on the digital academic, which bought together accounts of using digital media and technologies as part of academic practice across teaching, research administration and scholarship. In 2019, Adrian Barnett, Mewburn and Sven Schroter published a paper analyzing the submission of manuscripts and peer reviews, to understand the amount of work undertaken outside of standard working hours. = Academic employment = Over time, Mewburn's research has come to focus on the challenge of employability of PhD students in Australia. In 2016, Rachael E Pitt and Mewburn published an analysis of advertisements for academic positions that sought to understand what graduate attributes universities were seeking from PhD candidates. In 2019, Mewburn published Becoming an academic:How to get through grad school and beyond. One reviewer commented that Mewburn's approach allowed her to engage with \\"...topics that are only discussed in conversations hidden in the office kitchenette.\\" In 2018, Mewburn, Will J. Grant, Hanna Suominen and Stephanie Kizimchuk used machine learning and natural language processing to analyse the content of non-academic Australian job advertisements to understand what proportion of positions would be suitable for PhD graduates. In 2020, Mewburn, Chenchen Xu, Hanna Suominen and Will J. Grant launched the PostAc tool, a real-world instantiation of her research that aims to help research degree graduates find employment. It aims to make the market for advanced research skills more visible to job seekers. = Selected publications = * Mewburn, Inger. Becoming an Academic: How to Get through Grad School and Beyond.

Though the sole prototype was fitted with two defensive machine gun posts. the H.38 was described at the time as a utility aircraft.. Design and development The upper wing of the H.38 was mounted high above the water, with the smaller lower wing attached to the upper hull. Both wings had low aspect ratio and were essentially rectangular in plan, with constant thickness. Each was built around two steel spars and they were braced together with pairs of parallel steel interplane struts. There were three sets of these on each side, one pair outwards from the lower wing, another from the same points inwards to the engine mountings on the upper wing and another between the engines and the lower wing root. The H.38 was powered by two Hispano-Suiza 8Ab water-cooled V8 engines with front-mounted radiators, placed as close together as their propellers diameters allowed in order to minimise asymmetric thrust in the event of an engine failure. Its hull was wooden, with a concave section, single step bottom, gently curved sides and a flat top. The underside was triple surfaced and the sides double. Stability on the water was provided by a pair of floats under the lower wings beneath the interplane strut mountings, separated by about . The hull contained three open crew positions. Two of them, one in the extreme nose and the other midway between the trailing edge and the tail, housed machine gunners. The cockpit, which was under the leading edge of the upper wing, had two side-by-side seats, equipped with dual controls. The hull underside sloped upward aft to the tail, where a low fin served also as a step on which to mount a rectangular tailplane braced on each side with struts to the lower side of the hull. It carried angle-tipped, balanced elevators. The roughly rhomboidal, generous rudder was also balanced. The exact date of the first flight of the Hanriot H.38 is not known but it had flown many times before mid-March 1926. It continued to fly for another ten months until, after alighting on the Marne at Bezons, it was caught by the current, capsized and lost after hitting the pier of a bridge. Neither Marcel Haegelen, Hanriot's chief test pilot, nor the flight engineer Qu√©ro were seriously injured.

The album was released following their 2009 album Ever the Silver Cord Be Loosed. Recording The initial recording of the album was completed at Verdant Studio in Vermont with Justin Pizzoferrato, followed by further recording and mixing at the Drawing Room in Kingston, New York with Justin Rice. Trevor Tyrrell, guitarist and lead vocalist for Weird Owl, when asked about lyrical inspirations for the album, stated that \\"While the lyrics do bear some allusion to certain occult practices, I also feel a kinship on a visceral and primordial level: the act of watching fire and rejoicing in both its creative and destructive power. The manner of singing resembles a chant that might be heard at some sort of shamanistic rite held on the moon long ago.\\" Tyrrell said this of the album overall: > The album is part magical, part scientific; part futuristic, part ancient; > part muscular, part psychological; part heavenly and part terrestrial. It > dwells perfectly in a universe of its own creation. Critical reception Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club gave the album a positive review, writing that the album's songs were \\"tighter and more melodic\\" than those of Weird Owl's previous endeavors, noting that Build Your Beast a Fire \\"[takes] cues from Hawkwind, early Pink Floyd, and Deep Purple's 'Space Truckin\\", and stating that it gives Weird Owl's \\"psychedelic explorations a newfound sense of purpose\\".

Sivaraman (died 2007) was an Indian politician and a Member of the Legislative Assembly. He was elected to the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly as a Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) candidate from Tiruppattur (194) constituency in the 1996 election. Sivaraman contested the Tiruppattur constituency again in 2001, when he was runner-up to K. K. Umadhevan of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. In May 2003, Sivaraman, who was a close friend of M. K. Azhagiri, the son of DMK party leader Karunanidhi, came under suspicion when Azhagiri was charged with conspiracy in the murder of Tha. Kiruttinan, a former minister and senior figure in the party. He was taken into protective custody for a while because police were concerned about possible violence following their arrest of Azhagiri. Subsequently, he was conditionally bailed. Supporters of Sivaraman were initially unhappy when the DMK decided not to let him run for the Tiruppattur seat in 2006. They were placated when he was given the opportunity to stand instead for the Sivaganga constituency. More violent incidents with which Sivaraman, who owned a stone quarry, became associated occurred in 2007. In February, he was arrested on an allegation of hiring a group of henchmen to damage the offices of a business rival and attack staff there. Then, in June, an explosion that resulted in many injuries and two deaths, including that of P.

Publication The story was first published in Novoye Vremyas No. 4248, 25 December (old style) 1887 issue, originally under the title \\"In Learned Society\\" (–í —É—á—ë–Ω–æ–º –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ; V uchyonom obschestve).Sakharova, E.M.

Vol. 5, pp. 520-521 Revised by the author, divided into seven chapters and under the new title it came out as a separate edition in Saint Petersburg in 1892 and enjoyed six re-issues in 1893‚Äì1899. Chekhov included it into Volume 4 of his Collected Works published by Adolf Marks in 1899‚Äì1901. In 1903 the story came out illustrated by Dmitry Kardovsky and in such form continued to be re- issued well into the end of the 20th century. Background There were at least two persons who claimed to have prompted Chekhov the original idea. One of them was Nikolai Leykin: of that Viktor Bilibin informed the author in a 7 December 1887 letter (Chekhov apparently left the claim uncommented). Another, the circus performer and animal trainer Vladimir L. Durov (1863‚Äì1934) in his 1927 book \\"My Animals\\" maintained that it was him who once told Chekhov the real life story about a dog named Kashtanka who'd performed with his troupe.–í.–õ. –î—É—Ä–æ–≤. –ú–æ–∏ –∑–≤–µ—Ä–∏. –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞. 1927. –°—Ç—Ä. 59 Plot The Egyptian Pyramid by the Rostov-on-Don artist Dmitry Lyndin, in front of the main entrance to Gorky Park in Taganrog, Anton Chekhov's native city Chapter 1. Misbehaviour. Kashtanka, a young foxey-looking mongrel, belonging to a carpenter drunkard named Luka Alexandrovich gets lost through her own 'improper behaviour', frightened by a military band on the street. Hungry and desperate (\\"If she had been a human being she would have certainly thought: 'No, it is impossible to live like this! I must shoot myself!'\\"), she huddles up by the entrance to some unfamiliar house. Chapter 2. A Mysterious Stranger. A stranger comes out, feels sorry for the lost dog and, delighted with her funny looks, takes her to his place where he treats her to good dinner. Upon the inspection, she finds the place poor and ugly (nothing \\"besides the easy- chairs, the sofa, the lamps and the rugs\\") next to her masters' apartments, rich with all manner of rubbish. On the plus side, the host gives her not a single kick, which feels like a novelty. Finally, she goes to sleep, dreaming nostalgically of how Luka's son Fedyushka used to lovingly 'play' with her by way of using her \\"...as a bell, that is, shake her violently by the tail so that she squealed and barked\\", as well as giving her a piece of meat to swallow and then \\"with loud laugh, pull[ing] it back again from her stomach\\", by a thread he'd fixed it with. Chapter 3. New and Very Agreeable Acquaintances. In the morning Kashtanka meets (and, after a bout of initial hostility, befriends) her neighbours: a gander named Ivan Ivanovich, who talks much nonsense, and the old white tom-cat Fyodor Timofeyitch, a lazy creature with highly skeptical mindset. From her new master she receives a new name, Tyotka (Auntie). Chapter 4. Marvels on a Hurdle. The trio, completed by the pig Khavronya Ivanovna, and supervised by their trainer, starts to perform most wonderful tricks, like bell-ringing, pistol-shooting and, most importantly climbing one another to form what's known in their master's parlance as the Egyptian Pyramid. Kashtanka is intrigued and delighted with the show. The next night sees her moving into the gander and cat's apartment. Chapter 5. \\"Talent! Talent!\\" A month passes, and Auntie gets used to her new life, full of good dinners and exhausting but joyful training sessions during which she walks on hind legs, catch sugar, dance and 'sing' (by way of accompanying music by howling). Finally, she becomes Fyodor Timofeyitch's sub in Egyptian Pyramid. The master is delighted ith Auntie's progress. Still, every evening brings her a whiff of sadness, as she continues to dream wistfully of her wonderful past with the rude and silly carpenter and his sadistically-minded little boy. Chapter 6. An Uneasy Night. The tragedy strikes: Ivan Ivanovich dies. It transpires that a horse had accidentally stepped upon him earlier in the day. Everybody is greatly distressed, thoughts of imminent death creep into both the dog and the cat's heads. Chapter 7. An Unsuccessful D√©but. Several days passes. The team leaves the house for a performance in which Kashtanka is for the first time to substitute the late Ivan Ivanovich at the base of the Egyptian Pyramid. The master is nervous and full of dark premonitions. The show starts well: Kashtanka performs some tricks, then prepares to do the singing and dancing routine, then... \\"Look out, dad, that's our Kahtanka!\\" she hears Fedyushka's voice in the audience. Mad with joy, she rushes off stage, to greet her old family. Half an hour later she's on the street with them, happy to return to her good old life of hunger, full of abuse and drunken Luka's eloquence, mostly in the form of one, oft-repeated observation: \\"You, Kashtanka, are an insect of a creature, and nothing else. Beside a man, you are much the same as a joiner beside a cabinet-maker.\\" Reception The reaction to the story was extremely warm, but several reviewers expressed their dissatisfaction with its finale. In an 8 January 1888 letter Yakov Polonsky wrote to Chekhov: \\"For a New Year Day you treated us with two fine stories, \\"Kashtanka\\" and \\"The Easter Tale\\"In later editions known as \\"A Story Without a Title\\", \\"–ë–µ–∑ –ù–∞–∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è\\" and I am happy to inform you that everybody here are delighted with them.... It's just that it seemed to me that \\"Kashtanka\\"'s final scene bears the mark of either tiredness or haste.

For NP of a sufficiently small size, on the order of tens of nanometers (nm), the NP exhibit paramagnetic properties, i.e., they have little or no magnetic moment. When they are exposed to a small external magnetic field, on the order of a few millitesla (mT), the NP align with that field and exhibit ferromagnetic properties with large magnetic moments. Following removal of the magnetizing field, the NP slowly become thermalized, decaying with a distinct time constant from the ferromagnetic state back to the paramagnetic state. This time constant depends strongly upon the NP diameter and whether they are unbound or bound to an external surface such as a cell. Measurement of this decaying magnetic field is typically done by superconducting quantum interference detectors (SQUIDs). The magnitude of the field during the decay process determines the magnetic moment of the NPs in the source. A spatial contour map of the field distribution determines the location of the source in three dimensions as well as the magnetic moment.  Superparamagnetic nanoparticles for SPMR applications  SPMR measurements depend on the characteristics of the nanoparticle (NP) that is used. The NP must have the property that the bulk material is normally ferromagnetic in the bulk. Magnetite (Fe3O4) is one such example as it is ferromagnetic when below its Curie temperature. However, if the NPs are single domain, and of a size less than ~50 nm, they exhibit paramagnetic properties even below the Curie temperature due to the energy of the NP being dominated by thermal activity rather than magnetic energy. If an external magnetic field is applied, the NPs align with that field and have a magnetic moment now characteristic of ferromagnetic behavior. When this external field is removed, the NPs relax back to their paramagnetic state. The size of the NP determines the rate of decay of the relaxation process after the extinction of the external magnetization field. The NP decay rate also depends on whether the particle is bound (tethered) to a surface, or is free to rotate. The latter case is dominated by thermal activity, Brownian motion. For the bound case, the decay rate is given by the N√©el equation :\\\\tau^{}_N = \\\\tau^{}_{0} \\\\exp( K V / k_\\\\text{B} T ) Here the value of 0 is normally taken as 0 ‚âà 10‚àí10 s, is the anisotropy energy density of the magnetic material (1.35 √ó 104 J/T), the magnetic core volume, B is Boltzmann‚Äôs constant, and is the absolute temperature. This exponential relationship between the particle volume and the decay time implies a very strong dependence on the diameter of the NP used in SPMR studies, requiring precise size restrictions on producing these particles. For magnetite, this requires a particle diameter of ~25 nm. The NP also require high monodispersity around this diameter as NP a few nm below this value will decay too fast and a few nm above will decay too slowly to fit into the time window of the measurement. The value of the time constant, N, depends on the method of fabrication of the NP. Different chemical procedures will produce slightly different values as well as different NP magnetic moments. Equally important characteristics of the NP are monodispersity, single domain character, and crystalline structure.  Magnetizing field and magnetic sensors  A system of magnetic coils are used for magnetizing the NP during SPMR measurements such as those used for medical research applications. The subject of investigation may be living cell cultures, animals, or humans. The optimum magnitude of the magnetizing field will saturate the NP magnetic moment, although physical coil size and electrical constraints may be the limiting factor. The use of magnetizing fields that provide a uniform field across the subject in one direction is desirable, as it reduces the number of variables when solving the inverse electromagnetic problem to determine the coordinates of NP sources in the sample. A uniform magnetizing field may be obtained with the use of Helmholtz coils. The magnetizing field is applied for a sufficient time to allow the NP dipole moment to reach its maximum value. This field is then rapidly turned off > 1 msec, followed by a short duration to allow for any induced currents from the magnetizing field pulse to die away. Following this, the sensors are turned on and measure the decaying field for a sufficient time to obtain an accurate value of the decay time constant; 1‚Äì3 s. Magnetizing fields of ~5 mT for a Helmholtz coil of 1 m in diameter are used. The magnetic sensors that measure the decaying magnetic fields require high magnetic field sensitivity in order to determine magnetic moments of NP with adequate sensitivity. SQUID sensors, similar to those used in magnetoencephalography are appropriate for this task. Atomic magnetometers also have adequate sensitivity. Unshielded environments reduce expense and provide greater flexibility in location of the equipment but limit the sensitivity of the measurement to ~ 1 pT. This is offset by reducing the effect of external electromagnetic noise with noise reduction algorithms. A contour map of the decaying magnetic fields is used to localize the sources containing bound NP. This map is produced from the field distribution obtained from an array of SQUID sensors, multiple positions of the sources under the sensors, or a combination of both. The magnetic moments of the sources is obtained during this procedure.  Magnetic field decay of bound particles  The time of the NP decaying magnetic field for bound particles in SPMR measurements is on the order of seconds. Unbound particles of similar size decay on the order of milliseconds, contributing very little to the results. The decay curve for bound NP is fit by an equation of the form :F-a_0+a_1\\\\ln(1+a_2/t)+a_3\\\\exp(-t/a_4) or :F=a_0+a_1\\\\exp(-t/a_2)+a_3\\\\exp(-t/a_4) The constants are fit to the experimental data and a particular time point is used to extract the value of the magnetic field. The fields from all the sensor positions are then used to construct a field contour map.  Localization of sources‚Äîthe inverse problem  Localization of magnetic sources producing the SPMR fields is done by solving the inverse problem of electromagnetism. The forward electromagnetic problem consists of modeling the sources as magnetic dipoles for each magnetic source or more complex configurations that model each source as a distributed source. Examples of the latter are multiple models, Bayesian models, or distributed dipole models. The magnetic dipole model has the form : \\\\mathbf{B}( \\\\mathbf{r} ) = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0}}{4\\\\pi} \\\\frac{ 3 \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}}( \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}} ) - \\\\mathbf{p} }{n^3} , \\\\qquad \\\\text{where} \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{n} = \\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_{0}, \\\\quad \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{n}} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{n}}{n}, \\\\quad n = \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\mathbf{n} \\\\right\\\\vert, where r0 and p are the location and dipole moment vectors of the magnetic dipole, and \\\\mu_{0} is the magnetic permeability of free space. For a subject containing Np sources, a minimum of 4Np measurements of the magnetic field are required to determine the coordinates and magnetic moment of each source. In the case where the particles have been aligned by the external magnetizing field in a particular orientation, 3Np measurements are required to obtain solutions. This latter situation leads to increased accuracy for finding the locations of objects as fewer variables are required in the inverse solution algorithm. Increased number of measurements provides an over-determined solution, increasing the localization accuracy. Solving the inverse problem for magnetic dipole or more complex models is performed with non-linear algorithms. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is one approach to obtaining solutions to this non-linear problem. More complex methods are available from other biomagnetism programs. Coordinates and magnetic moments, for each source assumed to be present in the sample, are determined from solution of the inverse problem.  Functionalized NP and biological cells  One application of SPMR is the detection of disease and cancer. Ths is accomplished by functionalizing the NP with biomarkers, including cell antibodies (Ab). The functionalized NP+Ab may be subsequently attached to cells targeted by the biomarker in cell cultures, blood and marrow samples, as well as animal models. A variety of biochemical procedures are used to conjugate the NP with the biomarker. The resulting NP+Ab are either directly mixed with incubated blood or diseased cells, or injected into animals. Following injection the functionalized NP reside in the bloodstream until encountering cells that are specific to the biomarker attached to the Ab. Conjugation of NP with Ab followed by attachment to cells is accomplished by identifying particular cell lines expressing varying levels of the Ab by flow cytometry. The Ab is conjugated to the superparamagnetic iron oxide NP by different methods including the carbodiimide method. The conjugated NP+Ab are then incubated with the cell lines and may be examined by transmission-electron microscopy (TEM) to confirm that the NP+Ab are attached to the cells. Other methods to determine whether NP are present on the surface of the cell are confocal microscopy, Prussian blue histochemistry, and SPMR. The resulting carboxylate functionality of the polymer-encapsulated NPs by this method allows conjugation of amine groups on the Ab to the carboxylate anions on the surface of the NPs using standard two-step EDC/NHS chemistry.

PANEL: Prairie Postmodernists and New Wave Pioneers: 1980s Cinema ¬´ WFG :: Reflecting Light 1981‚Äì1996 Atom Egoyan, John Greyson, Ron Mann, Bruce McDonald, Don McKellar, Peter Mettler, Jeremy Podeswa and Patricia Rozema, along with producers Camelia Frieberg, Alexandra Raff√©, Colin Brunton, Janis Lundman and others came bursting on to the Canadian movie scene in the 1980s with fresh, original films that rejected not only Hollywood's formulaic dramas, but also the legacy of earlier English-Canadian cin√©astes (such as Don Shebib and Don Owen) who had made downbeat films about heartbreak and loss. Feature filmmaking in Ontario in the 1980s may stand as one of the most significant developments in the history of this country's cinema. Leading the way into features was Peter Mettler (whose 1982 film Scissere became the first student feature programmed by the Toronto Festival of Festivals, now the Toronto International Film Festival) and Mann (with two exceptional documentaries ‚Äì Imagine the Sound in 1981 and Poetry in Motion in 1982). Egoyan followed in 1984 with Next of Kin, a fictional comic feature about identity. Many of the young filmmakers (they were all under the age of 30) worked on each other's films. Mettler shot Egoyan's Next of Kin and Family Viewing (1987), Rozema's Passion: A Letter in 16mm (1985), Podeswa's Nion in the Kabaret de la Vita (1986) and McDonald's Knock! Knock! (1985), while McDonald edited Scissere, Egoyan's Family Viewing and Speaking Parts (1989), and Mann's Comic Book Confidential (1988). The Toronto New Wave: Where Are They Now?-Northernstars.ca McDonald also guest-edited the October 1988 ‚ÄúOutlaw Edition‚Äù of Cinema Canada that first publicized the existence of this new group of filmmakers. Despite the lack of a defining manifesto, the Toronto- based group existed through a close-knit sense of cooperation of a kind rarely seen in Canada since the growth of Quebec cinema in the early sixties. Two major events of the 1980s gave credence and cash to these young Toronto filmmakers. In 1984, the Toronto Festival of Festivals held the largest retrospective of Canadian films ever programmed in Canada. This event premiered Perspective Canada, a Festival series that for 20 years was the most prestigious venue for launching English-Canadian features. Then, in 1986, the Ontario Film Development Corporation (OFDC) was founded, providing a much- needed funding alternative to the restrictions of the Ontario Arts Council and Telefilm Canada in Montreal. From the start, the OFDC was officially mandated to create an Ontario film culture. Under the guidance of its first CEO, Wayne Clarkson (who, as the former head of the Festival of Festivals, had been partially responsible for launching Perspective Canada), it proceeded to do so. The breakthrough came in 1987 when Rozema's first low-budget feature, I‚Äôve Heard the Mermaids Singing, won the Prix de la Jeunesse at the Cannes Film Festival. The film, and Rozema herself, received a tremendous amount of international press attention and Mermaids did something almost unheard of for an English-Canadian film: it made money at the box office. In the same year, Montreal's Festival du Nouveau Cin√©ma famously concluded with Wim Wenders publicly reassigning the first-place prize money from his Wings of Desire to Egoyan, whose Speaking Parts had received a special mention. A number of key New Wave films followed in the wake this stunning successes: Egoyan's The Adjuster (1991) and Exotica (which won the International Critics‚Äô Prize at Cannes in 1994); McDonald's Roadkill (1989) and Highway 61 (1991), both written by and starring McKellar; Greyson's Zero Patience (1994); and Mettler's The Top of His Head (1989) and Tectonic Plates (1992). In 1992, Geoff Pevere wrote a piece for retrospective of Canadian cinema that took place at the Georges Pompidou Centre in Paris (‚ÄúMiddle of Nowhere: Ontario Movies after 1980,‚Äù which was reprinted in Post Script in 1995). In it he described this ‚ÄúOntario New Wave‚Äù as ‚Äúone of the most vital and productive booms in the history of the country‚Äôs cinema‚Äù and a major ‚Äúsemantic reversal‚Äù that saw the artistic heart of Canadian filmmaking shift from Quebec to Ontario during the 1980s. Cameron Bailey explored this notion deeper in an article for a Special Issue of Take One: Film in Canada, Summer 2000 (devoted to the history of filmmaking in Ontario) entitled ‚ÄúStanding in the Kitchen All Night: A Secret History of the Toronto New Wave,‚Äù and later, Bailey's article was the basis for Brenda Longfellow's article (published in Toronto on Film): ‚ÄúSurfacing the Toronto New Wave: Policy, Paradigm Shifts and Post- Nationalism.‚Äù Far from representing the culmination of Ontario's seemly long- standing attempts at establishing itself as a viable production centre for big-budget commercial features made in North America, the most important films from the 1980s and early 1990s represented a reaction to and a break from this commercial model. The films of Toronto's New Wave were almost all low-budget, independent productions made for less than $1 million. Taking the Canadian cinema's essential themes of identity and alienation, Toronto's New Wave films offered an image of the province as a place of deep-rooted yearning and detachment, where the absence of a strong sense of identity and the quest for an identity is an identifying characteristic in itself. Unlike previous generations, this group of filmmakers avoided the easy lure of big money and bigger films in Hollywood. Instead, like their cinematic mentor David Cronenberg, they chose to stay and make a living in Canada, thus contributing greatly to the ongoing development of an indigenous film culture. However, project funding from the OFDC came to an end in 1996 with the June, 1995, election of the Mike Harris‚Äôs Conservatives, and one of the most creative and innovative periods in Canadian filmmaking history came to an abrupt end.

Opened in 1894 by the North British Railway, it was located at the present day Gorton Crossing engineer's siding where the ancient Rannoch Drove Road crossed the railway line. Alternative names recorded are Gorton Crossing Station; Gorton Farm; Gorton Platform; Gortan Railway Siding. To prevent confusion with the 'Gorton' in Manchester the LNER applied the name 'Gortan', suggesting that it appeared in timetables. It had originally been changed in 1928 from 'Gortan' to 'Gorton'. It was the least publicised station on the line and one reference states that it was discovered from time to time by journalists \\"short of copy\\".  History  Although the area seems remote the presence here of the ancient Rannoch drovers' road meant that travellers would have passed this way in reasonable numbers and a drove stance was even located at Gorton, used by shepherds for sheep and cattle well into the early 20th century. The West Highland Railway opened the line to passengers on 7 August 1894; later it was operated by the North British Railway, until in 1923 it became part of the London and North Eastern Railway. In 1948 the line became part of the Scottish Region of British Railways following nationalisation. The station was named after the nearby Ghortain or Gorton shepherd's cottage, now a bothy maintained by the Mountain Bothies Association. This building is where in 1889 James Bulloch, Charles Forman, J.E. Harrison, Major Martin, John Bett and N.B. McKenzie were taken after getting into severe difficulties whilst walking the route of the proposed West Highland Railway. Rannoch Station School was once used by the children from Gorton and Strathtulla. Gorton was a useful crossing point on the long single track section between Bridge of Orchy and Rannoch and originally had the typical island platform, a signal box and housing for the signalman and his family. A condition imposed by the landowner, Lord Breadalbane, when the West Highland Railway sought permission to construct the line across Rannoch Moor was that the station would be private with no public access and indeed railway regulations laid down that any railway employee permitting the public to use the station would be dismissed from service. The signal box and various associated buildings were demolished following closure in circa 1964. The signal box had been a standard design similar to the one at Corrour. Gorton stands at 1100 ft (335 m) above sea level, lying around 9 miles (14 km) northeast of Achallader Farm from which there is a rough track as far as Gorton bothy; the last mile or so (2 km) being trackless. It is approximately the same distance from Rannoch; in this direction the last 1¬Ω miles or so (2.5 km), south of the forest boundary, are trackless with a major river crossing. A desolate and extremely remote site, drinking water, paraffin, coal, etc. were delivered by train. The water came from the tender of the engine involved or in milk churns from Fort William as Rannoch Moor's peaty water was too 'brackish' to drink. In the 1897 regulations for the exchange of goods between the North British Railway and the Caledonian Railway Gortan is recorded as a fully fledged station. Circa 1938 a carriage body was placed on the island platform to serve as a school for the railway workers children, the local shepherd at Gorton, Strathtulla and for others in the immediate area and was still present in 1960. Children had been educated at the Rannoch Station School using the timetabled trains, however this became overcrowded and a lady teacher made the journey up from Bridge of Orchy to Gorton with up to eleven pupils attending. A school is also marked on the OS map in a location close to Gorton'a shepherd's cottage. Platemen's bothy on east side of line at north end of platform, 26 August 1996. The dip in the skyline to the left of the bothy is the drovers' route to Glen Lyon.Haldane A.R.B, The Drove Roads of Scotland, Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd, 1st edition 1952, p 81 and map in pocket in cover. After closure of the signal box in 1975 due to the difficulty of recruiting signalmen at this location, the loop, previously lifted was reinstated in 1988 as an Engineer's siding, not a dedicated crossing loop although it could be switched in as required. The platform has been removed however controlling ground frames and containers as basic facilities for Network Rail or contractor use are located on site as required. It is a Radio Electronic Token Block exchange point. Rail tickets to Gorton could be purchased and examples still exist however it was in many ways more isolated than Corrour. A platelayers hut stood on the western side of the tracks near the station on the route towards Rannoch station. The mail service for those living in Gorton and Strathtulla was via mail pouch from Bridge of Orchy that was carried by goods trains and delivered to the Gorton signalman.

It was located on North Avenue between Charles Street and Lovegrove Alley and extended north to 20th Street. It was constructed by the Arctic Skating Company, managed by Gerald T. Hopkins, Jr. The ice rink was used for pleasure skating and ice sports, including early games of ice hockey. The artificial ice was constructed by laying several layers of waterproof paper and wool. On top of this was built a 4-inch tall watertight pan, which held the water. In the pan were three and one-half miles of one and a half inch pipe which held ammonia, cooled below the freezing point of water. The cold pipes then caused the ice to freeze. The construction of the rink had been opposed by local churches in the area that were concerned about the noise made by the crowds enjoying the facility. The building opened on December 26, 1894, and featured a seven-per-side game of ice hockey between a team of Johns Hopkins University students and players from the Baltimore Athletic Club. The game ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw. This may have been the first game of ice hockey played on a sheet of artificial ice and was one of the first in the United States. The game was 60 minutes, with two halves of 30 minutes. Attendance for the opening and game was recorded as about 2,500. On February 14, 1896, the rink hosted what is considered the first intercollegiate game of ice hockey in the United States, a game between Yale University and Johns Hopkins. Yale, captained by Malcolm Chace, won the game 2‚Äì1, with Chace scoring both goals. The teams played six- per-side, (minus the rover) making the game an early instance of six-per-side hockey. For two seasons (1896‚Äì97 and 1897‚Äì98) the rink hosted the Baltimore Hockey League, composed of Johns Hopkins University, the Maryland Athletic club, Northampton Hockey Club, Walbrook Athletic Club (in 1897‚Äì98 only) and the University of Maryland. The last competitive ice hockey games at the rink as reported by The Baltimore Sun and the Baltimore American were held on March 10, 1898, between Johns Hopkins and University of Maryland, and a second game between Walbrook and the Maryland Athletic Club to decide the hockey league championship. Hopkins and Maryland tied 2‚Äì2 and Walbrook won 2‚Äì0. The league decided to not replay the tie and the championship was awarded to the University of Maryland. On March 11 and March 12, the New York City Hockey Club played exhibition games at the rink against \\"All-Baltimore\\" teams made up of players from all teams in the Baltimore league. The facility was used for other events than ice hockey and pleasure skating outside of the winter months. In April 1897, the Baltimore Kennel Association held a dog show at the facility. A programme of vaudeville was held at the Palace in June and July 1898. In November 1898, the ice machinery was removed and the surface changed for roller skating and roller hockey. In 1899, the building was sold by trustee at auction on October 31, 1899 for $38,000. It was resold for $65,000 then sold again in 1900 to the United Milk Producer's Association of Baltimore which bought the facility to be used for manufacturing and storage. In 1932, the \\"Sports Centre\\" ice rink was built on the location of the old ice rink by the Casino Amusement Corporation.

Established by Frank Ernandes in 1995, the restaurant was housed in a former fire station and became known for its wood-fired pizzas and pasta. In 2016, plans emerged for a developer to replace the building, along with others, to build a new 12-story apartment building. Touch√© closed in May 2017. Description and history Touch√© was an Italian restaurant with an upstairs billiards hall, established in 1995 by Frank Ernandes. It was housed in a former fire station, built in 1913, and located on a 5,000-square-foot lot at the intersection of Northwest 14th Avenue and Glisan Street. The restaurant became known for its wood-fired pizzas and pasta entrees. The firehouse was listed on the City of Portland's Historic Resource Inventory for its 20th-century Italian Renaissance architecture and historic importance. According to the Historic Resource Inventory, the building was designed for Engine and Truck Company #3 and was \\"one of four stations of similar design erected on the west side, all designed by Battalion Chief Lee Holden, father of the gas-driven fire boat. This station was originally designed for horse-drawn apparatus and was remodeled later to accommodate mechanized fire equipment.\\" In 1967, the station was sold and the building served as a warehouse and freight outlet. Portland's first restaurant to serve wood-fired Italian pizzas, Perlina, opened in the building in 1992, and was replaced by Touch√© in 1995. Robert Ames and James Puckett owned the building, as of 2016. In April 2016, Touch√©'s general manager confirmed a developer's plans to demolish the former firehouse, along with two neighboring restaurants, and construct a 12-story apartment building in its place. In an online post, the restaurant's staff confirmed its last day would be May 14, 2017: > Our wonderful run is coming to an end.

(The largest of the four islands is Al-Hallaniyah at .) There were 54 survivors who reached the island on which Diana had wrecked. Sometime after 15 July 1820 two Arab buggalows (dhows) arrived at the island. They were on their way from Zanzibar to Muscat and had stopped at the island to get water. They took the survivors to Muscat, minus four Portuguese seamen who had earlier constructed a raft.Asiatic Journal and Monthly Miscellany (July 1821), Vol. 21, pp.93-94. One of the buggalows was also carrying the crew of Nadir Shah, which had wrecked at Zanzibar. At Muscat the survivors went on board Robarts, which conveyed them to Bombay, arriving on 22 May 1821.Asiatic Journal (May 1821), Vol. 11, p.522.

It is motivated by the belief that economic processes such as financial transactions have much in common with quantum processes, and can be appropriately modeled using the quantum formalism. It draws on techniques from the related areas of quantum finance and quantum cognition, and is a sub-field of quantum social science.  History  A number of economists including Paul Samuelson and Bernard Schmitt (whose \\"quantum macroeconomics\\" treated production as an instantaneous emission ) have found inspiration in quantum theory. Perhaps the first to directly exploit quantum techniques in economic analysis, however, was the Pakistani mathematician Asghar Qadir. In his 1978 paper Quantum Economics, he argued that the formalism of quantum mechanics is the best mathematical framework for modeling situations where \\"consumer behavior depends on infinitely many factors and that the consumer is not aware of any preference until the matter is brought up.\\" He proposed that, like particles in quantum mechanics, \\"the individual as an entity ... can be thought of as a point in a Hilbert space.\\" Qadir's paper received little attention. However, during the 1990s, workers in the field of quantum cognition indeed showed that many aspects of human decision-making, including those involved in economic decisions, seemed to follow a kind of quantum logic. At the same time, researchers such as economist Martin Shubik, physicist Martin Schaden and social scientist Emmanuel Haven were beginning to use the quantum formalism to model the uncertainty of stock markets. In his 2007 book Quantum Finance: Path Integrals and Hamiltonians for Options and Interest Rates, Belal E. Baaquie showed how methods from quantum physics could be applied to things like the pricing of financial options. However he wrote that the ‚Äò‚Äôlarger question of applying the formalism and insights of (quantum) physics to economics, and which forms a part of the larger subject of econophysics, is left for future research.‚Äô‚Äô In their 2013 book Quantum Social Science, Emmanuel Haven and Andrei Khrennikov extended Baaquie‚Äôs work in finance, and showed how quantum techniques could be used to model a number of issues in economics more broadly, such as arbitrage and the reflexivity theory of George Soros. In a 2016 paper and book (the latter co-authored with journalist Roman Chlupat√Ω), the mathematician David Orrell proposed a quantum theory of money and value, which states that money has dualistic, quantum properties because of the way that it merges the exact concept of number with the fuzzy concept of value. His 2018 book Quantum Economics: The New Science of Money described a quantum economics which combined this view of money with the insights of quantum finance and quantum social science. In a 2019 article for the Bretton Woods Committee, Andrew Sheng wrote that ‚ÄúA quantum paradigm of finance and the economy is slowly emerging, and its nonlinear, complex nature may help the design of a future global economy and financial architecture ... Financial assets and virtual liabilities have quantum characteristics of entanglement with each other that are not yet fully understood.\\"  Description  Just as quantum physics differs in fundamental ways from classical physics, quantum economics differs from neoclassical economics in a number of key respects. Neoclassical economics is based on expected utility theory, which combines utility theory to model people‚Äôs preferences, and probability theory to model expectations under uncertainty. However the field of quantum cognition calls these assumptions into question, since people don‚Äôt necessarily have fixed preferences, or base their decisions on probability theory. Many of the findings of behavioral economics are inconsistent with classical logic, but agree with quantum decision theory of the sort assumed in quantum social science. In financial applications, neoclassical economics is associated with the efficient market theory. As Haven and Khrennikov show, this condition has come under increasing question since the financial crisis, but can easily be relaxed using a quantum formalism. Neoclassical economics assumes that people act independently while making economic decisions. Quantum economics notes that financial actors are part of an entangled system, as in quantum game theory. Quantum economics also stresses the importance of financial transactions and in particular the role of money as an active force in the economy, for example in the way that it entangles debtors and creditors through loans. Quantum economics can therefore be viewed as an alternative to neoclassical economics which begins from a different set of assumptions.

Work  Educated at first in Electrical Engineering, Day's work developed into the fields of mechanical, construction, civil and management engineering. It is not without reason his biographer Taylor, H. Birchard (1953) named him a \\"Symbol of American Industrial Genius.\\"Taylor, H. Birchard, Charles Day (1879-1931) Symbol of American Industrial Genius. Newcomen Society of North America, 1953. In the mentioned 1911 article in The American Magazine by Frederick Winslow Taylor, Day was presented as \\"Charles P. DayIt is unclear whether or not this was a spelling error in the name Charles P. Day. No secondary source confirms any middle name. of Philadelphia, an efficiency engineer, who adopted Scientific Management to the construction of factories and manufacturing plants.\\" For the design of manufacturing plants and civil works, Day co-founded his own engineering firm that still exists today. Day did more than just adopt ideas, and brought them into practice. He developed one or two innovative graphical techniques, and with that contributed to the graphic history of scientific management. = Day & Zimmermann = In 1901 Day and Kern Dodge laid the foundation for the engineering company Day & Zimmermann. According to American Society of Civil Engineers (1975) the two founders both had in common, that they \\"dreamed of a new and revolutionary business: Modernizing Engineering... [However] in those early days their assets were a modest shed building, high hopes and a good idea. They had no clients.\\"American Society of Civil Engineers. Philadelphia Section (1976). History of civil engineering and construction in the Delaware Valley The story how it all started, has been told: :\\"... Their ad in American Machinist drew one response ‚Äî from the owner of a firm In New York who said he was curious to see a \\"Modernizing Engineer\\" and wanted the young men to \\"drop in sometime\\". Day and Dodge did drop in and the next morning they added their first client to their list of assets. In the early 1900s time studies, efficiency experts and program planning were virtually unknown. Management and administration had not kept up with dramatic engineering developments. Dodge and Day introduced a new concept which they called Betterment Reports ‚Äî assessment and evaluation studies to help industries' management become more efficient, aggressive and progressive...\\"Harold L. Yoh (1981, 11) One of the first notable engineering accomplishments of the Day & Zimmermann company was the design of the construction of the Gatun Lock System, one of the Panama Canal locks in 1907. The construction of the Gatun Lock began with the first concrete laid at Gatun, on August 24, 1909, by the Philadelphia-based company Day, Dodge & Zimmermann. Gatun Locks under construction, circa 1913 In these early days the company did some graphic design as well. It was contacted by the Hershey chocolate company to produce the foil wrapper for Hershey's Kisses. = \\"The Machine Shop Problem,\\" 1903 = In the 1903 paper entitled \\"The Machine Shop Problem\\" in the Transactions of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Day presented a method for the analysis and organization design of machine shops based on the Taylor System. The first subject of discussion was the subdivision of the departments of a machine shop. For this matter a general subdivision and a further subdivision can be made. The following topics of discussion were the means of attaining economical production in the machine shop, the Question of Power Application with Courses to fulfill the conditions, and the advantages derived from the use of individual motors on machine tools. The last topic was the graphical distribution of costs, showing cost value of operations.Charles Day (1903) = Routing diagram = The 1909 article in the Engineering Magazine entitled The routing diagram as a basis for laying out industrial plants proposed a new type of graphic illustration of the material flow through industrial plants, named the routing diagram. The first presentation itself had the following intention: :\\"The primary purpose of this article is to call attention to the advantages that can be derived from the use of the graphical routing diagram as a basis for the planning of industrial plants. This diagram, as its name implies, indicates the paths or routes followed by the materials of manufacture when passing from their crude to their finished state, and in its final development it absolutely defines the plant in all particulars of layout.\\"Day (1909, 809) The graphic method presented consisted of two types of routing diagram, a perspective routing diagram and a detail routing diagram, combined with an exterior view. The article itself gives as an example the design of a gasoline automobile factory. The given graphics deliver complementary views with: * Perspective routing diagram, in outline, showing paths followed during manufacture of principal units entering into gasoline automobiles * Exterior view of automobile plant to which the routing diagram relates * Detail Routing Diagram, Machine-tool equipment and paths or parts in a wagon- and carriage- axle plant These views were illustrated with the following three images: Despite this clear presentation, neither Charles Day nor anybody else is generally credited for making a seminal contribution to the routing diagram or route diagram. For example, in one of the first seminal works in the field, the 1923 book Industrial Management by Richard H. Lansburgh, there is a separate chapter \\"Factory Building and Plant Lay out.\\" This chapter discussed the matter with the similar three types of views, and some more, without any reference to the work of Charles Day. Instead of perspective routing diagram, Lansburgh speaks of vertical layout, and the detail routing diagram is named a flow chart.Lansburgh, Richard Hines. Industrial Management. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated, 1923; 2nd rev. ed, 1928; 3rd ed. with William R. Spriegel, 1940. pp. 135-146 With the articles of Wrege (1978), Wrege (1999) and others, there is a re-evaluation of these contributions. For example, the AA Files (2005, p. 50) summarized that: ::... this new route diagram was introduced by efficiency engineer Charles Day (1879-1931) in 1911 as the basis for the layout and design of industrial plants. Assuming that interior function should entirely determine a factory's layout. Day claimed that after the flow diagram was complete the building 'merely needed to be drawn around it'. This diagrammatic method assured that 'the imagination will not be drawn upon because the assumptions are based on absolute facts and not theory' - a positivist, objective stance that came to dominate ideas about flow diagrams. Day was not the first to introduce the concept of routing diagrams. For example, James Bray Griffith in his 1905 book Systematizing already contained a section on \\"Charting factory layout and routing\\" which contained two simplified routing diagrams for handling lumber, that he called arrangements.Griffith, James Bray (ed.). Systematizing. International Accountants' Society, inc. Detroit; The Book Keeper Press, 1905. p. 72 Another contemporary, Oscar E. Perrigo, published on the design of machine shops in his Modern machine shop (1906), looking at machine shop lay out and arrangements of machinery.Oscar E. Perrigo. Modern machine shop: construction, equipment and management New York, The N.W. Henley publishing company, 1906. In contrast to this work, Day did take this design problem to a next level by putting the dynamic interaction first. = Management of Navy yards = In 1911 Charles Day worked together with Henry Gantt and Harrington Emerson to study the management of Navy yards, which didn't work out right. Wren (2009) summarized that \\"their efforts went for naught when, following the Interstate Commerce Commission hearings in late 1911, the Secretary of the Navy announced that he would never allow scientific management to be applied in the nation‚Äôs shipyards.\\"Daniel A. Wren & Arthur G. Bedeian, The evolution of management thought, 1972; 6th edition (2009). p. 162 The breakthrough happened in the same period, as Wren (2009) further explained: :\\"Just prior to the war, Gantt had also served as a consultant to General William Crozier, head of the U.S. Army Ordnance Department. Crozier, impressed by Gantt‚Äôs graphic displays, developed a series of progress and performance charts to aid in managing army arsenals. When Gantt gave up his consulting work to aid in the war effort, he puzzled over how to track the huge amount of defense work being performed at so many different sites. Scheduling was especially crucial, and the information necessary to plan and coordinate private contractors‚Äô efforts with those of government agencies was lacking. Gantt spent three months trying to solve this puzzle before realizing that We have all been wrong in scheduling on a basis of quantities; the essential element in the situation is time, and this should be the basis in laying out any program....\\" The developments set in motion in those days did pave the way to the realization of Gantt charts.  Reception  = Early charts of information flow = In June 1903 Charles Day had presented a paper entitled The Machine Shop Problem as described above, in which he proposed a number of charts to be used in management. This paper was first presented at the Saratoga meeting of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). Day, by then still a junior ASME member, had presented his paper to an audience with among others Frederick Winslow Taylor, Henry Gantt and John Calder commenting on his ideas. It was John Calder (1903) who commented: :\\"Referring to Mr. Day's graphical method of illustrating certain routine in respect to manufacturing in the shop, I will say I think that is one of the most useful methods which a manager can have before him. It can be carried out in many different ways, so that not only the manager can from time to time refresh his memory as to the duties of the men by graphically illustrating to them, but he can also have the reference there before his eyes in the event of new men coming in, and by means of that graphic representation, can show them how to pick up their work much more quickly and put it through. It also enables one to pick out bad methods and prevent work retrograding. I would say, in conclusion, that the method Mr. Day has brought forward can be used generally, broadly, and also in detail, with great success. I hand in samples of charts which I have drawn up and use daily in the practical work of production...\\"ASME, Transactions, Vol. 24, 1903, p. 1320. For management historian Charles D. Wrege the work by Day and Calder were some of the earliest presenting charts of information flow. Wrege et al. (1999) summarized: :\\"... Charles Day and John Calder revealed a series of charts designed to outline information flow and to demonstrate the advantage of network analysis of alternative methods of modernizing factories...\\"Wrege, Charles D., Regina A. Greenwood, and Sakae Hata. \\"What we do not know about management history: Some categories of research and methods to uncover management history mysteries.\\" Journal of Management History 5.7 (1999): 414-424. There is no question one of the charts presented by Day is a network; charts that outline information flows were only presented by Calder. Day presented two organizational charts, and four more or less classification charts or concept maps. Furthermore, Wrege et al. (1999) mentioned how the story continued: :\\"... Day‚Äôs Company, Dodge and Day (later Day and Zimmerman), utilized his network charts, betterment reports and early form of decision trees until his death in 1933, building a consulting company worth millions. After Day‚Äôs death, Day and Zimmerman reportedly sold Day‚Äôs original charts to the Lockheed Company...\\" For Wrege this was an example of \\"What we do not know about management history,\\" because \\"their eventual fate and how they became incorporated into management information systems literature is still a mystery....\\" = Personal remembrance = In a 1931 appreciation the Electrical World T & D had the following summary of his reputation and accomplishments: :\\"Mr. Day was especially known as a specialist in public utility management and operation, although he first established a national reputation as an economist and exponent of manufacturing efficiency in industrial plants. After many years of successful work in the manufacturing field he extended his interest to the public utility field, and it was not long before his contacts became far reaching, embracing both the technical and the financial phases of the business.\\" On a more personal level H. Birchard Taylor (1952) in the first Charles Day lecture remembered: :\\"If you were to ask me to name Charles Day's personal attributes, I would reply: utter integrity; kindness; inexhaustible energy; and a rare gift of inspiring his associates with enthusiasm towards a constructive objective. His was true leadership...\\"H. Birchard Taylor. \\"Charles Day (1879-1931) Symbol of American Industrial Genius.\\" in: Journal of the Franklin Institute, Vol. 254, p. 20 Taylor further expressed Day's experience in scientific management since the early 1900s, and particularly his dealings with the Navy during World War I. In remembrance of his name, the Newcomen Society in North America has held an annual Charles Day lecture for decades.  Selected publications  * Charles Day.

Early life and education Riva Nyri Pr√©cil was born in Brooklyn. Her mother, Michelle Karshan, is an American of Russian and Irish descent and produced and hosted the radio show ‚ÄúSak Pase‚Äù (1991-1995) while her father, Privat Pr√©cil was a Haitian who worked in the US as a journalist and lawyer. Riva and her family moved to Haiti when she was five years old as her mother got a job in Haiti. Her mother worked for the Haitian government specifically on foreign press liaising, using her foreign heritage as an advantage to manage the foreign press who visited Haiti. While growing up in Haiti, Riva was exposed to and studied under many of the great masters of Haiti's cultural and artistic scene. She was in a theatre troupe, Ateliee Edoision, and took various dancing with Viviane Gauthier and Artcho Danse‚Äî sculpting, painting, and singing classes, which will later develop her as a wholesome artist skilled in several aspects of art. Riva learned her sculpting and painting skills from renowned Haitian artist, Jean-Claude \\"Tiga\\" Garoute. In her early teens, Riva already started to teach art classes to young children who were in her neighborhood. She was already musically influenced by her mother as she listened to exotic and various genres of music from all over the world starting from jazz and soul, to Indian and Arabic music. As her family was very open-minded to experience, she visited lots of Haitian Vodou ceremonies, learning both the beautiful and eerie parts of the Vodou culture. When Riva was fifteen she had to leave Haiti and return to New York because of the dangerous condition of Haiti due to a 2004 Haitian coup d'√©tat. While back in New York, she attended LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts as a sophomore where she majored in vocal performance. She graduated in 2007 and continued her education at Loyola University of New Orleans. She received her BA in Music Therapy in 2011 and completed her one- year residency in New York at Beth Israel Hospital. During her time in Loyola University, she became skillful in playing guitar and piano and continued singing. When the 2010 Haiti earthquake happened, Riva and few other Haitian students, who were less than ten people, organized a giant fundraiser to support people back in Haiti. Career =Singer= After Riva graduated Loyola University Riva came back to New York. In 2014, Riva realized the lack of Haitian Creole contents in the world and felt a ‚Äúsense of duty to dedicate herself to keep the Haitian art alive and conserve it for her ancestors and for her country.‚ÄùJeon, Yunil. Personal Interview, May 4, 2017. This led her to start working on her first album ‚ÄúPerle De Culture‚Äù. By meeting her present fiance in the end of 2013, Monvelyno Alexis, who also is a prominent musician, Riva worked with him to create an album independently. The songs were mainly traditional Haitian music with a modern twist. The songs were newly arranged in a jazz style by her fiance, Alexis. Riva worked during the daytime and recorded songs at night at a studio in Brooklyn called ‚ÄúKamoken Studio‚Äù. The studio was owned by Chico Boyer, who was a pioneer of Haitian roots music. He even personally participated in a few songs on the album as a bass player. In 2015, the album was completed and released through CD Baby which allowed Riva to officially launch herself and put her music out to the public. Ever since her album was released, she is constantly gigging around the world to promote Haitian culture and its beauty. She has performed at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival ‚Äîalongside Emeline Michel ‚ÄîCarifesta XII hosted in Haiti, the Haitian Flag Day Celebration at Brooklyn's Borough Hall, and various other ceremonies. Recently, she has been working with a label, ‚ÄúStrictly Rhythm‚Äù to musically expand her horizon and work in different styles of music such as Afro House and dance music. =Author= Her career as an author also started in 2014. Her interest in writing Haitian books initially started from translating children‚Äôs books in Haitian Creole from a non-profit organization, Li Li Li, organized by Riva and her mother to translate various children's book in Haitian Creole and to train people to read the books to children in Haiti after the collapse of a lot of schools in Haiti (2011‚Äì12). In 2014, Riva decided to write a children‚Äôs book about mermaids and their world underwater, which was set in Jacmel. She submitted her work to a Haitian short story competition hosted by Educa Vision, and by winning the competition her book, Ana√´lle Ak Lasir√®n, was published in 2015. =Styles and influences= Ever since she was young, she was influenced by various genres of music originating from all parts of the world. However, she was primarily influenced by Haitian music, and jazz, which allowed her to grow up to be the musician she is now. Her style of music and vocals came through as she successfully merged jazz and Haitian music. Her muses, who influenced her ever since she was young, are Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and Sarah Vaughan. She actually performed Holiday‚Äôs and Fitzgerald's pieces for her audition to enter LaGuardia High School for Performing Arts. Other ventures After Riva graduated from Loyola University, she introduced \\"Love, Nyri\\", a modern handmade jewelry line, in 2012. The design of the jewelry is very much inspired by a traditional Haitian jewelry style. Nowadays, most of her products are custom order. The materials used range from brass, gold, silver, crystals, to various gems. As Riva has been taking dance classes since she was young and has taught several dance classes for the 2010 Haiti earthquake fundraiser, she continues to teach traditional Haitian dance in New York City. Her current dance class ‚Äútout se pa‚Äù which means ‚Äúno wrong steps‚Äù covers traditional Haitian dances such as Yanvalou, Congo, Nago, Ibo, Mayi, Rabonday, and Banda. Her dance class is targeted towards Haitians in New York City who never had a chance to experience their own culture. She is a prominent performer and has performed at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Carifesta XII hosted in Haiti, and the Haitian Flag Day Celebration at Brooklyn's Borough Hall. She was a panelist and performer at the Women's Empowerment Luncheon hosted by the Haitian American Student Association at Syracuse University in February 2016. Riva performs in New York City alongside her band Bohio Music.

A photographer from Russian News Agency TASS was present, but no other press. On May 10, 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed classified information to Russian government representatives, creating political and security concerns in the United States and its allies, especially Israel. Soon after the meeting, American intelligence extracted a high-level covert source from within the Russian government, on concerns the individual could be at risk due, in part, to Trump and his administration repeatedly mishandling classified intelligence. Oval Office disclosure to Russia =Disclosure in May 2017= President Donald Trump discussed classified information provided by a U.S. ally regarding a planned Islamic State operation during an Oval Office meeting on May 10, 2017 with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, providing sufficient details that could be used by the Russians to deduce the identity of the ally and the manner in which it was collected, according to current and former government officials. The meeting had been closed to the U.S. press, although a photographer from the Russian press contingent was present. The disclosure was first reported in The Washington Post on May 15, 2017. White House staff initially denied the report, but the following day Trump defended the disclosure, stating that he has the \\"absolute right\\" to \\"share\\" intelligence with Russia. It was later reported that Israel was the source of the information. Israel did not confirm or deny the report but released a statement stating full confidence in the intelligence sharing relationships with the United States. Ynetnews, an Israeli news website, had previously reported on January 12 that in a meeting held in early January (during Trump's presidential transition), U.S. intelligence officials advised Israeli Mossad and other intelligence officials to \\"be careful\\" when transferring intelligence information to the Trump White House and administration until the possibility of Russian influence over Trump, suggested by Christopher Steele's report (commonly referred as the Trump‚ÄìRussia dossier), has been fully investigated. U.S. officials were concerned that the information, particularly about sensitive intelligence sources, could be passed to Russia and then to Iran. Two Israeli intelligence officials confirmed privately that Trump's disclosure of the intelligence to Russia was \\"for us, our worst fears confirmed.\\" They said the disclosure jeopardizes Israel's \\"arrangement with America which is unique to the world of intelligence sharing\\" and that Israeli officials were \\"boiling mad and demanding answers\\". The report was described as \\"shocking\\" and \\"horrifying\\" by some commentators and former U.S. intelligence officials. According to current and former U.S. officials interviewed by ABC News, Trump's disclosure endangered the life of a spy placed by Israel in ISIL-held territory in Syria. The classified information Trump shared came from a source described as the most valuable of any current sources on any current external plotting, according to The Wall Street Journal. =Reporting= On May 15, 2017, The Washington Post, citing anonymous sources, reported that the intelligence was about an ISIL plot to stealthily use laptops as weapons that can then explode in Western countries, and that a Middle Eastern ally provided the intelligence, which was codeword- classified, meaning that its distribution was restricted only to those who were explicitly cleared to read it, and was not intended to be shared beyond the United States and certain allies. The incident was later reported by The New York Times, Buzzfeed, and Reuters. The officials talking to BuzzFeed said, \\"it's far worse than what has already been reported.\\" Immediately after Trump's disclosure, \\"which one of the officials described as spontaneous\\", \\"senior White House officials appeared to recognize quickly that Trump had overstepped and moved to contain the potential fallout.\\" Immediately after the meeting, Thomas P. Bossert, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, telephoned the directors of the CIA and the NSA to inform them what had occurred. The incident was seen as a pivot away from traditional American allies, and towards closer relations with Russia, and raised questions on Trump's respect for the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing agreement. Several commentators stated that by releasing classified information to Russia, Trump jeopardized American and allied intelligence sources, breached the trust relationship with America's foreign partners, threatened the long term national security of the country and violated his oath of office through \\"gross negligence\\". All of these actions are possible legal grounds towards efforts to impeach Donald Trump. Aides privately defended the President, stating that Trump did not have sufficient interest or knowledge of the intelligence gathering process to leak specific sources or methods of intelligence gathering; National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster publicly maintained that Trump had not been briefed on the origins of the intelligence in question, and therefore could not have compromised the source. According to conservative commentator Erick Erickson, multiple sources have stated that the leaks were far worse than the current reports, and the leaker is a strong supporter of Trump who believed it was necessary to publicly disclose the story because of Trump's inability to accept criticism. =White House response = White House staff initially denied the veracity of the report during the evening of May 15. In a press briefing on the same day, McMaster denied The Washington Post report, saying, \\"At no time, at no time, were intelligence sources or methods discussed. And the president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known. Two other senior officials who were present, including the secretary of state, remember the meeting the same way and have said so. And their on-the-record accounts should outweigh those of anonymous sources.\\" He concluded by saying, \\"I was in the room, it didn't happen.\\" McMaster said that \\"it was wholly appropriate to share\\" the information because of a similar ISIL plot two years earlier. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated that \\"common efforts and threats regarding counter-terrorism\\" were discussed in the meeting with Lavrov, but not \\"sources, methods or military operations\\". Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy Dina Habib Powell flatly rejected the Post article, saying: \\"This story is false. The president only discussed the common threats that both countries faced.\\" On May 16, Trump implicitly confirmed a disclosure in a tweet, claiming that, \\"As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining ... to terrorism and airline flight safety. Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism.\\" =Origin of the intelligence= The May 15 The Washington Post article reported that the intelligence came from an unnamed Middle Eastern ally. On May 16, The New York Times named the relevant ally and source of the intelligence as Israel, saying that as a consequence, Trump's boasts to the Russian envoys could damage America's relationship with Israel and endanger Israel's security if Russia passes the intelligence on to Iran, Israel's main threat in the Middle East. The intelligence was so sensitive that it hadn't even been shared among key U.S. allies. Israeli intelligence officials were reportedly horrified by the disclosure. In public comments, Israeli officials including intelligence minister Yisrael Katz, Ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer, and Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the intelligence services of the two countries would continue to share information, with Dermer saying \\"Israel has full confidence in our intelligence-sharing relationship with the United States.\\" However, speaking privately, unnamed Israeli sources said they might need to reassess what intelligence they share with the U.S. Israeli officials stated that it is Israel's \\"worst fears confirmed\\" about Donald Trump. The officials also stated that Israeli intelligence officers were \\"boiling mad and demanding answers\\" on its current intelligence-sharing agreement with the US. On May 22, while visiting Israel, Trump appeared to confirm both the disclosure and the identity of Israel as the source, telling the press \\"Folks, folks, just so you understand, just so you understand, I never mentioned the word or the name Israel during that conversation.\\" It had been widely reported before May 22 that Israel was the source. =Reactions = U.S. Congress  Speaker of the House Republican Paul Ryan said through a spokesman that he \\"hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration\\". Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that the allegations were \\"very, very troubling\\" if true. Senator John McCain called the report \\"deeply disturbing\\" and said that \\"Reports that this information was provided by a U.S. ally and shared without its knowledge sends a troubling signal to America's allies and partners around the world and may impair their willingness to share intelligence with us in the future.\\" McCain stated: \\"Regrettably, the time President Trump spent sharing sensitive information with the Russians was time he did not spend focusing on Russia's aggressive behavior, including its interference in American and European elections, its illegal invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, its other destabilizing activities across Europe, and the slaughter of innocent civilians and targeting of hospitals in Syria.\\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said, \\"The president owes the intelligence community, the American people and Congress a full explanation\\". and Senator Dick Durbin, the Senate Democratic Whip, said that Trump's conduct was \\"dangerous\\" and \\"reckless\\". Senator Jack Reed, the ranking Democratic member of the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, said, \\"President Trump's recklessness with sensitive information is deeply disturbing and clearly problematic.\\" The Democratic National Committee issued a statement, which included this: \\"If Trump weren't president, his dangerous disclosure to Russia could end with him in handcuffs.\\" Foreign countries  Reaction from foreign countries was generally negative. A top European intelligence official said that sharing of intelligence with the United States would cease if the country confirms that Trump did indeed share classified information with Russia, because sharing intel with Americans while Trump is president could put their sources at risk. Burkhard Lischka, a member of the German Bundestag's intelligence oversight committee, said that if Trump \\"passes this information to other governments at will, then Trump becomes a security risk for the entire western world\\". Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova denied the U.S. media reports.  Academics  Several professors of law, political science, and international relations, as well as intelligence experts, were alarmed by Trump's disclosure. Intelligence expert Amy Zegart of Stanford University noted that Trump revealed code word intelligence, which is the highest layer of classification, even higher than the \\"top secret\\" classification. Such information, if revealed, could reasonably be expected to cause \\"exceptionally grave damage\\" to the national security of the United States. She wrote, \\"so just how bad is the damage? On a scale of 1 to 10‚Äîand I'm just ball parking here‚Äîit's about a billion.\\" Counterterrorism expert Daniel Byman of Georgetown University said that disclosures such as Trump's could jeopardize intelligence sharing relationships, which \\"perhaps more than any other policy instrument ... play a vital role in counterterrorism against global terrorist groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda.\\" The effects could be \\"disastrous\\". Professor Jack Goldsmith and other contributors to the Lawfare Blog said that Trump's release of classified information could be a violation of the President's oath of office: \\"There's thus no reason why Congress couldn't consider a grotesque violation of the President's oath as a standalone basis for impeachment‚Äîa high crime and misdemeanor in and of itself. This is particularly plausible in a case like this, where the oath violation involves giving sensitive information to an adversary foreign power. That's getting relatively close to the \\"treason\\" language in the impeachment clauses; it's pretty easy to imagine a hybrid impeachment article alleging a violation of the oath in service of a hostile foreign power. So legally speaking, the matter could be very grave for Trump even though there is no criminal exposure.\\" While the authors argued Trump \\"did not violate any criminal law concerning the disclosure of classified information\\" because of the president's broad authority to declassify information, another legal scholar, Professor Stephen Vladeck, wrote that the president's \\"constitutional power over national security information\\" is not unfettered and that Trump's disclosure \\"may actually have been illegal under federal law.\\" Harvard Law emeritus professor Alan Dershowitz called the incident \\"the most serious charge ever made against a sitting president\\" and said that it was \\"devastating\\", with \\"very serious political, diplomatic, and international implications\\". =Aftermath= Leaking of sensitive information by the U.S. has led to the review of intelligence sharing arrangements by key allies, and also a review by the Department of Justice regarding the leaks from the United States. Soon after the Oval Office meeting, intelligence officials reportedly became concerned about the safety of a high-level CIA source within the Putin government, and decided to bring him out of Russia. The source had refused an earlier offer to extract him. The extraction, or \\"exfiltration\\", was carried out sometime in 2017. CNN and other news sources reported on this extraction in September 2019, along with details about the Russian. One source told CNN that the decision to remove him was based in part on concern about the Trump administration's mishandling of classified information. However, other sources said the concern for his safety was primarily based on a 2017 CIA report about Russian interference in the election, which had such specific information it might make Russia suspect a high-placed spy. A CIA spokesperson said the news reports were \\"misguided speculation\\", and a White House spokesperson said the reporting was \\"incorrect\\" and \\"has the potential to put lives in danger,\\" although they did not specify why they considered the reporting flawed. Other disclosures of intelligence In an April 29, 2017, phone call, Trump told Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte that the U.S. had positioned two nuclear submarines off the coast of North Korea. This was during a time when Trump was warning of a possible \\"major, major conflict\\" with North Korea. The locations of nuclear submarines are a closely guarded secret, even from the Navy command itself. \\"As a matter of national security, only the captains and crew of the submarines know for sure where they're located.\\" On May 24, 2017, Britain strongly objected to the United States leaking to the press information about the Manchester Arena bombing, including the identity of the attacker and a picture of the bomb, before it had been publicly disclosed, jeopardizing the investigation. British Prime Minister Theresa May issued a public rebuke, and British police said they would stop passing information to U.S. counterparts. In July 2017, after a private meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin at the 2017 G20 Hamburg summit, Trump took the unusual step of confiscating and keeping his interpreter's notes. This led U.S. intelligence officials to express concern that Trump \\"may have improperly discussed classified intelligence with Russia.\\" On Christmas 2018, Trump and First Lady Melania Trump flew to Al Asad Airbase where Trump posted video to Twitter of several members of Seal Team Five in their camouflage and night- vision goggles, revealing the team's location and un-blurred faces.. In 2020, the Airbase was the subject of an Iranian ballistic missile attack in retaliation for the killing of Quds Force leader Qasem Soleimani in a U.S. airstrike a few days earlier. On August 30, 2019, Trump tweeted a reportedly classified image of recent damage to Iran's Imam Khomeini Spaceport that supposedly occurred as a result of an explosion during testing of a Safir SLV. Multiple concerns were raised regarding the public release of what appeared to be a surveillance photo with exceptionally high resolution, revealing highly classified U.S. surveillance capabilities. Within hours of the tweet, amateur satellite trackers had determined the photograph came from National Reconnaissance Office spy satellite USA-224. Before Trump's tweet, the only confirmed photographs from a KH-11 satellite was leaked in 1984 by a U.S. Navy analyst who went to prison for espionage. Trump defended the tweet by saying he had \\"the absolute right\\" to release the photo. In a December 2019 interview with Bob Woodward, Trump stated, \\"I have built a nuclear ‚Äî a weapons system that nobody's ever had in this country before,\\" adding, \\"We have stuff that Putin and Xi have never heard about before. There's nobody. What we have is incredible.\\"  See also  * 2017 electronics ban * Timeline of investigations into Trump and Russia (January‚ÄìJune 2017) * Timeline of investigations into Trump and Russia (July‚ÄìDecember 2017) * Alt-right * Steve Bannon * Aleksandr Dugin * Roman Abramovich * Agent handling  References  Category:2017 controversies in the United States Category:2017 in American politics Category:Classified information in the United States Category:Counter-terrorism intelligence Category:Israel‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:May 2017 events in the United States Category:Military intelligence collection Category:Russia‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Trump administration controversies ","title":"Donald Trump's disclosures of classified information"},{"id":"54054066","text":"Vladimir Mayakovsky, \\"Rosta Window No. 583\\" ROSTA Posters (also known as ROSTA Windows, , ROSTA being an acronym for the Russian Telegraph Agency, the state news agency from 1918 to 1935) were a propagandistic medium of communication used in the Soviet Union to communicate important messages and instill specific beliefs and ideology within the minds of the masses.

Her notable works include Poems (1865), Indian Myths: Or, Legends, Traditions, and Symbols of the Aborigines of America Compared with Those of Other Countries, Including Hindostan, Egypt, Persia, Assyria, and China (1884), Masks, Heads, and Faces: With Some Considerations Respecting the Rise and Development of Art (1891), and Nature and Human Nature (1892). In 1884, she traveled to Europe, where she conducted research among the records and monuments in the libraries and museums. In Paris, she was elected a member of the Society Americaine de France, the first woman to receive that honor. She died in 1907. Early years and education Ellen Russell was born in New Sharon, Maine, January 16, 1837. Her father, Dr. Leonard White Russell, was a descendant of the Russells of Charlestown, Massachusetts. Dr. Russell had six children, the youngest of whom, Ellen, was born in the later years of his life. She early gave evidence of peculiarities of temperament, shy, dreamy and meditative, with an exceeding love for nature. Her interest in Indian lore and legend developed after a meeting with Henry Wadsworth Longfellow during her childhood. At 17, she was sent to Boston, where she entered the Mt. Vernon Seminary, in charge of Rev. Dr. Robert W. Cushman, under whose severe and stimulating guidance the student made rapid progress. There her literary work began to appear in fugitive poems and short essays. Her stay in the seminary was brought to an end by a severe attack of brain fever, caused by over study. Career In February 1862, she married Edwin R. Emerson, then in the government service in Augusta, Maine. Social duties demanded her attention, but gradually she returned to her study, and then began her interest in Indian history. A foundation was laid in systematic research for her book, Indian Myths, or Legends and Traditions of the American Aborigines, Compared with Other Countries. In all her work, she has the cordial interest and sympathy of her husband. Trips to the West, to Colorado and California, brought her in sympathy with the red race, whose history and genius she had studied so earnestly. In 1884, she sailed for Europe, where she worked among the records and monuments in the libraries and museums, using not only the note-book, but the sketch-book and brush of the painter as well. Wherever she went, the scholars of Europe recognized her ability and conscientious work, giving her unusual privileges in the pursuit of her researches and showing cordial interest in her labor. In Paris, she was elected a member of the Society Americaine de France, the first woman to receive that honor. There she completed the object of her European visit, and returned to America to prepare for the publication of her work, Masks, Heads and Faces, with Some Considerations Respecting the Rise and Development of Art. Reviews Indian Myths The Boston Advertiser reviewed Indian myths; or, legends, traditions and symbols of the aborigines of America (James R. Osgood, 1884) and stated that \\"A large and interesting collection of Indian myths has been made by Ellen Russell Emerson, with the desire of making more evident the capacity of the Indian race for moral and intellectual culture. . . . In support of these views Miss Emerson gives the results of her wide reading on all matters relating to North American Indians, and to the mythology of different countries, showing the family likeness that runs through the legends, traditions and symbols, and is even seen in the languages of the aborigines of America, and the races of the East,‚ÄîPersians, Assyrians, Hindoos, Chinese and Egyptians. These legends and myths deal with God, with the origin of man and of evil, with all the powers of nature, with forms of worship, and with birds, animals, trees and rocks. They are full of strange and interesting things, and have a great deal of wild fancy and poetic beauty mingled with their childishness. Miss Emerson deals with the capacities and prospects of the red race as a race, not with the wrongs of the separate tribes, or the injustice and inhumanity of the United States Government toward them; but her book is a claim, based on history and ethnology, not on religion or philanthropy, for the full recognition of Indians as belonging to the brotherhood of men, with rights to be respected and powers to be developed.\\" In the 1989 The Journal of American Indian Family Research, it stated that Indian myths was \\"A valuable study of Indian myths compared with other cultures of the world.\\" Masks, Heads, and Faces Masks, Heads, and Faces, With some considerations respecting the Rise and Development of Art (Houghton Mifflin, 1891) was reviewed by McClurg who stated, \\"Mrs. Emerson's book fills a somewhat unique place in literature, since it explains the earliest incentives to artistic expression. It claims to formulate the alphabet for conventionalized art. It shows the inception of the idea of portraiture, and that the construction of mules originated in emulation of the gods. Ceremonial dances are described - these are the drama of the gods, the earliest masquerade; and there is a chapter on comedy.\\" Nature and Human Nature In Nature and Human Nature (Houghton Mifflin, 1892), \\"Emerson treats the efforts that men have made to interpret the world through art. She discusses first the ideals in men's minds, then the various forms in which they have sought to embody these, ‚Äì in music, painting, sculpture, and architecture. A specially interesting interpretation is given of landscape painting and Gothic architecture, with reference to the spiritual qualities which give significance to pictures and buildings. The Dial was less complimentary in its review of Nature and Human Nature stating: A desire to cover too large a field is apparent in Mrs. Ellen Russell Emerson‚Äôs ‚ÄúNature and Human Nature‚Äù (Houghton). Literature, language, and art, including music, also come in for discussion. In her treatment of art, and symbolism in art, the author shows herself most at home, despite an occasional fanciful idea or far-fetched analogy. Her interpretation of the Laoco√∂n as suggesting, in the serpents‚Äô undulating folds, ‚Äúthe gliding stanchless waves of the sea, against whose onward movement there is no barrier,‚Äù is new to us. Were Poseidon the offended divinity in the case, this reading of the symbol would be more plausible. But the temptation to subtilize on art, as Lessing says in his ‚ÄúLaokoon,‚Äù sometimes leads one into whimsical theories. As an interpreter of nature, Mrs. Emerson is helpful. Passing to letters, she asserts that when a poet willingly becomes a translator of another's verse, he thereby stands confessed as a minor poet. Hence she refuses to recognize Longfellow and Bryant as great poets. Leaving Pope out of the account, does she forget that Goethe and Schiller and Browning also tried their hand at translating ? Or would she deny greatness to them as well? Evidently not; for she afterwards speaks of Browning in the same breath with Shakespeare, ascribing to both the ‚Äúbalance of heart and brain.‚Äù that marks the true poet. The writer's thought, it must be said in conclusion, suffers for lack of terseness and incisiveness in its presentation. We choose, almost at random, a sentence that cries out for the pruning-knife, ‚Äì ‚ÄúInterpretation of the sublimity of an uplift of rock, forest, and tableland is product of a vision dependent on the soul's sight, and sublimity is not more intrinsic to mountainous scenery than is color to a garden of flowers.‚Äù The Gallicism in the following is so harsh, and so unnecessary, as to merit censure, ‚Äì ‚ÄúScientific discovery, indeed, has laid its axe to the root of many errors, and among which the error of self- importance is not the least conspicuous.‚Äù May linguistic discovery soon lay its axe to the root of this error of speech ! A number of new or little-used words, as ‚Äúsculptuary‚Äù (i.g. sculpture), ‚Äúbolide,‚Äù ‚Äúlandscapist,‚Äù are encountered in Mrs. Emerson's pleasant pages.\\" Personal life Emerson usually spent her winters in Boston, and lived a quiet, studious life with her one daughter.

The role of verg√ºenza not only helps mold lives to a traditional mold, but serves primarily to maintain traditional gender roles, and reinforcing familial relations and expectations. Verguenza acts as both an external and internal regulator, based on what people think, and living up to those expectations, as well as on an ‚Äúinternalized set of beliefs about what constitutes proper behavior and norms.‚Äù A primary factor in verg√ºenza is the opinion and expectations of others, this comes from different communities one identifies themselves in, including family, friends, neighborhood, as well as their religious affiliations. Women and Verg√ºenza Typically, discussions surrounding verg√ºenza only focus and interpret verg√ºenza through a male perspective, but although often ignored, women are just as, and arguably even more so, affected by verg√ºenza and rigid expectations that follow them. Women are placed under unnatural man made scrutinized dilemmas placed dab in the middle of their minds from birth. To strut their hips in a manner that is opposite of carrying verg√ºenza is to disapprove and dismantle traditions built years in the making which Chicano and Chicana cultures push away. Women of all races face battles of oppressive constant slaps of the wrist for being considered a whore‚Äîputa. Forgetting to carry humility‚Äîverg√ºenza, can and has led to men hitting women and even men. Extreme cases and causes define verg√ºenza as a natural trait women need to and should carry around. For women verg√ºenza, and their general standing in their community, is almost entirely dependent on their being controlled or protected by the men in their lives, be it husbands, fathers or other patriarchal figures, as well as the man's social status rather than her own. When a woman's reputation is not dependent on their patriarch's social status, it is dependent on how well an individual can adhere to the social expectations from their family, friends, and their community. Thus, stripping women of their autonomy and pushing women to be more reserved and passive, as is expected of traditional cultural mold. Andando con verg√ºenza then becomes a priority. These images of passivity are further reinforced not only by the community around them, but also through literature and religious beliefs. =Expectations From the Community= 'Chismes', or , typically holds a negative connotation, but across transnational communities it can be seen as something positive; gossip is often used, as direct communication between families and communities is scarce, as a means to bring a community together and share information with one another. Gossip is also a negative and oppressive force within communities; it can be used to target, criticize and ostracize those who do not follow a community's standards or expectations. Gossip not only serves as a way to bring people together, but also as a reference to teach oneself how to act appropriately in a given community in order to save face from criticism‚Äîhearing how others are ostracized for differing from a community sets an example of what is not acceptable and should be avoided. Accusations of Women's Fidelity Women in transnational communities‚Äîwhether they are the ones staying behind as their husband migrates or they themselves are migrating to the United States‚Äîare also often targeted by the larger community through gossip and local criticism. When men migrate to the U.S., their wives not only have to worry about their partners potentially abandoning them, but also be careful that they are not accused of cheating while their husbands are away; some women going as far as avoiding going to social events or town festivities to avoid accusations. These accusations not only come from the woman's community out of criticism for joining social events rather than mourning the absence of their husbands, but also from the husband himself. Migrant husbands‚Äîout of paranoia and stress while they are away‚Äîcan be the root of an accusation against his wife's fidelity. This can lead to her being isolated or expelled from her community, as well as losing the remittance he sends her, which is often her only source of income. Even women in the United States will be under the watchful eye of the community around her, as well as back home, in regards to her fidelity to her husband, as their reputation also crosses borders. If a couple migrates together, separates, and forms a new relationship the man will often be unquestioned, but the woman, and her new relationship, will be targeted by her community and questioned whether her new relationship will interfere with her family obligations. Men can often, but not always, escape any criticism or gossip regarding their infidelity, because of their social status, their continued financial support to a family, or because they are men and it is expected of them to act on physical urges. More often than not, when a husband abroad is unfaithful, women are still to blame‚Äîbe it the wife for staying behind and not being there to satisfy his urges, or the other woman whom he had an affair with. The other woman are often blamed because they ‚Äúshould [have known] who they are getting involved with and not believe everything he says.‚Äù Women Targeted in the LGBT Community The LGBT community is one community in particular that is often targeted by mainstream society, as being queer acts as ‚Äúa mirror reflecting heterosexual tribe‚Äôs [primary] fear: being different‚Äù and defying the societal ‚Äúnorm.‚Äù As a result, lesbians in Latin America who fear exposing their closeted selves, learn to create and alternate between two identities: one in which they are ‚Äúout‚Äù and another within the family, and neighboring community, where they are closeted. Each identity, and its accompanying community, holds different norms, expectations, and values that Latina lesbians must navigate through. Latina lesbians in the United States, on the other hand, must create these two identities, as well as a third, as they navigate between a gay community, their familial, Latinx community, and the dominant cis, white, heterosexual community in the United States. Lesbians often feel the need to sacrifice their ‚Äúout‚Äù identity and relationships in order respect their family and maintain familial relationships. However, Latina lesbians who do come out to their families are not always accepted with open arms. The obvious, inherently traumatizing, reaction from families is alienation and rejection from the family. Another common reaction from families is initial acceptance, but altogether avoidance and silencing their daughter and her sexuality. Parents who know their daughter's sexuality tend to avoid it or ask them not to share that information with anyone outside the family, out of shame of their daughter not complying to traditional norms and expectations‚Äîi.e. finding a husband, having children, starting a family, etc. -- or fear of how the surrounding community would react to her. Families, rather than openly communicating with their daughters, will often repeat the phrase De eso no se habla, of that we do not speak, preferring to remain in denial about their daughter's sexuality and silencing her from speaking to them about it in the future. Daughters who do come out to their parents and are met with this response feel not only a denial of their identity as lesbians, but also their identity as daughter within the family. =Expectations From the Family= Women, both who migrate abroad and remain in their home country, are blamed not only for the failure of their marriage, but also questioned about their relationship with their children and family back home. Women accused of infidelity, abroad and at home, are then questioned of their commitment to their children and family, not only by their community, but by their children as well. While the community will feed into this accusation and let it fester among them, it will inevitably reach the women's children, through family members, neighbors, or even classmates, and the children will begin to resent their mother for choosing a romantic relationship over her family. Amongst social circles, it is expected of a woman to place her responsibility as a mother, and primary caretaker for her children, over her personal interests. Women are either expected to find an impossible balance between personal life and family life, or give up their personal lives altogether because motherhood is viewed traditionally as sacred. =Expectations From the Church= The traditional idea that motherhood is an inherently sacred and essential role of a woman traditionally Catholic beliefs, and the depiction of La Virgen. La Virgen has been represented as an ideal repressed passive womanhooda‚Äîsuffering, pure, and patient female, all traits traditionally expected of woman, especially when they enter motherhood. In contrast to the depiction of La Virgen, there is la Puta, , or . These women all serve to as examples of what positive and negative femininity, and motherhood, are made up of‚ÄîLa Virgen being positive and idealized and the others negative and should be avoided.The depiction and idealization of La Virgen is especially significant to Latinas through the idea of : \\"when women become mothers then, and only then, do they attain the status of Madonna\\". This not only encourages women to have children to achieve status in society, but also serves to punish those who do not fit this expectation or social mold. Depictions of religious figures, and the expectations that follow them, are not the only religious elements in Latin culture that serve to control women's conduct in society; the Catholic church is directly responsible as well. The Catholic church is patriarchal by nature, and practices this power over women through its rigid structure and sense of morality, especially in regards to women's sexuality. Women under the Catholic church do no feel free in, or with, their bodies as they have been raised with ideas regarding sex, especially premarital sex, as sinful, and received little to no sexual education through the church. This leads to woman who stray from Church expectations of purity and celibacy to feel guilt, remorse, and shame for exploring their sexual identities.

At the time, it was the longest contempt-of-court imprisonment of a journalist in United States history for protecting sources. Early life and education Leggett, the daughter of a Houston oil trader, earned her bachelor's degree in English and a master's degree in liberal arts from the University of St. Thomas (Texas). Case history In April 1997, the body of Houston, Texas, socialite Doris Angleton was discovered in her home. She died from 13 gunshot wounds to her face and chest. At the time of the death, her twin daughters and husband, Robert Angleton, a millionaire and former bookie, were at a softball game. Leggett researched the case for five years. In 1998, in a jailhouse interview of Roger Angleton, a suspect in a murder-for-hire plot. Leggett compiled notes and hours of audio tape that reportedly detailed how Roger's brother Robert hired him to murder his brother's wife Doris. The interviews occurred just before Roger's suicide in his Harris County jail cell and before Robert's trial. On June 19, 2001, U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon ordered Leggett to appear in court the next day with her notes and tapes for a book she was researching about the murder. The order was in response to a grand jury that had convened to investigate the possibility of filing federal murder charges against the victim's husband, Robert Angleton. Leggett, appearing in court on June 20, 2001, refused to turn over her notes, citing freedom of the press. She was then held in civil contempt of court and jailed by the U.S. Justice Department for refusing to turn over her notes. News organizations, publications and journalists championed Leggett's case, advocating that the public interest requires protecting journalists in Leggett's position.http://www.nyujlpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Jennifer-Elrod- Protecting-Journalists-from-Compelled-Disclosures-A-Proposal-for-a-Federal- Statue.pdf The New York Times called Leggett's incarceration \\"a brazen assault on 1st Amendment values and the public interest in a free press.\\" The Center for Individual Freedom filed an amicus brief in support of Leggett's petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear her case. The center also contributed to her legal defense fund. In addition, the Society of Professional Journalists, through its Legal Defense Fund, paid half of Leggett's legal expenses. She was released on January 4, 2002, after serving the maximum sentence, from the Houston Federal Detention Center after 168 days of incarceration on the civil contempt charge when the federal grand jury completed its term. Leggett said to reporters as she walked out of jail, \\"This is not so much about me. It's about the public's right to a free and independent press.\\" After her release, Leggett, appearing on the Charlie Rose show in April 2004, said, \\"(My sources) had taken a chance by cooperating with me and giving me information and trusting me with that information. And I felt obligated to honor that. When I realized that underlying this was an assault on the 1st Amendment, it became something much larger than just my sources or just my book. It was about protecting the free flow of information to the public.\\" Career Leggett signed a book contract in 2002 with Crown Publishing, a division of Random House, about the Angleton murder for a reported $600,000 advance. She continued her career as a freelance writer, including a Texas Monthly article about her 5-1/2 months behind bars at the Federal Detention Center in Houston. Leggett also conducted an exclusive interview with accused serial killer Robert Durst, writing \\"My Lunch with Robert Durst\\" for Esquire magazine in 2015. =Criminal justice lecturer= From 1995 to 2016, Leggett taught literature, criminology and writing courses at the University of Houston- Downtown, including at the university's Criminal Justice Training Center, where she taught Texas police recruits and lectured veteran homicide investigators. In 2002, she headlined with journalist Bob Woodward at the 23rd Annual Washington Writers Conference held at the National Press Club. At the same event, Leggett was given the Washington Independent Writers' President's Award. In addition, the Washington Independent Writers' Legal and Educational Fund presented Leggett with a $1,000 check for her stand in support of the First Amendment. She also lectured at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Swedish National Board of Forensic Medicine, and the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement. She gave the keynote address at the Institute for Ethics and Journalism's 2007 conference, which was sponsored by the Knight Foundation's Program in Journalism Ethics and Washington and Lee University's department of journalism and mass communications.

The team consisted mostly of former high school and college players and was run by local sports followers. It won the state semipro football championship in 1923 and 1924. History In December 1922, the University of Peabody lost an exhibition game to New Hampshire State University at Donovan Field in Salem, Massachusetts. The following season, the University of Peabody was undefeated. In 1923, the team did not give up any touchdowns and only one field goal. The team matched this success the following season, winning all of its games and only getting scored on once. In 1925, the team lost three of its players; Stanley Burnham left to take a teaching/coaching position at the University of Pennsylvania, Karl Young enrolled at Boston College, and John Lawrence enrolled at Georgetown University. On November 29, 1915, the \\"University\\" lost to Pere Marquette of South Boston 12 to 7 in front of a crowd of 18,000 spectators at Leo Buckley Stadium, ending the team's winning streak. In 1926, the team struggled. In order to strengthen the roster, Al Pierotti of the Boston Bulldogs was added to the team late in the season. The \\"University\\" returned to form the following season. After finishing their schedule undefeated, the team faced off against Pere Marquette in a championship game at Braves Field.

Eiler Hagerup was first married to Johanne Margrethe Smith from Stavanger in 1752. She died in 1773 and then in 1777, Hagerup married Edvardine Magdalene Margrethe Christie. He took the surname \\"Hagerup\\" due to his close ties to his relatives with whom he lived for nearly a decade. He is sometimes called Eiler Hagerup den yngre or Eiler Hagerup d.y. The \\"den yngre\\" or \\"d.y.\\" translates as \\"the younger\\", to distinguish him from his uncle, the Bishop Eiler Hagerup d.e. (with \\"d.e.\\" or \\"den eldre\\", meaning \\"the elder\\"). Education and career In 1730 (at the age of 12), he became a servant in the household of his uncle, Eiler Hagerup d.e., the bishop of the Diocese of Nidaros.

The first investment was in two existing businesses: Russell, Ritchie and Co., of Dunedin and Timaru, New Zealand, and its close associate Russell, Le Cren and Co., of London. Russell, Ritchie, Le Cren Perthshire-born George Gray Russell (1828‚Äì1919), a London ship and insurance broker, came to New Zealand in late 1864 and set up in business as a general merchant selling from premises in Dunedin's Stafford Street: brandy, fencing wire, nails and corrugated iron, oats and timber and other goods. Once established he also represented British pastoral investors, shipping lines and merchants, and shipped wool, grain and produce to Britain. In this he was assisted by John Macfarlane Ritchie (1842‚Äì1912) who as planned arrived a few months later than Russell at the beginning of 1865. Russell had contracted him in Scotland after being recommended to interview the 23 year-old Ritchie. Content to delegate the necessary authority to young Ritchie Russell regularly travelled widely from Otago up to South Canterbury and down to Southland dealing with clients and noting investment and business opportunities. He established his first branch office in Timaru in 1866. A little later he took Ritchie into partnership and In 1873 George Gray Russell & Co became Russell Ritchie & Co. In Timaru Henry Le Cren who shared Russell's London background sold his Timaru business, though he continued to manage it, the same year as Russell opened in Timaru. The two became friends. Russell, before emigrating to New Zealand had been a shipping and insurance agent in London. Together they set up (before 1873Export Merchant Shippers. The Export Merchant Shippers of London published 1873) Russell, Le Cren & Co in 37 Lombard Street, London where visiting squatters were made welcome to regard it as their London headquarters. They were within the premises of the National Bank of New Zealand and would become those of National Mortgage & Agency. The offer of shares in National Mortgage & Agency was well publicised in New Zealand and over-subscribed. Russell happened to be in London. Aware that NMA would want to invest in an existing business Russell and Ritchie hung back from direct discussion of possibilities but William Dymock in Dunedin, general manager of National Bank of New Zealand, was a useful conduit for the very slow communications between interested parties (when a delivery in as little as 74 days became occasion for delight). Negotiations were completed and NMA took over the London firm, Russell Le Cren & Co, as of 1 January 1878 and the Dunedin firm, Russell Ritchie & Co, as of 1 April 1878. Russell and Ritchie were appointed managing directors. On 1 February 1878 the column City Intelligence in The Times included this statement: \\"The National Mortgage and Agency Company of New Zealand Limited has made an arrangement with the firms of Russell, Le Cren and Co., of London and Russell, Ritchie and Co., of Dunedin and Timaru, New Zealand, for the transfer of their businesses to the company.

It was a series of non-violent protests fighting against the dangers of alcoholism.  Background  Many women in Cleveland, Ohio were inspired by a speech given by Diocletian Lewis to fight against the vices of alcoholism. Annoyed by their drunk husbands, many of the women involved wanted a way to express their opinions on alcohol. Their goals included using methods of prayer, song, and exhortation to close as many saloons possible. Ohio was the major place in the crusade with a third of the crusaders, but the crusade spread to over 900 different communities in over 31 states in the United States.  History  The main temperance reformer of the movement was Eliza Daniel Stewart, referred to as \\"Mother Stewart\\". She was a key figure in the crusade. Another figure of the crusade was Eliza Jane Thompson, who pushed the crusade by going to saloons and praying and asking the owners to pledge to stop selling alcohol. They asked saloonkeepers to get rid of all their alcohol and to enter a new business. The Women's Crusade gave women the opportunity to get involved in the public sphere. In the crusade, women used religious methods because they had the most experience in that area. The movement left a lasting impact on woman's involvement in social history and led to the creation of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Although many people were hesitant about allowing women to be involved in the Temperance Movement, women had many breakthroughs throughout the movement which led to the closure of many saloons across the United States. The movement gave women the opportunity to advocate for their rights while they fought for temperance with their growing voice in the public sphere.  The Crusade in Xenia, Ohio  In Xenia, Ohio, there were over a hundred saloons. People gathered around these saloons and started throwing all types of alcohol into the street saluting to God to give up alcohol. A major event of the crusade was when Steve Phillips, owner of the Shades of Death (a saloon), surrendered his saloon to the movement. The closure of the Shades of Death was considered the major component of the crusade in Ohio and helped shape the Temperance movement by leading to the closure of many more saloons.  The Crusade in South Charleston, Ohio  Women marched throughout the street in the cold winter checking to make sure that no sells were made in the saloons. They had routines of prayers and business meetings throughout their long days on the move. Distinct lines of marching were created on the streets to perform hymns outside of the saloons, also many of the marchers had prepared pledges for the saloonkeepers.  The Crusade in Berea, Ohio  Women organized into a women's league and they wrote their own constitution, concerning their views on alcohol. One prominent stop in their march was the saloon of Thomas Chope. They were able to get into his saloon and they conducted a prayer in the middle of his saloon. These prayers became known as \\"pray-ins\\". One challenge that the women faced was the refusal of some saloonkeepers to open their saloons to them. One case is where saloonkeeper, Martin Cummins, locked his saloon's doors, so the women were unable to enter. In cases like this, the women prayed outside the saloons to send their message about alcohol.

A Scottish force was defeated at the Battle on the Cree in August 1300. Edward I hampered by food shortages, political infighting and funds was able to reinforce his garrisons and castles in Annandale, Nithsdale and Galloway, but was only able to reach Stirling, before returning to England. Background Stirling Castle, Caerlaverock Castle and Bothwell Castle were besieged by Scottish forces in 1299 and the English garrisons were forced to surrender. Robert de Brus, Earl of Carrick attacked Lochmaben Castle in August 1299, that was under the control of the English, in his fathers the Lord of Annandale's lands in Annandale, however failed to capture it.Barrow, p. 158 The Scots garrison from the recently recaptured Caerlaverock Castle, raided and attacked the garrison at Lochmaben. The captain of the Scots garrison of Caerlaverock, Robert Cunningham, was killed during one of those raids and his head was placed on the walls of Lochmaben Castle by the Lochmaben's captain Robert Felton. Edward I began preparations for a new invasion in 1299, however due to baron differences and his impending marriage to Margaret of France, the half sister of Philip IV of France, he had to wait until 1300 to launch another invasion of Scotland. Invasion Edward I called for his army to assemble at Carlisle. In May 1300, Edward I led an English army consisting of 20,000 along the Western Marches and a campaign into Annandale, Nithsdale and Galloway to follow up on the success of 1298 and to put down resistance to English rule.Chalmers, p. 264 The army travelled from Carlisle, to Annan, then to relieve the garrison of Lochmaben Castle. The English then placed Caerlaverock Castle under siege in July 1300, which they captured after five days. After the fall of Caerlaverock Castle, the English marched to Dumfries and then to Kirkcudbright. The battle on the Cree, in August 1300, between English forces and Scottish forces led by John Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, John Comyn, Earl of Buchan and Ingram de Umfraville, was a victory for the English forces. In August, the Pope sent a letter demanding that Edward I withdraw from Scotland. Edward I marched as far as Stirling Castle. Due to the lack of success, Edward arranged a truce with the Scots on 30 October and returned to England, not being able to capture Stirling Castle. Aftermath The Scots had refused to engage in open battle, apart from a number of small skirmishes, preferring instead to raid the English countryside in smaller groups. The lack of funds and supplies, accompanied by demands by his Scottish supporters to grant them estates held by Robert de Brus, led to the campaign stuttering to a halt and the withdrawal of the English army from Scotland. Edward I began planning almost immediately for a larger campaign in 1301. Citations and references Citations References * Barrow, G.W.S: Robert Bruce.

When the town was incorporated, it found itself in the unusual situation of part of it located in Maricopa County and the other part in Pina County. Brief history The Desert Wells Stage Stop Marker.Inside the Schnepf House. The Valley below the San Tan Mountains had fertile lands. This attracted the Hohokam, a Native American tribe, who were the first to establish communities in the area. The homesteaders then arrived and began to establish farms and ranches along what was called the Queen Creek Wash.HERITAGE REFLECTS TIES TO THE LAND In 1924, Charles Rittenhouse, a land developer, established the Queen Creek Farms Company. The wells in his company pumped 2,150 gallons of water per minute, which helped make his 1,000 acres of land very productive. A railroad was soon established in the area and a small town grew around the railroad where it could ship the produce and cotton which grew in the farms. The town was called Rittenhouse because the Railroad ran near Rittenhouse and Ellsworth roads. The residents of the area, wanting to travel to Phoenix by train, would often flag down the train to get a ride. In the eastern part of Arizona there is a mountain where the Silver King Mine is located. There is a creek at the base of the mountain which was called Picket Post Creek. Eventually the creeks name was changed to Queen Creek. The creek ran from the mountain and into the area of Rittenhouse. It wasn't long before the farmers began to rely more on the use of automobiles and trucks than on the railroad. The use of the railroad declined and the people began to call and identify the area as Queen Creek.Queen Creek's Name The town's name officially was changed to Queen Creek in 1947, with the establishment of the Queen Creek Post Office. The town, which was incorporated in 1989, has the unique distinction of having part of the town located within Maricopa County and another part within Pinal County.Queen Creek Immigrants from Mexico moved into the area and picked the local cotton crop by hand until the 1920s when the cotton gin came to Queen Creek. In the 1940s the United States set up a German prisoner-of-war camp by Rittenhouse Road. The prisoners, together with immigrants from the Philippines, worked as farm laborers in local fields. In 1990, members of the community established the San Tan Historical Society. The mission of the society is to preserve the area's heritage. The society collects, preserves, documents, and displays the histories and artifacts of the Chandler Heights, Combs, Higley, and Queen Creek Communities. There are various properties in the town of Queen Creek which are considered historical and have been included either in the National Register of Historic Places or listed as such by the San Tan Historical Society.San Tan Historical Society The Town of Queen Creek, however, lacks the authority to deny a demolition permit. Therefore, the owner of a property, listed either in the National Register of Historic Places or considered historical by the San Tan Historical Society, may demolish the historical property in question if they so desire. An example of this is the historic Water Tower which was built in 1952 for the Producers Cotton Gin. The water tower was to be demolished, but in 1999, the Schnepf family purchased it and moved it to the grounds of the Schnepf Farms. According to Jim McPherson, Arizona Preservation Foundation Board President: The historic Schnepf Farms is located five miles southeast of the town. The area was purchased by Jack and Maude Schnepf in 1941. They were among the first settlers to buy a cotton picker, put in cement ditches and dig sumps to catch and recycle wastewater. Jack and Raymond Schnepf invented and manufactured the aluminum irrigation tube. As neighboring farm owners sold their properties to developers, the Schnepf Family purchased unique farm buildings from these neighboring farms and incorporated them on the Schnepf Farm to preserve the history of these farms.70 years of Farming and Fun with Schnepf Farms Properties pictured Railroad Water Tank.

He was released from Turkish custody and immediately returned to the United States. Arrest ƒ∞zmir Resurrection Church Andrew Brunson is originally from Black Mountain, North Carolina. He is married and has three children. Brunson lived in Turkey for 23 years where he served as pastor of the Izmir Resurrection Church. Brunson, who was applying for Turkish permanent residency, was imprisoned on October 7, 2016 as part of the purges that followed the failed 2016 coup attempt. His wife, Norine, was initially arrested alongside him, but was released after 13 days. For a time Brunson was held with 21 others in a cell that was made for eight prisoners. He reportedly lost over while he was in prison. He was moved to house arrest on July 25, 2018. Indictment The Turkish government primarily claimed that Brunson was a member of the G√ºlen movement, but also claimed that he worked with the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), and claimed that he was involved with American espionage, among other things. In addition, they claimed that he was interested in overthrowing the Turkish government and that he supposedly helped plan the coup, which he denied. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu claimed that the case was triggered by a complaint from a translator. The Turkish government claimed that they didn't know about the case until the consulate addressed it. The trial caused a major public diplomatic row between the United States and Turkey. The United States stood firm in its argument that the trial was unacceptable because the government ‚Äúhas not seen credible evidence Mr. Brunson is guilty of a crime and are convinced that he is innocent.‚Äú, as the State Department said in a statement. The Trump administration insisted that the Turkish government free Brunson entirely. Turkey objected to this on the basis of this being an interference with the country's sovereignty. Erdogan objected to the idea of interfering with the courts, arguing that he shouldn't on the basis that they are independent. =Hearings= In May 2018, a hearing for his case occurred in Aliaga that lasted eleven hours. The judge dismissed all of Brunson's defence witnesses without listening to any of their testimony. The prosecution used secret witnesses who ‚Äútestified through video monitors that distorted their faces and voices in order to conceal their identities‚Äù. Sandra Jolley, Vice Chair of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom attended the case, and released the following statement: \\"We leave the courthouse with serious concerns. Today's eleven hours of proceedings were dominated by wild conspiracies, tortured logic, and secret witnesses, but no real evidence to speak of. Upon these rests a man's life\\" She described the judge's decision not to allow any of the witnesses called by Brunson's defense to testify on his behalf as \\"simply unconscionable\\". The judge would relent in a later hearing. Hearings were held on July 13, 2018. At his final hearing on October 12, 2018, several prosecution witnesses retracted their earlier statements which led to his release that same day. Trial Brunson was held for over a year without charges. Turkish prosecutors charged Brunson with involvement in the failed July 2016 coup attempt. Turkish media reported that Brunson had been accused of espionage and attempting to overthrow the government. He was originally charged with having links to FET√ñ and PKK (both are considered terrorist organizations by the Turkish state). The New York Times reported that two secret witnesses accused Brunson of \\"hosting Kurdish refugees in a guesthouse and holding services and gatherings sympathetic to the PKK\\". Brunson denied helping the coup, and denied he had intentionally had contact with either group blamed for the coup. He was one of 20 American citizens who were prosecuted in connection with the post-coup purges. =Fethullah G√ºlen network (\\"FET√ñ\\")-related= Court documents said that a photo of maqluba, a popular Levantine rice dish, was found on Brunson's phone. The court documents described maqluba as a \\"Gulenist delicacy\\". The Asheville Citizen-Times says that it mentions that Brunson's daughter, who was raised in Turkey, had sent the offending video of the maqluba to his iPhone, which was found by the Turkish government. The Turkish government alleges that it is eaten in G√ºlenist safe houses. According to Slate, \\"The case against Brunson is reportedly based on the testimony of an undisclosed witness, though reports vary as to what exactly the witness alleges. In one version, Brunson attended a G√ºlenist event. In another, he spoke positively once about relations between Christians and the movement.\\" Brunson was charged with \\"membership in an armed terrorist organization,\\" \\"gathering state secrets for espionage, attempting to overthrow the Turkish parliament and government, and to change the constitutional order.\\" Brunson contacted the chair of Amnesty International in Turkey, Taner Kilic, to ask about his residency permit 9 times. Kilic would later be indicted as a member of the alleged G√ºlenist organization on the grounds that he allegedly had a particular secure messaging app on his phone, which he denies, and opening a bank account. Because of this, Brunson's prior contact with the lawyer was deemed retroactively terroristic in nature. A secret witness claimed to have overheard a supposed ‚ÄúIsraeli missionary‚Äù say that Brunson attended an alleged March 2013 event at an Istanbul convention centre where the attendees supposedly plotted the Gezi Park protests. It was claimed that Brunson possessed a list containing information for \\"'gas station workers in Turkey's southeast,' 'railway employees,' or 'soldiers to get in contact with'\\" in relation to this supposed planning. Another secret witness involved claimed that they could not understand what the information meant, possibly that certain locations were supposedly meant to be \\"logistics centers\\". =PKK-related= The prosecution claimed that Brunson was a collaborator with armed Kurdish groups, that he went to YPG territory in Syria (specifically Kobani and Turkey's Suru√ß district), and that he wanted to Christianize Kurdistan and have it be a Christian state. Brunson claimed that he evangelized Syrian refugees without regard to their ethnic identity, and strongly denied the idea that he had any connection with PKK members. The prosecution claimed that there was GPS data that placed him near the Syrian border. According to a July 2018 article in World by Aykan Erdemir and Merve Tahiroglu, there was a photograph that features both Brunson and a man wearing a yellow, red, and green scarf, which is presented as proof of his involvement with Kurdish nationalist terrorism. It is claimed by the prosecution that Brunson published Kurdish Bibles. It is also claimed that he was part of an operation to help Kurdish families write asylum letters to Canada that strongly criticized the AKP and MHP. =US-related= The prosecution claimed that Brunson helped the CIA with the attempted coup. In relation to claims about Christianity, the indictment also made the claim that there was a so- called \\"Mormon Gang\\" within American intelligence. It was alleged by one of the witnesses that Brunson's church was supposedly a waypoint for co-ordinates between the CIA and YPG due to alleged support for the PKK. Brunson was accused of attending an event in a Turkish hotel where the American anthem was allegedly playing and several Turkish college students put their right hand on their heart and made vows, which the prosecution further alleges was some kind of ‚Äúbrainwashing‚Äù of these alleged students. =Christianity-related= The indictment also made many other broad claims about Christianity and the United States government that the Asheville Citizen-Times described as conspiracy theories. According to the Asheville Citizen-Times, the indictment contained a \\"lengthy discourse on the alleged influence of Mormons in Turkey\\" (Brunson is not Mormon). According to World, the secret witness was specifically concerned with English teachers at the nation's ‚Äúmilitary high schools‚Äù. The secret witness also made claims about them missing fingers. Brunson is not Mormon, but is alleged to have LDS contacts, which they further allege is suspicious. According to the Asheville Citizen-Times, it also contained an accusation that every church in the United States is connected to some organization with the acronym \\"CAMA\\", that \\"holds sway over\\" every one of them. The indictment also made the claim that every evangelical missionary and Mormon missionary who wants to leave the United States must have permission from this organization, indicating that they allege that it influences both. (However, Protestants and Mormons have many theological disagreements.) This group is unfamiliar to Christian officials within the ACLJ, who view it as an \\"unfounded\\" theory. It was also alleged by the prosecution that there are websites on the internet that describe Turkish president Erdogan as the Antichrist, and the indictment almost suggests it as a motive for Brunson, a Christian, to help the coup plotters. The Citizen-Times argued that theory is most likely overshadowed by theories regarding more popular leaders, wildly obscure, and not likely to be widely believed in. =Further claims by Turkish media= A December 14, 2016, a Sabah daily news story, said to be based on an informant, claimed that Brunson, while dispensing aid among Syrian refugees, tried to divide Turkey with sermons praising G√ºlenism and by speaking in support of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The pro-Erdogan administration newspaper Takvim alleges that Brunson was a \\"high-level member of the G√ºlen movement\\" and an American spy, positioned to become CIA chief in Turkey had the 2016 coup attempt succeeded. Takvims editor-in-chief, Ergun Diler, alleged that Brunson fended off an assassination attempt thanks to his intelligence agency training, further claiming that Brunson was influential all over the region. Diler speculated that the CIA would assassinate Brunson in prison if it thought he would not be deported back to the U.S. Reactions In April 2018, a bipartisan group of US senators led by North Carolina senator Thom Tillis sent a letter to Erdoƒüan stating they were \\"deeply disturbed that the Turkish government has gone beyond legitimate action against the coup plotters to undermine Turkey's own rule of law and democratic traditions.\\" Brunson has said, \\"I am not a member of an Islamic movement. I have never seen any member of FET√ñ [the G√ºlen movement] in my life.\\" In a March 2017 letter to U.S. President Donald Trump through an attorney with the American Center for Law and Justice, Brunson said, \\"Let the Turkish government know that you will not cooperate with them in any way until they release me.\\" According to a February 2017 letter to the president of Turkey signed by 78 members of the U.S. Congress, \\"There appears to be no evidence to substantiate the charges against him for membership in an armed terrorist organization.\\" A petition for the release of Brunson was launched on the White House's \\"WE the PEOPLE\\" citizen petitions website in February 2017, but was later closed without garnering enough signatures. The American Center for Law and Justice launched similar petitions on its main website and the website of its Be Heard Project. The Evangelical Presbyterian Church of America called for a prayer and fasting October 7-8, 2017 for Brunson's release. In October 2017, Ihsan Ozbek, chairman of the Association of Protestant Churches in Turkey, told The New York Times, \\"Andrew was a normal American Christian; he is not a spy. I know him[...].\\" =International relations= Trump and Turkish President Erdoƒüan give a joint statement at the White House in May 2017 Trump brought this issue up with Erdogan at a meeting on May 13, 2017.Arnold, Laurence, \\"This Pastor‚Äôs Plight Made Turkey‚Äôs Economic Woes Worse\\", Bloomberg.com, August 21, 2018. On September 28, 2017, Erdoƒüan said the United States should exchange Pennsylvania-based Islamic preacher Fethullah G√ºlen with Pastor Andrew Brunson, saying \\"You have a pastor too. Give him to us.... Then we will try [Brunson] and give him to you.\\"https://nytimes.com: Turkey Rebuffs Trump, Won't Send Jailed US Pastor Back The Federal judiciary alone determines extradition cases in the U.S. An August 2017 decree gave Erdogan authority to approve the exchange of detained or convicted foreigners with people held in other countries. Asked about the suggested swap on September 28, 2017, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said: \\"I can't imagine that we would go down that road.... We have received extradition requests for [G√ºlen].\\" Anonymous US officials have said to reporters that the Turkish government has not yet provided sufficient evidence for the U.S. Justice Department to charge G√ºlen. On October 11, 2017, departing U.S. Ambassador to Turkey John R. Bass said Brunson \\"appears to be being held simply because he's an American citizen who as a man of faith was in contact with a range of people in this country who he was trying to help, in keeping with his faith. And at a time when there were lots of interactions between many different people in society, and for some reason, some specific set of his interactions suddenly are being classified as support for terrorism, for membership in a terrorist organization. I have yet to see a consistent description of which specific terrorist organization he is supposed to be a member of. People don't seem to have had a straight answer on that within the Turkish government. So for all those reasons, we believe he should be released. And U.S. government officials have continued to encourage the Turkish government to release him.\\" In June 2018, a bipartisan bill changing the NDAA to block the transfer of F-35 fighter jets to Turkey was authored by senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and was passed through Congress.Trevithick, Joseph, \\"Senate Voted To Block Turkey From Getting Its F-35s As Spat Over Russian Missiles Grows\\", thedrive.com/the-war-zone, June 19, 2018. Retrieved 2019-04-25. Alongside a third senator, Senator James Lankford (R-OK), special legislation was created with the intent of preventing Turkey from \\"working to degrade NATO interoperability, exposing NATO assets to hostile actors, degrading the security of NATO member countries, seeking to import weapons from a foreign country under sanction by the U.S., and wrongfully or unlawfully detaining any American citizens.\\" The senators expressed concerns about Turkey's growing ties to Russia and their concerns about the Brunson case. On July 5, 2018, in anticipation of Pastor Brunson's third day of trial, 98 Members of the European Parliament, from all political groups and 21 countries, sent an open letter to remind President Erdoƒüan of \\"the European and International commitments of the Republic of Turkey in regard to freedom of religion, to the prohibition of arbitrary detention, and to the right to a fair trial.\\" They especially protest \\"against the fact that Pastor Brunson had to wait almost a year and half before being indicted\\" and against \\"the fact that the indictment associates 'Christianization' with terrorism, considering the Christian faith as endangering Turkey's unity, while Christianity has been peacefully present in this land long before the current Republic of Turkey.\\"Malo Tresca, ¬´ Pr√®s de cent d√©put√©s europ√©ens exigent la lib√©ration d‚Äôun pasteur am√©ricain emprisonn√© en Turquie ¬ª, La Croix, July 12, 2018. On July 18, 2018, President Trump tweeted President Erdogan calling for Brunson's release. Trump called the Turkish government's refusal to release Brunson a \\"total disgrace,\\" described him as being \\"held hostage\\" and defended Brunson against the government's accusations. On July 26, 2018, US Vice President Pence called on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan to release Brunson or face significant sanctions. On the same day, President Trump released a tweet, stating that the United States would impose sanctions on Turkey due to Brunson's detention. According to the Independent, Turkey moving Brunson to house arrest on July 25 was seen as ‚Äútoo little, too late‚Äù by American authorities and a phone call between the two countries on the 26th was described as ‚Äúnot going well‚Äù. It associates the July 25 swap with the release of a Turkish citizen by Israel on the 15th, as it is claimed that there was an offer for a swap between the two. On August 1, 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on two top Turkish government officials who were involved in the detention of Brunson, Turkish Justice Minister Abdulhamit G√ºl and Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu. Daniel Glaser, the former Treasury official under President Barack Obama, said: \\"It's certainly the first time I can think of\\" the U.S. sanctioning a NATO ally. \\"I certainly regard it as a human rights violation to unlawfully detain somebody, so I think it falls within the scope of the Global Magnitsky Act.\\" On August 9, 2018, Trump raised tariffs on Turkish aluminum and steel to 20 and 50 percent, respectively. Erdogan reacted on August 14 by placing tariffs of 120 and 140 percent on US cars and alcohol. Commentators such as Vox's Jen Kirby have pointed to the pivotal role Brunson's case plays in it. Turkish President Erdogan described American actions in the case as choosing a pastor above the strategic relationship between Ankara and Washington, and that Washington has \\"turned their back on\\" Ankara, stating that it \\"annoyed\\" and \\"upset\\" them. According to the Washington Post, there was supposedly a deal to free Brunson if the US would ask Israel to free a Turkish citizen accused of being part of Hamas, which fell through. According to a White House official, \\"Turkey missed a real opportunity. Pastor Brunson is not a bargaining chip.\\" Senior Turkish officials deny the existence of such a deal. A report from The Economist said diplomatic talks involving Brunson on one side and Halkbank's Atilla on the other came close to success but then broke down over Turkish interest in stopping further Halkbank investigations. Brunson was moved to house arrest in Turkey from prison there following these negotiations.\\"Turkey‚Äôs diplomatic crisis is hastening an economic one\\", The Economist, August 9, 2018.

Restaurant  The restaurant bills itself as serving \\"farm-to-table southern style cuisine\\", and it sources its produce from the local Weatherford Farmer's Market.  History  Vintage Grill & Car Museum founder Tom Moncrief, an oilman from Fort Worth, was inspired to create a combination car museum and restaurant after visiting one in Sydney, Australia, while on his honeymoon in 1988. After originally planning to open a 1950s-themed museum in Fort Worth, Moncrief took a suggestion to open it instead in an old service station, purchasing one in Weatherford for the purpose. The buildings that comprise the current museum were built around 1919; by 1921, when the Bankhead Highway arrived in Weatherford, The lot included a 50-car garage, an auto sales and office building, gas pumps, and a repair shop. Before being repurposed as a car museum and restaurant, the property's former gas station also served as Weatherford's Greyhound bus station. The establishment opened to the public in early 2015.  Vintage Car Museum and Event Center  Interior of the Vintage Car Museum & Event Center On August 4, 2016, the companion Vintage Car Museum and Event Center opened one block west of Vintage Grill & Car Museum, at 100 Fort Worth Highway.

It forms part of the Germersheim‚ÄìBruchsal railway.  Bridge of 1877  In 1871, the Grand Duchy of Baden, which was located on the right (eastern) bank of the Rhine, and the Kingdom of Bavaria, which governed the Palatinate on the left (western) bank, agreed to build a railway line from Bruchsal to Germersheim, including a bridge over the Rhine. After lengthy discussions in 1874, it was decided to build the Rhine crossing north of the Germersheim fortress. Construction began in 1875 and the bridge was formally opened on 15 May 1877. The bridge was 302 m long and consisted of three steel arch spans with the rail tracks lying below. The superstructures had a width of 7.6 m, each span had a length of 87.6 m and they carried two tracks. The bridge was strengthened from 1927 to 1930 in response to increased traffic loads. German troops destroyed the bridge by blowing up of a pier and an abutment on 24 March 1945 at 10.20 am.  Bridge of 1967  Since Deutsche Bundesbahn did not consider the Rhine Bridge necessary for operational reasons, it was not rebuilt immediately after the Second World War. It was not until 1965 that Deutsche Bundesbahn began the construction of a new Rhine crossing and it was opened on 23 October 1967. Funding was provided by the Federal Defence Ministry in response to the strategic interests of NATO. A three-span, pillar-free steel truss bridge with a through beam in the longitudinal direction was built by a joint venture of MAN Werk Gustavsburg and the Aug. Kl√∂nne company. The 268 m-long construction has 66 m-long outer spans and a central span of 136 m. The truss structure with parallel beams and an underlying deck has a distance between girders of 11 m in the side spans and 10.46 m in the main span across the ship channel. The height of the truss system is 10.0 m, the total height is 11.5 m and the distance between the main girders is 9.5 m. The diagonals and upper struts of the truss holders have 0.7 m wide box cross sections, with heights between 0.6 m and 0.76 m. The wooden sleepers are mounted directly on two continuous longitudinal beams. On the western bank, the truss bridge is attached to a 22 m-long approach bridge of prestressed concrete on a separating pillar. 2016 Due to the curved tracks that follow the bridge, the tracks on the bridge are 15 cm off-centre. With the lessening of military tensions the strategic interest in the bridge declined after 1989 and the southern track was closed in 1994. it was electrified together with the Graben-Neudorf‚ÄìGermersheim section of the Bruhrain Railway as part of the extension of the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn at the end of 2011.

Ewing hailed from New York. After the American Civil War, she served as dean, Chautauqua Assembly Cooking School; professor domestic economy, Iowa Agricultural College; director Model School of Household Economics; and affiliated with Marietta College, Ohio, Model Home School of Household Economics. Her contemporaries included, Mary Johnson Bailey Lincoln, Marion Harland, Fannie Merritt Farmer, Sarah Tyson Rorer, Maria Parloa, Gesine Lemcke, Ella Morris Kretschmar, and Linda Hull Larned. Ewing was the author of several cookbooks such as Cooking and Castle-building (1880), Soup and Soup Making (1882), Bread and Bread Making (1883), Salad and Salad Making (1884), A Text-book of Cookery, for Use in Schools (1899), Cookery Manuals (1890), and The Art of Cookery: A Manual for Homes and Schools (1896). Early years and education Emma Pike was born on a farm in Broome County, New York, in July 1838, (July 1828 is also mentioned). Career Emma P. Ewing When she made her first home after marriage, she was an inexperienced young housewife. She knew nothing of cookery, but she saw the necessity of learning. There were no cooking schools and few cookbooks, but broad intelligence soon made Ewing a notable housewife, one who was constantly called upon for aid by neighbors who knew less than she did. In 1866, she became impressed with the belief that good food is an important factor in the development of the individual, morally, mentally and physically, and since then, the leading aim of her life was to improve people's diet by the introduction of better and more economical methods of cooking. Most of her culinary studies and experiments were in that direction. Cooking and Castle- building As she solved one problem after another she put it into manuscript form. In 1880, James R. Osgood & Co of Boston brought out a small volume entitled Cooking and Castle Building. This book, written by Ewing, was in the form of a story, and discussed the vital importance of better homes and of improved methods of preparing food. Reviewers said of it that it was ‚Äúwell calculated to popularize cookery in its scientific aspects.‚Äù That cookery had scientific aspects was a new idea to most people, as it was then generally supposed that women possessed by nature an intuitive knowledge of how to keep house, and that cooks were ‚Äúborn cooks.‚Äù In 1880, Ewing organized a school of cookery in Chicago and had conducted it for three years when she was appointed professor of domestic economy in the Iowa Agricultural College. She held that position until 1887, then resigned it to accept a similar one at a largely- increased salary at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. In the fall of 1889, Ewing resigned her professorship at Purdue and went to Kansas City, Missouri, to organize and take charge of a school of household science. Before she had been in Kansas City a year, Ewing received calls from across the country for lectures and lessons on culinary topics that became so incessant and urgent that she decided to leave the school, placing someone else in her position. In 1881, a cooking school was opened in Chicago under the auspices of sixty prominent women of that city. Ewing was superintendent of this school, and during the first year gave courses of lectures upon the scientific principles underlying the proper preparation and cooking of food in five of the most prominent schools for young women in the city. These lectures were the subject of much newspaper comment, and in this way, Ewing became known as a teacher of cookery. Soup and Soup Making Soup and Soup Making was published in 1882. In that year, the trustees of the Iowa agricultural college invited Ewing to take charge of the department left vacant by the resignation of Mrs Welch. She accepted the invitation, in consequence of which the Chicago school was abandoned, because no woman capable of carrying it on satisfactorily could be found to take her place. Salad and Salad Making Vegetables and Vegetable Cooking In 1883, she published a simple manual about bread-making. In the same year, the department of the Iowa college was enlarged, renamed the ‚ÄúSchool of Domestic Economy,‚Äù and placed upon a level with the other schools comprising the college. At the same time it was ordered by the trustees that Ewing should be given the title of Professor of Domestic Economy. In the same year, at the solicitation of Bishop John H. Vincent, Ewing opened a summer cooking school at Chautauqua, New York, which she conducted as its dean every July and August, until 1900; every season she delivered a series of lectures there on household topics. Salad and Salad Making and Vegetables and Vegetable Cooking were published in 1884. In 1887, Ewing was connected with the Iowa State Agricultural College at Ames. In that year, the trustees of Purdue university, Indiana, after a careful investigation of the school of domestic economy in the Iowa college, decided to open a similar department in their university. They offered Ewing an increased compensation to take charge of this school. She accepted the offer and conducted it until 1891, when she resigned for the purpose of entering a field of labor in which she could work upon a broader scope and methods. Cookery Manuals Cookery Manuals was published in 1890. During 1891, she gave nearly 250 lectures and lessons on the preparation of food. In the following year, an association was formed in Chicago, called the National Household Economic Association. In 1893, this organization was enlarged. Under its auspices, Ewing gave free lessons in bread-making in the ‚Äúmodel kitchen\\" of the women's building at the World's Fair. The Art of Cookery: A Manual for Homes A Text-book of Cookery: For Use in Schools The Art of Cookery: A Manual for Homes was published in 1896, and A Text-book of Cookery: For Use in Schools in the following year. In 1898, Ewing founded the Model Home School of Household Economics, which was affiliated Marietta College of Ohio. The normal course extended over two years. Associated with Ewing were, Helen M. Rathbun, manager of the model home: Maud E. Pike, principal of practical instruction; and Elizabeth M. Oakley, superintendent of practice kitchen. The new venture prospered, and the result was a similar institute in Syracuse, New York, over which Ewing presided. Personal life Emma Pike was born in July, 1828 in Colesville, Broome County, New York. She married her first husband, Frederick Southgate Smith, on October 29, 1856 in Washington, D.C. He was son of Henry and Arixene (Southgate) Smith, grandson of Rev. John Smith and Dr. Robert Southgate and was born in Portland, Maine January 26, 1817. Frederick Southgate Smith was a Civil Engineer who held office in the Patent Office at Washington D.C., where he and Emma lived. Emma (Pike) Smith and Frederick Southgate Smith had only one child, Frederick Pike Smith, born on October 6, 1857 in Colesville, Broome Co. N.Y. and the three of them lived in Washington D.C. until Frederick Sr. resigned due to ill-health. He died of consumption at his wife's family's Colesville N.Y. home on October 17, 1861 and his brother Henry Boynton Smith wrote his mother: \\"He was buried on Sunday afternoon, the service at two o'clock, a bright, cool, October Sunday, the woods bright with the falling leaves. He lies in a little wood- sheltered nook of the (Pike family) farm on the border of the wood - a beautiful spot. The bearers carried him there relieving each other on the way. At the grave they sang a resurrection hymn.\\" He was a college-room companion of his brother Henry Boynton Smith at Bowdoin College. After her first husband died Emma changed her son's last name from Smith to Southgate which was her husband's mother's maiden name and in 1891 Frederick Jr. married Mary Louisa McKinsey in Elkton, MD. Mary was born September 5, 1858 in Missouri, daughter of Mr. James McKinsey of Philadelphia. Emma's Granddaughter Katheryn Southgate was born in December 1893 in Memphis, Tennessee. In September, 1863 Emma (Pike) Smith married her second husband, lawyer/poet William Pinkney Ewing of Rowlandsville, Cecil County, MD. A sketch about him in 1887's The Poets and Poetry of Cecil County Maryland reads: \\"In September, 1863 he married Mrs. Emma P. Smith, a lady of fine literary taste and ability who is at this time the head of the cooking school of the State Agricultural College of Iowa.\\" Since her marriage, Ewing lived in Washington, D. C., New York City, Chicago, Illinois, and other cities. The Emma P. Ewing papers for the period of 1888-1892 are held by the Purdue University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections. Ewing's contemporaries included, Mary Johnson Bailey Lincoln, Marion Harland, Fannie Merritt Farmer, Sarah Tyson Rorer, Maria Parloa, Gesine Lemcke, Ella Morris Kretschmar, and Linda Hull Larned. Ewing died in February 1917, and is buried in Rosemary Cemetery, Sarasota, Florida.

It was published in 1996 by HarperCollins in Canada and the United States. The novel won the McNally Robinson Book of the Year Award in 1996.  Plot  Johnny Fehr is a Mennonite Christian working as a salesman and living in a Canadian small town called Lesser, close to Winnipeg, Manitoba. At the start of the story his father commits suicide. The town of Lesser is a small community and hence every personal thing sooner or later becomes public. Johnny has his own problems like being an alcoholic and also being addicted to drugs. He falls in love with Lorraine and that brings excitement to his life. But he is already married to Charlene and also has kids with her. The scandal breaks open into the society and with turn of events Johnny loses his family of wife and children, his lover and also his few close friends. Coming from orthodox thoughts, people start treating him like a sinner but Johnny wishes to still live with grace and dignity.  Publication and development  A Year of Lesser is the first novel by Bergen. He grew up in the small Canadian province of Manitoba town of Niverville, Manitoba. As the lead character of the novel also belongs to Manitoba, The Toronto Star noted that Bergen's Mennonite upbringing has influenced his writing for the novel. The novel was published in 1996 by HarperCollins in Canada and the United States.  Reviews and reception  The novel won the McNally Robinson Book of the Year Award in 1996. Bergen again won the award in 2005 for The Time in Between and in 2009 for The Retreat. The graphic design of the book cover by designing firm Concrete Design Communications Inc., art director John Pylypczak and designer Daniel Andreani won the Merit Award by The Advertising & Design Club of Canada in 1996. The cover used a photography by William Eggleston. Kirkus Reviews appreciates the novel as \\"moving, credible, and subtle\\" but criticizes for being \\"long and shapeless overall\\". American novelist Claire Messud in her New York Times review mentions that through novel \\"David Bergen explores what happens when the simplest of contemporary souls asks the biggest questions, and the novel, as rigorously unpretentious as its hero, attests to the ambiguities of the undertaking\\".

The IFA had their main office in Bloomington, IN until the summer of 2016, when they moved their office to Indianapolis, IN. Initiatives In 2017-2018, the IFA has focused on a variety of initiatives including: the protection of the Yellowwood Backcountry Area (BCA) in Brown County, IN, the Wild Indiana Campaign promoting the designation of wild areas within Indiana state forests throughout the state, and surveying and inventorying the flora and fauna of Indiana forests. Awards On December 2, 2017 IFA was awarded the Organization of the Year from the Hoosier Environmental Council. Criticism Some criticize the IFA's efforts, arguing that logging and removing trees is necessary for forest health. Revenue from timber sales are also pointed to as a solution the Indiana Division of Forestry's declining budget and could potentially allow the Division of Forestry to increase the amount of forests through purchasing adjacent private lands. The Division of Forestry also points out that the state forests in Indiana exist partly to serve as a source of commodities for the state. Moreover, the Division of Forestry is required by Indiana state law to log timber in state forests that has worthy commercial value.

Organized in September 1914 and named after Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna, daughter of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, the committee provided aid (food, clothing, shelter, etc.) to refugees and others affected by the war, organized schools and hospitals, provided grants to other charitable organizations. It was the central refugee relief organizations in Russia until the establishment of the Special Council of Refugees () on 30 August 1915. The Tatiana Committee was reorganized after the February Revolution in 1917 ‚Äì it dropped Tatiana's name, announced elections to key posts, allowed refugees to represent themselves. The reorganized committee was known as the All-Russian Committee to Assist Victims of War (). Deprived of its semi-official government status and state funding, the committee diminished significantly. Establishment and funding Established on 14 September 1914 by an imperial decree, the committee took its name from Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna, the 17-year-old daughter of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia. The committee included 28 dignitaries from the Imperial Court and the State Council. It was chaired by state councilor . Tatiana Nikolaevna was not just a patron of the committee, but also a participant ‚Äì she attended meetings and dealt with paperwork. The committee was initially funded by 900,000 rubles from Emperor's personal funds. It received further funding from the state ‚Äì about 14 million rubles between July 1915 and 1 May 1917. It also raised money from donations, charity balls, raffles, auctions, and other fundraising initiatives such as selling postcards with Tatiana's image. For example, during the celebrations of Tatiana's birthday on 29‚Äì31 May 1915, the committee raised 2.2 million rubles. The committee's employees took no salary. Activities Initially, the committee focused on helping war widows and soldiers' children, but it switched to assisting war refugees by the summer of 1915, providing them with food, clothes, and shelter. Newly arriving refugees were met at railway stations, registered, given food stamps and temporary shelter for 5‚Äì10 days, and then dispersed in provincial towns and villages. Other activities included reuniting separated families, establishing orphanages, schools, and hospitals, providing aid to non-refugees who had nevertheless suffered from the war, and providing grants to other local war- aid organizations. For example, the committee provided a 400,000-ruble grant to the (later reorganized into the Central Welfare Council) and a 9,500-ruble monthly grant to the Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers. The Tatiana Committee established numerous local branches: 66 at the provincial level and 220 at the uyezd and volost level by October 1915. While the committee faced criticism that it was an establishment of the imperial regime, it undertook some novel initiatives to help the refugees. At the end of 1916, the committee distributed a detailed questionnaire soliciting feedback from the refugees. In spring 1917, it organized an exhibition of refugee handicraft in Petrograd to showcase that they were hardworking people, demonstrate and appreciate cultural differences, and tell stories of refugee plight. The committee also helped refugees fleeing the Armenian, Greek, and Assyrian Genocides in the Ottoman Empire. In its mission the committee competed with the All-Russian Union of Towns (VSG; ) and the All-Russian Zemstvo Union (VZS). While they shared the same humanitarian goals, there were political tensions between the organizations, particularly when it came to registering refugees and gathering national statistics. The VSG and VZS, based on local self-government institutions of city dumas and zemstvos, were well suited for this task, but the central government did not trust them and delegated the task to the Tatiana Committee. By spring 1916, it counted more than 3.3 million refugees.

Consider a vessel maintained at a constant temperature T_o, containing a homogeneous reacting mixture. Let the characteristic size of the vessel be a. Since the mixture is homogeneous, the density \\\\rho is constant. During the initial period of ignition, the consumption of reactant concentration is negligible (see t_f and t_e below), thus the explosion is governed only by the energy equation. Assuming a one-step global reaction \\\\text{fuel} + \\\\text{oxidizer} \\\\rightarrow \\\\text{products} + q, where q is the amount of heat released per unit mass of fuel consumed, and reaction rate governed by Arrhenius law, the energy equation becomes :\\\\rho c_v \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\lambda abla^2 T + q \\\\rho B Y_{Fo} e^{-E/(RT)} where *T is the temperature of the mixture *c_v is the specific heat at constant volume *\\\\lambda is the thermal conductivity *B is the pre-exponential factor with dimension of one over time *Y_{Fo} is the initial fuel mass fraction *E is the activation energy *R is the universal gas constant =Non- dimensionalization= The non-dimensional activation energy \\\\beta and the heat-release parameter \\\\gamma are :\\\\beta=\\\\frac{E}{RT_o}, \\\\quad \\\\gamma = \\\\frac{q Y_{Fo}}{c_v T_o} The characteristic heat conduction time across the vessel is t_c = \\\\rho c_va^2/ \\\\lambda , the characteristic fuel consumption time is t_f= \\\\left(B e^{-\\\\beta}\\\\right)^{-1} and the characteristic explosion/ignition time is t_e = \\\\left(\\\\beta\\\\gamma B e^{-\\\\beta}\\\\right)^{-1}. Note should be made that in combustion process, typically \\\\gamma\\\\approx 6{-}8,\\\\ \\\\beta\\\\approx 30{-}100 so that \\\\beta\\\\gamma\\\\gg 1. Therefore, t_f = \\\\beta\\\\gamma t_e \\\\gg 1, i.e., the fuel is consumed at much longer times when compared with ignition time, the fuel consumption is essentially negligible to study ignition/explosion. That is the reason the fuel concentration is assumed to same as the initial fuel concentration Y_{Fo}. The non-dimensional scales are :\\\\tau = \\\\frac{t}{t_e}, \\\\quad \\\\theta = \\\\frac{\\\\beta(T-T_o)}{T_o}, \\\\quad \\\\eta^j = \\\\frac{r^j} a, \\\\quad \\\\delta = \\\\frac{t_c}{t_e} where \\\\delta is the Damk√∂hler number and r is the spatial coordinate with origin at the center, j=0 for planar slab, j=1 for cylindrical vessel and j=2 for spherical vessel. With this scale, the equation becomes :\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\theta}{\\\\partial \\\\tau} = \\\\frac 1 {\\\\delta}\\\\frac 1 {\\\\eta^j} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\eta} \\\\left(\\\\eta^j \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial \\\\eta}\\\\right) + e^{\\\\theta/(1+\\\\theta/\\\\beta)} Since \\\\beta\\\\gg 1, the exponential term can be linearized e^{\\\\theta/(1+\\\\theta/\\\\beta)}\\\\approx e^\\\\theta, hence :\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\theta}{\\\\partial \\\\tau} = \\\\frac 1 \\\\delta \\\\frac 1 {\\\\eta^j} \\\\frac \\\\partial {\\\\partial \\\\eta} \\\\left(\\\\eta^j \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial \\\\eta}\\\\right) + e^\\\\theta Semenov theory Before Frank-Kamenetskii, his doctoral advisor Nikolay Semyonov (or Semenov) proposed a thermal explosion theory with a simple model i.e., he assumed a linear function for heat conduction process instead of Laplacian operator. Semenov's equation reads as :\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\theta}{\\\\partial \\\\tau} = e^\\\\theta - \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{\\\\delta}, \\\\quad \\\\theta(0)=0 For e^{-1}<\\\\delta<\\\\infty, the system explodes since the exponential term dominates. For 0<\\\\delta, the system goes to a steady state, the system doesn't explode. In particular, Semenov found the critical Damk√∂hler number, which is called as Frank-Kamenetskii parameter \\\\delta_c=e^{-1}(where \\\\theta=1) as a critical point where the system changes from steady state to explosive state. For \\\\delta\\\\gg 1, the solution is :\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\theta}{\\\\partial \\\\tau} = e^\\\\theta, \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad \\\\theta = \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac 1 {1-\\\\tau}\\\\right) At time \\\\tau=1, the system explodes. This time is also referred to as the adiabatic induction period since heat conduction is negligible here. Frank-Kamenetskii steady-state theoryZeldovich, I. A., Barenblatt, G. I., Librovich, V. B., and Makhviladze, G. M. (1985). Mathematical theory of combustion and explosions.Lewis, Bernard, and Guenther Von Elbe. Combustion, flames and explosions of gases. Elsevier, 2012. The only parameter which characterizes the explosion is the Damk√∂hler number \\\\delta. When \\\\delta is very high, conduction time is longer than the chemical reaction time and the system explodes with high temperature since there is not enough time for conduction to remove the heat. On the other hand, when \\\\delta is very low, heat conduction time is much faster than the chemical reaction time, such that all the heat produced by the chemical reaction is immediately conducted to the wall, thus there is no explosion, it goes to an almost steady state, Amable Li√±√°n coined this mode as slowly reacting mode. At a critical Damk√∂hler number \\\\delta_c the system goes from slowly reacting mode to explosive mode. Therefore, \\\\delta<\\\\delta_c, the system is in steady state. Instead of solving the full problem to find this \\\\delta_c, Frank-Kamenetskii solved the steady state problem for various Damk√∂hler number until the critical value, beyond which no steady solution exists. So the problem to be solved is : \\\\frac 1 {\\\\eta^j} \\\\frac d {d \\\\eta} \\\\left(\\\\eta^j \\\\frac{d \\\\theta}{d \\\\eta}\\\\right) = - \\\\delta e^\\\\theta with boundary conditions :\\\\theta(1)=0, \\\\quad \\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{d\\\\eta}_{\\\\eta=0}=0 the second condition is due to the symmetry of the vessel. The above equation is special case of Liouville‚ÄìBratu‚ÄìGelfand equation in mathematics. Planar vessel Frank-Kamenetskii explosion for planar vessel For planar vessel, there is an exact solution. Here j=0, then :\\\\frac{d^2\\\\theta}{d\\\\eta^2} = -\\\\delta e^\\\\theta If the transformations \\\\Theta= \\\\theta_m-\\\\theta and \\\\xi^2 = \\\\delta e^{\\\\theta_m} \\\\eta^2, where \\\\theta_m is the maximum temperature which occurs at \\\\eta=0 due to symmetry, are introduced :\\\\frac{d^2\\\\Theta}{d\\\\xi^2} = e^{-\\\\Theta}, \\\\quad \\\\Theta(0)=0, \\\\quad \\\\frac{d\\\\Theta}{d\\\\xi}_{\\\\xi=0}=0 Integrating once and using the second boundary condition, the equation becomes :\\\\frac{d\\\\Theta}{d\\\\xi} = \\\\sqrt{2(1-e^{-\\\\Theta})} and integrating again :e^{(\\\\theta_m-\\\\theta)/2} = \\\\cosh \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\delta e^{\\\\theta_m}}{2}} \\\\eta \\\\right) The above equation is the exact solution, but \\\\theta_m maximum temperature is unknown, but we have not used the boundary condition of the wall yet. Thus using the wall boundary condition \\\\theta=0 at \\\\eta=1, the maximum temperature is obtained from an implicit expression, :e^{\\\\theta_m/2} = \\\\cosh \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\delta e^{\\\\theta_m}} 2} \\\\right) \\\\quad \\\\text{or} \\\\quad \\\\delta = 2 e^{-\\\\theta_m} \\\\left(\\\\cosh^{-1} e^{\\\\theta_m/2}\\\\right)^2 Critical \\\\delta_c is obtained by finding the maximum point of the equation (look figure), i.e., d\\\\delta/d\\\\theta_m=0 at \\\\delta_c. :\\\\frac{d\\\\delta}{d\\\\theta_m}=0, \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad e^{\\\\theta_{m,c}/2} - \\\\sqrt{e^{\\\\theta_{m,c}}-1}\\\\cosh^{-1} e^{\\\\theta_{m,c}/2} =0 :\\\\theta_{m,c}= 1.1868, \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad \\\\delta_c = 0.8785 So the critical Frank-Kamentskii parameter is \\\\delta_c=0.8785. The system has no steady state( or explodes) for \\\\delta>\\\\delta_c=0.8785 and for \\\\delta<\\\\delta_c=0.8785, the system goes to a steady state with very slow reaction.

Writing back in original variable, the equation reads, :\\\\eta^2 \\\\left(\\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{d\\\\eta}\\\\right)^2+ 4\\\\eta \\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{d\\\\eta} = - 2\\\\delta\\\\eta^2 e^\\\\theta But the original equation multiplied by 2\\\\eta^2 is :2\\\\eta^2 \\\\frac{d^2\\\\theta}{d\\\\eta^2} + 2\\\\eta \\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{d\\\\eta} = -2 \\\\delta \\\\eta^2 e^\\\\theta Now subtracting the last two equation from one another leads to :\\\\frac{d^2\\\\theta}{d\\\\eta^2} - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta} \\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{d\\\\eta} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{d\\\\eta}\\\\right)^2 =0 This equation is easy to solve because it involves only the derivatives, so letting g(\\\\eta)=d\\\\theta/d\\\\eta transforms the equation :\\\\frac{dg}{d\\\\eta} - \\\\frac{g}{\\\\eta} - \\\\frac{g^2}{2}=0 This is a Bernoulli differential equation of order 2, a type of Riccati equation. The solution is :g(\\\\eta) = \\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{d\\\\eta} = -\\\\frac{4\\\\eta}{B'+\\\\eta^2} Integrating once again, we have \\\\theta = A - 2\\\\ln ( B\\\\eta^2 + 1) where B = 1/B'. We have used already one boundary condition, there is one more boundary condition left, but with two constants A, \\\\ B. It turns out A and B are related to each other, which is obtained by substituting the above solution into the starting equation we arrive at A = \\\\ln (8B/\\\\delta) . Therefore, the solution is :\\\\theta = \\\\ln \\\\left[\\\\frac{8B/\\\\delta}{(B\\\\eta^2+1)^2}\\\\right] Now if we use the other boundary condition \\\\theta(1)=0, we get an equation for B as \\\\delta(B+1)^2 - 8B =0. The maximum value of \\\\delta for which solution is possible is when B=1, so the critical Frank-Kamentskii parameter is \\\\delta_c=2. The system has no steady state( or explodes) for \\\\delta>\\\\delta_c=2 and for \\\\delta<\\\\delta_c=2, the system goes to a steady state with very slow reaction. The maximum temperature \\\\theta_m occurs at \\\\eta=0 :\\\\theta_m= \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{8B}{\\\\delta}\\\\right) \\\\quad \\\\text{or} \\\\quad \\\\delta= 8B e^{-\\\\theta_m} For each value of \\\\delta, we have two values of \\\\theta_m since B is multi-valued. The maximum critical temperature is \\\\theta_{m,c} = \\\\ln 4. Spherical vessel For spherical vessel, there is no known explicit solution, so Frank-Kamenetskii used numerical methods to find the critical value. Here j=2, then :\\\\frac 1 {\\\\eta^2} \\\\frac d {d\\\\eta}\\\\left(\\\\eta^2\\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{d\\\\eta}\\\\right) = -\\\\delta e^\\\\theta If the transformations \\\\Theta= \\\\theta_m-\\\\theta and \\\\xi^2 = \\\\delta e^{\\\\theta_m} \\\\eta^2, where \\\\theta_m is the maximum temperature which occurs at \\\\eta=0 due to symmetry, are introduced : \\\\frac 1 {\\\\xi^2}\\\\frac d {d\\\\xi}\\\\left(\\\\xi^2\\\\frac{d\\\\Theta}{d\\\\xi}\\\\right)= e^{-\\\\Theta}, \\\\quad \\\\Theta(0)=0, \\\\quad \\\\frac{d\\\\Theta}{d\\\\xi}_{\\\\xi=0}=0 The above equation is nothing but Emden‚ÄìChandrasekhar equation,Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.

From numerical solution, it is found that the critical Frank- Kamenetskii parameter is \\\\delta_c=3.32. The system has no steady state( or explodes) for \\\\delta>\\\\delta_c=3.32 and for \\\\delta<\\\\delta_c=3.32, the system goes to a steady state with very slow reaction. The maximum temperature \\\\theta_m occurs at \\\\eta=0 and maximum critical temperature is \\\\theta_{m,c} = 1.61. Non-symmetric geometries For vessels which are not symmetric about the center (for example rectangular vessel), the problem involves solving a nonlinear partial differential equation instead of a nonlinear ordinary differential equation, which can be solved only through numerical methods in most cases. The equation is : abla^2\\\\theta + \\\\delta e^\\\\theta =0 with boundary condition \\\\theta=0 on the bounding surfaces. Applications Since the model assumes homogeneous mixture, the theory is well applicable to study the explosive behavior of solid fuels (spontaneous ignition of bio fuels, organic materials, garbage, etc.,). This is also used to design explosives and fire crackers. The theory predicted critical values accurately for low conductivity fluids/solids with high conductivity thin walled containers.Zukas, Jonas A., William Walters, and William P. Walters, eds.

In 780 AH (1378/1379) Ahmad ibn Ajlan made his son Muhammad coregent. The appointment was to little effect, as Ahmad still retained full control over affairs of the Emirate. In 787 AH (1385) Ahmad imprisoned his brother Muhammad ibn Ajlan and his relatives Inan ibn Mughamis, Hasan ibn Thaqabah, Ahmad ibn Thaqabah, and Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Thaqabah. Inan escaped to Egypt and complained to Sultan al-Zahir Barquq. The Sultan ordered Ahmad to release the sharifs, but he refused. After Ahmad ibn Ajlan's death in Sha'ban 788 AH (September 1386) Muhammad ibn Ahmad became sole Emir of Mecca, with his uncle Kubaysh assuming a powerful role. Muhammad sent word to al-Zahir informing him of his father's death and requesting confirmation of his Emirate. He received the requested decree and khil'ah (robe of honor) either in late Shawwal or mid-Dhu al-Qi'dah 788 AH (November/December 1386). Around ten days after Ahmad's death, Kubaysh ordered the imprisoned sharifs to be blinded. When al-Zahir received news of this act he became angry with Muhammad and Kubaysh and decided to give the Emirate to Inan ibn Mughamis. He sent Inan to Mecca along with the Hajj caravan, which was led by the Emir Aqbugha al-Mardini. On Monday, 1 Dhu al-Hijjah 788 AH (24 December 1386), when Muhammad ibn Ahmad came out to receive the mahmal he was killed by two Ismaili Assassins, and al-Mardini designated Inan as Emir of Mecca.

Mani' ibn Rabi'a later acquired land in Ghusayba and al- Mulaybeed, later merged and developed into a city called Diriyah, which became the forerunner of this family's territory. Between 1654 and 1726, there was a fierce rivalry between the family's branches, namely Al Watban (descendants of Watban ibn Rabi'a) against Al Miqrin (descendants of Miqrin ibn Markhan), as well as wars against other rulers around Diriyah.

She is the Arthur Balfour Professor of Genetics, Head of the Department of Genetics at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of Darwin College, Cambridge. Ferguson-Smith is an authority on genomic imprinting and the epigenetic control of genome function in health and disease, and is recognised for her work on parental-origin effects and epigenetic mechanisms. Her work has uncovered epigenetically regulated processes in development and over the life course, and identified key in vivo mechanisms involved in the maintenance of epigenetic states. She also explores communication between the environment and the genome with implications for health, disease and inheritance. Education Ferguson-Smith was born on 23 July 1961 in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. She was educated at the University of Glasgow where she was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Molecular Biology. She moved to the Biology Department at Yale University to undertake a PhD identifying human Hox genes and characterising mammalian Hox clusters, supervised by Frank Ruddle. Career and Research Ferguson-Smith conducted postdoctoral research with Azim Surani at the University of Cambridge from 1989 to 1994, where she initiated molecular studies on genomic imprinting - the process causing genes to be expressed according to their parental origin. The team identified one of the first endogenous imprinted genes, and showed that the process was epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation. Her subsequent research in the Department of Physiology Development and Neuroscience (formerly Anatomy) at the University of Cambridge identified functions for, and regulatory mechanisms of, genomic imprinting, and contributed to its establishment as a model for understanding the epigenetic control of mammalian genome function. This work resulted in the characterisation of pathways important in mammalian development and growth, in the regulation of metabolism, and in the control of adult neurogenesis. In 2013 she was appointed Professor and Head of the Department of Genetics at the University of Cambridge and became the seventh Arthur Balfour Professor of Genetics in 2015. Her research continues to forge links between DNA sequence, epigenetic modifications and gene regulation, and their impact on phenotype; and the mechanisms and implications of epigenetic inheritance. =Awards and honours= Ferguson-Smith was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) in 2002, was awarded EMBO Membership in 2006 and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2017 Personal life  Ferguson-Smith is the daughter of the geneticist Malcolm Ferguson-Smith.

The equation has no known explicit solution. If a polytropic fluid is used instead of an isothermal fluid, one obtains the Lane‚ÄìEmden equation.

The equation appears in other branches of physics as well, for example the same equation appears in the Frank-Kamenetskii explosion theory for a spherical vessel. The relativistic version of this spherically symmetric isothermal model was studied by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in 1972Chandrasekhar, S. (1972). A limiting case of relativistic equilibrium. In General Relativity (in honor of J. L. Synge), ed. L. O'Raifeartaigh. Oxford. Clarendon Press (pp. 185-199)..

Though the density obtained as solution of this isothermal gas sphere decreases from the centre, it decreases too slowly to give a well- defined surface and finite mass for the sphere. It can be shown that, as \\\\xi \\\\gg 1, :\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\rho_c}=e^{-\\\\psi}=\\\\frac{2}{\\\\xi^2} \\\\left[1+\\\\frac{A}{\\\\xi^{1/2}} \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt 7}{2}\\\\ln \\\\xi + \\\\delta\\\\right) + O(\\\\xi^{-1})\\\\right] where A and \\\\delta are constants which will be obtained with numerical solution. This behavior of density gives rise to increase in mass with increase in radius.

Discovery and naming  The remains were excavated by the Argentine paleontologist Jaime Powell and collaborators in 1984 and described by him in 1987, where he identified the dinosaur remains as a possible \\"indeterminate lambeosaurine\\", comparing it mainly with the genera Hypacrosaurus and Barsboldia due to great size of the neural spines. In 2010, Rub√©n D. Ju√°rez Valieri and his team erected a new genus and hadrosaurid species called Willinakaqe salitralensis from different materials found in 2 different locations (Salitral Moreno and Islas Malvinas) of the Allen Formation, which are mostly housed in the collection of the Carlos Ameghino Provincial Museum, where the specimen was examined by Powell, and was made the paratype of this new genus, in addition to the holotype of Lapampasaurus as material attributed to W. salitralensis from the second locality and housed in the Provincial Museum of Natural History, in the province of La Pampa. Later, the Spanish paleontologist Pen√©lope Cruz-Caballero and the Argentine Rodolfo Coria reviewed the material attributed to the genus Willinakaqe in 2016, where they concluded that fossils may represent more than one taxon of hadrosaurid and that the characteristics used in the diagnosis would not be valid. Also, the specimen is not preserved in good condition in addition to being incomplete, and therefore non- diagnostic, degrading it to the status of \\"indeterminate Hadrosauridae\\" and making Willinakaqe salitrensis a Nomen vanum. In 2017 Cruzado-Caballero and Powell reassign the paratype of W. salitralensis to its own genus and species, Bonapartesaurus rionegrensis, converting the former into a chimera of different hadrosaurids, and hence, an invalid name.  Description  The holotype specimen MPCA-Pv SM2/1-71, consists of a partial skeleton including 4 dorsal vertebrae, a complete sacrum, 8 anterior caudal vertebrae, 9 medial caudal vertebrae, 2 blocks with 5 medial caudal vertebrae each, 18 haemal arches, 3 dorsal ribs, a distal fragment of the right scapula, a distal fragment of the left humerus, a left ulna, a right ilium, a nearly complete left pubis, distal fragments of both ischia, both femurs, tibias, and fibulae, a left astragalus, a right calcaneus, an almost complete articulated left foot and two blocks with tendons. All the material present was extracted from the Salitral Moreno site of the R√≠o Negro province in southern Argentina, from the lower member of the Allen Formation, which dates to the Late Cretaceous (Campanian to Maastrichtian). Bonapartesaurus is characterized by the following combination of unique characters: the proportion between the height of the neural, sacral and centrum spines is greater than 3.5; the neural spines of the anterior part of the caudal vertebrae are extremely long (between three and a half and four times the height of the centrum) and evenly the distal expansion; a pre-acetabular process slightly flexed ventrally, with the angle greater than 150¬∞; the proportion between the maximum dorsoventral depth of the posterior end of the dorsoventral preacetabular process and the distance from the pubic peduncle to the dorsal margin of the iliac bone is inferior to 0,50; The ratio between height and anteroposterior dorsoventral length of the iliac lamina is 0.8 or higher; an asymmetric lateral profile of the supraacetabular process; the posterior portion of the mediolateral postacetabular process markedly thicker as a result of the dorsomedial torsion of the postacetabular process; an expanded cnemial crest limited anteriorily to the proximal end of the tibia; and the articular surface of the astragalus for the internal malleolus of the tibia is moderately expanded medially, articulating with only a part of the ventral surface of the tibial internal malleolus.  Phylogeny  The only phylogenetic analysis of Bonapartesaurus follows Paul Sereno's definition for Hadrosauridae from 1998, in addition to using the traditional classification of Hadrosaurinae (prior to the consensus of Prieto-Marquez in 2010), which includes all non-crested hadrosaurids along with the fragmentary genus Hadrosaurus within the same subfamily. It is also placed within the Saurolophini tribe, being more derived than Prosaurolophus, but more basal than Saurolophus spp., in contrast to the tentative classification of Willinakaqe within the Kritosaurini tribe. The following cladogram is based on the phylogenetic analysis of Cruzado-Caballero & Powell in 2017. (Relations with Lambeosaurinae as well as with Hadrosauroidea are not shown here).

It is an essential part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The roadmap to achieve the Agenda is the Education 2030 Incheon Declaration and Framework for Action, which outlines how countries, working with UNESCO and global partners, can translate commitments into action. The Education 2030 Agenda stretches from early childhood learning to youth and adult education and training; Emphasizes the acquisition of skills for work; Underlines the importance of citizenship education; Focuses on inclusion, equity and gender equality; And aims to ensure quality learning outcomes for all, throughout their lives. While the main responsibility for implementing the agenda lies with governments, UNESCO and partners provide support through coordinated policy advice, technical assistance, capacity development and monitoring of progress at global, regional and national levels.  Ten targets to achieve the Education 2030 Agenda  The 10 targets of Sustainable Development Goal 4 encompass many different aspects of education. Seven targets are of expected outcomes and three are means of achieving these targets. 4.1 Universal primary and secondary education: By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes. 4.2 Early childhood development and universal pre-primary education: By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education. 4.3 Equal access to technical/vocational and higher education: By 2030, ensure equal access for all women and men to an affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university. 4.4 Relevant skills for decent work: By 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship. 4.5 Gender equality and inclusion: By 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situations. 4.6 Universal youth and adult literacy: By 2030, ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy. 4.7 Education for sustainable development and global citizenship: By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture‚Äôs contribution to sustainable development. 4.a Effective learning environments: Build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive and provide safe, non-violent, inclusive and effective learning environments for all. 4.b Scholarships: By 2020, substantially expand globally the number of scholarships available to developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States and African countries, for enrolment in higher education, including vocational training and information and communications technology, technical, engineering and scientific programmes, in developed countries and other developing countries. 4.c Teachers and educators: By 2030, substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing States.  Large-scale learning assessment  Large- scale learning assessments (LSLAs) are tools to monitor learning-related outcomes in the 2030 agenda. It focuses on effective acquisition of relevant knowledge, foundational and transferable skills and competencies as the basis for learning throughout life as well as learning for work and civic, social and cultural life.UNESCO. 2016a.

The album follows Ongala's acclaimed appearances at the WOMAD Tour and WOMAD'S release of Naillia Mwana, a compilation of early music by Ongala, two events which gave Ongala international recognition. Songs for the Poor Man was recorded at the WOMAD- affiliated Real World Studios in Wiltshire over three days in May 1989 with production, engineering and mixing help from David Bottrill. The album exemplifies Ongala and the band's move towards a soukous-style sound, while being more sparse and broadened than conventional soukous and adding elements of East African funk, Latin and Caribbean music, as well as making prominent usage of conga parts to double its guitar lines. Ongala's lyrics deal with social issues such as urban poverty in Tanzania and racism. Upon release, Songs for the Poor Man won critical acclaim from critics, praising the album's conviction and passion. Robert Christgau named it the 8th greatest album of 1989, and Tom Moon included it in the book 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die. Background and recording Real World Studios in 1990. Although 'Ubongo beat' musician Remmy Ongala, alongside his backing band Orchestre Super Matimila, started to become one of the most famous musicians in Tanzania in the 1980s, his increasing fame failed to parallel with increasing fortune due to a lack of adequate copyright law protection and scam record labels in countries such as Kenya who pressed more copies of a recording by Ongala than they agreed to, keeping the royalties from the extra copies themselves. Ongala did, however, give a tape of his music to an English friend who was visiting Ongala's native Dar es Salaam and returning to London, who later passed the cassette on, ultimately finding itself at the hands of Peter Gabriel's world music organisation WOMAD. Pleased with his music, WOMAD released a critically acclaimed compilation of his early 1980s lo-fi recordings entitled Nalilia Mwana, which established many of his musical themes. WOMAD also invited Ongala and Orchestre Super Matimila to play on the 1988 edition of its annual WOMAD Tour, where audiences greeted his music with enthusiasm. Although highly popular in East Africa, his new WOMAD performances and album helped him reach European and American audiences. While the band‚Äôs appearances were acclaimed, the ensemble had to shrink in size when playing live for touring practicality, and were also moving towards a soukous sound, \\"the brasher, faster modern variant of rumba Congolaise then popular.\\" WOMAD and Gabriel contacted Ongala and Orchestre Super Matimila, and Ongala agreed to record a new album, Songs for the Poor Man, for Gabriel and WOMAD's new label Real World Records. By the time of the recording, Orchestre Super Matimila \\"had become a regular fixture at WOMAD festivals.\\" The album was recorded and mixed at Gabriel's Real World Studios in Box, Wiltshire, England, over three days in 1989 during \\"Recording Week.\\" The album was produced by Ongala with Basil Anderson and David Bottrill, who engineered, mixed and edited the album. Christopher Johns acted as assistant engineer. Composition =Music= At the root of Songs for the Poor Man is the \\"steady, melodic drive\\" of the Za√Ørean-style of soukous, the \\"shimmery Afro-pop dance style,\\" and each song on the album is based on the genre's defining interlaced guitar appregios. Unlike conventional soukous however, which is brisk and uptight, Songs for the Poor Man broadens soukous' backbeats while slowing them down, giving them \\"a touch of professional swagger and a touch of East African funk.\\" According to Bob Tarte of AllMusic, the album's Tanzanian take on soukous \\"is as restrained as the Zairian form is hedonistic.\\" The music is aided by the inclusion of a \\"fluid East African guitar style and infectious Tanzanian rhythms.\\" Music critic Robert Christgau felt the \\"unbrassy band\\", consisting of three percussionists, three guitarists, a saxophonist and a bassist, strives in a unique way unlike that of Afro-Parisian music. The up-front conga parts, played by Saidi Salum Jumaine, double the guitar lines and, according to Christgau, \\"convey an esteem for both tribal difference and East African ways that complements the caring precision of Ongala's singing and the undulating buoyancy of his groove.\\" The music on the album is broad and spacious, and contains elements of Caribbean and Latin music. Ongala's voice on the album has been described as rich, soulful, and weathered. \\"Kipenda Roho\\" features a \\"hard drive\\" while \\"Mariamu Wangu\\", Ongala's \\"own all-time favourite,\\" is based on the popular \\"mdundiko ngoma,\\" which originates from Dar es Salaam. =Lyrics= Unlike previous music by Ongala, the album contains songs in both English and Swahili, as opposed to just Swahili. Ongala decided to write and sing some songs in English so that he could reach a wider audience. The album tackles social themes, and features both elegies and sorrowful laments. Author Tom Moon compared the songs to lullabies and felt that \\"Ongala sounds like one who knows what it's like to be down, and knows, also, that he will not give up.\\" The \\"steadfastness of women\\" is one subject on the album, as is reckoning with death, which is dealt with on \\"Kifo.\\" \\"Karola\\" warns listeners to \\"be careful in a world where you believe there is goodness,\\" while \\"Kipenda Roho\\" is an anti-racist song. Although poverty has been described as the album's theme, racism is considered its second most prevalent subject. The situation regarding development policy in Tanzania in the late 1980s was poor, and the country had entered a prolonged period economic contraction until 1994. In this period, Ongala styled himself as the \\"voice of the poor man,\\" and this is evident in the lyrics and title of Songs for the Poor Man. Problems affecting the urban poor in particular are addressed specifically on songs such as \\"Mnyonge Hana Haki\\" ('The Poor Have No Rights') and a remake of \\"Sauti Ya Mnyonge\\" ('Voice of the Poor Man'); in the latter song, Ongala \\"assumed the character of a poor urban migrant to highlight the daily problems of poverty,\\" with lyrics such as \\"I sleep on a goat skin/On the floor with bugs and fleas/With no electricity ‚Äì just a paraffin lamp.\\" One writer elaborated on the lyrics of the song: \\"Mnyonge Hana Haki\\" developed the themes of urban poverty, \\"in which the association of Dar es Salaam with the pressures of liberalization, competition and inequality is made more explicit;\\" Ongala attacked the belief that town life is \\"easier, better or wealthier than rural life.\\" One writer noted: \\"Dar es Salaam is not the 'House of Peace' but of social insecurities such as being dependent upon a landlord. A key point in both ‚ÄòSauti ya Mnyonge‚Äô and ‚ÄòMnyonge Hana Haki‚Äô is that without the extended support network of a village community, those without wealth have no authority to speak for their needs.\\" Release and reception Songs for the Poor Man was released on 30 October 1989 by Real World Records, and was the sixth release on the label. The album cover features a composite image, created by Rani Charrington, depicting Ongola's face superimposed over a satellite image taken and licensed by the Science Photo Library. Jones/Mouat of Assorted Images are credited for artwork design, Francis Drake for photography and Peter Gabriel for liner notes. The album was released to critical acclaim. Bob Tarte of AllMusic, while rating the album three stars out of five, was praiseful, saying \\"Ongala's songs on social themes are delivered with winning conviction.\\" Writing in his Consumer's Guide for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau rated the album a grade of \\"A.\\" He said: \\"Isolated culturally and economically by socialist underdevelopment, Tanzanian pop nurtures national treasures more diligently than neighboring Zairean and Kenyan styles,\\" praising the album's musical palette, conga parts, \\"esteem for both tribal difference and East African ways,\\" and concluding: \\"Sweet. Strong. Maybe even self-sufficient.\\" Christgau named it the eighth best album of 1989 in his annual list of his favourite albums, curated for the annual Pazz & Jop poll. In 2004, Songlines ranked the album at number 34 in their list of \\"50 Essential African Albums.\\"Songlines magazine 2004 The album features in Tom Moon's 2008 book 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die. Describing the album as \\"passionately sung odes to heal the soul,\\" Moon said the songs \\"speak, with great empathy, about suffering and poverty, trials [Ongala] knew from personal experience,\\" and felt \\"the rhythm is entrancing without being overpowering;\\" he described \\"Kifo\\" and \\"Pamella\\" as highlights. In his 1992 book Breakout: Profiles in African Rhythm, writer Gary Stewart noted the album's messages were \\"strong and passionate\\" and said the record was \\"music for the brain and for the feet and hips as well.\\" He concluded that \\"if acceptance [of racial equality] is not yet total, at least this dreadlocked, consciousness-rating African is beginning to get a hearing.\\" In the Rough Guides book World Music: Africa, Europe and the Middle East, the album was described as Ongala's \\"best international release.\\" Aftermath While Songs for the Poor Man helped expand Ongala's international audience, he caused controversy in Tanzania in 1990 with the release of the song \\"Mambo Kwa Socks\\" ('Things with Socks'), which called for young men to wear condoms to prevent catching AIDS (the song was released at the height of the AIDS pandemic in Africa); the song was banned on Radio Tanzania Dar es Salaam, but \\"live shows and black market tapes have ensured that his message has spread.\\" In 1992, Ongala and the Orchestre Super Matimila recorded a second album for Real World Records, Mambo, which similarly featured a mix of Swahili and English songs, while also trading in \\"the laid-back soukous\\" of Songs for the Poor Man for a rougher dance sound.

By using a stemmatic approach, the textual critic tries to trace the oldest surviving manuscript and show the relationship it has to its ancestors. This makes it possible to compare changes made in different traditions branching off from the archetype, and develop an edition that reconstructs the text of the archetype as closely as possible. An archetype should not be confused with the autograph, which is the first handwritten manuscript by an author. The archetype is also commonly mistaken to be the original text, although many would argue that it is impossible to locate an original textEpp, Eldon Jay. \\"The Multivalence of the Term 'Original Text' in New Testament Textual Criticism.\\" The Harvard Theological Review, vol. 92, no. 3, 1999, pp. 245‚Äì281. . within a tradition where there may not be surviving evidence, and because the author and editors may have constructed several drafts and editions throughout the process, from the moment of birth of the author's idea until the publication of an edition of the work.

Plot  A crew of four human characters are lost in space, far away from Earth. On their journey back home, they meet aliens, offering them quests. Features The content uses procedural generation to offer a diversified and open ended experience. Ship moves are realistic, as the player has to use gravitational slingshot to navigate. There is a steep learning curve to be proficient to travel. Aliens encountered have their own culture, so the player has to make decisions, risking a cultural misunderstanding. Reception The reception to The Long Journey Home has been mixed. Its aggregate Metacritic score is 68/100. Polygon, rating it 55%, explained that the game was \\"extraordinarily difficult to navigate\\" and \\"infuriating,\\" concluding that it had failed to live up to the promise of a \\"truly narrative- driven roguelike.\\" IGN, which gave the game a 6.4, complained of \\"the weight of frustrating and tedious minigames\\" that were \\"often unfair.\\" Kotaku dismissed the game as built upon \\"a poorly-implemented version\\" of Lunar Lander, \\"an infuriating experience\\" and \\"a poorly thought-out homage.\\" History The studio, Daedalic, was better known for point and click adventure games, with a strong narrative.
