He was one of the founders of the Nuove tendenze as well as of Novecento Italian art movements. Biography His family of Belgian origin moved to Milan when he was a child. He studied at the Brera Academy in Milan from 1903 to 1905 and joined the Coenobium, a group of young artists belonging to the Scapigliatura movement, in Monza together with his friend Anselmo Bucci. After a stay in Paris (1906‚Äì07), his Divisionist style brought him into contact with Alberto Grubicy‚Äôs gallery. He adopted Futurism in 1912 and was one of the founders of Nuove Tendenze movement. In close contact with the critic Margherita Sarfatti in the years following World War I, he took part in the Venice Biennale (13th Esposizione Internazionale d‚ÄôArte di Venezia) in 1922, and in the following year was one of the group of Sette pittori del Novecento who started the Novecento art movement exhibiting at the Galleria Pesaro in Milan. Relations between members of the Novecento movement were not always smooth, as shown by his participation in their first group exhibition in 1926 but not in the second in 1929. One of his works was bought in 1928 for the Galleria d‚ÄôArte Moderna in Milan, and his first solo exhibition was held in 1936 at the Milanese Galleria Dedalo.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Gary, and the home of Holy Angels Parish. History Holy Angels Parish was established by the Rev. Thomas F. Jansen in September 1906 in the Diocese of Fort Wayne. It was the first Catholic parish founded in the city of Gary. The initial Masses in the parish were celebrated in a tavern at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Broadway. The first parish building was a combination church and school. The parishioners were mostly Eastern European, Irish, German and Italian. Holy Angels School opened in 1909 with the School Sisters of Notre Dame as the faculty. The parish grew slowly and by the 1940s there was a need for a larger church building. The Rev. John A. Sullivan was the pastor when the present church was built in the Gothic Revival style. The cornerstone was laid on October 26, 1947, and it was dedicated on January 29, 1950, by Bishop John F. Noll. When Pope Pius XII established the Diocese of Gary on December 10, 1956, Holy Angels Church became the cathedral of the new diocese. In the 1960s the primarily Caucasian parish began to change as African American and Latin American parishioners joined Holy Angels when St. Anthony's and Sacred Heart churches closed. The school building and convent were torn down in 1965 when a new two-story facility was built for $1.2 million. The building contained school classrooms, a convent, gymnasium, cafeteria and space for a parish hall. On June 7, 1994, the name of the school was changed to the Sister Thea Bowman School. It is now a charter school named the Thea Bowman Leadership Academy. Architecture On entering the worship space one encounters the baptismal pool and then is led to the altar, which is located in the transept. The pool is made of travertine marble and the four pillars at the base are from the old high altar. The base and the top of the ambry, where the holy oils are kept, is the former baptismal font. The upper section is made from black walnut. The altar is constructed of marble and is roughly square in shape. In the floor surrounding the altar are angels in mosaic. They reflect the diversity of the human race and of the diocese itself: African, Caucasian, Asian and Latin. In the apse of the cathedral is the reredos from the old high altar with a Calvary grouping. The cathedra, or bishop's chair, sits in the presbytery in front of the old reredos. It is carved from black walnut and was installed in 1996. A carved angel stands next to the chair. The ambo is constructed of the same materials as the altar and reredos. The tabernacle is located in the Blessed Sacrament Chapel. A cross is formed behind the tabernacle by four carved angels in adoration. The shrine of the Holy Angels is in the east transept. It includes an icon of the Synaxis of the Holy Angels, which was done in an Ethiopian-Coptic style. The shrine is dedicated to deceased parishioners and priests of the diocese. Bishop Andrew Gregory Grutka, the first bishop of Gary, was laid to rest here in 1993.

He obtained a licence to open a lithographic printing shop in 1827 and ran it as a self-taught printer, possibly in response to the growing interest in the engraving technique that had spread quickly at the Brera. When the shop was forced out of business by stiff competition in 1831, the artist continued to work for various publishers, reproducing works by celebrated artists of the time and making prints of views of Lombardy drawn from life.

Forbes-Robertson had been knighted by King George V in 1913 and had retired from acting in theatre that same year.

The \\"old maid\\" believes that only false hair and powder will make her beautiful. The major and his wife are continuously quarreling. Their daughter Vivian is being forced into a marriage for money. The young artist accepts an assignment of not the choicest line of work to secure funds to marry Vivian. Harry Larkcom is trying to force his attentions on a weak slavey. However, the arrival of The Stranger and his talk with each make them realize the selfishness and narrowness of their existence, and before long the boarding house is a happy and contented place.

He was much influenced by Tranquillo Cremona.  Life  Filippini was born in Brescia, in Lombardy in northern Italy, on 18 September 1853, into a poor family. His father Lorenzo was a carpenter, his mother Silvia Signoria a seamstress. He was soon sent to work, first as a waiter in a pastry-shop, later as a clerk to a notary public. Filippini attended the school of drawing at the Pinacoteca Tosio; from 1872 he received a grant from the city council to continue these studies. In 1875 he received an allowance to study under Giuseppe Bertini in Milan. In 1879 another grant allowed him to travel to Paris to visit the Salon. Filippini exhibited at the annual shows of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera in Milan from 1879, and from 1880 lived in that city. He made his living by teaching, both in schools and privately. He was made an honorary member of the Accademia di Brera in 1878. He died in Milan on 6 March 1895.  Work  When young, Filippini painted mostly religious or historical subjects, as well as some portraits. In later life he painted mostly landscapes ‚Äì of the Apennines, of Pegli, of Porto Valtravaglia, of the Val Camonica or of the Valle Seriana ‚Äì or seascapes in Chioggia, Genova, Naples or Venice. His work shows the influence of the Scapigliatura painter Tranquillo Cremona. References  Further reading  * Vasco Frati (1999).

Constructed between 1859 and 1861, the park is one of the oldest parks and the most famous one in the city. History The idea of setting up the park was floated by Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet, Governor of Madras in 1859‚Äì60. He also approved the plan and began the construction activities on the site. Following Trevelyan's dismissal in 1860, the work was continued by his successor William Denison. The park was eventually completed in 1861 and a Committee of Management appointed to maintain it. Geography The park extended for about 112 acres at one point of time and was the biggest of its kind in Chennai. There were 12 lakes within the limits of the park apart from five and half miles of road. Boating facilities were available on Victoria Lake. There was also a metalled road in the eastern corner of the park called \\"The Equestrians' Ride\\". The Madras zoological park was located in People's Park before being shifted to Vandalur in 1985.

He is known for combining classical and electronic music and for an unconventional approach to the piano in which he mixes a grand piano, upright piano, Roland Juno-60, Rhodes piano, drum machines, and Moog Taurus. In addition to his solo work, Frahm has released collaborations with such notable performers as √ìlafur Arnalds, F. S. Blumm, Anne M√ºller and Woodkid. With Frederic Gmeiner and Sebastian Singwald he records and performs as Nonkeen. Biography Frahm had an early introduction to music. His father, Klaus Frahm, was a photographer who also designed covers for ECM Records. He grew up near Hamburg, where he learned the styles of the classical pianists as well as contemporary composers. At school he used mixing boards and was very interested in the quality of recorded sound. He studied classical piano for 8 years under Nahum Brodsky, the prot√©g√© of the prot√©g√© of Tchaikovsky, who lived in a neighbouring village. In 2006, rather than pursue an orchestra career, Frahm moved to Berlin as a jobbing technician. Frahm's earlier solo piano works Wintermusik (2009) and The Bells (2009) gained him attention, but it was his 2011 release Felt that was met with critical acclaim. It was his first studio album on Erased Tapes, which has released his music since. It was followed by the solo synthesizer EP Juno; and by Screws (2012), recorded while Frahm was recovering from a thumb injury, and which was offered as a free download to fans on his birthday. His follow-up to Juno, titled Juno Reworked (2013), featured guest reworks by Luke Abbott and Chris Clark. Frahm's album Spaces (2013) was made of live recordings from various venues spanning two years. In December 2013, Frahm released his first music book, Sheets Eins (Sheets One), published by Manners McDade. In 2016 the follow-up Sheets Zwei was released. In 2014, Frahm announced his new piano \\"Una Corda\\", specially designed and made for him by David Klavins. It weighs under 100 kg and has one string per key. (Standard pianos have from one to three strings per key.) His album Solo (2015), an improvised single take with no overdubs, was later recorded on the \\"Modell 370\\", a 370 cm high vertical piano also made by David Klavins. It was one of 19 records nominated for the IMPALA Album of the Year Award. A condensed version of Frahm's single \\"More\\" was featured in the trailer for the video game Assassin's Creed Unity gamescom. In 2015, Frahm composed his first original film score, for the German film Victoria, a 140-minute continuous take directed by Sebastian Schipper. He also collaborated with Woodkid on the critically acclaimed short film ELLIS directed by JR which was released in October 2015. In the same year, Frahm created \\"Piano Day\\", celebrated on the 88th day of the year (due to the standard piano's 88 keys). The event's first project was the construction, with David Klavins, of the Modell 450 piano, the successor to the Modell 370. In February 2016, Frahm released The Gamble, followed by its companion release Oddments of the Gamble in August 2016. Pitchfork described the album as \\"charmingly patched together and messy as it is well-paced and dynamic\\". The material was recorded over eight years while the artwork was produced by Frahm's father. In 2016 Frahm curated Possibly Colliding at the Barbican Centre in London, featuring a weekend of music, art and films. Core attitudes Frahm has said \\"I‚Äôm interested in how human beings react in certain situations, and what music does to people‚Äôs emotions. How we can change people‚Äôs attitudes with tones. After I‚Äôve played a good concert, people leave the room happy. This is something we can give back to the world. When people feel down and like it‚Äôs all going to shit, at least we can give them some music and change their attitude so people don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs all shit... That‚Äôs my religion.\\" Equipment Nils Frahm and the Una Corda (front), Roland Juno-60 (behind him), Fender Rhodes (under the Juno-60), Roland RE-501 (on top behind the Juno-60), Moog Taurus (on the floor behind him) and other equipment.

The petroleum industry needs advanced computer modeling to assist in the extraction and movement of petroleum products. The telecommunications and datacenter industries need the most advanced research in computing networks, broadband, and other forms of advanced computing infrastructure. The healthcare industry needs efficient and secure management of electronic patient records, clinical information systems, and data interoperability protocols for the exchange and sharing of data. The media industry needs solutions for the cataloging and retrieval of vast amounts of content generated through audio and video, and it needs Arabic language technology solutions to digitize and publish the vast Arabic language corpora. QCRI also works closely with both the basic research institutes in Qatar, including the Education City Universities on their most promising basic research findings. It also will work closely with QSTP to identify the most viable commercial applications of QCRI‚Äôs research. Activities Research topics investigated by the QCRI include Arabic language computer technologies, computer security and data analysis. The Arabic Language Technology Ecosystem Grand Challenge is to have an Arabic Language Technology research community in the Arab world of 100 specialized researchers, research engineers, and developers. The Arabic Machine Translation Grand Challenge hopes to realize machine translation for translating text or speech for 20 languages to and from Arabic.

At one point, he was made Hubu Langzhong (Êà∂ÈÉ®ÈÉé‰∏≠), a supervisory official at the ministry of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®, Hubu), but had his office at the eastern capital Luoyang, not at the capital Chang'an. He had once submitted a petition accusing the eunuch Hao Jingquan (ÈÉùÊôØÂÖ®) of impropriety, but was instead himself accused of violating naming taboo of Emperor Xianzong's father Emperor Shunzong (who was named Li Song) by using the character Song (Ë®ü, a different character than Emperor Shunzong's name) in his petition; he was initially punished by having part of his salary withheld. Li Xi submitted another petition, pointing out that the phrase he used was used in imperial edicts of the past and that he should not be punished for quoting imperial edicts; the punishment against him was then reversed. When the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao captured Luoyang in 879,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. by which time Emperor XuƒÅnzong's grandson Emperor Xizong was emperor, Li Xi took eight seals used by the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng), crossed the Yellow River, and fled to Heyang (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, in modern Luoyang, Henan). The defender of Luoyang, Liu Yunzhang (ÂäâÂÖÅÁ´†), who had surrendered to Huang Chao, sent messengers to Li Xi demanding the seals; Li Xi refused to yield them. This made Liu realize that he should not submit to Huang either, and he subsequently repudiated his allegiance to Huang. At a later point, when Li Yun the Prince of Xiang challenged Emperor Xizong for the throne in 886,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. Li Xi happened to be staying away from the warfare in Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), and he tried, in vain, to persuade Huainan's military governor Gao Pian not to recognize Li Yun as emperor. At a later point, Li Xi was recalled to Chang'an to serve at Zhongshu Sheren (‰∏≠Êõ∏Ëàç‰∫∫), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng), as well as imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi). At a later point, he resigned and retired to Huayin, but was yet later recalled to again serve as imperial scholar.  Failed attempt at chancellorship and subsequent chancellorship  In 894, by which time Emperor Xizong's brother and successor Emperor Zhaozong was emperor, Li Xi was serving as the chief imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´ÊâøÊó®, Hanlin Xueshi Chengzhi), when Emperor Zhaozong made him a chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã). However, the chancellor Cui Zhaowei disliked Li Xi and feared that Li Xi would divert his power, and therefore persuaded the imperial official Liu Chonglu (ÂäâÂ¥áÈ≠Ø) into disrupting the public declaration ‚Äî by stepping out into the open at the imperial gathering, bearing mourning clothes and weeping. Liu publicly stated that Li Xi was wicked and had only become imperial scholar because of his relationships with the eunuchs Yang Fugong and Ximen Junsui (Ë•øÈñÄÂêõÈÅÇ). Emperor Zhaozong, faced with this public display, cancelled Li Xi's commission and made him Taizi Shaofu (Â§™Â≠êÂ∞ëÂÇÖ), an advisor to the Crown Prince. Li Xi responded by submitting 10 petitions defending himself and accusing Liu of crimes, going as far as writing sharply-worded language that included references to the suicide of Liu's father Liu Fu (ÂäâÁ¨¶) while Liu Fu was being investigated for corruption and accusations that Liu Chonglu and his brother Liu Chongwang were themselves eunuchs' associates. His accusatory petitions did not stop even after Emperor Zhaozong suspended Liu Chonglu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. It was said that these petitions were well written, but the public, while recognizing the artfulness of the writing, looked at Li Xi poorly for the bitterness. However, Emperor Zhaozong still respected Li Xi for his talent, and, in spring 895, again named him chancellor, as well as the deputy minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Hubu Shilang). Cui, who was by this point in close alliance with the warlords Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and Wang Xingyu the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), thereafter falsely stated to Li Maozhen and Wang that fellow chancellor Wei Zhaodu had prevented the bestowing of the highly honorary title of Shangshu Ling (Â∞öÊõ∏‰ª§) on Wang and had recommended Li Xi as chancellor; he further suggested that Wei and Li Xi were in favor of a campaign against Li Maozhen and Wang, just as the deceased chancellor Du Rangneng was. Li Maozhen and Wang thereafter submitted multiple petitions objecting to Li Xi's commission as chancellor. Emperor Zhaozong was forced to placate them by removing Li Xi, making him Taizi Shaoshi (Â§™Â≠êÂ∞ëÂ∏´), also an advisor to the Crown Prince.  Removal and death  However, soon thereafter, Li Maozhen, Wang Xingyu, and their ally Han Jian the military governor of Zhenguo Circuit (ÈéÆÂúã, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), locked in a dispute with Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), over their contrary recommendations for the military governorship of Huguo Circuit (Ë≠∑Âúã, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) (Li Maozhen, Wang, and Han recommended Wang Gong, while Li Keyong recommended Wang Ke), decided to march on Chang'an to force Emperor Zhaozong to agree to their demands. Once they arrived at Chang'an, they submitted demands to Emperor Zhaozong that Li Xi and Wei Zhaodu be executed. Emperor Zhaozong refused, but Li Maozhen, Wang, and Han then executed Li Xi and Wei anyway. Li Xi's son Li Wei (ÊùéÊ≤á) was also killed. After Li Keyong attacked and defeated Wang later that year, Emperor Zhaozong posthumously honored both Li Xi and Li Wei. It was said that Li Xi was studious and had a large book collection, earning him the nickname of Shulou (i.e., \\"tower of books\\"). He was also a prolific writer and annotator. In the aftermaths of his death, however, the collection was lost.  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 157. * New Book of Tang, vol. 146. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 259, 260.

Project GRAD's mission is to improve lives in low-income communities by helping individuals develop and achieve their educational aspirations. Founded in 1994 by James and Kathryn Ketelsen,http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston- texas/houston/article/Former-CEO-James-Ketelsen-who-made-helping-11110836.php Project GRAD originally worked in five Houston ISD high schools: Northside High School (Houston), Wheatley High School (Houston), Sam Houston Math, Science, and Technology Center, Heights High School, and Yates High School offering scholarships through their GRAD Scholar Program to students who met certain requirements as a way to increase graduation rates. From there, GRAD began working in the high school feeder patterns offering educators, math and reading curriculum, and strict disciplinary practiceshttp://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/HISD-board-to-vote- on-future-of-Project-GRAD-1886579.php to 70 HISD schools. Nearly 20 years after its founding and after becoming a \\"nationally renowned college-prep program\\",http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston- texas/houston/article/Project-GRAD-changing-its-Houston-model-5097403.php Project GRAD shifted away from the scholarship provider model to a community based model outside of the school district. In 2015, in partnership with the City of Houston and Houston Public Library, Project GRAD brought caf√©college, originally a San Antonio \\"'one-stop-shop' for free college access advice, guidance, and workshops\\"http://cafecollege.org/ to Houston in the form of caf√©college Houston. Staffed by Project GRAD advisors, caf√©college Houston provides free college and career information in English and Spanish to anyone in the greater Houston area. Project GRAD has had more than 6,800 of its GRAD Scholars enroll in a community college or university and over 2,100 Scholars who have earned a certificate, associate degree or bachelor's degree.https://www.projectgradhouston.org/who-we-are/our-impact/ caf√©college Houston has welcomed over 10,000 visitors and GRAD has provided its services to more than 4,000 Houstonians.  New Model  In December 27, 2013, The Houston Chronicle reported that Project GRAD Houston phased out its local scholarship grants and pulled out staff from the Houston Independent School District. This is where the college preparatory program was founded more than two decades ago to assist financially needy students at problematic institutions. However, this model continued to be practiced in some areas which include Alaska, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. The non-profit organization maintained a hundred employees during its peak. The ISD also gave Project GRAD a subsidy of $5 million until the platform was scrutinized. The last fund grant worth $1.3 million for the Project came in during the 2011 ‚Äì 20112 school year. After this, the non-profit deemed it necessary to create a different model. Project GRAD uses its yearly budget ($4 million) for 18 employees and 23 AmeriCorps (voluntary civil society program that the US federal government supports) members in area non-profit offices as well as universities.

According to University of Warsaw language professor Dr hab. Marek ≈Åazi≈Ñski, the word had little negative association through the 1980s and into the 1990s; but as the Polish language evolved the word became less and less common and it's associations became more and more pejorative. In August 2020, Professor Marek ≈Åazi≈Ñski published an opinion at the Polish Language Council website arguing against its modern and public use and recommending that the word \\"Murzyn\\" not be used other than in historical quotes, noting that this is not yet the official stance of the council. The word roughly translates into English as either \\"black\\" or \\"negro\\".  Etymology  The word is derived from a Czech borrowing of the German Mohr,Aleksander Br√ºckner, S≈Çownik etymologiczny jƒôzyka polskiego, Wiedza Powszechna, Warsaw, 1993, , p.348. derived from Latin Maurus,\\"Mohr, Duden online similarly to the English word 'moor'.  Meaning and usage  In the Polish language, means somebody with black skin (a proper noun, uppercase spelling). The lowercase word (, a common noun) has several metaphoric and informal meanings. ' (feminine form: ', diminutive: ') can be translated into English as \\"black man\\". The standard nominative plural is Murzyni, which is using the \\"personal masculine\\" suffix, while the impersonal suffix (that is: Murzyny) is pejorative. However, the word \\"Murzyn\\" is often confused with the English word \\"Negro\\", without familiarising oneself with the fact that the socio-cultural roots of both words are significantly different. Comparing Polish \\"Murzyn\\" to English \\"Negro\\" without taking into account the word's neutral origins and non-racist historical background has caused the majority of the controversy over the word in recent years. In the opinion of Dr Marek ≈Åazi≈Ñski, it has also been associated with Shakespeare's 'noble' Othello, usually called a \\"moor\\" in English. According to ≈Åazi≈Ñski the word Murzyn in Polish is sometimes perceived as offensive, though many Poles would defend its use. In comparison, a direct translation of the English word \\"black\\", \\"czarny\\", does not seem better to him since it often carries negative connotations in Polish, though he feels it may eventually replace Murzyn due to the influence of foreign languages on Polish. ≈Åazi≈Ñski, writing in the language advice column of the Polish dictionary, suggests that in cases where an individual may perceive Murzyn to be offensive, geographic or national designations should be used. According to Marcin Mi≈Çkowski, writing in 2012, the word \\"previously considered neutral, is now all but banned in newspapers\\". According to philologist Gra≈ºyna Zarzycka, the word \\"'Murzyn', which in the opinion of many Poles, including academics, is not offensive, is seen by some black people as discriminatory and derogatory.\\"Gra≈ºyna Zarzycka, \\"Dyskurs prasowy o cudzoziemcach na podstawie tekst√≥w o ≈Å√≥dzkiej Wie≈ºy Babel i osobach czarnosk√≥rych\\", ≈Å√≥d≈∫, 2006, p. 143 For Antonina Kloskowska, meanwhile, writing in \\"Race\\", ethnicity and nation: international perspectives on social conflict, the word Murzyn \\"does not carry pejorative connotations. Moreover, the term \\"black\\", favoured in the English-speaking countries, which is translated into Polish as \\"czarny\\" (literally meaning \\"black\\"), is also seen as non-offensive, as this word describes a color (just like the Spanish \\"negro\\" literally meaning \\"black color\\"). Poland's first black Member of Parliament, John Godson, said in 2011 that the word was not offensive and that he was proud to be called a Murzyn.He also said he saw no problem in using the terms \\"Murzyn\\", \\"ciemnosk√≥ry\\" [\\"dark-skin\\"], \\"Afryka≈Ñczyk\\" [\\"African man\\"], or \\"Afropolak\\" [\\"Afro-Pole\\"]. \\"\\"Mo≈ºna m√≥wiƒá Murzyn, czarnosk√≥ry albo Afropolak\\"\\", tnv24, November 12, 2011 Later however, in 2020, he tweeted \\"The word has evolved. If the people in question do not wish to be called \\"murzyn\\" - please do not call them that\\". . Mamadou Diouf, a black Polish musician and representative of the Committee for the African Community (Komitet Spo≈Çeczno≈õci Afryka≈Ñskiej), criticised Godson for his use of the word. Diouf: \\"My≈õlƒô, ≈ºe pan pose≈Ç nie zna pochodzenia s≈Çowa, o kt√≥rym mowa\\" - \\"I think, that the MP doesn't know the etymology of the word\\". James Omolo in his 2018 book Strangers at the Gate. Black Poland argues that regardless the neutrality of the term \\"Murzyn\\", in the perception of Poles it is associated with inferiority.James Omolo, , 2018, Among of other usage examples he cites a 2014 scandal with foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski who reportedly said that Polish mentality suffers from \\"Murzy≈Ñsko≈õƒá\\" [\\"Murzynness\\"] adding \\"The problem in Poland is that we have very shallow pride and low self-esteem\\".\\"Report: Poland's Foreign Minister Blasts 'Worthless' U.S. Relationship\\", Time Magazine, June 22, 2014 A black Polish MP, Killion Munyama, used the expression sto lat za Murzynami [\\"100 years behind the Murzyns\\"] while speaking to Godson about the status of LGBT issues in Poland, characterising it as behind the times. Professor Marek ≈Åazi≈Ñski has published the following opinion about the usage of the word, at the website of the Polish Language Council (though it is stressed that this is not yet the official position of the Council): > \\"I emphasize that the word Murzyn was once neutral, or at least the best > possible, neutral and positive contexts of this noun can be found without > difficulty, and people who used it in the eighties or nineties have no > reason to feel guilty. However, words change associations and overtones in > the course of natural changes in social consciousness. Today, the word > Murzyn is not only burdened with bad associations, it is archaic. There are > several reasons for the gradual pejorativization of the noun Murzyn in > Polish. Firstly, in all the languages of the Western world (including > Polish), the basic names of black people during the era of slavery gave way > to newer names. These changes first occurred in English and French (the > languages of the societies most involved in the slave trade), later the > languages with the greatest numbers of black people, and then after in other > languages, albeit at different rates and degrees. Secondly, the word \\" > Murzyn\\" in Polish has acquired an exceptionally strong offensive > phraseology. Of course, the harmful phraseology also applies to other human > groups or nations, but the stereotyping of black people is unique in Polish > and incomparable to the situation in neighbouring languages. Phraseology > also strengthens the Murzyn-slave association. There is no guarantee that a > change of designation will stop the harmful phraseology, but it will > certainly make you wonder. Thirdly (in relation to the first and the > second): black and dark Poles, mostly from Africa in the first or second > generation, and the vast majority of black Americans living in Poland > temporarily treat this word as offensive. This is partly due to automatic > comparison with others and languages (the word Murzyn was translated for a > long time without commentary as Negro or n√®gre in Polish-English and Polish- > French dictionaries), and partly by constant experience of stereotyping due > to skin colour, and often racism. It is worth respecting the sensitivity of > the audience. Our neighbours with black skin prefer to be named on the basis > of a specific nationality (e.g. Senegalese , Nigerian), prefer to be > African, black, dark-skinned or simply black (although only a few decades > ago, the connotations of the adjective black in relation to a black man were > worse than the noun Murzyn). The submission of an Afropolak modelled on an > African-American is not typical for the Polish language. Fourth and most > important for a linguist: in many contexts the word Murzyn has been used > unnecessarily. It is determined not by nationality or geographical origin, > but by skin colour, and this feature, like hair colour, height, and type of > figure, does not have to be important in describing a person . The word > Murzyn in the subject of the sentence replaces the basic word man (Murzynka > replaces the word woman), it forces us to indicate a physical feature that > could remain unnamed if it were an adjective. It is easier to say simply a > man instead of a black man than to replace the word.\\" = In language = Cafe 'Murzynek' in Warsaw A saying sometimes used in Poland, Murzyn zrobi≈Ç swoje, Murzyn mo≈ºe odej≈õƒá, is actually a quote from the 1783 play Fiesco by German writer Friedrich Schiller (translated from the German as \\"The Moor has done his duty, the Moor can go\\"). The meaning of this phrase is: \\"once you've served your purpose, you're no longer needed\\". The lowercase word (, a common noun) may mean: # (informally) Somebody anonymously doing work for somebody else; # (informally) Somebody with a dark brown tan; # (informally) A hard working person forced to do hard labour. The English word \\"ghostwriter\\" can be translated informally in Polish as literacki Murzyn, in this case a \\"literary Negro\\". A murzynek in informal Polish can also mean a popular type of chocolate cake, or a portion of strong coffee.Murzynek, PWN A murzyn polski (\\"Polish murzyn\\") is a variety of black-billed pigeon.Murzyn polski, PWN A murzynka is also a type of strawberry with small, dark red fruit.

The use of the word \\"Murzynek\\" (a diminutive of Murzyn) was criticized by Polish-Senegalese Mamadou Diouf, who called for a boycott. Polish linguist Jerzy Bralczyk noted that the word \\"Murzyn\\" is not pejorative, but diminutives could be seen as such, if only because they are diminutives. The margarine producer, Bielmar, denied any racist views, and stated that the logo has been a distinctive part of the product for decades, abolishing it would result in a loss of the company's strongest brand, and the current rebranding with the diminutive (from \\"Palma\\" to \\"Palma z Murzynkiem\\") is simply a response to the common nickname of the product as used by the customers.http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114871,15684470,Kultowa_margaryna_z_Murzynkiem_oburza_Afrykanczykow.html Pod Murzynami (\\"Under the Murzyns\\") is also a not uncommon name for chemist's shops or tenement buildings in Poland.

In 1858, Gabri√´l introduced Anton Mauve to the area, who would return there ten years in a row and would become good friends with Gerard Bilders, the son of Johannes Warnardus. When Gabri√´l returned to Amsterdam to live, he had a hard time and moved to Brussels. There he was befriended by Willem Roelofs and benefited from Roelofs' social position in the art world of Brussels. There he met Hendrik Willem Mesdag, also a student of Roelofs. Gabri√´l was also influenced by the painters of the Barbizon School, whose works were regularly exhibited in Brussels. Helped by Roelofs' suggestions, he developed into a good landscape painter, with a clear palette. Gabri√´l's paintings stand out from the 'grey tones' for which the Hague School was famous because of his clear use of color. His work was less an impression of atmosphere than a consequence of the immediate effect of the sunny Dutch landscape. The more he looked at the Dutch landscape, the more color he perceived in it. He described the Dutch countryside as 'colorful, juicy, fat' and said 'Our land is not grey, even when the weather is grey.' From 1862 onwards, Gabriel regularly embarked on study trips to the Netherlands: first to Arnhem and Oosterbeek, in 1866 to Veenendaal, in the seventies to Abcoude and Vreeland, and from 1875 to the lakes around Nieuwkoop near Noorden. Around 1880, he spent the summers in Kortenhoef,See also Carole Denninger-Schreuder, page 15 - 35. on Kampereiland and in Giethoorn. He visited the places in Overijssel with Willem Bastiaan Tholen. But it was only in 1864 that Gabriel would permanently return to the Netherlands. At that time he moved to Scheveningen, where he bought a house next to his student Geesje Mesdag-van Calcar. Together they painted still lifes with flowers. In this period he often painted the brook near Voorschoten, as well as in Broeksloot (1886), Oosterbeek (c. 1887), Kinderdijk and Heeze. In 1886, he stayed with the Mesdags at their home in Vries in Drente, where he made studies of the fields, barns and farms. In this period Gabriel also received recognition in the Netherlands. Museums purchased some of his important pieces, including 'The Pottery in Kampen', purchased by the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag in 1890. In Kortenhoef one of his pupils was Bernard van Beek.See also Carole Denninger- Schreuder, pp. 78‚Äì79. Gabriel died 23 August 1903 in his home in Scheveningen.

During British India, the Bengali language was imposed over Assamese as the British took over Assam. The clerical and technical workers that they brought were Bengali, allegedly in order to impose Bengali as the medium of instruction in schools and colleges, and for all official purposes. Nathan Brown, an American Baptist missionary to India, aimed at restoring the Assamese language to avoid it being completely overtaken by the Bengali language. In order to restore the Assamese Language, he took the matter to the British India administration of the time. Eliza Brown, Nathan's wife, was his partner in this mission.  History  With the British annexation of Assam into the Bengal Presidency in 1826 as a result of the Treaty of Yandabo, the prominent Ahom kingdom lost its independence and came under a new regime of foreign domination known as the British Raj. Thus Assam came under the Bengal Administration until 1873. On February 6, 1874, it was made a Chief Commissioner's province, also known as the 'North-East Frontier'. The new Commissioner-ship comprised the five districts of Assam, Khasi-Jaintia Hills, Garo Hills, Naga Hills, and a major portion of the Bengali speaking areas of Goalpara and Sylhet-Cachar; but leaving out Cooch Behar, a prominent part of Assam. The viceroy Curzon‚Äôs Plan of Partition of Bengal (1905), facilitated immigration from across the Bengal border to Assam. In April 1836, Persian was replaced by Bengali, as the Court language of Assam on the ground that it was very difficult and costly to replace Persian scribes who were on leave or who left the service. The services of the Bengalis then became essential in the Anglo-vernacular and vernacular schools, since school teachers were not available in adequate numbers to impart lessons in the Bengali language. In 1837 the Act of XXIX,1837 was passed by the President of the Council of India, which gave the governor-general the power to dispense with any regulations of the Bengal Code requiring the use of Persian for judicial and revenue proceedings and to prescribe any other language and script as a replacement.  Reaction to the imposition  The imposition of Bengali as the language of the court and educational institutions exasperated the Assamese intelligentsia and common society of Assam. As a result of this language imposition, the progress of education in Assam remained slow and deficient. Many Bengalis were brought in and employed in the schools of Assam. There was no encouragement for the writing of school text books in Assamese, and Assamese literature suffered. This was thought to be one of the core factors behind the community conflicts that emerged between the Assamese and Bengali communities in the following decades. Initially the imposition did not meet with any kind of protest. Rather, the Assamese elite used the language in their writings, and even in conversation, and the language policy of the government went unquestioned for almost a decade. The recruitment of Bengalis to government services increased abruptly, leading to greater unemployment among the Assamese. The increased number of Bengali 'Amlas' in the districts of Assam was thought to be posing a challenge to the distinct identities of the People of Assam, because these immigrants had their own culture, language, and traditions, and their existence in the land was perceived as having an effect on Assam‚Äôs language, culture, economy, and political status. Early protests came from the American Baptist Missionaries and the educated Assamese elite section, against the language policy of the government. After realizing the need of vernacular medium to spread Christianity, the missionaries espoused the cause of the Assamese as the rightful medium of instruction in the state. In 1839, William Robinson, an inspector of schools, wrote \\"Grammar of the Assamese Language\\". Apart from printing religious materials in Assamese, the missionaries made pleas in defense of the Assamese language through the publication of Orunodoi in 1846. Primarily intended for the propagation of Christianity, the Orunodoi, which was published for two decades, contained informative knowledge of science, history, geography and certain regional and national news and views. It is considered to have inspired the younger generation of the Assamese society, to stand up for the cause of the Assamese language. The efforts of the missionaries in establishing a separate identity of the Assamese language, were notable and they received support from the Assamese intelligentsia, followed by a number of petitions and memoranda to the government. The continuous attempts of the Baptist Missionaries and men like Hemchandra Barua, Gunabhiram Barua and Anandaram Dhekial Phukan helped restore Assamese as a language of instruction in the state.  Negotiations  In February 1874, the government revised its earlier language policy and the Commissioner stated that in the primary schools, Assamese rather than Bengali should be the sole medium of instruction. This decision made the Assamese suspect that it was a ploy by the Bengalis to supplant Assamese. Despite the Chief Commissioner‚Äôs assurance that Assamese would not be supplanted, Bengali continued to be the medium in the middle grades until the late 19th century. Vigorous protests were made by the Assamese people against the implementation of Bengali as a medium in the middle and high schools of Assam. On March 28, 1903, the Chief Commissioner stated that students in the Assamese-speaking district of Kamrup were to be taught in Assamese. But the non-availability of Assamese texts stood in the way of implementation. A member of the Assamese elite, Manik Chandra Baruah, made a statement to the Deputy Commissioner of Kamrup that, as the district was never a part of Bengal, and Gauhati was essentially an Assamese town, the medium of instruction in the high schools there must be Assamese. The establishment of Cotton University and Earle Law College can be attributed to the efforts of Manik Chandra Baruah. While accepting the cogency of Baruah‚Äôs argument, P.G. Melitus, the Commissioner of the Assam valley, pointed out that, at the request of the parents of the Bengali students, arrangements should be made in Gauhati to provide instruction through Bengali. Although Mellitus was willing to agree to the demands of the Bengali community, the Commissioner felt that, owing to their closer ties with the community and the people of Bengal than to the Assamese, schools in Goalpara must teach through the medium of Bengali. In his concluding note, however, Mellitus stated that the imparting of education in Assamese instead of in Bengali was being done at the cost of efficiency. These factors were thought to be the foundations of the Official Language Movement of 1960 and the subsequent Medium of Instruction Movement of 1972.. Muzammil Haque was the first martyr of the Medium of Instruction Movement or Madhyam Movement of Assam.

While the Mughal Emperor Akbar was on his campaign to subdue the Rajputs, he set up camp at a water Qanat and established camp around that fresh water reservoir in order to properly manage his forces in the nearby regions. Occupation After staying at the Qanat for weeks during the scorching summer heat, Akbar and the Mughals encountered a very large group of Sanyasis, who was gathered to take holy dip on the banks of the ancient water pond (sarovar) or Qanat. The ascetics approached and entered the Mughal camp with complete disregard for the Mughal military standard and red tents symbolizing the Emperor himself. Akbar was generally displeased at their arrival because he was gathering his armies, building morale, and preparing for his next campaign against Udai Singh. However the main intentions of the Sanyasi group was to drink and bathe in the Qanat, which they considered \\"Holy\\". As the summer afternoon began to scorch another group of Sanyasis arrived and they began to gather in their hundreds and thousands around the sarovar or Qanat. Outraged by their presence and intrusion, Abdul Hasan Asaf Khan advised the Mughal Emperor Akbar to take action. The Mughals were waiting for an opportunity to drive the priests out of their encampment, but Akbar believed that they would leave by sunset. Battle Mughals slay the Sannyasis at Thanesar, Akbarnama The Mughal Emperor Akbar, continued to concede the Qanat to the Sanyasis and carefully observed their actions. As the \\"first\\" large group of priests bathed and drank from the holy Sarovar, a \\"second\\" group of priests also began to arrive in their hundreds. It was due to the arrival of the second group that tensions ignited among the two large groups, that eventually culminated in a brawl inside the sarovar and almost immediately the two rival groups of Sanyasis began to stab each other using Kitars. Concerned that the violence might spread into the Mughal encampment, the Mughal Emperor Akbar ordered almost 250 of his men to immediately retake the sarovar from the schismatic priests. The Mughals armed with Talwars, piked-shields, matchlocks, and composite bows and arrows, ferociously overwhelmed the ranks of priests ultimately driving them away from the sarovar according to their jurisdiction, which justified the usage of force.https://3086150802460984893-a-1802744773732722657-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/airavat/Akbar_massacre_sannyasis.jpg?attachauth=ANoY7crJZ0rVpUFmpDq9RpuYxrECmEGmF7RN2H0caXQzbf9IoGggb2QUkfCd9svO_JL93Ta8OZR7KOWxQy4uEJezgz_JEGn- vOpMsXwdZXZUBuc_m8DbFn93HK1ZcDpbYzwuDVh7M7nVdAoFp644w7y_h2qNpyVl_l4rCx6OzLzWRLd8N40h91Rk8ntOvQh- luA3zaTQLk3kJ2Rxy325OUlUiGG8GhyLcg%3D%3D&attredirects;=0 Aftermath The Mughal Emperor Akbar continued to command his campaign from Thanesar, and within the coming months the Mughals organized the well documented Siege of Chittorgarh against the forces of the Rana Udai Singh II at Chittor Fort.

It is a parish church and the seat of the Diocese of Fargo. History St. Mary's parish was founded in 1880. What would become the Diocese of Fargo was established nine years later as the Diocese of Jamestown, and at the time it encompassed the entire state of North Dakota. St. James Church in Jamestown became the cathedral. The diocese's first bishop, John Shanley, moved his residence to the Island Park area of Fargo in 1891. The Holy See changed the name of the diocese to Fargo in 1897. Bishop Shanley purchased property for a new cathedral and had plans drawn up. The basement was completed when a fire destroyed most of downtown Fargo in 1893. Shanley donated a large portion of the funds that he had personally raised for the new cathedral to reconstruct the city after the fire. Construction on the cathedral was, therefore, delayed. St. Mary's Cathedral was completed and it was dedicated on May 30, 1899. Architecture St. Paul, Minnesota architect Edward P. Bassford designed the present church building in the Romanesque Revival style. The brick structure follows a basilica plan with a rounded apse. Its six bays are divided by buttresses. The main facade features two uneven towers. The larger of the two towers rises above the ground, and it contains a single bell. A statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary is located in the smaller tower.

A regular participant in the Brera exhibitions, he attained full recognition with participation in the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London and the Universal Exhibition of 1855 in Paris. Allegorical interpretations of the ideals of the struggle for national liberation known as the Risorgimento gave way in the 1850s to the production of openly patriotic works.

He was viewed as a Messiah and Prophet by his followers. His death in battle signified the end of the uprising. He is buried in Amasya. Biography ≈ûahkulu was a member of the Turkmen Tekkelu tribe. Being inspired by Safavid missionaries, the Turkmens living on Ottoman soil, \\"as far west as Konya\\", were mobilized in a \\"fervent messianic movement\\", led by ≈ûahkulu. ≈ûahkulu and his followers tried to \\"replicate\\" the same type of revolt led by Ismail I several years earlier, \\"perhaps in anticipation of a union with the Safavids\\". ≈ûahkulu also worked as the chief of the Royal Ottoman Company of Designers in Istanbul in early 16th century. ≈ûahkulu was killed in 1511, and the pro-Safavid movement was \\"halted temporarily\\". But the anxiety of the Ottomans, in relation to \\"losing much of their Asian possessions was not eased\\". Nor did the hatred of the Ottomans for Ismail I cease to exist, even though Ismail apologized for the atrocities caused by the Turkmens and \\"disowned\\" ≈ûahkulu. As the possibility existed of a \\"mass Turkmen exodus into the Safavid realm\\", Bayezid II sought to establish good relations with Ismail, \\"at least on the surface, and welcomed Ismail's gestures to establish good neighborly relations\\". In letters sent to Ismail, Bayezid II addressed Ismail as \\"heir to the kingdom of Kaykhosrow ‚Äì the legendary great king of the Shahnameh ‚Äì and to Dara (Darius) of the ancient Persian Empire\\". Abbas Amanat adds: \\"He further advised Ismail to behave royally, preserve his precious and strategically vital kingdom with justice and equanimity, end forced conversions, and leave in peace with his neighbors\\". Bayezid II had faced a revolt from his own son Selim (who succeeded as Selim I), in the final years of his rule. Unlike his father, Selim, then still a prince, disliked his father's appeasement policies vis-a-vis the Safavids. When Selim I thus ascended the throne in 1512, things changed drastically. Tensions rose, which eventually led to the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514.

In 1887, he exhibited successfully at the Esposizione di Venezia; and in 1891, he displayed the paintings Pescatori, Silenzio, Sera, Laguna, Case di pescatori in Milan.La Biennale di Venezia, Volume 2, by Esposizione biennale internazionale d'arte, Biennale di Venezia (1897), page 110. In 1889, he won a bronze medal at the Universal Exhibition of 1889 in Paris and took part in the Munich International Exhibition of the same year, as well as later editions.Laura Casone, In 1895, his canvas Tristezza (Sadness) won awards in Venice, and again the next year, this time in Berlin.Biennale of Venice biography He drew mainly seascapes and cityscapes of Venice, often at night, a thematic also pursued by Mario de Maria. By the turn of the century, his style had acquired Symbolist overtones devoid of a realistic locale. He won the Prince Umberto Prize at the Milan Triennale of 1891 and was a regular participant from 1895 to 1922 at the Venice Biennale, which displayed a solo show of his work in 1910 and a posthumous retrospective in 1924.

The transmission mode is intended as a further improvement of the efficiency of the enhanced Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (eMBMS) service, which can deliver services such as mobile TV using the LTE infrastructure, and is expected to compete with dedicated mobile/handheld TV broadcast systems such as DVB-H and DVB-SH. This enables network operators to offer mobile TV without the need for additional expensive licensed spectrum and without requiring new infrastructure and end- user devices. The eMBMS service can offer many more TV programs in a specific radio frequency spectrum as compared to traditional terrestrial TV broadcasting, since it is based on the principles of Interactive Multicast, where TV content only is transmitted in where there currently are viewers. The eMBMS service also provides better system spectral efficiency than video-on- demand over traditional cellular unicasting services, since in eMBMS, each TV program is only transmitted once in each cell, even if there are several viewers of that program in the same cell. The MBSFN transmission mode further improves the spectral efficiency, since it is based on the principles of Dynamic single frequency networks (DSFN). This implies that it dynamically forms single-frequency networks (SFNs), i.e. groups of adjacent base stations that send the same signal simultaneously on the same frequency sub-carriers, when there are mobile TV viewers of the same TV program content in the adjacent cells. The LTE OFDMA downlink modulation and multiple access scheme eliminates self-interference caused by the SFN:s. Efficient TV transmission using similar combinations of Interactive multicast (IP Multicast) and DSFN has also been suggested for the DVB-T2 and DVB-H systems.M. Eriksson, S.M. Hasibur Rahman, F. Fraille, M. Sj√∂str√∂m, ‚ÄùEfficient Interactive Multicast over DVB-T2 - Utilizing Dynamic SFNs and PARPS‚Äù, 2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (BMSB‚Äô13), London, UK, June 2013. MBMS and mobile TV was a failure in 3G systems, and was offered by very few mobile operators, partly because of its limited peak bit rates and capacity, not allowing standard TV video quality, something that LTE with eMBMS does not suffer from. Technical details LTE's Enhanced Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services (E-MBMS) provides transport features for sending the same content information to all the users in a cell (broadcast) or to a given set of users (subscribers) in a cell (multicast) using a subset of the available radio resources with the remaining available to support transmissions towards a particular user (so-called unicast services). It must not be confused with IP-level broadcast or multicast, which offer no sharing of resources on the radio access level. In E-MBMS it is possible to either use a single eNode-B or multiple eNode-Bs for transmission to multiple UEs. MBSFN is the definition for the latter. MBSFN is a transmission mode which exploits LTE's OFDM radio interface to send multicast or broadcast data as a multicell transmission over a synchronized single-frequency network (SFN). The transmissions from the multiple cells are sufficiently tightly synchronized for each to arrive at the UE within the OFDM Cyclic Prefix (CP) so as to avoid Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI). In effect, this makes the MBSFN transmission appear to a UE as a transmission from a single large cell, dramatically increasing the Signal-to- Interference Ratio (SIR) due to the absence of inter-cell interference. Commercial adoption Commercial deployment of E-MBMS (and therefore MBSFN) features is expected to start in 2013 as an upgrade of existing LTE networks. Lowell McAdam, CEO of Verizon, stated in his CES 2013 keynote that he hopes to have LTE-Broadcast available to live-broadcast the Super Bowl 2014 over its network. On a more general note, he identified live events as the ideal use case for LTE-Broadcast.

The present structure dates from 1243 but underwent a major renovation designed by Gherardo Silvani in 1630. Today it is affiliated with the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.Archdiocese of Florence. Chiesa dei Santi Simone e Giuda History The church began its life in 1192 as a small oratory situated outside the city walls in vineyards owned by the monks of the Badia Fiorentina. It was enlarged in 1209 and then completely re-built in 1243. The new building was consecrated in 1247 by Bishop and was designated a parish church. It was badly damaged when the Arno flooded in 1527. Amongst the damage was the loss of the ciborium which had been made of wood and was completely washed away. Serious renovation of the church did not begin until the first quarter of the 17th century when the archbishop of Florence, Alessandro Marzi Medici, elevated its status to a priory and named Giovanni Niccolai as its first prior in 1608, a post he held until his death in 1642. Niccolai came from a wealthy and cultured Tuscan family and initiated the renovation of the church. By 1619 a new high altar made of Carrara marble was added and the choir stalls and presbytery were completely renovated under the patronage of Bartolomeo Galilei, a relative of Galileo. The next stage of the renovation began in 1630. It was designed by Gherardo Silvani and paid for by the nephew of Bartolomeo. Also called Bartoleomeo Galilei, he was a Knight of Malta and steward to Leopoldo de' Medici. The final stage of Silvani's renovation (a richly decorated ceiling) was completed in 1665. The church contains numerous emblems of both the Galilei family and the Knights of Malta.

Biography Hawkins was born in Saline County, Missouri to George Scott and Francis Marion (Gauldin) Hawkins on January 4, 1855. He was educated in public schools before enrolling at William Jewell College and the University of Missouri. Upon completion of education in 1877, Hawkins began reading law under Glasgow, Missouri attorney Thomas Shackelford. He was admitted to the Missouri bar in 1878 and practiced law with Shackelford for the next five years. In 1883, Hawkins moved to Prescott, Arizona Territory. He was made probate judge for Yavapai County in 1885. That same year he formed a legal practice with J. C. Herndon which lasted until 1893. On May 5, 1855, Hawkins married Olive Birch of Glasgow, Missouri. The marriage produced one daughter. Hawkins was appointed Territorial Auditor in 1887. The Democratic Hawkins held the position till March 1889 when he was replaced by an incoming Republican governor. In 1892, Hawkins was elected to represent Yavapai County on the Council of the 17th Arizona Territorial Legislature. President Grover Cleveland nominated Hawkins to replace Edmund W. Wells in Arizona's fourth judicial district in April 1893. During his time on the bench, procedural issues were common. Two examples of his rulings in such manners are Thomas v. Lane, 4 Arizona 156 (1894), where the judge rules that when counsel claims an error in a case they should also specify what they believed the error to be and United States v. Falshaw, 4 Arizona 330 (1895), when he ruled the United States was required to pay witness expenses on behalf of indigent defendants. At the end of his four-year term, Hawkins was not reappointed and was succeeded by Richard Elihu Sloan on July 21, 1897. Following his time on the bench, Hawkins returned to his private legal practice. In addition to his legal career he was an active member of the Episcopal Church, serving once as Chancellor of the denomination's territorial mission board and two times as a Lay Delegate to the General Convention. Hawkins was also a member of Prescott's Masonic Lodge. Hawkins served as President of the territorial bar association from 1900 till 1901. In 1904 he was a delegate to Universal Congress of Lawyers and Jurists. Following Arizona gaining statehood, in 1914, Hawkins ran for one of three open seats on the Arizona Supreme Court but failed to gain one with his fourth-place finish. The following year he taught mining law at the University of Oklahoma College of Law. Hawkings retired to Los Angeles, California in 1916. He lived there till his death on May 1, 1935. Hawkins was buried in Glendale, California's Forest Lawn Memorial Park.

The regulation was launched by Telecom minister of India Kapil Sibal which enables people across India to respite from pesky marketing calls and SMS.  Background  The Indian telecom Industry with nearly 900 million subscribers is the second largest wireless market in the world. Low tariffs and direct reach to consumers has made SMS and direct calling one of the most cost effective ways of selling services and products. However, telemarketing has become a major irritant to customers over few years.  Regulation  *Subscribers can opt for ‚Äòfully blocked' category where all commercial calls/SMS will be blocked, he/she may also opt for ‚Äòpartially blocked' category to receive various promotional SMS. *Hefty penalty of up to on erring telemarketing companies and blacklisting of habitual offenders. *No commercial communication, even for unregistered customers, shall be sent between 9.00 p.m. and 9.00 a.m., so that customers are not disturbed at night. = 200 SMS a day = To make it difficult to broadcast millions of SMSs in a day, restriction on more than 100 SMS per SIM per day were introduced. TRAI directed all access providers to exclude the following persons from the limit of one hundred SMS per day per SIM. The exceptions include: *No limitation of number of SMS's of festival days per SIM *Dealers of telecom operators *e-Ticketing agencies *Social networking sites However, 100 SMS a day plan proved to be disastrous for text addicts wring hands. According to a survey conducted by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, around 60% of the country's urban youth send/receive around 100-125 text messages daily to interact with their peer group. College students were hard hit by the new norms as they are the biggest users of the SMS as they are available at low cost tariffs. Owing to certain representations by service providers and consumers to increase the limit of 100 SMSes, TRAI had later decided to increase the limit of 100 SMSes per day per sim to 200 SMSes per day per Sim. In July 2012, the Delhi High Court removed the ban on the SMS limit of 200 per day per sim, as it felt that the restriction infringed the constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression. = Freedom from disturbing calls = *All telemarketing calls will start with 140, to identify the call‚Äôs origin *Telemarketing calls and SMSes will be barred from 9 pm to 9 am for everyone *Customers can block such calls fully or partially by calling up 1909 *Telecom firms will act against violation within 7 days of the compliant and inform the complainant = Penalties for telemarketers = * for the first offence by telemarketer * for the second violation * for the third violation * lakh for the fourth violation * lakh for the fifth violation * for the sixth violation, after which the telemarketer‚Äôs number will be blocked = Penalties for telecom firms = *Rs 10 lakh fine on service providers that violate mobile users ‚ÄòDo Not Call‚Äô instructions for four times  See also  * Telecommunications in India  References  Category:Telecommunications policy Category:Telecommunications in India ","title":"The Telecom Commercial Communication Customer Preference Regulations, 2010"},{"id":"33230712","text":"The Finlayson church The Finlayson Church is a church built in Gothic Revival style located in the Finlayson industrial area in Tampere, Finland. It was built in 1879 as the church of the Finlayson cotton factory, where the factory workers could practice religion. Currently the church belongs to the Evangelical-Lutheran congregations of Tampere, and it is used as a children's road church and a popular church for weddings. History The church was built for the use of the Finlayson factory workers in 1879. It was built primarily as a place to practice religion, but the first working day of the year was started with a service there right until the 1970s. The Finlayson factory workers founded their own congregation from 1846 to 1860. The factory had its own priest, a factory preacher right until 1982. The factory gave the church away and the lot it stands on for free to the Evangelist-Lutheran congregation in Tampere in 1981. A condition for the transfer was that the church must continue to be called the Finlayson Church. Architecture Commemorative plaques for war dead on the wall of the Finlayson church. The church was designed by the city architect of Tampere at the time, Frans Ludvig Calonius. The material for the church's facade is clean red brick. It resembles an English congregationalist church in that the preaching chair and the organ are unusually located behind the altar. The church also has no kind of altar table or sculpture whatsoever. The church used to have benches stretching the full width of its hallway, but these were later separated into two parts by a corridor in the middle. The church's organ was built by the company William Hill & Son in the 1850, and they were brought to the church from St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1879. The church was repaired from September 2007 to late summer 2008. The plank floor was replaced with a plate floor. The church's colour was also changed to a darker shade. Current activity The church is currently owned by the Evangelist-Lutheran congregation of Tampere. The church seats 280 people. The Finlayson Church is used as the only children's church in Finland. The children's altars have a Children's Bible, and next to it are installations depicting various biblical events. As the church was built as a prayer room, it does not hold a regular Sunday service. Because of its central location, small size and pleasant architecture, the church is one of the most popular wedding churches in Tampere.

Geography  Mount Musin√® (in the background) seen from Monte Casto (Pennine Alps, BI) Mount Musin√® is the easternmost mountain of the long ridge which, starting from Rocciamelone, divides the valleys of Susa and Lanzo. Its main summit has a subsummit called Truc dell'Eremita (Hermit's hill, 1.101 m), and is surrounded by several minor hills. To the east on a 535 m high hill stands Saint Abaco's sanctuary, and to the northeast on Monte Calvo, 551 m high, there is a Via Crucis leading to a chapel. Mount Musin√® is connected to the neighbouring Mount Curto (1.323 m) by a broad wooded ridge, the lowest point of which is the Colle della Bassetta (Bassetta's pass, 945 m).

Egenberger and Louis Royer at the Amsterdam Academie.David Adolph Constant Artz in the RKD There he met Jozef Isra√´ls, whose fishing subjects were to be a lasting source of inspiration for Artz. He worked with Isra√´ls in Zandvoort in 1859. Unlike Isra√´ls, however, Artz depicted only the more cheerful sides of the fisherman's life. From 1855-1864 he was a member of the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten in Amsterdam. Technically, he distinguished himself from Isra√´ls in his use of sharp outlines and bright colour. Between 1866 and 1874 Artz stayed in Paris where he set up his own studio at the suggestion of Courbet. In Paris he maintained close contacts with his colleagues Jacob Maris and Frederik Hendrik Kaemmerer as well as the art dealer Goupil & Cie. During this period Artz produced mainly fashionable genre scenes and a number of Japanese subjects. His control over line and colour became more powerful. In 1874 he returned to The Hague where he was a member of the Hollandsche Teekenmaatschappij and in 1879 he was awarded the Order of the Oak Crown by William III of the Netherlands.

Biography Pearl was born in Denver to J. H. and Elizabeth Tipton Heats Gildersleeve. She was a descendant of settlers who had migrated to Colorado after the Civil War. As a young girl she studied the violin, and later became interested in the piano. She later attended University of Denver.New York Times obituary, April 17, 1941 She also studied with Otto Pfeffercorn, Flora Smith Hunsicker and Martha Miner. She settled in Larchmont, New York, and married Hugh Grosvenor Curran, a manufacturer in New York city. She was a member of ASCAP, the Pen Women‚Äôs Society and the Westchester County Music Festival Association. Music In 1912, she published Five Love Songs, and in the years that followed she wrote both the text and music to over 40 songs. Many important singers of the first half of the 20th century performed her works, including Enrico Caruso, Anna Case, and John Charles Thomas. Victor Records recorded three of her songs in the 1920s. Caruso premiered her song Life, and it was the only American composition on the choral program at the 1934 music festival in Budapest. Her song Sonny Boy was transcribed into Braille for the blind during her lifetime, indicating its popularity at the time. Her grandchildren, Patricia, Nancy, and Winfred B. Holton III inspired several of her songs, including In My Looking-Glass. At the end of her life, she developed the nationally broadcast radio program A Half Hour with Pearl Curran, for which she provided piano accompaniments to some of her most popular melodies. She was adept at conveying the mood of the text with melody and accompaniment, ranging from the \\"serene love song\\" NocturneCarman et al, p. 91 and the \\"introspective\\" song Evening, to the more animated and descriptive song Rain, with short and repeated notes in the piano representing a rainy day. However, author Victoria Villamil accurately describes the dichotomy in her songs: \\"Unquestionably the greatest detriment to her work was her insistence on setting her own simplistic, old-fashioned texts. Otherwise, her songs are imaginative, melodious, and well crafted. Despite their naivet√©, they can also be surprisingly elaborate and expansive.\\"Villamil, p. 123 Musical compositions All published by G.

Biography The son of a silk merchant from Lyon, Gignous displayed a precocious talent for painting and enrolled at the Brera Academy of Fine Arts in 1864, attending the courses on landscape taught by Luigi Riccardi and then Gaetano Fasanotti. He came into contact with the Milanese Scapigliatura movement when still very young and formed a close friendship with Tranquillo Cremona. He began to focus exclusively on landscape in the 1870s, experimenting with painting en plein air and producing views of the Lombard and Piedmontese countryside that he showed at all the major national exhibitions. The late 1870s saw a more naturalistic approach to landscape painting under the influence of Francesco Filippini and Filippo Carcano, with whom Gignous went to paint on Lake Maggiore in 1879, thus inaugurating a thematic repertoire devoted primarily to views of the Verbano, Mottarone and Val d‚ÄôOssola. Some biographical notes written by the artist‚Äôs wife Matilde would appear to bear out the hypothesis of a trip to Paris in the company of Carcano in 1878 and attest to friendship with Vincenzo Vela, who was apparently his host on numerous occasions in Ligornetto. A recognised leader of the Lombard school of painting, he lived in Stresa (Verbania) and on the coast of Liguria from 1887 to 1906, with long stays in Venice. He died in 1906 in Stresa. The Venice Biennale held a retrospective exhibition of his work in 1907.

The earliest evidence of Tamil is Tamil loanwords in Biblical Hebrew dated anywhere from the 10th century BCE to 5th century BCE. The earliest records in Old Tamil are inscriptions from between the 3rd and 2nd century BCE in caves and on pottery. These inscriptions are written in a variant of the Brahmi script called Tamil Brahmi. The earliest long text in Old Tamil is the TolkƒÅppiyam, an early work on Tamil grammar and poetics, whose oldest layers could be as old as the mid 2nd century BCE. Many literary works in Old Tamil have also survived. These include a corpus of 2,381 poems collectively known as Sangam literature. These poems are usually dated to between the 1st century BCE and 5th centuries CE,The dating of Sangam literature and the identification of its language with Old Tamil have recently been questioned by Herman Tieken who argues that the works are better understood as 9th century PƒÅ·πá·π≠iyan dynasty compositions, deliberately written in an archaising style to make them seem older than they were (). Tieken's dating has, however, been criticised by reviewers of his work. See e.g.  *which makes them the oldest extant body of secular literature in India. Other literary works in Old Tamil include Thirukural, Silappatikaram and Ma·πáimƒìkalai, and a number of ethical and didactic texts, written between the 5th and 8th centuries. Old Tamil preserved many features of Proto-Dravidian, including inventory of consonants, the syllable structure, and various grammatical features. Amongst these was the absence of a distinct present tense ‚Äì like Proto-Dravidian, Old Tamil only had two tenses, the past and the \\"non-past\\". Old Tamil verbs also had a distinct negative conjugation (e.g. ' [kaÀê…≥eÀên] ) \\"I do not see\\", ' [kaÀê…≥oÀêm]( \\"we do not see\\") Nouns could take pronominal suffixes like verbs to express ideas: e.g. ' [pe…≥ ài…ΩeÀêm] ) \\"we are women\\" formed from ' [pe…≥ ài…Ω] ) \\"women\\" and the first person plural marker - (). Despite the significant amount of grammatical and syntactical change between Old, Middle and Modern Tamil, Tamil demonstrates grammatical continuity across these stages: many characteristics of the later stages of the language have their roots in features of Old Tamil.

Violeta Went to Heaven () is a 2011 Chilean biopic about singer and folklorist Violeta Parra, directed by Andr√©s Wood. The film is based on a biography by √Ångel Parra, Violeta's son with Luis Cereceda Arenas. He collaborated on the film. The film was selected as the Chilean entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist. It was awarded the World Cinema Jury Prize (Dramatic) at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. Plot The film depicts Violeta del Carmen Parra Sandoval's road to becoming considered one of Chile's greatest folklorists and artists. It chronicles her guitar playing at a very young age, the ambience of her musician father's haunts, and the rural settings of southern Chile in the √ëuble Province. The film follows Parra in her project of studying Chilean folk music in order to preserve and carry forward in an original way traditional composition styles to form the genre now known as Nueva Canci√≥n Chilena (English: New Chilean music). It shows her seeking out old musicians and asking them to sing or strum the songs they knew. It covers her invitations abroad to Warsaw, Poland and Paris, France. During this trip Parra also travelled through the Soviet Union and parts of Europe. The movie also portrays the events in Chile leading up to the tragic death of her baby daughter Rosita during her absence. The film covers her tumultuous relationship with Swiss flautist, Gilbert Favre whom she met when he accompanied an anthropologist specializing in Chilean folklore to Chile. It follows the diversification of her artistic output, including her oil painting, and mixed media tapestry called arpilleras or Hessian (cloth). The film follows Parra and Favre's stay in Geneva and Paris, portraying her visit to Mus√©e du Louvre, which resulted in the honor of being the first Latin American woman to have a solo exhibition there. Upon their return to South America, Favre and Parra broke up, provoked by his desire to live in Bolivia where he was part of a successful Bolivian music act, Los Jairas. Parra's energy was invested in reviving a unique version of a Pe√±a, a community center for the arts and political activism. Parra's Pe√±a was a tent (somewhat similar looking to a circus tent) that she set up on a 30 x 30 meter piece of land in the Parque La Quintrala, in today's La Reina municipality of Santiago, in the area once known as la Ca√±ada. Her tent hosted musical spectacles and she and her children also lived on the same land. The movie chronicles her dealings with the mayor of the area at the time, Fernando Castillo Velasco, who helped her establish the site. Favre returns with his group, but declines to stay, although a once proud Parra humbly begs him to, because in the meantime he had established a life and married in Bolivia. The film depicts the alternating atmosphere of the tent, at times, lively with artists during the day, and music and political activism at night. Parra was the hostess, cooking beans over an open fire to share, and participating with the other artists. At other times, however, the tent was desolate, or it was too rainy and cold to be hospitable, and Parra suffered from poverty and loneliness. The film concludes with Parra's suicide, on 5 February 1967.

It was located high on the east slope of the Sierra Nevada, west of present-day town of Independence, California. The mining camp was in the Kearsarge Mining District, located just below the high granite Kearsarge Peak, and east of the Kearsarge Pass. History Kearsarge was named after the Union man-of-war , which had recently sunk the Confederate ship off the coast of France.

Kearsarge Mining Company, 1871 In the Autumn of 1864, on the side of a then-unnamed mountain, five woodcutters discovered a vein of rich silver and gold ore. The men staked their claims to Kearsarge, Silver Sprout, and Virginia Mines. They mined and shipped four tons of ore to a stamp mill in Nevada, receiving $900 a ton. The news of location of their mine leaked out, and the Kearsarge Mining District, and eponymous mining camp below the mines, was established high in the Eastern Sierra. Several mine investors purchased the three main silver claims, forming the Kearsarge Mining Company. These new owners had driven a tunnel into the southeast side of the mountain by August 1865, reaching $650+ per ton ore. After a winter of heavy snow, on the afternoon of March 1, 1866, an avalanche swept away most of the town and some of the population, killing the wife of the mine foreman and injuring several men.

Those are sent to their local Houses of Night, private schools directed by vampyres, specialized in helping the adolescents, called fledglings, survive the Change. Young fledgling Zoey is unusual: unlike other normal fledglings, she bears a filled mark, a sign that the goddess of vampyres, Nyx, has bestowed a great destiny onto her, but she also has to deal with normal high school girl issues:school, boyfriends and the evil popular girl waiting just around the corner. The book has been translated into more than 20 languages including French, Spanish, German and Chinese. Plot Sixteen-year-old Zoey Redbird lives in a world where vampires, or \\"vampyres\\" have always existed. One day, during school, Zoey is marked by a Tracker to become a fledgling vampyre at the Tulsa House of Night, a boarding school where she will be trained to become an adult vampyre. She gets stopped outside in the parking lot by her boyfriend Heath, and his friends who call her a freak and drive away. Zoey then hurries home to tell her mom. Her mother, Linda Heffer, blames her for the Mark and, together with her ultra-religious husband (Zoey's stepfather/step-loser), she tries to keep Zoey at home, to be presented to the Elders of the People of Faith, an anti-vampyre group. As fledglings need to be constantly in the presence of an adult vampyre so that their bodies won't reject the Change, Zoey flees to her grandmother Sylvia, a Cherokee Wise Woman. On the way, she passes out and has a vision with the vampyre goddess, Nyx, who announces to Zoey that she will be her \\"eyes and ears\\" at the House of Night. The goddess leaves Zoey with the words \\"Darkness does not always equate to evil, Light does not always bring good\\" which becomes a very frequent and important message throughout the series. Zoey wakes up at the school in the presence of her grandmother and the vampyre headmaster ‚Äì her future mentor, Neferet. She finds out that her Mark is all filled in, unusually for fledglings, but follows her intuition and doesn't mention the vision to Neferet. As a fledgling vampyre, Zoey has the opportunity to change her name and does so, taking her grandmother's surname, Redbird, before parting with her. Aphrodite, another fledgling then takes her to her room, where she meets Stevie Rae, her new roommate and, future best friend. Through Stevie Rae, Zoey meets and befriends Damien, Erin, and Shaunee. She also meets the snobby, beautiful leader of the Dark Daughters and Sons, Aphrodite, a fledgling with the power to see the future. To humiliate Zoey she invites her to join the Dark Daughters, who are an elitist group. Her new friends counsel her to accept so that they can get insight into Aphrodite's doing's. During the ritual, Aphrodite feeds her fledgling blood and Zoey discovers a new craving, unusual for her age. Embarrassed, she flees ‚Äì but finds Heath, her ex-boyfriend, and Kayla, her best friend, who have come to the school in an attempt to bust Zoey out. Zoey stumbles upon them while Kayla is hitting on Heath. An angry confrontation ensues with her now ex-best friend and Zoey loses control. She scratches Heath and drinks from the wound, creating an Imprint with him. Kayla freaks out and runs away; Zoey eventually persuades Heath to leave too. When they have gone, Zoey discovers that Erik Night, a handsome fifth former and Dark Son whom she met earlier, has seen the whole scene. He comforts her and escorts her back to the dorm. That night she is chosen by a cat, whom she names Nala. The following day, she meets Neferet, who explains to her that an Imprint is a link that takes place between an adult vampyre and his or her human Consort. As it is very unusual that Zoey could create an Imprint in her first month of being a \\"vampyre\\", she places Zoey into a senior vampyre sociology course. Zoey discovers that she has affinities for the five elements of air, fire, earth, water, and spirit ‚Äì something that has never happened before in vampyre history. Stevie Rae, Damien, Shaunee, and Erin each gain an affinity for one element as well. Zoey is (spitefully) invited back to the Dark Daughters and Sons' Samhain celebration, where they honor the spirits with some blood. Everything goes fine until sobered up Heath stumbles upon the scene and tries to bring Zoey back with him. Aphrodite accidentally summons evil spirits which try to take Heath's fresh human blood. Zoey steps in; she and her friends use their newfound abilities to stop the spirits. Neferet, who happens to witness everything, takes Aphrodite's status as leader of the Dark Daughters and Sons and gives it to Zoey instead. As they go home, Aphrodite angrily informs Zoey that \\"it's not over yet ‚Äì you don't understand.\\" Characters *Zoey Redbird *Nyx *Erik Night *Stevie Rae *Neferet *Heath Luck *Aphrodite LaFont *Sylvia Redbird *Erin Bates *Shaunee Cole *Damien Maslin *Linda Heffer Reception In its best week the book ranked 16th in the New York Times, USA Today Top 150 Bestseller List, where it remained an additional 89 weeks.Marked rank in the NY Times Top 150 bestseller list Furthermore, it won a Romantic Times Reviewers' Choice Young Adult Novel Award in 2009. :\\"The Casts, mother and daughter, have written a delightful book that's aimed at teens but will be enjoyed by readers of all ages.

The film starts with the scene of children entering a one-room school of 5 grades. The young teacher lets an older girl read the names of her attendance list, while she distributes paper booklets. The children are seen writing busily into them, but Manuel draws pictures. The teacher calls him out reminding him that it is mathematics lesson and everyone giggles. As the children walk home through swampy grass they pass by paramilitaries training in the field above them. Manuel's older friend Julian says that his older brother left town supposedly to work on the coast, though he believes he is with unnamed \\"guerillas\\". Manuel is seen cheer leading to play and starts a ball game in a tight circle of 10 boys, complaining the ball is a rag. Manuel lives with his mother, father Ernesto and infant brother on a small finca, owning a couple of cows and raising pigs. He takes a trip to a market where his father tries to sell a piglet. His father leaves Manuel at an outdoor cafe table, disappears in a house and returns with a small grain sack. Back home at night he is seated at a small table opposite his father with his infant son on his lap. Manuel's mother brings in a small chocolate cake lit with nine candles and Manuel unpacks his birthday present, a soccer ball and goalkeeper gloves. The next day the boys are seen playing soccer with the new ball which lands in a rocky flat. At the same time, a large black sow that Ernesto was pulling runs nearby the same flat, a detonation is heard and the animal flies in the air. Everyone is stunned, children, men and the teacher. She proposes to post a sign warning the community of the presence of landmines. The film revolves on Manuel's attempts to retrieve the ball, with the help of his older friend Julian and Poca Luz, an albino boy, as well as the changes of the village, the growing number of absent students at school, families fleeing while paramilitaries and guerrillas are moving in and fight for control of the area.

Biography  Bilders was born in Utrecht, where he lived until 1856, though from 1841 to 1845 the Bilders family lived in Oosterbeek, a village near Arnhem which later became a major center for Dutch plein-air-painters. His father Johannes Warnardus Bilders was a Dutch landscape-painter. In 1857 Gerard moved to The Hague. Bilders was financially supported by the Dutch writer who lived in Oosterbeek since 1851, where he inhabited a rural estate and invited several young artists as his prot√©g√©s:nl:De Hemelsche Berg. Kneppelhout was rather critical of Bilders's painterly talent and tried to push him into a more literary direction, what Gerard definitely refused. The two men wrote for several years many letters which were published by Kneppelhout [including Bilders' diary-notes of 1860 and 1862], shortly after Bilder's death in 1865.http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/bild004brie01_01/index.php Bilders received his first drawing lessons from his father, the landscape painter Johannes Warnardus Bilders. From the start of his artistic career Bilders' focus was on landscape painting but also on animals in the landscape. Bilders studied at the Academy of Visual Arts in The Hague from about 1857 to 1859 and drew naked and dressed models there. In the Mauritshuis museum he copied Paulus Potter's landscapes with cattle; for a while he was the pupil of landscape and animal painter Charles Humbert in Switzerland. From time to time Gerard Bilders would assist his father by filling in his landscape-painting with animals, as he did a.o. in 1859 by painting some goatshttps://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Gerard_Bilders in a large forest-landscape of his father, commissioned by a Russian art-seller. 'Landscape with cows in the Meadow', c. 1860-64 In 1860 they traveled together to the 'Exposition G√©n√©rale des Beaux-Arts' in Brussel where he became acquainted for the first time in his life with the painters of the French School of Barbizon. Two times he made a voyage to Switzerland/France; the first time as of September 1858, when he painted there together with some artist-friends in open air, in the Savoy. Later in 1859 he began painting in the county-area around Leiden, often 'meadows with cattle'. Here he tried to reproduce the moods that the Dutch flat landscape evoked by using peculiar light effects as well as 'a colored, fragrant warm grey.' In July 1860 he wrote: \\"I am searching for a tone, which we call 'colored grey'. I mean that all colors, even the strongest, can be brought together in such a way as to give the impression of a warm, vital grey.\\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Gerard_Bilders#'Vrolijk_Versterven'_(from_Bilders'_diary_&_letters). When he mixed all the colors of the palette just with grey to get this graying effect, he was usually dissatisfied with the result. His attempts in mixing unbroken colors foreshadowed the later tonal painting style of the Hague School painters. Gerard Bilders returned to Oosterbeek from 1857 - 1864 where he met Anton Mauve and the Maris brothers, in particular Willem Maris. He died in Amsterdam because of tuberculosis when he was only 26.  Artistic development and style  At the end of 1856 and beginning of 1857 Gerard Bilders was frequently visiting the Mauritshuis in The Hague, where he studied and copied the paintings of 17th century Dutch landscape painters, in particular the works of Paulus Potter and Jacob Ruisdael.\\". He then also wrote his menaces Kneppelhout in a letter how he sought and found refuge in these works; he felt himself being outside - in the landscape itself, while watching them in the museum. The paintings of Potter and Ruisdael inspired him to copy them carefully and faithfully, but now already he started to recognize at the same time in their works 'the landscape as a whole'! This was a characteristic point of interest for him, that would return again and again in his later letters and Journal notes. Apparently, 'wholeness' and 'unity' of the expressed landscape were essential elements for him.

It was a coal mining community located at the foot of Coal Mountain (elev. 6835 feet; 2083 metres), south of the Crowsnest Pass in the southern Canadian Rockies. Daniel Chase Corbin, president of Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway, founded the Corbin Coal and Coke Company and the town of Corbin in 1908, three years after he saw a very thick seam of bituminous coal exposed at the base of Coal Mountain. The town was built at an elevation of 5060 feet (1542 metres),MacKay, B.R. 1931a. Corbin Coal Field. Geological Survey of Canada, Summary Report, 1930, Part A, p. 154A-179A. and at one time it boasted a population of 600. It had its own railway, a company store, and a hotel, but it was isolated. No roads connected it to the outside, and there was no electricity or plumbing. Winters were harsh and living conditions were poor. The workers unionized in 1910. Between 1908 and 1935 the coal at Corbin was worked at a succession of six mines, of which five were underground mines (the No. 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 Mines) and one (the No. 3 Mine) was an open pit. Two seams, called the Mammoth Seam and the Upper Seam, were worked. They lay in complexly folded and faulted strataMacKay, B.R., 1931b. Corbin area, Kootenay District, British Columbia. Geological Survey of Canada, Map 279A. of the Mist Mountain Formation in the Kootenay Group. Due to the structural complexity, the seam thicknesses were quite variable, with the Mammoth Seam reaching a maximum of about 450 feet (137 metres). Most of the coal mined at that time was sold to the Canadian Pacific Railway, commercial centers in Washington and Oregon, and copper mines in south-central British Columbia. A major strike that began in January of 1935 turned violent in April. The mine closed on May 7 and the town was abandoned. The mine was operated by a different company for a few years during World War II to supply the smelter at Trail, but most of the workers traveled from elsewhere in the region and the town was not revived. Byron Creek Collieries opened a large open-pit mine at Corbin in 1972, but again most of the workers traveled from elsewhere. The mine was bought and sold several times until it was acquired by Teck Resources Ltd. in 2008, at which time it became known as the Coal Mountain Operations. Its coal reserves were mined out by the end of 2018, and work transitioned to mine reclamation activities.British Columbia coal industry overview, 2018, British Columbia Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, British Columbia Geological Survey, Information Circular 2019-02, p. 3 and 7.

Diplomatic and economic relations between Switzerland and Liechtenstein have been close, with Switzerland accepting the role of safeguarding the interests of its smaller neighbour, Liechtenstein.Principality of Liechtenstein, Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs Liechtenstein has an embassy in Bern.Embassy of Liechtenstein in Bern Switzerland is accredited to Liechtenstein from its Federal Department of Foreign Affairs in Bern and maintains an honorary consulate in Vaduz.Representation of Switzerland to Liechtenstein Cooperation At the request of Liechtenstein's government in 1919, Switzerland safeguards Liechtenstein's interests and citizens abroad. The two countries form a common economic and monetary area. Liechtenstein has used the Swiss franc since 1920, and the two countries have formed a customs union since 1924, and have open borders. Both are now also parties to the Schengen Agreement. The countries also have a common patent system. Switzerland is empowered to enter into treaties on Liechtenstein's behalf if Liechtenstein is not represented at the treaty negotiations; this power has most often been exercised with treaties involving customs duties or procedures. Swiss consular protection is extended to citizens of Liechtenstein. Switzerland represents Liechtenstein abroad unless they choose otherwise. Before Liechtenstein became a member in its own right of the European Free Trade Association, Switzerland represented its interests in that organization. The two also share a common language (German) and are both outside the European Union. Liechtenstein relies on Switzerland for its national defence as it has no army of its own. Like Switzerland, Liechtenstein maintains a policy of neutrality. Ambassadors to one country are usually accredited to the other. (The only resident ambassador in Liechtenstein is from the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.) Incidents involving the Swiss military The open border between the two countries at Balzers and Tr√ºbbach Switzerland has a relatively active military due to ongoing conscription. Several incidents have occurred during routine training: *On 14 October 1968, five Swiss artillery shells accidentally hit Liechtenstein's only skiing resort, Malbun. The only recorded damages were a few chairs belonging to an outdoor restaurant. *On 26 August 1976, just before midnight, 75 members of the Swiss militia and a number of packhorses mistakenly took a wrong turn and ended up 500 meters into Liechtenstein at Iradug, in Balzers. The Liechtensteiners reportedly offered drinks to the Swiss soldiers. * On 5 December 1985, anti-aircraft missiles fired by the Swiss Army landed in Liechtenstein amid a winter storm, causing a forest fire in a protected area. Compensation was paid. * On 13 October 1992, following written orders, Swiss Army recruits unknowingly crossed the border and went to Triesenberg to set up an observation post. Swiss commanders had overlooked the fact that Triesenberg was not on Swiss territory. Switzerland apologized to Liechtenstein for the incident. * On 3 March 2007, a company of 171 Swiss soldiers mistakenly entered Liechtenstein, as they were disorientated and took a wrong turn due to bad weather conditions. The troops returned to Swiss territory after they had travelled more than 2 km into the country. The Liechtenstein authorities did not discover the incursion and were informed by the Swiss after the incident. The incident was disregarded by both sides. A Liechtenstein spokesman said, \\"It's not like they invaded with attack helicopters. No problem, these things happen\\". Taxation and tax treaties Liechtenstein's standard rate of VAT (Mehrwertsteuer) is identical to Switzerland's for it must mirror the latter's continually and is currently 7.7%. The reduced rate is 2.5%. A special reduced rate of 3.7% is in use in the hotel industry. In July 2015, both countries signed a new agreement on double taxation, which took effect in December 2016, superseding the previous one from 1995. Some differences on the withholding tax arose, but Switzerland did not agree to introduce this practice to residents of Liechtenstein working in Switzerland.Liechtenstein scheitert mit Quellensteuer f√ºr Grenzg√§nger(in German).

Having originally been proposed in an article that appeared in the Journal of Monetary Economics in 1988, the corresponding technical appendix detailing their derivation has only been published in 2002. Denote consumption with C, leisure with L and the absolute value of the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption with \\\\sigma _c . Strict concavity of the utility function implies \\\\sigma _c > 0. For 0 < \\\\sigma _c < 1 or \\\\sigma _c > 1 the utility function has the multiplicatively separable form u\\\\left( {C,L} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{{1 - {\\\\sigma _c}}}{C^{1 - {\\\\sigma _c}}}v\\\\left( L \\\\right) where v\\\\left( L \\\\right) is increasing and concave if 0 < \\\\sigma _c < 1 or decreasing and convex if \\\\sigma _c > 1 . Further restrictions are required to assure overall concavity of the momentarily utility function. In the limit case of \\\\sigma _c = 1 the resulting preferences specification is additively separable and given by u\\\\left( {C,L} \\\\right) = \\\\ln {C_t} + v\\\\left( L \\\\right) where v\\\\left( L \\\\right) is increasing and concave. The reason for the prevalence of this preference specification in macroeconomics is that they are compatible with balanced growth along the optimal steady state. Hence, they are used in many dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models, which are typically derived from the neoclassical growth model. The reason for their compatibility with balanced growth is twofold. First, having a constant interest rate in steady state, the growth rate of marginal utility must be constant, which is the case here. Second, having a finite time endowment, balanced growth together with an optimal choice of labor by the agents implies that income and substitution effect of the increase in real wages due to productivity increases must cancel each other. Shortcut to achieve balanced growth compatibility To have additively separable preferences along with balanced growth, some studies use the shortcut of introducing a scaling factor containing the level of labor augmenting technology before the leisure term. An example of such a utility function would be u\\\\left( C,L \\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{1 - \\\\sigma _c}C^{1 -\\\\sigma _c} + z^{1 - \\\\sigma _c}\\\\frac{\\\\left( 1 - L \\\\right)^{1 + \\\\kappa }}{1 + \\\\kappa } Where \\\\kappa denotes the inverse of the Frisch elasticity of labor supply and z is the level of labor augmenting technology. Relationship to other common macroeconomic preference types KPR-preferences are one polar case nested in Jaimovich‚ÄìRebelo preferences. The latter allow to freely scale the wealth effect on the labor supply. The other polar case is the Greenwood‚ÄìHercowitz‚ÄìHuffman preferences, where the wealth effect on the labor supply is completely shut off. However, this naturally implies that they are incompatible with a balanced growth path.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Saginaw. In 1979 it was included as a contributing property in the Saginaw Central City Historic Residential District on the National Register of Historic Places. History =St. Mary‚Äôs Church= St. Mary's parish was founded in 1853 by the Rev. Henry J.H. Schutjes as a mission of St. Joseph parish in Bay City. The first church building was dedicated the same year and the second church building was built ten years later. St. Mary's became a parish in 1866 and the Rev. Francis T. Van der Bom was named the first pastor. In 1868 the parish's first school opened in a two-room schoolhouse. Four sisters from the congregation of the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary from Monroe taught in the school. St. Joseph Parish in Saginaw was founded from St. Mary's in 1873 and the German parishioners founded Sacred Heart the following year. Father Van der Bom and Dr. Benjamin B. Ross organized St. Mary's Hospital, which was staffed by four Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, in 1874. Because the other two parishes took parishioners from St. Mary's the enrollment in the school dropped and the Immaculate Heart of Mary sisters left the parish in 1875. The two-story, brick, Ch√¢teauesque-style rectory was built the same year. The second parish school, named St. Mary Academy, was built in 1878. It was staffed by the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods. In 1886 the Polish families of the parish established Holy Rosary Mission in East Saginaw. The French parishioners established Holy Family Parish in 1892. Construction on the present church began in 1901 and it was completed in 1903. The third church building to house the parish was dedicated on July 23, 1903. The Sisters of Providence left St. Mary's Academy in 1907 and deeded the property to the Bishop of Grand Rapids. They were replaced by the Dominican Sisters from Grand Rapids. Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Parish was established in 1913 by 120 Italian families from the parish. A new school building was completed in 1920. =Cathedral= St. Mary's Church became the cathedral of the Diocese of Saginaw when it was established by Pope Pius XI on February 26, 1938. In 1941 the cathedral was extensively renovated and a new altar, which replaced the altar that had been used in the second church, was placed in the church. A new two-story convent was built in 1956. The cathedral was extensively renovated in 1978. The altar and the cathedra were moved to the main floor area of the church from the apse. A Blessed Sacrament chapel was created, movable chairs replaced the pews, the gallery was expanded, the organ and choir area were relocated, a new side entrance from the parking lot was created, and the interior was redecorated and painted. The cathedral was re- dedicated on June 1, 1978. Because of declining enrollment and increased tuition, the East Side Catholic Schools system was created in 1982. Pre- schoolers through third-grade students attended St. Casimir School, fourth through sixth-grade students attend Our Lady Help of Christians School, and students in grades seven to 12 attended St. Mary Cathedral School. Two years later St. Mary Cathedral School merged with St. Stephen and Saints Peter and Paul high schools to create Nouvel Catholic Central High School. The former St. Mary Cathedral School building was sold in 1988. It was abandoned by its new owners two years later and became a source of blight. A covered entrance and elevator were added to the side entrance, a new sound system was installed and necessary repairs were made to the interior and exterior of the cathedral in 2000. In January 2007 Bishop Robert J. Carlson formed a diocesan committee to study the possibility of renovating and renewing the Cathedral campus. Neighborhood Renewal Services helped the diocese purchase back the former cathedral school building in September of the same year. The following month the diocese bought the former convent from Holy Cross Children's Services, which was in the process of relocating. Renovations were completed on the former convent in February 2008. It houses the parish offices, the Cathedral Mental Health Clinic and Abortion Alternatives Inc. St. Dominic Chapel serves as a day chapel for the cathedral parish. The former St. Mary Cathedral School building was demolished in June 2008; a new roof was placed on the cathedral in the autumn of the same year. The cathedral closed temporarily starting in February 2017 for an extensive renovation.. Masses were held in St. Andrew's Church during its closure. The $4.7 million renovation included a re- configuration of the interior; a new marble altar, ambo, and baptismal font; new wooden cathedra and pews; and an addition that contains handicapped accessible restrooms. It has a seating capacity of about 500 people. Pipe organ At the time of the 2017 renovation, the 1930 Kilgen pipe organ that was in St. Joseph's Church in Bay City, Michigan, was rebuilt in the cathedral by the Lauck Pipe Organ Co. of Otsego, Michigan. The organ had undergone major renovations in 1984 and in 2002. The instrument features 30 ranks of pipes for a total of about 1,800, two consoles with three manuals each, and a pedalboard.

Built between 1839 and 1843, it replaced the Old Church of St Nidan, Llanidan, which needed significant repair, providing a place of Anglican worship nearer to the village than the old church. Some items were moved here from the old church, including the 13th-century font, two bells from the 14th and 15th century, and a reliquary thought to hold the remains of St Nidan. The tower at the west end has been described as \\"top heavy\\" and looking like \\"a water tower\\". The church is still used for worship by the Church in Wales, one of five in a group of parishes in the south of Anglesey. It is a Grade II listed building, a national designation given to \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\", in particular because it is regarded as \\"a distinctive example of pre-archaeological gothic revival work.\\" The 19th- century clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that it had been built in a \\"debased barbarous style, showing neither architectural science nor taste\\". History and location St Nidan's Church was built between 1839 and 1843, replacing its medieval predecessor. The architect was John Welch, who also designed St Ffinan's Church, Llanffinan, in central Anglesey, which was built in 1841. St Nidan's was originally intended to have a spire on the west tower, but this was not added. The chancel was built in 1882, and a vestry and organ chamber added later. The battlements on the tower were added in 1933, replacing the original gabling. St Nidan's is set within a walled churchyard on the north of the A4080 road, in the south of Anglesey, Wales. The village of Brynsiencyn is about 500 metres (about one-third of a mile) to the south-west, and the old church of St Nidan is about 750 metres (about half a mile) to the south-east. A new church was needed because the old church needed significant repair and also because the growth of Brynsiencyn meant that more people lived there than in Llanidan itself. Like its predecessor, it is dedicated to Nidan, a 7th-century Welsh saint who was the confessor of the monastery at Penmon, on the eastern tip of Anglesey. St Nidan's is still used for worship by the Church in Wales. It is one of five churches in the combined benefice (parishes combined under one priest) of Newborough with Llanidan with Llangeinwen and Llanfair-yn-y-Cymwd. The parish is within the deanery of Tindaethwy and Menai, the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor. As of 2019, the priest in charge is E. Roberts. Architecture and fittings St Nidan's is built mainly from red gritstone rubble, dressed with sandstone, with buttresses at the corners; the roof, which is made from slate, has stone copings with a cross at the east end. The church is built in a cross-shape, in Early English style. There is a tower at the west end, which has battlements at the top along with a clock on the east and west sides, a belfry in the middle, and an entrance porch with an arched doorway at the bottom. There are two transepts leading from the nave, one to the north and one to the south, and a chancel at the east end. There are four \\"equal and bold\\" arches at the crossing where nave, transepts and chancel meet. The quadrant-shaped organ room and vestry are built into the eastern external angles of the chancel and transepts, one on each side of the church. The gallery at the west end of the nave, supported by octagonal columns, is reached from the entrance porch; it has its pews set at an angle. A step leads up from the nave into the chancel, with a further two steps up from the chancel into the sanctuary. The floor of the chancel and the sanctuary are made from encaustic tiles. The internal walls have been plastered. The nave has two bays, each lit with a lancet window; the transepts have groups of three large lancent windows, as does the east end of the building. The chancel window depicts \\"Faith, Hope and Charity\\", by Heaton, Butler and Bayne (1877); it is dedicated to the 5th Lord Boston who died in 1897. One transept set of windows by Shrigley and Hunt depicts the Ascension, in memory of Anna Maria Evans (died 1929, wife of the vicar Richard Evans). A sandstone chest with a glass front was moved here from the old church; local tradition maintains that it holds the relics of St Nidan. It was discovered under the altar of the old church, and may date from the 16th century. The church also has pews made of pine, and a semi-octagonal pulpit with decorated panels. A survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire in 1937 noted which of the church's contents had come from the old church. The report listed the font, which has carved decoration and dates from the early 13th century; two bells, one from the first half of the 14th century (inscribed \\"+ E:D:A:N\\") and another from the latter part of the 15th century (inscribed \\"THOMAS AP MEREDITH\\"); and a carved oak chair from the time of Charles II. In 1906, a survey of church plate within the Bangor diocese recorded that St Nidan's had a silver chalice and alms dish. These were donated probably in 1701 and remade in 1871‚Äì72. It also had a silver paten and two cruets with silver handles, all marked with the date 1871‚Äì72. Records from the 19th century indicated that two tankards (one silver, one pewter) and a silver chalice had been lost. The churchyard contains the grave of Sir Ellis Ellis-Griffith, 1st Baronet, who was MP for Anglesey for 25 years. The grave, by the church's north wall, has a bust of the politician wearing a wing collar. Other people buried here include the Presbyterian minister and theologian J. E. Hughes, who died in 1959. There are four Commonwealth war graves, of a British Army soldier of World War I and three soldiers of World War II. CWGC Cemetery report, breakdown from casualty record. Assessment The tower at the west end of the church The church has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building ‚Äì the lowest of the three grades of listing, designating \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\". It was given this status on 30 January 1968, and has been listed as \\"a small early 19th-century church\\". Cadw (the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) describes the church as \\"a distinctive example of pre-archaeological gothic revival work.\\" Writing in 1846, the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones condemned the treatment of the old church, which he said was \\"one of the largest and most important in the island of Anglesey\\", given its architecture, contents and traditions. He said that the new church had been built \\"in a debased barbarous style, showing neither architectural science nor taste, and without any example or analogy amongst the ecclesiastical edifices of any age, except the present.\\" He also described it in 1863 as \\"that hideous pile ... a painfully impressive example of architectural bad taste.\\" He said that the font was \\"one of the most interesting as a work of art (not later than the thirteenth century) extent in Anglesey\\", and although he did not consider that its design or execution matched that of the font at St Ceinwen's Church, Llangeinwen, it was \\"a highly valuable specimen of medieval taste.\\" The reliquary, he added, was \\"unique, so far as Wales is concerned\\". The 19th-century writer Samuel Lewis said that the new church was \\"apparently of substantial construction, but is much inferior in style to the old building.\\" The historian and clergyman Edmund Tyrrell Green, writing a survey of Anglesey church architecture and contents in 1929, described the church as \\"hideous\\", although he said that the font was \\"remarkable\\" for its \\"very graceful patterns in relief showing influence of Greek classical design.\\" A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey says that it is \\"of fairly unusual appearance, not at all typical of Anglesey churches in its stonework or the shape of the castelled tower\\". It comments that the organ and vestry were in \\"unusually-shaped rooms\\", and notes the \\"ornate stained glass\\" of the Ascension. A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region says that the church is \\"bolder\\" than John Welch's similarly designed church at Llandudno. It describes the tower as \\"top-heavy with battlements... like a water tower\\", and adds that the seating is \\"crowded\\".

Hecyra (English: The Mother-in- Law) is a comedic Latin play by the early Roman playwright Terence. The Hecyra was a failure at its first two stagings. The first in 165 BC was disrupted when a rumor spread that a tightrope-walker and boxers were about to perform. In 160 BC the production was cancelled when the theater was stormed by a group of rowdy gladiator fans. It was presented successfully only at its third attempt later that same year.Hecyra, prologue by Lucius Ambivius Turpio A musical phrase accompanying a single line of Hecyra was copied in the 18th century by Italian composer Arcangelo Corelli from a 10th-century manuscript and was for a long time believed to be all that remains of the entire body of ancient Roman music. However, musicologist Thomas J. Mathiesen comments that it is no longer believed to be authentic. Hecyra is based on plays by Apollodorus of Carystus and Menander.  Characters  * Laches ‚Äì Athenian gentleman and father of Pamphilus. * Sostrata ‚Äì Wife of Laches. The mother-in- law of the play's title. * Pamphilus ‚Äì Son of Laches and Sostrata. Married to Philumena * Phidippus ‚Äì Athenian gentleman and father of Philumea. Neighbour to Laches * Myrrina ‚Äì Wife of Phidippus. * Syra ‚Äì An old bawd. * Philotis ‚Äì A young prostitute. * Bacchis ‚Äì A courtesan and mistress to Pamphilus. * Parmeno ‚Äì Laches's slave. * Sosia ‚Äì Another slave to Laches. * Philumena ‚Äì Wife of Pamphilus and daughter of Phidippus and Myrrina. She does not appear on stage. Summary The son of the elderly Laches and wife Sostrata, a young man named Pamphilus is enamored with a prostitute, Bacchis, yet in a drunken fit one night, he decides to debauch a young woman named Philumena, the daughter of Phidippus and Myrrhina. After a struggle, he rapes Philumena and from her finger tears a ring that he afterwards gives to his girlfriend, Bacchis. After some hesitation, Pamphilus finally consents to an arranged marriage. By chance, the woman chosen for him is Philumena, and she alone knows that she had been raped by an unidentified man, and she hopes that her disgrace is concealed. After the young man and woman are married, Bacchis rejects Pamphilus, and the latter becomes more and more enamored with his new wife. Pamphilus is then called away from the city, and Philumena finds herself pregnant from the rape. She fears detection, and she especially avoids her mother-in-law, Sostrata. She returns to her parents' home, where Sostrata seeks her, but Philumena claims illness and will not allow the mother-in-law inside the house. Pamphilus returns home during the birth of the baby, and the situation brings him great distress. Myrrhina, the wife of Phidippus, then begs him to keep the pregnancy a secret, but he declines to take back Philumena. Laches then states that Pamphilus is still enamored with Bacchis, but this supposition is proven untrue. It is then that the stolen ring is discovered on Bacchis's finger, and Pamphilus realizes the baby is his. He happily takes back his wife and new son.

The installation, repair and serviceability of sophisticated command, control, communications, intelligence, intelligence, surveillance, and air reconnaissance to Air Force installations worldwide is the responsibility of the men and women of the 202nd Engineering Installation Squadron.  History  The 8226th Air Base Squadron was organized at Cochran Field, Macon, Georgia on 3 October 1952. The acting commander was First Lieutenant Eldridge B. Chester, a WW II veteran. The first noncommissioned officer was Sergeant Dennis F. Thompson, a Korean War veteran. Sergeant Thompson served as the squadron's Administrative technician. He was also the first enlisted man discharged from Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, after the Korean War. Together, Lt Chester and Sergeant Thompson recruited nine enlisted men before the first Unit Training Assembly on 9 November 1952. The 8226th Air Base Squadron was reorganized on 7 December 1952 and named the 202nd Communications Maintenance Squadron, commanded by Captain George E. Smith and First Sergeant, Master Sergeant Earl C. Hunnicutt. The squadron was authorized 13 officers and 94 airmen. The unit attained full strength within one year. After helping get the unit off to a great start, Lt. Chester became the new squadron's first Operations Officer. Sergeant Thompson became the First Sergeant in 1956. The first summer camp was held at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia. Personnel were assigned to various electronics shops on base for training with the regular Air Force troops. Summer training encampments with the gaining command, Air Materiel Command (later Air Force Logistics Command) were conducted at Griffiss Air Force Base, New York during the years 1955-1960. The unit was reorganized on 1 November 1966, and called the 202d Ground Electronic Engineering Installation Agency Squadron (GEEIA Sq) with personnel strength of 23 officers and 294 airmen. The officer strength was later reduced to 17. On 19 April 1971 the unit was reorganized again and assigned to Air Force Communications Service, with personnel strength of 14 officers and 252 airmen and became the 202nd Electronics Installation Squadron. The first woman to enlist in the 202d was Staff Sergeant Sandra Calhoun, enlisted in 1972. Staff Sergeant Calhoun as of the year 2000 was Lieutenant Colonel Sandra (Calhoun) Curran, the Commander of 153rd Logistics Squadron, Cheyenne, Wyoming. In 1982, the 202d changed to its present name, 202d Engineering Installation Squadron. The unit's mission of engineering, installation, removal and relocation of Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) information systems has change slightly over the years but its technicians have remained constant to their motto \\"Global Technicians, Anytime - Anywhere.\\" In October 1993, the 202d Engineering Installation Squadron was assigned to Air Force Materiel Command and the Electronic Systems Center. In 1996, members of the 202d returned to active duty status once again to support Georgia by assisting with the 1996 Summer Olympics. The guardsmen were activated to help with security and other logistical support needs for the athletes. In June 1998 members of the unit were called upon to deploy to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base to install the Combat Information Transport System. The three-month project was a total force effort involving, the active duty Air Force and Air National Guard. While at Davis-Monthan, the 202d conducted a Peach Star exercise combining peacetime workload with Chemical Warfare Defense Readiness Training. In June 2000, the 202d met the Air Forces' Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) call to service. Over twenty-five Guardsmen quickly volunteered to meet the Air Force's new deployment concept of an Expeditionary Force, capable of deploying anywhere in the world to meet real world contingencies. The AEF concept is a total force effort, with Air National Guard, active duty Air Force and Air Force Reserve forces working side by side. Today the unit has approximately 140 people in a variety of Air Force Specialty Codes including Ground Radio, Wideband, Cable, Antenna Construction, Engineering, Drafting, Workload, Logistics and Command Support. The 202d Engineering Installation Squadron can mobilize to provide combat communication installation and support anywhere in the world. The unit provides its own in house Information Technology, Personnel, Vehicle Maintenance and Material Control functions. This outstanding team support ensures the squadron is ready to deploy when the time comes.Gordon, Jenny, 202nd EIS settling into new home at Robins 10/21/2011 78 Air Base Wing Public Affairs Office  Mission  The unit supports all major commands and real world contingencies including United States Air Force Europe and Ninth Air Force, based at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina. The unit also responds to emergencies and natural disasters both overseas and throughout the United States. Its team of enlisted and officer engineers, draftsmen, cable and electronics professionals design and install communications infrastructure. A few of their duties include building antennae, towers, fiber optics, and surveillance equipment, to access control and intrusion detection systems anywhere in the world.116th Air Control Wing Factsheet During local training exercises, known as Operations Lightning Warrior and Peach Star, the members of the 202nd deployed to a variety of sites around the United States. These exercises mirror actual deployment requirements. Exercises allow members the training opportunity to pack equipment and supplies as if deploying for a tactical mission. Once at their destination, unit members provide combat communications installations and support. The 202nd Engineering Installation Squadron has participated in more than 100 deployments to destinations that have included Germany, Italy, Panama Canal Zone, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, St. Croix, England, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. In peacetime operations, the 202nd supports more than nine Air National Guard Bases and 21 Geographically Separated Units (GSU) throughout the southeastern part of the United States. The unit deploys in small installation teams such as Ground Radio, Cable, Antenna Construction, Wideband and Staff Support Teams. About 25 percent of its members are usually deployed to various locations around the United States in support of on-going installations. The unit has also participated in emergency relief operations in its operational area of central Georgia. In 1994 the 202nd was called to State Active Duty in response to floods resulting from Tropical Storm Alberto. The unit evacuated local residents, provided communications equipment to emergency personnel, and delivered drinking water to flood victims. The 202nd \\"Lightning Warriors\\" have deployed to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait where they have designed and installed communications upgrades for the United States Air Expeditionary Forces in Southwest Asia. The 202nd Engineering Installation Squadron is the lead unit, and joined with sister Engineering Installation Squadrons (EIS) from Tennessee, Missouri and Louisiana for a three-month rotation. As the lead unit, the 202nd has the responsibility of coordinating all EIS logistical and project management support for CENTAF requirements in Southwest Asia.

The tribe hosts an annual powwow in early June. These peoples are descended from members of the historic Muscogee or Creek Confederacy of numerous tribes in the southeast United States, particularly Georgia and Alabama. History They are one of eight Federally recognized tribes whose members are descended from the Creek Confederacy of the Southeast. Four tribes are located in Oklahoma, to where most of the Creeks were forcibly removed from the indigenous Creek homeland in Alabama and Western Georgia in the 1830s during the trail of tears under Indian Removal, one tribe is in Louisiana where another band of Creeks fled European encroachment in two waves in the late 1700s and the early 1800s and another tribe comprises the Poarch Band of Creeks who remained in Alabama. The Seminole Indian Nation in Florida also includes a large percentage of descendants of the Creek Confederacy who relocated there and merged with another tribe. Under pressure from European-American settlement, the ancestors of this tribe were Alabama and Coushatta peoples who migrated from Alabama and the Southeast into Louisiana and finally east Texas when it was under Spanish rule in the late eighteenth century. They settled in an area known as Big Thicket and adapted their culture to the environment of forest and waters. When the area began to be settled by European Americans from the United States, the tribes established friendly relations and traded with the new settlers. Sam Houston helped protect them during years of conflicts with other Native Americans in the area. After annexation of Texas by the United States, settlement increased and the tribes were under pressure again. They appealed to the state to have land set aside for their exclusive use. =Termination Efforts= As part of the Indian termination policy followed by the US government between the 1940s and 1960s, the Alabama Coushatta Tribe was targeted. On 23 August 1954 the United States Congress passed laws to terminate the federal relationship with the tribe. Public Law ch. 831, ¬ß1, 68 Stat. 768 provided that the Secretary of the Interior was to transfer to the State of Texas the tribal lands for the benefit of the tribe. In addition, it terminated the federal trust relationship to the tribe and the individual members of the tribe and canceled any federal debts. In 1965 under House Bill 1096, 59th Texas Legislature, Regular Session, the newly formed Texas Indian Commission took over state administration and supervision for the Alabama- Coushatta Indian Reservation. On 22 March 1983, Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox released an opinion (JM-17) stating that the state's assumption of power over the property of the Alabama‚ÄìCoushatta was a violation of the Texas Constitution. He stated that as the federal government had withdrawn its recognition the tribe was \\"merely an unincorporated association under Texas law, with the same legal status as other private associations ... the 3,071 acre tract is entirely free from any legally meaningful designation as an 'Indian Reservation'.\\" In response to concerns by the tribe, Representative Ronald D. Coleman of Texas introduced a federal bill on 28 February 1985 to restore federal jurisdiction for the tribe. Because the initial bill HR 1344 allowed gambling, amendments were made and the Yselta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama and Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas Restoration Act was reintroduced as HR 318. Public Law 100-89, 101 STAT. 666 was enacted 18 August 1987 and restored the federal relationship with the tribe. Section 207 (25 U.S.C. ¬ß 737) specifically prohibits all gaming activities prohibited by the laws of the state of Texas. Reservation The Alabama‚ÄìCoushatta Indian Reservation was established in 1854,Pritzker 364 when the state bought \\"1,110.7 acres of land for the Alabama Indian reservation. About 500 tribe members settled on this land during the winter of 1854‚Äì55. In 1855 the Texas legislature appropriated funds to purchase 640 acres for the Coushattas\\" but never followed through. The Coushatta began to live with the Alabama on their reservation. Both the peoples struggled after the Civil War, as few spoke English and they had difficulty finding jobs. They acquired more land and today their reservation is 4,593.7 acres large, located 17 miles east of Livingston, Texas. About half the tribe, or 500 people, live on the reservation. Languages Both the Alabama and Koasati languages are Muskogean languages. Government The Alabama‚ÄìCoushatta Tribe of Texas is headquartered in Livingston, Texas. The tribe is governed by a democratically elected seven-member council, as well as a principal chief and second chief who serve for life.

The case received international attention, including Amnesty International's naming her a prisoner of conscience and campaigning heavily for her release; this appeal remains ignored by North Korean authorities.  Early life in South Korea and Germany  Shin was born in Tongyeong, Gyeongsangnam-do, Korea in an area now part of South Korea. She attended elementary and middle school there. From 1958 she studied nursery at Masan Nursing School. In 1970 she left South Korea for Germany, where she worked as a nurse in T√ºbingen. There she met Oh Kil-nam, a South Korean economics student, marrying him in 1972. Later they moved near Kiel (Germany), where she gave birth to her daughters Oh Hae-won (on September 17, 1976) and Oh Kyu-won (on June 21, 1978). The family lived in Kronshagen near Kiel until 1985.  Move to North Korea  Oh became involved in political activism against the South Korean government in the early 1980s. He was influenced in this by a number of famous South Korean leftists in Germany, including Song Du-yul and Yun Isang; they later suggested that he could help his motherland by working as an economist in North Korea. His activism also attracted the attention of North Korean government representatives, who further attempted to entice him to defect, claiming that his wife could receive free treatment for her hepatitis in Pyongyang. Over Shin's objections, the family moved to North Korea, arriving on 8 December 1985. Instead of receiving the promised medical treatment, he and his wife were reportedly held at a military camp and forced to study the Juche ideology of Kim Il-sung. They were then employed making propaganda broadcasts to South Korea. While there, Oh claims to have met South Korean abductees who were also employed making propaganda broadcasts, including two of the flight attendants from the Korean Air Lines YS-11 hijacking. Later, the North Korean authorities sent Oh Kil-nam back to Germany to recruit other South Korean students for North Korea, telling him his family could not go along. Oh said later that Shin hit him in the face when he said he would come back with some South Koreans, and that she then told him, \\"we have to pay the price for our wrong decision, but you shouldn't follow an order that victimizes others and just run away. Our daughters shouldn't become the daughters of hateful accomplices. If you escape this country, please rescue us, but if you fail, believe that we're dead.\\" Oh Kil-nam's defection In 1986, Oh Kil-nam requested political asylum in Denmark on his way to Germany. The following year, Shin and her daughters (then 9 and 11 years old) were deported to Yodok camp, apparently because her husband did not return to North Korea. Official North Korean intermediaries gave Oh letters from Shin and her daughters in 1988 and 1989, and an audio tape with their voices and six photos of the family from Yodok in 1991. Some of the photos were published. North Korean defectors and former Yodok prisoners An Hyuk and Kang Chol-hwan stated that Shin had attempted suicide several times, but was still alive at the time of their 1987 release. Korea Times reported in September 2011 that Shin and her daughters were alive and had been relocated to another prison camp. The report also stated that she denied having written a pledge of allegiance to Kim Jong-il.  Campaigns on Shin Suk-ja's behalf  In 1993, Amnesty International started a campaign to free Shin and her daughters from Yodok camp. On the basis of all the available information, Amnesty International believes that Shin Sook Ja and her two daughters were detained because of Oh's request for political asylum abroad. Amnesty International designated Shin and her daughters as prisoners of conscience and called on the North Korean authorities to release them immediately and unconditionally. In April 2011, human rights activists in Shin's hometown including Kim Sung-uk started the \\"Daughter of Tongyeong Rescue Campaign\\", which received some media attention in South Korea and worldwide and as of September 2011, had collected more than 70,000 signatures to free Shin and her daughters. In July 2011, SAGE Korea led by South Korean activist Kim Sung-uk held a special event calling for the release of Shin, along with her daughters. In November 2011, Amnesty International included Shin and other prisoners in Yodok camp in the \\"Write for Rights\\" letter-writing campaign. A month later, the Korean Central News Agency, North Korea's state news service, described the campaign for Shin Suk-ja as \\"a smear campaign\\", \\"prompted by black-hearted intentions\\". Death report In a May 2012 response to an inquiry by the United Nations, a North Korean official replied that Shin had died of hepatitis. The ambassador also stated that Shin and Oh's daughters had renounced their father for \\"abandoning\\" his family. Oh replied in a press conference that he did not believe the report, citing cases in which abducted Japanese citizens had been falsely declared dead by North Korea.

He is also the Chairman of the Political Committee of Hezbi Islami in Afghanistan. Ghairat Baheer was held by American forces in extrajudicial detention for over six years. The BBC News reported Pakistani officials took him into custody during a pre-dawn raid on his home in Islamabad on October 30, 2002. The BBC said no reason was offered for his apprehension, and that there were rumors US security officials participated in the raid. After his release in May 2008 Baheer asserted he had spent six months in the salt pit, one of the Central Intelligence Agency's network of clandestine interrogation centers. He spent the rest of his detention in the Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan. According to the Associated Press Baheer is a medical doctor, a son-in-law of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of the Hezbi Islami Gulbuddin previously a militant group, and that he was captured with Gul Rahman, the only captive the CIA has acknowledged died in captivity. In 2010 Baheer was a member of the Hezbi Islami Gulbuddin peace delegation to peace talks. In an interview with the German news agency DPA Bahir said he spent most of his six years in captivity in chains, bombarded with disorienting music so loud his guards wore hearing protection. He said they were fed an inadequate quantity of food, and he lost 40 kilograms, and he still hadn't fully recovered his strength. In 2012 he served as the HiG's main negotiator with the United States. David Loyn, of the BBC News, quoting sources close to new President of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani, reported that Ghairat Baheer had been offered a position in his new cabinet. Baheer, former Taliban Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wakil Ahmad Muttawakil, and former Taliban Ambassador to Pakistan Abdul Salem Zaeef, were offered the Ministries of Minister of Rural Affairs, Minister of Border Affairs and Minister of Religious Affairs. On June 14, 2018, Baheer addressed 180 members of the Hezbi Islami Party, who had just been released from prison, following the peace negotiations he had helped lead. He urged the men, on behalf of the party, to be peaceful, law-abiding citizens. Ghairat Baheer was sworn in as a Senator and a member of the House of Elders on September 16, 2018. He was selected for the senate as part of the one third members that the President is entitled to appoint. He is also currently the Chairman of the Political Committee of Hezbi Islami in Afghanistan.

Chromatin bridge is a mitotic occurrence that forms when telomeres of sister chromatids fuse together and fail to completely segregate into their respective daughter cells. Because this event is most prevalent during anaphase, the term anaphase bridge is often used as a substitute. After the formation of individual daughter cells, the DNA bridge connecting homologous chromosomes remains fixed. As the daughter cells exit mitosis and re-enter interphase, the chromatin bridge becomes known as an interphase bridge. These phenomena are usually visualized using the laboratory techniques of staining and fluorescence microscopy. Background The faithful inheritance of genetic information from one cellular generation to the next heavily relies on the duplication of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), as well as the formation of two identical daughter cells. This complicated cellular process, known as mitosis, depends on a multitude of cellular checkpoints, signals, interactions and signal cascades for accurate and faithful functioning. Cancer, characterized by uncontrollable cell growth mechanisms and high tendencies for proliferation and metastasis, is highly prone to mitotic mistakes. As a result, several forms of chromosomal aberrations occur, including, but not limited to, binucleated cells, multipolar spindles and micronuclei. Chromatin bridges may serve as a marker of cancer activity. A. Microtubules localized at a chromatin bridge. These polymers are stained with anti-tubulin antibody and viewed using fluorescence microscopy. B. Merged images of two daughter cells connected by a chromatin bridge. The fluorescence techniques of indirect immunofluorescence and DAPI staining were utilized. C. The same cells visualized using DAPI staining. Process of formation Chromatin bridges may form by any number of processes wherein chromosomes remain topologically entangled during mitosis. One way in which this may occur is the failure to resolve joint molecules formed during homologous recombination mediated DNA repair, a process that ensures that replicated chromosomes are intact before chromosomes are segregated during cell division. In particular, genetic studies have demonstrated that the loss of the enzymes BLM (Bloom's Syndrome Helicase) or FANCM each result in a dramatic increase in the number of chromatin bridges. This occurs because loss of these genes causes an increase in chromosome fusions, either in an end-to-end manner or through topological entrapment (e.g., catenation or unresolved DNA cross-links), have also been associated with chromatin bridge formation. When viewed under a fluorescence microscope and immunostained for cytological markers, these chromatin bridges appear to emanate from either centromeres, telomeres or DNA crosslinks (as marked by FANCD2). Fluorescence techniques A chromatin bridge, visualized using DAPI staining. Chromatin bridges can be viewed utilizing a laboratory technique known as fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence is the process that involves excitation of a fluorophore (a molecule with the ability to emit fluorescent light in the visible light spectrum) using ultraviolet light. After the fluorophore becomes chemically excited by the presence of UV light, it emits visible light at a specific wavelength, producing different colors. Fluorophores may be added as a molecular tag to different portions of a cell. DAPI is a fluorophore that specifically binds to DNA and fluoresces blue. In addition, immunofluorescence may be used as a laboratory technique to tag cells with specific fluorophores using antibodies, immune proteins created by B lymphocytes. Antibodies are utilized by the immune system in the identification and binding of foreign substances. Tubulin is a monomer of microtubules that compose the cellular cytoskeleton. The antibody anti-tubulin specifically binds to these tubulin monomeric subunits. A fluorophore can be chemically attached to the anti-tubulin antibody, which then fluoresces green. Numerous antibodies may bind to microtubules in order to amplify the fluorescent signal. Fluorescence microscopy allows for the observation of different components of the cell against a dark background for high intensity and specificity. Practical applications =Detection= Chromatin bridges are easiest and most readily visible when observing chromosomes stained with DAPI. DNA bridges appear to be a blue, ‚Äústring-like‚Äù connection between two separated daughter cells. This effect is created when sticky ends of chromosomes remain connected to one another, even after mitosis. A chromatin bridge may also be observed using indirect immunofluorescence, in which anti- tubulin emits a green coloration when bound to microtubules in the presence of UV light. Because microtubules maintain the positions of the chromosomes during mitosis, they appear to be densely pinched between the two dividing, daughter cells. Chromatin bridges can be difficult to locate utilizing fluorescence microscopy, as this phenomenon is not incredibly abundant and tend to appear faint against the dark background. =Cancer= Recently, chromatin bridges have been implied as a diagnostic marker for cancer, while having been linked to tumorigenesis in humans. This premise is based on the fact that as the mitotic cell divides and the daughter cells move further apart, stress on the DNA bridge leads to breakages in the chromosome at random points. As previously stated, the disruptions in the chromosome may lead to single chromosome mutations, including deletion, duplication and inversion, among others. This instability, defined as frequent changes in chromosomal structure and number, may be the basis of the development of cancer. While the frequency of chromatin bridges may be greater in tumor cells relative to normal cells, it may not be practical to utilize this phenomenon as a diagnostic tool. The process of staining and mounting sample cells using indirect immunofluorescence is time consuming. Even though DAPI staining is quick, neither laboratory technique can guarantee the presence of the bridges under the fluorescence microscope. The rarity of chromatin bridges, even in cancerous cells, makes this phenomenon difficult to be widely accepted diagnostic marker for cancer.

Evaluation of the functional size of the developed IP  Evaluation of the functional size of the IP is based on a model of information system and functional requirements of users. Functional size of IP given by a set of five elements, each element of which is the appropriate functional unit. Functional units: * The number of use cases - C * Number of object types - E * The number of properties of object types - T * The number of interactions between types of objects - I * The number of node types - N Functional size is designated - SIZE = {C, E, T, I, N}  Assessment basic labor  Basic complexity of software development is based on the evaluation of complexity of each software development process. As the development processes used by the process model Rational Unified Process. Basic labor Sj development process with index j is calculated as follows: Sj = 1 / 165 ‚Ä¢ [C * Sj (C) + E * Sj (E) + T * Sj (T) + I * Sj (I) + N * Sj (N) Calculation made on the basis of the regulatory complexity of factors.  Definition of values of correction factors labor development and maintenance of fire suppression  Determining the values of correction factors for each development process is based on frequent adjustment factors characterizing the information system, the scope of its use and development process. Application of correction factors can improve the assessment data are available on an information system.  The calculation complexity, taking into account the development of the PES adjustment factors  On the basis of correction factors to the complexity of developing middleware complexity calculation is done taking into account the development of the PES adjustment factors.  Assessment term software development  Estimation of the development of an information system is on the basis of the values that are defined on the basis of a mathematical model based development time with teamwork.  Updating the development of middleware complexity by reducing the period of development  In the case of reducing the period of development defined in the previous section uses a method of adjusting labor input software, which is determined by the elasticity of difficulty.  Valuation Software Development  The cost of software development is calculated as the product of the complexity of software development at the flat rate of person-months by the authorized body for the planning period.

It is located in the Achrafieh district. Historically and popularly named after an old and prominent family of Achrafieh, Sassine Square was officially inaugurated in the early '90s under the auspices of President Elias Hrawi, Prime-Minister Rafic Hariri, Member of Parliament Michel Sassine, and the Municipal Council of Beirut City .,, Sassine Square is reputed to be a key social and commercial focal point of the Lebanese capital. Beyond being a residential area with a large pedestrian and transportation hub, it hosts renowned commercial and leisure centers, including the ABC Mall, attracting large numbers of visitors and tourists . Like the ancient Agora of the Greek towns, Sassine Square is becoming a meeting place where all the Lebanese from different cultures and confessions communicate daily. On 19 October 2012, a car bomb exploded in an alley leading to Sassine street next to Sassine Square killing 8 including Wissam al-Hassan and injuring 78.

Trolls in 1965, became Stained Glass when signed with RCA. L to R: Dennis, Bob, Roger, Jim The band was formed in 1964 by guitarist Roger Hedge, bass player Jim McPherson, guitarist Bob Rominger, and drummer Dennis Carrasco. The band was initially named \\"The Trolls.\\" All four members were vocalists, and, for its time, the group had an impressive vocal capability. This enabled them not only to sing accurate covers, but to create unique and melodic vocal arrangements on original material, setting them apart from most of their competition. Hedge put the group together, invested personal funds for equipment and promotion, and was the leader and business manager for the first couple of years. They performed in and around the San Jose area, releasing on their own, a McPherson tune, \\"Walkin' Shoes\\" which sold out in a matter of weeks in San Jose. They were soon scouted by an A&R; man from RCA, and subsequently signed to that label towards the end of 1966. Their early material was written mostly by McPherson, some written by Hedge, some by Rominger, with Carrasco co-writing a few. The songs were partially a mixture of rock, folk, blues, and Merseybeat, but had a distinctive original sound they planned to exploit for long careers. Some of their recordings met with minor success in northern California. RCA changed their band name to \\"Stained Glass\\". They had them record a Beatles tune, \\"If I Needed Someone\\", that was thought would not be released by the Beatles in the US. The record got enough play in late 1966 to justify a short tour of the East Coast a while later, with the group playing a few gigs, and doing some recording at the RCA studios in New York City. However, The Beatles released the track on their album, Yesterday and Today. In April 1967, the band scored a big hit record in San Jose with \\"We Got A Long Way To Go,\\" written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil. Later that year, Hedge was removed from the band for differences in musical direction. Their recording contract was taken over by Capitol in the Spring of 1968, issuing three singles, one of which was the non-LP song \\"Lady In Lace\\" written by McPherson and backed by \\"Soap and Turkey\\" written by Rominger. An LP, Crazy Horse Roads, was released in 1968, and had some controversial album art, in what appeared to be a photograph of the three of them all hanging by the neck from the branch of a tall tree. In 1969, Rominger was replaced by Tom Bryant for musical differences. A second album, Aurora, was released in 1969, which did not sell any better than the first one. Despite positive critical reviews, the singles nor the albums made any commercial impact, and the group disbanded in November 1969. Roger Hedge is a full-timer in a motorhome, travels around the country, and spends a lot of time in the San Jose area. Jim McPherson, who later co- wrote Jefferson Starship's song \\"Jane\\", died on June 24, 1985.Thedeadrockstarsclub.com - accessed March 23, 2012 Dennis Carrasco lives in the San Jose area, and is still an active musician. Tom Bryant lives on the East Coast. Bob Rominger, after a career flying fighters in the USAF, lives in Newnan, Georgia and is a flight instructor at Delta Air Lines. Today the group is regarded as one of the most underrated groups of the era, in what was a vibrant musical area of California in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Alec Palao, a passionate fan of Bay Area music in the 60's and 70's, spent a couple years doggedly obtaining early Trolls demos, unused album tracks from various companies holding the rights to their music, added some raw live tracks, and has put together a CD of the unreleased material for Ace Records. http://acerecords.co.uk/a-scene-in-between-1965-1967 The CD is available in the US December 2013.

As a Church of England cleric he was one of the leading figures of the 18th century evangelical revival and a key figure in the histories of the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion, the Free Church of England and the London Missionary Society. Early life and conversion to evangelical Christianity He was the son of a solicitor, who was able to have him educated at Truro Grammar School, but, after his father's death, his mother was too poor to send him to university and so, after an apprenticeship, he practised for some time as an apothecary and physician. Guided by George Conon, the master of Truro Grammar School, Haweis was introduced to the doctrines of the evangelical revival. Sponsored by the Reverend Joseph Jane of St Mary Magdalene Parish Church in Oxford, in 1748 he entered Christ's College. There he organised a prayer group often seen as a successor to the Wesleys' \\"Holy Club\\". After graduation, he was ordained in the Church of England by the Bishop of Oxford in 1757 to serve as curate to Joseph Jane. In 1762, he was appointed to the Lock Hospital, London, under the guidance of the chaplain, Martin Madan. At this time he met Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, and preached in many of her chapels. Although offered an incumbency in Philadelphia by George Whitefield, he opted instead to become rector of All Saints Church, Aldwincle, Northamptonshire, in 1764, retaining the living until his death in 1820. Countess of Huntingdon's connexion In 1774 he was appointed chaplain to the Countess of Huntingdon. He insisted that no one other than a Church of England cleric be allowed to preach in any chapel where he ministered. However, once the chapels forming the Countess of Huntingdon's Connection were forced to register as dissenting chapels, Haweis withdrew from her service. By her will, the Countess of Huntingdon left management of the Connexion to four trustees. The principal trustee appointed was, most unexpectedly, Thomas Haweis, who continued to preside over the Connexion, comprising at that time about 120 chapels, even though he continued as a Church of England priest. He made every effort to ensure the Connexion kept as close to the Church of England as was possible and that only the Book of Common Prayer was used. Many of these chapels became part of the Free Church of England in 1863.The Reverend Dr John Fenwick, \\"The Free Church of England\\", T & T Clark, London, 2004. Haweis was also one of the founding fathers of the Missionary Society. Works Haweis published several prose works, including: * Evangelical Principles and Practice (1762) * A History of the Church * A Translation of the New Testament (1795) * A Commentary on the Holy Bible * The Communicant's Spiritual Companion Haweis' 14 sermons in \\"Evangelical Principles and Practice\\" formed part of the standard training materials for Connexion ordinands, akin to John Wesley's 44 sermons. In the early 1790s, Haweis published two books with the same title: 'Carmina Christo, or Hymns to the Saviour. *A book of musicThomas Haweis, \\"Carmina Christo, or Hymns to the Savior\\", undated, 27 pp., probably published in 1791Nicholas Temperley. \\"The Hymn Tune Index\\", with seventeen hymn tunes composed by Haweis with words apparently written by Haweis. *A book of the words to hymns, published in 1792Thomas Haweis, \\"Carmina Christo; or Hymns to the Saviour\\", S.

Early life  Alfred Lyall was the youngest son of John Lyall (1752‚Äì1805), of Findon, Sussex, and Jane Comyn (c.1756‚Äì1824). His eldest brother George Lyall, sometime member of parliament for the City of London, became Chairman of the East India Company. Of his other brothers to reach maturity, John Lyall was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Bombay Army, at that time under the command of the East India Company, Haseldine Lyall joined the Royal Navy, while William Rowe Lyall entered the church and became Dean of Canterbury. Lyall was educated at Eton,The DNB claims that he was in the same form as the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, though this is disputed by Venn. matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in November 1813, and graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1818. Following this he spent some time studying and travelling on the Continent, with extended stays in Frankfurt and Geneva. Lyall was especially drawn to Italy, where he acquired some knowledge of art. He was an incessant reader, a serious student of history and philosophical works, but also a lover of poetry. By 1820 all of Lyall's surviving brothers and sisters were married and settled, while he was still a bachelor, living with his widowed mother at The Square, Findon, West Sussex. The property is known today as Grey Point. Findon records show that another property called Avery's, larger but less elegant, located a short distance away, also belonged to the Lyall family around this time.  Literary interests  Lyall literary leanings brought him an invitation to become editor of The Annual Register, an influential review, which he did from 1822 until 1827, returning to it again in 1837. The winter of 1825‚Äì1826 he passed visiting Madeira and Portugal. On his return he published in 1827 a comprehensive narrative entitled Rambles in Madeira and in Portugal. The book was accompanied by a folio volume of lithographic sketches by his friend and fellow traveller James Bulwer, an accomplished artist and keen naturalist. Subsequently, Lyall returned to Findon and immersed himself in metaphysical studies. His elder brother William Rowe Lyall, taking him in hand, steered him towards an ecclesiastical career. The church was considered a good choice for educated gentry without private means, as it offered a secure and comfortable benefice, while generally allowing the incumbent enough leisure time to pursue literary interests. Before yielding to his brother's advice Lyall wrote a second book, entitled A Review of the Principles of Necessary and Contingent Truth, published anonymously in 1830. This was a complex metaphysical discourse mainly attacking the theories of Hume and Reid. It was intended as an introduction to a projected work of several volumes that was never executed.  Career and family  Lyall took holy orders in 1829, and was appointed curate in Findon. Around the time of his ordination he became engaged to a 20-year-old girl from another old Scots family. Mary Drummond Broadwood (1809‚Äì1878) was the fourth daughter of James Schudi Broadwood (1778‚Äì1851) of nearby Lyne House, Surrey. Mary's paternal grandfather John Broadwood had established the Broadwood piano company after marrying the daughter of his business partner Burkat Schudi, the Swiss harpsichord maker. Mary's mother was Margaret Schaw Stewart (1778‚Äì1849), whose great-uncle was Daniel Stewart of Glenbuckie, best remembered for his association with Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Jacobite rising of 1745. The couple were married in December 1830 and by 1835 had moved to Coulsdon, where Alfred was acting as curate in charge. Subsequently, in 1837, he was appointed vicar of Godmersham in Kent. At the request of the publishers Rivingtons, Lyall resumed editorship of The Annual Register after moving to Godmersham, but was soon forced to relinquish the work due to health problems. Thereafter he continued to make sporadic literary contributions to other publications. Most notably in 1848 he was asked to collaborate on the Encyclopedia Metropolitana, an ambitious project conceived by Samuel Taylor Coleridge for the dissemination of universal knowledge, and published in a series of main divisions, over a number of years, each division consisting of multiple volumes. Lyall contributed to the Third Division: History of the Christian Church, covering the fourth to twelfth centuries, which appeared in 1850‚Äì51. In 1856 he published another book anonymously, entitled Agonistes, or Philosophical Strictures, which gained him a certain literary reputation. This was his third and last sole-authorship book, a collection of polemics attacking the high churchmen's enemies of the day, most particularly the philosophical theories of John Stuart Mill. Nine children of the marriage survived, two of which ‚Äì Alfred Comyn Lyall and James Broadwood Lyall ‚Äì had distinguished careers in British India, leading to Lieutenant-Governorships and knighthoods.  Later life  The family's final move came in 1848, when they relocated to Harbledown, a small parish located on a rise overlooking the cathedral city of Canterbury, where his older brother was now Dean. Alfred did not naturally have the makings of a parish priest ‚Äì he was too remote from the ordinary people of his congregation, a shortcoming his wife appears to have energetically made up for with charitable work. Despite being a little too 'broad' in his views for a country parson he seems to have given what was expected of him, and was by all accounts well liked and respected by the community he served. Nonetheless, it was wise to take the precaution of publishing his philosophical works anonymously, for it was not altogether appropriate that he should be seen by his congregation as engaging in metaphysical arguments on subjects deemed outside the realm of his parish duties. In any event, his intended circle of readers was undoubtedly well aware of the author's identity ‚Äì there was little need to advertise his writings further than necessary.

He is best known for painting embattled Wall Street CEOs, then exhibiting them in a public place and inviting pedestrians who pass by to annotate his work with Sharpies. His painting style is described as a Jackson Pollock/Chuck Close fusion. Because of the physical incorporation of public commentary on the face of his works, his Wall Street series expands the notion of traditional portraiture and becomes both painted depictions and historical documentation of the 2008 financial crisis and beyond. Raymond was born in New York City and grew up in Fairfax, Virginia. He attended college at the University of Virginia, where he studied both art and medieval English, receiving a Bachelor's degree in English in 1976. He first started painting Wall Street figures in 2006 when he painted a portrait of New York Stock Exchange CEO Richard Grasso during the NYSE compensation controversy. The first time he encouraged public annotation was in 2007, when he painted a portrait of News Corporation CEO Rupert Murdoch and exhibited it in front of the Dow Jones headquarters downtown. Since then, he has painted a wide range of subjects, including former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, former Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Cayne, former Lehman Brothers CEO Richard Fuld, former AIG CEO Hank Greenberg, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, and others. In 2011 he exhibited a second portrait of Murdoch and displayed it for comment outside News Corp headquarters in Midtown Manhattan New York. Raymond currently resides in Troy, NY and New York City.

Post & Blench (2011) reclassified it as Siangic, on the basis of clear correspondences with the Koro language in vocabulary that may not ultimately be of Sino-Tibetan origin. The implication is that Milang may, like other Siangic languages, harbour a non-Sino-Tibetan substrate, or may be a non-Sino-Tibetan language with Sino-Tibetan features acquired through prolonged contact, perhaps with the neighbouring and much larger Padam tribe, who speak an Eastern Tani language.

This type of cell is most commonly found in cancer cells and may arise from a variety of causes. Binucleation can be easily visualized through staining and microscopy. In general, binucleation has negative effects on cell viability and subsequent mitosis. They also occur physiologically in hepatocytes, chondrocytes and in fungi (dikaryon). Causes * Cleavage furrow regression: Cells divide and almost complete division but then the cleavage furrow begins to regress and the cells merge. This is thought to be caused by nondisjunction in chromosomes but the mechanism by which it occurs is not well understood. Cartoon of cleavage furrow formation and resolution. (A) depicts a normal cleavage furrow resolution. (B) depicts a cleavage furrow regression leading to a binucleated cell * Failed cytokinesis: The cell can fail to form a cleavage furrow, leading to both nuclei remaining in one cell. * Multipolar spindles: Cells contain three or more centrioles, resulting in multiple poles. This leads to the cells pulling chromosomes in many directions that end in multiple nuclei found in one cell. * Merging of newly formed cells: Two cells that have just finished cytokinesis merge into one another. This process is not entirely understood. Medical relevance =Detection= Binucleated cells can be observed using microscopy. Cells must first be fixed to arrest them wherever they are in the cell cycle and to keep their structures from degrading. Their nuclei and tubulin must next be made visible so that binucleation can be identified. DAPI is a dye that binds to DNA and fluoresces blue. For this reason, it is particularly useful at labeling nuclei. Antibody probes can be used to label tubulin fluorescently. The immunofluorescence may then be observed with microscopy. Binucleated cells are most easily identified by viewing tubulin, which surrounds the two nuclei in the cell. Binucleated cells may be mistaken for two cells in close proximity when viewing only nuclei. The binucleated cell above is an oral squamous cell carcinoma, cell line UPCI- SCC-103. A: The cancer cell treated with antibodies against tubulin. B: The same cancer cell stained with DAPI, highlighting the nuclei. C: Both photos superimposed. =Cancer= Binucleation occurs at a much higher rate in cancer cells. Other identifying features of cancer cells include multipolar spindles, micronuclei, and chromatin bridge. However, the increased rate of binucleation is usually not high enough to make it a conclusive diagnostic tool. Effects The fate of binucleated cells depends largely on the type of cell they originated from. A large percentage of binucleated cells arising from normal cells remain in interphase and never enter mitosis again. Cells that contain many mutations before they become binucleate are much more likely to proceed through subsequent rounds of mitosis. One study found that more than 50% of binucleated cells never entered mitosis again while greater than 95% of cancer cells were able to proceed through mitosis. Subsequent rounds of mitosis in binucleated cells have much higher rates of errors in chromosomal disjunction making it much more likely for cells to accumulate mutations.

Spindle formation is mostly conducted by the aster of the centrosome which it forms around itself. In a mitotic cell wherever two asters convene the formation of a spindle occurs. Mitosis consists of two independent processes: the intra-chromosomal and the extra-chromosomal (formation of spindle) changes both of these being in total coordination of each other. This cell as seen under immunofluorescence contains four centrosomes, two at each end, with their own spindle fibers attaching to chromosomes at the metaphase plate. In cancer cells, it has been observed that the formation of the spindles comes before when compared to the chromosomes. Because the prophase stage is brief, metaphase begins earlier than in normal cells. Chromosomes unable to reach the metaphase plate are stranded behind. These chromosomes still have asters attached to them and when met with other asters, form multiple spindles. Characteristics Cells with multipolar spindles are characterized by more than two centrosomes, usually four, and sometimes have a second metaphase plate. The multiple centrosomes segregate to opposite ends of the cell and the spindles attach to the chromosomes haphazardly. When anaphase occurs in these cells, the chromosomes are separated abnormally and results in aneuploidy of both daughter cells. This can lead to loss of cell viability and chromosomal instability. Presence in cancer cells The presence of multipolar spindles in cancer cells is one of many differences from normal cells which can be seen under a microscope. Cancer is defined by uncontrolled cell growth and malignant cells can undergo cell division with multipolar spindles because they can group multiple centrosomes into two spindles. These multipolar spindles are often assembled early in mitosis and rarely seen towards the later stages. This cell shows chromosomal aberration due to multipolar spindle attachment during metaphase under DAPI staining. Research has shown possible causes of formation of multipolar spindles. A possible causes of multipolar spindle formation involve regulation of protein kinase family known as Aurora kinase. Aurora kinase has two forms which are designated Aurora kinase A and Aurora kinase B. These proteins play a key role in mitosis and are regulated by phosphorylation and degradation. Deregulation of these proteins can lead to multiple centrosome formation and aneuploidy. In some human cancers, the expression and kinase activity of Aurora kinases have been up-regulated and has been looked into as a possible target for anti-cancer drugs.

Time Is a Memory) is a 1958 romantic drama film set in the China Burma India Theater of World War II and starring Victor Mature and Li Li-Hua. It represented a return to films for director Frank Borzage who had taken a 10-year hiatus before tackling this poignant, yet \\"offbeat\\" film. Plot In 1943, Captain Cliff Brandon (Victor Mature) is a cargo aircraft pilot supplying the Allied troops fighting the Japanese in China. When he is not flying or training his new crew hard, he is usually drinking in the local bar. One night, while stumbling home drunk, he encounters an old Chinese man who offers him a girl, his daughter Shu-Jen (Li Li-Hua). Brandon pays him, but when he sees the young woman, he tells the old man to keep her. When he wakes up the next morning, he finds Shu-Jen there. After Father Cairns (Ward Bond), a longtime resident of China, expresses his disapproval, Brandon tries his best to get rid of her, assigning the task to Ellington, a young Chinese boy who speaks English well. Ellington tries to sell her into prostitution, but Father Cairns happens by and takes Shu-Jen back to Brandon. The priest finds out that Shu-Jen's father was a farmer, but he lost his land to the Japanese invaders. Destitute, he sold his daughter's services for three months to feed the rest of his large family. Cairns tells Brandon that, if he were to send the girl back, the old man would return the desperately needed money. So, over Brandon's protests, the priest gets him to keep the girl; Brandon tells her that she is there only as a housekeeper. He makes Ellington his live-in interpreter. Over time, however, love blooms, and Shu-Jen becomes pregnant. They get married in a traditional Chinese ceremony. After he is transferred to another base, she gives birth to their daughter. Later, they are reunited. While Brandon is flying a mission, the base is attacked. The returning flight is ordered to divert to a different airfield, but Brandon disobeys and lands his aircraft. When he cannot locate his family, he orders his crew to leave with the survivors. Then he finds Shu-Jen and Ellington both dead, but his daughter is alive. He puts his dog tag around her neck, then mans an anti- aircraft gun and shoots down one or two enemy aircraft before he is killed. In 1957, his former crewmates and their wives anxiously await the arrival in the United States of Brandon's daughter, found in an orphanage by Father Cairns, still with her father's dog tag. The dichotomy of the burly Mature with the diminutive Li Li-Hua was evident in their scenes. The Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport aircraft was featured predominantly in the film.

Starting out with the working title of Time Is a Memory, the film was the first co-production of Batjac Productions and Romina Productions; the next and last co-production was Escort West (1959), a western, also starring Victor Mature. Borzage had been a successful director throughout the 1920s and reached his peak in the late silent and early sound era with such noted films as Seventh Heaven (1927), Street Angel (1928), Bad Girl (1931) and A Farewell to Arms (1932). During the 1940s, his films were not as well received and after the film noir, Moonrise (1948), Borzage had stopped directing. China Doll marked his return to Hollywood, although he only completed one more film, The Big Fisherman (1959), while his last effort, L'Atlantide (1961), had to be finished by others due to his illness.Herzogenrath 2009, p. 282. The film was also known as Time is a Memory and shooting started 15 August 1957.\\"STUDIO SUSPENDS KIM NOVAK PACT: Columbia Acts After She Refuses Paramount Role-- Debbie Reynolds to Star Nature Has Its Way\\" Special to The New York Times..

Los Angeles Times 27 Oct 1957: E1. Reception Considered a modest but interesting film, China Doll received favorable critical reviews. Variety noted the film had, \\"the warmth and humor of a romance between a burly air corps captain and a fragile oriental beauty.\\"\\"China Doll.\\" Variety, December 31, 1957. Howard Thompson, reviewer for The New York Times found it \\"(a) familiar war drama (that) has some winning aspects. ...

More recent reviews have treated China Doll as one of Borzage's best and a fitting penultimate testament to his career.Parish and Stanke 1980, p. 469. A lengthy review by Dan Callahan laid out the tropes of his earlier works were present: \\"China Doll is a delicate, spare, old man's movie, with quiet attention to character detail (even Ward Bond's priest is sensitive and thoughtful). There's a melancholy, pessimistic slant to the dialogue that isn't lingered over; the movements of the actors and the compositions are so stylized and presentational that it almost feels, at magical times, like a silent film. The ending is surprisingly violent, even brutal, but in a brief coda, Borzage observes the regeneration of beauty in the couple's child, even as he has shown the lovers' bond and their kindness viciously wiped out by war.\\"Callahan, Dan. \\"China Doll.\\" Slant Magazine, May 11, 2007.

She earned a Ph.D. in 1998 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. At the University of Denver she teaches courses in health communication, mass communication & public relations in many different graduate and undergraduate courses. Her main focus of work away from the University has been about increasing sanitation and clean water in slums such as Kibera. Early life Renee Botta earned her bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1987, she also earned her master's degree in 1989 as well as a Ph.D. in 1998 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She is currently the Chair of the Department of Media, Film & Journalism Studies at the University of Denver. Accomplishments Renee is well known as the author of the 7th-most frequently cited article in Journal of Communication, which is one of the most prestigious academic journals in the world that publishes research on communication. You can find her published work on the International Communication Association website., In 1999 Botta contributed an article called; 'Television images and adolescent girls' body image disturbance' in the Journal of Communication. The article talks about the impact the media has had on people's view of body image as well as studies that Botta has done on eating disorders. Then in 2003 while at Cleveland State University Botta was a part of the Fulbright Program, which is an International education exchange program. She taught at the University of Zambia and conducted research on how people communicate about AIDS in their everyday life. Currently Renee Botta is the chair and Associate Professor in the Department of Media, Film & Journalism Studies at the University of Denver. Renee Botta's primary areas of expertise include health communication, communication campaigns, health and media effects, and international heath communication. She is also highly qualified in many other areas, which include but are not limited to: advertising, broadcast media, social psychology, human communication, women's issues, health and wellness, and the sanitation and hygiene in Africa. Renee Botta has made contributions to the book Taking a Bite Out of Crime The Impact of the National Citizens Crime Prevention Media Campaign which goes over topics such as crime prevention scholars, law enforcement practitioners, and media experts, and focuses on examining the power of the media to influence people's attitudes and behaviors. Global Involvement Sanitation has become an increasingly large problem for small informal villages, better known as slums all around the world. The problem has increased to the point where one in every five children die before the age of five in the informal settlement of Kibera in Nairobi. The cause can be attributed to lack of clean water. Botta worked with other Faculty from the University of Denver, who include Randall Kuhn, Karen Loeb, and Peter Van Arsdale, as well as students from University of Nairobi to develop a sustainable and scalable model for sanitation and clean water. The main focus for Botta and her team were to improve the health conditions as well as conditions economically in Kibera through their model Research The solution that Botta and her team came up with consists of a \\"stool\\" method. The top 'seat' of the stool consist of facility, infrastructure, and the best technologies for waste removal, water storage, and water purification. A few of these modern technology are water catchment systems, bio-gas, and gravity bed leach fields. Their solution, however, consists of not only technology and infrastructure but also the support of governance from public and private sectors, business planning which influences sustainable management, and finally health and hygiene training for the people of the slums. These three areas make up the 'legs' of the stool. With this system, sustainable operations and improved health are promoted. Botta's research in Kibera helped to educate the native women living in the slums on how to treat their drinking water and improve the overall health of their families. The family's houses contained no running water. The DU project was granted $300,000. With that money they provided water, flushing toilets, and showers.

The earliest mention of Javakhians was found in Urartu sources, in the notes of king Argishti I of Urartu, 785 BC, as ‚ÄúZabakha‚Äù or ‚ÄúZabakhian‚Äù. It could mean that until the beginning of the 8th century B.C. Javakhians had been a self-governing tribe.

Members of the Black Liberation Army took over the aircraft in flight using weapons smuggled on board, including a handgun hidden inside a bible with its pages cut out to form a cavity. None of the hostages were killed during the hijacking. Five hijackers who had boarded with three children took over the aircraft. It flew to Miami as originally scheduled, where the 86 passenger hostages were released. The aircraft was then flown to Boston, where they picked up a flight engineer who was qualified to fly the plane overseas. Working with FBI agents on-site, Boston Delta airport maintenance foreman Ronald S. Fudge was chosen to refuel the plane and deliver the flight engineer to the plane. He also delivered a bag containing the $1 million ransom and other bags containing provisions requested by the hijackers, including cigarettes, apples, and ham and cheese sandwiches. After refuelling and taking on the engineer and provisions, the plane was dispatched to the runway and flew to Algeria. Algerian authorities seized the aircraft and ransom which were returned to the U.S. with the crew hostages, but the hijackers were released after a few days.  Return of crew and aircraft  On the evening of Wednesday, August 2, 1972, at a hurried 10-minute news conference after the DC-8's completion of the trip in Atlanta, the captain said he realized the aircraft was being hijacked when he left the cockpit to go to the lavatory and noticed a man aiming a gun at a stewardess. One of the hijackers cocked his pistol at a stewardess, Jayme Mays of Macon, Georgia, while the aircraft was in Miami. The stewardess had been with the airline less than two weeks. \\"They did it as a threat when they thought their instructions were not going to be carried out,\\" the captain said. The crew had an overnight stay in Barcelona, Spain after leaving Algiers. It was the first hijacking experience for each of them. In addition to the ransom, a Delta spokesman said the trip cost $21,600 for fuel and salaries for the crew. Delta identified the crew members as Capt. William Harold May, First Officer D.L. Henderson, and R.R. Kubal, and stewardesses Shirley Ann Morgan, Sherril Elsie Ross, Hanna Stout Mays, and Leanne Marie Arnfield.  Apprehension of hijackers  Four of the five hijackers were captured in Paris on May 26, 1976, and tried by the French courts. The remaining hijacker, George Wright, who had dressed as a priest during the hijacking, was arrested on September 26, 2011, in Sintra, Portugal.

He had served prior to this as a parish priest for Gonzales before serving as the bishop for both Bridgetown and Kingston. Gordon is known for his opposition to death sentences and favours peacemaking and bridge building in local disputes and gang violence. Life Charles Jason Gordon was born in Trinidad and Tobago on 17 March 1959. Gordon managed his father's failing business after his father died and managed to make it profitable all the while becoming involved in parish initiatives that led him to decide to enter the religious life. He had shown his engagement in projects teaching skills to displaced people with an emphasis on adolescents. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1991. In the late 1980s (after selling the business in 1991) and into the 1990s he studied at Mount Saint Benedict and later at the Louvain college in Belgium where he got his bachelor's and master's in theological studies before completing his doctorate in London. He later became involved in the Catholic Charismatic Renewal and was an active participant in their work. In 2003 he was made the parish priest for Gonzales. He received some awards for his project to bring peace in the eastern part of Port of Spain through the participation of all the stakeholders (including the gangs and their leaders). He mediated between communities in conflict and improved the standing of the Church while saving lives at the same time which earned him praise from Cardinal Peter Turkson. He celebrated a television Mass once a week and this reached out to as much as 50 000 people per week. Pope Benedict XVI named him as a Monsignor in 2009. In 2011 he was appointed as the Bishop of Kingstown in Saint Vincent and Grenadines and as the Bishop of Bridgetown in Barbados. He received his episcopal consecration from Joseph Everard Harris with Robert Rivas and Malcolm Patrick Galt serving as the co-consecrators on 21 September 2011 which came two months following his appointment. His consecration was celebrated in a tent in front of the Bridgetown Cathedral. Pope Francis later accepted his resignation from Kingstown in 2015 but continued to serve in Bridgetown until the pope appointed him as the Archbishop of Port of Spain in his homeland on 19 October 2017. He will be enthroned in his new archdiocese on 27 December 2017. In March 2016 he was charged with the physical (not sexualhttps://cruxnow.com/global- church/2017/11/19/charismatic-bishop-wields-gospel-caribbean-lethal-cocktail- crime-corruption/) assault of the altar server Junior Blackman (b. 1974) and the case was brought to the Magistrates' Court that December. Gordon appeared in court and was granted bail after asserting he was innocent of the charges. The Magistrate Kristie Cuffie-Sargeant dismissed the case on 14 July 2017 since Blackman was no longer interested in pursuing the case. On an annual basis he embarks on a week-long retreat for silence and solitude. Positions =Capital punishment= Gordon is against death sentences and considers it to be nothing more than \\"state-sponsored murder\\". The bishop elaborated that \\"it's still murder\\" regardless of who perpetrates it and that \\"its escalating the violence\\" rather than focusing on stopping it. He also continued that \\"all people have human dignity ... that dignity does not go away when we do something really bad\\".

Its development dates back to 1916, in the early stages of the French protectorate. The neighborhood is a cultural and religious center for Casablanca and for Morocco, as it hosts the Moroccan Ministry of Islamic Affairs as well as bookstores of important Moroccan and Arabic publishing houses. The many traditional and historic buildings also make the Hubous a popular tourist destination.  Name  The word ·∏•ubous (ÿ≠Ÿèÿ®Ÿàÿ≥) in Arabic means a waqf (ŸàŸéŸÇŸíŸÅ), an inalienable charitable real estate endowment for Islamic religious purposes or charity. A Moroccan Jewish man named Haim Ben- Dahan apparently gifted the land to the sultan, who allocated it to the Ministry of Islamic Affairs.  History  Looking toward Mahkamat al-Pasha. In 1916, almost a decade after the French invasion and occupation of Casablanca and four years after the official establishment of the French protectorate, General Lyautey's handpicked urban planner Henri Prost and his team decided to build a \\"nouvele ville indig√®ne,\\" a new medina near the sultan's palace to the east of the new center. The Mosque of Sultan Yusuf was designed by Auguste Cadet and Edmond Brion, and the Mosque of Sultan Muhammad Bin Yusuf was designed by Cadet and built from 1934 to 1936. Mahkamat al- Pasha, one of the most important buildings in the Hubous, was built 1941‚Äì1942.

Biography =Early life and education= Liselotte Grschebina was born Liselotte Billigheimer in 1908 in Karlsruhe, Germany. Her parents were Rosa and Otto Billigheimer, a Jewish couple. Her father was killed in 1916 while serving in the German army. In 1925‚Äì29 Grschebina studied painting and graphic design at the local art academy, Badische Landeskunstschule, Karlsruhe (BLK) and studied commercial photography at the School of Applied Arts in Stuttgart. =Beginnings in Germany= In January 1932 Grschebina opens Bilfoto, her own studio, announcing her specialisation in child photography, and takes on students. In 1933, following the Nazis come to power and the restrictions on professional freedom for Jews, Grschebina closed her studio. Before leaving Germany, she marries Dr. Jacob (Jasha) Grschebin. =Mandate Palestine and Israel= The Grschebin couple reaches Tel Aviv in March 1934. The same year, Grschebina opens the Ishon studio on Allenby Street with her friend Ellen Rosenberg (Auerbach), previously a partner in the Berlin photographic studio ringl + pit. In 1936 the Ishon studio is closed when Rosenberg leaves the country; Grschebina continues to work from her home. In 1934-47 Grschebina is appointed the official photographer for the Zionist women's organization WIZO. In 1939, together with fellow photographers of German origin gathered in Tel Aviv, establishes the Palestine Professional Photographers Association (PPPA), the first independent photographers organisation in the country. Between the 1930s to 1950s Grschebina takes photographs for Palestine Railways, the large dairy company Tnuva, kibbutzim, and various private businesses. Liselotte Grschebina died in Petah Tikva at the age of 86, on 14 June 1994. Style Grschebina arrived in Palestine in 1934, a trained professional profoundly influenced by the revolutionary movements of the Weimer Republic: New Objectivity in painting and New Vision in photography, as well as by a number of prominent professors, including Karl Hubbuch and :de:Wilhelm Schnarrenberger. Unlike many of her colleagues in Palestine, who sought their identities in the collective Zionist endeavor by documenting and extolling it in their work, Grschebina did not use photography as a means of forming her identity. She came with a full-fledged style and remained committed to Weimar artistic ideals and principles in her new home, where she continued to apply and develop them. This exhibition premieres a major selection from among the 1,800 photographs that were given to the Israel Museum and unveils her life and work to the public for the first time. Grschebina's artistic roots clearly lay in New Vision, which defined photography as an artistic field in its own right and called on camera artists to portray subjects in a new, different way in order to convey their unique qualities and their essence. She did this through striking vantage points and strong diagonals, making masterful use of mirrors, reflections, and plays of light and shadow to create geometric shapes and to endow her photographs with atmosphere, appeal, and meaning. In Germany, most of her photographs ‚Äì usually advertising commissions ‚Äì were taken in the studio. In the land of Israel, she also worked outdoors, observing those around her with a clear, impartial eye. She photographed people going about their daily routine, unaffected by the presence of the camera. The viewer of her pictures feels like an outsider looking in, gaining a new, objective perspective on the subject: the \\"objective portrait . . . not encumbered with subjective intention\\" wherein, according to New Vision photographer L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, lies the genius of photography.Caplan, Yudit, Woman with a Camera: Liselotte Grschebina, Germany 1908 ‚Äì Israel 1994, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 2008 Legacy The photographs of Liselotte Grschebina, rediscovered casually, almost miraculously, in a cupboard in Tel Aviv, reveal a talent that might otherwise have remained forgotten.

Withdrawal of proposed rule to reclassify the Pahrump Poolfish (Empetrichthys latos) from endangered to threatened status. (April 2, 2004). Federal Register. Retrieved September 28, 2011. It is endemic to Nevada in the United States, where it was limited to the Pahrump Valley near the California border. It nearly became extinct due to habitat destruction and no longer occurs there. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States.USFWS. Empetrichthys latos Recovery Plan. (March 1980). Retrieved September 28, 2011. This fish is reaches a maximum length of about . It has its dorsal and anal fins far back on its body and it lacks pelvic fins. The head is depressed in front and the mouth is wide. The jaws are unequal, the lower projecting farther than the upper. The fish is greenish on its back and silvery green on the belly. The male takes on a blue tinge during spawning. It is omnivorous, feeding on varied plant and animal material. Spawning is most common in spring but can occur at any time of the year when conditions are right. Adults are more active at night, but juveniles appear to be more active during the day. The native habitat of the fish was made up of pools and marshes. The water at one pool was a constant . This may be the optimal temperature for the species but it can tolerate a relatively wide range of temperatures. It has been noted to survive under a layer of ice during winter. The water is alkaline. This species is the only surviving member of genus Empetrichthys, the other, the Ash Meadows killifish (Empetrichthys merriami), having become extinct in the 1940s. There were three subspecies of E. latos, two of which are extinct today. Each occurred in a different spring in the Pahrump Valley. The Raycraft Ranch springfish (E. latos concavus) became extinct when its spring was destroyed in the 1950s. The Pahrump Ranch killifish (E. latos pahrump) disappeared when its spring was pumped dry in 1958. The remaining fish is the nominal subspecies E. latos latos. It is known simply as the Pahrump poolfish. In 1975 the Pahrump poolfish was extirpated from its habitat, Manse Spring, when it experienced competition from the introduced goldfish, some vegetation was removed, and the spring dried up due to groundwater pumping nearby. On noting its impending extinction, scientists and officials removed specimens of the fish and transplanted them into three pools in different locations in Nevada. When the official recovery plan for the species was published by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 1980, it aimed to manage and protect the three transplanted populations. The fish has not been returned to its native habitat at Manse Spring because the area is under development and the water supply is not reliable. Though the fish reproduced successfully and appeared to thrive in its new pools, it faced a number of challenges there. Flooding destroyed one of the pools, vandalism killed specimens at another, and the unauthorized introduction of mosquitofish and crawfish further threatened the fish. Some fish were transplanted into a reservoir to replace the flooded population, but the USFWS had to intervene when Nevada State Parks officials planned to dredge the pond. Today the populations remain, but the habitat must be artificially maintained at times. As of 2004 only one population is stable. Threats still exist from groundwater pumping, vandalism, and introduced species. In 2018, the Southern Nevada Water Authority is planning on establishing a refuge population into ponds at the Las Vegas Springs Preserve. The USFWS still considers the species to be \\"in imminent danger of extinction\\" and is maintaining its endangered status. References External links *Empetrichthys latos.

It is considered an important food fish where it occurs, reaching up to in total length and in weight. This fish spawns in the summer, mainly in streams in places like the mid-Amur, Songhua and Ussuri basins. In the Amur, young are found in the lower sections. They mature after 6 years, and after this time they tend to live in floodplains and winter in the main rivers. They mainly consume smaller fish. From the 1970s to 1990s, the population of yellowcheeks drastically decreased, but in the 2010s the population has been observed to increase. The species appears to have disappeared entirely from the Yellow River basin. Major threats are dam construction, pollution, and overfishing. However, little is known about the overall trends of this species. As of 2012 there were no conservation measures in place, and it is unknown if such measures are necessary.

Biography Shahar Marcus was born in 1971 at Petach Tikva. His mother was a teacher and father a Diamond dealer. His first child was born during 2011 and in 2014 his youngest daughter joined the family. They currently reside in Tel Aviv, Israel. In his early works Marcus dealt with the exploration of his own body and its limitations; his body serving as an instrument or rather a platform for the conducting of experiments with various perishable materials, such as dough, juice, ice and fire. While his early video-performances feature himself along with other artists, with whom he had collaborated in the past, in his recent works, Marcus appears by himself, while embodying different roles and characters. His most recent works he deal with local political issues, by approaching iconic Israeli landmarks with a critical and humorous point of view (like \\"1,2,3,Herring\\"). Thus, Marcus reflects on his own heritage, environment and the creation of local historical narratives. He aspires to tackle a local issue, and convey it through universal visual means (\\"The Curator\\", \\"King of Falafel\\", \\"Homecoming Artist and Leap of Faith\\"). As of 2012, Marcus has been collaborating with the Turkish-German performance artist Nezaket Ekici. The both of them have been employing their own bodies as a medium to build up forces and energies, to resolve tensions and conflicts. By pushing their own physical limits, they cause their works to revolve in no small measure around the limits of cultural and political difference. (Methexis, Sand Clock, Salt Dinner).

Murray (People of the State of California v. Conrad Robert Murray) was the American criminal trial of Michael Jackson's personal physician, Conrad Murray, who was charged with involuntary manslaughter for the pop singer's death on June 25, 2009, from a massive overdose of the general anesthetic propofol. The trial, which started on September 27, 2011, was held in the Los Angeles County Superior Court in Los Angeles, California, before Judge Michael Pastor as a televised proceeding, reaching a guilty verdict on November 7, 2011. The prosecutors in the case (David Walgren and Deborah Brazil, both Los Angeles deputy district attorneys), in their opening statement, told jurors: \\"misplaced trust in the hands of Murray cost Jackson his life\\". Murray's defense counsel (Edward Chernoff, Matthew Alford, J. Michael Flanagan and Nareg Gourjian) claimed Jackson, who was tired and under pressure from rehearsing, took eight tablets of lorazepam (Ativan), a sedative. \\"When Dr. Murray left the room, Jackson self-administered a dose of propofol that, with the lorazepam, created a perfect storm in his body that ultimately killed him. The whole thing is tragic, but the evidence is not that Dr. Murray did it\\", Chernoff said. Testimony during the trial showed Murray stayed with Jackson at least six nights a week and was regularly asked‚Äîand sometimes begged‚Äîby the insomniac singer to give him drugs powerful enough to put him to sleep. Murray told authorities Jackson was especially eager to be administered propofol, a surgical anesthetic that put him to sleep when other powerful sedatives could not. Testimony indicated that propofol, in conjunction with other drugs in Jackson's system, had played the key role in his death. In 2011, the jury found Murray guilty after about eight hours of deliberation, and he was sentenced to four years in prison, but was released after two years on October 28, 2013, owing to prison overcrowding and good behavior. Timeline of prosecution case =September 27, 2011: Day 1= Both sides made opening statements. The jury viewed a photograph of Jackson lying on a gurney, taken minutes after he was declared dead. The jury also heard a tape of Jackson's slurred speech near the end of his life. Murray's attorney told the court that Murray is not to blame for Jackson's death, that Jackson gave himself a dose of drugs that killed him so quickly Jackson \\"didn't even have time to close his eyes\\". \\"What happened during that time frame is that the acts and omissions of Michael Jackson's personal doctor Conrad Murray directly led to his premature death at age 50,\\" prosecutor Walgren said. \\"That misplaced trust in Conrad Murray cost Michael Jackson his life.\\" The first witness, Kenny Ortega, was called to testify. =September 28, 2011: Day 2= Michael Amir Williams, known as Jackson's personal assistant, testified. =September 29, 2011: Day 3= Two former members of Jackson's staff, bodyguard Alberto Alvarez and Chef Kai Chase, took the stand. Alvarez was the first person into Jackson's bedroom after Murray raised the alarm. He indicated that Murray asked him to place vials from Jackson's bedside cabinet in a bag and remove an IV drip (containing saline solution) from its stand and what appeared to be a propofol bottle, according to Alvarez, before Murray asked him to phone 911. =September 30, 2011: Day 4= Bob Johnson, owner of a company that manufactures pulse oximeters, testified first. The next witness was a former patient of Murray's, Robert Russell from Las Vegas. The third witness was the first paramedic to enter Jackson's house and bedroom, Richard Senneff. The fourth witness was paramedic Martin Blount. Dr. Richelle Cooper, an emergency room physician at UCLA Medical Center, testified fifth. Although not pronounced dead until sometime after reaching the hospital (2:26 pm), the paramedics never saw any signs of life from the time they first entered Jackson's bedroom (12:26 pm). =October 3, 2011: Day 5= Cooper continued testifying. According to Cooper, drugs including intravenous sodium bicarbonate, vasopressin, epinephrine, atropine, and dopamine were used during the attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation of Jackson in the trauma bay of UCLA Medical Center. From the time Jackson was under the care of Cooper until Jackson's death was pronounced, continuous chest compressions and \\"bagging\\" were conducted via an endotracheal tube. Cooper testified that Jackson was clinically dead upon arriving at the hospital, and that Murray had told her he had given Jackson 2 mg of lorazepam (a benzodiazepine) sometime earlier that day, then another 2 mg, which caused the cardiac arrest. During cross-examination, Cooper was asked about the effect of propofol as a sedative. She said about a \\"milligram per kilogram\\" would be the starting dose on a patient and would be administered into the patient's arm through an injection port. The administration would take place over a period of \\"a minute to a minute and a half\\", and personnel would constantly monitor the patient. She further testified that sedation would be expected to last 10 minutes. When asked what effect \\"25 mg over 3‚Äì5 minutes\\" would have on a patient, she responded that she would not expect that to have any effect. When asked about administering propofol through an IV drip, she said that only occurs if the patient is intubated and the desired effect is deep sedation. Next to the stand were employees from phone companies AT&T; and Sprint Nextel, who were asked to guide the jury through the meaning of various data on Murray's phone records from June 25, 2009. Dr. Thao Nguyen, a cardiologist from UCLA Medical Center, testified that she was paged on that day to help with the care of \\"a V.I.P. patient, named Michael Jackson.\\" She was under the impression the patient was \\"coding,\\" meaning resuscitation was partially successful. She further testified that when Murray arrived at the hospital, he was \\"desperate and devastated,\\" and he told the staff: \\"Do not give up easily, try to save his life.\\" Nguyen's testimony then turned to the effects of Ativan (brand name of lorazepam), the drug that Murray claimed started Jackson's cardiac arrest. According to Nguyen, Ativan acts on the brain to \\"make you sleep\\" and can cause respiratory apnea (\\"not breathing\\"). She testified that \\"you do not typically use narcotics (such as Ativan) to treat insomnia, they are used for sedation,\\" but, when cross-examined, she admitted that it is one of its uses. Testimony then turned to the use of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) as an antidote to Ativan. Ativan would cause the patient to have slurred speech but propofol would not, it is \\"quick onset, quick offset.\\" Propofol is only to be used in a hospital, \\"not just any hospital room, but only in an intensive care unit or procedure room, by specialist personnel\\" (an anesthesiologist present throughout its use). Constant monitoring is required because [we] \\"wouldn't be sure of the patient's tolerance threshold\\" to the drug and there should be a crash cart at hand. Nguyen also testified that Murray never mentioned propofol. =October 4, 2011: Day 6= Stacey Ruggles, Michelle Bella, and Sade Anding, each of whom was in contact with Murray on June 25, 2009, testified about their relationships with him. Anding, who is thought to be the person Murray was speaking to when he noticed Jackson was not breathing, said she heard coughing and mumbling after Murray stopped speaking on the call, which lasted \\"three or four minutes\\". Murray's girlfriend, Nicole Alvarez, is currently living with Murray in Santa Monica. She is the mother of Murray's son born in March 2009. They met in Las Vegas in 2005, where she was working in a strip club. She testified about visits to Jackson's home and her plans to travel to London with Murray for the concerts. She also told how she was accepting FedEx packages at her home in Murray's name. Prosecution provided FedEx receipts to the court and Alvarez testified that they were accurate and that her signature was on some of them. Alvarez was the person Murray called while he was in the ambulance with Jackson's body. He showed up at her apartment later that evening. Tim Lopez, employed by Applied pharmacy services, liaised with Murray over purchases of propofol and Benoquin. He testified about orders Murray placed for propofol and for Benoquin cream, to use in the treatment of the disease vitiligo, from April to June 2009 (225 vials in total). Murray's propofol orders were being routed through his Las Vegas office and then shipped to Alvarez's apartment in Los Angeles. He was also ordering increasing quantities of propofol as time went on. =October 5, 2011: Day 7= Sally Hirschberg, a customer service and sales employee of Seacoast Medical, a pharmaceutical distributor in Omaha, Nebraska, was first called to the stand. Testimony included details of Murray's dealing with the firm: he opened an account December 2006; ordered various medical items during April 2009, including \\"safe site\\" IV set; and cancelled an order for condom catheters on June 26, 2009. On cross-examination, Hirschberg testified that the items Murray was ordering were not unusual for a medical practice specializing in cardiovascular treatment. Stephen Marx, a computer forensics examiner working for the DEA in Virginia during June 2009, testified next. He performed an analysis of Murray's iPhone and extracted screenshots, emails, and recordings from it. The emails pertained to medical handwritten notes for patients named Omar Arnold and Paul Farance, in which both names were aliases that Jackson utilized under Murray's care. One email asked Murray: \\"Is that him too?\\" Emails pertaining to Jackson's insurance while in London were also shown. The insurance company confirmed that Murray was Jackson's only doctor since 2006, and that they wanted very thorough medical reports and records and a review of Jackson during rehearsals before agreeing to cover him. It was heard that Jackson refused authorization to release his medical records. During the testimony, a recording was played of a conversation between Murray and Jackson from May 10, 2009. The recording featured Jackson's talking about healing the world and helping children because he did not have a childhood, in slurred, almost incomprehensible speech. The recording ended with Murray's asking: \\"Are you OK?\\" and with Jackson's replying \\"I am asleep.\\" Next to testify was Elissa Fleak, a Los Angeles County coroner for the past eight years. Her duties include investigating deaths (natural/suicide/homicide) and working with medical examiners to determine causes of death. Fleak went to UCLA Medical Center at 5:20 pm on June 25, 2009, to examine Jackson's body and get information surrounding his death. She examined the body in a private room, as well as notes and photographs, and looked for external wounds/injuries; any sign to signal the cause of death. None were found. She took four vials of Jackson's blood for toxicology testing and went to Jackson's house to perform an onsite investigation. While in Jackson's bedroom, she found an empty 20 ml propofol bottle and an empty 5 ml flumazenil bottle on the floor next to the bedside table. She also recovered other prescription drugs, such as diazepam, lorazepam, and tamsulosin (Flomax), one bottle prescribed to Mick Jackson, and some medicines prescribed by Alan Metzger. Other drugs found were Benoquin, hydroquinone, lidocaine, and an oxygen tank beside the bed. Medical equipment recovered included alcohol prep pads, a 10cc syringe with the needle removed, an IV catheter on the floor under an Ambu bag, an aspirin bottle, a syringe box, catheters, a jug of urine, and an IV pole with a saline bag and tubing draped over it. Three bags were recovered: a black bag containing a Starline blood pressure cuff box and 3 bottles of lidocaine; a blue Costco bag (found in the closet) containing \\"medical debris\\" including a pulse oximeter, a lanyard, vials, an empty 20 ml propofol bottle, two bottles of midazolam, an opened IV administration set, a urinary leg bag, a wideband bag, two empty dressing bags, two empty catheter bags, opened alcohol prep pads, dressing backings, an empty syringe packet, four vial tops and a needle cap. Also the saline bag with a cut in it containing the \\"more or less empty\\" 100 ml propofol bottle that Alvarez recalls removing from the IV stand; and a light blue \\"baby essentials\\" bag, containing an array of bottles that included 100 ml propofol and 20 ml propofol bottles (filled to various levels, some opened, some closed), lorazepam, flumazenil, lidocaine, and Benoquin. Murray's business cards from his Houston practice were also found. =October 6, 2011: Day 8= Fleak confirmed the presence of an IV stand, a saline infusion set, and a depressed syringe in a y-port connected to the tubing beside Jackson's bed. The court heard that she issued a subpoena to Murray for Jackson's medical records, and only the records pre-2009 were submitted to her. During cross-examination, Chernoff asked Fleak about a number of \\"mistakes\\" during her examination, such as picking up a bottle from the floor before photographing it, ignoring the presence of the IV stand, not taking a picture of the propofol bottle inside the cut saline bag (she said she took it out to see what it was then photographed it), and destroying her handwritten notes from June 25, 2009. It was heard that Fleak did not mention the propofol bottle was inside the saline bag in writing until March 2011. The defense suggested that she changed her story to fall into line with other witness' stories regarding the bottle in the bag. Next called to testify was Dan Anderson, chief toxicologist at the coroner's office. He has 21 years' experience in this field. He tested blood and urine taken from Jackson in UCLA and at autopsy on June 26, 2009. Blood taken from a femoral vein showed propofol (2.6 Œºg/ml), lidocaine (0.84 Œºg/ml) and lorazepam (0.169 Œºg/ml). Blood taken from Jackson's heart showed propofol (3.2 Œºg/ml), lidocaine (0.68 Œºg/ml), diazepam (<0.1 Œºg/ml), lorazepam (0.162 Œºg/ml), midazolam (4.6 Œºg/ml) and a hemoglobin percentage of 5.1%. Vials of blood taken from Jackson at UCLA were found to contain propofol (4.1 Œºg/ml). Other results included liver (lidocaine (0.45 Œºg/ml), propofol (6.2 Œºg/ml)), stomach (lidocaine (1.6 Œºg/ml), propofol (0.13 Œºg/ml)), urine (jug found in bedroom and more than 500 ml collected at autopsy) (lorazepam, lidocaine, midazolam, propofol and ephedrine), vitreous humour (propofol (0.4 Œºg/ml)). Propofol was found in all eight specimen samples. Also tested were the 10cc syringe and plunger, the syringe barrel, the fluid in the syringe and the IV tubing (propofol and lidocaine found). No alcohol, barbiturates, cocaine, sedative hypnotics, marijuana, methamphetamine, opiates, codeine, morphine, hydrocodone, or Demerol were found in the samples. During cross-examination it was heard that post-mortem redistribution occurs in the blood stream, and hence different concentrations of drugs were found in different parts of the body from which they initially entered. It was also heard that: the jug of urine from the bedroom could be from days before and might not even be Jackson's urine, that the low amount of propofol in the vitreous humour was negligible, and that there was no propofol found on the IV pole. The only place it was found was in the lower portion of the tubing and the syringe; the drug proportions couldn't be ascertained. =October 7, 2011: Day 9= Dan Anderson continued to answer questions about the levels of drugs in Jackson's system and the substances found in the IV bag (no drugs), tubing, and syringes (in which propofol and lidocaine found) found in Jackson's bedroom. It was heard that the level of lorazepam in Jackson's system (0.162 Œºg/ml) was within the therapeutic range (0.1‚Äì0.2 Œºg/ml), the level at which it has its desired effect. It was shown that the total amount of lorazepam in Jackson's stomach was 0.046599 mg; about 1/43 of a 2 mg tablet. It was noted that if there were a lot of a certain substance in the blood but not much in the urine then it was recently taken; the same can be said for substances in the stomach. Fleak was recalled to clarify some issues with photographs and the placement of items in the photographs that she testified to on October 6. Next called to testify was Detective Scott Smith of the LAPD. With 24 years experience in the LAPD (20 years as a detective), he was working for the Robbery Homicide division during June 2009. On June 25, 2009, he entered the UCLA emergency room at 4:25 pm and stayed until 7 pm. In that time he did not see Murray, but collected CCTV footage of Murray's leaving the ER at 4:38 pm and appearing in the west lobby at 5:02 pm. Before Smith left, he had brief interviews with Mohammed and Alvarez. Smith then went to the Carolwood residence to assist and support the coroner's investigators. It was heard that everyone left the house at 9:30 pm, and Jackson's security was left in charge of the house. On June 26, Smith attended the autopsy, which was deferred pending toxicology, and then went back to the house to further investigate because the Jackson family had handed some items to the police (some rotten cannabis in a shaving kit, some lotion, paper, an envelope, and other \\"debris\\"). Inside the shaving kit was a bottle of temazepam prescribed by Murray to Omar Arnold dated September 26, 2008. While at the house, Smith found some empty pill bottles in the master bathroom. While Smith was on the stand, a two-hour police interview with Murray, taken 48 hours after Jackson's death, was played to the court. It was held in the Ritz Carlton hotel, and Orlando Martinez asked the questions; Chernoff was present. It was heard that Murray first met Jackson in 2006, a security guard (a patient's son) asked Murray to meet him, and Murray first treated Jackson's children for the flu. Amir (Michael Amir Williams) told Murray that Michael Jackson would like Murray to be there for the concerts. Murray understood that he would be an employee of Jackson's, but then discovered his salary would be paid by AEG Live. Murray said Jackson was not a person who ate well, and he was probably seeing doctors for issues he did not disclose to Murray. It was heard that Murray spent six nights a week at Jackson's house, only having Sundays off, and it was usually just Murray, Jackson, and Jacksons' children in the house. Among Murray's claims in his taped statement to police: * Amir phoned to say Jackson was finished with rehearsals at 12:10 am and to meet him at the house. Amir got there at 12:30 am; Jackson arrived between 1:05 and 1:10 am. * Jackson showered; Murray put cream on his body because of dermatological issues. * At 1:30 am, Murray put an IV saline drip in his leg to treat for dehydration from dancing at rehearsals and gave the sedative Valium (10 mg, 1 tablet, orally taken) to help him sleep. He did not sleep. * At 2:00 am, Murray gave Jackson 2 mg of lorazepam diluted in saline and pushed slowly over 2‚Äì3 minutes into the IV line. He observed Jackson stay wide awake for an hour. Jackson complained he could not sleep. * At 3:00 am, Murray gave Jackson 2 mg midazolam. Jackson was still awake. Murray tried to get Jackson to meditate and turned down the lights and music. His eyes closed and he fell asleep between 3:20 and 3:30 am; 10‚Äì12 minutes later he was awake again. * At 4:30 am, Jackson was still awake and complaining, \\"need to sleep, must be ready for the concerts, would have to cancel the trip because I cannot function if I don't get sleep.\\" \\"The medicine doesn't work.\\" * At 5:00 am, Murray gave Jackson 2 mg lorazepam. Jackson was still awake and complaining about canceling rehearsals, not satisfying fans and there being much pressure. * At 6:00‚Äì6:30 am, Jackson was still awake and still talking. * At 7:30 am, Murray gave Jackson 2 mg midazolam. It had no effect, and he wondered why Jackson was not responding. * At 10:00 am, Jackson was still awake. He said he wanted \\"milk\\" (propofol) so he could sleep, saying \\"I know it works.\\" * At 10:40 am, Jackson said \\"Just make me sleep, no matter what\\", \\"I can't function without sleep\\", \\"I have to cancel concerts.\\" Murray claimed that he was under a lot of pressure from Jackson, so he switched to propofol. * At 10:50 am, Murray administered Jackson a dosage of 25 mg propofol diluted with Lidocaine slowly infused over 3‚Äì5 minutes. Lidocaine was used because the propofol could burn the vessels. It had a very quick effect. * Because of the other drugs in his system, Murray gave 25 mg (the usual dose was 50 mg) before starting the drip to keep him asleep. Murray was asked how often had he given Jackson the \\"milk\\", and he answered: \\"2 months, every day.\\" He was also asked: \\"before you became his doctor, did you know he was taking it?\\" Murray said he was surprised about how much Jackson knew about the drug. He knew it worked, he knew how much to put in, knew how to inject it, he said it was the only thing that worked, the lidocaine was needed with it to stop it burning (Jackson called it anti-burn, \\"anti-burn makes it comfortable\\"). Other doctors allowed Jackson to push it himself, and Murray \\"wouldn't allow it\\" because it made him sleep instantly. Murray kept telling Jackson that it was artificial sleep. Murray said that Jackson's veins were coarse, dried up and filled with clots caused by too much IV use over time. He could not get an IV in his hands. * At 11:00 am, Jackson was asleep but not snoring. Usually he would be in a deep sleep and snoring, so Murray thought Jackson would wake up again. Murray watched Jackson. Oxygen saturation was 90, heart rate was 70. * At 11:18 am, Murray felt comfortable, so he got up to go to the bathroom and took some of Jackson's urine with him. Murray said he was gone for two minutes. When Murray returned, Jackson was not breathing and his heart rate was 122. He felt a pulse in Jackson's femoral artery; his body was warm and had not changed color. Murray started CPR and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Jackson's chest was rising and falling upon ventilation. Murray looked at the telephone then remembered none of them worked. He could not move Jackson off the bed to do CPR, so he placed his left hand under Jackson's body to continue chest compression. Murray said he did not call 911 because he did not know Jackson's ZIP code. He called Amir to tell security to come up. There was no pulse now, so he lifted his legs to try to get the blood flowing to his heart. He then infused 0.2 mg flumazenil into the IV to try to counteract the lorazepam. He went to the landing to meet Alvarez. Alvarez came in, and Murray told him to call 911 and to help move Jackson onto the floor, which he did. Murray was still giving CPR and mouth-to-mouth when the paramedics arrived and intubated him. They saw PEA (pulseless electrical activity, they could see a beat but there was no contraction) and administered atropine, epinephrine and sodium bicarbonate. After 20 minutes, the paramedics (while in contact with UCLA) wanted to call time of death. However, Murray got them to transfer care to him. Murray said \\"I didn't want to give up, I love Michael, he was my friend, I wanted to help, he was a single parent, thinking about the children, thinking about my own children.\\" CPR continued down to the ambulance; once in the trauma bay, medical personnel tried for at least an hour. \\"[The emergency medical staff] would have given up without me,\\" said Murray. They pronounced him dead, but Murray would not sign the death certificate because he did not know the cause of death. * Chernoff prompted Murray to tell the police about the last three days. Murray said Jackson wanted \\"milk\\" nightly, but Murray did not want to administer it, because it was not natural sleep and could be a hazard. \\"I tried to wean him off it with his knowledge to have more natural sleep. I had never seen any study where someone had been addicted to propofol.\\" Murray gave him lesser amounts (lower doses and lower drip rate) and gave lorazepam and midazolam as well. Jackson told Murray he wanted to \\"go all the way, other doctors would do it.\\" Murray said that the lorazepam and midazolam were not working. Jackson was suffering from withdrawal, and his mind was forcing him to stay awake. Murray stated he \\"tried all night, but nothing would work. Gave him propofol just so he would get a couple of hours of sleep.\\" \\"I didn't want to hurt him, he was my friend, didn't want MJ to fail, I cared about his writing and his producing, I tried to wean him off, MJ was a bit restless, but it was working.\\" =October 11, 2011: Day 10= The proceedings began with the conclusion of the recording of Murray's interview with the police from 48 hours after Jackson's death. Afterwards, Smith continued his testimony. Smith never mentioned in any notes referencing a propofol bottle being inside a saline bag during searches of Jackson's home in June 2009. He saw the propofol bottle beside a cut saline bag after Fleak had removed them from the Costco bag and it was the only saline bag found. Search warrants were executed of Murray's house in Las Vegas, offices in Las Vegas and Houston, his girlfriend's apartment, his warehouse and his car, and no propofol was found. During brief statements taken from Mohammed and Amir at the hospital on June 25, 2009, neither of them mentioned Murray asking to be brought back to the residence. Alvarez did not mention propofol in an IV bag or Murray asking him to put things in bags until after the cause of death was released on August 27, 2009. Dr. Christopher Rogers, chief of forensic pathology at the coroner's office, testified he had conducted the autopsy of Jackson on June 26, 2009. There was nothing obvious indicating the cause of death, and he was healthier than the average person of his age because there was no atherosclerosis on the walls of his coronary arteries. Jackson did not have heart disease, and there were no irregularities in his heart. There was no evidence of natural disease or trauma, his esophagus was intact with no milky fluid there or in the stomach. The stomach contained no pills or capsules. His mouth, upper airway and trachea were all intact with no foreign material present. Rogers took samples from each organ and sent them to the relevant experts for consults because he was not able to determine the cause of death and wanted a toxicological analysis. Rogers also requested Jackson's medical records from Murray but never received them. After toxicological analysis, Rogers determined the cause of death to be acute propofol intoxication with contributing effects from benzodiazepines exacerbating respiratory and cardiovascular depression. When asked about the manner of death, he testified it was a homicide. Propofol was not necessary, it was outside of a hospital or clinic, and the proper equipment to be used with propofol was not there. Murray administered too much propofol. The \\"circumstances do not support self-administration\\" because Jackson would have had to have woken up, self-administer the drugs, circulate to the brain, and then be found not breathing ‚Äì all in the space of 2 minutes. Rogers said that was a \\"less likely scenario\\". The \\"more likely scenario\\" was that \\"Murray was estimating the doses\\" to give Jackson and that \\"Murray accidentally gave too much.\\" There was a cut in the rubber stopper in the propofol inconsistent with a needle but a medical device called a spike, which is used to get the liquid to flow out, to \\"set up constant flow\\" of the drug. During cross-examination, Rogers testified that the only evidence of propofol in the medical equipment was in the syringe, in the Y-connector and the tubing thereafter. None was found in the upper tubing or the IV saline bag. Defense council Flanagan asked \\"Would 25 mg propofol pushed over 3-5 minutes make the patient sleep?\\" Rogers replied yes. Flanagan: \\"How long would they sleep for?\\" Rogers: \\"Approximately 5 minutes.\\" Flanagan: \\"So a 25 mg dose of propofol at 10:50 am would have no effect after 11.05?\\" Rogers: \\"Correct.\\" Flanagan: \\"After this you would assume the patient sleeping was cause by something else and not propofol, wouldn't you?\\" Rogers: \\"Yes.\\" The therapeutic range of propofol required for major surgery was 4 Œºg/ml, and for lesser operations it was 2 Œºg/ml. Jackson had 2.6 Œºg/ml in his femoral blood, which is used for post-mortem examination because as it is not located near any large organs and is less prone to redistribution after death. Rogers stated that a lethal level of propofol has been documented anywhere between 1 and 17 Œºg/ml. Jackson's stomach level of lorazepam was 0.64 Œºg/ml, and his femoral blood level was 0.169 Œºg/ml. It was hypothesized that Jackson must have ingested lorazepam fairly close to the time of death for it not to have been absorbed and distributed yet. Flanagan: \\"A 2 mg pill of lorazepam gets you to 0.018 Œºg/ml blood level?\\" Rogers: \\"Yes, in Shafer's literature.\\" Flanagan: \\"If you pushed (all at once) a dose of lorazepam to get you to 0.169 Œºg/ml blood level, it would stop your heart, wouldn't it?\\" Rogers: \\"Yes.\\" On redirect, Walgren asked whether it would still be a homicide if Jackson had self-administered the propofol or lorazepam because of the negligence by Murray, and Rogers said, \\"Correct.\\" Walgren asked whether the propofol found was the same as in major surgery, and Rogers replied, \\"Yes.\\" Walgren: \\"Would 25 mg over 3‚Äì5 minutes get you to 2.6 Œºg/ml blood level?\\" Rogers: \\"No.\\" =October 12, 2011: Day 11= Dr. Alon Steinberg, a cardiologist for 13 years and board-certified in cardiovascular diseases, Cardiac CT and Nuclear Cardiology, testified that he was not an expert in anaesthesia or pharmacology and that Murray was not board-certified in June 2009. Of the three degrees of breaching the standard of care (no deviation, mild deviation, extreme deviation), this case was the first time Steinberg has seen extreme deviations from the standard of care. Steinberg testified that propofol is only used in cases of needing deep sedation when the patient will go through a significantly painful procedure and there are risks that the patient could stop breathing; that is why it is used with constant monitoring and emergency equipment on hand. He testified that he only uses propofol with performing cardioversions and that he is required to have an anaesthetist present. For instances of mild and moderate sedation, Steinberg stated that he would use benzodiazepines and would never prescribe propofol for insomnia. He received Murray's case and was asked to review his acts and omissions against the standard of care. The review was based on Murray's own words from his police interview previously heard by the court. His findings: \\"Six separate and distinct extreme deviations from the standard of care\\". #Propofol is not medically indicated for sleep. \\"I have never even heard of it being used for insomnia, it is a very powerful surgical sedation agent.\\" There was also no informed consent signed by the patient. Risks, benefits, indications and alternatives should all be explained, understood and agreed before any treatment. #Propofol was being administered in the home, with no equipment, no medical personnel, no back-up and no physical observation by the attending physician. \\"Each of these individually would be an extreme deviation on their own\\". Equipment needed for propofol: alarm on the pulse oximeter, automated blood pressure cuff, EKG to monitor heart rhythm, ambu bag for ventilation assistance, a backboard for chest compressions, a back-up generator in case the power goes out, a way to summon help and a device for keeping the airway open such as an endotracheal tube. Murray had none of this equipment. Personnel required: Intubation specialist to rescue the airway, nurses for the procedures, emergency personnel close by, and an anaesthesiologist. Personnel trained in basic life support and advanced life support should be in attendance to deal with the airway maintenance, IV maintenance and any arrests that may occur. Drugs required during sedation in the event of an emergency: flumazenil, naloxone, lidocaine, atropine, beta blockers, dopamine, epinephrine, methylprednisolone. All of these should be available in a crash cart very close by. #Inadequate preparation for emergency situation. Attending physician must have the drugs and personnel prepared. #Improper care during arrest. Jackson had a respiratory arrest, and Murray did not follow the protocol for such an event. During respiratory arrest, the patient stops breathing, causing the oxygen levels in the blood to drop lower and lower, which causes the heart rate to increase. Lack of oxygen weakens the heart, and the heart will have electricity present but will not contract (pulseless electrical activity). Finally, the heart's electricity dies (asystole). Murray should have tried to arouse Jackson, placed an ambu bag over his mouth, cleared the airway, called 911 and administered flumazenil. Instead, Murray started chest compressions, which do not help respiratory arrest. \\"The heart was already working, he didn't need chest compressions\\". Even then, the CPR was of poor quality, since it should have involved having both hands on a hard surface rather than having one hand on a bed. #Failure to summon emergency help. Murray should have called 911 on his cell phone immediately. Instead he waited until 12:21 pm, which was approximately 20 minutes after Jackson stopped breathing. Help was four minutes away. \\"I would have allowed two minutes to check the situation before calling 911. He had a cell phone.\\" #Failure to maintain proper medical records. No informed consent. No records of Jackson's vital signs, doses given, responses to the medication. Murray was confused or dishonest about the records when they got to the emergency room. Question: \\"Dr. Murray's deviations in the standard of care contributed to Jackson's untimely death?\\" Steinberg: \\"Yes.\\" Question: \\"If Jackson administered the drugs to himself, was it still gross negligence?\\" Steinberg: \\"Yes.\\" All medicines are kept in locked and passworded cabinets. There would have been no opportunity for self-administration in a proper setting. During cross-examination, Steinberg testified that if the patient had a blood pressure (caused by there being a pulse) and a pulse of 122, he was savable. If a patient is not breathing but has a pulse, the course of action is to clear the airways and give breaths. Next to the stand was Dr. Nader Kamanger, board-certified in internal medicine, pulmonary medicine, critical care, and sleep medicine. He uses propofol daily for sedation when placing an endotracheal tube. It is the classic induction agent for deep sedation during painful procedures. It is the most common drug for maintaining sedation on patients on mechanical breathing apparatus. Doctors have to call an anaesthesiologist to administer it, someone who can maintain the airway, and someone who can reverse the effects of the drugs. Kamanger also pointed out Murray's extreme deviation of the standard of care, consistent with Steinberg's testimony. =October 13, 2011: Day 12= Next to the stand was Steven Shafer, a professor of anesthesiology at Columbia University since 2007 and adjunct professor of anesthesiology at Stanford University since 2000. He is an expert on pharmacokinetics (rate of onset of drug action, duration of action, and elimination of drug action, in sum) and pharmacometrics with 20 years of experience working with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). His field of interest involves mathematically modeling how a dose of drug translates to concentrations in the body and its effects on a patient. He has published 19 papers about the pharmacokinetics of propofol. Pharmacokinetics involves the study of the dilution of drug in a patient's blood stream. Shafer is the current editor in chief for the Journal of Anesthesia and Analgesia and on the editing board of many other journals. He testified about the history of the dosing guidelines of propofol. =October 19‚Äì20, 2011: Days 13 and 14= Shafer showed a video of the use of propofol during a procedure. He testified about his review of the Murray case. He found seventeen \\"separate and distinct egregious violations\\" of the standard of care, of which four were unconscionable, based on Murray's police interview: #The lack of the basic emergency airway equipment. #The lack of the advanced emergency airway equipment. #The lack of suction apparatus. #The lack of an IV infusion pump. #The lack of alarmed pulse oximetry. #The failure to use a blood pressure cuff. #The lack of an electrocardiogram. #The lack of capnography. #The failure to maintain a doctor-patient relationship. #The failure to continuously monitor the mental status of the patient. #The failure to continuously monitor the breathing of the patient. #The failure to continuously monitor blood pressure and pulse oximetry, and to have heart monitors. #The failure to call 911 immediately. #The failure to chart at the outset of the procedure (egregious and unconscionable). #The failure to maintain written informed consent (egregious and unconscionable). #The failure to document throughout the course of sedation (egregious and unconscionable). #The failure to disclose to both the paramedics and UCLA the use of propofol and what Murray witnessed at the arrest. Question: \\"Each one of these seventeen egregious violations is individually likely or expected to result in injury or death to Michael Jackson?\\" Response: \\"Yes\\". Shafer showed simulations of propofol and lorazepam on his computer models. (i) If the drugs were bolus pushed: He stated that the drugs administered (as described in Murray's interview statement) could not have produced the femoral blood levels at autopsy. He also testified that Jackson repeatedly self-administrating the drugs would not have caused the femoral blood levels found at autopsy. (ii) If the drugs were IV administered: Administration by continued IV infusion would cause the femoral blood levels found at autopsy very quickly after the drip was started. After the patient stops breathing, the heart would still be beating so the IV would continue. This scenario would result in the blood levels at autopsy. According to Shafer: \\"That's what I think happened, based on all the evidence.\\" Shafer demonstrated the set-up of an IV infusion of propofol. The IV line for propofol would need an air vent to allow air into the bottle and an infusion pump to control the dose. Without a pump, it is very hard to control the dose. He testified that he had never seen anything like the cut bag set-up and had never seen anyone do it. Walgren asked Shafer a number of questions regarding his testimony over the last few days: *\\"You have noted seventeen egregious violation from the standard of care, four of which you found were unconscionable?\\" \\"Yes.\\" *\\"Showed us the video in which you demonstrated the safe and proper mean to administer sedation\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"And it is your opinion that those safeguards and that equipment is necessary even if the physician intents on administering just 25 mg of propofol?\\" \\"Yes.\\" *\\"You have explained to us why it is impossible that Michael Jackson died as a result of orally swallowing propofol?\\" \\"Yes\\". *\\"You discussed lorazepam and you concluded that Michael Jackson received more than the 4 mg of lorazepam that Dr. Murray claimed to have given Michael Jackson?\\" \\"Yes.\\" *\\"You also rejected the notion that certainly at ten o' clock am that Michael Jackson swallowed eight 2 mg tablets of lorazepam?\\" \\"Yes\\". \\"And you would broaden that window to four hours meaning between eight and noon based on what was found in the stomach it was impossible that Michael Jackson swallowed that amount of lorazepam?\\" \\"Correct.\\" *\\"You demonstrated here the simulation of how one would infuse propofol with this type of set up and with some of the evidence recovered in this case?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"And that the infusion line with the propofol in it could be compacted into the fist of my hand?\\" \\"Yes.\\" *\\"Taking all the evidence that you've reviewed and all the deviations from the standard of care, you've concluded that Conrad Murray was not only a substantial factor, but a direct cause of Michael Jackson's death?\\" \\"Yes.\\" *\\"Had all this transpired as relayed by Dr. Murray and subsequent to that Michael Jackson had either injected propofol and/or swallowed lorazepam tablets, is it still your opinion that Conrad Murray was a direct cause, not just a substantial factor, of Michael Jackson's death?\\" \\"Absolutely.\\" \\"And why is that?\\" \\"That's because he is a physician who has brought propofol into the room, started an intravenous and provided access to propofol to a patient who may in fact be developing a dependency on sedatives, and he has been entrusted by Michael Jackson to look after his safety every night and he has failed that responsibility by enabling the administration of intravenous propofol. He is responsible for every drop of propofol in that room.\\" \\"And lorazepam?\\" \\"Every drop of lorazepam in that room.\\" *\\"And that's because Conrad Murray set up the situation when he abandoned the patient in the room?\\" \\"Yes.\\" =October 21, 2011: Day 15= Chernoff cross-examined Shafer on his CV and about his relationship with the defense's expert Dr. Paul White. =October 24, 2011: Day 16= The cross-examination of Shafer concluded, and the prosecution rested. Timeline of defense case =October 24, 2011: Day 16= The first witness called was Donna Norris from the Beverly Hills Police Department (BHPD). She is the manager of the 911 system of the BHPD. It was heard that the 911 call on June 25 at 12:20:18 lasted 46 seconds and was made from a cell phone. The next witness called was Alexander Supall, a police surveillance specialist working for LAPD. He has been in this role for eleven years. It was heard that Mr. Supall went to the Jackson residence on the day to check the surveillance tapes. He said he didn't locate where the cameras were or how many of them there were. The defense then played two surveillance videos involving Jackson and Murray's arrivals at the residence. The next witness to testify was LAPD Detective Dan Myres. He works in the robbery homicide division and has been with the LAPD since March 1994. He joined the investigation of the Jackson death on the Monday after June 25, 2009. It was heard that Myres interviewed Alberto Alvarez on June 25 and August 31. In his initial statement he didn't mention putting away vials or a vial or bottle in an IV bag. The next witness to the stand was LAPD Detective Orlando Martinez. Also in the robbery homicide division, Martinez has been with the LAPD for ten years. On hearing of Jackson's death, he went to UCLA and was present for half of Alvarez's interview. He stated that Alvarez didn't mention putting away vials for Dr. Murray or seeing a vial or bottle inside an IV bag. It was heard that Mr. Walgren had a meeting with Alvarez and Myres in his office in April 2011. Martinez brought (from the case's evidence) a saline bag, a propofol bottle and a pulse oximeter to the meeting. Alvarez didn't recognize the propofol bottle shown to him. Alvarez was asked to draw the saline bag he saw after he described something at the bottom of the bag, it looked to be a port or some kind of apparatus. The next witness was Dr. Allan Metzger. A physician, general internalist and rheumatologist since 1974, based in Los Angeles since 1981. First met Jackson 15‚Äì20 years ago. He began treating Michael Jackson in the 1990s for various things. He became close to Jackson through the birth of his children and became a friend. He was Jackson's primary physician in Los Angeles. He received a call from Jackson on June 12, 2008; the conversation was about sleep issues, skin issues, and nutrition. He hadn't spoken to Jackson for five years previously. It was heard that Dr. Metzger was infrequently in touch with the children's nanny over 2008‚Äì2009 keeping tabs on the children. Jackson called for Dr. Metzger to come over in April 2009 to review his health issues. It was not unusual for him to visit the house. The three children, Jackson and some security guards were present on visit. The conversation was about medical issues and Jackson's rehearsal schedule. Jackson wanted to do 50 shows but was worried about nutrition. They also talked about hydration before and after performing. It was heard that Jackson had had sleep issues for 15‚Äì20 years, particularly after performing. Dr. Metzger had infrequently treated Jackson for his sleep issues over the years on tours. In April 2009, he asked Dr. Metzger about IV sleep medication, when he mentioned 'juice', but he wasn't sure what he was asking for. Jackson did not believe any oral medicine would be helpful; they did not work. He had tried Tylenol PM, Xanax, clonazepam, trazodone, etc. None of it worked. It was heard that Dr. Metzger told Jackson that IV sleep medication was dangerous and should not be administered outside of a hospital. It was heard that Jackson saw other doctors: Dr. Rosen for pain management and Dr. Klein for his vitiligo. Dr. Metzger stated he never provided any intravenous medicine to Jackson. It was heard Metzger did not speak to Jackson between the April 2009 meeting and his death. The prosecution asked Metzger \\"Would any amount of money persuade you to give propofol?\\" \\"No\\" and \\"Did you ever give Jackson propofol?\\" \\"No.\\" Next to the stand was Nurse Practitioner Cherilyn Lee. Lee helps entertainers and athletes with nutritional issues. Lee is a board- certified nurse practitioner and is legally allowed to prescribe medications, but she chooses not to. Faheem Muhammad called Lee to treat Jackson's children who had a cold. She told him she wasn't a pediatrician but she was invited anyway. Lee went to the house in Jan 2009 after making an appointment. Jackson asked what she did and he mentioned that he was tired and he wanted nutrition therapy. Lee asked Jackson to fast that night and she went back the next day to do an assessment: Jackson completed a physical test and blood was drawn for testing. Lee wanted to determine the cause of Jackson's tiredness. She noticed he drank Red Bull a lot, which can cause fatigue. He said he would sweat a lot during rehearsals; he could lose 5-7 pounds because of it. Lee said Jackson's vital signs were normal and provided him with high-concentrated smoothies and low dose nutritional IV. Lee stated that after the first IV (amino acid) in early Feb, he felt a lot better and more energized. In March 2009, Jackson said he couldn't sleep and Lee recommended natural sleep products. He said they don't work for him. Jackson said, \\"when I need sleep I need it right away\\", when they met on Easter Sunday. Jackson wanted her to see that he did not sleep well. Jackson also wanted to show her that natural supplements were not working. It was heard that Lee wanted to conduct sleep studies, but Jackson said he did not have time for that. Jackson invited her to stay and watch how he didn't sleep. Lee gave him the energy IV and 'sleepy tea' but she observed that he woke up at 3 a.m.. He could only sleep for about 5 hours and he repeated to her that he cannot sleep the whole night. Lee stated that Jackson's veins were very small. Jackson started to talk about getting medication for sleep around Easter. =October 25, 2011: Day 17= The judge ruled that Jacksons's contract with AEG Live for the O2 gigs would not be admitted into evidence. Nurse Practitioner Cherilyn Lee was still on the stand. It was heard that Lee is a believer of Holistic Health and has a PhD in it. Chernoff began by clearing up some of the dates in her records: *April 12, Easter Sunday: went to Jackson's house; he said he needed products for sleep. *April 19: went out to Jackson's house, Sunday morning; Jackson told Lee he \\"just can't sleep\\", he was having a lot of difficulty. Jackson expressed his desire for Diprivan; \\"it was the only medication that makes him fall asleep straight away\\". Lee was concerned; he seemed to have a familiarity with it. Jackson told Lee he had been administered Diprivan before but only for surgery, not for anything else. Lee says she didn't know what Diprivan was, so she called a doctor friend of hers who said it was an anesthetic used for surgery in hospital. Jackson told her other doctors had said Diprivan was safe to use, that all that was needed was for him to be monitored. Jackson asked her to stay that night because he wanted to show Lee he was unable to sleep, he slept for 5 hours, woke up and was upset that he had not slept longer and that the nutritional medicine wasn't working. He then said \\"the only thing that helps is Diprivan, can you find someone to help me sleep?\\" \\"as soon as Diprivan gets in my veins it knocks me out and I go to sleep right away\\". Lee said \\"I know you want to be knocked out but what if you don't wake up?\\" \\"I just need to be monitored\\". She told Jackson that no one who cared or had his best interests at heart would give him propofol. Jackson complained to Lee that not sleeping would \\"mess up my performance\\". Lee testified that one its side effects was memory loss and she asked Jackson \\"What if you forget your lines?\\" He said he never would. He hugged her and she never saw him again. *June 21, 2009, Jackson's bodyguard called Lee and said Jackson wanted to see her. Lee says she could hear Jackson in the background, saying 'tell her what is wrong, one half of body hot, one half is cold'. She said that she was too far away to exam him (Florida) and that he should go to the hospital. Lee recognized the symptoms and thought he was on propofol. Next to the stand was Amir Dan Rubin, a hospital executive in Stanford, California. Chief Operating Officer for UCLA Medical Center in June 2009. Responsible for operation systems. He explained the layout of UCLA Medical Center, he worked in the administration area. Rubin was paged when \\"a patient of interest\\" was brought to the emergency room. He proceeded to secure the area for privacy and security purposes. He was present at the hospital for a discussion about releasing a press release with CEO of AEG Live (Randy Phillips) and Jermaine Jackson. The statement was released by Jermaine Jackson in the basement of the hospital; it was stated that Michael Jackson had died. Rubin said that Murray suggested that the reason for death, \\"unknown\\", should be in the press release. Next to the stand was Brandon Keith Phillips, President and CEO of AEG Live, division of AEG, for nine and a half years. He has worked in the entertainment industry for thirty years. AEG are the owners and operators of the Staples Center in Los Angeles and The O2 Arena in London. Phillips was responsible for profit and loss, booking talent for tours, making sure regional offices function properly as well as festival division. Phillips represented Jackson as an agent/consultant as early as 1993. Saw Jackson next in a meeting in 2007. It was heard that Phillips met Jackson in September 2008 with Jackson's manager (Dr. Tomei) at the Bel-Air hotel about concerts. Phillips laid out plans for a new tour; a residency show at the O2 arena in London, move the \\"mountain to Mohammed\\"; this can only happen with such a big star. This was the first phase of a \\"multi-year\\" tour. It was apparent that Jackson was motivated, energized and receptive to the idea. They had numerous meetings afterwards. One reason Jackson wanted to do the concerts was to settle down and make a good home for the children and not live like \\"vagabonds\\". The contract was drawn up and signed (in mid-Jan 2009) for thirty one shows; Jackson wanted to do ten more than Prince did. Chernoff asked questions about the finances of the contract. All questions were objected to and the judge sustained them. It was heard that ten shows went on sale first and the demand was \\"over the top.\\" \\"We had never seen that kind of demand for tickets, it was obvious we would have blown through thirty-one shows in the pre-sale and not had any [left] for general sales.\\" Within twenty minutes Jackson agreed to more shows. Jackson said he wanted to do maximum fifty shows because he didn't want a passport, didn't want to live in London. He asked for a country house estate (16+ acres with running streams) so he and the kids wouldn't be stuck in a hotel in London. He also wanted Guinness World Records to be there at the fiftieth show. It was heard that Jackson was very firm about having his own (24/7) physician (Murray). It was heard that Phillips met with Murray and Jackson in early June 2009 to discuss Jackson's health. Murray assured Phillips he was in great health and that Murray would look after Jackson's diet. It was heard that Kenny [Ortega] told Phillips that he was concerned about Jackson's focus in performances in a production of this magnitude. Phillips started seeing stress and pressure in Ortega towards the middle of June because of this. There was an issue of Jackson showing up for performances. Ortega said he needed to be there because he was the fulcrum; everything surrounded him in the production. Ortega scheduled a meeting for June 20 which would be about Michael Jackson's tardiness and focus at rehearsals. It was heard that, based on Kenny Ortega's email, it was clear he felt this was an emergency meeting. The meeting was with Murray, Jackson, Ortega and Phillips at Carolwood house. Ortega didn't understand why Jackson wasn't as engaged as he thought he would be. \\"Michael didn't respond immediately. Murray spoke for Michael on the situation, guaranteed us that Michael would get into it\\". Phillips attended rehearsals on June 23‚Äì24 to make sure everything was back on track. On June 25, Phillips went to hospital and stayed there the entire time Jackson was there. \\"I was there all day into the evening\\". Murray was in \\"severe distress\\". The next defense witness was toxicologist Michael Henson, a tech operations officer at Pacific Toxicology. Defense attorney Michael Flanagan doing direct examination. Henson has known Flanagan since 2009. His company had worked with Flanagan for quite some time. Henson examined urine samples handed over from LA County Coroners Office. He also provided defense testing for stomach content of lorazepam. It was heard that Dr. Shafer emailed Henson about what his standard operating procedure (SOP) for lorazepam results was, but he did not email Shafer back and contacted Flanagan instead. During cross-examination, Walgren asked Henson why the People and the Defence have 2 different copies of lorazepam results. Henson said he did not know. =October 26, 2011: Day 18= The first witness of the day was Gerry Causey, who lives in Cedar City, Utah. Causey had known Murray for 11 years. They met when he lived in Las Vegas, when Causey had a heart attack. \\"Murray made me sign some paperwork, some kind of release, then they took me to the operating room for an angiogram.\\" \\"During my procedure I didn't want to be sedated. I saw everything on the screen. He always explained me everything he was doing.\\" He has been in constant contact with Murray ever since he was in hospital. They have remained friends. It was heard that they have remained friends because of the love Dr. Murray has for his patients. Causey has stated Murray is his \\"best friend.\\" Causey said that Murray was not greedy and that he never has been. He would treat patients regardless of whether they had insurance or not. Murray broke down in tears when Causey said Murray would spend all time necessary with him, he would call his wife to explain problems. It was heard that Causey had given two TV interviews regarding Murray. He gave them free of charge \\"to help my friend.\\" During cross-examination, Causey said that Dr. Murray is known for \\"his compassion, his feelings‚Äîyou can ask any of his patients; he's the best doctor in the world.\\" \\"I don't think he did what he's accused of. From what I know, what I feel right now he didn't do it.\\" Walgren asked Causey whether he would come and testify on the Murray's behalf, even if he knew Murray was grossly negligent. He said yes. Causey was excused and as he walked out, he kissed Dr. Murray on the forehead and shook his hand. Next to the stand was Andrew Guest, also a previous patient of Murray's from Las Vegas. Guest described how he first met Murray during the procedures he went through for his heart. Guest said \\"that man sitting there is the best doctor I have ever seen\\" \\"I'm alive today because of that man.\\" It was heard that Guest did an interview, free of charge, with CNN because he believed Murray needed support and wasn't getting a \\"fair shake.\\" Walgren asked: \\"Nothing would change your opinion of that man, would it?\\" Guest replied: \\"Correct.\\" Next to the stand was Lunette Sampson. Another patient of Murray's. She now lives in San Diego, but lived in Las Vegas for long time. Sampson had 2 heart attacks while in Las Vegas, Dr. Murray treated her. \\"I have never had a doctor that was more caring and thorough.\\" When asked if she thought Murray was greedy or was motivated by money she said: \\"I know Dr. Murray is not greedy or money-hungry. He is taking care of people pro-bono, people without money.\\" Sampson said Murray never once mentioned he was going to work with Jackson. \\"He told me he was going to take sabbatical for a year.\\" Next called was Dennis Hix. He had heart problems and got stents (Coronary stent), the last one around 2004‚Äì2005. Murray's children's were his neighbors. It was heard that Hix is 66 years old, and he has gone to various other doctors and never had one who gave him the care he did. \\"I had insurance that didn't hardly pay for nothing (sic); he said he would help. When my brother saw I got the stents, my brother said he wanted some too. He had heart issues but didn't have money for the procedure. Dr. Murray told my brother not to worry about the payment, that he would treat him for free. And he did.\\" Walgren asked Hix: \\"When did you learn Dr. Murray was going on tour with Jackson?\\" Hix replied, \\"I didn't even know it until I saw it on TV.\\" Next to the stand was Ruby Mosley. She lives in Houston. She's the secretary of Acres Home Citizen's Council, a low income seniors' community. Dr. Murray's father was a doctor in the Acres Home district. Dr. Murray opened the clinic in his father's memory. \\"He made a commitment to the community to open a clinic in memory of his dad\\" (Dr. M Snr was there from 1968 until 2003). Upon Chernoff asking if Murray was greedy, Mosley replied \\"if this man was greedy, he would've not come to work at Acres Home, where 75% of people are poor. He was making less than in Las Vegas.\\" Murray treated Mosley for heart problems. =October 27, 2011: Day 19= First to take the stand was Dr. Robert Waldman, a physician specializing in internal medicine, Nephrology and Addiction medicine, has been involved in addiction medicine and treating patients who have addiction diseases for 23 years but is not board-certified in it. He described to the court what happens to a patient during addiction and withdrawal, including the tell-tale signs, the symptoms and the drugs that can be involved. Dr. Waldman stated that the side effects of withdrawal of drugs are sweating, increase heart rate, nausea, cramp, insomnia, temperature deregulation and tremendous anxiety. It was heard that the addict's biggest fear is that you're not going to respect the amount of discomfort they'll go through during treatment and detoxing process. It was also heard that rapid detox is not a treatment. It uses high levels of sedation intravenously and it is a process that uses general anesthesia to help tolerate the discomfort. It was heard that Dr. Waldman's opinion is that there is evidence to suggest Jackson was dependent (not addicted) on Demerol (pethidine) due to the frequent high doses he received in May 2009 indicated by Dr. Klein's medical records of Omar Arnold (an alias of Jackson's). It was heard that Dr. Klein's medical records indicate that in April 2009, Jackson received 775 mg of Demerol for Botox and Restylane procedures. During the three days in beginning of May 2009, Jackson received another 900 mg of Demerol for Botox and Restylane procedures. Dr. Waldman said being injected during 6 days with very high doses of Demerol would create opioid dependency in any one of us. Next to the stand was Dr. Paul White, with an interest in intravenous anesthesia, he started working with propofol in 1983; the FDA approved it for general anesthesia in 1989. He has published 435 papers on PubMed. He has written about fifteen books, two of which were major textbooks. Dr. White has written five books on propofol as well as twenty one chapters on propofol in various textbooks. After initial study showed propofol allowed patients to wake up sooner, he went back to the company and asked to do a follow-up study. Dr. White said, \\"Some people call me the father of Monitored Anesthetic Care (MAC) (anesthesia awareness) sedation.\\" \\"In January of this year, Mr. Flanagan contacted me and mentioned the name Conrad Murray. I wasn't sure if I wanted to get involved in a high-profile trial involving the death of a celebrity. I was perplexed how experts determined that Murray was infusing propofol. It was not obvious to me.\\" Dr. White met the Shafers in 1981, shortly after arrival at Stanford. They approached him about doing research. It was heard that Dr. White performed a study with animals and found that propofol directly into the stomach has no clinical effect. Regarding the paper, Dr. Shafer testified about a sleep study in China, Dr. White said \\"My take on the paper was different than Dr. Shafer's. The study showed that propofol was safe and effective for normalizing disturbed sleep but it's certainly not a definitive study.\\" =October 28, 2011: Day 20= White was back on the stand being examined by J. Michael Flanagan. It was heard that, based on the diagram showing what Dr. Murray told the police he gave to Jackson on the night in question, it would not have presented any danger at all. White said that \\"the dose of propofol we are talking about here is 25 mg. This is a dose that produces little anxiety, little sleepiness.\\" It was heard that anesthesiologists are obviously trained in sedation. For non- anesthesiologists, most hospitals require certification to use sedation. White was then given a certificate to read. It was Murray's certification from Sunrise Medical Hospital approving him to administer moderate sedation. It qualifies the doctor to administer drugs to achieve moderate sedation; but he must monitor patients carefully. The certification also says the doctor is approved to rescue patients from deep sedation, manage compromised airway, and provide adequate ventilation. Flanagan and White went through simulations that Shafer put together with the variables being dosage and time administered. It was heard that there was some free lorazepam in the stomach, showing that Jackson took lorazepam orally at some point before his death. Flanagan went through different scenarios with Dr. White about what could have caused Jackson's death. Dr. White then demonstrated how to mix propofol and lidocaine inside a syringe and administered it through a saline drip and Y tube. White injected 5 mg of propofol/saline mix into a cup to show that propofol doesn't go up the IV line and propofol sticks to the plastic tubing. He said that this is certainly a very safe way to inject propofol, and it was only 25 mg. \\"My demonstration was probably close to what happened at the scene. You'd need a mechanism to drip the drug and hold this heavy bottle.\\" Flanagan asked if he could envision anyone using a slit IV bag to hang the propofol bottle when there's a handle on the bottle? \\"No.\\" White added: \\"Why would anyone go through the hassle of cutting a saline bag to put the bottle inside when bottle has a handle?\\" Flanagan then asked how you would mix propofol solution with saline to make it 1‚Äì1 mg/ml? \\"You pull the tab off the bottle, spike the top, then inject all the bottle of propofol into the saline bag, shaking the bag to make it 1-1 Œºg/ml.\\" It was heard that propofol is extensively metabolized, but some is eliminated in the urine in unchanged form. The autopsy determined an extremely small amount. There was half a liter of urine in Jackson's bladder at the time of the autopsy. It contained very little unchanged propofol. White commented, \\"I cannot understand a 3-hour infusion theory where there was evidence of infusion set up and elimination of drug in urine.\\" Flanagan then asked: \\"Do you think it was self injection of propofol nearly 11:30a/12p did it?\\" \\"In my opinion, yes.\\" Flanagan then asked: \\"Shafer said his scenario reconciled with all facts in this case. Does it reconcile with Dr. Murray's statement?\\" \\"No.\\" \\"Does Dr. Shafer's theory reconcile with physical evidence at the scene or urine concentration?\\" \\"No.\\" Dr. White said. \\"My theory reconciles with the evidence found at the scene and the urine concentration at autopsy.\\" Dr. White proposed that, consistent with Murray's claim of having administered a dose of 25 mg of propofol, Michael Jackson would have woken up \\"after 10-15 minutes max,\\" following which he self- injected 25 mg of propofol while Murray was out of the room. The combination of lorezapam, another sedative, midazolam, and propofol could have been potentially lethal. =October 31, 2011: Day 21= It was heard from White that administering propofol without careful bedside monitoring could be dangerous. \\"Do you agree there were instances where Dr. Murray deviated from the standard of care on June 25, 2009?\\" \\"Yes\\". Walgren asked, \\"have you ever administered propofol in someone's bedroom?\\" \\"No\\". \\"Have you heard anyone else doing it?\\" \\"No.\\" Dr. White agrees Dr. Murray deviated from the 'standard of care' of Jackson but doesn't know to what degree. \\"Do you disagree with Dr. Shafer's opinion that failure to keep medical records constitutes an 'egregious and unconscionable' deviation?\\" White doesn't know what the words egregious and unconscionable mean in this case. \\"Would you administer propofol to a patient without proper airway-opening equipment?\\" \\"I would certainly have means for ventilation. Means of ventilation could be an ambu bag and a mask, not necessarily other respiratory equipment\\". It was heard that Dr. White has received $11,000 so far for his testimony in this case. He usually charges $3,500 per day and any expenses such as airfares. He doesn't think the defense have this much so will not bill them that much. Dr. Safer testified for many days, and performed numerous simulations for both the prosecution and defense for free. \\"Was Dr. Murray offered money to provide Jackson's propofol?\\" \\"It is my understanding that Dr. Murray was offered money to be Jackson's personal doctor.\\" Walgren then asked \\"If you injected 25 mg propofol, is it ok to walk out of the room?\\" \\"25 mg only lasts 15-30 minutes, after that I see no problem in leaving the patient's bedside.\\" \\"If the patient liked to 'push' propofol themselves, would you walk out of room?\\" \\"No.\\" Upon being asked about Murray's actions after he found Jackson, Dr. White said \\"I would have done things differently. I would have called for help, called 911 and initiated CPR.\\" When being asked about Murray's delay to call 911 he stated \\"I would have called 911 earlier but do not believe it would have made any difference in this case.\\" \\"3-5 minutes after finding him I would call 911.\\" It was heard, \\"forgetting to mention propofol was a detail overlooked. Could it also be a lie?\\" \\"Yes.\\" After Dr. White mentioned he believed that Jackson had his own stash of propofol, Walgren asked the judge to insist the witness to respond to the question only. The judge asked the jurors to leave the courtroom. Walgren asked \\"Do you reject that Jackson drank propofol and that caused his death?\\" \\"Yes. I speculated that oral administration may have played a role. I don't reject completely the self-administration theory. The evidence suggests that Jackson did not drink propofol\\". Flanagan then asked Dr. White: \\"If the patient died [at] noon, would it matter if help came 5 minutes later?\\" \\"Unlikely.\\" Dr. White continued and added, \\"Propofol does not have a reversal treatment. The only treatment for a propofol overdose is time.\\" During his testimony, Dr. White was fined for contempt of court after disobeying an order by the judge to not refer to personal discussions with Murray in his testimony, instead to only reference statements from Murray's official police report. Dr. White could have been fined up to $1,000, but the judge set the fine to $250. Dr. White told the judge, \\"I did my best as I was admonished by you to answer the question truthfully and as completely as I could.\\" He also said, \\"I apologize profusely if I disrespected you. I learned a lot from this experience.\\" A second charge for contempt of court against Dr. White was dropped, after an online report alleged he had muttered \\"scumbag\\" as his colleague, Dr. Shafer, approached to testify. After court adjourned, the judge told attorneys he would give them one day off so they could prepare their closing arguments. If done by Tuesday, Wednesday could be dark. The judge said he has prepared to give a full day off, which takes it to Thursday for jury instructions. He says he would not defer that. The judge asked Murray if he's going to testify. Murray replied, \\"I need more time to talk to my lawyers. I have not made my final decision.\\" Judge Pastor told Murray that he will have until tomorrow morning to decide. Murray said: \\"It will all depend on how the case progresses.\\" After the defense concludes with Dr. White, they plan on calling Dr. Ornellas, the person who put together the models of which Dr. White spoke. After Dr. Ornellas, the defense is prepared to rest their case. Walgren said he will call Dr. Shafer briefly as a rebuttal witness. The judge then said he expects all the evidence in the case to be concluded tomorrow. The trial was set to resume at 9:30 am with the end of the re-direct of Dr. White. =November 1, 2011: Day 22= The redirect examination of Dr. White continues with Mr. Flanagan asking the questions about various models that Dr. White had commissioned for the defence. They talked about the level of lorazepam in Jackson's body in the models created by Dr. Shafer and Dr. White's expert. It was heard that there are many possibilities as to how the blood and urine levels got to where they were at autopsy. The models present a few different ideas and scenarios. \\"We can make models and adjust the time/dose to achieve the concentration of lorazepam found in femoral blood at the time of autopsy\\". There are great differences between different patients so the models are subject to huge population variability. Flanagan to Dr. White: \\"we don't know how many lorazepam pills Jackson took, do we?\\" \\"No one can be sure.\\" Dr. White said that Dr. Shafer's scenario of a three-hour infusion does not hold up because the urine levels of propofol at autopsy are too low. Dr. White said that, while standards of care are the ideals, standards of practice are different in different situations. Some office procedures, i.e. such as procedures from hospital to hospital, might have different conditions and standards of practice if it is not possible to have the highest standard of care. Dr. White stated that 25 mg over 3-5 minute of propofol would only produce light sleepiness, possibly no sleep at all. Murray decided not to take the stand in his defense. The defense had no more witnesses and rested their case. Prosecution recalled Dr. Steven Shafer. It was heard that there was no suggestion Jackson died at any specific time, only the fact he died with a high level infusion of propofol. It was heard that the propofol elimination in the urine is 0.004+-0.002% of the total dose given. The excreted unchanged propofol found in the urine at autopsy was 82.5 Œºg. This indicates that more than 2,000 mg propofol was administered to Jackson. This rules out the hypothesis by Dr. White and indicates more propofol than Dr. Shafer's models. Dr. Shafer said that if there were such a thing as bedroom-based anesthesia, the standard guidelines would be a minimum; many more precautions would be required. =November 3, 2011: Day 23= The jury heard instructions from the judge, both prosecution and defense closing arguments and final post-trial instructions from the judge.

Its species are considered examples of insular gigantism. They first appear in the fossil record during the Early Pliocene, presumably due to the Messinian salinity crisis causing a connection with mainland Europe, and disappear during the Holocene after human arrival on the Balearics. They were only of only three native land mammals to the islands, alongside Nesiotites and Myotragus. A 2020 mitochondrial DNA analysis found that its closest living relative was Eliomys, from which it diverged around 13.67 million years ago.

In fundamental respects it resembled the Scottish galley or b√¨rlinn, their mutual ancestor being the Viking longship. Both the Irish and Scottish versions were colloquially known as \\"longa fada\\" (longships). The Irish galley was commonly an eight or twelve-oared vessel and was used for both warfare and trade. It was notable for its speed when rowed. Conventional galleys were being built in a number of Irish ports in the fourteenth century, and were even commissioned by the Crown.Rixson, pp.167‚Äì168 The use of such oared vessels in Northern Europe, in contrast to the Mediterranean, had greatly declined by the sixteenth century; their survival in the west of Ireland, as in the Scottish Isles, was facilitated by very local conditions, among them the ready availability of bays and islands. Characteristics No archeological remains have been found which would enable a detailed reconstruction of the Irish galley. There are, however, illustrations on Irish maps of the Elizabethan period http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8307000/8307233.stm. (though of contested reliability), and these are supplemented by written accounts. There is also a carving in the old Cistercian monastery on Clare Island (Oile√°n Chliara), home of the seafaring O'Malleys. The carving, though very simple, shows a vessel remarkably similar to images of its Scottish equivalent, being an oared, single-masted ship with a yard for a single square sail. Cartographic images of the later sixteenth century, however, show interesting differences from the vessel shown in the carving. This may reflect foreign influences, since Irish galleys traded to Spain and Portugal. An image from a 1657 map of Ireland shows an oared vessel with a round stern and a raked stem.Ireland in Schools:‚ÄòGrace O‚ÄôMalley, Granuaile: Chieftain, trader, pirate: ships‚Äô: www.iisresource.org/Documents/0A4_Grace_Fleet.ppt There is a raised deck over the latter, and a cabin with a curved roof considerably aft of the mast. The mast is placed forward and carries a single sail, possible a lug sail. There are stays visible and lifts with a block. Images on a map of Ulster by Francis JobsonMap of Ulster (1591), Francis Jobson, TCD MS 1209/17. show three Irish galleys, each with eight oars and a vertically striped square sail. Rudders are visible, along with stays, braces and crow's-nests. The forestay descends to a beak, with a round-roofed cabin aft. seal of John Moidartach (from Scotland,1572). There is pictorial evidence that by the end of the sixteenth century similar influences may have affected the design of the Scottish galley. A carving made at Arasaig in 1641 shows a vessel with a lowered stem and stern. An English map of north-east Ireland made no later than 1603 shows \\"fleetes of the Redshanks [Highlanders] of Cantyre\\" carrying what resembles a lugsail on a sloping yard arm, with a small cabin at the stern projecting backwards.From the Dartmouth Collection of the British National Maritime Museum. Two Clanranald seals attached to documents dated 1572 show a birlinn with raised decks at stem and stern, a motif repeated in later heraldic devices.Rixson (1988) If such changes occurred, they would reflect (as in Ireland) influences from the south-east and ultimately from the Mediterranean. Construction It is reasonable to assume that galleys in both Western Scotland and the West of Ireland were built in accordance with well-established shipwrights' techniques of north-west Europe, of which the Norse were major exponents. There was extensive Norse settlement both on the west coast of Scotland and around the coasts of Ireland. Norse shipwrights attached both the stem and stern to the keel with scarfed joints, the hull itself being clinker-built with iron nails. Ribs were attached to the strakes with cords or trenails, and thwarts installed. The mast was then inserted in the mast step.Greenhill (1976), p 234. The stem and stern posts would have notches to receive the ends of planks, and knees secured the thwarts.Greenhill (1976), p 234. Images of Scottish ships appear to show vessels built in accordance with these techniques. They were clinker-built, open-decked amidships, single-masted and oared, the major difference being that, unlike Norse ships of the classical period, they had a rudder attached to a steep transom.Rixson (1998), p 138. From the evidence available, it is likely that Irish galleys resembled their Scottish equivalents in their construction, rigging, steering and means of propulsion. Use Rockfleet Castle (Caisle√°n Charraig an Chabhlaigh ‚Äì \\"the castle of the rock of the fleet\\"), an O'Malley stronghold. References are found in the Annals of the Four Masters to Irish fleets of the period in which the galley was dominant. In 1413, for example, Tuathal √ì M√°ille, a member of the O'Malley family, was returning to Mayo from Ulster when his fleet of seven ships was overtaken by \\"anfadh na mara\\" (a sea tempest) and driven northwards to Scotland. Only Tuathal survived.M1413.3 Annals of the Four Masters 1413. The O'Malleys and the O'Flahertys, lords of west Connacht, were the main users of galleys, which they used for plundering or for transporting the troops of other chieftains. In the sixteenth century the Crown made a determined attempt to suppress the Irish fleets with its own ships.Rixson (1998), p 42. In December 1559 the following was recorded in the English State Papers: :\\"There are three very good galleys with Tibbot ne Longe, sone to Grany O‚ÄôMalley, his brother and O‚ÄôMalley that will carry 300 men apiece. These, if employed by Her Majesty, would do much good in the north, and the O‚ÄôMalleys are much feared everywhere by sea. There are no galleys in Ireland but these (i.e. there are no galleys to compare with these).\\"Ireland in Schools: 'Grace O‚ÄôMalley, Granuaile: Chieftain, trader, pirate: ships‚Äô: www.iisresource.org/Documents/0A4_Grace_Fleet.ppt Grany O‚ÄôMalley or Grace O'Malley (Irish: Gr√°inne N√≠ Mh√°ille) was the most famous of the seafaring chieftains. The Governor of Connacht, Sir Richard Bingham, wrote of her in 1591 that she had twenty ships,Rixson (1998), p 44 though it is uncertain whether this was her usual complement. She, like her father before her, was a notable merchant by sea.1593 Petition of Grace O'Malley to Queen Elizabeth, State Papers Relating to Ireland (microfilm: original in the Office of Public Records, London) SP 63/171/18 These ships were used for the export of salted and pickled fish, linen, wool, hides and tallow. From Spain and Portugal they would import copper, silk, wine, figs, pomegranates, cumin, cinnamon and saffron.Ireland in Schools: ‚ÄòGrace O‚ÄôMalley, Granuaile: Chieftain, trader, pirate: ships‚Äô: www.iisresource.org/Documents/0A4_Grace_Fleet.ppt The English State Papers of 1599 record that Grace O'Malley's son \\"Tibbot ne Longe\\" (Irish: Tiob√≥id na Long ‚Äì Theobald of the Ships), had three very good ships, each able to carry 300 men.Chambers (1998), p 24, quoting from Knox H.T. (1908), History of the County Mayo, Dublin, p 250. It is likely, however, that such ships were not as large as the English galleon. They were certainly vulnerable to cannon fire (their light construction meant they could carry no great guns themselves), though they could easily hold their own with English craft of a similar size.Rixson (1998), p 50, quoting from an account by Captain Plessington of the warship Tramontana, which captured an Irish galley between Teelin and Killbegs in Donegal in July 1601: Not withstanding she rowed with thirty oars and had on board ready to defend her a hundred good shots which entertained a skirmish with my boat for most of an hour and had put her to the worst. Coming up with my ship to the rescue, I quickly, with my great shot made an end to the fray. This galley comes out of Connaught and belongs to Grany O‚ÄôMalley whereof a base son of hers is captain.

He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 16 February 2011. The character was created and introduced along with his two brothers; Heath (Dan Ewing) and half- brother, Casey (Lincoln Younes). The trio were nicknamed The River Boys and were inspired by the real life Bra Boys group. When Peacocke learnt about the role of Brax, he initially thought he would not suit the part as he is from the country. However, after learning more about the character, Peacocke successfully auditioned for the role. Peacocke's departure was announced on 1 February 2015 and Brax made a temporary exit on 10 June 2015, before returning on 9 December. He made his final appearance on 7 June 2016. Before the character's arrival on screen, Debbie Schipp of The Daily Telegraph described him as being a \\"beach bum\\" with a reputation for being an \\"awesome\\" surfer. Brax is a feared member of the River Boys, a surfie group from Mangrove River, and he commands a respect from them. However, Brax has always wanted to make something of himself and Peacocke revealed that he wanted a successful family life. Brax storylines often revolved around his long-running relationship with Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson) until her death. Brax dealt with his grief by cage-fighting, which he started doing to pay off a debt. Brax later had relationships with Natalie Davison (Catherine Mack) and Ricky Sharpe (Bonnie Sveen), who also gave birth to Brax's son. For his portrayal of Brax, Peacocke has won the Logie Awards for Most Popular New Male Talent and Most Popular Actor. Creation and casting In 2010, Network Seven began running teaser trailers for a new trio of characters known as The River Boys. Said to be a \\"bad-boy surf gang with dodgy reputations\\", The River Boys initially consisted of three brothers ‚Äì Casey, Heath and Darryl \\"Brax\\" Braxton. Kristy Kelly of Digital Spy reported Koby Abberton and his gang, known as the Bra Boys, were the inspiration for The River Boys. Steve Peacocke was cast as eldest Braxton brother, Darryl. He heard about the role from his agent and he was initially unsure he would suit the part as he is from the country. Once Peacocke understood what type of person Darryl was, he believed he could offer something to the role. Peacocke said the audition process was \\"a lot of fun\\" and during a call back, he got to work with Esther Anderson, which made him less nervous. Peacocke made his on screen debut as Brax on 16 February 2011. On 9 May 2013, it was announced that Peacocke would be taking a break from Home and Away, so he could film a role in Hercules: The Thracian Wars. The actor thanked the show's producers and the network for allowing him the time off from the soap and producer Lucy Addario said \\"Steve is a truly great actor so it is no surprise that Hollywood has come calling. We are thrilled to be able to give Steve this short break from Home and Away and support him as he takes up this amazing opportunity.\\" Peacocke returned to Home and Away in September. Development =Characterisation= Upon the character's announcement, Debbie Schipp of The Daily Telegraph reported Darryl was a \\"beach bum\\" who has an awesome reputation as a surfer. Amy Edwards of the Newcastle Herald stated that he is the most revered of the Braxton brothers and a \\"reckless and feared member of the River Boys.\\" Peacocke said the character was first described to him as the leader of an outlaw surfie gang, which made him think of all the men he had met who play sport and are feared, but able to lead their teams at the same time. Peacocke explained to Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that he had learnt a lot from playing Darryl, as he comes from a completely different background to him. When Darryl was twelve, his father walked out on his mother, Cheryl (Suzi Dougherty) and his two brothers, Heath (Dan Ewing) and Casey (Lincoln Younes). Darryl became the man of the house and he tried to keep his younger brothers out of trouble. Despite developing a friends with benefits relationship with Tegan Callahan (Saskia Burmeister), Darryl had never been in love before coming to Summer Bay. A Channel Seven website writer described Darryl as having a \\"dodgy reputation and a chip on his shoulder.\\" He is a surfing legend in his home town of Mangrove River because he was one of the first surfers to take on the rip tides at Wilson's Beach and develop his own surfing style. The Seven writer explained that because Darryl is fearless, he commands a respect from the rest of the surfers that he finds useful. However, Darryl is a \\"reluctant hero\\" and a reporter from Channel 5's Home and Away website commented that he became determined to leave Mangrove River, so he could forge a career as a legitimate business owner. Peacocke backed this statement up, saying Darryl wanted to make something of himself and escape the way of life associated with the River Boys. He later explained \\"He's a bloke who wants to escape his upbringing. He has been pigeon-holed in Summer Bay because of his looks but he wants a legitimate life. He doesn't want riches. At the end of the day he just wants a successful family life.\\" Peacocke spends an hour in make-up every day getting The River Boy's trademark \\"Blood and Sand\\" tattoos painted on his body. The actor revealed the most uncomfortable aspect of playing Darryl was having to take his shirt off. He called it a \\"show pony thing to do\\" and was embarrassed by it. =Relationship with Charlie Buckton= Esther Anderson portrayed Brax's first love interest Charlie Buckton. Schipp from The Daily Telegraph said Brax was set to get to know Charlie Buckton (played by Anderson) in a future storyline. Brax meets Charlie after she comes to ask him to keep his surf gang under control. During his interview with Digital Spy, Peacocke was asked if Brax likes Charlie romantically and he said, \\"For a bloke like Brax, Charlie is pretty ideal ‚Äì she's smart, sexy and is strong enough to take him on. He's all about testing himself and he knows he'll be running a gauntlet if he pursues her. She's got that X-factor he can't ignore.\\" When a fight breaks out at the Surf Club, Charlie arrives to investigate and she asks Brax to step outside, so they can talk. Brax misinterprets the situation and believes Charlie just wants to be alone with him, so he kisses her. Charlie is horrified by his actions and she arrests him for assaulting a police officer. After Brax's arrest, things began to develop \\"dangerously\\" between him and Charlie and Peacoke believed that viewers would find it tense to watch. Charlie comes under pressure from the community to find a more serious crime to charge Brax with. She starts to believe that he is selling stolen alcohol to Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz), but everything checks out and Brax realises the kiss has \\"sparked something\\" in her. The Daily Telegraph's Colin Vickery proclaimed that Brax had turned Charlie's safe world upside down. While Anderson told him \\"What is wonderful about this relationship is that it is forbidden love. There is this element of danger that brings excitement along with it. It is quite different for Charlie. In all her previous relationships she has been hesitant and held back physically and with her feelings.\\" The actress branded the relationship \\"quite fun and flirty.\\" Just as Charlie starts to trust Brax, his ex-girlfriend, Tegan, arrives in the Bay. Peacocke revealed that Tegan comes to do his mother's bidding. After Brax clashes with Cheryl, she contacts Tegan and gets her to work out what has been going on with him. Tegan tries to win Brax back, but is shocked to find he has moved on with Charlie. Even though they share a history, Brax does not trust Tegan and when he learns she has threatened Charlie, he order her to leave town. A show spokesperson said \\"Brax tells Tegan he wants nothing to do with her. As far as he's concerned, she's very much in his past and he has no interest in her any more. She's devastated when he tells her to leave. But there really is nothing worse than a woman scorned.\\" Peacocke thought Brax and Charlie's relationship would not be \\"smooth sailing\\" until Tegan was gone. Charlie suspects Brax has been involved in a drugs operation and breaks up with him. Brax is \\"gutted\\" when she ends their relationship and wants her back. He \\"puts his heart on the line\\" and begs her to try again, but she puts her duties as a policewoman first. After he is rejected, Brax has sex with Tegan and Charlie finds them together. Peacocke thought it was hard to say if Brax and Charlie would get back together, while Vickery quipped that it was obvious Charlie cannot stay away from Brax for long. Brax is linked to an armed robbery, but Charlie, who is investigating the crime, believes Brax is innocent from the start. She decides to interfere with police evidence, but feels guilty about what she has done and goes away to a cabin for a few days with a friend. Brax later turns up and while he and Charlie are talking, he reveals that he still loves her. They get back together, but on the way home they crash into Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead) on his motorbike. Realising Charlie and Brax should be seen together, Heath tells the police that he hit Liam. Charlie then decides to leave the police force. Brax and Charlie decide to move to the city, accompanied by her daughter Ruby (Rebecca Breeds) and Casey. Peacocke stated \\"Brax is now with the one he loves. Charlie's left her job and her career for him, and he's left the brotherhood and the River Boys for her. They both realise what they had in Summer Bay is no longer there, so it's time for a fresh start somewhere completely new.\\" However, Charlie is shot and critically injured by Jake Pirovic (Fletcher Humphrys). When they learn that there is nothing more the doctors can do for her, Ruby and Brax make the decision to turn off Charlie's ventilator. Anderson knew some fans would be disappointed that Brax and Charlie did not end up together, but the series producer had told her that after investing so much in the couple, killing Charlie off was the best option. =Cage fighting= On 13 February 2012, it was announced that Brax would take part in a cage fighting storyline. He decides to take part in the sport to raise some quick money to pay back Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou), who gave money to Geoffrey King (Geoff Morrell) on his behalf. Peacocke revealed that Brax is angry with Leah for paying his debt off and \\"coming to his rescue\\". Peacocke spent weeks rehearsing the choreography for the fight scenes with a stunt coordinator. The Daily Telegraph's Colin Vickery reported that the actor was often hurt during the training and he was left with cuts and grazes over his back. Vickery revealed that the cage fighting helped Brax with his grief over Charlie's death, while Peacocke told him \\"Every bloke has been through a tough time and you just want to punish yourself. There are plenty of blokes out there that can't deal with things emotionally and don't want to talk to anyone about it and they just want to put themselves in harm's way. Brax wants to feel some pain. For him, it is cathartic.\\" Brax is knocked unconscious during a robbery at his restaurant, but decides to go ahead with a cage fight. Despite knowing he is not fit to fight, Brax \\"puts himself in danger by taking part in another tough battle\\". Leah tries to talk him out of it, but Brax ignores her pleas and goes ahead with the fight. Brax is risking his own health and things soon take a turn for the worse. Peacocke explained \\"He wins the fight, but he's taken so many blows to the head - and that, coupled with the mugging, tips him over the edge and he passes out and has a fit.\\" Brax is taken to the hospital, which is difficult for him because it is where Charlie died. He struggles with his grief and Leah tries to help him. When Leah puts her hand on his, Brax then realises that she has feelings for him. Speaking to TV Week's Erin McWhirter, Peacocke revealed that his character is shocked by it and did not see it coming. In his interview with Digital Spy's Kilkelly, the actor called the cage fighting storyline \\"awesome\\" and he expressed his wishes to return to it in the future. =Relationship with Natalie Davison= Catherine Mack plays Natalie Davison. In June 2012, it was revealed that school counsellor Natalie Davison (Catherine Mack) would become Brax's new love interest. Some Home and Away fans voiced their \\"outrage\\" at Brax's new romance on social networking sites, while others thought he should date Leah instead. Peacocke told Kilkelly \\"The reaction has been mixed, mostly because people miss the whole Charlie and Brax storyline. But the new relationship has been equally exciting to play and is taking a new direction. I think fans are really starting to see it as something new and enjoying it.\\" Mack told a TV Week writer that Natalie finds Brax interesting, while Brax respects her for trying to help Casey. He likes that she brings out a new side in himself. Peacocke thought Natalie was a \\"good fit\\" for his character and hoped he could offload some of his baggage, so he could move forward with her. Mack told TV Week's Gavin Scott that Natalie finds Brax attractive, but he is not at the front of her mind because she is focused on helping Casey through his issues. However, to help Casey, she must go through Brax and learn more about their situation. Brax and Natalie arrange to have a drink together, but he is forced to cancel so he can deal with a family emergency. Brax and Natalie later have a one-night stand. Brax runs into Natalie shortly after making a drug deal to raise some money. She is suspicious and annoyed that he has not been in contact with her, just as they were starting to build up a relationship to help Casey. Peacocke told Scott that Brax does not want Natalie thinking he is a drug dealing criminal because he has spent time with her trying to prove that he is not, so he shuts down. Mack said \\"She can see through his act. She believes with her whole heart he's a good person. She will not stop until she makes him realise that.\\" At that moment, Brax and Natalie connect and share \\"an intense kiss\\", which leads to them spending the night together. Mack stated that \\"caution is thrown to the wind\\" and neither Brax or Natalie think about what they are doing. Peacocke revealed that the next day Brax starts rethinking and regretting, while Natalie wonders if she has crossed a line. The couple decide to put their romance on hold, so Natalie can continue to counsel Casey without anything getting in the way. Brax agrees with the plan, even though Casey insists they should put their relationship first. Mack revealed that Natalie and Brax would share more scenes together, saying \\"Their attraction to each other is undeniable, and even though it's not the key focus, they can't help but continue to be around each other and be attracted to each other.\\" =Departure and return= On 1 February 2015, Jonathon Moran of The Daily Telegraph reported that Peacocke had quit Home and Away to pursue new acting roles in Hollywood. Peacocke filmed his final scenes in December 2014. Of his departure, he stated \\"It wasn't something I was looking forward to because I love the show and the people I work with so much. But I think the key to any good TV series or any good storytelling is to leave the audience at the right point, and where we got to with Brax, we hit a point where it was the best point for him to exit the show. It was just the perfect time I guess.\\" Brax was the last of the original three Braxton brothers to leave the show. His exit storyline saw the car transferring him to jail run off the road and plunge into a lake. David Knox from TV Tonight commented that storyliners would have left the door open for Peacocke to return in the future. Brax departed on 10 June. On 22 August 2015, Moran announced that Peacocke had returned to Home and Away to shoot scenes for episodes that would air in late 2015. Of his return, Peacocke commented \\"It is a nice little surprise. It was a good story the producers put to me, so I thought it is a nice way to see everyone for a bit. It will be an interesting little twist. While Brax is in the Bay it will spice things up a bit, I think.\\" Peacocke's return storyline was kept top-secret, and was not revealed until his episodes were broadcast. Ahead of Brax's final appearance, Home and Away aired their first two-hander episode on 15 February 2016. The episode featured Brax and Ricky discussing their relationship and his decision to fake his death. The character made his final appearance on 7 June 2016, where he reunited with Ricky and his son. Storylines Brax and the River Boys go along to a singles night at Angelo's restaurant. They start a brawl and Brax's brother, Heath, punches Miles Copeland (Josh Quong Tart). The following day, Brax tries to smooth things over and visits Angelo Rosetta with a case of alcohol to make up for what happened in his restaurant. Angelo accepts the apology and Brax makes him an offer to supply the restaurant with some cheap alcohol. The River Boys start causing trouble around the town and local policewoman Charlie Buckton keeps an eye on them. Brax starts making suggestions on how to improve Angelo's restaurant and goes into partnership with him. He later uses the restaurant for money laundering. Brax takes Leah Patterson-Baker out to lunch in order to ask her more about Charlie. When trouble with the River Boys escalates, Charlie is called to the Surf Club to sort it out. She takes Brax outside to talk, but he kisses her and is arrested. However, Brax's lawyer gets him released. Charlie later comes to Brax and asks him to keep his younger brother, Casey, away from her daughter, Ruby. During an argument, Brax kisses Charlie and they have sex. Charlie later tells him it was a mistake, however she starts to feel that she misjudged him and they begin a secret relationship. Angelo discovers the Braxton's have a marijuana crop in the National Park and Heath knocks him out. Brax tells Charlie that he has nothing to do with the crop and gets a member of their gang to drop Angelo off at the hospital. Brax realises Brodie Upton (Guy Edmonds) has stolen drugs from him and he sets him up to be arrested. However, Brodie avoids the police and threatens Brax with a gun. He finds out about Brax and Charlie's relationship, before Brax manages to get him out of town. Charlie decides to publicly reveal her romance with Brax, but Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances) warns them both against it. Angelo also discovers the relationship and blackmails Brax into buying his half of the restaurant. Brax finds out Casey has quit school, but he manages to get him to change his mind. This causes Cheryl to throw Casey out of their home and he and Brax stay in a motel. Tegan Callahan arrives in town and tries to get back with Brax. She discovers his new relationship with Charlie and Brax orders her to leave. Heath challenges Brax's leadership of the River Boys and Brax decides to leave the group. Heath plans to raid Jake Pirovic drug crop and Tegan tells Brax that Jake is going to ambush him. Charlie arrests both Heath and Jake following the raid. When Brax does not deny he is involved with the drug dealing, Charlie breaks up with him. Tegan reveals that Jake asked her to hide some drugs for him and Heath and Brax help her. Brax and Tegan have a one-night stand, which Charlie finds out about. Jake is released and he demands his drugs back. He takes Ruby and Casey hostage, until Brax hands the drugs over. A fight breaks out and Brax is stabbed. Charlie finds him and takes him to hospital. Tegan states that her daughter, Darcy (Alea O'Shea), is Brax's and he tries to bond with her. However, Tegan later reveals that Darcy is actually Heath's daughter. Brax and Charlie get back together and Heath finds out about them, forcing Charlie to reveal the truth to her superior. A gang war breaks out and Jake's brother, Hammer (Benedict Samuel), has Heath beaten up. Tegan is injured in a car accident and she tells Brax that she revealed his relationship with Charlie to Hammer, before dying. Brax learns Casey burnt Jake's place down and tries to cover up the crime. Hammer kidnaps Charlie and lures Brax to a container to kill him. A fight breaks out and Charlie shoots Hammer dead. Casey is found guilty of the arson attack at Jake's place and sent to juvie. Brax begins dating Hayley O'Connor (Alyssa McClelland). Brax is linked to an armed robbery and learns he has been set up on Jake's orders. He admits to the police that he was in bed with Hayley at the time of the robbery, but she refuses to confirm his story. Charlie informs Brax that she and a fellow officer are moving the evidence against him and tells him where they will be stopping, allowing Brax to steal it. Brax joins Charlie at a cabin and on the way home they crash into Liam Murphy. Heath and Bianca Scott (Lisa Gormley) tell the police they hit Liam to protect Brax and Charlie. When Charlie quits the police, she and Brax decide to move to the city with Ruby and Casey. However, Jake returns to the Bay and shoots Charlie. Brax finds her and she is rushed to the hospital, where he and Ruby are told that Charlie is brain dead. Brax initially refuses to give up on Charlie, but he eventually decides to let her ventilator be turned off. Ruby accuses Brax of being responsible for Charlie's death and he starts drinking. Brax becomes angry with Heath for accepting stolen alcohol from Geoffrey King and returns it. However, Geoffrey demands $25,000 or the restaurant. Leah stops Brax from burning Angelo's down and he becomes furious when she pays Geoffrey off. To pay her back, Brax begins cage fighting. One night, Brax is knocked unconscious when someone robs the restaurant. He refuses to pull out of his next fight and he collapses shortly after winning. Brax is taken to hospital to recover and Leah stays with him. Brax then realises she has feelings for him. When Leah gets drunk, Brax takes her home and she tries to kiss him. Brax learns Heath has hired Hayley as his lawyer and he takes her to a clifftop, where he blames her for getting Jake out of jail. Hayley hits him with a rock and dares him to kill her, but Brax lets her go. Brax learns Heath is trying to get their father, Danny (Andy McPhee), out of jail and warns him against it. Brax visits Danny and remains convinced that he has not changed. Casey questions Brax about Danny and he reveals that he used to take him out of the house when Danny got angry and that he once put Heath in hospital. Brax is unhappy when Casey visits Danny and gets on well with him. He also dislikes it when school counsellor Natalie Davison tries to talk to him about Casey's feelings and shuts the door on her when she mentions Charlie. Danny is freed from prison and he moves into the Caravan Park. Brax manages to get his mother to leave town and tells Danny that his money that he left behind is gone. Danny demands that Brax pay back his money and Brax agrees. He is later knocked out and left out in the bush to die, but Sid Walker (Robert Mammone) finds him and takes him back home. Brax then realises Danny ordered the attack. To get some money to pay his father back, Brax organises a drugs deal, which goes wrong when the police turn up. However, Brax successfully hides the drugs away and completes the deal. When he runs into Natalie, he pushes her away. However, she tells him she is not scared of him and they have sex. Casey admits to Brax that he is spending time with Danny, so he can stay one step ahead and stop him from targeting Ruby and her money. Brax learns Casey has gone off with Danny, who has been planning to rob a local pub. Brax and Natalie get to the pub just as a shot rings out. They find Casey has shot Danny and he later dies. Brax tries to intimidate the only witness into going along with a fabricated story, but Casey confesses to the crime. He struggles to cope with what he has done, so Brax and Natalie decide to put their relationship on hold to help him. Brax realises Casey is hurting and they decide to spend some time together in the forest. After going to get some food, Brax returns to the camp to find Casey gone. He and Natalie drive out to the desert to find Casey and learn that he has been kidnapped by Kyle Bennett (Nic Westaway), Casey and Brax's half-brother. Reception =Accolades= For his portrayal of Brax, Peacocke was nominated for Best Male Performance at the 2011 AACTA Television Awards. He went on to win the Logie Award for Most Popular New Male Talent in 2012. Peacocke was also nominated for Best Daytime Star at the 2012 Inside Soap Awards. In 2013, Peacocke won the Most Popular Actor Logie Award. He was also nominated for Most Popular Personality On Australian TV. That same year, Peacocke also won Best Daytime Star at the Inside Soap Awards. In 2014, Peacocke received nominations for Most Popular Actor and Most Popular Personality on TV at the Logie Awards. He was nominated in the same categories the following year, and won Most Popular Actor. Peacocke won three awards at the 2015 TV Week and Soap Extra #OMGAwards for Favourite Couple between Brax and Ricky, Best Abs, and Best Storyline for Brax's fake death/escape. Peacocke earned a nomination for Best Actor at the 2016 Logie Awards. =Critical response= When Inside Soap ran a poll asking readers which Braxton brother they liked the most, Darryl came in first place with 44% of the vote. In March 2011, Tristan Swanwick and Nathanael Cooper of The Courier-Mail reported that fans of the Braxton brothers had set up Facebook pages for the three actors and used personal photos of them. The accounts attracted many fan messages and friend requests. Swanwick and Cooper commented \\"One would have thought the difficulty of being cast as a \\"River Boy\\" on Home and Away would be the ever-present threat of a Bra Boy taking offence to a storyline.\\" Andrew Mercado writing for TV Week said that Home and Away was ignoring its core value of families and foster children in favour of the River Boys and he wanted to see less of them on- screen. While they were a success story and ratings wise, he noted that there were viewer concerns about the accompanying violence. He also predicted that the \\"tattooed surfie boys\\" would not be around forever because the actors would want to try their luck in Hollywood. Channel 5 included the arrival of the Braxtons in their \\"Top 20 Aussie Soap Moments of 2011\\" program, with the storyline came fourth overall. A writer for the Inside Soap Yearbook proclaimed the character's screen debut was one of \\"The Best Bits of March 2011.\\" A Western Mail reporter commented \\"Ever since the Braxtons sauntered into the Bay, they've been nothing but trouble.\\" Carena Crawford from All About Soap blamed Brax for Charlie's death and commented \\"Bad boys are trouble. And despite all Brax's claims that he was going straight, he'd still angered enough people in the past to get his girlfriend killed.\\" In 2012, TV Week readers voted Charlie and Brax their most popular Home and Away couple of all time. They received fifty per cent of the vote and Peacocke said \\"I think fans enjoyed the drama, but they're disappointed Charlie is gone and there isn't the opportunity for her to return.\\" In 2015, Laura Withers of Inside Soap commented \\"Brax may be prime Summer Bay beef, but he hasn't got an ounce of common sense!\\" References External links * Darryl Braxton at the Official AU Home and Away website * Darryl Braxton at the Official UK Home and Away website Category:Television characters introduced in 2011 Category:Home and Away characters Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Fictional career criminals Category:Fictional drug dealers Category:Fictional surfers Category:Fictional gang members Category:Male characters in television Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas ","title":"Darryl Braxton"},{"id":"33232977","text":"Star Ruler is a space 4X / RTS hybrid developed and published by American company Blind Mind Studios.Star Ruler. StrategyCore (2010-08-21). Retrieved on 2012-01-16. was first announced on July 5, 2009 in the Irrlicht Community Forumsannouncement on irrlicht.sourceforge.net, the game engine on which was based. It was released on August 21, 2010. The game was launched in retail outlets in the EU on August 16, 2011 via Iceberg Interactive and was planned to launch Mid-October in the US via Interactive Gaming Software (IGS). However this deal fell through and never launched in retail outlets in the United States.  Gameplay  features a 1 to 10,000+ star system count galaxy of configurable shape. The size of the in-game universe is only limited by the processing power of the user's computer. Generated systems may have orbiting planets, moons, asteroids, comets, or aggressive, capturable, NPC assets.star- ruler-review on bit-tech.net (2011-09-23) Gameplay occurs in a single space in real-time with the rate of time determined by the player. also features Newtonian mechanics in its ship movement. Key differences from other games of the genre are: Detailed unit creation, behavior, and automation customization, physically modeled star systems and orbiting bodies, and a lack of traditional maintenance and unit count cap game mechanics.  Ship Building  One of 's most impressive components is the ship construction. Each ship is built around a hull type. Different hulls will fulfil different purposes. For example, a Heavy hull is more resilient, but offers less space for components. A station hull is very resilient, and offers the most component space, but cannot mount engines. Each component can be scaled, and its effects scaled with it. For example, a 2.0 railgun will do half as much damage as a 4.0 railgun, which is the largest size, but will also consume half the power. Things like a bridge, life support, crew quarters, and power generators are necessary for most ships. The most unusual feature of 's ship building system is the ability to scale ships. It is possible to build everything from a near microscopic scout ship to colossal dreadnoughts that are larger than a star.

The company was founded by fellow University of Washington archaeology graduate students Tim Hunt, Carl Lipo, Mark Madsen, and David Quinn.  History  Allrecipes.com was founded in 1997 after co-founder Hunt had trouble finding his favorite cookie recipe on the Internet. The recipe sharing and cooking community website began as an offshoot of one of Seattle's first web companies, Emergent Media. The company's original website was CookieRecipe.com. After Cookierecipe came Cakerecipe.com, Chickenrecipe.com, Pierecipe.com, Beefrecipe.com. After launching 38 different domains, the company consolidated all its websites into Allrecipes.com. The core of the small founding team consisted of Yann Oehl, Kala Kushnik, Ursula Dalzell, and Sydny Carter. In 1999 Allrecipes.com hired Bill Moore, a former Starbucks executive, as its CEO. In 2006 Reader's Digest purchased Allrecipes.com for $66 million. Reader's Digest sold the company to the Meredith Corporation in 2012 for $175 million.  Website  The recipes on the website are posted by members of the Allrecipes.com community, and then copyedited by staff. Members of the community can also rate and review recipes, as well as add photos of the finished dish. Recipes are categorized by season, type (such as appetizer or dessert), and ingredients. Search functionality supports requiring and excluding specific ingredients. Other categories include methods (such as grilling or baking), occasions, and cooking style. There is support for finding meal ideas for specific holidays. Allrecipes.com is available for iPhone, iPad, Windows Phone, and Android users. Allrecipes.com's app for smartphones, Dinner Spinner, allows users to access the site and its user-uploaded content while on the go. In 2011 Alison Sherwood of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel rated the site as one of her \\"five favorite food apps.\\" The app allows users to search recipes and include specifications in their search (such as type of meal, nutrition, key ingredients, and time needed to prepare the dish). Recipes can be saved and easily shared on Twitter and Facebook. In September 2015 Allrecipes.com launched a revamped website as part of a broader transformation into a social networking service for food lovers. The September 2015 website relaunch was met with broad criticism with the most common grievance being the perceived decrease in usability. Meredith closed 14 international Allrecipes domains October 16, 2018.

It features Andrew McCarthy and Evan Williams as father and son on a road-trip from Oregon to Washington, D.C. transporting their own Sitka Spruce tree on a truck to be planted across from the White House on Thanksgiving. The film was produced and aired by Hallmark Channel. Plot Seventeen-year-old Rock Burdock (Evan Williams) wins a nationwide contest for his tree to be planted across the White House. Faith Russel (Kari Matchett), marketing representative of the company Box of Toys who is in charge of the project, visits Rock and his father Corey (Andrew McCarthy). Corey planted the tree in their garden when Rock was born. He has reservations about the idea of transporting his tree cross country, but agrees under the condition that they deliver the tree themselves. While father and son drive the truck, Faith follows them most of the time in her car. Father and son are unable to strengthen their bonding and further dissensions arise along the way. However, Rock films the entire trip on camera and posts it on his vlog. This gathers more and more fans on the internet and on the road and even causes some media coverage. Rock's internet acquaintance and love interest Katie (Paula Brancati) joins Rock on the way. Together they reach Washington, D.C. on Thanksgiving. Meanwhile, Faith's boss (Ted Atherton) secretly changed the plan. He wants to repeat the contest every year and therefore decides to erect the tree rather than planting it. After Faith's attempts to persuade her boss fail, the team now cuffs Rock to the tree and protest against its destruction. Using their media attention soon more people support their protest. Finally the President of the United States calls the Park ranger on his cell phone and tells him to plant the tree. Later Rock, Corey, Faith and Katie are invited to attend the Christmas lighting of the tree by the President.

Early life Diaz grew up in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, where she was home-schooled by her Peruvian mother, Nancy, a proponent of early childhood development and the visual arts, and her Danish father, Eric, a woodworker and musician. Diaz began piano lessons at age five from her father. In her early teens, Diaz switched from piano to guitar. She was featured in Rock School, director Don Argott's 2005 documentary about the program as Madi Diaz- Svalgard. Her father Eric Svalg√•rd is a member of the Frank Zappa tribute band Project/Object. Music career After high school, Diaz was accepted to Berklee College of Music. At Berklee, she began working with Kyle Ryan, the Nebraska-raised guitarist who would be her songwriting collaborator for her early career. The two began their collaboration when a fellow student, a producer looking for a project, offered Diaz the chance to record an album in Hawaii. The self-released album Skin And Bones (2007) was the result, and a songwriting and performing partnership between Diaz and Ryan stuck. Shortly after, Diaz dropped out of the program at Berklee. In 2008, Diaz and Ryan continued writing and began playing shows in New York City. There, she met her manager and signed to publisher Cherry Lane Music. Diaz and Ryan were then sent to Nashville for a month to write, and in mid-2010 moved to Nashville. After releasing the EP, Ten Gun Salute, Diaz began touring with The Civil Wars and Landon Pigg. She was featured in Paste magazine as one of the ‚ÄúTop Ten Buzziest Acts‚Äù at SXSW 2009, and had songs featured on cw The originals ABC Family's Pretty Little Liars, and Lifetime's Drop Dead Diva, Army Wives, and Princesses: Long Island. Her EP, Far From The Things That We Know, was released on September 20, 2011, by TinyOGRE Entertainment. The EP was recorded in Los Angeles and Charlottesville, VA with John Alagia (Dave Matthews Band, John Mayer) serving as producer. The EP previewed songs from her full-length album, Plastic Moon, which was released in January 2012. In February 2012, Diaz moved to Los Angeles, marking a new chapter in her music career. Now working solo, her next album, We Threw Our Hearts In The Fire, was released on October 23, 2012. Diaz appeared as a guest on Last Call with Carson Daly on the January 13, 2014 episode. She released the single \\"Stay Together\\" on July 11, 2014. It is the first single off of her album, Phantom, which was released in September 2014. The song \\"The End of the Day,\\" written by Diaz and Sarah Siskind, was featured on the television series Nashville, and is performed by Connie Britton and Charles Esten.

It is owned and operated by the Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA). Its construction was in response to growing power demands and a lack of dam sites on the Grand River. The first phase was completed in 1968 and the second in 1971. The upper reservoir for the power station is Lake W. R. Holway which was built on Saline Creek and the lower reservoir is Lake Hudson on the Grand River. During periods of lower power demand, water is pumped from Lake Hudson to Lake Holway and released back down through the pump-generators during periods of high energy demand.Wagman, David. Power Engineering. \\"Salina Pumped Storage Project.\\" May 1, 2006. Retrieved September 17, 2011. Design philosophy The process essentially consists of pumping water from a lower elevation into a containment at a higher elevation. In this step, the mechanical device used to move the water acts like a conventional pump to lift the water. External power, in this case an electric motor, supplies the needed energy. Later, the external power is switched off and water flows backward through the device, enabling it to function as a hydraulic turbine generating energy to drive an electric power generator. Ideally, the power generated would offset the power consumed in elevating the water. In practice, there are inefficiencies in the system that cause the power consumed raising the water to significantly exceed the energy generated during the reversal of water flow. GRDA has stated that pumping water from Lake Hudson (the source) into Lake W. R. Holway (the receiver) consumes nearly twice the power that can be recovered from the hydraulic generator. The real benefit from the process is that the owner can use power for pumping when overall power demand from customers is lower, and supply electric power when customer demand is higher. It is an effective way to provide peaking power because the system can be brought on line (or taken off line) very quickly. Construction The project was constructed in two stages: :Stage 1 consisted of building an earth and rock filled dam in Chimney Rock Hollow high, creating Chimney Rock Reservoir. A canal long led from the dam to a forebay structure that had openings for steel penstocks, each in diameter. Three penstocks led from the forebay to a powerhouse that housed three horsepower pump-generators, with a total rated capacity of . This stage was completed in 1968. :Stage 2 comprised building three more penstocks, extending the powerhouse and adding three more pump- generators, all identical to those installed in Stage 1. This doubled the facility's capacity to 260 mw. It was completed in 1971.GRDA. Salina Pumped- Storage Project The SPSP is controlled remotely from the GRDA Energy Control Center at the Robert S. Kerr Dam, which created Lake Hudson. Glenn Roberson, \\"Grand River Dam Authority.\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture In 1981, Chimney Rock Reservoir was renamed Lake W. R.

Retrieved September 24, 2011. Effects of drought on operation Severe drought in 2005 greatly reduced runoff in the entire Grand River watershed.

The song laments what can be done with an Electronic Benefit Transfer card (used for financial entitlements in the United States.) The song and its video became controversial, especially among conservative pundits, who considered the song a glorification of the country's welfare system. Content The lyrics of \\"My EBT\\" are based on real-life examples of welfare abuse that Lafleur had witnessed first-hand. The song laments a person using their sister's E.B.T. card (which is considered to be a fraudulent and hence also abusive use of the card) to acquire a large array of junk food (mostly potato chips and soft drinks) from various stores (\\"never going hungry, swiping all day\\"), and attempting to, but failing to also purchase marijuana and alcohol on the card as well. As an excuse for the actions, the song also states that it is okay because \\"it's an E.B.T., it ain't food stamps.\\" The song was also accompanied by a music video posted on YouTube, which featured Lafleur going around to various stores to purchase junk food using an E.B.T. card, much like what is described in the song itself.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IGfe2tAUbM Reception The song gained attention when its music video was posted by the Drudge Report.

It is designed to perform as an inexpensive, more versatile substitute for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and modern light attack aircraft. On 26 July 2014, the Ahrlac conducted its maiden flight; on 13 August 2014, the aircraft performed its first public flight display at Wonderboom Airport. Both armed and unarmed models of the aircraft are to be sold, as well as a potential unmanned version. In March 2016 Boeing announced a partnership with Paramount Group to cooperate on an advanced mission system for the armed variant of the AHRLAC known as \\"MWARI\\". Development =Origins= In 2009, Paramount Group began working on a new light turboprop-powered counter-insurgency aircraft.Majumdar, Dave. \\"South Africa's Dirt-Cheap War Machine.\\" The National Interest, 9 October 2015. The design study examined a fixed-wing aircraft as an affordable platform for both civilian and military applications as an alternative to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).Jeffrey, Colin. \\"AHRLAC: The first multi-platform military aircraft designed and built in Africa.\\" New Atlas , 15 August 2014. The design of the proposed aircraft drew on the company's prior experience producing helicopters, and several design elements, such as the steep tandem canopy adopted, have been attributed to this source of inspiration; the aircraft is intended to act as a viable alternative for helicopters. It had been conceived as an affordable intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and light-strike platform, for which the developers had identified as there being an increasing level of market demand for such an aircraft. Critically, it was recognised that jet-powered aircraft such as the Sukhoi Su-25 that were typically being used in this role were often overly-equipped and quite costly to operate in such capacities; thus a strong emphasis on low-cost operations was established early on. In September 2011, design work on the Ahrlac project was formally initiated. According to its developers, the aircraft has been designed with the needs of First World customers in mind. It has also been claimed by its designers that the Ahrlac is to be the first fully indigenous military aircraft developed in Africa; additionally, it shall be the first South African military aircraft of any sort since the Denel Rooivalk attack helicopter, In 2011, the manufacturer stated that the price of the aircraft was projected at being under US$10 million per aircraft; the potential market for Ahrlac has been described as potentially being \\"in the hundreds or thousands of units\\". According to aviation author Bill Sweetman, the Ahrlac is likely to come at least partially into competition with the Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano and the Beechcraft T-6 Texan II; unlike either of those aircraft, it does not have any trainer heritage and thus is shaped distinctly differently, being more specialised to its low-intensity warfare role. In addition to existing manned products, the Ahrlac is intended to compete with UAVs in the marketplace; Paramount claims that the aircraft will be cheaper to acquire and operate than UAVs, since the manned models of the Ahrlac shall not need the expensive subsystems required for the remote control of unmanned aircraft. In 2011, a full-scale mockup of the Ahrlac was constructed, alongside a quarter-scale flight-capable model that was later used for a total of 80 test flights. The first full-scale prototype, designated as the Experimental Demonstrator (XDM), was completed using design for manufacture technology, which allowed for jigless construction to be performed, thus producing both time and cost savings. Of the aircraft's 6,000 components, 98 per cent had been designed using CATIA software and were domestically manufactured. In May 2014, the flight test program commenced at Wonderboom Airport near Pretoria, the first prototype having been moved there from Aerosud's facility in Centurion, Gauteng. In July 2014, the ground test phase was reportedly completed. =Flight testing= Ahrlac on static display at Waterkloof AFB during the 2014 African Aerospace & Defence airshow On 26 July 2014, the first Ahrlac prototype conducted its maiden flight from Wonderboom.Sweetman, Bill. \\"South Africa's Ahrlac Is Airborne.\\" Aviation Week, 18 August 2014. It was initially deployed on a 20-hour flight test program to contrast computer simulations against data from the prototype's real-world flight performance; during each of these flights, telemetry data was gathered inflight by a specially-equipped Pilatus PC-12 chase plane. The initial prototype is to be used to prove the flight characteristics and performance of the aircraft, while the second prototype, designated as the Advanced Demonstrator (ADM), shall be for testing armaments and mission systems. Advanced flight testing is to be carried out for the Ahrlac's full lifecycle as well.Oliver, Daniel. \\"Paramount's AHRLAC makes its first flight.\\" IHS Jane's Defence Weekly , 13 August 2014. By February 2015, the first prototype had completed 65 hours of incident-free flying; as a result, the test program proceeded to the next phase, under which the flight envelope was progressively expanded to explore and evaluate its handling, center of gravity, flight performance, airframe qualities, and rough field capabilities.\\"Paramount Prepares for Production of AHRLAC.\\" ASD News, 24 February 2015. According to Paramount, several prospective customers had shown interest in the aircraft, particularly from the Middle East; the construction of the second prototype was also underway and had been proceeding smoothly so far. The initial prototype is claimed to have \\"matched all out initial predictions very closely\\". By September 2016, the prototype had accumulated 250 flying hours during tests, as well as a total of four deployments to the South African border and to neighbouring Botswana for the purpose of operationally representative trials.Donald, Davis. \\"South Africa‚Äôs AHRLAC Advances Toward Production.\\" AIN Online, 22 September 2016. An improvised trial flight had also been conducted during an outbreak of civil unrest in South Africa. By September 2016, the developers were in the process of building a new assembly line at Wonderboom, this facility is expected to produce the initial two production aircraft in 2017. The Wonderboom factory is to be capable of producing up to two aircraft per month; it is reportedly readily expandable to double its current size, dependent on customer demand. =Further development= In 2014, the developers revealed that, in addition to the previously-announced crewed model of the Ahrlac, they were also in the process of developing an unmanned variant as well. According to Janes, the unmanned model of the Ahrlac had its origins in the quarter-scale model that had been produced for flight testing purposes, which had revealed favourable tendencies towards such a use.Donald, Davis. \\"Small but smart UAV s under development.\\" IHS Jane's 360, 19 September 2014. By September 2014, a pair of prototype unmanned vehicles, which had received the name \\"Mwari\\", had been produced. The Mwari UAV is considerably smaller than the manned Ahrlac counterpart, possessing a reduced flight endurance of only 4 hours along with a sensor turret in the nose.Martin, Guy. \\"Paramount to develop mid-size UAV as it grows unmanned product range.\\" defenceweb.co.za, 7 October 2014. The UAV was renamed \\"Mwewe\\", as the Mwari name is used for an armed version of the full scale manned Ahrlac. In March 2016, American aerospace firm Boeing announced that it had entered into a development partnership with Paramount with the aim of producing a militarized version of the Ahrlac. Under this agreement, Boeing shall develop an integrated mission system that will provide the Ahrlac with intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and weapons system capabilities; this equipment is presented as being optional, and that some customers may prefer to opt for simpler systems instead. \\"Boeing, Paramount Team Up to Add Weapons to Mwari.\\" AW&ST;, 10 March 2016.Atherton, Kelsey D. \\"Boeing Will Arm South Africa's Weird Plane.\\" Popular Science, 8 March 2016.

In February 2018, an announcement was made that the improved AHRLAC design will be marketed in the USA under the name \\"Bronco II\\". \\"Bronco Combat Systems Press Release\\", 22 February 2018 In May 2020, BRONCO II, Paramount Group's Americanized variant of the AHRLAC, in partnership with Leidos and Vertex Aerospace, offered the light attack and surveillance aircraft to U.S. Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, for its Armed Overwatch program. =Financial issues and Business Rescue= As of 28 February 2019, the AHRLAC program has been placed into business rescue with the Wonderboom factory being shutdown and all 140 employees sent home. \\"DefenceWeb - Business rescue for AHRLAC?\\", 4 March 2019 In August 2019, a business rescue plan was announced for AHRLAC, with Paramount taking full control of the Aerospace Development Corporation (ADC) and its subsidiaries, according to the proposition. In September 2020, ADC stated that production of the Ahrlac had restarted. Design The Ahrlac features a twin-boom, single-pusher-engine, high-mounted forward-swept wing configuration, giving the aircraft an unconventional external appearance and providing for excellent external visibility. It is powered by a single Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A turboprop engine; it has a top speed of 310 mph, roughly double that of most helicopters and similar to larger military UAVs such as the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper, along with a flight endurance of seven hours. It is flown by a crew of two, who are seated in tandem configuration, both being provided with Martin-Baker ejection seats and HOTAS (hands on stick-and-throttle) control functionality. The narrow airframe is composed of a combination of metal and composite construction, and is designed to provide maximum crew visibility.\\"South African Manufacturer Targets Recce, Light Attack Market.\\" AW&ST;, 27 September 2011. The aircraft overall is claimed to be inexpensive and easy to manufacture, AHRLAC's CEO, Dr Paul Potgieter, has contrasted the ease of assembly to that of a Meccano set. The Ahrlac has been designed to be capable of operating from austere runways and rough fields; it also possesses STOL (Short Take Off/Landing) and rapid deployment capabilities. It has been envisioned that the aircraft shall perform various mission roles, including intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) and counter-insurgency missions; coastal patrol, anti-smuggling and disaster relief capabilities are also projected mission profiles. In order for the Ahrlac to effectively engage in the diverse range of missions it is capable of, it features a reconfigurable nose, a large mission bay for avionics beneath the two-person cockpit, and the lower fuselage consists of a variety of interchangeable conformal modular units. These modules allow the aircraft to be outfitted with a variety of sensor systems such as infrared and optical cameras, synthetic aperture radar, electronic intelligence gathering and various electronic warfare packages. Additionally, electro-optical turrets can be installed both on the nose and belly of the aircraft. The avionics employ an open architecture, further adding to the ease of adding, upgrading and swapping components and systems. The armed Mwari version is designed to carry a single 20 mm cannon, which is internally mounted into the fuselage. Additionally, it is fitted with either four or six hardpoints for carrying weapons mounted under the wings, including rocket pods, unguided bombs, and various air-to-surface and air-to-air missiles. Armour for the aircraft is also modular and can be added or removed entirely dependent on the mission requirements.

The library is a member of the Libraries of Middlesex Automation Consortium. History In 1825, several Perth Amboy citizens created the Perth Amboy Library Company, but disbanded in 1835 with the book collection being scattered. The Perth Amboy Library Association was created in 1888, again by a group of locals citizens who in 1891 the saw the library became incorporated under state law. In 1896, the Perth Amboy Free Public Library, with municipal support. From its inception the library relocated five times. Carnegie building The current building is one of the first of New Jersey's original 36 Carnegie libraries, built with partial funding from the Andrew Carnegie in 1901. It was built on land donated by J. C. Mc Coy, of the Raritan Copper Works. A donation of $1,000 from Adolph Lewisohn was made to purchase new books. The city agreed to operate and maintain the new facility. Dedicated on December 3, 1903, it one of three Carnegie libraries opened that year still in use. In 1914, the Carnegie Corporation donated an additional $30,000 for the creation of two reading rooms. A Children's Library was added in 1925, but was destroyed by fire in 1977 and not rebuilt. The Children's Library was the basement, a space which had been used as a meeting room and theater. A branch library was created ath the Shull School in 1925, but later closed to make way for additional classrooms. In 2010, renovations of the original building, including the replacement windows and repairs to the roof, were made as part of a restoration project. A $30,000 study released in 2010 recommends exposing hidden skylights, enlarging the children's library, as well as new restrooms, stairs and elevators to make the facility wheelchair-friendly. An outdoor garden, a meeting room, a local history room, a magazine-reading room and air- conditioning are suggested. It is estimated total costs would run about $3.5 million dollars. In August 2010 the library received from New Jersey a certification of eligibility for the state and national registers of historic places, but has not yet been listed. Expansion plans At 12,351 square feet, the current building does not satisfy the state's 27,214-square-feet minimum required size for a library and is considered too small for the city's 51,000 residents. The 2010 study calls for adding 22,500 square feet by constructing an addition on the east side of the property. Total costs for renovation and new construction are estimated at $9 million.

Biography =Early life in Europe= Shmuel Joseph Schweig (S.J. Schweig) was a photographer born in 1905 in Galicia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He showed interest in photography still while in Tarnopol and later studied it in Vienna. =In Mandate Palestine and Israel= His Zionist convictions made him emigrate to the Land of Israel, then Mandate Palestine, already in 1922. Here he started his career photographing sites and landscapes of the country. Between 1925-1927 Schweig worked as a photographer for the JNF. In 1927 he established a workshop in Hanevi'im (Prophets) Street in Jerusalem. The first color photographs taken by a local photographer in Palestine were done by Schweig. After specialising in archaeological photography, he became the chief photographer of the Department of Antiquities of the Mandatory administration, housed from 1938 onward by the Palestine Archaeological Museum, a.k.a. the Rockefeller Museum. Beginning in the 1920s, his photographs helped shape the world's perception of the Zionist enterprise. But Shmuel Joseph Schweig is equally renowned as Israel's first artistic photographer of landscape and archaeology. Schweig is considered one of the most important of those who fashioned the image of Palestine, beginning in the 1920s, and he is identified with the Zionist enterprise and the nation- building project of the Jewish people. However, he saw himself above all as an artistic photographer; indeed, he is considered the first local art photographer of landscape and archaeology. Some of the early photographs of the Great Isaiah scroll - one of the Dead Sea Scrolls - was taken by Schweig. Book publications He worked at several archaeological publications and was in charge of the illustration and layout of the Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land (editor Michael Avi-Yonah, Prentice-Hall, 1978). Schweig produced at the request of the office of the Secretary of State for the Colonies an album of Tegart forts known as \\"The Police Stations Plan 1940-1941\\", \\"The Wilson Brown Buildings\\" or \\"From Dan to Be'er Sheva\\".

Creation and publication history  The diary was created more than half a year after Tyrmand lost his job at the Tygodnik Powszechny magazine (lit. The Catholic Weekly) ‚Äì along with all of the other editors ‚Äì for his refusal to publish the official version of Joseph Stalin's obituary dictated by the Polish communist authorities, following Stalin's death in March 1953. Tyrmand and his co-workers then received an unofficial ban on working in the print media. He went on to earn his living from part-time and freelance jobs, including giving private lessons, occasional copy writing, and selling his stories for screenplays. His diary notes included in the book were taken almost daily between 1 January and 2 April 1954, and occupied 800 pages. The very last paragraph of the book breaks off in the middle of a sentence. Tyrmand explained this years later: \\"The last evening, tired with writing, as it often happened, I broke off the sentence intending to return to it the next day. But I never did. The next day Czytelnik [publishing house] offered me a contract to write [the novel] Z≈Çy. Initially I was going to continue the diary, but the days passed by, suddenly full of the different circumstances and requirements.\\"Supplement to the first edition. In 1956, Tygodnik Powszechny published a fragment of the diary. After his emigration in 1965, Tyrmand deposited the diary in the editorial office of the Paris-based polish magazine Kultura, returning to collect it four years later. Tyrmand resumed editing his notes in 1973. Fragments of his diary were first published in the London Polish-language periodical Wiadomo≈õci between 1974 and 1978. The first book edition appeared in London in 1980, published by the Polonia Book Fund. Introduction to the first edition included the following sentence: \\"Present book contains the entirety of the diary, unaffected by editorial considerations, moral quandaries, political necessities, social concessions.\\" Meanwhile, the cover displayed a photo of the manuscript, on which the text did not match the book's content. Notice has also been taken of English translation calques and style clumsiness.E.g. Henryk Dasko, Wstƒôp do \\"Dziennika 1954\\", s. 4 Many interlocutors of Mariusz Urbanek, author of a later book on Tyrmand, Z≈Çy Tyrmand, were convinced that nearly all of the diary was created in the United States after Tyrmand had settled there in 1966. On the other hand, Literatura Polska 1939-91 characterises this publication as an apocrypha.Ryszard Matuszewski, Literatura Polska 1939-91, WSiP, Warszawa 1992 It was only in 1999 that the original version of the diary, based on the notes made public by Tyrmand's wife and kept at Stanford University, was issued. The 1980 edition of Dziennik 1954 has been translated into English by Anita K. Shelton and A. J. Wrobel and published as Diary 1954 by Northwestern University Press (Chicago, 2014, ). It was a finalist for the 2015 AATSEEL Book Prize for Best Translation into English.  Contents  Tyrmand analyses the person of himself, his life and decisions taken, spending the bulk of the book analysing Poland in the Stalinism period, in which he lived by then.Stefan Kisielewski, Tyrmand's friend, who read his diary at the time of its writing, used a similar form in the 1970s in his diary. In the book, Tyrmand, although self-described as a firm anti-communist, does not get involved in neither political nor ideological arguments against communism. Polish writer J√≥zef Hen observed: \\"In the Diary, there is not a single word about the exiles, trials, Tito, Korea, spies, jail tortures\\".Henryk Dasko, op.cit. s. 14 Sometimes Tyrmand expresses himself almost positively, for example about Vladimir Lenin.Note dated 21 January: The figure of Lenin has always triggered my liking, as opposed to the figure of Stalin. There is about the former one a mist of some revolutionary-conspiratory romance, so close to our fine literature of the period of Brzozowskis, ≈ªeromskis, Strugs\\". The fragment was preserved only in the original version of the Diary. The criticism of the political system prevailing in Poland is concerned with its civilisational and aesthetical aspects. For instance in a few places Tyrmand complains about a dirt plague in Warsaw. Diary contains a lot of personal criticism of both Tyrmand's acquaintances (their identities often hidden behind initials) as well as public figures. The brunt of his criticism is directed at moral attitudes of Polish artists, whom he considered lackeys of the state. Tyrmand engages in a dispute on the writings of Ernest Hemingway with film critic Zygmunt Ka≈Çu≈ºy≈Ñski. He also describes in detail his discussions with his friend Stefan Kisielewski. Throughout the diary some 570 names appear, including those of the people which were only beginning to be widely known at the time, including Stanis≈Çaw Lem, Zbigniew Herbert, Jan Lenica, and Julia Hartwig. Descriptions of love and sex affairs of Tyrmand abound. In a relationship at that time with an 18-year-old girl (in the first edition named 'Bogna', in the original 'Krystyna'), the author also goes back to his earlier affairs. Many of the situations depicted in Diary were used by the author later in his novels Z≈Çy and ≈ªycie towarzyskie i uczuciowe. The editorial changes in the first edition of the book were made to adjust Tyrmand's image so that it fits better with the one he created in the United States in the 1970s. The writer set store by showing his views' constancy over the numerous years, \\"This diary, written at full manhood, re-read at the twilight of midlife, gives me a feeling of self-loyalty ‚Äì which always seemed to me as desirable and worthy of sacrifices.\\" Preface to first edition The 1970s corrections also consisted in elaboration and enrichment of some accounts, for instance the council in ZwiƒÖzek Literat√≥w Polskich. A biographer Henryk Dasko notes that Diary 1954 would play a substantial role in autocreation of the legend of Tyrmand as an independent and unwavering creator.

Serling. Written by Serling and Nicole Lonner, the film was executive produced by Dianne Burnett for Burnett Entertainment in association with Thanksgiving Films. As Serling's first feature-length project, Jam is based upon a short film by the same name that Serling shot in 2004. Starring Elizabeth Bogush, Dan Byrd, Julie Claire, and David DeLuise, Jam premiered at the Vail Film Festival on April 1, 2006, aired on television on the Starz! TV channel, and was released on DVD on July 3, 2007, by the Starz! distribution branch of Anchor Bay Entertainment. Background =Short film= The original concept was based upon an incident when Serling and his writing partner Nicole Lonner were stuck in a traffic in upstate New York. The script for Jam was completed in 2003, and after obtaining financing, Serling shot the concept as a short film in 2004, completing principal photography in 2-1/2 days, and making the short film's debut at The Other Venice Film Festival in 2005. =Feature film= The filmmaker found that shooting it as a short before shooting it as a feature allowed him to hone the script and concept to better create a marketable project. After obtaining financing for the feature-length version, Serling shot it over a 15-day period in 2006. The feature-length film made festival rounds before being licensed for release through Starz!, airing first on their TV channel and then being released on DVD through Anchor Bay Entertainment. Plot On Father's Day, Ted (William Forsythe) and Josh (Dan Byrd) are out for an afternoon drive in the country. When a dog darts across the road, Ted slams on the brakes and is struck from behind by Lorraine (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), a cellist on her way to a performance gig. The impact shoves Ted's vehicle into a power pole, which falls across the road and drops electrically charged lines, blocking traffic on the narrow two-lane rural highway. As they and other travelers are now stuck, strangers emerge from their cars and become unusual companions while awaiting the hazard to be cleared. Dale (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), is a divorc√© spending his Father's Day with his children, Robert (Skyler Gisondo) and Brianna (Marissa Blanchard). Amy (Amanda Detmer) is en route to her own wedding with her friends Stephanie (Amanda Foreman) and Jen (Elizabeth Bogush) along for support. Lilac (Gina Torres) is a lesbian hippie who moves among the other stranded motorists seeking help for her very pregnant partner Rose (Mariah O'Brien). She is hassled by Gary (Jonathan Silverman) and Judy (Julie Claire), a yuppie couple who have been bickering over the fact that they have been unable to conceive a child. In a stolen RV rednecks Curt (Christopher Amitrano) and Jerry (David DeLuise) have stolen an ATM and cannot figure out how to get the money from inside it. As they contemplate their problem, Lilac enlists their aid to deliver Rose's baby. Mick (Alex Rocco) and his wife Ruby (Tess Harper) are a middle-age couple out for an afternoon drive, and Mick ends up as a fatherly advisor on \\"affairs of the heart\\" to a few of the others stranded.

These festivals included the Vail Film Festival, the Newport Beach International Film Festival, The Other Venice Film Festival, the Boston Film Festival, the Hollywood Film Festival, and the Santa Fe Film Festival. =DVD= After airing on the Starz! TV channel, the film was released on DVD on July 3, 2007, by Starz!/Anchor Bay Entertainment. DVD extras include commentary with writer/director Craig Serling, cinematographer Jeff Vinditti, and composer Andy Kubiszewski, with the three peppering each other with questions. There is also the \\"making of\\" vignette When Lives Collide showing behind-the-scenes of the production and interviews with the writers, as well as two short \\"deleted scenes\\" clips, the film's original trailer, and Starz/Anchor Bay previews. Also included is the film's screenplay in a downloadable PDF format. On March 4, 2008, the film had its television premiere on the Showtime network. Recognition =Awards and nominations= In 2006, the film won the Santa Fe Film Festival's 'Independent Spirit Award' for writers Craig E. Serling and Nicole Lonner. =Critical response= The AMC Filmcritic appreciated the director's efforts, in that the plot device of a group of people simply stopped in traffic and interacting for 90 minutes while awaiting the road to be cleared was \\"either genius or insane.\\" They expanded that the interwoven storylines contained \\"some good stories and some bad, some good actors and some poor ones.\\" And concluded that \\"The concept is cute but ultimately a little undercooked.\\" The E.Filmcritic reviewer felt that as the auto accident that resulted the topic's traffic jam is between black woman and a white father and son pair, his initial impression was that the film would be about interpersonal race conflict. He was pleased that with the film's action set on Father's Day, it becomes more about the parent-child relationships of the various persons stuck in the traffic jam. He appreciated the film's has \\"a theme that holds the film together without being painfully obvious about it\\", and noted whatever \\"shortcomings the film has likely come about due to the tight shooting schedule\\". DVD Talk was less forgiving, writing \\"Jam is a great big pile-up of a movie\\", and offered that being \\"more than just contrived or hokey, the film stuffs itself full of sitcom characters and the sort of situations that would get rejected from bottom rung TV dramas.\\" They felt that the material was \\"dopey\\" and \\"hackneyed\\", that the number of interwoven character studies did not offer any single story thread worth watching, and that none of the characters rang true in their behaviors, attitudes, or revelations. They offered that while most of the cast struggled, actors Gina Torres, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, and William Forsythe manage to maintain artistic integrity, even though all were hampered by trite dialogue, weak plotting, cheap symbolism, lazy exposition, and laughable story turns. The conclusion was that the film \\"plays like a clumsily written and poorly performed stage play, the kind that really wants to say important things about the human condition but can't get beyond its own lousiness.\\" DVD Verdict was also less forgiving, offering that it was the \\"Seinfeld of indie films\\" in that \\"It's a movie about nothing.\\" They note that no one is hurt in the collision that creates the storyline, the ATM and RV thieves are \\"innocuous to the point of being silly\\", that the film's one attempt at a sexual overtones and liaison goes nowhere, and the \\"big reveals\\" aren't just not big, they are pretty much set up and no surprise to the viewer. They also note that being set on Father's Day, there is \\"a vague thread of \\"father issues\\" throughout the piece\\", but that being vague, the threads are not properly developed. They also noted that though billed as a drama, the film was \\"more comedy than drama,\\" but that it did not have enough comedy to make it a funny film. In their critique, they wrote that the title of \\"Jam does the movie a disservice,\\" and that a more appropriate title might have been Stuck or Bored, for the film offered \\"none of the intensity that people feel in a real traffic jam‚Äîbelieve me, I live in Los Angeles, I know traffic jams.\\" The reviewer \\"never felt the drama, the tension or the confronting of fears\\" as was offered through descriptions on the back cover of the DVD box. They offered in the film's defense that as a character study, it succeeded \\"to a certain extent,\\" and that the actors proved better than the material with which they were dealing, all cast being recognizable television staples for years. In conclusion, the reviewer wrote \\"Watching Jam, is like watching a dozen real people do what real people do when they're stuck‚Äîwhich is nothing much. So if it was the filmmaker's desire to capture a very real moment in the lives of very normal people, he succeeded with flying colors.\\" References External links  * Film trailer at filmcritic.com Category:2006 films Category:2006 drama films Category:American drama films Category:English- language films Category:American independent films Category:American films Category:Features based on short films Category:2006 independent films ","title":"Jam (film)"},{"id":"33233601","title":"List of Ancestral Puebloan dwellings in Arizona"},{"id":"33233609","text":"Al Hajar is a village in Yemen, also known as Al Hajara\`.fallingraingetamapsatelliteviews It is located in the Ash Sharyah District of the Al Bayda' Governorate.

The first candy bars in the United States were produced here. Startup Candy Factory = Company = The Startup Candy company was founded by William Startup. He built the factory at 534 South 100 West in 1900 to help expand the family business. One of the first candy companies in Utah, the Startup Candy Company thrived in Utah's dry climate. The company produced the first candy bars in the U.S., as well as being the first to produce and sell ice cream. This facility helped Utah produce more candy than the rest of the Intermountain States combined. The Startup Candy Company was the first company in Utah state to introduce profit sharing to its employees. The Startup Candy Factory was added to the Provo City Historic Landmarks registry on March 21, 1996. =Structure= A mix between a warehouse style, and a light commercial style, the Startup Candy Factory has two stories and a basement. The southern portion of the structure is fairly plain with no decorative elements adorning the outside, it displays an asymmetrical facade. The middle section is more decorative, with a Roman arched door bay and a stone belt course, as well as recessed brick panels encasing window and door bays. The northern section has a corbled brick course along the second level. =William Daw Startup family= Born to William Startup and Selina Morris in Widcombe, England, on September 8, 1846, William helped his father make candy as a child, beneath their retail store in the basement. After William converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he alone out of his family immigrated to the United States. On November 14, 1869 William wed Hagar in Salt Lake City's Endowment House. Once married, William and Hagar settled in Salt Lake, hoping that William would be able to make a living as a teacher. In the year 1874, they moved to Provo, and in 1875, they began making candy in a factory they constructed next to their home. William was hit by a limestone cooling slab, which caused his untimely death in the year 1878. Hagar, his wife, had four children by that time, and endeavored to carry on the candy making business in their support. By 1892, the store was a success, and became the third wholesale manufacturing company in the state of Utah. Three years later, Hagar's sons Walter, George, and William became the owners. In 1896, the first candy bar in the United States, the opera bar, was sold for ten cents from this factory. When the depression hit and economic difficulties ensued, Walter Startup purchased his brothers‚Äô interests, but soon lost them to the bank. Eventually, additional funds were procured, and Walter was able to buy back the northern half of the factory, where the company continued to operate.

It is an artificial oligonucleotide named for being a mirror image of natural oligonucleotides. L-RNA aptamers are a form of aptamers. Due to their L-nucleotides, they are highly resistant to degradation by nucleases. L-RNA aptamers are considered potential drugs and are currently being tested in clinical trials.  Features  =Chemical properties= thumb L-RNA aptamers, built using L-ribose, are the enantiomers of natural oligonucleotides, which are made with D-ribose. Nucleic acid aptamers, including L-RNA aptamers, contain adenosine monophosphate, guanosine monophosphate, cytidine monophosphate, uridine monophosphate, a phosphate group, a nucleobase and a ribose sugar. =Biological characteristics= Like other aptamers, L-RNA aptamers are able to bind molecules such as peptides, proteins, and substances of low molecular weight. The affinity of L-RNA aptamers to their target molecules often lies in the pico to nanomolar range and is thus comparable to antibodies. L-RNA aptamers themselves have low antigenicity. In contrast to other aptamers, L-RNA aptamers have high stability in blood serum, since they are less susceptible to be cleaved hydrolytically by enzymes. They are excreted by the kidneys in a short time due to their low molar mass (which is below the renal threshold). L-RNA aptamers modified with a higher molar mass, such as PEGylated L-RNA aptamers, show a prolonged plasma half-life. Production Unlike other aptamers, L-RNA aptamers are not directly made using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), as L-nucleic acids are not amenable to enzymatic methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), used in SELEX. Therefore, the selection is done with mirrored target molecules. =Reflection of the target molecule= The first step is the production of the target's enantiomer. In the case of peptides and small proteins that are produced synthetically, an enantiomer is made using synthetic D-amino acids. If the target is a larger protein molecule, beyond synthetic abilities, the enantiomer of an epitope is produced. =SELEX= Conventional (up to 1016 different oligonucleotides) existing molecule library serves as a starting point for the subsequent SELEX process. Selection, separation, and amplification using the mirror image of the target molecule is performed. =Sequencing and synthesis= The sequence of the oligonucleotide selected using SELEX is determined with the help of DNA sequencing. This information is used for the synthesis of the oligonucleotide's enantiomer, the L-RNA aptamer, using L-nucleotides. Use L-RNA aptamers have been obtained for the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL12, the complement components C5a and ghrelin. They are currently in preclinical or clinical development. Proof-of-concept for an anti-CCL2/MCP-1 L-RNA aptamers has recently been demonstrated in diabetic nephropathy patients. They can also be used as diagnostic agents.

During his early career he served in the California State Legislature and as a member of the Nevada constitutional convention. His later life was spent building the town of San Antonio, Florida. Background Dunne was born on July 30, 1835 in Little Falls, New York, the eldest of five children to John and Eleanor O'Dunne. Of Irish ancestry, he was a \\"rectilineal descendant of Tiege Reagh O'Dunne\\" on his father's side and descended from Cormac, second son of Tiego IV of Iregan on his mother's. A year after his birth, Dunne's family moved to Ohio. There his father, a prosperous businessman, helped Irish immigrants to settle. Details of Dunne's education are unknown but the judge's broad background in history and theology combined with fluency in multiple languages indicates extensive schooling. In 1852, Dunne and his father went to prospect for gold in California. After several years the pair brought the rest of the family west to live with them on a farm. About this time Dunne obtained his legal education in San Francisco. In 1852 he worked to establish a Catholic colony in Mexico.

He was elected in 1862 to represent Sonoma County, California in the California State Legislature. Upon completing his term in 1863, Dunne moved to Humboldt County, Nevada Territory. A year after his arrival, Dunne was a member of the Nevada constitutional convention. Following statehood he was elected a district court judge for Nevada's Sixth Judicial District in 1865 and 1866. Following his service on the state bench, Dunne established a legal practice in Washington D.C. that specialized in helping American citizens with legal claims against the Republic of Mexico. During this time period, Dunne made a number of trips to Europe. He married Josephine Cecelia Warner of Vicksburg, Mississippi on October 30, 1872 at the √âglise Saint-Philippe-du-Roule in Paris. A later trip, in 1874, resulted in Dunne meeting with historians who determined he was \\"the legitimate legal heir of Iregan and chief of his tribe\\". The marriage produced five children, including respected Maryland judge, Eugene O'Dunne, and longtime Santa Fe society gossip columnist and author, Brian Boru Dunne (1878-1962). Josephine died of pneumonia in Dunne's Catholic Florida colony on January 1, 1883 at the age of 38.Horgan, James J. (1990). Pioneer College: The Centennial History of Saint Leo College, Saint Leo Abbey, and Holy Name Priory. Saint Leo, FL. Saint Leo College Press. p. 19. And so the couple's five children were brought by the colorful \\"Stagecoach Mary\\" Fields (with whom the Warners had a previous connection) to Judge Dunne's sister, Mother Mary Amadeus Dunne (1846-1919). His youngest child, Mary Eithne Dunne, died in 1886 at age 5. Mother Amadeus was herself the mother superior of an Ursuline convent in Toledo, Ohio and would later become a prominent missionary to the Native-American peoples of both Montana and Alaska. Dunne's two surviving daughters, Maria del Carmen (d. 1950) and Hilda (1876-1972), followed their aunt into the Ursuline Order in 1892 and 1893, later becoming Mother Annunciata and Mother Amata, respectively. The two also worked in the missions and schools of Montana, Idaho and Washington. Another relative of note, Dom Frederic Dunne (the first American Trappist abbot), was the eldest son of Judge Dunne's cousin and San Antonio, Florida co-founder Capt. Hugh Dunne.Dunne, Sr. Margaret O.S.B. (1984). Saint Anthony School Memories of the First Hundred Years. Saint Leo, FL. Holy Name Priory. p. 4Raymond, M (2011). The Less Traveled Road: A Memoir of Dom Mary Frederic Dunne, First American Trappist Abbot. Whitefish, MT. Literary Licensing, LLC. Arizona Territory U.S. Senator William Morris Stewart, upon the advice of Arizona Territorial Governor Anson P. K. Safford, recommended Dunne to replace John Titus as Chief Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court. Safford likely knew Dunne from the time both had lived in Humboldt County. President Ulysses S. Grant made the nomination on March 6, 1874 with Senate confirmation coming on March 20. The new Chief Justice arrived with his family in late June and settled in Tucson. During his spare time he traveled throughout the territory with Governor Safford and was credited with planting Arizona's first \\"orange orchard\\" in late 1874. In his role as a justice, Dunne was well regarded with his opinions considered clear, well-reasoned, and rigorous. Examples of his rulings include Grounds v. Ralph, 1 Arizona 227 (1875) which rejected an appeal by a justice of the peace on the grounds the appeal did not specify the nature of the supposed legal error and was for an amount less than required by statute, Ford v. Haynes, 1 Arizona 229 (1875) which determined a debtor could show preferential treatment to a creditor prior to filing for bankruptcy, and Thorne v. Bowers, 1 Arizona 240 (1875) which determined an intermediary who obtained a larger sum for a mining claim from a purchaser than agreed upon by the seller could keep the difference between the two prices. The removal of Dunne came about for reasons other than his legal expertise. An ardent Catholic, the Chief Justice believed the church should handle all education in the Territory. He publicly expressed this belief in February 1875 in a speech before the 8th Arizona Territorial Legislature. He continued his efforts in newspaper columns over the next few months, some of which received attention on the Eastern Seaboard. The appeals went as far as calling for Catholics to stop paying taxes which supported public schools. With the resulting commotion, President Grant decided to remove Dunne in December 1875. The Chief Justice remained on the bench until the end of his January 3-26, 1876 court session. San Antonio, Florida St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church, est. 1883 in San Antonio, FLAfter his removal from the bench, Dunne initially remained in Tucson where he opened a private legal practice. The next year he was living in Santa Fe, New Mexico and in 1878 moved to Utah where he served as legal council for a mining company. Dunne was granted a Papal knighthood in 1876 and promoted to the rank of Commander three years later. He was finally created a Count by Pope Leo XIII in 1884. Dunne gave the commencement address at Notre Dame in 1880 and was living in Chicago when he became involved with Hamilton Disston's 1881 efforts to purchase roughly sixteen percent of peninsular Florida. As his commission, in 1882 Dunne received of land west of Dade City, Florida near the shore of Lake Jovita ‚Äìwhich he'd named to honor St. Jovita. The former judge used this land to found the Catholic colony of San Antonio, Florida. He worked to build the town until his departure in 1889. Before leaving the area, Dunne conveyed his residence and the surround property along the southern shore of Lake Jovita to the Benedictine monks in order that Saint Leo College and St. Leo Abbey be created out of it. San Antonio prospered until the Great Freeze of 1894‚Äì95 destroyed the local citrus groves. In 1976 the town's bicentennial commission placed a marker in the northwest corner of the plaza recognizing Dunne's contributions in establishing the community. In 2010 the Diocese of St. Petersburg added a Catholic Heritage Marker to the north facade of Saint Anthony of Padua Catholic Church in San Antonio, recognizing both Dunne's and the parish's part in the 19th Century church history of Florida's West Coast. Today, over 135 years since Dunne first established it, the city numbers about 1,300 residents. After San Antonio and death After leaving the area Dunne practiced law with his son Eugene in Jacksonville, FL at the firm of Dunne and O'Dunne. In his later years Dunne was a prominent Catholic lay writer and orator. His final two years were spent fighting an illness from which he died at St. Agnes Sanitarium in Baltimore, Maryland on October 4, 1904. Obituaries indicate that he also suffered from paralysis during his stay at St. Agnes. He was buried in Baltimore's New Cathedral Cemetery.

Most commonly, fu were made of wood or bamboo in sizes of wooden slips or bamboo chopsticks. Although fu have been made in various shapes (such as tiger, dragon, turtle, snake, fish or human), most of them come in the shape of a tiger. Classical description of tallies is found in the Zhou li, which refers to the tallies of jade and horn, and mentions the shapes of tiger, human, dragon, seal, and banner.Lothar von Falkenhausen, \\"The E Jun Qi Metal Tallies\\" in Text and Ritual in Early China, 2005:83 Fu (surname Á¨¶) was derived from the post of title of an official in charge of the tally. Hu-fu The two-piece tiger tallies (hu-fu, in Chinese) were used by a king or emperor to command and dispatch the army. The right piece was retained in the central government while the left piece was issued to the local officials or commanders. If someone wanted to dispatch the troops from a certain area, he had to show the right piece of the tiger tally in order to obtain authorization; both pieces of the tally had to match each other. The word hu- fu first appears in the biography of Hsin-ling in the Records of the Grand Historian, which tells the story of the stealing of a tiger tally to relieve the state of Zhao. During the Warring States period this kind of fu was changed from jade to bronze. The tiger tally from the tomb of King Zhao Mo Ë∂ôÁúú (Nanyue, Western Han), was cast as a single piece. It demonstrates that hu-fu were not uniform and might function not as tallies, but rather as tokens.Lothar von Falkenhausen, \\"The E Jun Qi Metal Tallies\\" in Text and Ritual in Early China, 2005:87 The image penetrated popular culture: in The Legend of Qin (animated TV series) animated series tiger tallies are figuratively called \\"the spirit of Chu troops\\" (Season 4, episode 16).

British Fascism claims that both its economic and its political agenda intend to embody that of Tudor England (1485-1603). It claims that its advocacy of a centralized national authoritarian state is based upon the Tudor state's hostility to party factions and to self-interested sectional interests, and upon the Tudor goal of national integration through a centralised authoritarian state. Supporters see the Tudor state as a prototype fascist state. In 1935 A. L. Glasfurd, a member of the British Union of Fascists (BUF), praised Henry VII's subjugation of \\"lawless barons who had brought about the War of the Roses\\"; he also praised the \\"Tudor dictatorship\\" for introducing national policies and restrictions on the export of English capital by self-serving private speculators. Glasfurd also praised the Tudor state for instituting a planned economy that he claimed was a predecessor of the \\"scientific\\" national economic planning of fascism.

BUF Leader Sir Oswald Mosley emphasised the \\"Irish Connection\\" and the BUF held both Protestant and Catholic religious branches.Ken Lunn, Richard C. Thurlow, Kenneth Lunn. British Fascism: Essays on the Radical Right in Inter-War Britain. Pp. 162. Mosley condemned the Liberal government of David Lloyd George for being responsible for allowing reprisals between Catholics and Protestants in Ireland.Ken Lunn, Richard C. Thurlow, Kenneth Lunn. British Fascism: Essays on the Radical Right in Inter-War Britain. Pp. 162. As a result of the BUF's conciliatory approach to Catholics, it gained a substantial support amongst Catholics, and several BUF leaders in Hull, Blackburn, and Bolton, were Catholics.Ken Lunn, Richard C. Thurlow, Kenneth Lunn. British Fascism: Essays on the Radical Right in Inter-War Britain. Pp. 161. Support by Catholic Irish in Stepney for the BUF increased after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War that involved clerical traditionalist and fascist forces fighting against an anti-clerical government.Thomas Linehan. British Fascism, 1918-39: Parties, Ideology and Culture. Pp. 166. On racial issues, the various British Fascist movements held different policies. The British Fascism of Mosley's BUF believed that culture created national and racial differences - a policy closer to the views on race by Italian Fascism rather than German Nazism.Julie V. Gottlieb, Thomas P. Linehan. The culture of fascism: visions of the Far Right in Britain. New York, New York, USA: I. B. Taurus & Co. Ltd., 2004. Pp. 66-67. Initially the BUF was not explicitly anti- Semitic and was in fact based upon the views on race of Austrian Jewish sociologist Ludwig Gumplowicz and Scottish anthropologist Arthur Keith who defined race formation as the result of dynamic historical and political processes established within the confines of the nation state and that the defining characteristics of a people were determined by the interaction of heredity, environment, culture, and evolution over a historical period of time. However Mosley later prominently asserted anti-Semitism invoking the theory of German philosopher Oswald Spengler who described that Magian Jews and Faustian Europeans were bound to live in friction with each other.Richard Thurlow. Fascism in Britain: A History, 1918-1945. Revised paperback edition. I. B. Taurus & Co. Ltd., 2006. Pp. 28. The British Fascism of Arnold Leese's Imperial Fascist League promoted pro-Nazi racial policy including anti- Semitism.Julie V. Gottlieb, Thomas P. Linehan. The culture of fascism: visions of the Far Right in Britain. New York, New York, USA: I. B. Taurus & Co. Ltd., 2004. Pp. 67. There were small, short-lived Fascist groups at several universities including Oxford, Cambridge, Birmingham, Liverpool and Reading. Mosley arranged a series of public meetings of his British Union of Fascists (formed in 1932) in university towns, which often ended in conflict between supporters and opposition, followed by violence. =Foreign policies= British Fascism was non-interventionist and argued against war when it was not in defence of Britain or the British Empire. It was believed the only threat to the British Empire was from the Soviet Union.Oswald Mosley. Fascism: 100 Questions Asked and Answered. Question 88 In defence of this policy Mosley pointed to Benjamin Disraeli who opposed going to war with Turkey over its mistreatment of Armenians. Corporatist policies would also be spread to the empire.Oswald Mosley. Fascism: 100 Questions Asked and Answered. Question 83 It was seen as natural that the Dominions would accept these policies as it would be beneficial to them.Oswald Mosley. Fascism: 100 Questions Asked and Answered. Question 80 The spread of corporatist policies would have also led to an increased hold on India and with that have working conditions improved.Oswald Mosley. Fascism: 100 Questions Asked and Answered. Question 84 =Corporatism= Despite being a fascist movement, British Fascism claimed to be democratic. The BUF declared support for a democratic state with Mosley describing it in relation to the BUF's support of corporatism as \\"a nation emerges organised in the divine parallel of the human body as the name implies. Every organ plays a part in relation to the whole and in harmony with the whole\\".Roger Griffin. Fascism, Totalitarianism And Political Religion. Oxon, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2005. P. 110. =Syndicalist economy= In economics, British Fascism opposes laissez-faire economics for being an outmoded system and promotes it to be replaced by a national syndicalist economic system. The BUF denounced capitalism, with Mosley declaring: \\"Capitalism is a system by which capital uses the nation for its own purposes. Fascism is a system by which the nation uses capital for its own purposes\\".Moyra Grant. Key Ideas in Politics. P. 63. He went on to say \\"private enterprise is not permitted when it conflicts with national interests\\".Oswald Mosley. Fascism: 100 Questions Asked and Answered. Question 35 =Traditionalism and modernism= The BUF declared support for the British monarchy, regarding the monarchy for its role in bringing Britain to preeminence in the world, and as such a symbol of Britain's imperial splendour.David Stephen Lewis. Illusions of Grandeur: Mosley, Fascism, and British Society, 1931-81. P. 51. Its support went as far as \\"Absolute loyalty to the Crown\\" and aimed to \\"in every way maintain its dignity\\".Oswald Mosley. Fascism: 100 Questions Asked and Answered. Question 1 The BUF declared its support for complete religious toleration though also declared that it sought to merge both religious and secular spheres of the nation into a \\"higher harmony\\" between church and state, by supporting political representation for leading clerics in the House of Lords and state maintenance for religious schools for those who demanded them. The BUF declared its support for Christianity and its opposition to atheism, saying \\"atheism will perish under British Union; Christianity will find encouragement and security, in which it may prosper to the glory of its Creator\\". The BUF stressed the need for Britain to be linked to modernity, especially in economics. Mosley had declared such in 1931 in addressing the action needed in response to the onset of the Great Depression: \\"we have to face modern problems with modern minds, we should then be able to lift this great economic problem and national emergency far above the turmoil of party clamour and with national unity could achieve a solution adequate to the problem and worthy of the modern mind\\". They found \\"the money spent on both scientific and technical research [was] absurdly inadequate\\".Oswald Mosley. Fascism: 100 Questions Asked and Answered. Question 33 British Pan-European Nationalism After the defeat of the Axis powers in 1945, Sir Oswald Mosley founded the Union Movement (UM) as the successor to his post-war BUF. The Union Movement diverged from the BUF's focus on British nationalism and instead focused on promoting the idea of Pan- European nationalism.http://www.oswaldmosley.net/europe-a-nation-1948.php References Category:British nationalism Category:National syndicalism ","title":"British Fascism"},{"id":"33233977","text":"Brian Eisner (born ) is an American tennis player and coach. He played collegiate tennis at Michigan State University from 1960 to 1962. From 1963 to 1969, he was the head tennis coach at the University of Toledo. During his 30 years as the head coach of the men's tennis team at the University of Michigan, he led the team to 18 Big Ten Conference Championships, including 16 in a row. He is the winningest tennis coach in University of Michigan history and has been inducted into the Athletic Halls of Fame at Michigan, Toledo, and the Intercollegiate Tennis Association. Early years A native of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, Eisner played collegiate tennis for Michigan State University. He was the runner-up for the Big Ten Conference singles championship in 1960 and was selected as the captain of the Michigan State Spartans tennis team in 1961 and 1962. University of Toledo In September 1963, Eisner was named the head coach of the men's tennis team at the University of Toledo. He served in that position until 1969, leading Toledo to four consecutive Mid-American Conference championships from 1966 to 1969 and compiling a record of 76-30-1. Eisner's younger brother, Dean Eisner, was the No. 1 singles player for the Toledo Rockets in 1966. University of Michigan In September 1969, Eisner was hired as the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines men's tennis team. Upon arriving in Ann Arbor, Eisner began lobbying to enhance the university's tennis facilities and recruiting the nation's top tennis players and had success with players like Peter Fleming, Victor Amaya, and Freddy de Jesus. Eisner served as Michigan's head tennis coach from 1969 to 1999, compiling a record of 449-201 in dual meets and leading the Wolverines to 18 Big Ten Conference tennis championships, including 16 consecutive conference championships from 1970 to 1982. In 1985, columnist Phil Nussel wrote in The Michigan Daily: > \\"There is no doubt in my mind that the top active coach at Michigan today is > men's tennis coach Brian Eisner. That's a tough proclamation to make with > the likes of Bo Schembechler, Bud Middaugh and Bill Frieder on hand. But > then again, none of these coaches can claim to have won 14 straight Big Ten > titles. Eisner took his Wolverine squads to the Big Ten championship from > 1970-1983. After that, he took these teams to the NCAA tournament -- all 14 > years.\\" Eisner's Michigan teams finished in the top ten nationally six times. He also coached Mike Leach to the NCAA singles championship in 1982. In 1976, Sports Illustrated published a feature story about Eisner's success in building the Michigan tennis program into a national powerhouse despite playing in the frigid upper Midwest. The reporter compared Eisner's success at Michigan to an ice hockey team from Brazil taking on the Russians. Eisner modestly told the Sports Illustrated reporter, \\"I have everything going against me: weather, facilities, money. How can I possibly compete with USC, Stanford and UCLA?\\" Eisner then answered, \\"Coaching.\\" The article continued: > \\"Eisner's confidence and powers of persuasion are commanding. His aim, when > talking to parents, is to turn every promise of fun in the sun made by his > Sunbelt rivals into a threat. He is high on the strong academic tradition at > Michigan and actually sings The Victors when high school seniors visit the > campus on football Saturdays. . . . This puffery notwithstanding, Eisner's > strongest selling point is his record. In the last three years, Michigan has > finished fourth, third and seventh in the NCAA championships. No other team > outside the sunshine states has finished as high as third in 10 years.\\" Eisner was also credited with being a key figure in the development of the Michigan Varsity Tennis Center. Eisner achieved his 500th career win as a coach in NCAA dual matches in 1998. Later years and honors After retiring as Michigan's tennis coach, Eisner became an owner of the Liberty Athletic Club in Ann Arbor. Several of his former athletes work as tennis professionals at the club including former Big Ten Player of the Year Peter Pusztai and NCAA singles finalist Dan Goldberg. In 2000, he was inducted into the ITA Collegiate Hall of Fame. and in January 2011, Eisner was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor.

His nickname within his alliance was \\"The Animal.\\" He describes himself as \\"outgoing, athletic and charming.\\" His favorite activities include \\"snowboarding, weightlifting, working out, going to the beach and hanging out with friends.\\" Hayden won Big Brother 12 by a jury vote of 4-3, awarding him the $500,000 prize. Survivor In 2013, Moss was a contestant on Survivor: Blood vs. Water, the 27th season of Survivor, along with his girlfriend Kat Edorsson, who had previously competed on the show's 24th season, Survivor: One World. He was the first Big Brother player to compete on Survivor, followed by Big Brother 16 contestant Caleb Reynolds, who was a contestant on Survivor: Kaoh Rong, the 32nd season of Survivor. Caleb later returned for Survivor: Game Changers. Moss was initially placed on the Tadhana tribe along with the game's other new players. Edorsson was voted out while the two were on separate tribes; yet when presented with the option to allow her to take his place in the game, he stayed put on his tribe and she was eliminated after placing last in a challenge. After a tribe swap, Moss remained on the Tadhana tribe, along with fellow newcomers Caleb Bankston and Ciera Eastin, while being joined by returning players Tyson Apostol, Gervase Peterson, and Aras Baskauskas. Together, under Apostol's leadership, everyone on the tribe, except for Baskauskas, formed an alliance, under the common bond of having their loved ones voted out already. At the merge, the core alliance of five stayed together and successfully eliminated Baskauskas and his brother Vytas, as well as Tina Wesson, and Eastin's mother Laura Morett (for the second time). However, at the urging of Bankston, Moss decided that it was best to attempt to overthrow Apostol as a clear threat. Their first attempt failed, since they were unable to convince Eastin to flip against Apostol, and when the two of them, along with Wesson's daughter Katie Collins, attempted to vote out Eastin, Bankston was eliminated instead. With Bankston gone, Moss took control of the outsiders' alliance and finally convinced Eastin to vote with him and Collins against Monica Culpepper. However, this resulted in a stalemate of two consecutive tied votes, which led to Collins' elimination after a rock draw. With no one else left to turn to, Moss and Eastin tried to convince Culpepper to join them in eliminating Peterson as a final effort against Apostol, but she refused. Moss was voted out at the Final Five, and after losing the Redemption Island duel, came in seventh place as the fifth jury member. Eastin was eliminated next, completely ending Moss's alliance. In the Final Tribal Council, Moss voted Apostol as the winner.

Born in Chicago, Reiffel was an electrical engineering student for a number of years before entering into research fields. He collaborated with Enrico Fermi, Carl Sagan, and members of Operation Paperclip. Reiffel also worked for NASA and the Illinois Institute of Technology, and won a Peabody Award for his work on the radio program The World Tomorrow. His experience with broadcasting led him to invent the telestrator as a visual aid for his programming; Reiffel held over fifty different patents for his inventions. Early life Leonard Reiffel was born in Chicago on September 30, 1927. His father was Carl Reiffel, a silversmith credited with inventing a slide saxophone. His mother, the former Sophie Miller, was a district superintendent in the Chicago public school system. The younger Reiffel attended Theodore Roosevelt High School, before earning a bachelor's and master's degree as well as a doctorate in electrical engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology between 1947 and 1953. Career = Universities and inventions= Reiffel began his career at the University of Chicago's Institute for Nuclear Studies, helping Enrico Fermi construct a 450-inch cyclotron. From there, Reiffel returned to the university at which he had studied, the Illinois Institute of Technology. Here, Reiffel was Group Vice President of the IIT Research Institute (formerly known as the Armour Research Foundation). During his tenure at the university, Reiffel created and patented over fifty different inventions, which earned him four separate R&D; 100 Awards. Reiffel also collaborated with German scientists recruited in America as part of Operation Paperclip, working on an early prototype for a railgun. =NASA= Reiffel was involved in several positions in NASA's Apollo program, moving from being a consultant on the possibility of life on the Moon to become deputy director of the project, a post he held from 1965‚Äì1969. During this time, Reiffel was also put in charge of Project A119, a United States Air Force project intending to detonate a nuclear warhead on the Moon. Reiffel worked alongside Carl Sagan and Gerard Kuiper on the project. Reiffel also chaired the Interagency Manned Space Flight Experiments Board for several years, a body which worked alongside NASA, the United States Air Force, and the United States Department of Defense. =Broadcasting= Reiffel's work on radio and television has included Backyard Safari, Dimensions on Tomorrow's Living and The World Tomorrow. Backyard Safari was nominated for an Emmy Award, whilst Reiffel was honored with a Peabody Award in 1968 for his work on The World Tomorrow. Reiffel's time as a broadcaster led to him developing the telestrator, a device for drawing over still or moving video images; the device is now commonly employed by American football broadcasters while discussing plays. Reiffel first used the telestrator as part of Backyard Safari before convincing WBBM-TV weatherman John Coughlin to use it as part of his forecasts; it was from there that sports anchor Johnny Morris introduced its use to sports broadcasting. =Other work= Reiffel also worked as an artwork authenticator for the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, investigating the authenticity of work by √âdouard Manet in 2002. In 1979, he published the science fiction novel The Contaminant. He also acted as a consultant to the governments of Belarus and Ukraine following the Chernobyl incident; this experience led him to write an unpublished second novel about nuclear terrorism. Death Reiffel died of complications from pancreatic cancer in Chicago on April 15, 2017. He was survived by his second wife Nancy Reiffel, and sons Evan and David.

It was published in 2009 by Little Brown and Company. The plot centers on two estranged elderly brothers who reunite after many years to break the elder brother, Don Fidencio, out of his nursing home in Brownsville, Texas and head to Mexico on a quest to solve the mystery of how their family came to America. Amigoland received a \\"starred review\\" from Publishers Weekly and was later selected by the 2010 Mayor's Book Club in Austin, Texas for that year's citywide reading campaign.  Important characters = Don Fidencio = Don Fidencio is a 91-year-old widower, a resident of Amigoland, a Brownsville nursing home, where he's been sent by his daughter and son-in-law. His body is failing him, and he's stuffed with pills ‚Äì \\"pills for his heart ... his blood pressure ... his cholesterol ... his kidneys ... his heartburn ... the pain in his legs ... to make him [expletive] ... to make him sleep.\\" He turns the name of the place into an irony: He feels so isolated, he cannot bother to even learn the names of those around him, opting instead for shorthand ‚Äì \\"The Gringo With the Ugly Finger,\\" \\"The One Who Likes to Kiss Your Forehead.\\" He takes pleasure only from his cigarettes. = Don Celestino = Fidencio‚Äôs somewhat younger brother Celestino, also a widower, is now suffering from diabetes.

The bill was voted into law in September 1984 under Title 51 (Trade and Commerce) of the Louisiana Revised Statutes by the Louisiana State Legislature. Sponsored and mostly written by Vault Corporation, the SLEA defines the permissible terms and conditions of a software license agreement and the requirements for enforceability. The reverse engineering, decompiling or disassembling provision of the Louisiana SLEA was invalidated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruling in Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software, Ltd., 847 F.2d 255 (5th Cir. 1988). Summary of act The Louisiana SLEA consists of sections 1961-1966 of Title 51 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes, which outlines and specifies: relevant definitions, requirements for enforceability, accepted licensing terms, proper display of licensing terms, and enforceability. Under section 1963, a software license agreement can only be enforced if the following conditions are met:Software Enforcement Act - Louisiana Revised Statutes 51:1963. *The end user can clearly read a software license notice on the software packaging. *The software license notice indicates that by opening the package or using the software the end user accepts the terms of the enclosed license agreement. *The notice states that the software may be returned if the end user does not accept the license agreement. Under section 1964, the terms of a software license agreement can enable the licensor to retain ownership of a licensed software copy. If retained, the agreement may also include the following limitations of the end user's ability:Software Enforcement Act - Louisiana Revised Statutes 51:1964. *To reproduce/replicate the licensed software copy. *To modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, and/or develop derivative works of the licensed software copy. *To further transfer, assign, rent, sell, or otherwise dispose of a licensed software copy. In addition, the licensor may automatically terminate the software license agreement without notice if any provision of the agreement was breached by the licensee. Road to becoming law The Louisiana SLEA was first announced at Softcon in New Orleans by Louisiana Secretary of State James H. Brown during a press conference sponsored by Vault Corporation. Vault Corporation's, a company that developed software protection systems (anti-piracy tools), Chairman Krag Brotby was attributed to saying, \\"[Vault] helped write most of the bill...and that the announcement was timed to coincide with Softcon coming to New Orleans.\\" Brotby predicted that the law would provide a model for the other 49 states; Vault Corp. had invested $50,000 in an effort to push the bill. The SLEA was introduced to the Louisiana State Legislature by State Senator William Atkins and Representative Al Ater. Supporters of the bill hoped it would encourage the growth of the software industry in Louisiana. It passed with minimal opposition in September 1984. Louisiana was the first state to adopt the SLEA, and the only state to adopt the bill as written by Vault Corporation. The bill was criticized for being, \\"a special-interest legislation designed to improve the economic position of software manufacturers without doing anything of substance to challenge software piracy,\\" Jay BloomBecker. Role in Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd. The Louisiana SLEA was first examined in court when Vault Corporation sued Quaid Software Ltd. for copyright infringement, trade secret misappropriation, and patent infringement. Vault argued that Quaid's actions in decompiling and disassembling PROLOK constituted a violation of the software license agreement. Therefore, by Louisiana's Software License Enforce Act, Quaid would be in violation of the Louisiana Uniform Trade Secret Act for trade secret misappropriation. In Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd., 655 F.Supp. 750 (US District Court, E.D. Louisiana 1987), the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana ruled that the SLEA was preempted by the Copyright Act, because, \\"Louisiana's License Act 'touched upon the area' of federal copyright law.\\" Upon appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling. Thus, the Louisiana Revised Statutes 51:1963:4 provision for reverse engineering, decompiling, or disassembling, was invalidated.

It runs from Gothersgade to Store Kongensgade. As one of relatively few streets in central Copenhagen, the street, in its western part, is dominated by modern buildings. The eastern part passes through the Nyboder district. History =Foundation of the street= Borgergade originates in the 1649 plan for New Copenhagen, the large area which was included in the fortified city when the old East Rampart along present day Gothersgade was decommissioned and a new one was built in a more northerly direction. According to the plan, the streets in the area were to be named after Danish territorial possessions, royalty and the upper classes. The new district was spaciously planned with long straight streets. The most affluent families settled along Bredgade and Ny Kongensgade while the area around Borgergade and Adelgade catered to a more modest clientele, typically craftsmen and shop-keepers. The buildings were generally half-timbered and relatively small, and living conditions were still considerably better than in the crowded city centre. =Escaping disaster= Christian Gedde's 1757 map of St. Ann's West Quarter: Borgergade is the horizontal street in the bottom of the map The neighbourhood escaped both the Great Fires of 1728 and 1795, and was also left largely unharmed by the British bombardment of the city during the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807. One of the finest buildings in the street was the Mint Master's House. It had been built in 1683 by Royal Mint Master Gregorius Sessemann as his private residence and was inhabited by successive mint masters until 1752. In 1720 the house was fitted with a fine Baroque staircase. A separate apartment was created which was rented by the Russian Ambassador in 1728. In the 1760s the house was extended and adapted once again, reaching its finest state. In 1767, it was acquired by a master mason who lived there until 1803. =Crowding and poverty= Slum While Borgergade escaped the direct effects fires and war, they would still have a deep impact on the street. Many people who had been left homeless and ruined by the disasters moved there in search of affordable accommodation, making it increasingly crowded. Gardens and courtyards were built over and extra floors were added on top of existing buildings to make room for the many new residents. On 26 January 1865, the first public bath house opened in the street after a donation from Carl Joachim Hambro, a banker residing in London, but apart from that sanitation facilities were sparse. When the Fortifications were decommissioned in the middle of the century, many of the owners moved on to the new residential districts which had sprung up, such as N√∏rrebro and Vesterbro, and the area around Borgergade developed into one of the worst and most crowded slums in the city with a notorious reputation for poverty, vice and crime. =Condemnation= Demolition work with the Mint Master's House as a backdrop In the end, it was decided to condemn the area. Clearing began in the early 1940s but was put on hold in 1943 due to the war. After the Liberation, the work was resumed and the area was built up with modern buildings in the late 1940s and 50s. Two smaller streets, Prinsessegade and Helsing√∏rgade, ceased to exist. The Mint Master's House in Aarhus Instigated by Christian Axel Jensen, director of Museum of Copenhagen, the Mint Master's House was dismantled, registered and stored in a shed at Vestre Cemetery. The plan was to re-build it at a later date as part of an open-air museum dedicated to urban architecture which was to complement the rural buildings at Lyngby Open Air Museum but it never materialised. In 1995, The Old Town in Aarhus took over the materials and the house was finally reconstructed in 2009. Buildings As a result of the condemnations, the first, western, section of the street is lined with modern buildings. At Dronningens Tv√¶rgade, the street passes the south side of Dronningeg√•rden, a distinctive residential complex which forms a space round the intersection of Dronningens Tv√¶rgade and Adelgade. A peek of Borgergade between two of the Grey Rows along R√¶vegade The modern buildings finally give way to older buildings and the last section of the street from Fredericiagade passes through the Nyboder district, an area of naval barracks founded by King Christian IV. Both the more famous yellow houses and the younger so-called Grey (or New) Rows, designed by Olaf Schmidth and built between 1886 and 1893, are to be found along the street. The Historicist building at No. 111 was built as a girls' school and later served as a naval cadet academy. It is now known as Bygningskulturens Hus and serve as a centre for historical architecture and cultural heritage. Cultural references Borgergade at No. 26 is used as a location at 0:25:27 and again at 0:28:43 in the 1975 Olsen- banden film The Olsen Gang on the Track.

Larsen wandered in Europe, South America and across the United States before settling in Laguna at age 52. He worked as an occasional gardener, but adopted the daily habit of standing on a street corner to greet every car and passerby. From the 1940s until the early 1970s, the shaggy-haired, heavily bearded Larsen grinning, waving and booming \\"Halloo-oo-oo!\\" to visitors became a cultural icon for Laguna Beach tourists. Local patrons supported him with a rent-free room, free meals and other services. In 1964, Larsen was proclaimed Laguna's Official Greeter by the mayor. During his lifetime, Larsen was featured in paintings, postcards, photographs and sculptures. Early life Eiler Unmack Larsen was born March 27, 1890 in Aarhus, Denmark, the son of L.M. Larsen and Thyra Vilhelmine Unmack. His father worked as manager of the city's poorhouse. His younger brother, Svend Unmack Larsen, said growing up among the poor was \\"this mixture of tragedy and baroque, macabre comedy\\" that gave him an early understanding of social problems and the dark sides of society. Svend Unmack Larsen went on to become the Justice Minister of Denmark and served as mayor of Aarhus from 1945 to 1958. Eiler Larsen left Denmark to pursue what he later described as \\"my mission of friendliness.\\" Wanderlust Larsen alternated between a series of odd jobs and wanderlust. According to newspaper accounts, Larsen went to Siberia at age 19 as a representative for a Danish butter exporter. After a brief stint of mandatory service in the Danish Army, Larsen traveled to South America and hiked through Argentina and Chile. He first arrived in the United States at New Orleans, Louisiana aboard a ship from Chile on September 29, 1916.Manifest of Alien Passengers: SS Cartago, pages 15‚Äì16, archived at Ancestry.com. New Orleans Passenger Lists, 1820‚Äì1945 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2006. Larsen went to St. Peter, Minnesota where he attended Gustavus Adolphus College for a year. During World War I, Larsen enlisted on January 14, 1918 and served with the United States Army 8th Infantry. According to Larsen, a leg injury he suffered from an artillery shell in France resulted in his lifelong need of a cane. After returning to the United States, Larsen worked as a Wall Street messenger before wandering the eastern seaboard. He walked most of the Appalachian Trail from Maine to Georgia. For a time in the 1920s, he greeted people near the White House in Washington D. C.. In 1930, he worked as a caretaker in Putnam, New York. During the Great Depression, Larsen migrated to California where he picked fruit in the San Joaquin Valley and lived for a time in Colfax, California and the San Francisco area. The Greeter While living in San Francisco, Larsen was intrigued to hear about the Pageant of the Masters festival in the artist community of Laguna Beach. He came in the summer of 1938 and was cast as Judas in the presentation of Da Vinci's The Last Supper. He returned to portray the same role the next two years, then moved permanently to Laguna in 1942. He supported himself with occasional jobs of gardening and at a pottery business. In spare moments, Larsen pursued his lifelong habit of choosing a vantage point and welcoming people. His usual spot in Laguna Beach was a busy junction at Forest Avenue and Coast Highway near the main beach. To every car and pedestrian that passed by, Larsen grinned, waved, pointed his wooden cane and shouted his catch phrases of \\"Hallooo!\\", \\"Delighted to see you!\\" or \\"Are you alive?!\\" The shaggy-haired and heavily bearded Larsen, usually dressed in a red shirt, slacks and sandals, waving from the corner, became an iconic image for Laguna Beach tourists. Larsen was featured in newspapers and magazines. He appeared on postcards, photographs and paintings. News stories described him variously as a living legend, landmark and symbol of friendliness. Larsen lived in a rent-free room over a client's garage. Locals patrons helped him with contributions and some restaurants provided free meals. Some locals disapproved of Larsen, saying he was a public nuisance, an annoyance or \\"too loud\\". They wrote letters to the city to have him stopped. Larsen said, \\"They may think I'm crazy, but when a motorist comes to town, tired and weary of the traffic, and smiles when he leaves, does it matter what they think?\\" City council members dismissed the protests with bemusement because the majority of the town supported Larsen. In response to one well-publicized complaint in 1959, the Mayor said Larsen could be the unofficial town greeter so long as he did not interfere with traffic. On February 14, 1964, after more than twenty years of Larsen welcoming visitors, mayor William D. Martin proclaimed Larsen as Laguna's Official Greeter in a sidewalk ceremony that initiated the town's first Winter Festival. Larsen continued his wanderlust for brief periods. In 1953, he left for a cabin in Idyllwild to become a writer, but returned to Laguna by the following year. One winter, Larsen walked to Palm Springs where it was warmer and began greeting people on a street corner there. Residents quickly complained and Larsen was escorted out of town by police to walk back to the coast. Each Spring, Larsen hiked 30 miles over the mountains to attend the Easter sunrise service at Mount Rubidoux in Riverside. He often appeared at the Danish Days festival in Solvang, California and the Rose Parade. =Charity= Although he had little, Larsen's practice was to give away everything because he felt others \\"need it more than I do.\\" He carried a black satchel with candy, postcards and books to hand out. A voracious reader, Larsen spent his earnings on books ‚Äì often deep science and psychology ‚Äì then gave the books away to friends, children and the local library. Danes who knew Larsen compared his relationship with children to Hans Christian Andersen. According to one story, he handed out copies of Louis Untermeyer's poetry book For You With Love to each child on one Valentine's Day. Another year, he donated a collection of children's books to the Idyllwild Public Library. =Philosophy= Devoted to what he described as \\"my mission of friendliness\\", Larsen considered it his special duty. He said, \\"It's my spirit. It's a gift from God that few men have.\\" Larsen said that he developed his philosophical outlook after wandering in Siberia, South America and the United States. \\"When I was traveling around the country 40 years ago I made it a point to take up a vantage point and greet people.\\" He suggested that his single gesture of goodwill had a ripple effect, saying, \\"Too many people driving along the highway are frowning and look unhappy. By waving, I make them smile and thousands of people have a happier day before them.\\" Years later, he said, \\"I don't care who they are ‚Äì they all respond to goodwill. Some don't speak English, but they understand anyway.\\" Reflecting on the value of his efforts, Larsen said, \\"Some people have millions of dollars and no friends. I've got practically nothing and thousands of friends who drive by to greet me.\\" Later years Larsen often suffered from emphysema and was hospitalized by a stroke in February 1967. When he recovered, Laguna residents collected $3000 for Larsen to visit his hometown in Denmark for the first time in 53 years. He was celebrated in Denmark and met the mayors of Copenhagen and Aarhus, then returned to Laguna Beach after the six-week visit. For the next several years, Larsen lived in a free room at the Hotel Laguna and continued his Greeter duties. The Eiler Larsen Tribute Fund had been created to supplement his World War I Veteran's pension and pay for any needs. In 1971, suffering from the onset of bladder and colon cancer, Larsen was forced to retire. His friends moved him to the Beverly Manor convalescent home in Capistrano Beach, Dana Point, California. He died there on March 19, 1975. He is buried at Los Angeles National Cemetery. Legacy Statue of Eiler Larsen stands on the Pacific Coast Highway in Laguna Beach Two large statues of Larsen were erected in Laguna Beach. The first, titled Hello-o-o-o-o-o-o- How Ar-r-re You?, is a painted cement casting created by sculptor Charles Beauvais in the 1960s, that stands outside the Pottery Place along Pacific Coast Highway. The plaque is dedicated to the \\"...philosopher, gardener and friend of man who devoted all his spare time spreading goodwill and cheer...\\" The second, created in 1986, is a life-sized redwood carving by Guy Angelo Wilson that stands at a downtown corner outside Greeter's Corner restaurant, named in Larsen's honor. During a ceremony in February 1964, Larsen's footprints were impressed into the sidewalk at the intersection of Coast Highway and El Paseo Drive by Laguna's Main Beach . Around Christmastime in 1963, a 45-rpm record called \\"The Greeter\\" was released on OBO records. Composed by local artist Paul Blaine Henrie, the Bossa Nova song was sung by Rochelle Battat and featured Eiler Larsen shouting his catchphrases. In honor of Larsen's contributions to the library, the City of Laguna Beach designated the short drive beside the city library as Eiler Larsen Lane. =Greeter tradition= Although Larsen was the most famous town greeter in Laguna Beach, the unofficial role dates back to Old Joe Lucas in the 1880s. Lucas was an elderly Portuguese fisherman who had shipwrecked off the Laguna coast. The long-haired white-bearded Lucas, who spoke little English except for swear words and carried a trident, took up the habit of welcoming the thrice-weekly arrivals and departures of the stage coach from El Toro, California. The community supported Lucas with a monthly stipend of $8. He died in 1908. In 1983, 8 years after Larsen's death, a 51-year-old former hairdresser named No. 1 Unnamed Archer unofficially assumed the tradition of town greeter. Archer said he wasn't trying to be Larsen, \\"I'm only walking where he walked, keeping a tradition alive. It's a tradition that stands still until someone comes along and fills the bill.\\" Archer continued intermittently for 25 years and died in 2009. In later years, several other local people have attempted to become the town greeter of Laguna Beach.Michael Minutoli is the most recent and consistent person to take up the job of greeter. He can often be seen waving and dancing by the Larsen statue on Brooks and PCH.

The building also houses a branch of the Municipal Library of Prague. The former site of the National Library of Technology was the Clementinum in the Old Town of Prague, from which all books and materials were moved to the library's current location after completion of the current building in 2009. The building was designed by architects Roman Brychta, Adam Hal√≠≈ô, Ond≈ôej Hofmeister and Petr Le≈°ek of Projektil Architekti after winning first prize in an architectural competition held in 2000.http://www.archdaily.com/29600/national-tecnical-library-in-prague- projektil-architekti/ Construction of the current building began in 2006 and was completed in January 2009. The library opened to the public on 9 September 2009 and now boasts the most extensive collection of Czech and international documents in the field of technology and applied natural and social sciences related to technology in the Czech Republic. The user-friendly design philosophy for the building has been described as a \\"high-tech living room for students\\" by the institution's Director Martin Svoboda.http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/new-national-technical- library-opens-in-prague  History  Today's National Library of Technology in Prague originated in 1718 as a collection of books belonging to the first Engineering Professor of the Czech Estates, Christian Willenberg (1655-1731). Over the next two centuries, the library grew as part of the Estates School of Engineering and other predecessors to the present-day Czech Technical University in Prague between 1786 and the outbreak of World War II in various locations. The library moved to the Clementinum as the Technical Universities Library (TUL) in 1935. In 1960, the library was renamed as the State Library of Technology (STK). Over time, the library began to outgrow space available at the Clementinum. Two remote storage facilities were procured between 1974 and 1981 in Prague 4-P√≠snice and in Lhota near Doln√≠ B≈ôe≈æany (each with capacity for 200,000 volumes), and in the late 1990s, the Czech Ministry of Education approved construction of the current building in Prague 6.http://www.techlib.cz/en/2749-about-ntk#tab_history Gallery File:N√°rodn√≠ technick√° knihovna - NTK.jpgNational Library of Technology in Prague (NTK) - a global view.

As of the final report on August 27, 2012, there were 33 deaths and 147 total confirmed cases since the beginning of the first recorded case on July 31, 2011. It was the worst foodborne illness outbreak in the United States, measured by the number of deaths, since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began tracking outbreaks in the 1970s, or tied with the worst, an outbreak of listeria from cheese in 1985, depending on which CDC report is used. Origin and spread Listeria monocytogenes, the bacterium responsible for listeriosis Listeriosis is an infection caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. The outbreak was determined to originate from Jensen Farms in Holly, Colorado after Listeria monocytogenes was found in cantaloupe samples at a Jensen Farms store in Denver, Colorado and at the farm's packaging plant. The batch of cantaloupes had been shipped out over a period from July 29 through September 10 to twenty-five states, including Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming. The outbreak was first reported by the Centers for Disease Control on September 12, where they stated that \\"fifteen people in four states had been infected\\". On September 21, a new report was released by the CDC, bringing the number of deaths to 13 and the number of confirmed cases to 72. The report also stated that further deaths were being investigated to determine if they had also been caused by Listeria infection. The CDC report also stated that, as Listeria \\"only sickens the elderly, pregnant women and others with compromised immune systems\\", the median age of all the people that had been infected was 78. On September 30, an update was released by the CDC, reporting that as of 11 am (EDT) Sep 29, 2011 the number of confirmed cases was 84, number of deaths was 15 and the number of states involved was 19. On October 4, the CDC updated their report to 100 infected individuals in 20 states and a total of 18 deaths from the outbreak. The outbreak was shown to have continued to spread to new states, with the CDC update on October 7 stating that the number of cases had risen to 109 in 23 states and that three more people had died to bring the death toll to 21. The CDC update on October 12 put the number of cases at 116 with 23 deaths. An update on October 18 increased the number of cases to 123 and the number of deaths to 25. The October 25 update raised the number of cases to 133, with three more people dying to raise the total to 28. A final update on August 27 confirmed 147 cases and 33 deaths. Fatalities occurred in Colorado (9), Indiana (1), Kansas (3), Louisiana (2), Maryland (1), Missouri (3), Montana (1) Nebraska (1), New Mexico (5), New York (2), Oklahoma (1), Texas (2), and Wyoming (2). Among persons who died, ages ranged from <1 to 96 years, with a median age of 78 years. In addition, one woman pregnant at the time of illness had a miscarriage. Listeria infections can cause pregnant women to miscarry; the first miscarriage attributed to the 2011 outbreak was reported in early October, in a woman living in Iowa. Pregnant women often are advised to avoid foods, such as unpasteurized cheese and hot dogs, that are known to have the potential to carry Listeria, but fruits such as cantaloupe had not previously been identified as sources of concern. No list of retailers selling the infected cantaloupes was released by either the government or Jensen Farms. Although the last shipment was September 10 and the fruit had a two- week shelf life, as of September 29, the number of illnesses and deaths were expected to continue rising, because the incubation period could exceed one month. Recalls by retailers which had sold the Jensen Farms cantaloupes included Kroger (September 15), Safeway (September 15), Aldi (September 16), and US Foods (September 16). =FDA investigation= An investigation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that the contaminated cantaloupe harvest contained four separate Listeria monocytogenes strains, which the governmental agency found to be \\"unusual\\", but was still trying to determine the reason. On October 20, it was reported that the FDA officials had found listeria on dirty, corroded equipment used by Jensen Farms, which had been bought used and was previously utilized for potato farming. It was stated by the government that the \\"equipment's past use may have played a role in the contamination\\". Water contaminated with listeria was also found on the floor of the packing plant and it was determined that the workers moving around the plant had spread it, as the contaminated water was also found on the cantaloupe conveyor belt. It was noted by officials that Jensen Farms had \\"passed a food safety audit by an outside contractor\\" six days before the outbreak. The method of how the listeria bacteria first came to be in the plant remains unknown, as the soil on the farm was determined to be clear of the bacteria. It is suspected, however, that a \\"dump truck used to take culled melons to a cattle farm...could have brought bacteria to the facility\\". Furthermore, Bacteria growth may have been caused by condensation stemming from the lack of a pre-cooling step to remove field heat from the cantaloupe before cold storage. =House Energy and Commerce Committee investigation= On October 21, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, a committee panel of the United States House of Representatives, began its own investigation into the outbreak. The Committee \\"requested a staff briefing from Jensen Farms\\" and all of the documents they had on the incident. They also requested information from the FDA, CDC, and other governmental groups. Jensen Farms response In response to the initial reports by the CDC on the contaminated cantaloupe, Jensen Farms issued a voluntary recall on September 15 of the entire harvest crop of 300,000 cantaloupe that it had distributed to its chain stores. The FDA made the public announcement for the recall after Listeria infection was confirmed by Jensen Farms at its main Colorado branch. Jensen Farms was also forced to temporarily shut down its processing plant while the recall is ongoing. Government officials have been investigating the company's main facility in Colorado to determine if there was \\"animal or water contamination\\", but there have been no results from the investigation thus far. Holly, Colorado residents were described as being left \\"reeling and in fear\\" because of the disaster for its local producer. Political responses The FDA has stated in response to the extensive bacterial outbreak that it is \\"yet another reason to fully implement the Food Safety Modernization Act.\\" Sherri McGarry, a senior adviser for the FDA, stated that, \\"We're going to take these lessons learned, share that with our partners and industries, CDC and the states, and what we want to do is we want to really prevent this from happening in the future.\\" Also, in response to an auditor passing Jensen Farms food safety methods and failing to notice the listeria bacteria in the plant, the deputy commissioner of foods, Michael R. Taylor, had stated that he intended to \\"establish standards for how auditors should be trained and how audits should be conducted.\\" Lawsuit On September 15, a lawsuit was filed against Jensen Farms by the first victim of the contaminated cantaloupe crop, who had fallen ill and been kept in the hospital for several weeks. He and his wife were involved in the legal proceedings. In addition to Jensen Farms, the couple also sued a Walmart branch in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where they had bought the cantaloupe, for selling unsafe food.

The painting is sexually charged: Spencer's second wife was a lesbian in a long-term relationship when they married, and their marriage was never consummated. The painting is held by the Tate Gallery, which describes it as \\"probably now Spencer's most famous picture\\".Exhibition at the Tate in 2001; Room 3: Forsaking the Vision The painting is one of seven portraits that Spencer painted of his wives between 1933 and 1937, all nude or semi-nude: one of his first wife, Hilda Carline; four of his second wife, Patricia Preece; and two double portraits of Spencer and Preece together. Unusually for Spencer, who usually painted portraits from memory, these seven were painted from life. Spencer and Preece are depicted naked, painted in an explicitly realist style, with close attention to the tones and textures of the skin of the subjects. Spencer squats at the rear of the painting, naked but for his spectacles, looking down pensively at Preece. Preece reclines across the painting, with her arms behind her head and legs spread.

P.I. Moms Butler used the name P.I. Moms to identify and promote his use of women investigators to land a reality show based on his business. Transcript Arrest Butler was arrested on February 16, 2011 along with Central Contra Costa County California Narcotic Enforcement Team Commander Norman Wielsch. The two men were accused of selling police-confiscated crystal methamphetamine, anabolic steroids, and marijuana. These items had been seized as evidence in unrelated investigations and arrests. The materials had been stolen from police evidence lockers. Both men were indicted on 28 felony counts. The counts include embezzlement, second- degree burglary and conspiracy, as well as the drug-related charges. Butler's bail was set at $840,000, and Wielsch's was set at $660,000. Upon arrest, both were held in the Contra Costa county jail, located in Martinez, California. On February 8, 2012, the Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office dropped all state charges against Butler while a case against him continued at the federal level. In May 2012, Butler pleaded guilty to robbery, extortion, and conspiracy, and in September 2012 he was sentenced to eight years in prison. Dirty DUIs As recorded in published transcripts of his interviews with police detectives on March 17, 2011, Butler admitted that he hired female decoys to assist in determining if a \\"target\\" male, usually the husband of his female client, would drink alcohol in a quantity sufficient to exceed the legal limit to drive an automobile. Once the \\"target\\" male had been observed to consume this amount of alcohol likely to exceed the legal limit to drive, the hired female decoys would leave the establishment and ask the target to follow them home. An associate coined the phrase \\"dirty DUI scheme\\" to describe the practice. A number of the arrests and convictions resulting from the practice have been expunged and overturned, along with apologies from the senior deputy district attorney of Contra Costa County, Hal Jewett, whose office prosecuted the original cases. Jewett was quoted in his cover letter to one man arrested in a Butler \\"sting\\" operation as saying the drunken driving arrest was \\"one of the most deplorable legal practices I have ever heard of.\\" Media coverage Butler's organization was featured in the media. Using these media appearances as marketing and with the help of a Beverly Hills public relations company, Butler signed a contract to be part of a reality television show on Lifetime Television.\\"For ‚ÄòMommy P.I.‚Äô sleuth, an abrupt script change\\" Prior to the filming of the reality show, Butler was contacted by the local pop culture periodical Diablo Magazine in an effort to appeal to the demographic that the magazine served. As admitted by several participants in the actions, Butler re-enacted a case to satisfy the \\"ride along\\" demand of the magazine's reporter, Peter Crooks. The re-enactment was executed on September 11, 2010, including a convoluted journey into the Napa Valley wine country tailing a suspected cheating fianc√© and his mistress. The \\"PIs\\" involved were also all in on the ruse. Crooks was easily fooled; he was convinced that his experience was real and went on to write the story. Calling himself \\"Ronald Rutherford\\", Carl Marino told Crooks that the entire case had been a re-enactment. In several subsequent emails from \\"Rutherford\\", Carl Marino laid out carefully crafted evidence for the reporter to show that he was trustworthy and that the information was valid. Carl Marino told Crooks that he was informing him as a favor so that the magazine could avoid embarrassment. After Crooks received the e-mail from Marino, he immediately contacted Butler and the \\"PI Moms\\" who had been on the ride along to question them about it.

In addressing the shared history of Latin America, the band exposes the faults that are still a factor in present-day Latin America.

In addition to the new footage shot throughout Latin America, the music video incorporates previously unused footage shot by the brothers from their pivotal trip captured in Sin Mapa. The video opens to a striking landscape of Peruvian mountains, as the silhouettes of Residente and Visitante are seen crossing the frame. The stepbrothers make their way up dirt roads, to a radio station in the Peruvian mountains, where they are presented to a Quechua-speaking DJ. As the video continues, additional symbolism becomes apparent. The start of the song‚Äôs instrumental music contains percussion reminiscent of the sound of heartbeats. The audio image of heartbeats is then synchronized to a large visual image of a beating heart. In the remainder of \\"Latinoam√©rica\\"'s music video there is a wide variety of interesting symbols that play off the song‚Äôs lyrics. Nevertheless, for the most part these symbols ultimately tie back to the themes of unity and knowledge.Calle 13 estrena clip Latinoam√©rica producido y dirigido por peruanos Musical composition The song primarily incorporates the Argentine chacarera, which is a style with 6/8 meter and syncopated drum patterns.

He intermittently ruled over Fars until 876, when he was captured and imprisoned by Ya'qub ibn al-Layth, the Saffarid emir of Sistan. Early career Muhammad was a member of an Arab family that had a long association with Kharijism. In 837 he took command of a group of Kharijites at Bost, and revolted against the Abbasid authorities. His forces were able to defeat the governor of Sistan's army and to capture its leader, the governor's son. Muhammad eventually released him after negotiations with the governor; he subsequently left the region of Bost and made his way to Kerman, which was home to a number of other Kharijite outlaws.Tor, p. 132 Rule of Fars Map of Fars and its surrounding regions in the 9th‚Äì10th centuries Subsequent to his activities in the east, Muhammad moved to the province of Fars. In 870, with caliphal control over Fars having been weakened by years of disorder, he decided to rebel against the government. He allied with the leader of the local Kurds,\\"Kurds\\" could be used by the historians as a general term meaning any nomadic Iranians. Minorsky, \\"The Guran,\\" Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 11:1 (1943), p. 75, qtd. in Tor, p. 126 n. 37 and together they defeated and killed the provincial governor, al-Harith ibn Sima. As a result of this victory, Abbasid rule in Fars collapsed, and Muhammad was able to take control of the province.Bosworth, pp. 147-8; Tor, p. 132; al-Tabari, p. 116 Less than a year after his takeover of Fars, Muhammad was threatened by Ya'qub ibn al-Layth, the self-made emir of Sistan. Ya'qub set out west for Fars with the intention of subjugating the province. Sources disagree on what happened next, but Ya'qub was eventually dissuaded from continuing his expedition, and he turned back toward Sistan. His withdrawal is described as having been caused either by Muhammad's submission to him, or by the arrival of emissaries sent by the caliphal government to convince him to abandon his westward advance. In either case, Muhammad soon afterwards reached a rapprochement with the central government, and in 872 he handed over the kharaj (tax revenues), and possibly the government of Fars, to a caliphal representative.Bosworth, pp. 148-9; Tor, pp. 132-3; al-Tabari, pp. 119, 137 The amicable state of relations between Muhammad and the caliphal government did not last, and soon Muhammad reverted to his earlier opposition to Abbasid authority. In 875, Musa ibn Bugha, who had been given responsibility for Fars by the central government, sent an army under the command of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Muflih to establish a firm Abbasid presence in the province. When Muhammad learned of this development, he advanced toward Khuzestan and reportedly met the caliphal army at Ramhormoz. The two sides engaged in combat, and Muhammad was victorious; Ibn Muflih's lieutenant, Tashtimur, was killed, and Ibn Muflih was captured by Muhammad's forces. The central government sent an envoy to secure Ibn Muflih's release, but Muhammad refused their offers and executed the general. Muhammad then announced his intention of marching against Musa ibn Bugha, and advanced to al-Ahwaz. Musa, recognizing his inability to control the situation, resigned his governorship and transferred responsibility for Fars to the caliphal regent, al-Muwaffaq.Bosworth, pp. 149-50; Tor, p. 156; al-Tabari, pp. 164-5 Muhammad's campaign in the west came to a sudden end with the news that Ya'qub ibn al-Layth had once again advanced from Sistan. This time, he invaded Fars and advanced to Estakhr, seizing Muhammad's treasuries there. Muhammad departed from Khuzestan, and returned to Fars in an attempt to stop Ya'qub. They met near Lake Bakhtegan in August 875, and in the resulting battle, Muhammad, despite having a numerically superior army, was defeated. Muhammad was forced to flee; Ya'qub looted Muhammad's stronghold at Sa'idabad and took control of Fars.Bosworth, pp. 150-2; Tor, p. 157; al-Tabari, p. 166 In the aftermath of his defeat, Muhammad once again turned to the Abbasids, and managed to restore himself to favor with the central government. Ya'qub, meanwhile, continued marching west, moving first through Khuzestan and then pressing into Iraq. His advance brought him close to Baghdad and the Abbasid capital of Samarra, but in April 876 he was defeated by a caliphal army led by al-Muwaffaq at the Battle of Dayr al-\`Aqul. Ya'qub's invasion of core Abbasid territory alienated the government against him, and after the amir's defeat, Muhammad was appointed to Fars as a caliphal governor in opposition to Ya'qub.Bosworth, pp. 153, 158-61; al-Tabari, pp. 168-72 Muhammad's governorship over Fars was short-lived. Even before his formal investment as governor, he had returned to the province and gathered supporters to his cause. Ya'qub, however, despite his defeat at the hands of the Abbasids, still had the strength to reassert his authority within Fars, and when the two enemies began fighting, Muhammad soon found himself unable to maintain his position. When he realized his cause was lost, he attempted to flee from Fars, heading along the coast as far as the port city of Siraf, but after a year he was captured by the Saffarid army, and imprisoned.Bosworth, p. 163; al-Tabari, pp. 181, 185 Muhammad's ultimate fate is not explicitly stated by the historians. According to one account, Muhammad remained in confinement for two years before a revolt in the prison compound was violently suppressed by Ya'qub's soldiers; after this, Muhammad disappears from the sources.Bosworth, pp. 163-4 n. 480 Notes References *Bosworth, C.

In 2019, the Dudley Community was formed, reflecting the administrative split between the undergraduate and graduate programs that were under Dudley House since 1991. The student center for the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Science (formerly Dudley House) is based in Lehman Hall; the building houses a dining hall, library, game room, computer lab, coffee shop, lockers, and common rooms. Affiliated undergraduates have access to Dudley House advisers, programs, intramural athletics, and organized social events. History A decentralized commuter center was established in 1935 called Dudley Hall, named after the former Governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony Thomas Dudley. Coinciding with the founding of the Dudley Co-operative Society (Dudley Co-op)‚ÄîHarvard's off-campus cooperative housing dormitory‚Äîit was renamed Dudley House and officially became part of the Harvard House system in 1958. It moved from Dunster Street to the Ambassador Hotel on Cambridge Street in 1963. Dudley House consolidated operations and moved to its current location at Lehman Hall in the southwest corner of Harvard Yard in 1967. In 1961, the Dudley House dining hall was the first at Harvard to go coeducational, which was an experiment that paved the way for the University's eventual merger with Radcliffe College.

(2003). Is who you are who you‚Äôre talking to? Interpersonal style and complementarity in mixed-sex interactions. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 84, 80-96. Essentially, each action carried out by a member of a group has the ability to elicit predictable actions from other group members. For example, individuals who display evidence of positive behavior (e.g., smiling, behaving cooperatively) tend to trigger positively valenced behaviors from others.Carson, R. C. (1969). Interaction concepts of personality. Chicago: Aldine. In much the same way, group members who behave in a docile or submissive fashion tend to elicit complementary, dominant behaviors from other members of the group. This behavioral congruency, as it applies to obedience and authority, has been illustrated in several studies assessing power hierarchies present in groups.Tiedens, L. Z., & Fragale, A. R. (2003).

Background  It is not known when Lu Xisheng was born. His family claimed ancestry from the ruling house of Tian of the Warring States period state Qi, and traced its subsequent ancestry through officials of Han Dynasty, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang Dynasty, Chen Dynasty, and Tang Dynasty. Both Lu Xisheng's 5th-ancestor Lu Yuanfang and Lu Yuanfang's son Lu Xiangxian served as chancellors ‚Äî Lu Yuanfang under the female sovereign Wu Zetian, who interrupted Tang and established her own state of Zhou, and Lu Xiangxian under Wu Zetian's son Emperor Ruizong of Tang and grandson Emperor Xuanzong. Lu Xisheng was descended from Lu Xiangxian's younger brother Lu Jingrong (Èô∏ÊôØËûç). His grandfather Lu Mengru (Èô∏Â≠üÂÑí) served under a prefectural prefect, and his father Lu Ao (Èô∏Áø±) was not listed with any official titles.New Book of Tang, vol. 73.  Early career  It was said that Lu Xisheng was studious and was good at writing. He particularly understood the I Ching, the Spring and Autumn Annals, and the Tao Te Ching well, and wrote many commentaries. At one point, he served on the staff of Zheng Yu (ÈÑ≠ÊÑö) the prefect of Shang Prefecture (ÂïÜÂ∑û, in modern Shangluo, Shaanxi), at Zheng's request. After he left his service under Zheng, he became a hermit in Yixing. After a long period of time, he was summoned by the imperial government to serve as You Shiyi (Âè≥ÊãæÈÅ∫), an advisory official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). It was said that at that time the ruling officials were corrupt, and there had been several years of bad harvests, with the situation being particularly severe in the region of Bian (Ê±¥Â∑û, in modern Kaifeng, Henan) and Song (ÂÆãÂ∑û, in modern Shangqiu, Henan) Prefectures. Lu realized the severity of the situation and submitted petitions that warned that these conditions would be prime for the appearance of agrarian rebels, but apparently his petition drew no reactions. The next year, as he warned, the agrarian rebel Wang Xianzhi started a major rebellion.New Book of Tang, vol. 116.According to the Zizhi Tongjian, Wang Xianzhi's rebellion started in 874; if the account about Lu's petitions were accurate, Lu's petitions would have thus been in 873. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 252. Lu later served as the prefect of She Prefecture (Ê≠ôÂ∑û, in modern Huangshan, Anhui). Emperor Zhaozong heard of his fame, and recalled him to the imperial government to serve as imperial attendant (Áµ¶‰∫ã‰∏≠, Jishizhong).  Chancellorship and after chancellorship  In 895, Emperor Zhaozong made Lu Xisheng the deputy minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Hubu Shilang) and a chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. However, it was said that Lu did nothing important while being chancellor. He was removed from chancellorship just three months later and made an advisor to the Crown Prince. Later in the year, when Emperor Zhaozong fled the capital Chang'an into the Qinling Mountains due to the attack by the warlords Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and Wang Xingyu the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), Lu followed despite his being ill at the time.

The organization is almost a hundred years old. It began in the 1920s, when a group of boys reported a forest fire to a local forest ranger in the province of British Columbia. The magazine \\"Forest and Outdoors\\", which was published by the Canadian Forestry Association (CFA), devoted a section to the activities, interests, and education of children. When a story was published in 1929 about how two boys discovered a small forest fire on Snug Cove on Bowen Island in British Columbia and assisted a Ranger in putting it out, an interest in this type of assistance grew. In the publicity that followed this incident, boys across the province wrote to find out what they could do to help in similar ways. As a result of this, Charles Wilkinson, a member of the Canadian Forestry Association in the region, formed the Junior Fire Warden program as a vehicle for teaching boys about forest protection. By 1930, more than 300 boys from across British Columbia had joined. In 1931, a tree was planted in Stanley Park, Vancouver, with soil collected by Wardens from across the province. The tree still stands today, as a symbol of the movement. In 1932, the name of the organization was changed to the name it bears today. The first Chief Warden was appointed by Vancouver Mayor W.H. Malkin in a ceremony in Vancouver at the time of the renaming. The program already included the earning of bronze badges in these early days. In 1934, the \\"red shirt\\" uniform still worn by members today was created. In addition, the boys and their organizers spontaneously formed into regional \\"clubs\\", beginning in the Vancouver area and spreading across the province. By 1942, Charles Wilkinson offered the job of Chief Warden to Bill Myring, who toured the province to lecture on conservation and help consolidate the organizing of local JFW clubs. Girls also became interested in wildfire prevention and forest conservation .A sister organization for girls was organized in 1944 under the name \\"Girl Forest Guards\\" by Margaret Myring, the wife of Bill Myring. About 500 girls joined a newly formed organization. The two organizations were distinct until they were merged under the common banner of the Junior Forest Wardens in 1974. In 1961, the activities of the Junior Forest Wardens in the province of British Columbia came to the attention of the Honorable Norman Willmore, a cabinet minister in the government for the province of Alberta. Impressed by the quality and range of their activities, Willmore sought to create an Alberta Charter for the Junior Forest Wardens, which was officially inaugurated in February 1962. Bill Myring, then Chief Warden of British Columbia, was then appointed Chief Warden of Canada, a position he retained until his death in 1989. Ken Kelsey held this position from 1990 to 2000, followed by Dave Cullen. Junior Forest Warden clubs have operated at various times across Canada. As of 2019, clubs are active in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland Labrador.  Junior Forest Wardens in Alberta  From 1961 until 2007 the Junior Forest Warden program was administered by provincial government. A central office in Hinton, operating through a network of Alberta Forest Service Ranger Stations, first carried out the administration of the program throughout the province. The office was eventually moved to Edmonton, Alberta the seat of the provincial government in Alberta. The title Chief Warden, which was a volunteer position in British Columbia, was used as a designation for the most senior bureaucrat with the Alberta Public Service who held primary responsibility for delivering the program in the province. The first Chief Warden in Alberta was Terry Whitely (1960 - 1967). Terry, a British expatriate who assumed the role in 1960 moved him and his family from Smith, Alberta where he was Chief Warden to Hinton, Alberta. Other Chief Wardens in Alberta have been: George Brewster (1967 - 1979), Bill Bresnahan (1980 - 1995), Jim Skrenek (1995- 1996), Bob Young (1996). During Bob Young‚Äôs tenure, the Chief Warden became a separate volunteer position from the provincial coordinator. The position is awarded to a volunteer who is elected by the provincial association. Ernst Klaszus was the first volunteer to hold position of Alberta‚Äôs Chief Warden from 1998 to 2007. Upon his retirement, he was given the title Chief Warden Emeritus and Terry Garrett was appointed Chief Warden in April 2007. . In 2005, the position of Assistant Chief Warden was created. The first Assistant Chief Warden was Terry Garrett, followed by Brian McBride and currently Cody Howitt. Since 2007, the Junior Forest Warden program in Alberta has been maintained by the Alberta Junior Forest Wardens Association, (AJFWA), an independent volunteer organisation. The AJFWA provides administration and oversight for all clubs in Canada.  Program Overview  According to a 2014 brochure, \\"Junior Forest Wardens is an exciting and educational opportunity for young people and their families to have fun, develop skills, and get educated in the many diverse aspects of our natural environment.\\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B70yOAfVbbGWTzZnLUswcTNBMmM/view The Junior Forest Wardens have built their programs foundation using the four components of forestry, ecology, outdoor skills and leadership. Young people between the ages of 6 ‚Äì 18 can join a local club, and enjoy age specific programming in one of the four appropriate age classes. Pathfinders ‚Äì Ages 6‚Äì8, Trailblazers ‚Äì Ages 9‚Äì11, Adventurers - Ages 12‚Äì14, and Challengers ‚Äì Ages 15‚Äì17. One of the key characteristics of the program is that parents are encouraged to participate with their children, in any aspect of the club program; from providing their expertise in a leadership or resource role, parent supervision, to learning right alongside of their kids. Leadership development for parents is a key component of the program as the majority of the program is provided through their volunteer efforts. Junior Forest Wardens is an outdoor oriented program, with an emphasis on the experience. The program is committed to providing opportunities to get outdoors: camping, backpacking, canoeing, mountaineering, tree planting and more! And to prepare for adventures like these, education is offered and promoted in wilderness skills development, first aid, trip planning and survival. To provide a greater appreciation of the natural resources while outdoors, Wardens are taught about tree, plant and animal identification, soil types, weather and water, resource management, threats to the environment and our resources and the list goes on... Clubs typically meet once per week to provide evening programming, with an outdoor event (camp-out or field trip) once per month. This schedule is augmented by offerings through the District, Regional and Provincial/National councils that give the opportunity to share the experience with a larger audience, networking with other clubs, and enhancing the experience.  Current organization  The organization continues to this day, and has chapters all across the country. Many of today's employees in the forestry service in Canada, whether government or industry, received their first training in the Junior Forest Warden program. Although there is a dearth of documented material describing the history of the organization, participation is widely cited and respected within Canadian circles. Since 1985, the program has been expanded to provide additional opportunities for training in Forestry, Ecology, Leadership and Outdoor Skills. It offers an interesting alternative to the Scouts or Girl Guides initiatives with a uniquely Canadian flavor and a whole-family inclusive approach.  Club Names and Locations  Clubs can be formed in any community in Canada, with a minimum involvement of three families. Currenty club locations are listed on the Association's website, ajfwa.ca Clubs are encouraged to give themselves a distinctive name, such as a favourite animal or a local connotation.

Lake earned her Honours Degree in Law in 1967. Lake was admitted to the bar in St. Kitts in 1967 soon after obtaining her law degree. Lake became a prominent jurist, specializing in human rights and constitutional law. Her chambers, Lake & Kentish, which she opened with attorney Joyce Kentish her niece and was later joined by Kendreth Kentish and George Lake, were located on Antigua. Lake was the chief architect of the 1975 Constitution of Anguilla. In 1981, she served as a member of the committee charged with framing the Constitution of Antigua and Barbuda.

The phrase was coined by journalist Paul Kelly in his 1992 book The End of Certainty. Kelly identified five policy \\"pillars\\" of the settlement: White Australia (a racially exclusive immigration policy); Protection (protective tariffs on imported manufactured goods); Wage Arbitration (compulsory arbitration for industrial disputes); State Paternalism (interventionist social and economic policies); and Imperial Benevolence (faith in the British Empire). These pillars profoundly influenced the way Australia developed over the coming decades and were only dismantled towards the end of the century. The term \\"settlement\\" refers to the way this constellation of policies emerged as a compromise between major interests in Australian society at that time, namely workers and employers. It has also been referred to as the Deakinite settlement, after its principal architect Alfred Deakin. Background Britain's Australian colonies had developed rapidly and successfully in the 19th century to become a major exporter of certain commodities, notably wool. By the 1880s they had become among the wealthiest societies in the world and had also developed unusually strong labour movements. Some manufacturing for local consumption had also become established. This was supported and promoted in the Colony of Victoria by a protective tariff that had been introduced in 1866 to help generate local employment for migrants initially attracted to the gold fields. Over the course of the economically difficult and industrially conflictual 1890s, the six colonies agreed to federate as the Commonwealth of Australia. The establishment of a national government spanning the continent and the transfer of certain key functions to that government entailed the establishment of new national policies in regard to a range of important economic and social matters. Customs tariffs, for instance, immediately became an exclusive concern of the Commonwealth government and the Commonwealth assumed primacy in a number of other areas such as immigration. Decade of decision: 1901‚Äì1910 There was obviously a lot of business for the new parliament in those first years after Federation took effect on 1 January 1901. The decision-making was complicated, though, by the fact that no single party enjoyed a majority until Labor took office in 1910.Peter Loveday, A.W. Martin & R.S. Parker, The Emergence of the Australian Party System (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977). The three-cornered contest between Protectionist Liberals, Free Trade Liberals and the Australian Labor Party (ALP), saw the Protectionists introduce the key \\"Australian settlement\\" policies with Labor support. This began with the Immigration Restriction Act, which had support from all sides of politics, and continued through the Customs Tariff Act, the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 and the Old Age Pension Act. In addition, the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration brought down its \\"living wage\\" determination requiring employers to pay their workers enough to support a man and his wife and three children. For theorist Francis Castles, implementation of these policies constituted an economic development strategy of \\"domestic defence\\" ‚Äì using Australia's natural wealth to support an otherwise uncompetitive manufacturing sector, providing a good living to workers and pensions for later life.Francis G. Castles, Australian Public Policy and Economic Vulnerability: a comparative and historical perspective (St Leonards NSW: Allen & Unwin, 1988). Dismantling Dismantling the domestic defence framework began with the ending of the White Australia Policy between the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s. Australia persisted, however, with other components such as tariff protectionism while other advanced economies were moving toward more open trade in the post-war years through the GATT process. Weaknesses in Australia's commodity exporting economy combined with steadily increasing competition in world manufacturing thanks to the newly industrialized countries (NICs) put that strategy under great pressure in the 1980s. Under the Hawke-Keating Labor governments (1983‚Äì96), both tariff protectionism and centralised wage fixing were wound back. As part of the campaign to liberalise the Australian economy in this period, journalist Paul Kelly coined the phrase \\"Australian Settlement\\" and blamed those early policy decisions for Australia's economic difficulties of the 1970s and 1980s.Paul Kelly, The End of Certainty (Allen & Unwin, 1992). A closer examination makes that interpretation difficult to sustain, but does not alter the reality that by the late 20th century the strategy of domestic defence had become an encumbrance.Alan Fenna, \\"Putting the 'Australian Settlement' in Perspective\\", Labour History, 102 (2012) pp. 99‚Äì118.

It is a monotypic genus, containing the single endophytic root-colonising species Piriformospora indica, discovered from orchid plants in the Thar desert in Rajasthan, India by Prof. Ajit Verma and group, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. The fungus has typical pear-shaped chlamydospores, and thus, named as P. indica . Unlike mycorrhizal fungi, which cannot be cultured axenically, P. indica can be easily grown on various substrates. It has been found to promote plant growth during its mutualistic symbiotic relationship with a wide variety of plants. Experiments have shown that P. indica increases the resistance of colonized plants against fungal pathogens. It has also been found in experiments with barley that P. indica-inoculated plants are tolerant to salt stress and more resistant to root pathogens. P. indica-infested roots also show antioxidant capacity. The fungus also induces systemic disease resistance in plants. P. indica was found to require host cell death for proliferation during mutualistic symbiosis in barley. Its genome has been sequenced and was published in 2011.

Morgan was also one of the founders and leading figures of the United Labor Party, an Illinois political party which elected 7 of its members to the Illinois State Assembly and another to the Illinois State Senate in the election of 1886. He was married to Elizabeth Chambers Morgan. Biography =Early years= Thomas John Morgan, known to his friends as \\"Tommy\\", was born in Birmingham, England on October 27, 1847.

As a boy Tommy Morgan attended a so-called \\"pauper's school\\" until the age of 9, at which time left school to take a job. Morgan worked as a nail maker, a printer, an iron molder, and a machinist, among other jobs, never managing to escape from poverty. Morgan married the former Elizabeth Chambers in January 1868. The next year the pair decided to depart for a new life in the United States, settling in Chicago, Illinois. =American years= In America Morgan went to work for the Illinois Central Railroad.\\"Thomas John Morgan,\\" in Stuart R.

He remained for 20 years with this company, working in the railroad car repair shops. In this occupational context Morgan joined the International Machinists and Blacksmiths of North America in 1871, in which he served as the president of his local in 1874. The economic depression of 1873 hit Morgan hard, resulting in 15 months of unemployment. This systemic economic failure made a particular impact upon Morgan, causing him to turn to the ideas of socialism in his effort to understand the crisis.Ralph William Scharnau, \\"Thomas J. Morgan and the United Labor Party of Chicago,\\" Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society. vol. 66 (Spring 1973), pg. 42. Morgan joined the Social Democratic Workingmen's Party of North America in 1876 and continued membership in its successor organization, the Workingmen's Party of the United States, which had changed its name to the Socialist Labor Party of America before the decade was out. In 1877 Morgan was instrumental in launching the Chicago Council of Trades and Labor Unions, a citywide union federation. In this capacity as a union official, Morgan guided a special committee of the Illinois State Legislature around various Chicago factories in 1879 and helped to draft city ordinances based on the English factory laws of the day. In that same year Morgan joined the Knights of Labor, a labor union making use of the structure and methods of a secret society. Morgan made two runs for Chicago alderman, standing for election in 1879 and 1881. Morgan ultimately left the Council of Trades and Labor Unions in 1884 to help form a more radical organization called the Chicago Central Labor Union. =After Haymarket= A large part of the Chicago organization turned to anarchism in subsequent years, culminating in the 1886 Haymarket bombing. Never an adherent of anarchist methods himself, the task fell upon Morgan and a handful of his co-thinkers to reestablish the Chicago socialist organization in the aftermath of the Haymarket Affair. In August 1886, Morgan and others from the Chicago labor movement called a conference of area labor activists with a view to establishing a new electoral organization. About 250 delegates attended the conference, which elected Morgan to an executive committee of 21 members. This committee was charged with calling another convention in September to nominate a citywide slate of candidates for the fall elections under the banner of the United Labor Party. Some 560 delegates, dominated by members of the Knights of Labor organization, attended the United Labor Party nominating convention in September.Sharnau, \\"Thomas J. Morgan and the United Labor Party of Chicago,\\" pg. 43. The meeting was not harmonious and following a spate of factional shenanigans a group of 26 conservative trade unionists were excluded from the gathering on the basis of their professed support for candidates of the Republican and Democratic Parties.Sharnau, \\"Thomas J. Morgan and the United Labor Party of Chicago,\\" pg. 46. Although not himself a candidate, Morgan played a key role behind the scenes of the United Labor Party, chairing the important committee on platform and resolutions at the nominating convention, and helping to shape the final program of the organization. The fledgling United Labor Party was surprisingly successful in the November 1886 elections, garnering about 25,000 out of 92,000 votes cast and electing 7 of its members to the Illinois Legislative Assembly and one other to the Illinois State Senate.Sharnau, \\"Thomas J. Morgan and the United Labor Party of Chicago,\\" pg. 48. A similar nominating convention was held by the United Labor Party in February 1887, attended by more than 600 delegates.Sharnau, \\"Thomas J. Morgan and the United Labor Party of Chicago,\\" pg. 52. Morgan was once again the power behind the throne as head of the platform convention and chief among the movers and shakers of the organization, prompting the Chicago Tribune to opine that \\"Tommy Morgan...bossed the convention from first to last.\\". Cited in Sharnau, Thomas J. Morgan and the United Labor Party of Chicago, pg. 52. The party's candidate for Mayor of Chicago was ultimately defeated by political fusion of the so-called \\"Old Parties\\" when the Democrats withdrew their candidate to support the Republican nominee \\"to save city government from capture by the 'Reds.'\\"Sharnau, \\"Thomas J. Morgan and the United Labor Party of Chicago,\\" pg. 54. Morgan was himself later to be a candidate for Chicago mayor in 1891, when he was tapped by the SLP as its nominee for that position. The year 1891 also saw Morgan help to organize the International Association of Machinists, a successful union which survives into the 21st century. He served as the General Secretary of that organization in 1894 and 1895. In 1893, while still occupied with union affairs, Morgan left work on the railroad to study law, ultimately graduating from Chicago Law College. He passed the exam of the Illinois State Bar in 1895. Morgan was tapped as editor of the Socialist Alliance, official organ of the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance, the trade union arm of the Socialist Labor Party, in 1896. He came to develop philosophical differences with SLP leaders over trade union policy, however, so he exited to join the Social Democratic Party of America in 1900. In the summer of 1901 that organization, headed by Eugene V. Debs and Victor L. Berger, merged with a rival political group to establish the Socialist Party of America (SPA). Morgan was a delegate to the founding convention of that organization in Indianapolis, Indiana. Morgan was a frequent candidate of the SPA, running for Chicago City Attorney in 1903, for Cook County Superior Court Judge in 1903 and 1907, and for U.S. Senate in 1909. He also attended three of the party's conventions as an elected delegate: the Chicago conventions of 1904,\\"Delegates to the 1904 Convention of the Socialist Party of America,\\" Early American Marxism website, www.marxisthistory.org/ Retrieved Sept. 27, 2011. 1908,\\"Delegates to the 1908 Convention of the Socialist Party of America,\\" Early American Marxism website, www.marxisthistory.org/ Retrieved Sept. 27, 2011. and the so-called \\"Congress\\" of 1910.\\"Delegates to the 1912 Convention of the Socialist Party of America,\\" Early American Marxism website, www.marxisthistory.org/ Retrieved Sept. 27, 2011. Morgan turned to journalism in 1909, editing and publishing a Socialist newspaper called The Provoker until shortly before time of his death in 1912. In 1910 Morgan was enlisted by veteran trade union activist \\"Mother\\" Mary Harris Jones to collect a 5-year old $250 debt from the Socialist Party's National Secretary, J. Mahlon Barnes.\\"Report of the Investigating Committee ‚Äî Sub-Committee of the National Committee: Feb. 28, 1911,\\" Socialist Party Official Bulletin, vol. 7, no. 6 (February 1911), pp. 2-3. The tangled dispute over whether Barnes did or did not repay led to charges of dishonesty being preferred against Barnes before the Socialist Party, which were dismissed as \\"frivolous\\" by the governing National Executive Committee. Morgan and Jones persisted, however, and a special investigating committee was established to hear the charges. In February 1911 the committee affirmed that \\"the charge was indeed a most frivolous one, whose action could have no other motive except a desire to embarrass, harass, and annoy the National Secretary.\\" The investigating committee also weighed in on Morgan's newspaper, calling The Provoker, \\"a publication largely for the dissemination of malice, slander, falsification, and misinformation.\\" The committee sought to turn the results of its inquiry over to Morgan's party branch for possible disciplinary action. =Death and legacy= While headed for retirement in California, Morgan was killed in a train wreck at Williams, Arizona on December 10, 1912. He was 65 years old at the time of his death. Morgan's papers are held by the Illinois Historical Survey Library of University of Illinois in Urbana.See Scharnau, \\"Thomas J.

Starring Lino Ventura and popular singers Jacques Brel and Johnny Hallyday, it recounts the adventures of five criminals who progress from conventional urban crime to international notoriety as celebrity kidnappers. The film was screened at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival, but wasn't entered into the main competition.  Plot  In Paris in 1972, a group of five career criminals realise that the rewards from their traditional way of life are shrinking in the modern world. Lino, for example, finds that his prostitutes want to be independent entrepreneurs recognised by the state. Jacques accepts that his bank robberies yield a low net return for high risks. After much discussion, the five settle on celebrity kidnaps. Their first target is the singer Johnny Hallyday, who is delighted at the publicity and himself writes them a huge ransom cheque. Decamping with the proceeds to Latin America, they are hired by left-wing guerillas to kidnap the Swiss ambassador. The government agree to free twenty imprisoned revolutionaries in exchange for his release. When Ernesto, leader of the rebels, refuses to pay the kidnappers' fee, they kidnap him and sell his freedom for cash to three separate buyers; his soldiers, the government, and the CIA. The gang decamp with the proceeds to the USA, where they hijack a 747 and return it for a fee in millions. Taking a holiday break on a yacht, they are hailed by five beauties in a speedboat. When the couples have paired off, Ernesto's soldiers scramble aboard. Under torture, the five men tell him how to access their Swiss bank account. Once he has their money, he hands them over to the French police, who put the five on trial. Their defence lawyer craftily claims that the trial is political rather than criminal. Worried, the justice minister arranges for them to escape and fly out of the country. Landing in Africa, their skills are in immediate demand. The army is planning a coup on the day after the Pope arrives for a visit. The gang kidnap the Pope at the airport and demand that every Catholic in the world must contribute at least one dollar for his release.

Anna Lundh first gained notability in 2009 when participating in and becoming a top finalist in the tenth Swedish season of Survivor. Early life Anna Lundh was born and raised in the locality Gesunda, in Mora Municipality, Dalarna County. Anna Lundh was the second youngest out of the 4 siblings in her family. About her childhood, Anna Lundh has stated that one of the happiest moments growing up was the birth of her youngest brother. Anna Lundh's major childhood influences included the Swedish author and screenwriter Astrid Lindgren, who is best known for the Pippi Longstocking book series. Aside from being inspired by Astrid Lindgren's work, Anna Lundh also admired Astrid Lindgren's support for children's and animal rights, the author's opposition to corporal punishment, her commitment to justice, non-violence and understanding of minorities as well as Astrid Lindgren's love and caring for nature. As a little girl, Anna Lundh used to sit glued in front of the television and long for being a contender in \\"Survivor\\" Sweden - (known as \\"Expedition Robinson\\"). The show was however cancelled before Anna Lundh became old enough and eligible for participation. Instead Anna Lundh began her television career on a show named \\"Outsiders\\". Like typical high school students, Anna Lundh was interested in pursuing a diverse range of future careers. She wanted to become a veterinarian and work with animals, a hair dresser, school teacher, police or an actress. By the age of sixteen, Anna Lundh was part of an extreme sports stunts duo with her friend Erika S√∂derman. Erika S√∂derman, who is a high performance precision driver and Guinness World Records holder, tilted a rolling car over on two wheels, allowing Anna Lundh to climb up on the side of the car so that both performed daring balancing acts. Education Anna Lundh attended elementary school at Soller√∂ Skola from kindergarten through grade 1-6. After junior high school, Anna Lundh specialized in social sciences at college-preparatory school where she graduated with honors. Career During her adolescence and after graduation, Anna Lundh worked as a cashier (checkout assistant), lifeguard, ticket seller, waste manager, waitress, youth leader, substitute teacher and kindergarten teacher. In 2008, Anna Lundh applied to the revived event show \\"Survivor\\", produced by ITV Studios Nordic for Sweden‚Äôs largest TV channel, TV4. Anna Lundh and 17 individuals were chosen out of 9,000 candidates. The shortlist of the thoroughly vetted contenders was released by TV4 on 12 January 2009. The show was filmed in the Philippines. Subsequent to successfully becoming a top finalist in 2009, Anna Lundh began working extensively as a media personality, performing alongside a string of other celebrities, international All-stars and champions, such as Glenn Hys√©n, Ralf Edstr√∂m and Thomas Ravelli. Anna Lundh is maintaining this career. In October 2011, Anna Lundh traveled to Seoul, Korea, after having been chosen by the Miss Supertalent of the World 2011 to represent Sweden. The final was held on October 15. Anna Lundh placed among the top 10 women among 50 candidates. Anna Lundh commented that she saw the top placement and results as a bonus, next to the privilege of representing Sweden, making new friends and learning about other cultures.

History  The original tree grew from a seed planted in the grove of Tom W. Brogden of Winter Haven, Florida in the 1930s. 'Brogden' may have been the result of a cross between Mexican-type and West Indian-type cultivars. 'Brogden' first received attention when a seedling of it was reputed to survive the winter in North Carolina. The cultivar's name was published by the Florida State Horticultural Society in 1951, and it became recognized for its cold hardiness, unique dark-purple skin color, and superior flavor. Though it had no major commercial potential due to its thin skin, 'Brogden' was recommended for home growing in areas of Florida where avocados needed to be more cold hardy than most to survive. Today 'Brogden' trees are still propagated and sold as nursery stock, both in Florida and in other states where avocados can be grown. 'Brogden' trees are planted in the collections of the University of Florida's Tropical Research and Education Center in Homestead, Florida as well as the Miami-Dade Fruit and Spice Park, also in Homestead.  Description  'Brogden' trees produce B-type flowers. The fruit is shaped like a pear, and averages just under a pound in weight. The flavor is rich and nutty, somewhat like Hass. The skin is thin and has a dark-purple color at maturity (often described as black). Fruit production is average compared to most avocado varieties, and the fruit typically matures from July to September in Florida.

In 1947, she married Samuel Zacks, a Canadian economist and art collector, whom she met during her stay in Switzerland. After marrying, the couple began to collect art items from the 19th century and the 20th century, mainly of French, Canadian and Israeli artists such as Gauguin, Rodin, Picasso, Henri Matisse, Kandinsky and Chagall. They also acquired art by Israeli artists such as Marcel Janco, Mordechai Ardon, Reuven Rubin and Anna Ticho, and art of relatively unknown artists at the time of the purchase such as Ofer Lellouche, Yigal Tumarkin and Joseph Zaritsky. In 1970, her husband Zacks died. She returned to Israel in 1976 and married Zalman Abramov, who was a lawyer and a Knesset member.◊û◊™◊î ◊§◊ò◊®◊ï◊†◊ô◊™ ◊î◊ê◊û◊†◊ï◊™ ◊ê◊ô◊ú◊î ◊ñ◊ß◊° ◊ê◊ë◊®◊û◊ï◊ë - ◊í◊ú◊®◊ô◊î - ◊î◊ê◊®◊• The couple were patrons of the arts, and Abramov continued to support the art world even after her husband's death in 1997.

She mentioned these museums in her will, in which she declared that her art collection would be divided between them. The Israeli notable painter Joseph Zaritsky painted a well-known figurative portrait of her.

Originally arrested and convicted for murder in 1962 and sentenced to up to 30 years in prison, George Wright escaped from prison in 1970 and hijacked a Delta Air Lines flight in 1972 with a number of accomplices. On September 26, 2011, he was arrested in Portugal. The FBI requested Wright's extradition from Portugal to the United States, but was denied on the grounds that Wright is a Portuguese citizen. New Jersey offenses =Murder conviction= On Friday, November 23, 1962, the day after Thanksgiving, George Wright, then 19 and from East Orange, New Jersey, and three accomplices: Walter McGhee of Sylvan Avenue in Asbury Park, Elizabeth Roswell (McGhee's live-in girlfriend), and Julio DeLeon of Munroe Avenue in Asbury Park; were involved in the commission of multiple armed robberies. The four suspects first robbed the Sands Motel in Englishtown of $200. They then made their way to the Collingswood Esso gasoline station on eastbound Route 33 in Wall. At around 9:25pm, during the second robbery, McGhee fatally wounded Walter Patterson, a 42-year-old World War II veteran and Bronze Star recipient who lived in Howell. Patterson was a father of two teenage daughters. Patterson, who earlier that evening had relieved his brother Harry C. Patterson Jr. and sent him home to have dinner with his family, was taken to Fitkin Memorial Hospital in Neptune, where he died from the gunshot wound two days later. Wright, armed with a sawn-off .22-caliber rifle, and McGhee, armed with a .32-caliber pistol, were both wearing women's pantyhose over their faces when they assaulted Patterson. McGhee fired two shots during the robbery. Patterson was shot once in the abdomen before the four got away with $70 in cash. Police later determined it was a shot from McGhee's pistol that led to Patterson's death. The four were arrested two days later. On December 13, 1962, Wright was indicted on state charges along with his associates. McGhee, as the triggerman, was charged with Patterson's murder and sentenced to a life prison term in February 1963, but was paroled in August 1977. Wright, as one of the holdup men, was also charged with murder. On February 15, 1963, Wright reportedly changed his plea from Innocent to No Contest to the charge of murder, in order to avoid a jury trial that could have resulted in the death penalty. Wright was subsequently sentenced to 15 to 30 years' incarceration. =Escape from prison= On August 19, 1970, between 10p.m. and 11p.m., after serving over 7 years and 6 months of his sentence, Wright joined three inmates and \\"just walked out\\" between bed checks from a state prison farm at Leesburg State Prison, now known as the Bayside State Prison in Leesburg, New Jersey. Wright escaped with his future hijacking accomplice, George Brown, who was serving a three to five-year sentence for a 1968 armed robbery conviction. Allegedly they stole the prison warden's car to get away. They made their way to Detroit, where they became affiliated with the Black Liberation Army. On August 26, 1970, federal complaints were issued in Atlantic City, charging Brown and Wright with unlawful flight to avoid confinement. Federal offenses =Hijacking and extortion= On Monday, July 31, 1972, Wright, then 29, together with: * George Brown, then 28, of Elizabeth, New Jersey, (alias Harry Singleton) with whom Wright escaped from prison * Joyce Brown (aka Tillerson), then 31, of Spartanburg, South Carolina, accompanied by her 2-year-old daughter * Melvin McNair, then 23, born in Greensboro, North Carolina * Jean Carol Allen McNair, then 25, from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, accompanied by her 1-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son boarded Delta Air Lines Flight 841 in Detroit. The DC-8 flight was bound for Miami. Wright was dressed allegedly as a priest and, using the alias the Rev. Larry Darnell Burgess, he smuggled a handgun aboard the flight in a hollowed-out Bible.Portugal nabs N.J. killer/hijacker on the run since 1970, Michael Winter, USA Today, September 27, 2011 One passenger described the apparent ringleader as a black man, about 30, wearing a black mohair suit which others described as a clerical outfit. The pilot of the hijacked Detroit-Miami flight, Captain William Harold May, then 41 and a 20-year Delta employee, said Wright was the group's leader. The hijackers, allegedly members of the Black Liberation Army, seized the plane as it approached Miami, where they demanded that FBI agents (dressed only in bathing suits) deliver $1 million ransom to the plane; the FBI complied. The hijackers allowed the 86 hostage passengers to leave the plane in Miami, but kept the flight crew. They then ordered the plane to fly to Boston, where they refueled and took on an international navigator. They then directed the plane to Algiers, Algeria, where they sought political asylum since that government had shown compassion towards those struggling for liberation. May told reporters that two of the hijackers smoked marijuana continuously during the flight, and commented, \\"They said they were revolutionaries, that America is a decadent society and they didn't want to live here anymore.\\" Upon arrival in Algeria, Melvin McNair had parting words for his pilot: \\"We're famous,\\" he said, \\"Send us a copy of your paper.\\" On Wednesday, August 2, 1972, federal complaints of air piracy charges were filed in Miami, naming the five accomplices as defendants. Asylum in Algeria Wright and his associates were briefly taken into custody but were released after a few days. Reportedly, Wright and his group were taken in by the American writer and prominent Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver, whom Algeria's sympathetic Socialist government allowed to open an office. Cleaver wrote an open letter to the then Algerian President, Houari Boumediene, in part: This hijacking represented the final test of the Third World nation's commitment to supporting some contingents of the African American freedom movement. At the request of the U.S. government, the Algerian government confiscated and returned the $1 million in ransom money to the U.S. After the hijackers' calls to have the ransom money restored to them were ignored by the Algerian government, Wright and his associates disappeared. Allegedly in early 1973, the group traveled by ship to France and lived and worked there with new identities. Apprehension and refused extradition of accomplices On May 26, 1976, Wright's four associates were located in Paris and arrested by the French National Police for carrying false U.S. passports. Facing extradition to the United States, the four issued an appeal to the French people on October 11, 1976, claiming that while they were \\"ready to face the consequences of our act,\\" they could not expect a fair trial in America and \\"would be condemned to spend the rest of our days in infernal prisons.\\" French authorities declined the American extradition request in November 1976, holding the four defendants in the Fleury-M√©rogis prison, awaiting trial on hijacking charges. On November 24, 1978, the Fleury 4 were convicted by a French court for the hijacking. All received five-year sentences, but two years were suspended from the women's terms. In the United States, they would have faced a minimum of 20 years. The jury had found them guilty but noted \\"extenuating circumstances\\". George Brown and Melvin McNair were released in 1981. In 2012, a documentary titled Melvin & Jean: An American Story was made by director Maia Wechsler. Melvin McNair and his wife, Jean, work at an orphanage in the French town of Caen, where reportedly they have turned their lives around completely. McNair is known for coaching American baseball, teaching youth the art and strategy of the sport. In 2010, a documentary titled Nobody Knows My Name was made about the hijacking. According to Mikhael Ganouna, producer of the film, Wright's hijacking accomplice, George Brown, lives in Paris but isn't worried about being extradited because he has already served his sentence. Extradition in a similar preluding hijacking The Flight 841 hijacking was a copycat of a similar incident two months earlier, involving the hijacking of Western Airlines Flight 701 from Los Angeles to Seattle on June 3, 1972 by Willie Roger Holder, a black Vietnam veteran, and Catherine Marie Kerkow, his white girlfriend. The hijackers claimed they had a bomb in an attache case and demanded $500,000. After allowing all 97 passengers to get off in San Francisco, they flew to Algeria where they were granted political asylum. The Algerian government confiscated and returned $488,000 of the ransom money to US officials. On January 25, 1975, the two hijackers, carrying passports under the names Leavy Forte and Janice Ann Forte, were arrested on illegal entry charges by French police. On April 15, 1975, a French court refused a US extradition request for the pair on grounds the hijacking was a political act. In July 1986, French authorities moved to deport Holder to the US after he completed his sentence for 1984 assault charges. Kerkow went missing, was never extradited, and her whereabouts and status remain unknown. International fugitive captured After the apprehension of his four accomplices, Wright remained the lone hijacker at large. The elusive fugitive is known to have made his way to France, Guinea- Bissau (a former Portuguese colony), and finally to Portugal. While living in Guinea-Bissau in the 1980s, Wright allegedly used his real name and worked as logistics manager of the Belgium-based nonprofit Iles de Paix. =Apprehension= On September 26, 2011, Wright was arrested in Mem Martins, PortugalLocation of Wright's final capture in Portugal after 41 years on the run, as the result of a combined task force that introduced cold-case evidence from New Jersey. The task force matched Wright's fingerprints from the New Jersey prison with the fingerprints on the ID card issued by the Portuguese government. The United States sought his extradition, with the possibility that he will finish the remaining 22 years of his sentence. However, the request was denied on the grounds that Wright is a Portuguese citizen. =Life in Portugal= Wright, who lived under the name of Jos√© Lu√≠s Jorge dos Santos, had no known occupation, but allegedly at one point owned a BBQ chicken restaurant, sold items at a stall along a popular tourist beach, worked as a bouncer at a local bar, and, similarly to Melvin McNair, coached youth in American basketball. He married a Portuguese-English translator who was 13 years younger and, together, the couple had two children. His neighbors knew his first name was George, but did not know his history, assuming he was African, not American.

Sculpted by Italian artist Carlo Marochetti and erected in 1844, it is notable for being typically capped with a traffic cone, a practice which has become traditional in the city and is claimed to represent the humour of the local population. In 2011 the Lonely Planet guide included the statue in its list of the \\"top 10 most bizarre monuments on Earth\\".  History  The statue in June 2010 The statue was sculpted by Italian artist Carlo Marochetti and erected in 1844. Capping the statue with a traffic cone has become a traditional practice in the city, claimed to represent the humour of the local population and believed to date back to the first half of the 1980s, if not before. The statue is a Category-A listed monument. Due to minor damage and the potential for injury that the placing of cones involves, the practice had been discouraged by Glasgow City Council and Strathclyde Police. In 2011 the Lonely Planet guide included the statue in its list of the \\"top 10 most bizarre monuments on Earth\\". In a bid to reduce the cost of removing traffic cones from the statue, alleged to be ¬£10,000 a year, Glasgow City Council put forward plans in November 2013 to double the height of its plinth as part of a ¬£65,000 restoration project. The plans were withdrawn after widespread public opposition, spearheaded by a Facebook campaign called \\"Keep the Cone\\" (that accumulated more than 72,000 likes within 24 hours) started by Scottish musician Raymond Hackland and Glaswegian photographer Steven Allan. An online petition defending the cone received over 10,000 signatures. As the council indicated that action against the practice could still be considered, National Collective organised a rally in defence of the cone. In 2015, Glasgow City Council tested hi-tech CCTV software worth ¬£1.2m by checking to see whether it could automatically detect people putting cones on the statue, which it could.

He first came to public attention for his attempts to find the Tasmanian tiger. He later became noted for his writings on the human condition and theories about human progress. He founded the World Transformation Movement to advance his ideas in 1983. Early life Griffith was educated at Tudor House School in New South Wales and the Geelong Grammar School in Victoria. He first became known for his search for surviving Tasmanian tigers or thylacines, the last known specimen of which died in captivity in 1936. The search conducted from 1967 to 1973, included exhaustive surveys along Tasmania's west coast; installation of automatic camera stations; prompt investigations of claimed sightings; and, in 1972, the creation of the Thylacine Expeditionary Research Team with Bob Brown, which concluded without finding any evidence of the animal's continuing existence. Writings on the human condition Griffith began writing on the human condition in 1975, publishing the first of his six books on the subject in 1988. A Species In Denial (2003) became a bestseller in Australia and New Zealand. His writing is known for allowing readers to access the thoughts of many famous philosophers, thinkers and religious sources. His biological works on the origins of human nature assert that \\"humans act angrily because of a battle between instinct and intellect\\". An article by Griffith published in The Irish Times summarised the thesis presented in Freedom as \\"Adam & Eve without the guilt: explaining our battle between instinct and intellect\\"; and Kirkus Reviews wrote that \\"Griffith offers a treatise about the true nature of humanity and about overcoming anxieties about the world\\". The Templeton Prize winner and biologist Charles Birch, the New Zealand zoologist John Morton, the former president of the Canadian Psychiatric Association Harry Prosen, and the Australian Everest mountaineer Tim Macartney-Snape have been long-standing proponents of Griffith‚Äôs ideas. Morton publicly defended Griffith when he and his ideas were attacked in the mid-1990s. Griffith‚Äôs ideas have been criticised based on perceived problems with the empirical veracity of his anthropological writings, an objection that highlights his reliance on the writings of the African novelist Sir Laurens Van Der Post, and also the work of anthropologist Elizabeth Marshall Thomas. Griffith has argued throughout his writings that the driving force in human evolution was increased nurturing of offspring, a process he calls 'love indoctrination'.Griffith, Jeremy 'Free: The End of the Human Condition year= 1988, WTM Publishing & Communications Pty Ltd. He adopts a neo-Lamarckian view in which mothers model pro-social behaviour to offspring, with consequent behavioural changes resulting in 'soft' Lamarckian inheritance. Such behaviours will differentially proliferate if they are performed in the context of a social niche in which co-operative behaviour is favoured. Consequent to this genetic selection will stabilise changes that were initiated at the level of social behaviour. It is this process that he argues gave rise to the human moral sense. Evidence for this view is the reduced sexual dimorphism in the early stages of human evolution, particularly the loss of the aggressive canine morphology evident in other extant primate taxa. The theory postulates an intensification of maternal care, and associated increased pro-social behaviour of offspring, as being the distinguishing feature of the human lineage. His theory echoes that of Adrienne Zihlman, who postulated changes in patterns of sub-adult socialisation may have been important in the early stages of human evolution.Zihlman A. 1978. Women and Evolution, Part II: Subsistence and Social Organization among Early Hominids. Signs 4. According to a 2020 article 'The fury of the left, explained' in The Spectator Australia by Griffith, ‚Äòhonest biological thinking‚Äô can explain why the ideology of the political Left represents a threat to human progress: ‚Äòthe Left has given in to the temptation of relief-hunting and abandoned that all-important search [for understanding of the human condition]‚Äô. When interviewed by Alan Jones and Graham Richardson on their Richo & Jones Sky News Australia television program, Griffith said ‚Äúmy article in The Spectator last week was all about how we can bring rationale, understanding to the danger of the Left, reason versus dogma.‚Äù The World Transformation Movement The World Transformation Movement was founded by Griffith in 1983, as the Centre for Humanity‚Äôs Adulthood, an organisation dedicated to developing and promoting understanding of the human condition. It was incorporated in 1990 with Griffith and his colleague mountaineer Tim Macartney-Snape among its founding directors and became a registered charity in New South Wales in 1990, known as the Foundation for Humanity‚Äôs Adulthood. In 2009, the name changed to World Transformation Movement. In 1995, Griffith, Macartney-Snape and the Foundation for Humanity‚Äôs Adulthood (the World Transformation Movement name at the time) were the subject of an Australian Broadcasting Corporation Four Corners program and a Sydney Morning Herald newspaper article, in which it was alleged that Macartney-Snape used speaking appearances at schools to promote the Foundation, which was described as a cult. The publications became the subject of defamation actions in the NSW Supreme Court . In 2007, the ABC was ordered to pay Macartney-Snape almost $500,000 in damages, and with costs the payout was expected to exceed $1 million. The proceedings against the Herald were resolved when it published an apology to the Foundation in 2009. Although Griffith was not awarded damages in relation to the Four Corners broadcast, on appeal in 2010 the NSW Court of Appeal found what was said of him was untrue. Other writings Griffith‚Äôs biological analysis of the dangers of eucalypts in light of the 2019‚Äì20 Australian bushfire season, published in The Spectator Australia under the heading ‚ÄòThe science of bushfires‚Äô, was described by Alan Jones as ‚Äúan outstanding piece‚Ä¶what‚Äôs never been said before‚Äù during Griffith‚Äôs appearance on Jones‚Äô 2GB radio program and by Graham Richardson as ‚Äúbrilliantly written, really good prose‚Äù on the Richo & Jones Sky News Australia television program, in which Jones called Griffith ‚Äúa star‚Äù. Griffith‚Äôs analysis also generated interest in Australia and the UK.

He was acknowledged during his time as one of the most influential ministers in America. He is probably best remembered as the author of several well-known hymns, including \\"Rise Up, O Men of God\\". Early life and education William Merrill was born on January 10, 1867, in Orange, New Jersey, to George and Emily Merrill, both of English descent. During his youth, the family moved to Newburyport, Massachusetts, and then back to New Brunswick, New Jersey. Merrill earned his B.A. (1887), A.M. (1890), and D.D. (1904) from Rutgers. He also earned a B.D.(1890) from the Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York. Career Upon his ordination in 1890, Merrill became pastor of Trinity Presbyterian Church in Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania, where he served until 1895. From 1895 until 1911, he served as pastor of the Sixth Presbyterian Church of Chicago. There he met his wife Clara (n√©e Helmer). In 1911, Merrill was called to the Brick Presbyterian Church in New York City, where he served as pastor until 1938, when the merger with the Park Avenue Church took place and he resigned to become pastor emeritus. Merrill was named the first president on the Church Peace Union, an organization of religious, academic, and political leaders aimed at promoting pacifism. His 1914 sermon titled \\"The Making of Peace\\" was hailed by Andrew Carnegie as \\"...one of the greatest sermons on peace that he had ever heard.\\" Merrill was offered the presidency of Union Theological Seminary in 1917, but declined.

Biography Described as 'a nobleman of impeccable background and proven military ability', he was the only son and heir of Andrew Stewart (d.1578), Master of Ochiltree, and Margaret, daughter of his first cousin Henry Stewart, 2nd Lord Methven of Methven Castle. He was the grandson of Andrew Stewart, 2nd Lord Ochiltree, whose title he succeeded to after his father predeceased his grandfather. He became a General in the Artillery and held the office of General of Edinburgh Castle. He was appointed to the court position of Gentleman of the Bedchamber to James VI and I on 12 January 1587.Register of the Privy Seal. On the death of his grandfather in 1591, he became the 3rd Lord Ochiltree and inherited estates in Galloway and Strathclyde. In August 1592 the king sent him to raid the House of Row in Liddesdale to catch counterfeiters and their coining irons who were working for the rebel Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell. He joined forces with his brother-in-law, the laird of Ferniehirst, or Andrew Ker of Jedburgh, and captured two men at Row, a number of 30 shilling coins, and the coining irons in the tower, but the master coiner escaped to England.Robert Chambers, Domestic Annals of Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1858), p. 240 citing David Moysie. He was lieutenant and warden of the West March of Scotland in 1597.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), p. 424, 432-3. In 1608, he was sent by the King to quell feuds in the Western Isles, taking with him his uncle, John Knox. His orders including the destruction of shipping, named in his commissions as lymphads, galleys, and birlinns belonging to rebellious subjects.HMC 6th Report: Duke of Argyll (London, 1877), p. 623 \\"lumfaddis\\" and \\"birlinges\\". Though successful in this campaign, the King had no money with which to reward his military service and instead (in 1609) offered him 3,000 acres of land in County Tyrone, which included the Manors of Castlestewart and later Manor Forward, encompassing the area around Farlough and Roughan, all in the Barony of Dungannon. He was one of the chief 'planters' or 'undertakers' in the Ulster Plantation and in 1611 he settled on these estates. He built houses, farmed the land, constructed Roughan Castle and provided housing and employment for the local populace. He lived at Irry, which was later renamed Stuart Hall by his descendants. In 1615, with the King's consent, to raise money he resigned the feudal Barony of Ochiltree and sold it to his first cousin, Sir James Stuart, son of James Stewart, Earl of Arran. As compensation, in 1619, James VI and I raised him to the Peerage of Ireland and created him Baron Castle Stewart. No parliament sat between the years of 1615 and 1634, so he never voted. Family In 1587, he married Margaret, daughter of Sir John Kennedy of Blairquhan Castle, Ayrshire. They were the parents of five children: *Sir Andrew Stewart (1590-1639) 1st Baronet & 2nd Baron Castle Stewart; married Anne, daughter of John Stewart, 5th Earl of Atholl *John Stewart (d.1685), 5th Baron Castle Stewart; died unmarried *Robert Stewart, of Irry (1598-1662), Co.

The song was written on piano by lead singer Bono during the recording sessions for U2's 1988 album Rattle and Hum. Originally intending to give the song to singer Nina Simone, the band decided to keep it for Achtung Baby after playing it together. Thematically, the song describes a failing romance, mixing personal themes with imagery of metaphorical acts of terrorism. During the recording sessions for Achtung Baby, guitarist the Edge separated from his wife, Aislinn O'Sullivan. The separation had a major effect on the development of the song; Bono said that the ending guitar solo was a cathartic experience for the Edge, as he snapped several guitar strings during the recording. \\"Love Is Blindness\\" made its live debut on the group's 1992‚Äì1993 Zoo TV Tour and was performed regularly during the tour, appearing in 154 of its 157 concerts. It was commonly played as either the penultimate or closing song; as the penultimate song, it was usually followed by a rendition of the Elvis Presley song \\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\". Following the tour, \\"Love Is Blindness\\" has been played live only two other times. The track was favourably received by critics and has been covered by multiple artists. Writing, recording, and inspiration \\"Love Is Blindness\\" was developed by lead singer Bono during the recording sessions for U2's 1988 album Rattle and Hum.Stokes (2005), p. 109 He wrote the song on a piano, which guitarist the Edge said is \\"not an instrument he is noted for playing.\\"McCormick (2006), p. 228 The torch songs of Jacques Brel influenced Bono's songwriting. His initial plan was to send it to Nina Simone, one of his favourite singers, although after playing the song together, the band decided to keep it for themselves.Luerssen (2010), p. 262 They did not include the song on Rattle and Hum because they believed it was not \\"U2 enough\\". During the recording sessions for Achtung Baby, the Edge separated from his wife, Aislinn O'Sullivan. Reflecting on the impact it had on U2, Bono said, \\"We're a really tight community. This is not like somebody's, you know, girlfriend's left. We've grown up with these people, this our family, our community. This was really hard for us... It was like the first cracks on the beautiful porcelain jug with those beautiful flowers in it that was our music and our community, starting to go 'crack'.\\" The Edge explained that travelling to Berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage: \\"I was disappearing into the music for a different reason. It was a refuge in a way. That approach didn't completely work. You know, I wasn't really... in a good positive headspace. I was running away, I suppose.\\" While recording the guitar solo that concludes the song, the Edge \\"put everything into it, all the feeling, all the hurt, all the angst, everything went into that solo.\\" Bono said, \\"his whole life came out of him when he played... when we went for the take, one string broke and he just kept playing harder and harder. Another string broke. And he has such a light touch, ordinarily, he's so gentle. All that left him for a kind of rage. And yet there's not one bum note in there.\\"McCormick (2006), p. 232 Audio engineer Flood said the \\"bold, unadulterated, naked [guitar solo] sound was a combination of the part, the moment, a good guitar, a small amp, a simple mic. Edge just got an idea, tried it, and it worked straightaway.\\" Composition and theme The Edge (pictured in 1993) separated from his wife during the recording of Achtung Baby. He channeled his painful emotions from that time into his guitar playing on the song. \\"Love Is Blindness\\" runs for 4:23 (4 minutes, 23 seconds). According to Hal Leonard Corporation's sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, it is played in a 6/4 time signature at a tempo of 48 beats per minute in a key of B-flat minor. The production team gave bassist Adam Clayton's bass a \\"low end bass throbbing effect\\", which the Edge described as \\"a real stroke of genius from the production team.\\" Drummer Larry Mullen, Jr.'s drum pattern was taken from U2's 1987 single \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" and slowed down. The lyrics \\"[mix] up the personal and the political.\\" Bono noted that \\"There was some reference to the little death, which can be taken to mean a faint during orgasm but also works as an image of terrorism.\\" Quoting the lyric \\"A little death without mourning / No call and no warning / Baby, a dangerous idea / That almost makes sense\\", he said, \\"There's nothing more deadly than an idea ‚Äì or a person ‚Äì that's almost right. You know, it took the 20th century a hundred years to get over communism. There's another dangerous idea that almost made sense.\\" U2 biographer Bill Flanagan credits Bono's habit of keeping his lyrics \\"in flux until the last minute\\" with providing a narrative coherence to the album.Flanagan (1996), p. 20 Flanagan interpreted Achtung Baby as using the moon as a metaphor for a dark woman seducing the singer away from his virtuous love, the sun; he is tempted away from domestic life by an exciting nightlife and tests how far he can go before returning home.Flanagan (1996), p. 187 For Flanagan, the final three songs on Achtung Baby‚Äî\\"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)\\", \\"Acrobat\\", and \\"Love Is Blindness\\"‚Äîare about how the couple deal with the suffering they have forced on each other. Uncut contributor Gavin Martin believed the song contained \\"images of love, debased or abandoned.\\" He wrote, \\"With its stark, churchlike organ intro, pulsating bass synth and guitar reverb stretched into a hallucinatory squall, it brilliantly describes the discord and dread that provide a constant undertow to Achtung Baby. And yet, through its alluring sonic palette and wounded but sensual vocal, 'Love Is Blindness' also maps out a search for harmony and salvation\\". Author Atara Stein wrote that the song \\"suggests that love can operate only through a willful self-deception, a voluntary surrender to what one knows is an illusion. The singer begs his lover to 'wrap the night' around him because, as he proclaims, 'I don't want to see.' The singer knows that the image he creates of his loved one is false, but it is the only image that can satisfy him. He must perceive his beloved in idealized terms, so she can reflect back to him the image of himself that he desires to see.\\"Richey (1999), p. 271 Journalist Bill Graham believed the song was a bleak account of a failing romance.Graham (2004), p. 45 Hot Press editor Niall Stokes wrote that the song \\"takes us back ‚Äì again ‚Äì to the shadowy world of deceit, infidelity, and betrayal. It depicts love at the end, the very end, of its tether. It is as bleak and as despairing a view of the world as you're likely to get, reflecting the emotional climate in which the entire album had been made.\\" He noted, \\"In terms of its mood, 'Love Is Blindness' had the dark, sensual and decadent feel of pre-war Berlin\\", adding that the lyric \\"Love is blindness / I don't want to see\\" was \\"a desolate acknowledgement of the terrible reality that it is sometimes better not to know.\\" Reception \\"Love Is Blindness\\" was favourably received by critics. Uncut contributor Gavin Martin rated the song five stars, calling it \\"rapturous and unsettling.\\" Hot Press editor Niall Stokes said, \\"its sentiments made it the perfect conclusion to Achtung Baby, describing the Edge's playing as \\"a mournful, ejaculatory guitar solo, stabbing out thick emotional blues notes that linger and then fall away like tears.\\" Third Way reviewer Roland Howard described it as \\"haunting and melodic\\", believing it to be about the loss of virginity. Music journalist Bill Wyman said the Edge's guitar playing on the song sounded like a \\"dentist's drill\\". Jon Pareles of The New York Times described it as \\"a kind of summation\\", calling it \\"an elegy that compares love to 'drowning in a deep well' and wishes for it anyway.\\" Geoffrey Himes of The Washington Post wrote that it has \\"a gospel quality, as swooning synth parts are set against block piano chords, and Bono acknowledges that mismatched lovers will suffer their inevitable fate.\\" Greg Potter of The Vancouver Sun believed it to be a \\"dour closer\\" that was \\"riddled with images of self-doubt and uncertainty\\". A critic for the Waterloo Region Record said it was \\"hardly great U2, but U2 closers have always been anti- climactic.\\" Writing for the Boston Herald, Romandetta called it a \\"broken-hearted [lament]\\" that was \\"gentle\\" and \\"subdued\\". George Varga of The San Diego Union-Tribune said it was one of the most interesting tracks on the albums, calling it a \\"spare, David Bowie-like [ode] to tormented love\\". Michael Ross of The Sunday Times and James Healy of The San Diego Union-Tribune lamented that U2 did not include it on the compilation album The Best of 1990‚Äì2000. The Edge called it \\"a great end to the album and probably one of Bono's finest lyrics.\\" Bono said, \\"The bass sounds like liquid at the centre of the earth, a kind of molten lava bass sound.\\" Describing the Edge's guitar playing, he said, \\"It's incredible.\\" Live performances \\"Love Is Blindness\\" debuted on 29 February 1992 in Lakeland, Florida, on the opening night of the Zoo TV Tour, where it closed the concert.de la Parra (2003), pp. 140-141 It remained in this position throughout the first and second leg of the tour, with only two concerts concluding with an alternate song ‚Äì \\"With or Without You\\". \\"Love Is Blindness\\" was not performed on either of those two occasions.de la Parra (2003), p. 142 Beginning on the third leg of the tour it was followed by a cover of the Elvis Presley song \\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\" and, on one occasion, \\"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\\".de la Parra (2003), p. 162 The song was performed at 154 of 157 concerts on the tour, closing 67 of them.de la Parra (2003), pp. 140-172 On multiple occasions Bono brought a girl from the audience on to the stage to dance with during the song. Following the conclusion of the Zoo TV Tour, \\"Love Is Blindness\\" has appeared in concert only twice. The first occasion was on the Elevation Tour; while performing in Calgary, Alberta, on 10 April 2001, Bono sang a few lines from the song at the conclusion of \\"One\\".de la Parra (2003), p. 232 The final appearance was during a Vertigo Tour concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 1 March 2006, when U2 performed the song spontaneously to conclude the concert. U2 concert historian Pimm Jal de la Parra called the live rendition \\"sultry, as the screens show a constellation map, giving the crowd a feeling of floating across the universe by the way it moves, transmitting a mood of distance and loneliness that corresponds with the nature of the song.\\" Mark Lepage of The Gazette described the dance at the conclusion as \\"an appropriate moment of human contact after almost two hours of uproar.\\" Julie Romandetta of the Boston Herald believed it to be an anticlimatic finish to the concert, calling the song \\"low-key\\" and saying \\"U2 soared for more than 90 minutes, but left with a whimper, instead of a bang.\\" Gary Graff of the Houston Chronicle believed it to be a \\"moody show-closer\\". Writing for The Arizona Daily Star, Gene Armstrong called it an \\"achingly romantic closing tune\\", describing the Edge's solo as \\"especially tender\\". A live performance of the song appears on Zoo TV: Live from Sydney (1994), and Zoo TV Live (2006). The Zoo TV Live performance is an audio rip of the performance from Zoo TV: Live from Sydney. One performance, recorded on 30 August 1992 in New York City, was included as a B-side on some versions of U2's 1994 single \\"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\\". A video for the song, directed by Matt Mahurin, was included on the 1994 VHS single \\"Numb\\". It featured the studio recording set to footage of the Zoo TV Tour. An acoustic performance by the Edge appears in the 2011 documentary From the Sky Down. Cover versions \\"Love Is Blindness\\" has been covered several times. Cassandra Wilson included it on her 1995 album New Moon Daughter. Dutch band Kane recorded a version for their 2000 album With or Without You. Trespassers William covered it on the 2001 tribute album Even Better Than the Real Thing, and on their 2002 self- released album Different Stars. Sixpence None the Richer recorded a cover for the 2004 benefit album In the Name of Love: Artists United for Africa. The Devlins featuring Sharon Corr included a version on the 2005 tsunami relief album Even Better Than the Real Thing Vol. 3. Angolan musician Waldemar Bastos recorded a cover for the 2008 album In the Name of Love: Africa Celebrates U2. A rendition by Jack White appears on the 2011 tribute album AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered, and as the B-side of his own single, \\"Sixteen Saltines\\". It was later released as a bonus track on the Japanese edition of White's Blunderbuss album. This cover is also featured on the album The Great Gatsby: Music from Baz Luhrmann's Film. In March 2015, video director DirectorBrazil and choreographer Zach Venegas released a music video using the Jack White rendition's audio track and starring 13-year-old American dancer Chloe Lukasiak (formerly of Dance Moms reality show), as well as brief appearances by other teenage dancers. The video was filmed in Nov. 2014 in Los Angeles and released as part of the Team Chloe Dance Project on Lukasiak's YouTube channel. In 2013, Jacquie Lee covered the song on the fifth season of The Voice. Madi Davis subsequently covered it on the show's ninth season. In 2016, singer Lee-La Baum (of the band The Damn Truth) covered the song for a television commercial for Yves Saint Laurent's Mon Paris.

Built by the de Colville family in the 12th century, it was destroyed in 1449, by Sir William Douglas. The ancient barony of Ochiltree belonged to the family of Colville, who were Normans that came to Scotland about 1174. The castle stood on the bank of the Lugar, upon a high, rocky bank. The Castle of Ochiltree was captured by Douglas in 1449, and Colville and his male retainers slaughtered and his lands laid waste. This was an act of retaliation for the slaughter, by the hand of Colville, of Auchinleck of Auchinleck, a friend of Douglas. The summit of the Ochiltree motte After the castle was destroyed, all of the stones from the ruin were carried away, reused in building houses and dykes on the adjoining farms. In 1530, it was exchanged by Sir James Colville with Sir James Hamilton of Finnart for the barony of East Wemyss in Fife. In 1534, it was exchanged by its new owner with Andrew Stewart, Third Lord Evandale, for the barony of Evandale. After the latter exchange, Stewart was created first Lord of Ochiltree. Two interesting circumstances are related in the history of the old castle. One is the marriage of John Knox, there, in March, 1564, to Margaret Stewart, daughter of Lord Ochiltree; and the other is the marriage of John Graham of Claverhouse, to Jane Cochrane, niece of Sir John Cochrane, which was celebrated at the castle in June, 1684. The view of the River Lugar from the motte summit The peerage of Ochiltree became dormant in 1675, and the barony passing through many hands, went into the possession of the first Earl of Dundonald, who bestowed it upon his second son, Sir John Cochrane. It was forfeited by Sir John in 1685, but re-acquired by his son from the Crown in 1686, was purchased from the Cochrane family about 1737 by Governor M'Crae, who left it to Miss Macquire, afterwards Countess of Glencairn. It was finally re-sold about 1817 in lots to different proprietors. The castle is said to have been totally destroyed by fire, together with all the charters, plates and other valuables.

In: Interventional Pain Management SD Waldman and AP Winnie (eds) WB Saunders 1996.American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP.org) Website History Early efforts at interventional pain management date back to the origins of regional analgesia and nerve blocks, and gradually evolved into a distinct specialty. Tuffer described the first therapeutic nerve block for pain management in 1899. Von Gaza developed diagnostic blockade in pain management, using procaine for determining the pain's pathways. Modern day contributors include Bonica, Winnie, Raj, Racz, Bogduk, and others. The term \\"interventional pain management\\" was first used by pain management specialist Steven D. Waldman in 1996 to define the emerging specialty.Atlas of Interventional Pain Management 3rd ed. S.D. Waldman (ed) Elsevier Philadelphia 2010. The subspecialty of interventional pain management has received a specific specialty designation by the United States National Uniform Billing Committee to allow its practitioners to bill Federal healthcare programs including Medicare and Medicaid.National Uniform Claims Committee(nucc.org) Website Physicians who practice interventional pain management are represented by a variety of pain management organizations including the Society For Pain Practice Management and the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians.Society For Pain Practice Management(sppm.org) Website Radiation Radiotherapy is used when drug treatment is failing to control the pain of a growing tumor, such as in bone metastasis (most commonly), penetration of soft tissue, or compression of sensory nerves. Often, low doses are adequate to produce analgesia, thought to be due to reduction in pressure or, possibly, interference with the tumor's production of pain-promoting chemicals. Radiopharmaceuticals that target specific tumors have been used to treat the pain of metastatic illnesses. Relief may occur within a week of treatment and may last from two to four months. Neurolytic block Cross section of the spinal cord showing the subarachnoid cavity, and spinal nerve roots including the dorsal root ganglion A neurolytic block is the deliberate injury of a nerve by the application of chemicals (in which case the procedure is called \\"neurolysis\\") or physical agents such as freezing or heating (\\"neurotomy\\"). These interventions cause degeneration of the nerve's fibers and temporary interference with the transmission of pain signals. In these procedures, the thin protective layer around the nerve fiber, the basal lamina, is preserved so that, as a damaged fiber regrows, it travels within its basal lamina tube and connects with the correct loose end, and function may be restored. Surgically cutting a nerve severs these basal lamina tubes, and without them to channel the regrowing fibers to their lost connections, a painful neuroma or deafferentation pain may develop. This is why the neurolytic is preferred over the surgical block. Cutting or destruction of nervous tissue Cross-section of the spinal cord showing the dorsal column and the anterolateral spinothalamic tracts Surgical cutting or destruction of peripheral or central nervous tissue is now rarely used in the treatment of pain. Procedures include neurectomy, cordotomy, dorsal root entry zone lesioning, and cingulotomy. Neurectomy involves cutting a nerve, and is (rarely) used in patients with short life expectancy who are unsuitable for drug therapy due to ineffectiveness or intolerance. The dorsal root or dorsal root ganglion (that carry mostly sensory signals) may be usefully targeted (called rhizotomy); with the dorsal root ganglion possibly the more effective target because some sensory fibers enter the spinal cord from the dorsal root ganglion via the ventral (motor) root, and these would not be interrupted by dorsal root neurectomy. Because nerves often carry both sensory and motor fibers, motor impairment is a possible side effect of neurectomy. A common result of this procedure is \\"deafferentation pain\\" where, 6‚Äì9 months after surgery, pain returns at greater intensity. Cordotomy involves cutting into the spinothalamic tracts, which run up the front/side (anterolateral) quadrant of the spinal cord, carrying heat and pain signals to the brain. Pancoast tumor pain has been effectively treated with dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) lesioning ‚Äì damaging a region of the spinal cord where peripheral pain signals cross to spinal cord fibers. This is major surgery, carrying the risk of significant neurological side effects. Cingulotomy involves cutting the fibers that carry signals directly from the cingulate gyrus to the entorhinal cortex in the brain. It reduces the unpleasantness of pain (without affecting its intensity), but may have cognitive side effects. Intrathecal infusion A patient-controlled analgesia infusion pump, configured for epidural administration of fentanyl and bupivacaine Delivery of an opioid such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, sufentanyl or meperidine directly into the subarachnoid cavity (the space between the spinal cord's inner, waterproof sheath and its outer protective sheaths) provides enhanced analgesia with reduced systemic side effects, and has reduced the level of pain in otherwise intractable cases. The anxiolytic clonidine, or the nonopioid analgesic ziconotide, and local anesthetics such as bupivacaine, ropivacaine or tetracaine may also be infused along with the opioid. Epidural infusion The outermost, protective sheath surrounding the spinal cord is called the dura mater. Between this and the surrounding vertebrae is the epidural space, filled with connective tissue, fat and blood vessels, and crossed by the spinal nerve roots. A catheter may be inserted into this space for three to six months, to deliver anesthetics or analgesics. The line carrying the drug may be threaded under the skin to emerge at the front of the patient, a process called tunneling. This is recommended with long term use so as to reduce the chance of any infection at the exit site reaching the epidural space. Spinal cord stimulation Electrical stimulation of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord can produce analgesia. First, the leads are implanted, guided by the patient's report and fluoroscopy, and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath the skin of the upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they are attached to the snugly-fitting generator. It seems to be more helpful with neuropathic and ischemic pain than nociceptive pain, and is not often used in the treatment of cancer pain. Deep brain stimulation Ongoing electrical stimulation of structures deep within the brain ‚Äì the periaqueductal gray and periventricular gray for nociceptive pain, and the internal capsule, ventral posterolateral nucleus and ventral posteromedial nucleus for neuropathic pain ‚Äì has produced impressive results with some patients but results vary and appropriate patient selection is important. One study of seventeen patients with intractable cancer pain found that thirteen were virtually painless and only four required opioid analgesics on release from hospital after the intervention. Most ultimately did resort to opioids, usually in the last few weeks of life. Hypophysectomy Hypophysectomy is the destruction of the pituitary gland, and has been used successfully on metastatic breast and prostate cancer pain.

It was designed by R. Fizir and D. Stankov built at the Factory Zmaj in Zemun in 1936. Design and development In 1933, the command of the Yugoslav Royal Air Force (YRAF)decided to replace outdated planes with modern school aircraft, for transitional training from basic training to combat. Zmaj Factory designed a prototype biplane, Fizir FP-1, in 1993 for transitional pilot training, but it did not satisfy all the requirements set by the YRAF. As a result, aircraft designers and engineers, Rudolf Fizir and Du≈°an Stankov, made adjustments to the Fizir FP-1 and so the plane became the, Zmaj Fizir FP-2. The designers opted for the concept aircraft biplane, although the YRAF preferred an aircraft with one low wing (due to the development of modern combat aircraft). In the end, the concept of a new transitional school aircraft was accepted. Prototype Zmaj Fizir FP-2 (Fizir Prelazni) with a Gnome-Rh√¥ne 7K engine was completed and test flown at the end of 1933. More test flights followed, and by 1934 the plane showed good results. Zmaj modified the FP-2 during 1934 using a Walter Pollux II engine, but the results were not satisfactory. The Zmaj Fizir FP-2 was a two-seater single-engine biplane aircraft, with air- cooled, 7 cylinder radial engine (Gnome-Rhone K-7 308 kW), and a pair of struts on each side. It had flaps on the upper and lower wings. Landing gear is fixed to a shaft, and deployment uses a rubber rope. Fuselage and wings were wood covered with canvas. The plane represented a classical \\"Yugoslav manufacturers 'school'\\" - a two-seater, two wings, solid wood construction and polished aerodynamic shape, easy to fly, stable and reliable aircraft that is largely insensitive to pilot errors. On 22 May 1936, the Zmaj factory offered the Navy a seaplane Zmaj Fizir FP-2H with a Gnome-Rhone K-9 engine, but the project was not accepted.–®. –û—à—Ç—Ä–∏—õ; –§–∏–∑–∏—Ä –ø—Ä–µ–ª–∞–∑–Ω–∏ –§–ü-2, –§—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç –±—Ä.1349, 1. —ò—É–Ω–∞ 1984., –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ Operational history A total of 66 aircraft of this type were produced and served in the Yugoslav Royal Air Force from 1936 to 1941.

From 1938 to 1940 45 more aircraft were delivered.

These planes had a new pilot's panel and Zemun Teleoptik (similar to the Rogo≈æarski PVT). The fifth series Zmaj Fizir FP-2 (15 copies ordered in 1940) was not completed by the start of the April war. At the beginning of 1943 the Germans allowed factory to complete the fifth series aircraft Zmaj Fizir FP-2 for the Croatian Air Force, but by 22 October 1944 (Liberation Day Zemun) only 8 aircraft were delivered. The last 7 aircraft were completed and handed over after the People's Liberation Army Air Force for use by the Yugoslav Army. Thus the total number of Zmaj Fizir FP-2 aircraft produced was 81. =Aircraft Zmaj Fizir FP-2 in World War II= The Italians seized 13 Zmaj Fizir FP-2 aircraft and with the Rogo≈æarski PVT aircraft they were used from May 1941 to June 1943 against the rebels in Montenegro and Albania. The Germans seized 7 Zmaj Fizir FP-2 at the Butmir airport and handed them over to their allies, the Croats (NDH), which used them throughout the war, starting in 1941. All planes of this type that survived the war were included in the Yugoslav Army Air Force (RV JA) and flew there until 1947. The postwar registry included were 12 Zmaj Fizir FP-2 planes. The remains of one of these planes are kept at the Museum of Yugoslav Aviation.

He combined painting with the family business until 1878 and continued to sit on the board of directors of major companies in Lombardy even afterwards. A pupil of Mos√® Bianchi and Achille Formis, he focused primarily on landscape and drew upon the contemporary work of the school of Lombard Naturalism. His large output of landscapes ‚Äì mostly featuring Lake Maggiore, the coast of Liguria and the Engadin ‚Äì reveals a cultured artist abreast of the latest developments. Constant participation in the major Milanese and national exhibitions from 1881 to 1891 also suggests the image of a professional painter. Friendship with Luigi Scrosati fostered an interest in flower painting alongside the passion for collecting Roman coins that began in 1870 and saw the publication of a number of short works written together with his brother Ercole on the classification of his collection. This comprised some 20,000 items on his death in 1919 and was purchased by the state in 1923 for the Museo Nazionale Romano. Gnecchi was also highly regarded for his work on numismatics, and was awarded the medal of the Royal Numismatic Society in 1906.http://numismatics.org.uk/medals-honorary-fellowship-prizes/the-societys- medal/ He is the father of verismo opera composer Vittorio Gnecchi.

It is part of the Mu Koh Surin marine park although being about 18 km east of Surin Island. The horseshoe-shaped reef discovered by Jacques-Yves Cousteau is known for its purple corals as well as diverse marine life ranging from small fish and harlequin shrimp to large pelagics like whale shark, manta ray, barracuda, and grouper. Discovery and name There are many stories about the naming of Richelieu Rock - many of which are demonstrably false. One such story is Richelieu Rock was discovered as a recreational scuba dive site by diving pioneer, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, with the help of local fishermen.. The problem with this however is Cousteau never came far enough north during his visit to Thailand. On his Andaman expedition he came as far north as Koh Bon island whilst waiting a permit for Myanmar (which was never granted) and no further. The origin of the name is disputed. Some say it was named by Cousteau after the red colour of Cardinal Richelieu's robe due to the red to purple colours of the soft corals on the reef. Others claim it was named after General Richelieu, a commander in the Royal Thai Navy. This theory is supported by the existence of official Navy maps mentioning Richelieu Rock from the early 1900s, predating Cousteau's first visit to Thailand, in 1989.... Other evidence supporting this story are the fact that Richelieu was the first person to complete a hydrographic survey of the Andaman Sea including the area in question. Location The reef lies at in the Andaman Sea, about 80 km northwest of Khao Lak off Thailand's Phang Nga Province, very near to the provincial border of Ranong and about 18 km east of Surin island. There are no islands in the immediate vicinity of the reef. Whale shark at the Andaman sea Marine life Partly due to its unique geology as a solitary pinnacle standing out from around 30m. depth to just under the surface it is said to attract a variety of different pelagic species of all different sizes. Reports claim regular appearance of Snappers, Bannerfish, Lionfish, Triggerfish and Shovelnose Rays. Several sources also report sightings of filter feeders like manta rays and whale sharks, scavengers such as barracudas though fishing is said to have made their appearance less frequent. Richelieu Rock is also well known for its large variety of small and rare marine critters, such as sea horses, frogfish, harlequin shrimp, pineapplefish, orang utang crab and several other species of crabs and shrimp. Dive site  Dive Richelieu rock with Richelieu Rock. Richelieu Rock is considered by many to be one of Thailand's most iconic dive sites. It is usually accessed by diving boats during several day cruises, as it is too far off the coast to be reached by usual dive boats. There are speedboats that can go to Richelieu Rock as a daytrip. or liveaboards. Richelieu Rock is part of the Surin National Marine Park and is closed from 15 May until 15 October each year. =Depth= The limestone pinnacle rises from the sea floor depth of about 50 m. up to the surface at low tide.

Biography Born in Milan into a noble family, Gola was encouraged to develop his interest in art in his adolescence by his father, a dilettante painter. He graduated in industrial engineering from the Milan Polytechnic in 1873 and devoted himself to painting under the guidance of Sebastiano De Albertis. His training also involved frequent trips to Paris and the Netherlands. He made his debut at the 1879 Exposition of Fine Arts at the Brera Academy and afterwards participated regularly in national exhibitions, but obtained his greatest official recognition at the European level. By the 1880s he was an esteemed portrait who depicted women of the Milanese nobility in their fashionable, worldly dimension but with a vigorously naturalistic approach. His portraits were accompanied by a rich repertoire of views of Milan and the countryside of Brianza in bright colours that were to constitute his stylistic hallmark. Active in the region of Liguria and Venice, he focused in his late period on seascapes distinguished by great formal synthesis and expressive intensity. One of his pupils was Alberto Malaspina (painter) (1853‚Äì1903).Istituto Matteucci biography.

(Art collections of Fondazione Cariplo) Marco Gozzi (1759, in San Giovanni Bianco in Val Bembrana, Province of Bergamo ‚Äì 1839, in Milan) was an Italian landscape art painter. Biography Probably trained under the guidance of the painter Corneo, Marco Gozzi worked initially in a broad range of fields including portraiture, religious subjects and decorative frescoes executed in accordance with the Veneto tradition, then still predominant in the region of Bergamo. There is no record of his activity as a landscape painter until 1807, when he signed a contract with Count De Breme, then Minister of the Interior of the Kingdom of Italy, for the execution of four views of Lombardy a year in return for a government pension. His painting was transitional: he still aimed to depict an imaginary and romantic Arcadian and had not yet moved to attempt topographical depictions of the rustic landscape. Even by the 1860s, Locatelli was to note this reactionary attachment to the style of prior centuries; he viewed Gozzi as the last scion of the great idealist school of Poussin and Lorraine, now sagging and exhausted.Locatelli P., page 465. The ministerial contract for painting was renewed in 1812 and his regular participation in the annual Brera exhibitions began the following year. While he never held the chair in landscape at the Academy of Brera, he was elected an honorary member in 1829 and qualified as a landscape painter in 1832.

It is in the historic Graceland Cemetery in Chicago, Illinois, United States. History Martin L. Ryerson was a wealthy Chicago lumber baron and real estate speculator. He lived from 1818‚Äì1887 and during his lifetime he, and his son Martin Ryerson, Jr., commissioned several Chicago works by architect Louis H. Sullivan.Kiefer, et al., p. 140.Sinkevitch, Alice. AIA Guide to Chicago, (Google Books link), Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2004, p. 226, ().The buildings Sullivan designed for the Ryersons were the Jewelers' Building (1881‚Äì82), Revell Building (1881‚Äì83), Ryerson Building (1884), the Ryerson Charities Trust Building (1886), another Ryerson Building (1887), Walker Warehouse (1888‚Äì90). See Manieri-Elia. The Ryerson Tomb was commissioned by Martin Ryerson, Jr. in 1887,Manieri-Elia, pp. 23‚Äì24. and completed by Sullivan, lead designer at Adler & Sullivan, in 1889. The Ryerson Tomb is in the Lakeside section of Chicago's Graceland Cemetery, near the intersection of cemetery roads Main, Lake and Fairview Avenue.Kiefer, et al., pp. 16‚Äì17. Architecture The Martin Ryerson Tomb was designed by acclaimed architect Louis H. Sullivan in an Egyptian Revival style. Sullivan's design melds two different types of Egyptian-style buildings, the pyramid and the mastaba. The base of the tomb building is the slant-walled mastaba which features three windows. The mausoleum is constructed from large blocks of highly polished Quincy granite, and was inspired by Egyptian funerary traditions. The tomb's exterior contains no Egyptian symbols but has a door cutting directly through its center as well as an austere fillet cornice. The tomb's roof is topped with a tower which in turn is topped with a stepped pyramid. Uniquely, the tomb evokes Egyptian precedents through its dark, massive form, instead of the more typical reliance on Egyptian-style ornamentation. Inside the mausoleum is one of Sullivan's trademark arches, the arch frames a Sullivan-designed, but unsigned, bust of Ryerson.Kiefer, et al., p. 31. The Ryerson Mausoleum is one of three tombs that Louis Sullivan designed during his career. The Getty Tomb, completed one year after the 1889 Ryerson Tomb, is also located in Graceland Cemetery.Yalom, Marilyn. \\"The American Resting Place: Four Hundred Years of History Through Our Cemeteries and Burial\\", (Google Books link), Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2008, pp. 178‚Äì80, (). The other Sullivan-designed tomb, the Wainwright Tomb, is in St. Louis, Missouri. Significance The polished black granite reflects the cemetery landscape. The Ryerson Tomb is unique among Egyptian Revival tombs owing to its lack of overt, exterior Egyptian decoration. In a category all its own, the Ryerson Tomb is among the most important Egyptian Revival works in the United States.

He served as head of agricultural engineering and research at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Ibadan, Nigeria (1975‚Äì1980). Wijewardene worked with Sri Lanka's business, research, and policy communities in his areas of expertise. He held appointments such as Chairman of the Tea Research Board, Commissioner Sri Lanka Inventors Commission and was a member of public sector bodies concerned with agriculture, science and technology. He was Chancellor of the University of Moratuwa (2002‚Äì2007). The government of Sri Lanka awarded him its highest national honors of Vidya Jyothi (Luminary of Science) and Deshamanya (Pride of the Nation) for distinguished public service. Professional achievements In 1955, Wijewardene designed a two-wheeled, walking tractor to help small farmers in the tropics to mechanize their work. In an early attempt to mechanize farm labor during the Green Revolution, it was manufactured and marketed worldwide by the Landmaster company. He promoted the tractor with farmers in Africa, Asia, and Latin America for a decade. Wijewardene later questioned its value for poor farmers cultivating small holdings in the developing world. His lifelong interest was to help small farmers to grow more food with fewer external inputs. He searched for natural ways to manage soil fertility and weeds. He promoted a soil conservation technique called Sloping Agricultural Land Technology (SALT), originally developed in the Philippines. SALT involved land terracing, the use of leaf mulch, and re-introducing trees into rain-fed farming. After returning to Sri Lanka in 1980, Wijewardene spent the rest of his years researching and promoting ecologically sustainable agriculture and renewable energy technologies. He experimented with rain-fed farming and agroforestry methods on his coconut estate in Kakkapalliya, in Sri Lanka's Intermediate Zone. He did field tests for dendro thermal power, the generation of electricity from firewood. This technology is increasingly used by industry. He introduced inter-cropping gliricidia with coconut, vastly increasing coconut yields. Sporting accomplishments Wijewardene engaged in the water sports of rowing and sailing and represented Sri Lanka in international competitive events. He competed in the Olympic Games in Mexico in 1968, and won a Silver medal at the 6th Asian Games in Bangkok in 1970. He was a member of both the Colombo Rowing Club and the Ceylon Motor Yacht Club. As an aviator, he held a pilot license to fly fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters and autogyros. He experimented with building and flying ultralight aircraft and helicopters, and trained pilots and aircraft technicians.Nalaka Gunawardene, Ray Wijewardene: Finally free to roam the skies forever‚Ä¶, Alakagunawardene.com, 19 August 2010 Legacy In 2014, a postal stamp honoring him was released in Sri Lanka.Dr. Ray Wijewardene honoured with stamp issue, Sundaytimes.lk, 2 November 2014Honouring Ray Wijewardene, Dailymirror.lk, 31 October 2014 The Ray Wijewardene Charitable Trust was established in 2011 to support and reward Sri Lankan engineers.Ray Awards 2015, Airforce.lk, 25 August 2015 Family Wijewardene's father was Don Edmund Wijewardene (brother of D.

They are bounded to the north by the Kirnitzsch valley, to the south by the Elb valley and in the east by the two Winterberg hills. Overview The Affensteine are a very popular tourist destination. The Upper Affensteine Promenade (Obere Affensteinpromenade) is relatively level and offers splendid views over the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. The Carola Rocks (Carolafelsen) are also popular with walkers, being one of the best-known viewing points in the Affensteine massif. There are two theories about the origin of the name Affensteine, which literally means \\"monkey rocks\\". According to one, the name goes back to the spectacular flight of a young nobleman, who was incarcerated in the Vorderes Raubschloss, a robber knights' lair amongst the rocks. The legend has it that he had a tame monkey. The nobleman's servant tied the a rope around the monkey's body and set him climbing the steep rocks. The monkey delivered the rope, the young nobleman used it to escape and then fled to Bohemia. From there the story spread to Saxon Switzerland.Wanderung durch die Affensteine at www.elbsandsteingebirge.de. Accessed on 28 Sep 2011. The other explanation suggests the name is derived from the fact that owls used to nest here. The old German word for owl was Auf and so the rocks became known as the Aufensteine, which changed over the years to Affensteine.
